Appendix. —Some Native Tribes of Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland.
In submitting this short paper it may be stated that, having devoted several years
to the study of Australian languages, I hope it will be of value to philologists if I
publish some of the results of my labours. In 1901, I contributed to the Royal
Society of New South Wales 1 a brief article on the Thurrawal, Gundungurra, and
Dharruk languages, spoken by the aborigines of the south-east coast of New South
Wales, in which I drew attention to several peculiarities of grammatical structure
not previously reported in any Australian tongue. To the languages just mentioned
I propose giving the name of the Thurrawal type.
On the present occasion, the Kamilaroi type of language will be dealt with,
showing essential points of difference from tjie Thurrawal, to some of which
attention will be drawn.
The Kamilaroi territory may be roughly described as extending from Jerry’s
Plains on the Hunter River as far as Walgett and Mungindi on the Barwon, taking
in the greater part of the basins of the Namoi and Gwydir Rivers.
There are two pronouns in the first person of the dual and plural—one which
is used when the person addressed is included, and another which excludes the
person addressed (see pronouns). Rev. William Ridley in a short grammar of the
Kamilaroi gives two forms in the dual number, but he makes no mention of their
•existence in the plural, which leads to the inference that they escaped his
notice. 2
Perhaps it should he stated that I was the first author to describe in detail the
Bora, or initiation ceremonies of the Kamilaroi tribes, having visited and camped
with the natives for the purpose of acquiring the information. 3 Their social

organization and intermarrying laws were likewise fully described and explained
some years ago in my articles on “The Kamilaroi Class System,” in several
scientific journals. 1
Orthography.
Nineteen letters of the English alphabet are sounded, comprising fourteen
consonants and five vowels, namely, a, b, d, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, t, u, w, and
y. The system of orthoepy recommended by the circular issued by the Eoyal
Geographical Society, London, has been adhered to as far as possible.
In a few instances I have thought it necessary to introduce the marked vowels
S, 6, and it, to show unmistakably their long sound. Where the short sound of u
was otherwise doubtful, I have marked it thus, ft.
It is frequently difficult to distinguish between the short sound of a and that
of u. A thick sound of i is occasionally met with, which closely approaches the
short sound of uor a. Gis hard in all cases. B has a rough trilled sound, as in
hurrah!
Ng at the beginning of a word, as ngu in ngu'lu, the forehead, has a peculiar
sound, which can be got very closely by putting u before it, as ungu' and
articulating it quickly like one syllable. At the end of a syllable it has
substantially the sound of ng in the word sing. W always commences a syllable
or word, and has its ordinary consonant sound in all cases.
The sound of the Spanish n is frequent, both at the beginning or end of a
syllable. Y, followed by a vowel, is attached to several consonants, as dya, lyi, tyu,
etc., and is pronounced in one syllable, the initial sound of the d, l, t, as the case
may require, being retained. Yat the beginning of a word or syllable has its
ordinary consonant value.
Dh is pronounced nearly as tli in “ that,” with an initial sound of d preceding
it. Nil has nearly the sound of th in “ that,” with an initial sound of the n. The
final li is guttural, resembling ch in the German word joch.
T is interchangeable with d ; p with b ; and g with k in most words where
these letters are employed. An approach to the sound of jis frequently given by
the natives, which may be rendered by dy or ty at the beginning of a word or
syllable—thus, dya or tya has very nearly the same sound as ja.
In the Thurrawal words in the vocabulary attached to this article, dy or ty is
sounded as one letter, when occurring at the end of a syllable or word. Thus, in
birrity, sick, the last syllable can be pronounced exactly by adding e to the y,
making it rit-ye. Then commence articulating the word, including the y, but
stopping short without sounding the final, or added e. Dy at the end of a syllable
can be pronounced in the same way, the sound of d being substituted for that
of t.

In all cases where there is a double consonant, each letter is distinctly
enunciated.
Articles.
There are no words strictly corresponding to the English articles, a and the.
The demonstrative adjectives, this and that, in their various aboriginal forms, supply
the place of the definite article.
Nouns.
Number. —Nouns have no special inflection for the dual and plural numbers,
but these are represented by introducing a word meaning two, or several, as
follows: —
Singular A kangaroo Bundar.
Dual .. ... A pair of kangaroos ... Bundar bular.
Plural ... ... Several kangaroos ... Bundar gunubila.
Gender. —ln the human family different words are used to distinguish the sex,
as, murri, a man ; inar, a woman; birre, small boy; small girl, mea. A child of
either sex is kainggcd.
The gender of animals is denoted by words for “male” and “female”
respectively, but these words are different for mammals and birds. Wumbttrnga,
a buck; kurrundi, a doe; badger, a cock; gunidher, a hen. Gunal is another
name for a doe, as mute gunal, a female opossum. Another is, burama ngamumul,
a female dog. A male dog is mundaia.
Case. —The principal cases are the nominative, nominative-agent, genitive,
instrumental, accusative, dative, and ablative.
Nominative. — Murri, a man ; bundar, a kangaroo.
Nominative-agent.— Murridu mindere kaui, a man at a padamelon threw.
Bundaru ngunna mauin, a kangaroo me scratched. Inaru kainggal bumi, a woman
a child beat.
Genitive. — Murrigu burran, a man’s boomerang; inaru burama, a woman’s
dog.
Accusative. —In such expressions as murridu burama bumi, a man a dog beat,
the accusative remains unaltered.
Instrumental. —When an instrument is the direct object of the verb, it
takes a similar suffix to the nominative-agent, thus, burrandu ngaia karrawi, a
boomerang I threw.
Again, when the instrument is the remote object the accusative is unchanged,
and the suffix is added to the instrumental case, as, Ngaia burrandu kainggal burnt,
I with a boomerang a child beat.
Dative. — Wullai, a camp. Wullaidha, to the camp. Murridha, to the man.
Ablative.— Wullaidhi, from the camp. Murridhi, from the man. Bundari,
from the kangaroo.
In illustrating the declensions of nouns and adjectives it will be observed that
the suffixes vary in the same case, according to the termination of the word to


which they are attached, apparently for the sake of euphony. For example, the-
nominative agent has du in some instances, and u in others, as murridu, burrandu ,,
inaru, buralu, etc. In the genitive case the suffix is gu and u, as murrigu, inaru,
etc. The suffix to inar is the same as that of the nominative agent, the meaning
being made clear by the other words of the sentence, as, inaru mumbal, a woman’s
coolamin. In the ablative case dhi and i are used. The dative has dha, ga,
and a.
Adjectives
Adjectives follow the nouns they qualify, and take the same inflections for
number and case.
Nominative. — Murri bural, a man large. Inar dhunggur, a woman lame.
Nominative agent. — Murridu buralu kainggal bumulda, the big man is beating
the child.
- Genitive. — Murrigu buralu burran, the big man’s boomerang. Inaru
dhungguru Jcunne, the lame woman’s yamstick.
Instrumental. —When an instrument is the remote object of the verb, it
requires a suffix, as, Murridu buralu burrandu kurraivile, the big man is throwing
a boomerang. In such an instance the first suffix is often omitted.
Dative. — Murridha burala dhaiyannunga, come to the big man.
Ablative. — Murridhi burali yannunga, go away from the big man.
Comparison;—Equality is expressed by saying, Murruba numma—nungurrage
murruba buma, good this—that other good also. Inferiority is shown by Num
murruba —nungillia guggilclul, this is good—that is no good at all. Or less
forcibly, Murruba numma—nungurrage guggil, this is good—that is bad. The
sense of the superlative is rendered by, Numma murruba bungan gigilla, this is
the best of all. Numma gainmurra bungan, this is the smallest. Gainmurradyul
means very small. Bulami means very large.
When used as predicates, adjectives can be conjugated like intransitive verbs,
by using the fitting particles. There is a kind of auxiliary verb, gilla, having the
sense of “to be” or “to become,” which is used with such adjectives. For
convenience I will introduce it here, instead of under the heading of verbs.
In the following example, the word murru , meaning “ good,” and also “ well
in health,” will he used.

Conditional Mood.
Singular, f Murru ngaia ya ginge ... Good I may become.
Ist Person '-Murru ngaia yelle ginginde Good if I become.
The remaining persons and numbers of each tense can be obtained by
substituting the necessary pronouns, as explained and illustrated in dealing with
the verbs in later pages.
It would be better, perhaps, to include the predicative adjectives among the
verbs, but I have thought it as well to illustrate them under the present heading,
for the purpose of keeping all the adjectives together.
Pronouns.
Pronouns have person, number and case, but are without gender. There are
two forms in the first person of the dual and plural, for the purpose of expressing
the inclusion or exclusion of the person addressed. The nominative pronouns
are:—
{lst Person ... I ... ... Ngaia.
2nd „ ... Thou ... Ngindi
3rd „ ... He Nguru,
Nginda.
Nguru.
- p erson f We, inclusive Ngulli.
I We, exclusive Ngullingura.

" p erson f We, inclusive Ngeane.
1 We, exclusive Ngeanyel.
Plural ...< 2 nc | You ... ... Ngindai.
3rd „ ... They ... Ngurv/gunnaqa.
The possessive and objective forms of these pronouns are as under: —
{My ... Ngai Me ... Ngunna.
Thy ... Nginnu ... ... Thee ... Nginunn
His ... Ngurunqu ... Him ... Numma.
Nginnu ... ... Thee ... Nginunna.
Ngurungu ... Him ... Numma.


’ Ours, incl. Ngullingu ... Us, incl. ... Ngullina.
Ours, excl. Ngullingurungu ... Us, excl. ... Nungullina.
Yours ... Nginalingu ... You ... Nginalunna.
-Theirs ... Ngurungidlingu ... Them ... Nummagalena.
"Ours, incl. Ngeanengu ... Us, incl. ... Ngeaninna.
Ours, excl. Ngeanydlangu ... Us, excl. ... Nganinagunnunga.
Pluro.l \
Yours ... Nginnangu ... You ... Nginanna.
-Theirs ... Ngwrugunnungu Them ... Nummagunnunga.
Relative Pronouns.—The equivalent of these is obtained by such expressions
as the following: Ngar murri nguri yannamyen —burran ngai garamulmyen, that
man away went yesterday—boomerang mine stole yesterday.
Interrogatives.—A few of the interrogatives are: Nganna, who ? NgannUy.
whose ? Ngandu bundar bumi, who the kangaroo hit ? Ngannudnyi, who from ?
Minya, what ? Minyadu nha gimubbi, what that did ? Minyaguna, what for ?
Minyagu nginda dhai yannawah, what for comest thou? Minyagu nginda
yannawain, what for went thou ? Minyangguddha, how many times ? Minyungai,
how many ?
Demonstratives.—These are in great number and variety, some of which are
as follows:— Nha, this. Nuggu, that. Nhungurragai , this other. Murrangurragai ,.
that other. Nhurragwannu, that farther one. Nhai wurre, this (in rear of
speaker). Ngufragudhai, that (farther this way). Ngunnundhi, this (in front of
the speaker). On the left of the speaker, wurragal. On the right, thuriaL
Nuddhai, this way. Numma, this fellow (at rest). Nguruma, this fellow (in
action). Ngurraberedha, that (in front). Nha ngunna kurriduldha, this touching
me. Ngurriba , up there.
Indefinite Pronouns. —The following are a few examples:— Gunubula, a few.
Guno, all. Ngurregedyul, another.
The following are a few miscellaneous examples in different cases of the
pronouns :— Dhai ngunnanda yannunga, to me come. Ngunnandlii yannunga from
me go. Gai ngai, child my. Gaigu ngaiungu, for my child. Baina ngai, father my.
Baindulngu ngaiungu, for my father.
Verbs.
The termination of the verb differs in each of the tenses, as, bumulda, bumi
bumulli. There are also variations in the past and future tenses to express slight
differences in the time, thus, bumulngen, did beat this morning, etc. Bumullinge
will beat to-morrow, etc. (see Conjugation below). These variations are the same
in all the persons and numbers of the tense to which they respectively apply. The
different numbers and persons are generally indicated by employing the necessary
pronoun. For example, Ngaia bumulda, lam beating. Ngulli bumulda, we (dual
inclusive) are beating. Ngeane bumulda, we (plural inclusive) are beating. It is
therefore evident that each tense form remains constant through all its own persons


and numbers. In these respects the Kamilaroi verb differs materially from the
Thurrawal and kindred tongues, in which there is a different verbal termination for
every person and number throughout each tense.
The auxiliary verb, gilla, has already been described in dealing with the
adjectives. The moods, tenses, and some of the numerous modifications of verbs
will be gathered from the following conjugation of the transitive verb “ to beat or
strike.” The present tense will be given in full, but in the past and future, the first
person only will be taken.

Ist Person
These five variations of the verb are repeated for each of the two remaining
persons of the singular, for all persons of the dual, and for all the persons of the
plural, by merely substituting, in succession, the requisite pronouns, nginda, nguru,
ngulli, and so on. See table of pronouns.
Future Tense.
Singular, f I will beat presently ...
Ist Person \ 1 wiU beat to - morrow ...

and so on through all the persons and numbers. It will be observed that the
pronoun ngaia becomes ngaiala in the future tense.


Imperative Mood—Present Tense.
Singular ... Beat thou ... ... ... Nginda bumulla.
Dual .., Beat you ... ... ... Ngindale bumulla.
Plural ... Beat you ... ... ... Ngindai bumulla.
The negative form is: —
Singular ... Beat thou not ... ... ... Kurriandu bumulla.
Dual ... Beat you not ... ... ... Kurriandale bumulla.
Plural ... Beat you not ... ... ... Kurriandai bumulla.
also, Kurriaguil bumulla, do not continue to beat, or cease beating.

Singular ... Let him beat ... ... ... Nguruwunna bumulli.
Dual ... Let them beat ... ... ... Nguruiounnagale bumulli.

may be). Ngulli gurri bumunnami , we, (dual inclusive) may as well also beat (him.
etc).

Imperative Mood.
2nd Person Beat thou thyself. Nginda bumaingilia. The negative is,

Reciprocal.—There is a reciprocal form of the verb in the dual and plural.
Present ... We are beating each other ... Ngulli bumidlela.
Past ... We beat each other ... ... Ngulli bumulluh.
Future ... We will beat each other ... Ngulli bumulle.
Various shades of meaning are obtained by modifications of the verb, and by
additional words, of which the following are a few examples:—
I beat again, Ngaia bumulluih.
I will beat (after some event), llanu ngaia bumadliiale.
Beat first (before some event), Bumunummia wurrea.
I will continue beating, Ngaiala bumidde yuggaduddlia.
Beat again, Yalu bumaluia.
Beat on behalf of another, Bumullandhummi.
I am beating long, Guril ngaia bumulda.
I beat severely, Bumba ngaia bumulngen.
If a man or any living creature be lying, say, on the ground, the natives use
babilla, but if the object lying be inanimate, they express it by uhla. For example,
Ngaia babilla, lam lying. Burran uhla, a boomerang lies.
Some verbs can take terminations expressing the dual and plural, thus:—
Bumullainyillila, which means that a couple of persons are doing the beating.
Bumullabuldha, shows that several are beating.
Yannungillawan, two walking. Yannawdbalan, several walking.
Gwallingillila, two persons talking. Gwallawabuldha, several persons talking.
Babingillila, two lying. Babiabiddha, several lying.
Ngurringillila, two sitting. Ngurriabuldha, several sitting.
Bundar ngaia ngunimi, I saw a kangaroo. Buridbu ngindaiyu yannawa
ngummillindhai, all of you go and see.
There is no form for the passive voice, but its place is supplied by changing the
sentence from the passive to the active form; thus, “ A woman was stung by a
scorpion,” would be expressed, “ A scorpion stung the woman.” This example also
shows how a sentence which comes under the ablative case in English, is expressed
in Kamilaroi by means of the accusative.
Prepositions.
In front, wurre. Behind, boadhe. At my camp, ngar ngaiaga wullaidlia.
Between two trees, dhului bulari biddhundi. Mulandha buggadha, the other side of
the river. Ngurealino buggadhi, this side of the river. Iri ngaia dhai buggadhi
bar in, from the other side the river I crossed over. Ngaia yudile wuruh , I went

Conjunctions.
Conjunctions are few and unimportant. Yamma and yelle appear to have the
sense of “ if.”
Note. —lt should perhaps be mentioned that in all the expressions illustrating
the several grammatical cases in the Kamilaroi and other languages herein described,
the demonstrative pronouns are purposely omitted, for the two-fold object of saving
space, and avoiding contusion by introducing any more words than the sentence
really required. For example, where I have given" Murridu mindere kauai ” (man


at padamelon threw), would be expressed by the black fellow : “ This man-in-front
at yonder-on-left padamelon threw,” or as the subject might require.
These remarks apply to every example of aboriginal sentences throughout the
several languages contained in this article.
The Yauan, or Mystic Language.
In a former communication, in 1896, I mentioned the existence, among the
Wiradthuri tribes, of a secret language, known only to the initiated. 1 The
Kamilaroi likewise possess a mystic tongue, called Yauan, which is inculcated at
the Bora ceremonies.
It is difficult to assign a reason for this language, because it is never used in
the presence of women or children, but is spoken exclusively by the men when
carrying out the ceremonies of initiation. It is possibly a typical remnant of the
language of earlier or conquering tribes in the remote past; and whether this be so
or not, its preservation is of the utmost importance to the ethnologist and linguist.
At present I shall offer only a limited number of words and expressions, but
on a future occasion I hope to treat the matter more fully. The following are a few
representative words and phrases:—

Wallarai, Wirraiarai, and Guinbrai Dialects.
The-Wirraiarai and Wallarai are neighbouring tribes adjoining the Kamilaroi
towards the north. The Guinbrai tribe is located about Gunnedah. By personal
investigation among the natives of each of these tribes I have satisfied myself that
the grammatical structure of their language is the same as that of the Kamilaroi of
which they are merely dialects. Their rules for the declension of nouns and adjectives
are substantially the same ; their pronouns and verbs are inflected in a similar
manner; their modes of dealing with the other parts of speech are equally concordant.
Some of the words of their vocabulary are almost identical, whilst many are quite
different. The following are a few examples in each dialect, by which it will be
seen that their grammar is practically a repetition of the Kamilaroi.
Wallarai Dicdect. — Wed, no. Yo, yes. Din, a man. Inar, a woman. Birrai,
a small boy. Miai, a little girl. Gui, an opossum. Gui yerragurai, a male opossum.
Gui gunidher, a female opossum. Den bural, a large man. Din yambuli, a very big
man. Dingu burrallu burran, a big man’s boomerang. Inane burallu kannai, a big
woman’s yamstick.
Wirraiarai Dialed. — Wirra, no. Yo, yes. Bundar a kangaroo; bundar bular,
a couple of kangaroos; bundar biinlaba, several kangaroos. Mai, a man. Mugga,
an opossum. Buruma, a dog. Mai bunal, a big man. Maidhu bunalu mugga bumi,
a big man an opossum struck. Burumo mugga buhe, a dog bit an opossum. Bundaru
guldwan, the kangaroo jumps. Maigu bunalu burr an, a big man’s boomerang.
Guinbrai Dialect. — Guin, no. Yo, yes. Giwir, a man. Inar, a woman. Bundar,
a kangaroo. Gui, an opossum. Gunnai, a yamstick. Gulir, a spouse. Bumai, a
boomerang. Wallumbun, a padamelon. Burrai, a wallaby. Bumaiba ngai, boomerang
mine. Gulira ngai, wife mine. Gunnaiba ngai, yamstick mine.


I have not thought it necessary to give examples of the verbs or pronouns in
these three dialects since, as already stated, they are similar to the Kamilaroi.
The Darkinung Language.
The Darkinung speaking people adjoined the Kamilaroi on the south-east and
occupied a considerable range of country in the counties of Hunter, Northumberland
and Cook, extending from Wilberforce and Wiseman’s Ferry on the Hawkesbury
river, to Jerry’s Plains and Singleton on the Hunter, and including the basins of
the Colo and Macdonald rivers, Wollombi Brook and other streams. On the south
they were met by the Gundungurra and Dharruk tribes, whose languages have
been reported by me elsewhere. 1
A detailed account of “ The Burbung of the Darkinung Tribes ” was contributed
by me to the Royal Society of Victoria in 1897 3 —the first and only report extant of
their initiation ceremonies. Their division into four intermarrying sections and
their laws of descent were dealt with by me in a communication to the Koyal
Society of New South Wales in 1897. 3
It is hoped that the following abstract of the Darkinung grammar will be
found of interest and value, because it shows affinities with the Kamilaroi on the
one side, and with the Dharruk on the other. The information was obtained by
me by personal inquiries among the few old natives who still speak their own
dialect.
Nouns.
Number. —Nouns have the singular, dual and plural numbers. Mirri , a dog;
mirribulla, a couple of dogs; mirribin, several dogs.
Gender. — Kuri, a man; nukung, a woman; wungara, a boy; mirkan, a girl
The gender of animals is indicated by an additional word— gaual for the male, and
nguppal denoting the female, thus, kuluwan gaual, a male native bear, and kuluwan
nguppal, a female;
Case. —The nominative has two forms, one of which merely names the subject,
as nukung, a woman; kuri, a man; girribil, an opossum ; barkan, a boomerang.
The other form represents the subject in action, as, ftukungga wnkknr nianai, the
woman a perch caught. Kuria, gujagang buhbai, the man a child beat. Girribilla
<jirrang bondalitti, the opossum is eating leaves. It will be observed that the
suffixed particle varies with the termination of the word to which it is attached.
The accusative. The foregoing three examples likewise serve to illustrate the
accusative case, showing that it is the same as the simple nominative.
Instrumental. When an instrument is used in the action described in the
1 “The Gundungurra Language,” Journ. Roy. Soc. N.S. Wales, vol. xxxv, pp. 151—155-
*‘Tlie Dharruk Language and Vocabulary,” op. cit., pp. 155-160.
2 Proc. Roy. Soc. Victoria , vol. ix, new series, pp. 1-12.
3 Journ. Roy. Soc. NS. Wales, vol. xxxi, pp. 170-171.


verb, a suffix is required, as, kuria barkanda binggibai, the man a boomerang
threw.
The possessive. Nukunggai gunnai, a woman’s yamstick; kurigai barkan, a
man’s boomerang.
The dative. Ngurragu yanna , to the camp come.
The ablative. Ngurrabirrang warri yanna, from the camp go away. Barkan
dutagurbirrang bungaiwa, a boomerang out of myrtle made I.
Adjectives.
An adjective takes the same inflections for number and case as the qualified
noun, which it follows.
Girribil dhnggang, an opossum large. Girribilla dimggangga girrang
bondalitti, a large opossum is eating leaves.
Possessive. Kurigai gulgiilgai barkan, a strong man’s boomerang.
The dative and ablative cases are expressed by means of their respective
suffixes applied to the adjective and noun.
The comparison of adjectives, and their inflection like intransitive verbs in
certain instances, are analogous to the Kamilaroi.
Pronouns.
Pronouns have number, person, gender and case, as in the following table of
pronouns in the nominative. They contain two forms of the first person in the
dual and plual numbers.
' Ist Person ... I ... Ngaia.
2nd „ ... Thou ... ... Nginda.
Smgular He Nym .
3rd „ ... She ... ... Nondwa
She Nondwa.
flat Person ... ( we ’ incl N^Uia '
J <- we, excl Ngungul
j 2nd „ ... you ... ... Bullabur
„ ... they ... ... Bulloara
Ngungullia.
Bulldbun.
Bulloara.
fist Person ...( we ’ incl N< > mn^
| t we, excl. ... ... Ngeangi
Pluial 2 n( j ... you ... ... Nyurafr
jjlrd „ ... they Gurigal
Ngeangwai.
Nyurabih.
Gurigalgang.
It will perhaps be sufficient to furnish the possessive and objective forms of
the singular number only, as under:—
Ist Person ... mine Jannunggai ... me ... Janna.
2nd „ ... thine Nginnunggai. ... thee... Nginna.
3rd „ masc. ... his ... Noanggai. ... him ... Nana.
3rd „ fem. ... hers ... Nonanggai. ... her ... Nonoan.


There are other terminations, indicating “to me,” “ with me,” etc. See also the
verbal suffixes.
I was unable to discover any forms for the feminine in the third person of
the dual and plural pronouns—an additional word distinguishing the gender being
employed.
Interrogatives. Ngan, who (singular) ? Nganbidla, who (dual) ? Nganbin,
who (several) ? Nganda, who (did it) ? Ngannunggai, whose (is this) ?
Nganwurribirrang, who from ?
Meing, what ? Meingga, what (did it) ? Meinggu, what for ? Menyan, how
many ? Mimbai, what is the matter ?
Demonstratives. Dhi, this. Dhale, that. There are several variations of
these, according to their position in regard to the speaker.
Verbs.
Verbs have the same moods and tenses as the Kamilaroi. The form of the
verb remains constant throughout each tense, the person and number being shown
by a suffixed particle in the singular, and by a fitting pronoun in the dual and
plural, as in the following conjugation of the verb bonda, to eat.
Indicative Mood. Present Tense.
lst Person ... I eat ... Bondalittiwah.
2nd „ ... Thou eatest Bondalittiwi.
Singular g r( j „ masc. He eats ... Bondalittinoa.
„ fem. She eats ... Bondalittinonda,
Dual. Ist person we, inch, eat, Ngullia ,bondalitti, and so on through the
remaining persons, by taking the suitable pronoun from the table of pronouns given
in an earlier page.
Plural. Ist person we, inch, eat, Ngeang bondalitti, and so on for all the
persons, as in the dual.
Past Tense.
Singular ... I ate Bondaiwah.
Dual' ... we, inch, ate ... ... Ngidlia bondai.
Plural ... we, inch, ate Ngeang bondai.
Future Tense.
Singular ... I will eat ... .... ... Bon damn ttiwa It.
Dual ... we, inch, will eat ... ... Ngidlia bondamutti.
Plural ... we, inch, will eat Ngeang bondamutti.
All the persons of the past and future tenses can be supplied by following the
rules stated under the present tense. The pronominal suffixes— wah or bah, wi,noa
and nonda —given in the singular number of the present tense, are also used in the
singular number of the past and future.


Imperative Mood.
Singular ... 2nd Person ... Eat thou ... Bondawi.
Dual ... „ ... Eat you ... Bonda bullabun.
Plural ... „ ... Eat you ... Bonda nyurdbih.
The negative consists of adding the word bdndi after the verb, as, bondawi
Mndi, eat thou not. The conditional mood, the middle voice, modifications of the
verb to express various shades of meaning, etc., are passed over.
The verb “to be ” has its equivalent in the word guyung, which may be used
with either an adjective or suitable adverb as a predicate, thus, I am good, I am here,
etc. Good am I, yutta guyungbali. Good I was, yutta guyungbaiwah. Good will
be I, yutta guyungbaimbah. The other persons and numbers can be supplied in the
manner already explained in the conjugation of the verb “ to eat.”
In the last example, and in many other words, the pronominal suffix wah is
changed to ball for the sake of euphony, according to the termination of the word
with which it is used.
Adverbs.
Yes, nge. No, warpai. Now, wirrai. Soon, gubbo. By and bye, gubbowarraiu .
A long time, guruwurrung. Always, gurain. Yesterday, burpindu. Morning,
burpingal. Evening, warragal. To-morrow, burning.
Where, wdng ? Where is the camp, wdmbi ngurra ? Where from, wdnhirrung ?
Where is he, wdngwurrai ? How, yalingawai ? When, warrunga ?
Slowly, warral. Quickly, ngdt. Badly, gujalang. Often, guraindya.
Here, diang. There, diwunnia. Far away, wurri. Yonder, gauinda. Hither,
dengtain.
Prepositions,
Around, warwargutti. Between, willigoa. To go over, kulliwai. On, or on
top of, a hill, garru bulpoa. Over, or on other side of, a hill, gullaiaba bulpoa.
Inside, guri. Outside, bukkawa. In front, warrukun. Behind, wallung. In the
midst, dhuluga.
Interjections.
Mali! calling attention. Gwak! take care. Yappal! exclamation of sorrow.
Numerals.
One, wakul. Two, bulla. Several, gurai.
Conclusion.
In the foregoing pages I have endeavoured to record and preserve the grammatical
elements of some of the most important aboriginal languages of New South Wales.

1 Journ.
Roy. Roc. iV.S. Wales, vol. xxxv, p,
When first entering upon this work it was found to posses no literature beyond a
few meagre vocabularies, and all my information had to be obtained orally from
the natives by visiting them at their camping places. The whole of this work has
been done by myself alone, without the assistance of any person, either in collecting
the vocabularies or in preparing the grammars. It is perhaps too much to expect
that the details of so many languages and the materials of three vocabularies should
be free from omissions and mistakes, especially when the immense geographic area
dealt with is taken into consideration.
Now that I have overcome the initial difficulties of laying down the elements
■of several aboriginal tongues, the further study of Australian languages will be
rendered comparatively easy to other investigators.
In the following vocabulary, containing about 900 words, I have given the
English in the first column, and have grouped together words of the same character
as the human body, inanimte natural objects, different animals, and also adjectives
and verbs. The Thurrawal equivalents of the Kamilaroi are supplied in the third
column to facilitate comparisons in both languages. When I prepared my
article on the “ Thurrawal Language,” referred to in the opening paragraph, I had
not leisure to prepare a vocabulary of its words, 1 but have since completed that task,
and have therefore now incorporated it with the present work.
Every word of the Kamilaroi in this vocabulary, as well as every Thurrawal
word, has been taken down by myself alone, from the lips of the native speakers.

APPENDIX.
Some Native Tribes or Victoria.
All the languages of the native tribes of Fiastern Victoria, although quite
different in vocabulary, are the same in grammatical constitution as the Thurrawal
tongue, described by me in an article to the Royal Society of New South Wales. 1
The nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, etc., can be inflected for number
and person, as illustrated in the article referred to. There is a singular, dual and
plural number, with a double form of the first person of the two latter—one including
and the other excluding the party spoken to.
All the above remarks equally apply to the languages of that portion of Victoria
situated west of the 145th meridian of longitude, with the addition of a trial
number in all the parts of speech subject to inflection. The trial number, as
existing in the native languages of Victoria, is different in character to that observed
in some other countries. For example, in the New Hebrides the case endings of the
dual, trial and plural are independent, and differ from each other in form, as follows:
We (dual inclusive), akaijau. We (trial inclusive), akataij. We (plural inclusive),
akaija . 2
But among the Victorian tribes, the trial number is formed by adding another
oase-ending to that of the plural. For example, in the Tyattyalla, Tyeddyawurru and
Wuddyawurru languages,an additional ending, Kullik, is tacked on to the termination
of the suffix of the plural; thus : —We (plural inclusive), yurwengurrak. We, (trial
inclusive), yurwengurrakkullik, and so on. In the Thaguwurru and kindred tongues
the word baiap is substituted for kullik, but it is employed in precisely the same
manner—it is added to the suffix of the plural.
Indications of a trial number were noticed by the late Mr. Francis Tuck field*
in the pronouns of the Woddowro (Wuddyawurra) tribe, but its general application
to other parts of speech has not hitherto been reported.
In order to illustrate the Victorian trial, I will briefly introduce the conjugation
of the present tense of the verb ngurna, “ to sit,” through all its numbers:—
{lst Person ... I sit ... ... Ngurnabuinhan.
2nd „ ... Thou sittest ... Ngurnabuinliar.
3rd ~ ... He sits ... ... Ngurnabuinh.
Thou sittest ... Ngurnabuinliar.
He sits ... ... Ngurnabuinh.
f We, incl., sit ... Ngurnabuingul.
fist Person L We, excl., sit ... Ngurnabuingun.
Dual ...< 2 n d „ ... You sit ... ... Ngurnabuinbul.
L.Srd „ ... They sit... ... NgurnabuinbvMc
They sit... ... Ngurnabuinbullain.

\ We, excl., sit ... Ngurnabuingunninyu.
You sit ... ... Ngurnabuinhat.
They sit. . ... Ngurnabuinhur.
It may be stated that the Tyattyalla numerals are:—One, Jcaiup ; two, hulety .
The numerals of the Thaguwurru language are: —One, Jcdpthun ; two, bulabil.
For further information see my article on “ The Aboriginal Languages of
Victoria,” published in the Journal of the Royal Society of New South Wales,
vol. xxxvi, pp. 71-106.
Some Native Tribes of South Australia.
On the southern coast of South Australia there are a number of tribes, of
which the Bungandity is typical, whose speech is substantially the same in
grammatical structure as the Thurrawal, already referred to. In all the languages
of South Australia, from the Australian Bight to Port Darwin, I have ascertained
that there are two forms of the first person in the dual and plural, one of which
includes the person addressed and the other excludes him, a feature which has
not hitherto been reported in any of the native tongues of that State. These
forms are exemplified in the Bungandity verb: —
(We, inclusive, speak ... ... Lahrngul.
We, exclusive, speak , ... ... Lahrngull
Lahrngulla.
pi 1 r We, inclusive, sjieak ... ... Lahrne.
1 We, exclusive, speak ... ... Lcihrnu
Lakrnunne.
Similar forms occur in the pronouns and other parts of speech subject to
inflection, but as I am preparing a grammar and vocabulary of the Bungandity
language, no more will be said upon the subject at present.
Some Native Tribes of Queensland.
In all the languages of Queensland which I have yet personally investigated,
the double “we” in the first person of the dual and plural is persistent; a
peculiarity which was reported by me for the first time in my grammar of the
“Murawarri and other Languages,” published in the Queensland Geographical
Journal, vol. xviii, pp. 52-68.
Most of the native tongues of Queensland closely resemble in general
structure the Kamilaroi and Darkinung languages treated in the present article,
although differing altogether in vocabulary.
In conclusion I beg to express my best thanks to the Anthropological
Institute for affording me the opportunity, before it is too late, to preserve some
grammatical records of the speech of the Australian aborigines.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF GREAT BRITAIN
AND IRELAND.
This Institute was established in 1871 by the amalgamation of the older
Anthropological Society and Ethnological Society. It has for its object the
promotion of the Science of Mankind—Anthropology—by the accumulation of
observations bearing on man’s past history and present state in all parts of the
globe. It investigates, in a rigorously exact manner, everything that can throw
light upon the laws of man’s nature: his origin, history, and capabilities of
progressive development and civilisation. It studies him structurally and
psychologically, under the several types in which he is found in various regions;
and comparatively, in relation to the rest of the animal kingdom. The ultimate
object of the Institute, therefore, is to build up a Science of Man on a basis of
well-ascertained fact, and logically deduced inference. As means to this end, the
Council of the Institute has adopted a plan of operations, the principal heads of
which are as follow:
1. Meetings for the reading of papers and for discussion of anthropological
questions.
2. The issue of a Journal containing Reports of the Proceedings at the
Meetings, with other matters of anthropological interest.
3. The appointment of Local Correspondents in all parts of the world
to collect information, and to aid the Institute in its operations.
4. The maintenance of a library, which contains sets of all the principal
Anthropological Journals published in the United Kingdom or
elsewhere, besides a large and valuable collection of books of
reference, travels and researches, an extensive collection of photo-
graphs and lantern slides, and much unpublished material for the
, use of students of Anthropology. Fellows residing in the country, as
well as in London, can borrow books from the library.
6u The appointment of Committees to conduct special investigations, as
occasion offers, in the various branches of Anthropology.
6. Co-operation with the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
and with foreign scientific societies in anthropological investigations;
co-operation with individuals and institutions in aid of explorations
and in the establishment of local centres of anthropological study;
and, generally, the stimulation of individual and local efforts to further
the objects of the Institute.
The annual subscription is Two Guineas, which is due on election (unless
such election takes place in the month of November or December) and on the Ist
of January in each succeeding year. A Member may at any time compound his
future subscriptions by the payment of £2l.
, Persons who wish to become Fellows of the
Institute are requested to communicate with the
Secretary, 3, Hanover Square, W.
