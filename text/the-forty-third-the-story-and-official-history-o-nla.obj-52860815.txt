FOREWORD
BY
BRIGADIER-GENERAL JAS. H. CANNAN, C. B., C.M.G., D.S.O.
It is right and fitting that the memory of those who have paid
the supreme sacrifice should be commemorated by some valuable
reference such as this historical record of the doings of the 43 rd
Battalion.
The heroic doings of the Australians generally have been
recognised throughout the world, but Australian soldiers are very
loath to expound their own personal efforts and gallantry. This
work w iH> therefore, open channels of thought and conversation
that will always serve to help the friends and relatives of these
soldiers of the 43rd Battalion to hear some of their individual deeds
of gallon r
The names of Messines, Warneton, Passchendale, Amiens,
Hamel, Mericourt-Sur-Somme, Haut A Haines, and The Hinden-
burg Line will ever be alive in the memory of the members of
this magnificent Battalion from South A ustralia. I will always be
grateful for the loyalty and assistance I received from the Officers,
N.C.O.’s, and men of the 43rd Battalion throughout the four
years 1916-1919. They have played a noble pari in victory for
Freedom of the British Empire, which I feel certain will be fully
acknowledged by the readers of this book-
JAS. H. CANNAN,
Brigadier - General.




INTRODUCTION.
This book contains the plain story of a South Austra-
lian Battalion that, during the Great War, now happily
over, in common with the forces of which it formed an
important part, helped to defeat a powerful enemy, to
redeem the devastated land of France, and to build up
for the Australian Imperial Forces an everlasting name.
The Battalion, with the exception of a few Western
Australians who came in as reinforcements, was drawn
from the youth of South Australia, and the memory of its
deeds will be cherished among those of the other gallant
units which were sent to the front from this State. This
narrative is written with the object of keeping the remem-
brance of those deeds fresh in the minds of those Avho
participated in them, and, at the same time, to provide a
permanent record of the achievements of the Battalion
for the general reader.
Only actual facts are chronicled. They have been set
down in chronological order while it is possible to main-
tain their full and correct sequence, and before they
become blurred in the memory. The design is to present
the movements and the exploits of the Unit as a whole.
The summary has been prepared at a sufficient distance
from the period of their happening to make it possible to
obtain a broad conception of the varied operations and
to view them all in their proper perspective.
To enable the ordinary reader to grasp with complete
understanding the vicissitudes of the Battalion in rest and
in action, maps copied from those actually used on the
battlefields have been introduced. There are also num-
bers of photographs of persons and scenes connected with
the operations. The various military cemeteries in which
the honoured dead have been laid to rest are also
indicated.


The Commanding Officer of the Battalion has written
an interesting and illuminating appendix, in which
special reference is made to some of the officers and men
who so nobly gave their lives in the service of their
country. He also pays tribute to other comrades whom
the Battalion holds in particular esteem.
The desire of the writers has been to provide a clear,
succinct, and reasonably complete record of the deeds of
the Battalion, and to do justice both to the gallant men
who survived and to those who have “gone West.” They
make no pretence to tine writing, but they have always
endeavoured to speak the truth and to do justice to their
brothers-in-arms, with whom they lived and fought for
so long in pride and confidence.
The compilers of this book were with the Battalion
from the date of its formation in Adelaide, and they
served with it in Prance until the Armistice was signed.
One of them was Adjutant during the last year of the
war, and the other was Intelligence Officer from October,
1917, to the end of the campaign. They therefore had
exceptional opportunities of obtaining the necessary
information for the compilation of the present record.

THE FORTY-THIRD BATTALION.
CHAPTER I.
THE FORMATION OF THE BATTALION.
Towards the end of 1915 it was decided by the
Australian Government to form a further Division in
Australia that was to be designated the 3rd and take
its place overseas with the other Australian troops during
1916. Of the fighting troops of this Unit South Australia
was to supply one Infantry Battalion, later known as
the 43rd.
Early in the year the men in the various camps were
speculating as to their chance of being drafted to this
new unit, but on March 7 all doubts were set at rest by
the appointment of Major, later Lieutenant-Colonel, D. D.
Gordon to command the Battalion, and the transfer to it
of 759 trainees then at Morphettville, where the racecourse
was allotted as the training camp until the departure from
Australia. Two days later the Machine Gun, Pioneers,
and Transport Sections were formed, non-commissioned
officers provisionally appointed, and a further draft
marched in, a portion of which comprised the Ist Rein-
forcements who remained with, and came under the
command of, the Battalion. On the 17th a Signal Section
was transferred from Mitcham, and on the 22nd the
Regimental Band was formed, the necessary instruments
being purchased from donations generously subscribed by
citizens of South Australia. The appointment of
Major C. P. Butler as Second in Command and twenty-two
company officers was published in Orders on the 25th,
eight more being added to this list on April 4, so that a
month after the formation the establishment was complete,
except that the non-commissioned officers were only pro-
visional until late in May. Throughout the balance of
April and May various changes were necessary on account
of sickness, etc., and the strength of the Battalion was
built up to its full establishment, completing an organisa-
tion that was to play a not insignificant part in the subse-
quent fighting on the fields of France and Belgium, and
earn the right to rank with those earlier battalions who
had already distinguished themselves on Gallipoli Penin-
sula and in France.

CHAPTER III.
TRAINING IN AUSTRALIA.
The bulk of the Battalion having been taken on
strength, the task of fitting and training them for service
overseas was soon enthusiastically undertaken. The
Morphettville Racecourse, which constituted the home of
the newly-formed unit, was admirably suited for such
purpose, the grandstands, together with the stables in the
rear, providing satisfactory sleeping quarters, with the
Orderly Room, Quartermaster’s Store, Officers ’ and Ser-
geants ’ Messes comfortably established in attached build-
ings and rooms beneath the stands, while the flat, with
the racecourse, offered excellent facilities for all parade
ground training. As the strength of the Battalion in-
creased and the first reinforcements were attached, the
erection of bell-tents was necessary to provide additional
quarters.
As the Battalion consisted of men who had but
recently enlisted, and were practically raw recruits, most
of whom had joined up in January and February, the
class of work given them embraced, at first, mostly squad
and close order drill, with attention to guards and general
military routine, the instructors being attached Common-
wealth Military Force officers and staff sergeant-majors.
As this elementary training tightened the discipline, open
order exercises and practice in visual training and judging
distance was introduced. Guard was mounted daily, and
a picquet appointed each night. Parade hours were from
7to 7.30 a.m., 9to 12.30, and 2 till 5, while an hour’s night
work was given twice a week. Saturday was a half-
holiday, general leave being granted from 1 p.m. till Sun-
day at 11 p.m.; for the balance of the week one company
per night was allowed out of camp.
Early in April musketry was commenced throughout
the Battalion, each section forming a separate squad and
undergoing ten days’ progressive instruction in the art of
handling the rifle, the course being completed by the firing
of an application and grouping practice on the. miniature
range in the dry bed of the Sturt River. An open range
was prepared in the sandhills between Glenelg and
Henley, where for two days portions of the Battalion were


engaged with the service rifle; but the working of these
targets proved so slow and tedious that arrangements
were made to secure the use of the butts at Port Adelaide,
special trains conveying the troops to and from this place.
Two complete days’ firing was given to each company,
during which grouping, application, snap shooting, and
rapid practices at 100, 200, and 300 yards were completed.
On April 20, Colonel Rankin, General Officer Com-
manding 11th Infantry Brigade, visited the Battalion,
which formed up in line for inspection by him; and about
a month later the Governor-General, Sir Ronald Munro
Ferguson, while reviewing the troops, addressed them,
referring to the action of the renowned 43rd Regiment
of the British Army and expressing hopes that the same
valour would be displayed by its corresponding unit in
the A.I.F.
Four days’ leave, known as “long leave,” commenced
on the 19th and embraced the Easter Holidays, this being
the last furlough granted prior to the Battalion’s
departure from Australia, the free wmek-ends still being
maintained, and to those living within thirty miles of
Adelaide, when desired, extended to Monday morning.
On the afternoon of May 3 the Battalion was ordered
to ‘ ‘ stand to ’ ’ awaiting further instructions, as trouble in
the German settlements was anticipated. Consequently,
all leave was cancelled, and no movement in or out of the
camp permitted. At dark fuller information was received,
and the Battalion assembled on the racecourse, was issued
with ammunition and rations, and, at 10 p.m., leaving the
camp in charge of a guard, marched out with full packs
along the Bay Road towards Adelaide. Advance and rear-
guards were thrown out to protect the column on the
move and all precautions taken to ensure secrecy. The
destination was unknown throughout the ranks, the
general belief being that the Battalion was to entrain;
but at 2 a.m. on the 4th the Exhibition Camp was entered
and a chance to sleep was given, the wearing of clothes
still being necessary as a further move was expected at any
hour. The silence maintained on the march proved that
the Battalion was capable of preserving the strictest of
discipline under abnormal circumstances.
On the 4th a practice attack was delivered via
Montefiore Hill against the Hindmarsh Bridge, a rest
being given during the afternoon, as the following day a
procession through the streets of Adelaide had been
arranged, the Battalion, with full marching order and 150
rounds of ammunition, taking a prominent part. No
instructions for a further move had been received, but
guards had been posted at the General Post Office and


Government House, and the Unit held in readiness to move
at a moment’s notice, leave not being permitted from the
camp. A short march and a rest in the Botanic Park was
given on the 7th, and on the Bth, which was a public
holiday, a few hours’ leave was granted to a small per-
centage during the afternoon.
Shortly after midday on the 9th the return march to
Morphettville was undertaken, the camp being reached
in time for tea, and a quiet evening expected, everyone
being very tired after the week’s movement. At 8 p.m.,
however, the alarm was sounded, companies falling in at
their respective posts in a very creditable time. As this
W’as only a practice, men were dismissed by 9 p.m. and the
camp was quiet.
On the 11th and 12th field firing schemes were carried
out in the sandhills near Glenelg, the result obtained
proving that the men were rapidly becoming war shots,
as the type of targets offered, and conditions of shooting,
closely resembled those to be expected in the field. The
later days of May were occupied with general schemes
including outposts, advanced, and rear guards; while in
the evenings marches were often made to Glenelg, the
men dismissed for two hours, then re-assembled and
marched back to camp. Instruction was also given on the
“siting” and consolidation of trenches, an island traverse
system being dug on the flat.
The Battalion attended a number of functions and
ceremonies, chief among which were the presentation of
colours at Glenelg, the Military Tattoo on the Jubilee
Oval, and the farewell dinner provided in the Exhibition
Building by the Cheer-up Society; while occasional trips
to the theatre were arranged, special trains usually being
provided for the conveyance of the Unit to and from
Morphettville. A certain amount of amusement was
supplied within the camp on several occasions by concert
parties.
• During the whole period of training, equipment and
clothing were gradually issued and troops fitted out for
departure, signing for every article received and having
numerous inspections to ascertain what shortages existed.
The health of the men also received continuous
attention, vaccination and two inoculations being admin-
istered in the early days, while dental inspections and sub-
sequent treatment rectified any defects of the mouth.
Shortly prior to sailing, a medical examination was under-
gone by all ranks, any unfit personnel being sent to
Mitcham. The general health had remained extremely
good throughout the three months’ training, one death
only having occurred.


The first week of June was spent in final preparations
to embark on the 9th, the quartermasters and clerical
departments being the most busily engaged. A final pay
was drawn and as much leave as possible granted: so that
by the Bth all preparations for embarkation had been
completed, and the transport section had left for the
Outer Harbour.
The various appointments held in the Battalion were
as follow:
Commanding Officer: Lieutenant-Colonel D. D.
Gordon.
Second in Command: Major C. P. Butler.
Adjutant: Captain H. B. Rowell.
Quartermaster; Lieutenant W. Clarke.
Machine Gun Officer; Lieutenant P. Osborne.
Company Commanders: (A) Major T. G. Heming,
(B) Captain E. P. Playford, (C) Captain W. J. Kinnish,
(D) Captain A. W. Lott.
Regimental Medical Officer: Captain A. H. Guymer.
Chaplain: Chaplain-Captain G. P. Cuttriss.
Regimental Sergeant-Major: Warrant Officer T. C.
Evans.
Regimental Quartermaster-Sergeant: Warrant Officer
G. S. Redsell.




S.S. “AFRIC,” TRANSPORT A19, WHICH CONVEYED THE BATTALION FROM AUSTRALIA TO EUROPE.


CHAPTER IV.
THE JOURNEY.
Dawn of June 9 was breaking behind the Mount Lofty
Ranges when reveille sounded, rousing the whole camp
to the activities of final preparations for departure, includ-
ing the handing in of camp equipment and stores. At
9.40 a.m. the first train, bearing Headquarters, A and B
Companies, left Morphettville Station for the Outer Har-
bour, followed half-an-hour later by a second train with
the remainder of the Battalion. On reaching Port
Adelaide the train proceeded by the old route down St.
Vincent Street, where a large and enthusiastic crowd
assembled to bid farewell to the unit. An hour later the
Outer Harbour was reached, and there followed a rapid
embarkation on board the s.s. “Afric” (“A 19”) a White
Star liner of 10,000 tons.
The Battalion Transport, which moved by road from
Morphettville the previous day, was already on board,
awaiting the Companies, who on arrival filed to their
respective quarters, A and D Companies forrard, C Com-
pany forrard amidship, officers and sergeants aft amid-
ship, and B Company aft. Each man was allotted his
position, equipment and kitbags dumped, and the troops
were then free to go on deck to receive the farewell greet-
ings of friends and relatives, who had gathered on the
wharf. Never in the history of the State had so large a
crowd assembled to witness the departure of a boat.
Hundreds of coloured streamers soon linked up the soldiers
on board with the crowd on the wharf, the intermingling
of colour presenting a spectacle long to remain in the
memories of those present.
At 2 p.m. the steamer moved from the wharf, and
many on board realised that this was the commencement
of the long, long trail, the end of which none could foretell.
On board, in addition to the Battalion, was the 25th
Company of A.A.S.C., under command of Captain Car-
stairs; the 3rd Australian Divisional Motor Transport
Company (Major Lyons), and a small party of the 11th
Field Ambulance, under Captain Love, making a total of
approximately 1,700 troops on the boat. Cooking for the
officers and sergeants was arranged by the crew, while


the balance was conducted by Company cooks, who at first
experienced difficulty in accustoming themselves to cook-
ing by steam.
The journey through The Bight was cold and rough,
causing sickness to 70 per cent, of the men. Land was
first sighted at daybreak of June 13, and after passing
through King George Sound the boat anchored in
Albany Harbour at 11.30 a.m., when coaling immediately
commenced. The next day the boat drew alongside the
wharf, and all were allowed ashore for a few hours, and
were able from the high ground to view the picturesque
surroundings of the harbour and town. At noon the same
day the journey was resumed, and soon the shores of
homeland receded from view. That night it was learnt
that the next port of call would be Colombo. As the
result of a long period of calm weather that followed the
departure from Albany, it was possible to conduct train-
ing, consisting of musketry, physical exercises, bayonet
fighting, and boat drill, limited in extent by the small area
of deck space available. In addition, lectures were given
to officers and non-commissioned officers on subjects of
military value, while boxing tournaments, deck sports,
and concerts were arranged at frequent intervals, and
leisure hours were occupied with reading, writing, and
cards.
As the tropics were approached, permission to sleep
on deck was granted, and a large majority availed them-
selves of the privilege. By day a minimum amount of
clothing was worn, the heavier uniform being abandoned
for the lighter and more comfortable suit of dungarees.
Early on the morning of June 26 the island of Ceylon
was sighted, and by 10 a.m. the transport anchored in the
harbour of Colombo. Coal barges were soon drawn along-
side the boat, and coaling operations, conducted by the
natives, commenced. That afternoon half the troops were
taken ashore on lighters, and marched to the military bar-
racks in Colombo. There a wet canteen was placed at the
disposal of the troops, and native vendors of views, fruit,
etc., offered their goods. As this was the first opportunity
for some weeks of purchasing articles from other than the
ship’s canteen a brisk business resulted.
The following morning the remainder of the troops
went ashore, returning in time to allow the journey to be
resumed at 3.45 p.m.
The voyage to Suez differed very little from the
previous fortnight, except that during the four days in the
Red Sea extreme heat was experienced, causing exhaus-
tion to several of the stokers, whose work was undertaken
for two days by volunteers from the troops. By noon of


July 11 Suez was reached, and all preparations for dis-
embarkation were completed. Orders were, however,
received from the military authorities that the journey
was to be continued through the Mediterranean, and at
4 p.m. an entrance was made into the Canal, the interest-
ing surroundings of which attracted attention for sixteen
hours. Along the bank were encamped Australian and
English troops, who formed a portion of the Canal Gar-
rison. An opportunity to converse with some of these was
afforded by the boat being delayed for an hour at Ismalia.
By 8.30 a.m. on the 12th the Canal was cleared and
entry made into Port Said, where a transport conveying
English troops southward was passed. Natives were
again employed in coaling, which caused much inconveni-
ence to those on board, as no leave ashore was granted.
Numerous hawkers in small dinghies visited the boat, but
not being allowed on deck were obliged to transact their
sales by means of rope and basket. Swimming, and watch-
ing the actions of the native coalers, hawkers, and police,
helped to pass the unpleasant hours of waiting. A 4.7
naval gun was mounted aft and manned by Royal Navy
gunners, and on departure at 2 p.m. on the 13th, H.M.
destroyer “Telmar,” which had seen service with the
Australians on Gallipoli, acted as escort. These protective
measures against submarines were augmented by the pre-
cautions of constant changes of course, screening of lights,
and increase of sentries, whose duty was the outlook for
enemy craft.
On passing Malta, the “Telmar” was relieved by a
larger destroyer, but before departing semaphored “Aus-
tralians, good-bye and good luck,” on receipt of which
cheers were interchanged between transport and escort.
Daily routine on board continued until Marseilles was
approached on the evening of July 19, when at 10 p.m.
the pilot was taken aboard, but the harbour was not
entered until eight o’clock the next morning. This ended
a six weeks’ successful journey on the “Afric,” during
which time no incidents of great importance occurred.
The general health throughout was very satisfactory,
the sole epidemic (measles) affecting but a small per-
centage of those on board. On June 30 the only death
occurred, and the burial with military honours took place
at sea.
At 3 p.m. on July 20 the Battalion disembarked and
moved to Arran-Point Station, where it immediately
entrained, and at 5.35 p.m. left for Havre. This train
consisted of second and third class compartments, holding
from six to eight men. The journey through Southern


France was most interesting, new types of villages, culti-
vation, and railway organisation being introduced. The
scenery, especially that of the Rhone Valley, was superb,
and the bright midsummer day showed the surroundings
at their best. A halt was made near Avignon, where hot
tea and rations were issued, and on resumption of the
journey the troops quickly settled down for the night. At
8 a.m. on the 21st the train passed through Lyons, and at
3.45 p.m. Dijon was reached, and the French Red Cross
workers served tea and cake to the Battalion. Breakfast
next morning was partaken of thirteen miles from Paris,
Juvisy, from which, after a halt of two hours, the journey
continued through Versailles, along the Seine Valley to
Nantes, where a break was made for another meal, thence
to Rouen and Havre. Here the Battalion detrained and
marched to a Rest Camp, where most of the men spent a
cold night on cobbles. The following afternoon embark-
ation for England took place, and at dusk the Channel
transport commenced its six-hour journey, reaching South-
ampton at daybreak, disembarkation following at 7.30
a.m. After two hours 7 waiting on the wharf the troops
entrained, and at 11 a.m. arrived at Amesbury Station on
Salisbury Plain, where the Battalion detrained. An hour
later Lark Hill was reached, and the whole afternoon
devoted to settling down in No. 12 Camp. This was the
training area for the 43rd Battalion prior to its departure
for the front.




43RD BATTALION OFFICERS, RAMBURELLES, JANUARY, 1919.


CHAPTER V.
TRAINING IN ENGLAND.
The first few days were spent in settling down in this
new camp, which was one of about fifty of similar design
located at Lark Hill, most of which were so fitted as to
accommodate a complete battalion. The unit’s new home
consisted of three huts for officers and thirty for other
ranks, these forming the sleeping quarters, and were laid
out in four-Company groups, each hut being fitted with
electric light and a stove, and capable of housing thirty-
two men, on bunks slightly raised from the floor by means
of trestles, and made comfortable by the provision of straw
palliasses. For messing, two large halls, furnished with
tables and forms, seated the whole of the Battalion, the
cooking being conducted in a kitchen situated between the
two mess rooms. Ablution sheds were positioned in each
company’s lines, and hot-and-cold showers proved a great
boon after* heavy day’s work. Additional buildings were
used and specially fitted for officers’ and sergeants’ messes,
orderly room, Quartermaster’s store, miniature rifle
range, stables, guard and drying rooms, while a wet and
dry canteen established in the large recreation hut com-
pleted a well-laid-out camp.
The 41st, 42nd, and 44th Battalions, who, together
with the 43rd, comprised the four chief units of the 11th
Brigade, occupied surrounding camps, whilst the first
reinforcement, which had accompanied the Battalion over-
seas, was positioned at Rollestone.
Ample entertainment was catered for by the numerous
theatrical companies, concert troupes, and cinema shows,
while Church Army and Y.M.C.A. huts, warm and well lit,
were equipped with indoor games, and also afforded
excellent writing and reading facilities. The villages of
Amesbury, Durrington, Bulford, and Shrewton were
within comfortable walking distance, and were visited
after parade hours, while a stroll to Stonehenge or the
Chestnut Tree at Figheldean, mentioned in “The Village
Blacksmith,” was a popular means of spending a quiet
afternoon. A small percentage of week-end leave to
Salisbury, London, and Bath was granted, men departing
from camp at midday on Saturday and returning early on
Monday morning.


Training hours were from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. on
week days, and from 8.30 to 12.30 on Saturdays, with half-
an-hour’s physical training before breakfast; this early
parade was abandoned in October, on account of the
approach of winter.
The work for the first few weeks consisted chiefly of
platoon and company training, parade ground drill, and
short route marches, while individual instruction of Lewis
Gunners, Signallers, and Scouts was given by specialist
officers. The first large parade was held on Sunday, July
30, when the 3rd Division assembled for a church service,
a march past the General Officer Commanding, Major-
General John Monash, C. 8., V.D., taking place at the
conclusion.
A percentage of officers and non-commissioned officers
were sent to various military schools for the purpose of
gaining knowledge of the latest methods of warfare, and
so at the conclusion being better able to instruct their
platoons. Chief amongst these were:—Musketry at Hay-
ling Island and Tidworth; drill, at Chelsea; machine gun,
Grantham; signalling, Weymouth; bombing, Lyndhurst;
bayonet fighting and physical drill, at Aldershot and
Tidworth, and an aspirant officers’ course at Tidworth;
while a Lewis Gun School was established within the
Division at Lark Hill.
After close-order drill had been greatly improved and
specialists had undergone a revision of their courses, field
training and more extensive operations were commenced,
and the trench system at the Bustard, five miles distant,
was frequently utilised for instruction in trench warfare,
the night of August 31-September 1 being spent here to
enable night attacks to be introduced. On Saturday, Sep-
tember 16, para-typhoid inoculation was undergone, and
two days later the Battalion marched, via Stonehenge and
Shrewton to the Bustard, where at dusk a mock relief of
trenches was effected, and until the end of the week the
■whole of the 11th Brigade remained in and around these
trenches, returning to Lark Hill on the afternoon of the
23rd, after a Brigade assembly, at which Brigadier-General
J. 11. Cannan, C. 8., who had taken over from Brigadier-
General C. W. D. Rankin early in August, addressed the
units and emphasised the necessity for digging, advice
that proved so sound when active service was entered
upon. The object of the period spent here was to accus-
tom the men to the trench mode of living, and the Com-
pany and Battalion staffs to administration under such
conditions. The scheme was organised to resemble trench
life as near as possible, rations being brought to a forward
dump, from which they were carried to their respective


company cooks, and, when the meals had been prepared,
conveyed to the troops in the line by means of carrying
parties. Improvements within the trenches were effected
during the day, but at night working parties were em-
ployed above ground. Bays and posts were manned in the
front line, and scouts operated in No Man’s Land during
the hours of darkness. Telephonic communication was
established laterally and forward as far as company head-
quarters, while night raids and attacks were practised on
several occasions. An inter-battalion relief was carried
out late in the week, enabling the 43rd to withdraw to a
reserve position, consisting of a small tent encampment
about half-a-mile in rear of the trench system.
To still further accustom the troops to life in France,
a billetting scheme was arranged at West Lavington,
fifteen miles from the camp, where quarters for the night
were selected and companies allotted various areas, the
return to Lark Hill taking place next day.
Late in September, a four days’ progressive course of
range practices was fired at the rifle butts adjoining the
camp, a very high standard resulting throughout the
Battalion, being unequalled by any other unit within the
Brigade.
Arrangements had been made for His Majesty King
George V. to inspect the Australian troops at Lark Hill and
Bulford, to prepare for which an assembly was practised
on the 26th near Bulford Barracks, the review taking place
the following day, rain falling before the Battalion had
returned to its huts. Three days later divisional sports
were held, the Battalion being well represented and win-
ning several events.
In the early part of October the type of training
changed to frequent and extensive field operations, com-
bined with lengthy route marches, the ground utilised for
these schemes being chiefly in the vicinity of Orcheston
St. Mary; it mattered little what the weather conditions
were, the manoeuvres still eventuated. A type of the work
conducted on these days was an early breakfast, followed
by a march in full equipment until 10.30, when the train-
ing-ground would be reached, packs dumped, the day’s
work explained, and the operation attempted. A spell
wotild then be given for lunch, which was carried in the
haversack, and probably during the afternoon the scheme
again practised. Packs were then refitted and the return
made to camp. On one occasion an approach march to
this area was undertaken at night, followed at daybreak
by an open warfare attack, in which the four battalions
co-operated.


Towards the end of November, Avhen the units had
been fully equipped for overseas, a divisional march,
covering a distance of eighteen miles, was accomplished,
the full issue of clothing and equipment, less blankets,
being carried, the day proving most strenuous on account
of the oppressive heat.
From the arrival in England the standard of training
aimed at was very high, commencing with parade ground
and close-order drill, followed by trench life and attacks,
and culminating in field operations, during which a severe
hardening process was exercised by the inclusion of fre-
quent and lengthy route marches, the benefits of which
were not realised until the severe winter of 1916-17, which
none but fit troops could endure.
The weather experienced for the first ten weeks was
excellent, but during the latter portion of October and
the whole of November unsettled and rainy conditions
prevailed, causing the good health at first maintained to
deteriorate slightly and result in an outbreak of mumps
and measles.
Rationing was conducted on the English basis: bread,
meat, tea, salt, pepper, sugar, and bacon being a daily
issue, in addition to which s|d. per day per ration was
paid by the Government; but in spite of its judicious
expenditure in such extras as flour, vegetables, milk, fish,
dried fruits, etc., the standard was not equal to that
experienced in Australia, or later in France.
Apart from week-end leave, already mentioned, two
periods of from four to six days were granted to any part
of the United Kingdom, the first, soon after arrival at
Lark Hill, and the second, prior to the embarkation for
France.
During the first three weeks of November final pre-
parations and issue of equipment for the trip overseas
were completed, and the dates of departure of the Division
were expected to cover the last week of November, the
43rd Battalion eventually sailing on the 25th, prior to
which the camp was thoroughly cleaned and the bulk of
stores returned.




N.C.O'S, 43RD BATTALION, JANUARY, 1919.


CHAPTER VI.
DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND AND FIRST MONTH
IN FRANCE.
Reference Map: Hazebrouck 5a 1/100,000.
The early morning of November 25 was a repetition of
June 9. For the purpose of the move the Battalion was
divided into three parties, leaving Lark Hill Camp in time
to entrain at Amesbury Station by 7.15, 9.15, and 10.15
a.m. The weight of equipment carried by each man was
far in excess of that borne on any previous march, as in
addition to full marching order, two blankets, 150 rounds
of ammunition, with steel and gas helmets, made a burden
in all cases exceeding 80 lb. Thus the march to the train,
although downhill, proved most strenuous. Entrainment
and the journey to Southampton, the port of departure for
Havre, was uneventful; on detraining parties were de-
tailed for the loading of the boats, two of which were
allotted—one carrying transport, headquarters details and
a part of D Company, and the other the balance of the
Battalion. At dusk the trip across the Channel com-
menced, and a heavy sea was experienced, causing sea-
sickness to many on board, while a bleak wind with fre-
quent showers of hail made the entry into the harbour and
the period of waiting intensely cold.
Disembarkation and unloading commenced at 11 a.m.,
and during the afternoon there followed the memorable
route march to No. 1 Rest Camp, situated on a hill about
three miles from the wharf. Here the Battalion remained
for the night, leaving at 6.30 next morning for the railway
yards, where a troop train, consisting chiefly of cattle
trucks, was waiting, and at 11.30 left for Bailleul with
headquarters, B, C, and D Companies on board, followed
a few hours later by A Company. The journey, via
Rouen, Abbeville, Boulogne, Calais, and St. Omer, occu-
pied thirty hours, halts being made en route for the issue
of rations and hot drinks. Detraining was completed
before dark, but by the time the unit moved from the
station night had set in. For the march to billets, packs
and blankets were carried by motor lorry. Locating these
billets caused great difficulty, owing to the lack of inform-
ation and absence of guides, and it was not until after
10 p.m. that the men were settled for the night. Next




morning necessary alterations were effected, and a start
made on improvements. Headquarters, A, B, and C Com-
panies were scattered in farmhouses, while D Company
occupied huts, which were evacuated a week later in
favour of drier and warmer barns, close to Brigade head-
quarters, which was then located at Blanche Maison,
approximately in the centre of the Battalion area. This
was the introduction to the type of farmhouse common
throughout France—built in the form of a hollow square,
with living quarters, dairy, stables, and barn surrounding
a cesspit (the dump of stable refuse until required for the
fertilisation of the soil). The portions used for billeting
purposes were the barns, the available space depending on
the amount of harvest in store. About a mile and a half
from the Battalion was the town of Steenwerck, to which
leave was granted daily, and which became the chief
visiting place for the men after parade hours. The warmth
of fires in the Y.M.C.A., cafes and estaminets helped to
overcome the extreme cold that prevailed during the
period in this area.
As the 11th Brigade was the Reserve Brigade of the
3rd Australian Division, then holding the Armentieres
Sector, the Battalion was able to carry out a daily routine
of training from 9 a.m. till 4.30 p.m., consisting chiefly of
bayonet fighting, physical drill, and route marching, the
last-mentioned taking prominence as being the most effec-
tive means of keeping warm by day. During the milder
days, specialist training was undertaken and anti-gas drill
conducted with the box respirator, which had been issued
in France. On December 10 a party, consisting of three
officers and forty other ranks, was detached for a raiding
school at Armentieres, and on the 21st the Battalion took
its place in the Brigade for inspection by Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British
Forces in France.
A small percentage of officers and non-commissioned
officers reconnoitred the sector later held by the Battalion,
with the primary object of acting as guides had the unit
been brought into action from its reserve position.
On December 23, in a high wind and through heavy
rain, a march to new billets in Armentieres was carried
out, companies being located in separate warehouses in
Rue de la Gare, with Brigade Headquarters in Rue Strass-
burg. The Battalion, with the 44th, formed support to
the 41st and 42nd, then holding the line, the Brigade relief
having taken place on the 23rd. Christmas Day was cele-
brated, in the morning with working parties to the line,
and in the evening by a dinner, extra supplies being
obtained through Comforts and Regimental Funds.


The following day working parties for the line were
supplied, extensive reconnaissance of the sector under-
taken, and preparations made to relieve the 41st Battalion
on December 30.
The mumps epidemic that prevailed during the unit’s
latter weeks in England increased under the harder con-
ditions of living, but had by the end of the year practically
died out.




SERVING TEA IN THE ARMENBTIERES SECTOR.


CHAPTER VII.
TRENCH WARFARE.
Reference Maps: France, 28 and 36, 1/40,000.
With reveille at 2 a.m., breakfast disposed ot and
billets cleaned, the Battalion left for the line at 3.30.
After passing the Asylum, then used as a gum-boot store
and a Y.M.C.A., an entrance was made to Briekstaek Lane,
a duekboarded communication route, which derived its
name from a chimney-stack near by. Owing to falling
rain and intense darkness a tedious and difficult approach
was experienced, but an hour after leaving billets Square
Farm was reached 7 from which each company moved to
its own sector. For this, A and D Companies utilised
Lothian, B Central and C. Porte Bgal Avenues, relieving the
41st Battalion, who withdrew to Armentieres, and took up
the role of support to the Brigade. The sector, which
was flat and low-lying, necessitated breastworks, and ex-
tended from Pear Tree Farm on the right to Porte Egal
Farm on the left. It was divided into four, A Company
holding the right, D right centre, B left centre, C the left,
with Battalion Headquarters at Square Farm; while the
flanks were held on the right by the Tyneside Scottish and
on the left by the 44th Battalion. Companies, with one
platoon in the front line, one in supports, and two in sub-
sidiary, manned the three lines that formed the defensive
system of the sector, inter-platoon reliefs taking place
daily within each company. The front line was continu-
ous throughout, and consisted of a series of localities and
gaps, the former being held day and night with section
posts, and the latter patrolled regularly during the hours
of darkness. Heavy machine guns were positioned in
and around the supports, with field and heavy artillery
several thousand yards in the rear. An excellent system
of telephonic communication existed as far forward as the
headquarters of the companies, to which also was con-
nected a bell signal from the front line. On New Year’s
Eve a series of silent patrols acted along the Brigade front
with the object of entering the enemy’s line and securing
identification. The Battalion provided four of these, each
consisting of one officer, one sergeant, and twelve other
ranks, the officers being Lieutenants P. B. Wald, J. J.


Daley, K. C. Gunter, and F. G. Sims, while Captain H. S.
Cope commanded a reserve patrol, whose service was not
required. At 11.40 p.m. the parties moved into No Man’s
Land, which was two to three hundred yards wide, and
advanced towards the enemy lines, but owing to extreme
darkness and limited knowledge of hostile wire, the enter-
prise was unsuccessful. One casualty was sustained from
enemy machine gun fire. On the morning of January 6
the 41st Battalion relieved the 43rd in this sector, which
until early in March was held by these two battalions,
relief taking place every five or six days.
While in support in Armentieres, working parties
were sent to the line for eight hours daily, constructing
dugouts, wiring, and draining.
On the day preceding relief a percentage of scouts,
signallers, and Lewis gunners of the incoming battalion
took over their duties in the line for the purpose of
securing the latest information of enemy tactics. While
in the forward trenches the Battalion nightly carried out
wiring in No Man’s Land by parties of eight, protected
by a lying-up patrol; while from six to ten active patrols
of four to six operated along the sector each night. For
the feeding of the troops, rations were transported at dusk
from the Quartermaster’s Store in Armentieres to Square
Farm, from where company ration parties conveyed them
to their respective cookhouses, of which each company had
two, one providing for the garrisons of the front and
support lines, and the other for the subsidiary line. From
the forward cookhouse hot food was conveyed to the
advanced posts in thermos containers, thus enabling
everyone to obtain warm meals, so essential during the
extreme cold which prevailed during January and Feb-
ruary, when for weeks the ground remained frozen. In
addition to three meals a day, troops on night duty were
supplied with hot drinks or food at least twice nightly,
together with a small issue of rum, procured through the
Army Medical Corps.
On February 15, when the Battalion entered the line
for the fifth time, a three-company frontage was adopted;
the previous right centre, or Mushroom sub-sector, having
been heavily wired, was held with two posts only. Dis-
positions were thereby changed to: A Company, right; D
Company, centre; C Company, left; and B Company,
reserve behind A and D.
During the early part of the year the raiding school
continued training in bayonet fighting, physical exercises,
patrolling, study of aeroplane photographs, and practice
of raiding formations on dummy trenches.

On February 19 the raid on the enemy line was
launched from C Company’s sector, the party consisting
of Captain H. S. Cope (officer commanding raid), Lieu-
tenant R. C. Gunter (officer commanding assault), Lieu-
tenant W. D. Price (officer commanding enemy parapet),
and sixty other ranks, divided into nine parties for assault,
blocking, and demolition. At 9.30 p.m. the raiders moved
from the trenches to an assembly position in No Man’s
Land, the scouts having been first sent out to ascertain
if the intended point of entry, a gap in the enemy’s wire,
was still open. The assembly was completed without
difficulty, as everyone concerned knew that sector well,
having reconnoitred it previously under Scout Healey.
Lewis gun teams from shell holes protected the flanks
of the operation.
At 10 p.m., zero hour, the barrage opened on the
enemy front line, where it played for four minutes, then
lifted to form a box to protect the party which entered
the German trenches.
While this entry was being effected, the counter
barrage commenced, falling into No Man’s Land and
causing casualties.
At this stage Lieutenant W. D. Price was wounded and
Lieutenant Gunter assumed command of the operation in
the enemy lines.
The various sections under their non-commissioned
officers carried out their allotted tasks, penetrating as
deeply as the support line; but the enemy was not
encountered.
A concrete dugout believed to have contained Boche
was discovered, but owing to casualties in the demolition
party an entrance could not be forced. At 10.30 p.m. the
signal to withdraw having been given, the trenches were
evacuated and the task of carrying back wounded pro-
ceeded, the last case being brought in at 11.30 p.m., the
mud caused by the recent thaw making this duty most
arduous.
The wounded received medical treatment at a for-
ward Regimental Aid Post in support line, from
where they were evacuated by truck and ambulance

defences by the heavy barrage; while three rifles and two

On March 6 the Battalion’s last exit from Armentieres
Sector took place, and after three days working parties
and three days training, it moved to Le Bizet, two miles
from Armentieres and situated on the Franco-Belgium
Border. On the 13th B and D Companies relieved the
Ist Auckland Battalion in the Le Touquet Sector and came
under command of the New Zealand Brigade until the
following day, wdien A and C Companies relieved the Ist
Wellingtons, the command of the sector, which extended
from the River Lys northwards to the River Warnave,
then passing to the 43rd Battalion. The defences of this
sector differed very little from those of Armentieres,
except on the right flank, where the low-lying ground on
the northern bank of the Lys did not permit of a trench
system. Posts were therefore established at Tool House
and Lys Farm to cover this area. No Man’s Land varied
in depth from 1,000 yards on the right, flooded during
winter, to 50 in the centre, widening again to 300 on the
left.
The trenches were in a bad state of repair, many
being waterlogged and unrevetted, thereby requiring a
considerable amount of attention. For defence a Three-
Company Sector was adopted. A Company right, B
centre. D left, with C in reserve at Gunner Farm and
Tancrez Cottages and Battalion Headquarters at Surrey
Farm.
Up to April 5, when the Battalion was relieved by the
Wiltshires, and moved to Oosthove Farm, it twice held the
line and was once in support to the 41st. From the 6th to
the 18th it occupied this farm and hutments in the
vicinity and was daily engaged in the construction of gun
positions and communications, later used in the Messines
attack. On the evening of the 18th the Battalion moved
to Ploegsteert AYood, relieving the 42nd, then in support
to the St. Yves Sector, and taking over the front line
early next morning from the 41st, who then moved back
to the "wood. This new sector extended from Lowndes
Avenue on the right to Donnington Hall on the left.

Battalion Headquarters were situated at Hope Farmhouse,
while companies were disposed—D right, opposite the
“Bird Cage” and in touch with the 44th Battalion
on the south; C right centre, “St. Yves”; A left
centre and B left, joining up with the New Zealanders,
who w T ere holding opposite Messines. Ten days were
spent here, during which time heavy artillery and trench
mortar fire was experienced, the opposing troops (3rd
Bavarians) proving more aggressive than those encoun-
tered in Armentieres and Le Touquet. On the night of
the 28th-29th the 39th Battalion relieved the 43rd, who
then moved to Rue de la Gare Armentieres preparatory to
marching to back areas.
Thus ended the first phase of the Battalion’s life in
the field.
The general health during these four months’ con-
tinuous trench work remained excellent, although the cold
was far more severe than that ever experienced in Aus-
tralia; and this physical fitness was undoubtedly the
outcome of the hard training undergone in England.
The following important promotions and changes
took place:—Lieutenant-Colonel D. D. Gordon returned
to Australia for duty; Major C. P. Butler assumed com-
mand, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel; Captain
W. J. Kinnish was promoted to Major and appointed
Second in Command; Captain H. E. Rowell was transferred
to the 6th Division, the appointment of Adjutant passing
to Lieutenant M. Denniston, later promoted to Captain;
Captain A. W. Lott promoted to Major.
Award.
Apart from the decorations won in the raid, Lance-
Corporal W. T. L. TREMBATH was awarded the M.M.


CHAPTER VIII.
PREPARATION FOR MESSINES.
Eeference Maps: Hazebrouck, sa, 1/100,000; Calais, 13, 1/100,000;
France, 28 and 36, 1/40,000.
At 7.15 on May 1 the Battalion left Armentieres in
full marching order for its move to back areas, and, having
joined the remainder of the Brigade at Les Trois Tilleuls,
proceeded through'Steen werck and Vieux Berquin to Petit
Sec Bois, which was reached at 4 p.m. Here the Battalion
was met by the billeting party, who, having moved early
in the day, was able to guide the companies to their
respective quarters. At 6.15 next morning the march was
continued through Pradelles, Borre, and Hazebrouck to
billets at Ebblinghem, reaching there at 3 p.m. The third
day’s march was finished at St. Martin-au-Laert, after
passing through Arques and St. Omer; while the fourth
day enabled the training area to be reached in the after-
noon, the route being through Zudausques, Boisdinghem,
and Quereamp. A total distance of fifty miles was covered,
making an average of twelve and a half miles per day,
the first stage of the journey proving most severe,
as, apart from being the longest, the men’s feet, after four
months’ trench work and use of gum-boots, were soft and
easily blistered; but throughout the whole march the
number of the men who were unable to keep up with the
Battalion was unexpectedly low. Points were given daily
by the Brigade Commander for march discipline and turn-
out, the Battalion securing a higher number than any
other unit.
The area occupied hy the 43rd Battalion included the
villager of Journy (Headquarters and D Company), Le
Buisson (A Company), Bas Loquin (B Company), and
Haut Loquin (C Company), the billets being superior to
those encountered nearer the line and the owners more
generous. An extensive training ground, situated three
and a half miles from Journy, was used regularly through-
out the stay. Hours of drill were from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
two and a half of which were taken up with the march
to and from this area. Close order work and instruction
of specialists occupied the first three days, after which
was conducted a progressive course of trench-to-trench
attacks, culminating in a series of brigade operations over


THE CATHEDRAL, ARMENTIERES.




a spit-locked system of trenches, representing that portion
of the battlefield to be captured by the 3rd Australian
Division in the Messines offensive. At the last of these
practices there were present the Army, Corps, and Divi-
sional Commanders, who, at the conclusion, criticised the
methods adopted. In addition to these schemes, battalion
and brigade open warfare manoeuvres were conducted
both with and without an enemy. Throughout the four-
teen days spent in this area excellent weather prevailed,
rain on one occasion only interfering with parades, and as
a result of these conditions many slept in the open air, a
maximum of outdoor life being obtained by all, the abund-
ance of sunshine and regular hours of drill improving the
fitness, morale, and spirit of the troops to a marked degree.
The long hours of training did pot deter the troops from
freely indulging in recreation after parades, football, as
usual, taking prominence. On Saturday, the 13th, Bat-
talion sports were held at Journy, a football match (A and
B Companies versus C and D), military and athletic events
occupying the day, followed at night by a concert, at
which prizes were presented.
At 6 a.m. on the 12th the journey to Armentieres com-
menced, the route traversed being nearly identical with
that of the march to Journy, halts for the night being
made at St. Martin-au-Laert, Wallon Gappel, and Stra-
zeele; while the destination was reached at 3 p.m. on the
21st and billets allotted off Notre Dame Square, with
Battalion Headquarters at Rue Sadi Carnot. Only a few
days were spent here, as on the night of the 24-25th the
Battalion relieved the 36th in the Le Touquet Sector,
companies and headquarters adopting the same positions
they had occupied when first the sector was entered in
March. Orders were received to assume an aggressive
policy, with a result that fighting patrols were detailed
nightly to operate over the sector, while two raids were
organised, one being cancelled owing to the temporary
shortage of artillery. The other, under Lieutenant C. L.
Herbert, with Lieutenant W. G. Colliver as Officer Com-
manding Assault, and twenty-four other ranks, took place
on the night of May 31-June 1, after a thorough recon-
naissance of No Man’s Land had been made. The point
to be raided was about 200 yards south of the River War-
nave, and at 1.30 a.m., assisted by an artillery barrage,
entry into the enemy’s line was effected, but no identifica-
tion could be obtained, as the only Boche seen escaped
before fire could be brought to bear upon him. On the
withdrawal signal being fired the hostile trenches were
evacuated and all returned, Lieutenant W. G. Colliver and
two other ranks being wounded.
D


On the night of the lst-2nd, 2/4 Loyal North Lanca-
shires relieved the Battalion, which, less C Company, who
moved via Gunner Farm to Maison 1875, proceeded to
billets in Pont-de-Nieppe. Prior to relief officers and
other ranks not taking part in the Battle of Messines were
sent to the 3rd Divisional Echelon at Morbecqne, where
they remained until the 12th.
On the 4th, Lieutenant Colman and thirty other ranks
attempted a daylight raid into the enemy line at Broken
Tree House, but as only a few hours’ notice had been
given previous reconnaissance and preparation were impos-
sible. The party was conveyed by lorry to Ploegsteert
Wood, then filed along C.Ts. to the front line, from
which they commenced at 2 p.m. to move across No Man’s
Land. Heavy rifle and machine gun fire was directed
against them on leaving the parapet, and after proceeding
one hundred yards they suffered casualties and were defi-
nitely checked. The process of returning the wounded
proved most difficult, as enemy fire covered any attempted
movement, necessitating some remaining in shell-holes
until nightfall. The officer and one sergeant w r ere killed,
and eleven other ranks wounded.
The following day a second daylight raid was
arranged, Lieutenant B. P. Shepherd taking a party of
twenty-two other ranks, all volunteers, into the enemy’s
line at 7 p.m. The raiders left Pont-de-Nieppe by motor
lorry, and were conveyed to Ploegsteert Wood, where they
filed up the communication routes to the front line, and at
zero, under cover of an artillery barrage, entered the
hostile trenches between Antons Farm and Broken Tree
House. About twenty of the enemy were seen, but either
sought protection in dugouts or ran towards their support
line, being engaged by the rifle fire of the raiders. As the
party was to remain in the line only eight minutes, it was
not possible to secure any of these as prisoners, although,
as bombs were thrown into an occupied dugout, it is be-
lieved that those within were killed. On the signal to
withdraw being given, the party moved back to its own
lines, gaining shelter in craters and ditches. No casualties
occurred during the raid, but one man was slightly
wounded while returning to billets.
Between the 2nd and sth the issue of offensive equip-
ment was completed and lectures given daily to officers
and non-commissioned officers on the duties to be per-
formed during the battle, and platoons were despatched
to Brune Gaye to inspect a model of the area to be
attacked. During the sth, Pont-de-Nieppe was heavily
shelled by enemy howitzers, causing several casualties to
the Battalion and considerably damaging the town. That

night a move was made to the reserve line in the vicinity
of Maison 1875, C Company moving to Gunner Farm, and
on the following night the completion of the approach to
St. Andrew’s Drive was effected through a heavy concen-
tration of phosgene and lachrymatory gas. This trench
was to form the quarters of the Battalion for the opera-
tion, in which the 3rd Australian Division, as part of the
2nd Anzac Corps, was to assault with the 9th and 10th
Brigades, leaving the 11th as its reserve, the 9th forming
the extreme right of the attack.
C Company, who had on June 1 moved to Gunner
Farm, on the following day occupied Maison 1875, an
isolated house in the subsidiary line on the outskirts of
Ploegsteert Wood. It still remained attached to the Bat-
talion, and was employed on the task of installing water,
ration, and supply dumps for the Brigade’s use in and
around the Wood. These were chiefly established in St.
Andrew’s Drive, The Only AVay, and Annscroft Avenue,
proving most valuable during the subsequent heavy bom-
bardments, the reply to which allowed of little transport
approaching the forward areas. In addition to this duty
the defences of St. Andrew’s Drive were repaired to en-
sure a better protection for the 43rd on its arrival. A
further and most important task allotted to the company
was the supply of food to the 41st Battalion, who were
holding the Divisional Sector during the days preceding
the attack. This was conducted by parties carrying from
the cookers near Maison 1875 to the various company sec-
tors, two hot meals being supplied daily, and although at
times the bombardment was severe, the front line troops
never missed a meal, the parties working chiefly by day,
as at night the enemy shelling, including gas, was intensi-
fied. On the evening of the 6th the Company moved to
Gunner Farm on account of a heavy shelling on its pre-
vious position, and the next morning, after the attack had
commenced, rejoined the Battalion at St. Andrew’s Drive,
remaining in rest all that day.

CHAPTER IX.
THE BATTLE OF MESSINES.
Eeferenee Map: France, 28, 1/40,000.
Zero hour was at 3.10 a.m. on the 7th, and was signi-
fied by the explosion of several mines in the Boche lines
and the opening of the artillery with intense barrage fire,
under cover of which the 9th and 10th Brigades moved
forward to the assault from south of St. Yves to Don-
nington Hall. The 43rd Battalion was not employed until
later in the day, when it was allotted to supply rations,
water, ammunition, and engineer material. For several
days this work continued, in addition to which a com-
munication trench was constructed across the old No-
Man ’s Land towards the new front line, passing through
the late German systems, whose demolished condition bore
ample evidence of the effectiveness of the British guns.
Until the 10th no active part had been taken in the fight
which had won all its objectives, but on that night orders
were received to relieve the 44th in the front line between
Huns Walk and the River Douve and to clear the enemy
from Undulating Support, the Battalion moving forward
in preparation for this at 5 p.m., were forced to remain in
No Man’s Land until visibility became poorer on account
of heavy shelling ahead. By carefully selecting the route
casualties were avoided, and at dusk the leading
troops reached Ungodly Trench, occupied by the 44th.
Almost at the same time intense enemy shell fire was
directed against this trench, causing casualties to both
battalions and confusion in the ranks of the incoming
troops, but by 10.30 p.m. C and A Companies had taken
over the line, B and D pushing forward at 11 p.m. through
the hostile barrage and gaining Undulating Support. On
the right, B encountered resistance, but effectively over-
came it, while on the left D, with little opposition, estab-
lished itself north of Undulating Support, both companies
consolidating a continuous new front line fifty yards for-
ward of their objective, and C Company digging a com-
munication trench to the inter-company boundary. By
daylight next morning excellent cover had been prepared,
the construction of trenches being so complete that a
congratulatory message was received from Brigade. The
day was spent in improving positions and resting under a
harassing fire, and at night, after a hot meal, relief by the


A SHELL-BURST ON THE ROAD BEHIND HIED 63, MESSINES.




16th Battalion was effected, the 43rd withdrawing to St.
Andrew’s Drive by 4 a.m., after sustaining several casual-
ties in the march out. Later in the morning a further with-
drawal was made to Neuve Eglise, where the Morbeeque
party rejoined the Battalion, and empty houses occupied
until the 13th, when quarters near Steenwerek were taken
over, many of these billets having been occupied by the
Battalion on its arrival in Flanders in November, 1916,
a cordial welcome being now given by the owners.
After a rest, training was commenced, close order,
ceremonial, and specialist work being the type of instruc-
tion given; while two inspections weye made, one by the
Brigadier, the other by the Corps Commander, Lieutenant-
General A. Godley.
Steenwerek was again the chief resort after parade
hours, much enjoyment being obtained from the pierrots
and cinema shows, an entrance to which could be obtained
by payment of half a franc. Bailleul and other surround-
ing towns were also accessible with a pass.
On the 20th orders were received to again occupy the
line, the Battalion moving at an early hour next morning
to Neuve Eglise, remaining in billets there until the
evening of the 22nd, when the approach along the Wul-
verghem Road commenced, the movement taking place
by platoons. After traversing a corduroy track and pass-
ing Stinking and Gabion Farms, the old battlefield was
entered, and guides from the Royal Irish Rifles, whom
the 11th Brigade was relieving, met the companies and
led them around the south of Messines to the support line
in advance of White Spot Cot and Betlheem Farm.
During the march A Company suffered heavily from the
effect of one shell, which caused casualties to thirteen of
its number. Apart from this, relief was successfully car-
ried out, and by midnight the four companies were in
position between the River Douve and White Spot Cot,
with the 42nd on the left and the 41st and 44th holding
the front line system, while south of the Douve was
stationed the 4th New Zealand Brigade.
The role of right support was adopted, the work in
connection with it consisting of improvement and consoli-
dation of the defences in the area. The trenches occupied
by the Battalion were in a very bad state of repair and
the accommodation inadequate, so that the initial task
undertaken was the reconstruction of the support
line, following which communication trenches forward
received attention. The enemy shell fire was so heavy
that it was necessary to have deep and narrow trenches
for the preservation of the troops, whose discomfiture was
added to by frequent thunder storms and heavy rain.


THE BATTLE OF MESSINES.


THE EIGHTEEN -DAYS’ STUNT.


Movement by day was reduced to an absolute minimum,
as any activity observed by the enemy brought heavy tire
to bear, all work above ground being undertaken by night
only. The supply of meals was consequently restricted to
the hours of darkness, which at that time were from 9.30
p.m. to 3.30 a.m., during which two hot meals were carried
forward from the cookers situated in the sunken road
running from Messines to Betlheem Farm.
On the night of the 27th-28th the Battalion moved for-
ward to relieve the 41st between the Douve and Steignast
Avenue, C, D, and B Companies occupying the front line,
with A Company supporting them, and Battalion Head-
quarters at Steignast Farm. The 4th Brigade of New
Zealanders and the 42nd Battalion were still situated on
the flanks. The trenches were in a very bad state of
repair, having suffered severely from the recent bombard-
ments and heavy rains, and it was decided to consolidate
a new series slightly in advance, this work being con-
ducted throughout the period in the forward zone. The
position was dominated from the left by the knoll on
Avhich was situated a windmill, while excellent observation
of the British trenches in this sector was obtainable by the
enemy from Warneton, restricting all movement except by
night. The enemy’s main line of defence was the Warne-
ton system, about 600 yards from the British front line,
while machine guns consolidated in shell holes formed its
outposts, these being manned at dusk and "withdrawn at
dawn. The policy adopted by the Battalion was that of
peaceful penetration, effected by the formation of posts
slightly in advance of the front line and the construction of
communication trenches leading to them, by which means
it was hoped to secure the higher ground in the vicinity of
the windmill. It appeared evident that the enemy was
expecting a further attack, as by night especially he
showed signs of great nervousness borne out by the fact
of constant harassing fire distributed over the sector and
abundant use of “Very” lights, while abnormal activity
with his patrols prevailed, their strengths often reaching
50, to counteract which it was necessary to operate also
with strong parties Avho almost nightly encountered and
fought them.
The feeding of the men was similarly conducted as
when in support, but was a more difficult task as no satis-
factory communication trenches existed, the two available
ones being badly shattered and, in many places, knee deep
in mud.
As casualties were caused daily, chiefly from shell
fire, and the strain of sitting under continuous bombard-
ments told on the nerves of everybody, the relief by the


41st Battalion on July 5, and the return to the somewhat
quieter support area, were truly welcome. This second
period in support was utilised for somewhat similar work
to that undertaken before moving forward, the improve-
ments of the front line, which was not yet continuous, and
communication trenches forming the chief tasks.
Throughout the whole of the eighteen days spent in
this area enemy aircraft proved exceptionally active,
especially in the early morning, when low-flying planes
engaged trenches and movement with machine gun fire.
The famous Red Circus, commanded by Baron von
Richthoven, was stationed in the area and was a constant
source of worry to both infantry and artillery. It is
worthy of note that this brilliant airman was brought
down by machine gun fire from the ground, on the sector
of the 3rd Division, in April, 1918, during its defence in
the Amiens Area.
The Quartermaster’s store and the transport lines
were stationed at Neuve Eglise, rations being conveyed to
the cookers by night, at first in limbers, but, owing to the
harassing fire and bad state of the roads, were later
transported by pack animals, which proved far more
satisfactory. On the 10th these establishments were
moved to a camp on the Douve in the vicinity of Mont
Kemmel, the Battalion joining them at daybreak on the
11th, after being relieved by the 35th, and moving out of
the line by platoons, receiving a hot meal and retiring to
their quarters for the first peaceful sleep since June 21.
This work of constructing the new defences after the
Battle of Messines will long live in the memories of all
who w’ere present with the Battalion, the strain and hard-
ships endured frequently forming the topic of conversa-
tion in later months, the period being referred to as “The
Eighteen-Days Stunt.”
At the time of entering the line Major A. W. Lott
was in charge, holding that position until the end of the
month, when Lieutenant-Colonel C. P. Butler, D. 5.0.,
returned from leave and resumed duty.

THE BATTLE OF WARNETON.


CHAPTER X.
WARNETON.
Reference Map: Prance, 28, 1/40,000.
The new camp, containing the whole of the Brigade,
consisted throughout of hell tents and was situated on
the banks of the Douve, with training grounds adjacent.
Following on the few days’ rest, information was
received that the Battalion was to participate in a diver-
sion attack with the 42nd east of Messines, the object
being to mislead the enemy as to the extent of the attack
being launched at Ypres and to secure the commanding
ground north-west of Warneton.
Specialist and physical instruction formed the chief
part of the early training until sufficient particulars of the
operation were issued to enable formations and practice
attacks to be conducted. Considerable interest was
exhibited in recreation, especially cricket and football;
while Brigade athletic sports were contested on July 25
and 27; and concerts were given by visiting troupes of
pierrots.
This, together with the excellent weather that pre-
vailed, materially assisted in the recovery of the troops
after the strenuous eighteen days’ consolidation following
Messines. On the 24th and 27th the Battalion practised
the approach and attack over trenches representing the
field of operations, so that every man knew his allotted
task. In addition to this was constructed by Sergeant
Rayner a model of the battlefield at which lectures were
given daily to platoons.
Intelligence reports and the study of aeroplane photo-
graphs led higher authorities to suspect that the enemy
had changed his system of defence, and instead of holding
his front line as before, had a number of troops occupying
shell holes in No Man’s Land as strong points, supported
by machine guns. It was also suspected that these were
held in much stronger force during the hours of darkness
and that the reinforcing garrisons were withdrawn just
before daybreak each morning.
With the idea of lowering the morale of these gar-
risons and also misleading the enemy as to the hours at
which the intended attack was to be launched, an
artillery creeping barrage was “put down” at varying
hours for several mornings preceding the attack.


The objectives allotted to the Battalion consisted of a
series of strong points similar to those referred to above,
from 100 to 300 yards in advance of the British line.
Chief amongst these was the Windmill Post which over-
looked the low ground east of Messines and consisted of
the remains of an old French mill, surrounded by tall trees
and hedges, situated on Warneton-Gapaard Road, approx-
imately 1,500 yards north-west of Warneton. This post
was heavily wired and connected with the Warneton
trench system by a communication trench, and had been
consistently bombarded some days prior to the attack by
6,8, and 12 inch howitzers, as shells of smaller calibre were
found to be useless against the strong concrete dugouts.
Altogether six strong points were allotted for the Bat-
talion to attack, extending over a frontage of 600 yards.
The 42nd Battalion operated on the left, having the same
number of posts to deal with on a frontage of 700 yards.
Following on the capture of these objectives, it was the
intention to establish three advanced posts, the first being
about 100 yards east of Warneton-Gapaard Road, and 100
yards north of the Windmill, and the last, 150 yards south
of the Windmill. In addition, it was proposed to advance
the line immediately west of these posts a distance of 120
yards.
In order to deceive the enemy as to the extent of the
attack, and also with the idea of assisting consolidation of
the posts and new line, the platoons allotted to the
mopping up would be pushed forw-ard a distance of 200
yards, to the proximity of the wire covering the enemy’s
Warneton line of trenches. These troops would withdraw
to assist with the consolidation of the advanced posts
1 hour and 45 minutes after zero, thus leaving the newly-
established posts to cover the digging of the main line of
defence.
The distribution of the Battalion and the tasks
allotted to the companies for the attack were as follows-. —
To A Company (Lieutenant F. G. Tucker) was given the
task of mopping up three enemy posts, C Company
(Captain G. King) was to assault and clear the remaining
three posts, including the Windmill. The establishing
and consolidation of the advanced posts was allotted to
B Company (Lieutenant E. J. Colliver), whilst D Com-
pany (Captain F. G. Sims) was to dig the main line. The
assaulting troops (A and C Companies), after withdrawal,
were to assist in the consolidation of the new positions.
Three brigades of field artillery and a number of
heavy guns were allotted to pound the enemy’s defences—
the field pieces for the barrage under which the men
advanced, those of heavier calibre devoting their attention


to neutralising, with gas and high explosive, the fire of
enemy batteries. In addition, smoke shells were fired on
the enemy’s Warneton trenches in order to cover the
withdrawal of the advanced troops, and at the same time
to lead the enemy to believe that, under cover of this,
reorganisation for a further advance was taking place.
Stokes’ and medium mortars co-operated by bombarding
strong points on the flanks of the attack, using a per-
centage of smoke shells on the south in order to screen the
movements of the attacking troops from observers in
Warneton. Forty-eight machine guns gave most valuable
assistance in the barrage.
As the attack opened, A Company, on the left, soon
met with strong opposition from enemy posts, situated
too close to the jump-off line to allow of their being
harassed by the barrage; but after stubborn hand-to-hand
fighting the resistance was overcome and the advance
continued.
On the right, although the objective was reached and
the enemy post captured, its garrison, which had retired
to the flank and established itself in a communication
trench, brought machine gun and rifle fire to bear on the
platoons then in process of consolidation. To force the
enemy to evacuate this position it was necessary to draw
assistance from the platoon then digging the post near the
Windmill.
In the centre, the Windmill was captured without
serious opposition, and the establishment of the post
undertaken.
By 4.45 a.m. all objectives had been gained, and
consolidation was in progress along the whole of the
Battalion front. Casualties, chiefly from rifle and machine
gun fire, had been heavy, and the process of evacuating
the wounded difficult, as stretcher bearers, in their ex-
posed work overground, were constantly harassed by
enemy fire. In addition, rain, which commenced to fall
shortly after zero, rendered this heavy task more and
more arduous. During the day three minor counter-
attacks were launched, all of which were repulsed with
comparative ease and without loss of ground. In the
meantime, construction of advanced posts and the main
line w r as completed.
On account of depletion in the strength of the forward
platoons, men were detailed from D Company to build up
these garrisons, and came under command of Officer Com-
manding B Company.
During the day enemy planes reconnoitred the battle-
field and informed the hostile artillery of the exact posi

tions of the new posts, on which an intense fire was
concentrated.
As a result of the arduous approach and the heavy
day’s fighting, combined with continuous rain, the Bat-
talion w r as most exhausted w'hen at 9.30 p.m. a determined
attempt w r as made by the enemy to capture two of his
lost posts. This was preceded by an intense artillery and
trench mortar bombardment, directed against the newly-
consolidated positions. The attack failed on the left, but
after heavy fighting it succeeded in forcing back the
garrison of the Windmill and occupying that important
point.
Orders had previously been given that should any
post be lost an immediate counter-attack was to be
by D Company to recapture it. Consequently,
at midnight, a party about forty strong advanced under
cover of a barrage, and by 1 a.m. regained this stronghold
without sustaining any casualties.
Having thus completed its allotted task, the Battalion
was relieved by the 41st, the men then moving back by
small parties to Douve Camp, at ■which they arrived in an
utterly exhausted condition, were given a hot meal, and,
throwing aside their mud-soaked clothing, “turned in”
for a well-earned rest.
It was evident that as a diversion the operation was
highly successful, as the preparation had led the enemy to
believe that a large attack was developing in this area,
and consequently he had concentrated guns and men for
the defence. This w r as the cause of the heavy casualties
sustained, amounting to slightly over 40 per cent, of the
troops engaged.
Casualties.
The following are the figures:—
In addition to the strain of enemy action, rain, which
commenced a few hours after zero, continued without
cessation throughout the remainder of the operation,
creating a field of mud, which increased the hardships to
an extent that only fit and hardened men could endure.
An almost perfect system of communication had been
established, including the Lucas lamp, telephone, power
buzzer and pigeon; but owing to the intensity of the


enemy reply runners proved to be the only means of
conveying despatches.
In the early stages of the fight the power buzzer
succeeded in transmitting several messages, but frequent
breaks in the earth lines soon rendered the instrument
useless, while smoke made lamp reading impossible, and
pigeons proved too shocked by enemy shell fire to be of
any use.
It is estimated that one hundred of the enemy were
killed, while thirty prisoners and three machine guns
were captured.
Special messages of congratulation were received
from Army and Corps for the success achieved, the Army
Commander personally conveying his appreciation to
Lieutenant-Colonel Butler, D. 5.0., when inspecting the
Battalion a fortnight later.

CHAPTER XI.
REORGANISATION IN BACK AREAS.
Reference Map: Hazebrouek, 1/100,000.
After so strenuous a battle a long rest was required,
and for hours the men remained in their tents sleeping
and talking over the many incidents of the last few days.
Great assistance was rendered by the “Q” and non-
fighting personnel in administering what little comforts
were available, meals for the first two days being carried
around to the tents.
No encouragement was given to leave their quarters,
as the weather still continued wet, and the outer clothing
had been collected and transported to the Palmer Baths,
where, under Battalion supervision, it was cleaned and
dried, not being available for re-issue until August 30.
The following day, after striking tents and cleaning
the area, a move to hutments known as Jesus Farm was
undertaken, heavy rain falling during the last half-hour
of the march.
Quarters were allotted and settling down completed
by 4 p.m., the 42nd Battalion also occupying a portion of
the same camp.
It was expected that some weeks would be spent
here, in consequence of which general training was
arranged, the type including physical drill, bayonet fight-
ing, ceremonial, assault, and consolidation. The usual
procedure of refitting after an offensive action was com-
pleted as the requirements became available, and various
inspections were carried out, including those of Battalion,
Brigade, and Army Commanders, the preparation for
which resulted in considerably smartening the appearance
of the unit. No material progress was made in the train-
ing—firstly, on account of a series of heavy thunderstorms,
which rendered the low-lying ground surrounding the
camp unfavourable for drill movements; and, secondly,
because, from the 13th, working parties were required
daily at De Seule and Messines, the former for the con-
struction of ammunition dumps and the latter for the
consolidation of the corps line of defence. On account of
the distance to this line the parties, who worked largely


43RD BATTALION FOOTBALL TEAM, JANUARY, 1919.




by night, were conveyed to and from Souvenir Dump,
near Wulverghem, by lorries.
Assisted by a favourable moon, hostile bombing planes
proved very active over the Steenwerck area, but fortu-
nately did not execute any damage to the camp. Further
anxiety was caused by the fire of a high velocity gun that
was frequently directed against a kite balloon stationed
in close proximity to the huts, and although a number of
fragments fell among the billets no casualties resulted.
No concerts were arranged within the Battalion, but
leave was granted to Steenwerck and surrounding vil-
lages, where concert parties and cinemas were showing
nightly.
While in this area, the 11th Brigade formed the
reserve for the Armentieres and Fleurbaix Sectors, then
held by English troops, and the 43rd was, if called into
action, to operate on the right. The approaches and
defences of Fleurbaix were reconnoitred by a percentage
of officers, and preliminary instructions for a move for-
ward issued.
On the 20th notice was received that a period was
to be spent in back areas, and a party was consequently
dispatched to reconnoitre and allot billets to be occupied.
Two days later Jesus Farm was evacuated, and after
entraining at Steenwerck Station the move continued by
rail to the Lumbres area, where at midday the Battalion
detrained at Wizernes and marched to its quarters at
Avroult, eight miles distant. This village was sufficiently
large to accommodate all four companies without over-
crowding, the billets themselves being very satisfactory,
excepting that D Company’s were numerous and
scattered.
Thorough arrangements for a progressive system of
training were made, commencing with platoon close order
drill and specialist work, such as signalling, scouting,
Lewis gunnery and bombing, so that these sections would
be proficient in their particular branch when field opera-
tions were introduced. In addition, bayonet fighting and
physical exercises also formed an important feature in the
hours of parade, while route marches were held at least
once a week.
As the various sections became adept in their par-
ticular weapon Battalion schemes were arranged, followed
later by general field work, including advanced guards
and outpost duties, both by day and by night.
In the early days of September it was learnt that the
3rd Australian Division was to be engaged in the offensive
to he launched at Ypres, and consequently training for the
class of warfare anticipated was commenced, including


trench-to-treneh attacks, general advances, and open war-
fare, all practised in various formations, each one being
criticised by higher authorities.
A successful inter-company cooking competition was
held on the 14th and 15th of the month, when points were
allotted for the type of cooking, variety, cleanliness of
quarters, economy, etc., and after much enthusiasm being
exhibited by all engaged, the results placed C Company
in the -winning position, with B Company a close second.
In addition to the healthy open life and careful feed-
ing arrangements, endeavours were made to further
improve the fitness of the unit by the encouragement of
football and other games, assisted by a Brigade Military
and Athletic Sports Meeting, held at Campagnette on the
17th, at which the Battalion secured second place in the
aggregate.
As a relaxation from the general routine, a trip to
the coast was arranged throughout the Division, this
Battalion leaving Avroult at 8 a.m. on the 19th by motor
lorries, and proceeding through Desvres and Marquise to
Tardinghem, situated about midway between Calais and
Boulogne, where quarters were allotted in a tent camp
among the sandhills. Here swimming and games on the
beach formed the chief method of passing away the time
until, on the 21st, the return journey was undertaken.
The following day Sir Douglas Haig inspected the 3rd
Australian Division, the Battalion marching to Drion-
ville for the parade and march-past. This was the last
eventful happening in this area, as on the 25th, at 7 a.m.,
the journey to the forward zone was commenced, Blaring-
hem being reached that afternoon and quarters allotted
in an old prisoners of war compound, close to Neuf Fossse
Canal, in which permission to swim was obtained. As the
march had been heavy and the day hot fullest advantage
was taken of the opportunity thus afforded. After one
night here, the move was resumed at an early hour, the
Becke Steenvoorde area providing billets for the second
night's halt, Poperinghe being entered in the early after-
noon of the 27th, and Camp 31, one kilo, south of the town,
consisting solely of tents taken over for the unit’s occu-
pation, with transport located in an adjoining field. The
march proved that the life and training at Avroult had
fitted both man and animal for the arduous task ahead.

CHAPTER XII.
YPRES.
Reference Maps: Hazebrouck, 1/100,000; France, 28, 1/40,000.
Four days were spent at this Poperinghe Camp, during
which time orders were received for the operation in
which the Division was soon to take part, and the issue of
offensive equipment and practice of the methods of attack
to be adopted covered a large part of the Battalion’s
work prior to its move to the line.
In addition to this, officers and non-commissioned
officers were daily sent through Ypres to gain a knowledge
of the.nature and lie of the country, and to acquaint them-
selves with the area surrounding the demolished town.
The concentration of troops, transport, and artillery in
the Ypres-Poperinghe area, and the traffic hy day and
night was far in excess of any previously witnessed hy
this Battalion, in consequence of which hostile bombing
planes were abnormally active during the hours of dark-
ness, being materially assisted by bright moonlight
throughout the later portion of September. Considerable
damage was done in surrounding camps by the bombs
dropped, but no casualties were caused to this unit,
although on one occasion four of these missiles fell within
forty yards of the camp, one passing through a limber in
the transport lines, but fortunately all failed to explode.
On the 29th, two officers and one hundred other ranks
were required for work on dumps at Ypres, and remained
detached from the unit until the morning of October 3.
This seriously inconvenienced the final preparations for
attack, but as the work, unloading ammunition, was of
an urgent nature, there was no alternative.
Prior to leaving Camp 31, the Battalion was able to
secure an allotment of hot baths in Poperinghe, but could
not obtain clean clothing owing to the great pressure at
which this establishment was working.
At 2 p.m. on October 2 the Battalion evacuated its
tents, and in fighting order entrained for Ypres, and on
alighting at the Asylum moved in single file past the ruins
of the Cloth Hall and Cathedral, through the Menin Gate,
to an allotted bivouac area near the Cemetery, where in
shell holes and under shelter of hedges the night was
spent, blankets having been transported from Poperingh*


that afternoon. The Battalion was to spend the whole of
the following day in this bivouac, and to ensure that the
concentration was not observed by enemy aircraft orders
were issued that all movement by daylight was to be
restricted to an absolute minimum, but these instructions
were somewhat modified owing to a mist prevailing.
Cookers were parked in ruins near by, and provided three
hot meals for the troops, while limbers brought forward
the remainder of the equipment necessary for the assault.
A final reconnaissance was made by many officers and
non-commissioned officers during the day, chiefly with the
object of gaining a knowledge of “F” Track, along which
the Battalion was to make its approach march for the
battle to take place next morning, when the 3rd Australian
Division, as part of the Second Army, was to at lack
immediately north of the Ypres-Roulers railway, with the
10th and 11th Brigades, the 9th prior to zero holding the
line and on completion of the approach moving to reserve.
In this operation the four battalions of the 11th
Brigade were utilised for assault, the 43rd leading the
attack and having an objective 700 yards from the jump-
off trench, the 42nd, 44th, and the 41st respectively leap-
frogging through to further objectives.
At 9 p.m. the approach march was commenced along
“F” Track, a duck-boarded overland route, the Battalion
moving in single file in the order of D, B, A, and C Com-
panies and Battalion Headquarters. The march continued
at a steady pace through line after line of guns, commenc-
ing with heavy calibres and finishing with the lighter field
pieces, not camouflaged or hidden, but totally exposed to
view. At 10.30 a halt was made for an hour at Potsdam,
during which time a pack train from the transport, loaded
with Stokes ammunition, passed through the resting
troops and dumped its supplies on Bremen Ridge. On
resuming the march the pace decreased owing to enemy
shell fire, and the need for caution, and a slight delay was
caused by crossing the Zonnebeke, at one time a small
stream, but now turned into a marsh by shell fire. The
assembly line was eventually reached by the head of the
column at 1 a.m. on the 4th, and half-an-hour later all the
companies were in their assaulting positions, having had
one casualty only in the approach, although during the
latter part of the march hostile artillery was considerably
active.
The dispositions for the attack were: D Company,
right; B, centre; A, left; each with three platoons assault-
ing and one in support, while C Company was used as a
reserve, and lay up behind D, on whose sector was antici-
pated the most resistance. Brigade Headquarters were


situated in a pill-bos near Bostin Farm, close to the
railway line and in the Valley of the Zonnebeke.
The remainder of the Brigade formed up immediately
behind the 43rd, while the 2nd Australian Division on the
right and the 10th Australian Infantry Brigade on the left
occupied the flanks.
As zero was not until 6 a.m., a four-hour wait was
necessary before the artillery barrage opened, protection
from hostile fire being obtained during this interval in
shell holes which, however, gave very little shelter from
the cold wind and drizzling rain. Until 5 a.m. intermittent
artillery and trench mortar fire was directed by the enemy
against the forward position, causing several deaths, two
being Captain F. G. Sims and Lieutenant T. H. Howden,
of D Company, the command of which passed to Lieutenant
T. W. B. Roberts, while Lieutenant C. L. Herbert, who was
supervising the assembly, was also killed when returning
to Battalion Headquarters with the report of completion.
In the early hours of the morning information was
received by A Company from the 10th Brigade that from
a prisoner’s statement an anemy attack was to be ex-
pected, and with the object of breaking it in its early
stages Lewis guns were moved forward into No Man’s
Land. It was later proved that the operation was
actually to take place, but was superseded by the one
launched at 6 a.m. At 5.30 the enemy considerably
increased his fire, which affected the rear of the Brigade
to such an extent that the 44th and 41st Battalions were
obliged to move forward into the areas occupied by the
42nd and 43rd, where the concentration was less
pronounced.
This hostile activity was continued up till zero hour,
although the British guns were endeavouring by counter-
battery work to neutralise the fire. It was feared at
Battalion Headquarters that the abnormal fire of the
artillery might be mistaken by some of the leading troops
as barrage fire, but when at 6 a.m. the full force of the
artillery opened the battle, so great was the intensity that
all were convinced that their fears had been groundless.
The artillery and machine gun concentration was
arranged in depth, as per the following sketch, the
18-pounders forming the protective fire for the infantry.

Each calibre lifted 100 yards every four minutes, except during
“halts.”
Apart from this, counter-battery work was under-
taken by a certain percentage of the guns. During the
normal stages of the advance, the whole depth of the bar-
rage lifted one hundred yards every four minutes, except
for halts, varying from fifteen to ninety minutes, when
only a small percentage of the guns were active, and dur-
ing which the rear waves of the infantry were able to pass
over the recently-captured objective and form up for a
continuance of the advance when the guns again adopted
their barrage fire.
When the battle opened no encouragement was neces-
sary to commence the attack, as all were only too anxious
to move forward and escape the fire directed by the enemy
on to the “lying up” positions. The leading troops
worked well forward to the proximity of the fall of
18-pounders, and were closely followed by the remainder
of the attackers, who during the early stages of the battle
showed a great tendency to over-crowd the advanced
waves.


THE BATTLE OF YPRES.


On the Battalion front, Hill 40 proved the first
obstacle, D Company sustaining numerous casualties from
a machine gun operating from a pill-box on the crest.
Rapid application of a Lewis gun against this position
killed the crew and enabled the advance to continue.
B Company had in the meanwhile been engaged with
bombs from the north of this pill-box, but with little diffi-
culty overcame the opposition. By 6.15 Hill 40 had been
captured.
As the advance continued, only slight resistance was
encountered, as the intensity of the artillery had so
demoralised the enemy troops that in most cases they were
only too willing to surrender. Many of these had sought
refuge in their concrete dugouts, out of which they were
ordered and collected by the “moppers-up,” parties
specially detailed to closely follow the assaulting waves
and clear the ground of enemy in hiding or in strong
positions, thus preventing them from emerging and firing
into the backs of the foremost troops. By this method a
number of prisoners were captured by D Company from
the numerous dugouts along the railway forward of
Zonnebeke Station. This Company had, within the first
ten minutes of the battle, lost all its officers, Acting Com-
pany Sergeant-Major Cameron then taking charge, and
having also sustained somewhat heavy casualties it auto-
matically received assistance from C Company (Reserve),
who was very closely following it.
Although the barrage advanced only at the rate of
one hundred yards every four minutes, it was found to
be none too slow, owing to the heavy and torn state of the
ground presenting a continuous obstacle to heavily
equipped troops.
At 6.30 the first objective, which ran through Alma,
was captured by this Battalion, who “laid up” while the
42nd, 44th, and 41st in succession passed through to attack
further objectives.
When these troops were clear, consolidation was
commenced, part of C Company remaining to assist D, the
balance withdrawing to the west of Hill 40. The method
of consolidation adopted by A, B, and D Companies was a
line of defence, with its supports and outposts consisting
of Lewis Gun Sections, pushed forward a distance of 100 '
to 200 yards, while the Battalion Reserve (C Company)
was located in rear of the centre company. For the first
few hours of the battle, the enemy counter-barrage was
not heavy, but as the day progressed more guns came into
action, and the newly-captured ground was subjected to
heavy destructive fire, directed largely against pill-boxes
and dead ground. By midday information was received.


from the forward troops that all objectives had been
successfully captured and consolidation was in progress.
The task of evacuating the wounded again proved a
difficult one, owing to the condition of the ground, the
long, arduous carry devolving on stretcher bearers prov-
ing so heavy that assistance had to be given by C Company.
The night of the 4th-stli was normally quiet and
most of the troops were able to obtain a few hours’ sleep.
C Company supplied two parties to carry rations and
water for the 41st and 44th Battalions. The following
day all four companies detailed parties for salvage,
burials and stretcher bearing.
As limbers were unsuitable for work in the forward
areas, the brigade transports were organised into three
pack trains, which transported rations, ammunition, and
supplies to Brigade Headquarters, the advanced dump,
from where they were collected by their respective units.
Amongst these was a meal, which reached the Battalion
on the night of the 4th-sth.
At midday on the sth, A, B, and D Companies, wdio
were stationed in the low-lying ground north-east of Hill
40, withdrew to its western slope on account of heavy
enemy shell fire directed against them, and remained in
an old trench until 4 p.m., when the wdiole Battalion
moved in small parties to Prezenberg Eidge, where it
bivouacked until dusk and then proceeded through Ypres
to the Asylum. Here the men received a hot meal from
the cookers, were issued with their blankets, and, taking
advantage of all available shelter, settled down for a few
hours’ sleep. Early next morning a move was made to
Toronto Camp, near Ylamertinghe, where for the next few
days reorganisation and refitting for a further offensive
was undertaken. On account of depleted strength the
unit was reorganised into two companies only, each of
four platoons.
Men were given as much sleep as possible, and con-
certs by Battalion and Y.M.C.A. troupes were organised,
while baths and clean underclothing were available. Dur-
ing the early morning of the 9th an attack north-east of
Zonnebeke was attempted by English troops then holding
the line, but the objectives w r ere not gained, owing largely
to the heavy condition of the ground, caused by rains
which fell after the battle of the 4th, and the thick wire
protecting Bellevue Spur.
The 3rd Australian Division was to be engaged on
this sector on the night of the 9th-10th, so at 11.30 a.m.
on the 9th the Battalion, under command of Major H. G.
Freeman for the operation, evacuated Toronto Camp and


commenced an approach march by platoons, but on reach-
ing the Poperinghe-Ypres Road the heavy traffic necessi-
tated the continuance of the move being conducted in
single file. A halt for lunch was made in the Square at
Ypres, the approach continuing half-an-hour later, until at
the crossing of “F” Track and the old British front line,
bivouacs were established for the night and the following
day, during the morning of which a fatigue party of one
hundred was detailed for repairs to the Ypres-Zonnebeke
railway track. A similar number relieved these at mid-
day, and remained at their task imtil dusk, when they
joined the Battalion, then moving into the line.
Prior to the departure from the bivouac area exten-
sive reconnaissance was undertaken by officers, non-com-
missioned officers, and runners, so that even for the final
stages of approach no guides were necessary. The march
from this temporary camp, although undertaken in day-
light, proved strenuous, as only portion of the track was
duckboarded, and the troops, after crossing the Zonnebeke,
were subjected to harassing fire.
By 6.30 the Battalion had taken over from part of the
66th British Division the support position at Tyne Cott,
north of the Ypres-Roulers railway. During the relief
a heavy concentrated shoot was directed against this area,
several casualties being caused to incoming troops along
the sunken road that cut the railway at Daring Cross.
The dispositions that night were44th and 41st
holding the line, with 43rd and 42nd in support. The 4th
Australian Division was holding south of the railway line,
the divisional boundary. The 43rd occupied a frontage
of 600 yards from the railway line on the right, defended
by A and D Companies, to Hamburg on the left, for which
B and C Companies were responsible, while Brigade Head-
quarters for the night occupied an open position between
Beecham and Boethoek, establishing itself next morning
at Bostin Farm.
During the night positions were improved and full
advantage of all cover taken from the constant harassing
fire that played throughout the day. A further 100 men
were again sent to work on the railway line and remained
detached until the following day when they joined their
companies near Bremen Redoubt, these having withdrawn
during the night after relief by the 9th Brigade who were
to attack next morning. The route taken was along the
railway line past Zonnebeke Station to the crossing near
Bostin Farm, the best track in this locality, but one sub-
jected to extremely heavy shell fire. The march was com-
pleted by bivouacking in shelters between Potsdam and
Yampir, 200 yards south-west of Brigade Headquarters,


then situated in a large pill-box at the bend of the main
road. The 11th Brigade adopted the role of reserve for
the 3rd Australian Division in an attack in conjunction
with the 4th Australian Division on the right and the New
Zealanders on the left commencing at 5.20 on the 12th.
As the area then occupied by the Battalion was in
close proximity to the field guns that during the day were
being engaged by enemy batteries, it was evacuated in the
afternoon in favour of Bremen Redoubt, a safer and drier
position, which was maintained until the following
evening. It was at this time necessary to return to the
waggon lines a number of men who had been slightly
gassed the previous night and others suffering badly from
trench feet, a percentage of these being replaced by details
from Echelon. Owing to the particularly heavy work
and exceptionally trying conditions recently undergone,
the fighting power of the Battalion was lower than it had
ever been before. The twenty-six hours spent at Bremen
Redoubt helped, however, to rest the men somewhat and
enabled them to partially dry their clothing and boots.
The attack on the morning of the 12th not having
been a success, the 11th Brigade again moved forward to
its old sector, occupying it with the same dispositions as
before the attack. At 6 p.m. on the 13th the 43rd Battalion
commenced its move forward to relieve a portion of the
9th Brigade, the route selected again being the railway
line, which, although considerably damaged during the
last two days’ fighting and persistent rains, was the only
definite track existing on the sector. The march was one
that will never be forgotten by those who participated in
it. So great was the damage effected by hostile fire that
in many parts of this track, mud thigh-deep had to be
traversed, while the pitch-dark night, consistent rain, and
ceaseless shelling all assisted to prolong to eight hours the
period of approach, so between 2 and 3 a.m. relief was
carried out by these mud-covered troops, none of which
had succeeded in reaching their trench without at least
one fall.
The defences in the vicinity of Tyne Cott were again
occupied, while Battalion Headquarters were located at
Seine. These dispositions were maintained until the
15th, during which time comparative quietness was
enjoyed by the 43rd, on whose area the enemy artillery
was not active. This, together with a certain amount of
sunshine, enabled the men to obtain a much-needed rest
under somewhat warm conditions.
It was here that an Indian Cavalry Major, who stated
that he was tired of waiting behind the lines, attached
himself to one of the companies and with his servant


remained in the line for two days, when he was guided
back to his regiment.
After forty-eight hours here the 9th Brigade again
took over the line, the 11th withdrawing to reserve, the
43rd ’s new position being between Seine and Beecham,
where it remained for six days. Unlike the former area,
this locality was subjected to frequent and heavy shoots,
causing a number of casualties to the unit from day to day
although the men were exceptionally well dug in. After
two days’ rest, parties were engaged in salving, burials
of Australian, English, and German dead, and stretcher
bearing.
A change of men was made daily between Echelon
and the line with, the object of enabling as many as
possible to procure an undisturbed rest.
Rations and water were brought forward nightly by
pack animals and dumped at the Cross Roads between
Seine and Beecham, from where parties collected and
conveyed them to their respective companies.
Although the Battalion was not engaged in any fight-
ing the strain of waiting proved exceptionally severe, for
during the twenty-four hours the only portion of the day
that the enemy artillery remained quiet was between 6 and
9 a.m., when hostile planes reconnoitred at a low altitude
the British lines and frequently harassed movement with
machine gun fire and bombs.
While in reserve the 9th Brigade was relieved by a
portion of the 66th Division, the 11th Brigade still remain-
ing in the same position until the evening of the 21st, when
it was relieved by the 10th Canadians;
The Battalion then moved out via “K” Track, which
was in excellent condition, having recently been duck-
boarded, and led from near Beecham, past Boethoek, to
Brigade Headquarters, the march being then continued by
road through Ypres to tents situated two miles south-west
of this city. Here a hot meal was served and a few
hours’ sleep obtained.
At 6 a.m. on the 22nd the portion of the Battalion Avho
had belonged to Echelon the previous day, moved to
Ylamertinghe and entrained for Wizernes, marching that
afternoon to billets at Avroult. The balance proceeded
to Krusstraat, one kilo south of Ypres, where, with the
remainder of the Brigade, it embussed and proceeded, via
Poperinghe, Cassel, Arques, and Wizernes, to Clety,
thence marching to former billets at Avroult.
The transport left the same day, and after spending
the first night at Eecke, the second at Renesure, rejoined
the Battalion at 1.30 p.m. on the 24th.

CHAPTER XIII.
THE WINTER OF 1917-18.
Reference Maps: Hazebrouck, 1/100,000; France, 36, 1/40,000;
France, 28, 1/40,000.
The civilians in their quiet way clearly exhibited their
appreciation of the Battalion’s return to the village, and
the billeting caused little trouble, as the companies, now
greatly depleted in strength, were allotted their former
areas.
Following the arrival, Colonel Butler, D. 5.0., called
a parade, at which he addressed and thanked all ranks
for the excellent result achieved and the determination
shown throughout the recent fighting.
The programme of training was so arranged that the
primary object was to reinstate the old health and fitness
that prevailed prior to Ypres, rest and light exercises
being scheduled for the first few days, following on which
a very gradual process was introduced, consisting mostly
of platoon training and short route marches, combined
with physical drill and bayonet fighting. As much
recreation as possible was encouraged by means of
inter-company competitions and inter-battalion football
matches, and as the weather remained favourable this
healthy exercise, combined with careful feeding, had the
desired effect of steadily raising the spirit and endurance
of the men.
In addition to this general work, specialists were
given a percentage of their technical training, while refit-
ting and reorganisation received early attention. A
non-commissioned officers’ school was established in the
Brigade, at which junior and prospective non-commis-
sioned officers underwent a thorough course in their duties,
while a class for officers in map reading was also assembled
at the 11th Field Company Engineers.
On October 25, Major A. T. Patterson joined the
Battalion and assumed duty as Second in Command,
taking charge a few days later, when Colonel C. P. Butler,
D. 5.0., proceeded on leave.
At the end of the month inoculation of the men who
came to France with the Battalion was undertaken, train-
ing for a few days being consequently diminished.


PART OF VILLAGE OF SELLKS, WHERE BATALLION WAS BILLETED WHEN SUDDENLY CALLED TO THE SOMME
Corporal Blucher carried this sketch of his into the battle of Hamel, 4/7/18, where he was killed.
The piece of shrapnel which killed him passed through the sketch, causing the hole.




On November 12 the return to forward areas by route
march was commenced, billets for the first night being
allotted at Wittes, which after a fifteen-mile march
through Clarques and Rineq was reached at 3 p.m. The
route for the second day led through Boeseghem, Haver-
skerque, and Neuf Berquin to Doulieu, a distance of
twenty-one miles. Here the Battalion rested for a day,
proceeding to De Seule on the 15th, where Kent Camp
was occupied for the night, Canteen Corner being taken
over next morning. These new quarters consisted of a
well-laid-out set of hutments, which, in addition to living
quarters, contained also quartermaster’s store, orderly
room, recreation hut, officers and sergeants’ messes, with
transport stables adjoining. As many of the huts were in
need of repairs an extensive works policy was adopted to
execute these and undertake many improvements through-
out the lines. One of the most important was the estab-
lishment of duckboard tracks to the various huts, as with
the winter setting in the ground was becoming wet and
slippery.
While here the Battalion role was, as part of the 11th
Brigade, reserve to the 9th and 10th Brigades, then holding
the Le Touquet Sector from the River Lys to the River
Douve. As usual while in reserve, reconnaissance of the
divisional front was undertaken by officers and non-com-
missioned officers, a percentage proceeding daily to dif-
ferent battalion sectors.
Outdoor training and parades continued when weather
permitted, while sport and recreation were more exten-
sively indulged in than had previously been possible,
inter-company and battalion football and soccer matches
taking place at frequent intervals.
On the 26th, the anniversary of the Brigade’s arrival
in France, a sports meeting was held near the camp, the
11th Machine Gun Company combining with the Battalion
for the day. In the evening the Unit Pierrot Troupe pro-
vided an entertainment in the Recreation Hut,. while a
Brigade officers’ dinner was arranged for 6.30 at De Seule.
Towards the end of the month cross-country runs were
introduced, and recreation of some form became compul-
sory and was conducted as a parade. The Battalion
Pierrots gave frequent concerts, which, together with an
officers’ party and visiting troupes, assisted in providing
entertainments for the long evenings.
On the 25th, Major W. J. Kinnish rejoined, and as
Senior Major assumed the position as Second in Command,
acting as Battalion Commander when, early in December,
Lieutenant-Colonel C. P. Butler, D. 5.0., was evacuated to
hospital, from where he proceeded to Australia.
p


On December 5 the four companies were detailed to
bury cables from Nieppe to Hill 63, the work lasting for
five days, during which time no training was undertaken.
Two Brigade Schools for drill and general instruction
were established on the 6th, one for officers, situated at
Eavelsberg, and the other for non-commissioned officers,
at Kortepyp, the courses occupying four weeks; in addi-
tion, lectures on communication, bayonet fighting, and
other subjects were delivered by visiting officers in the
Y.M.C.A. Tent at the 44th Battalion.
On the 11th voting was conducted throughout the
Battalion on the question of Conscription, every man
being given an opportunity of exercising his franchise.
Four days later 140 men were detached for working
parties near Messines, billeting, and coming under com-
mand of the Royal Engineers at Wulverghem, the balance
of the Battalion, less a small party on guard at De Seule,
moved to Locre —to new hutments, Doncaster Lines, a
clean and well-laid-out camp and, with the remainder of
the 3rd Division, formed the Reserve for the Australian
Corps, to which formation it had passed earlier in the
month. While here, General Sir W. Birdwood presented
the ribbons and medals won in the recent Ypres fighting,
the Brigade parading in ceremonial formation for the
presentation.
The period spent here was of very short duration, as on
the 19th orders were received for the Division to occupy
the Armentieres and Bois Grenier Sectors, necessitating
this Battalion moving to Brquinghem, reached after
spending one night at De Seule. Excessively cold weather
had set in, snow and heavy frosts causing the roads and
ground to become frozen, thus making all movement,
especially that of transport, most treacherous.
Good billets were obtained in Brquinghem and Le
Rolanderie Farm, where the Battalion remained for six
days as reserve to the 42nd, holding the line from Pear
Tree Farm (left) to Rue du Bois (right), to which sector
working parties w’ere supplied daily.
Owing to the uncertainty of future movements, the
Battalion’s Christmas dinner was held during the evening
of the 22nd, and being unable to secure a room sufficiently
large to accommodate all, this meal was served in the
various billets. It was supplied out of proceeds from the
43rd Trench Comforts Fund in Adelaide, and consisted
chiefly of turkey, vegetables, and plum pudding. The
working party from Wulverghem rejoined the following
day, and were given their dinner that night.
Two days prior to taking over the sector from the
42nd, 210 reinforcements joined the Battalion, and were


allotted to various companies, increasing the numbers to
the strength prior to Messines.
On Christmas night specialists moved into the line,
being followed on the night of the 26th by tf?e remainder
of the Battalion, who, after sustaining one casualty in the
approach, assumed command of the sector at 10 p.m., the
outgoing troops moving to Waterlands. For the defence
of the sector two companies of the 44th were attached to
the 43rd, and the dispositions adopted were: A, B, and C
Companies, holding the front and support line, with D and
the two attached Companies in the subsidiary. The
flanks were held on the right by the Welsh Fusiliers, and
on the left by the 9th Brigade. The methods of defence
were very similar to those adopted at Armentieres and Le
Touquet, except that instead of a continuous front line
holding the advanced troops, these were stationed in
detached posts, several of which were only accessible
under cover of darkness. Patrols, rations, and ammuni-
tion were conducted in a similar manner to the previous
quiet sector methods.
Nine days were spent in this system, during which
no important incident occurred, and hostile activity 'was
of a very limited nature, the total casualties inflicted by
it only amounting to tw T o. Severe cold was experienced
throughout, snow lying on the ground, which still
remained frozen throughout the period of occupation, so
that when, on the night of January 3-4, 1918, relief by the
King’s Own Regiment was effected, the march out to the
hutments at Waterlands proved most difficult. A night
only was spent at this camp, lorries conveying the Batta-
lion to Locre next morning, where Doncaster Lines were
again occupied. A thorough system of smartening drill
and ceremonial was adopted, and strict discipline main-
tained, both on and off parade. Apart from the officers’
and non-commissioned officers’ schools already established,
Brigade courses in signalling and intelligence were
arranged and numerous lectures delivered on topics of
military importance. Weather conditions frequently
proved unfavourable for outdoor training, as numerous
snowstorms and heavy falls of rain rendered the ground
unsuitable for drill movements. When possible, however,
route marching was undertaken and recreation indulged
in. Platoon competitions were held in the Battalion, the
leading platoon later taking its place in a Brigade compe-
tition. The Battalion and visiting Pierrot Troupes pro-
vided numerous concerts in the Y.M.C.A. Hut adjoining
the camp, helping by this means to brighten the winter
evenings.


As the enemy was believed to be preparing for a
general advance in Flanders, reconnaissance of reserve
systems at Kcmmel and Neuve Bglise was carried out by a
number of officers, and preliminary orders for their occu-
pation were issued.
From the beginning of the year the leave allotment to
England was increased from two per week to five per day,
so that from the middle of January onwards about seventy
of the Battalion were absent on leave at a time. On the
27th a move through Neuve Eglise to Le Romarin was
undertaken, Le Rossiguol Camp being occupied the fol-
lowing day. While here the Battalion formed support to
the 41st, then holding the Le Touquet system with the
44th, the 10th Brigade occupying the sector on its left.
Training was undergone here for a few days and
preparation made to relieve the 41st, the event taking
place on the night of February 5-6, after proceeding to
the subsidiary line by light railway. An uneventful relief
followed, C and B Companies taking over the front line,
A and D supporting them. The frontage extended from
the Lys to White Farm, the right sub-sector having
remained practically the same as before Messines, but the
left, as a result of the battle, was advanced to conform
with the new line.
The routine while in this sector was very similar to
that conducted in March and May of 1917, but more
active and progressive patrolling was undertaken. Shell
fire was not so heavy, and the time spent here was very
much the same as that of Bois Grenier. Both Hank
Brigades raided the enemy early 7 in the month, but no
retaliatory' shell fire was thrown into this area.
A relief by the 41st was effected on the night of the
13th-14th, Le Rossignol Camp being again occupied, but
instead of training, working parties went forward each
day 7 , the Battalion again moving into the line for the
second time on the night of the 21st-22nd, and remaining
there without special incident until March 1-2, when this
sector was finally 7 evacuated and preparations made, first
at Le Rossignol, then at Kortepyp “A,” for entrainment
to back areas, which movement commenced at 2.30 p.m.
at the Steenwerck Station. Except for four hours’ wait
at Lart, on account of a breakdown ahead, the detraining
station, Lottinghem, was reached without incident, and
after receiving cocoa supplied by the Y.M.C.A., the unit
moved in full marching order, plus two blankets, to billets
at Selles, situated midway between Lottinghem and
Desvres, all being settled down by 3.30 a.m. on the 7th.
The accommodation was somewhat limited and companies
scattered in and around the village, the furthest billet

from Battalion Headquarters being two miles distant,
while the type closely resembled those of former
occupation.
Since leaving Yprcs, the Battalion's work had not
been heavy, only three short tours of duty being spent in
the line, while comfortable camps had formed the homes
through the severe portions of the winter, so that on the
arrival in the back areas the condition of the men was
highly satisfactory. Among the numerous changes that
took place were:—Lieutenant-Colonel Farrell, late Second
in Command of the 42nd Battalion, appointed Command-
ing Officer, Major W. J. Kinnish then resuming duty as
Second in Command. Captain M. Dennison, Adjutant,
was, owing to ill-health, “seconded” for duty with the
Overseas Training Brigade, Captain E. J. Colliver being
appointed as his successor, a quiet farewell evening being
given by the officers on the night prior to the departure
of the former.
It was anticipated that the stay in Lottinghem area
would cover about five weeks, and preparations for train-
ing were based on this information. After the inspections
and refitting usually undergone in back areas, a progres-
sive course of work w T as commenced, only, unlike that
practised before when resting, defence tactics formed the
basis of the daily routine, musketry and Lewis gun instruc-
tion, followed by range w r ork, taking prominence, while a
certain amount of ceremonial and marching was under-
taken each day. Signallers and non-commissioned officers’
schools were again established, and further lectures w T ere
given by Battalion and visiting officers, chiefly on subjects
of defence.
As spring weather prevailed, recreation again played
a leading part in the life of the men, as in addition to that
carried out during parade hours, entertainment was pro-
vided by the arrangement of inter-company and Battalion
football matches. This was further augmented by band
concerts, and a percentage of leave to Boulogne and St.
Omer, lorries being provided for transport.

THE CALL TO THE SOMME.

At 5.30 p.m. on March 21, a mounted staff officer from
Brigade brought information that the Germans had opened
a big offensive and that the Division was to move forward
within forty-eight hours, a normal precaution of higher
authorities for closing up their reserves. This necessitated
a hurried calling in of all training stores, a cessation of
normal work, and concentration on preparing to evacuate
the area. Transport was loaded and the bulk of stores
packed by midnight, but no sleep was obtained by “Q”
and transport personnel, as at 2 a.m. the move order
arrived, giving instructions for most of the transport to
leave by road at 9.30 a.m.
A party consisting of one hundred men was sent to
Desvres to load on the baggage train the vehicles and
stores not proceeding with the main portion of the trans-
port. The balance of the Battalion, in full marching
order, moved from its billets at 11 a.m. for Lottinghem,
arriving at the station at 1 p.m., and after a long wait
entrained and steamed out at 3 o’clock for Caestre.
Blankets were transported by motor lorry to the station
and loaded on this train, the rolls being placed in the same
trucks as the men and utilised as seats. Accommodation
was extremely limited, necessitating considerable over-
crowding throughout the train, but as the journey was
only six hours’ duration this discomfort was cheerfully
borne.
Caestre ■was reached by 9 p.m., and the Battalion
detrained, was met by the billeting party which had been
despatched on receipt of the move order, and conducted
to its various billets in and adjoining the town of Eecke,
where suitable quarters had been allotted. The baggage
train, arriving a few hours later, was unloaded by the
detached party, who then rejoined the unit, and after some
little difficulty with their billets, were eventually settled in
the early hpurs of morning.
It was the intention to complete the five weeks’ train-
ing in this area, and consequently general settling down

and readjusting of billets was conducted on the 22nd, and
a conference held at Brigade Headquarters to discuss the
routine and nature of work. Whilst this meeting was in
progress, an officer from Division brought information that
the Boche had launched a powerful attack against the sth
and 3rd British Armies on the Somme with considerable
success, and that from aerial reconnaissance it appeared
that it was to be exploited, in consequence of which the
3rd Australian Division, as part of the available reserve
troops, was to proceed to the Somme Area.
On the completion of this conference the officers of the
Battalion were called together, informed of the position,
and given preliminary instructions for a move. Only
essential stores and equipment were to be taken, a dump
of all surplus material being established under a guard
from the unit and all ranks warned to secure as much rest
as possible. During the night, Brigade issued further
instructions, under which the Battalion moved, with
equipment and blankets, next morning at 8 a.m., and
embussed between Caestre and St. Sylvestre Cappel
for the Blaringhem Area, halting at Ebblinghem, where
billets had been allotted. The cookers moved by road, and
were in position soon after midday. That part of the
transport which had been detached at Selles rejoined the
Battalion here while on the march. The balance of the
24th and 25th was spent in this place awaiting train
arrangements which were necessarily slow on account of
the increased pressure on railways caused by the opening
of the Hun offensive. This was still being maintained and
growing more serious daily, the Fifth Army having
sustained heavy casualties necessitating its withdrawal to
the Peronne defences, the southern flank of the Third
Army being forced to conform.
Eventually orders were received that the Battalion,
less one company, would entrain at Arques at 8.30 a.m. on
the 26th, therefore an early reveille and a five-mile march
enabled all but D Company, who remained detached until
the evening of the 27th, to reach the station by 7 a.m.,
when information was received from the Railway Trans-
port Officer that the train would not be available for some
hours, so breakfast was issued on the roadside and the
period of waiting brightened by games. At 11 a.m., the
train, consisting of one carriage, 13 covered and 17 un-
covered trucks, having arrived, the unit, including all
transport and horses, was soon on board and at midday
left Flanders, the scene of its seventeen months’ active
service. As sufficient accommodation was available to
permit each man to make himself comfortable, the journey,
"which lasted until 8 p.m., was enjoyable, the midday meal,


FIRST SECTOR HELD ON THE SOMME.


which was carried on the man, being partaken of during
the trip.
The route led through Aire, with its fine cathedral,
fillers, where a few days before the explosion of an
ammunition train had wrecked the station and surrounding
buildings, and St. Pol, then within range of long-distance
guns, to Doullens, where detraining commenced at 8.30
p.m. During this operation enemy night-bombing planes
were- active dropping missiles on the town and station, but
fortunately no casualties were caused to the men. Im-
mediately on arrival here a conference of Commanding
Officers, Adjutants, and Company Commanders was held
at Brigade Headquarters, then situated at Authieule,
where it was learnt that the enemy was still advancing
and had that morning captured Bray-Sur-Somme, and
instructions were given to immediately proceed to the line.
Meanwhile, the Battalion, under Major A. T. Patterson,
marched to Authieule in which area bivouacs were to have
been established, but when being rejoined by the officers
who had attended the conference it was learnt that the
march was to be continued to Thievres, 12 kilometres from
Doullens, where motor lorries were waiting to convey the
troops to Franvillers. During the late hours of the night
this move by road was conducted, all men being deter-
mined to reach their destination in spite of the fact that
they were carrying the additional weight of a blanket and
were fatigued after their previous day’s travelling,
irregular meals and sleep. Before embussing, Lewis guns,
bombs, and additional ammunition were issued from the
mobilisation stores, carried on the transport, and rations,
in bulk, were loaded on the lorries, which left at 1.15 a.m.
on the morning of the 27th, followed at a slower rate by
the transport. After debussing at Franvillers at daybreak
the Battalion proceeded by road to the village of Heilly
which its inhabitants were at the time evacuating with
what few personal belongings they could carry. On
reaching this place packs were removed and stored in an
empty house selected as the Quartermaster’s store, rations
which had been brought by one of the lorries were issued,
and a hasty meal taken, following which a reconnaissance
of the intended line of occupation was made, the Battalion
then moving forward, and, - in conjunction with the
42nd, adopting a defensive position in advance of the
Sailly-le-Sec—Mericourt I’Abbe Road, the 43rd occupy-
ing its northern sector, with its right on the Corbie-Bray
Road, and disposed with A and C Companies in the for-
ward position, and B supporting them.
In the area there were a few English troops, who had
been through several days’ fighting, and were of little use


to offer any further protracted resistance, while north of
the Ancre the 35th British Division was still defending the
important heights west of Albert. A portion of the Ist
British Cavalry Division was in touch with the advanced
enemy troops near Morlancourt, and was engaging them
with machine gun fire, while their two 13-pounder guns
formed the only artillery covering the sector.
During the day there were no organised units in
support, until the 41st and 44th Battalions adopted that
role in the early afternoon.
On selecting the site of defence, consolidation of
platoon posts was immediately undertaken, and by after-
noon all sections were entrenched.
Hostile artillery was slight only, the rapidity of the
advance not yet enabling any concentration of guns to be
brought so far forward, but a battery of field pieces was
active on the forward positions, while heavier calibre
shelled Heilly later in the day. During the afternoon tße
transport arrived at the Quartermaster’s Store, and car-
ried forward picks, shovels, ammunition, and rations for
the troops, who had salved a small quantity of food from
the deserted villages in the vicinity. Before dusk the 10th
Brigade moved forward and established themselves in the
43rd’s sector, this Battalion then side-stepping and reliev-
ing the 42nd of half their frontage and holding it with D
Company, who had arrived late in the afternoon, left, and
B right, supported by C and A respectively. Battalion
Headquarters moved to the Sailly-Le-Sec Valley. The
result of this move proved arduous, as it necessitated the
digging of new positions in and around an old French
system prepared as a defence to Amiens.
Throughout the day the cavalry remained in advance
of the Battalion, which consequently had not, up to night-
fall, effected touch with the enemy.
A line of posts held by two Brigades now existed
between the Somme and the Ancre Rivers, and defensive
measures were immediately introduced to protect the
important, spur which ran down to the junction of these

CHAPTER XV.
THE DEFENCE OF AMIENS.
Beference Map; France, 62d, 1/40,000.
The first night in this new area was naturally an
anxious one, and although everyone was greatly fatigued
magnificent endeavours were made to prepare sufficiently
strong defences from which to repel the inevitable attack.
As this country had not previously been subjected to the
ravages of war, the work of constructing extensive de-
fences proved a lengthy and strenuous task, and was
conducted in stages, commencing with hurriedly dug
platoon posts, gradually extending until they formed con-
tinuous lines, following which communication routes and
strong posts were started.
During the night of the 27th-28th the cavalry were
withdrawn and despatched to the south of the Somme to
protect the Brigade’s right flank, as no touch could be
obtained with any troops at that point. This enabled the
enemy to advance north of the river, and by daybreak
touch had definitely been established. As the day pro-
gressed positions were improved and a little rest obtained,
but an ever-watchful eye was kept for any signs of a
hostile thrust. Arrangements were made during the
afternoon for a number of strong fighting patrols to push
forward along the Divisional front and advance the line,
so that during the hours of darkness the support battalion
could continue the movement and consolidate in more
advantageous positions. Consequently, at 5 p.m., two
platoons, the right commanded by Lieutenant G. J. Oliver,
the left by Lieutenant J. H. Borthwiek, moved forward in
conjunction with similar units from the flank battalions,
and established a series of advanced posts about 500 yards
beyond the front line. Machine gun fire was encountered,
seriously harassing and causing casualties to the left
platoon, and holding up the party operating north of it,
but from the positions adopted command of the valley
leading from Sailly Laurette was secured.
At 10 p.m. the 41st Battalion leapfrogged through and
attempted to continue the advance, but having come under
heavy machine gun fire was unable to exploit. Its A
Company then relieved the two platoons that had pushed


forward during the afternoon, adopting the same posi-
tions and coming under command of the Commanding
Officer, 43rd Battalion, the remainder of the 41st returning
to their role in support. Throughout the whole of this
minor operation steady rain and a bleak wind prevailed,
continuing all the next day.
Aircraft on both sides remained active, both in bomb-
ing and reconnaissance, while artillery was rapidly being
brought into position, and each day the volume of fire was
increasing, that of the enemy batteries being chiefly
directed against villages, high ground, and the Corbie-
Bray Eoad.
The expected enemy attack was launched at midday
on the 30th, after a scattered bombardment for two and a
half hours, with a heavy concentration on Sailly-Le-See
and the valley running north from the village, finishing
with barrage and machine gun fire, under cover of which
the enemy advanced in waves, preceded by scouts with
light machine guns, becoming plainly visible against the
skyline and presenting an excellent target. Information
was immediately despatched to the rear and all instructed
to “Stand to.” The artillery, receiving the S.O.S. from
their observation posts, brought fire to bear on the enemy’s
forward positions, some of the batteries firing over open
sights. Meanwhile the forward troops poured machine
gun and rifle fire into the attackers, receiving further sup-
plies of ammunition from the support company, w'hose
allotted task was to replenish the deficiency from the
dump at Battalion Headquarters.
The attack, which only extended from the Corbie-
Bray Eoad to the Somme, was checked in its early stages,
but leaders, probably officers and non-commissioned
officers, were several times seen trying to rally their men,
each attempt to push forward, however, meeting with the
same fire and quickly collapsing, until by 3 p.m. the only
movement was that of stretcher bearers conveying back
their wounded.
This was the first occasion on which an attack or raid
had been launched against the Battalion, and showed that
the unit was as effective defending as in attacking. It
might here be stated that at the time that the attack was
launched the morale of the troops was excellent, in spite
of the hardships and trying conditions experienced since
leaving Selles, as evidenced in remarks such as “This is
what we’ve been waiting for,” heard by an officer when
visiting several of the posts early in the attack. It need
scarcely be added that the success achieved left everyone
in excellent spirits.

Much credit is due to the attached company of the
41st, who, being in the outpost line, inflicted heavy casual-
ties and maintained all their posts, while all forward
troops were unanimous in their praise of the Divisional
Field Artillery, whose excellent shooting greatly contri-
buted to the final results.
That night the Battalion and Brigade boundaries
were slightly altered, the 42nd taking over an additional
500 yards on their left, the 43rd side-stepping 1,000 yards
across the Corbie-Bray Road and relieving the 40th Bat-
talion. For this purpose A Company was moved from
right support to the new sector, which was held with two
platoons in front and two in rear. Each company was
now responsible for supplying its own supports, C Com-
pany forming the Battalion Reserve.
The following days •were quiet and uneventful until
the night of April 1-2, when the 41st relieved the 43rd,
less A Company, who remained in its position and came
under command of the .Commanding Officer of the 41st,
the role of support then being taken over by the
remainder.
Bivouacs, dug into escarpments, formed the living-
quarters here, and after being roofed and revetted as a
protection against back-bursts, proved very satisfactory,
and were made comfortable by the addition of straw on
the floors. By day the troops rested and unproved their
“bivvies, ” occupying by night the hastily prepared sup-
port positions, and working on the construction of an
organised system.
On the night of the 3rcl-4th C Company relieved A,
who rejoined the Battalion in the support valley.
A German attack south of the Somme was launched
on the morning of the 4th, resulting in the capture of
Hamel and the high ground near the village, and as a
precaution the Battalion adopted its position in the sup-
port trenches until the afternoon, when the position
became quieter. In addition, the 104th Brigade (English
troops) were pushed forward to man defences along the
Somme Valley, thereby protecting the right flank of the
3rd Australian Division, close liaison being established.




Three days later the line was again taken over, two
platoons of the 41st remaining. A Company occupied its
old position north of the main road, with D centre and B
right, each being responsible for its own outposts, while
C Company, with the two attached platoons, were stationed
in reserve.
By now T the artillery defending the sector had been
greatly increased, and organised shoots •were arranged at
various hours during the night, while by day fire was
directed against known enemy defences.
Extreme darkness prevailed during the nights in
April, as evidenced by the fact that on three occasions
Bodies having unknowingly walked through the outpost
line were captured. To facilitate night movement, there-
fore, tapes were laid where landmarks were insufficient
to be utilised as guides.
Rations were nightly brought forward in limbers
from the Quartermaster’s Store that had moved to Bonnay
with the transport, which delivered them direct to the
companies, thereby proceeding much nearer the front line
than had been the practice in the more settled sectors in
Flanders.
Patrolling had taken an important part in the defence,
and was worked by strong parties under officers, making
lengthy reconnaissances of enemy posts and No Man’s
Land, in which excellent cover for movement existed in
the numerous escarpments.
The first organised raid, under Lieutenant W. H.
Green, was arranged for the early morning of the 14th,
a few hours prior to which the 41st had again taken over
the line, and the 43rd, less two platoons of C Company,
moved back to support. The operation, which was car-
ried out in conjunction with an artillery shoot, resulted in
the capture of one prisoner, from whom identification was
secured.
A quiet time was spent in this rear valley, the chief
incidents being the reconnaissance of systems recently
prepared by the Reserve and Labour Units, west of the
Ancre. The necessity for gaining a knowledge of these
defences w r as accelerated by prisoners’ statements to the
effect that an extensive attack was to be launched within
a few days. Should this prove successful on the flanks
it would necessitate the withdrawal of the 3rd Australian
Division.
As baths had been instituted in Bonnay, the Battalion
■was permitted to allow the absence of two platoons at a
time to take advantage of this establishment.
Normal relief was again carried out on the night of
the 19th-20th, C Company occupying the outpost line


south of the main road, with D Company, plus two
platoons of the 41st, right, A Company left, and B in
reserve. The first five days were comparatively quiet,
but early on the morning- of the 24th heavy enemy shell
tire was directed against the whole area, particularly from
the support line through the zone of guns to the village of
Bouuay, phosgene being liberally used against the battery
positions. Under cover of this, an unsuccessful minor
attack was launched against that part of the sth Austra-
lian Division, which had taken over the right sub-sector
of the 11th Brigade, north of the Somme.
The 41st again moved into the line that night, the
balance of the month being spent quietly in supports. A
move to a reserve position on the bank of the Ancre,
between Bonnay and Heilly, took place on the night of
May 1-2. The Battalion role here was that of reserve to
the 9th Brigade, who, now a three-battalion unit, had
relieved the 11th after its thirty-sis days’ continuous
trench life. A small amount of specialist training was
carried out, but the major portion of the time was spent
in recreation and resting until, on the 6th, the Battalion
moved to billets in La lloussoye, the 44th occupying the
evacuated position. After two days in this village, the
unit was allotted the Querrieu area, where satisfactory
quarters were obtained, and fourteen days ’ refitting, train-
ing, ceremonial, and recreation were indulged in, while
reconnaissance of rear defences was undertaken by a large
percentage of officers and non-commissioned officers.
Among the noteworthy events of the fortnight out of
the line was an inspection near Allonville by Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig (Commander-in-Chief), a practice alarm,
and a swimming carnival. Bombing planes by night and a
high velocity gun by day tended to disturb the rest so
badly needed after the long period in the trenches, and in
addition an outbreak of trench fever necessitated the
evacuation of a large number of men to hospital.
The middle of May ended the opening phase of the
Somme Campaign, the first forty-two days being spent in
the trenches, all of which had to be constructed by the
Brigade. The strain of constant expectancy of an enemy
attack proved severe on all ranks, while no relaxation in
the construction of defences could be allowed. During
the period spent in the line the general health remained
excellent, but once the tension was released the after
effects were clearly shown by the numbers that fell victims
to trench fever. Feeding throughout maintained a high
standard, additional food being purchased and salvaged
from the partly evacuated towns. The method adopted
for the supply of hot food to the Battalion in the line

Ist Cavalry Division.
My Dear Monash —
I was hoping to have come to see you when the battle allowed,
to thank you, your Brigadiers, E.A., and your Brigades, who were
alongside of my own Division, for your most valuable and encourag-
ing support and assistance, especially on the 30th March, when we
had a hard light to keep the Boehe out of our position. I was very
much struck by the courtesy of your officers in coming to see us
personally, and for your own and their keen desire to do everything
in their power to help.
As you know-, we have a curious collection of Units to assist
us, and it was a very real relief to know that you and your stout-
hearted fellows were on my left flank, and later on my right flank,
and that all worry was dispelled as to the safety of my flanks.
Your order for the placing of your heavy guns and batteries so as
to cover our front was of very real assistance, and, incidentally,
they killed a lot of Huns, which was much appreciated by us all.
Will you convey to all connected my own appreciation and that
of all ranks of the Ist Cavalry Division? It was a pleasure and an
honour to be fighting alongside troops who displayed such magni-
ficent morale. I only hope that we have the chance of co-operating
with you again under far more favourable circumstances.
G


We have been kept on the go, and are very busy trying to refit
at the same time, and have left your area for the moment, or I
should certainly have been myself to tender you our thanks and
congratulations.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) R. L. MULLINS,
Commanding Ist Cavalry Division.
Copy of Message sent by 11th Infantry Brigade to 43rd
Battalion.
The Divisional Commander wishes Colonel Farrell and the 43rd
Battalion to be congratulated on his behalf for the successful raid
carried out this morning by them. He hopes that this success will
be the forerunner of many similar successes by other battalions
of this Brigade. Identification is required, if possible, every 24
hours, and intended enemy action will then be in our possession,
and we shall be in a position capable of defeating same.
Translation of Extract from “Le Figaro,” of Friday,
May 10, 1918.
These Australians of General Birdwood’s are amongst the most
magnificent soldiers of the British Army. They are the famous
Anzacs of the terrible Battle of Gallipoli.
It is nearly four years since they left their distant land. And
what losses they have sustained. And not one single leave. But
their spirit has remained the same as during the first days of the
war. They would not have defended their own villages other than
they are defending ours. Our country has become theirs. All the
ideal nobility of our common cause dwells in the hearts of these
bronzed men, who have come from the Antipodes, and resemble the
warriors of the bas-reliefs of Egina.
They and their leaders, when spoken to of Amiens, repeat the
immortal words of the “poilus” of Verdun, “They will not pass! ’’




A GENERAL VIEW OF VELLERS BRETONNEUX.


CHAPTER XVI.
VILLERS BRETONNEUX.
Eeference Map: France, 62d, 1/40,000.
As only a short time out of the line could be allowed
the Division, preparations were soon in hand to move
forward again, on this occasion to the Yillers Bretonneux
Sector, which formed the right flank of the British Army
in France. Reconnaissance of the support position was
made on the 19th, the following day the Battalion leaving
Querrieu and marching to Blangy Tronville, where a few
hours’ halt -was made for tea, and continuing, for the
relief of the 14th Battalion A.I.F. in the Bois I’Abbe, at
night. This was the support position to the 41st Battalion
then holding the front line from Yillers Bretonneux to the
left flank of the French Army.
A and C Companies were located in the wood, B and
D being entrenched slightly in advance of it, while Bat-
talion Headquarters was stationed in the chateau on the
Amiens-St. Quentin Road. Owing to the thick under-
growth, traffic through the wood was difficult except by
means of the numerous tracks which converged to a
central point known as the “Clock Face.” At this time
of the year the trees were in full leaf, giving ample protec-
tion from the heat, and making the surroundings so
picturesque that it became hard to associate them with
war. A system of trenches ran through it and machine
gun posts commanded the various tracks. Some of the
large trees were utilised as observation posts, an excellent
view of the level ground towards Marcelcave being
obtained.
After the first night, working parties were supplied to
bury a signal cable from Brigade to the forward Head-
quarters, returning in time for ‘ ‘ Stand to ” at 3 a.m., as a
general attack was still considered probable.
The night of the 25th-26th will long remain in the
memories of those in the forward areas, as from 7 till 11
p.m. a heavy concentration of mustard gas was fired by
all calibres up to 8 in. on the sector from Cachy to the
northern end of the Bois I’Abbe. At 3 a.m. this was
repeated, remaining intense up till 6 a.m., and followed
by intermittent fire until late in the afternoon. The whole


area was thoroughly saturated with the volatile liquid,
which during the day, vapourised hy the warmth of the
sun, and although gas masks were utilised to their fullest
extent a very high percentage of casualties resulted. It
is estimated that about 15,000 shells fell on the Brigade
sector during these two heavy bombardments. Very few
Battalion cases arrived at the Regimental Aid Post
until late on the morning of the 26th, but from then until
the following afternoon the evacuations totalled about
200, 90 per cent, requiring eye treatment only.
Consequent upon these losses the Battalion was re-
organised into three companies, D being temporarily
absorbed by A, B, and C, enabling the formation of three
platoons in both A and B, and four in C Company. In
addition, preparations were made to occupy the front line,
a move forward being undertaken at 9.30 p.m. on the 28th,
and relief of the 41st Battalion, astride Millers Bretonneux,
completed four hours later. A Company right, and C left,
held the front line, being supported by B, while Battalion
Headquarters was located in a quarry on the main road
immediately west of the town. The flanks were held on
the north by the 42nd Battalion, on the south by the 3rd
Zouave Regiment (French troops), while opposed was a
part of the 108th Prussian Division.
An international post, consisting of one section each
of the 3rd Zouave Regiment and 43rd Battalion was estab-
lished on the army boundary, the object being to ensure
that close liaison and cohesion was maintained between the
two forces. Similar posts existed in the support and
reserve systems, and were all maintained at different times
by the 43rd. This was the first occasion on which the
French fighting methods and work had been witnessed by
the Battalion, and a general sense of appreciation was felt
for their soldierly qualities, whilst close comradeship
existed between all ranks.
The routine of the front line was that of normal
trench warfare, with active patrols operating nightly, the
improvement of defences, including wire, being constantly
effected.
Early on the morning of June 1, Lieutenant W. H.
Green, M.C., with a party of seventeen, raided the enemy
line near Monument Wood, with the object of securing
identification. Assisted by a light artillery fire and the
cover afforded by a crop in No Man’s Land, the raiders
moved close to the enemy parapet, where they laid up
while four pushed forward to locate the most favourable
point of entry. When on the parapet a “Very” light fired
from the trench showed the position to be strongly held,
so without hesitation these four rushed the post, signalling

to the others to follow. The resistance was so strong that
the party was forced to withdraw without securing any
identification, and meeting with heavy machine gun fire
while endeavouring to return. The officer was wounded,
while of his men one was killed, three wounded, and three
missing, one of whom was later reported a prisoner in
Germany.
Two days later, preceded by a short bombardment,
the enemy attempted a raid on A Company, but failed to
force an entry through the wire, being driven back by
bombs and Levis gun fire. When the situation became
quiet, scouts searched No Man’s Land and brought in
several rifles, two dead men, and one wounded Boche. All
badges and identification had been removed prior to their
capture, but their regiment w T as obtained from a letter
found on one of the dead men. Two casualties only were
inflicted by the Boche, both of which occurred in patrols
at that time returning from a reconnaissance.
The next night the 37th relieved the front line, the
43rd moving back to reserve trenches behind the Bois-De-
Blangy, where a quiet fortnight was spent, a small amount
of training being conducted until the 12th, when working-
parties were supplied for cable - burying* near Blangy
Tronville. Baths were obtained near the Tronville
Chateau and swimming in the Somme encouraged, while
the quiet times allowed of recuperation after the severe
gassing. A tank section, situated alongside this reserve
area, willingly explained and exhibited the working of
their mobile forts, receiving the fullest attention from
everyone.
By this time the expectancy of a general enemy offen-
sive in the Amiens Area had passed away, and a feeling
that the mastery had been gained by the Allies established
itself in the minds of all.
On the 22nd the support trenches were again occupied,
A and B Companies being stationed in advance of the
Wood, and C in its old position near the Clock Face,
relief of the 37th Battalion having been completed by
dusk. No incidents of note occurred, except that the
Commanding Officer received instructions that the 11th
Brigade was to take part in an offensive on Hamel early
in July, to prepare for which the unit was relieved by the
7th Brigade on the 27th, moving to the Allonville area
next day.
Casualties.
Although the Battalion was so little engaged in any
fighting, the losses in this sector were extremely heavy,
chiefly on account of the gassing. They amounted to: —

CHAPTER XVII.
THE BATTLE OF HAMEL.
Reference Hap: France, 62d, 1/40,000.
On June 25 instructions were received by the Com-
manding Officer that the 11th Brigade was to attack in
conjunction with the 4th and 6th Brigades, and straighten
out the line in the Hamel Sector. The 11th, with its left
flank on the Somme, was to utilise the 42nd, operating
from Bouzencourt, the 43rd to capture the village of
Hamel, the 44th leapfrogging through the 43rd and storm-
ing the high ground east of the town; the 41st was to
remain in reserve.
A very limited time was available for preparation, and
the utmost secrecy was strictly enforced, particulars being
supplied to Company Commanders only until as late a date
as possible. Reconnaissance was, therefore, undertaken
by the more senior and certain specialist officers before
withdrawing to the village of Cardonette, near Allonville,
where the bulk of the arrangements were conducted.
In addition to the straightening out of the line, the
intention was to test the co-operation of the various arms
of the service. An abundance of artillery was available,
most of which was to fire the barrage without having
previously registered, the counter-battery guns using an
extensive supply of gas for their work. A preponderance
of aircraft was to be used, the contact planes in the later
stages of the battle dropping boxes of ammunition by
means of small parachutes. The capabilities of the latest
type of tank were to be tested, and special supply tanks
introduced for the conveyance of material to forward
dumps. The noise of these monsters during their approach
was to be drowned chiefly by low-flying planes.
As the Brigade had not previously worked with tanks,
practices were given in advancing with them at their
training ground near Vaux en Amenois, where the troops
on the 28th gained an insight into their tactics and
methods of advance.
On receiving information that a company of Ameri-
cans would reinforce the Battalion, D Company was re-
formed with two platoons, leaving A, B, and C with three,
two, and three platoons respectively, and on B Company,


A FRENCH TRI-COLOUR FLAG ERECTED IN THE VILLAGE OF HAMEL BY
CAPT. J. T. MOHAN IMMEDIATELY ON THE CAPTURE OF HAMEL.




131st U.S. Regiment being attached, one platoon was
allotted to each company.
Following on the practice with the tanks, all officers
were acquainted with full details of the operation, wherein
they learnt that the Hamel Sector was to be occupied by
the 11th Brigade on the night of July 2-3, holding it until
the morning of the 4th, when the attack would commence,
the 43rd, manning 1,000 yards abreast of Hamel were to
attack with C, B, and A Companies, using D as a reserve.
The issue of equipment for the offensive, the finalising
of particulars, and the practising throughout the Brigade
of the assembly and advance, fully occupied the few avail-
able days, during which on one day a detachment of men
was required for an inspection by the Hon. W. M.
Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia. Owing to the vast
amount of preliminaries to be effected in so limited a
time it was impossible to enable men to secure as much
rest as was desired, but as the situation became known to
them they quickly appreciated the difficulties.
After the midday meal on the 2nd, the Battalion left
its billets at Cardonette and marched by platoons to the
Valley of the L’Hallue River, near Bussy, arriving in time
for tea, and remaining there until dusk. The secrecy of
the situation had apparently been well maintained, for
when moving through the area of a sister brigade en-
quiries were made as to why the unit was moving forward
and where it was going.
While waiting on the banks of the river many availed
themselves of the swimming facilities as a refresher after
the march from billets during the dusty afternoon. The
final issue of stores was also conducted here, and at 9.45
p.m. the approach march was resumed through Daours,
along the Somme Canal, to Hamelet, relieving the 51st
Battalion in the line during the early morning.
In addition to the normal clothing, web equipment,
ground sheet, and twenty-four hours’ reserve ration, each
man carried an extra day’s food, three sandbags, and
either a pick or a shovel, while the following were supplied
to the various branches: —
Bombers—loo rounds small arms ammunition and
eight bombs.
Lewis gun teams—lß magazines per section.
Signallers, runners, etc. —100 rounds small arms am-
munition and specialist material.
Riflemen—2oo rounds small arms ammunition and two
bombs.
As the 42nd and 44th Battalions were also positioned
in the forward area, a somewhat heavy concentration of
men was now situated on a sector that had for some time


been but thinly held, and lest unusual activity should raise
suspicion in the minds of the enemy, movement was
restricted to an absolute minimum, all but a few on watch
being encouraged to obtain a good day’s rest. When
darkness set in, however, activity prevailed, final pre-
parations and orders being executed. Transport supplied
a hot meal at 11 p.m., after which all were in readiness
to move on to the assembly line.
The day prior to leaving Cardonette two platoons of
B Company, 131st U.S. Regiment, were allotted for the
operation, in addition to those of B Company, but a few
hours before zero were withdrawn from the line, the
Battalion therefore attacking with its former organisa-
tion of fourteen platoons.
The assembly, under Lieutenant P. G. Tucker, com-
menced at midnight, companies filing on to the tapes and
laying up, A Company left and B centre in No Man’s Land,
in the vicinity of the front line, each with two platoons
of skirmishers, and the balance of the company in artillery
formation, D Company, in rear, adopting the latter Avith
all its platoons.
At two minutes past three on the morning of the 4th,
light harassing fire was opened, with the object of assist-
ing the aircraft in drowning the noise of approaching
tanks, and eight minutes later an intense barrage fire
opened, under cover of which the attack commenced. A
and C Companies’ inner flank lay on the outskirts of the
village, which, with the assistance of tanks, B Company
was to mop up. On the right trouble was soon encoun-
tered from a strong position known as “Pear Trench,” the
advance being temporarily held up until the brave action
of Private Shaw, who, with his Lewis gun, silenced several
enemy machine guns and enabled the company to again
move forward. On the left, A Company experienced
some sharp fighting in Notamel Wood, but with the
assistance of tanks, which overtook the forward troops
near the enemy’s front line, captured the Wood and
reached their objective, sending patrols into the village
to meet B Company as it moved through. In the mean-
time C Company, who first had sustained a number of
casualties on the assembly line from short falling shells
of the barrage, and had suffered at Pear Trench, was pro-
gressing favourably south of the village, and reached its
objective at the allotted time.
A ten minutes ’ halt was made here to enable the 44th
Battalion to leapfrog through and storm the high ground
east of the town.
B Company’s progress through Hamel was not delayed
by enemy resistance, as those in the ruins had obtained

refuge in the numerous cellars, which were quickly
picketed and cleared by the sections responsible for this
work, who secured a large number of prisoners from them,
and handed them over to D Company, whose duty it was
to escort them to the rear. On completing clearance of
the village a pre-arranged signal was fired, on which the
flank companies withdrew to the line of consolidation
north-west and south-west of Hamel, where half-platoon
posts were constructed, D and B returning to the old front
line.
Up to this time the retaliation by the enemy batteries
had been very limited, but as the day advanced and it
became evident that the attack was not to be continued,
a heavy fire was directed against the captured ground,
especially in and around the ruined town, where could be
seen a French blue, white, and red flag, that had been
carried into action with A Company and erected on a high
building by Captain J. T. Moran, Except for artillery
fire and aircraft activity, the balance of the day proved
uneventful. After consolidation, the assembly troops
were able to obtain some rest, while the reserve platoons
were engaged in salvaging, burials, and the construction
of communication trenches.
At 10 p.m., after enemy artillery and plane activity,
the S.O.S. signal was fired by the 44th Battalion, in
response to which the supporting artillery opened a con-
centrated shoot on the hostile positions. As a counter-
attack had been launched, and had succeeded in regaining
a portion of the lost trenches, A Company received an
urgent request to supply two bombing sections, which
took part in the re-establishment of the line, in which
operation fifty prisoners were captured. Later the balance
of the Company, less a nucleus of Lewis gun sections,
moved forward into close support, its position being occu-
pied by A Company of the 41st Battalion.
The balance of the night and the following day
remained normal, the construction of trenches, salvaging
and clearing up of the battlefield continuing. Prepara-
tions were also made for relief, which took place that
night, the remainder of the 41st Battalion relieving B, C,
and D Companies, the 44th releasing A, which withdrew'
under a heavy bombardment, but without sustaining
casualties. As relief was completed, companies moved to
a bivouac area near La Neuville, wdiere a hot meal and a
few hours’ sleep were obtained. Early next morning the
Americans rejoined their regiment at Daours, the Battalion
returning to Cardonette the same day.
Now that the battle w r as over, the full extent of the
success was realised by all ranks, wdio were able to more

clearly comprehend the workings of the various arms.
Tanks played a leading part in the victory, for their effect
was not only moral, but their six-pounder Hotchkiss and
machine guns successfully dealt with the enemy strong
points, which they then proceeded to flatten by moving
backwards and forwards over them. The dumps formed
by supply tanks saved an immense amount of man power
in carrying forward material. The aircraft at first main-
tained absolute command, their superiority being disputed
by the enemy during the later hours of the morning, but
by afternoon the British planes again predominated. The
boxes of ammunition dropped by contact machines also
assisted in resting the support troops and saved the neces-
sity of pack animals for its transport. Apart from one
battery of guns firing short, the barrage supplied was
excellent, and the neutralising of enemy artillery was
apparently most satisfactory, as for some hours after zero
very little retaliation was experienced. With the assist-
ance of trench mortars a dense smoke screen was formed
along the valley of the Somme and in the vicinity of the
village of Hamel.
The work of the signal sections was excellently con-
ducted throughout the whole of the operation, communi-
cation being maintained during the advance by lamp and
message rocket, and when consolidation was in progress
and lines laid to the new positions, telephonic connection
was established and kept intact until relief, the usual
strain thrown on runners thereby being reduced to a
minimum. Undoubtedly the secrecy enforced played a
most important part in the success of the day, which was
referred to by higher authorities as the “cleanest, slickest,
and cheapest operation ever executed by Australian
troops.”
The fighting qualities of the Americans favourably
impressed the Battalion, their dash and bravery leaving
nothing to be desired. It was their first time in the line,
and naturally they had a great deal to learn, and relied
on the experienced troops of. the Battalion for guidance.

Having returned to billets at Cardonette, the next
few days were spent in cleaning up, resting, and reorgani-
sation. A presentation of medals by Sir John Monash
was held at Allonville on the 9th, the Battalion parading
for the ceremony. Prior to moving forward again, a
dinner was arranged in the officers’ mess in commemora-
tion of the Battalion’s departure from Australia, among
the guests being the American officers who had worked
with the unit during the recent offensive.
On the 12th, Cardonette was evacuated, and the Bat-
talion moved to escarpments near Fouilloy, where the role
of reserve to the 3rd Australian Division was undertaken,
and quarters were prepared in the banks, being occupied
till the end of the month. A quiet period was enjoyed


here and a much-needed rest obtained, working parties to
Hamel being the only daily task.
On the 31st, the support position west of Hamel was
occupied after relief of the 35th Battalion, A and B being
the foremost companies, C support, and D reserve, with
Battalion Headquarters in the chateau at Yaire-Sous-
Corbie. The 42nd occupied the front line, with its left
flank on the Somme, north of which was held by the 34th
Eegiment (English troops).


CHAPTER XVIII.
THE OPENING OF THE GREAT OFFENSIVE.
Reference Map: France, 62d, 1/40,000.
On August 1 the Commanding Officer received infor-
mation from Brigade that a general offensive was shortly
to be launched on the Amiens front, when the Australian
and Canadian Corps, assisted on the flanks by English and
French Divisions, would attempt a penetration to a depth
of four to eight miles.
Of the 3rd Australian Division, the 9th and 11th
Brigades were to assault immediately south of the Somme
Canal, the 6th London Regiment operating north of the
River, and the 2nd Australian Division on the right flank.
The initial thrust was to include the zone of enemy guns,
the 4th Australian Division, with the sth on its right, was
to pass through and exploit the success. In the 11th
Brigade, the 42nd was to attack along the river as far as
Cerisy Gailly, while on their right the 44th was to capture
the high ground west of Cerisy Valley, the 41st, with one
company of the 43rd attached, leapfrogging through them,
clearing the valley, and consolidating on the rising ground
beyond it. The 43rd, with three companies, was to remain
in reserve.
Again, as in the Hamel Battle, secrecy was strictly
enforced, hurried preparations undertaken, and move-
ment restricted to the hours of darkness, planes policing
the area and reporting any excessive activity. For this
reason reconnaissance was reduced to a minimum, except
by night, when “jump off” lines and approach routes were
examined. A general view of the field of battle could be
obtained from the Battalion observation post, stationed on
the high ground above Vaire.
On the 4th, the 43rd was relieved by the 16th, and
moved by companies to escarpments between Corbie and
Bonnay, where for the next few days the issue of equip-
ment and full preparations for the offensive were com-
pleted, C Company coming under command of 41st and
remaining detached until the evening of the 10th. On

two occasion working parties were supplied for cable-
burying at Yaire Wood, remaining out most of the night
and resting by day. Apart from this duty, the three days
spent in this area were quiet, except at daybreak on the
• sth, when gas and high explosive were freely scattered in
the. vicinity, causing several casualties. This shoot was.
directed against the surrounding batteries in conjunction
with an attack launched by the enemy opposite Morlan-
court.
All arrangements were completed by the 7th, and
during the afternoon information was received that zero
would be at 4.20 next morning, so at 10.30 p.m. quar-
ters were evacuated and the approach march commenced,
A Company leading, followed by D, B, and Battalion Head-
quarters, the formation adopted being continuous single
file throughout. The route led through the outskirts of
Corbie, across the Somme at “D” Bridge, then by “D”
Track to the front line, passing on the northern side of
both Hamelet and Hamel. Prior to crossing the river the
Battalion was delayed for three-quarters of an hour to
allow the 41st and 42nd to push ahead, the march then
continuing steadily until 12.15, when 15 minutes’ rest was
given to allow the 42nd to increase its lead. The night
had so far remained exceptionally quiet, but on reaching
the vicinity of Hamel the enemy’s S.O.S. signal was fired
from the north of the river, fortunately bringing no
response on this Brigade’s sector, and by 3.40 the assembly
was completed, the Battalion lying up behind the 42nd
and in rear of the front line. The situation continued
quiet until 4.15, when the enemy opened a lively whizz-
bang shoot on the area, but although the shells were
falling among the companies, to the astonishment of all
no casualties resulted.
On the opening of the barrage this fire immediately
ceased and the assaulting troops commenced to push for-
ward, and as soon as. the 42nd was clear of the jump-off.
tape the 43rd moved diagonally to the line of advance,
making for the escarpments in the valley west of Record
Wood, where it was to wait until 5 p.m. Within
three minutes of zero a dense fog settled all over the
battlefield, and intensified by dust and the bursting of
smoke shells, made observation for more than a few yards
impossible. This naturally obliterated all landmarks,
compasses being the only means of maintaining direction.
As in the Hamel Battle, tanks were soon on the scene of
action, but their effectiveness was seriously curtailed by
the bad visibility which prevailed until 7 a.m., when it
slowly lifted and the whole field of operations came under
observation.
H


While the companies were waiting along the escarp-
ments patrols were pushed forward to ascertain, if pos-
sible, how the battle was progressing, returning with a
number of prisoners who . had been missed in the fog by
the assaulting troops. At the appointed time the valley
was vacated and by the guidance of compasses the Bat-
talion moved forward to its position of consolidation on
the spur south-west of Cerisy.
On the lifting of the fog the full extent of the battle
could more easily be realised, as along all the roads was
a continuous stream of artillery moving up to new posi-
tions, limbers containing stores for the forward troops,
and pack animals, the last of which were to operate with
the 4th Division in exploiting the success already
achieved. Moving across country could be seen fighting
and supply tanks and a few cavalry patrols, while many
parties of Boche prisoners being sent to the rear indicated
that all was progressing favourably.
Up to this time the enemy artillery response had been
very weak, the fire directed against them having effec-
tively neutralised their activity but, after the clearing of
the atmosphere, field batteries north of the Somme opened
a heavy direct shoot against the concentration of traffic
on the Brigade sector, and from their position it was
realised that the English troops on the left had not suc-
ceeded in reaching their objective. During the morning,
however, these guns were located and silenced by the
batteries recently brought forward, and except for
scattered shoots the balance of the day remained quiet.
After the Battalion completed consolidation of the
posts, the salvage of the captured material and burial of
men and horses were conducted, a rest then being obtain-
able throughout the night and following day, during which
time information of the great success of the day was
received, a penetration as far as German Corps Headquar-
ters at Framerville having been effected. During the first
morning transport carried rations to the companies, and
from then onwards supplied meals regularly from its
lines, now situated at Vaire. Telephonic communication
was established with Brigade and the three companies
soon after consolidation had commenced, and was main-
tained without difficulty until the Battalion vacated the
area.
C Company, who had been attached to the 41st Bat-
talion for the operation, acted as support, and moved
forward with it to a position in Cerisy Valley, reached
after an anxious advance through the fog and the capture
of a section of field howitzers and several machine gun
nests.


THE GREAT OFFENSIVE, August 8, 1918.


The casualties throughout the operation were excep-
tionally light, amounting to three killed and five wounded,
Avhile the captures totalled 100 prisoners, 25 machine guns
(including 10 heavies), one section of field guns, one anti-
tank rifle, and a large amount of signalling and other
material.
On the afternoon of the 9th the position north of the
Somme was improved by an attack that the 131st Regi-
ment of American troops launched, resulting in the cap-
ture of Malaard and Gressaire Woods, and the Chipilly
Spur, overlooking Btinehem, the Battalion witnessing it
from their trenches.
Consequent on the success achieved, the spirit of
the unit was excellent -when, on the evening of the 10th, it
■was ordered to Morcourt to operate with the balance of the
Brigade in clearing the village of Mericourt-Sur-Somme
and the high ground beyond it. The move forward was
greatly harassed by the activity of enemy bombing planes,
who paid particular attention to the Somme Valley, but in
spite of this, relief of the 16th Battalion was effected
without casualties, and the front line occupied by A, B,
and D Companies, with C, who had rejoined that evening,
in reserve. The following day was spent in posts opposite
Mericourt, machine gun and sniping activity abolishing
all unnecessary movement. At night the 41st Battalion
attacked and captured the Bray line of trenches, cutting
off the enemy in a pocket of the Somme.
At 4.30 on the morning of the 12th, under cover
of a medium trench mortar shoot on Mericourt, A Com-
pany of the 43rd pushed forward and occupied the high
ground north-east of the village, which B and D mopped
up without casualties, capturing prisoners and trophies
and recovering a British signaller who had walked into
the enemy lines the previous day. As the morning ad-
vanced, hostile batteries became active against the high
ground, w T ounding several men of the companies holding
it, and later in the afternoon C Company received orders
to fill a gap in the line between the river and the 42nd,
whose flank was on the Proyart-Bray Road. During the
approach it was subjected to a heavy high explosive and
gas bombardment, and although casualties were sustained
it successfully completed its allotted task, and once again
came under the command of the 41st Battalion.
The situation having been thus satisfactorily cleared
up, relief by the 7th Border Regiment was effected, the
Battalion moving back via Morcourt and Cerisy to a
bivouac area near Hamel, where six days’ rest was
obtained and refitting undertaken.

CHAPTER XIX.
THE ADVANCE NORTH OF THE SOMME.
Reference Maps: France, 62c and 62d, 1/40,000.
On the afternoon of the 18th an advance party left
Hamel to allot the positions for new bivouacs in the
vicinity of Gressaire Wood, being followed next day by
the balance of the Battalion, who moved by road at 3 p.m.
through Cerisy to Chipilly, where, during a halt for tea,
they were met by the guides, who led the companies to
their selected positions—A Company east of the Wood,
overlooking Etinehem, B and D on the western edge, with
C to the south of it, -while Battalion Headquarters was
situated in a quarry 500 yards in rear of D Company.
The 11th Brigade was now supporting the 9th, who
held the line opposite Bray-Sur-Somme, having the 18th
English Division on its left. Up to the 22nd, no tasks
were allotted to the Battalion until that morning, when
an attack -was launched by the 18th English Division and
the 9th Brigade, attempting to outflank Bray, and should
the resistance prove but slight it was intended to exploit
the success with the 11th Brigade, for which purpose the
Battalion assembled east of Tallies Wood at 7 a.m. On
the 21st Major A. W. Lott assumed command of the Bat-
talion in the field, maintaining this position until the end of
the month, Lieutenant-Colonel Farrell being indisposed.
The advance, which commenced at 4.30 a.m., brought
heavy retaliation on Gressaire and Tailles Woods, through
which all but A Company had to pass, suffering severely
in doing so, but succeeding in reaching the area, where
shelter was obtained by some in old trenches, the
remainder constructing new positions. No move forward
from this point was to take place until it was ascertained
by the front line troops if a further advance could be made
without artillery support, and so the balance of the morn-
ing was spent in waiting under a continuous fire of field
and heavy guns. .
In the late afternoon the transport brought forward
hot tea, which was served to all sections, whose apprecia-
tion was keen, for although engaged in no fighting the
strain of sitting under such a heavy concentrated fire,
combined with the heat of the day, had considerably
shaken them.


The attack in the morning having met with consider-
able opposition, it was improbable that any exploitation
would be undertaken. This was decided when, towards
evening the enemy counter-attacked and regained
from the English troops part of the area they had cap-
tured earlier in the day, the 9th Brigade maintaining its
ground, although badly harassed on the left flank, and
as a precaution the 11th Brigade was moved to a support-
ing position to the north-east of Tailles Wood, with the
object of protecting the northern flank of the Australian
Corps should the hostile thrust continue. Before dusk,
however, this attack was broken, and an English reserve
moved forward to cover their front line troops, and when
in position orders were issued for the 11th Brigade to with-
draw to the Gressaire Wood area. At 10 p.m. the 43rd
commenced the march back to the bivouac they had
vacated sixteen hours before, where the cooks were wait-
ing with a hot meal, after consuming which the troops
retired to their quarters for a sleep so needed after the
strain of the day, when the Battalion, although engaged
in no fighting, suffered casualties of three officers and
forty-six other ranks.
On account of these losses, reconstruction of com-
panies was undertaken and the maximum of rest allowed,
no work being conducted until the evening of the 24th,
when orders were received for a further attack, in which
the 11th and 10th Brigades would co-operate with the
3rd British Corps in an offensive north of the Somme. Of
the 11th Brigade, 43rd left and 44th right were to be used
for the assault, with the 42nd supporting, and the 41st
in reserve, while operating on the north was the 2/10th
London Regiment.
Following a Commanding Officers’ conference at Bri-
gade, the Battalion officers were called together at 6 p.m.
and full details of the work allotted made known, learning
that at 2.30 next morning, under cover of an artillery
barrage, the Battalion was to attack from the Bray-
Fricourt Road and storm the heights overlooking Ceylon
Wood. Immediate preparations were made for the com-
panies to move and assemble at a point east of Tailles
Wood, where guides, who were sent out to reconnoitre the
approach routes and jump-off line, would meet and lead
them to their respective sectors. The practice of relying
on units holding the line for guides had been discontinued,
reliable parties from the Battalion preferably being
despatched for previous reconnaissance and held respon-
sible for that work, the alteration proving more satisfac-
tory. The approach, as arranged, was effected in the
early hours of the morning, without enemy activity


harassing the movement, and greatly assisted by bright
moonlight the companies were settled on their assembly
line by 1.45 a.m., A right and C left, supported by D and
B respectively, Brigade Headquarters establishing itself
in a ravine 1,000 yards north-west of Bray.
At zero the attack was successfully launched, and
progress in accordance with the lifting of the barrage
effected, the objective being captured bj r 4 a.m., C and A
Companies firing success signals. Throughout the opera-
tion no opposition was encountered, three enemy only
being captured, the remainder having withdrawn earlier
in the night to a line of defence running east of Suzanne.
A dense fog again restricted observation until 8.30 a.m.,
by which time consolidation was well in hand and platoon
posts under construction. Patrols had been sent into
Ceylon Wood and returned with the information that
there were no enemy in occupation. During the later
part of the morning hostile artillery directed an inter-
mittent fire against the recently captured ground, paying
particular attention to the ridge north-east of Bray.
At 7 p.m. orders were received to continue the ad-
vance as a peaceful penetration, and consequently at 11
p.m. the Battalion moved forward under cover of patrols
and without artillery assistance through Ceylon Wood,
across the Suzanne Valley, on to the high ground beyond,
where hasty defences were constructed in face of opposi-
tion. During this night advance a thunderstorm, accom-
panied by extremely heavy rain, and a bleak wind, burst
over the battlefield, making conditions most unfavourable
for movement.
Shortly after daybreak a further advance was
ordered to be conducted on similar lines to those of the
previous evening, so at 8 a.m., preparations being com-
pleted, it was intended to commence the penetration, but
at the time enemy machine gun activity was so great that
the advance was delayed until 1.30 p.m. When the situa-
tion became quieter the troops pushed out to their objec-
tive, 400 yards beyond the jump-off line. On consolida-
tion, A and C Companies still occupied the foremost posi-
tions, while D was utilised to protect the northern flank
by swinging back from “N” Copse, B Company remaining
in reserve until nightfall, when 500 yards in front of A
and C it established strong outposts, which were in posi-
tion by 10 p.m. The task was not an envious one, as the
situation on the left was most unsatisfactory, conflicting
reports as to the location of the flank troops being received
from various sources, and on reaching the front line the
information in many cases was known to be incorrect.


That night the 41st Battalion, who up to this time
had been in reserve, leapfrogged through the 43rd, and
under cover of a barrage continued the attack at day-
break next morning. The hostile artillery reply was very
heavy, especially on the Suzanne Valley, through which
the 43rd had to file in its relief march to escarpments
north of Bray, where the next two days were spent
resting. The enemy in the meantime had been forced
back, so that on the 29th it was necessary for the Bat-
talion to move forward to keep in touch with the front
line troops, and at midday the first stage, to Vaux Wood,
was effected. During the nine hours spent in this posi-
tion, Lieutenant-Colonel J. Farrell again assumed com-
mand, and Major T. A. Ferguson joined the Battalion as
Senior Major. At 2 o’clock next morning, through pitch
darkness, a march to trenches east of Curlu was com-
menced, and on reaching the village, which, except for a
portion of the church, had been entirely demolished
during the fighting of 1915-16, guides were to meet the
Battalion and lead the companies to their respective
areas, but while resting on the western outskirts of it a
message delaying the move for four hours was received,
in consequence of which bivouacs were erected in the
immediate vicinity, shelter being obtained in escarpments,
trenches, and shell holes.
By the end of the month the enemy had been forced
back across part of the old 1916 battlefield to the vicinity
of Clery-Sur-Somme, the 11th Brigade again moving for-
ward as reserve to the Hindleg Wood area. That evening
instructions were received that at daybreak next morning
the Brigade was to take part in a general attack with the
object of clearing the Boche from a maze of old trenches
and defending the flank of Mont St. Quentin, which the
2nd Australian Division had captured on the 30th. The
43rd, 41st, and 42nd were to assault, with the 44th in
reserve, the right boundary of the 43rd being the Canal
du Nord, south of which the 2nd Australian Division was
operating. B and D Companies, supported by A and C,
was the order of the attack.
Owing to the short notice given, it was impossible to
make any reconnaissances, as two hours after receiving
instructions companies had to commence the approach
march, a difficult proposition, as the night was exceed-
ingly dark, the country absolutely unknown to them,
and the ground to be covered a network of wire and
trenches. In addition, the men were very tired after
their engagements of the 22nd, 25th, and 26th, and the
frequent moves throughout the month. • At 10 p.m. the


companies, whose total strength amounted to less than
200, left Hindleg Wood for the jump-off line, and after
an anxious and extremely arduous march reached the
assembly area in a most exhausted condition, and allowed
the 10th Brigade, who were holding the line, to withdraw.
Patrols were pushed forward to the Peronne-Bapaume
Road, which was to form the jump-off line, and discovered
that it was not held by the 10th Brigade as reported,
consequently at zero, 5.30 a.m., it was necessary to start
the troops from some distance west of it. Mont St.
Quentin and the ruins of Feuillaucourt had also been
regained by the enemy, although from information before
the attack they were held by the Australians. In addi-
tion to these setbacks, the barrage was scarcely to touch
this sector, on account of the converging advance of the
flank troops.
In the approach, the positions of A and B Companies
were reversed, so that the assault was launched by A and
D, with B and Cin support. On account of the defences
in Feuillaucourt, A Company in the very early stages
detached a portion of its troops south of the Canal to
assist the left of the 2nd Division and work round Peuil-
laucourt, which, together with a strong post on the bridge,
they succeeded in clearing after suffering casualties from
machine guns. Enfilade fire from Lewis guns was then
directed against the enemy posts that Avere holding up
the advance on the right. On pushing forward again,
heavy hostile fire from the high ground towards Mont St.
Quentin necessitated cover being sought 300 yards east
of the bridge. That part of the company which operated
north of the Canal also encountered strong opposition
from machine guns towards Allaines, and was held up
on reaching Rollin Trench, in which shelter was obtained,
two patrols being then sent across to obtain touch with
the left company.
D Company in its attack first met opposition imme-
diately east of the main road, -where two machine gun
posts were mopped up, and, gradually overcoming further
resistance, reached Zimmermann Alley and Kassa Trench,
a small party progressing still further to Scutari Trench,
the objective, where, greatly outnumbered, they were
overcome. C Company advanced in close liaison with D
and succeeded in establishing itself in Zimmermann
Alley and surrounding shell holes. As the morning
progressed B Company sent out a patrol along the Canal,
but was unable to achieve any success, so later attempted
to push along Boeseler Alley, but realised that progress
would be too costly without support from artillery or
trench mortars, neither of which were procurable.


THE ADVANCE NORTH OF THE SOMME.


THE ASSAULT OF SCUTARI TRENCH.


Throughout the morning the 2nd Prussian Guards
Reserve Division, the opposing troops, continued to main-
tain a stubborn defence, so harassing the whole area cap-
tured by the Battalion that all movement above ground
was reduced to a minimum, the tire being directed from
the Mont St. Quentin Ridge, Allaines, and the high ground
north of that town.
At 1.30 p.m. the 2nd Australian Division launched,
after a heavy bombardment, a successful attack against
Mont St. Quentin, clearing the town and establishing
itself to the east of it. This move considerably
reduced the fire on the Battalion sector, and enabled
the scattered troops to be connected and reorganised, so
that at night the positions of the four companies were —
A, Rollin Trench, with a post in the Canal; B, Poinsot
Trench; C, Zimmermann Alley; and D, Kassa Trench,
while a company of the 44th had moved forward to reserve
and came under command of the Commanding Officer of
the 43rd Battalion. After the extremely heavy day the
hot meal brought forward by the transport at dark was
very acceptable, and at the same time further supplies of
bombs and ammunition were issued.
Before morning the 41st and 42nd had been relieved
by a portion of the 74th British Division, the 43rd remain-
ing to co-operate at daybreak in an attack to complete the
task set out for the morning of the Ist, one platoon of
the 41st being attached to assist D Company. The Bat-
talion’s immediate objective w T as again Scutari Trench,
while the ground lying between it and the Canal was also
to be cleared. As on the previous day, the artillery
operated on the flanks of the sector, and very little pro-
tection was afforded to this Battalion, but shortly after
daybreak, in conjunction with the main attack, companies
moved forward to assault, A working along Boeseler
Alley and attacking Graz Trench in a south-easterly direc-
tion, then driving the enemy towards Piume Trench. B
traversed Boeseler Alley, and when near Usler Trench
gave covering fire for C, who had pushed along Zimmer-
mann Alley and the sunken road leading to Allaines,
entering Usler Trench from the south and driving the
enemy northwards, D attacking overland and along the
communication trench captured Scutari Trench and drove
a number of Boches into Piume.
By the above tactics the defenders were forced into
a small network of trenches near Allaines, and still con-
tinued to offer strong resistance until Temporary Corporal
L. C. Weathers, by a brave act, for which he was awarded
the Victoria Cross, captured the garrison, numbering 180,
and many machine guns. Small batches of prisoners had

been collected by the other companies, and the objective
cleared of all resistance at 7 a.m.
The flanks in the meantime had made satisfactory
progress, meeting as arranged 1,000 yards north-east of
Allaines and pinching out the 43rd Battalion, who cleared
up Allaines and the ground in front of their objective to
the point of junction. Necessary precautions were taken
against shell fire, and the men settled down for a rest, but
by midday a part of the 74th Division withdrew across
their front, and again left them as front line troops, which
they remained until relieved by the 44th Battalion late
in the night of September 2-3, A, C, and D withdrawing
to Clery-Sur-Somme Valley, B moving in reserve for the
44th, until at 10 a.m. it rejoined the Battalion.
Hot meals were issued here and a small amount of
rest obtained, and at 7 o’clock a further withdrawal to
Memsey Wood was undertaken, blankets issued, and
bivouacs in old trenches prepared.
For the various operations undertaken about 350
prisoners, chiefly Prussian Guards, and 40 machine guns
were captured, together with a large amount of other
material, which the condition of the men did not permit
to be collected by this Battalion.

AN ARTILLERY TEAM “WIPED OUT” ON THE SOMME.


CHAPTER XX.
OPEN WARFARE.
Reference Map: France, 62c, 1/40,000.
After the operations of Scutari Trench, Major T. A.
Ferguson assumed command of the Battalion during the
absence on leave of Lieutenant-Colonel J. Farrell, and
held that position for the remainder of September. Under
his supervision, arrangements were commenced for a stay
of ten days in the vicinity of Memsey Wood, baths and
pay being available on the 4th, while the improvement of
shelters and the reorganisation of the Battalion into three
companies, A, B, and D, were also undertaken.
That night information was received that the enemy
was believed to be carrying out an extensive retirement,
and that the 3rd Australian Division would probably be
called upon to keep in touch with his rearguards, in which
case the 11th Brigade, together with the 3rd Pioneer Bat-
talion, would form the advance guard, using the 42nd and
44th as vanguard. No further instructions arrived until
next day, when at 11 a.m. orders were received to prepare
to move, and at 2 p.m. the bivouacs were evacuated and
the whole Battalion, including transport, Quartermaster’s
department, and Orderly Rooms, proceeded via Clery and
Feuillaucourt to Mont St. Quentin, a tiring march through
clouds of dust raised by the stream of traffic moving for-
ward, and having gained touch with the 42nd and 44th,
a halt was called at dusk, and a meal issued from the
cookers. This position was maintained throughout the
night, but at daybreak on the 6th the advance commenced,
the 42nd and 44th pushing forward, supported by the
43rd and 3rd Pioneer Battalions respectively, passing
over the Bth Brigade, who were holding the line in that
sector, and continuing to progress throughout the day
in conjunction with the 74th Division on the left. By
night the 42nd had reached Tincourt Wood, with the
43rd supporting them at Buire Wood, its transport posi-
tioning itself at Red Wood and supplying the com-
panies with two hot meals. This was the Battalion’s first
experience in open warfare, and the conditions were found
to be vastly different from the trench life and attacks
with limited objectives, but all branches quickly accus-
tomed themselves to the frequent moves and more exten-
sive operations, close co-operation being maintained
between the fighting and non-combatant sections.


OPEN WARFARE.


The second day’s advance commenced at 6 a.m., and
after quietly following up the 41st, who had relieved the
42nd during the night, the Marquaix Spur was reached
in the early afternoon, and as the vanguard did not make
further progress that night positions were adopted here.
This move was undertaken in three stages, halts being
temporarily made in the valley leading north from Tin-
court and Hamel to allow the forward troops to regain
their lead. Transport again delivered two hot meals to
the companies, who spent a quiet night in huts and escarp-
ments situated on the spur. During the hours of dark-
ness the 41st Battalion was relieved by a portion of the
10th Brigade, the 43rd then coming under command of
that Brigade.
As the 3rd Division had now penetrated deeper than
the 74th, it was decided to protect the flank by placing
one battalion along the northern boundary, the 43rd being
allotted this task, and moving to the high ground north
of Roisel, where it consolidated to command the valleys,
and maintained this position until the following morning,
when the 74th Division, having advanced, the Battalion
withdrew, a halt being made for breakfast in the old area
north of Marquaix, and later marching to hutments at
'Courcelles, which was to form the unit’s home for some
weeks.
Communication throughout these operations formed
a difficult and most important branch of the work, and
as the situation was one of constant movement, telephonic
connection was impossible, Lucas lamp and runners having
wholly to undertake the despatch of messages. The hilly
country was eminently suitable for the use of the lamp,
as a careful selection of stations enabled constant touch
to be kept between the companies and Battalion Head-
quarters.
The transport, under the able command of Lieutenant
T. R. Brennan, maintained throughout the. four days a
very close liaison with every part of the Battalion, so that
when rations and stores were to be delivered there was
no difficulty in locating the troops.
The Battalion’s task in support had not been a diffi-
cult one, nor had heavy fire been experienced, the only
casualty that occurred being an accidental injury. Great
care was exercised before touching any captured article,
as the enemy in his retirement had left a number of booby-
traps and mines, which exploded on the slightest inter-
ference.
Until the Bth the weather remained fine and warm,
but thunderstorms, accompanied by heavy rain, prevailed
the last two days, making the conditions for movement


somewhat difficult, especially to men who were so badly
in need of a rest. Bach one carried fighting order, con-
sisting of rifle, equipment, ground sheet, 150 rounds of
ammunition, and reserve rations, a lighter burden than
usually borne in offensive work.
The period of relief at Courcelles enabled the Bat-
talion to secure the rest so much needed after the
extremely heavy work engaged in since the opening of
the offensive on August 8, it having co-operated in ten
attacks and moved no less than 22 times in 31 days, the
longest period spent in one area being seven days. Practi-
cally every move necessitated the construction of new
quarters so that, apart from the fighting and marching,
a large amount of manual labour was essential. The
strength actually with the Battalion decreased in the
meantime from 45 officers and 610 other ranks to 33 and
461, the same duties devolving on the unit in its weakened
state as when nearer its full strength.
The work undertaken at Courcelles was to reorganise
so that the greatest efficiency could be developed from
those who remained and to sufficiently rest and fit them
for the next engagement in which they should be called to
operate. The area was free from shelling except for the
occasional fire of high velocity guns mostly directed
against the Cologne Valley, while at night slight bombing
activity tended at times to disturb the rest, but, for-
tunately, no casualties resulted. The four companies were
re-formed and training undertaken when weather per-
mitted, while each evening pierrot concerts were given by
Brigade and Divisional troupes at Doingt. Recreation
also occupied a portion of each day, football matches
frequently being arranged and cricket practice carried
out, while on the 21st Brigade Military and Athletic
Sports were contested, at which the Battalion secured
eleven first prizes. By these methods the condition of the
men gradually improved, but they still remained far
from fit.




THE CANAL TUNNEL, HINDENBURG LINE, SOMME.


CHAPTER XXI.
BREAKING THE HINDENBURG LINE.
Reference Maps: France, 62c, 62b, and 57b, 1/40,000.
As was anticipated, about the end of September
orders were received to again proceed to forward areas to
participate in the attack, the object of which was to break
the defences of the Hindenburg Line. On the evening of
the 27th, therefore, the camp at Courcelles was evacuated
and the Battalion moved by platoons, via Tincourt and
Roisel, to Templeux la Guerard, the transport, less cookers,
establishing itself at Villers Francon. The Battalion had
again been organised for the operation into three com-
panies, A, B, and C, each with three platoons of twenty-one
men, and remained throughout the 28th in the bivouacs,
where they were worried somewhat by the fire of high
velocity guns, necessitating the movement of part of the
troops to the shelter of a sunken road. That night details
of the operation were promulgated in brief, being as fol-
low : —The 3rd and 4th Armies, together with the French
troops on the right, were to attack at 5.50 a.m. on the
29th, and endeavour to capture the Hindenburg Line. On
the front affecting the 3rd Australian Division, the 27th
American Division was to assault between Le'Catelet and
Bellicourt, and their success was to be exploited by the
10th and 11th Brigades, similar operations being con-
ducted on the flanks. The 11th Brigade, on the right,
was to use the 41st and 44th Battalions as advanced
troops, with the 43rd in close support to the 41st, in order
to later extend to a three Battalion front, the 42nd re-
maining in reserve.
As the attack had been successfully launched on the
29th, the Battalion, after being given a hot breakfast, left
its bivouacs at 7 a.m. and marched by platoons in file for
Benjamin Post, shelling making it necessary to divide
into sections before reaching that point. The 41st Bat-
talion was approximately 500 yards ahead throughout the
approach. Unfortunately, the American troops,
in their advance, failed to “mop up” the area
as they progressed, the result being that secreted
machine gunners adopted their battle positions
after the first waves had passed by them and
turned their guns against the backs of those troops
moving forward, inflicting severe losses. Consequently,
(117)


on the exploiting units moving up they unexpectedly came
under a heavy machine gun fire while still in artillery
formation, and were forced to take cover. By 9.30 a.m.
the 43rd had positioned itself in trenches in the vicinity
of Benjamin Post, and as it had not been intended to use
the 11th Brigade for any protracted fighting so early in
the operation this area was held by them until night.
About thirty Americans were collected during the day.
and remained attached to the Battalion, reinforcing its
various platoons until the following afternoon, when they
were recalled to a collecting position in the rear. The
occupied area was subjected to heavy high explosive bom-
bardment all day, and little movement above ground was
advisable.
After a hot meal supplied by the transport, the Bat-
talion at 8 p.m. moved forward, in conjunction with the
41st, for a distance of about 800 yards to the vicinity of
Triangle Trench, the advance taking place through a
drizzling rain and intense darkness. Orders were issued
for a revised attack, in which the 11th Brigade was to
capture Bony from the south. For this operation the
41st Battalion, who had suffered heavily during the morn-
ing, was withdrawn, and the 33rd and 35th attached in its
place. To prepare for this engagement the 43rd moved,
first towards Malakoff Farm, and then to trenches south-
east of Quennemont Farm, where touch with the 41st and
42nd was obtained. As the proposed attack had been
cancelled, the Battalion worked its way up Top Lane,
clearing this trench by means of bombs, and capturing the
enemy post therein, and by 7 a.m. on the 30th had reached
the Hindenberg Line, where with the assistance of one
company of the 44th the advance was gradually continued
in a northerly direction, B and the attached 44th Company
working along the support and A the front line, leaving C
in reserve, so that by 1 p.m. the famous trench had been
cleared to within about 600 yards of the strongly-fortified
village of Bony. A trench mortar from the town that
was causing considerable annoyance to/the Battalion was
effectively silenced by two snipers, who crawled forward
along the sunken road towards the village, the gun being
captured next morning.
In the afternoon heavy enemy shell fire from field
and 5.9 batteries was directed against the advanced posts,
necessitating their withdrawal after having suffered
several casualties. Under cover of this bombardment,
enemy troops moved along the trenches and by the free
use of grenades forced back the garrison of one of the
posts, whose bombs had been exhausted, but on further
supplies being obtained the post was captured, and at dusk


THE HINDENBURG LINE.


bombing blocks were constructed, and no further enemy
advance was made. The transport again succeeded in
bringing forward another hot meal, and a further supply
of bombs and ammunition, while a large number of enemy
stick grenades, of which hundreds were lying around,
were collected and later used against the Hun. Enemy
shelling slackened during the night, which again was
accompanied by drizzling rain.
Up to this time it was not known what had become of
the American troops who attacked on the morning of the
29th, no information of them having been received, except
that one air report stated having seen a few of them on
their objective. It was, therefore, impossible to obtain
any artillery support, as the gunners were afraid of shoot-
ing into their posts. Furthermore, no tanks were avail-
able, as those allotted to the sector had all been put out
of action, twelve of them lying in the vicinity of Quenne-
mont Farm.
Before daylight on October 1, the company of the
44th that had been operating with the Battalion the pre-
vious day rejoined its battalion, by which time the flanks
of the 43rd were held on the left by the 33rd and on the
right by the 44th. At 8 a.m. it was observed that the
enemy appeared to be evacuating the village of Bony and
the Canal tunnel to the east of it, so that patrols were
pushed forward along the main trench with the object of
investigating this withdrawal. The 42nd and 33rd Bat-
talions were notified of this move and asked to co-operate
in an advance on the position. Following the patrols, the
43rd moved north along the trench, and at 9 a.m. entered
and occupied Bony, one company of the 42nd forming up
on the canal on the right flank. Shortly afterwards the
10th Brigade and the 33rd Battalion moved up as far as
the canal, and the 43rd disposed itself along the tunnel,
with C Company left and B right, supported by A. That
afternoon instructions were received that the 42nd and
33rd Battalions, supported by the 44th and 43rd respec-
tively, were to advance to the Masnieres-Beaurevoir line,
but shortly after starting the operation was cancelled, an
outpost line along the high ground east of the canal being
established by the 42nd and 33rd Battalions, while the
43rd remained in its old position along the canal. That
night, under heavy fire, another hot meal and further
stores were supplied, the following day being spent in
cleaning the sector and burying the British, American, and
German dead. Only two or three prisoners were captured,
but a very large number of enemy were killed, a count on
the 2nd locating 120 Hun bodies. A large amount of
material was captured, most of which had to be left on the

area, as the facilities for transport of it did not permit
its removal.
Relief by the King’s Royal Rifles was effected that
night, the Battalion returning to Templeux la Guerard,
where bivouacs were established and occupied until the
following day.
The fighting in this operation, the last in which the
Battalion was engaged, had been of a peculiar nature, the
situation remaining obscure throughout. The actions con-
sisted of clearing the trenches with bombing parties, and
without the support of tanks or artillery, gradually feeling
forward along the wide and deep trenches of the Hinden-
burg Line, in which were situated a large number of dug-
outs, mostly about 30 feet deep and containing at least
two rooms. The defences of the system were largely
strengthened by dense and numerous belts of barbed wire
entanglements, behind which concrete machine gun posi-
tions had been built in such a way that fire from them
could enfilade the attackers on reaching the wire.
Communication throughout was maintained chiefly
hy runners and Lucas lamp, the situation not admitting
of telephonic connection. The work done by the trans-
port is worthy of the highest praise, rations, ammunition,
bombs, etc., in sufficient quantities being successfully
delivered to the line troops each night, mostly through
heavy artillery fire and over shell-torn ground. Cooking
was done at Templeux la Guerard, and the hot food con-
veyed forward by limbers.

CHAPTER XXII.
BELIEF.
Reference Maps: Amiens, 1/100,000; Dieppe, 1/100,000.
The 3rd Division having been relieved, the 43rd Bat-
talion on the 3rd withdrew to an area south-east of Aize-
court Le Haut, where bivouacs were erected and main-
tained till 10 a.m. on the sth, when a march was made to
Peronne, and the Battalion entrained for back areas,
leaving at 4 p.m. for Airaines, which was reached late at
night, after passing through Villers Bretonneux and
Amiens. Billets had been allotted in the village of
Metigny, about three kilos from the detraining point, and
were reached by 12.30 a.m. on the 6th, all sections being
quickly settled for the night, a readjustment taking place
later in the day. This was the commencement of the long-
hoped-for rest in back areas, and none can say that it was
not well earned. Since moving from Selles the Battalion
had never been away from shell-fire, and apart from
operating in 11 attacks had spent 40 days in the front line,
42 in support, and 109 in reserve, during which time its
strength, in spite of reinforcements from base, had de-
creased from 42 officers and 855 other ranks to 37 officers
and 420 other ranks. After adopting the defensive posi-
tion on March 27, an aggressive policy had been main-
tained up to the end of April, when the Battalion was
withdrawn from the line. The early part of May was
devoted to resting, prior to entering the Villers Breton-
neux Sector, where the severe gassing reduced the strength
by over 200, and so affected the remainder that it was
necessary to withdraw them to a reserve position, which
was held till the early part of June, when the line was
again taken over. During the Division’s second rest on
the Somme, the Battalion was engaged in the offensive on
Hamel on July 4, but was not required to move further
forward than reserve for the remainder of the month.
From the opening of the second Battle of Amiens on
August 8, till the breaking of the Hindenburg Line at the
end of September, practically no effective rest was
obtained, the short snatches allowed only enabling the
men to temporarily regain sufficient strength to carry
them through the next operation.
It stands to reason, therefore, that the work given in
back areas did not consist of heavy training, but, as was the


INTERNATIONAL POST, VILLERS BRETONNEUX, WHERE THE BRITISH AND FRENCH ARMIES JOINED (SEE CHAPTER XVI.).




case after the Battle of Ypres, the foremost consideration
was to rest and reorganise the Battalion, followed, after a
few days, by light exercises and recreational training. As
the strength and spirit gradually recovered, military
training was correspondingly increased, for it had to be
realised that at any time the Battalion might be called to
the forward areas, and that efficiency must therefore be
maintained, although the drill and parade ground exer-
cises had become very irksome after so long a period in
the battle zone.
The village of Metigny was a small and dirty place,
wherein a very poor type of billets was obtainable, so that
on October 21, after the dissolution of the 42nd Battalion,
its village, Yergies, was taken over by the 43rd, providing
far more suitable accommodation and possessing environ-
ments far superior to those of Metigny.
It was while at this new village that the Armistice was
signed, the Battalion being engaged in firing on the open
range on the eventful day, but received no definite infor-
mation of the cessation of hostilities until the arrival of the
daily papers for the 12th, a holiday being given next day
to celebrate the occasion.
From then onwards the hours of training were
diminished and combined with the educational scheme
that had been instituted for the purpose of preparing the
soldiers for their civil occupations, these classes growing
until they formed the chief work of the Battalion, em-
bracing practically all branches of trades and professions,
either within the unit, at Corps Schools in France, or
private enterprises in England.
It was thought that the 3rd Division was to move
forward to the Charieroi-Namur area with the balance of
the Corps, but after several changes of plans, orders were
received to remain in the Abbeville area, a new allotment
of billets becoming necessary, the readjustment allocating
the 43rd Battalion the village of Ramburelles, where
quarters were to be occupied until demobilisation, exten-
sive improvements being carried out to permit of the
greatest possible comfort during the tedious months of
waiting for return to Australia.
After settling down in new quarters, arrangements
were made for the Christmas dinner that was to be held
in the marquee erected on the village reserve, the meal
consisting of turkey, ham, vegetables, plum pudding, wine
and beer, being served on the afternoon of the 25th, officers
and sergeants acting as waiters. As on the previous
festive occasion, the expense of the dinner was borne by
proceeds of the labours of the 43rd Trench Comforts
Society of South Australia.


On the arrival at Ramburelles, the inhabitants
exhibited a general hostile attitude towards the Battalion,
and were unwilling to assist in any way towards the com-
fort of the men, but by tactfully handling the situation
this opposition was gradually overcome, and by early in
January the citizens were only too anxious to assist as far
as their limited means would permit. In order to maintain
health, discipline, and fitness, a limited amount of drill
was still undertaken, while recreation formed a very large
portion of the daily routine, cross-country runs, football,
or 'walking matches taking place each day when weather
permitted. For the purpose of occupying the long winter
evenings, indoor games, cards, draughts, and chess w T ere
run on organised lines, lectures and discussions were
arranged, and concert parties and pierrot troupes pro-
cured when available, while the addition of warm Nissen
huts and fires in billets enabled a certain amount of com-
fort to be secured during the cold spells of weather, when
the ground for days was frozen hard. One of the huts
was utilised as a reading-room, copies of the leading Eng-
lish papers being available, and in addition a library was
formed, containing historical and instructive books, as
well as novels.
Except for a slight outbreak of influenza, the epidemic
that prevailed so severely all over Europe in November,
the health of the Battalion had been remarkably good
since its departure from the forwmrd zone, the numbers of
sick parade daily averaging far less than during any pre-
vious period in back areas.

Meanwhile the preparations for demobilisation pro-

order of precedence, the return to Australia having been
arranged on the draft system, thereby necessitating the
splitting up of the Battalion in France.
At the time of writing the first quota of 190 was
expected to leave in the middle of March.

APPENDIX I.
CALENDAR AND DIARY.
N.B.—ln compiling this sketch of the incidents
occurring each day, it is necessary, to avoid repetition,
that the following points should he observed in reading
it:—(1) That the situation where the Battalion camped
each day is stated immediately after the date, and that it
remained there until a new position is given later; (2)
that the incidents of the day are then recorded; (3) that
the strength of the Battalion, where available, is then
printed in parentheses, thus (0., 1; 0.r., 759), the letter o.
indicating officers and o.r. other ranks; if strength is not
available, the letters n.a. will indicate that fact, and is to
be understood as applying until figures are inserted; (4)
when casualties occur, the number is indicated imme-
diately after strength, i.e. (0., 37; 0.r., 750; o.k. 1, o.w. 1,
0. 1, o.r.w. 14). This would read as follows:—Strength
—officers, 37; other ranks, 750; casualties—officers killed
1, officer wounded 1; other ranks killed 1, other ranks
wounded, 14; and (5) that the Battalion’s Headquarters
is given at the end of each day’s record, and remains the
same until another name is indicated.

APPENDIX IV.
NOMINAL ROLL OF OFFICERS.
The following list is compiled from records and information
available within the Battalion in December, 1918, and January, 1919,
and its accuracy in connection with several dates is necessarily
approximate only, as the absence of the person concerned and the
difficulty of procuring information from the base has demanded the
inclusion of approximates in preference to leaving a blank where
such defects occur.
Where the "Date Leaving” column contains a dash, the
officer was with the Battalion or on its strength on December 31,
1918.
The following is a key to the abbreviations used throughout
the appendix;—O., Original Officer; 8., Beinforeement Officer; D.,
Direct Commission in the Field; C., Cadet Battalion; 5.0.5., Struck
off Strength; P.S.L., Permanent Supernumerary List; 5.1. C., Second
in Command; C. 0., Commanding Officer (Battalion Commander);
0.G., Officer Commanding (Company Commander); M., Married;
5., Single or Sick; W., Widower; K.1.A., Killed in Action; T. 8.,
Training Battalion; A.G.8.D., Australian General Base Depot;
0.T.8., Overseas Training Brigade; P.C., Platoon Commander;

APPENDIX V.
ROLL OF HONOUR.
In all cases where men have not been buried in Military
Cemeteries, a map co-ordinate indicates the resting-place of the
deceased. At the time of publication, arrangements were in hand
for the exhumation of all bodies in scattered and isolated graves
and their reinterment in Military Cemeteries.
When this task is completed, the map co-ordinates will no
longer stand, except in cases where graves cannot be identified;
but a notification of the new burial place will doubtless be for-
warded to the deceased’s next-of-kin.
Of the Military Cemeteries in the forward zone, the following
is an approximate location of their whereabouts: —
Flanders. Strand. Ploegsteert Wood, near Messines.
Daours. Village on the Somme.
Heilly Station. Between Bonnay and Heilly on the
River Anere.
Flanders. Tancrez Farm. 1,000 yards North-East of Le Bizet,
Flanders.
Flanders. Betlheem. 700 yards South-East of Messines.
Morcourt. Village on the Somme.
Flanders. Cite Bonjean. Armentieres.
Flanders. Mud Corner. Ploegsteert Wood.
Sailly Laurette. Village on the Somme.
Flanders. Underhill Farm. Ploegsteert Wood.
Flanders. Trois Arbres. One and a quarter miles East-North-East
of Steenwerok.
Bois-l’Abbe. Chateau 1,000 yards West of Villers
Bretonneux.
Longeau. Village on the Somme near Amiens.
Flanders. Berkshire. Ploegsteert Wood.
Flanders. Kandahar Farm. 800 yards South-West of Wulverghem.
Flanders. 44th Casualty Clearing Station (Nine Elms). Three-
quarters of a mile West of Poperinghe.
Querrieu. Village on the River L’Hallue.
Vaux-Sur-Somme. Village on the Somme.
La Neuville. Near Corbie, on the Somme.
Where burials have been made in communal (civilian) ceme-
teries, the location is procurable from town authorities.

CASUALTIES, PRISONERS, MATERIAL CAPTURED,
AND COMPARATIVE GRAPHS.
CASUALTIES.
For the purpose of more closely examining the casualties, the
chart showing the days spent in front, support, and reserve posi-
tions should be studied and compared with it, careful reference
being made to the periods spent in the various zones.
The grand total of casualties (1,774) includes killed and
wounded, many of the latter being more than once wounded.


PRISONERS LOST.
Of the prisoners lost to the enemy, the following information
regarding their capture is given:—
On the night of June 28, 1917, after relief of the front line
trenches, the first man was lost to the enemy. The defences in
this sector did not consist of continuous lines, but were arranged
in a series of posts. The missing man had never been in the line
before, and consequently was strange to the surroundings. He was
last seen moving from the support to the front line, and it is
believed he passed between the forward posts and walked into
enemy territory.
The second was captured during the Battle of Warneton, during
a successful enemy counter-attack on July 31, 1917, in which the
Windmill post was regained, and where the missing man was
stationed.
He has since been repatriated to England.
The third was lost during a raid at Yillers Bretonneux on the
enemy trenches, undertaken on the night of May 31, 1918. The
party encountered superior numbers of the enemy, who strongly
opposed the entry into their post; four of the party succeeded in
entering, two of whom were killed and a third remained a prisoner
in their hands. He has also been repatriated.

APPENDIX VII.
STORIES OF SOME LATE MEMBERS OF THE
BATTALION.
BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL J. FARRELL, D.S.O.
LANCE-CORPORAL LAWRENCE CATHAGE WEATHERS, V.O.
On September 2, 1918, near Haut Allaines, on the Canal-du-
Nord, Lance-Corporal Weathers was one of an advanced bombing
party operating well forward of our attacking troops.
Just before the attack reached its final objective it was held
up by the enemy, who occupied a trench in large numbers. After
an hour’s continuous fighting Weathers went forward alone and
located a large body of the enemy. He immediately attacked the
Huns and killed the senior officer (a major). Then he made his
way back to his platoon, secured a fresh supply of bombs, and
with three companions returned and again attacked the enemy
under very heavy fire. On reaching the enemy position he jumped
on the parapet, threw bombs amongst the Boche and signalled to
his mates to come on. The enemy seeing this at once surrendered.
When counted they numbered 180 and three machine guns.
Such is the story of the exploit which gained the Battalion its
first and only Victoria Cross.
Weathers led his prisoners back to the cage that morning a
very happy man. He looked a picture with souvenirs of Boche,
binocculars and automatic pistols hanging about him like a Christ-
mas tree, about five days’ growth of beard, covered with mud, and
blood running down his face from a scratch on the head. He
could not help talking about the number of the enemy whom he
had “put the wind up,” as he termed it.
The next action, at Bony, where we broke through the Great
Hindenburg Line, poor Weathers was badly wounded in the head
by a shell on September 30. He died at the Regimental Aid Post,,
and lies buried on the battlefield. The same shell killed his uncle,
who bore the name of Lance-Corporal J. J. Weathers.
577 PRIVATE (TEMPORARY CORPORAL) FRANCIS SHAW,
D.C.M.
At Hamel on July 4 this man displayed conspicuous gallantry
and devotion to duty. He acted as No. lof a Lewis Gun Team
operating on the right flank of the Battalion attack.
An enemy machine gun opened just after our attack started,
inflicting casualties and killing the platoon commander. Private
Shaw at once rushed forward and engaged the enemy gun, thus
enabling his mates to advance and get the enemy post with the
bayonet. At the ten minutes’ halt of the barrage an enemy
machine gun was firing 200 yards away on his right. Shaw imme-
diately made for it, firing from the hip as he ran. When about
thirty yards from the enemy post a Hun officer ran out, fired at
Shaw with a revolver, but luckily missed, and Shaw shot him with
his Lewis gun. Before he had time to get another magazine from


his No. 2 a second Hun rushed Shaw, who side-stepped the bayonet,
knocked the Boche on the head with his revolver and then shot
him. Eight enemy were found dead in the post, and two of our
own men who had been previously captured were recovered.
In the mopping up of Hamel village the enemy were found in
great strength in a quarry on the eastern edge of the village.
Private Shaw set his gun going again, and enabled the post to be
rushed. Three machine guns and twenty prisoners were captured
out of the quarry.
For this piece of work he received the D.C.M.
A month later, near Proyart (August 12), Shaw was badly
wounded and died at the Casualty Clearing Station. He lies buried
on the banks of the Somme.
The son of an Adelaide minister, he was a tall, slow speaking
and well-built lad, the last one would imagine to rush machine
guns, but he was as cool and brave as they make them in Sunny
Australia, and was one of whom, we are all proud.
4728 CORPORAL WILLIAM HAMLEY HEALEY, D.C.M.
No story of the Battalion could be complete without a reference
to “Hambone” Healey, as his mates called him. A tall, lanky
Australian he was all grit and muscle, a fighter every inch of him,
and a favourite of everybody. To know him was to like him and
admire him. His buoyant sunny nature, ready wit, and courage
pulled the slow along in times of stress and hardship.
As a scout and raid leader he had no equal in the Battalion.
He loved fighting, and was depressed and low spirited when he
couldn’t get enough of it. Healey used to wander all over No
Man’s Land, and his information could always be relied on. He
won his D.C.M. in the Battalion’s first raid, where he led the
raiders into the enemy trench and then went out and carried in the
wounded regardless of danger.
At Villers Bretonneux, a famous name in Australian lighting
in Prance, he was one of a party of raiders. They found Fritz
alert and the enemy trench strongly held. Healey saw it was no
good, shouted to his mates to run for their lives, and remained
till they were all clear, but in trying to get away himself was
riddled by an enemy machine gun. His mates brought in his body,
and he is buried in the shadow of the Monastery in the heart of
the Bois-1 ’-Abbe, just west of Yillers. Thus died one of the finest
specimens of the Australian soldier that ever set foot in Prance.
LIEUTENANT LESLIE WATERHOUSE, M.M.
He left with the Battalion in June, 1916, as a signaller, later
being promoted to sergeant, and when the Signalling Officer, Lieu-
tenant Clarke, was killed at Messines, Waterhouse took charge
and did some fine work, for which he received the Military Medal.
He afterwards acted as Signaller Officer through Ypres and on the
Somme, until at the attack on Hamel, on July 4, he was wounded
and evacuated to England, where he contracted pneumonia and
died very suddenly. He is buried at Brookward cemetery.
Lieutenant Waterhouse was a fine type, a perfect gentleman, and
a good friend to all. Of a slight build, he did not enjoy good
health, but in spite of it he had plenty of grit and backbone. All
his work reflected the thoroughness and reliability of his character,
and his men would have gone through hell for him. His fine
cheery disposition, ready wit, gentleness, and tact endeared him to
us all. His going left a big gap in the mess that we have never


filled. There was only one Waterhouse, and he could not be
replaced.
He left a wife and little son, who never knew his father, but
whom we hope will grow up as fine a man as the comrade we all
knew and admired so much.
CAPTAIN GEORGE OSWALD, M.C.
He came away with the original Battalion as a subaltern, and
for the first eighteen months in Prance he acted as Brigade and
Divisional Bombing Officer. In this capacity he did splendid work
at Messines, Warneton, and Tpres, organising dumps and taking
supplies up to the front line. It was some sight to see him urging
forward a convoy of mules, laden with supplies, for the front line.
For this fine work at Messines and Ypres he was awarded the
Military Cross.
On the Somme he acted as Company Commander in the defence
of Amiens during the critical days of March, 1918, and in the
great offensive launched in August, which was the beginning of the
end.
Near Mont St. Quentin on September 1 he led his company in
the attack on the enemy position, and was badly wounded in the
groin. He died at the Casualty Clearing Station the same day and
lies buried at Daours, on the banks of the Somme.
“He’ll do me for a company commander,” was the general
opinion of the Digger, who could size up a man to a nicety. A
brainy, capable man was George Oswald, with a large share of
common sense and with plenty of grit and courage. His work
was always thorough and reliable, and his loss to the Battalion
was a heavy blow. We all honoured and admired him, and will
always revere his memory.
He, also, leaves a wife and little daughter back in Australia.
REGIMENTAL SERGEANT MAJOR DONALD NESBIT.
From Lance-Corporal to Regimental Sergeant-Major was his
record, and there was no better soldier ever left Australia.
Born in Scotland, he came to Australia in early life, and left
in June, 1916, with the Battalion. He went through the campaign
and did fine work up to the day of his death.
It was on the Somme, near Corbie, that a shell, with 106 fuze,
exploded at his feet and smashed him to pieces. It probably did
not leave a whole bone in his body, and both his legs were badly
shattered, yet he remained conscious till the last. They dressed
his wounds, and as they carried him off he called out, “Good-bye,
boys, give him (meaning the enemy) one for me.”
A fine soldier was Donald Nesbit, with the last word in courage
and devotion to duty, and the heart of a lion. He was a great
figure on the Battalion parade, and loved ‘ ‘ his boys ’ ’ like children.
A Regimental Sergeant-Major is born, not made, and Donald was a
born one. Always at his post, always reliable, and always cheery
and contented, he was loyalty itself to the Battalion, and he died
a hero, in action.
He is buried on the Somme banks, at Camon, near Amiens.
LIEUTENANT C. N. PATTERSON, M.C.
Leaving Australia with the original Battalion as a Sergeant,
he was promoted to Company Sergeant Major during the early days
in France.


He won his M.C. at Messines for his fine work and splendid
initiative, and he has the distinction of being the only Warrant
Officer in the Battalion who gained that decoration. Patterson
later went to Cambridge, returning to the Battalion in June, 1918,
with a commission. He took part in the great offensive in August.
The story of how he died is one of the finest in the Battalion’s
history. On the morning of September 1 the Battalion attacked,
on the right flank of the brigade, the strongly-held trenches north
of Haut Allaines and across the Canal-du-Nord, from the famous
Mont St. Quentin, which the Boehe had retaken the day before,
forcing our Second Division back towards Peronne. Patterson
was in charge of our left platoon in the attack. The enemy opened
a heavy fire with machine guns from the front and flanks, causing
heavy casualties, and our right was cheeked, and failed to reach
its objective. Patterson led his platoon with heroic gallantry
right into the enemy’s trench, and died in a hand-to-hand fight.
He had reached the objective in the face of the Hun machine guns,
and showed the Prussian Guards how an Australian officer can die
at the head of his platoon.
CAPTAIN F. G. SIMS.
Served in the militia in Australia, where he held a commission
in the 81st Regiment. He left Australia in June, 1916, with the
Battalion as a subaltern in charge of a platoon, and afterwards
became bombing officer of the Battalion. As such he went through
the early months of trench warfare in Armentieres, and was also
at Messines. He was promoted to Captain, and commanded D
Company in the famous battle of Broodseinde Cross Roads on Octo-
ber 4, 1917. Just before the attack began the enemy opened a
heavy shelling on our men lying up on the marshy bank of the
Zonnebeke, and a shell killed poor Sims instantly.
Always gentlemanly and courteous, always cheerful, he was
noted for his thoroughness and sound knowledge of tactics. He
was a very able loader, and his loss was sadly felt by the Bat-
talion and his brother officers who knew and admired him. The
Zonnebeke, with its horrors of mud and shell holes, with its tragi-
cal scenes which burnt deeply into the memory, will always be
sacred ground for the sake of those gallant fellows who are buried
there.
Captain Sims left a widow and two children to mourn their
loss.
LIEUTENANT WILLIAM GORDON COLLIVER.
Joined up as a private with one of the reinforcements, and
during the early days of trench warfare he displayed marked
bravery, which approached almost to rashness. Later on he was
granted his commission direct for his work in the field, and ap-
pointed Lewis Gun Officer on Battalion headquarters. He served
as such in the Somme fighting, and was always keen on his job
and anxious to go out with raiding parties.
He was gassed at Villers Bretonneux on April 25, when the
Hun threw over some 15,000 shells around that town. Returning
to the Battalion on August 29, he took part in the attack near Haut
Allaines as a Platoon Commander on September 1, and when his
Company Commander was evacuated, mortally wounded, young
Colliver carried on in his place. Things were very critical, the
Boche had retaken Mont St. Quentin, and his machine guns and
snipers were right on the job. Our men had to lay low and could
not show a little finger. Lieutenant Colliver, in attempting to go


round Ms company, was shot through the head by a sniper. He
lies buried near Haut Allaines on the Canal-du-Nord. A fine manly
lad he was, with a cheery disposition and as game as they make
them.
SERGEANT H. B. ARGUS.
Left with the Battalion in June, 1916, and remained with D
Company throughout his service in France. He acted as Platoon
Sergeant, and did splendid work in the trench warfare around
Armentieres and Ploegsteert Wood. For two or three days before
the opening of the great battle of Messines practice barrages were
put down, under cover of which daylight raiders issued from our
front lines and “put it across” Fritz. The idea was to secure
identification, discover if the Boche were changing his order of
battle and to destroy the morale of his front line troops. Going
over in daylight, even under a barrage, w r as no child’s play, but
required great nerve.
It was in one of these daylight raids that Sergeant Argus was
killed. He was a fine type of man, splendidly built, whose courage
seemed to rise as the danger increased. A born leader, he inspired
confidence in his men and ever was in the place where the work
was hottest and a leader most needed.
He lies buried in the famous Ploegsteert Wood.
PRIVATE W. G. WOOLCOCK, M.M.
Left with the original Battalion in June, 1916, and went to
France with it in November, 1916, as a Regimental Stretcher
Bearer.
Perhaps some of the finest deeds in this war have been done
by the stretcher bearers. It needs a man of fine physique, staunch
courage, untiring energy, and splendid nerve to become a stretcher
bearer. He has to carry heavy burdens over difficult and shell-
torn country, perhaps down the tortuous windings of narrow
trenches or across the open swept by shells and machine gun fire.
He has to endure sights that are fit for no civilized man, and yet
be tender and compassionate to the wounded.
Woolcock was a fine type of what a bearer should be. Always
ready and confident, with a cheery word and smile for those in
agony, he justly earned the reputation of being one of the best men
in his section. For his splendid work and devotion to duty at
Messines he won the Military Medal. At Sailly-le-Sec, between
the historic Somme and Ancre Rivers, Woolcock was carrying out
a comrade when an enemy shell burst near him and severely
wounded him in the body. He died next day in the Casualty
Clearing Station at Doullens, where he lies buried.
He left many friends behind who greatly admired him and
deeply felt his loss.
LIEUTENANT F. R. BROOK.
Left with the Battalion in June, 1916, as a Sergeant. He showed
out well in the trench warfare around Messines, and was promoted
to Company Sergeant-Major in January, 1917, soon after becoming
Regimental Sergeant-Major. For his very fine work in the Battle
of Messines he was Mentioned in Despatches, and prior to the
attack at Warneton he was badly wounded. Brook received a
direct commission, and returned to the Battalion in April, 1918,
during the defence of Amiens around the Somme. At Hamel on
July 4, while leading his platoon into action, he was killed by an


enemy machine gun. He lies buried with a number of his men
around him in a little cemetery not far from the ruins of the
village of Hamel.
Frank Brook was a man of extraordinary physique, with the
courage of a lion. One would have to search long to find a more
large-hearted or even-tempered man. His men loved him, for his
quiet, capable and confident manner, evenness of temper, and stern
sense of justice. There was only one Brook, and when he went
no one could quite take his place. His is a memory which will
be dear to many in the Battalion, and when we think of him we
shall always see the big form of our friend, always smiling, ready
to lend a helping hand, and to give good, sound advice.
He leaves a wife and little sou in Adelaide, where he was born.
LIEUTENANT E. D. CLARKE.
Left with the Battalion in June, 1916, as a Platoon Commander
in charge of one of D Company’s platoons. Previous to his join-
ing the A.I.F. he served for some years in the Commonwealth Mili-
tary Forces, in which he held a commission.
Shortly after the arrival of the Battalion in England Lieu-
tenant Clarke was appointed Signalling Officer, and to him fell the
task of training the Battalion Signal Section from very raw
material. How well he performed his task is evidenced by the
sterling work afterwards done in France by this section. During
the early days of trench warfare he displayed great keenness and
enthusiasm, rendering splendid service to his unit and Brigade.
It was at the great battle of Messines that he was badly
wounded, and two days later died in the Casualty Clearing Station
at Trois Abres, near Steenwerck, where he is buried. Of a quiet,
unassuming nature, he was always on his job, and could always be
depended upon in times of stress.
He left a widow and one child to mourn their loss.
SERGEANT G. A. C. GARDINER, D.C.M.
Left with the original Battalion as a private in D Company.
From being a rather wild and irresponsible private, he changed
into one of our best non-commissioned officers, and gradually
worked his way up to the rank of Sergeant, by merit and capable
leadership. He went through all the hardships and dangers of
the winter of 1916-17, a winter which will always stand out for
its severity and its vile weather.
For his fine w-ork, initiative, splendid dash, and courage in
one of the famous daylight raids prior to Messines he won the Dis-
tinguished Conduct Medal.
During that celebrated tour in the line at Messines at the end
of June and the beginning of July, 1917, which was one of the
hardest tests ever put on the Battalion, and which is familiarly
knowm as the ‘ ‘ eighteen days ’ stunt, ’ ’ Gardiner was killed. He
is buried just below the ruins, which is all that is left of what
must have been a delightful little town, on the top of the Messines
Hill. Messines was the Battalion’s first big fight in France, and
the little crosses mark the resting place of some of its best men.
Sergeant Gardiner was ever a cheery soul, and he was sadly
missed.
LANCE-CORPORAL C. R. ROSE, M.M.
Was an original Battalion man, and left in June, 1916. He
has quite a unique record in our history, for he served right through


until the day of his death, on August 26, 1918. Eose was never
one day sick during his service, and the only time he was away
from his unit was on ten days ’ leave to England. He went into
the line every time with his platoon, and was in all the stunts in
which the Battalion operated. As a Lewis gunner he was famous
and was as reliable as the sun. When we broke through the
Boehe line on August 8 Eose won his Military Medal for great
bravery near Cerisy, on the Somme. It was during our operation
near Bray, when we formed the defensive flank for the corps north
of the Somme, that Eose was killed by an enemy shell. His death
created a great impression amongst the old hands, as he had never
previously received a scratch, and was known as “Lucky Eose.”
SEEGEANT W. C. JOSEPHS.
Left as a private with the original Battalion. He gained
his first stripe at Lark Hill, and was made a Corporal for his good
work in the trenches at Armentieres.
He was wounded in a successful raid at Le Bizet, and on
returning to the Battalion was made a Sergeant for his splendid
work. He went to the Somme with the Battalion, and was killed
on March 30, near Sailly-le-Sec, during an attempt of the Hun to
drive us off the high ground between the Somme and the Ancre.
He is buried at Heilly, on the banks of the Ancre.
A genial companion and a very good sport, Josephs was well
liked, and his loss was deeply regretted.
SEEGEANT J. X. STAINBANK, D.G.M.
Left as a Corporal with the Battalion in June, 1916. He had
a very sound knowledge of the game, and his fine work in the
trenches at Armentieres, especially under fire, was commendable,
and gained for him promotion to a Sergeant.
At Messines his splendid work in rescuing some of his men
who were buried by enemy shells, while he was in danger of being
gassed, won for him his Distinguished Conduct Medal.
During the attack at Warneton on July 31, 1917, Stainbank
was wounded in the back early in the operations. On being pressed
to go out he refused, and said he was going on with the boys.
Later on an enemy shell killed him, and so one of the gamest of
men died in the thick of the fight. He was buried on the field.
Always a popular non-commissioned officer in his company, he
will be remembered for his droll sayings, especially in times of
stress, when a cheerful spirit was badly needed.
LIEUTENANT E. F. M. PAMMBNT.
Was a West Australian, who joined up with a reinforcement
about May, 1917, just before the flattie of Messines, as a Lance-
Corporal, took part in that battle, and also in the strenuous days
opposite Warneton, when the new line was being dug. Later on he
was in the Warneton Diversion on July 31. For his fine work at
Ypres in October, 1917, he received a direct commission in the field,
and was in the line near Le Bizet during the winter of 1917-18.
He went with the Battalion to the Somme in March, 1918,
when the Division was rushed there for the defence of Amiens, and
during the enemy attack on our trenches near Bailly-le-See on
March 30 poor Pamment was killed.
■He is buried in the pretty little cemetery near Heilly, between
the Somme and Ancre.


Lieutenant Pammcnt was of a quiet, retiring nature, but a
most genuine and lovable fellow, very popular with his men and
greatly liked by his brother officers.
LIEUTENANT OSWALD CRICK.
Left as a Corporal with the original Battalion in June, 1916.
His work in the trenches at Armentieres gained him rapid promo-
tion, first to Platoon Sergeant and very soon afterwards to Platoon
Officer. He commanded his platoon in the Battle of Messines,
and in the consolidation of the new line opposite Warneton. At
Tpres on October 4, during our successful attack at Zonnebeke,
Crick was severely wounded and died the next day at the Casualty
Clearing Station, Poperingho, where he, is buried.
He was a striking personality in the Battalion, tall and clean
cut, with plenty of energy, although his hair was tinged with
grey. He could wield a cricket bat to some purpose. On parade
he was always a stern disciplinarian, somewhat taciturn and abrupt,
but he had the qualities which make a leader, and he always had
the confidence and respect of his men. Off parade he was one
of the most genial of men, with a great fund of humour, and to his
many friends his death came as a great shock. He always had a
good platoon, thoroughly knew his job and carried it out.
LIEUTENANT C. LLOYD HERBERT.
Left with the original Battalion as a Lance-Corporal. Before
enlisting in the A.I.F. he held a responsible position in the Adminis-
trative Department in New Guinea. Herbert was promoted to
Corporal at Lark Hill, and came over to Prance with the Battalion
in November, 1916, and went through the early days of trench
warfare in Flanders during the winter of 1916-17.
He won his commission direct on the field during February,
1917, and became a Platoon Commander. In this capacity he took
part in the Battle of Messines and the attack at Warneton. After
this he was appointed Intelligence Officer on Battalion head-
quarters, and went into the attack at Zonnebeke on October 4. He
supervised the placing of the troops on the tape for the “jump
off, ’ ’ and was returning to Battalion Headquarters to report comple-
tion when he was killed instantly by a shell. He was buried on
the battlefield.
A fine brainy chap was Herbert, one of the most promising
officers in the Battalion, and one whose loss was keenly felt by his
Commanding Officer.
LIEUTENANT FRED COLEMAN.
Joined the Battalion as a Cadet Officer from the Officers’ Train-
ing College, Oxford, in February, 1917. He did good work in the
trenches near Le Bizet and Ploegsteert Wood, and took part in the
famous daylight raid before Messines. Unfortunately his raiding
party lost the barrage, and the enemy machine guns coming into
action at barely 200 yards, played great havoc with our men. Poor
Coleman was riddled with bullets. At nightfall his body was
brought in and was buried in Ploegsteert Wood.
He was always a cheery soul and a most efficient officer.
Although only with the Battalion a short period he was a great
favourite, and had the respect and esteem of all.


NO. 353 PRIVATE EDGAR R. PACKER.
Was a native of Basket Range, S.A. In private life before
enlisting he was a farmer. He enlisted in 1915, and shortly after-
wards joined B Company 43rd, where he stayed until his death.
He soon showed that soldiering by him was to be like farming —
“ successful. ’ ’ Nearly 6 ft. high, rugged, abrupt in manner,
square and broad shouldered, with a firm and determined face, one
could hardly fail to see he was of the right stuff. In fact, a stranger
seeing him would immediately associate him with the type of man
who in the early days made Australia what it is. Leaving with
the Battalion, he remained with it under all conditions, nobly
doing his bit until his death, caused by the concussion of a high
explosive shell. He aspired to no fame, refusing stripes on several
occasions, yet he carried as much weight as many of the higher
ranks. The diggers, knowing his sterling character, always relied
on him, his presence alone being sufficient to make contentment
and safety certain. Officers likewise knew and trusted him in
every kind of work, knowing that his initiative could at all times
be relied on.
Early in 1917 he joined a Lewis Gun Team, which he handled
with great skill, doing untold good work up to the period of the
Warneton stunt, when he was killed on July 31, 191 7, No. 8 Platoon
sustaining a sad and heavy loss hard to replace.
PRIVATE C. S. GRAVES.
Left with the original Battalion in June, 1916, and landed in
France in November that year. He was a famous scout and
raider, and went night after night into No Man’s Land, bringing
back valuable information. He took part as a volunteer in three
successful raids at Frelinghein, Le Bizet, and the daylight raid
before Messines attack. During the battle he acted as a runner
for his Platoon Commander, and it was while on this duty that he
was killed. He is buried on the battlefield. Of a bright, cheerful
disposition, he was a great favourite and admired for his courage
and splendid work on patrols in all kinds of weather.


APPENDIX VIII.
THE 43rd BATTALION TRENCH COMFORTS
LEAGUE.
AN APPRECIATION.
BY CAPT. H. S. HUDD, M.C.,
Quartermaster.
The 43rd Battalion Trench Comforts’ League was formed
shortly after the Battalion’s departure from Australia by the
women friends and relatives of members of the Unit. Its object
was to minimise the hardships of the fighting men by supplying
comforts and money for their use.
The history of the Battalion would indeed be incomplete with-
out an article of appreciation to these members of the league for
their splendid and unremitting work during the whole of the 43rd’s
period of service overseas. This loyal band of workers, who had
to bear the weary wait at home, never ceased to think of, and work
for their “boys” at the front. The poet sings, “They also serve
who only stand and wait. ’ ’ What then can be said of those who,
not content to ‘ ‘ stand and wait, ’ ’ moved and worked for those
at war? Truly, it can be set down that they played their part in
achieving the final victory no less than those who trod the field of
battle, and who should ever be worthy of their splendid women.
During the period the Battalion served in Prance, this Com-
mittee sent regularly money, sox, shirts, woollens, reading material,
etc., all of which helped materially to ease the harsh conditions
of war. Not a day passed without the men receiving some benefit
from the gifts of the League. The diet was improved, sporting
material made available, sox and shirts distributed, articles were
purchased for making the billets more comfortable, and in a score
of other ways the troops were the recipients of numerous benefits.
At every phase of the service, whether going over the top,
holding the line, in support, reserve, or rest billets, something was
needed and supplied to make conditions better, and it was astonish-
ing what a difference these little things made.
The army supplies were excellent, but there is nothing so good
that it cannot be improved. It can well be understood that the
Army organization can only deal with the basic and general wants
of the troops, and could not possibly supply the particular wants
of any given unit. The ration scale is fixed, and is supplied year
in and year out, so that without the addition of extras the diet
becomes monotonous. By utilizing the money supplied by the
Comforts League the ration scale was able to be improved by the
purchase of goods from the French. Straw was needed at a
moment’s notice to make new billets habitable; dry, warm sox were
wanted after a spell of wet weather in the line; timber was re-
quired for tables; cigarettes and tobacco were an urgent need for
a long spell in the trenches. All these and many other require-
ments were met. It was always felt that there was something
to work with, and this in any walk of life is a great feeling. In
the war the benefit of such a reserve was incalculable. The sum
total of it all was that the Battalion consisted of a happy and con-
tented body of troops; complaints were almost unknown.


Since speech or written words are all too poor to express appre-
ciation, the members of the Trench Comforts League can never
know the gratitude felt by the Battalion.
In this article it is intended to deal only with the operations
of the fund after the arrival of the Battalion in France in Novem-
ber, 1916. So soon as the continent was reached real active ser-
vice conditions prevailed, and wants soon made themselves mani-
fest. At once remittances began to arrive from Adelaide, and
then the process of benefit began. In the year 1917 the sum of
£7OO was received; in 1918, £BOO was remitted; making a total of
£1,500 in the two years. When the Armistice was signed on
November 11, 1918, the Commanding Officer cabled to the League
to cancel further remittances after December, 1918. Had this
not been done, money would have undoubtedly continued to arrive,
even though the war was over.
The Colonel felt, and rightly, too, that since the strenuous times
were past, the Battalion could well afford to relieve those loyal
workers at home, especially as other funds, viz., the Regimental
Trust account and the Canteen Fund, were available to be drawn
on to meet the requirements of the Battalion during the rest of its
stay in France.
By far the largest share of the £1,500 sent from home was
spent on food stuffs and proved an excellent policy. It was decided
not to spend the money on any particular improvement of the diet,
which in the nature of things would show up as a benefit for a few
days only. The course adopted was one which gave a continuous
benefit. Extra bread when available was obtained, regular sup-
plies of potatoes and vegetables were purchased, mixed herbs were
secured to add flavour to cooking, flaked oats was provided for
breakfast. The main idea was to supplement the Army rations in
a way to give the best results.
Certain officers and non-commissioned officers were charged
with the responsibility of carefully watching the question of diet-
ing, with the result that the cooking reached a very high standard.
The cooks were invited to make suggestions; their advice was
always valuable, and very many hints given by them were adopted.
Any cook had only to say that a certain article was wanted to im-
prove the meals, and that commodity would be supplied, even if it
had to be obtained from London. The sum of £SO, which was
usually the amount received monthly, does not seem a large amount
of money to spend on 500 to 600 men, but it was indeed wonderful
what a difference was made by the extras purchased. A man had
only to quarter with another unit to notice this fact, and no oppor-
tunity was lost to let him know that the Trench Comforts Com-
mittee was responsible for this difference. The 43rd considered
itself the most fortunate unit on the Western Front.
In December, 1917, and again in 1918, a special remittance for
the Christmas dinner was received, amounting in 1917 to the sum
of £l5O and in 1918 to £250. Then the benefits of the year reached
the culmination. There was no mistaking the existence of a Com-
forts Fund with roast turkey, plum pudding, and brandy sauce,
wine and beer placed before one. Roast turkey and plum pudding
on active service—why, it seemed incredible. And what dinners
they were; the turkeys were specially selected in London by the
purveyors to His Majesty the King and sent to France under special
escort on military trains and boats. The cooks rose to the occa-
sion and prepared a dinner which would have done credit to a lead-
ing London hotel. The sight of the Battalion having its Christmas
dinner was one which can never be forgotten. The Commanding
Officer on each occasion made a speech and called upon the men
to give cheers for those who provided the wherewithal. Surely


the cheer must have been heard in Adelaide. The cost of each
Christmas dinner was roughly £175. No body of troops in any
theatre of war ever had a finer treat than these who could not help
being deeply appreciative.
It is interesting to set down some of the goods purchased from
time to time:—
Bread Custard powder
Vegetables Band instruments
Potatoes Music
Jam Sporting material
Oatmeal Educational material
Curry powder Writing paper and stationery
Milk Carpenter’s tools
Jelly crystals Concert party costumes
Coffee Soap
Flour Bricks
Fruit Tailoring, materials
Beer Hairdresser’s materials
Wine Brasso
Cigarettes Firewood
Tobacco Lamps
Candles
The above list gives a good idea of the value of the fund to the
Battalion.
The expenses of the fund were carefully watched and the ac-
counts verified by the Battalion Audit Board. The final state-
ment was presented on March 24, 1919. A complete statement will
be submitted to the Trench Comforts Committee on the return of
the Battalion Secretary from overseas.
To the members of the 43rd Battalion Trench Comforts League
and to all the organizations and individual workers who sent com-
forts, the members of the 43rd Battalion A.I.F. convey their expres-
sions of deep appreciation. On very many occasions supplies of
comforts were received through the Australian Comforts Fund,
which proved a great boon. And so will everyone who helped to
make easier the conditions of war, please accept these warmest
thanks.
The thanks of the Battalion are also extended to Lady Brown,
Mrs. Eobert Barr Smith, and Lady Duncan for parcels of sox which
arrived with unfailing regularity.


APPENDIX IX.
SOME INCIDENTS OF THE LIFE IN FRANCE.
BY LIEUT.-COL. J. FARRELL, D.S.O.
“HIS DONK.”
No words or figures will ever bo able to adequately estimate
the value of the work of the mule in this war. Those patient,
nimble-footed little animals, dragging their rattling limbers or guns
along broad white tree-bordered roads, or over shell-torn country,
through mud and slush or over the frozen ground of winter, were
always a familiar sight. Some of us have seen lines of them, piled
high with ammunition, rations, barbed wire, and backboards, wend-
ing their way along tracks up to the guns and to the front line
troops, amid the roar of guns, the crack of bursting shells, and the
desolation which follows war.
And the Digger loves his mule —loves it with an affection which
is deep, which is begotten by long comradeship and strengthened
by common dangers and hardships.
This particular Digger wasn’t much to look at. He was lanky
and loose-limbed, long of jaw, with large hands and feet, but his
heart was big also, and it was in the right place. He could ride
like the scn-of-a-gun and drive a limber over the worst ground
and shell holes. To see him at all hours of the day and night
driving his team right up to the front line troops, never complaining
(though his language at times could not be called classical) was
something to look at.
One day he brought up a load to a dump and unhitched his
mules, when Fritz got busy and started on the spot with a 5.9
battery. Our friend calmly hitched in his mules, mounted, and
drove away, as if he were at his waggon lines. And one day, as he
was bringing up rations, a shell pitched in front of his team, and
the mule he was riding just sank slowly down and lay still. That
night I was walking down the track, and I heard sounds of
someone sobbing and talking in a disjointed kind of way. When
I got near enough I could see it was our driver, sitting with his
head in his hands and crying like a child beside the dead body of
his “donk.”
Don’t mind me, sir,” he said, when I spoke to him. “I am
only a silly old , but me donk was killed this afternoon, and I
have had him since we were at Lark Hill, right through Messines
and Tpres. ’ ’
Later on you would have seen him digging, digging silently
into the white chalky ground, and then he rolled the body of his
beloved donk into the hole and reverently covered him over. And
the funeral march was played on a weird orchestra —the crash of
Fritz’s shells in the Somme Yalley, sounding like a hundred
machine guns going off at once —the hollow, reverberating sound of
our guns as they replied, and the sound went echoing away up that
long valley, the distant tap-tap-tap of our Vickers and the slow
whine of the shells overhead. Now and again a row of fireworks
of all colours went up in a wide circle, and the flash of our guns
looked like bright pin-points of light in the distance.
And a tired Digger, who loved his donk and who had paid him
his last homage of friendship and affection, crept silently into his
little dugout on the steep slopes of Shrapnel Gully.


“THEIE ALL.”
Much has "been said and many articles have been written about
the devastation, the desolation, the pain, misery, and torture which
this war has caused, but nothing one can say or write can give any
true picture of the horrors and crimes which have been wrought in
the name of war.
The ruin of the provinces, the destruction of towns, cities, and
villages, with their priceless treasure of historical relics, architec-
ture, and industrial plants, are as nothing to the human pain and
misery caused.
No one will ever forgot the pictures of woe and misery of those
ruined French people, flying in terror of their lives from the
advancing foe.
As we marched through the streets of a deserted village on
our way to stop the Hun on that bleak morning in March, we passed
hundreds of fugitives making for the coast. I shall always remem-
ber one sight —a family with their all. In front came grand-pere,
leading a small donkey in a cart, piled with the household goods,
and carrying a bundle over his shoulder. Next came a woman with
a baby in her arms and two bedraggled youngsters trailing behind,
and then came grand-mere, leading a cow and carrying a basket of
provisions on her arm. And the- misery on that woman’s face
would have made a stone man weep. Yet old grand-pere, as we
passed him, smiled and shouted, ‘‘Vive les Australians!”
On March 30, during the Bosche attack on Sailly-le-Sec, when
the bombardment was at its height, an old, old man and woman
came out of the village—he wheeling a barrow with their belong-
ings and she carrying a big bundle.
And people still talk about just and righteous wars!
‘‘ LA PETITE MADAME. ’ ’
She lived with her father and mother in a quiet little village
nestling in a deep valley in Northern France, did ‘‘the little
madame.” Her husband was with his regiment in the Argonne.
It was just after our five months’ stretch in trenches round
Armentieres that we went back to the little village and made the
acquaintance of our little friend. The village, after the mud,
desolation, and monotony of Flanders, seemed a veritable paradise
to us. Quite a picture it formed during the spring day when we
first set eyes on it, nestling among the trees, just breaking into bud
with the new life, its red-tiled roofs and the white-washed walls
blending with the background of green of the surrounding fields.
The blue smoke floated lazily upwards, and the clear sparkling river
rushed along through the village and turned the wooden wheel of
the mill. The jovial, fat-faced miller, in white cap, covered with
white dust from head to foot, came out to see us, and we
tramped past and shouted, “Bonjour, messieurs.” Truly we
thought we had stepped into a haven of peace and happiness after
our experiences of the winter of 1916-1917, and the war seemed a
terrible long way off to us in that quiet valley.
Madame lived with her father and mother, as I said before, and
their house was a ‘‘home from home” for many of us, and
Madame was a charming little lady and was like unto a sister of
ours. She had been to the Lille University and could speak Eng-
lish. She had a fine sense of humour and was great in an argument
on anything from her own country and the war to religion and
politics. Many a pleasant evening we had sitting round the piano
and singing, and there were dainty little suppers in our honour.
Next time we went back we rode ten miles to see our friend,
and we found no less than nine others, all on the same errand.


We had a happy re-union, and Madame was very proud to see us all
again.
God bless you. Petite Madame, and your old father and mother,
for you made us forget the horror and misery of past months, and
you gave us a glimpse of the home life which we had left behind,
and which seemed so far away until we met you.
“THE MASCOT.”
Ask who have had the worst time and the thinnest spin in
France during the past four years, and my answer is the little
French children. They have had no childhood ’s happy hours, and
have seen things which make them old long before their time.
They have had to fly from their homes and live among strangers
under war conditions. God knows, their lives near the war zone
must have been a drab, miserable existence, and none of the sweet-
ness could have come to them.
One morning the cook, as he was making the breakfast, saw
him standing at the door —a poor, ragged little figure, with pinched
white dirty face, no boots, with misery written largely all over him.
The cook was making rissoles, and we always prided ourselves
on our rissoles in the Battalion. Their chief ingredient was bully
beef, well camouflaged with scraps of fresh meat, biscuit meal,
flour, and mixed herbs, and then fried in fat. One was a meal in
itself, and he was a good man who could eat two. But the cook
took him in, that little hungry piece of humanity, and fed him, and
he ate six straight off, while the Diggers sat round and gazed at
him in amazement.
He told a piteous story in his broken English. His father was
a prisoner of war and his mother had been killed by a Hun bomb.
He was working for a farmer, but he was beaten and so ran away.
He still had the marks of his beating on his arms and body. And
the Diggers took him to their hearts and tended him. They made
a collection and bought him a pair of boots, and two or three who
were handy with the needle made up some old uniforms and dressed
him. They covered him with Australian badges, and put the Bat-
talion colours on his shoulders and a row of gaudy-coloured ribbons
on his breast, and to them he became the Mascot.
Who will say that our Digger has no sense of humour and no
deep compassion for the weak and helpless. He stayed with them
for months, and shared in all their good things, and, I am afraid,
learnt one or two vices to boot.
Then we moved into back areas near the coast when the
Armistice was signed, and one day the French gendarmes came
along and took the Mascot off. The poor little fellow was broken
up at parting with his friends, and the Diggers turned out to a man
to wave him good-bye.
Some day perhaps he may come to Australia, when he grows
up, and meet those large-hearted big men who were so kind to him.
‘‘THE RUNNER” (DUCKED ARD HARRIER).
No praise is high enough for those brave young fellows. A
successful runner had to be young and athletic, with plenty of grit
and endurance, and a courage able to face and surmount all
obstacles. Those long tramps they made through winding trenches,
sometimes nearly knee-deep in water and mud, or across the open,
shell-torn country, in all hours of day and night, and under all
sorts of weather conditions, were calculated to try the staunchest
hearts. Often when the fighting was hottest and the enemy shells


were falling thick, the runner had to carry an important message,
for the telephone line never stood under an artillery barrage.
With his rifle slung and a bandolier of ammunition thrown
across his shoulder, that silent, alert figure, with the red armband,
shut his teeth and took his life in his hands as he carried his
precious message in his right-hand top pocket, for he knew it
probably meant a lot for his side. They acquired a wonderful eye
for ground and detail, knew exactly the habits of Fritz (their lives
depended on it), and at night in pitch blackness could guide you
without a hitch to your destination. They knew by experience
from the sound of a shell whether it was going to land and the time
to flutter out to earth.
Each Platoon Commander always had a runner, and he followed
his officer like a shadow when he went his rounds, and got to know
a lot of the game.
On one occasion, when the Americans fought with us, an officer
and his runner of our Battalion went with the Yanks to give them
the benefit of our experience. In one platoon our officer was
wounded early in the attack, but his runner just took command of
those Tanks and finished his job just as well as his officer would
have done. He was only a boy of twenty, but he had been through
a good school, and he now wears the M.M. as a memento of that
fight.
“THE SIG. ”
Sometimes he was called “The Spook,’’ because he could
mysteriously tap or buzz on his machine and call up all sorts of
unknown spirits from afar off. Communications were the main-
spring of the modern battle, and enabled the higher commander to
control men and supplies operating on a wide front, and they
enabled him to fling in his reserves at the critical moment.
One thing we always had dinned into our ears before we went
into action was “Send back information; plenty of it and as often
as you can. ’ ’ Even if there was nothing doing we had to send back
and say so.
And “The Sig.,” with his little buzzer, sitting in a corner of a
dugout, or under a thin piece of tarpaulin, sent on this information,
which meant so much to the man waiting in the rear. In the open
warfare stunts he sent back the information with his flag or flapper
or his wonderful O.L. lamp—that little winking eye of white in the
daylight and red at night, which saved the weary feet of tired
runners and leapt over space in a few seconds.
No one who has seen them at work —those quiet, confident men
with the blue shoulder straps—but had to admire them for their
splendid work. They did not always work in dugouts either.
Often the lines were smashed by the shell concussion, and these
lads had to go out and face the music at all hours and in all
weathers, to find the breaks and repair the damage. They got
little sleep and much abuse for their labours. They went into
action with their companies, and when they reached their objectives
they had to get their “visual” going, and often man the lamp in a
shell hole or out in the open without any cover.
_ They were the picked men of the show, specially selected for
their intelligence and smartness, and they were specially trained to
carry out their difficult task. To them belongs a good share of the
credit for the success we have had.


“THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN.”
The wonderful buoyancy and exuberance of spirit is the out-
standing feature of our men. To the outsider they may seem to
be casual and at times rough and uncouth. Certainly their lan-
guage on occasions was calculated to scorch the vegetation for
hundreds of yards round them, but underneath the casual and rough
exterior is the man, downright and genuine, who stood for .justice
and high purpose. There is nothing of the snob about the Digger,
for his large share of common sense prevents the growth of snob-
bery, and his optimism is backed by a confidence in his own ability
which would never develop into conceit. Give him a‘ ‘ square go, ’ ’
as he calls it, tell him in plain language the job he has to do and
trust him, and he will respond and requite your confidence in him
and will never let you down.
To those who have been privileged to lead and command, and
have shared with him his joys and his hardships, he is the most
wonderful man in the world. Never at any time have I seen him
absolutely down and out. When the dangers and hardships increase
he will grumble, certainly, but will always rise to the occasion
because of his wonderful spirit and his knack of adapting himself
to whatever comes along.
Who will ever forget that first winter at Armentieres when we
were learning the game, those freezing nights on watch, those
working parties at all hours of the darkness and in every state of
weather. Just think of sleeping in your clothes, getting up at
2 a.m., a hurried breakfast by candle light, and then the trudge in
gum-boots through the silent shell-wrecked streets and along the
seemingly endless miles of duokboards to the line. Then the
continual work on trenches, digging or revetting or putting down
duekboards, standing in icy water for hours, and the trudge back
to billets. And with it all the spirit never sank, though the body
was often tired and the feet chilled to the bones. To see him
coming out from one of those working parties you would have
thought he was done, but to see him after he had had a feed, a sleep
and a brush up, some hours later, you would marvel at the change.
Those route marches that we had four days on end, with
full marching order and a pack weighing up to 100 lb., were
calculated to test the endurance and try the morale of any man.
Yet the spirit forbade falling out; the pride and determination
kept him going, although his feet were raw and his back was
aching.
I have seen a man march eighteen miles, and at the end, as he
reached his billet, drop in a dead faint from exhaustion, yet the
‘‘fighting spirit” would never let him complain or think of falling
out.
On a raw November day I have seen the men of the Battalion
finish a twenty miles’ march in the darkness, singing as if the sun
were shining and there was no crushing pack on their backs and no
cheerless barn to sleep in ahead of them. It was pride of race and
set purpose to do or die which kept them going, which enabled them
to rise above their surroundings and to surmount all difficulties.
He has been described as foolhardy and daring, but while he
has plenty of dash and courage yet the success is due to careful
training, attention to minute detail, and confidence in himself to
carry out the task before him.
Before the battle of the Broodsende Ridge on October 4, while
conversing with an English Brigadier on the possibilities of the
attack, he expressed surprise at what we were attempting to do in
view of the opposition his division had met, but he added, ‘‘You
nave such wonderful men; they can do anything.”


One day I saw a game of football being played behind Ploeg-
steert Wood, while 800 yards away the enemy was knocking one of
our batteries to pieces with salvos of 5.9’5. Enemy shelling never
prevented the Digger on the Somme from having his swim or from
going out in a boat to get the fish which had been killed.
On the morning of March 27 we marched down to the Anere
after travelling the day before in a train and marching through the
night. As the dawn was breaking the men dumped their packs and
had their breakfast —bully beef and biscuit and cold water —and
then in fighting order they crossed the bridges of the Anore pre-
pared for demolition, and with the knowledge that the Bosche was
just in front and had been pushing on his victorious march for
days. Their reply was to pick up extra bandoliers of ammunition
and throw them over their shoulders, in spite of the load they were
already carrying—that was what they made up their minds to do.
They were going to fight it out and give the Hun a run for his
money. And when we had taken up our positions and dug in
several days later the situation was very critical, and we “stood to’’
constantly.
An Army Staff Officer, going round the line, said to one of our
men, “Do you think Fritz can break through here?” “Well, he
might,’’ was the laconic answer, “but he will have a interest-
ing time doing it. ’ ’
No better illustration of the “fighting spirit’’ than that could
be given.
