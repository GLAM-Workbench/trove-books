MANIFEST
OF THE
National Executive of the Congress
Fellow Unionists, —
Conscription is the law in Great Britain and in the
Republic of the French.
In both countries conscription has been used to render
null and void all the achievements of Trade Unionism
—to destroy customs, rights and practices—to dilute and
whittle away —to put unskil ed in the place of skilled,,
women in the place of men, children in the place of
adults.
In both countries conscription has been used not
merely as an instrument of national defence, but as a
bludgeon to break down the standard of the industrial
classes.
In both countries conscription commences, not in the
seizure of the body for slaughter, but originates in the
proclamation itself.
From, that moment , every subject within the prescribed
|tges is a potential subject of the sword. From that
moment every industrial is a slave, every act of protest
a crime, and every workman who rises in indignation
against the destruction of some hard-won right or privi-
lege of his occupation is seized, interned, deported, or
conscribed.
In both countries the industrial magnates, the con-
trollers of ocean transportation, and the great financiers
have been permitted to wax fat on the blood of . slaughter..


In both countries the suspension of trade union condi-
tions, the coercionist and the suppressive practices per-
missible under conscription has made trade unionism
a mere name, a memory of the past; has made the
workers the helpless victims of every Gradgrind.
These things have happened in the land where "Britons
never shall be slaves/' and under' the banner of Re-
publican France, In neither country have the toiling
multitude been permitted to express an election opinion
upon the economic serfage created by conscription—no
more than if they had been inhabitants of the most
absolute despotism.
The principle of conscription is one thing; —its practice
is quite another. In principle it is an instrument of
national defence; in practice it is made an instrument
of working class subjugation. It is so under the Kaiser
and the Czar. It is so under the Union Jack and the
Tricolor of France, and since in Australia we have seen
a slavish imitation of the laws, regulations, and
practices of the Imperial Government it behoves the
organised toilers of Australia to speak and act before
the clock of trickery is permitted to strike the hour of
doom.
» .
Because, when the proclamation of conscription is
made, the hour is past, the democracy is too late, its
lips are sealed, it can speak no more; every man is a
soldier, subject to the laws, the decisions, and the abrupt
penalties of the drumhead.
We place no value on the promises that conscription
will not mean for the workers of Australia what it has
meant for the organised working classes of other lands.
We remember the promises made during the passage
of the War Precautions Act, and under it and its regula-
tions we have seen suppression of speech and press, im-
prisonment of workmen, and unpunished brigandage on
the part of the predatory interests.
Control of the metal resources of the continent by men
who were the intimates of the Germanic interests they
introduced and fostered; control of primary products


by the wheat sharks; control of shipments by Bell, by
Darling, and allied interests*; control of Commonwealth
financial arrangements by bankers and stockjobbers*
To all these is to be added, if possible, control of the lives,
and working conditions of the wage earners by the bugle
and the drawn sword of militarism —such are the con-
trasts that confront us.
Because of these facts the trade unionists of Australia
have taken steps to guard the rights achieved hy long
years of sacrifice and toil. They will not lightly let
them go. They will contend with all the powers at their
disposal and all the resources at their command against
the enactment in Australia of practices and conditions
imposed, under the pretence of national salvation, upon
the workers of other countries.
For these reasons, and in order to meet any con-
tingency that may arise, the Trades Unions met in
Congress. The Congress represented 280,000 unionists-
drawn from all States. It did not represent the whole
body of organised Labor; but it did include in its repre-
sentation the most powerful and the most militant
unions of this continent. Many organisations that,
because of time, distance and expense, could not send
a delegation, sent intimations of their views, and those
views, in nearly every case, coincided with the decisions
of the Congress, A week after the Congress, the
Grand Council —-the supreme official body in the Aus-
tralian trades union movement—at its Conference in
Hobart recorded opinions identical with those of the
Congress in Melbourne.
The opinions and resolutions of the Congress are set
forth in the official record of the proceedings.
The need for the Labor Party to reverse the capitalist
style of war policy was emphasised by Congress.
A resolution submitted in favor of a general cessation
of work should conscription be brought in, was not
carried, but it was agreed that if conscription became
imminent a referendum of members of unions should
be held to decide as to the calling of an industrial strike


in Australia. The Congress also agreed to co-operate
in opposing political candidates speaking or in
favor of conscription, thus giving backing to the action
by the Victorian P.L.C. and the P.L.L. of New South
Wales.
We gather no feeling of security from men who to-day
are mouthing the platitudes of the traditional foes of
Labor, and who sing harmoniously the praises of institu-
tions they previously assailed. The vital interests of
trade unionism demands that it be ready to resist every
encroachment, no matter how it approaches, what
language it speaks, or in what garb it appears. In this
crisis the safety of Labor is to be found, not in blind
faith or childish confidence, but in its organised watch-
fulness, and its rigid determination to uphold the de-
cisions of the Congress.

HOW CONGRESS WAS INITIATED.
Delegates having assembled, Mr. C. J. Bennett,' President
of th e> Melbourne Trades Hall Council, read the following
resolution, which had been -carried at the meeting of the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council on March 2:—
"That this Council call a Congress of all affiliated unions
throughout Australia in order to discuss the question
ot Conscription, and to determine the official attitude
of the industrial movement thereon; further, that such
Congress be called together in Melbourne not later
than May 2 next. Voting at such Congress to be on
the eard system.”
Mr. Bennett said that although May 2 had been originally
decided upon, it had been agreed later by the Prooaganda Com-
mittee appointed by the Trades Hall Council; and by the
Executive of the 1 rades Hall Council itself, to make the date
ot the Congress May 10, so as to enable delegates who were
proceeding to Hobart for the Inter-State Congress' to take
part in the business of the present Congress.
Whilst there had been a number of resolutions carried bv
different industrial bodies against Conscription, the view o'f
the 1 rades Hall Council had been that something in the nature
of a collective expression of opinion should be given. ! by the
organised industrialists of Australia, and with that object in
view the Congress had been convened.
MACHINERY MATTERS*
Mr. C. J. Bennett was elected president, Mr. E. J. Hollo-
way, vice-president; Mr. R. H. Gill, secretary; and Mr H
bradshaw minute secretary of the Congress.
Correspondence; was read from various organisations in
other States regretting inability to be represented, at Congress
owing to distance being too great to admit ’of attendance in
the required time.
. Mr - Fr ank Hyett, as' Chairman of the Credentials - Com-
mittee, presented a report, on the credentials of delegates,
which was adopted.
OFFICIAL BULLETIN.
It was resolved, on the motion of Mr. G. F. McGowan,
seconded by Mr. Roughton:—
"That an official bulletin be issued by this Congress and
that sufficient copies of such bulletin be issued to the


secretary of each affiliated body for circulation
amongst their respective members; and also that
sufficient copies of such bulletin be forwarded to the
secretaries of the Trades Halls in this and other States
for circulation amongst unions.”
POLITICAL LABOR COUNCIL’S ACTION.
A letter was received from Mr. Arch. Stewart, Secretary
of the Central Executive of the Political Labor Council of
Victoria, containing the following resolution carried at the
p L.C. Annual Conference respecting Conscription:
“That this Conference absolutely pledges itself to oppose
Conscription of human life, and that it be a direction
from this Conference to the various P.L.C % branches
and unions throughout Victoria to take immediate
action to select candidates to contest the next election
in opposition to all Labor members who vote in favor
of Conscription, that the unions and branches in
other States be asked to take similar action,, and in
the event of such action not being taken by the
V ranches or unions, the Central Executive be in-
structed by this Conference to refuse to endorse the
nominations.”
DANGERS OF CONSCRIPTION
Mr. J. MuNeill (A.W.U.) moved:—-
■“(1). That this Congress, representing the trades unions
of Australia, pronounces itself opposed to the Con-
scription of human life upon the grounds That society
has not given to its members their individual lives,
but only assures to the individual his preservation,
and in a highly organised democratic state of society
the full advantage of civilisation which'social organisa-
tion has developed through human history.
‘"Therefore, the State ethically has no prerogative to con-
strain any of its citizens to sacrifice their lives for any
cause- whilst, however, it is recognised that when the
existence of the State is threatened, it is within the
true functions of Government to withdraw from any
citizen for the protection of the State any or all -of the
property which is theirs, not by individual right, but
by State endowment alone, and which is only possible
to him because of the existence of the State.”
“(2). That this Congress, therefore, emphatically records
its detestation of military Conscription of life, and, on
behalf of the industrially organised workers of Aus-
tralia, resolutely sets its face against any attempt to
foist Conscription upon the people of Australia.
“(3). That, moreover, Conscription introduces the vile
means by which (as in Germany) organised Labor is
overawed in the interests of Capital.”
“(4). That the principle of compulsion fosters the mili-
tarist and anti-industrial spirit, and is necessarily the
fruitful cause of war.”
"(S>. That this Congress affirms its active sympathy with
the cause of the Allies, and is firm in the belief that,
provided the system of voluntary military service be
supported by the collective resources of the people
forming the State, it will offer undoubtedly the most


effective means of defeating our enemies, while it
would leave no machinery, as would Conscription, to
be used after the war to quell the aspirations of the
workers.”
“(6). That, accordingly, this Congress, being fully sensible
of the gravity of the Empire situation, calls upon the
Federal Parliament to at once enact the following
(a) Increase the pay of the private to 10/- per day;
the separation allowance to his wife or dependent
mother to 2/- per day, and 1/- per day for each child
under 17 years. That in regard to pension, allowances
to be paid at the rate of £l/10/- per week, and his
wife or dependent mother 50 per cent, of such sum,
while each child under 17 years receive £26 per an-
num. In the case of the death of a soldier, his widow
• or dependent mother to receive £l/10/- per week,
and £26 per annum for each child under 17 years.
(b) That the payments above be made retrospective
from the inception of the war in respect to soldiers'pay
and separation allowance, and may be met by the issue
to the soldier (or his assignees) of debentures on war
loan terms. Pension rights to be readjusted corres-
pondingly. (c) That all officers in like ratio shall
have increased pay, but same pension rights only as a
private.”
“(7). That in respect to all adult citizens of the Common-
wealth (other than soldiers), the Federal Government
shall for war purposes and for industrial
development during the continuance of the war, and
until the war loan is liquidated, all rents, interest and
profits or other incomes in excess of the equivalent of
the pay of privates.”
Mr. McNeill said that he was a unit in an organisation
from which nearly 30,000 members had gone to fight in the
war. Those men had gone voluntarily; and yet, despite the
great responses which there had been under voluntaryism, the
capitalistic classes were not satisfied.
SACRIFICES BY THE PEOPLE.
Mr. J. Kean (Ballarat) seconded the motion. He said
that, apart from the numbers of men the workers of Australia
had supplied in the war, there had been a heavy sacrifice by
the working classes in the additional cost of commodities, n©
less than £40,000,000 having been paid away in increased
charges. The capitalists had been asserting that Conscription
was essential to provide more men; that, in short, the private
was to be the deliverer of Australia. If that were so, let the
capitalist get down to the same rate of pay and show his
bona fides.
MANHOOD AND WEALTH.
Mr. T. P. Howard (Adelaide) moved as an amendment:—
“That this Congress is opposed to Conscription of males
of military age unless it is clearly shown bv those
who are prosecuting the war that there is no other
way out; and, in that case, the wealth of the nation
shall first be the subject of Conscription, and that a
referendum of members of the organisation be taken
to confirm the consent of the trades unions.”


Mr. J, Carr, M.L.C. (Adelaide) seconded the amendment.
Mr. D. P. Russell (Clerks) said that the resolution was not
so much a resolution as an essay. What was wanted a
definite resolution against Conscription, and setting out unmis-
takably what the attitude of the working class would be to
Conscription.
Mr. W. C. Melbourne (Adelaide) supported the amend-
ment. In a serious emergency like war they had to look at
the facts, and he considered that the amendment endeavored
to do that.
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S ATTITUDE.
Mr. J. F. Hannan, M.H.R., said he was satisfied that Con-
scription would not become the law of the land so long as the
Federal Labor Government was in power. Congress should
not assemble in a carping spirit, without something construc-
tive to go forth. Delegates had to choose between the volun-
tary system and that of Conscription, and, if against Con-
scription, be prepared to give the Government *of the country
every legitimate support in the carrying out of the war on
the lines which were now being pursued.
Mr. Howard’s amendment was defeated by 219,368 votes
to 50,453.
SECOND DAY, MAY 11
UNCOMPROMISING HOSTILITY.
Next morning Mr. J. McNeill explained that, as a result
of suggestions which had been made, he now desired to with-
draw his motion, in order that specific propositions could be
presented for the consideration of Congress.
Congress having consented to the withdrawal of the pre-
vious motion, Mr. J. McNeill moved:—
“That this Congress records its uncompromising hostility
to Conscription of life and labor, and, on behalf of the
industrially organised workers of Australia, resolutely
declares against any attempt to foist Conscription
upon the people of Australia.”
The resolution was carried by 258,018 votes to 753.
EFFECTIVE VOLUNTARY SYSTEM
The second resolution was moved by Mr. J. McNeill, and
seconded by Mr. O’Callaghan, in the following form: —-
‘That this Congress is firm in the belief that, provided
the system of voluntary military service be supported
by the financial resources of the nation, it will be most
effective, while it would leave no machinery—as would
Conscription—to be used after the war to crush the
aspirations of the workers.”
To this an amendment was moved by Mr. R. H. Charrett,
and seconded by Mr. G. F. McGowan:—
“That this Congress believes that, provided the system of
voluntary military service be supported by the financial
resources of the nation, it will be effective.”


The amendment was defeated by 152,377 votes to 99,812,
and the resolution, with, alterations by Mr. Hyett, was carried
in these words, by 199,384 votes to 40,737:
“That this Congress is firm in the belief that the system
of voluntary military service has been successful, and
if supported by the financial resources of the nation,
it will be most effective, while it would leave no
machinery—as would Conscription—to be used after
the war to crush the aspirations of the workers/*
LABOR PARTY’S DUTY.
The following resolution, proposed by Mr. Hyett, and
seconded by Mr. J. Kean, was carried unanimously:—
“That, as the. war policy of the capitalist class consists of.
the Conscription of human life and unlimited robbery
of the citizens of the nation that protects them, this
Congress affirms that it is the duty of the Labor party
to. reverse the capitalist war policy and prohibit the
exploitation of the public.”
CONSCRIPTION OF WEALTfI.
The following resolution, proposed by Mr. Hyett, and
seconded by Mr. Howard (S.A.), was carried by 247,015 votes
to 10,320:
“That in order to give effect to Labor policy, the Federal
Parliament be called upon to—
(a) Increase the pay of the private to 10/- per day,
with corresponding increases in respect to*
separation allowances, to apply to all dependents.
(b) Increase pension allowances of privates to 30/-
per week, the wife or adult dependent to receive
in addition half of such sum, with an allowance
of £26 per annum to each child under the age of
17 years.
(c) Conscript wealth, and place a first lien upon one-
fifth of all property and assets in Australia over
£3OO in value, and during the currency of the
war and for such time thereafter as may be
necessary appropriate all rents, interests and
profits or other income in excess of £3OO per
. annum.”
DIRECT ACTION PROPOSED.
The following resolution, moved by Mr. D. P. Russell, and
seconded by Mr. Corossi, was defeated by 129,730 vote's to
103,728:
“That in the event of the Federal Parliament attempting
to impose Conscription of life or labor upon the people,
or any section of the people,, either by Act of Parlia-
ment or by regulation, this Congress recommends the
Unions throughout Australia to declare a general
cessation of work, and that the Unions be asked to
empower the Executive of Congress to declare the
time, duration and method of conducting such strike.”'


TAKING OF REFERENDUM,
The following resolution, proposed by Mr. Buchanan
(Pastrycooks), and seconded by Mr. Hyett, was carried: —-
“That this Congress asks all Trades Unions in Australia
to immediately take a referendum of their members as
to the advisability of a general cessation of work in the
event of the Federal -Government introducing Con-
scription of life and labor in Australia.”
A DELEGATION.
Messrs. N. G. Grant (President), F. H. Holland (Secre-
tary), and J. Hills, of the No Conscription Fellowship, were
admitted, and delivered brief addresses on the aims and objects
of their organisation.
OPPOSING CONSCRIPTIONISTS AND FUTURE WORK.
The following resolution, moved by Mr, J. J. O’Reilly
(Broken Hill), and seconded by Mr. Gerson, was carried:—
“(a) That Congress heartily co-operate with the Victorian
and New South Wales Political Labor movement, and
any other section which falls into line, in opposing all
political candidates who speak or vote in favor of Con-
, scription.
“(b) That Congress appoint a Federal Executive of 12
members to carry on the necessary educational and
organising work to defeat Conscription, on the policy
laid down by this Congress; the Executive to be
empowered to call upon the Unions for financial assist-
ance and to call Congress together, if necessary.”
The Executive already mentioned Was elected.
ATTITUDE OF A.N.A.
The following resolution, proposed by Mr. R. S. Ross, and
seconded by Mr. T. J. Miller, was carried:—
“That in view of the pronounced anti-working class atti-
tude and propaganda of the A.N.A. of Victoria in con-
nection with Conscription, this Congress is of the
opinion that a Friendly Society claiming to represent
nationhood, and in which there are many Trades
Unionists, should not identify itself with reactionary
■ and partisan politics, nor oppose the policy of indus-
trial Labor, and this Congress condemns the methods
resorted to in obtaining signatures to the A.N.A. Con-
scription petition, such being signed by minors of both
sexes.”
PROTESTS AGAINST IMPRISONMENT.
A resolution from the combined unions of Broken Hill,
proposed by Mr. M. P. Considine, and bearing on the imprison-
ment of Messrs 5 . Barker, Leslie, Klausen and others under the
War Precautions Act, was ruled out of order, but after discus-
sion, the following, by Messrs. E. J. Holloway and Roughton,
was agreed to: —
“That this Congress protests against the imprisonment of
Messrs. Barker, Leslie, Klausen and others, and
appoints a deputation to wait on the Acting Prime
Minister to request their immediate release.”


Messrs. W. Smith, G. F. McGowan, R. S. Ross, E. J. Hol-
loway, B. Mulvogue, W. Miller, R. H. Gill (secretary), F.
Anstey, and the President (Mr. C. J. Bennett) were appointed
as members of the deputation.
The Chairman congratulated Congress upon the result oi
its and stated that the National Executive would
be heartened in its work by the unanimity which had prevailed.
Congress terminated at 10.30 p.m.
APPENDIX.
At the meeting of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council bn
July 6, matters in connection with the work of the Congress
were dealt with, and it was agreed that the official bulletin
should be issued at as early a stage as possible. The follow-
ing resolutions were also passed:—
“That permission be granted to the Congress Executive to
circularise the various Unions, making an - appeal for
funds to carry on the No Conscription campaign.”
“That the Trades Hall Council grant permission to circu-
larise the Trades Hall Councils in other States for the
purpose of asking them to inaugurate similar move-
