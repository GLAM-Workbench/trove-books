WHETHER the
cycling feat
which Ar-
thur Rich-
ardson ic-
cently accomplished?that of
making a circuit of the con-
tinent of Australia ?will be
of any value to the community is a moot point. The
sceptical argue that beyond furnishing a good advertisement
for the manufacturers and agents for the make of cycle and
tyres which carried him through it is fruitful of nothing. There
are, however, several other lessons to be learnt from the per-
formance of such a ride, and the chief of these appears to be
that it affords a demonstration of the utility of the cycle as a
rapid means of locomotion in all classes of country, and under
any and all conditions, and furnishes an illustration of what an
overlanding cyclist can do, and could do, should necessity arise.
For the cycle and its use by intrept d wheelmen may be
claimed a considerable share of the pioneering work on the


West Australian Goldfields, a tract of country once a desolate
waste, but now inhabited by a population numbered by thous-
ands. Once the presence of gold in large quantities became
known in the deserts, the cycle played the most prominent part
in the opening up of new country, and in a large measure in
paving the way in all directions for the spreading of the pros-
pector and the shoals of diggers and others who followed in
his train. ? The ship of the desert,? as the cycle has been
called, by the efforts of the cycling overlanders, has been in the
foreground in the rapid advancement of the treasure producing
areas of this vast continent, and future chronicles of the earlier
history of the mining era of the Golden West must acknow-
ledge that to the machine and those who utilised it Western Aus-
tralia?the world, in fact?owes much gratitude. The Premier
of W.A. recently paid a graceful tribute to the work of the
special cyclist and the work of the cycle on the goldfields?an
acknowledgment long looked for by the wheelman referred to.
Che Superiority of the tUheel.
No greater evidence or testimony as to the superiority of
the wheel for pioneeiing work could have been looked for than
that given by Mr. Alex. Forrest, M.L.A., at the formal reception
to Richardson upon his arrival at Perth. Some of the country
traversed by the cyclist in the far north had been crossed by
Mr. Forrest during one of his expeditions, and in referring to this
the latter gentleman contrasted the rate of progress made by each
of them. The solitary cyclist got through the country ten times
as fast as the earlier explorer, who with horses had to carry con-
siderable provisions for himself and attendants, because of the
comparatively slow rate of progress. With the cycle as a means
of progression, 20 lbs. of flour sufficed, where, with horses, pro-


visions carried by several pack horses and sufficient to last for
weeks is necessary. The acknowledgment of men who have
braved the dangers of early explorations that the cycle has
superseded other means of transit is surely sufficient to
convince the most pessimistic that, in this particular, Richard-
son?s ride has not been devoid of some value.
fl marvellous Teat.
While there are sceptics as to the value of such a journey,
there are few, if any, who will gainsay that in its accomplish-
ment Richardson has displayed to a more than ordinary
extent considerable extrepidity, pluck and resource. The other
wheelmen ?the White Bros, and D. McKay?who, in their
journey round the continent in company, met Richardson in
Perth a day after the completion of his ride, refer to his feat as
a ? marvellous ? one. This, we may assume, because of his
having traversed the thousands of miles of solitary Australian
bush and desert country unaccompanied. The other over-
landing rides which have placed Australian cyclists before
others of the world in such work have certainly been eclipsed
by the journey which Richardson concluded on the 4th of
February. His daily experiences will doubtless prove inter-
taining to many when set forth in detail. At present a brief
interview with the overlander, which drew forth some pic-
turesque sidelights on the many vicissitudes and experiences
which he underwent, may prove interesting.
Preparations for the Ride.
An engineer by profession, Richardson had few misgivings
as to his being able to repair his machine in the event of a


breakdown when hundreds of miles away from any human
habitations. Inured to bush life, and particularly the dreary
sandy deserts, by reason of his eight years? prospecting work
on the outer fringe of the WA. goldfields, and versed in ? the
art of living like a blackfellow,? as he himself terms it, the
possibility of his failure to ? circumcycle ? the continent never
for a moment entered his mind. ? When I bought a machine
in 1896 and learned to ride it,? he remarked, ? and three weeks
later expressed my intention of doing what no other cyclist
had done across, via Eucla and Port Augusta,
to Adelaide?those who heard of it called me foolhardy
and, after vainly endeavouring to dissuade me from making
the attempt, predicted that I would not succeed. Succeed,
I did, however, and to show that the feat was not an impossible
one, but merely one which required to be done to be emulated,
witness the dozens of wheelman who bowl across the deserts
abounding between this colony and the East without giving
the slightest thought to any danger or possibility of perishing
from hunger or thirst. There were the same prophets of disaster
to the fore when it became known that I was starting for
a ride round the continent, who looked upon the undertaking
as a foolhardy one. Though I had not the slightest desire
to provide a sweet morsel for the cannibal blacks, which,
we are told roam all over the unknown regions of the far
north, or to become a victim of the tropical heat and the
deceptive mirage, I had made up my mind to lead the way
in riding round Australia on the wheel. Even the Dunlop
Tyre Company, who have been so helpful to wheelmen in the
accomplishment of overland journeys, at first declined to
encourage or assist me. However, I managed to overcome
their scruples, and having finally arranged as to my machine,
outfit, &c., was ready to start.?

Object of the Journey.
Asked as to his object in undertaking the journey,
Richardson acknowledged that a love of adventure and
pioneering work were the main reasons which prompted
him. ?Besides,? he said, ?during my life on the goldfields
I had met several men who had roughed it in Western
Queensland and on the Kimberley, and I always had a
yearning to see the country, which, to the vast majority,
even in Australia, is still as a closed book. I had, during
1897, been across to the South Australian border from the
Coolgardie fields, and I wanted to traverse the continent
higher up. In addition, monetary considerations and the
offers made me should I succeed in getting round were a
further inducement.?
tieavy travelling to Roebourne.
?What caused you to go north at the outset instead of
south and east ?? was a question put to the overlander, to which
he replied, ? Because of enquiries which I had prosecuted
I was of opinion that I would get through what might be
termed the 1 bad ? country under the most favourable weather
conditions of the year. Taking the rainfall and astronomical
conditions of the past few years as a guide, by starting in
June and going north through the Murchison, the tropical
rains would be over, the most temperate weather would be
prevalent about the time that I expected to be crossing from
Derby to Queensland, and water would then also be more
easily obtainable than at any other time of the year.?


? Did you find these conditions fall as you expected ? ?
?In the main my anticipations were realised. Had I
waited another month before setting out I would undoubtedly
have fared much better, for from the day subsequent to my
departure from Perth, right up as far as Roebourne, I experi-
enced terribly severe wintry weather. The rivers and creeks
in the Murchison, Gascoyne, Ashburton, and West Pilbarra
districts were all in high flood, and the country for miles
upon miles was a perfect quagmire, rendering riding at
times an impossibility. Night after night I was compelled
to camp out in the drenching rain, and at times without
shelter. The boggy nature of the country from the Mur-
chison northwards often forced me to tramp for miles
through the mud, and so heavy was the going that occasion-
ally the chain became so clogged that I was forced to
take it off the machine altogether. At all the stations I met
with most hospitable treatment. The marshy country and
the swollen rivers necessitated wading through with the
machine above my head on many occasions. It was in
the hilly country that the fastest progress was made, though
I would not have cared to have been seen by either the
manufacturers of my machine or the makers of the tyres
dashing down through some of the rocky gorges, with the
machine leaping and bounding in all directions over rocks
and across ruts. Though such treatment was unfair to the
machine it was the only way to get over the ground. You
had to let your machine go down the hills to make up
time and counteract the continual tramp, tramp, through the
boggy country. At Bangemall, an almost deserted mining
centre on the Lyons River, I rode down a gorge which the
miners told me was considered even dangerous for pack
horses. On all of the stations through this Nor?-West


country 1 found that the cycle had to a large extent
superseded the horse, and machines are to be found at
nearly all the homesteads.?
Along the nor?-tuest Coast.
? �nce beyond Roebourne, however,? continued
Richardson, ?the rains ceased, and the weather conditions
altered altogether. Along the Nor?-West coast, through
Wallal and La Grange Bay to Derby, I had to traverse
some long and weary stretches of loose sand. To get
thiough comfortably and lessen the weight of my machine by
carrying few provisions, I kept going day and night between
the stages. The road was in parts lonely and deserted,
Beyond Condon, and after a heavy day?s trudging through
the sand, I reached a solitary spot known as Hardy?s Well.
It was exceedingly lonely, but as I approached the well,
you can imaging how startled I was to hear someone
crying and sobbing in a heartbreaking fashion. The lamenta-
tions came from an old man, who, on his way to Hall?s Creek
with horses, had lost them, together with his packs, tucker
and clothes. He was quite hysterical and lightheaded ; but I
stayed the night with him and left him in a better frame
of mind next morning, when he expressed his intention of
following my wheel tracks till met by assistance,
which I had subsequently sent out to him from the nearest
telegraph station. I never heard how he got on, but, as
the road is lonely and little frequented, I ha/e no doubt that
had I not found him, the poor old fellow would have
wandered aimlessly about in the scrub and would have
ultimately met with a terrible death.?

Country Perforated by Rat Holes.
?The experiences and difficulties which are met by
a cyclist journeying along the North-West coast are many and
varied. Those little stretches of the country that are not sandy
are all broken up by rat hcles. Possibly they are the
same as De Rougement writes of, for there are millions of
them, and they are a great nuisance. If the road is unrid-
able, and you are forced to walk, your shoes get full of
sand from breaking through into these holes. The rats are
numerous all over the plains. The rodents are somewhat similar
to the common house rat, but have longer fur and hair on the
tail. They are said to be migratory, and overrun different
parts of the country. They live in a similar manner to
rabbits. Weeks later in the Northern Territory, well on
to the Queensland Border, I saw signs of a visit of the
vermin.?
travelling by moonlight.
? Fortunately for me the moon was at full when I
was travelling through this portion of the country and
this of course made night riding less difficult and dangerous.
The only tracks which one can follow are horse pads?
made by saddle horse with a pack horse alongside
Travelling along these in the moonlight is rather ticklish
work, as all the track you can see is a dark line in the high
grass, sometimes as high as the handle-bars of the machine.
Sailing along a dark lane thus formed, seemingly riding
on and through nothing, and not knowing when or where
you will strike a stump or stone or drop into a hole?for
the country is cut up with big cracks and holes in the lime-
stone?is not the most pleasureable means of travelling


Eventually I reached Derby on the afternoon of Sunday,
July 23, having travelled 1673 miles with scarcely a day's
favourable riding.?
Derby to Hall?s Creek.
? Derby was the most northerly point on the West
Australian coast which I touched, and from there I set
my face towards the East, following the Fitzroy River
towards its source for a distance of about 200 miles to its
junction with the Margaret River, where the Fitzroy Crossing
Police Station is situated. There are stations all along the
river, mostly utilised for sheep breeding, while others run
cattle. Fifty miles beyond the Fitzroy Crossing, after
following the course of the Margaret River in a south-
easterly direction along a horse pad, I struck out due east
towards Hall?s Creek, through country which is mountainous
and rocky. There were plenty of kangaroos and wild
turkey to be seen, but I lived on ?Johnnie? cakes and fish,
with which the creeks and rivers are teaming. You can catch
sufficient fish in half an hour to provide for twenty people.
It is quite possible that De Rougemont caught some of the
1 saw fish ? of which he writes, for there are plenty of
them to be caught, and the blades of some of the fish are
over two feet long. The fish do not seem to grow to any
size.?
flt Hall?s CmK.
?One morning, just before dinner time, I rode into
Hall?s Creek, the centre of the Kimberley goldfields, of which
I had heard so much from men who had been there in the
rush three years ago, and where so many men perished.


Mr. Green, who is warden, postmaster, telegraph master,
and registrar of everything in the district, was most kind
and courteous. He showed me all there was to
see, but I must confess to being disappointed. The place
is virtually dead?a goldfield without diggers or miners,
and a diminishing population. The country is very different
in appearance to that of the Eastern goldfields, being mostly
slate, with very little diorite or ironstone. Here ended for
me all communication with the civilised world, for the
telegraph line terminates there. Before I left Hall?s Creek I
gave my machine a good overhaul in anticipation of the heavy
belt of lonely country I was about to enter, and my shoes
having parted with their soles, a sufficiency of leather was
found to give them a new pair.?
Ball?s Greek to Ord River.
As far as Hall?s Creek I had been travelling through
country which was in communication with the civilized world by
means of telegraphy. From there I had to plunge into (he
practically uninhabitable and isolated regions. Early in August I
made a start on the long journey across country towards Port
Darwin. At the first station which I struck some excellent infor-
mation as to the route and the country ahead was furnished by Mr.
Buchanan, the manager, who is one of the oldest hands on the
Kimberley. My provisions consisted mainly of flour, and with this
I made damper for food, and used it as well for bait when fishing.
Of course one cannot carry a dish for mixing flour in, and the plan
I adopted was to scoop a hole in the ground and line it with a
gunny bag. The 180 miles to the Ord River Station was through
rough, mountainous country with few tracks, but I got through
all right. From there to Wave Hill?2oo miles further on?
I had the same sort of country to travel through.


Travelling Under Difficulties,
Fish continued in plenty, and there were wild figs for
dessert. Cattle pads provided guiding paths, but they follow
down the creeks, and a man can soon get a long way out if
he is not careful. You have to be continually leaving one and
crossing a divide till you strike another. All stores for the
stations come from Port Darwin and up the Victoria River
twice a year, so that there are no waggon tracks. The old
Kimberley road has been washed out by the rain for years, and
what was a good pad eight or ten years ago is now just the
same as the rest of the country?loose, stony ground, with high
grass in places, sometimes 6ft. or Bft. high. Throughout 1
camped well away from the pads at night, and always
continued for a while after dusk for fear of the blacks, who are
noted in the district. Some of the gorges through which one
passes when getting through the mountains are very solitary
and dismal. One of them is known as Swan Creek. It is a
long defile, with cliffs on either side covered with brush and
scrubby timber. There are always blacks here, for the country
is so wild that they can spear cattle and get away into the
fastnesses of the mountains, and all the police in Western
Australia could not catch them. Day followed day in this
manner, and the loneliness at times oppressed me, though I
had no misgivings as to my getting along all right and was
never discouraged.
fl Cattle Itlusterer?s experience.
When I was out half a day from Ord River, I saw a
traveller on horseback coming over the range towards me.
When we met it turned out to be a young lubra, who belonged
to a party of musterers. One of them had met with an
accident, and she was then on her way to the station for


assistance. A day later I struck the cattle camp, one man
being there, having left his packhorses and provisions at the
Sterling River with the injured man and a black boy. Later in
the day I found the poor fellow who was hurt in a terrible
plight. Five days before I found him he had been thrown
from his horse against a tree, and he was afraid that he had
met with internal injuries. I shot some birds and made him
some broth, which was the first food he had taken for days.
He was in a pitiable plight, and utterly helpless, a hundred
miles from any human habitation. For a day and a half I
doctored him, and luckily got some quail on a waterhole.
There were plenty of natives about, but they were not hostile.
How the old fellow fared afterwards I never heard, but I left
him fairly comfortable in expectation of assistance coming out
from Ord River.
Jin Experience with Blacks.
Two days later I got to Wave Hill, and was lucky in
striking the homestead. When crossing what is known as
Black Gin Creek I noticed a thin haze of smoke about two
miles down the valley. A loud ? coo-ee,? resounding through
the hills, soon brought a mob of wild niggers up the river to
within shouting distance. They kept well up on the rise with
their spears shipped and gazed at the bike, but would not
venture near. I managed to coax one of them to approach,
which he did by degrees, and each time he stopped in hesita-
tion. I was afraid that he would clear off. The offering of
a piece of tobacco had the desired result, and I learnt from him
that ? white fellah sit down alonga creek.? As I mounted the
bike and made off along the bed of the creek they set up a
fearful yelling and screeching. They were not menacing in
their attitude, however.

A Station Burnt by the Blacks.
Twenty miles down the creek I came upon a cattle camp
formed by men who were mustering from Wave Hill
station, and that evening I got to the homestead. I should
say that I got to the site of the homestead, for it had
been burnt to the ground by the natives. The niggers put
a fire-stick to the building to windward while the men were
away mustering, and the place was quickly demolished.
Jin Unfaithful Guide.
Probably the most trying experiences which I had during
the whole journey were those met with during the trip
from Wave Hill to Victoria Downs. The interlying country is
rangy and exceedingly rough and absolutely trackless, the
only guide being the trend of the Victoria River, but with
the machine this course was utterly impracticable. Taking
the advice of the manager at Wave Hill, Mr. T. Cahill, I
visited the black?s camp on the river, and arranged with a
couple of them to show me a short cut across the ranges
and carry the provisions. Only one of them turned up,
however, and he was anything but a beauty. He was one
of the most evil-looking niggers I have seen, with a peculiar
squint in his eye. I was somewhat distrustful of him Our
provisions were made up of flour, meat, tea, sugar, etc.
which I packed in two solb. bags, into which I also put my
camera. Strapping these bags together by the tops, the boy
(ail niggers are called boys) carried it across his shoulders.
We started off with 100 miles walking in front of us, and no
track. The nigger had stated he knew a short track across


the hills, which he called ? short fella,? and we tried it. It
was teiribly heavy work tramping along a stony creek,
then over a range and down along another creek By
sundown we had tramped eighteen miles. We camped on a
creek in long grass, but from the moment we stopped I could
see that the boy was uneasy, and he at last asked to be allowed
to go back. He said that there were ?too many black
fellow all about,? and the indications were that his surmise
was correct, for there were plenty of tracks around the water-
hole. I gave the nigger to understand that an attempt to
desert meant severe punishment, and after tea we commenced
cutting grass to make a camp. The boy set to work at the
spot where we crossed the creek, while I went lower
down. Getting a good armful I started back, and as I
rounded the bend there was the boy with my tucker-bags,
&c., and his own spears, running up the opposite bank. As
I was about eighty yards away there was no chance of
catching him. I fired, and the ball split against the bank
just in front of his nose. With a yell of terror he dropped
everything he had, and scrambled into the long grass like a
dingo and disappeared. I never saw him again. It was any odds
that the nigger would join the blacks camped about, and as
they are in that locality as wild and as treacherous as any
in Australia, I packed up my traps and cleared. For hours
I travelled on through the ranges, scrambling through gorges
and across creeks, up one gully and down another, getting
along at the rate of about two miles an hour. At 2 o?clock
in the morning I rested at a small spring, thoroughly done
up. All the blacks in Australia could not have kept me awake,
and the sun was fairly high when I awoke next morning
in a wild and desolate spot and in possession of little know-
ledge as to my whereabouts.


Alone in the Wilds.
The next few days were awful in their intense loneliness
and the heavy travelling. While daylight lasted I was all
right, for I followed the lay of the country and knew that I
must strike the river in time. Even without actually getting
bushed I had a most perplexing and uncomfortable time
of it. At times I fancied that I was making great headway,
but just as I would begin to congratulate myself upon
getting out of a nasty predicament I would come slap up
against a blank wall in the shape of an impossible line of
ranges or sheer cliffs, and oft I would be forced to go up
a gorge or down a creek to look for a gap to get through,
humping the machine over stones and through an expanse
of thick, high grass?sometimes far higher than myself?
with the continual dread of receiving a shower of spears ;
scrambling up the sides of ranges as steep as the walls of a
house, and down the other side the same thing occurs again.
Sometimes the blacks would follow along the tops of the
cliffs for miles, occasionally showing themselves, and probably
waiting for me to camp, but at sundown I would boil my billy
and then push on again into the dark, and slinking through the
grass like a dingo, camp away from the bike, with no fire
and myriads of mosquitoes to worry me till dawn.
Citing like a Blackfdlow.
My tucker gave out, and I lived on what I could catch.
Lily roots, which one obtained by groping in the
shallow pools under the plants (a species of water lily), and
which are about the size and shape of an onion, wild tigs,
and other fruits and berries, and fish formed my chief
articles of diet, for kangaroos and other game were not too
plentiful.


Reaching Victorla Downs.
One fine, clear morning, I clambered to the top of a
range, and winding away through the hills beheld the
Victoria River. Following its course along a very rough
pad, and feeling terribly done up and ill, I reached the station
a day or two later. I must have looked a pretty object with
my beard half grown, my shoes tied together with pieces
of hide, and the soles made of green hide laced on to the
uppers. You can imagine how welcome under the cir-
cumstances was the hospitality extended towards me by
Mr. Watson, the manager. For ten days, while I suffered
terribly from a sort of low fever, he tended and nursed
me, and had me fit and well for the journey to Katherine
which was an eight or ten days? stage.
dwelling with Company.
Business called Mr. Watson to Port Darwin, and when
I arrived he was getting his horses in and having them
shod for the trip. Through wild country we travelled for
over a week in company, he and a boy riding horses and
driving nine spare horses, while I rode my machine where
possible, and tramped when I couldn?t ride. For the first
time water began to get scarce, and the constant watch
against sudden attacks from the'? blacks made us particularly
wakeful.
fl midnight Scare.
No one in these regions goes out mustering or even
to the creek for a bucket of water without firearms, and
even our black boy carried a big revolver. It was amusing


to see him each morning tracking off after the horses, revolver
in one hand and bridle and stockwhip in the other, in
regular 11 Deadwood Dick? fashion. One dark, stilly night
? Dolo,? the black, gave us a great start. I had been tramping
all day, and was terribly tired. We had camped in some
high grass near the Little Gregory River gorge, where more
men have been murdered by the blacks than on any other
part of the track. Just about midnight, bang ! bang ! went
a revolver close to our heads. We were on end mighty
lively, and ready for fight, but were somewhat disgustecl�
though relieved, to find that ?Dolo? had brought his mark
down, but instead of a nigger it turned out to be only a
dingo. The anim.il had got to the windward of our meat,
and was desirous of obtaining some. In his peregrinations
?Dolo? mistook him for a nigger crawling through the
long grass close to his head*
Deserted Cattle Stations.
We passed three deserted stations, which are known
as Willaroo, Delamere, and Price?s Creek. Willaroo was the
nearest to Victoria Downs, and carried 12,000 head of cattle,
but the blacks had most of them, only 3,000 head having
come off the station. The last manager, Mr. Scott, was
speared there about two years ago. Mr.Watson told me that the
place was often the scene of battle between the natives and
whites. The niggers were so aggressive as to occasionally
spear horses and cattle alongside the stock yard, and on one
occasion they had the cook?a Celestial?besieged for days
while the others were away.


Arrival at Katherine.
At about 4 p.m. on September 9th, we rode into Katherine
Station, which is 220 miles south of Port Darwin, on the
transcontinental telegraph line. You can imagine what a
feeling of satisfaction I experienced when we crossed the
river and proceeded to the telegraph station, after traversing
the solitary and difficult belt lying between Hall?s Creek and
the line. It was the first time that a cycle had been through
the country, but it had stood splendidly. The telegraph
master, Mr. Henderson, and his wife gave me a hearty
welcome.
H Peep at Port Darwin.
The journey up to Port Darwin took three days, and
once again I saw the ocean, into which as Murif had done,
I dipped the bike. Port Darwin, with all its novelties and
peculiarities and the manner in which I was treated, formed
a strong temptation for me to prolong my visit, but I wanted
to meet the White Bros, and Mackay, and with tWs end in
view followed the telegraph line down a distance of 700
miles to Powell?s Creek along the route which Mather,
Coleman and McDonald had traversed.
meeting White in Central Australia.
The journey down was uneventful, but you can imagine
what surprise I felt when I lan'ded at Powell?s Creek "and
found, in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Kell to welcome me,
Frank White, who had arrived from Queensland in an
exhausted condition a few hours prior to my arrival.


hospitality at Powell's Creek.
Powell?s Creek is famed among overlanders, teamsters,
and line repairers travelling up the line to Port Darwin,
because of the warmth of the hospitality extended to all
of them by the telegraph master, Mr. Kell, and his wife.
It was at this oasis in the desert that McDonald, who
sped across Australia from north to south in less than one
month, spent five years of his life. The other cyclists
who have been through?Murif, Mather, and Coleman?all
speak in glowing terms of the excellent treatment meted
out to them at this, one of the most important stations on
the line. When day after day a man toils along under
the broiling sun, and night after night hides himselt
away in the solitary bush or dreary scrub, it is some
comfort and encouragement to know that ahead a warm
welcome is awaiting him. Frank White was in a most
exhausted condition, and was exceedingly anxious as to
the condition of his brother and Mackay, whom he had
left without food or water 50 miles out on the baking
plains. For two days we were in a state of unrest, but
one evening at sundown the niggers who had been sent
out with pack horses and provisions returned with the
two wheelmen, who had nearly perished, but who, in
their dogged persistency to cycle round the continent, re-
fused to ride the horses, but came in on their wheels by
easy stages.
Starting for Queensland.
It was a happy time we spent at Powell?s Creek, and
the four of us needed rest. During part of the time we
occupied ourselves in overhauling the machines, and I


made some water cans to serve me when traversing
the stage to Queensland, and when completed they carried
three quarts. A day before I resumed my journey, the
others set off for Port Darwin, and we parted under
agreement to meet again at Perth if we all got through
safely. The temperature was at 115 degrees in the shade
when I struck out for Queensland, and entered upon a
ride which those who had just come across told me meant
certain death. One of the dangers which I had to guard
against up to this stage now disappeared, for the country
was too dry and open for niggers at that time of the
year. Mile after mile one travels over open plains as hard
as flint, but which in the heavy rain season becomes soft.
During the winter season cattle are grassed there, and the
ruts made by them in the pads across the plains make
them unrideable. Hot northerly winds blew against me
day after day, and the tropical sun beating down upon
me unmercifully, with the plains seemingly cracking in the
heat, made travelling exceedingly trying and wearisome.
Bushed on an Open Plain.
I lost over half a day in a peculiar manner on these
plains. I had camped at a water hole for the night. Next
morning I selected what I thought was the proper track
from the many which led from the water hole, but found
that it did not follow in the right direction. Many others I
tried, but without success, and I had the somewhat unusual
experience of being bushed on an open plain. Cattle when
travelling in mobs in dry seasons can smell water when
within two or three miles of a hole, and once they do smell
water they stampede in all directions. This accounts for
the labyrinth of tracks which I found myself in, and which


caused me to have lunch there as well as breakfast. Event-
ually I found the proper path, and rode well into the dusk
to make up time, for the sight of diminishing provisions
causes one to become feverishly anxious to lose no time.
Overcome fcv Rear.
That week of cycling will never be forgotten by me.
From morning till night I toiled on over the arid plains
and through the low lying scrub country. Sparing in the use
of water which I carried and only drinking when forced to, I
was constantly tantalised and tempted by the shimmering
mirage which seemed to accompany me. One long day I
seemingly rode or trudged along with a calm clear lake away
in front of me. I camped for lunch in the shade of a tree,
the leaves of which could have been shot off with a saloon
rifle in ten minutes, and try as I would that tempting lake
became to me almost a reality. I must have been feverish and
hot-headed that afternoon, for I rode as if mad until I reached
a deserted station known as Era Downs. Here I camped
for the night, and was so exhausted that for the next day
I lay on the floor and spent a wretched time. The place
was only a log humpy with the iron roof half blown off. The
blasting hot winds which felt like a furnace swept across
the plains and howled dismally through the cracks of
the building, while the swinging sheets of roofing iron
creaked incessantly. I altogether forget leaving that place,
but I can remember being quite terrorised during the night,
because of my half-demented condition and the dirgelike moan-
ing of the wind. Through it all the one thought uppermost in
my mind was that of conserving the water in the cans which
I had made, but the want of food must have driven me
away from Era Downs and urged me onward.

Discovering a Real Lake.
I had only ridden for about four hours on an excellent pad,
when I noticed a sudden change in the country. The bare
hot plains gave place to scrubby stony lands, which fall
away rapidly in places to breakaways and washaways.
Before I could realise it, I came upon a settlement and beheld
lubras and other natives about. Lying in a deep, scrubby
hollow was a fine lagoon, oval in shape and containing a
fair amount of water, dn two minutes I found myself
shaking hands with a police trooper, and learned that I had
come upon the famous Anthony?s Lagoon Police Station.
Mr. Giles, the trooper, made me most comfortable, and I
had a fine clean up. I took a shower in a primitive fashion
by standi >g on a box while the natives threw buckets of
water over me. I stopped at the station for a couple of
days until thoroughly well again.
nearing Queensland.
The next stage, as far as Brunette Downs, was another
waterless one, but there was not such monotonous bare plains,
and the journey occupied only two days. Here it was that
I saw signs of a visitation of rats. The open, grassy downs
country which is crossed between Anthony?s Lagoon and
Brunette Downs was alternated by red loamy rises and
flats, with low timber and scrub. I camped at a ?gilgi,?
or waterhole, on the first night out, and the next day reached
the station. Thirty thousand head of cattle are carried on
Brunette Downs, which is managed by Mr. Hutton, one
of the best known and most popular men in Northern
Australia and Western Queensland. A herd of goats which
thev run there provides good milk and a change from beef.


Taking a Short Cut.
Heavy rains fell while I spent a couple of days with
Mr. Hutton, and the black soil country became utterly
unrideable. As far as Alexandra Station I had an exceed-
ingly rough time, the stage of 66 miles being made against
strong head winds and over bumpy plains. From Powell?s
Creek I had pursued the .same track as that followed by
the White Bros, and McKay, but instead of keeping south-
east along the track to Camooweal, which is across the
Queensland border, and then striking north to Burketown,
I determined to cut across country and strike the Camoo-
weal-Burketown Road, about 200 miles north of the former
place. This I succeeded in doing, but though it saved me
nearly 300 miles travelling I had a long weary stage of 108
miles across waterless waste. Once into the Herbert Vale
station I had left the Northern Territory behind me, and
was into the somewhat mountainous country over the Queens-
land border. At Lilly Lagoon I struck the mail road from
Commonweal to Burketown. Following it up for a couple
of hundred miles and running parallel with the Gregory
River with its fine wide waters fringed with fig trees and
pandamus palms I reached Burketown and civilisation once
more on October 23rd, nearly five months from the time of
starting.
Crossing through Queensland.
Of my journey through Northern Queensland and across
the fine pastoral and mining countries from Burketown till
reaching the coast at Townsville, there would be much to
tell, but these parts having been traversed by cyclists for
some time I need say nothing save that all along I me: with


kindest treatment, either at the ?out back? mining camps,
with the teamsters, at the far-back 'station homesteads,
or in the towns. Crocodiles I saw in plenty all the way
across the north of Australia, and they continued well on
to Southern Queensland. I cannot say that I had any
hairbreadth escapes, however. Alligators were seldom
seen, except near the coast line, where the tidal waters
affect the rivers or creeks. One morning, after a steady
climb of 25 miles to the top of a big range running parallel
with the coast, I, for the first time, got a glimpse of the
Eastern coast, with Townsville lying on Cleveland Bay f
30 miles away. The first view of the Eastern Ocean was
a fine streak of blue on the horizon. It had taken me over
three months to cross from East to West of the continent-
Down the Eastern Coast.
Along the Eastern coast, through Rockhampton, Gympie,
and Brisbane, then over the border into New South Wales,
and down to Sydney I enjoyed fine weather, fairly good
roads, and magnificent scenery. Everywhere I met with
a great reception, and enjoyed myself immensely. Bush
fires were prevalent from Albury to Melbourne, but I landed
at the Victorian capital on Christmas Eve. Four days later
I left for Adelaide, and on January sth set out for West
Australia.
nearing Rome.
Up to the time that I left Port Augusta and entered into
the desert country lying between there and our eastern
goldfields I had spent a pleasant tour from Queensland. Here
again, however, I had to face several hundred miles of


heavy, dreary travelling. Knowing that the old track was
somewhat sandy I tried a new track and found the going
was much easier. To Caloona Station, on the eastern edge
of the Nullabar Plains and near the coast line, I kept to
the old route. From there, however, I kept nearly a hundred
miles inland and crossed the plains where there was a fairly
good pad, and much less sand than on the old road. From
Eucla I kept to the old road as far as Eyre?s Sand Patch, and
then went along a totally new route for 140 miles to Pontons.
Then I crossed the sandy deserts to Frazer?s Range, and got
to Norseman late in January. From Coolgardie to Perth I
had a rather bad time of it, but I finished the circuit in a
day less than eight months, full of go, and could do it again
straight off if necessary.
Health Conditions.
Many people warn me that I shall feel the effects of the
ride later on. How that can be 1 am at a loss to understand.
The trials were no greater than hundreds of our prospectors
have had to withstand, and many of them are undergoing
similar trials to-day in the search for gold ? out back.? Our
special wheelmen of the earlier days have had to bear
similar hardships and have come through them all right.
Hundreds of times have men, while out pioneering on the
deserts been in similar fixes to those which I found myself
in, and they have got out of them all right, and no one
was any the wiser nor were they any the worse for it. Only
tho.e who have done pioneering and prospecting work
know what these men have suffered in the opening up of
the country and know what a great factor they have been in
the remarkably rapid progression of this colony


S'
Conclusion.
One would have thought that upon the completion
of his 11,500 miles ride Richardson would have taken a well
earned rest; but not so, for he immediately volunteered
for the Westralian Bushman?s Contingent?was accepted
and rated as Sergeant-Major, a position which he held in
the South Australian Militia, to which he belonged for
three years previous to his taking to prospecting on the
W.A. goldfields. Unfortunately after braving all kinds of
risks in his ride around the continent, Richardson met with
an accident shortly < fter joining the corps, being thrown
from his horse during mounted drill, resulting in a fractured
arm. But despite this mishap the plucky rider sailed with
his troop for the Cape, where he will no doubt add further
renown to the already well-known name of ?Arthur
Richardson,? Cyclist.
