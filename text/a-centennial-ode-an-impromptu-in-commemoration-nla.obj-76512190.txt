(AN IMPROMPTU.)
By HENRY HALLORAN, C.M.G.
An ode do they ask for the time now at hand,
A song that shall speak to the ends of the earth
Of the marvellous growth, and more marvellous birth
Of the peoples who thrive in this great Southern land ?
Tho? a scorn burns within me more potent than words
Of the idols of clay which we bow to to-day,
There?s a love that would still my old blessings repeat
To the jubilant streams, and the sun-gladden?d birds,
To be flung to the winds by those messengers fleet,
Chasing sunbeams that never are willing to stay,
Of this land of the South, ?this perennial May.
Down the vista of time, through the manifold years,
The eyes of the Singer are turned in amaze,
And if for a moment, half blinded by tears,
Australia ! he still would be heard in thy praise ;
Still speak, bounteous land, as a son of thine own,
Of what he has seen, and of what he has known.
Land ! where beauty is no Paphian fable,
But stands, in breathing life, at every turn ;
Not as in dreams of poets ?faint, unstable ?
But forms that dazzle, and fond eyes that burn
Gleam where we move, are at the daily table,
And crown with blessings, or to blessings turn
Land ! where true freedom is a living feature.
Infused at birth in every freeman?s soul ?
The freedom which exalts the human creature,
And crowns his brow, ?a very aureole.


Where Nature, the good mother, gives no dole,
But cries with lavish voice, ? Come, take the whole
? The gold that flames for toilsome man to seize,
?The health that floats in each ambrosial breeze,
? The life that thrills the veins in forest ways,
? 1 he wealth, the peace, the length of quiet days ;
?I give thee all, give thou to Him the praise,
?To God ; O Man ! upon thy bended knees.
Father of all, to Thee we call,
Oh ! hear the prayers of one and all;
On bended knee we call to Thee:
Hear Thou our prayers, tho? poor we be,
And in Thy mercy keep this land
Still safe within Thy mighty hand.
He wills, ?the nations bow before His will,
Who rules in earth and heaven unquestioned still;
And all that seems of chance and undesigned,
Is but the movement of th? Eternal Mind ;
The spheres that roll throughout Infinitude,
The vernal growth of forest and of wood,
The march of armies on the face of Earth,
The great results which mark a Newton?s birth':
0
A sailor, traversing an unknown sea,
Shapes to a gathering of the brave and free;
A Cook came sailing down, with daring prow,
And found the land which we inhabit now:
A mighty home to strengthen and to save,
And raise a nation o?er a nation?s grave;
Where poor men may grow rich, and lost men find
A refuge midst the freest of mankind.
Light grows before Thy glance, and shadows fly,
Father of all, through all Eternity.


Not to the goddess bright Calliope,
Can bard, on theme like this, bend heart or knee.
When boyhood flush?d his veins he might have bow?d
But now another influence is avow?d ;
To One alone his knees may bow again,
To whom our hearts are never bow?d in vain :
Father of Light, to whom all hearts belong,
Do Thou, if it seem good, permit his song
Not to be writ in vain, and not to break
A silence where our hearts alone would speak?
Our thankful hearts?that Thou hast deign?d to give
A bounteous land where honest men may live;
Freed from the tyrant?s chain, the bigot?s rage;
Secure from boyhood to the close of age :
A land where plenty holds high festival
From Spring?s first breath to Winter?s gentle fall;
Where bread the honest hand may never lack,
And raiment almost grows on labour?s back.
Not such the land where, under bitter skies,
The fisher, on bleak rocks, his nets still dries ;
Where seas which shake the land?s foundation sweep,
And tempests rarely know to rest or sleep;
Where the bright sun is not a daily guest,
And peace is but a doubtful boon at best:
Despite the wealth and grandeur of the State,
The palace-homes and luxury of the great,
The peerless beauty and the martial fame,
Which spread a lustre round Britannia?s name
Not there, as here, the morning sees advance
Into a future starr?d with radiance:
A land that almost seems beyond mischance.


O ! Southern land, thy earlier fifty years,
Knew toil, and danger, and a mist of tears ;
But stalwart hearts made savage nature yield,
And laughing garners bless?d the generous field ;
Ships from the ?Far Land? brought the jocund vine,
And the waste echoed with the lowing kine ;
The hills that never heard their bleat before,
A hundred thousand sheep now wandered o?er ;
The fiery steed, from Arab currents drawn,
Made light the way, and hailed the early dawn ;
And strong men came, and wise men came, and trade
Sprang up, and revelled, blessing every grade ;
And freetrade, made for freemen, did its part
And filled the streets, and cheered the busy mart;
So the great wave rolled on for fifty years,
Until the State outgrew all doubts and fears ;
Nor did the period end till righteous Bourke
Rose, like a father-friend, and bless?d the work.
Then shone upon our eyes a virgin star,
And bright Victoria bless?d us from afar.
What since has happen?d, why should I record ?
The school-boy knows our history word by word :
The boons, by Wentworth and by Cowper won,
Which make this land more free beneath the sun
Than any land that owns the rule of One ;
And of free land, and free schools for the free,
A Parkes and Robertson released the fee.
And now, what more may mortal man desire
To raise our aim and purpose, higher and higher,
Making the peoples, North, and South, and West,
Strive to be worthy of a land so bless?d ;
Cleansing the national heart of greed and sloth,
Until we rise superior to them both,
And start upon the coming Century
With clean hearts and brave hands by land and sea,


Determined, as the years roll swiftly on,
To sanctify the freedom we have won;
To be the great apostles of the Lord,
Who cry to warring nations, ? Sheathe the sword.?
In wisdom?s court let godless conflict cease,
And all the people of the earth cry ? Peace,
? Peace and good will to man, ?tis His decree;
? And what He wills to be must surely be.?
But still, as wise men, make our bulwarks such
As foreign foe would never dare to touch ,
And make it known, anear us and afar,
That we are ready for the storm of war?
Our millions ready to defend their own,
And bear aloft the old historic throne;
Smiting each smiter ?till this land shall be
The Southern Britain of the brave and free;
Ready to save, whatever fate betide,
The ancient honor and the ancient pride.
O 1 Dream of Hope ! is this a Singer?s prayer,
Scattered awhile like summer clouds in air ?
Men of the South, it must remain with you
To bring the vision palpably to view:?
God-fearing and brave-hearted,?to unfold
The mighty future of this land of gold,
Standing secure amidst our summer sea,
The country of the just ?the kingdom of the free.
THE


THE ANGEL OF HOPE.
She sits upon the vessel?s prow,
With roseate clouds around her head;
Her helmsman with uplifted brow
Beholds the heaven above them spread,
And thus she sings her song alway
?Ah ! this will be a summer day.?
? Our land with golden harvests gleams,
Our hills still store the radiant gold,
Our cities grow on shores and streams,
And life is beauteous to behold.
O, God ! do Thou, I fondly pray,
Make every day a summer day.?
? But should it be Thine awful will
1 hat we, for sins of pride, should be
Down-smitten by the woes that kill,
We bow, as men, to Thy decree ;
But still, through every change we pray
Thou wilt not turn Thy face away.?
A hundred years ! how manifold
Thy blessings to this land have been ;
Make us Thy glory to behold,
And bless us, and our righteous Queen :
t or this, on bended knee we pray,
Thou wilt not turn Thy face away.
Mowbray, January, 1888.
