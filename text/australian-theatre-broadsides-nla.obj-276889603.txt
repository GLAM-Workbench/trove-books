one fellow-passenger, who appeared to
sleep profoundly. Soon the lady com-

the endearing names that natural history
can supply. The traveller roused up,
begged the lady to call her partner a
“ Noahs Ark ” at once, and allow him
to sleep quietly.

Owing to the perfect arrangements in the FISH & GAME DEPARTMENT,
the Company is now supplying FISH to an enormous section of the inhabitants of
the City, and residents in every Country town of New South Wales (as a matter of
fact to many towns outside, notably Brisbane).
A telegraph order from any Country town despatched before 1 p.m. (provided
the Telegraph Department do their part), is certain of execution by mail train
same day, and as Fish is carried at half parcel rates—equal to about -d. per lb. for
the most distant towns, the luxury of a fish diet is within the reach of all, the
Fresh Food and Ice Company’s prices (free on rail) being extremely moderate.
We prepay trainage, thereby effecting a saving of 50 per cant.
The Company stock all kinds of New Zealand and N.S.W. Fish, also some
American kinds —notably Salmon, and arrangements have been concluded with the
Orient line to fit a steamer. The first consignment of English Fish and Game

HER MAJESTY’S THEATRE.
(
“ The Double Event,” the new racing drama
founded by Mr. Q-eorge Darrell on the novel of
the same name by Mr. Nat. Q-ould, the well-
known sporting writer, was successfully produced
at Her Majesty’s Theatre last night. Though
the theme of the play is an old one, yet the
incidents surrounding this latest attempt to
“ nobble the favourite ” have been briskly worked
up, local colour has been employed to put a fresh
face upon scenes generally laid near Epsom or
Newmarket, and the Australian piece which has
thus resulted will hold its own well with sporting
dramas which come to us from London with a
reputation for popularity. “ The Double Event ”
is, moreover, finely staged under Mr* Eignold’s
management. The third scene in the second
act, showing the training stables, with house
and garden in the foreground, was received with
an enthusiasm which was not appeased until the
painter, Mr. John Brunton, had bowed his
acknowledgments. The success of the picture
was attributable to the beauty of a distant view,
framed by the foliage of the trees into a charm-
ing medallion of sapphire sea surrounding a
green islet, above which rose a stately mansion.
In the third act there was a clever tableau exactly
re-producing Elemington racecourse, and here
the episode of the race in which the favourite
gallops in ahead of a crowd of handsome horses,
was capitally managed. Yet another clever set
was forthcoming in the last act, where the
gardens of Mayfield House, Potts Point, disclosed
a distant view of the harbour by night, with the
lights of Eort Macquarie and the oceangoing
steamers gleaming above the water, and the
dark shores beyond hluely outlined beneath the
moon-lit sky. Here again well-merited applause
was forthcoming, and was extended to the pretty
skirt dance of the Blue Ballet (arranged by
Mme. Duvalli), in which Miss Bessie Colville
danced a pas seul, first on the darkened stage,
and then ablaze with coronet, girdle, and breast
band of coloured electric lamps, which flashed
out with dazzling effect. — S. M. Herald.

A New York paper says a former
principal of Middleborougb Academy, at
one time, on tbe approach of a tempest,
insulated a chair on four pieces of glass,
and, as he thought, politely invited a
young lady to sit on his lap for safety.
To show the popularity of the man of
letters, the young lady replied she had
rather been struck by lightning.

CRITERION THEATRE.
“Lady Bountiful” is a drama of exceptional
merit, viewed either from a literary or an artistic
point of view, and it furnishes another out of
many inetances of Mr. Pinero’s constructive
ability. There is not one character in the
lengthy cast which is week, and as far as the
production of the drama by Messrs. Brough and
Boucicault is concerned it was as perfect as the
excellent material of which their company is
composed could make it. Even the minor parts
were well filled, and on Saturday eve ring a
crowded house followed the developments of the
piece with more than the usual enthusiasm. Miss
Romer, Miss Temple, and Mr. Brough, who
have been absent only a few weeks from the
Criterion, were welcomed back most cordially,
and after each act the members of the company
had to bow their acknowledgements for double
recalls. In the part of Camilla Brent Mrs.
Brough had a heavy task, but her acting was
marked by dignity and dramatic force through-
out. The scenes with Penis were thoughtfully
worked out, and the pathos of Camilla’s inter-
view with her dying rival Margaret was so
intense in its earnestness that it must have sent
a responsive thrill through the entire audience.
Miss Temple as the pretty Margaret Neale also
achieved a gratifying success, and nothing could
have been more realistic —indeed painfully so—-
than Margaret’s n oving appeal to Camilla and
the young wife’s subsequent death. Miss Romerh
impersonation of Mrs. Neale was also excellent.
As Beatrix Brent Miss Gibson had little
to do but look pretty and interesting, and this
task was, of course, accomplished without an
effort. Miss Edith Blande was effective as Miss
Brent, if somewhat juvenile for the aunt of
grown-up neic'es ; and Miss Polly Emery as the
servant Amelia, and Miss May Burney as Mrs.
Hodnutt, a pew-opener, respectively proved how
much could be made of very little. ... In
the person of Roderick Heron is concentrated
the unmitigated selfishness of Harold Skimpole
and Turveydrop of “ Bleak House,” and the
callousness to the sufferings of others of Sir
John Chester in “Barnaby Rudge; and no
greater compliment can be paid to Mr. Boucicault
than to say that in the minds of many of the
audience he revived these creations of the great
novelist. . . . Mr. Titheradge was manly
and thorough as Denis Heron, and was par-
: S-
t
good in the fist act, and also in the
bird, where Margaret dies, and in the latter act
there was a marked recognition of the merit of
Miss Temple’s and Mr, Titheradge’s joint per-
formance. Mr. Brough was an admirable John
Neale, Mr. Cates a gentlemany and dignified Sir
Richard Philliter, and Mr. Chichester displayed
plenty of spirit as the young baronet, Sir Lucian
Brent. Mr. Carey made an excellent character
part of old Pedgrit, the snappish parish sexton.
“ Lady Bountiful ” is admirably staged, and the
morning room at Pauncourt, and the Lydgate
Church, are charmingly pretty and effective
sets. — S. M. Herald.
