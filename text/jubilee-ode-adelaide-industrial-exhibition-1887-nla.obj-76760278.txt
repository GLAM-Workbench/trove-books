JUBILEE ODE
For the Adelaide Industrial Exhibition of ISB7 ,
Some fifty years have winged their onward flight,
Since South Australia blushed in dawning light;
When Sons of Britain wide their flag unfurled.
And one more country added to the world;
Planted her soil with germs uf social rule;
And for the savage, fixed the Christian School;
Bade her God-speed, and ever onwards go;
And each advancing year, true progress show.
REFRAIN?
Sound the Paean?s note of triumph,
Roll it proudly o?er the sea!
Call remotest lands to share in
South Australia?s Jubilee!
And fifty years have rolled since yonder sun,
In South Austral*a saw that work begun;
In which, more ripe to-day, with heart and voice,
Her sires, her sons, her brothers loud rejoice ;
The work of progress, which, since time began,
Made nations kinder, man more kind to man:
Which, far as skies outspread, or billows roll,
Cements mankind, and makes the world one whole.
Sound the Paear?s note, etc.
Where Southern Cross bespangles Southern skies.
Outstretched and varied South Australia lies;
Some parts, e?en tropic growths, own kindred soil;
And scarce require the cultivator?s toil;
Some, poor and barren-seeming to the eye,
Can riches? source, in minerals, yield supply;
Whilst countless flocks and herds on bill and plain,
Attest her Nomad wealth and wide domain.
Sound the Peean?s note, etc.
Time was when dreary solitude held sway;
Where Ad?laide, mother city, greets the day ;
When night-black woods no mortal step had passed,
In conflict howled, and wrestled with the blast;
When dusky savage lurked amid his wiles,
Where sheltered cot, or loftier mansion smiles;
And hissed the snake, or screamed some lonely bird,
Where now the hum of busy life is heard.
Sound the Paean?s note, etc.
c Jti


See ! how the broad expanse of lake is spread,
Where erst the Torrens hugged his scanty bed;
And graceful craft pursues its course of speed,
Where slimy mud-banks nursed the noxious weed;
Or laughter comes, or now the playful jest,
Where loathsome insect buzzed its way to rest;
Whilst gardens bloom with flowers of cultured taste,
Where once the dismal swamp lay lone and waste.
Sound the Pfeans note, etc.
Lo! azure-eyed Athene sheds her smile,
And Learning, Art and Science rear their pile ;
And from this source shall streams of knowledge
Till native student* wise and wiser grow;
Till ripened scholars full of sages? lore,
Shall teach those truths, themselves had learnt
before;
And, though not washed by old Ilissus? stream,
Yet Ad?laide groves shall boast their Academe;
Where in the onward days and years to come.
The learned world may And a letter?d home.
Sound the Paean?s note, etc.
And half a century old her natal day;
This South Australia celebrates to-day;
And builds this shrine, whose portals open wide,
To welcome visitants from every side;
Bids all the world, from east to setting sun,
Come to her shores, and see what she has done ;
Bids all bring products, all the best which can,
From laboured art and skill flow forth to man.
Sound the Paean?s note, etc.
So Britain co mes with trophies of the loom,
And B?rance with silks, and smiles, and sweet per-
Here sapient Teuton, from the castled Rhine,
Melodious fabric shews and sparkling wine;
There, bearded Russian from his homo of snow,
Has skins and furs th? admiring crowds to show,
Whilst gathered spoils from many another land,
Attract the gaze, and charm on every hand.
Sound the Paean?s note, etc.
Hark to that shout! which born of loud acclaim;
Links South Australia?s with Victoria?s name;
Since the first time which owned our Sovereign?s
Launched this fair land of promise on its way ;
And hearts devout with lips of fervour pray,
That Heaven may guard and shield their path al-
From passing moment to their latest day;
That Queen may keep, in loyal hearts her Throne;
Our land, God-fearing may go bravely on.
Sound the Peean?s note, etc.
