THE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
g==y HE fact that the Bank of New South Wales has in the
past month removed its London office to a building
ra® constructed for itself at 29 Threadneedle Street, gives
good cause for a more detailed account of the origin
and history of this bank, which is one of the most
important banking institutions operating in our Possessions beyond
the seas. Indeed it is one of the earliest of our Colonial banks,
having been founded in 1817, and the London office having been
operated since 1851. Australia has so long been associated with the
production of gold that it is difficult to conceive the conditions which
prevailed on that Continent prior to the discoveries of the alluvial
diggings. From 1788 to 1817 the penal settlement of Botany Bay,
which was afterwards to develop into New South Wales, conducted
its financial affairs without any banking institution, and during a
great part of that period the standard of barter, rather than currency,
was rum. Note issues were made by the Government and private
individuals, but they were not in an organised form, and as time
elapsed a number of foreign coins came into the country to provide
some kind of circulating currency, so that in 1800 the Governor of
the Colony at that time fixed values for a number of these coins in
the following manner :
£ s. d. £ s. d.
A guinea . . .120 A Spanish dollar .050
A Johannes . .400 A rupee . . .026
A half Johannes. .200 A shilling. . .011
A ducat . . .096 A copper coin of 1 oz. o o 2
A gold mohur , . 117 6 ~ „ £ „ o o 1
A pagoda . . .080 „ „ f „ o o o|
The Johannes was a Portuguese coin, the pagoda a Ceylon coin,
and the gold mohur an Indian coin, the country of origin of the rest
being well known, and the fact that so many different coins circulated
and were all valued much above their current value at home was a
clear indication that the demands for better currency conditions were
very great in Australia of that time.
Out of the inconveniences of such a system there sprang up a
movement to found a bank, and in November, 1816, a meeting of

some of the most important residents in the Colony was held, at
which it was determined to form a bank, and a certain amount of
share capital was subscribed. Following upon this decision the
following modestly worded advertisement appeared in the Sydney
Gazette of February 22, 1817 :
Bank of New South Wales. —Wanted for this establishment a suitable,
strong, well-built house, situate in or near George Street. Also two persons of
respectable character, who can give good security for their fidelity, to fill the
situation of cashier and principal accountant. It being intended to open the
bank on March 1 next ensuing, no time is to be lost in making tenders of
houses or services for the above purposes. Applications to be made to the
undersigned, the President of the Board of Directors. —J. T. Campbell.
As a matter of fact the branch opened for the despatch of business
on April 8, 1817, at Mrs. Mary Reiby’s house in Macquarie Place,
and to give some idea of the size of its business on July 15 following
the management procured a “ strong, secure chest ” for the deposit of
its cash and valuables, which were as follows:
The dollars were, of course, Spanish, which formed the virtual
currency of the Colony at the time, so much so that some of the
notes, and at least one of the balance-sheets of the bank, were drawn
in this denomination. The dumps again give the evidence of the
demand for currency in the Colony, for they represented the centre
punched out of the Spanish pillar dollar, thus making one coin serve
for two, the dump being valued at from 10 d. to is. 3d., and the rim,
or holey, dollar at From this small beginning the bank developed
rapidly in size and importance not without the trouble and anxieties
which attach to the early existence of the healthiest of financial infants.
By 1850, the balance-sheet approached a total of half-a-million, and
the necessity for opening offices in other Australian Colonies and
London, with a view to meet the competition of other banks that had
been brought into the field, caused the management in 1850 to

abandon the old system of co-partnery, and to form a new bank,
incorporated by Act of Council.
Under this new arrangement the Bank of New South Wales
started with a branch at North Brisbane, and agencies in London,
Adelaide, Hobart Town and Calcutta. Steady as its progress had
been before, the growth under its new constitution has been much
more rapid. Of course an institution which enters so deeply into the
affairs of the country in which it operates, as the premier Australian
bank does, was bound to feel the effects of conditions prevailing in
that country, and, in consequence, there were from time to time
fluctuations in its profits and business. But it was only a matter of
degrees in prosperity, or a difference between a dividend of 20 per
cent, and one of 9 per cent. Some idea of the expansion in the
business of the bank can be gathered from the table below, in which
the figures from 1851 to 1901 are set forth each five years, and yearly
.after that date ;
* Including other liabilities.

The effects of vicissitudes in Australian trade are reflected to
some extent in this table. The only instance during the period in
which the bank had to draw upon its visible reserves was in 1870-r.
the incidents of that time cutting down profits and the dividend
by 33 per cent., whilst ,£33,333 had to be taken from reserve to
provide for losses. The other important adverse influence was
the banking crisis in 1893, followed by eight years of prolonged
drought. The management faced this terrible ordeal in a most
effective manner. By issues of new shares the capital was
raised from £1,250,000 to £1,950,000, and drastic measures
were adopted in regard to all assets of a doubtful character. In
consequence of this policy the dividends were reduced from
per cent, to 9 per cent., and they stood at this lower level for six
years. But the bank came out immeasurably stronger from this
ordeal, and although dividends have only been raised to 10 per cent,
its profits have more than doubled since the drought period came to
an end about 1901. Like other important banks, the Bank of New
South Wales has found it judicious to use increased profits to
strengthen the institution rather than to raise the rate of dividend.
Larger allocations have been made to reserves and the capital has
been freely increased, and in this way the dividend has been retained
at 10 per cent. The longest period at which the dividend was main-
tained at one level was between 1875 and 1892, when a uniform rate
of ij\ per cent, was paid, but the prosperity of the last ten years has
been immeasurably greater than that period. In the twelve months
ended March 31, 1875, ne t profits amounted to £234,728, and in the
seventeen years which followed profits fluctuated between £178,809
and £241,072, finishing at £238,017 in 1891-2. During the last ten
years, profits started at £200,617 in 1900-1, and have risen steadily
each year since, so that they more than doubled in the time,
amounting to £406,020 for the last year dealt with.
Australia has had a wonderful spell of good fortune in the last
decade, and watchful observers are afraid that in one respect or
another some reaction may possibly be at hand. In one sense,
however, the position is very satisfactory, for banking at the
Antipodes was never in a sounder condition, and there is little
question that the Bank of New South Wales will be thoroughly
prepared for some contraction in prosperity should the seasons in
the future prove hardly so favourable. There could not be a better
man to meet emergency than the present General Manager,
Mr. J. Russell French. As chief inspector he was the right hand
of Mr. George Miller, who was General Manager throughout the
crisis of 1892-3. He succeeded Mr. Miller as General Manager in

July, 1894, and there is no question that the events of the few years
preceding had made a deep impression upon a mind, which primarily
had a tendency towards conservatism. His record since his appoint-
ment has been that of building up the resources of the institution he
controls. The last balance-sheet, made up to March 31, showed
that, with deposit and current accounts standing at £33,265,497 and
note circulation at £1,218,534, the liquid assets, consisting of coin,
Government notes, money at call in London, gilt-edged securities
and bills receivable in London, amounted to £21,395,065, or over
62 per cent, of the liabilities to the public. To pursue such a con-
servative policy is particularly difficult at a time when seasons are
unusually good, but the Hon. C. K. MacKellar, M.L.C., President
of the bank, and Mr. Russell French are not the men to be
influenced by mere considerations of the moment. In addition to
controlling the affairs of his bank, Mr. French takes an active part in
general banking matters. He was largely instrumental in founding
the Institute of Bankers in New South Wales and is at present its
President.
Although at the alteration of the constitution of the Bank of
New South Wales in 1850 an agency was opened in London, this
agency was in the office of a private firm, and it was not until 1853
that the bank opened an office of its own —in Cannon Street. It
remained there for thirteen years, and then removed to a new freehold
building at 64 Old Broad Street, which it kept over forty-five years,
until it made the change of a month ago. The premises, indeed,
became too small for its increased and continually expanding
business, and it secured a long lease in Threadneedle Street, where
the building portrayed in our illustrations has been erected at its own
expense. Its affairs are under the control of a London Board, of
which Sir R. Lucas Tooth is the present Chairman. The first
office was opened under the management of Mr. Donald Larnach
in 1853, and he held this office until 1879, when he was appointed
chairman of the London board of directors. Mr. Larnach was
succeeded by Mr. John Badcock in 1880, who retired in 1888.
To him succeeded the present manager, Mr. David George, who
is represented sitting at his desk in our illustration preceding
this page. Born at Wick in 1844, Mr. George entered the service
of the bank as a junior in 1862, and has held the successive
offices of accountant, secretary and manager, and will attain his
jubilee on January 24 next. His knowledge of City affairs is
exceptionally comprehensive, and there is no question that in this
way he is able to greatly assist the management in Australia as
to the course of events in London. Mr. Halkerstone Meldrum,
13


who is assistant manager, has been with the bank for a great number
of years.
The building at 29 Threadneedle Street, of which we give various
illustrations, was constructed by Messrs. Trollope & Sons and
Colls & Sons, Limited, under the plans of Mr. H. A. Felly, architect.
The exterior is of a severely plain character, but this arose from the
fact that the bank was compelled to subordinate its own plans to
those of the freeholders. Inside, a most convenient building has
been provided, and the utmost advantage has been taken of the site
which was unusually shallow for its eighty feet of length. Thanks
to the care taken in arranging matters, the light is unusually good as
it is obtained from two sides. The ground floor is devoted to the
ordinary operations of the bank, and has the advantage of an
exceptional amount of counter accommodation. The offices of the
management staff are well arranged, and, of course, all the latest
conveniences have been supplied. Lifts, fans, vacuum cleaners, and
tubes for the delivery of documents all form part of the design and
construction, and the banking hall may be considered as particularly
effective from the employment of two Italian marbles, Arne Alto
having been used in the upper part of the walls and Levanto for
pilasters and dadoes, whilst Aberdeen granite is employed for the
doorways and plinths.
Besides two basements, the bank also occupies the first floor,
letting off the two floors above. The chief room on the first floor is
the board room and manager’s room, which can be thrown into one.
Our illustration shows it in this form, and it is panelled in Australian
bean wood, which has the appearance of oak some 300 years old.
The effect produced by the decoration and arrangement is most
pleasing, and it forms one of the most prominent features in the
building.
As usual in a structure of this kind, the strong rooms form a very
important part of the new work. These have been constructed by
Messrs. Chubb & Sons, and practically fill the whole of the sub-
basement. The scheme of construction consists of a huge safe for
books, a strong room for valuables, and in the centre a treasury.
This latter, which measures 20 ft. long by 12 ft. high, is proof against
fire, water and air, and is so constructed that there is not a screw or
rivet in the whole work. Each section interlocks and thereby greater
strength is obtained. This method of construction has never been
attempted before, but it gives enormous resistance, and it is estimated
that the weight of the treasury chamber is at least 100 tons. An
important point to be borne in mind is that no keys are used. There
are two locks—time and combination —and it is claimed that the
14


door cannot be opened in any irregular fashion. There is nothing
intricate about either lock. Both are very simple, but the two must
work together or the safe cannot be opened. For instance, say the
time is set at 9.30 in the morning and the combination lock with
certain figures or letters, if the combination be moved the safe
cannot be opened before the time set, and if the time was known the
door would not open without the correct combination.
