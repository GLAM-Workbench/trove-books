EARLY HISTORY OF PRINTING IN AUSTRALIA.
The annals of official printing supply some of the most interesting chapters in the chronicles
of the early days of the State, as well as many remarkable incidents in the history of
the Press and of the development of printing in Australia; nor, is there any establish-
ment in New South Wales that better illustrates the industrial progress of the State than
the Government Printing Office. Commencing with the humblest possible beginnings,
the Office has grown into a large and well-equipped Department, in which printing in
its various phases—letter-press, lithographic, and photographic—are carried on, side by
side, under highly economic conditions. The Government Printing Office is usually the
first establishment in Australia to introduce improvements pertaining to the printing
trades, and several inventions have been originated or perfected in the Office. As a
consequence, the Department exercises a very beneficial influence on the progress of
printing and the manufacturing of books in this country.
The history of the Government Press commenced with the history of our colonisa-
tion. A small printing plant was brought to Australia by Governor Phillip in 1788, but
it was not till the arrival of Governor Hunter in 1795 that a suitable person could be
found to set up an office. In that year a creole of St. Christopher’s, in the West Indies,
named George Howe, who had lately arrived, was entrusted with the task of organising a
Press, and his success was speedy and complete.
Howe has been appropriately styled the “ Australian Caxton,” and it is evident,
from the battered appearance of the print, the poor quality of the ink, and the many
colours and sizes of paper used in the early Gazettes, that he w T as a man of many resources,
and capable of surmounting great difficulties.

Timperley, in his “ Encyclopaedia of Literary and I'vpograpliical Anecdote,"
referring to Howe and bis achievements, writes
Young as was the settlement of New South Wales when Howe arrived, and absorbed as were
its inhabitants in pursuits far different from those of literature, the spirit of his art was still brisk within
him, and to establish the Press upon these antipodean shores was the object of his constant ambition.
Fortunately for him and the Colony, that shrewd and active man, Governor King, who was at the head
of the Executive, 1800-1806, readily fell in with Mr. Howe’s wishes, foreseeing the salutary effects
which the Press, wisely conducted, could not fail to exert upon the crude elements of which the
population was composed.
To none was this poverty-stricken market a cause of greater embarrassment than to our worthy
Father of Types. His press, his letters, his ink, his paper and all the appurtenances thereunto belong-
ing, were ever and anon in woful need of being recruited But he had nothing but chance and his own
dexterous contrivances to trust to. Many an anecdote have we heard from his son and successor of the
predicaments and hair-breadth escapes that long chequered his career, and of the adroitness with which
he made the best of such up-and-down circumstances. He struggled bravely with them —and he
mastered them. For eighteen years he continued to tug at the oar, till the last enemy of our race
dismissed him from Iris toils. But the evils and casualties here enumerated were not the only annoy-
ances poor George Howe was exposed to. His paper, the idol of his heart and the support of him-
self and family, was subjected to an absolute censorship ; and the censors appointed by the Governor
seem to have exercised their authority with great rigour and harshness. Proof-sheets were sent back so
corrected that frequently the editor could scarcely recognise his own sentences, or detect a shadow'
of their original meaning. Paragraphs, essential to the proper understanding of the subjects he was
treating, were mercilessly erased ; and sometimes whole columns were annihilated at a blow. To the
end of his life he used to speak with horror, and often with tears rolling down his cheeks, of the
hardships he had endured in this way.
Howe, with the undisputed honour of being the primary editor of Australia, died
on the 11th of May, 1821, and was succeeded by his son Robert, who was unfortunately
drowned in the harbour on 29th January, 1829.
In November, 1795, Government Orders were first issued from the new Press ; and
mmediately afterwards was issued the first book published in Australia, entitled “ Acts
and Orders of Governor Hunter, 1795.'’ The Office, at first located in a room at
Government House, was much improved in its appointments daring the first eight years
of its existence, but it was used solely for printing Government notifications till the sth
of March, 1803. On that date Howe issued, under authority, the first number of the
Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser. This publication came out on Sundays,
except during the early months of its existence, when it issued on Saturdays. In the year
1825 it commenced to appear twice a week ; in 1827 it came out daily; afterwards it
came out three times a week; and in 1842, which was a year of great depression, it
died, along with several of its contemporaries. Howe’s salary for conducting the Gazette


was at first only £6O a year. Fortunately, we are able to give, in Governor King’s own
words, the reasons which prompted him to establish the first Australian newspaper. The
following passage occurs in a long official letter, dated 9th May, 1803, and addressed by
Governor King to Lord Hobart, then Secretary of State for the Home Department: —
It being desirable that the settlers and inhabitants at large should be benefited by useful
information being distributed among them, I considered that a weekly publication would greatly
facilitate that design, for which purpose I gave permission to an ingenious man who manages the
Government printing press to collect materials weekly, which, being inspected by an officer, are pub-
lished in the form of a weekly newspaper, copies of which, so far as they have been published, I have
the honour to enclose. And as the motive that has guided me in granting this indulgence to the
inhabitants has been for bettering their condition, I promise myself your Lordship’s approbation. To
the list of wants I have added a new fount of letters, which may be procured for eight or ten pounds,
sufficient for our purposes, if approved of.
The Sydney Gazette , as well as being the recognised official organ, was permitted to
be used as a private advertising medium, and was for many years the only vehicle for
communicating the news of the day to the colonists, and disseminating information
amongst them. It was, in fact, the first Australian newspaper. The articles and para-
graphs were as a rule written by trusted and subservient public officers, and edited at
Government House. This system was regarded by the people as a perversion of the
Press ; but they contrived to ventilate their grievances, nevertheless, by the use of what
was termed “pipes.” These “pipes” were rhymes which were taught by repetition or
by circulation in manuscript, and were very satirical in regard to officials and officialism.
Long after the newspapers were tolerated, the Sydney Gazette continued to be used as an
engine of attack and defence by the Government.
Tasmania had an official organ as early as 1810,* and other papers soon afterwards.
While the battle of the Press was being fought out on the mainland, a free Press had
struggled into existence on that island after encountering many difficulties, the greatest
of which was an attempt to crush it by Act of Parliament in 1827. The illiberal measure
passed with that object was, however, disallowed by Lord Goderich (the Marquis of Ripon).
The battle for the liberty of the Press was in the interim prosecuted with great ardour
in this State, but victory was not attained till 1823, when the Gazette was thrown open
for political discussion.
* Colonel Collins, the author of the “ History of New South Wales,” who was then the
Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, started a small journal, the Derwent Star, in February,
1810. It only survived a few weeks, as he died suddenly during the next month. It was only a 4to.
leaf. A second unsuccessful effort was made to start a newspaper, the Van Diemen’s Land Gazette,
in 1814. In June, 1816, Mr. A. Bent issued the pioneer paper, the Hobart Town Gazette
3


The formal emancipation of the Pres? took place on the 15th of October. 1524.
On that memorable day in the annals of Australian literature and freedom, Governor Sir
Thomas Brisbane, in response to a memorial from Mr. Howe, caused to be published in the
Sydney Gazette a notification, under the hand of the Colonial Secretary (Major Goulburn),
proclaiming the full liberty of the Press. Mr. VV. C. Wentworth had just previously
returned from England, accompanied by Dr. Warded. These eminent barristers and
patriots had brought with them materials for starting a newspaper, and they instantly
availed themselves of the freedom granted by issuing the Australian; in fact, they
anticipated by a day the great privilege conceded by the proclamation.
In 1826 Governor Sir Ralph Darling, whose administration had been unsparingly
assailed, and himself personally attacked, threatened to place the Press under official
surveillance once more ; and he would have succeeded in carrying out the repressive
measures contemplated by him on the occasion, were it not for the decisive action
of the Chief Justice of the day (Sir Francis Forbes), who thwarted the Governor in the
matter, and prevented him from giving effect to his threat. Once more, on the 27th
of February, 1828, Governor Darling menaced the Press with censorship, but the turmoil
in which he involved himself on the occasion ultimately led to his being recalled from
the Governorship. In the year 1826 Mr. E. S. Hall started the Monitor; in the next
year appeared the Gleaner; and on 18th April, 1831, the Sydney Herald (now the
Sydney Morning Herald).
Governor Darling was succeeded for a few months by Colonel Lindsay, C. 8., as
Acting-Governor, and on 3rd December, 1831, by Major-General Sir Richard Bourke,
K. 0.8., as Governor. The latter appointment proved to be a most auspicious event for
the Colony. Sir Richard displayed great firmness and tact in his administration, and
by adopting a conciliatory and statesmanlike policy, soon terminated the bitter dissensions
that had long prevailed between large sections of colonists. One of his first acts was
to sever his connection with the Sydney Gazette, and to withdraw his patronage from it,
which event the editor chronicled by apostrophizing his types and presses, after the style
of the “ Moor of Venice,” in these words :
“ And oh ! you mortal engines, whose rude forme
The Governor’s dread clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! Your master’s occupation’s gone.”
And not only was the occupation of the editor of the Gazette —as a hireling advocate—
truly gone, but the literary parasites of Government House, or rather of the Printing
4


Office, were at the same time ignominiously expelled, and the measures of the Governor
thenceforth committed for discussion to a free Press, by which they were dealt with
impax’tially and without fear of prosecution for libel. From that time forward the Press
has been perfectly untrammelled in Australia.
Robert Howe started Howe’s Weekly Commercial Express in 1825, but soon dis-
continued the publication, finding it impossible to maintain the issue of it and the Sydney
Gazette simultaneously. In 1832 The Currency Lass, a weekly devoted to Colonial
interests, and which proved to be short-lived, was published by Mr. Horatio Wills, in
partnership with the proprietor of the Sydney Gazette.
The Rev. Ralph Mansfield became editor and co-proprietor of the Sydney Gazette
after the death of young Howe in 1829, and continued in that capacity till 1832, when
the Sydney Gas Company having been established chiefly through his influence, he was
offered the position of Secretary to the Company, and accepted the appointment, which
he continued to hold till the time of his death in 1880. On Ist August, 1833, Mr
Mansfield commenced the publication of the New South Wales Magazine, and carried it
on for a time in conjunction with his non-literary employment.
In 1832 the Government established a Press over which they could exercise more
direct control than they had been able to do for some time over the Sydney Gazette.
Their new organ, the Government Gazette, was first issued on 7th March, 1832, under the
imprint of “ Ralph Mansfield.”
The old Sydney Gazette thenceforth came out as a newspaper, free alike from
Government surveillance and Government patronage, till it closed its existence on 23rd
December, 1812. During the era of its independence it had a chequered career, often
being subjected to violent attacks, and occasionally to legal consequences. After Mr.
Mansfield’s connection with it had ceased, it was conducted for periods more or less
brief by the following gentlemen, who figured very much in the history of that disturbed
period, viz., the Rev. H. Carmichael, and Messrs. O’Shaughnessy, Watt, and Cavenagh.*
From the early date of these events the Colonial Press has flourished with
Australian luxuriance, but it is unnecessary for the purpose of this compilation to pursue
the history of its stirring and brilliant career. Suffice it to say, the newspaper Press has

Wales,” and in Bonwick’s “ Early Struggles of the Australian Press.”

now acquired all the facilities possessed by the English Press for rapid and economical
printing—steam, gas, air, and hydraulic motive power—machines for printing from web
or sheet—stereotyping and electrotyping processes—the various means known to the trade
for producing illustrations—folding and sewing machines, die. In mercantile and artistic
printing the advance is not less remarkable—engraving, lithography, and chromography
being excellently represented. In photography nearly every process worth pursuing
has been cultivated with success. The photo-lithographic and photo-mechanical modes of
printing have been much encouraged and developed in this Department. They have been
found to be profitable and expeditious auxiliaries, and are certain to give large and
valuable results in the future.

THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.
INTRODUCTORY.
Governor Phillip brought out with him a small printing plant; but it was not till 1840
that the Government Printing Office was established as a Department devoted exclusively
to the performance of Government work.
lo Governor Gipps belongs the credit of recognising the advantages to be gained by
the establishment of a Government Printing Office. On the 21st November, 1840, he
caused a notice to be published in the Government Gazette announcing that, in view of
arrangements being in progress for effecting all printing for the Colonial Service by means
of a Government establishment, tenders for printing, which had been called for in the
preceding September would not be required. The determination to establish a Government
Printing Office must therefore have been arrived at sometime between September and
November, 1840. On tne 14th January, 1841, he wrote to Lord John Russell as follows:
My Lord,
In numerous despatches I have had occasion to mention incidentally to your Lordship the
great difficulty which during the last three years has been experienced in getting printer’s work
performed by this Government.
I have now to report to your Lordship that an opportunity having offered of establishing a
Government Printing Press, I have gladly availed myself of it.
I transmit herewith a memorandum on the subject, drawn up by the Colonial Secretary, which
will, I trust, fully vindicate the propriety of the step which I have adopted.
The salaries which are to be given to the persons employed are stated in this memorandum.
The memorandum of the Colonial Secretary (Mr. Deas-Thomson) states: —
At present, from the quantity of work required, no one Printing Office is capable of perfonniug
the whole within a reasonable time in any satisfactory way ; and it is therefore necessary to divide it
7


.unnngot two or more- of them The (tereentra< r,t i.'nzefte, notwithstanding every exertion, frequently
does not appear until a week after the proper day of publication. The Council has been often kept
sitting for a considerable period waiting for the printing of Bills and other papers, and the general
business of the Government has been retarded from the want of proper forms. In fact, although
bound in the usual way with sureties, the contiactors, through the absence of competitors, do not feel
themselves obliged to fulfil their engagements, and it is found impossible to compel them. It is,
therefore, proposed, as the most effective remedy for these several inconveniences, as well as to provide
the means of performing the additional work which any modification of the Legislative Council may
render necessary, to establish a Printing Office under the exclusive orders and control of the
Government.
The pay-sheet was not to be a heavy one. A practical printer “who had been for
some time conducting the largest printing establishment in Sydney,” was to receive £3OO
per annum,t and have two free men as assistants, one at £2OO the other at £l5O per
annum. The remainder of the work was to be done by convicts. New materials were to
cost £400; types, ifec., £1,400; salaries, £650; rations, £465 ss. (for twenty), and over-
time, £2OO. Tt was estimated that fully £SOO would be received for advertisements, &c.,
from the outside public. The Colonial Secretary confidently hoped that “ independently
of any consideration of expenses, the advantages derived from the economy of time and
the accuracy and despatch of public business, will be such as to fully justify the measure,
and render evident its utility and importance.”
Operations were commenced in a small row of wooden buildings previously used as
an Immigration Depot, situated on the site of the present Office. In 1849 the Office was
removed to larger premises—those at present used as a District Court at Hyde Park—
and, more space being soon required, new buildings were erected on the present site, and
occupied on the 26th April, 1856.
* Mr. James Tegg had at that time the contract for printing the Council papers ; and the
Governmenl Gazette was printed by the proprietors of the Sydney Herald (now the Sydney Morning
Herald).
