? Such being the case, you may understand that there can he no incon-
venience in vessels of any tonnage approaching and casting anchor on the
bank situated on the east of Mikro Kaimene, in the harbour of Santorin.
This lies at a distance of about 1200 metres from the nearest point of eruption.
There has never been at this distance any danger whatever to fear, even when
the accidents occurred near Neo Kaimene of which I have just spoken. I may
add, that the depth and extent of this bank have not at all varied, neither has
there been any alteration in the level of the ground at Mikro Kaimene, Paleo
Kaimene, or in the whole northern part of Neo Kaimene. There is, therefore,
no danger whatever to fear for the trading-vessels which resort to Santorin.
As to the inhabitants of Santorin, their terrors are purely imaginary, their
island has survived the grand catastrophe which produced the harbour between
Santorin, Therasia, and Aspronisi, they may therefore reckon on its stability.
Moreover, their island forms what has been called a ? cone of elevation; ? the
Kaimenes, on the contrary, are what are called cones of eruption. Now all the
conclusions of geological science tend to show that cones of elevation are, so
to speak, invariable, whilst cones of eruption are liable to change in form
and magnitude at each new eruption. The Kaimenes might, therefore,
rise or sink, become larger or smaller, without the island of Santorin under-
going any change.
?In conclusion, I wish to say a word on another point. Are the emanations
from the volcano likely to have any effect on the health of the inhabitants
of Santorin? Will they affect the vegetation, and may they not injure
the development of the vines on the island ? It is impossible for me at the
present moment to give a definite answer to these questions, which are the
special study of one of my colleagues, M. de Coregna. But if I may judge
by what occurs at Vesuvius, Etna, and Stromboli, whose slopes are thickly
peopled and covered with vineyards, I should say that these emanations seem
to have but a very feeble action on the health of men and plants; indeed,
I should not be surprised to see the vine malady disappear from Santorin
under the influence of the sulphurous emanations of the volcano.
? I may add, that all the opinions that I have here ventured to state, are
shared in by the learned geologist, M. de Verneuil, who has accompanied me,
and who has had the kindness to aid me in my work on the eruption of Neo
Kaimene.?
3. Notes on the Country at the head of the Gulf of Cai'pentaria. By
E. W. Lamb, Esq. Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands.
(Communicated by the Governor of Queensland, through the Colonial Office.)
The following paper was written in answer to a request from Sir Roderick
Murchison to the Governor of Queonland, for detailed information respecting
the progress of settlement in Northern Queensland, especially with reference
to the possibility of depasturing sheep with profit so far within the tropics.
? Brisbane, January, 1866.
? It seems like a marvel, as we look back for a few short years and review the
position of the territory now forming the colony of Queensland and compare it
with its present state. A large portion was unknown, the small belts of
country that surrounded the tracks of some of the intrepid Australian explorers
on the maps of the continent gave little indication of the future suitability of
the north for stock, beyond surmise which promised years for its realisation.
Leichhardt could scarcely have conceived the changes that have followed his

footsteps. Little did that brave and hopeful man think that the shores of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, which were no doubt associated in his mind with days of
peril and painful labour, would in so short a time resound with the bleating
of flocks and the lowing of herds, that townships and homesteads would spring
up on the banks of rivers, where the primeval silence and solitude was three
years ago broken only by a few wandering tribes of aborigines seeking a meagre
subsistence along their course.
? In the year 1861, there was, in that portion of the colony lying north of the
24th parallel of south latitude, the following amount of stock :
A year has now elapsed since this computation was made ; so that, allowing for
the annual increase and large quantity of sheep and cattle which have been
driven into the Gulf coirntry during that period, by intending settlers, who in
accordance with the Pastoral Laws of Queensland are obliged to stock the
country before they are in a position to apply for it?and as 4973 square miles
have been taken up in that way, and as the lowest amount of stock required
to hold the country so acquired would amount to 124,325 sheep, it will not
be an extravagant estimate to assign an increase of 50 per cent, on the numbers
computed in 1864, as representing the amount of stock now (in January,
1866), existing in Northern Queensland.
? As to the pastoral district of Burke, to which this paper more immediately
refers, I do not believe I am in excess (having as yet only imperfect returns to
guide me) in computing the amount of stock therein, in the middle of 1865, as
being fully equal to 71,000 sheep and 8000 head of cattle. This is but a com-
paratively small number when the large extent of territory is taken into con-
sideration ; but their capacity for increase is far beyond that of ordinary
flocks, in consequence of their being mainly composed of ewes. It may,
therefore, be fairly presumed, that in May of the present year (1866), there
will be fully 110,000 sheep, and 12,000 head of horned cattle in the district
referred to.
? The district of Burke embraces the entire area of that portion of the Gulf
country in the colony of Queensland which is watered by the rivers Albert,
Leichhardt, Norman, and Flinders, and comprises the very best country in
the extreme northern portion of the territory. It has been officially described
as follows in the Queensland ? Government Gazette ?:?
? ? The lands commencing on the sea-coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria, at
Point Fitz Maurice, and bounded thence on the north by a lino bearing east to
the south-western watershed of the Gilbert River; thence by the range
forming said watershed, in a south-easterly direction to the range separating
the waters flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria from other waters; on the east
by aforesaid range, which is also the western watershed of the Burdekin River,
in a southerly direction to the range forming the southern watershed of the
Flinders River and its tributaries; thence on the south by said range in a
westerly direction to a point where it is intersected by the 21st parallel of south
latitude ; thence again on the south by said parallel to the 138� of east longi-
tude, being a portion of the western boundary of the colony of Queensland ;
thence on the west by said meridian of longitude northerly to the sea-coast in
the Gulf of Carpentaria; and thence by the shore of said gulf, in an easterly


and northerly direction to Point Fitz Maurice aforesaid, and including the
islands adjacent thereto.?
? The general character of the country in the pastoral district of Burke, is
such as to render it eminently adapted for stock of all sorts. It consists, for
the most part, of extensive hlack-soil plains and open downs, producing grasses
of the best description, amongst which the well-known ? blue ? and ? barley ?
grasses largely abound. The land, for the most part, is elevated, ranging
from 1600 at the heads of the rivers, to about 400 to 500 feet above the sea,
at a distance of a few miles from the shore. This extended elevation will have
the effect of making the climate more extreme than is found on the coast.
But this, in itself, will be an advantage, as being more suitable to the consti-
tution of the sheep than the equitable temperature existing along the sea-shore.
(I shall allude to this point at a future stage.) In addition to the grasses,
there is a variety of herbs on which stock are found to thrive exceedingly;
amongst which may be enumerated ? salt-bush,? ? native leeks,? ? wild
cucumber,? and ? carrots,? owing to the abundance of superior feed and the
presumed freedom from drought (which is not generally experienced north of
the 19 th or 20th parallel of south latitude). I believe sheep will attain con-
siderable size and weight; hut this result will, of course, much depend on
proper management and due attention in the selection of flocks for breeding.
Whilst the present system prevails, of guarding sheep at night, having a
shepherd to follow them by day, no marked improvement is likely to he pro-
duced for some time to come ?particularly as the necessary erections on a run
to enable a less artificial system to he pursued require as a rule more capital
than the present squatters are in a position to expend, owing principally to the
high price of labour in the remote and partially settled districts of the colony.
Under the existing system of managing sheep in Northern Queensland, I do
not consider that a greater yield of wool than 2 lbs, per sheep can he expected
in the Gulf country, though I feel confident that as soon as fencing in the
Buns is generally resorted to, in accordance with the common practice now
adopted in Tasmania, Victoria, and portions of New South Wales, that a clip
of 2f lbs. and upwards might reasonably he looked for ; assuming of course that
due attention is paid to the introduction of fresh blood at successive periods by
procuring from the South and its colder pasturages suitable rams for the
purpose. The principal advantage the sheep-farmer will derive in fencing his
run into several inclosures and allowing the sheep to roam at will, will he
the superior quality of the wool grown on the sheep, the larger number of
sheep the land will be capable of depasturing, and also in affording them the
most favourable conditions for lambing; when so much difficulty is usually
experienced in providing green feed for the sheep, whilst the lambs are too
young to move far. This will he readily understood when it is pointed out
that the overcrowding of a large number of sheep into a fold in a warm and
perhaps moist climate, must produce an injurious effect ultimately on the
sheep, which exhibits itself in the lightness of the wool grown, and also in time
on the general constitution; though this latter consequence does not appear so
certain. The early morning and the cool of the evening?the very best time
for allowing the sheep to feed ?is lost to them; they arc brought out in a
feverish state, in broad sunlight, to graze and make the most of their time
during hours when, under a more natural system, they would he found seeking
shade and repose.
? The climate of the district of Burke is usually described as being similar to
that of the Kennedy District, which embraces almost the same parallels of
latitude, but fronts on the eastern 'seaboard. Fortunately, the published
record of one year?s observations taken at Port Denison, at the residence of
J. G. McDonald, Esq., who was one -of the first to drive stock to the banks
of the Albert and Gregory rivers, affords a means of instituting a comparison


with information derived from other sources. Appended is an abstract of the
mean temperatures for each month, computed by the Government Astronomer
of New South Wales. By this table it will he seen that the annual mean
temperature is 74� 9' in latitude 20� s.; hut at Port Denison the range of
temperature is extremely slight, as is usually the case in tropical climates near
the coast. In the interior, from inquiries I have made and the allusions made
by Leichhardt in his journal of the overland expedition to Port Essington, the
nights are invariably cool; but the heat during mid-day is perhaps slightly in
excess of that experienced on the coast. Putting these facts together, there is
every reason to believe that the mean annual temperature would remain very
much the same in the higher lands of the Gulf country as at Port Denison
(f. e. 74� Fahrenheit); but that there would be an excess of daily range of
temperature in the former over the latter district.
? This climatic condition is unquestionably favourable to sheep-farming, and,
combined with the rich pasturage with which the Gulf country abounds,
ought to produce sheep of large carcase.
? This is a point of great moment to the grazier who is quite alive to the high
prices which fat wethers bring at Calcutta, viz., 30s. a head, as I have learnt
from good authority. Sheep might be shipped at the head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, by screw-steamer, for Calcutta ?a distance of some 3500 miles;
taking advantage of the intermediate markets (if found desirable) of Batavia
and Singapore. Or, even in seasons of drought, such as the southern colonies
have lately experienced, a ready market could be found by driving stock across
to Eockingham Bay, Cleveland Bay, or Port Denison, and thence shipping to
Sydney or Melbourne. Large quantities of stock are now being shipped at
Gladstone (Port Curtis) for the southern markets.
? I know of no district in this colony where so much first-class pastoral
country exists. From the headwaters of the principal rivers to within a few
miles of the coast, the rich plains before alluded to extend without break.
When fully occupied, the district will be capable of depasturing three or four
millions of sheep, and at least 200,000 horned cattle and horses ; and, when
fencing is introduced, 50 per cent, additional upon that estimate. The present
population in the district is not easily determined, as the stations are somewhat
scattered; but in the neighbourhood of the site of the proclaimed township
reserve of Burketown on the Albert River, there are already at least one
hundred persons, most of whom are male adults, and who intend, for the most
part, to bring their families to the district so soon as the township allotments
are marked off, and they can erect their dwellings on their own property. As,
however, there is a steady increase maintained by the introduction of labour
by the settlers generally, and also by the inducement which high wages hold
out, I fully expect to see in the course of the next three or four months a
population of 300 souls located at the township, destined, no doubt, to be the
founders of a great city and mart of commerce. Already many large stores
and public houses are being erected by men of capital anxious to be the first in
the field to reap so promising a harvest.
? The Government of Queensland have already despatched the well-known
explorer Mr. Landsborough, to be the police magistrate of the Burke district.
A surveyor and his staff have also started to survey Burketown and other
suitable townships. A detachment of native police, under the command of an
experienced officer, together with other officers, for the purpose of opening up
the port, are also en route. On the Ist of April next, a monthly overland
mail will be established between Brisbane and Burketown ; doubtless in a few
months to be followed by a fortnightly contract. And further, I would add,
that the electric telegraph will in a very short time be completed, as far as
Bowen (Port Denison), and thence pushed on to Cardwell (Rockingham Bay),
and from thence a distance of 360 miles to Burketown, the inhabitants of


which may, therefore, ere very long, reasonably expect
Queensland to receive the English news through the
telegraph-wire.

4. On vast Losses of Land on the Westerly Coasts of France within the
historical period. By E. A. Peacock, Esq,, Jersey.
Mr. Peacock has forwarded a memoir to the Society, giving an account of his
researches in the various ancient records of great losses of land by inroads of
the sea in the Channel Islands, and on the opposite coast of France. He has
ailived at the conclusion that these phenomena are due to successive sinkings
of the land which have taken place between the middle of the second and the
middle of the fifteenth centuries. The following extracts from the memoir
contain some of the principal facts which he has accumulated:?
Losses of Land in St. Oueris Bay, Jersey. ?An ancient MS. is alleged to state
that, in the year 1357, the sea engulfed a very rich district of land in? the parish
of St. Ouen, and that the registers of the Exchequer make mention of a people
who inhabited this portion of land. The little islet where Elizabeth Castle
stands was detatched from terra firma about the year 687. The following
is from a local paper, ? Gazette de I?lle de Jersey,? 28th April, 1787 : ? The
trunks and roots of trees which showed themselves last winter by the agitation
of the sea in St. Ouen?s Bay, and whjch are still visible, furnish iis with
a subject of contemplation relating to times very remote. One sees thousands
of trees laid one close to another in this bay, from the Corbihre to the two
banks of sand at some miles from high* water.? These banks? Shoal
