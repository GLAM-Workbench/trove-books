FINED FOR
ASSAULT
Two Former
Policemen
Two former police con-
stables, Mervyn Albert Vance,
31, and Robert Alexander
Waller, 26, were each fined
£5 in Central Court yester-
day, for assaulting a news-
paper seller.
They were charged with as-
saulting Frederick Bevan Box,
24, a newspaper seller, of Dar-
lington Road, Darlington.
After four witnesses gave evi-
dence yesterday, Mr. J. Thom,
for the accused, was granted per-
mission to alter their pleas to
guilty.
Convicting Vance and Waller,
Mr. H. Hawkins, S.M., said it
would be inappropriate for him
to consider gaol punishment,
having regard to the nature and
circumstances of the assault.
Frederick George Goodwin, of
Addison Road, Manly, said that
at about 6 p.m. on August 12 he
saw two policemen hitting and
pummelling Box in a tram shed in
City Road.
Later he identified the police-
men as Vance and Waller.
DENIAL
Acting-Inspector W. A, L.
Crimsfon, of Kogarah, said he
saw Waller in uniform at the
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
casualty ward with Box. Waller
had denied being concerned in
the assault.
Addressing Mr. Hawkins, Mr.
Thom said the two accused had
previously given good service in
the police force, but had sud-
denly lost their sense of balance.
Mr. Thom said Vance and
Waller had been prejudged, pil-
loried, and villified by the Press.
He asked Mr. Hawkins to dis-
charge Vance and Waller under
Section 556 A of the Crimes Act.
Mr. Hawkins said; “The police
force of this State is the body
which actively protects the lives,
the welfare and the property of
the citizens.
“I believe that the police force
is full of men of high honour,
courage, and ability.
“At the same time the police
force is in a position of trust,
and, hard as it may be, any mem-
ber of the force that violates that
trust has to put up with the conse-
quences.
“SOME JUSTIFICATION”
“I cannot look lightly on an
assault by police on a citizen,
even though there was, as I be-
lieve there was in this case, some
justification for annoyance on the
part of the police.
“I have no doubt that the
assault committed on Box was
not of a serious nature. The
medical evidence showed that the
physical injuries found on Box
were slight and should not cause
him discomfort for more than
about 48 hours.”
Mr. Hawkins said maximum
fine for this offence was £lO.
He ordered Vance and Waller
to pay £7 compensation to Box
and £4/18/ witnesses’ expenses.
386,269 lb Of
Tobacco
Was Exported
CANBERRA, Tuesday.—
Australia exported 386,2691 b
of unmanufactured tobacco in
the 1948-49 season.
Only 481 b was exported in
the previous season.
The Commonwealth Statis-
tician, Dr. Roland Wilson, re-
vealed this to-day in a summary
of crop statistics.
Australian tobacco production
for the 1948-49 season was
3,566,0001 b— 1,082,0001 b more
than last season’s production.
The area under cultivation for
tobacco was the smallest for
many years, but the yield per acre
rose from 646.401 b last season
to 965.091 b this season.
imports for the two seasons
were: 1948-49, 23,545,4221 b;
1947- 30,951,4001 b.
Most of this year’s tobacco
came from east coast States, the
summary shows.
Cotton production for the
1948- season was the lowest
for many years.
SYDNEY WOOL SALES
At the wool sales in Sydney
yesterday, 12,665 bales were
catalogued.
At auction. 12,594 bales were sold
and the total clearance, including
private sales of passed-in and fell-
mongered wools was 12,715 bales.
The Sydney Wool Selling Brokers
report: '
"Under excellent competition
from practically all sections, the
market reflected all the best feat-
ures of the previous day’s auctions,
and values ruled fully firm at the
improved levels then established.
.Very full and satisfactory clearances
were effected. Greasy merino

The Country Producers’ Selling Co.
Ltd. offered an attractive catalogue of
wools chiefly representative of the
north-western, central western, and west-
ern areas of the State. A proportion
of the selection was drawn from the
Boorowa. Yass, Bvaidwood. Bathurst, and
Cootamundra districts. The wools from
the former areas opened up in good
order, displaying good length and quality,
but carried dust in the tip and burr on
the skirts in varying degrees, whilst the
clips from the latter districts showed
good length and style, fine to superfine
quality, and practically free from any
vegetable fault. The top price of 113 d
was obtained for 5 sup AAA of RA

Tributes To Work Of
Late Chief Justice
There was a vacant chair on the bench of the
Banco Court yesterday—the one occupied by the
late Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Jordan—when State
judges, members of the Bar, and solicitors gathered
to pay tribute to him.
The judges of the
Supreme Court in their
scarlet robes, and senior
counsel heavily bewigged
made an impressive scene
as the Senior Puisne
Judge, Mr. Justice Street,
delivered a panegyric.
Sir Frederick died suddenly
last Friday evening.
Mr. Justice Street said; “Mem-
bers of the Courts, the profession,
and the community at large have
suffered a grievous loss.
“Sir Frederick Jordan proved
himself to be a faithful custodian
of those great traditions of which
he was the inheritor and the path
of duty was the only path he
knew.
“For nearly 16 years he had
presided as the head of the Court
and the record of his work is
embodied in those judgments
which he now leaves to posterity.
“The unrivalled store of his
knowledge covered all fields and

GOOD VALUES IN
MELBOURNE
MELBOURNE, Tuesday. —A .
strong market ruled for most de- !
scriptions of wools at the second
day of the fourth series of the 1949- 1
50 Melbourne wool sales to-day. 1
Continued Russian demand for
super-styled comebacks brought ;
fully firm rates, but good to average ]
comebacks were a shade irregular.
Merinos and crossbreds fully
held yesterday’s rates, which were
slightly easier than the higher rates
ruling in Melbourne a fortnight
ago.
Lambs, locks, and crutchings
: were eagerly sought at recent dear
prices. j
Brokers said that, although some ,
variations had been noted in this <
i week’s market, the general trend j
; was still sound and good values i
! were being realised.
Top merino prices were and i

the most complex legal problems
presented no difficulty to him.
"He used judgments of other
men as material from which he
formed his own, but in the end
it was his own independent judg-
men! which determined the ques-
tion in issue, and, when once de- '
termined—like Sir George Jessel,
famous Master of the Rolls—
he never doubted.
“The late Chief Justice did not i
wear his heart on his sleeve,”
Mr. Justice Street added, “but be- i
neath the outward form he was
intensely human.”
The Attorney-General, Mr. C. '
E. Martin, spoke on behalf of
the Bar, and the president of the
Incorporated Law Institute, Mr. i
G. A. Yuill, on behalf of solici-
tors. I
The entire Bench of the In- '
dustrial Commission attended the |
funeral service for the late Chief ■,
Justice on Monday. ,
Members of the Legislative 1
Council observed a minute’s
silence yesterday afternoon in
memory of Sir Frederick.
The Minister of Justice, Mr.
R. R. Downing, moved that the
Council express its sympathy to
Lady Jordan. J
He was supported by the

INFLATION
SPIRAL
Warning Given
The annual conference of
the Australian Newspaper Pro-
prietors’ Association was
opened in “The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” office yesterday
morning under the chairman-
ship of the president, Mr. Eric
Kennedy. i
Mr. Kennedy, in opening the
conference, referred to the effects ’
of devaluation on the national
economy. They had believed 1
when devaluation was announced,
he said, that the intention was to 1
endeavour to improve trade I
facilities by reducing prices. The 1
experience of the newspapers, '
however, had been of sharply 1
rising costs. I
The cost of newsprint and ol .
bringing news into Australia was ,
increasing, and there were indica-
tions that Australia, as a whole,
was about to undergo a serious *
inflationary spiral. This might ]
be expected to result in the next
few months in sharper increases '
in basic wage adjustments.
The inflationary effects of de- !
valuation policy were seen clearly
in the newspaper industry, where
costs of supplies and services of
all kinds, whether from dollar or
from sterling areas, were increas-
ing rapidly.
“NEW PROBLEMS”
Earlier they had looked to a
situation where newsprint sup-
plies at a reasonable price could
be assured, and there would be
a stabilised wage structure, Mr.
Kennedy said. That expectation
had become a thing of the past,
and they faced the coming year
with new and urgent problems
before them.
Mr. Kennedy was re-elected
president for the coming year.
The conference passed a
resolution of condolence at the
recent sudden death of Sir Errol
G. Knox, joint managing director
of Argus and Australasian Ltd.
Those present were:
Sydney: John Fairfax & Sons Pty. Ltd.,
Messrs. R. A. Henderson, V. C. Fairfax,
A. H. McLachlan, and John Hughes;
Associated Newspapers Ltd., Messrs.
Eric Kennedy and R. Doutreband.

INCIDENT IN
BEDROOM
Story In “Rock”
Libel Case
George Otto Wegner gave
evidence yesterday against his
brother, William Walter
Campbell, in the Supreme
Court action which Campbell
has brought against the regis-
tered proprietors of “The
Rock” newspaper for alleged
libel.
It was the third day of the
hearing and counsel intimated
that the case would not finish
before the end of the week.
Campbell is claiming heavy
damages following an article pub-
lished in “The Rock” on February
12 last year.
The article stated that he had
been dismissed from his position as
general manager for gross miscon-
duct.
Campbell is claiming that the
article meant that he was guilty of
immoral conduct and that he was
a hypocrite.
The defendants, John William
Wallace Campbell, George Otto
Wegner, Thomas Alfred Boyd, Hugh
Cecil Boyd, and William Charles
Biddle, have pleaded not guilty,
truth and public benefit.
CHANGED NAME
Wegner, in evidence, said his
mother married again after the death
of his father while Campbell was
still an infant. Campbell took the
name of his stepfather, but he later
changed his name by deed poll.
In February, 1946, he said, he
and his wife visited the premises of
“The Rock” about 7 o’clock at
night and found Campbell and a
girl named Eva in Campbell’s bed-
room. The girl was partly un-
dressed, and Campbell was in his
pyjamas. The girl was kissing
Campbell.
He told Campbell he did not ap-
pear to be very sick, and he replied,
“She was only keeping me com-
pany.” The girl got up from the
bed and left the room.
Witness said there were other
occasions when he spoke to his
brother about misconducting him-
self. Campbell said he would go
away to another State.
Replying to Mr. W. I. D. Ward
(for plaintiff), Wegner said that in
February, 1946, Campbell was not
so ill that he feared for his life.
He was, however, concerned about
his health from a brother’s point
of view.
A meeting of “The Rock” suppor-
ters had been called, witness said,
and Campbell suggested that he be
carried out on his bed to address
the meeting.
“It would look better that way,”
Campbell said, according to witness.
PARTLY SHAM
Mr. Ward: It was a mere sham?
—Yes, partly so.
He was acting?—For the purpose
of that meeting, yes. He had been
up out of bed that afternoon.
Did he ever complain to you
about your other partners being
seen in the local hotel? —Not to my
knowledge.
Witness denied that when plain-
tiff returned to “The Rock” in Feb-
ruary, 1948, he was bodily thrown
down the stairs.
He and his partners showed
police documents that he and his
colleagues were the registered own-
ers of the paper. The police then
said it was a private fight and went
away.
The hearing was adjourned until
this morning.
