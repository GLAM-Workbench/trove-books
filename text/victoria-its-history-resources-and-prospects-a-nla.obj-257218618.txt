Its History, Resources and

CHAPTER I.
Early History of Victoria.
«■ j y* DETAILED account of early discoveries by
f"~j Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch navigators on
the Australian coasts, north, east and west of
the territory, which now constitutes Victoria, will' be
studied with the deepest interest by all who desire to
master the general history of “ the Great South Land;”
but we are exclusively concerned, in the present sketch,
with the particular colony in which the Centennial Inter-
national Exhibition of 1888 is held, and which is attract-
ing visitors at this moment not only from all parts
of Australia, but from many countries in the northern
hemisphere.
It is universally admitted that the seaboard of Victoria
was first observed by Captain Cook at Point Hicks, now
called Cape Everard, in Gippsland, situated between Cape
Howe and Snowy River, when he was on his way up from
Hew Zealand to examine the coast-line of the mysterious
continent.


It was on the morning of the 19th April, 1770, that
Cook’s first lieutenant sighted the promontory just men-
tioned, which continues to hear the name of the discoverer.
Gabo Island and Cape Howe were seen by Cook himself
on the same day. But more than a quarter of a century
was allowed to elapse before further examination was
made of the southern trend of Australia, which was still
supposed to extend to the forty-third parallel of latitude.
The first Europeans who touched the soil of Victoria were
Clarke, the supercargo, and the crew of the Sydney Cove,
wrecked early in 1797, south of Cape Howe. On the
4th January, 1798, the Western Port inlet was entered by
the intrepid Bass, who was accompanied by Matthew
Flinders, then only a midshipman. The stay of Bass in
that locality, however, was not prolonged beyond thirteen
days, when circumstances obliged him to retrace his steps
to Port Jackson, and he departed under the impression
that the southern portion of Australia was connected with
Van Diemen’s Land, and that the passage now known as
Bass’ Straits was only a deep bight.
To Lieutenant Grant, of the brig Lady Nelson, belongs
the honour of having defined the entire coast-line of Vic-
toria for the first time, from Cape Bridgewater to Cape
Schanck, in the year 1800. From this gallant adventurer
Capes Northumberland, Bridgewater, Nelson, Solicitor,
Sir W. Grant and Otway, with Mounts Schanck and
Gambier, Laurence Eoad, and Lady Julia Percy Island,
received the nomenclature by which they are still known.
Portland Bay he called after the famous duke of Dutch
descent, then one of the Secretaries of State. In the
following year he surveyed the shores of Victoria from
Wilson’s Promontory to Western Port. Churchill’s
Island, in Western Port Bay, was visited by him, and
Nicholson's Ear Drums Cure Deafness.


on that spot he was reduced to the necessity of cultivating
a garden with a coal-shovel, in the absence of any more
convenient implement. It would appear that he formed
a decidedly more accurate opinion of the region in ques-
tion than some of the authorities at Sydney, and other
officials, subsequently did, for he compared the beauty of
the scenery to Devonshire and the Isle of Wight,
Grant, returning to England, was succeeded in the com-
mand of the Lady Nelson by Lieutenant John Murray, who
reaped the first Victorian grain-crop from the seed which
had been sown by his predecessor. On the sth January,
1802, that gallant commander left Western Port with the
intention of exploring the coast trending in a north-
westerly direction, but was beaten back by adverse winds.
Baffled in his attempt to enter what looked like an inlet,
he despatched his first mate with five seamen to examine
the place, and thus was brought to the knowledge of the
world the existence of Port Phillip Bay, which is destined
to play so momentous a part in the future triumphs of
commerce and civilisation in the Southern Pacific. The
launch containing the exploring party rounded the pro-
montory familiar to us as Point Nepean, that designation
being applied to it by the first officer of the Lady Nelson
on the occasion referred to. On the Ist February the
“ Rip” was safely passed through, when the great inland
sea expanded to the wondering gaze of the visitors. On
the fourth of the same month they returned to their
vessel to report what they had seen, and, eleven days
afterwards, the Lady Nelson sailed through the Heads.
Traces of the natives were visible in the numerous huts
standing near the portion of the bay where Lieutenant
Murray landed, and in the charred appearance of some
hundreds of acres which had apparently been cleared by
J. H. Nicholson, 65 'William Street, Melbourne.


fire. Murray was as much struck with the pleasant
aspect of the landscape as Grant had been with the Vic-
torian coast-line oft Gippsland. He describes the bay as
a “ noble harbour,” and compares the scenery to that of
Greenwich Park and Blackheath, “ the hills and valleys
rising and falling with inexpressible elegance.” A con-
spicuous height on the eastern shore he designated
u Arthur’s Seat,” from its likeness to the celebrated
hill of that name overlooking the Scotch capital. The
treacherous greeting given to the newcomers by the
blacks came very near costing them their lives, and it
became necessary, in self-defence, to give the aborigines
a practical illustration of the power of the strange tubes
pointing through the port-holes of the brig to vomit forth
fire and destructive shot.
On the 9th of March, Murray took possession of the
bay and its surroundings in the King’s name, hoisting his
emblematic bunting on Point Patterson, and firing rounds
of small arms and artillery in honour of the occasion. On
the 12th the vessel got back through the “ Eip” on an
«bb tide, and steered direct for Port Jackson.
The fate of the Lady Nelson forms a melancholy sequel
to this narrative of the first visit of white men to the
inlet at the head of which Victoria’s capital was founded
thirty-three years afterwards. In 1825, while engaged on
a trading expedition in Torres Straits, she was seized by
Malays, and it is believed that her crew was massacred;
at least she was never heard of again.
Matthew Flinders, who has already been alluded to in
his capacity as midshipman on board the vessel which had
conveyed Dr. Bass to the South Pacific, entered Port
Phillip Bay the very month after Murray quitted it. As
no opportunity had occurred for communication between
Nicholson’s Ear Drums Cure Deafness.


the two commanders, they were entirely ignorant of being
in such close proximity to each other. Flinders sailed
from Spithead in July, 1801, in command of the sloop-of-
war Investigator, under instructions to make a complete
survey of the Australian coast. Sir John Franklin, after-
wards Governor of Tasmania, and still more distinguished
as an Arctic explorer, served under Flinders as midship-
man on the voyage referred to. Skirting t>he south-west
coast of Victoria from Cape Bridgewater to Cape Otway,
Flinders passed through the Heads into Port Phillip on
27th April, 1802, under the notion that he was in Western
Port. He was soon undeceived, however, by the spectacle
of a sheet of water so vast that its northern boundaries
were far too remote to be noticeable, even from a hill
which he ascended for the purpose of endeavouring to
observe them. From You Yangs mountain, on the
western side of the bay, he saw the plains of the interior,
and caught a glimpse of those hills around the present
Ballarat, which, 48 years later, yielded auriferous treasures
so rich that the neighbourhood was reputed for a time a
veritable El Dorado, both in Europe and America, He
did not fail to note the superior grazing capabilities of
the country, but was unable to discover any signs of
fresh water, although, as was afterwards ascertained,
there were three distinct sources of supply within a
few miles of the mountain (now called Station Peak)
which he had climbed. Flinders is entitled to high rank
in the list of Australian explorers, not only for the services
just described, but also as being the first who circum-
navigated Australia, and claimed possession of its entire
territory for the British crown.
The favourable report of Murray, confirmed by Flinders,
induced G-overnor King to urge upon the Duke of Portland
J. H, Nicholson, 65 V7illiam Street, Melbourne.


the desirableness of forming a settlement at Port Phillip.
This suggestion was based not merely on the obvious
fertility of the soil and the genial character of the climate,
but also on the anxiety of His Excellency to checkmate
the French, who had sent out the ship Le Geographic to
explore the Australian coasts with the alleged object of
planting a French colony somewhere close by. Pending
the arrival from Downing Street of full authority to carry
out his contemplated project, Governor King commissioned
Mr. Charles Grimes, the Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, and Lieutenant Charles Robbins, a naval officer,
to perform a walking tour round Port Phillip harbour.
This task was undertaken by these gentlemen in December,
1802. The leader of the expedition discovered the river
Yarra on the 30th January, 1803, and it was ascended by
him as far as Dight’s Falls, Studley Park, on the 2nd of
February. The party breakfasted on Batman’s Hill, which
has since been levelled to make way for the Spencer Street
railway station, Melbourne. Happily the journal of the
Grimes Expedition, kept by James Fleming, one of the
assistant surveyors of the party, is preserved in the
archives of the Colonial Secretary’s Office at Sydney. In
that document Mr. Fleming remarks: —“ The most eligible
place for a settlement that I have seen is on the Fresh-
water River [the Yarra]. In several places there are
small tracts of good land, but they are without wood and
water. The country in general affords excellent pasture
and is thin of timber, which is mostly low and crooked.”
A.t the. same time the course of the Saltwater River was
traced from its debouche back to Keilor. Corio Bay was
carefully examined, but the explorers kept too near the
beach in their journey to admit of any acquaintance being
made by them with the Barwon or the Moorabool. .On
Nicholson’s Ear Drums Cure Deafness.


the whole, the decision of the Surveyor, as the result of
his circumambulation, was unfavourable to the vicinity of
Port Phillip as a place of settlement.
A different conclusion was arrived at, however, by the
Colonial authorities in London, after considering the des-
patches of Governor King. Eight days subsequent to the
discovery of the Yarra, Lieutenant-Colonel Collins was
sent out from England in charge of a cargo of convicts,
under the surveillance of a small armed force, to form a
penal settlement on the shores of Port Phillip, corre-
sponding to the one which had previously been established
at Sydney Cove. The party, numbering 402 souls, com-
prised 15 Government officials, 9 officers of marines.
2 drummers and 39 privates, 5 soldiers’ wives and
I child, 307 convicts, with 12 married women and 1 child.
They were conveyed in H.M.S. Calcutta, a ship of 1,200
tons, which was accompanied by the Ocean, a store ship
of 481 tons, sailing from Spithead on the 24th April,
1803. The Calcutta called for stock, seed, and provisions
at Teneriffe, Kio Janeiro, and Simon’s Bay. The same
vessel made the land about Port Phillip on the 9th Octo-
ber, and entered the harbour on the same day, the Ocean
arriving two days sooner. A landing of the exiles was
effected about eight miles from the Heads, near the site
of the present watering-place, Sorrento. The choice of
Collins for the command of such an expedition was singu-
larly unfortunate, since proof is only too plain that he
came out to Australia under a strong apprehension that
his mission would result in failure. He appointed Lieu-
tenant Tuckey, with two assistants, to survey the harbour
in the Calcutta’s launch; and, after spending nine days in
this undertaking, Tuckey wrote of Port Phillip:—“ The
kangaroo seems to reign undisturbed lord of the soil, a

dominion which he is likely to retain for ages.” In a
similar strain Collins, in his despatches to the Home
Government, dwelt ad nauseam on “ the disadvantages of
Port Phillip,” and the unsuitability of the bay itself,
“ when viewed in a commercial light,” for the purposes of
a colonial establishment; and he added a prediction, than
which none was ever more signally falsified, that the place
would never be “ resorted to by speculative men ! ” While
regretting on a certain occasion, during his stay in Sullivan’s
Bay, the necessity of employing hands to load the Ocean
previous to his abandonment of the proposed settlement,
he justifies his course on the ground that “ the sooner we
are enabled to leave this unpromising and unproductive
country the sooner shall we be able to reap the advantages
and enjoy the comforts of a more fertile spot.” In this
view Collins was strengthened by Governor King, who
had altered his opinion under the influence of Grimes’
representations, and in a letter to Collins dated from Port
Jackson, 26th November, 1803, His Excellency writes—
“lt appears, as well by Mr. Grimes’ and Mr, Robbins’
survey, that Port Phillip is totally unfit for settlement in
every point of view.” Moved by the picture of desolation
thus exhibited, Lord Hobart sent out instructions that the
Collins settlement was to be broken up and transferred
to the river Derwent, Yan Diemen’s Land. On the 24th
January, 1804, Collins was not sorry to quit the despised
bay in obedience to orders from London. The expedition
remained on shore altogether fifteen weeks, and during
that period there had been one birth, one marriage, and
twenty-one deaths. The first child of European descent
was born in Victoria on the 25th November, 1803, and
was named William James Hobart Thorne. The first
wedding took place on the 28th of the same month,
Nicholson’s Ear Drums Cure Deafness.


between Richard Garrett, a convict, and Hannah Harvey,
a free woman. The first death was that of John Skilhorne,
a settler, on the 10th of October.
When it is remembered that the persistent depreciation
of Port Phillip by Collins and others in authority was
attended with its fortunate escape—however narrowly —
from the taint of convictism, we can but regard the erro-
neous opinions which had been formed of the soil as a
“blessing in disguise.” Nevertheless, it cannot be denied
that from the abortive attempt of Collins at settlement
dates the prejudice indulged by a section of the Sydney
people against the country, which has never been com-
pletely effaced, despite its marvellous strides in popula-
tion, wealth and enterprise in the last forty years. How
near the officers of the Calcutta were to ushering in the
gold era —which, however, did not dawn for about thirty
years later —is seen from the recorded fact that some of
them found a sparkling substance in a sandy stream they
had met with, which they thought to be gold.
For twenty years after the departure of the Calcutta,
Victoria remained unvisited by a single ship, and un-
trodden by a white man’s foot. Meanwhile, a limited patch
of territory around Sydney had, during that interval, deve-
loped good agricultural capabilities. These pastoralists
had more or less prospered, and flocks and herds had mul-
tiplied. The spirit of exploration was also active among
the inhabitants of Port Jackson. In 1817, the head waters
of the Macquarie were reached by Wentworth and Blax-
land over the Blue Mountains. Evans brought to light
the productive region now known as Bathurst Plains.
Oxley journeyed along the banks of the Macquarie and
the Lachlan, foreshadowing the discovery of a mighty
stream, flowing in a south-west direction. But it was not

until 1824 that the Murray was seen for the first time by
white men. Those who enjoyed this distinction were
Hamilton Hume and W. C. Hovell, two stockmen, who-
in that year crossed the Australian Alps, discovered the
Upper Murray, and passed into Victoria. Hume was a
bold, persistent, and energetic bush traveller, and had
been previously consulted by Sir Thomas Brisbane, in
Sydney, in reference to an overland expedition to the-
south coast of New South Wales, The travellers started
on the 3rd October, and on the ] 7th November crossed
the Murray. On the 24th the Ovens River was met
with and named; the head waters of the Goulburn
were struck on 3rd December; King Parrot Creek was
discovered on the 7th, and the shores of Corio Bay, near
the present site of Geelong, on the 17th of the latter
month. Hume was afterwards second in command to
Captain Charles Sturt, and Hovell was attached to an
expedition despatched from Sydney to Western Port by
Governor Darling in December, 1826. The origin of the
latter expedition —which consisted of detachments of the
3rd and 30th Regiments, despatched in H.M. ships Fly
and Dragon —was a determination on the part of His
Excellency to forestall a supposed design of the French in-
appropriate Western Port for colonising purposes. After
a year’s trial, however, the British settlement at that point
was given up, partly because suspicion of the French had
cooled down, and partly for the unsupported reason that
the place was unfit for a penal settlement.
Captain Sturt’s exploration of the Murray belongs to-
general geographical discovery in Australia. The next
leading event, directly bearing on Victorian history, was
the establishment of the first permanent settlement in
Victoria by a few Englishmen who had experienced dis-

appointment in respect to tlie capabilities of Western
Australia and Yan Diemen’s Land. To the brothers
Henty belongs the honour of being the first family who
came to Victoria to stay. The Jason of these Argonauts
was Edward Henty, who died in 1878, and whose memory
is entitled to special respect as the real father of the
colony. He was the son of Mr. Thomas Henty, banker
and landowner in Sussex, who, with his sons, emigrated to
Launceston, Tasmania, in 1831. Edward, being desirous
of ascertaining by personal inspection what part of the
coast was best adapted for settlement, visited Spencer’s
Gulf, and spent two months in examining the country.
Bad weather drove his vessel, on her return passage to
Launceston, for refuge into Portland Bay, 266 miles west
of Port Phillip. The appearance of the country impressed
Edward Henty favourably. He visited Portland again
in 1833, bringing with him from Tasmania farm imple-
ments, vegetable seeds and fruit trees, supplied to him by
his father. .The first building erected in Victoria was
Mr. Henty’s wool store ; the first dwelling was Richmond
House, in which he resided at Portland, and where the
first native Victorian of European descent, Richmond
Henty, was born. Edward constructed the first plough,
which was exhibited at the Victorian Agricultural Show
of 1887, held in Melbourne, turned the first furrow,
planted the first vine, milked the first cow, shod the first
horse, and sheared the first sheep, in Victoria. His
brother Stephen and he had been successful in whaling
pursuits while at Launceston, and soon converted Portland
into a whaling as well as a sheep and cattle station.
Francis, a younger brother, who was a youth when he
landed with his brother Edward in Victoria, resided in
Melbourne at the date of our writing, and no name in the
colony is more highly esteemed.
J. E. Nicholson, 65 “William Street, Melbourne,


One of the surprises encountered by Major (afterwards
Sir Thomas) Mitchell on his exploratory overland journey
in 1836, from New South Wales to the southern country,
was “ a considerable farming establishment belonging to
the Messrs, Henty,” which ho found in a region regarded
by him as totally uninhabited by whites. After examining
the Darling and Eiverina districts, he turned southward on
the 20th June, 1836, towards the junction of the Loddon
and the Murray. Bending his course westward, he crossed
the Avoca and the Wimmera, and climbed to the top of
Mount William, overlooking a magnificent and variegated
range of country, whose rare adaptation for agricultural
and pastoral purposes justified him in denominating it
Australia Felix. After discovering the beautiful valley of
the Wannon, lying to the east of the river now known as
the G-lenelg, and which received its name from the explorer,
Major Mitchell and his party reached Portland on the
20th August, His first thought was that the establish-
ment of the Hentys was a nest of pirates, while that
family, with quite as much justification, deemed Mitchell
and his party a gang of bushrangers. Naturally, the
satisfaction of hosts and guests was mutual in being un-
deceived. It is noteworthy that another infant settlement
had taken root on the banks of the Yarra, of whose exist-
ence Mitchell had not been cognisant. Speaking of the
view from the summit of Mount Macedon, to which he
assigned the name it bears, he says:—“ I could trace no
signs of life about this harbour [ i.e ., Port Phillip]. No
stockyards, cattle, nor even smoke, although at the
northern point of the bay I saw a mass of white objects
which might have been either tents or vessels.” Yet,
upwards of a year previously, a settlement had been
formed near the bay, and the foundations laid of the city
of Melbourne.

The next notable figure identified with the early history
of the colony was John Batman, who arrived from Yan
Diemen’s Land at Port Phillip in May, 1835, and con-
cluded a treaty with the natives for a grant of 600,000
acres of land, which, however, like many other schemes of
a like kind proposed by immigrants, was unceremoniously
disallowed by the Imperial Government. About eight
years previously, John Batman and J. T, Gellibrand, of
Launceston, asked for a grant of land at Western Port,
with a view to following pastoral pursuits in that locality.
The application, however, was summarily rejected by
Governor Darling, to whom it was addressed. But the
project went to sleep until Batman, in 1835, chartered a
vessel at Launceston, and, in company with seven black
fellows from Sydney, proceeded to Port Phil]ip. Follow-
ing the track of Flinders, as laid down in a copy of a
chart sketched by that commander, Batman ascended
Station Peak, and looked down with admiration on the
rolling and fertile country which Hume and Hovell had
traversed. He then followed in part in the footsteps of
Surveyor-General Grimes, ascending the Saltwater and
Freshwater Rivers. The latter he called the Yarra Yarra,
supposed to mean the “ ever flowing.” Meeting a body of
natives, he arranged the contract before referred to for the
transfer to himself and his heirs for ever of a large area
of land, which included the present sites of Melbourne
and Geelong and all their suburbs. The price to the
natives by the intended buyer, for an estate considerably
more than half a million acres in extent, was twenty pairs
of blankets, thirty tomahawks, a hundred knives, fifty
pairs of scissors, thirty looking-glasses, two hundred hand-
kerchiefs, one hundred pounds of flour, and six shirts —
to be paid down at once; and an annual value of one

hundred pairs of blankets, one hundred knives, one hun-
dred tomahawks, fifty suits of clothing, fifty pairs of
scissors, and five tons of flour. The original document
may be seen in the Melbourne Public Library. Another
transaction, only somewhat less ambitious, was attempted
by Batman with a tribe who claimed to be owners of a great
domain in the vicinity of Corio Bay. He endeavoured
to obtain from the latter possession of 100,000 acres in
that district; but, as in the larger negotiation, the
Imperial Government refused to ratify the bargain. His,
partners in the undertaking were C. Swanston, James
Simpson, J. T. Gellibrand and J. H. Wedge, and ulti-
mately the Governor of Hew South Wales allowed the
Batman Syndicate <£7,000 in remission of money actually
due from them on land they had purchased at Port
Phillip, in compensation for the claims which Governor
Darling and the home authorities had cancelled, “ recog-
nising the services which the company had rendered in
the colonisation of the country.” Notwithstanding pro-
fessions of goodwill by the aborigines, it turned out that
they had hatched a plot for taking Batman’s life, which
was only frustrated by the interposition of “the wild
white man,” William Buckley, who had escaped from the
short-lived settlement under Captain Collins in 1803, and
who, after solitary wanderings, had lived among the
natives as one of themselves for thirty years. When
Batman met this almost naturalised blackfellow, he had
lost all recollection of his native language, which was only
to a very small extent brought to mind by him during the
remainder of his life. He was held by the blacks to be
an ancient and buried chief, risen from the dead, and
was venerated accordingly. The sight of one of his own
race, after so long and unbroken a period spent among
Nicholson’s Ear Drums Cure Deafness.


savages, touched his sympathies. Hence the assistance
he so seasonably rendered to Batman in a moment of
peril.
Close upon the heels of Batman came John Pascoe
Fawkner, another Launceston man, who in the same year
organised an expedition for the colonisation of the same
locality. Fawkner had served in some capacity on board
the Calcutta, when Collins made unsuccessful efforts to
found his settlement near Sorrento, and he consequently
knew something of the harbour. For partners in the new
immigration movement he had six other persons. He
chartered in Tasmania the Enterprise, a 50-ton schooner,,
which entered Port Phillip Heads on the 16th August,
1835. The vessel was moored on the north bank of the
Yarra, immediately opposite the site of the present Custom
House, in Flinders Street, Melbourne. At that time the-
river was fringed with feathery scrub, and was not as yet
tainted by the sewage of a great city. The Enterprise landed
its cargo, consisting of horses, ploughs, pigs, furniture,
and farming implements. Five acres were soon ploughed
and planted with corn, fruit trees and vegetables. But
Fawkner delayed his own coming until the following trip
of the vessel. Five hundred sheep and fifty head of cattle-
arrived in the following month. John Aitken also brought
a number of sheep about the same time, and depastured
them on Mount Macedon. Fawkner “turned the first
sod, built the first house, opened the first church, and
started the first newspaper in the settlement.” He may.
therefore, claim to be the father of Melbourne, Batman-
being entitled to credit as the first coloniser of the shores
of Port Phillip Bay. The first sermon was preached by
the Rev. James Orton, a Wesleyan minister who came
over with Batman in April, 1886, under the shade of the-

Casuarina oaks on Batman’s Hill. The settlement on the
Yarra was now sufficiently advanced to call for govern-
mental administration. A petition to that effect was
agreed upon at a public meeting. Governor Bourke was
solicited to appoint a resident magistrate at Port Phillip,
and the prayer of the petitioners was conceded. Already
177 settlers from Yan Diemen’s Land had become inha-
bitants of the district, their stock and other property
amounting to <£llo,ooo. Before the close of 1836 the
population was materially increased. The resident magis-
trate appointed by Governor Bourke was Captain Lonsdale,
and his duties were rendered specially arduous owing to
the number of blacks within a circuit of thirty miles,
being five times the number of whites under his magis-
terial jurisdiction. The first public-house was started by
Fawkner at the corner of what is now William and Collins
Streets, from which centre the city spread eastwards. The
first houses, for the most part, were of wattle-and-dab, and
to the east of Swanston Street all was wilderness. In
1837 Sir Richard Bourke came over from Sydney to visit
the rising city, and encamped in the western part of the
street called after him. Half-acre city allotments, put up
at auction at £5 each—£7 being then deemed too high
a price—were sold a few months afterwards at £25 to
£lOO each. The hut of Batman’s shepherd stood where
St. Francis’ Cathedral is erected, in Elizabeth Street, and
the first post-office was opened in a small brick building a
little west of what is now Temple Court, in Collins Street
West.
On the 4th February, 1839, Lord Glenelg, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, appointed Mr. Charles Joseph Latrobe
Superintendent of the District of Port Phillip, that office
carrying with it the authority of Lieutenant-Governor.
STicholson’s Ear Drums Cure Deafness.


He erected a wooden house, which he had brought out
with him from England, on sloping ground eastward of
the city, upon which he saw fit to bestow the name of
Jolimont. In August, 1850, an Imperial Act was passed
erecting the district into a separate colony, Mr, Latrobe
being appointed first Governor. In that year, which
immediately preceded the one in which gold was disco-
vered, the province of Port Phillip, not yet fifteen years
old, had a revenue of =£23o 000, while its exports amounted
to .£760,000, and its population to 76,000. These figures
are sufficient to show that the colony had ample resources
to ensure its solid development, independently of the gold
discoveries, which, nevertheless, so powerfully accelerated
its expansion. What sanguine dreamer, in his wildest
imaginings, could have anticipated, thirty-seven years ago,
that Victoria, in the year 1888, should possess more than
a million inhabitants; that the population of its capital
and suburbs should reach 390,000; that the revenue of
the colony should be =£7,000,000 a-year; that the products
of the western portion of the colony, first cultivated by the
Hentys and the Robertsons, should have attained such
large dimensions; and that Gippsland, discovered by
Angus McMillan, who started on his tour of exploration
from a station near the Snowy Mountains in January,
1840, with a stock-rider, should give promise of such
splendid progress ; that 1,800 miles of railways should
be working, and paying to the bondholders who lent the
money to build them full interest on the outlay, with a
surplus to the good P

CHAPTER H.
Population and Growth of the Leading Cities.
✓T'vELBOURNE has risen, in the short space of
\I / fifty-three years, from the little farming village,
established by Batman and Eawkner on the
banks of the Yarra in 1835, to the position of the ninth
city in the world, and handsome streets and buildings,
which have been admired by visitors from all parts.
Mr. Anthony Trollope described it as “ one of the most
successful cities on the face of the earth.” Mr. G. A.
Sala gave it a world-wide reputation as “Marvellous.
Melbourne.”
The town of Melbourne, when fifteen months old,
consisted of about 100 houses, amongst which were stores,
inns, a gaol, a barrack, and a school-house. Some of the
dwelling-houses were tolerable structures of brick. A few
of the inhabitants were living in tents, or in hovels with
thatched roofs, till they could provide themselves with
better accommodation. The town allotments had been
put up at £5 each, but some of them sold for from £25
to <£loo each. The Bank of Australasia established a
Melbourne branch in 1838, the officers who came over
from Sydney making a voyage of six weeks’ duration in
a schooner, Victorian journalism had its birth in the
Nicholson’s Ear Drams Care Deafness.


same year, Mr. Fawkner’s first newspaper, the Advertiser,
being published in manuscript. The pastoralists who
took up land to the north and west prospered, and the
metropolitan settlement rapidly increased. Melbourne
was made a city in 1849, and in the following year Port
Phillip, as the district was called, had a revenue of
<£280,000; its exports amounted to £760,000; and its
population was over 76,000. In February, 1851, the great
bush fires occurred. Fertile districts were wasted, and
there was a terrible destruction of life and property by
the conflagrations, which culminated on “Black Thurs-
day.” In July of the same year the district of Port
Phillip became the colony of Victoria, A few weeks
afterwards the country was electrified by the gold dis-
coveries, which were to have such an important effect on
its advancement. Early in the following year immigrant
ships had begun to arrive in large numbers —in one year
alone 80,000 persons arrived —and the quiet town of
Melbourne became a very bustling place.
Two remarkable developments which arose out of the
crowded state of the metropolis were Canvas Town and
Pag Fair. House accommodation became wholly inade-
quate to meet the requirements of the great multitude,
and holders of tenements made enormous profits by letting
portions of their mean dwellings at extraordinary high
rents. Many persons not destitute of means were obliged
to live in tents, while large numbers slept in the open air.
A unique suburb sprang into existence on the south side
of the Yarra, just beyond Prince’s Bridge. It was impro-
vised by the surplus population, who could not obtain
shelter in overcrowded Melbourne, Its name —Canvas
Town —describes its construction. It was pleasantly
sitrated, commencing on a grassy slope, and was laid out
J. H. Nicholson, 65 ‘William Street, Melbourne,


in streets and lanes; the principal thoroughfares were
crowded with hoarding-houses and shops, all of canvas.
The Government charged the occupant of each impromptu
dwelling ss. per week for the right to camp on the site.
All sorts of people mingled together in this primitive
township, and here many “new chums” took their first
lesson in roughing it. After a time, however, the police
gave so had an account of the place that the Government
determined on its suppression.
Another novel and interesting scene was the market
which sprang into existence on the wharf, whe:'3 most of
the arrivals landed, in Flinders Street. The exorbitant
rates charged for cart-hire and store-rent precluded many
from removing their heavy luggage, which remained day
after day piled up in huge heaps by the water-side. At
length some of the immigrants devised a plan for its sale.
An impromptu bazaar was opened; the sea-chests were
placed back to back and arrayed in lines with the upturned
lids strewed with the contents, so that the merchandise
was fully exposed for inspection. A brisk trade soon
sprang up, in which abundance of wearing apparel and
household furniture was sold at “alarming sacrifices,” as
the exigencies of the times demanded the immediate dis-
posal of all cumbrous articles. The low prices increased
the popularity of this Rag Fair, as it was called, and the
business became at last so considerable that, in response to
the complaints of shopkeepers, the City Council ordered its
discontinuance. In striking contrast to the efforts made
by these new chums in getting rid of their superfluities in
order to buy a suitable outfit for the diggings, were the
dissipations and freaks of many returned diggers, who,
having been lucky on the goldfields, were now recklessly
squandering their quickly-acquired wealth. These extra-

vagant displays tended to quicken the movements of new
arrivals in their preparations, and to keep up a constant
flow of the population between the rich diggings and
the town. In these days the streets of Melbourne were
full of gum-tree stumps and deep ruts. The principal
thoroughfare, Elizabeth Street, was for months in the year
a flooded quagmire, in which, on one occasion, a waggon
and team of horses were absolutely swallowed up, and
bullock drays were daily bogged. Imported iron buildings
and bark “humpies” were also common on every hand.
Melbourne is now one of the finest capitals in the
world. Including its suburban municipalities, eighteen
in number, all lying within a radius of ten miles of the
Town Hall, it contains 871,630 inhabitants. It is well
laid out, with wide and regular streets, with broad side-
walks, well-paved and lighted. Tree-planting in the streets
has been extensively carried on, giving a pleasant shade,
as well as being refreshing to the eye. The chief buildings
are not only handsome, but many are of great archi-
tectural merit. The cathedrals and churches, schools,
Parliament House, Treasury, Town Hall, Post Office,
Law Courts, Customs House, University, Museum, Free
Library, National Gallery, banks, clubs, theatres, and
other public institutions, are worthy of special admira-
tion. The banking corporations are settled in buildings
which would adorn Threadneedle Street. The wharfs on
the banks of the Yarra now give accommodation to large
ocean-going steamers. The shops and warehouses are
equal to those of leading cities in the Old World. Every-
thing necessary to make life enjoyable can be procured
in Melbourne, and the mansions in the fashionable
suburbs are only less gratifying evidences of the pro-
sperity of the people than the thousands of pleasant
J. H. Nicholson, 65 William Street, Merbonrne.


cottages —many of them the freehold property of their
occupants —to be seen on every road within a few miles of
the city.
Any visitor to the colony must be struck with the
perfect arrangements for water supply. Every house,
down almost to the smallest cottage, has its bath-room.
The most important reservoir is the Yan Yean, which is
an artificial lake at the foot of the Plenty Ranges, nearly
nineteen miles from Melbourne proper. A few years back
complaints as to the quality of the water of the Yan Yean
were numerous; but now, the water, though perhaps not
quite pellucid, is perfectly safe and pure. The numerous
parks and reserves and public gardens in and around
Melbourne are heritages, sacred to the health and enjoy-
ment of the people, which astonish the new-comer from
crowded European cities, where one is taxed for space to
breathe. This is above all a place for the people. In no
large town of the world has a working man so many
enjoyments as in Melbourne, or so many privileges.
The whole country, as well as the metropolis, is dotted
with free State schools. The Free Library, Museum,
Picture Galleries, and the Botanic and Zoological Gardens
afford free recreation and instruction to the labourer and
mechanic, as well as to the clerk or shopman. Melbourne
is plentifully furnished with provident, charitable, literary,
scientific, religious and social institutions to suit all classes
and creeds. In the matter of amusement the inhabitants of
the metropolis are furnished with five theatres and several
music halls, and there are numerous flourishing musical
societies. There is also abundant provision for outdoor
sports, which are always well patronised. Racing, cricket,
lawn tennis, football, rowing, yachting, and bicycle riding
are the most popular amusements. There are no more


perfect arrangements of the kind in the world than those
at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where the members’
pavilion is not only a grand-stand, but possesses dining,
billiard, and bath-rooms. Melbourne possesses two first-
class racecourses within a few minutes’ ride by rail from
the city. At Flemington the greatest race in Australia,
the “ Melbourne Cup,” is run on the first Tuesday in
November. From every part of the continent, people of
all classes then flock to Victoria’s metropolis. The “ Cup
Week ”is the Carnival of Australia. If Flemington is
like Epsom, Caulfield course may be said to be the Ascot
of Melbourne. There is an annual attendance of not less
than 100,000 well-dressed people at Flemington on Cup
Day, and drunkenness and disorder are always conspi-
cuously absent.
Melbourne is well supplied with omnibuses, cars,
cabs and waggonettes, which are commodious and clean.
Parliament, by special Act, authorised the construction of
traction sub-surface cable tramways through the main
streets of the city and the respective suburbs, most of
which have been laid down by the Melbourne Tramways
Trust, a body elected for that purpose by the city and
suburban corporate councils.
There are inland towns in the colony which are
deserving of mention, on account of their large and pros-
perous populations, as well as their substantial architectural
characteristics. Ballarat, the second city in the colony, is
situated one hundred miles from Melbourne. It has been
well named the “ Golden City,” In the early days the
gold-yielding powers of Ballarat were simply marvellous.
No district in the world ever produced so much of the
precious metal in so short a space of time. It has been
stated that, in many instances, “claims” not more than


eight feet square, and about the same depth, yielded from
<£lo,ooo to £12,000 each. At the Prince Eegent mine,
men made as much as £16,000 each by a few months’
work. At one claim, a tubful of dirt yielded £3,325.
The “Welcome Nugget,” found in 1858 in the same
neighbourhood, was sold for £10,600. Those days have
gone, but Ballarat, as it is now, is still more wonderful
than when gold was in very truth “more plentiful than
blackberries.” Anthony Trollope said of Ballarat, some
fifteen years ago, that “ in point of architectural excellence,
and general civilised city comfort, it is certainly the
metropolis of the Australian goldfields.” Sturt Street,
the principal thoroughfare, is a mile and a half long, two
hundred feet wide, and has a fine row of trees in the centre.
The principal buildings on either side are the city hall,
post office, mechanics’ institute, banks, theatre, hospital,
and several large churches. The population is 40,000.
The reservoirs, from which the water supply is obtained,
have a storage capacity of 600,000,000 gallons. These
works cost £300,000. Lake Wendouree now adds to the
charming aspect of the city; hundreds of small yachts,
miniature steamers, and rowing boats float on the lake,
which is stocked with perch, trout, and carp. The
botanical gardens, on the other side of the lake, are
prettily laid out and well kept. Fine wheat and wool are
grown in the neighbourhood of Ballarat, and the city has
some repute for its iron manufactures, especially loco-
motives for the railways. The public buildings comprise
a spacious hospital erected on high ground, orphan
and benevolent asylums, lying-in hospital, refuge, public
baths, mechanics’ institute (with library of 12,000
volumes), free public library (with 13,000 volumes),
extensive railway premises, 2 town halls, 3 theatres, and


about 40 churches. The educational establishments num-
ber 2 colleges, 4 grammar, 10 State, 3 denominational
schools, and a Government school of mines. Three well
conducted daily, and one weekly, newspapers are published.
Over 84 miles of good streets have been constructed, and
attractively planted with trees, and 164 miles of footpath
are now made and channelled. There are 8 iron foundries,
13 breweries and distilleries, 4 flour mills, and 1 woollen
mill; also, boot and other factories. G-old was first
discovered at Ballarat in June, 1851. As the surface
diggings became exhausted, it was found that richer
deposits of the metal could be obtained at lower depths,
to which fact is to be attributed the permanence of the
progress of Ballarat. Returns from these goldfields show
that the value of material employed is considerably over
.£300,000, the number of miners employed about 9,000,
and the extent of auriferous ground now worked more
than 856 square miles. The first juvenile exhibition in
Victoria was held at Ballarat, and was very successful.
Sandhurst* or as it was originally termed, Bendigo, is
a little over one hundred miles from Melbourne. It has
about the same population as Ballarat, 40,000. It is
the head quarters of a rich auriferous country, consisting
principally of quartz ranges, which, from their almost
inexhaustible character, will doubtless be a source of pros-
perity for years to come. There are about 1,000 quartz
mining leases in the district, covering an area of over
18,750 acres, 160 mining plants being within the city,
which is traversed by 100 miles of streets. The main
street, named Pall Mall, abounds on one side with hand-
some brick and stone shops and stores, the opposite side
being a reserve known as Rosalind Park. A substantial
and ornamental building facing Pall Mall has just been


erected by the Government, with ample provision for all
the necessary public offices. There is a savings bank,
hospital, benevolent asylum, mechanics’ institute (with
library of 6,800 volumes), branches of several banks, a
fine theatre, and the town, masonic, temperance, and
St. James’ halls. There are three recreation reserves in
the city, Eosaliud Park, Weeroona Park and lake, and
the botanical gardens, the latter beautifully laid out and
planted with choice shrubs, and having a good collection
of foreign animals and birds. There are eighty miles of
trees planted in the streets, and the visual effect is very
pleasing. The industries followed, besides gold mining,
are represented by large iron foundries, railway carriage
works, coach building factory, pottery, granite cutting
and polishing, tanneries, brick and tile works, and cordial
manufactories. Farming and wine-growing is largely
pursued in the neighbourhood. Sandhurst has 19
churches; St, Paul’s (Church of England) having an
excellent peal of bells. Mining operations give employ-
ment to 6,500 miners, and 260 steam engines. The value
of the mining plant is estimated at about .£550,000, and
the operations extend over 144 square miles of country.
Three newspapers are published in the city. The Sand-
hurst School of Mines is well patronised. Instruction is
given, not only in the various branches of science con-
nected with mining operations, but also in many other
subjects not necessarily connected with mining.
Geelong, which takes rank as fourth in Victorian
■cities, is picturesquely situated on the shores of Corio
Bay. In the early days, having a rich back country, it
for a long time promised to rival Melbourne, but a bar
in the harbour proved an impediment to shipping, and
the metropolitan city soon shot ahead of its temporary


rival. The population of the town is now estimated
at 10,000. This is one of the oldest municipal town-
ships of Victoria; it lies forty-five miles south-west
of Melbourne. The town is well laid out, on ground
sloping to the bay on the north side, and to the Bar-
won river on the south; and its streets abound with
attractive shops, fine stores, and business premises. The
principal buildings comprise the town hall, exhibition
building, hospital, benevolent asylum, numerous churches,
free public library, mechanics’ institute (with library of
11,127 volumes), post office, branches of various banks,
agencies of insurance companies, clock tower, grammar
school, Q-eelong college, State schools, and the law courts.
The botanic gardens, overlooking the bay, are extensive
and well laid out. The public gardens and park are very
fine. Corio Bay has four good jetties, alongside which
ships of the largest tonnage can load and discharge.
G-eelong has the credit of establishing the first woollen
mill in Victoria. The cloth is manufactured by hand
loom and steam power. Pour mills are in full operation.
There are five wool brokers, a meat preserving company,
one of the largest tanneries in the colony, and several
excellent wool-scouring establishments. The increased
facilities given for shipping wool direct to England, from
the wharves, has led many growers and buyers to avail
themselves of the saving thus effected. Extensive quar-
ries of limestone are developed at the eastern boundary of
the town, on the shores of Corio Bay. Two daily and
two weekly newspapers are published.
Five of the suburbs of Melbourne are now cities, viz. r
South Melbourne (formerly Emerald Hill), with a popu-
lation of 36,000; Prahran, with a population of 34,000 ;
Richmond, with a population of 31,000; Fitzroy, with a


population of 30,300 ; and Collingwood, with a population
of 28,500.
During the past three years there has been an extraor-
dinary rise in the price of land in the city and suburbs,
and the whole colony has shared in this evidence of pros-
perity, In 1886, as compared with the previous year,
there was an increase of <£525,627 in the annual value of
urban rateable property, and of <£302,018 in the country
properties. The increase was much larger in 1887, but
the figures are not yet available. During the years 1886-7
and 1887-8, Melbourne has been affected by a land boom
of unprecedented dimensions as far as this colony is con-
cerned. In the principal streets of some of the suburbs
of Melbourne, land, which two years ago could have been
bought for <£so a foot, is now selling at from <£loo to
£2OO a foot. During the last twelve months land in some
part's of Collins Street has advanced from £l,lOO per foot
to <£1,500 per foot. In the best parts of Elizabeth Street
the value of land jumped from <£7oo or <£Boo to <£1,300
per foot. The old disused premises of the English, Scottish
and Australian Chartered Bank in Elizabeth Street, sold
by the bank for <£33,000, were re-sold a few months after-
wards for <£45,000, and a short time afterwards changed
hands again at the price of £61,000. All this happened
within the past year, and many other similar instances
could be quoted. Another remarkably profitable land
transaction of recent times may be mentioned. In 1882,
a man purchased a small allotment in Cavanagh Street,
on the south bank of the Yarra, at £2 10s. per foot. He
spent £2 15s. per foot in filling up the land and erecting
a brick cottage on it; and a few months ago he found a
purchaser at £7O a p oot.


CHAPTER 111.
Metallic Resources and their Development.
VICTORIA owes much to its metallic resources as
an initial element in its rapid development. To
the attractions of the precious metal are due the
vast influx of population which occurred between 1851 and
1857, and gold continues to be one of the leading exports.
The gold mining industry comprises two principal descrip-
tions, quartz and alluvial gold mining. In the first, veins
and lodes, or reefs of quartz traversing the Silurian rocks,
and containing gold, are mined in much the same manner
as other metalliferous lodes, and the quartz is crushed
and the gold separated by means of mechanical appliances.
The quartz is contained in the silurian rocks in an infinite
variety of forms —as solid lodes, coinciding with the planes
of the nearly vertical strata; as “saddle formations,”
resembling in cross-section a succession of inverted V’s,
thick at the apex, and thinning out in the limbs; as succes-
sions of blocks; as flat veins; and as assemblages of veins
and bunches, following certain bonds of the silurian rocks,
or traversing igneous dykes which intersect the latter.
The gold occurs in the quartz in many forms as small
specks, as strings and ragged pieces, occasionally attaining
a large size, and, more rarely, as crystals or groups of


crystals. The principal associated minerals are iron,
copper, and arsenical pyrites, galena, and zinc blende;
the iron pyrites frequently contain a large proportion of
gold in mechanical combination.
Alluvial gold mining includes a number of different
conditions, varying from “ surfacing,” where the gold is
found in the thin soil and rubble, covering the surface of
nearly exposed silurian rock to “deep lead” mining,
where the concealed auriferous gravel deposits of ancient
river beds are reached by means of sinking costly shafts
through hundreds of feet of volcanic and sedimentary
layers which overlie them. Under whatever conditions,
however, it may be found, alluvial gold means detrital
gold, or that which once contained in veins and reefs of
quartz has been' disintegrated and conveyed by geological
action to various distances from the sites of those
matrices.
Geological investigations tend to show that the gold-
bearing reefs were formed in the silurian rocks of Victoria
before the close of the palaeozoic era, and that the upper
portions of these rocks, with their contained quartz veins,
have been planed off by denudation to the extent of
thousands of feet in vertical height. All the alluvial or
detrital gold deposits yet found in Victoria are red, older
than the middle tertiary or pliocene epoch ; many of them
are post-tertiary or recent.
Some time before actual discoveries of gold were made,
Sir Roderick Murchison predicted them on the strength of
specimens of Australian rocks which had been sent to him.
Station hands were also reported to have found pieces of
gold, but the stories were hushed up, the squatters not
desiring that their flocks and herds should be disturbed
by an influx of gold seekers. The great discoveries in


California, however, followed by those in New South Wales,
caused systematic efforts to be made to achieve similar
results in Victoria, and they were crowned with unex-
ampled success. Between March and September, 1851,
gold was found in large quantities at Clunes, Mount
Alexander, Ballarat, Buninyong, the Pyrenees, and various
other localities, which were speedily occupied by thousands
of diggers.
James Esmond was the Victorian pioneer digger. He
it was who found gold in payable quantities at Clunes on
the Ist July, 1851. In 1848 he was driver of the mail
coach between Buninyong and Horsham. For several
years he had filled that monotonous position, when,
attracted by the gold discoveries in California, he deter
mined to try his fortune there. Meeting with no luck in
California, he returned to Victoria, and occupied himself
with bushman’s work on a station in the Pyrenees.
Presently a German geologist, named Dr. Bruhn, arrived
on the scene, and showed to Esmond and his mate rich
specimens of gold found in the neighbourhood. Esmond
and his companion then, on the Ist July, 1851, entered on
a prospecting tour. On reaching the banks of Deep
Creek, a tributary of the Loddon, they were gladdened
by the sight of glistening quartz. A little diligent
fossicking there was rewarded by the unearthing of a few
rich specimens of grain gold, or what appeared to be
such. In order to make sure of the richness of the metal,
Esmond determined to have the specimen tested by an
assayer at Geelong. On arriving at that town the pure-
ness of the gold was vouched for, and eager inquiries
were made for the locality where the precious treasure
could be found. Esmond declined to divulge his secret,
and hastened to obtain the necessary implements and
b 2


utensils for working the coveted field. It was the
6th of July before his digging expedition (the first in
Victoria), which consisted of three men besides himself,
was fully equipped. Before leaving Geelong, Esmond
disclosed his destination to the assayer, who advised
other parties fitting out for the Turon diggings to remain
in the district, because of the probability of richer gold-
fields being shortly found close at hand. In the mean-
time another discovery was announced. A party of six
men found sprinklings of gold in the bed of Anderson’s
Creek, a tributary of the Yarra, and only a few miles from
Melbourne, Esmond’s field attracted about thirty men,
and produced satisfactory results until the end of August.
It then became evident that the precious yellow grains
were no longer to be found in the alluvial deposits. The
men at dunes were getting into severe straits because of
the poorness of the shallow diggings when a visitor to
the place brought the welcome news of fresh discoveries
and encouraging prospects for diggers in the neighbour-
hood of Buninyong. Amongst the first to leave the
Clunes diggings was Esmond, its original prospector.
He joined a party of nine, who marched over the hills
to the newly-discovered fields. Though remarkably
successful as a digger, he was singularly unfortunate in
his speculations. Subsequently, <£l,ooo was voted to him
in reward for his discoveries. He also received a grant of
a piece of land on the site of the first gold-field.
During the early days of the gold-fields, the diggers
suffered a great deal from misgovernment. They were
hunted by the police, and fired at if they could not
produce their licenses when called upon, and it was a
common thing to see a digger chained to a log, awaiting
the adjudication of a magistrate, because he had not paid


the monthly sum of thirty shillings; or because he did
not happen to have the license in his pocket when called
upon by a trooper to produce it. At the end of 1864 a
large proportion of the diggers on Ballarat, exasperated by
a failure of justice in a case in which one of their number
had been murdered in a disreputable hotel, and, irritated
by numerous tyrannical acts on the part of the police and
the officials, took up arms, and entrenched themselves in
a stockade, having some wild idea that they could over-
turn the Government. Mr. Peter Lalor, late Speaker of
the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, was chosen leader.
The diggers hoisted their standard—the Southern Cross—
and five hundred of them took a solemn oath to fight to
defend their rights and liberties. The Government forces
consisted of police and soldiers. Captain Thomas, who
was in charge of them, determined to take the insurgents
by surprise, in preference to waiting for them to attack
the camp. The attack was made just before daylight on
the morning of Sunday, the 3rd December. Many of the
disaffected diggers were not sleeping in the stockade, as
they did not anticipate that the military would make any
move before reinforcements arrived from Melbourne. The
assault was brief but bloody. The stockade, which con-
sisted chiefly of a barrier of ropes, slabs, and overturned
casks, was penetrated in a few minutes, and the defenders,
who fought vigorously for a time, were driven out into the
shallow holes in the neighbourhood. Several volleys were
fired on both sides, but most of the diggers who fell met
their deaths in the shallow pits, where they were, shot or
bayonetted in the first heat of the conflict. The military
force numbered 276 men. The loss of the latter also was
considerable, including one officer, Captain Wise, of the
40th Eegiment. Of the insurgents, 30 were killed on the


spot, and a great many wounded. There were 125
prisoners taken in the stockade. The following account
of the engagement was given by Kaffaelo, an eye-
witness :
“ I awoke Sunday morning. A discharge of musketry
—then a round from a bugle —the command * Forward’—
and another discharge of musketry was sharply kept up
by the red coats for a couple of minutes. The shots
whizzed by my tent. 1 jumped out of my stretcher, and
rushed to my chimney facing the stockade. The force
within could not muster then above 150 diggers. The
shepherds’ holes inside the lower part of the stockade were
turned into rifle pits The dragoons from the
south and the troopers from the north were trottxig at
full speed towards the stockade. Peter Lalor was on top
of the first logged up hole within the stockade, and by
his decided gestures pointed to the men to retire among
the holes. He was shot down in his shoulder at this
identical moment. It was a chance shot. I recollect it
well, for the discharge of musketry from the military now
mowed down all who had heads above the barricades. .
Those who suffered most were the pikemen, who
stood their ground from the time the whole division had
been posted on top, facing the Melbourne road from
Ballarat, in double file under the slabs to stick the cavalry
with their pikes. The old command, ‘ Charge’ was dis-
tinctly heard, and the red coats ran with fixed bayonets to
storm the stockade. A few cuts and kicks, a little pulling
down, and the job was done; too quickly for their wonted
ardour, for they actually thrust their bayonets through
the bodies of the dead and wounded strewed about the
ground. A wild hurrah burst out, and the ‘ Southern
Cross’ was torn down. Of the armed diggers some made


off the best way they could, others surrendered themselves
as prisoners, and were collected in groups and marched
down the gully. . . . The red coats were now ordered
to ‘ fall in,’ their bloody work being over, and were
marched off, dragging with them the ‘ Southern Cross.’ ”
When Mr. Lalor fell he was covered by his friends
with slabs and escaped capture. In concealment his arm
was amputated, and, though a large reward was offered
for his apprehension, his hiding-place was never disclosed.
The leading rioters were prosecuted by the Government,
but the public sympathy was with them, and no jury could
be found to convict. The riot, though it was deplored by
the best friends of the men engaged in it, had the effect
of directing attention to many evils suffered by the
diggings population, and of eventually securing their
remedy.
Most of the great goldfields were opened during the
few years immediately following the first discovery, the
prospecting population being then so great. Other new
fields of less importance and extensions of old ones have
since been opened from time to time, but no great dis-
covery in shallow ground has been made for the last ten
or twelve years. There are now leads being worked at
from depths of from 400 feet to 500 feet. The position and
depths of leads supposed to be auriferous are now usually
first ascertained by means of boring, for which purpose
diamond drills are extensively used. Shafts are then
sunk through the superincumbent layers into the bed-
rock, drives are extended, and rises from the latter put
up to the gravel, which, if payable, is then excavated and
brought to the surface to be washed. Tens of thousands
of pounds are frequently expended before the deep alluvial
mines become remunerative, and sometimes after all failure


is encountered; but successes have in the main counter-
balanced the failures, and increasing experience tends to
lessen the risk of the latter. There are still hundreds of
miles in length of unworked leads, which are likely to
reward future enterprise.
During the first five years of gold-digging little or no
attention was paid to quartz-mining. The early modes of
working quartz were rude, and for a long time the belief
prevailed that the lodes were not likely to prove remune-
rative below a depth of 400 feet, from the surface. By
degrees, however, it was found that in many reefs whose
payable quartz had died out a short distance from the
surface, other “makes” of auriferous stone were to be
met with by sinking deeper, and confidence was restored
as fresh discoveries were made at increasing depths in the
quartz lodes of Stawell, Sandhurst, Clunes, and other
mining centres. There are now many mines in which
highly remunerative quartz is being obtained at depths
varying from 1,000 feet to 2,500 feet.
The total yield of gold obtained in Victoria, from the
first discovery to the end of 1886, has been 54,393,182
ounces, valued at .£217,572,728; and the proportions of
the total obtained respectively from quartz and from allu-
vial workings are about equal, though during the first ten
or fifteen years the alluvial gold greatly exceeded in quan-
tity that obtained from quartz. In future it may be
expected that the yield from quartz will year by year
progressively excel that from alluvial workings. Extensive
and important as are the known quartz mines of Victoria,
the total area occupied by them is insignificant compared
with what are of probably similar character, which,
although as yet untested, contain alluvial gold deposits,
and these are a sure index of proximity to auriferous


quartz. There is little cause to douht that, as predicted
by Mr. A. R. G. Selwyn, twenty years ago, the quartz lodes
of Victoria will equal the tin mines of Cornwall as perma-
nent fields for mining industry.

In his summary prefixed to the official report of the
mining registrars for the quarter ended 31st December,
1887, Mr. C. W. Langtree, the Secretary of Mines,
remarks ; —“ In my last summary I recorded an increase
of 15,889 ounces for the quarter ended September, and
now it is my pleasing duty to chronicle an increase for the
December quarter, the figures being as follows;

The reports from the principal mining stations for the
period are of an encouraging nature, and there is every


indication that the present year (1888) will be moi« pros-
perous, as regards raining, than any of the last decade.
The mining population of the colony for the final quarter
of 1887 was estimated at 25,795, the number employed in
quartz mining being 12,384, and 13,413 in alluvial mining.
The area of auriferous ground actually worked is returned
as a little over 314 square miles.

• Of late years the silver raised has been extracted from gold in the process of
refinement at the Melbourne branch of the Royal Mint.
f The quantity of coal raised was 13,153 tons.
Many attempts have been made in Victoria to mine for
coal —notably at Cape Paterson—but the seams hitherto
worked have been too thin to yield a profit. Thicker
seams, however, have been discovered at the Moe and at


Mirboo, in G-ippsland, and it is considered not altogether
improbable that valuable coal fields may yet be opened up
in these localities. There is also some prospect of silver
mining being profitably established at St. Arnaud. At
present, however, the large silver yields are chiefly confined
to New South Wales.


CHAPTER IV.
Agriculture.
*> *HE agricultural resources of tlie colony, although
only developed to a comparatively limited extent,
have contributed in a marked degree to place
Victoria in its present prosperous position, and the best
guarantee for its future progress is to be found in the
agricultural expansion, capable of resulting from its rich
soil, genial climate, and various other advantages. It is
only fifty-three years since the first white man settled
upon Victorian soil, but a much shorter time has elapsed
since the march of progress properly began with the
inrush of population, soon after the discovery of gold in
1851. The development of agriculture has a still more
recent commencement, for, at the time of the gold
diggings, the land was in the possession of Crown tenants,
who leased it as sheep and cattle runs; and many years
passed before the new colonists, attracted by the discovery
of gold, could succeed in passing laws for the throwing
open of the land to agricultural settlers, lip to the
year 1860, land could only be obtained at auction, and
it was difficult for men of small means to secure farms.
Although more liberal land laws were passed after that
date, it was not until 1869 that an Act was framed under
which agricultural settlement was effectually encouraged.


Owing to the enterprise of the early colonists, first-class
live stocks of different breeds had been imported from the
first, so that, when the public lands where thrown open
for selection in 1869, the colony was well supplied with
trained farmers of local experience; stud herds of short-
horn, Hereford, Ayrshire, and Alderney cattle had been
established, as well as studs of the best draught and
thoroughbred horses, flocks of merino, Lincoln, and Lei-
cester sheep, with well-bred representatives of other kinds
of live stock. Under the Land Acts which preceded that
of 1869, the greater portion of the best land in the coast
districts had been alienated, many large estates used for
grazing purposes having been formed, so that agricultural
settlement, under the more liberal provisions of the new
Act, had to extend mainly over the northern or inland
portion of the colony. Settlements were rapidly formed
in all parts of the northern plains, and wheat-growing,
the most suitable industry for the pioneering stages of
such districts, quickly assumed larger proportions. Three
years after the Aot came into force, viz., in 1873, the land
under cultivation amounted to 965,000 acres, while ten
years later the area had increased to 2,215,900 acres. The
total extent of land under the wheat crop in 1873 was
350,000 acres, and in 1883 it was 1,104,400 acres. The
land under cultivation in 1887 was 2,417,680 acres, and
in the same year the land under wheat amounted to
1,052,685 acres.
The fertility of the Victorian soil is a well-established
fact. Only a few years after the landing of the first
settlers, potatoes grown in some portions of the western
district won fame in older established parts of Australia,
and other products were soon afterwards grown with
equal success. At Belfast and Warrnambool the rich


volcanic soil often gives a yield of from twelve to fifteen
tons per acre of potatoes, and ten tons per acre is a
common yield. The districts of Lancefield, Daylesford,
Kyneton, Ballarat, and G-ippsland contain land of the
same kind, and all over the colony a large proportion of
the soil is exceedingly fertile. Even in those parts of the
colony where the yield of the crops is small, the defect is
not so much in the soil as in the supply of moisture.
There are in the inland northern portions of the colony,
districts which do not enjoy such a liberal rainfall as
others. In such localities the yield of the crops is
generally comparatively light, but the soil is rich, a fact
that is proved from the large yield obtained in a moist
season. Having extensive areas of fertile soil in all parts
of its territory, and consequently under different condi-
tions of climate, the products of the colony are both
abundant and varied.
The climate is of the most favourable kind. There is
no winter in the English or American sense of the word.
The time called winter is merely the season in which there
is more rain and less heat than in summer. Yery few
Australians have ever seen snow. Upon the inland
mountain ranges, and the elevated land in their vicinity,
a little snow falls occasionally, but only sufficient to make
the ground white for a few hours. The native trees are
evergreen, not casting their leaves in the winter, although
English trees and others indigenous to cold countries do.
The winter is only a modified summer. Stock are neither
housed nor fed in the winter.
The rich soil and warm genial climate combine to
render the colony’s productions abundant and varied. In
the coast districts, where all kinds of cereals, leguminous
and root crops are cultivated, the yields obtained from the


unmanured land are all that could be desired. The
average of the whole colony is always lower than the
results obtained by farmers who understand their busi-
ness. The system of farming carried on stands much
in need of improvement. The majority of those upon the
land have had no training as farmers, and the system,
like that of all new countries, is not calculated to produce
the best results. Farmers who understand their business,
and give the land reasonable cultivation, obtain from 35
to 45 bushels of wheat, oats, and barley per acre in dis-
tricts where the general average is not more than from 15
to 20 bushels per acre. Much heavier yields than those
stated are frequently obtained, but from 35 to 45 bushels
per acre are common when the land is well cultivated.
With potatoes, mangolds, beets, and peas, the same
difference is observed between the average obtained by a
rough system of farming and upon land properly culti-
vated. About 5 tons of potatoes per acre is a payable
crop, and from 12 to 15 tons per acre are frequently
obtained. Hay, which is made from wheat or oats, yields
from 2 tons to 4 tons per acre, and English grasses foi
pasture are successfully cultivated in all the coast dis-
tricts. Maize is a crop which grows well in the more
moist portions of the coast districts, and as much as 100
bushels per acre is frequently obtained. Owing to the
defective system of farming, many of the crops for which
the colony is suitable are much neglected, the tendency of
settlers being to neglect rotation, and confine their atten-
tion to growing a single description of grain. Thus
wheat-growing is carried on more extensively than most
other departments of farming. All over the northern or
inland districts wheat can be profitably produced, and in
.some sections other cereals do not thrive so well, and this


fact also tends to swell the proportion of the colony’s
wheat production. The statistics of the harvest of 1887-8
show that the colony produced 13,328,765 bushels of
wheat, 4,562,530 bushels of oats, 198,225 bushels of
barley, 117,294 bushels of maize, 791,093 bushels peas,
161,088 tons of potatoes, 20,590 tons mangolds, 11,774
tons onions, 624,122 tons of hay, and 732,060 bushels of
peas and beans. The wheat production of the colony is
capable of great expansion, but there are more numerous
opportunities and larger profits to be made by developing
the various branches of husbandry which are partially
neglected by the farmers.
The wheat grown in Victoria is the finest in the
world. It always brings the highest price in the London
market, fetching considerably more than English, Indian,
American, or New Zealand wheat. The wheat crop is
generally the first sown by the new settler, as it quickly
returns a profit, and brings in resources to keep the
farmer going until stock-raising, dairying, or other
branches of industry are established. Many settlers
have found continuous wheat-growing upon the rich
virgin soil of the colony a profitable business; but the
rule is that the best farmers, after a year or two, add
the growing of other crops in rotation, and establish
herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, breeding also horses and
swine upon the farms.
Oats grow well in all the coast districts of the colony,
and in the more moist of the inland districts. In the
driest sections of the inland districts there is not moisture
enough for the oat crop, but the area of the colony upon
which oats cannot be cultivated is comparatively small.
In the moist districts from 40 to 50 and up to 60 and 70
bushels per acre are obtained with good cultivation, and


the crop is successfully grown in rotation with wheat,
barley, and roots.
As barley requires more moisture than wheat, there
are dry districts inland from the coast ranges where it
cannot be properly grown, but the area of its cultivation
is more extensive than that of oats. It yields good
returns all over the coast half of the colony, and upon
about half of the inland area. English barley grows well,
producing a fair malting sample and a good yield, the crop
being a profitable one, although considerably neglected
by the farmers, who generally give too much attention to
wheat-growing. Those farmers who grow barley in rota-
tion with oat, wheat, and root crops are generally the
most successful.
The maize crop is one which is not understood by the
majority of Victorian farmers. Although crops of 100
bushels per acre, or as heavy as in any part of America,
are obtained, and those who engage in its cultivation
make large profits, the majority of farmers pay no atten-
tion to the cultivation of this cereal. In America it is
much more extensively cultivated even than wheat, maize
being, in fact, the staple crop of the country. It is grown
as a general crop in those states where only from 30 to 40
bushels per acre are obtained, and there are but few of the
coast districts of Victoria where better yields would not
be produced. The cultivation of maize, if attended to by
the farmers, would be as profitable in Victoria as in many
parts of America.
As in the case of maize, the cultivation of peas, beans,
and vetches is much neglected by Victorian farmers.
Peas have received some attention, and the result has
been highly satisfactory. In the coast districts good
yields are obtained, and the crop is profitable in more


ways than one, for it has been found highly valuable in a
system of rotation. Lands which had been impoverished
by continuous grain-growing have been brought back to a
state of fertility by sowing the pea crop, and in limited
districts where the merits of the pea crop are understood
it plays a leading part in the system of maintaining the
productiveness of the soil. Beans, although growing
fairly well in the moist district, are not extensively
cultivated, and although vetches are found to do satis-
factorily, their cultivation is at present limited. It is
in the cultivation of many of these neglected crops that
the agriculture of the colony could be greatly developed.
The crude state of our farming system offers encouraging
opportunities for an influx of farmers, whose skill would
turn our various unused advantages to account.
The potato crop has been cultivated in most of the
coast districts of the colony, and it yields a much higher
return than cereals. Farms upon which potato growing
is carried on usually command an exceptionally high
value, a fact which bears the best testimony to the
profitableness of the crop. Mangolds have also been
successfully grown, very heavy crops being obtained, but,
owing to the defective system of farming, the potato is the
only root which has received much attention. Potatoes,
being required for human food, find a ready market,
and hence their comparatively extensive cultivation by
the farmers; but as mangolds, beets, and carrots are
required principally for feeding stock, they receive very
little attention. Feeding stock is a system not properly
understood in the colony. The rich pastures, and the
absence of cold winters, enable farmers to keep their
.stock in the fields all the year round, and, at the same
.time, cause the business of feeding stock to be neglected.


Notwithstanding the richness of the pastures and the
mildness of the winters, much could be done in the way
of increasing the profitableness of stock-keeping by
producing food, and the neglect of taking advantage of
such an opportunity is one of the principal defects of
our farming system. Those farmers who grow food for
dairy cows, pigs, and other stock, find the system pro-
fitable, and they are generally more prosperous than
their neighbours. Where heavy root crops can be grown,
it is not the fault of the country if they are not cultivated.
As the system of farming improves, the growing of man-
golds and carrots may be expected to increase, and it is
believed that the cultivation of beets for sugar-making
will ere long become an important industry. Most of the
onions used in the Australian colonies are grown in
Victoria. The crop in the coast districts yields from ten
to fifteen tons per acre, and the soil, which is never
manured, shows no signs of exhaustion after more than
twenty years’ cultivation.
Hay, which is extensively grown in the colony, is made
from oats or wheat, cut just before ripening. The yield
is from two to four tons per acre, the last-named being
the return obtained in the coast districts, and the former
in the inland districts. In moist localities, or where
irrigation is practised, lucerne is grown for hay, and it is
one of the most profitable of crops. Prom four to six
tons per acre are obtained, the crop yielding from four
to six cuttings of about one ton each. In all of the
coast districts, rye-grass, clover, cocksfoot, fog, foxtail,
fesques, and other grasses are successfully- cultivated,
and it is the practice to lay down fields in pasture after
they have been growing grain for a number of years.
Very little manure is used in the colony, letting out the


land in cultivated pasture being the most common means
of maintaining fertility. In tbe northern or inland
districts the rainfall is not sufficient to render the cultiva-
tion of English grasses profitable, but in those localities
the growth of the natural grass is so rapid, and the
quality of the pasture is so rich, no inconvenience is
experienced from the absence of artificial grasses. After
the cereal crop there is good pasture afforded by the
self-sown grain, and in the second year the natural grass
has established itself so well as to carry more stock than
the unbroken pasture.
Hop culture has been established in the colony for
some years, and there are extensive districts along the
coast and near the mountain ranges specially well suited
for the industry. Although hop growing was introduced
at a comparatively recent date, and much had to be
learned as to the cultivation of the plant and the treat-
ment of the hops, the industry has already assumed an
important position. The soil and climate are much better
suited for hop growing than those of England or the eastern
states of America, as shown in the higher yields obtained.
From 20 to 25 cwt. per acre are frequently obtained from
unmanured virgin soil, and about 10 cwt. per acre is
yielded by yearling hops, California is the only country
in the world that can show results equal to those of
Victoria. Although such heavy crops are obtained, and
the quality of the hops is excellent, only a few growers at
present appear to understand the art of properly pre-
paring the hops for market. Only a small quantity,
therefore, is suitable for exportation to the London
market; but, as the art of treating the hops becomes
better understood, the industry will no doubt furnish a
large quantity for export.


The tobacco crop is one which may be expected to
increase as time passes. The soil and climate have been
proved to be well suited for tobacco culture, and the
cultivation of such a valuable crop may be expected to
show development with the increase of population and
the progress of the country. It will have been gathered
from what has already been said that the climate resembles
that of the south of Europe, and it follows that the
various products of France, Spain, and Italy can be
cultivated in the colony. This is not a matter of theory
only, for experiments have already been tried which prove
that the various rural industries of southern Europe can
be introduced with an assurance of greater success than
ever attended them in their native country. Fruits of all
kinds —from apples, pears, plums, peaches, apricots, and
cherries, to grapes, oranges, lemons, and olives —have
been tried, and found to flourish in a manner which
astonishes natives of the south of Europe. The mul-
berry grows luxuriantly, and the introduction of silk
culture is only a matter of time. The only reason why
the colony does not produce more fruits, olive oil, and silk
is that it is too prosperous. Wages are so high that other
industries involving less labour absorb the attention of
the population. The state of California, however, the
climate of which resembles that of Victoria, is teaching
us that, by adopting machinery and labour-saving
methods of management, many of the industries of
southern Europe can be profitably carried on when the
population is limited, and the rate of wages high. The
attention of colonists has recently been attracted to the
fact that in California fruit growing is developing
marvellously on account of the system which is adopted
of drying apples, apricots, prunes, raisins, and currants.


and preserving fruit in cans, and efforts are already being
made to introduce the same system into Victoria. Vines
and fruit trees of all kinds grow well both in the coast
and inland districts of the colony, and those colonists who
are engaged in the cultivation of vineyards and orchards
are generally even more prosperous than the farmers who
grow grain.
There are many districts in Victoria which are admi-
rably adapted to fruit growing. For years past Victoria
has exported considerable quantities of dried and fresh
fruits to neighbouring colonies, and within the last two
years the beginning has been made of an export trade in
fresh fruit with the United Kingdom, which is expected
eventually to develop into large proportions. Shipments
of Victorian apples, pears, and grapes to London have
been well spoken of by the fruit merchants there, but
much has yet to be learned in the matter of packing. It
will, doubtless, be found in the future that refrigerating
and other appliances will greatly aid the successful estab-
lishment of this trade. In the Old World it will, of course,
be a great advantage to have fresh Australian fruit
arriving at a time when fresh fruit of the same kind
cannot be obtained in the northern hemisphere. When
irrigation is more generously practised, large tracts of
land, not good enough for agriculture, will be devoted to
fruit growing. In Victoria land is nominally and really
cheap. It gives such a good return upon the market value
that it is considered by capitalists one of the best invest-
ments, During the last twenty years the Government
have been offering the public lands at a low price to pro-
mote settlement. Land worth from £2 to <£3 per acre
could be had from the Government for £1 per acre, with
from ten to twenty years to pay the purchase money.


This fact, together with the rough system of farming
carried, on, is sufficient to show that land could not rise to
its natural value. Had an advanced system of farming
been carried on, obtaining the best possible results from
the soil, and if no land could be had without purchasing
in the open market from holders who knew its worth, land
values would have risen to their intrinsic worth. But
land of the best quality could all along be obtained at the
nominal rate of £1 per acre, with long terms, and the soil
has not been developed to its full extent. At the present
time purchasers get the advantages of these circumstances.
They obtain land near markets and upon railway lines, at
a cheap rate. In the inland dry districts, where land is
rising in value owing to its productiveness having been
tested, good land is sold at from £2 to £3 per acre. Farms
with fencing and buildings upon them change hands at
from £2 10s. to £4 10s. per acre. These may be taken as
average prices. In positions specially convenient to lai ge
towns, first-class agricultural land is worth from <£2o to
.£25 per acre, and land which is suitable for the potato
crop fetches from £3O to £SO per acre, but these are
exceptional values. It frequently happens that sheep
farmers give from £2 to £3 per acre for unimproved grass
land, to be used for grazing purposes alone, and the agri-
culturist can generally obtain a much larger return than
the keeper of stock. It will be readily understood that
the present value of land is low when compared with the
returns obtainable from the soil, for the price is regulated
by the circumstances of the country. Those circumstances
which tend to keep down the price of land are the limited
population, the quantity of Government land offered for
the nominal sum of £1 per acre, with easy terms, and the
absence of a system of high farming. When the Govern-


ment lands are all taken up, and the growth of population
increases, the demand bringing into existence also a sys-
tem of high farming, land will command a much higher
price than at present. The time is, therefore, a favourable
one for obtaining cheap land. Farms are always to be
had, as they change hands, and those who purchase within
the next few years will not only make profits upon their
agricultural operations, but at the same time gain advan-
tage by the increasing value of the land.
The colony of Yictoria is about 66,250,000 acres in
extent. Of this area about 15,530,000 acres have been
alienated to private owners. An area of about 7,584,000
acres is in process of alienation under a system of defined
measurements, and after deducting roads, mining reserves
and State forests there remains an area of about 80,000,000
acres available for settlement. Of the 30,000,000 acres
available for settlement, 11,500,000 acres are what is
known as the mallee country, which occupies the extreme
north-western portion of the colony. The mallee country
has been set apart for occupation under a system of leases
from the Crown. The mallee in its present condition being
insufficiently supplied with water, and covered more or less
with a scrub of small trees and shrubs, is unsuitable for
being taken up in farms of the ordinary size for agricul-
tural purposes. The mallee is divided into two parts—
viz., “ the border” and the interior area. On the border
allotments of various sizes up to 20,000 acres are let for
a period of twenty years, and in the interior larger blocks
are let for the same period. In the case of the border
allotments the rent is fixed by regulation, and applications
are granted without competition at a land board. The
rents fixed for the interior blocks are 2d. per sheep and
Is. per head of cattle for the first five double those


amounts for the second five years, and 6d. per sheep and
3s. per head of cattle for the last ten years. At the end
of the leases the land reverts to the Crown, and lessees are
to be compensated for permanent improvements. It is
expected that, at the expiration of the leases, the land,
having heen improved, will be suitable for occupation in
smaller areas. The greater part of the mallee country has
already been taken up, and occupiers have commenced to
carry out improvements.
An area of about 20,000,000 acres of Crown lands,
apart from the mallee, is now open for settlement under
an Act of Parliament passed in 1885. This area is divided
into pastoral lands and agricultural and grazing lands.
The pastoral lands are surveyed in holdings capable of
carrying from 1,000 to 4,000 sheep, and from 150 to 600
head of cattle. These pastoral holdings are leased for a
term of fourteen years, the rent being Is. per head for
sheep, and ss. per head for cattle, the carrying capacity of
the holding to be determined upon a basis of not less than
ten acres to a sheep. If there is more than one applicant
for a holding, the block is put up to auction among the
applicants, and given to the highest bidder. Lessees are
required to destroy rabbits, wild dogs, kangaroos, and
wallabies, and at the termination of the lease compensation
is to be granted for such improvements as fences, wells,
reservoirs and dams to the amount of 2s. 6d. per acre.
The agricultural and grazing lands, amounting to
about 8,712,000 acres, are surveyed in blocks of not more
than 1,000 acres each. These areas are leased for a term
of fourteen years, the rents being fixed at not less than
2d. per acre or more than 4d. per acre, the valuation,
according to quality, being made by officers of the Govern-
ment. The allotments are surveyed, and shown numbered


upon a plan. The applicant makes application for a given
block, and if there are more than one application a land
board decides which party is to obtain the land. The
holder of one of these areas is not required to reside upon
it, but he must destroy rabbits and other vermin, and
fence his allotment within a period of three years. At the
expiration of the lease compensation is granted for all such
improvements as fences, wells, reservoirs, tanks and dams
up to a limit of 10s. per acre. Upon the leasehold the
occupier is allowed to cultivate for his own use, but not for
market. Any male person eighteen years of age, who has
not already selected land under any previous Land Act, is
eligible to take up land under the existing law.
The occupier of one of these allotments can obtain the
ownership of 320 acres upon easy terms. Any person
who has not previously taken up land in the colony can
select 320 acres of his leased land as a freehold. If an
occupier selects a freehold, he must pay for it at the rate
of Is. per acre annually for six years. At the end of the
six years he can either continue paying at the rate of Is.
per acre until a total amount of 20s. per acre has been paid,
or he may pay the balance of 14s. per acre and obtain a
Crown grant. The conditions are that the selector must
reside upon his allotment, or within five miles of it, for
six years, and within that period put on improvements to
the value of £1 per acre. Persons who do not reside upon
their selections must pay altogether <£2 per acre for the
freehold, and put on the <£l per acre improvements within
three years. Under the existing law also grazing licenses
are granted over auriferous lands and State forests.
A limited extent of Crown land is sold at auction
annually, and special leases are granted for swamp lands,
but the great bulk of the remaining State territory is dealt


with as pastoral lands and agricultural and grazing lands.
It will be observed that the only means of obtaining the
fee-simple of Government land in the colony is by taking
up a 1,000-acre agricultural and grazing block, and
selecting 320 acres out of it. In a few years the whole of
the land will be taken up under the existing Act. The
fact that the land is so quickly taken up is the best proof
persons at a distance can have of the value of the land.
Where there are large areas of free land awaiting settle-
ment there must be adverse circumstances which render it
unsuitable for profitable occupation. In the colony of
Victoria land has always been eagerly sought after, and
as it has been thrown open for occupation from time to
time, under the different Land Acts, it has been quickly
taken up. To the new-comer land ought to be worth as
much, if not more, than to the existing settlers, for, while
colonial farmers are rather prone to follow an old-time
system of management, the new arrival brings with him
improved methods, acquired amid the keener competition
of older and more thickly-populated countries.
From what has already been said, it will be seen
that the scope for agricultural development in Victoria
is almost unlimited. With the exception of wheat
growing, all branches of farming may be considered in
their infancy. There is great room for improvement in
the system of carrying on each branch of agriculture,
and there are rural industries capable of almost unlimited
extension, which have as yet made scarcely any progress.
Of the total area of the colony —over 56,000,000 acres —
not more than about 20,000,000 acres have been per-
manently occupied. The number of farm holdings is
only 36,216, and not more than 2,417,552 acres are under
cultivation. The cultivation amounts to only 2j acres for


each person in the colony. Cultivation has of late years
made satisfactory progress, and all the surroundings of
the case show that the rate of development will he much
more rapid in the future. The greatest increase has
taken place in the production of wheat, a result which
may be accounted for by the suitableness of the product
for export, and the facilities offered by the crop in the
way of giving a quick return to the occupiers of new
country. Dairying, fruit growing, vine growing, hop
culture, the cultivation of tobacco, and other lucrative
branches of industry require some extra attention, and
hence their progress has been less rapid. These latter
industries are now receiving increased attention, and their
progress opens up a very wide field for future develop-
ment. Dor many years the special industries referred to
have been kept back through having to depend upon the
local markets. The American system of pushing exports
of butter, cheese, hams and bacon, dried and canned fruits
and vegetables out into the markets of the world has not
been yet adopted, and hence prices have ruled low for
what should have been our most valuable products. Now,
however, steps are being taken to organise an export trade
in the various products for which our soil and climate are
specially favourable. A few fruit-canning factories have
been established, and the increase of these will enable
our orchards to be extended in every direction, supplying
fruit to distant markets, and so on with the various rural
industries which at present are subordinate to wheat
growing. Those who are now engaging in agriculture-
will take part in the colony’s new career of agricultural
progress, and at the present time the colony offers special
inducements to new-comers. It would be difficult to find
more promising field for the emigrant with capital,


small means, or only his labour to depend upon. Wages
are high, living is cheap, and capital commands a high
rate of interest. The capitalist can find a profitable
investment, be his resources extensive or limited, and the
man who has no money can soon turn his labour into
capital. Land being cheap, the freehold of a farm can
easily be acquired, and the farmer carries on his industry
upon rich soil in a mild genial climate, under the security
of the British flag, and in a country where the rough
pioneering system has given place to the comfort and
conveniences, as well as the educational and social advan-
tages, of civilised life.


CHAPTER Y.
Vine Culture.
aOMPAEED with the old wine-producing countries
of Europe, Australia as a sphere for the cultiva-
tion of the vine, is, of course, only in an
infantile stage of development. But that nature has
liberally endowed Victoria with all the conditions neces-
sary for eminent success in the pursuit of this industry
has already been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt.
The verdict passed upon Victorian wines by experts of
unchallenged reputation, combined with the increasing
demand for them in the British market, renders the con-
tinuous expansion of our vineyards an absolute certainty,
and the rate at which the remunerative production of
wine in the colony progresses, resolves itself simply into
a question of the wise and energetic application of capital,
skill and enterprise. Twenty-eight years ago the space
devoted to vine culture in Victoria amounted at most to
2,000 acres. Even at that early period in the existence of
the colony, which was then barely nine years old, speci-
mens of our vinous products, although as yet crudely
manufactured, had found their way abroad, and received
favourable notice. The generous recognition given them
at the great International Exhibition held in London in
1862, and, subsequently, at similar industrial shows held at


Paris, Philadelphia, Amsterdam and Bordeaux, rekindled
zeal in a pursuit which then had a tendency to languish.
The local Government offered lands suitable for its opera-
tions on advantageous terms. Not'a few men accustomed
to very different occupations immediately plunged, in a
speculative spirit, into wine-making, and large areas were
soon taken up by companies, which, in some instances,
failed to exercise needful caution in the selection of
competent managers of the undertakings. Meanwhile,
within a few years, 2,000 additional acres were planted.
Melbourne journals stimulated the new-born enthusiasm
by publishing, daily, reports of the wine “ boom,” and the
proprietors of one newspaper awarded a handsome gold
cup to the best appointed vineyard. As might be expected,
this seemingly prosperous movement, being largely of
mushroom growth, experienced a temporary collapse. A
considerable number of the vineyards were established in
districts unsuitable as regards temperature, and mistakes
not less unfortunate were made in the choice of soil not
adapted for the species of grape planted. Disappointment
and failure, however, taught lessons of enduring value.
The science of grape growing was more carefully studied,
and thus a guarantee was afforded that the progress of
the industry would be checked by fewer blunders in the
future.
A few persevering vignerons, so far from being
daunted by what had happened, were incited to renewed
exertion, and at the Melbourne International Exhibition
of 1881, samples of wine were displayed from the northern
districts and around Melbourne, which marked a decided
advance in the production, and from year to year since,
this has been fully maintained. A considerable impulse
was given to the industry by the offer of a trophy of


solid silver, valued at .£BOO, to be awarded by the late
Emperor of Germany “to an exhibitor in one of the
Australasian colonies, as an acknowledgment of the efforts
in promoting art and industry, as shown by the high
qualities of the goods manufactured by such exhibitor.”
The presentation of so substantial a premium on wine-
producing merit, by so august a personage, proved to be a
turning point in the history of viticulture in Victoria.
Colonial wine, which had previously been looked upon
with prejudice by people who had never tasted it, soon
came to be spoken of at clubs, hotels, and domestic tables
with respect. Before the lapse of many months, growers
had the satisfaction of seeing the value of their properties
rise in consequence. A spirit of friendly emulation
among owners of vineyards to place a superior article on
the market was created. Qualities of delicacy and
bouquet, especially in light wines, which had before been
neglected by makers of insufficient experience, began to
receive proper attention. At the Indian and Colonial
Exhibition connoisseurs were so favourably impressed with
the samples of Victorian wines that depreciation of them
suddenly ceased, and a growing inquiry has caused steady
and increasing shipments of them to Europe ever since.
In 1886-7 the area under vines in the colony was
estimated at upwards of 10,000 acres, and the quantity of
wine produced amounted to 986,041 gallons. Mr. Hubert
de Castella, one of the highest practical authorities in this
description of manufacture in Australia, states that
towards the close of the Exhibition of 1881, the pro-
prietor of one of the vineyards on the Yarra Flats
requested a representative of the well-known house of
Arles-Dufour, of Paris, to take back to France with him
specimens of his wines—then somewhat below their


present standard of excellence—and have them valued at
Bordeaux. M. A. Lalande, to whom the wines were
submitted, communicated the following gratifying report:
“ We have found the Nos. 1 and 2 (fed wine, 1879, made
from Cabernet-Sauvignon) very good, and we have given
them a value of 1,000 francs per tonneau of 900 litres. We
have found the No. 4 good (white Hermitage, 1879), and
we have given it a value of 600 to 700 francs per tonneau.”
A verdict so impartial, pronounced by a judge possessed
of unapproachable qualifications in his own department,
permanently settles the question as to the position to
which our wines are entitled. M. Lalande was told that
the wines were of Australian growth, and was asked how
their values compared with those of Bordeaux wines.
The price of 1,000 francs per tonneau, which he fixed, was
the price of the crus bourgeois superior of Margaux and
St. Julien at two years old, just the age of the Australian
wines he had tested. The price was also exactly the same
as that of the third classified crus St. Emilion. The
price of 700 francs for the Victorian white wines places
them on a level with the fine white wines of the G-ironde,
“ which, in the first crus, have a handsome pale yellow
colour, much finesse , sometimes mellowness, and a very
agreeable bouquet; they are worth, young, from 450 to
600 francs ; old, they reach up to 700 francs per tonneau.”
It may assist the reader in estimating the vast scope
there is for development in viticulture here, to state that
after the existing vineyard districts —still under very
limited cultivation—have been fully utilised, they will
constitute but tiny patches in comparison with,the tracts
of well-fitted and well-situated soil which await cultiva-
tion. The warm district of the Murray, of which
Eutherglen is the centre, provides at present one-third


of the vines grown in Victoria, although it only occupies
a _4L_th part of the total surface of the colony. But there
is another enormous plain, composed of heavy red fertile
soil, of great vine-growing capabilities, through which the
Murray flows, and which is completely encircled by the
River Ovens, and the Barambogie Ranges, the direct road
from Melbourne to Sydney passing through the middle of
it. The northern slopes in the centre of Victoria, from
Stawell to Bendigo, a winding line of two hundred miles
of mountains and gullies, all capable of producing
splendid wines, are planted with scattered townships,
which are destined to indefinite expansion in the future
through the agency of the wine industry. Stawell,
Ararat, Marong, Strathfieldsaye, Emu Creek, Castlemaine,
Benalla, Sunbury, Essendon, the Yarra Elats, and the
banks of the River G-oulburn have already afforded con-
vincing proof of rare productiveness in the manufacture
of wines. But, after a population of millions has been
prosperously established in these localities in the form of
husbandry referred to, a stretch of land 500 miles long by
60 miles broad is in reserve, running from Cape Otway
to the River Grlenelg, and covering 16,000,000 acres,
admirably adapted for viticulture, but as yet unknown to
the grape.
It is justifiable to contrast the progress of wine-
making in California with its much more tardy develop-
ment in Victoria. We shall thus more fully realise our
possibilities. The American state had only three years the
start of the colony in its first great influx of immigration.
At present the state and the colony have, as nearly as
possible, a population of equal size. Both are situated
in almost corresponding degrees of latitude north and
south. Their rapid growth in the first instance was alike


due to extensive discoveries of gold. Yet viticulture —
like all kinds of agriculture —has risen to dimensions in
California, which, at the present rate of progress, will
take Victoria twenty years to overtake. Against about
1,000,000 gallons of wine produced in Victoria in 1886-7,
about 19,500,000 were produced in California, the returns
of the state being about twenty times those of the colony.
Nevertheless, so comparatively trifling is this greater
quantity relatively to the requirements of the United
States alone, that it will be long before California has any
appreciable surplus to export to Europe. At the same time
the European demand, when Victorian wines become more
fully known, will be sufficient to overwhelm the vignerons
of the colony with orders. The ravages of the phylloxera
in France have diminished the wine crop of that country
from 1,844,000,000 gallons in 1875 to 628,000,000 gallons
in 1885. As the consumption of wine in Europe con-
tinually increases, the startling reduction which these
figures show in the supply must be made up from some
source, and no country has a more encouraging opportu-
nity of taking part in providing for the deficiency than
Australia. How very far Victorians still are from,
even approximately, competing with the wine-producing
countries of Europe for this purpose, is shown by the
following table :
Wine Produced in Various Countries, 1885.
Gallons. Gallons.
Trance 627,792,000 Spain (exports) ... 158,070,000
Italy 499,378,000 Holland 81,994,000
Austro-Hungary... 207,328,000 United States 19,405,000
In addition to European markets, with a collective
population of 250,000,000, India, Japan, and the Malay
Peninsula—in which the people are only beginning to
c 2


conform to the habits of Western civilisation—we have
about 200,000,000 more among whom to introduce our
products. This prospect ought to be animating enough
to encourage even the most timid who command the requi-
site amount of knowledge and capital to enter a field of
enterprise so boundless. An idea of the profit to be
realised may be gathered from a statement by Mr. Hubert
de Castella, himself a notably successful wine-grower:—
“ At Eutherglen, the district for us to judge by, there are
five wine-growers, cultivating an average of 200 acres each,
and 147 farmers an average of 12 acres each. Their wines
cost them 6d. per gallon, or about that, and if they can
sell them during the year following the vintage for Is. 6d.
per gallon, there is, on an average crop of 250 gallons per
acre, a profit of over <£l2 per acre, which no other crop
can give. A cultivation based upon such returns cannot
but increase.” The financial advantage to be reaped from
buying from producers on the ground at the price of
Is. 6d. per gallon, and selling in bulk to consumers, may
be estimated from the fact that it is impossible for a
family in Melbourne to purchase a 2-gallon jar of the
most common claret for ordinary table use at less than
95., or 4s. 6d. per gallon. The price of two gallons, in
bottles, at the vaults of wholesale dealers is 16s. to 255.,
or at the rate of Bs. to 12s. 6d. per gallon. Such wine
would readily fetch in London 80s. to 365. per dozen, or
15s. to 18s. per gallon; and so satisfactory a price, it
must be evident, would leave an ample margin for carriage
to the Victorian port, freight to England, duties, dock
dues, cellarage and warehouse expenses.
Closely connected with wine-growing is the preparation
of raisins, a branch of grape culture not yet initiated on
any scale in Victoria; indeed, the only vigneron from


whom the subject has received scientific attention in Aus-
tralia is Mr. Hardy, of South Australia. In this form of
grape culture, too, Victoria is immensely behind California,
where, despite less favourable climatic conditions, the
manufacture of raisins has already reached large dimen-
sions. The successful cultivation of the raisin grape is
only possible under uninterrupted sunshine, the absence
of fog or rain during the period of ripening, a rich allu-
vial soil with moisture sufficient to keep the vine growing
until the grapes begin to ripen, and immunity from spring
frosts ; but the areas in California having these indispen-
sable conditions happen to be limited in number, and at
considerable distances apart. On the other hand, the
whole of the G-oulburn Valley, with thousands of acres
in other parts of Victoria, are exceptionally favoured in
these conditions for the prosperous culture of the raisin
grape. Ten years ago the raisin in California was
unknown. In 1887, however, the production was close
on 10,000 tons, and this supply will have to be six times
as large before the demand of the Eastern States of the
Union alone can be met. Eor this kind of fruit the Cali-
fornian producer averages in the price he obtains in the
dryer 2-d. per lb., which gives to growers of raisins in the
state a total of <£200,000 per annum. In Eresno, San
Bernardino, and Los Angelos, the prevailing extent of
raisin vineyards is twenty acres. From these vineyards,
with vines from four years old and upwards, the net
annual profit per acre is from <£l6 to £SO. In view of
the small amount of labour required, it is not surprising
that it should be the general opinion in California that
raisin-growing is more profitable than any other branch of
agriculture. Experience will, doubtless, prove the remark
to be equally true as regards Victoria.


CHAPTER YI.
Dairy Produce.
farming in Victoria is still in a crude stage
1 W of its development, but only requires increased
scientific skill, enterprise and capital for its
profitable expansion on a scale commensurate with its
commercial importance. As a rule, farmers have yet
to learn the necessity of bestowing special care, in the
winter season, on the provision of shelter and feed for
dairy cows, which, in most instances, at present receive
only what food and shelter are supplied the year round in
the open fields for cattle being fattened for market. That
milking cows should yield so large a quantity of milk as
they now do for domestic purposes, as well as for the
manufacture of butter and cheese, in the absence of con-
ditions immensely more conducive to the highest possible
return of dairy products, is sufficient proof of the general
mildness of the Victorian climate, and the abundance of
grass obtainable in average agricultural and pastoral dis-
tricts. In the countries of the Northern hemisphere,
where the winters are usually long and severe, the same
omission to provide adequate protection for dairy cows
from frosty blasts and heavy snow storms would not only


render dairy products impossible, but must be attended
with fatal results to the animals themselves. Farmers
are exceptionally to be met with in Victoria who not only
place milking cows in sheds at night during winter, but
are careful to feed them on straw or green fodder.
But, despite the less considerate methods employed by
the bulk of those who carry on dairy operations, the milk,
butter and cheese annually produced in the colony is
valued at a sum not far short of ,£3,000,000. The produc-
tion in average years is equal to home demands, and leaves
a considerable surplus for export to the neighbouring
colonies. Neighbouring markets, however, are capable
of absorbing the merest driblet of the vast amount of
dairy produce which Victoria will be able to dispose of
remuneratively when the industry is advanced far enough
by the aid of the great mechanical processes so extensively
worked in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway
and elsewhere, to cheapen production and thus secure us
a solid footing in foreign markets. Professor Arnold, the
veteran scientific dairyman of America, writes: —“ Dairy
farming is the most appropriate and inviting for the recu-
peration of land exhausted by a succession of grain crops.
It stops exhaustion, and brings good returns from the
first. Forage crops grow well where grain crops pay
poorly. Seeding down to grass gives time for air and
water, heat and frost, to gradually unlock the tenacious
compounds which hold the mineral elements of plants as
with a firm grasp, and let them loose for the rootlets to
feed upon, or to accumulate in the soil for future use. In
this way a poor farm may be made to grow- rich, and
a rich one richer. These considerations ought to have
weight in leading intelligent farmers to exchange the
plough for the milk-pail.”


In addition to the steady increase in the consumption
of dairy produce, which cannot fail to go on pari passu
with the growth of population, especially in the Australian
colonies situated to the north of Victoria, we have awaiting
what consignments of this description we can send them
the markets of India, Japan, and the Malay Peninsula, to
which butter, cheese, and eggs could be conveyed in a
perfectly sound, condition in properly regulated refri-
gerators. In addition to these countries, the United
Kingdom —the greatest mart of all for our surplus
produce —is ready to welcome at once the articles spe-
cified. A Canadian dairying expert remarks:—“ All
dairying countries are striving for a foothold in that
market. Continental countries have an advantage over
Canada and the United States because of their nearness
to it. America has an advantage in her cheap lands, and
in the greater aptitude of the people in devising new
methods and making quick advance.” But Victoria, when
she rises to the occasion, will be found to have an advan-
tage over both America and the European continent in
supplying the dairy wants of England absolutely unassail-
able, notwithstanding our greater distance from the latter
market. The cheap and easy accessibility of Melbourne
from all parts of the colony, in contrast with the enormous
stretches of country over which produce has to be conveyed
at great cost, from the great west of the States and Canada
to the seaboard, is a point in our favour not to be lightly
esteemed. When it is remembered that there are five
million acres in Victoria still available for pastoral, and
eight million acres for agricultural and grazing uses, there
can be no doubt but that plenty of good land is to be
had in Victoria for a long time to come at a low price for
dairy purposes. But our position at the extreme south


of a vast continent in the Southern hemisphere places us
under uniquely favourable conditions for supplying Eng-
land, and enables us to defy both American and European
competition. When it is summer with us, countries in
the opposite hemisphere experience the rigours of winter,
and dairy produce manufactured during spring and sum-
mer in the colony can reach Great Britain in time to
supply the high winter market when the best fresh butter
sells freely to retail consumers at 2s. 6d. to 3s. per lb.
If the significance of this fact were duly pondered there
would be an unprecedented accession of skill and capital
to the dairying industry in Victoria as the most safe,
enduring and remunerative in which it is possible to
engage. The extent to which the mother country is
dependent on foreign supplies of staple provisions is
apparent from the following statistics from the Board
of Trade returns for 1887. In that year the value of
articles of food and drink imported into the United King-
dom from abroad, duty free, amounted to <£116,980,359,
or nearly one-third of the total imports of the country;
butter and butterine being valued at <£11,886,717; cheese,
at .£4,608,937; and eggs, at £3,080,561. It may be further
stated that the bacon and hams imported were valued at
£8,629,941. Towards these totals the United States con-
tributed £1,850,000 in cheese and £6,350,000 in bacon
and hams. From Canada the butter imported amounted
to £121,250, and the cheese to £116,257. From Germany
the eggs and butter received at British ports amounted to
£1,370,144. From the Netherlands the butter received
was valued at £1,776,000, and the butterine at £2,771,488.
France forwarded £2,364,023 in butter, and £1, 215,337 in
eggs. From Denmark the butter and butterine imported
into England in 1886 reached £2,196,476. From Belgium


butter to the value of <£215,529, and eggs amounting to
£657,756 were imported in the same year.
Before, however, the goal of our hopes in doing a large
dairy trade with the almost unlimited markets referred to
is reached, the manufacture of butter and cheese must
become more generally than at present distinct and sepa-
rate industries from pasturing and milking cows. To
produce these articles on a large scale requires factories
and plant involving technical skill and outlay which only
considerable farmers could be expected to command. In
some cases the object is attained by the co-operation
of those supplying milk, and in others by individual
capitalists or joint-stock companies, exclusively devoted to
dairy produce, as in the United States and Canada. In
these countries the separate factory system secures the
extraction of a larger proportion of cheese and butter from
the milk by economical methods than is possible in such
dairies as are commonly attached to farms. Owners of
factories buy the milk from the farmers of the district, the
attention of the former being concentrated on the produc-
tion of the commodities manufactured of a uniformly
high quality. The advantages of the co-operative system
in cheese-making, which has risen to very large propor-
tions in America, naturally led to its application to the
making of butter, and the initial effort in the latter
direction was what is called the creamery. Under this
arrangement the milk is taken to the factory to be set and
skimmed, and the cream churned into butter. This system
has been greatly stimulated by the introduction, in recent
years, of the De Laval cream separator, which is gradually
coming into use in Australia. The main forms of co-
operative dairying at present are, the cheese factory for
making cheese only; the butter factory, for making butter


only from milk; the creamery, for making butter from
cream, which has been collected from surrounding farms ;
the centrifugal factory, or the separation of the cream by
the De Laval machine and the churning of that product
into butter ; and the skim-cheese factory, where partial or
complete creaming for butter is adopted, and the skim-
milk is manufactured into skim-cheese. These particulars
are given to show the limitless scope that there is for
expansion in dairying operations in the colony, and the
rich rewards awaiting those possessed of the requisite
knowledge, means and energy to turn out dairy produce
suitable for English, Indian, and other markets.


CHAPTER VII.
Wool.
VICTORIA has hitherto ranked below Hew South
Wales, as regards the quantity of wool she pro-
duces, but the amount of her annual clip exceeds
that of every other colony of Australasia; and if only the
visitations of drought and market depression—the two
arch-enemies of squatters—do not occur with incon-
venient frequency, her progress as a grower of wool
is certain to be materially greater in the future than
it has been in the past. The quantity of wool pro-
duced in Victoria in 1886 is estimated at 57,489,634 lb.,
the value being <£2,791,923. This aggregate represents
the excess of exports over imports during the year, to
which is added the quantity and value of wool used in the
woollen mills of the colony. In the twelve months pre-
ceding, the quantity produced, reckoned on a similar basis,
was 53,390,100 lb., valued at <£2,960,890. On a rough
average the yield of Hew South Wales has been two-thirds
greater than in Victoria, while the latter colony produces
over a fourth more than Queensland, and nearly a fifth
more than South Australia. The production of Western
Australia, despite its enormous area, is barely equal to


that of Tasmania, although in both these colonies it is at
present comparatively insignificant.
It will be observed from the figures given above that,
although the quantity produced in 1885 was considerably
less than in 1886, the value realised in the former year
was much higher than in the latter. This seeming
anomaly is due to the heavy fall in price which was
experienced in 1886, when the declared value of wool
before leaving the colony, according to the Customs’
returns of exports, was only ll|d. as against Is. Ifd. in
1886, Is. s|d. in 1884, and Is, 3fd. in 1883. Indeed, the
depreciation of wool in Victoria during 1886 was equal to
a total of <£436,000 in comparison with a similar quantity
in 1886, and of .£1,453,000 as compared with a similar
quantity in 1884. The price just stated for 1886 is the
average for all descriptions of wool included in the one
total in that year, so that it is possible that a variation in
the quality may, to a certain extent, account for the dif-
ference in the declared value. But the cause last men-
tioned operated in an inappreciable degree in weakening
market values, compared with the glut of supplies with
which Victorian sellers, in 1886, especially, had to contend.
“ G-ood to superior wool,” the produce of Victoria, which
in 1880 yielded and in 1884 22|d., only realised
18d. in 1886. The year 1887, as distinguished from the
immediately previous twelve months, was one of the most
uneventful periods in the annals of the wool trade. The
variations in price in that period, though in no instance
wide, showed a declining tendency on the whole, but not
on the serious scale of 1886. The chief characteristic of
Victoria, as a wool-growing colony, is the unrivalled adap-
tation of its climate and pasture lands for the production
of the merino wool. It is not, of course, maintained that


the merino sheep cannot he grown in other Australasian
colonies. All that is affirmed is that the description of
merino fleece produced in Victoria is universally recog-
nised in European markets as bearing away the palm; and
the conditions of pastoral settlement in the colony strongly
favour the culture of wool on a large scale by the class of
moderate grazing farmers, who are fast elbowing out the
squatters.
South Australia at first began sheep farming on small
freeholds, and developed the squatter system on leasehold
from the State, which still exists. Victoria, on the con-
trary, from the outset and for many years afterwards, was
the paradise of leviathan squatters, with scarcely any
freehold runs for the first twenty years or more; but a
wholesome change is passing over the country. Instead
of now, as a rule, meeting with flocks of considerable
magnitude wandering over vast areas, it is the happy
tendency of Victoria to become a colony of small grazing
farmers. It cannot be expected that pastoralists of limited
means can afford to pay fancy prices for high-class rams
to improve the breed of their flocks, nor command means
for the erection of expensive machinery to prepare their
wool for market; but, occupying as they do, limited areas,
they are much more favourably situated than the squatting
class are to advance the quality of the native grasses, to
employ irrigation methods, and thus to obtain, by extra
care, a higher percentage of lambs and raise to a higher
standard existing breeds. In this way they secure an
augmented market value for their wool. Besides, through-
out the colony, by the extended distribution of law-abiding
and industrious families, which the breaking-up of large
runs into small leasehold and freehold farms effects, the
profitable culture of the larger kind of sheep having long


wool is promoted —the latter branch of pastoral industiy
being favoured by the demands of increasing urban popu-
lations. By the steady operation of the changes which
have just been indicated, moreover, squatters of the great
territorial type are driven further north into regions
surrounded by conditions conducive to the successful
cultivation of merino wool.
When the fall in prices became pronounced in 1885-6,
a scare was created on the alleged ground that the
Australian trade in wool would be hopelessly ruined by
over-production resulting from the competition of the
River Plate and the United States; but an analysis of the
facts has proved the apprehensions which had been enter-
tained to be utterly unfounded. It may be an open
question whether there is not some risk of the demand
for inferior qualities of wool being sooner or later over-
taken, but these are not the qualities for which Victoria is
most celebrated; and it is noteworthy that the values of
the finest qualities which prevail in the colony were not,
after all, very seriously affected during the late period of
depression.
The fear is expressed in some quarters that the greater
cheapness of land and its superior carrying capacity in the
countries bordering on the River Plate, confer on pas-
toralists in that part of the world advantages which must
eventually dislodge Australia from her position of supre-
macy in producing wool of the finest texture. But the
excessive fluctuations which take place in the supplies of
South American wool, from climatic causes, constitute a
drawback which operates even more injuriously than the
occasionally protracted droughts do which visit Australia.
In Monte Video the pasture is not deemed by skilled
graziers to be suited for sheep; and it often happens in


that state that after some progress has been made in the
culture of flocks and prosperity seems assured, an epidemic
breaks out and sweeps them off wholesale. Moreover, the
scourge is aggravated by the absence of all law for its
prevention, the result being that the infliction is liable to
spread through the carelessness of neighbouring selectors.
In the Argentine Confederation the process of “ refining’’
is found to be necessary for the purpose of rendering
grazing land fit for depasturing stock. In its natural
condition the grass is tall, and so intermingled with scrub
as to be very rank, and only suited to support animals of
a low grade or actually wild. Before superior breeds of
sheep can be sustained upon it, portions of this coarse
vegetation must be burned off; and it is not before three
years have elapsed—during which the burning process has
been repeated several times—that the grass becomes as
fine as that of an English meadow, which is estimated to
carry about two sheep to the acre. Competent observers,
travellers in South America, have remarked that one
Australian sheep yields as much profit as two sheep do in
Buenos Ayres. In that country flocks of about 2,000
have to be shepherded and yarded every night owing to
the prevalence of heavy dews, and, unless they are pro-
tected from these on dry ground, they are in danger of
dying off in large numbers from foot rot. Under these
circumstances all ground for alarm lest South America
should favourably compete with Australia in the better
kinds of wool disappears. In second-class descriptions
Victoria might perhaps be closely approached, but in fine
long-combing wool the colony has no superior, while at
the same time it is free from many fatal influences to
which the countries alluded to are exposed. On patches
of land at once limited and widely apart, in that region,


it cannot be denied that fine qualities of sheep can be
grown; but the reverse is the case as regards the Argen-
tine provinces in the main.
It is not surprising that the quality of merino wool
produced in Victoria should for the most part out-distance
that grown in other countries, when the exceptional con-
junction of circumstances favouring its production is
considered. Unquestionably the excellent climate —suited
for pasture lands—and the shill of her flock-masters are
important factors in bringing about the result. But
the sources from which the original Victorian merino
flocks were derived, show their pedigree to be of the very
highest character. It is fortunate for the present wool-
growers of the colony that the pioneers of the pastoral
interest in the older colonies of Australia had a sufficient
combination of skill and capital to secure the finest breeds
of sheep. The first persons to introduce sheep into
Victoria were the Messrs. Henty, who were also the first
settlers in the colony, and the merino sheep which they
brought with them were of the premier class. The flock
was formed in England towards the end of the last
century, with pure merinos obtained from the flock of the
king, George 111. Mr. Henty’s sheep took the first prize
wherever he exhibited them in England, till he was
ultimately debarred from competition, owing to the
unchallenged superiority of his sheep, compared with
those of any other flock in Great Britain. It was a
portion of this flock that was first shipped to Western
Australia in 1829 in charge of Mr. Henty’s two sons ; but
as the sheep did not thrive there they were transferred to
Tasmania, where the sons were joined by their father
with the rest of the flock. Disappointed in reference to
a promised grant of land from the Government of the


latter colony, the Hentys sailed for the mainland of
Australia, and took up their residence at Portland Bay,
Victoria, Through bad management and neglect the
flock itself has been entirely dispersed and lost, but sheep
from it have been used in many of the most famous studs
of the colony.
The Van Diemen’s Land Company formed a second
source from which the early colonists of Victoria obtained
merino sheep. Opportunities of buying were afforded at
the annual sales of the company, which imported all
•descriptions of stock into Tasmania, and in a single year
they expended <£30,000 in the purchase of merino sheep
from the best flocks in Germany. A number of private
individuals in those days imported Saxon merinos, and of
their produce a fair share of the best specimens found
their way into the infant colony of Port Phillip. Captain
MacArthur in 1797 imported a few merinos from the
Cape of Good Hope —the first merino sheep imported into
Australia. The flock thus established was crossed by a
few rams bought by Captain MacArthur from the stud
of George 111. Since that time the flock has remained
without any addition of foreign blood. In distinction
from the flock of the Hentys, that of MacArthur has
been preserved, having passed into the ownership of the
Hon. William Campbell, of Victoria, and it has mate-
rially contributed to sustain the high pastoral standing
of the colony. In a few studs, French sheep from
the Eambouillet flock have been made use of, and,
in one or two other cases, American merinos from
Vermont have been introduced; but the pedigree prized
above all others in Victoria is the Saxon merino, and
-the pure descendants of that breed still take the very
.highest rank.


The merino is the sheep invariably bred on large
pastoral properties, situated in the warmer and drier
portions of the colony. On the other hand, in parts
where the rainfall is above the average, the long-wool is
the sheep favoured by farmers. Of long-woolled breeds
the Lincoln is that most approved. In districts heavily
grassed and moist, near the southern coast, there are
many flocks of long-wools kept, some of the Lincolns
comparing favourably with any of the breed imported
from England, in weight, lustre, quality of fleece, and
size of animal. Leicesters, which received attention for a
time, are now being merged in Lincoln flocks. The
Eomney Marsh sheep are reared in a few cold and wet
localities, but their numbers are trifling in comparison
with merinos and Lincolns. One or two small flocks of
Cotswolds and Southdowns are bred in Victoria; but,
although they cannot be regarded as unprofitable, they
have never won the unqualified admiration of Victorian
flockmasters.
As irrigation districts multiply, and it is fully ascer-
tained, by experiment, in what way fodder for sheep can
be grown and stored against a bad season, it may be hoped
that multitudes of flocks, which now perish from drought
and its consequences, will be preserved. There are indi-
cations that the question, as to how provision can best
be made for the contingency referred to, is beginning,
seriously to occupy the attention of sheep-owners. Of
course, it is farmers having facilities for growing the
required crops on an adequate scale that will prove most
successful in this enterprise. Indeed, already fully one-
half of the wool, and the greater part of the fat sheep sold
in the Melbourne market, come from agriculturists who
are small flock-owners. The quality of their wool ia


steadily improving, and their consignments are eagerly
sought after by stock-agents. Lamb breeding for the
markets will probably be monopolised, as time goes on, by
the small sheep-owners. Sheep-farming is a profitable
industry in all countries, but it is in Victoria that sheep
give the highest return for the capital expended. Land
that can support a sheep per acre in its natural state can
be bought at from <£3 to =£3 10s. per acre, and where sheep
grazing is united with agriculture, the former can hardly
fail to prosper. The greater proportion of the lands
suitable for sheep-husbandry are now alienated from the
Crown, but land for this purpose can be purchased from
private owners in almost any part of the country at
reasonable prices.
It will greatly assist a visitor to Melbourne in forming
an idea of the magnitude of the wool trade in Victoria,
to inspect the enormous warehouses erected expressly
to accommodate the storage of wool in the interval
between its arrival and its shipment. The magnificent
structure of Messrs. Goldsbrough & Co., which is of
immense length, has five flats, and a storage capacity of
64,212 tons measurement, the collective area of the floors
being 5*61 acres. It is built of solid bluestone, with
walls that appear impregnable. The cost of the land
and buildings was <£167,000. The New Zealand Loan
and Mercantile Agency Company occupy exceedingly
handsome warehouses built for a similar object, at a
cost, exclusive of the land, of .£95,000. The Australian
Mortgage and Agency Company have an extensive wool
warehouse, also in the heart of Melbourne, capable of
storing large quantities of wool. The premises of Messrs.
Monckton D. Synnot Brothers are also of considerable
dimensions. But the wool trade of Victoria, great as it is, is


destined yet to attain much more gigantic proportions. A
scheme was proposed when the European wool market was
so heavily depressed in 1886, to form a Victorian syndi-
cate for the purpose of taking over the woollen mills
belonging to the Government in Japan, and erecting
others in that country and in China, to supply the markets
of the world with woollen cloth made from Australian
wool. The cheapness, ingenuity and extended hours of
Japanese and Chinese labour formed a prominent consi-
deration in connection with the scheme, and, had it been
carried out, as was confidently anticipated at the period
mentioned, there is little doubt that a revolution would
have been effected, not only in woollen, but gradually
in cotton manufactures. But before that scheme had
reached maturity, the prices of the raw material rose in
the English market, and the squatters who had promised
to co-operate decided to withdraw, the undertaking col-
lapsing in consequence. At the same time, it is by no
means improbable that when the evil day next temporarily
overtakes the pastoral interest in Victoria, the scheme may
be revived. Meanwhile, it is reported that the Japanese
themselves are moving in the matter, and have sent over
representatives to cultivate wool in Victoria for their
market.


CHAPTER YIII.
Commerce and Finance.
Imports and Exports. —The latest period for which
the imports and exports of the colony have been
published is 1886, in which year the total declared
value of imports amounted to <£18,530,575, and of exports
to <£11,795,321. The excess of imports over exports is
thus shown to be £6,735,254, the total of the external
trade in both departments being £30,325,896. The value
of imports was higher in 1886 than in 1885 by <£485,971,
or by about three per cent,; but, as compared with the
year last named, the value of exports experienced a
falling-off, amounting to .£3,756,437. Of this decrease
about nine-tenths were spread over thirty-nine articles of
home produce or manufacture; but, on the other hand,
there was an increase of <£172,306 spread over sixteen
articles of home produce. The decrease in the exports
of 1886, as compared with those of 1885, was most
prominent in four articles, viz., gold specie, <£2,345,344 ;
sheep, <£324,917; wheat, £242,277 ; and wool, <£121,879,
The suspension of the frozen meat shipments to England,
and the low prices of wheat and wool, account for the
export decline in three of these commodities, and the
large diminution in the amount of gold specie is satis-
factorily explained. In the twelve months now under
notice there was an unusually large amount of money


remitted by bank drafts and bills from the parent country
to Victoria for investment, and the gold was retained in
Victoria, and drawn against by remittances in the manner
described, a simple exchange operation found to be more
profitable by the banks than sending the specie to
Europe. The imports of 1886, judged by their values,
were higher than in any other year since the colony was
founded, with the exception of 1884 and 1882. The
great expansion of population, however, which took place
in 1886 is apparent from the fact that, notwithstanding
the exceptionally high total of imports, the value of these
per head of the population was lower than in any of the
last fourteen years, except 1879 and 1880, and also lower
than in most previous years. The colony being under the
somewhat sudden necessity of supplying the wants of an
unusually large number of new comers with agricultural
and pastoral produce, had, as might naturally be expected,
a proportionately smaller surplus left for export.
The following table from Hay ter’s Year Booh, shows
the position of Victoria among the colonies as regards the
total value of imports and exports in 1885, and in the
eleven years 1875 to 1885.

In comparing the trade of New South Wales with that
of Victoria, it should be noted that the import and export
returns of the latter include each year a considerable
value in wool brought to Melbourne from the neigh-


bouring colonies as a convenient port of shipment. In
proof of the marvellous strides made by the collective
external trade of Australasia, it may be stated that it now
exceeds that of the United Kingdom at the time of the
Queen’s accession. During the years 1837-40 the total
external trade of the parent country averaged .£115,000,000
per annum, against <£117,000,000, which was the average
united trade of the Australasian colonies during the years
1883-85, the latest period to which the Government statist
has brought down the calculation. It need hardly be
remarked that the trade which the colonies carry on with
each other is included in this total, as well as with
countries outside the Australasian colonies, the result being
that the same merchandise is necessarily reckoned in the
returns of more than one colony in all cases in which
intercolonial trade is carried on. The aggregate inter-
colonial trade of the Australasian colonies in 1885,
according to the returns of each, was .£42,601,533 ; and
it is generally believed that if only intercolonial tariff
barriers were entirely removed by the establishment of a
federal Government and federal Parliament, combined with
a Customs union, and uniform duties on imports from the
outside world, an impulse would be given to intercolonial
trade by which it would soon be increased fourfold. The
total value of the external trade of the Australasian
colonies, taken as a whole, while less than that of the
United Kingdom and India, is much larger than the
external trade of any other possession. In an estimate
which has been published of “Inter-British Imperial
trade,” i. e., mutual trade between the United Kingdom
and her possessions, and that carried on by the various
sections of the empire with each other, Victoria stands
nearly equal to Kew South Wales, is fifty per cent, in


advance of Canada, and beats tbe record of every other
British possession, except India. The value of imports per
head in Victoria is nearly twice as large, and the value of
exports per head is more than twice as large, as in the
United Kingdom.
Mr. Hayter affirms that, “ omitting the small colonies
of Malta and the Falkland Islands, the value per head of
Victorian imports and exports is greater than that of the
imports and exports of any British colony outside of
Australasia, except the Straits Settlements. The external
commerce of Victoria is much larger than that of
Denmark, Greece, Portugal, or Eoumania,” and it may
be added that, taken per head of the population, it is
nearly as large as that of Belgium, which has almost six
times the number of inhabitants contained in Victoria.
The proportion which the Victorian productions exported
bear to the whole, ranges, from seventy-seven to about
eighty-two per cent.
The principal imports comprise wool, chiefly from
New South Wales, for transhipment, sheep and horned
cattle overland, hardware, woollen, cotton and silk
fabrics, railway plant, galvanised iron, gold and silver
bullion and specie, coal, timber, tea, tobacco, leather,
boots and shoes, sugar (raw and refined), spirits,
fruit, preserved fish, haberdashery, drugs and chemi-
cals, machinery, books and stationery, and pianofortes.
The leading articles exported are wool, woollen and
cotton fabrics, gold, books and stationery, hats and
caps, hosiery, preserved fish, flour, raw and refined
sugar, spirits, leather, hay and chaff, paper, timber, oils,
coal, chinaware, earthenware and glass, iron, railway
plant and various manufactures of metal, horned cattle,
and ordnance stores. It will be readily observed that a


considerable portion of the export trade consists of com-
modifies received from abroad and re-exported. At the
same time an analysis of the Customs’ returns shows
Victoria to rank above every other colony of Australasia
in the value of the indigenous produce exported except
New South Wales, whose much greater extent of territory
enables the latter to raise a very large quantity of wool
and other pastoral produce, which is only partially coun-
terbalanced by the extensive quantities of grain and gold
produced in Victoria. Yet the difference in favour of New
South Wales in 1885 was only half a million sterling. In
1886, as regards value, nearly half the Victorian imports
were from the United Kingdom, and more than half the
exports were consigned to that country. In the same year
the imports from the United Kingdom amounted to
.£8,851,801, and the exports to that destination <£6,566,118.
The imports from New South Wales reached £4,360,871,
and the exports to that colony £2,624,713.
Shipping. —The rapid expansion of Victorian commerce
is apparent in the circumstance that, although the popu-
lation of the colony increased by less than one-half during
the sixteen years ending 1886, the tonnage of vessels
entered and cleared at the close, as compared with the
commencement of that interval, increased nearly three-
fold. It is also noteworthy that while the population in
the six years ending 1886 increased only 19 per cent., the
tonnage in 1886 as compared with 1880 increased 55 per
cent. Statistics show that the tonnage of vessels trading
to Victoria exceeds that to any British possession outside
Australasia except the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, Malta,
India, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, Kong Kong, and
Canada. The aggregate tonnage in 1886, both inwards
and outwards, exceeded considerably that of any previous

A comparison of the returns for the three periods
specified shows a marked expansion of banking business.
The advances in 1886 exceeded the deposits by 1| millions
in 1881, while the excess of advances over deposits as com-
pared with 1885 was millions, and in 1887 the excess
over 1886 was about the same amount. The capital of the
banks was larger in 1887 than at any former period, while
the reserve was higher at the last-named period than in
1881 by about 2| millions sterling, and higher than in
1886 by more than half a million. The average rate of
dividend in 1887 was higher than in 1881, the rate varying
in the case of different banks from 7to percent. The
rate of discount on bills at two to three months, which in
1881 ranged from 5 to 8 per cent., ruled in 1886 and 1887
at from 6to 9 per cent.; and for overdrafts the average
bank rate was 9 per cent. But these rates have not been
generally maintained in 1888, in consequence of the excep-
tional influx of capital from Europe during the past 12
months. The rates of interest allowed on moneys depo-
sited with the leading Victorian banks for a period of
12 months have ruled at about 6 per cent, per annum.
In 1887 there was a reaction from the cause which has
been mentioned, the deposit rate having fallen from 6 to 4
per cent, at which latter figure it remained in June, 1888.


Sayings Banks.— The number of savings banks con-
nected with the Post Office in 1886 was 264, the number
of depositors 78,328, with a total of <£1,266,957 remaining
on deposit. In the same year there were 16 general
savings banks having 111,031 depositors, having £2,322,959
remaining on deposit. The aggregate represents 279 savings
banks, 189,359 depositors with a total of £3,589,916
remaining on deposit, being an average of £lB 19s. 2d.
to each depositor. It appears that Melbourne and its
suburbs contain 621 per cent, of the total depositors in
the Victorian savings banks, and 61 per cent, of the total
deposits is held in the metropolis and its immediate neigh-
bourhood. It is no inconsiderable evidence of the thrift
prevailing in the wage-earning portion of the community
that in the 15 years between 1872 and 1886 the number of
depositors in savings banks has increased two and a half
times. For several years previous to 1880 the amount
standing to the credit of the depositors had been almost
stationary, but in subsequent years a steady increase has
taken place, and in 1886 it had risen to upwards of 3£
millions, or more than twice the amount six years pre-
viously. In 1886, as compared with 1885, there was an
increase of 18,665 in the number of depositors of sums
under £IOO, depositors of £IOO and upwards having
increased only by 678. The savings banks have always
paid interest at 4 per cent., which is the highest rate they
are permitted by statute to give. The number of male
depositors in the year last referred to was 61,550 against
49,481 females. The moneys deposited with the Post
Office savings banks are placed to the credit of a trust
fund, part of which is invested in Government debentures
and stock, and part deposited with the banks. The
general savings banks’ deposits are invested in loans on


mortgage or in Government debentures and stock, or are
deposited with the banks. In proportion to population
the number of depositors is greatest in Victoria of all the
Australasian colonies.
Building Societies. —Another proof that the spirit of
thrift prevails in the colony is the multitude of building
societies which exist and apparently flourish. At the close
of 1886 the number was 60, and since that date many
more have been added, all of them being established
within the last 25 years. These institutions are utilised
by the less opulent of the community for two purposes.
A large section of those practically interested in them
obtain advances by which they are enabled to buy land
and erect houses in a country which offers special facilities
to small freeholders, the loans being repaid by instalments
at short intervals until the ground and dwellings are com-
pletely redeemed ; others deposit their earnings with these
institutions for fixed periods at 5 to 6£ per cent. Against
•a total of 19,907 investing members in these sixty societies
there were in the year under notice 16,250 borrowers,
chiefly on security of houses and land of the class indi-
cated above. The amount of paid-up capital supplied by
the proprietaries, as a whole, was <£2,502,799, and the
amount to the credit of depositors and current accounts
was £2,910,791. Advances made during the 12 months,
subject to periodical repayments by fixed instalments,
reached £2,358,728 —an amount, it will be noticed, which
is considerably under the total of the paid-up proprietors’
capital on the one hand, and still more below the aggre-
gate amount of deposits and current balances to credit on
the other. Subscriptions on investing shares received
during the year amounted to £318,044, and the repay-
ments of loans in the same period was £1,526,220. The


value of landed property held by the societies in fee simple
was .£391,698, a portion of which, it is fair to assume,
came into their hands owing to the stoppage of periodical
repayments. The collective amount of bank overdraft to-
the debit of the sixty institutions was £262,191, and the
aggregate working expenses for the year was £62,369, the
latter item being little over £I,OOO for the cost of manage-
ment for each society.
Public Ebvenue. The amount of Government
revenue collected during the 12 months 1887-8, was
£7,607,753, which shows an increase of £873,928 on the
total figures for the year immediately preceding, and
£761,047 above the budget estimate for the former
period. There was an increase of nearly £288,142 in
the income from railways, and the Customs Department
collected upwards of £220,689 more than in the year
1886-7. The annual public income above specified is the
largest as yet received in the history of the colony.
Openings for Investment of Capital from Abroad.
—lt may be affirmed, without the smallest exaggeration,
that no country in the world at present affords scope so
encouraging for the investment of European capital, with
or without the residence of investors. There are many
existing branches of industry and commerce which admit
of indefinite expansion, and it is absolutely certain that
the Centennial International Exhibition will materially
contribute to multiply channels for Victorian trade, and
lead to an exchange of products with countries which have
hitherto participated but little in the commerce of the
colony. Since the Exhibition of 1880-1, Germany has-
established a great and growing trade with this part of
the world. Austria and her Teutonic neighbour, which
have both been accustomed to purchase merino and long-


combed wool in the London market, are expected, ere
long, to found agencies in Melbourne for buying these
products and sending them direct to German and Austrian
ports. In exchange for the rice, tea, and sauces received
from India, the colony gradually develops a profitable
export business in remounts for the Indian cavalry service,
and many other productions will yet be transmitted from
this side to the Indian peninsula.
Enough has been stated in another chapter in reference
to the favourable attitude of the markets of England and
France towards Victorian wines to stimulate their manu-
facture on a vastly more extended scale than has yet been
attempted. Private and joint stock capital, prudently
invested in the establishment of vineyards, cannot to
produce, in a few years, handsome returns. The culture,
also, of table grapes for export to Europe is a department
of horticulture which has, as yet, hardly come into exist-
ence, notwithstanding that it contains the latent germs of
thousands of fortunes. The aid of science may require
to be called in for the purpose of teaching viticulturists
the art of effectively packing grapes, which is brought to
perfection in Southern Spain; and more precise attention
will be necessary in regulating temperature in the cool
chambers of the steamers plying between Australia and
Europe, where a cargo of a nature so perishable is con-
cerned. But these questions of detail are sure to be
satisfactorily arranged in due time. Not less hopeful
prospects await the expansion of the export of hard fruit,
raisins, oranges and olives. Our consignments of these
varieties to Europe will arrive at a season of the year
when the home market is bare of supplies. The trial
shipments already made of apples and pears to the United
Kingdom from New South Wales and Tasmania, as well


as from Victoria, demonstrate that, with increased skill
and care, the difficulties surrounding the problem of how
to land such perishable produce in sound condition at
English ports will entirely disappear.
Reference has been made to the unlimited demand
which exists in Great Britain for butter and cheese, which
Victoria is in so excellent a position for manufacturing
and supplying advantageously. Here, too, is a compara-
tively unexplored mine of wealth, the extent of which
cannot be fully known until the butter and cheese fac-
tories largely in operation in the United States and
Canada are widely introduced in Victoria.
It is to be regretted that the tentative efforts previously
made to export dead meat to Europe have not proved
financially successful; but the day is not far distant when
attempts will be renewed, under remunerative conditions,
to export preserved as well as dead meat.
Although gold-mining is an industry too firmly estab-
lished in the colony ever to be neglected, its precarious
character precludes advice being given in favour of the
indiscriminate investment of British capital in Victorian
mines; but eminently satisfactory results will assuredly
reward the enterprise of those having means and energy
sufficient to undertake the development of our fisheries on
an adequate scale for colonial supply, employing their own
nets and boats, conveying the fish to a central market
under their own control, and adopting the Roosen process
for preserving without salting the fish until they can be
profitably disposed of.
The extent to which British capital is already safely
and remuneratively invested in land in Victoria abun-
dantly proves the confidence felt in the rapid growth
of its population, its manufactures, its agriculture, its


pastoral resources, and its commerce. Existing land
mortgage companies and private agents are respectively
employed as mediums by British investors. But the
absorbing power of the colony can be fully realised only
by a lengthened residence in it. It must always be borne
in mind that Melbourne is the most wealthy, enterprising
and populous city in the whole of Australasia, and from
its splendid climate and central maritime position on the
southern coast, is destined not only to become immea-
surably larger as the capital of Yictoria, but, sooner or
later, also, as the commercial capital of a federated
Australia. It is this double consideration which explains
the growing value of land in Melbourne and its beautiful
suburbs. Interest on money lent upon sound land mort-
gage at to per cent, can readily be obtained. The
following table shows the number and amount of mort-
gages on land in 1886, and it is unquestionable that the
figures have grown much larger since

CHAPTER IX.
Development of Manufactures.
* j |-*S a manufacturing country Victoria occupies a
f"| superior position to that of any other colony
of the Australasian group, a circumstance
which is in a large measure ascribed by many to her pro-
tective tariff. The grinding of corn was naturally one of
the earliest industries established in the colony, and it
has increased with the growth of agriculture. The
number of mills in operation in the colony at the end
of last year was 120. Of these 112 employed steam
power, and the remainder water power. The number of
hands employed was 743, and the tons of flour made
163,015. The machinery and plant in use were valued at
.£240,400, and the buildings at <£163,810. The brewing
industry has always been a prosperous one in the colony.
The number of breweries in operation last year was 72.
The beer made amounted to 16,088,462 gallons, the
machinery and plant in use were valued at .£140,170,
and the buildings at .£212,135. The quantity of beer
imported, after deducting exports, was 1,135,263 gallons.
These numbers give a total consumption of 17,223,697
gallons, or an average of 17| gallons per head. There
d 2


were in operation, in 1887, 226 brickyards and potteries,
with 58 machines worked by steam power, and 103 by
horses, the number of hands employed being 2,271. The
bricks made were valued at =£349,960, the pottery at
=£45,400, the machinery and plant at .£185,369, and the
buildings at =£133,995. The number of tanneries, fell-
mongeries, and wool-washing establishments was 140,
employing 1,546 hands, with steam engines of 773 horse
power. The number of hides and skins tanned was
1,753,473; the number of skins stripped of wool,
1,923,009, and other wool washed, 10,497,303 lbs,; the
machinery and plant were valued at £106,420, and the
buildings at £134,008. There were 8 woollen mills in
1887, employing steam engines of 866 horse power. The
quantity of wool used was 1,651,458 lbs.; and the goods
manufactured were 995,026 yards of tweed, cloth, flannel,
&c., 2,507 pairs of blankets, and 228 shawls. The
hands employed were 387 males, and 317 females. The
machinery and plant were valued at £146,036, and the
buildings at £63,300. The number of soap and candle
works in 1887 was 34, employing 408 hands. The soap
made amounted to 130,609 cwt., and the candles to
46,714 cwt.; the machinery and plant were valued at
£73,358, and the buildings at £36,720. The tobacco
manufactories numbered 11, employing 460 males and
196 females. The tobacco manufactured amounted to
1,181,283 lbs.; the snuff to 2,365 lbs.; and the number
of cigars to 7,293,460. The machinery and plant were
valued at £31,225, and the buildings at £20,515. The
number of distilleries was 8, employing 56 hands. The
spirits made amounted to 239,444 gallons; the machinery
and plant were valued at £29,050, and the buildings at
£24,075. There were manufactories, works, &c., exclu-


sive of those already named, to the number of 2,151,
employing 32,545 males, and 5,807 females, with
machinery and plant valued at <£3,834,829, and buildings
valued at <£2,267,434, There were 155 stone quarries in
work, employing 1,458 hands. The stone raised was
valued at <£167,210 ; the machinery and plant at <£52,119,
and the buildings at <£8,705.
The manufacturing establishments of all kinds, respect-
ing which returns are obtained, are named in the following
table, and their numbers are given for 1880-81 and 1886-7.
For the former, which was the census year, are also given
the approximate values of the materials used, and articles
produced, and for the latter the number of hands
employed, and the approximate value of lands, buildings,
machinery, and plant. The establishments are for the
most part of an extensive character, the only exception
being in cases where the existence of industries of an
unusual or interesting nature might seem to call for
notice. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops,
although some manufacturing industry may be carried on
thereat. Were this done, the “ manufactories” in the
colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite
extent. It is customary to note all establishments where
machinery, worked by steam, gas, water, wind, or horse
power is used. It is believed that a different system
prevails in some of the neighbouring colonies, and that
particulars of many establishments which, in Victoria,
would not be considered worthy of notice, find place in
their returns.

Vital Statistics. —Marriages in Victoria numbered
7,737 in 1886, or 342 more than in the previous
year. In 1887 there was a further numerical
advance to 7,768. The annual marriage rate was thus
7‘84 per 1,000 of the population in the former year and
7‘62 in the latter. The proportion which the number of
marriages bears to the total population is generally called
the marriage rate. This for many years has been declin-
ing in Victoria, for, whilst in the three years prior to 1863
it was above 8 per 1,000 of both sexes and all ages, from
1863 to 1865 it was between 7 and 8, and between 1868
and 1878 it was between 6 and 7 per 1,000. It reached its
lowest point, 5‘90 per 1,000, in 1879, and then gradually
revived, and in 1886 mounted to 7 - 84, the highest rate
which has prevailed during the last twenty-four years.
Births in 1886 numbered 30,824, or 3P23 per 1,000 of
the population, and in 1887, 33,043 or 32'40. During


STATISTICS.
the twenty years ending 1883, the number of births in
Victoria had remained almost stationary ; but in 1884 a
marked increase took place, which was more than sus-
tained in 1885, 1886, and 1887, the'number of births in
the latter being the highest ever recorded. In proportion
to population, however, the births decreased steadily for a
number of years.
The death rate in 1886 was 15T7 per 1,000 of the
population. Over a period of twenty-six years the deaths
of males per 1,000 of the same sex living exceeded by 2|
the deaths of females per 1,000 of that sex living. It has
been held by high authority that in countries in which
the climate is healthy, hygiene properly attended to, and
the population in a normal condition as regards age, the
ordinary mortality incident to population would probably
cause the death rate to be in the proportion of about 17
per 1,000 persons living. During the past twenty-six
years in Victoria the mortality exceeded 17 per 1,000
seven times, but over the whole period it has averaged
below 16 per 1,000. In the last ten years it has never
been so high as 16 per 1,000, whilst in six of those years
it was below 15 per 1,000, in one of them being even
below 14 per 1,000. In 1887 the death rate was 1570 per
1,000.
The net increase of population in Victoria in 1887, as
compared with 1886, was estimated at 83,075, as against
40,953 in New South Wales. The computed total popula-
tion of Victoria at the close of 1887 was 1,036,119, as
compared with 1,003,013 in 1886. The number of males
is set down at 550,050, and females at 486,060. On the
31st March, 1888, the estimated population was 1,047,308,
showing an increase in the first quarter of the present
year of 11,189, 6,946 being males, and 4,243 females.


Education. —The State educational system of Victoria
has been most successful in its operation. The foundation
of it is, that secular instruction shall be provided without
payment for children whose parents may be willing to
accept it, but that, whether accepted or not, satisfactory
evidence must be produced that all children are educated
up to a given standard. For securing the object sought, it
is believed that the system compares favourably with that
of any other country in the world. The number of children
returned as on the rolls of State schools in 1886, after the
system had been in force for thirteen years, was 230,576,
and 1,870 schools were open. The parents of children
between the ages of six and fifteen are obliged by the
“Education Act” to cause them to attend school for at
least sixty days in each half-year, unless there is some
valid reason to prevent them from so doing. The total
expenditure on public instruction in 1886-7 was <£659,553,
of which only £3,549 was paid by parents. Besides the
State schools, which are attended by five-sixths of the
children under instruction in the colony, there are,
according to the latest returns, 691 private schools,
attended by 35,811 scholars. Some of these private
schools are attached to religious denominations, as many
as 175, with 20,854 scholars, being connected with the
Roman Catholic Church. Six are called colleges or
grammar schools, two of which are connected with the
Church of England, two with the Roman Catholic, one
with the Presbyterian, and one with the Wesleyan Church.
In these, as well as in some o f the other private schools.
a very high class of education, quite equal to that
obtained in the best public schools in England, is given.
The Melbourne University was established under a
special Act of the Victorian Legislature, which was


assented to on the 22nd January, 1853. This Act, as
amended by an Act passed in 1881, provides for its
endowment by the payment of .£9,000 annually out of the
general revenue—recently increased by Parliament to
<£11,000; also, that no religious test shall be required of
any one to entitle him to be admitted to the rights and
privileges of the institution; also for the election, by the
senate, of a council consisting of twenty members, to hold
office for five years, of whom not more than three may be
members of the teaching staff, and for the election by
them, out of their own body, of a chancellor and a vice-
chancellor; also for the constitution of a senate, con-
sisting of all male persons who have been admitted to the
degree of master or doctor, and for the election by them
annually of one of their body as warden, as soon as the
superior degrees should amount to not less than one
hundred. This number was reached in 1867, and the
senate was constituted on the 14th of June of that year.
The council are empowered to grant in any faculty, except
divinity, any degree, diploma, certificate, or license which
can be conferred in any university in the British
dominions. Royal letters patent, under the sign-manual
of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, were issued on the
14th March, 1869, declaring that all degrees granted, or
thereafter to be granted, by the Melbourne University
should be recognised as academic distinctions and rewards
of merit, and should be entitled to rank, precedence, and
consideration in the United Kingdom and in British
colonies and possessions throughout the world, just as
fully as if they had been granted by any university in the
United Kingdom. The foundation stone was laid on the
3rd July, 1854, and the building was opened on the
3rd October of the following year. On the 22nd March,


1880, the University was thrown open to females, and
they can now be admitted to all its corporate privileges
except as regards the study of medicine. Affiliated to the
University is a college in connection with the Church of
England, and one in connection with the Presbyterian
Church, and a third is in course of being associated
with the central seat of learning belonging to the
Wesleyan body. The Presbyterian institution is called
the Ormond College, after the Hon. Francis Ormond,
M.L.C., who has given nearly =£25,000 towards its erection
and endowment. The University Hall, built at a cost of
about =£40,000, is called the Wilson Hall, after Sir Samuel
Wilson, who contributed the greater portion of the funds
for its erection. Since the opening of the University, until
1886, 2,395 students had matriculated, and 1,169 degrees
were granted, of which 877 were direct, and 292 ad eundem.
The students who matriculated in 1886 numbered 164, of
whom 18 were females, and the graduates in the same
year numbered 124; 249 males and 123 females having
passed the matriculation examination.
.Railways. —All the railways in Victoria are the pro-
perty of the State, whose policy it has been to open up
the interior by their means to such an extent that railway
communication will keep pace with settlement, be the
latter ever so rapid. The consequence is that railways are
extending to the most remote parts of the colony. Cheap
excursion trains are run weekly, as well as at all holiday
seasons, the tickets of the former being available from
Friday until Monday, and those of the latter for much
longer periods. In June, 1887, 1,880 miles were open for
traffic, 236| miles of which were laid with double lines.
The cost of construction, inclusive of rolling-stock, and
building a bridge over the Murray to connect with the Hew


South Wales lines, was over <£25,000,000, or an average of
about <£13,000 per mile. The train mileage during the year
was 7,991,878. The total receipts amounted to <£1,026,962,
and the working expenses to <£1,427,116. The net income
was equivalent to a return of 4T70 per cent, on the whole
capital cost, which shows a substantial surplus, after
paying the interest due on the bonds representing the
capital expended on the lines. The nominal rate of inte-
rest payable on the borrowed capital now averages 4'25
per cent., or £4 6s. per <£loo. Formerly, the rate was as
high as 4| per cent,, but, owing to the redemption of 6 per
cent, debentures and the issue during the years 1883 to
1885 of 4 per cent, debentures in lieu thereof, a reduction
of <£158,292, upon a total of £482,677, was effected in
the annual interest payable.
Post Offices. —A very efficient postal system exists in
Victoria, and post offices are established throughout the
length and breadth of the colony; 1,429 of such institu-
tions now exist, as against 1,007 eight years since. In the
same period the letters and newspapers despatched and
received in a year increased from 33,000,000 to 55,800,000.
The postage on letters to places in any of the Australasian
colonies is 2d. per ounce, and on newspapers one halfpenny
each. The postage on letters to the United Kingdom is
6d., and on newspapers Id. Money order offices in Victoria
in connection with the post office have been established in
362 places, and the system is being rapidly extended by
the opening of fresh offices. Besides the issue and pay-
ment of money orders at these places, such orders are
issued in favour of Victoria, and Victorian orders are
paid, at places in Great Britain and Ireland, and in the
various Australasian colonies; also in the United States
and Canada; Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and some of


the other European countries; Ceylon, India, Straits
Settlements, China (including Macao), Japan, the Cape
of Good Hope, etc. Postal notes are also issued, for use
within the colony, for any amounts not exceeding =£l, at
charges ranging from |d. to 3d.
Telegraphs. —Telegraphs in Victoria are Government
property, and are worked in connection with the Post
Office. Telegraphic communication exists between 420
stations within the colony, and the Victorian lines are
connected besides with the lines of New South Wales,
and by means of them with Queensland and New Zealand.
They are also connected with the lines of South Australia,
and by their means with Western Australia, and with
the Eastern Archipelago, Asia, Europe and America.
They are likewise united with a submarine cable to Tas-
mania. In 1886 the miles of line along which poles
extended numbered 4,094, and the miles of wire 10,111.
A considerable extension of the lines, as well as an increase
of business, takes place each year. To places within Vic-
toria, telegrams containing not more than six words are
sent for 6d., Id. extra being charged for each additional
word. To New South Wales the charge is Is. for ten
words; to South Australia and Tasmania, 25.; and to
Western Australia and Queensland, 3s. To New Zealand
ten words are sent for 7s. 6d., each additional word being
charged lOd. To England or the continent of Europe,
the rate is 10s. Bd. per word; to India it varies from
7s. lid. to Bs. 4d.; and to the United States, from
12s. 4d. to 13s. lOd. In the case of telegrams to places
on the Australian continent, names and addresses are not
charged for; to places in Tasmania they are not charged
for unless they exceed ten words, but all words above that
number are charged for as part of the message. In the


iase of telegrams to New Zealand, England, the continent
of Europe, India, and the United States, the names and
addresses of both sender and receiver are charged for as
part of the message.
Religious Statistics. —There being no State religion
in Victoria, and no money voted for any religious object,
the clergy are supported by the efforts of the denomina-
tion to which they are attached. The clergy of the Church
of England, with ministers of other bodies, number 1,083,
of whom 201 belong to the Church of England, 203 to the
Presbyterians, 200 to the Methodists, 129 to the Roman
Catholics, 129 to the Salvation Army, 38 to the Bible
Christians, 54 to the Independents, 47 to the Baptists, 14
to the Evangelical Lutherans, 5 to the Welsh Calvinists,
21 to the Church of Christ, 2 to the Society of Friends, 3
to the Moravians, 10 to Protestant churches unattached, 1
to the Unitarians, 1 to the Swedenborgians, 16 to the
Catholic Apostolic Church, 1 to the Christian Israelites,
and Bto the Jewish Church. The buildings used for
public worship throughout Victoria number at present
about 4,100, affording accommodation for 552,000 persons.
Cost of Living.— The cost of living in Victoria is
rather under that in the old country, excepting chiefly the
items of house rent, which is high in towns and cities,
servants’ wages, imported clothing and doctors’ fees. In
country districts the cost of groceries, tobacco, wines,
spirits, &c., is naturally somewhat higher than in Mel-
bourne, and that of agricultural and grazing produce,
firewood, &c., somewhat lower than in Melbourne. Prices
in Melbourne are quoted as follows:—Bread, per 41b. loaf,
sd. to 6d.; beef, per lb., 4d. to lOd.; mutton, l|d. to 5d.;
veal, sd. to Bd.; pork, 6d. to 9d.; lamb, per quarter, 2s.
to 3s. 6d.; butter, per lb., Is. to 2s. 6d.; cheese, sd. to


Is.; milk, per quart, sd. to 6d.; flour, .£8 to £ll 15s. per
ton; potatoes, 2s. 6d, to 6s. per cwt.; tea, per lb., Is. 6d.
to 2s. 6d.; coffee, Is. 3d. to Is. 6d.; sugar, to 3d.;
tobacco, 3s. to 65.; soap, 3d. to 4d.; tallow caudles, 4d. to
6d.; sperm candles, 9d. to Is.; coals, 275. to 38s. per ton;
fix*ewood, 10s. to 14s. 6d.; ale and porter, Bs. to 12s. per
dozen; colonial wine, 12s. to 30s. per dozen.
Victoria as a Field fob Settlement. —There is
probably no country in the world that offers such attrac-
tions to the working man as Victoria. There, it is not
unusual for the agricultural labourer, the artisan and the
mechanic to find several masters competing for his ser-
vices, and outbidding each other in order to obtain them.
What is called the eight hours system, founded upon the
division of the day into three parts of eight hours each—
one to be devoted to labour, one to recreation, and one to
rest—has been in existence for the last thirty years, and no
employer would venture to ask his men to work a minute
longer than the recognised time. Wages are so high and
work so constant—the weather being habitually so fine
that there is scarcely any broken time—that an indus-
trious man is often able, not only to maintain his family
in comfort, but by the exercise of economy to lay by as
much as the whole sum of his wages would amount to in
England. Free instruction to his children is provided by
the State, and, as his boys and girls grow up, plenty of
employment offers for them, so that instead of being an
expense they soon bring in money.
To women and girls desirous of engaging in domestic
service, the colony presents even greater attractions.
Wages have been going up steadily for years past, not-
withstanding which it is now difficult to get good servants
at any wages. Besides the satisfaction of obtaining high


remuneration, servants feel that their privileges are greater
and the restrictions placed upon them are fewer than in
England, whilst, from the value placed upon their services
in consequence of the smallness of the supply, they are
naturally treated with a kindness and consideration to
which many of them had been strangers before coming
to Victoria. To professional men, governesses, clerks,
shopmen and shop women, the certainty of remunerative
employment is by no means so absolute as it is to the
operative classes, and great caution should be exercised
by persons in the old country seeking light employment
before deciding to emigrate to Australia. Many succeed
beyond their warmest anticipations, whilst others fail
utterly. Industry, perseverance, and, it may be added,
versatility, will in time conquer many difficulties. The
colony presents a large field for male and female instruc-
tors, but in this there are many competitors. The failures
of society—the dissipated, the drunken, and the idle—had
far better not come to the colony. If they do, they will
assuredly soon fall into destitution. The field for skilled
labour in Victoria has never been better than at present,
for during the past year there has been enormous activity
in the building trade, largely stimulated by the land
“ boom,” and by a great influx of English money, which
is much more profitably invested here than in the Old
World. The rights of the working men are carefully
watched over by the Council of the Trades Hall, which
exerts an important influence in all trade disputes. The
education of the working classes in Melbourne has also
been liberally provided for by the establishment of a
Working Men’s College, handsomely endowed by the
Hon. Francis Ormond, M.L.C.
