AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE.
NOTES
ON THE
MOVEMENT OF TROOPS BY RAIL AND SEA
AND
DISCIPLINE ON BOARD SHIP.
PREFACE.
(i) Members of the Australian Imperial Force are subject to the
Army Act exclusively, during the time they are outside the limits
of Australia.
(ii) These instructions amplify such of the Field Service
Regulations, Commonwealth Military Regulations, and Standing
Orders as apply to the particular circumstances of the Aus-
tralian Imperial Force.
(hi) The various Admiralty forms quoted are those
in use in the British services. When copies of these forms
cannot be made, the necessary information is to be given in
typed or manuscript statements.
DRESS.
(iv) Uniform will be worn on board ship. Canvas deck shoes
may be worn, but not swords or spurs. All ranks will wear belts
on duty. O.C. troops on board ship may make such varia-
tions in dress as are found to be necessary and practicable
in the tropics.
CASUALTIES.
(a) Casualties —other than those on Active Service.
(v) All deaths will be notified (by -telegram or written report,
as the case may necessitate) to Head-Quarters, Australian
Imperial Force, and during the voyage to the Secretary, Depart-
ment of Defence, Melbourne. In these reports (which are in
addition to entries in returns) the date of decease and parti-
culars thereof are to be noted.


If the death takes place on board ship, the O.C. troops on
board will forward these reports immediately on arrival at the
port of destination.
In all cases of deaths or dangerous illness, whether a tele-
gram is sent or not, a letter, written and signed by an officer,
will be sent to the next-of-kin, giving, in addition to the
particulars, all information as to duration of illness and any
other matters likely to be of interest, and directing, when
necessary, that application regarding the effects of the deceased
should be addressed direct to the Secretary, Department
of Defence.
(b) Casualties—on Active Service.
The method of reporting casualties is dealt with in the
Field Service Regulations, Part 11.
(vi) The following instructions adapted from King’s Regulations
are published for the guidance of all concerned.
[The numbers of paragraphs are those of King's Regulations.']
Copies of the Regulations and Forms issued by the Transport
Service are being placed on board each ship by that Service.
RAILWAYS—GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.
1420. Officers in command of troops moving by railway are
responsible that the regulations of the railway companies
are complied with by the troops. They are not to interfere
with the prescribed running of the trains or the general
working of the railway service.
1424. When trained horses are moved, the following conducting
parties are to be detailed :
(i) When any portion of the move is by sea—a corporal,
or private, for every 8 horses, with 1 N.C.O. in
charge of the party.
(ii) When by rail only, if more than 2 truck loads are
moved —-a corporal, or private, for every 2 truck
loads, with 1 N.C.O. in charge of the party.
In other cases, no conducting party should be sent, but
arrangements should be made with the railway company to
water and feed the horses en route.
1430. The entrainment of horses, guns, and vehicles will, if
possible, be conducted simultaneously, and should be completed
before that of the men. has commenced.
1431. The maximum time required in ordinary circumstances
for entraining a half battalion of infantry with its proportion
of regimental transport, may be taken at 40 minutes, and
for a squadron of cavalry or a half battery of artillery 45 to
60 minutes. These times are those of units at war strength and
moving complete.


Entrainment of Mon.
1432. Compartments intended for ten ordinary passengers
are, as a rule, allotted to eight soldiers, with their arms,
accoutrements, and kits.
1433. Previous to entrainment, men, with their valises, kit-bags,
&c., will be told off into sections corresponding with the capacity
of the compartments provided, which should be numbered an
lettered to facilitate the entrainment of squadrons, companies, or
sections.
1434 The entrainment will take place by word of command. It
should'be complete five minutes’ before the time of departure.
1435. The first men to enter compartments will pass to the far
side. Each man will stow away his cloak, kit-bag, &c. Arms
will either be retained by the men, or placed in the racks.
1436. No man is to leave a carriage without permission, except
when ordered by his officers or requested by the railway officials
to do so.
Entrainment of Horses.
1437. Horse boxes carry three horses in each box. Cattle boxes
hold from six to nine horses.
1438. On long journeys under peace conditions saddlery and
harness may be removed, at the discretion of the officer under whose
authority the orders for the movement are issued, with a view to
resting the horses, when this can be arranged without risk of the
animals being separated from their equipment, or of causing delay
in the service of trains.
Under active service conditions, horses will be entrained saddled
or harnessed, unless orders to the contrary are issued. The authority
competent to issue such orders will be the Army Council as regards
movements in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere the Commander-
in-Chief in the field or an Army Commander.
1439. Horses’ heads should be fastened by head ropes to the truck,
whether the horses are harnessed or not, sufficient freedom being
allowed to enable the animals to adapt themselves to the oscilla r
tions of the train. It is immaterial whether the horses heads face
the second line of rail or not.
1440. If watering and feeding are to be carried out on the journey
it is preferable that the horses face the platform, if this can be
arranged, when entraining.
If there are not sufficient horses to fill a truck they should be
closed up to one end and a sliding bar used to secure them.


Entrainment of Guns and Vehicles.
1441. A carriage truck will usually take two pairs of wheels.
Trucks which will take more may be loaded up to the weight the
truck is calculated to bear.
1442. The heaviest weights are to be placed nearest to the ends
of the trucks. Vehicles with limbers are to be unlimbered and
placed with the trail, perch, pole or shafts resting on the floor, and
pointing inwards. Wheels should be well secured with ropes or
scotches.
1443. Guns and wagons when equipped for the march are loaded
in that state, and, when accompanying troops, the unoccupied space
of the floors under and around them must only be used for their gear,
for emergency ramps for detrainment (when carried), and for the
kits of men in charge of the truck.
1444. Wagons, or their parts, must be packed compactly, on the
trucks, but not so as to prevent the wagon being quickly unloaded
from either side of the truck.
1445. In entraining vehicles, end-loading from a dock should be
used where facilities exist, as the ends of the trucks let down, and
the vehicles can be run on in a few minutes.
When there are no facilities for “ end loading,” these trucks should
be avoided.
Trucks having sides that let down come next in point of conveni-
ence.
The Journey.
1447. When the train is ready to proceed “ Fall in ” will be
sounded. Silence must be maintained until the train moves off.
1448. Departure of trains should be telegraphed by the officer
superintending the entrainment to the place where the troops are
to halt for refreshments, and also to the place of final destination.
1449. On arrival at the place appointed for the train to halt, the
officers will get out and go to the carnages of which they are in
charge. Sentries will be posted if necessary. The “ Dismiss ”
will be then be sounded, and men may get out of the train, leaving
their arms in the carriages.
1450. When it is necessary that the troops should be fed or horses
watered en route previous preparations should be made regimentally,
an officer, with one or more N.C.O.’s being, if necessary, sent
orward to make arrangements.


1451. When it is intended to water and feed horses during a halt
Water," followed by “ Feed” will be sounded, and the men
proceed to water their horses from buckets. After being watered
the horses will be fed from nosebags. No hay or straw is to be left
among the horses, and any forage conveyed should be in closed or
tarpaulin-covered wagons.
1452. When it is time to proceed the “ Fall in ” will sound. Men
will return to their carriages, and the officers will see that they are
all present, and report to the C.O. Any sentries that have been
posted will then be withdrawn. Lastly the officers will get in, and
the C.O. will then give directions that the train may proceed.
1453. In case of accident to the train the officers will proceed at
once to the carriages of which they are in charge, and the men will
retain their seats until ordered to descend. Directions given by
railway officials must be promptly executed.
Detrainment.
1454. In detrainments, the O.C. the troops must ensure the speedy
evacuation of the railway station.
1455. Working parties for the laying of temporary ramps will be
ordered to alight and commence work. The officers will proceed to
the carriages of which they are in charge, and point out where the
men are to form up. The men will then get out, taking their arms,
kits, &c., which will be deposited in some convenient place, and will
then fall in opposite the trucks containing their horses.
1456. As they are detrained, riding horses will be led to the place
of assembly, and draught horses to their own wagons.
1457. The detrainment of guns and vehicles will be carried out
by parties told off for the purpose. If it cannot be done simultane-
ously with that of the horses, the latter will, as a rule, be first detrained.
Each carriage should be drawn off to the place of assembly as soon
as horsed, so as to clear the ground.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR EMBARKATION.
1488. Arrangements for the movement, embarkation, and disem-
barkation of troops are under the Quartermaster-General.
Embarkations and disembarkations will take place under the
superintendence of the G.O.C.* at the port, who will detail an officer,
the “ staff officer in charge ”to represent him. All troops, animals,
guns, regimental stores and baggage* will be shipped and landed by
the navyt, whether the shipping or landing takes place alongside
wharfs or piers (either Government or mercantile) or by tugs or
boats. J
* In Australia, the District Commandant.
+ In Australia, under the general superintendence of the navy,
t O.C. troops on board each transport should during the voyage, prepare
orders for disembarkation.

Inspection and Fitting of Ships.
1491. When a ship is engaged for the conveyance of troops, an
inspection of the fittings, sanitary condition and arrangements for
the accommodation, preservation of health and victualling of the
troops will be made prior to the embarkation by a board consisting
of one or more naval officers, the military embarking staff officer
and a military medical Officer. The latter officer will make a careful
inspection of the ships’ crew. The medical officer who is to proceed
in charge should, if practicable, be present also. When troops horses
are embarked, a veterinary officer will accompany the board.
1493. A final inspection will be held as soon as the embarkation
is complete to ascertain whether the arrangements for berthing
troops, stowing baggage, &c., have been carried out. This inspec-
tion will take place at the last port of embarkation, when there is
more than one. Ships passing between stations abroad will undergo
this inspection on each occasion of a change of troops.
1494. The board of final inspection will consist, when practicable,
of one or more naval officers (to be detailed by the naval authorities
at the port), the military embarking staff officer and a military
medical officer not proceeding with the troops. The O.C. troops
embarked, and, when troop horses are carried, a veterinary officer
will accompany the board.
1495. Reports of the above boards will be rendered as laid down
in para. 1506.
1496. Troops, except those on duty, will be seated at their mess
tables before the inspection commences, and remain so seated until
its completion. O’s.C. companies, &c., and drafts will be present,
and will read to their men the orders for fire and boat stations
(copies* of which will be hung up on each troop deck), and report
that they have done so to the board on its arrival at the messes.
1497. The General commanding") - will be responsible, when a hired
vessel is to sail from a port in his command, and the first embarka-
tiin of troops will take place at that port, that the stores, as laid
down in the Regulations for Army Medical Service and in the Equip-
ment are placed on board before the troops embark.
1498. The O.C. troops will be responsible for all stores and equip-
ment, &c., issued, as well as for the method of accounting for and
disposing of the same. (See note to para. 1576.)
• Copies of these orders will be placed on board by the navy,
t In Australia, the District Commandant.
t Special instructions with regard to the medical stores to be taken by
vessels on which the Australian Imperial Force will embark have been issued
by the Director of Medical Services.

in each. The following rules for the appropriation of berths to
individuals will be carried out by the staff officer in charge :—•
(i) The following are alone entitled to separate cabin accommo-
dation :

for any others, and will not give up any of their accom-
modation.
(iii) The appropriation of all other cabins will be made according
to seniority of army rank, or of rank corrresponding
thereto.
(iv) At an intermediate port the appropriation may be altered
so as to give proper accommodation, with reference to
army rank, to officers embarking there; but officers
already on board will be put to as little inconvenience
as possible.
1522. The G.O.C.* at the station will see that preparation is made
for the comfort of the troops. They will remain under his orders
until the ship clears the port. If they are detained, he will either
visit them daily, or order a staff officer to do so.
1523. At all embarkations in transports, visitors will only be
allowed on the jetties and ships at the discretion of the staff officer
in charge, and with the concurrence of the officer representing the
Naval authorities, or in his absence the master of the ship.
The staff officer in charge will as early as possible inform the officer
representing the Naval authorities, or in his absence the master
of the ship, of the hour at which the embarkation is likely to be
completed in all respects, in order that there may be no delay in
leaving harbor.
1524. On the embarkation of troops, in order that rations may
be issued, the C.O. will immediately furnish the master with returns,
in duplicate, on forms which will be handed to him by the master.

charge in some part of the ship free from risk.
Shipment of Baggage.
1529. A C.O. will prepare a statement in detail of the baggage
to be shipped, and send it by post to District Head-quarters for
delivery to the staff officer in charge at the port of embarkation,
so as to be received by the latter the day before the baggage arrives.
Bicycles before shipment should be stripped, that is, the handles
should be placed at right angles to the position they usually occupy,
the pedals removed from cranks, the saddles removed, and the whole
packed in a light framework crate of the smallest dimensions.
The general principle to be observed in the embarkation of stores,
equipment, and baggage is that those articles which will be required
first on disembarkation are embarked last.
1530. Each article will have distinctly painted upon it, in front'
the name, rank, and corps of the owner.
1531. Explosive or combustible articles will be excluded from any
package. Methylated spirit, matches, and fuzees are strictly pro-

practicable, be shipped the day before the troops, or individuals
embark. In the case of a unit, the C.O. will notify to the staff officer
in charge the day and hour at which the baggage may be expected
to arrive. A detachment, with a proportion of officers, and including
as many officers servants as can be spared, will be B ent to the port
to place the baggage on board. r
1538. Before the baggage is put on board, the staff officer, or the
officer i/c baggage party, will inspect the baggage rooms, and having
seen that they are entirely dear, will sign the following certificate*
and deliver it to the master : ’

a party of seamen will be present in the baggage rooms to point out
how the baggage is to be stowed.
1543. When troops embark in a transport, any excess baggage
that the staff officer in charge has been unable to ship in the same
transport will be dealt with under private arrangement to be made
by its owners.

arrival on board, the bedding being drawn on the following scale :
On homeward voyages (including those from India) in ships due
to arrive in England between Ist November and 30th April, an extra
blanket will be issued to each of the above.
On outward voyages commencing between these dates an extra
blanket may be issued at the discretion of the O.C. troops.
1569. The commander of each company, &c., or draft, is to be
present at the first issue of bedding, and will be responsible for
the amount taken over by him. The troops will be mustered with
their bedding as soon as possible, to see that it is complete and that
each has his own bedding.
1570. A list of utensils issued to each mess is printed on the back
of the mess roll. The N.C.O. in charge will check the articles on
arrival at his mess, and sign the receipt portion,which will be given

tative of the master of the ship.*
1571. The places where troops are to fall in for parade will be
settled as soon as possible after embarkation by the C.O. in conjunc-
tion with the master,
1572. A guard of a sufficient number of N.C.O.’s and men will be
detailed to provide all necessary sentries, the requisite number of
sentry posts being determined by the O.C. troops in conjunction with
the master..
The guard will be divided into three reliefs (4 hours on and 8 hours
off duty).

the ship’s officer in clearing away boats, when necessary, at fire and
collision stations. If possible, the party will be permanent, but it
is also available for general duties.
The troops will be exercised in fire and collision stations. Should
this not be possible before sailing, it will be done immediately after-
wards.

and collision stations, &c.
(iii) In the event of an officer who has been appointed to the com-
mand of troops on board ship becoming non-effective, through illness,
or otherwise, the command will devolve on the next senior effective
combatant officer on board, available for duty, j"
1577. When there is a naval transport officer on board, he is the
medium of communication between the C.O. and the master of the
vessel, but he has no direct authority over officers or troops. As
representative of the Naval authorities, his concurrence will be
obtained in all arrangements made, other than those purely military.
The C.O. will assist him in carrying out the duties imposed upon him
by the Instructions for Transport Service.
1578. The C.O. while maintaining discipline among the troops,
will remember that the master of the ship has lawful authority to
maintain order amongst all on board, and to insure the safety of his
ship and passengers, for which he is entirely responsible. In case of
fire or emergency, the C.O. will remember the responsibility of the
master, and render him every assistance, without attempting to take
the command out of his hands.
1579. The C.O. will ascertain from the naval transport officer, or
master, the hours at which they wish to make their daily inspection
of the ship. The C. 0., accompanied by the medical officer in charge,
will, at the same time, inspect all parts of the vessel appropriated to
troops.
* Attention is directed to Army Act, sections 188 and 46; to King’s
Regulations, paragraph 493, et sequitur (corresponding to Commonwealth
Military Regulation 286, et sequitur), and to Field Service Regulations Part II
Chapter XIII.
t The O.C. troops on board each transport will detail the personnel to perform
the following duties during the voyage ;
One Ship’s Adjutant,
„ „ Quartermaster,
~ „ Sergeant-Major,
„ „ Quartermaster Sergeant,
~ „ Provost Sergeant,
Troop-deck sergeants, sanitary and orderly room establish-
ment as necessary.
One acting quartermaster and one acting quartermaster-
sergeant should be sent on board each ship two or three
days prior to embarkation to take over stores, equip-
ment, &c., Issued for use on board. (See para. 1498.)


1580. The wearing of uniform by officers will be strictly enforced.
Those on duty will wear belts .... and will report on com-
pleting their tour of duty as to its proper performance.
1581. When there are more than two captains on board besides
the C. 0., a captain of the day ” will be appointed, to whom the
officer of the day and the military officer of the guard will report all
unusual occurrences for the information of the C.O. In transports,
when the troops on board consist of a mixed force of not less than 800
of all ranks, the number of officers required for daily duty, in addition
to the adjutant and quartermaster, is usually the officer of the day
and three officers of the guard. In freight ships, or when the numbers
are less than 800, a smaller number suffices.
1587. The officer of the day will be referred to in all matters not
requiring the intervention of the C. 0., and will give assistance to the
officers of the ship. He will attend when hammocks are taken down,
and will see them stowed at 6 a.m. He will ascertain from the master
if bedding can be aired, and see it secured in the places set apart for
the purpose. He will see that troop-decks are swept after hammocks
are down, and before and after each meal; also that troop-decks
are cleaned at the regulated time; he will report to the C. 0., and
accompany him when he inspects the decks. After troop-decks are
cleaned, he will cause police to be posted, with orders not to permit
any troops to go below. These police will be taken off at 11 a.m.,
at which hour the troops may go below again.
At meal times the officer of the day will see that the men are present
at the messes.
He will see that lights (except those required to burn all night) are
put out on the troop-decks at 9 p.m., and will report accordingly to
the C.O.
1588. The military officer of the guard will remain on deck unless
on duty elsewhere. Whenever his men are called he will attend with
them, and see that the wishes of the ship’s officer of the watch are
carried out. He will inform the master when soldiers in custody, or
lunatics, are on deck for exercise, and also when they have been
replaced in the guard-room. He will visit the sentries hourly during
the day and night, see that they are on the alert, that there is no
smoking in prohibited places, and no lights except those allowed. He
will cause a N.C.O. to visit the sentries every half hour during the
night.
1589. *The medical officer in charge will furnish the C.O. daily with
A.F. A 27 (Return showing Hospital admissions and discharges), and
will demand before 10.30 a.m. daily the medical comforts, &c., re-
required, and give the master a receipt when required. In
transports he will take sanitary and medical charge of the ship
and crew, and will frequently inspect the quarters occupied by
* The general method, of dealing with sick is laid down in King’s Regu-
lations and Standing Orders, Army Medical Service, Commonwealth Military
Forces.


the crew, calling attention to any neglect of cleanliness. He will take
care that the bilges are kept sweet, and a good sanitary condition
maintained. Deaths will be promptly notified in writing to the
master by the medical officer, for insertion in the log. On the day
following embarkation, soldiers will be inspected by the medical
officer. An inspection will also be made on the day before disem-
barkation, and cases of diseases will be removed to their destination
under medical supervision.
1590. Money and other valuables of the sick will.be noted, taken
over by the ward master, and handed over to the O.C. troops on board,
a receipt being obtained from him.
1591. At sea, sentries will wear a distinctive belt* ; in harbour
they may be armed at the discretion of the C.O.
1592. Each sentry will be furnished with written orders. Sentries
will report persons acting contrary to orders, and will prevent—
(i) blocking up ladders; (ii) spitting on the deck or over the side ;
{iii) throwing dirt or slops over the side or on the deck ; (iv) troops
from going aloft; (v) any person sitting on the side rails, bulwarks,
or rigging; (vi) any soldier from going into any part of the ship appro-
priated for use of the crew ; (vii) the hanging of clothes or bedding
in other than appointed places ; (viii) smoking, except in the autho-
rized parts of the ship and during smoking hours ; (ix) any person
from leaving his hammock or bed after the rounds have passed, except
to go to the latrines.
The C.O. will take steps to insure that sentries do not interfere
needlessly with the officers and crew of the ship.
1593. Should a sentry, or any one else, discover-fire, he will make
the same quietly and immediately known to the ship’s officer of the
watch on the bridge, for which purpose a sentry may temporarily quit
his post. It will be impressed on officers and men that on the occur-
rence of “ Fire ” silence and a quiet and thorough carrying out of
orders are most essential.
1594. The following rules to be observed on the fire or collision
alarm are generally applicable, but they may be modified to meet
the regulations of the various companies to which vessels may
belong :
(i) The troops, with the exceptions noted below, will fall in at the
places assigned for parade in two ranks, facing outwards, and as far
back to the centre of the ship as they can get.
(ii) Guard with lunatics and soldiers in custody on the forecastle,
Troop-deck sergeants, and mess orderlies at the messes for which they
are responsible. Pioneers will fall in at the magazine.
(iii) The boat party on the boat deck.
(iv) Orderlies will close scuttles and watertight doors without
further orders.
• A belt or band to be worn over the right shoulder will be improvised for
the purpose.


(v) The guard will at once provide two armed sentries for each
boat, an armed sentry on the spirit room, and double the sentries on
soldiers under arrest or detention.
(vi) Men will double up to their places as quickly as possible in any
dress. On each troop-deck there is usually a steam fire connexion
and hose ready for use. This will never be touched by the troops
unless fire is actually discovered, when the men on the deck where
the fire is may open the cock to turn on the water, at the same time
quietly and quickly reporting the fire to the ship’s officer on the
bridge.
(vii) The C.O. with one or more selected officers, will go on deck
to preserve discipline and carry out the directions of the master.
(viii) The adjutant, with the sergeant-major and a bugler, will
at once proceed to the fire and assist the ship’s officer.
(ix) Officers and men of the R.A.M.C.* will proceed to the hospitals
and prepare to move the sick as may be directed.
(xi) All officers to whom duties are not assigned, and all civilians
and second-class passengers, will repair to a place which will be
allotted for them on the upper deck.
(xii) In ships carrying horses, as many men as can be spared will be
sent to stand at the horses’ heads to keep them quiet.
1695. Printed instructions for troop-deck sergeants will be issued
on board. They will report to the officer of the day, at 10 a.m., and
again at 9 p.m., that their decks are ready for inspection.t
1596. An officer will not hold any conversation with the ships’
officer of the watch, the quartermaster, or the man at the wheel, and
he will not go on the bridge without permission.
1597. Orders will be given for cabins, to be vacated for cleaning
and daily inspection at a fixed hour, and for servants to be in attend-
ance to answer for the same.
1598. The saloon will be cleared and all lights extinguished by
11 p.m. or such time as may be required by the master of the vessel.
1599. Smoking is allowed on the upper deck only. In bad weather,
awning will be spread to shelter officers and men. To guard against
fire, lanterns for lighting pipes are provided, and matches, other than
safety ones, will not be used on board. When the wind is too high
to allow of cigarettes being smoked with safety (and of this the
master will be judge), the C.O. will insure that pipes only are smoked.
• A.A.M.C. in A.I. Force. *
t Note. —The following instructions are suggested : —The troop-deck sergeants
are responsible for the good order and cleanliness of the. portions of the deck and
the messes under their charge. It is their special duty to see that the following
rules are observed :—That nothing is either thrown out of or hung up in the port-
holes ; that no packs or bundles are left lying about, but that all such articles are
neatly stowed overhead ; that any man who attempts to smoke between decks is
immediately reported ; that hammocks are properly hung, and cleared off decks at
the proper hour in the morning ; that mess utensils are kept clean, and are in their
places at the morning inspection, at which hour they will report any breakages or
deficiencies ; that at evening rounds the men on the troop decks are in, or on
their hammocks, and keep perfect silence ; that the ladders and hatchways used
by the men of their decks are kept clean, and that to prevent confusion the men
use only those leading to their messes.


1600. Lights are not allowed on the troop-decks, except regulation
police and safety lamps. Lamps are never to be opened except
by ship’s officers or the appointed lamp trimmers.
1601. Decks are specially appropriated to the troops, who will
never go into the part of the ship allotted to the crew, nor will the
crew be allowed to go on the troop-decks except in the performance
of their duties.
1602. In order that troops may disembark in a fit condition to take
the field, arrangements will be made to carry out the physical train-
ing exercises laid down in Infantry Training. If possible, rope-
climbing will also be practised.
The following arrangement is suggested :—The troops to be told
off by companies, drafts, &c., into an equal number of divisions;
half of these divisions will be exercised for not less than one hour
every alternate day, the duties being detailed from the other half.
An officer of each company, draft, &c., will be present during the
whole exercise, and will keep a diary of the attendances of his men,
and will, before the troops disembark, report on any man considered
physically unfit to take the field. Each division will be subdivided
into squads of not more than 25 men each. A thoroughly qualified
N.C.O. will be placed in charge of each squad, and instruct it under
the direct supervision of the officer or officers in charge.
Voluntary work will be encouraged, and an hour to be named and
a place appointed for it. When possible, assaults at arms will be
arranged. See also Circular on Training (dated 13th August, 1914).
1603. When sleeping on deck is permitted, bedding will not be
allowed there except at hours to be fixed by the C.O. and master of
the ship.
1604. Troops will parade in marching order once a week. Officers
will see that necessaries are complete, and that arms and appoint-
ments are in serviceable order. When weather permits, men will
parade with bare feet.
An occasional parade with life belts will be held to teach the men
how to put them on, care being taken afterwards that the belts are
properly made up and stowed overhead by messes, so as to avoid
damaging the belts.
1605. The regular morning parade will be at 10 a.m., when every
man will be present. Cooks will appear on parade once a day.
1606. Recruits or awkward men will be drilled, when practicable,
for an hour in the forenoon and an hour in the afternoon.
1607. By 10.15 a.m. on Sundays the troops will be ready for divine
service, when weather permits. If there is no clergyman on board,
and the master does not undertake the duty, the C.O. will arrange
its performance.

The following ship’s signals are in general use :
For fire. —The boll is rung violently, strokes in quick succession.
For collision. —The bell is rung quickly, followed by several
short blasts on siren or whistle.


At these signals all buglers will sound the necessary calls. All
others remain quiet. •
For man overboard.—The steam whistle is sounded, several short
blasts in quick succession. At this signal the bugler on
duty will, if ordered by the officer of the watch, at once
sound the “ stand fast.” This order is to be explained to
all buglers and troops as early as possible.
1614. Any sum placed in the hands of the C.O. for the benefit of
the troops will be expended on the following items only :—Sports,
theatrical or musical entertainments, extra messing, or aid to families
of soldiers who may die during the voyage.
1615. Bedding will be checked frequently during the voyage, and
always on the day after departure from and on the day before arrival
at, each port. Stores issued for the use of troops on transports will
be received and accounted for on the same principle as if furnished
to troops in barracks. Only loss or damage caused by wilful act or
carelessness will be charged against the troops. Should a report be
made of considerable loss of, or damage to, stores or bedding, a board
will be ordered to investigate the matter, and the C.O. will fix respon-
sibility for the loss or damage. Copies of the proceedings, supported
by an extract from the ship’s log, will be handed to the master and
to the staff officer in charge.
1616. These rules will apply to mess and other utensils, any
deficiencies in which will be notified to the master.
1617. All clothing and bedding used by the sick, as well as that
of all men admitted to hospital, will be disinfected.
1618. Bedding for hospital use will be drawn by the medical officer
in charge from the master.
1619. Instructions as to the folding of bedding will be supplied
to N.C.O.’s in charge of messes, and reports will be obtained every
morning from them as to any articles missing or damaged, with the
names of men to whom the loss or damage is chargeable.
1620. It is desirable to appoint a N.C.O. as “ sanitary serjeant ”
to be responsible for all latrines, washhouses, &c., and to supervise
fatigue parties detailed for those parts of the ship. He will report
any defects to the officer of the day.
1621. Salt water will not be thrown on the troop-decks. They
will be swept, then scrubbed with hand scrubbers and carbolacene
or soft soap, and dried with the flannels provided for that purpose.
Scupper-plugs will not be removed.
In weather which will not admit of the men being sent on deck,
the troop-decks will only be sanded with hot dry sand and well swept,
no water being used, and in cold and damp weather they will either
be cleaned in the same manner, or with hot water and brushes, as
may appear most suitable. Requisites for cleaning decks will be
issued by the master, and will be drawn by troop-deck serjeants
through the quartermaster.


Messing and Canteens.
1622. Messing certificates will be signed by each officer, according
to the form (T. 201) contained in the Regulations for H.M.’s Transport
Service. This certificate will be retained by the master to support
the owner’s claim on the Admiralty.
1623. An officer will provide himself with sufficient cash to meet
charges for wine, &c., and for messing. Owners of transports and
freight-ships or their representatives, are directed not to accept
cheques in payment of such claims.
1625. The quartermaster will arrange with an officer deputed by
the master all details with regard to the issue of rations on board.
When the medical officer considers it necessary, lime juice and sugar
will be issued with the daily ration.
1626. Water for drinking will be always available day and night.
Water for washing will be available between the hours of—
-6.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.,
11.0 a.m. and 12 noon,
4.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.,
and at any other time at the discretion of the C.O.
1627. At the discretion of the C. 0., but generally speaking, only
in inclement weather and in non-tropical climates, each man of the
“ guard ” will receive at about 4 a.m. daily half a pint of cocoa with
sugar. Whenever an issue is desired, a statement of the number of
men for whom the ration will be required will be given to the master
on the forenoon of the previous day. If cocoa is not procurable in
freight ships, tea or coffee will be substituted.
1630. The C.O. will decide, in consultation with the transport
officer and the master, the hours during which the canteen is to be
open.* Copies of the price lists (furnished by the master) will be
exhibited in conspicuous places. The C-O. will take measures to
prevent bumboat men and hawkers boarding or coming alongside
the vessel with inferior articles of the same description as the
canteen stock.
1631. The officer of the day will report to the C.O. any neglect in
victualling, or complaints that may be made. If any complaint
arises, or when it seems desirable to make any suggestion, the C.O.
will call the attention of the naval transport officer (when there is
one on board), to the matter, and will address the master in writing.
Should he afterwards consider it expedient to make representation
to head-quarters on any matter connected with the accommodation
or messing of officers or troops, he will make a report in writing, or
cause a board to assemble and report on Army Form A 2 (C.M. Form
A 23.)
Intermediate Ports.
1632. An O.C. troops, on board a ship touching at any port occu-
pied by His Majesty’s forces, will immediately communicate with
the O.C. at the port, and, if junior to that officer, will personally
report the state of such troops. All officers will appear on shore in
uniform, and conform to the regulations of the garrison.
* It a caatefea is established.


1633. An O.C. troops at a port abroad will inform the O.C. troops
on board ship of any special regulations in force in his command.
1634. An O.C. troops on board ship will, on touching at an inter-
mediate port, prohibit any officer or soldier leaving the ship until
receipt of instructions from the staff officer in charge.
1635. On arrival in port, sentries will be posted to prevent the
introduction of spirits and unwholesome fruits into the ship, and to
exercise supervision over boats alongside.
1636. On change of C.O.’s accounts will be closed and stores for
which the outgoing C.O. is responsible, with vouchers connected
with the same, will be handed over. Written orders received at the
first port of embarkation will also be transferred. A certificate that
this has been done will be handed to the staff officer in charge.*
Disembarkations.
1639. Kit-bags will be issued before arrival in port, so that the
owners may throw any rubbish or old clothes overboard while the
ship is still in open water. Throwing such articles overboard in or
near port is forbidden.
1640. As soon as the ship is alongside, sentries will be posted to
prevent soldiers leaving the jetty without permission.
1641. The C.O. will arrange for the troop-decks, issue-rooms,
latrines, and washhouses to be cleaned before the troops disembark.
If necessary, a party will remain on board to finish this work after
the main body has left.
1642. When cases of infectious disease have occurred on board,
the C.O. will, on handing over stores, furnish a certificate that ali
articles capable of conveying infection have been disinfected on
board, handed over to the sanitary authorities at the port of disem-
barkation, or destroyed.
1643. When there is a large number of troops, two fatigue parties,
each under an officer, will be detailed as “ shore ” and “ baggage
room ” parties, to assist in landing baggage.
1644. If weather permits, the “ present use” and “light baggage”
will be in readiness to be landed at once.
# 1645. Bedding will be taken in and checked before disembarka.
tion commences, and the mess utensils after the last meal on board.
n K bedding has been withdrawn and troops do not disembark on
the day of arrival, hammocks and bedding according to scale will
be re-issued and a certificate rendered that this has been done.
Troops under orders to land before the dinner hour will be provided
with breakfast only.
r ~ Whenever it becomes obvious that the ship cannot be alongside
until noon at the earliest, hot dinners on the usual scale (with biscuits
in lieu of bread if so arranged) are to be issued at the most convenient
hour, and the mess utensils returned and decks cleaned immediately
afterwards.
* Or an Officer detailed for like duty.


1646. The following rules will be observed in accounting for losses
and damage on board of Government stores* (bedding, mess utensils,
&c.) :
The master will prepare in duplicate the following lists :
Admiralty Form T. 122, for losses, &c., of Government
stores (other than Government mess utensils), inserting
the prices from Admiralty Form T. 205.
A manuscript statement of losses, &c., of Government
mess utensils, if any.
The C. 0., if he finds the claim correct, will retain one copy, sign
the certificate on the other, and return it to the master as an acknow-
ledgment that the troops are liable, and that the amount chargeable
will be recovered from them.
The C.O. will assess the amount chargeable against the troops
concerned and forward the forms in his possession, together with '
particulars of the amount due from each unit, detachment or indi-
vidual, to the paymaster at the port of disembarkation for recovery
to be effected. .
1647. Any damage or loss of ship-owners’ stores which, in the
opinion of the O.C. troops, is wilful or the result of gross carelessness,
will be charged against the men.
The master will prepare a list of such damages and losses and
present it to the O.C. troops on board, who, if he finds the claim
correct, will sign it and return it to the master as an acknowledgment
that the troops are liable, with a statement that the amount will be
recovered from them. _
The amount of these damages and losses will be recovered in the
manner prescribed in the preceding paragraph.
Admiralty Forms T 122 and T 290 (applicable to the loss of
government stores) will not be used for this purpose.
1648. The advance of pay issued to detachments proceeding abroad
or from one station abroad to another, should enable the C.O. to meet
charges. An instance should not occur of troops leaving a ship
without all proper charges for losses, &c., hving been adjusted, either
by the money being paid to the C. 0., or by entries in the accdunts
of the men liable.
1649. The staff officer in charge will ascertain whether steps have
been taken for the payment of charges. If an appeal is made against
the amount, the matter will be investigated at once.
1650. When a ship with troops arrives at any port at borne, a
telegram will be sent immediately to the War Office, by the O.C.
at the port if a garrison, and if not, by the O.C. troops on board,
stating name of ship, whence arrived, and what troops are on board.
1651. On arrival in port the G.O.C. will arrange for disembarkation.
In ordinary circumstances, no person, unless on duty, is to be per-
mitted to leave the ship until all details of the disembarkation have
been arranged. A medical officer will be detailed to ascertain whether
the medical officer in charge has inspected the troops with a -view to

report of the inspection will be transmitted to the embarking staff
officer with the returns of sick on board (A.F, B 182).
1652. The following table contains a summary of the returns
rendered in connection with the disembarkation of troops by the O.C.
troops on board, on the day of disembarkation :
T.—For troops proceeding by transpo t. F.—Freight-ship, i P.—Packet.


The medical officer in charge will render returns in accordance with
the instructions contained in the Regulations for Army Medical
Service.
1659. The C.O. of the troops and another military officer will,
before quitting the ship, sign a certificate in the following form and
deliver it to the master :
“ This is to certify that I have been round the ship with
, and that no baggage, arms, nor accou-
trements of any description belonging to the troops are left on
board ’ Military Officer.
“ I have made full inquiry respecting the baggage, &c., of the
disembarked from the ship, and
find no complaints.

1660. After the troops have disembarked, the O.C. troops will
inspect the troop decks, &c., to see that they have been cleaned to
the satisfaction of the master, who will accompany him.
Should any further reference become necessary, the matter will
be settled by the naval authority and the staff officer i/c, acting
conjointly.
Mounted Troops, and Horses.
{See also “Animal Management,” Chapter IX.)
1661. The following instructions apply chiefly to long, voyages.
When the troops will only be one or two nights at sea, the arrange-
ments are liable to modification.
1662. Previous to embarkation, all horses will be inspected as to
fitness and freedom from infectious or contagious diseases. Horses
will, as far as practicable, be newly shod, fore shoes only, before
embarkation.
1663. As troop horses may be required for service soon after land-
ing. they should be embarked in good, hard, working condition. Ihe
strictest attention will be paid to the state of their digestions, but
they may be fed and worked as usual up to the day previous to
embarkation when sloppy half-and-half mashes will be given. If the
horses are walked on board they should be watered and fed previous
to embarking, and given hay immediately they are put in the stalls.
If they are to be slung on board they should not be watered and fed
for two hours previously. Shoes will not be removed.


1664. An officer and six men per company, &c., will receive the
horses on the stable deck and place them in their stalls. A stable
guard will be told off as soon as the men have embarked.
1665. Saddlery, &c., will be brought on deck at least once a week
for cleaning. On a long voyage it will be put in dubbing, and steel
appointments oiled before being packed up.
1666. On arrival abreast the ship, horses will be unsaddled, or
unharnessed, and the ship’s halters, which should be laid out ready
beforehand, will be put on under the head collars. Farriers will
inspect the shoes, while saddlery and harness are being fastened in
bundles for carrying on board. Dismounted men will on arrival be
told off into messes, and after stowing away their arras, kits, &c., and
putting on fatigue dress, will relieve the mounted men, who will then
be similarly told off to messes, &c. The mounted men will then carry
the harness, &c., on board, handing them over at the harness room to
a party told off to stow them. They will then embark their horses,
while the dismounted men embark baggage, vehicles, &c. Articles
required first on landing will be put on board last.
1667. Vehicles of all arms of the service will, whenever possible,
be hoisted in loaded, and without being dismounted. As, however,
the storage of explosives on board ship is arranged for by the Admiralty
officials, instructions as to the disposal of ammunition and other
explosives are given in the Admiralty Transport Regulations.
1668. When horses are walked on board, each man wifi, in the case
of the cavalry,* lead his own. Coir mats or straw will be laid along
gangways and decks. Horses will be led in close succession, and
without any check being allowed, in such order that those which stand
together in stables may be neighbours on the ship. A separate party
will be told off to fasten up the horses. The far stalls will be filled
up first. The parting bars will be at once placed. Kickers will, when
possible, be put in end stalls.
1669. Horses will be fastened up by the ship’s head collar, and the
company, &c., commander, with the farrier, will see that all the
horses are secured. The ordinary head collar mav be left on or not,
as thought advisable ; but it will not be used for fastening the horse!
Ihe horse s head will be tied rather short at first.
1670. As a rule, horses do not require to be slung when on board
ship. In the few cases in which this is necessary, the hammock’s
should hang three or four inches below the horse’s belly, so that he

oan rest hiraeslf in it when he likes. A supply of empty cornsacks
will be placed on board ; when stuffed with refuse hay they make
excellent pads for the protection of injured and exhausted horses.
They will be securely tacked to the stall stanchions or parting bars.
All breastrails are interchangeable, parting bars only being numbered.
1671 At least five per cent, of spare stalls will usually be left in
horse transports, half on each side. The horses can then be shifted,
cleaned, rubbed over, and their feet washed, and this will always
be done when weather permits. Hand-rubbing legs and sponging
eves and nostrils are of the greatest consequence to the well-being
of the horse, and will be carried out daily. Clean sea water will be
freely used for sponging the nostrils, lips, docks and mangers. Fine
cinders will be sprinkled under each horse to give him firm hold.
%
1672. Attention will be paid to cleanliness. Dung will be taken
away in the baskets provided for the purpose and not swept into the
scuppers. The “ rose heads,” provided to prevent the scuppers
from becoming choked, will not be removed.
1673 Ventilation is of importance for the maintenance of health.
Attention will be paid to seeing that the machinery fox the purpose
is kept in working order.
1674. When possible, horses will be brought on deck for exercise.
The importance of exercise as a means of maintaining condition and
preserving health, as well as preventing fever in the feet after
landing, cannot be over-estimated, and every effort will be made to
insure it.
1675 In rough weather, or on the occurrence of “ Fire, * as many
men as can be spared will be directed to stand at the horses heads.
1676. Loose boxes or stalls are provided for sick horses, and there
are portable boxes, by means of which horses can be sent on deck for
an airing.
1677. The scale of rations is given in the Regulations for H.M.’s
Transport Services, but the proportions of the articles may be varied.
The amount of the com ration will not exceed a_ proportion of naif
and half. If, however, many horses get sick, or exercising is
impossible, it is a good measure generally to reduce the oat ration
and give more bran. Mangers will be taken off when not required,
and laid down in front of the horses. When mangers are not pro-
vided, the horses will be fed with oats from the nose bag, and with
hay by hand or out of a hay net.
1678. Horses should get at least eight gallons of water daily, and
be watered at lest three times, and more frequently in hot weather.


1679. Morning Stables. —Raise platforms, rake and sweep the stalls
well out, and sprinkle disinfectants. Water the horses and sponge
nostrils, eyes, &c. Then feed as ordered.*
Midday Stables. —Shift horses into spare stalls and on to the deck
when practicable—pick and wash out feet, examine shoes, and fasten
any loose ones. Groom the body, brush and hand-rub the legs, brush
out mane and tail, and sponge nostrils and face, clean stalls, raise and
clean platforms, the deck underneath being dried, and disinfectants
used. When horses are clean, water and then feed as ordered.*
After dinner the horses will be fed with hay for an hour.
Evening Stables. —Rake stalls well out, sweep up, sponge nostrils,
&c., as in morning stables, hand-rub legs, water, and then feed as
ordered. Stablemen afterwards feed horses with remaining portion
of the hay.*
1680. Disembarkations are carried out in a similar manner to
embarkations.
1681. It is better to get everything belonging to men and horses
out of the ship before the horses are landed, as the men have not then
to quit their horses after disembarkation. The ordinary head-stall
and bridoon will be put on before horses are disembarked. When
horses have to be slung out of the vessel the ship s head collar will
also be kept on until the horses are on shore. Straw or sand will be
laid on the wharf for the reception of the horses. The horses are apt
at once to fall on their knees unless carefully held up.
