E City of Mackay dates its history back to 1860, when John Mackay, afterwards Captain John
Wv|K/ Mackay, Harbour Master of Queensland, led a small but adventurous exploring party from Rockhampton
northwards in search of country suitable for Sheep or Cattle. They discovered a river and named it
i €)
Mackay, in honor of the leader of the party. Subsequently this was altered to Pioneer, and the
settlement was named Mackay. A few years later an experienced planter introduced sugar cane, and this proved
such a successful crop that the river country became Queensland’s principal sugar producer—the Sugaropolis of
Queensland—and it has retained that title for sixty years. Last year this district produced 89,000 tons of raw sugar.
1 here are seven sugar mills, and Power Alcohol Works are now being constructed at Plane Creek Mill, Sarina.
The population “of Mackay District is 18,000 (8,000 being in town and suburbs). It has an excellent water supply,
also gas and electric light, and some of the finest buildings to be seen in any provincial town in the State. Photos
of some of these handsome buildings are reproduced herein. Mackay is now a City, and the country area is
divided into three Shires, viz : Pioneer Shire, Mirani Shire, Sarina Shire- Mackay is 598 miles from Brisbane,
and 202 miles from Rockhampton. Townsville is 234 miles north of Mackay, and Cairns 444 miles.
