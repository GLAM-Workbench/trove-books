PRAYER FOR OUR SOLDIERS.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph and all
the Saints in Heaven, we beseech
you from the bottom of our hearts
to watch constantly over and
protect all our boys who are
exposed to the dangers insepar-
able from a military life. Grant
them such a strong and fervent
faith that they may never deny
it nor fear to practise it. Do
Thou by Thy Grace, fortify them
against the contagion of bad
example that, being preserved
from sin and serving Thee faith-
fully they may be always ready
to meet death when and wnere
it may occur.
Most Sacred Heart of Jesus,
mindful of Your most Precious
Blood and of the Five Sacred
Wounds, we beg you to inspire
them with a sincere sorrow for
sin and grant them pardon.
Dear Lord, King of Peace, end
all wars and grant us peace in
the sacred name of the Holy
Family.

Centennial Ode
In Honour of Portland's First Mass
By URSULA CLINTON.
“Wind from the sea, from the open sea,
Calling, calling
Unto the breakers upon the beach,
Falling, falling.
Did you sweep up in the zchaling years
Wild with wonder,
Blending your minors of the treble clef
With white surfs wonder?”
I
“Yes, I am the voice of the century
Portland ponders;
Stirring the heart of the Portland born
Where he wanders.
Plenty’s strange sails to the land I blezv,
Szmshing, shouting,
‘This is the conqueror, flee and hide!’
To black man scouting.”
“Wind, did you walk zuith the pioneers,
Coming, going,
Pasturing sheep on the golden plains,
Building, sozving?”
“Yes, I knezv the bluest one of house and fence,
Whale-ship’s bustling,
Chieftains who bartered their tribal grounds,
Shearing’s tussling.”
“Did you, a decade from Henty’s day,
Best time biding,
See, silhouetted against the east,
Three men riding?”


“True, they rode in with November’s sun
Wild flowers dressing,
Bringing a weary but patient folk
God’s high blessing.”
“Tell us, 0 tell us their precious names.”
“Mitred Polding,
Priestly McEncroe and Mac Evey,
Great beholding!
Brought by a passionate people’s urge,
Prayer and fasting,
Sacrament-sealed they all those who sought
Life ever-lasting.”
“Praise the Archbishop from Sydney’s peace
Always faring
Over a continent wild and new
In his daring.
Blest were Victoria’s western plains
That he travelled;
Faith grew and spread like their native grass,
Doubts unravelled.”
“Thanks to Trinitical Providence,
Portland people,
Offer in prayer and through choral Mass,
Ring from the steeple.
Century far is the prised first Mass,
Stone-inn offered;
Be this centennial sacrifice
Gladly proferred.”
August, 1944.


Early Days of Portland
SOME 226 miles by road from Mel-
bourne, situated on the southern
shores of Australia, is the finest
harbour on the Victorian coast —
Portland Bay. The bay extends from
Cape Grant northwards to Lighthouse
Point, and one can see in the distance
Julia Percy Island and the Laurence
Rocks. These rocks were the scene
of more than one shipwreck in the
early days.
WHALING
From 1800 onwards boats from Lon-
don to Sydney passed by Port-
land Bay; and in that year Lieutenant
Grant, in the “Lady Nelson,” cruis-
ing the mouth of the bay, named it
after the Duke of Portland. Many
whalers and sealers were already in
the bay.
We know that for many years be-
fore the coming of a white man to
Portland seafarers used Portland Bay
waters for fishing and shelter. One
of the earliest references is in a let-
ter to the Duke of Portland from
Governor Hunter, in 1798, stating
that a small vessel from China had
arrived with 1500 seal skins. Ships
from England, France and U.S.A.
also worked these fishing waters. In
1828 William Dutton visited Portland
Bay on a whaling expedition. He
retired from open sea life 1849, set-
tling on the land 10 miles from Port-
land, at Narrawong.
It was to be expected that when
Hentys arrived years later they would
embark upon this profitable indus-
try of whale and seal fishing. The
whalers used long, narrow, pointed
boats, and these were in constant
readiness while “look-out” men scan-
ned the bay from their “stations.”
It is recorded that in 1844, 22
whales were harpooned and captured
in the bay.
An extract from the “John O’Groat”
Scotch journal asserts that a huge
whale, 62 feet long and weighing 72
tons, was captured in Behring Strait
in 1880 with one of Henty’s harpoons
stuck in it. The weapon when ex-
amined bore the inscription, “HENTY,
L., 1838”—“L.” standing for Launces-
ton, where Hentys had a number of
their harpoons made.
The mention of Henty brings us
back to the first white settlers in
Portland.
THE HENTYS
Thomas Henty was owner of the
freehold of W. Tarring and part
owner of Henty’s Bank at Worthing,
Sussex. Attracted by the generous
land grants then in Australia, he de-
cided to come here. He chartered
the barque “Caroline” and sent in
charge of it his three sons, Stephen,
James and Jolin, together with a
number of servants, sheep, cattle,
horses and implements. They set
sail in 1829—the year of Catholic
Emancipation—and settled on the
Swan River in W.A. The country did
not impress them, so they sailed
away to Tasmania. Before setting
out for Tasmania, the Henty Brothers
advised their parents, who were yet
in England, to join them in Tas-
mania. This they did, bringing out
with them the remaining members of
the family—Charles, Edward, Frank
and Jane.
Their parents selected a beautiful
property on the banks of the Tamar
River, starting their sons in lucrative
positions. In 1833, Edward Henty
began to explore the southern coasts
of Australia; and in 1834 the schooner
“Thistle” was dispatched to Portland
Bay, Edward Henty being in charge.
He took with him servants, stock and
implements, arriving on 19th Novem-
ber, 1834. , ,
That year also marked the appoint-
ment and consecration of Dr. Polding
as first Bishop of New Holland and
Van Diemen’s Land and adjoining
Islands. Australia was still known as
New Holland.


In 1934 Portland celebrated the cen-
tenary of Henty’s first landing. John
Batman, in 1835, was the first white
man to sail a boat up the Yarra.
Edward Henty was certainly the first
permanent settler in Victoria, and
Portland the first permanent settle-
ment. Later he was joined by his
brothers, Stephen, Frank and John,
and all worked in partnership until
1842. When the explorer, Major Mit-
chell, visited Portland, in 1836, and
saw Henty’s stations at Merino Downs,
Sandford and Muntham, he described
the country as “Australia Felix.” Ste-
phen’s son, Richmond, bom 1837,
claimed to be the first white native
of the first settlement of Victoria.
Two of the Henty homes still exist
in Portland: Burswood and the Rich-
mond Hotel.
BLACKFELLOWS
Members of Portland Bay tribe were
not numerous. The blackfellow was
the husband of one wife. Probably
economic reasons prompted this. He
did not know the existence of the
true God; but believed in and had
great fear of an evil being, and was
very frightened of death. Kangaroos
were their beef, wombat their mut-
ton, wallaby, opposum and bandicoot
choice foods. Richmond Henty re-
lates many amusing stories of his
shooting exploits accompanied by his
black boy.
IMMIGRANT SETTLERS
From 1831 onwards Ireland was
wasted by cholera and famine, and
between 1831 and 1864, 3,000,000 Irish
were forced to emigrate. Many came
to Australia.
In 1834 Portland had about 20
people. By 1840 many immigrants had
been brought to Portland to work for
the settlers, who> found it difficult to
obtain help. In November, 1841, La
Trobe wrote to J. Blair, Magistrate
here, advising that 69 immigrants
were to be landed at Portland by the
ship “Ellen Elizabeth.” By 1842 it had
2500. Then, as Melbourne mercantile
houses cut into its trade its progress
receded.
FIRST CHURCH
We are now faced with the question:
what provision was made for the re-
ligious practices of these first settlers
in Portland Bay?
The first step to establish a church
in Portland did not occur until 1841.
In that year a site was purchased for
the Church of England—corner of
Julia and Percy streets. The first
clergyman to visit Portland and preach
was Rev. Adam Thomson, Anglican
minister. A temporary church was
erected, which served as a school and
church until the new church was
built in 1856. This was blessed by
Bishop Perry.
The first regular Methodist services
were conducted by Thomas Wilkin-
son and Mr. Saunders in Henty’s
store in 1842.
To cater for the needs of the Pres-
byterians, Rev. A. Laurie was sent
out from Scotland, arriving here
March, 1842. He remarks that then
the Catholics formed the largest num-
ber of the population of Portland.
He adds, “they have no priest yet.”
"CLERGY'S REST"
In 1841, the Anglican minister, Rev.
A. G. Thomson, selected a site for a
cemetery known as “CLERGY’S
REST” to-day. There were many
burials there by 1843. But this was
objected to as being too near the
town.
In 1845 La Trobe instructed Blair
to select a six-acre plot—for all de-
nominations most bodies from
“Clergys Rest” Cemetery were re-
moved. This new cemetery is the
present “old cemetery” on the Hey-
wood Road. In that old cemetery,
one priest, Fr. J. Guilfoyle, is buried.
The South Portland new cemetery,
two miles from the town, was opened
in 1861. Fr. J. O’Donoghue is buried
there, and 15 Loreto nuns.


CATHOLIC SETTLERS
The census of 1834 showed 203
Catholics in the district. On Novem-
ber 24th, 1842, in a letter written to
his committee in Scotland, the Rev.
Alexander Laurie, the first Presby-
terian clergyman at Portland, has the
following to say: “The population of
the township and suburbs of Portland
may be estimated at about 800 souls.
The most numerous class are the ad-
herents of the Church of Rome. They
have no priest as yet; some of the
less bigoted occasionally attend our
service. Not a few of them came
voluntary and offered me a subscrip-
tion for our church.” As a matter
of fact, we have his first subscription
list, and in it we find names that
arrest attention: John Cronin, £2;
Thos. Finn, £1; Henry Hayden,
£2/2/-; William Nowlan, £1; Mat-
thew Nowlan, £1; Daniel O’Neill,
£5, and others. We find the same
names with others of a Hibernian
origin on the first Anglican list. Un-
fortunately, we have no copy of sub-
scribers to the first Catholic church,
and, if we had one, would doubtless
find there names of Scots and of
Englishmen. There was a good deal
of theological give and take in the
early days of Portland Bay.
As the Catholics in Sydney met for
Sunday devptions in Mr. Davis
house, we may be sure the Catholics
of Portland Bay had their Rosary and
other familiar devotions at some ap-
pointed spot as they anxiously awaited
the arrival of a priest. There were
only a couple of priests then in the
whole of Victoria —called at that time
Port Phillip district, and the only
Bishop in Australia, Dr. Polding, lived
in Sydney.
Sad to relate, some of these Catho-
lics gave up their faith, and some
had their marriages performed by
Protestant ministers.
The following list will indicate that
quite a number of stations were held
by well-known Catholics:

Although the Catholic settlers came
mostly from Ireland, there were many
families from England and the high-
lands of Scotland, notably the Mc-
Killops and Camerons. The Irish in
Portland celebrated their first St. Pat-
rick’s Day festival in 1843. On the
same day, the first High Mass was
celebrated in Victoria, there being
now three priests in the colony.
An April 23, 1843, a petition from
the Catholics of Portland was for-
warded to Archbishop Polding at
Sydney, requesting the appointment
of a resident priest. Funds for his
support were guaranteed by 116 sig-
natures to the petition.
On May 17, a subscription list
was opened for the erection of a
chapel, and £l5O raised in a few
hours.
That Dr. Polding had not forgot-
ten the petition is shown by the fact
that when next year, 1844, the Arch-
bishop paid his first visit to Mel-
bourne, he lost no time in journey-
ing to Portland.
According to the “Portland Guar-
dian,” in its Melbourne news of Oc-
tober 26th: “His Grace, Archbishop
Polding will consecrate the R.C. burial
ground on Saturday afternoon next,
at 4 o’clock, and on Sunday morn-
ing at 10 lie will administer Con-
firmation at St. Francis’ Church. It
is his intention to proceed next day


to Geelong and Portland Bay for the
same sacred purpose.”
The Sacrament of Confirmation was
administered to 312 candidates, many
of them of advanced years. It was
the first time Confirmation was ad-
ministered in Victoria.
On November 2, the “Geelong Ad-
vertiser” reported Archbishop Fold-
ing’s arrival in Portland:
“His Grace Archbishop Polding ar-
rived on Tuesday last, 22nd, by
steamer from Melbourne, en route
for Portland Bay. His stay will be
very short, as it is his intention to
pass overland on horseback to Port-
land and return in the same manner
by another route, so as to spread the
benefits of his visit as widely as
possible.”
On November 9, the “Portland
Guardian” discussed Archbishop Fold-
ing’s coming, not without alarm, in
a leading article, under the title,
“The Descent of Catholicism into the
District.” The following extract must
suffice:
“Circumstances have brought about
the introduction of Catholic worship
into Portland. On Saturday last, in
the forenoon, his Grace Archbishop
Polding, with two of his priests, ar-
rived in the township, and on Sun-
day held a variety of services, both
public and private, in the store for-
merly occupied by Mr. Tulloch, in
Gawler-street. The public services
were well attended, on most occa-
sions, Protestants forming as large a
proportion of the congregation as the
members of the Catholic Church. The
first Mass then offered at Portland
was that celebrated by Dr. Polding,
on Sunday, November 3, 1844, in Mr.
Tulloch’s store, and that tradition is
firmly held to this day—loo years
after the event.”
Dr. Polding was accompanied to
Portland by Archdeacon McEncroe
and Father Mac Evey, and during his
stay in the district was the guest of
Mr. J. Blair at his residence, “Green-
mount.” .
“The Sydney Morning Chronicle
(December 7, 1844) records the im-
pressions of Dr. Polding and Arch-
deacon McEncroe after their visit to
Portland and Port Fairy. “Speaking at
a meeting of the Propagation of the
Faith on Sunday last, Fr. McEncroe
said: ‘He noticed in his travels the
great spiritual destitution of many of
their fellow-countrymen. The Arch-
bishop and himself found considerable
numbers of Catholics in Portland Bay
and Port Fairy who had never been
favoured with a visit from a Catholic
clergyman, and who had not, .of
course, the opportunity of partaking
of the Life-giving Bread of the Blessed
Eucharist. It was edifying to wit-
ness the piety and fervour of these
people. Their earnest appeal for a
priest was the more heartrending,
since, on account of the limited num-
ber of priests in Australia, we were
not able to comply with their request
for the present.’ ”
Archdeacon McEncroe begged for
funds to provide clergymen for these
missions. He stated that during their
four days in Portland, upwards of 100
persons received Holy Communion, 50
children baptized, and several mar-
riages blessed.
FATHER WALSH AND FATHER GEOGHEGAN
Two years were to elapse before
another visit of priest, when Father
Robert Walsh, of Geelong, which in-
cluded as its parish the whole of the
Western District, arrived on a visit
in January, 1846. In June that year
1£ acres were reserved for a Roman
Catholic burial ground, the lay trus-
tees being James Blair and Walter
Birmingham. Mr. Blair was the P.
Magistrate.
Fr. Geoghegan, V.G., made a mis-
sionary tour of the Western District
in 1847, extending over three months.
He remained at Portland almost six
weeks, staying at Portland Bay Hotel.
His first baptism is dated May 16,
1847; his last, June 26. During that
interval he baptized 54 children. On
the two Sundays, June 13 and 20,
he celebrated Mass in the room of a
Mr. Burns, at the Commercial Inn


Parish of Portland

INTERIOR OF ALL SAINTS' CHURCH


(later Gordon Hotel). While here he
appealed for subscriptions for a
chapel and a resident priest, £3OO
being needed before Government as-
sistance could be obtained. £l5O was
at once subscribed, and Fr. Geoghe-
gan then visited Mr. Murphy’s station
in the Wannon. “Port Phillip Herald,”
December 6, 1847: “Fr. Geoghegan
reported a Government Grant, £lOO,
for Catholic clergyman at Portland.”
Concerning Fr. Geoghegan’s visit in
1847, to Port Fairy and Portland Bay,
the “Portland Gazette” published the
following item, which was reprinted
in the “Sydney Chronicle” (July 7,
1847):
“The Very Rev. P. B. Geoghegan,
we regret to say, received a rather
severe wound in the left arm from
a bite of a dog on Sunday night at
Mr. Blair’s. Having immediately,
however, returned home (to his lodg-
ings) and obtained the professional
services of Dr. Drummond, there is
no danger of any serious consequence.
“He is meeting with every encour-
agement in his efforts to build a
chapel and secure sufficient support
for a resident clergyman in Portland.
We may also mention that by Sun-
day’s post, Mr. Geoghegan received a
cheque for £lOO from James Atkin-
son, Esq., of Belfast, who was in
Sydney during Mr. Geoghegan’s last
visitation in the Port Fairy district.
Mr. Atkinson has also given two acres
of ground in the township of Bel-
fast, estimated as worth £3OO, for
the site of a chapel and a clergyman’s
residence. This handsome donation
is more praiseworthy as Mr. Atkin-
son is not a Roman Catholic, but gives
it as a landlord desirous of encour-
aging his tenantry, the great majority
of whom are of that persuasion. We
understand that when chapels are
erected and clergymen settled in Bel-
fast and Portland, a great many peo-
ple will come here who are at pre-
sent prevented by the absence of
the means of obtaining the benefits of
the ordinances of their religion.”
Fr. Patrick B. Geoghegan was the
first priest appointed by Archbishop
Polding to watch over the Catholic
flock in the infant colony of Vic-
toria. After tending the Church of
Melbourne in its infancy he saw it
grow into a flourishing diocese.
Born in Dublin, he entered the
Franciscan Order, and, volunteering
for the Australian he arrived
in Sydney on December 31, 1838.
Coming to Victoria, his was the privi-
lege to offer the first Mass celebrated
in Victoria on May 19, 1839. The
broad canopy of Heaven served for
a roof. Later he built the first chapel
in Melbourne—St. Francis’. He suc-
ceeded Dr. Murphy as Bishop of Ade-
laide, and was transferred to the See
of Goulbum in 1864. During that
year he was on a visit to Europe, and
died in Ireland before he occupied
his new Episcopal See of Goulbum.
FIRST PASTOR AND FIRST CHAPEL
At last, in the year 1847, the ap-
peals of the Portland Catholics were
answered when Rev. Fr. Kavanagh
was appointed first resident priest. In
the early part of that year he was
attached to St. Francis’, Melbourne.
His parish at Portland must have
included Belfast, as Port Fairy was
called, for he signs himself as Min-
ister of Portland and Port Fairy.
A site for church buildings had al-
ready been authorised by the Colonial
Secretary at Sydney on November,
1846. Fr. Kavanagh soon set about
erecting a temporary church. The
“Corio Chronicle” (March 27, 1848)
reported that “the foundations of the
Roman Catholic Chapel at Portland
are completed and preparations are
going forth to complete the building.”
The “Portland Guardian” of Decem-
ber 18 of the same year stated that
“the walls of the Roman Catholic
Chapel are up and the roof is in the
course of progression (construction),”
and added, “The building promises to
be a neat one if not spoiled by too
many decorations.”
And, again, on February 8, 1849,
we read that tenders were called by


Fr. Kavanagh for glazing and painting
the chapel and for fencing the allot-
ment. , . .
Fr. Kavanagh accompanied tne
Bishop to Gippsland during November
and December of 1848 and January,
1849. According to the “Portland
Guardian” (February 9, 1849), “the
Right Reverend Dr. Goold, the Roman
Catholic Bishop, arrived in Portland
on Tuesday last, accompanied by the
Rev. J. Kavanagh, on his first visit
to this part of the Port Phillip Dio-
cese.” On February 12 the same jour-
nal reports, “Dr. Goold conducted
Divine Service yesterday in the
Roman Catholic Chapel for a large
congregation.”
THE OPENING
Although the building was not yet
glazed or painted, it appears that it
was blessed and opened by the Bishop
on February 11, 1849. On February
16, Dr. Goold departed for Melbourne
on board the “Eumerella.” This build-
ing still stands, and is situated be-
tween the rear part of the presbytery
and the convent. It has been used
for very many years as primary
school, and is still serving that pur-
pose.
FATHER KAVANAGH'S MISSION
Tr. Kavanagh’s Mission was an ex-
tensive one involving much travelling
on horseback, not only between Port-
land and Port Fairy, but visits to the
various stations in all directions where
Catholics were to be found. Among
the places he visited were Tower Hill,
Mt. Sturgeon (Dunkeld), The Grange
(Hamilton), Hopkins River, Rosebrook,
Glenelg, and even Mt. Gambier. The
following unedited notes indicate the
extent of his labours:
February 3rd, 1847. Baptized James,
son of James Blair and Margaret
Lomasney, of Portland. The family
of the well-known Police Magistrate
of Portland. Note: The maiden name
of Mrs. Blair is not Le Maistre as
mentioned in Learmonth’s ‘ Portland
Bay Settlement.”
March 2nd, 1848 s Baptized Thomas,
son of David Edgar and Sarah
O’Meara, of Pitzroy River (Hey-
wood). This was Edgar, owner ot
the well-known Bush Tavern or
Cave Holes, the most popular and
best known hotel of the time. Edgar
also had the Fitzroy grazing run. A
story goes that about this time a
man named Billson owned Pine Hills
Station, near Harrow, where the
blacks (natives) were very trouble-
some. He was frightened of the lat-
ter, and coming to Fitzroy Crossing,
offered Edgar to exchange his station
for Edgar’s Tavern. The offer was
accepted. The Edgars prospered at
Pine Hills. Among his sons were
James O’Meara Edgar, John Thomas
(he had Kadnook station), Walter
(owner of Longland. near Harrow).
The above-mentioned Thomas prob-
ably died young. Of the family the
mother alone clung to the Catholic
Faith; the others became staunch
Presbyterians. Close to Pme “li: 3
Station was Mullagh, owned by the
Fitzgeralds, originally from Port-
land. Priest celebrates Mass regular-
ly at Mullagh, and at one time Fr.
McNab was specially summoned there
to hear the confession of a dying
Highlander, who spoke only Gaelic.
April 3rd, 1848 s He baptized at Mt.
Gambier four children of the family
of Charles Hayes—Mark., Charles,
John and Caesar. The Hayes family
were devout Catholics. John and
Caesar married into the Sutton
family, of Dismal Swamp Station,
some fourteen miles from Mt. Gam-
bier. They were equally devoted to
the Faith. Anthony Sutton, whose
wife was Molly Kiernan, from Dan-
gan, County Meath, was in partner-
ship with Geo. Kelley, father of my
informant. Their Agreement, written
in two leaves of a pocket-book, read:
“We agree to share equally the
profits and losses of this station.
Each signed and each took a leaf.
This Anthony Sutton had a son, An-
thony, the present owner of Dismal
Swamp. He is a Papal Knight, and
his relatives have been generous
benefactors of the Church.
May 23rd, 1848: Baptized John and
Michael, sons of Mr. and Mrs. John
Quigley, at Mount Napier, in the
vicinity of Wannon Falls. This
gentleman, formerly a teacher in
Ireland, kept a hotel at this place
(between Hamilton and Coleraine).
Negretta Station (Murphy’s) visited
by Fr. Geoghegan, was here. Fr.
Geoghegan stayed eight days in the
Coleraine and Wannon districts.
Wearing an oilskin coat, he rode
down on the east side of the river,


and crossed under the Wannon Falls
to the western side, where Geo.
Kelley, father of my informant, met
him with a fresh horse, and took him
to the out-station of Whyte Bros.,
now known as Gritjurk. Here he
celebrated Mass and baptized several
children and possibly married some
persons.
May 28th, 1848: Baptized James, son
of James Rapkins and Bridget Tang-
ney, of Glenlevit Station. This was
near Digby.
May 30th, 1848: Baptized Bridget,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Patrick
Hyland, of Koroite Station. This
was owned by Cameron, and was
situated between Coleraine and Ham-
ilton. At the time of this baptism
Hyland was near Casterton. This
daughter, Bridget, became a famous
beauty. She figured in an exhibition
of beauties, and her photo was widely
circulated.
May 31st, 1848: Fr. Kavanagh
travelled from Muntham, where he
was the previous day, to Sheep Bank
station, and thlere baptized Thomas,
Elizabeth, George and Stephen, chil-
dren of Patrick and Mrs. Sweet.
June Ist, 1848: Found him at an-
other station, “Glenmire,” owned by
William Nolan, and there baptized
John, Mary, Catherine and Margaret,
children of Mr. and Mrs. Nolan.
June 2nd, 1848: The next he was
at Glenelg (now Harrow), where he
baptized four children of Mr. and
Mrs. John Lauton.
June 3rd, 1848: At Clunie station
(Harrow), where James, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Michael Byrne, was bap-
tized. Denis, a son of this couple,
died at Goroke about twenty years
ago. And so we come back again
withi Fr. Kavanagh to Portland,
where, on June 28 he had another
baptism.
To go back a little: On November
16, 1847, Mary, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Simon Minogue, was baptized
at Portland. This was a distin-
guished and good Catholic family.
The sons, John, Jerome and Michael,
lived in Edenhope. A daughter of
Jerome is now Mrs. Jas. Daly, of
Clunie station, Harrow. It must be
mentioned also that James Daly,
father of the present owner, gave
ten acres of land to the Church. In-
cluded in that area is the site of the
old Clune homestead, where Mass was
said in the olden times, when Blair,
of Portland, owned the property.
August 3rd, 1848: Walter Birming-
ham was sponsor for John Burns,
son of Mr. and Mfs. John Burns, of
Portland. This Walter was the
father of a family connected with
the Fitzgerald of Mullagh. His name
appears in 1844, when two daughters
(Sarah and Mary) were baptized at
Portland by Archbishop Polding.
SECOND PASTOR AND FIRST SCHOOL
Fr. Kavanagh was succeeded at
Portland by Rev. Michael Stephens,
in March, 1849 v The new pastor had
been attached to the Vicariate Apos-
tolic of Madras, India. Arriving in
Port Phillip in 1842 to take over Fr.
Geoghegan’s duties, he was the only
priest in the Melbourne Mission for
five months.
He established the first Catholic
school in Portland on March 27, 1849.
The attendance was 25. Miss Rosanna
Phillipina Quinn was appointed in
charge, receiving the Government
salary of £25 per annum, plus 6d.
per week school fees.
From a report of Inspector Chil-
ders, who visited Portland in Feb-
ruary, 1851, we have the following de-
tails of the school. It was held in a
small wooden house in Gawler-street,
which was rented at £l2 per annum.
There were two rooms, 14 ft. x 10 ft.,
and 10 ft. x 10 ft. Thirteen boys and
twenty-three girls attended. The
teacher’s name is given as Rosanna
Quinn, who had previously been a
governess in a private school at Port-
land. Fr. John Roe, who succeeded
Fr. Stephens, stated that the chapel
had been intended as a school, and
that if a larger church was erected
(which was not likely), it would still
be used as such. From the corre-
spondence of the Denominational
Schools Board come the names of the
teachers during the next few years—
Miss Mosiamo Nino, July, 1852; Nicho-
las Byrne, July, 1852, to January, 1854;
Miss Ellen McEl'igott, February, 1854,
to September, 1854. In October, 1854,
the school was divided into two sec-
tions, Miss McElligott retaining charge
of the girls, and Martin J. Phelan
taking over the boys. In July, 1855,
the average attendance was 90 chil-
dren.


THIRD PRIEST AND FIRST PRESBYTERY
The third pastor of Portland, Fr.
John Roe, whom Dr. Geoghegan had
secured for the diocese, was appointed
immediately on his arrival from Ire-
land in May, 1851. Victoria was in
the grip of the gold rushes, and many
of the people of the Western District
had joined the rush to Ballarat. He
found only 991 inhabitants in the
Portland district, of whom 517 were
Catholics, in a far-flung parish, ex-
tending to the South Australian bor-
der. Fr. Roe was responsible for the
building of the first presbytery.
The “Portland Guardian” reported
on March 12, 1855, that “a dwelling
house, to be built of stone, intended
as a residence for the Roman Catholic
clergyman, is now in course of erec-
tion on the ground belonging to the
Catholic Church. It is close to the
church, and on the side of the fence
nearest the sea, and altogether should
make a very pleasant residence.”
The cost was £893, and it was
ready for occupation on September
12. The “Guardian” of September 13,
1855, stated: “The new stone dwelling
house for the Roman Catholic clergy-
man is now completed, and the Rev.
John Roe, who has resumed clerical
duties, has entered into occupation.”
During Fr. Roe’s temporary absence
the mission was served by the Rev.
John A. Parker, a recent arrival from
Cork, where he had been chaplain
to the Cork Union Workhouse. The
only reference to his stay is a news-
paper item that he celebrated Mass
on Sunday, August 12. He returned
to Geelong in September.
The year 1855 was a historic one
for the colony of Victoria. In 1851
it was cut off from New South Wales,
but it was not until 1855 that it
achieved stability, under the impact of
the gold rushes and self-government
under a new constitution. William
Clarke Haines was elected the first
member for Portland in the new Vic-
torian Parliament.
FOURTH PASTOR AND SECOND CHURCH
Portland’s fourth pastor was a
member of the Augustinian Order.
Rev. R. S. Downing, O.S.A. He was
given temporary charge of Geelong in
March, 1849, while Dr. Geoghegan
was in Europe in search of priests
for the diocese. In 1856 he was ap-
pointed to Portland. He at once de-
voted all his energies to the erection
of a much-needed new church to meet
the demands of a growing population.
Fr. Downing at once started collect-
ing funds for the erection of a new
church, which was now badly needed.
The “Guardian,” on January 12, 1857,
stated that “the new church for the
Roman Catholic community is to be
commenced immediately. A Govern-
ment grant for the purpose has been
obtained. The church is to be of a
superior class of architecture, and
will present, what will be a novel at-
traction in this town, a tower and
spire.”
THE FOUNDATION OF ALL SAINTS' CHURCH
Bishop Goold, accompanied by Dr.
Geoghegan, arrived by the “Lady
Bird” on July 18, 1857, to lay the
first stone on the following day. The
press reported that “a large and high-
ly respectable company attended. Af-
ter the usual formalities on such oc-
casions, a procession was formed and
walked around the foundation boun-
dary of the future church.” The
ceremony was followed by Pontifical
Mass. The collection, which realised
about £7O, was taken up on the
ground. The new church was dedi-
cated to “All Saints.”
The “Guardian” of October 28, 1857,
reporting progress of the work, stated
that “the erection of this fine build-
ing is proceeding with despatch. One
contract for several feet high of the


walling is completed, and another
tender is being called for the com-
pletion of the mason work. The build-
ing is according to plans sent out from
London, and will be quite an orna-
ment to the town.”
Fr. Downing was recalled by his
Order to Ireland at the beginning of
1860. His last Portland record is
dated December, 1859. The walls of
the church had been completed, and
£2900 had been spent, towards which
he had collected £lOOO. The super-
vising architect had been Daniel
Nicholson. J. F. Bonwick, in his
“Tour of the Western District” (1857),
gives a striking pen-picture of the
Augustinian: “Rev. R. S. Downing was
the first Roman Catholic catechist of
the Roman Catholic Church to a prison
ship. He is one of the most conver-
sational, agreeable, corpulent, and ab-
stemious clergymen in the west.” He
was particularly devoted to the chil-
dren, as the following note in the
“Guardian" (January 29, 1858) in-
dicates: “Children attending the
Roman Catholic school were enter-
tained by Rev. Fr. Downing at a
feast. Great hilarity prevailed among
the 80 who attended.”
FR. JOHN O'CONNELL
Fr. Downing was succeeded by Fr.
L. O’Meara, who had just arrived
from Ireland. . A man of delicate
health, the long journeys and the
rigours of the Australian mission led
to his untimely death the following
year. Fr. John O’Connell was ap-
pointed to the charge of Portland
parish. He arrived by steamer early
in 1860. In the short space of two
years, he succeeded in completing
All Saints’ Church, for which he col-
lected £2OOO.
Its solemn blessing and opening by
Bishop Goold on April 6, 1862, was
one of the outstanding events in the
history of the Church in Portland.
A full account is given in the pages
of the “Portland Guardian” (April,
1862):
"All Saints' Church"
“This handsome structure is being
rapidly completed. The doors and
windows are nearly finished, and the
pews in the interior are now fixed.
The workmen engaged are doing their
best to complete the work before the
opening ceremony, which takes place
to-morrow at 10£ o’clock." —(“Guar-
dian,” April 5, 1862.)
By way of preparation, the event
was fully advertised in the Press.
On March 22, we read: “All Saints’,
Portland. The Right Rev. Dr.
Goold, Catholic Bishop of Melbourne,
will arrive in Portland on Wednes-
day, April 2, 1862, accompanied by
Dr. Shiel, of Ballarat, when his
Lordship will give a mission on
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.” On Sunday, April 6, his
Lordship will open the new church.
Tickets of admission may be had
from Messrs. T. and J. Finn, Julia-
street; “Guardian” Office; Messrs.
Trangmar and Crouch, Percy-street,
P. Moore, Commercial Inn, Forests;
Mr. Kurtze, Bentinpk-street; Mr. W.
Glanagan, Mechanics’ Institute, and
at the presbytery.”
However, an altered advertisement
appeared five days later to the> effect
that “to liquidate the debts already
incurred in the erection of All Saints
Church, a collection will be made,
but not by ticket, as at first an-
nounced. Voluntary contributions
will be thankfully received, but all
are invited to attend the opening
ceremony.” The editor added the ob-
servation: "We think the church au-
thorities have acted wisely in this
respect, as under other circum-
stances, some might have been pre-
vented from attending.”
And again—“ Guardian,” April 5,
1862: “Solemn Dedication of All
Saints’ Church, Portland. This im-
pressive ceremony will take place
on next Sunday, April 6, at half-
past ten o’clock. His Lordship the
Bishop will be assisted by the Very
Rev. Dean Slattery, the Revs. John
O’Connell, Eugene McCarthy, Wil-
liam Finn, J. Woods and P. Fitzgib-
bon. The chloir will sing selections
from Mozart’s Mass No. 12. The
Dedication sermon will be preached
by the Very Rev. Dr. Shiel, Ballarat.
A collection will be made at the
doors to liquidate the debt of the
church.”


SOLEMN DEDICATION AND OPENING OF ALL SAINTS
Now we come to a description of
events on the great day itself. The
“Guardian” of April 8, 1862 —two days
after the opening—gives a condensed
account, with a promise of full details
in the next issue.
“Portland Guardian,” April 8, 1862:
“Solemn Dedication of All Saints’
Church. On Sunday last All Saints’
Church was crowded by those anxious
to witness the dedication of that place
of worship. This solemn rite was per-
formed by the Catholic Bishop of
Melbourne. His Lordship afterwards
celebrated High Mass, assisted by the
Rev. gentlemen who accompanied him
to Portland, and the Rev. Mr. O’Con-
nell, the resident clergyman. The ser-
mon was preached by the Rev. Dr.
Shiel, of Ballarat, from the 16th verse,
10th chapter of the Gospel of St.
John. A collection towards the clear-
ing of the debt was made at the door,
and amounted to £73. As an indi-
cation of the tolerant spirit which
prevails in Portland, it may be men-
tioned that a large portion of the
amount was contributed by persons
unconnected with the Roman Catholic
Church. A more detailed account will
appear in our next issue.”
This fuller account appeared in the
same paper on April 10, 1862: —
Opening of All Saints’ Church
“This interesting ceremonial was
carried out in its entirety on Sun-
day last. In the past month the
workmen were busily engaged in
bringing the interior to completion.
Sunday morning dawned ere their
labours were completed. The cere-
monies of the day commenced at a
quarter-past ten o’clock by a pro-
cession issuing from the sacristy in
the following order: Cross bearer,
acolytes, master of ceremonies and
the clergy, followed by the Bishop.
Having proceeded around the church,
the procession entered the tower
porch. Having arrived at the altar,
the Litanies were recited and the
church solemnly dedicated to God un-
der the title of All Saints. Imme-
diately on the Dedication service be-
ing ended, the laity were admitted
within the sacred precincts of the
church. At the lowest estimate 800
persons of all denominations were
seated to witness the opening. The
collectors, on whom the onus of all
arrangements depended, discharged
their duties with satisfaction to all.
About eleven o’clock Pontifical High
Mass was chanted by the Bishop of
Melbourne, who was celebrant. The
Very Rev. Dean Slattery (Warrnam-
bool) acted as assistant priest, the
Rev. J. O’Connell as deacon, the Rev.
W. M. Finn as sub-deacon, and the
Rev. Eugene McCarthy (Belfast) as
master of ceremonies. The Revs.
Woods and Fltzgibbon (Adelaide)
were unavoidably absent.
“We here may remark in passing
that the vestments worn by the
Bishop and by some of the other
clergy, were the production of Misses
Birmingham and Finn, residents of
the district.
“At the last gospel, the Very Rev.
D. Shiel ascended the altar, and in
his accustomed persuasive style, de-
livered an energetic appeal suitable
to the solemn occasion. A very ef-
ficient choir, consisting principally
of ladies and gentlemen connected
with the Portland Philharmonic So-
ciety, who, in the kindest manner
possible, volunteered their services,
performed Mozart’s sublime Twelfth
Mass most ably.
"In the evening, at seven o’clock,
the church was again crowded. Ves-
pers, sermon and Benediction com-
menced about half-past six o’clock.
The choir again attended. Thus
ended a ceremony which will long
live in the memory of those who
had the pleasure of witnessing it.
A collection made at the door, in
aid of the Building Fund, realised
£73.”
DESCRIPTION OF THE CHURCH
Then follows a description of the
new church: “The new church oc-
cupies one of the best positions in
Portland, being built on an emin-
ence commanding a splendid view of
the bay. With respect of the build-
ing of the church, many clergymen
have taken various parts in its erec-
tion, but it has fallen to the lot of
the present pastor, the Rev. John
O’Connell, by his zeal and untiring
energy, to finish the building so far
as to have it opened. We must here
remark that the walls of the church
have been erected for some time
from plans brought by the Bishop
from England. It then only re-
quired the roof and all the interna]
fittings to be < carried out, a work
which has been efficiently performed
from plans prepared by Mr. J. B.


Denny, of Melbourne, and to whose
ability as an architect we must ac-
cord our meed of praise, bringing
with him to Victoria the prestige of
being a successful pupil of the great
Gothic master, Pugin.
“The church is built in the style
of the 13th century. It consists of
nave, chancel, tower (partially built),
porch and sacristy. The walls are
built of bluestone, with bluestone
floriated tracery in the windows.
The roof of the nave is con-
sructed of the best Baltic timber 1 *
The principals spring from stone cor-
bels built into the walls, upon which
the punchions rest with arched ribs
and cross braces, collar beams, pur-
lins and rafters all stop-champered
and terminated with a Gothic cornice
moulding. The interior of the roof is
covered with boards laid diagonal-
ly, the whole stained and varnished.
The interior of the chancel roof is
octagonal, boarded and panelled with
moulded ribs and cornice mould. The
doors are l framed and covered with
cedar hoards and hung with floriated
wrought-iron hlinges of most curious
workmanship of colonial manufac-
ture. The fittings of the church are
carried out with style of the build-
ing, and the decorations of the altar
produce a most harmonious effect.
The whole of the work has been ably
superintended by Mr. Nicholson, the
local architect.”*
It would seem that Fr. O’Connell,
during his two years at Portland, had
been asked by Bishop Goold to at-
tend also to the spiritual wants of the
Catholics in the Hamilton and Cole-
raine districts. Evidence of this is
provided by the record that early in
1861 Fr. O’Connell opened a Catholic
school at Coleraine, and had appointed
Miss Phelan, who had been five years
at Portland, in charge.A A short time
after the opening of the Portland
church, Hamilton was constituted an
independent mission. It was the age
of the great land struggles, when,
after the decline of the goldfields, the
new immigrant population were agi-
tating for the breaking up of the
great pastoral estates. By various
Land Acts,, an effort was made to cut
up the country into thousands of
small farms. It was not wholly suc-
cessful, but many Catholic families
settled on the land in these years.
This may account for the cutting off
of Hamilton as a separate parish from
Portland. Fr. O’Connell was appointed
its first pastor in 1862.
A few years prior to his appoint-
ment to Portland Miss M. McKillop
and her sister, Annie', had been teach-
ing in the parish Catholic school here
(1861-1864).
THE McKILLOPS
The Rev. George O’Neill, S.J., in
his “Life of Mother Mary of the
Cross,” states: “The first place cul-
tivated and inhabited by white men
in Victoria, Portland, after some
twenty years of existence and pro-
gress, found its leadership in the new
colony disputed by its younger rival,
Melbourne, and after some twenty
years had to resign itself to helpless
defeat. Its commercial failure, how-
ever, could never deprive it of the
natural attractions that maintain its
popularity to this day as a seaside
residence and resort. Above its long,
firm sandy beach rise rocky bluffs,
and upon these stand to-day, together
with an ugly (?) church, a handsome
convent and school building belong-
ing to the Loreto nuns; this building
has grown out of a house once oc-
cupied by the McKillops. A small
decayed building with some traces of
architectural pretensions is still stand-
ing. This was once the Catholic par-
ish chapel and school. Here for some
three years (1861-1864) was the scene
of Mary McKillop’s labours as a
teacher.
The lady here referred to was later
to be known far and wide as Mother
Mary of the Cross, who, in conjunc-
tion with Fr. Edmund Julian Teni-
son Woods, parish priest of Penola
in 1857, founded the great teaching
Order of religious known as the Sis-
ters of St. Joseph. In those times
Mary had charge of the altar decorat-
"During' Fr. O’Connell’s pastorate,
Mr. James Blair donated thfe large
painting of Van Dyke’s “Crucifixion,”
by M. Farrasyn, of Antwerp. Mr.
Blair also donated a new pulpit in
1863, costing £5l, and constructed in
Portland.


ing and never grew tired of praying
in this little chapel. In addition to
her school duties, she tried to man-
age a boarding house and to generally
help her unpractical father in raising
funds for the support of the family.
A full story is told in Fr. O’Neill’s
book, to which we must refer the
reader.
PRIESTS OF THE SIXTIES
Fr. James Galvin Williams became
pastor in August, 1862. He had an ad-
venturous career. A native of Tralee,
Ireland, and a cousin of Thomas and
John Finn, of Portland, he was bom
in 1832 and entered All Hallows’ Col-
lege, Dublin, in 1848, where he com-
pleted his course before setting out
for the scene of his - labours in 1855.
Bishop Carew, of Madras, India, or-
dained him and appointed him to the
Catholic College of that city. Here
he remained until the Indian Mutiny
broke out in 1857, and Fr. Williams
was appointed chaplain to the British
troops. He was in the thick of seve-
ral engagements and was severely
wounded. His health broke down and
he was compelled to leave India and
come to Australia. His health im-
proved, and he served at different
times in Melbourne and Ballarat and
Portland. He was present at Port-
land when Fr. Julian T. Woods re-
ceived Mrs. John Finn (Mary Mc-
Kenzie) into the Church on March
17, 1863.
It is of interest to note a visit paid
by Fr. Julian T. Woods, of Penola,
to Portland in February, 1865. A
local paper thus comments on this
subject: “The Reverend J. E. Tenni-
son Woods delivered the first of the
course of his long-promised lectures
on Friday evening last in Hogan’s As-
sembly Room, and both interesting
and instructive it proved. The sec-
ond and last in the series will be
delivered this evening in the same
place, and promises to be more in-
teresting than the first.” The first
lecture dealt chiefly with the district
of Portland as forming a part in the
chain of volcanoes stretching over the
southern part of the Australian con-
tinent and including Mts. Gambier,
Schank, Napier, Rouse and Buniyong,
all of which exhibit unmistakable evi-
dence of having at one time been in
active operation, long before and af-
ter the continent emerged from the
ocean. This evening the lecture will
go into more detail, the marine or
stratified rocks to be found in the
district forming the subject.”
Fr. P. A. Courtnes, who came from
Ballarat, was parish priest of Port-
land from June, 1863, to May, 1864.
He was followed by Fr. Patrick Rior-
dan, who was pastor from October,
1864, to October, 1866, when he was
appointed to Williamstown. One who
knew something of his work at Port-
land states that “He quickly won the
devotedness of his flock. He was a
cultured missioner, and undertook the
task of training a choir of singers
both for Mass and Vespers. There
was a good deal of musical talent in
Portland in those days and a musical
society was formed for mutual recrea-
tion between Catholics and non-Cath-
olics alike. They gladly gave their
assistance to Fr. Riordan in training
his choir. One of their studies was
the ‘Music of Mozart’s Twelfth Mass,’
which, according to my mother, was
most creditably rendered. She, in
after years, trained her family to sing
at Vespers.” During his pastorate,
Bishop Goold visited the parish in
1866 to open the new church at Hey-
wood.
The pastorate of the next priest,
Rev. Thomas Neville, was brief—
from November, 1867, to June, 1868.
On his transfer from Portland, he
was appointed parish priest of Wil-
liamstown. During his stay at All
Saints’ he was active in advancing
the interests of the parish school.
Then followed a priest from one
of the old Catholic families of the
Highlands of Scotland, noted for their
tenacity to their faith in the dark
Penal days, Rev. Duncan McNabb.

Closely related to him was Mary
McKillop, the co-foundress of our
Josephite nuns. In his zeal for souls,
Fr. McNabb had a good deal in
common with his distinguished cousin,
M. McKillop. In fact, his zeal for
the aborigines, whose sad state he
heard of in Rome, prompted his com-
ing to Australia in the first place.
He was in charge at Portland from
June, 1867 to July, 1871.
Fr. McNabb was a fluent Gaelic
speaker, and in later years, about 1879,
when he returned for a while to the
Western District from his labours
among the aborigines, was especi-
ally sunmmoned to Mullagh Station,
near Harrow, to administer the Sac-
raments to a dying Highlander, who
knew little English.
We read in Cardinal Morans His-
tory of the Catholic Church in Aus-
tralia of Fr. McNabb’s wanderings
among the aboriginals in 1875, 1876,
and 1878 in Northern Queensland— at
Mackay, Moorochie, Durandar, Kilcoy
and Collington districts, as well as
at Bribie Island, and of his return to
Brisbane in June, ’7B, utterly worn
out and in his 59th year. It must
have been about this time that he
revisited Victoria, for he visited the
home of Mr. M. F. Kelley, of Hor-
sham, at Cadden’s flat near Balmoral
about the year 1879. .
Cardinal Moran also mentioned
that when, on June 4, 1880, Bishop
Gibney of Perth, left Derby, W.A.,
to select a site for a mission station
in the interior, his party on June 17
reached Fr. McNabb’s deserted mis-
sion station.
Fr. McNabb’s successor was an
Italian, Fr. Bassetto, who had been
on the Indian Mission before coming
to Australia. He remained at Port-
land only from April to September,
1871. He was a venerable figure with
his long flowing beard. Fr. J. D.
O’Sullivan, 1871-1873, followed: an
energetic priest during his two years
here. On one occasion a little fric-
tion occurred between the teacher—
a Mr. Burke—and himself, arising from
his insistence on stricter discipline in
the school.
On the occasion of the farewell to
Fr. O’Sullivan many expressed regret
that the priests were so frequently
being transferred. The average stay
of all the previous priests had been
less than two years.
Fr. R. Scanlon took charge of Port-
land parish in July, 1873. He took a
keen interest in ,all parish matters,
being especially interested in the
young people. He was an excellent
horseman, and travelled far and wide
collecting for parish funds to reduce
the debt. Transferred from Portland
in 1875, he was appointed parish priest
of Clunes, and later was parish priest
of St. Amaud.
NEW DIOCESE OF BALLARAT
During Fr. Scanlon’s time here,
Portland ceased to be attached . to
Melbourne, and now became a parish
of the new diocese of Ballarat, which
was created in 1874. Dr. O Connor
was appointed its first Bishop. He
was consecrated in Rome, May 17,
1874. He was succeeded in turn by
Dr. Moore, Dr. Higgins, Dr. Foley,
and Dr. O’Collins, the present zealous
and energetic Bishop. Dr. O Collins is
our first Australian-born Bishop to
occupy this See. The year following the
creation of the new Diocese, Dr.
O’Connor appointed Fr. O’Farrell as
parish priest to Portland. He was
the fifteenth pastor. Fr. O’Farrell
arrived here in July, 1875. He took
an active interest in the parish school,
and was a very strict disciplinarian.
He afterwards became parish priest
of Horsham.
So difficult was it for Bishop
O’Connor to secure priests for his
new Diocese, the distant parish of
Portland was without a permanent
pastor for a whole year. From Fr.
O’Farrell’s departure in 1877 until the
permanent appointment in 1878 of Fr.
O’Donoghue, priests from Ballarat
supplied here, amongst them Dr.
O’Connor himself, and Rev. J. Moore,
who was afterwards to succeed Dr.
O’Connor as Bishop.


An old resident relates that on
some Sundays during that year there
was no Mass, and she remembers her
parents gathering the household for
Sunday prayers. It would appear,
too, that the school was temporarily
closed; probably owing to the in-
ability to secure a teacher.
THE PATRIARCH OF PORTLAND
In the long line of Portland’s
pioneer priests we come to one whose
memory is enshrined in the hearts
of many who are still living—the
Rev. John O’Donoghue (1878-1900).
This untiring and zealous priest
arrived in Australia at an opportune
moment when Bishop O’Connor was
so much in need of priests to staff
his new Diocese. Appointed to Port-
land in 1878, he laboured incessantly
throughout this large parish for
twenty-two years. He was a well-
known figure in his travel-stained
buggy, journeying as far afield as the
South Australian border.
John O’Donoghue was bom in Ire-
land, and when a young man joined
the British Army and served as a
soldier for some time in India. While
there, he showed his mettle by re-
fusing to attend the Protestant ser-
vice, which was then compulsory for
all on Sundays. For this, he was
severely punished. On the next occa-
sion, he again refused, and was doubly
punished. This went on for some
time, till representations were made
through some Catholic Bishop to the
Imperial Government. The result
was the abolition of the obnoxious
regulation. His relatives at home
then “bought” John out of the army,
and he, returning to Ireland, decided
to study for the priesthood. He was
eventually ordained in August, 1860,
at All Hallows College, Dublin, for
the Diocese of Melbourne. He
laboured, however, for some years as
a missionary in India, before coming
to Australia. His name appears in
1874 as one of the priests stationed
at Ballarat.
During his first year in Portland
Fr. O’Connor arranged to have a new
church built at Condah, which was
then in Portland parish, and, in
April, 1879, it was blessed and opened
by Bishop O’Connor. Unhappily, the
church was destroyed by fire in 1901.
A fine wooden church was erected
at a cost of £4OO in the following
year. Condah was, in 1895, detached
from Portland, and is now part of
Hamilton parish.
In the year after his arrival a new
belfry 36 feet high was constructed
and erected in the church grounds.
It was moved in 1942 to a more suit-
able position beside the church.
The years 1883 and 1884 were very
busy and creative years for Fr.
O’Donoghue. He arranged to have
a church built at Digby for the scat-
tered families there, and in May, 1884,
it was blessed and opened by Bishop
O’Connor’s successor, Bishop Moore.
Bishop O’Connor died the previous
year—February, 1883.
The year 1884 made history for
the Catholic Church in Portland.
Thomas Guilfoyle, the first Portland
boy to become a priest, was ordained
in Ballarat on December 21, 1884, by
Dr. Moore.
Fr. O’Donoghue was a zealous,
kindly, and beloved priest during his
twenty-two years’ residence in Port-
land. During his pastorate and just
before the donor’s death in 1884, Mr.
Owen O’Reilly, a wealthy squatter of
Mount Rowan and an early resident
of the Portland district, gave £l3OO
for the erection of a spire for the
Portland church. The iron for the
spire was ordered from the Castle-
maine Foundry, and was sent along
in parts, ready for erection. Fr.
O’Donoghue was a generous benefac-
tor and friend of the Loreto Sisters.
He died at his post of duty on Sep-
tember 2, 1900, in the fortieth year
of his ministry. The people called
him “The Patriarch of Portland.”


LORETO CONVENT
Towards the end of 1884 a house was
secured in Bentinck Street for the
Loreto Nuns, and Mother Gonzaga
Barry and four nuns arrived here
December 27, 1884.
This convent is indebted to Bishop
James Moore for its foundation, but
its inspiration was probably the work
of his predecessor, Bishop O’Connor.
A house was secured in Bentinck
Street on a fine site overlooking the
Bay, within easy reach of the beach,
Mother Gonzaza Barry and five mem-
bers of the Loretto Abbey, Ballarat,
left for Portland on December 27,
1884. The convent, a six-roomed cot-
tage with a lean-to at the back cou-
sisting of a small room and a kitchen,
had to be adapted to its future re-
quirements, and during the hours
between devotions and recreations
the Sisters occupied themselves re-
arranging the rooms, papering, paint-
ing, etc.
During the holidays, Sisters re-
quiring change of air, came to spend
a fortnight or three weeks at the sea,
and, of course, the new arrivals
necessitated additional accommoda-
tion. The convent was built on the
site, and around the original home
of Alexander McKillop, the father of
Mother Mary McKillop. The sanc-
tuary of the present convent chapel
was one of the rooms in the Mc-
Killop’s house.
The Loretto Sisters took over the
conduct of the parish school from
the lay teachers in January, 1885.
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
REV. J. J. WALSH (1900-1906)
Rev. John J. Walsh succeeded Fr.
O’Donoghue in September, 1900. Dur-
ing his six years in Portland he was
noted for his zeal and devotion to
duty. Of a retiring disposition, he
did not take part in public affairs.
During his term, a new brick wing
was added to Loreto Convent.
On his transfer from Portland he
was appointed in charge of Penshurst
parish and later was in Creswick.
In 1916 he waS made parish priest ot
Birregurra, where he died in Sep-
tember, 1944, at the age of 86. He
celebrated his golden jubilee some
years ago.
REV. T. P. LYNCH (1906-1911)
Fr. Lynch was assistant at Ararat
before coming to Portland. He re-
mained here five years. Subsequently
he was appointed to Warracknabeal,
where he was responsible for the
erection of the magnificent two-storied
brick Convent of Mercy. Later he
was parish priest of Penshurst. His
health breaking, he retired from
parish duties and died in Melbourne
about twelve years ago.
REV. W. CAIN (1911-1941)
Rev. W. Cain followed Fr. Lynch
in 1911 as Portland’s nineteenth pas-
tor. A native of Listowel, County
Kerry Fr. Cain received his educa-
tion at St. Michael’s College in his
native town and at St. Brendans
Seminary, Killamey. After the com-
pletion of his studies at Maynooth he
was ordained priest for the Diocese
of Kerry. Soon after his ordination
he volunteered for service under
Bishop Moore of Ballarat (a fellow-
countryman), and came to Australia
with the intention of remaining for a
limited term. He afterwards decided
to remain permanently in the Ballarat
Diocese, and was stationed at Charl-
ton, Colac and Hamilton. While at
Colac in the year 1899, he celebrated
the first Masses at Cororooke, in the
old St. Brendan’s Church; at Bara-
munga (entrance to Beech Forest),
at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Conway;
at Beech Forest, at the home of Mr
and Mrs. Jack Gardiner; and at
Johanna River, at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. William Hamshire.
During Fr. Cain’s term at Portland
in 1934 a fine brick schoolroom was


built, a valuable addition to the
primary school was erected in 1934
at a cost of £9OO. In his long pas-
torate during which he had but one
holiday to his native land, no figure
was better known and respected by
residents and visitors alike than that
of Fr. Cain. He was a good friend
to the Loretto Sisters, to the visiting
members of other religious Orders,
to the poor, the sick, and, above all,
to the children. Fr. Cain retired in
1941 and lives privately at Portland,
overlooking the Southern Ocean.
APPENDICES
The old Baptismal register of St.
Francis’ Church, Melbourne, contains
the earliest record of the Baptism of
a Portland child. The child was bap-
tized at Melbourne.
The child was John Carrell, son of
Michael Carrell and Kitty Howard, of
Portland. He was born 17/12/1842,
and was baptized on 11/2/1844, by Fr.
P. B. Geoghegan, the sponsor being
Alice Fitzgibben.
One remaining Baptism omitted
from the list of Baptisms performed
at Portland during the visit of Dr.
Polding is that of Bridget Rebecca
Taylor, daughter of Robert Taylor
and Mary Willis. She was born in
December, 1842, and was baptized by
Fr. McEvey on the 6/11/1844. The
sponsors were John Flood and Mary
Kelly.

We shall now take the liberty of
jumping nine years, and of coming
to the year 1857.
On January 4 of that year, Jull^ n
Edmund Tenison Woods, a very re-
markable man, was ordained to the
Priesthood, by Dr. Francis Murphy,
the first Bishop of Adelaide, and on
March 19 following, was appointed
in charge of the immense parish ot
Penola, South Australia, whose ter-
ritory extended from the Murray to
the ocean, and took in a tract
of Western Victoria. This latter ad-
dition was due to request from the
Bishop of Melbourne that he should,
for a year, minister to the Catholics
in that area.
Through the kindness of the Very
Rev. Father Thompson, the present
pastor of Narracoorte, I have been
supplied with a list of Baptisms per-
former by Father Woods in the West-
ern district of Victoria,, and which
are recorded in the old Penola regis-
ter. From this we learn that on
April 24, 1857, less than five weeks
after his arrival at Penola, Father
Woods, at Woodford, baptized John,
the infant son of Mr. and Mrs. Wil-


liam O’Brien. We also note that on
January 7. 1858, he baptized Charles
Edward (significant name), son of
Donald McPherson Cameron and Ann
Macgregor, of Alcove Station, near
Portland, at the Alcove Station. The
sponsor was Marcelly MacKenzie.
Another record shows that on De-
cember 5, 1858, at Henswood Station,
Victoria, he baptized a three-year-old
girl—Catherine—daughter of Patrick
Hennessy and Mary Dwyer. By far
the greater number of his Baptisms
were administered at Eldersley, Aps-
ley, and Edenhope districts.
On his trips to Portland, Father
Woods used at times to pass through
Casterton, Coleraine, and Murndai
Station. The latter was then held by
the Winters —Sam, Pratt, and Trevor,
Irish Protestants but very friendly
with the missionary. In fact, he was
a welcome guest at the homes of all
the squatters. He used sometimes
go from Penola to Mt. Gambier and
thence via Dartmoor, or Hotspur to
Portland, via Heywood.
We must here record the impres-
sion made by Father Julian T. Woods
on Mr. Bonwick, an Inspector of
Schools, who met the priest shortly
after his ordination. “As an inspec-
tor I had to visit the R.C. schools, as
well as the Protestant ones. It was
after inspecting the Portland school
that I met at the table of the local
Catholic clergyman one of the most
accomplished men I ever saw. Father
Woods won the respect and admir-
ation of men, from the field toiler
to the Governor. His conversation
was simply fascinating. His know-
ledge seemed universal. He played
the piano with skill and sang ex-
pressively. But his genuine good-
ness, his love for his fellows, his
devotion to duty, were equally ap-
parent. I never was so charmed
with any man. This was in 1857,
and we corresponded for years after.”
THE PORTLAND CATHOLIC SCHOOL
List of teachers and some general
remarks.
1849.—Spoken of by Dr. Goold as
being much required. It was estab-
lished in May by Father Stephens.
Teacher: Miss Rosanna Phillipina
Quinn, who received the Government
salary of £25 per annum, plus school
fees at the rate of sixpence per week
for each child. The school was
opened in the chapel and, at the end
of the year, the average attendance
was between 25 and 30.
1851.—From the report of Inspector
Childers, who visited the school on
February 7, 1851, we have the fol-
lowing details: The school was held
in a small wooden house in Gawler
Street, which was rented at £l2 per
annum. There were two rooms, 14
ft. x 10 ft., and 10 ft. x 10 ft. Boys
numbered 13 and girls 23. Of the
boys, eight were infants, and of the
girls, eleven. Names of some of the
children are mentioned: —Carroll—2;
Dean—2; Fahey—3; and Hooley—3.
(Later on we shall add a note re-
garding one of the Hooley family
here mentioned.) The teacher’s name
is given as Rosanna Quinn, who had
previously been governess in a pri-
vate school at Portland. “Last quar-
ter,” the report states, "she received
the Government aid of £7/10/-, and
school fees £B/10/. Father Roe, who
took great interest in the school,
stated that the chapel had been in-
tended for a school, and that if a
larger church was erected (which
was not likely) it would still be
used as such.
1852. —ln July the teacher was Miss
Mosiamo Nine, but then Nicholas
Byrne took charge.
1853. N. Byrne, the teacher.
1854. —Byrne remained till January.
In February Miss Ellen McElligott
was appointed, and was principal till
September of that year. In October,
Martin J. Phelan took over the boys
and Miss McElligott retained charge
of the girls, though in a very short
time she was replaced by Miss Jo-
hanna Phelan, sister of thle master.
1855. There was an average at-
tendance of 90 children. Phelan, the
master.
1856. —Attendance in March is 61.
1857—Phelan in charge.
1858. —Still the same teacher. In-
spector Bonwick writes: ‘A good
school, with a suitable master —a
well-educated and steady man.”
1859. —The school is a large brick
room. Books are deficient.
1861. —Phelan resigned, in August,
and William Flannagan is appointed.
In December, Inspector Miller states:
‘‘Flannagan is untrained, but is a
fair teacher and is ably assisted by
his sister. The schoolroom is of
brick, 60 ft. x 20 ft., and cleanly
kept.
1862. —On the 11/8/62, the local com-
mittee: Rev. J. O’Connell, J. Blair,
J.P., J. B. Fitzgerald, Thomas Finn
and Thomas Smith.
1863. —ln January, the school is
mentioned as being in Drew or Yew
Street. In this year a Mr. Cusack


was in charge, having as his assist-
ants, Mary and Annie McKillop.
1864. —Cusack, the teacher.
1865. —Cusack still there. Average
attendance 97, according to Venables,
Inspector of Common Schools.
1866^—Mr Renehan, teacher, as-
sisted by his wife. Inspector Geary
savs in report: “Sound and useful
education is given, with due atten-
tion to morals and manners. The
average attendance is 80 in winter,
and 100 in summer.” We read that
in April, Father Riordan gave a te f
party in the schoolroom, and that,
on its conclusion, dancing was in-
dulged in by the adults.
1867. —Renehan, teacher. A ball was
held this year in aid of the school
library, M. J. Phelan, Sec. Profit,
£25.
1868. —Renehan, teacher.
1869. —Still same teachers. Their
little daughter read the address o
welcome to Dr. Goold on May 16,
when he came for Confirmation.
1870. —Renehan in charge, but ap-
parently resigned towards the end
of the year.
1871. —From this year, on to 187 8,
our knowledge of the names of
teachers is very vague, as no reli-
able records exist to guide us We
know that in Father O Sullivan s
time —September, 1871, to December,
1872 a Mr. Burke was the teacher.
With him the pastor had a dispute,
which caused much trouble, a mat-
ter to which we have referred else-
where.
1872.' The next teachier was prob-
ably a man named Howard. He and
Burke afterwards had little Private
schools of their own in the country.
1874.— During these four or five years
the following taught at different
times, but in what order we cannot
now discover; Miss Julia Minogue
Mrs. John Sutton, of
Dismal Swamp, S.A.), MiBs M ® dW m£og’
Miss Mary A. Buckley, Mr.
(afterwards Rev. Father) Guilfoyle,
Miss Maria O’Brien.
1877 —From March of this year, the
school was closed, and remained
shut till it was re-opened by Father
O’Donogttue.
1878. —On re-opening, Miss Carroll,
assisted by Miss Staritt, wer* the
teachers. Children numbered 35. The
attendance subsequently inc £® ased *°
49, and 15 to 20 others were ex-
pected.
1879. —During this ye ar >. and the
first quarter of 1880, William Car-
roll was the principal teacher. The
attendance was 87 In March, 188 ,
Mr. Carroll resigned to take charge
of the Hamilton Catholic School. He
was presented with a gold ring
his departure.
1881. —Miss Staritt, the head teacher,
The Speech Day was observed before
the Christmas holidays; “ concluded
with a “party” /given by Father
O’Donoghue.
As far as we can ascertain, Miss
Staritt remained in charge till the
end of 1884. The nuns took over at
the beginning of 1885.
SOME PROMINENT CATHOLICS IN EARLY PORTLAND
BLAIR: James Blair, an Irishman,
was appointed Police Mafi.faW at
Portland on August 13, 1840.
is known of his early life; only dist-
ant connections of his are now living,
and they are scattered over England
Ireland and Prance. He married
Miss Margaret Lomasney, of Dub in.
There were six children, none of
whom now survive. Blair came to
Australia in 1834, and was appointed
Clerk of the Bench at Bung Bong,
N S W» on November 4, 1836. He was
made a J.P. in 1838 and, soon after,
P.M. for a district between Sydney
and Bathurst, and came to Port Phil-
lip in 1840. He arrived in Portland
by the Prince George on October 31,
and remained here as Police Mag s-
trate for twenty-three years. A just
but severe, man, he ruled with the
proverbial rod of iron,, and practically
single-handed, kept law and order
among the rough and lawless popu-
lation of the ’forties. Besides his
official position, he was Guardian of
Minors, Clerk of the Court of Re-
quests, Commissioner of Grown
Lands, Normanby; Director of the
local Union Bank In 1844 he went
into pastoral ventures, and purchased
Clunie Station, near Harrow. He left
no diary or documents of great his-
torical value. Thus writes Noel
Bearmonth. in his “Portland Bay
Settlement.” . ~ ~
George Kelley, father of Mr. M.
p. Kelley, of Horsham, was Blair s
manager at Clunie in the fifties.
Another son of Mr Kelley, George
was born at Clunie, and baptized
there by Father Rankin. Two of
Blair’s children were baptized by
Archbishop Polding, at Portland, in
1844, another daughter was chris-
tened by Father R. Walsh, from Gee-
long, in 1846, and a son, James, by
Father Kavanagh.


Some persons, qualified to have an
opinion, say that Blair was not him-
self a Catholic, though all are agreed
that his wife and children were de-
vout ones. We are told that the
Blair family occupied the front seat
on the Gospel side of All Saints’
Church, and the Finns the corres-
ponding one on the Epistle side. A
beautiful large pulpit of rare wood,
beautifully carved, and adorned with
the figure of an eagle with wings
outstretched which acted as a book-
stand, and imported, it is said, from
Venice, was presented by the Blair
and Finn families to All Saints’. This
pulpit, somewhat altered in size, is
still in use. Blair also presented a
large painting on canvas of the Cru-
cifixion. (One correspondent has
stated that he was the donor, too,
of the Belfry, 36 feet high, which
was completed on September 2, 1879,
but this must be incorrect, for a
press note of June 28, 1879, states
that a collection was taken up in
the church for the Belfry.)
Blair’s name appears associated
with matters pertaining to the
Church for many years. As trustee
for Church property, member of the
Catholic School committee, as one of
the parishioners in the farewell ad-
dress to Father O’Connell, perhaps,
after all, he may have been a
member of the Church. We note,
also, that one of the two marriages
performed, in 1844, by Archbishop
Polding’s companion, Fath/er McEvey,
was that of Thomas Finn and Sarah
Blair. Possibly the latter was a
sister of the Police Magistrate,
though this is but a supposition.
However this may be, the Blair fam-
ily are deserving of remembrance by
the succeeding generations of Port-
land Catholics.
THE FINNS: The name was well
known in early Portland. Many not
related by blood bore the name.
Thus, in 1853, a Margaret Finn —
birthplace unknown —married Thomas
Hickey. In 1855, Mary Finn, from
Co. Wicklow, married Henry Hopkins.
In 1856, Elizabeth Finn, from the
same County (perhaps a sister of the
latter), married Charles Baker. Again,
in 1856, Hanora Finn, from Co. Tippe-
rary, married Michael Carroll. In
1862, Margaret Finn, from Co. Lim-
erick, married John McGinnis. Our
knowledge of all these goes further.
There was, however, another branch
of this name, originated from Co.
Kerry, of whom we know a great
deal more. The original head of this
line, John, with his wife (nee Mary
Gallivan) and eight children, arrived
in Australia from Co. Kerry, Ireland,
in 1839, and settled at Hartly,
N.S.W. John died in 1842; his wife
lived till 1884. Their children were
Thomas, Michael, Mary, Ellen, Mar-
garet, John, Julia and {Patrick.
Of this family of eight, four mem-
bers came to reside at Portland. The
first-named Thomas;, who joined the
Police force, was appointed Chief
Constable here, and arrived by the
“Sally Ann” in September, 1842. In
1852 he married Sarah McDowell, and
had a family of two sons and one
daughter. In after years, Thomas
retired from the Force, became a
law clerk at Portland, and always
was an exemplary Catholic and an
energetic assistant of the priest in
charge.
Two of his sisters were persuaded
to follow their eldest brother and to
come hither. They were Mary and
Ellen. The former afterwards be-
came the wife of Edmund Kirby, and
the mother of six children. Ellen
married James Kirby and had seven
children. Margaret came also to this
district, and found a husband in
Maurice Cussen. Of their seven chil-
dren, two became nuns, a son a
doctor, and another son afterwards
became Justice Cussen.
A younger brother of Thomas Finn,
John, a draper by profession, soon
joined his relatives at Portland.
Here he married Mary McKenzie,
child of a strict Presbyterian family.
Seven years after the marriage was
solemnised, and mainly through the
human instrumentality of Father Ju-
lian Woods, she joined the Church of
her husband. P’or years she was,
by correspondence, under the spi-
ritual direction of Father Woods, and
when 'worries and illness laid low
this great .missionary, Mrs. John Finn
remained to the end one of his most
faithful friends. The reader will find
much concerning her in Father
O’Neill’s life of Father Julian Ed-
mund Woods. This family went
from Portland to Clunes, from the
latter place to Hawthorn, and, fin-
ally, to Randwick, Sydney. The mor-
tal remains of John Finn, and those
of his wife, lie in Waverley cemetery,
close to the grave of their friend,
Father Woods.
From what we have written, we
can infer that all these good people
of the Finn families were prominent
in Church affairs at Portland in the
days of old.
THE FITZGERALDS were closely
related to the Finns above-mentioned,
being first cousins. They, too, hailed
from County Kerry, and came to
Australia a few years before their
cousins. Indeed, the Finns came at
the suggestion and on the advice of
the Fitzgeralds. Of this latter fam-
ily, John lived at Midwood, near

PARISHIONERS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN OF PORTLAND TO-DAY


Hey wood; Brian at Portland where
he married Miss Robina Hawkins,
Mary married Thomas Silvester, Jo-
ViQ-nnfi became tbe wife of Thomas
Moore; Jane married William Crouch.
Tulia Fitzgerald was one of the
first companions of Mother Mary
McKillop, together with Miss Blanch
Arnsinck, who was a governess 1
the Fitzgerald family. As we have
said in another place, Mullagh Sta-
tion, near Harrow was for many
years in the possession of the *
gerald family; at this place Mass
was regularly celebrated. The family
were devoted to the Faith and were
most hospitable to the visiting clergy.
Descendants are still in the Harrow
parish and, like their forefathers,
are devout Catholics.
Walter Birmingham and his fam-
ily were connected by marriage with
the Fitzgeralds, and are mentioned
frequently in the Church records as
prominent Church members. Indeed,
two of his daughters were baptized
in 1844, at Portland, by Archbishop
Polding.
There are, of course, numerous
other excellent Catholic families
through the years at P %* lan< i, h ?!
whom we have no details. The
names, let us hope, are written in
the Book of Life. We kn °™
about sixty years ago the Rowing
were well-known among the faithful
there: The Minogues, Guilfoyles, Rat-
lins Bowes, O’Briens, Flynns, Star-
rits’ Duffys, Owens, Buckleys, Ber-
gins Kents, Quinlivans, Sullivans and
Shines. Of these Simon Minogue,
Joh/n Duffy, and John Shine lived at
Cockatoo Valley, some five miles from
Portland. Walter Kent, a road con-
tractor, lived on the Bridgewater
Road, Portland. He was a militant
Irishman, and had a large family,
typical of the time: Patrick, Michael,
Laurie, Jem,. Walter, Tom, Katie,
Stasia, Lizzie and Bridget.
Owens was a surveyor and a pro-
minent member of the church cho •
Owen O’Reilly, the donor of the
church spire, owner of more than
one large property, lived for the
most part at Wando Station, which
adjoined Wando Vale.
From one of the families mentioned
above, that of Guilfoyle came one
who in after years was one of the
most popular and successful P ries t|
of the diocese of Ballarat. Ihom .
Guilfoyle must have been one of th
earliest natives of this State to be
ordained to the priesthood His
father, a road contractor, had th
greatest difficulty in providing the
wherewithal necessary for . , hia s . on . a
education. Indeed, it is said that in
this connection Fr. Robert Scanlon
was a friend indeed. We refer to
Father Thomas Guilfoyle, who at the
time of his death was Administrator
of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Ballarat.
An account of his career, death,
and funeral, taken from the iort-
land Guardian” of September 23rd,
1908, is as follows: —
"In the last issue, force of cir-
cumstances permitted oniy-the brief-
est allusion to the death of the Very
Rev. Thomas Guilfoyle,
place at the old family home, Otway-
street, Portland, at an early hour
on Monday morning. As a native
of Portland, and one who had grown
up and continued practically one of
our residents, the end of his life is
universally regretted. Those who
knew Tom Guilfoyle as a lad will
easily recall to memory the hne,
strapping young chap whose every
inch denoted promise of de X el °P„ l f
into being a big. strong . man }y ™ a " 0
TTrom the top of his curley head to
The soles of his feet, he was of as
fine a physique as anyone could
to meet Possessed of a nature
quiet somewhat reserved, but manly
and thoughtful, he deservedly earned
the respect of all classes of our citi-
zens and it is to his credit that not
only’ were those early associations
retained, but, as advancing years wer
reached, he continued to add to h s
long list of friendships. As a stu-
dent here his career was marked
with every success. His good P ar '
ents and friends were not surprised
on learning of his desire to enter
the ministry of the Catholic Churc .
The necessity for a dva nce d studi s
caused his removal to Adelaide.
(where h e began and continued his
studies at the Seven Hills College,
conducted by the Jesuit Fathers).
“His progress was marked by brn
liant success, and his future career
of a priest was soon considered as-
sured. He was ordained priest by
Bishop Moore at St. Patrick s Cathe
dral Ballarat, in 1885, and appointed
assistant at Colac. He was soon re-
moved and placed in charge, and while
there, in addition to his clerical duties
helped as a teacher at the Catholic
school in that town. There he re-
mained for six years, till his re-
moval in 1899 to Ballarat East, and
shortly afterwards as Administrator
to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. While
there he was the Bishop’s right-ham
man in the erection of, and in rais-
ing funds for, the two splendid
buildings that may now be seen in
the grounds of St. Patrick s, the fin
brick two-storied presbytery an J
beautiful St. Patricks Hall. These
two palatial structures will long re-
main as monuments to Father Guil-
foyle's success as a financier ana an


extremely popular and zealous P r j e ®^ -
Indeed, it may be said that his lab-
ours at this period were mainly the
cause of impairing his health and of
shortening his useful life. For many
years he was chief organiser of the
St. Patrick’s Day Festival, the pro-
fits from which went to maintain
the schools and to defray the cost
of new buildings. He was for some
years Spiritual Director of the Hi-
bernian and Catholic Young Men s
Societies. Father Guilfoyle had broad
views on public matters, and was, in
addition to being a devout, zealous
priest, a hard working citizen, with
a true conception of his duties. In
1896 he was elected a member of the
Benevolent Asylum Committee, and
was president in 1897. In 1897 he
was welcomed as a member of the
Ballarat Hospital Committee, and in
1904 was accorded the honour of the
presidential chair. To both institu-
tions he was a good friend, and his
services were highly appreciated by
his fellow committee men.”
(Note: The correct date of Father
Guilfoyle’s ordination is December
21st, 1884.)
CONDAH
As this church was attended to
for many years by Father O’Dono-
ghue, the following extracts from the
“Portland Guardian” are of interest:
February 15th, 1879: “As the R.C.
church at Condah is now all but
completed, the consecration will not
be long delayed. The building is of
wood, and substantially built; the
roof is of iron, with a quick pitch,
and as the height to the
eaves is at least fourteen
feet, the ventilation is good.
The’ Rev. J. O’Donoghue, of Port-
land, has already celebrated Mass in
the church. When finished, the struc-
ture will have cost £2OO, and it is
not improbable that in time, a school
will be added to the church, as at
present young children in the neigh-
bourhood have a long distance to
travel.”
April 7 th, 1879: “On Sunday last,
March 30 th, the Catholic Church at
Condah was solemnly opened and
blessed by Bishop O’Connor. Ac-
companied by Father O’Donoghue, his
Lordship proceeded to Condah on
Sunday morning from Heywood. He
was met on the road out some miles
by a large number of resident Cath-
olics. The ceremony of blessing the
church commenced at eleven o’clock.
Mass was celebrated by Father
O’Donoghue, at the end of which his
Lordship, taking as his text the
words from the Gospel of St. John,
“He that is of God, heareth: the word
of God,” preached a very elegant and
impressive sermon. He was listened
to with the greatest attention, not
only by members of his own flock,
but by a large number of persons of
other denominations, who were pre-
sent who expressed themselves high-
ly pleased with what they had heard.
There were about 200 persons pre-
sent, several having come from Port-
land, Heywood and Branxholme. The
Catholics of Condah are to be con-
gratulated on having at length a
little church in which they can as-
semble to worship God. The church
is 40 ft. long by 20 ft. wide, quite
large enough for the congregation.
When the ceremony was ended, a
few of the leading gentlemen pre-
sented an address to his Lordship,
congratulating themselves on the
auspicious occasion which) brought
him amongst them for the first time,
and alluding to the kind assistance
they had received from their Pro-
testant friends, to which his Lord-
ship made a very kind and feeling
reply. During his stay at Condah,
Dr. O’Connor was the guest of Mr.
McDonald.”
This church building, together with
the homes of Mr. McDonald and of
dozens of other residents, was de-
stroyed by Are on the disastrous
Black Friday in 1901. The present
church, which cost £4OO, was erected
in 1902, in which year Condah be-
came attached to the parish of
Hamilton.
DIGBY
A ch(urch, now attended from Cas-
terton, was built there in the early
days, and was in charge of the Port-
land pastor. We have not succeeded
in getting any information concern-
ing it, except a note regarding a
Government grant of land for the
purpose.
Mr. Farley, of Digby, was the con-
tractor and builder. The same con-
tractor later built Dartmoor church
in 1899.


HEYWOOD
OPENING OF THE CHURCH BUILDING,
MARCH 11, 1866
••It is seldom that the town of
Heywood exhibits so much life and
bustle as were manifested yesterday
(11th inst.), on the opening of the
Roman Catholic Church,
to St. Gregory the Great. The churcn
i« a small but neat structure, 33
by 20 feet, and 14 feet to
It is substantially s t a ted an< * _ h
lighted, but still unfinished, though
suitable for all the exercise of re-
ligion, and has, we understand up
to this date, cost over £3OO. me
formal opening was rather imposing,
not so much from the nU J^? t erS that
attendance, as from the fact that
his Lordship, the Right R ev * •
Goold, Bishop of Melbourne, and the
Right Rev. Dr. Shiel, Bishop-elect of
Adelaide, with Dean Slattery, of
Warrnambool, and the Rev. P. R °
dan of Portland, were taking part
in ’the ceremony. The church, on
both sides of the entrance doors, was
surmounted by the Union Jack, and
over the door was a red cross and
scroll, with the motto: ‘ln hoc signo
vinces.’ (‘ln this sign shalt thou
conquer.’)
•‘The first part of the ceremony ot
the opening, consisted in a proces-
sion 'around the church. The Bishop,
Dr. Goold, in full canonicals, fol-
lowed by the priests, some assistants
in white, and the congregation, took
part. Certain forms in the ceremony
got through, the procession entered
the church, and there the Bishop
concluded the ceremony. The Rev.
P. Riordan celebrated Mass, and Dr.
Shiel preached a short sermon from
the text: ‘After these things, Jesus
went over the sea of Gallilee, which
is the sea of Tiberias. A great mul-
titude followed Him, because they
saw his miraqles, which he did on
them that were diseased. And Jesus
went up into a mountain and there
he sat with his disciples. ( Tort
land Guardian.”)
Mr. Patrick Lavery, now a resi-
dent of Horsham, and well over 70
years of age, who was born and
reared at Heywood where his father
was a prosperous blacksmith, an ex
Sent trade in those times gives
the following list of the Heywood
r>onereeation in the time of his
youth. (Incidentally he mentions
that the fine, strong iron gates of
the Heywood cemetery, were made
by his father.) His list is:
1. Mrs. Donald Cameron, of Oak-
bank (nee Hughes). She had no
children. Misses Hughes, two elder-
ly aunts, resided with her.
2. Patrick Lavery, who had five
daughters and two sons.
3. James Carracher, contractor, who
had five sons and one daughter.
4. Patrick Bourke, who had four
sons and two daughters.
5 An elderly farmer from Ettrick,
named Fahey, had four sons and two
daughters. So venerable with his
white locks was this gentleman, that
Mrs. Lavery, wife of my informant,
when a very small child, used to
he was Almighty Himself. Two
of his girls became teachers in Port-
land.
6. Pagandi—a farmer at Condah.
7. John Gurry, who had six or
eight children, of Condah, used to
attend before the Condah church was
8. John Sypott, 'of the Hotspur-
road, who had several children, of
whom subsequently lost the faith.
Miss Sypott was for many years
housekeeper for Father ODonoghue.
9. Patrick Desmond, of the Fitz-
rov Hotel, Heywood. His family of
excellent children were: Eleanor,
Mary, Alice, Annie, Katie, John,
Michael and Harry. The girls, who
had been educated at Loreto, con-
ducted the choir. Eleanor afterwards
became Mrs. Angus Cameron, and
with her husband conducted after-
wards the Heywood Hotel.
On Sunday, May 25th, 1884, Bishop
Moore confirmed 63 candidates at
Heywood. There was a large con-
gregation. An address of welcome
was presented to the Bishop.
DARTMOOR
Dartmoor, 40 miles distant, has
been attended from Portland since
the earliest days. A church was not
built there before 1889. Mr Farley,
who built the church at Digby, built
the church at Dartmoor that year.
Prior to the church s erection Mass
was celebrated at the homes of the
local Catholics. The names of the
settled families then were Sullivans,
Conoley, Murphy, Blood, Ross, Black,
O’Donnell, O’Briens, Smith, McPher-
S °ln 6 1909 Bishop Higgins visited
Dartmoor and administered Confir-
mation Dr. O’Collins, very soon
after his appointment to BaUarat
visited Dartmoor and celebrated Mass
there on December 11th, 1942. 1S
intended to completely renovate the
old churchl or probably erect a new
one when conditions make it possible.


SOME CONCLUDING NOTES
LOST AT SEA
In April, 1863, the ship “Lord Rag-
lan” left Liverpool for Australia with
a full complement of passengers. She
was never heard of again. Passing
ships enquired if they had seen her.
The report was that she was burned
at sea, and all hands lost. Amongst
the passengers were Mr. and Mrs.
Creamer, and their throe daughters,
their only other child, John, being
left behind them, thus escaping their
sad fate. Mrs. Creamer was an aunt
of Rev. S. O’Rourke, the present pas-
tor of Portland.
THE SPIRE OF ALL SAINTS'
Owen O’Reilly, on February 15th,
1885, on a visit to Portland, inter-
viewed Father O’Donoghue after
Mass, and offered £lOOO, and more if
necessary, as a contribution towards
the erection of a spire. Three weeks
afterwards his funeral left All Saints’
for the local cemetery. Norwood
Bros., of Castlemaine, got the con-
tract for the erection of the
spire and the work began on Jan-
uary 7th, 1887. The weight was 30
tons, and the height 120 feet from
the ground.
1900. The foundation-stone of a
new wing was laid on April 29th by
the Rev. J. O’Donoghue and the
Mayor, Mr. J. Hanlon. Father
O’Donoghue addressed the audience
assembed for the occasion, but did
not live to see th'e building finished.
1903. An addition to the original
house, corresponding to and con-
nected with, the new wing, was
built. The foundation-stone was
laid on May 24th by the Rev. J.
Walsh, our pastor. This building
enlarged the chapel and provided
extra accommodation for the com-
munity.
1900. A college for litte boys was
established in February, and as
"Seaview” was for sale, it was pur-
chased for the accommodation of the
boys and their matron. Boys from
5 to 10 were taken.
The P. Guardian, of July 11, 1864,
gives a detailed description of the
cedar pulpit presented to All Saints’
by J. Blair, Esq., J.P. Here we must
correct an error made in another sec-
tion of these notes wherein it is
stated that the pulpit was the gift
of th-e Blair and Finn families, and
that it was imported. The facts are
that the pulpit was designed by Mr.
D. Nicholson, architect, of Portland,
and manufactured by Messrs. Stanley
Symonds and John Nancarrow,
cabinet-makers, of the same town.
It was the gift of Mr. Blair and
cost £5l.
Dr. Moore, when Bishop-elect of
Ballarat, accompanied the first body
of five Loreto nuns on their jour-
ney to Portland.

CHURCH LANDS AT PORTLAND
The files of the Lands Department
reveal the following information:—
(1) Application was apparently
made in May 1846 (the year of
ffa th» r R Walshs visit) for auoi
mtntl l 2. 3, 20, <Jf Section 5 in the
Township of Portland, as site “ £or ‘
R.C. school and dwelling. The Col
onial Secretary’s Office, in Sydney,
authorised the appropriation in No
Ve Appaxentl 4 y‘ the land was still un-
appropriated in 1850, when applica-
tion for Deeds of Grant, was made.
Trustees were appointed in August,
1860, the local ones being Joseph
Charles Sumner and Thomas Finn, in
November" 1850, Bishop Goold again
applied for Deeds of Grant.
The present church, presbytery and
school are erected on this land.
(2) Application was made for grant
of two acres, allotments 1, ", 3„ 10,
17 18, 19, 20, in Section 228, in June,
1854. Approval was conveyed on
14/11/54. Application for Deeds of
Grant was made in 1862.
Apparently the Deeds were not is-
sued, for Father J. O Don^J? e
writes in 10/9/79: “There is a Cath-
olic Church reserve of about two
acres (No. 248) adjoining the> rail-
way station at Portland. Part of
this reserve has been taken by the
Department to make a road to the
station. Compensation will not be
given until the Title Deeds are sub-
mitted for alteration. The trustees
of the Church are not aware of any
Title Deeds ever having been issued.


This second grant is facing Fern
Street, and extends from Palmerston
Street to the next street.
This land is still owned by the
Church, and is locally known as the
“Church paddock.” It is situated
near the North Railway Station.
(3) Application for a further two
acres at South Portland was made in
December, 1856, and after some dif-
Acuity about the particular block,
the grant was approved on the
28/3/1857. It was at the S.W. cor-
ner of allotment 46 at South Port-
land. Dr. Fitzpatrick stated that one
acre was intended for a church, half
an acre for a school, and half an
acre for a clergyman’s residence.
This land, though still unfenced,
remains Church property.
A MOTHER'S LETTER TO HER CHILDREN
The following letter, which is fam-
ous among Loreto past pupils, was
written by Reverend Mother Mary
Gonzaga Barry, Foundress and First
Provincial of the Australian Province
of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin
Mary, who died on March 5, 1915. She
was the foundress of the Portland
Convent, and used to write each year
for the school magazine, “Loreto
Eucalyptus Blossoms,” a letter ad-
dressed to all her children. This
farewell letter was written on her
death-bed to past and present pupils:
Loreto Abbey, Mary’s Mount,
Ballarat, February 1, 1915.
■Dearest Children,
It is now twenty-nine years since
the “Blossoms” began its career. See-
ing, even at that time, that it was
impossible to keep up regular indi-
vidual correspondence, owing to your
numbers having so much increased,
I made a promise that as long as I
was able I would write in the
“Eucalyptus Blossoms” a yearly let-
ter addressed in general to all. That
promise I have kept, whether in the
Old Country or the New, whether on
sea or land. At the same time, I
reminded you that if you were in
any personal trouble or distress I
would do my best to help you; that
promise I think I have fulAlled also.
The time has now come when I
must say farewell, as far as this
world goes; but my interest in you,
my dearest children, shall never
cease, and, if our Divine Lord per-
mits me to know that you are car-
rying out the instructions you re-
ceived in Loreto, and that you live
the lives of true children of Loreto,
it will add much to my happiness in
the better world —our true home. And
then, remember, though I go, you
have still devoted friends in Loreto.
A few points I wish to impress on
you in this letter: First, respect and
obedience to parents and superiors—
the observance of that Commandment
to which a grand promise is at-
tached. Do not take a worldly view
of obedience; it is a noble virtue —•
truly great minds are always sub-
missive. Our Holy Father shows us
the necessity of obedience —in his
very first Encyclical he dwells on the
importance of recognising that all
authority comes from God. Now-a-
days young people emancipate them-
selves early, desiring to be their
own mistresses, to have ail liberty;
and yet, this does not conduce to
their happiness.
It is a truth, dear children, that
we are all more or less under obe-
dience. Those who learn early to
take an exalted view of this noble
virtue will be blessed, and when God
gives them a home of their own they
will know their duty—to make that
home an abode of peace and joy and
love; this can be secured only by
cheerful obedience. The very name
of Loreto brings before us the high-
est type of a home —the House of
Nazareth, where Christ spent thirty
years in submission and obedience.
W?e must remember that, in addition
to the obedience and respect which
we owe to superiors, deference and
respect are due to many, especially
to the aged and the poor.
A certain brusquerie seems to be
now quite fashionable, but note well
that gentle deference and reverence
mark the true lady. Imitation of
Our Blessed Lady settles that, for to
be “Marylike is to be lady-like.” See
Our Lady at the Visitation. She
knew she was the Mother of God,
yet she was the first to do a ser-
vice to her cousin. Elizabeth, aston-
ished, cried out: ‘‘Whence is this to
me that the Mother of my Lord
should visit me?’ Our Lady, in her
answer, tells us that God “hath ex-
alteth the humble.” Her humility
makes her gracious. I say to you,
my dear children, “hold close com-
munion with old-fashioned courte-
sies,” which, in reality, are never
out of fashion with the noble-minded,
queenly woman —best type of our
race.
Dear children, I would have you
gently and unostentatiously join in
every Catholic movement, and help
it. Do not, however,, aim at being
leaders; seek rather to be faithful


followers of Our Lord. I recommend
specially in the first place, local
good works-those of your own par-
ish then Catholic Federation, Cath-
olic Truth Society, the Propagation
of the Faith, the Holy Childhood. Be
faithful to the old-fashioned dovo-
tions, especially those to Saint Jo
seph and to the Holy ATl &els. I take
it for granted that love °f Our D
vine Lord and your Mother, the
Queen of Angels, glows in your
liG^irts*
With regard to the Angels, a
ofteif ignore the presence of angels,
and yef devotion to them w. d |ph
ritnalise our lives. Oh, yes. aear
children, it would make
act and speech, especially b eto
children, remembering the words o
Our Lord: "For 1 say to you that
their Angels in heaven always see the
face of My Father, Who is in hea-
You may have noticed that the
General Intention of this month in
the Anostleship of Prayer is Chris-
Jf® Modestv The few words on
?he subject in the “Messenger of the
Sacred Heart,’’ are beautiful, I hope
you wiU read them. The opening
sentence is "Modesty is an undefin-
atde sensitive fear that makes the
1 „„ long as it is delicate and
tender, recoil and hide within itseH,
like the flower, its fitting symbol, at
the approach of anything that might
wound it by a rude touch, or a light
that is too glaring. Modesty is to
beauty what limpidity is to a foun-
tain glass to a pastel, or atmosphere
to a landscape. Without its protective
shelter virtues could not blossom,
their sanctity would be violated; the
seed would be laid bare, the fruit
lost.” Guard with jealous care this
lovely virtue in thought, in word, in
dress! in reading, and in amuse-
ments.
To sum up my advice!? Z?H iV ate
children, I say once aiJ?ol^Usa!ra-
rtcvntion to the most Holy toacra
ment of the Altar, devotion to Our
Ladv St Joseph, and the Angels;
obedience and submission to super-

when dealing with the poor and the
aged, and unostentatious zeal for
good works.

A nthem
O Hail! All Hail!
O Portland, lovely city of the South!
Long may you rest
Safe from all harm
Within the shadow of God’s shelt’ring arm.
Long ages saw you dreaming neath the sun,
Washed by the waves that thundered, on your shore.
Heard you not whisper of the splendid day
When countless graces God from heaven would pour?
O Hail! All Hail!
Your gifts of loveliness were as the dawn
That swiftly deepens to a blaze of gold,
When ’midst adoring angels God came down
And rested—as in Bethlehem of old.
O Hail! All Hail!


DAILY OFFERING
tmjY most loving Jesus! I include myself
ifl i n all the Masses that will be offered
to Thy Holy Name this day in every part
of the world.
I offer them all to Thee in union with
the intentions of Thy Sacred Heart.
| humbly beg of Thee t dear Jesus, to
save for me out of each Mass, one drop
of Thy Precious Blood to make up to God
for my sins and for the punishments they
deserve.
Grant me also the favour, that through
the power of each Holy Mass, one poor
sinner may be converted to Thee, one dying
creature may receive the grace of repen-
tance one poor soul in Purgatory may be
set free, and one terrible mortal sin, one
that hurts Thy dear Heart most, may be
prevented.
Without Thee, O my Jesus, I will
never die, but on Thy Sacred Heart I am
ready to die how, when and where it shall
please Thee.
Perpetual sacrifice of the Mass, I unite
myself to You. Pay what I owe to Heaven,
to earth, and to Purgatory for the past,
the present, and the future.

PRAYER FOR CHAPLAINS.
Dear Lord, be good to all
our priests who are serving
our beloved country as
chaplains. Let them be to
their men models of man-
liness, self-control, and holi-
ness. Give them much grace
to help our men to live
holily, to suffer patiently,
and to die bravely if that
be their lot. Dear Lord, King
of Peace, hear this our prayer
while the war lasts, but do
grant us peace soon. Amen.
