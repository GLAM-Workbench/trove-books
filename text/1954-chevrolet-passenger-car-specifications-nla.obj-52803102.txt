SSUED BY SERVICE DIVISION, APRIL, 1954




GENERAL
The Chevrolet passenger car for 1954 features im-
provements in styling and performance, while retaining
the same basic car lines of the previous year.
New front end styling, bumper guards, exterior
mouldings, boot lid handle and tail lights highlight the
exterior of the new model.
From the centre, the ends of the re-styled front bum-
per recede gradually toward the grille then arc forward
and around the front fender comers. The wrap around
has been increased slightly, but the bumper cross sec-
tion remains unchanged.
The new radiator grille has a massive centre bar, five
vertical bars which are raked back at top and bottom,
and an upper bar. The centre bar wraps around the
front fender corners and houses the parking lights,
while the upper bar frames the top of the grille and
curves downward to join the centre bar at either end.
The gravel deflector replaces the lower grille bar and
is attached to the lower edge of the fenders at the sides.
Additional front end features include a new chrome-
plated die cast hood emblem and hood ornament and
rectangular parking lights.
Rear vision has been improved with the new wrap-
around curved one-piece rear window.
The new tail light is framed by a hooded bright
metal bezel and is divided into two sections. The upper
section houses both tail and stop lamp while the lower
half has provision for the accessory back-up light. A
reflex band which follows the contour of the bezel
serves as a reflector.
Bumper guards are bullet shaped and crowned with
a raised section. The rear number plate guard, which is
formed of a bright metal stamping, slopes downward
from a crested top to join the bumper guard at either
end.
Hub caps are completely re-styled and are approxi-
mately 2 inches larger in diameter. The new wheel as-
sembly has three equally spaced flattened areas on the
disc which retain the hub cap without need for spring
clips.
