THE “SOBRAON.”
This fine ship, one of the largest sailing vessels afloat, was built
by Messrs. Hall & Son, of Aberdeen. She was two years in con-
struction, and was launched in November, ! 866. She made her
first voyage to Sydney in 1867, under Captain Pyle; and she has
since made five other voyages to the same port, and five to Mel-
bourne, returning by the Cape of Good Hope, under her present
commander, Captain Elmslie.
The Sobraon is a composite ship, being built of solid teak, with
beams and frame-work of iron. She has wrought-iron masts, and
steel yards and topmasts. She is classed Ai 16 years at Lloyds,
2,130 tons register, 3,500 tons burden. Her length is 300 feet;
breadth, 40 feet; and extreme depth of hold, 28 feet. The height
of the mainmast from the keel is 189 feet, 29 feet being below
the main deck. The length of the main and fore yards is 90 feet;
lower topsail yards, 76 feet; upper topsail yards, 56 feet; royal
yards, 44 feet.
The sails contain the following quantities of canvas :

Some idea may be formed of the expense of a suit of sails from
the fact that a new mainsail costs nearly
The “ Sobraon ” is built with a special view to carrying a large
number of passengers. She has a flush deck, with only a very
small poop, containing merely the officers’ quarters. There is a
deck-house, comprising a smoking-room, two bath-rooms, and a
handsome staircase leading to the saloons. The principal saloon
is nearly 100 feet in length, and is panelled in polished teak and
maple. It will dine 70 people. There is also a prettily decorated
ladies’ saloon near the stern of the ship. On either side of the
saloons are the sleeping cabins, and at one end of the principal
saloon there is a piano. The second and third class cabins are
particularly roomy and well ventilated.

Sobraon Mercury
FIRST NUMBER. [April, 1877.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Editors of the “ Sobraon Mercury,” in pre-
senting the first number of this paper to their fellow-passengers,
hope by their countenance and support to be enabled to issue
frequent publications, that the ways and doings of so illustrious a
community may not be lost to posterity.
The S.M. will endeavour to record anything of interest occur-
ring during the voyage, and hopes that Poets, Authors, Artists,
and Grumblers will not be backward in coming forward with
specimens of their talents.
Contributors, our box is ready. Beginners, now is your chance.
We make our bow, and feel your interest is with us.
NOTES ON THE VOYAGE.
It is not the most enviable position in the world to find yourself
left on board a vessel which is to be your prison for many weeks,
to see the departure in many cases of dear friends, and, when
they have disappeared in the distance, to look round this said
prison and feel yourself amongst strangers ; such, however, was
the position in which we found ourselves on the evening of the
19th February last- We think, notwithstanding, that after the said
look round we felt somewhat reassured, and began to think that
we should not fare so badly on the “ Sobraon.” _
It always takes’one some little time to get things “ ship-shape;”
but in a few days we settled down very comfortably in our tem-
porary home. For several days progress towards our destination
was very poor, winds seemingly having vanished from these parts


of the globe. The fair portion of our community did not give us
much of their society for the time being—that dire complaint,
which gives most of us a turn, did not forget the “ Sobraon.”
We were not quite without excitement even at this early part
of the voyage, as we were keeping company with the “ Hamp-
shire ” for two or three days. On Thursday afternoon, in putting
the ship about, we had the pleasure of seeing this pretty barque pass
close by our stern, giving us an opportunity of inspecting her
passengers, and giving them a hearty British cheer, which was
reciprocated with equal gusto. We lost sight of her at sun-down,
and we hope to welcome her at home when we are safely berthed
in the dock. On Sunday, the 25th, the Rev. G. Daniel read the
morning prayers, and the Rev. S. J. Whitmee prayers and sermon
in the evening, Mr. Miller presiding at the piano; neither the
choir nor the organist, however, seemed to have yet quite found
their sea-legs.
On the 26th we were fortunate enough to catch an albatross and
a mollymawk, which caused no little sensation on the poop. The
doctor had to be called in to prevent their being overcome by
sea-sickness ; but we cannot recommend his remedy on this occa-
sion to our fellow-passengers.
On the 27th the male portion of our community had a gentle
spasm in the shape of a quoit tournament, when some very good
games were played. Mr. Nicholson, our worthy chief-officer,
carried off the palm and prize.
Nothing of much interest now occurred for a few days. On
Sunday, the 4th March, Mr. Whitmee officiated at the morning
service, and Mr. Daniel in the evening. We had another grand
quoit tournament on Monday the sth, and Mr. Elkin was the suc-
cessful player. On the evening of the 6th we had our first con-
cert, the performers being Mrs. Elmslie and the Misses Daniel;
Capt. Elmslie, Messrs. Absolom, Tegetmeier, Elkin, Charlton,
and Miller. The evening passed off pretty successfully for the
first attempt, and gave us promise of greater things in the future.
On the 7th a mania for ring-making seized us, the ship resounding
with the click of many hammers. Shillings were in immense
demand, and in twenty-four hours the scintillations on the fingers
of young and old were quite overpowering. This morning our
main top-gallantsail split from top to bottom in a squall: and this
evening we have to record the sad loss of one of our number, who
died shortly after dark. Sunday, the 1 ith, usual services—morn-
ing by Mr. Daniel, evening by Mr. Whitmee—the choir seems
brightening up. 12th, another grand tournament, Mr. Bristow
the winner. Some of us were visited by a strange apparition after
“ lights out,” whilst smoking the final pipe, in the shape of a lively
porker, who had eluded the vigilance of his keepers. Attempts


were made to catch him, and bring him forcibly below, but our
intentions were frustrated by the appearance of the authorities.
On the 13th, morning, we were, startled by the roar of artillery,
and thought that we were preparing to fight the Russians, but it
proved to be the cleaning out of our solitary 9-pounder. In the
evening Mr. Daniel delivered a very interesting lecture on the
South Sea Islands, manners, customs, &c. On the 16th, evening,
about midnight, a commotion was heard in the saloon, and in the
morning things seemed very mixed with the water-cans and boots.
Sunday, 18th. Mr. Whitmee took the service in the morning,
Mr. Daniel in the evening. Rather rough and boisterous day,
which caused several vacancies at the table.
Monday. 19th. One month out to-day, though the progress
has been slow, and the zephyrs very erratic, we have managed to
get just 3,000 miles on our way. The sailors, as usual, com-
memorated the occasion with the sale of a steed of their own
manufacture, and we derived considerable amusement from the
auction and burial, to say nothing of the concert which followed.
The auctioneer seemed thoroughly up to his business, but got
into a difficulty when guineas were offered ; however, we are glad
to be able to present the men with the sum of 4s.
OUR NEPTUNIAN LIBATIONS.
What an exacting old scoundrel is that sea-god Neptune to
those land lubbers who set foot within his dominions! His im-
perious demands are equalled only by the devotion of his cadaverous
worshippers ! The good ship “ Sobraon ” left Hobson’s Bay on
Tuesday morning, February 22nd, and found little wind or sea
outside the heads. She being a remarkably steady vessel, the
majority of her passengers might reasonably expect, under such
circumstances, to bid defiance to the qualms and spasms incidental
to the “Ohmy !” complaint. Such was not, however, the case.
Those who resisted the fascinations and exactions of the hoary old
ruler of the sea were in a minority.
Most of the ladies, and many of the gentlemen, soon offered
libations in Neptune’s honour. Some were so much occu-
pied that they never appeared outside their cabins for the first few
days. True, we ‘did not inquire particularly into the nature of
their occupations during those days ; but we presume they were
spent in such interesting devotions as those we have credited them
with. We know some had not time to spare or inclination to
attend to the duties of the toilet. Others were so much engrossed
that they did not even take time to eat. We believe they


regarded cooks as a bore, and were ready to vote for the banish-
ment of both cooks and stewards out of the community as an un-
necessary nuisance—except that they occasionally needed the
assistance of the latter as cup bearers in- connection with the Nep-
tunian libations.
We saw some of these devotees -on deck. But they were not
much inclined to join in the irreverent conversation and fun of
their less pious fellow-passengers. Wrapped in the usual habili-
ments of such pilgrims, they lay prone upon deck or settee
absorbed in meditation. Sad to say, this pious fit gradually wore
off in the case of most on board ! The cabins were deserted —the
habiliments of the devotee discarded, and the libation cups put
aside for rough days, when some become pious again and return to
their devotions for a time. We believe cooks are no longer voted
an unnecessary nuisance, but are regarded as being about the
best, and most useful fellows going. Mercurius.

ABSTRACT OF LECTURE ON THE DAR-
WINIAN THEORY.
Delivered March 22nd, by the Rev. S. J. Whitmee,
F.R.G.S., C.M.Z.S.
After some introductory remarks respecting the origin of the
Darwinian theory, its popularity, and the standing occupied by
Mr. Darwin, the lecturer defined the theory as one which
attempted to account for the evolution of one form of life out of


another, throughout the whole series of living organisms—animal
and vegetable —the higher from the lower, and that man, who stands
at the head of the series must own his ascent, through the monkey,
as an immediate and near relative from the lowest form of organic
existence. He also referred, incidentally, to Dr. H. Charlton
Bastian’s fruitless attempt to carry the evolution theory still fur-
ther back, and show that living organisms might be developed out
of inorganic matter. _
A number of facts in nature were mentioned upon which the
Darwinian theory is based. These were included under (i) The
tendency to variation from their original form in animals and
plants • (2) The effect of the use or disuse of parts in producing
changes; (3) “Mimicry;” (4) Sexual selection. The lecturer
showed the plausibility of the theory, and its apparent support;
(1) by Homology , or the unity of type in nature, one type, or plan
prevailing throughout large classes of, in many respects, dissimilar
animals or plants ; {2) By the geological succession of organic
beings, which, as a rule, shows a constant advance from lower forms
to those which are higher, until at the top we find man; (3) By
the geographical distribution of animals and plants, there being
an affinity between the production of particular regions, a family
likeness which seems to point to descent from common ancestors.
After this, Mr. Whitmee met the objection that the Darwinian
or evolution hypothesis is necessarily opposed to the belief in the
existence of a Designer, Creator, and Regulator of all things, and
to the Bible account of creation; he showed that Mr. Darwin him-
self did not sanction that view, and expressed the opinion that
full proof of the truth of evolution would not materially affect the
scriptural narrative. This opinion was supported by quotations
from the writings of Mr. St. George Mivart, the Duke of Argyle,
Professor Sir W. Thomson, and the late Sir John Herschel.
The lecturer then pointed out how far he believed the
Darwinian theory to be accounted for by fact, and how far he
thought it had been pushed beyond what a logical deduction
from & facts would warrant. He believed that in some
instances a whole genus, or even a whole natural order of
animals or plants might have sprung from common ancestors.
The facts brought forward in support of the theory show
plainly that changes take place within certain restricted limits,
but nothing more. In concluding, the lecturer mentioned Mr.
St George Ivlivart’s computation that to complete the develop-
ment of the whole animal kingdom, according to the Darwinian
theory, no less time than 2,500,000,000 years would be required,
and he gave the result arrived at by Professor Sir William
from three distinct lines of inquiry, as to the probable
age of the world, viz. (1) The action of the tides upon the


earth’s rotation; (2) the probable length of time during which
the sun has illuminated this planet; (3) the temperature of the
interior of the earth. From all of these the learned Professor
came to the conclusion that the existing state of things,
life on the earth, must be limited within some such past period as
100,000,000 years ; thus leaving 2,400,000,000 still required for
the completion of the evolution process. The facts which, in the
lecturer’s opinion, seemed to give most countenance to the evolu-
tion hypothesis are those connected with homology and embryology,
and these he thought might be accounted for -by what might be
called the unity of design in creation. All nature shows that One
Mind designed the whole—and that all natural objects are
parts of one Ideal Whole. As to man he differs from every other
animal by a distinction far more profound than any which sepa-
rates each irrational animal from every other, and evolution alone
can never account for him. Observer.
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS.
I have to record the death of one of our fellow-passengers,
who came on board in a precarious state, but the general
health of the company has, on the whole, been good, and seems
likely so to continue, as early rising, bathing, and exercise
in the fresh air are fashionable among both ladies and gentle-
men. Of course we could hardly expect to escape the usual
course of sea-sickness, which began as soon as the ship’s move-
ment was felt, but in most cases passed off in due time, leaving
the patients with a good appetite, and not much the worse for
their rather unpleasant experiences. We are sorry, however, to
see. that Mrs. Whitmee still remains unable to take her place at
meals and the occupations of the ship. The weights of the pas-
sengers show, as a rule, an increase on weighing days, which occur
about once a fortnight. Headaches and toothaches have been
very prevalent, but the first have, in most cases, passed off before
long, and the second have not gone so far as to necessitate any
deficiency being made in the dental apparatus. We have at pre-
sent two surgical cases on board, Master David Blair injudiciously
knelt on the point of his knife, which though fortunately did not
enter the knee joint, inflicted a wound which made his confinement
to his bunk and the use of a splint necessary for a few days.
Stretton, one of our midshipmen, dislocated one of the bones of
his left arm, and became the subject of surgical treatment —both
of these, however, are doing well.

"In Memoriam"
Death is always a solemn event! When it occurs in the
midst of the congregated millions in the great city—as the
mourners go about the streets the passing tram reflects at
least a momentary gleam of its own sombreness upon the
passer-by, and presents the image of the hour-glass and
scythe more or less, vividly; but the pause seems only of the
briefest and the tush and whirl around catch us again, almost
before the procession has passed from view! Even more
impressive and affecting is the sight of the open gangway on
board ship, the rude ship bier, the raised figure in its centre
over which the ensign is doing duty as a pall; with the con-
sciousness that it hides the remains of one of our own com-
pany; one who had entered the voyage with us, had become
partner in our views and feelings and expectations, and who
a few short hours since was exchanging thoughts with us
upon subjects mutually interesting.
How solemn the scene 1 how immediate the presence of
that mysterious power which so suddenly puts a stop to all
our pursuits, snaps every bond however intimate and tender,
and hurries our dear ones into the depths of oblivion I
So thought we as we stood in the grey dawning on the
deck of the “Sobraon” on the morning of March Bth, taking
part in the last sad offices to be performed for Mr. Thomas
McCarthy, who had died the preceding evening. Born of
respectable parents (his father being a medical practitioner
in the City of Dublin), Mr. McCarthy, having completed
his education, entered upon commercial life, and in the
early days of the Victoria Gold-field fever left his home and
country to push his fortunes in the new spheres. Here like
many others disappointment awaited him, plans failed, and
friends failed, and the struggle became more intense until
the powers of nature failed; the overstrained brain lost
the vital power and could no more regain it. Memory
failed, speech became indistinct, actions often involuntary
and unmeaning. Medical skill could mitigate, but was
powerless to restore. In hopes that time and the invigorat-
ing sea breezes might accomplish it, the voyage was entered
upon, but the fiat had gone forth, the race was run out and
the weary wheels stood still. As a shadow life glides before
us. Men have their “ exits and their entrances”; as we
note them how loud-voiced is the inquiry, surely momentous
beyond every other, “If a man die shall he live again ? ”

To the Editors ,
The “ Sobraon Mercury ,”
Dear Sirs, —I am quite sure that most of the ladies and gentle
men on board this ship like to take a rest between the hours
of 2 and 4 p,m., yet I am not allowed a minute’s peace all day
except at meal times.
From 10 a m. until 7 p.m. I am kept in movement by different
people, some of whom touch me gently, others beat me about in
a very harsh manner. Now, through the columns of your valua-
ble paper I pour forth my lament, feeling sure that you will inter-
cede on my behalf and leave me in quietness for two hours in the
afternoon, so that I, common with most on board, may enjoy a
short snooze. Trusting you will not grudge me what I ask, I beg
to subscribe myself most respectfully,
The Piano.
WANTED —by a young lady—a gentleman with whom she
can flirt for the rest of the passage, must be moderately
good-looking and not under the age of 16 years, and not of a noisy
disposition; a change may be made at the end of two weeks by
mutual agreement. The lady is fond of an evening stroll and
would require the use of the gentleman’s arm every evening.—
This need not frighten applicants as her weight is only 13 stone.

SECOND NUMBER. [April, 1877.
NOTES ON THE VOYAGE.
Our editorial duties again devolve upon us, and in beginning our
second number we th ink the ladies and gentlemen who have been
. good enough to send in contributions to the paper.
On the 20th March we had a quoit tournament, and to our
great surprise Mr. Charlton broke out in a fresh place and won the
prize. In the evening we had the excitement of seeing the main-
sail come to grief, and we admired the prompt manner in which
it was replaced. Mr. Whitmee, on the evening of the 22nd, gave
us an interesting lecture on the Darwinian Theory, abstract of
which was published in our last.
On Sunday, the 25th, Mr. Daniel took the morning service, and
Mr. Whitmee the evening ; Miss Daniel in an efficient manner
presiding at the piano.
The 27th gave us the treat of our second concert, and many
thanks are due to Mr. Elkin for his exertions in getting it up and
for the good programme he laid before us. The heat was very
intense, but, by the aid of fans, we were enabled to enjoy songs
from Mrs. Elmslie, Miss Fforde, Miss Upton, Mr. Absolom, and
others, and instrumental music by the Misses Daniel and Mr.
Elkin The Captain and Mr. Daniel favoured us with amusing
readings.
On the 28th a general meeting was held in the saloon, Air.
Lindley in the chair. Mr. Elkin was elected secretary, and <ui
amusement committee was appointed to arrange and direct all en-
tertainments.
Good Friday, 30th March. Service was held in the morning by
Mr. Whitmee. This evening we tried a new amusement in the
shape of a Spelling Bee. Mr. Whitmee kindly undertook the


office of interrogator. Miss Morant and Miss Daniel were the
successful competitors, and were rewarded by small works of art
manufactured on the ship. On the following Sunday Mr. Whitmee
read the morning prayers ; Mr. Daniel officiated in the evening.
On the morning of the 3rd, about 2 o’clock, the whole ship
was awakened from its slumbers by the shouts of our officers, and
it did not take many minutes to discover that the old Sobraon ”
was struggling in a good stiff squall, but happily we escaped with
only damage done to the mizen-top-gallant and outer jib. General
committee meeting to arrange the week’s programme of amuse-
ments.
On the 3rd we heard the pleasant sound of “ Sail, ho ! ’ and
this time it did not prove, as on the Ist of this month, to be a
hoax ; but we sighted a fine Indian trader. In the afternoon we
got near enough to speak her, and found her name to be “ Cassiope,
from Rangoon, thirty-seven days out, bound to Liverpool. We
kept sight of her till the evening of the next day.
April 4th, Mr. Daniel kindly delivered the lecture this evening
which was postponed last evening on account of the frequent
squalls. The subject was, “ The Book : its Assailants and Defence,
which was ably rendered by the lecturer.
To-day a general meeting of the passengers was convened, and
though rather late on the voyage, it was unanimously decided to
start this paper. Messrs. Barker and Miller were elected editors.
6th. The weather at this time was very oppressive, which we
suppose must account for the laxity of festivities amongst us ;
however, this evening we managed to get up a dance on deck.
On the 7th a steamer hove in sight, and many were the conjec-
tures who she could be and whither bound. All we could dis-
c ‘ver was a little smoke and four masts.
Sunday, Bth. Mr. Daniel took the morning service, Mr. Whitmee
prayers and sermon in the evening. Another rough Sunday,
drizzling most of the day, but cleared up after dinner and en-
abled us to see a vessel right astern.
Monday, 9th. This evening a very fine sunset. Land said to
be visible, but it required more nautical eyes than we can boast
of to discover anything but clouds
Tuesday, 10. This morning we were refreshed by a little ex-
citement —a boat being lowered, commanded by Mr. Nicholson,
for the purpose of taking soundings and bagging anything in the
shape of fish in our vicinity. Their endeavours, however, proved
unsuccessful, as they could not bottom at a hundred fathoms.
We seem quite in the wake of ships just now, another barque being
visible on our port bow. Land plainly descernible this evening,
and at sunset we had the pleasure of seeing the revolving light of
Cape Recife, and left it astern after putting the ship about before
dark.


It was the first time most of us had. gazed on “ Afric’s sunny
shores,” and though what we saw was very limited, we should all
have much rejoiced had our Captain thought it necessary to pay
the Cape a visit We have to thank our musical sub-committee
for the grand display of talent they collected for our amusement,
and the well-conducted performance we heard to-night.
Mr. Upton ably acted as chairman, and we think the general
committee have done wisely in deciding to have a chairman at
these entertainments.
The performers were Mrs. Elmslie, Mrs. Bell, Mrs. Taubman,
Misses Upton and Daniel: Messrs. Tegetmeier, Absolom, Bristow,
Charlton, Elkin and Miller.
Our ladies, we are glad to see, are coming forward handsomely,
and we trust now they have begun they will not recede, and that
we shall have the pleasure of seeing their names more often in
our programmes.
nth. This paper made its debfit to-day, the first publication
being read in the saloon by Mr. Whitmee. The “ Block ” after
dinner is largely frequented and affords great amusement.
That interesting and exciting game of twos and threes is not
without its admirers. We should recommend those who play
leap-frog on a rough dav to see that the doctor is at hand, as his
services might be required. We think also the starboard side is
best adapted for this juvenile pastime, the editors requiring rest
after the labours of the day.
A wise philosopher has said “ Never do nothing what ain’t your
forte.” Very good advice, no doubt, but people are not always
disposed to take good advice.
Now I am quite sure that writing for so distinguished a paper
as the “ Sobraon Mercury” is certainly not my forte. But being
a rather strongminded individual of the feminine gender, and con-
sequently possessing a will of my own, I am inclined for once to
do something that is not my forte, particularly as I am suddenly
inspired with the frantic desire of seeing myself in print.
But what to write about ? that is the question. Shall it be of
the glorious ocean in its ever changing aspect, or an essay on the
moon ? No, I leave these minor subjects to some other pen and
offer a few remarks for the good of mankind in general, and of
those who travel by sea in particular, upon the most important
topic on board ship - , namely, the science of gastronomy. I have
heard it said, that at sea every one evinces the keenest interest, as
to what the next meal will consist of. During the past six weeks
it has been proved indisputably that the second cabin passengers
on board the good ship “ Sobraon” have not been the exception
to the general rule. Profound peace and goodwill reign supreme


amongst us upon all subjects but one, and this one is the merits
or otherwise of the various and sometimes mysterious dishes with
which we are regaled, and which only those well versed in the
culinary art can at all comprehend. It is true there are some in
our midst who can take what is placed before them without
making any scrutiny as to what the preparation may be, but these
are they who are “ t iankfu’ for sma’ mercies ; ” but there are others
of us who are of a different way of thinking, amongst whom are
two ladies, for whom we entertain a most sincere regard, not only
on account of their own worth and integrity, but also as they are
the source of never-ending amusement to us. They are both
travelling to the dear land of their birth, in search of renewed
health, and it is perhaps on this account that sweet Peggy and
Biddy have become the most indefatigable of grumblers when
refreshment is the theme of conversation, and when is it not ?
From 8 a.m. until 10 p.m., it is the all absorbing thought. Says sweet
Peggy to sweet Biddy, “ What was it we had for dinner to-day? ”
“ They called it roast pork, my dear.” “ Roast pork, was it sure ?
Faith it is in ould Ireland then that we shall see very different
creatures, known there as pigs.”
Now we are certainly indebted to these ladies for their untiring
zeal in making so many suggestions and comparisons, yet at the
same time I would advise that we should sometimes remember,
even on board the “Sobraon,” that we do not live merely to
eat, but should eat in order to live —as I fear that when we
land we may all be found suffering from a new malady, namely,

FLIRTATION.
Messrs, the Editors Sobraon Mercury.
Dear Sirs, — As t was taking my usual constitutional walk round
the quarter-deck the other evening, and enjoying my weed, I was
very much struck by the absent appearance of several couples that
were walking at the same time. There was one couple in particular
who used to knock up against everybody passing by, so I seated
myself on the skylight to observe the reason. Now this particular
lady was very prepossessing in appearance and the gentleman was
shown to advantage under a luxuriant whisker. As they walked


along I observed the gentleman was whispering all those soft
nothings generally used when flirting, and, by all appearance, the
lady rather liked it, so I concluded, regarding this couple, that the
gentleman was getting desperately in love and was not accountable
for his actions. Thence the reason for so much knocking. A
second couple passes by—a very youthful pair, especially the
gentleman; who, I should imagine, never had the honour of being
much in ladies’ society, as he had very little to say for himself, and
he smoked a great deal, to the great annoyance of the youthful
lady, who suddenly cut him and started a flirtation with a gentle-
man a few years his senior. A third couple passes by, and lo ! I
beheld a married man, the father of a family, walking an accom-
plished young lady up and down the decks, and, to judge by ap-
pearance, flirting desperately. A fourth couple now attracts my
attention; they were sitting down and had passed that stage of
flirtation and had fallen in love, as the language of the eyes was
mostly used, and very happy they appeared to be. To a party like
me, advanced in years, but who has passed through all the stages
of this disease and can calmly look back on the past and see a
counterpart of it before me on this deck, I can only say flirt on,
ladies and gentlemen ; now is your time, for when you arrive at the
great Metropolis and go your different ways, and separate perhaps
never to see each other again, then you may be able (probably with
a pang) to think of the pleasant evenings spent on the ocean flirt-
ing on the “ Sobraon’s” deck, and all your bumping and knocking
will be forgotten and forgiven.
I remain, dear Sirs,
Yours truly,

AN AWKWARD MISTAKE.
At a dinner party (in town) last August there were two sisters
present, one a widow who had just emerged from her weeds, the


other not long married, whose husband had lately gone out to
India for a short term. A young barrister present, who was
deputed to take the widow into dinner, unfortunately was under the
impression that his partner was the married lady whose husband
had just arrived in India. The conversation between them com-
menced by the lady’s remarking how extremely hot it was. “Yes,
it is very hot,” replied the young barrister. Then a happy thought
suggested itself to him, and he added, with a cheerful smile, “ But
not so hot as the place to which your husband has gone.”

Gliding through the white sea foam,

ABSTRACT OF A LECTURE DELIVERED BY REV. G.
DANIEL, ON THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS AND
ISLANDERS.
The lecturer informed his hearers that as one essential clement in
all entertainments on board ship was brevity, he should at once
discard the somewhat lengthy written lecture w r hich he held in
his hand, and endeavour to interest them for half an hour or so
by a little easy chat about the South Sea Islands and the inhabi-
tants. It might be necessary for the sake of the young people
present to define the term South Sea Islands, as some people
seemed to have an idea that it meant a small group somewhere in
the Southern Ocean. The principal groups were then referred to
and their relative positions pointed out. It was remarked that
the characteristics of one group, so far as manners and customs
were concerned, generally distinguished all, whilst the similarity
in the idiom and in many of the words in the various dialects
seemed to point to one common original.
This brought us ‘at once to the question whence came they ?
Ethnologists had been divided upon this subject, some believing
that the human family had originally spread from the east of Asia
to the north and thence by Behring’s Straits to the American con-
tinent, had contended that the South Sea Islands had been peopled
from the South American continent, and pointed to the likeness


found in them to the red man of the west in proof. A glance at
the map would show the improbability of this theory, the ocean
spaces required to be traversed being altogether too great for their
means of transport.
The other theory of a Malayan origin had not only ethnological
and philological proofs in its favour, but it would be seen that the
distance required to be travelled would in no case exceed about
300 miles from group to group. There were to be found, how-
ever, two distinct types of the human family. The Malayan with
straight hair, regular features, symmetrical figures and olive com-
plexions, and the negro with his woolly head, flat nose, protruding
lips and jet-black skin. How the latter class had got spread over
the Islands was a mystery, but there they are. A large class of
intermediates may likewise be found, but no doubt these could be
accounted for by the intermarriages constantly going on.
The native’s traditions were then referred to, all of which
pointed to canoes and marvellous adventures as the modes by
which their ancestors had arrived.
The geological formation of the Islands was next touched upon
and the three classes were defined —firstly, Volcanic; secondly,
Crystalline or Hilly; and thirdly, the low Coral Islands. The
remarkable caves found in the second class were described at
some length. In connection with the low Coral Islands, the
wonderful provision made by the formation of the barrier reef was
pointed out, without which in times of storm the Islands would
be liable to be swept away, but which, acting as a natural break-
water, the huge waves of the Pacific expended themselves harm-
lessly’upon it. Within the barrier reef vessels found anchorage,
and amidst the multitudes of islets which studded the basin the
native found his fishing ground. The lecturer here exhibited and
explained the use of the various implements employed by the
natives in taking fish.
The political condition of the Tonga Islands was next described
as illustrative of that found on most of the other groups. Caste
prevailed to as great an extent as in India. A chief was born a
chief and came into the world invested with, absolute power over
serfs and inferiors —these were born in the lower condition from
which nothing could raise them. Christianity had entirely changed
the condition of things. Representative Parliament and printed
laws had taken the place of arbitrary will and club law. Their
social state and domestic haljits were dwelt upon at some length ;
in their heathen state they lived in towns ranging in size from a
population of 200 or 300 to that of 3,000 or 4,000. These
towns were surrounded by a high bank loop-holed for the purpose
of enabling them to shoot their arrows or throw their spears at
enemies without; the ditch out of which the embankment had been


dug, being filled with water and planted with spears or sharp
stakes. The town was approached by a covered way and the
entrance made up with logs of the cocoanut tree. In time of
war these were always secured and guarded by day and night.
The towns were laid out in departments, roads running through
them at right angles ; in the centre of the town was the Malai or
village green, upon which stood the large house which served the
purpose of town hall, caravanserai, and general assembly hall
and lodging house. From the town at daylight might be seen
issuing a long line of men in Indian file, away to the fields to
cultivate their yams, bananas, &c., whilst all over the town might
be heard the ratatatat of the mallets of the women engaged in
making the native cloth. The mode of manufacture was described
and many specimens of the cloth in the various stages of manu-
facture exhibited, great merriment being caused by the dressing
up of Master G. Lindley and Miss May Elmslie in native costume.

HOW SOME PEOPLE GET THEIR WIVES.
Among some of the Gilbert Islanders lads and lasses are not
allowed to form 'their matrimonial alliances after the modes
approved of in most other parts of the world, but after a fashion
which is, I believe-, perfectly unique. The heads of families in
council arrange most matters affecting both public and domestic
life, and amongst others the marriages. The way in which they
couple their young people is as follows : —When a number of both


sexes have reached the marriageable age, an order is given to the
young men to commence at once and make a kind of cord, much
used in the Islands, which is formed of fibre of cocoanut. After
what is deemed a sufficient time has passed, a day is fixed for
testing the industry of the youths, and for deciding whether they
are fit to marry or not. This day is a grand holiday, and all the
people turn out to witness the interesting ceremony. The young
men are stationed at some particular spot in the village, each
carrying the hank of cord he has made, and the young women who
are candidates for matrimony are stationed in another spot, at a
distance decided on by the old men; This distance is always
different on each occasion of a w r ife race, in order that none may
know beforehand the exact length, and it is regulated according
to the time the young men have had to make their cord. One
end of all the cords is then fastened to a tree or a stake, and at a
given signal the young men start off at full speed towards the
place occupied by the ladies, unwinding their cord as they go.
Those who have been lazy usually get to the end of their cord
before they reach the place where the fair damsels are waiting in
anxious expectation for them; when such is the case, the idle
fellows fall out of the race amidst the merriment of the onlookers
—no wives for them that day. As soon as those who have been
industrious reach the post fixed as a goal, the ladies make a rush
and each one tries to seize on the cord of the lad she likes best;
the first who gets hold of a cord is the wife of its owner. It is
said that notwithstanding this very impartial mode of coupling
their young people practised by these Islanders, in some instances
the lads and lasses manage to defeat the plans of the old people
there, as in all other places, and that the result of the wife race is
not always left to chance, but that some young men exercise their
own choice in securing their partners ; a youth will frequently have
an understanding with the particular young lady he wishes first to
get hold of his cord, and he generally manages so to arrange
matters as to secure that she shall have the first chance, but
sometimes these preconcerted plans of the interesting couple are
disarranged by some bold lady rival who is too expert for the
favourite one, and who supplants her by getting possession first:
in such a case the young man must take the lady who gains
possession. But the unfortunate Jacob who gets a Leah instead
of the wished for Rachael is allowed to try his fortune in securing
the object of his choice in a second race at a future time, but
then he has to keep two wives instead of one.

THIRD NUMBER. [May, 1877.
NOTES ON THE VOYAGE.
We wrote our last notes to the date of nth April. Since then,
with the exception of our visit to St. Helena, very little has oc-
curred of any moment.
In the afternoon of the 12th April we sighted another barque,
and the facetious ones amongst us said, as is their wont, that it
was the Hampshire.
On the night of the 13th the ship was thrown for some
minutes into a great state of alarm. A lamp burst in the hand of
one of the stewards, and the floor of the pantry was in a terrific
blaze from the burning oil. The excitement was very intense for
the time, many of the ladies having retired for the night; but we
are thankful to say that by the prompt application of blankets the
danger was soon at an end. We were, however, destined to a
sleepless night. At about one o’clock a sudden squall took the
ship aback, and the noise and confusion consequent on shortening
sail roused us all again, but fortunately the squall, though severe
for a few minutes, soon passed off.
On the 14th the barque was still in sight, and about noon we were
near enough to signal to her. By the stars and stripes we dis-
covered her to be a “ stranger,” and though we tried to enter into
conversation, this evidence of her nationality was all the answer
she vouchsafed. The usual services on Sunday. Just at this
time we felt the motion of the ship pretty considerably, the rolling
being especially severe ; but we cannot complain a steadier
ship than the old.“ Sobraon ” cannot well be imagined. Some of
our young ladies broke the monotony of their very energetic ex-
istence on board by attempting a little bird-catching. The weather
still keeps beautifully fine and warm, and there is a pleasant feeling


in languidly lolling about the deck on a bright afternoon watching
the doings of others.
the 17th we had a meeting of the general amusement com-
mittee, but no important business was transacted. This evening
Mr, V\ hitmee kindly delivered a very interesting lecture on “ How
was the World formed?’’and initiated us considerably into the
wonders of the heavenly bodies. Mr. Lindley took the chair.
On the 18th the ladies put aside their books and work for a
short time, and engaged with some spirit in a quoit tournament.
Miss Turner carried off the prize, which was a silver cross manu-
factured on board. On the 19th, after dinner, five vessels were
said to be in sight from aloft. Again, on the 20th, we were not
without company, four being distinctly visible. At about 11 o’clock
we began signalling the two that were most close to us. A fine
American ship on our port quarter we first tried to communicate
with, but unfortunately the flags she sent up were in the shade of
the sails, and we could not distinguish her message. Subsequently
we opened a conversation with a pretty little Swedish ship, and
found her name to be the “ Favorit,” from Stavanger, Bassein
to Rotterdam, fifty-two days out. When we came on deck after
dinner a charming picture presented itself to us. We were all
three in line, and at sunset a finer sight could scarcely be imagined.
"We were at a distance of about one-third of a mile from the
Favorit, and plainly, with telescopes, could we distinguish the
Captain and others on board. We waved our handkerchiefs and
the salute was returned, and some of our Australian passengers
gave their aboriginal war-cry, but we fear the “ Favorit’s’’ people
could not hear or did not understand.
This evening gave us a new feature in our amusement list. The
dramatic entertainment which had been preparing for some days
was put upon the boards, and great praise is due to all concerned
for the efficient way they set “ Whitebait at Greenwich ” before us.
Beautiful starlight night the “ Great Bear ” was. seen for the first
time by many of our fellow-passengers. On Sunday, the 22nd,
usual services. In the morning Mr. Daniel read prayers on deck.
We are just entering the tropics and enjoying splendid weather,
as may be easily discovered by the gorgeous display of attire we
witnessed to day amongst our ladies. On the 23rd two ships were
in sight. We signalled to one, and learned she was an American,
but, with the usual politeness of ships of that country, we could
get nothing further out of her. 26th—On this day we had a ship
in sight. She was believed to be the Yankee of yesterday. This
evening was marked by another concert, and we regret to have to
say that it was a weak one. This time we tried three readings,
and the result was that the whole thing dragged. Mrs. Elmslie’s
songs, also that from Mrs. Bell, and Mr. Tegetmeier’s read'ng of


Eugene Aram’s Dream, were well received. Mr. Daniel in the
chair. 25th. —To-day there was a grand quoit tournament for the
gentlemen, which created a good deal of excitement. Mr. Blair
was the winner, and we can honestly compliment him on the way
he played. Mr. Northey, who was second, played three magnifi-
cent games. Miss Edith Elmslie presented the prize—a silver
cross manufactured on board. At sunset some excitement was
caused by the catching of a cockatoo on the lower topsail yard-
arm by one of the sailors; he had been loose all day. Thursday,
26th. —Great preparations being made for St. Helena. About 5
o’clock on Friday morning the outline of this strangely-formed
island began to be visible. We cast the anchor about 8 o’clock,
and shortly after our deck was covered with swarthy indivi-
duals of both sexes selling the wares of the island. After break-
fast several boatloads of our company started for the shore, and a
great rush commenced on the resources of the town for horses
and carriages to visit the “lions.” A few of our number were
successful enough to procure conveyances, but the majority had
to exercise their limbs; the day being very warm, the road very
steep and rough, it was trying after our slight ship-board exercises.
It was amusing to see the groups of passengers standing at the
street corners and shop doors, holding consultations as to how the
mountain was to be ascended, surrounded by numbers of little
niggers all offering useless information. The whole thing looked
like a “ day out ” for the Sabraonites ; heaps of finery which had
been kept dark in boxes, &c., came out for an airing to-day.
Most of us, somehow or another, found our way to Napoleon’s
tomb, and many did still more, and visited the residence of Long-
wood, which was the home of this wonderful man for about five
years.
We think, without exception, each and all of us enjoyed the
day, and after tea the saloon presented the appearance of a bazaar,
the day’s purchases being exhibited. Next morning a good many
found their way on shore again, and the energetic ones managed
to climb to the top of Jacob’s Ladder. Further purchases were
made to-day, and we think that the St. Helena people would like
a “ Sobraon” to visit their little island once a week.
We were all on board again by about 12.30 p.m., and set sail
about 40’clock, with a fresh breeze, and soon lost sight of the island.
The next day was Sunday, the 29th April. We had service on
deck in the morning by Mr. Whitmee, and evening service by
Mr. Daniel.
The weather begins to be decidedly tropical now. We sigh as we
put away our shore-going hats, and lay down our walking-sticks, to
think we shall have no further use for them for six weeks; but
then we console ourselves with the thought that the Sobraon
Mercury has yet a while to live.

CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Editor of the “ Sobraon Mercury .”
Gentlemen, — I am a single, middle-aged man, and, like
“ Observer,’' have passed through those various phases of flirtation
which he says he has done; therefore I think I have as much
right to comment upon flirtation as he has.
In the course of his criticism he comments on a young man
who never had the honour of being much in ladies’ society—sar-


castic remark, indeed, from one who acknowledges that he has
himself passed through all the different phases of flirting. Has
“ Observer” no charity towards beginners ? Does he not remember
when he began? If he ever did—which I very much question —
does he not remember when words would not come, how he
smoked fast and furiously, and thought all the more ? Let me ,
remind this young man, for his encouragement, that one must
walk before one flies, and that Rome was not built in a day. As
regards the young lady cutting you on account of your smoking
habits, do not believe it for one instant. Very, very few ladies
object to smoking. Most of them, when asked whether they
object to it, reply, “ Oh, not at all; I rather like it.” In fact, a
young lady whom I have known some little time, occasionally
even cuts up a gentleman’s tobacco. But do not, gentlemen, let
my remarks lead you to believe that I wish to uphold that it is
good for youths to be inveterate smokers; that is, to be at it at
all times, and in all places. Smoking stunts the growth; also, when
first tried, excites the saliva to an unnatural extent, which, I need
hardly hint to the young man, and also to “ Observer,” is very
objectionable, especially when they are in ladies’ society.
I notice that “ Observer” dares not make any sarcastic remarks
apply to the ladies; he shows his sense there, and it is well he
does. It is a very easy thing to vindicate the “married-man’s ” part,
who walks „ an accomplished young lady ” up and down deck ; it
speaks well for flirtation. He is now trying on the same old game
as he did years and years ago, and I know from his jolly face that
he enjoys it thoroughly. What can I say to the young men who
allow this accomplished young lady to be led off before their very
eyes ? I can but leave them to their thoughts, which, lam sure,
must resemble thosq of that green-eyed monster as old as the
hills. “ Observer ” begins with remarks about flirting; and then,
as if ashamed of what he had written, ends off by saying, “ Flirt
on, ladies and gentlemen;” and also adds, that he has passed
through all the stages of the disease. Gentlemen, as regards this
last remark, I am inclined to disbelieve it in toto. 1 believe he
never had the disease, but that he is some old curmudgeon, who
is so ugly that nobody would ever flirt with him. He is now older
and uglier, thoroughly disliked by the opposite sex, and, like
Giant Grim, contents himself with picking holes and cracking his
knuckles at those who are more happily circumstanced than he is.
He will not let his name be known—well for him ! If it were,
we would hoist him up to the main-yard, or heave him overboard,
as the men of old did to Jonah, thereby appeasing the indignation
of the passengers on board.
Yours truly,
“ Much Ado About Nothing.”


ST. HELENA
A very barren and wretched place St. Helena appeared to most
of us when, on the morning of April 27, we anchored off it. It
is entirely of volcanic origin. Its hills are rugged and precipitous
enough to be grand and beautiful; but the almost entire absence
of vegetation on those parts seen from the ship, made them look
wild and dreary. Our impressions of the place were not much
improved when we landed and saw Jamestown. And, although
there are a few spots on the island which are fairly green, where
cultivation is carried on, they are only just sufficient to make the
general desolation and barrenness more noticeable. Yet St.
Helena was not always thus. Early accounts of the island all
describe it as being covered with vegetation, and as having in
many places dense forests of ebony and other trees. It is gene-
rally believed that the destruction of these forests was chiefly
caused by goats, which were introduced by the first Portuguese
settlers in 1513. This is much regretted by botanists, for the
indigenous flora of the island was one of the most singular in the
whole world. Since the island has been denuded of its forests
the soil which must then have covered the rocks has been blown
and washed away, for now most of the hills are quite bare.
Those who have felt the strength of the trade winds blowing over
the island, and who have experienced what tropical rains and
tropical floods are, will find no difficulty in believing that these
causes will account for the present barrenness of the island. The
productions of the farms and gardens are wheat, barley, oats,
potatoes, pumpkins, and some other vegetables; water-cresses
are plentifuHn the streams. We were much disappointed in the
fruits we were able to obtain; a few rathet; poor bananas, some
moderately good figs and passion-fruits, some wretchedly hard
and flavourless pears, poor peaches, and insipid prickly pears,
were about all the productions we found.
We saw one or two miserable-looking cocoanut trees without
fruit, and a few date palms. As to the gardens of the place, they
seem all to have shared largely in the general retrogression ex-
perienced by everything upon the island. We were not favour-
ably impressed with the inhabitants as a whole. There are some
respectable residents and shop-keepers; but most of them seem
to possess little energy. The governor is a native, and, according
to report, has never been away from the island. Hence it is easy
to account for his lack of enterprise. A greater variety in the
shades of a people it would perhaps be hard to find in any part of
the world, except in some of the West India Islands. We saw
few purely white women : most had more or less African blood in
their veins. The streets were full of children, and from what we


saw, we should judge that there is no fear of the native popula-
tion dying out. Churches and schools are plentiful. There is a
bishop of the island, with a staff of two or three clergymen.
There is also a Baptist church and clergyman in Jamestown. All
the children have an opportunity of receiving a common educa-
tion, and we understood that all availed themselves of the privi-
lege. The garrison of the place is still kept up, about 200 soldiers
being on the island at the present time. We also saw a number
of policemen, looking after the urchins in the streets. There are
also two good hospitals, one military, the other civil; the latter
has proved a great blessing to sick sailors, who have been left in
it by passing ships. As far as we could learn there is only one
hotel in Jamestown. We saw one or two large houses, formerly
hotels, but now closed. There is a good hotel at Longwood,
near Napoleon’s grave, much to the comfort and'convenience of
visitors after a hot drive, or hotter walk, on pilgrimage to that
place. The house in which Napoleon died, and the tomb in
which he was originally buried, are kept in excellent order at the
expense of the French nation. After his death the house was
allowed to fall into a dilapidated condition—in fact, it was in a
ruinous state in 1840, when the body of Napoleon was removed
to Paris. But in 1858 both-the house and the tomb, with several
acres of land on which they are situated, were ceded to the French,
and the house was renewed, so as to be as nearly like what it was
when its illustrious occupant died as was possible. They are now
under the care of an officer of the French army, who bears the
tide of “ Guardian of the Residence, and of the Tomb of the
Emperor Napoleon the First,” who has subordinates under him.
These subordinates very politely show visitors what is to be seen,
and refuse any presents which may be offered to them. The
famous weeping willows near the tomb have lost many of their
branches, and are going to decay, ‘Owing to the scarcity of
horses and carriages in St. Helena, most of our party had to walk
to Longwood ; but even those who had the hot and tiring walk
felt well repaid by seeing the place, as intimately connected with
the memory of the Great Napoleon.
The supply of water is very good in many parts of the island.
The people of Jamestown have good water brought in pipes from
the higher part of the valley in which the town is situated, and
the pipes run out to the landing-place, so that ships are easily
watered by means of water-boats.
Game is found.on the island; partridges, pheasants, and rabbits
were introduced long ago, and have become plentiful. Persons
shooting them have to take out licenses, which enable them to
shoot for three months only in the year.
A license, costing 10s. a-year, is also required for the catching


of small birds, such as the canaries, Java sparrows, and averde-
vats. This, however, is done, not for the sake of the trifling
revenue, but to prevent the birds being destroyed by the constant
catching of them for sale to passing ships.

RHYMES, IF NOT REASON.
To my ditties come all of you list, oh !
First of all, of a young man called Bristow,
His stature is slight, his beard very bright
And the chance of a “Nap” he ne’er missed, oh !
There is an old fellow named Knox,
A cautious and canny old fox ;
On the jib-boom he’ll lay, and smoke all the day,
And he stands five feet eight in his socks.
The next is a young man called Blair,
Whose altitude makes people stare;
Indeed, it is said, that he carries his head
In an atmosphere unknown and rare.
Little Elkin’s the next one I see ;
A jolly young fellow is he.
His accomplishments rare, and his thick head of hair,
Proclaim him a genius to be.
There is a young man, Bond by name,
A very ’cute chap at a game ;
With a solemn old air and a petrified glare,
He will win or will lose,-just the same.
Next comes Absolom, who, it is said,
Every night gorges freely in bed;
Hence his boisterous dreams, when he mutters and screams
And, I’m told, even stands on his head.
Amongst us I see Tegetmeier,
Who’d play chess in the midst of a fire ;
If the ship were a wreck, he would calmly say “check,”
And think he had nought to desire.
Then there’s Pearce, always cool and serene,
Whose nature is far, far from green;
All the best wine about he buys up, and the stout,
And stows them in cabin eighteen.


Festive Charlton must not be passed o’er;
With his laugh like an elephant’s roar,
Very often at night it wakes people in fright,
For which some of us count him a bore.
Of Doyle I have not much to say ;
A frugal young man in his way,
From Erin’s fair clime he has wandered some time
And returns now to “ praties” and “ tay.”
There is a young doctor named Boodle,
Who is docile and quiet as a poodle,
But when one is ill his tact and his skill
Proves plainly he is not a noodle.
Last comes Miller, with Barker the tall,
Before whom I sing very small,
For if they incline to make light of my rhyme
I shall find it not published at all.
(Signed) Another White Mouse.
It is rumoured that two marriages in high life are on the tapis ,
namely, Miss ****** and Mr. ******* and Miss ***** and
Mr. **** We trust, should the settlements be arranged satis-
factorily, the marriage ceremony will be performed on board.
The baker indignantly denies that he cannot make better cakes
than those we have on Sundays, and says should he be fortunate
enough to receive the order, he will guarantee a wedding cake
superior to any obtainable on shore.

4th May, 1877.
To the Editors of the “ Sohraon Mercury .”
Gentlemen, — It has been said that the chief point of honour in
men is courage. I shall not here enlarge at length on that which
passes for this chief point, nor of the satisfaction it gives the mind ;
this I leave for abler pens than mine to handle. My object now
is simply to record an incident which, occurring as it did, is worthy
of note; and, looking at the circumstances under which it hap-
pened, the probability is few are acquainted with the matter
at all.
I shall present the reader with the circumstances for the specu-
lation of the day, after having premised that if there is anything in
this paper the authenticity of which may be doubted, the reader
will consider this as the sentiment of several, and if necessary the
matter can be corroborated.
It was on Friday morning last. We all know how hot and sultry
it was; most of the passengers were at breakfast, some had gone
ashore, a few were on deck, and I, walking aft with the intention
of landing, and “doing” the famous Jacob's Ladder (now the
subject of so much debate), was startled by the cry “ A man over-
board,” We all know the effect of such a cry ; I had scarcely
time to turn round before the cook rushed passed me, and disap-
peared over the bulwarks. I, with several of the natives who
stood by, was quickly at the side of the vessel, anxious to render,
if possible, any assistance; and looking, we saw joung Chris.,
supporting, as well as he could, a boy called Waters, who, kicking
out like a rabbit, seemed to be trying his best to go under. Away
on the left, some thirty yards distant, were several of the midship-
men sporting about and enjoying the luxury of a swim in the
ocean, and they, not being able to hear the cry of their companion,
were striking even further away.
The cook, however, was at hand, and he, without a moment’s
hesitation, leaped into the water, and, in spite of Professor Beck-
with’s instruction that “ one should be cautious, and that it is ex-
tremely dangerous to attempt the rescue of anyone unless you
approach them from behind,” swam straight up to him. By this
time a boat was at hand, and Chris., who was nearly exhausted,
together with Waters, was lifted into the boat, the latter looking
as if the two or three pints of water which he must have swallowed,
was not to be repeated, if he could possibly help it.
Now, gentlemen, these are the simple facts, and here is an in-
stance of a bold spirit, actuated by a sense of honour and duty;
as such, the least we could do, would be to manifest our recog-
nition of this brave act, by presenting a testimonial, and, I think,


a favourable recommendation to the Royal Humane Society would
not be out of place.
I am, Gentlemen,
Yours truly,
“ Eye Witness.”
[Not in the least disparaging the magnanimous conduct of the
cook, we think the greater praise is due to Chris. Elmslie on
this occasion, through whose instrumentality the boy’s life was
rescued. —Editors.]
FLIRTATION.
Flirtation on ship-board ! oh, what does it mean?
Some bright, pleasant hours ; a short, happy dream;
Some laughing, some chatting remarks on the run ;
Vague hints as to meeting when the journey’s done.
Proffers of books, telescopes, maps ;
Solicitous care in the arrangements of wraps;
Low whispered words, perchance a soft sigh;
Aimless loud talking should any draw nigh.
What will it end in ? to what does it tend ?
Ask the chief actors; they’ll answer, A friend
Is so pleasant on sea; of course, when near land,
A smiling good-bye and squeeze of the hand
Is all that is needed ; for pleasant time spent,
Many thanks from both parties, we hope you ’re content.
Pearl.
VV7 ANTED —Steady, sober person to take charge of a Gentleman,

everybody is flirting, or wishing to flirt; at times, jealousy makes

coat to prevent him drowning himself in printer’s ink.—Apply,

Now, if I’ve slighted in my ditty anyone, oh, please have pity;
Forgive it all before we reach our destined port, Great London
City.
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS.
Our late surgical cases are now recovered and going about as
usual. Mr, Blair, who for two days was an object of interest with
his little finger in a splint from a severe sprain, has so far recovered
as to have left it off for some time.
Our call at St. Helena was no doubt beneficial to the general
health, and we cannot tell how many illnesses we might have had
to record, now happily averted by it—but many of those who
indulged in severe pedestrian exercise suffered a good deal from
stiffness from it. The birds put on board at the island lower the
health average by dying in great numbers, seeming to get no
benefit from a sea voyage. We have had a slight epidemic of
colds, which seems to have passed off without doing much harm.
Prickly heat is very troublesome, especially among the children.
Change of air, to a colder climate, is recommended as soon as
possible.
We have one death we deeply regret to record : Mr. Absolom’s
well known “Joey” is no more. He was not known to have
suffered from any disease, and his death was sudden and unex-
pected. He is lamented by a large circle of friends, while all that
remains-of him—his beautiful plumage—will carry down the
memory of his many perfections for future generations.

Sobraon Mercury
FOURTH NUMBER. [June, 1877.
NOTES ON THE VOYAGE.
Our last publication continued the little history of our voyage
to the 30th April, and since that date nothing very startling has
happened to vary the usual monotony of ship life.
The weather has been wonderfully fine, and during the time we
were in the vicinity of the Line we were treated to a very fair taste
of tropical heat. We were fortunate in getting a steady breeze
which carried us to about 27 O N. During the greater part of this
last week we have been becalmed, and our chances of making a
quick passage seem rather poor; our spirits, too, begin to flag
when we think how near home, and how perfectly helpless we
are without a breeze.
On the Ist May, in the evening, Mr. Daniel continued his
lecture on “ The Book : Its Assailants and Defence,” on deck—
when Mr. Upton took the chair.
On the 2nd a grand Chess Tournament took place, and every
available board and set of men were in use, and it seemed to- be
the only topic of conversation for the time being, amongst its
devotees. May 3rd. —Sighted Ascension to the W. at 3 a.m.,and
at 6 o’clock we were about 12 miles distant and had a good view
of its rugged and precipitous outline. We saw a good number
of the Island birds, boobies, boatswains, &c. Weather very
warm. May 4th. —Very warm day again. In the evening our
second Spelling Bee took place, and Miss Upton was the success-
ful competitor. May sth was a weighing-day, and we suppose
the warm weather accounts for the decrease in weight amongst
most of us. Sunday 6th.—Mr. Daniel took morning service on
deck, and Mr. Whitmee also on deck in the evening. We are getting
some squally weather just now. On the 9th there was a grand


storm of rain about 6.30 a.m. and a number of us took advantage of
the opportunity of having a fresh water bath. Very warm day again.
On the 10th, about 6 o’clock in the morning we spoke a barque
named “Pakquan,” 26 days from London, bound to Adelaide;
she wished to- be reported. A Draught Tournament began to-day.
In the evening Mr. Whitmee delivered a lecture on the races and
languages of Polynesia. On the nth Mr. Nicholson took a boat
out for the purpose of sounding, &c. The weather is oppressively
hot. In the afternoon there was a shark playing about the ship.
On the 12th Miss Blair presented the prize to the winner of the
Chess Tournament, Mr. Grubb. A ship was seen to leeward this
evening, and the monotony of the day was broken by the sight
of a shoal of porpoises. Monday 14th. —Fine N.E. breeze all day;
about lunch time we sighted a brigantine on the weather bow, and
at 5 o’clock we overhauled her, and speaking her discovered her
to be a Dutch vessel named “Nellie.” More cool and pleasant
weather.
15th. After dinner to-day we experienced one of the greatest
excitements of the voyage. We came up with a French barque,
and to our question, Peace or War ? were informed that Turkey
and Russia were at war— this, unfortunately, was all the news we
could obtain from her. We also sighted a fine steamer, and sup-
posed her to be one of Messrs. Donald Currie and Co.’s line. On
the 16th, a ship was seen about three miles to leeward, but we
were unable to distinguish her signals ; good breeze. On the 18th,
evening, we had our second dramatic entertainment, viz., a repre-
sentation of the trial of Bardell v. Pickwick. Mrs. Bardell and
Mr. Pickwick were very well got up, and we may say the whole
thing passed off very satisfactorily. 19th. Sat. Spoke a ship
named “ Britannia,” from Banff, 218 tons —she had no news to give
us. On the 20th, Mr. Daniel took morning service and Mr,
Whitmee read prayers and preached in the evening. Considerable
quantity of gulfweed about the ship to-day. Sighted several ships,
but obtained no news. Monday 21st. N.E. trades left us. A
ship crossed our bows this morning and confirmed the news we
had last week, that Turkey and Russia were at war. In the evening
Mr. Whitmee spun a very interesting yarn respecting his travels
and experiences in the Islands of the Pacific ; Mr. Upton took
the chair, and the sailors sung some good songs. Tuesday, 22nd.
Mr. Bristow played the final game of draughts with Mr. Grubb,
and beating him, proved himself the champion of the ship. Two
or three excursions were made in one of the ship’s boats to-day,
and our old ship really looked exceedingly well with all her sails
set. At dinner time we had a heavy shower of rain, which made
the decks unpleasantly damp for the rest of the evening.
24th May. In the evening, Mr. Daniel gave a yarn to the crew


upon his reminiscences of the colonies, &c.; Mr. Lindley took the
chair.
Subsequently, the captain was good enough to give us an oppor-
tunity of seeing the use of the magnesium light for vessels in dis-
tress or when a man is overboard. We also had some rockets in
honour of the Queen’s birthday. 25th. Beautiful weather—a
boat excursion in the morning—a fine whale on the port side
this afternoon. To-night we had the pleasure of another concert,
and we think we may safely say that it was our chef d'ouvre in that
line; the whole performance seemed to have more spirit. The
programme contained the following names : The Misses Daniel
and Mrs. Bell, Captain Elmslie, Rev. S J. Whitmee, Messrs.
Tegetmeier, Absolom, Elkin, Charlton, Miller, and Sennett. We
hear our energetic musical sub-committee do not intend dying
without and for want of an effort, and are making frantic endeavours
to get another concert on the boards. “ Bless them, we have
packing and other things to think of now,’’ are the murmurings
that reach us. On Sunday, 27th, at 2 a.m., a three-masted schooner
passed us about half-a-mile distant, but of course we were unable
to speak her. Usual services took place in the morning by Mr.
Whitmee on deck and Mr. Daniel in the saloon in the evening.
Monday, 28th, at 10 a.m., sighted a brigantine, outward bound,
Mr. Nicholson, Mr, Elkin, and a boat’s crew boarded her in the
dingy. She was of Portuguese nationality, named Carolina, from
Porto. The captain, however, was unable to communicate any
news, even if he knew any. We learnt that they had been 25 days
from Portugal, and were bound to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Wind
rising this evening, and rain fell about 6 o’clock.
At n.30 a.m. on the 29th, we were about thirty miles
from St. Mary, in the Azores, but it was not visible. _ At two
o’clock we came in sight of St. Michael’s, and passed the island to
the E. at five o’clock. Evidences of the close of our voyage are
now becoming plentiful, painting and varnishing keeping the
hands employed.
30th. Blowing pretty hard. Royals taken in during the even-
ing and a reef in the mainsail at 10 p.m. Saw two ships, one
outward bound, and the other a barque steering for the Spanish
coast. Weather decidedly cooler. 31st. Very heavy night.
Those who got any sleep were fortunate, the rolling and the
noises on deck, consequent on shortening sail, being enough to
disturb the soundest ‘sleeper. Before breakfast the mainsail was
split to shreds, and the lower topsail carried away. Running
before the wind under topsails and foresail all day, and occasional
seas breaking over the main deck gave us some excitement. Wind
dropped a little towards evening, and enabled us to get more rest
to-night. We are now in the Bay of Biscay, and can only hope
that a few more days will see us safely landed on our native shore.


OUTWARD BOUND.
It may be interesting to my fellow passengers on board the
“ Sobraon,” now that the good ship has so nearly brought us to
the termination of our rather uneventful voyage, to hear some par-
ticulars of a voyage from London to Melbourne, which was as
full of incidents as this one of ours as been barren.
It is some few years ago that, for the benefit of my health, I
accepted the opportunity afforded me of a trip to Melbourne, in a
comfortable sailing ship of 1,100 tons. Besides myself, there were
no other passengers, our cargo consisting principally of railway
iron, grindstones, and spirits, and before leaving the Thames we
received a further addition to this, in the shape of about twenty-
five tons of gunpowder, and the same quantity of dynamite. These
were all stowed separately, the dynamite being placed forward,
and the gunpowder directly under the after saloon.
From the very commencement of our voyage things showed an
indication of going the reverse of smoothly. It did not take us
long to discover that the steward was given to getting drunk, in
which rather objectionable practice he was ably seconded by the
cook. The crew also, with few exceptions, were a bad lot,
and of the half-dozen or more different nationalities to which they
belonged, it would have been difficult to say which had the worst
representative.
The first little incident that occurred, beyond such trifles as the
cook deciding to go to bed about mid-day, and leaving all culinary
operations to look after themselves, or the steward coming to grief
with an assortment of crockery in his hands, was when we had
been out about a fortnight.
One of the crew, named Mike, an Irishman, and the most tur-
bulent one of the whole lot, had a difference of opinion wjth a
German named Hansen, who was in the same watch as himself.
This difference of opinion they decided to settle by a trial of
strength, and in the battle that ensued, Hansen got decidedly
licked. To make things square he pulled out his knife, and thus
armed went for his antagonist once more, but Mike promptly
caught up a belaying pin, and with a well-directed blow brought
him to to the ground. When the captain came up, for this
was in the middle of the night, and the sailors in a body had pre-
vented the officer of the watch from interfering, the German
appeared to be dead, and it was a long time before he showed
any signs of life. After two or three days, however, he reco-
vered and got to w r ork again, the captain removing him to the
other watch, so that he should not come into such frequent
contact with his opponent.


A few days after this" Mike was again the central figure in
another rather exciting episode.
1 he first mate had found fault with him for the slovenly way he
did his work, and Mike answering him in an offensive and insult-
ing manner, the mate very ill-advisedly knocked him down.
Another of the men then came up, and going to Mike’s assistance
they both of them set on to the mate, who, however, thanks to his
great strength, was able to more than hold his own, till the captain
appeared on the scene, and with the aid of the two or three decent
fellows among the crew put a stop to the fighting. The remainder
of the men, though they took no active part in the affair, plainly
showed whom their sympathies were with, refused to put the
offenders in confinement when ordered to do so, and it was evi-
dent that they would resist such order being carried out. For the
next six weeks or so things went on in a very unsatisfactory state.
The authority of the officers was very often openly defied. Brawls
among the men were of everyday occurrence, and in all the mis-
chief that happened the man Mike was the ruling spirit. It was
not long, however, before justice overtook him. After rounding
the Cape we had very heavy weather for nearly the remainder of
our voyage, and in one storm which lasted with more or less vio-
lence for about eight days, Mike met with the reward of his ill
deeds. All hands were aloft furling the mainsail, Mike was on the
end of the yard and separated from him by one man was the Ger-
man Hansen with whom he had had the row at the commence-
ment of the voyage. Now the extremity of the mainyard during
the height of a storm is not a favourable situation for men to
quarrel in, but the hatred of these two men blazed out even there.
Hansen said something particularly obnoxious to Mike, and Mike
in attempting to return him a blow, let go his hold of the yard,
and fell into the water. Of course with the tremendous sea on,
and the rate we were going, it was impossible to make any attempt
to save him.
It was just about this time that we discovered the ship
was making water to an alarming extent, and during the gale
it was as much as we could do to keep it under, each watch being
engaged for over two hours at the pumps. The leak was discovered
to be just above the water line, and, except in rough weather,
would not give us much trouble. Fortunately we were able to
keep it under during the storm, though if the same weather had
lasted longer it mightFave gone hard with us. The sudden death
of Mike and the danger we were situated in appeared to have
frightened the men, in fact they had now no time for quarrelling,
for all their energies were required to work the ship, and for the
remainder of the passage they behaved themselves more decently.
At last we arrived in Hobson’s Bay. Before going alongside


the pier we had to get rid of the explosive portion of our cargo,
but we discovered that in the knocking about we had gone through
two of the kegs of gunpowder had got broken and the gun-
powder spilt. The authorities would not allow the ship to leave
the outer anchorage until we had discharged the exact quantity
we were shown to have on board, and as without removing all the
after portion of the cargo sufficient only could be found to fill one
keg, the captain was at a loss what to do.
At last he hit upon the brilliant idea of buying sufficient gun-
powder in Melbourne to fill the empty keg, and bringing it on
board to pass it off as what we had brought from London.
This was successfully carried out, and we went alongside the
pier, having about fifteen pounds of gunpowder still on board.
When the cargo was discharged the gunpowder was found. It
had dribbled down between the boards placed underneath it, and
when we came upon it was calmly reposing in cakes between the
grindstones and railway iron. How it got there without exploding
I am unable to understand and can only conclude that the daws of
nature must have been put in abeyance on our account.
Wanderer.
KANGAROO HUNTING.
Oh, how many a glorious day do these two words recall! To
lovers of the field and its sports a more ’ pleasurable and exciting
day can hardly be spent anywhere than amongst the “ wary mar-
supials” in the Australian bush.
During the last two years it has been my lot to spend some
months in the bush of New South Wales, and on most occasions,
when work on the stations has been slack, we have made up a
party, taken our dogs, and thoroughly enjoyed a day’s hunting.
Being a new chum, my experience in rough riding was limited;
but, confessing my said want of experience, my friends gave me
quiet horses to start with.
Now' imagine a beautiful fresh spring morning, with a nice cool
breeze and a bright, warm sun ; a morning that Australians know
well, and that I have never seen in any other country; a party of
four or five jolly young fellows leaving the station, their pipes in
their mouths, their horses seeming to know that some fun awaits
them, and three or four dogs chasing one another, and doing their
utmost to show their delight at being off the chain. Presently
some one says, “ I think a canter would be a fair thing,” and no
sooner said than done. Off they go, leaving a cloud of dust, and
after about a quarter to half a mile the leader pulls up and the


rest follow suit. There are always little spots on a station which
are “ likely places,” and for the nearest one we make. Often,
however, as the old gamekeeper said, “ Those places which seem
most likeliest, is often less likelier nor those places which is least
likeliestand we have to start off at a canter again to seek fresh
pastures. Suddenly we hear one of the party shout out “ Here,
Sydney ! old man. Fly ! here. Hector ! here old man. Sulim,
Sulim.” There is no need to look about us, for away we have to
go at a terrific pace, the horses guiding us in and out amongst the
trees, while the dogs are tearing on as hard as ever their legs can
carry them after a mob of kangaroos, each dog, or at any rate two
dogs, singling out one and chasing him for bare life. We gene-
rally are not far behind, unless a fence or some other impediment
comes in the way. The horses are as eager as the dogs and
won't give in till the kangaroo is either stuck up or thrown.
Sometimes we would get a run of about three quarters of a mile,
and it truly is a grand sight to see the kangaroos tearing away,
leaping about twenty feet at a time, and the dogs racing after them,
with those graceful movements a well-bred hound is so noted for.
A really good dog will run alongside his kangaroo, waiting his
opportunity to seize him by the hip, or any place he can catch
hold of, to throw him, and when once on the ground his chance
is but small. We were generally in the habit of carrying a rifle
amongst us, that we might put the poor brutes out of their misery
as soon as possible. Many of the large kangaroos show fight, and
if you have no rifle with you it is very hard work to dispatch them.
One day I remember three of us and two dogs chased an “ old
man ” into a waterhole. We were altogether unarmed, and had
to resort to sticks and stones. The first stick that was thrown
brought him out of the waterhole, and he made straight at the
fellow who threw it, but fortunately on that occasion my friend got
off with only a scratch. He apparently spotted this fellow as his
greatest enemy, for a few minutes after he went fur him again, and
this time jumped on the horse’s back, unseated my friend, tearing
his hand and scratching the saddle. The horse bucked and
bolted. A few minutes after the kangaroo receiving a blow from
a stone, rushed at this gentleman again, and chased him at full
speed up a hill for 100 yards, with the dogs in the rear, and not
being able to overtake him, he once more took to the water. I
am ashamed to say that it now became too dark, and we were
forced to leave him fhere, scratching himself and bidding defiance
to us. Notwithstanding all that people say respecting the dulness
of the bush, you may even there get some enjoyment and excite-
ment to occupy your leisure hours.
‘‘New Chum.”


THE PARTING.
Good-bye, good-bye, and is it so?
And must I from my darling sever ?
Oh cruel fate to bid me go,
When I would cling to thee for ever.
But, dearest, must we, must we part?
Is all our joy so quickly fleeting?
To leave thee now will break my heart,
My heart that but for thee is beating. ■
'Twas thus I heard a lover sigh,
His fervent tones deep anguish telling,
As Albion’s shores drew quickly nigh,
And all our thoughts on land were dwelling.
The fair maid hung her listless head,
And tears from her bright eyes were flowing,
Too full of grief, she little said,
Her grief was far too deep for showing.
Ah me ! thought I, a few short days,
And all this anguish will be over,
To some one else he’ll frame his lays,
And she will greet some other lover.
“ Stoic.”
A few years ago there was a civil war in the Samoan Islands,
the cause of the war being the rival claims of two chiefs to the
kingship. One day a large war party came from the Island of
Savaii to join their allies on the Island of Upolu. It so happened
that they called in at a neutral village, where my house was
situated, to rest themselves for a few hours. The party which
opposed them was apprised of their movements, and in an hour
or two had surrounded the place, to cut off their progress towards
their place of rendezvous. My house was just outside the village,
on the side which the war party wished to go, so we were between
the two parties. There would have been instant collision between
them, but for the fact that we were thus placed. During the
remainder of that day some natives who were neutral were trying
to induce them to refrain from fighting there, but neither party
was willing to give way to the other, both were unwilling to fight
while we were at home, and they wished me to take my family
away to a missionary’s house five miles distant, or else to keep all


within doors and protect ourselves from stray bullets, and let them
light it out the next day.
I found out it was impossible to keep them from fighting, and
at the earnest entreaty of a number of the people I resolved to
take my family away.
Harold was then three days old, and Mrs, Whitmee was of
course not fit for a journey ; but if we had remained, there would
have been much excitement for her, and the children would have
been terrified at the firing of guns, while all our servants
were utterly useless from the effects of excitement and consterna-
tion, so that I thought there was less risk in removing than in
remaining ; we therefore had our large boat prepared and left
about noon next day.
An hour after we left, the fighting commenced. It was thickest
just behind my house. After a severe skirmish, the Bavaii party
drpve off their assailants, and made their way to their allies. The
loss of life was only four or five on each side, these native wars
seldom resulting in much slaughter. After we returned home,
the marks of bullets were to be seen on the trees, and one of the
children picked one up in the garden, but we had no damage done.
During that war the opposing forces were encamped for some
time within three miles of my house. I often had occasion to
pass through both.of these camps. There was never much hard
fighting at them ; but generally a good deal of firing towards
evening. Their skirmishes almost always began in the evening.
I used to think it was in order that they might soon get relief, if
either side should be hard pressed, for they always ceased fighting
at nightfall.
One day I was returning home and had to pass through the
two war camps. As I approached them I found they had com-
menced the usual firing on each other earlier than usual. But I
rode on, thinking I might pass some way or other. As soon as
ever I got in sight of the first fort, I heard the people call out
“ Hold, here is the missionary coming.” So the firing ceased. I
then rode briskly on through the palisading which enclosed the
camp to reach the open, space between the lines, so that the
opposite side might soon see me.
As soon as one espied me he passed the word above, and firing
instantly ceased, until I was safely across. This is, I imagine, a kind
of warfare which is rarely to be found at the present time.

A FAREWELL.
Once more, and for the last time, do we address the Sobraon
Mercury which is ere long to die a natural death, except, in so
far, as it remains in our memories. But we hope it will soon be
resuscitated in a new form, in which it can be referred to as a
memento of our social life on board the “Sobraon” and which
it is to be hoped will be associated with many pleasant reflections
to most of us.
Very various, and no doubt widely differing, have been the
motives and aspirations of each one of us, who have been thus
voyaging together during the past three months, a small com-
munity so to speak. Setting sail upon the wide ocean, how little
we knew of the dangers and difficulties which might have over-
taken us, but we have through the dispensations of a Divine
Providence been thus far protected from all harm.
We have every reason to rest secure in the careful and efficient
seamanship of Captain Ehnslie and his officers. And we hope
that favourable winds and weather will enable us safely and
swiftly to reach our desired haven—where each one of us will
soon be eager for the realisation of our hopes and aims.
We shall separate, some of us probably never to meet again.
Scattered, as we shall soon be, we can yet sometimes think kindly
of each other, and earnestly wish success to all in everything that
is for their good. To those who are anticipating the happiness of
seeing dear friends, from whom they have long been separated,
may it indeed be a joyous meeting !
Oh, kindred’s ties, how dear thou art to me!
Thou hast been as a beacon guiding o’er the sea ;
Without affection life would be a blank indeed ;
And ’tis a lore of which the high and lowly both may read.

Last Sunday evening, the 3rd June, the' Rev. S. J. Whitmee
preached a sermon on behalf of the Royal Alfred Aged Merchant
Seamen’s Institution, and the Merchant Seamen’s Orphan Asylum;
and at the close of the service a collection was made in aid of the
funds of these institutions, which, we are pleased to say, amounted
to the sum of ,£l3. 12 s.
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS.
We are sorry, in this last number of the Mercury, not to be
able to report all well. Mrs. Zevenboum has been suffering from


rheumatic fever for the last three weeks, and though considerably
better, is still confined to her cabin and bed. We hope, however,
that the change to land will soon restore her to health. The very
oppressive weather we endured while becalmed near the line
proved very trying, especially to those in delicate health. The
gale on Thursday brought back, in some degree, to many of the
passengers the unpleasant sensations which formed the chief cha-
racteristic of the first few days of the voyage. It was also the
probable cause of some pea-soup, intended for internal use only,
being applied in a scalding state to the outer surface of one of the
sailors. The results of the unfortunate upset, though not serious
to life, were very painful, and have laid the man up ever since.
The last weighing-day showed in most cases a greater increase
than could be accounted for by the thicker clothes it has become
necessary to put on, and altogether we hope that most of us are
in better condition than when we left Melbourne.

L’ENVOI.
With this number our duties end; but before laying down the
editorial pen, we will take a cursory glance at the career of our
periodical.
Its first issue made its appearance on the nth April, and this,
the last, makes our fourth publication. We regret our start was
so late in life on the ocean wave, and our modesty prevents our
saying much of what there is ; but we hope our readers are
satisfied.
Contributors have not been many; but to those who have
taken any trouble, and thus interested themselves for the journal,
we tender our best thanks. We have endeavoured to keep our
columns as free as possible from anything likely to give offence,
and we trust, so far, our efforts have succeeded, and that no one
bears a grudge against either the Sobraon Mercury or its editors.
And now, in taking the last farewell of our friends and fellow-
voyagers, we feel sure all join in our hearty thanks to Captain
Elmslie for all he has done towards making our passage as agree-
able as possible, and so ably piloting us through the dangers of
the deep; and, with these, words, the Sobraon Mercury closes its
short life—wishing you all the greatest enjoyments Old England
can afford !
