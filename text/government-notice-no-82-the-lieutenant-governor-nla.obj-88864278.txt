His Excellency, In directing the publication of these Rewards, requests
that every Master will impress upon his Servants, that upon every occasion, on
which an equally good and determined spirit is manifested by any of them,
equally liberal Rewards will lie given.
Mis Excellency also takes this opportunity of calling’ upon the Settlers
generally to co-operale w ith the GOVERNMENT in adopting measures for the
immediate capture of the present Gang of Bushrangers, for although their
number he inconsiderable, it is only by taking active and decided measures
at tiie beginning that ap evil like the present may be prevented from becoming
formidable.
The Lieutenant« Governor would Observe, that assistance may most effec-
tually be rendered by BETTLERB—in the first place, by a MJESOLW7TR
HÆWÆJVCÆ of their own Premises—in the second place, by giving, whenever
the BUSHfitAN GERS may appear, the earliest possible Information to the
nearest Police Magistrate, and Military Party—and in the third place, by
scouring the part of the Country in Which they are supposed to be, and His
Excellency thinks it right to add, that the GOVEIMEiT has taken prompt
anti decisive measures for securing these JLÆIW'JLMHH JDJEPUJEP»!POMPS,
