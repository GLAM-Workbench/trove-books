DEDICATION
This tribute to the early days of Temora
is dedicated to the memory of the great-heart-
ed men and brave-souled women who pion-
eered the South-West. Particularly do we
desire to pay a tribute to the mothers, the
wives and the daughters who stood so nobly
behind the early pioneers—whether miners,
farmers or squatters. Through good and
through ill—through cloud and through sun-
shine—they were a help and inspiration to
sons, husbands, fathers and brothers and de-
serve all the good things that can be said or
written about them.
Those brave old days, now fading, like some
glorious sunset
That flings above the world its glorious after-
glow;
Our skies are radiant with the lights of their
for-all-time story,
Who pioneered Australia in the years of long
ago.


TEMORA’S EARLY HISTORY
WRITTEN FOR THE “INDEPENDENT” BY MR. WATSON A. STEELE, MEMBER OF THE ROYAL
AUSTRALIAN HISTORICAL SOCIETY, AND A RESIDENT OF TEMORA IN 1882-1884.
Introduction
rpHIS YEAR BEING THE JUBILEE
of the foundation of Temora, it
may be opportune to recall some
events in its history.
The following articles are written
specially for the Temora “Independ-
ent,” the senior newspaper in the dis-
trict. The first articles deal briefly
with early history and personal rem-
iniscences of the writer. The second
give biographical sketches of some of
the prominent pioneers. The former
hate been diligently compiled from
available official records, Department
al reports, private letters, and person-
al experience; the latter from publi-
cations, and the recollection of facts
by a man of good memory. The
whole (except, perhaps, for some
minor errors) can be generally ac-
cepted as accurate.
To which might be added the writer
has a wide knowledge of Australian
history; is a member of a pioneer
family resident in Australia over one
hundred years; was tw'o & a half years
a resident of early Temora; and was
a property owner and ratepayer of
the town from 1883 to 1925, keeping
in touch with its progress and visiting
it periodically. He hopes, also, they
will give both pleasure and informa
tion to the descendants of the sturdy
miners who worked in the old shafts,
and to those of the no less enterpris-
ing and bold settlers on the land who
carved homes out of the wilderness,
and formed what are to-day the most
prolific wheatficlds of the State.
The First White Men
on the Bland
The first white men to penetrate the
country we call “The Bland” belonged
to the expedition fitted out by Gov-
ernor Macquarie, under instructions
from Earl Bathurst, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, in 1817, fol-
lowing the discoveries -of Bathurst
Plains and the Macquarie and Lach-
lan Rivers by Assistant Surveyor G
W. Evans, in 1813-1815. The leader-
ship of the party was conferred upon
Lieut. John Oxley, R.N., Surveyor-
General, who left Bathurst on the
20tn April, 1817, and passing south of
Carcoar, crossed the Lachlan six miles
below Cowra, and reached Evans’
furthest point about five miles from
Eugowra. After many days spent in
attempting to follow the river (being
baffled by swamps and lagoons, which
were full owing to a wet autumn) he
turned south past Lake Cowal, with
the intention of reaching the south
coast of Australia at Cape North-
umberland In the course of this
journey he traversed the Bland
country, and on 18th June, 1817, was
in the vicinity of Mirrool. Blocked
by dense eucalyptus scrub, and want
ing, grass and water, he turn-
ed north-west and reached the Lach-
lan again, and followed it below Booli-
gal. From there he turned back, and
made for the Macquarie, discovered
Wellington Valley, and returned to'
Bathurst, 29th August, 1817.
The men who first discovered the
Bland were:—
Lieut. John Oxley, R.N., Surveyor-
General, in command; Mr. G. W
Evans, Assistant Surveyor, second in
WATSON A. STEELE
Accountant at Bank of N.S.W., Te-
mora, 1882-1884, now resident at
Beecroft.
command (the discoverer of Bathurst,
1813); Mr. Allan Cunningham, Chief
Botanist (the discoverer of Darling
Downs, 1827); Mr. Chas Frazer, Colo-
nial Botanist; William Parr (Miner-
alogist).
George Hubbard (boat-builder),
James King (boatman), John King
(ho’-se-shoer), William Meggs (butch-
er), Patrick Byrne (guide), William
Blake (harness-mender), George
Simpson (chainman), William Worner
(Mr. Oxleys servant).
For the next thirteen years after
Oxley’s expedition, up to 1830, the
bounds of southern settlement did not
reach much further than Yass, nor of
western settlement beyond Cowra.
The fixed western boundary of the
Colony at that time, beyond which
“land was neither leased nor sold,”
ran from Wellington to Molong, then
to Orange, and east of Cowra, and on
to Burrowa and Yass. In that year,
however, “squatters” in “one’s and
twos” penetrated further inland
along hte banks of the Murrumbidgee
and Lachlan, in spite of the Govern-
ment prohibition. But even in 1830,
when Captain Sturt led his expedition
down the Murrumbidgee, to discover
the Murray, the furthest stations
down that river were O’Brien’s (Jugi-
ong) and Benjamin Warby’s, and
there were none on the Lachlan below
its junction with the Belabulo. But
from 1830 to 1895, following the good
reports brought back by Sturt and
Mitchell of the country they had seen,
and more liberal terms given by the
Government to settlers, the new lands
become rapidly occupied.
Pastoral Settlement
There is no reliable evidence of any
authorised pastoral occupation of the
Bland country before 1835. A few
itinerant stockman, or absconders
from the settled districts, may have
visited temporarily for pastime, but
they made no permanent habitations,
and had no legal title. Legitimate
occupancy and permanent residence
began in 1836, when, under sanction
of the Squatting Act of Ist October,
1833, passed by Governor Bourke, and
another passed 22nd March, 1839, by
Governor Gipps, entitled an “Act to
restrain the unauthorised occupation
of Crown lands,.’ the “squatters”
status was recognised, and licenses to
hold their lands become issuable out-
side the settled districts (or as they
were called then, “beyond the limits
of location.”) These licenses had
only an annual tenure, at an annual
rent of £lO, and these provisions re-
mained in force until again replaced
by the Squatting Act of Ist May,
1847, which gave the pastoralists fix-
ity of tenure with a maximum term
of 14 years to their leases.
Meantime, between 1835 and 1839,
settlement took place alon g the Lach-
lan, from Eugowra to Booligal (Polle-
gal of Oxley); and Thomas Pye (at
Eugowra), George Danken (at Bugca-
bagil, upon which Forbes is built),
William Lee (at Condoublin, now the
town of Condobolin), Pierce Collitts
and his sons (at Towyel), and Tom
Bros (at “Boolegal”, now “Boram


bil”) established themselves there.
All these men were Bathurst men, and
kept to the frontage. The same pro-
cess went on along the Murrumbidgee
from Wagga to Hay. James Bray
was at “Berry Jerry", Harry Lupton
(Mittagong), James Rudd (Wogango-
biramby), W. Chapman (Burrabogee)
Guise at “Elelewar.” Most of
these men came from near Goulburn,
or South Coast. Back between, on
the Bland, in the list of individuals
“who had obtained licenses from the
Colonial Treasurer for depasturing
stock beyond the limits of location,”
published in the “Government Gaz-
ette” of 1840, page 170, are the
names of Dr. Archer Gibson (“Cara-
bagal,” now Marsden), John Cart-
wright and James Chisholm (“Geegul-
lalong”) and they were licensed from
1835. The names of Caldwell (of
"Moonbucca”) and McGregor (of
Morangarell) are not mentioned as
Croyn lessees in 1836 or 1839, nor up
to 1846. Both were on the Bland, it
is stated, before 1850 (see Royal Aus-
tralian Historical Society Journal, vol.
VI Ilk page 374), but apparently as
lessees, under the 1847 Act, when fix-
ity of tenure came into operation
Me osrs Gibson, Cartwright and Chis-
holm came from the southern dis-
tricts, and appear to have been the
first pioneer settlers on the Bland re-
cognised by the Government.
With the discovery of gold in 1851,
and the demand for stock of all kinds
on the Victoria goldfields, the country
between the Lachlan and Murrumbicl-
gee was soon all taken up and stock-
ed, and remained largely held under
leasehold until the “Free Selection”
Act of Sir John Robertson became
law in 1851, when the opportunity ar-
rived for men of limited capital to
acquire a holding, which many did.
The first stock-owners stocked their
runs with cattle—partly because they
were less difficult to manage. Sheep
required more labour, more attention,
and protection at night from wild
dogs, and shepherding and yarding
day and night. The blacks, also,
killed sheep in preference to cattle.
The writer’s father in 1854-1858 made
three trips overlanding large drafts
of cattle from the Bathurst district
to Bendigo to the gold-fields markets
in Victoria. There were then no fen-
ces on the runs (except small home-
stead paddocks), no regular roads,
and no bridges over the rivers from
Dutbo to Echuca. He and others fol-
lowed the Lachlan to Euabalong, cut
across country to “Lang’s Crossing”
(now Hay) and then via the Edwards,
at Deniliquin, to “Maiden’s Punt”
(now Echuca). They avoided the
Bland owing to the scrubs, and stages
without water, and followed the rivers
as long as possible.
In the “Independent” of the 28th
February last, under “Temora Fifty
Years Ago” mention is made of the
early lessees of “Mimosa” (McCansh
and Windeyer, 1857), “Temora” (S.
K. Salting, 1851), and “Combaning”
(James Comans, 1851). Windeyer
and Macansh afterwards occupied sta-
tions in New England, at “Deepwat-
er,'’ now a town between Glen Innis
and Tenterfield, and at “Canning
Downs,” near Warwick, Queensland.
S. K. Salting, who appears to have
been the first lessee of “Temora” run
—and probably gave it its name—had
pastoral property near Murrumburrah,
and was a member of the wealthy
Sydney mercantile firm of Flower,
Salting and Co. In the official list of
licenses, 1836-1839, quoted above, 1
do not see the name of “John Down-
ey” of “Gundibindyal,” but “Robert
Downey” is given as belonging to the
Murrumbidgee district, and as occupy-
ing “Gilmore Creek” run in 1839.
The Discovery of Gold
1880
According to the official record and
reports of the Department of Mines,
gold appears to have been discovered
as far back as 1869, as it is stated
that Goldspink and party found a
reef while sinking post-holes on Tem-
ora Run, and a trial crushing was put
through at Junee, but proved un-
payable. For a number of years
subsequently Henry White carried on
active operations from time to time,
but no discovery was reported by him.
This man seems to have encouraged
Henry Parker and party, who had
been mining at Scrub Yards, to give
the field a trial, and this party took
up a prospecting protection area on
the deep ground, Temora, on the 17th
of November, 1879. Other persons
were also attracted to the field, and
George Bloomfield and party appear
to have been the first discoverers of
payable gold in shallow ground about
the latter end of January, 1880, but
the area proved of limited extent.
Parker and party, with the object, it
is said, of securing the Government
reward of £lOOO, immediately hoisted
the red flag, and reported the discov-
ery of gold on the 3rd February,
1880. Unfortunately the telegram
from the Warden’s office at Braid-
wood converted the yield of two to
four grains to the dish, into two to
four ounces, and a rush at once fol-
lowed. Intense excitement prevailed,
which was fanned into fury when the
exact facts were disclosed.
Parker narrowly escaped being lyn-
ched and the red flag was taken down
and torn into shreds by the infuriated
miners. This rush quickly subsided,
and those who remained turned their
attention to quartz mining and pros-
pecting. It is recorded that a par-
cel of two tons of quartz crushed from
the Hidden Star Reef in February,
gave a yield of 5 ounces 3 dwt. of
gold.
Warden Charles Deßoos and H.
Margules, Mining Registrar, arrived
on the field from Braidwood on 13th
February, 1880. The former took
charge temporarily, and the latter
took up his duties permanently at
Scrub Yards (Woodstown), whence he
removed his office in July 10 miles
West, where on the 13th May previous
he had selected a site for a town,
known afterwards as “Temora.’
Amongst others who were engaged
prospecting was James Maloney, who
was the original prospector of Scrub
Yards, Woodstown, the precursor of
Temora. He had struck payable gold
there in what was afterwards known
as Pontings Prospecting Shaft, Ex-
hibition lead. Maloney took a pros-
pecting protection area at Temora in
May 1380, and was fortunate in being
able to report the discovery of payable
gold on 30th June, 1880, on what ulti-
mately proved the main line of lead.
Another man named Patrick Murray,
who claimed to have found gold at
Temora as far back as 1878 (but not
in payable quantity) reported discov-
ery a day after Maloney and party,
viz. Ist July, 1880. It was these two
discoveries which set the stream of
miners back to Temora once more.
In the short space of five weeks it
was estimated that there were 20,000
persons located on the field. The
thirst for claims, for allotments, for
an area of any sort, no matter how
small, seemed insatiable, while the
handicaps were added to by the fact
that it was a very severe winter; the
people had to take what they could
get, and pay the famine, prices de-
manded. Water for drinking pur-
poses was scarce and difficult to ob-
tain. Most of the water was sup-
plied from a large dam on Narraburra
Creek, 6 miles distant, at 3/6 a cask,
and the first puddling mills were erec-
ted on private property on a lagoon,
near Temora Station.
In considering the many pioneers of
the field, two other parties have to be
specially mentioned. Alexander Boss
arrived in Temora early in April, 1880,
and obtained payable gold in the deep
ground, while James Moore and party
were the first to find gold in the shal-
low ground immediately below the
reefs at Temora East.
The reward of £IOOO for the dis-
covery of the field was apportioned
after due investigation as to the
merits of the claimants as follows: —
James Maloney and party £400; P.
Murray and party £l5O, A. Ross £l5O,
J. Moore and party £l5O, H. Parker
and party £l5O. Operations in the
alluvial ground proved that the wash-
dirt was somewhat patchy, haying
varied in thickness from a few inches
up to six feet in places, and in width
from 20 feet up to 100 feet and over.
The finding of large nuggets seems
to have stimulated the rush to the
field. From the three celebrated
claims of Keating and Hayes, Nugent
and Adams, and Buckley and party,
1500 ounces were picked out by hand.
The nuggets obtained weighed 99, 76,
68, 50, 46, 28, 24, 16 and 14 ounces,
while numbers weighing half an ounce
and upwards were of common occur-
rence. The gold was mostly coarse
and jagged,- not water worn, and
studded with quartz.
In 1885, increased attention was
given to quartz mining, the principal
claims being the South Australia ill 1

the Mother Shipton and the Home-
ward Bound. Some exceptionally rich
specimens were obtained from the
Mother Shipton claim, three of which
were purchased by the. Government.
The largest specimen was estimated
to contain 258 ounces fine gold; the
second 41i ounces, and the third nine
ounces, all embedded in pure white
quartz. The largest specimen was
exhibited by the Agent-General in a
shop window, in London in 1907, and
was stolen by burglars. The small-
est specimen was presented to Queen
Victoria. Temora in fifty years has
yielded the following amount of gold,
of a value exceeding half a million
pounds.
The Establishment of
the Town
The decrease in population which
took place after Harry Parker’s dis-
covery left the field without a resident
Warden. Warden de Boos visited
periodically. Mr. Henry Margules,
the Mining Registrar, became chiefly
responsible when the big rush follow-
ed Moloney’s and Murray’s discoveries
of the 30th June and Ist July, 1880,
as being the only mining official on
the spot. After selecting a site for
the town in May, instructions were is-
sued to Mr. Surveyor V. F. Tozer,
then Mining Surveyor, on 10th June
of that year, and four streets were
at once marked off. Mr. Surveyor
Schleicher then undertook to lay out
the town, and he marked off six sec-
tions, but as these were found inade-
quate, six additional sections were
marked. Still the demand for areas
continued, so the town extended and
settlements were formed at Upper
and Lower Temora. The Mining Reg-
istrar reported that the houses ex-
tended in one continuous chain along
one street for a length of three miles.
This street he named Hoskins-street,
after the then Minister for Lands.
The Mining Registrar expressed re-
gret that the district had not been
proclaimed a goldfield as advocated
by Mr. Patrick Murray some years
before, as the settlement at Lower
Temora was upon Deutscher’s free
selection and much heart-burning and
irritation had been caused by the
conditions imposed by the landowners
on the miners, it being estimated that
Deutscher drew £6O a week in rents
and tributes.
The district was proclaimed a gold-
field on 4th June, 1880, and the town
boundaries were proclaimed under the
Towns’ Police Act, 24th -September,
1880. Consequent upon the great in-
flux of population, and the application
for claims and business sites, togeth-
er with the necessity of administering
the law, the Government directed the
Police Magistrate at Forbes (Mr. Ern-
est A. L. Sharpe) to take charge of
the field. He arrived on the 10th of
August, and states he “found all con-
fusion that must attend a new and ex-
tensive rush. Business places were
only in course of erection, and the
only building available as a Court
House for hearing mining cases (and
afterwards police court cases) was a
small iron building capable of holding
perhaps 40 people, and utterly unsuit-
able, or even sufficient for a public of-
fice.” This served as a Court House
until November following, when the
Government erected new premises.
Mr. Sharpe established a Police and
Small Debts Court on the 20th Octob-
er, 1880. In August, 1880, when he
assumed control, he estimated the
population at 6000 but later in the
year he believed it had reached 12,000,
with 60 hotels. After doing duty for
some months Mr. Sharpe returned to
Forbes, and Mr. Charles de Boos, then
a Warden for the Southern Goldfields,
was appointed resident Warden. He
was succeeded in 1882 by Mr. Warden
Janies Baker, who was transferred
from the Copeland Field.
The first Clerk of Petty Sessions
was Mr. Reginald Zouch, who was ap-
pointed under Mr. Sharpe, and he re-
mained until 1887. Mr. James Davor-
en was Warden’s Bailiff and Sheriff’s
Officer.
The Bank of New South Wales and
Australian Joint Stock Bank opened
in July, 1880. The Bank of N.S.W.
opened first. _ The first manager was
Mr. J, O. Aitcheson, who was suc-
ceeded in 1882 by Mr. Charles Law-
rence Kendall. Mr. J. A. P. Selkirk
was the first manager of the A.J.S.
Bank, and he was succeeded about
1882 by Mr. B. B. Eodd, who came
from Grenfell. Sub-Inspector Patrick
Lyons was, I believe, the first officer
in charge of police, under Captain
Zouch, of Goulburn, but in my time
(1883) Sub-Inspector W. C. Lynch
was in charge, with Sergeant Oliver,
two foot constables, a lock-up keeper,
and two mounted troopers. The
mounted police were quartered in
wooden barracks, with wooden stables
at the rear, built on the Police Re-
serve, on a slope about 200 yards from
tbe present railway station, and
fronting Schleicher-street. A fenced-
in paddock for horses, about 25 acres,
enclosed the quarters.
US' -M
The headmaster of the Public
School was Mr. Swann, and he had
Mr. Bourke as assistant. Mr. A. H.
Wetherall was postmaster and Mr. J.
M. Foley assistant. Dr. Crawford was
Government Medical Officer. Mes-
srs. F. de Boos and S. Kearney were
the practising solicitors. The Rev.
Maurice Gray (and afterwards, the
Rev. Campbell Drummond Represent-
ed the clergy of the Church of Eng-
land; the Rev. Fr. Fallon was the
Roman Catholic priest, and the Rev.
Alexander Riddel, the Presbyterian
clergyman. The Church of England
was a small cypress-pine building
fronting Deßoos-street, next to the
lock-up, on allotment 19 of section 2.
The Roman Catholic Church was of
similar material, on the opposite site,
on allotment 10, section 7, and the
Presbytery, a small wooden cottage
where Father Fallon lived, was on the
next allotment (9). Both fronted De-
Boos-street.
On the corner of Deßoos and Loft-
ns-streets, Edward Becker, a German
engineer, had a large wooden hotel,
with some 10 or 12 rooms, well-kept
and appointed, known as the “Court.
House Hotel.” When I arrived at
Temora in February, 1883, I found
Warden Baker, Mrs. Baker, Mr. Ken-
dall, and Mr. Orbell staying there—
the two latter for meals only. I join-
ed them, and remained for six months,
when we removed to the “Royal Ex-
change,” kept by Mr. Joseph Deitz.


Temora Street Names
When Sir Thomas Mitchell was Sur-
veyor-General (1828-1855) he retain-
ed the right to name all streets him-
self, and submit them for the Gov-
ernor’s approval, except when, as in
the case of Melbourne, the Governor
took the honour upon himself. But
in later years this procedure became
obsolete, and it now generally rests
with the Surveyor making the survey
to suggest, or recommend, the names
proposed, to the Surveyor-General,
who sends them on to the Minister
and Executive Council for approval.
There is no doubt this was done by
Mr. Surveyor Schleicher, who laid out
the first twelve sections. The names
given are in honor of those holding
the highest positions in the State, in
most instances; some after the first
officials connected with the field, and
four after the four cardinal points
or symbolical of them.
Thus we find Victoria-street .named
after Her Majesty Queen Victoria;
Loftus-street after Lord Augustus
Loftus, Governor of New South Wal-
es, 1879-1885; Parkes-street after Sir
Henry Parkes, Premier and Colonial
Secretary, whose Government (1878-
1883), was in office when the discovery
of gold at Temora occurred; Hoskins-
street after the Hon. James Hoskins,
Minister for Lands, and Baker-street
after the Hon. Ezekiel Alexander Bak-
er, Minister for Mines, both members
of the Parkes Government when the
town was named. Twynam and Sch-
leicher streets were named after the
two Government Surveyors who had
most to do with its first survey, Mr.
George Twynam, then District Sur-
veyor at Goulburn, under whom both
Surveyors Tozer and Schleicher were
immediately serving, and Mr. Sch-
leicher himself, who laid it out.
Camp-street was probably named from
its proximity, at that time, to the
temporary police camp, subsequently
turned into barracks and police pad-
dock. Sharpe-street was named after
Mr. Ernest Augustine Lambie Sharpe,
M.A., barrister-at-law, Police Magis-
trate at Forbes, and Acting-Warden in
charge of the field from August, 1880,
to the end of that year. Deßoos-
street was named after Mr. Charles
de Boos, the pioneer Warden in charge
of the field, when the first rush took
place, and afterwards the first resi-
dent Warden and Police Magistrate.
Britannia-street conveys its own sig-
nificance. Then come four boundary
streets of the town as originally de-
signed, to which the pioneer surveyor
was apparently averse to attach such
homely nomenclature as North, South,
East and West streets, and gave them
instead their classical allusions, viz.:
Polaris-street, the most northerly (the
Pole); Aurora-street, the most easter-
ly (the morning star); Austral-street,
the most southerly (the southern star)
and Vesper-street, the most westerly
(the evening star.)
The Large Pastoral
Holdings of 1883-85
When I came to Temora in 1883 the
surrounding country was held in large
areas as sheep stations. Cattle were
very few. It was not until the Par-
nell Land Act of 1884 became law that
closer settlement in the district com-
menced. During my residence the
following properties, with their own-
ers or managers, were carried on:—
Temora Station (the nearest to the
town) belonged to Mack and Greav-
es, and Mr. J. W. Bourke managed it.
The homestead was built of hardwood
and pine, with a shingled roof. It
was very cool in summer and had a
good water supply from the creek in
front, which had been dammed. I for-
get who held Narraburra, but Mr. J.
J. Keane lived there and managed it.
James Robertson held Mimosa, and
his brother, Lachlan, was at Barmed-
man. Alexander Davidson owned and
lived at West Mandamah. Hastings
Cunningham, I believe, had Kildary.
Patrick Heffernan held and lived at
Clear Hills. I am not sure if the
Comans’ family held Combaning, but
it was managed by a Mr. Foster. At
Gundibindyal North, G. V. Seaborn
was manager in early 1883, but left
to manage “Gummingbland” (Parkes
district) where he is still living as a
prominent citizen; he was succeeded
by Edward Burmeister. At Gundi-
bindyal, Henry Smith, afterwards an
auctioneer in Temora, was manager.
Davidson Bros, held “Geraldra.”
Welman Bros. were at Ariah
Park. I remember old Mr.
McGregor, a fine typo of the
pure Highlander, was at Morangarell,
and came to town frequently on busi-
ness. I often met him and listened
to his early experiences on the Bland,
when I boarded at Becker’s Court
House Hotel, which he patronised.
Also Mr. Steel Caldwell (of Moon-
bucca) visited the town periodically,
and stayed at Deitz’s Royal Exchange.
Most of these station owners passed
through Temora to Cootamundra to
transact their land business there, as
there was no Lands Office at that time
instituted at Temora or, occasionally,
they came to attend the court. G.
W. Seaborn, E. Burmeister, Henry
Smith, Alexander Davidson, Patrick
Heffernan, and M. J. Woods (of Tem-
ora) were the Justices of the Peace
as I recollect them. Before the sel-
ectors under the 1884 Act came in
there was not much ring-barking done,
except around the homesteads. The
country was covered with timber—cy-
press-pine, gray gum, myall, yarran
and wattle, and other mimosa under-
growth. There were beautiful cy-
press-pine belts right through to
Coolamon on one side and Barmcdman
on the other, which I think it was a
mistake to destroy in the interests of
agriculture, for not only has it be-
come very valuable, but stock require
shade and shelter, and it retains a
certain amount of moisture in the
soil
The Coming of the
Wheatgrowers
The only farms I recollect being
occupied near Temora in 1883 were
those of John Trefle, senr., John
Schiuhm, McCrone Bros., at Deep
Creek, R. May, A. Deutscher and an-
other small farm was cultivated on
the Mirrool-road beyond the hospital.
These landowners had selected und-
er the old ’6l Act, before the rush,
and I do not remember seeing any
paddock of more than 30 acres under
crop within 10 miles of Temora. They
mostly had horse teams, and were en-
gaged carrying produce to the out-
stations, with wool for return load-
ing. They grew forage, but very lit-
tle grain.
In the middle of the year 1885, the
mining industry began to decay. The
gold won in that year fell to half the
output of the two previous years.
Numbers of miners left for Broken
Hill, Croydon (Queensland), and
Sunny Corner, and some people be-
gan to say that the “bottom had
fallen out of Temora” and that when
the gold run out it would become an
abandoned “diggings” like Sofala,
Gulgong and Grenfell.
In this connection it is interesting
to recall the opinion of Mr. Warden
Baker in his official report of 1885.
He wrote, “For many years gold-
mining will be a factor in the pros-
perity of this district, but other in-
dustries will grow quite sufficient to
support Temora as a central inland
town, even if gold mining were to en-
tirely cease, which is not likely for
many years to come.”
Mr. Kendall, my senior in the
Bank of New South Wales, thought
differently. I remember him saying
to me when leaving to manage the
Adelong branch towards the end of
’B4; “You can be prepared to leave in
six months. Now the gold is done
there is nothing to keep the bank go-
ing any longer.” However, I did
not share his opinion. The ’B4 men
had just comrpenced to arrive and
were taking up land all round the
town. They came from all quarters
—Victoria, the Murray Valley, the
Southern District, and the West.
Some had ample capital, some were
of limited means. Some came over-
land with their families in covered
wagons, some were younger sons of
Victorian families, but I doubt if
any finer race of men ever settled in
any district. They lost no time in
putting up some sort of a house, exca-
vating some sort of a dam (for most
of them had to depend on surface
water). Bullock teams or horses
were to be seen on every newly-ac-
quired block, rooting out the stumps;
“forest devils” pulling down the
smaller forest trees, and fences being
erected to get in the first crop.
The “old hands”, brought up among-
st stock, said, “Grow wheat on the
Bland ! They are mad ! Wait till
they get a dry season. They will be
glad to sell out and clear out.”


But these men were not of a type to
be easily discouraged; they were
young, most of them, strong and
healthy, not afraid of work, and knew
"how to do things.” They brought
new methods of cultivation with them,
new labour-saving farm implements,
and were full of hope and activity.
And they had an excellent soil to till,
as results have since proved. Their
coming revived Temora, and laid the
prosperity which exists to-day.
When I lived in Temora 1 had hor-
ses to ride. At first, my friend
Bourke, of Temora Station, lent me
one, so that I could spend week-ends
with him at the station sometimes.
He was a good-natured fellow, a
bachelor (like most of us in the
town) and being lonely out there,
liked company. So we used to go out
now and again. Later on 1 had a
horse of my own, and ran it in the
police paddock with the Supeirntend-
cnt’s permission. We had a small
bark stable at the back of the bank,
and I had a small plot of lucerne
there too, from which 1 got several
cuts.
1 was born on the land, and when
•ight years of age my father put me
in the saddle, in which I have lived
most of my life, for if circumstances
made me a bank clerk for a time na-
ture made me a lover of the land all
the time. So after hours I used to
saddle up and with a mate visit the
new farms that were being cleared.
That is how I came to know all about
the obstacles the first settlers had to
face, and that is why I am pleased
to see so much prosperity and pro-
gress amongst them and their descen-
dants. I hope they will hold out and
remain on their properties, and not be
influenced by the artificial life of the
citirs. Family and home life is at
its best in the country, and agricul-
ture is the sure, firm, and lasting
foundation of national greatness.
“Those,” says the old book, “who till
the soil, shall own the soil.” Our
first parents were placed in a garden,
not in a shop.
Town Conditions in
1883-1885
In my time I do not think there
was a brick house in Temora, except,
perhaps, one, an hotel (the Westmin-
ster) kept by Edwin Gardner, on Lot
2, Section 4. All the hotels w’ere
wooden, cypress-pine predominating.
The Bank of N.S.W. was a wooden
structure, about 20 feet x 20 feet. It
was, I understand, made in Sydney,
and sent up in parts and put together
locally. It had a small front room,
with a counter across, for transacting
banking business, and an adjoining
room was used as the manager’s of-
fice and" gold-buying room. Each of
these was about 10 x 10 feet. Two
aimilar-sized rooms were behind the
above, one used by the manager as
a bedroom, and another used for the
same purpose by myself. They were
curtained off from the office. Behind
the bank was a small wooden, iron-
roofed house, and near it an 800-gal-
lon galvanised iron tank, which kept
us in bathing water in the winter and
spring, but in a dry summer or au-
tumn, as did happen, we had to betake
ourselves to the “Ironbarks” (Govern-
ment) Dam, or Temora Creek for a
“refresher.”
The Joint Stock Bank was a few
doors down from the Queensland Ho-
tel, kept by Mrs. Boxall. Between the
Queensland Hotel and the Joint
Stock Bank were three small wooden
shops kept respectively by Wm. Ley
(saddler), H. Thomas (tailor), and J.
McCulloch (stationer). Below the
Joint Stock Bank (towards Lower
Temora, were three hotels, one kept
by James Curtain, another, adjoining
by Michael Byron, and a large one, at
the corner, with the Victoria Theatre
attached, kept by Harry Gordon Ward.
On the opposite corner, Polaris and
Hoskins street, on Lot 10, Section 5,
was another large hotel kept by W.
H. Sawbridge.
From Sawbridge’s corner to the bank
of New South Wales every allotment
was built upon, the occupants hold-
ing under Miner’s Eight, or Business
License. A. Collis had a plumbing
business, Mrs. Doering a fruit shop,
then came Mrs. Seymour’s hotel, and
adjoining the bank block, Barnes Bros
had a produce store, and the Young
mailman kept his horse and sulky
there. On the opposite corner (south
and south-east) to the bank Joseph
Deitz, and Martin Haydon had spac-
ious hotels. Haydon’s Hotel had a
large assembly hall attached to it, in
which John E. Redmond received a
great reception from the local Irish-
men, when he addressed them on Irish
affairs in 1884. We, also, had a very
flourishing Literary and Debating
Society in the town, with a large
membership, and held our meetings at
intervals in this hall. Warden Baker,
C. L. Kendall, Charles de Boos, junr.,
J. Wehr (of the old “Independent”),
Swann, Revd. Ridde;, and many oth-
ers were members, and we had very
enjoyable gatherings.
Lot 1, Section 1, is shewn on the
town map in the name of C. L. Ken-
dall, on which the Royal Exchange
was built. The reason for that is
that at the time permission was
granted to purchase, Mr. Deitz was
indebted to the bank for a consider-
able amount, and the deed was issued
in the manager’s name to protect our
securities. Next to the Royal Ex-
change, Harry Woods had a large em-
porium, and next to him was Curry’s
Hotel, further on was Hunter’s boot
shop, and a couple of doors further
on Dr. Crawford had a dispensary,
and lived in the premises. He and J.
J. Orbell (thrown out of a sulky on
the Junee-road and killed) had served
in the Maori War in New Zealand.
Further on was Nunan’s Hotel, and
next to it Parker’s butcher’s shop,
and next to it, John Meagher ami
Co’s, premises—built of wood like all
the rest.
On the comer Mr. Frank Hickey
had a newspaper agency, and tobac-
conist and stationery business. At
the entrance to the shop he had firm-
ly fixed upon a strong wooden post,
some 12 or 15 inches in diameter, a
life-sized wooden bust of a negro,
measuring fully four feet in height,
and painted, of course, as black as
the ace of spades. I think it had
something to do with an advertise-
ment for “Negrohead” tobacco, much
in (iemand then, and probably Mr.
Hickey sold a lot. On the same side
of the street, but over the road Mes-
srs Dillon Bros., had a large drapery
business, and Man Sing had a varie-
gated signboard hung above his door.
From there to the upper town the
street straggled until the Bristol Ho-
tel, kept by Henry Ponting (‘(Bristol
Harry”) and Ceiling’s produce store
were reached.
From Haydons’ Hotel, on the east-
ern side of Hoskins-street and going
south, there was a small cramped
wooden building, with an iron roof,
which served as a post office, and an-
other small wooden tenement where
the Mining Registrar had his office.
Mr. H. Margules left Temora while I
was there, and I fancy Mr. Thomas
Love succeeded him as Mining Reg-
istrar. Further up the street was
another wooden hotel, kept by some
one I cannot remember, and close to
it the “Temora Independent” premis-
es, where, I understand, the present
“Independent” is still entrenched. I
believe it was founded by James
Meehan, but he had gone when I
came to Temora. Its editor in 1883
was Mr. Johannes T. Wehr (or Weir),
a gentleman of Polish origin, an edu-
cated and able man. He resided on
the premises and boarded at the
Queensland Hotel (Mrs. Boxall’s).
Report, in my time, credited Mr. S.
Hawkins, of Wagga, with an interest
in it. There were two chemist’s
shops in this locality kept respectively
by Edward Purchose and H. Pinchin.
The “Temora Herald” (whose pro-
prietor, W. H. L. Bailey, was unpopu-
lar with the miners, and tactless)
ceased publication just before I left
Temora in 1885, and I understand it
was followed in the following year
by its contemporary. No great inter-
val appears to have occurred, how-
ever before the late Hon. J. L.
Trefie re-organised and re-started th*
present “Independent” in 1887. I
look upon the “Independent,” there-
fore, as the lineal descendant of
James Meehan’s pioneer paper, the
one which has lived longest, and with
which I have been most closely as-
sociated as a reader for 47 years.
On Section 17, and upon, or near Al-
lotment 11, close to the police pad-
dock corner, Johnny Pringle had a
puddling machine, and a small dam,
which he worked with one horse, go-
ing round in a circle. The South
Australian Gold Mining Battery, in
charge of Captain Thomas Eyre was
between O’Shanaussy’s dam, and the
Barmedman-road. I think the race
course was in Deutscher’s paddock, on


a good flat. There was a very good
Race Club, Reginald Zouch, a pretty
amateur rider in his day, and a good
sportsman was president, and R.
Parker, and Tom Park, the boxer and
bookmaker, were enthusiastic memb-
ers. There was also a well maintain-
ed Gun Club, and we used to hold our
pigeon matches in Temora Park, then
merely an open, unfenced piece of
ground. Just before my departure it
was fenced in, and we had an Arbor
Day and a working-bee. With others
I planted a tree there.
There was a general custom (which
I have found to prevail on all gold-
fields) amongst the Temora miners, a
picturesque and interesting one. Every
Saturday evening after sundown, when
work ceased, and they were dressed
in their best clothes, they all congre-
gated in Hoskins-street, parading up
and down until 11 or 12 o’clock, if it
were moonlight; exchanging greet-
ings with each other, laughing and
joking, shouting a friendly glass with
their friends, and discussing politics,
mining laws, or the prospects of the
next washing-up from the latest
“golden hole.” I never recollect see-
ing any repulsive conduct or violence
in the streets on these occasions. The
mining population was very law-abid-
ing, and well behaved. Many were
travelled men, and many well educa-
ted. Nor was there any great love
for drink amongst them. Some were
hard drinkers, but they took their
cups quietly and drank decently. The
hotels were plentiful enough and kept
open them till midnight.
Very good theatrical troupes perio-
dically came to the town, and I have
seen some big audiences in Ward’s
Victoria Theatre. It was there that
Miss Kate Slattery, a talented voca-
list, sang Irish melodies of Tom
Moore’s, and the Irish miners were
so charmed with her that they show-
ered nuggets on to the stage. That
wgas before I arrived, but I had it
on good authority.
Gold Buying
The bulk of the business done by
th? banks (and the most profitable)
was gold-buying. Temora gold
brought top price at the Mint, viz.,
£4/1/6 an ounce. We advanced with-
out any risk, £3/10/ per ounce, and
bought at £3/17/6, making a profit of
4/ an ounce, but escort and assaying
charges had to be deducted from that.
Gold-buying, as we carried it on, was
quite a science. The banks found all
the apparatus for cleaning the gold
thoroughly. The most finely adjusted .
weighing scales were provided, a
pestle for breaking, and an iron
morlar for pounding gold containing
rock or quartz was used; the smaller
nuggets and grains were sifted
through numerous finely meshed siev-
es, and then the strongest magnets
were applied to clean the minute re-
sidue. It was necessary to use one’s
lungs m dealing with large parcels
too as much “blowing” had to bo
done.
The arrangement followed between
the banks and the miners was for the
heed of the party concerned to nctif-’
the bank that they would be having a
“cleaning up” during such and such
a week. Thereupon it would bo ar-
ranged that after each day's clean-ur>,
the leader would bring the result
the bank, and it would be placed in a
small (or large) chamois leather bag
(which the bank supplied) to which
a cord was attached round the bag’s
neck. It would be then tied, and
sealed with sealing wax, with the
bank’s seal: bag and contents weighed
and a receipt given for the weight;
the bag being then placed in the
bank safe for safe-keeping. If the
“clean-up” lasted a week or more,
there would be several bags. When
the work was finally finished all the
parties came to the bank, all the bags
were counted and weights checked
with the receipts, and the cleaning of
the gold began. The cleaning might
last a cuople of .days or more. One
parcel I cleaned of nearly 1000 ounces
took me nearly a week. After this
proceeding the financial part of the
transaction was entered upon. Each
man’s share had to be ascertained,
working expenses divided, fixed depos-
its arranged, and some would open
current acocunts, while other drew
cash by cheque. When we had large
amounts of gold like this on the
premises awaiting escort we each
slept with loaded Colt revolvers be-
side us, and one of the police was al-
ways on a beat at Boxall’s corner
during the night, where he could see
both banking premises. The town
was badly lighted then, but the hotel
lamps at Deitz’s, Haydon’s and Box-
all’s, on the onposite corner, and the
bank, burnt all night, and gave a
certain amount of light to that
centre.
As a rule a miner remained in the
room when the cleaning was done,
with the bank official. Their mates
passed the time taking a little liquid
refreshment at the nearest hotels.
They often used to nress me to “have
a nip” while I was blowing their gold
like a blacksmith’s bellows, but when
I used to say to them. “No. wait until
I knock off. I will only make mistak-
es for which you will not thank me.”
they were quite satisfied. They were
fine fellows to deal with, onen-handed.
and nothing netty about them. When
I would roach the last stage of the
cleaning, when nothing was left but
sand, ironstone, small quartz and dirt,
they would often say, “You’ve gone
far enough; there’s nothing in that.
Throw it away.”
A Mysterious Incident
During my gold-buying experience
at Temora, an extraordinary incident
happened. A company at Barmedma”
had many tons of stone “at grass.”
and was preparing for the first crush-
ing. Prospects were reported to be
excellent, and from trial crushings a
phenomenal return was expected. Mr.
Kendall, who personally knew the
leading men, was eager to get the
purchasing of the large parcel, and
left no stone unturned to influence
them. They agreed to sell to us.
They had their own battery and re-
tort on the spot. Eventually they
crushed and, according to reports, had
an exceptionally good result.
One day they arrived bringing the
cake of gold with them. It was ex-
actly the shape of an orange, almost
globular in form. Mr. Kendall weigh-
ed it (I think it went 270 ounces) and
arrangements were made for an ad-
vance. Some payments were made in
advance. Mr. Kendall was so keen to
purchase that he did not exercise his
usual caution, and did not complete
the examination thoroughly.
I happened to be at lunch, at
Deitz’s, when the party arrived, and
they had left when I returned. I saw
the cake—a solid golden mass it ap-
peared—nearly a foot in height and
diameter. At the top was a brown
rusty crust, extending a third of the
cone. But what instantly struck me
was that it’s weight did not seem to
correspond with it’s size.
“What do you think of it?” my
manager asked me.
“I think,” I said, “from the size of
it, it ought to weigh double as much
as you say it does, if it is solid.”
“Whv.” he said, “do you think it is
hollow?”
“I don’t know,” I answered, “but it
seems to me too big for it’s weight.”
I could not get the idea out of my
head.
Mr. Kendall was greatly upset. "Go
over to Eyre” (the manager of the
South Australian G.M. Coy., who re-
sided at Deitz’s) and tell him I want
to see him at once,’ ’he said to me.
I did, and Captain Eyre accompanied
me back in a few minutes. He was
shown the gold, and noted the rusty
top.
Mr. Kendall said, “Steel thinks it
ought to weigh more than it does; he
has an idea that it might be hollow.”
“That’s easily proved. Give me
your pestle,” ’ said Eyre, and placing
the cake in the mortar, grave it a
heavy blow in the top, where the
dirty crust was. The pestle went
right in; the top half of the globe was
a mere shell, and crumbled.
We immediately suspected “doctor-
ing.” That evening a telegram was
sent to Barmedman to ask the direc-
tor to come to Temora. The same ev-
ening we held a council of war in the
manager’s room, when Captain Eyre
fan old Bendigo man). Reginald
Zouch (an old Gympie gold-buyer). B.
B. Rodd (manager of the A.J.S.)
were consulted. They decided that, as
the escort did not leave for some
weeks, and the matter could not be
delayed, I should leave, by next morn-
ing’s coach, for Cootamundra and Syd-
ney. and take the gold with me to the
Bank of New South Wales, who then
treated purchased gold in an assay-
ing plant and department of their
own.


Next morning I left by the mail
coach, with fortunately only one lady
passenger. I had the gold packed in
a large sized portmanteau, stuffed
with an old blanket and rug cloth
around it to prevent it rolling about.
My orders were “not to let it out of
my sight until I delivered it at head
office.” I carried a sandwich to avoid
leaving the coach at the half-way
house at Combaning, where we chang-
ed horses and had lunch, and I also
carried a loaded revolver under an
overcoat, which I had to keep on to
prevent it being seen. When I
reached Cootamundra, I lumbered my
charge to the Bank of New South
Wales and delivered a letter to Mr.
Eager, the manager, telling him my
errand. He locked it in the strong
room, while I had tea at an hotel kept
by Mrs. Angove. That finished, I
went back to the bank.
Mr. Eager accompanied me to the
station and obtained my ticket, while
I kept hold of the blessed portmant-
eau. Fortunately, I was at ease in
finding in the same carriage with me
Mr. Murray, road superintendent at
Gundagai, who often visited Temora,
and to whom I was known.
Daylight was just breaking when I
hailed a cab at the old Eedfern Sta-
tion, and the sun was up when I
reached the door of the head office, in
George-street. But the door was shut,
I got tired of standing in the porch,
and sat down on the portmanteau.
Presently, old Fitz, the head-messen-
ger, opened the door and let me in.
He also brought me a cup of coffee
and a biscuit. A few minutes after-
wards, Mr. Wilkinson, the manager,
came in. I handed over the gold to
him and got a receipt. I also banded
him a letter from Mr. Kendall ex-
plaining the affair. At 9 o’clock I
saw the Chief Inspector, who desired
me to await the result of the assay,
and call the following morning. This
I did, receiving a letter giving the
returns .'of gold extracted, value, etc.
But, as it afterwards turned out, too
much haste was made in the assaying,
involving a serious error.
That evening I caught the Southern
Mail, reached Cootamundra for break-
fast, and was back in Temora by 4
p.m. When I arrived I found the
directors of tthe mine in conference
with Mr. Kendall. The assay returns
disclosed 70 ounces (if I remember
rightly) excess of spurious substance
in the cake, which reduced the value
of the gold to less than the amount of
the advance.
The directors, all of them reputable
men, could give no clue to the mys-
tery. One thought the retort must
have been foul; another had a differ-
ent theory. One of th°r.- 1 v.vcyer,
was not satisfied with the bank assay.
He instructed us to wire to the bank
to retain the useless residue, and be
would visit Sydney himself next day
and claim it. We did so, and he left
immediately. He returned in the
course of a week, bringing returns of
treatment by the Mint of the valueless
excess substance, from which the mint
had extracted a considerable quantity
of gold, which reduced the amount
further. It was thought the error in
the bank’s assay was caused by the
haste in dealing with it in one day.
However that may be, it had a bad
effect on our gold-buying operations
at the time.
Sport and Recreation
The greater part of the population
in my time were bachelors. All the
officials, bankers, most of the business
men ind the majority of the miners
were single men, or had families else-
where. We had, therefore, to break
the monotony and isolation by follow-
ing some sport or “hobby.” Per-
sonally, I spent a very happy time in
Temora. I was young, strong, heal-
thy, and active, and was fond of rid-
ing, shooting, and cricket, in all of
which I found plenty of occupation.
Thero was plenty of game around Te-
mora. Black and wood duck were
numerous on the creeks and dams;
hundreds of bronze-wing pigeons liv-
ed in the pine scrubs, and amongst the
wattle and yarran groves, and came
in to the dams at sunset in droves to
drink. I remember one evening, with
Mr. Reginald Zouch, on two dams on
Temora Station, we bagged 21 bronze
wing pigeons, as fast as we could load
our guns. Mrs. Deitz had pigeon pie
and curry until we were tired of it.
Cuckatoos and green leeks were also
very plentiful. So were kangaroos.
We had a good cricket club. W.
H. Taubman was our captain. “Toby”
Butler, Charley Deitz, R. Bourke, F.
Whipple, and many others belonged
to it. We practised on an allotment
near the railway station, which I pur-
chased afterwards. On one Anniver-
sary Day w T e went to Barmedman for
a match—a terribly hot day. The
distance is about. 22 miles. Most of
us rode. We had a good game and a
good dinner, but feed for our horses
was very poor at the hotel there, and
the horses suffered. short rations.
Forty odd miles on a very hot day.
with not much to oat, affected some of
them. My horse was all right, but
Tubman had a poor mount. Wc rode
together, going and returning. On
leaving Barmedman, I put two bottles
of lemonade in my saddle-pouch, and
Tubman obtained a small flask of
brandy. There were hardly any hous-
es the whole way then along the road,
and no water as far as I can remem-
ber. When we reached within six
miles of Temora, Tubman’s horse
shewed signs of knocking up, and
soon would not go out of a walk. It
was getting late and would soon be
dark. We got off and walked some
distance and we both had a drink from
my bottle of lemonade, with a dash of
brandy in it. I was going to open the
other bottle, but savs he, “Hold hard,
don’t drink it all, I’ll try the jockey’s
trick with him.” Without further ado
he stood on a log, opened the horse’s
mouth, poured three parts of the lem-
onade into it, and filled the bottle up
again by emptying the almost full
flask of brandy into it, then poured
the whole contents down its throat.
After a ten minutes’ smoke, we
mounted again, and the horse, posses-
sing “Dutch courage” went well until
we got within a couple of miles of
the town, when it become dark and we
both had to walk. After negotiating
the stumps and diggers ’holes between
the South Australian Company’s bat-
tery and the Lower Town we reached
home. Mr. Tubman was a good towns
man, a genial companion and always
an optimist.
Tom Park—Boxer and
Honest Bookmaker
Tom Park was an early identity of
Temora. _ He was a noted boxer, and
gave exhibitions of his art in the local
halls. He was also a well known
bookmaker, and speculated somewhat
in local mines. He was a well made
muscular man, with an attractive per-
sonality. He had a small account
with us in the Bank of New South
Wales, but beyond that we knew little
of him. When I took up my duties as
accountant, I had come direct from
head office, and had had little exper-
ience in handling cash as a bank tell-
er. I had to pick it up as I went
along. One day, not long after I was
initiated in my work, I found on
checking my cash, at the close of
business, I was £4 short in it. It had
been a slack day, and I had not
cashed any large amounts. I check-
ed and re-checked, but could not find
the error, so I asked Mr. Kendall to
go through the day’s work with me,
which he did. After again going
through the accounts he said, “You
have made a mistake somewhere in
giving a customer a £5 note for a £1
note. To whom did you give any £5
notes to-day.” It was a custom for
us to mark on the back of the cheques,
or drafts cashed, the denomination of
the notes paid out. We examined the
cheques cashed, and the only one to
whom I had paid a £5 note that day
was Tom Park.
“If he doesn’t refund it, you will
have to stand the loss,” said my sen-
ior. “But I would advise you to see
him, and tell him the facts, and say
there is not the least doubt you over-
paid him,” he continued. Next morn-
ing, before the bank opened, I saw
Mr. Park standing in the street im-
mediately in front of our office. I
went up to him, somewhat abashed,
and told my tale. He was smoking a
big cigar—he always smoked big
cigars—and he looked me all over
with scorn and all he said was, “Look
here, young ’un, if you are such an in-
fernal fool as to make mistakes like
that you must put up with the loss.
As far as I know you didn’t give me
a fiver.” “All right (1 said) I sup-
pose I must stand the loss,” and walk-
ed away disgusted.
I reported my non-success to my
manager, who had no great admira-
tion for boxers or bookmakers. After
lunch, into the bank walked Mr. Tom


Park, smoking another big cigar. He
looked at me, and plumped down on
the counter in front of me a £5 note.
“There,” says he, “is your £5 note
You did_ give it to me, and I have
been taking a rise out of you for y our
own good. You are a young man on
a gold field. Be more careful, Mr.
Steel.”
It was a good lesson, and did make
me more careful. I never made a
mistake afterwards. And when I
think of my Temora days, I keep a
corner of my memory green for hon-
est Tom Park.
Henry Margules
Henry Margules, the pioneer Mining
registrar, who was responsible for
selecting the site of the town of Te-
mora, was of foreign birth —a Ger-
man, I believe. He was a small man,
with a well-built figure, active, and
quick in movement, with sharp aqui-
line features, a full head of dark curly
hair. He was well educated and
spoke with a foreign accent. He had
spent some years of his life as a
practical miner, and was an authority
on Mining Law and Regulations. He
left the district about 1884.
Charles de Boos
THE, FIRST WARDEN
Charles de Boos was born in London
on the 24th May, 1819—on the same
day as Queen Victoria. He was credi-
ted with belonging to an ancient
French family. He was educated for
the military profession at Addiscombe
College, and served in the British-
Legion in the Carlist War, in Spain;
1835-1836-1837, in the operations-
against the Pretender, Don Carlos.
He arrived in Australia in 1839 and
was Government shorthand writer in
Victoria from 1851 to 1856, when he.
removed to New South Wales, where,
he engaged in literary and journalis-
tic work. • He was a voluminous-
author, and writer on the “Monitor,”
the “Sydney Gazette,” “Herald,” and
“Melbourne Argus.” He is best,
known as the author of “John Smith,
of Congewoi,” “Collective Wisdom of
N.S. Wales,” being parliamentary
sketches for the “Sydney Morning
Herald,” and “Fifty Years Ago,” an-
other novel. In December, 1874, he
was appointed a Warden of the N.S.
Wales goldfields, stationed at Braid-
wood —where he was when ordered to
Temora in February, 1880. He af-
terwards served in similar capacity at
Gulgong and Copeland. (From “Men
of the Time.")
Ernest Augustine
Lambie Sharpe
ACTING WARDEN AND P.M.
Bom at Bathurst, N.S.W., son of
the Revd. Thomas Sharpe, M.A., chap-
lain at Norfolk Island, 1838-1841.
Educated at private schools and the
University of Sydney, where he grad-
uated M.A., and was admitted to the
Bar. Appointed a Magistrate 1876,
and Warden of the Mudgee Goldfield,
at Hill End and Sofola, where he re-
mained until 1880. On the mysterious
disappearance of Mr. F. Dalton, Pol-
ice Magistrate at Forbes, he succeed-
ed him there. From August, 1880, to
the end of the year, he was temporar-
ily in charge of Temora, as acting-
Warden and Police Magistrate. He
remained at Forbes for over 20 years,
when he was promoted Stipendiary
Magistrate at Parramatta, where he
died.
The Pioneer Surveyors
Tozer, Twynam and
Schleicher
Mr. George Twynam was an Eng-
lishman, who came to this country as
a young man. He was educated (so
he once informed me) partly at Frei-
berg, in Germany. After performing
many surveys as a Licensed Surveyor
in country districts, he became Dis-
trict Surveyor at Goulburn. in which
district Temora was situated when the
rush took place. In 1880 he became
Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, in succession to Mr. P. F.
Adams.
Mr. Vivian Fitzroy Tozer, who mea-
sured the first streets, was a member
of a Port Macquarie familv, where (I
believe) he was born. He was for
many years Licensed and Mining Sur-
veyor for the Cootamundra and Te-
mora districts, and surveyed many of
the farms taken up bv the settlers
who came in the years 1884-1885-1886,
around the town and north of it.
Mr. Schleicher’s career I am unable
to record, except that I am informed
he was for many years in private
practice in Sydney.
James Baker
WARDEN AND POLICE MAGIS-
TRATE
Mr. Baker was born in England and
came to Victoria in the early “Fifties”
He had varied experiences at Balla-
rat and Bendigo. He entered the
Mines Department of New South
Wales and took a prominent part in
framing the Mining Regulations of the
period. -In 1881 he was appointed
Warden of the Copeland Mining Dis-
trict, whence, in 1882, he was ap-
pointed Warden at Temora.
Reginald Zouch
FIRST C.P.S.
Mr. Zouch was born in the southern
district of New South Wales about
1842, the second son of Captain Henry
Zouch, of H.M. 4th Regiment, and
Superintendent of Police, Goulburn.
In early life he entered the service of
the A.J.S. Bank, and was stationed at
Gympie, Queensland, at the height of

the gold rush there. He resigned to fol
low mining pursuits, and subsequently
managed several mines in New South
Wales. In 1880 he was appointed
first Clerk of Petty Sessions at Te-
mora, and in 1887 at Albury, but in
the same year he was seized with a
fatal illness at Goulburn ■ and died
there.
John Trefle, Senr.
Mr. Trefle, senr., was, if I rememb-
er correctly, bom of the French-Ca-


nadian race, a native of Canada. I
had the honor to be attached to a
regiment of his countrymen and to
share their fortunes on the battle-
fields of South Africa. Before he
came to Temora I believe he had lived
for some time in Victoria. He was
one of the earliest farmers in the
Temora district, where he had a good
farm on the Cootamundra-road, on
Deep Creek, not far from Larsen’s
“Monkey Shanty.” That he must
have possessed the sterling qualities
which characterise the French-Cana-
dians —patience, courage and self-re-
liance —is obvious in settling so early
in what was then an isolated spot.
I often rode out in that direction, and
often saw his two youthful sons en-
gaged in farm work. One of them af-
terwards took a valuable share in de-
veloping the agricultural industry in
his district, and a high position in the
Government of his State.
Charles Lawrence
Kendall
Charles Lawrence Kendall, bom in
the South Coast of New South Wales
in 1853, was a grand-son of Thomas
Kendall, who, with the Revd. Samuel
Marsden, in 1814, first introduced
Christianity amongst the Maoris of
New Zealand; and was, also, a cousin
of Henry Clarence Kendall, the gifted
Australian poet. He served as an of-
ficial of the Bank of New South Wales
first as a junior officer at Grenfell and
Gundagai, afterwards as manager at
Temora, Adelong, Gundagai, Inverell
and Bathurst, upwards of 50 years.
A devout and orthodox member of the
Anglican jChurch, and one of the
framers of the Constitution of the
Church of England in Australia, as a

lay representative of the Advisory
Council, he, while at Temora, took a
leading part in church affairs, and
was superintendent of St. Paul’s Sun-
day School during the whole period of
tils residence there. He was a man of
cultured mind, with a courteous and
affable bearing; tolerant of the opin-
ions of others and honorable in the
highest degree. It would be impos-
sible to conceive two men differing so
widely in tastes and temperament
than Mr. Kendall and myself. Yet
for two years we lived together in the
closest personal friendship; never had
an unpleasant word, and in his com-
pany I enjoyed one of the happy per-
iods of my life, retaining a happy
friendship until his death in Sydney
in 1927. He was manager at Bathur-
st for 15 years, where he was highly
esteemed. His name is perpetuated
there in a beautiful avenue of willows
to which the Municipal Council has
given the name of “Kendall Avenue.”
The Hon. John Louis
Trefle
I remember the first time 1 saw
young John Trefle. He came into the
bank of N.S.W. to cash a cheque, but
his family did not bank with us. I
did not know him then, or the drawer
of the cheque, and required identifica-
tion, which he soon obtained. He was
then a tall, well-made, comely, quiet
youth, with a healthy ruddy complex-
ion, strong and sunburnt. He had
driven in a team and was plainly
dressed. Later I saw him hard at
work with a farm apparatus the new
settlers were using to pull down the
trees and saplings. It was called a
“forest devil,” I had never seen it at
work until then. It was an arrange-
ment worked by leverage and a bar.
He was probably about 21 years oi
age when I left Temora. Since I left
I have re-visited it s ix times. }
was interested in John Louis Trefle
and watched his career. Later on as
a champion ploughman' he won many
prizes at local ploughing matches. I
think in one very early ploughing
match at Coolamon he won the £lOO
prize. He became active in all pro-
gressive local movements. He was
one of the first founders of the Farm-
ers and Settlers’ Association, a body
which has had a weighty influence for
good in the rural affairs of this coun-
try. Subsequently he revived the
local newspaper, and as proprietor re-
published the Temora “Independent.”
Returned to the New South Wales
Parliament for the Castlereagh he
eventually was nominated Honorary
Minister, and shortly after assumed
office as Minister for Agriculture in
the first McGowan Labor Govern-
ment. He held office from 10th
October to 29th June, 1913. In the
Holman Cabinet, which followed, he
again held Ministerial rank, from 30th
June, 1913, to 11th January, 1916, ad-
ministering the combined portfolios of
Minister for Lands and Agriculture,
While in office a serious illness, end-
ing in his death, terminated a stren-
uous, honorable and pioneering career.
The Revd. Alexander
Riddel
Alexander Riddel was a Scotsman
by birth, who was educated and train-
ed for the Presbyterian Mission Ser-
vice in South Africa under David
Livingstone, the famous African ex-
plorer. Mr. Riddel lived some years
in that country, when he decided to
come to Australia. In 18_83_ he was
appointed Presbyterian Missionary at
Temora, where he invested in several
blocks of land. In 1885 he was trans-
ferred to Broken Hill —then becoming
a populous silver mining centre.
Equipping himself with a strong two-
horse dray, he covered it with can-
vas, fitted it up with travelling con-
veniences and stores, and started ov-
erland with his wife and family on a
journey of over 600 miles. After a
long trip he reached his destination
safely. Some time after he resigned
from the church, turned journalist,
and started one of the earliest and
most influential newspapers in the
Barrier City. On 21st October, 1887,
he was appointed a Magistrate. A
well-educated, versatile, energetic
man, he later studied metallurgical
science, and practised as a mining ex-
pert. About two years ago, while
visiting a mine in the Rockley-Oberon
district for inspection the car in
which he was •‘•turning to Bathurst
with a companion overturned, and Mr.
Riddel was killed instantly. He was
76 years of age.

Edward Becker
Edward Becker, the landlord of the
Court House Hotel, at the corner of
Loftus and Deßoos streets, with whom
I first boarded when I came to Tern-
ora, was utterly unfitted to be a
hotelkeeper. He was a German, born
on the Rhine, a most easy-going, mild
old fellow. By trade he was an en-
gineer, and mechanical expert. He
spent most of his time in a workshop
in a building behind the hotel where
he had a lathe, a saw-bench and all
sorts of mechanical devices. He was,
undoubtedly, a clever, skilled work-
man. The most important work he
was engaged on when I stayed there
was a sheep-shearing machine, and he
was in constant communication with
Mr. F. G. Wolseley—the inventor later
on of the present wonderful machine,
Becker had a very complicated inven-
tion of his own, but he never could
get beyond a certain stage with it.
When he reached that stage and gave
it a trial it would cut off the sheep’s
legs, so he would have to start all over
again. I used to ride out along the
Mirrool-road and cut down myall
trees to get at the heart of the wood.
There were plenty of fine grown myall
trees there then. Becker would re-
duce them for me, and turn and pol-
ish them. I have in my room as I
write two myall walking sticks he
turned for me, also a paper knife, per-
fectly done.
I will end by saying I retain also
in my possession still, and value it
very much, an excellent copy of
Adam Lindsay Gordon’s poems, given
to me by Father Fallon when my
friend Kendall and I visited him one
evening in those far-off days.


A PIONEER FAMILY
THE CARTWRIGHTS—1810-1930
(By Watson A. Steele —Royal Aus-
tralian Historical Society)
The pioneers of every new coun-
try comprise two classes —the active
and the passive. “It is the law of
nature, common to mankind, that
those who have strength and excel-
lence shall rule over those that have
less,” so wrote the Greek philosopher,
hundreds of years ago, and it holds
good to this day.
Our inland districts and towns were
first discovered, and afterwards set-
tled, by the boldest, most enterpris-
ing, the most physically fit, enduring
and capable men of action in the popu-
lation. The timid, the doubtful, and
less resourceful elements remained
close to the established centres, con-
tent to wait and reap where others
sowed. There are amongst some of
our pioneer families those whose an-
cestors reached these shores over one
hundred years ago, who count four
and five generations in their stock,
few of whom ever permanently have
lived outside the County of Cumber-
land. There are others who did yeo-
man service in Government positions,
in settling in the wilderness, in found-
ing towns and industries; promoting
religion, and contributing to the
spiritual and material advancement of
Australia, of whose labours we know
very little, and might, with advant-
age, neam more. We know little of
them partly because their descendants
are too modest to claim publicity for
their work: partly because the vicis-
situdes of fortune have placed them
in less prominent positions in life than
their worthy forbears and they are
sensitive of what savours of self-ad-
vertisement: and partly because they
have had no opportunity of finding a
competent and sympathetic chronicle
of the family annals. Amongst the
very early pioneers who came to the
infant Colony of New South Wales,
one hundred and twenty years ago,
and who, from the first, and ever
since, have spent their lives in its in-
land spaces, were those who bore the
honored name of Cartwright. The
first of the name was a pioneer of the
Cross: the second was, a hundred
years ago, a pioneer of the Bland:
the third is a pioneer of Temora, its
lands, its agriculture, and of its pub-
lic institutions, of over fifty years’
standing, and still with us—a typical
pioneer. Of these generations none
accumulated great riches, or rose to
high distinction, but all were men of ■
worth and fiine achievement. Each
possessed “strength and excellence”
and could justly say, like the famous
naval hero, Nelson, “What I have,
I earned honestly. It never cost the
nation a farthing, nor a widow a
tear.”
THE REV. ROBERT CARTWRIGHT
Robert Cartwright was born in
England in the year 1771. He was
educated at St. Edmund’s Hall, Ox-
ford, entering the Church in 1794, be-
ing nominated to the curacy of Brad-
ford, in Yorkshire, where he remained
until 1808. In that year the Rev.
Samuel Marsden, the Senior Chaplain
of New South Wales, was on a visit
to England for the purpose of urging
upon the British Government the ne-
cessity of increasing the number of
Anglican clergy ami school teachers
in the Colony, m which at that period
there was only one other clergyman
licensed to do duty amongst a popu-
lation of ten thousand people—the
Rev. Harry Fulton. Mr. Marsden,
during a visit to Yorkshire (his native
county), there met Robert Cartwright,
and prevailed upon him to join him,
and return with him to New South
Wales, obtaining for him at the same
time from the authorities the appoint-
ment of Colonial Chaplain in that set-
tlement, with the rank of Third As-
sistant Chaplain, the Rev. William
Cowper having been just previously
appointed Second Assistant Chaplain,
under Mr. Marsden.
The earliest reference to Mr. Cart-
wrights connection with Australia
that 1 am able to find occurs in the
following letter:—
The Rev. S. Marsden, to Under-
secretary Cooke.
Ivy-Eane, No. 8, 30th April, 1809.
Sir.—The ship Ann being taken
up to carry male convicts to New
South Wales, I shall be glad if
you can accommodate myself and
Rev. Cartwright with a passage.
My family will consist of my
wife, and five children. I shall
want about five tons for my
baggage, tools of agriculture,
books for the schools, shoes and
clothing for the children belong-
ing to the Orphan School, which
I have been requested by the com-
mittee to take out for them.
The Rev. Cartwright’s family
will consist of his wife, six child-
ren and two servants. His bag-
gage may be from two to three
tons. As a convict ship will not
be the most agreeable to our
families, I trust you will give di-
rections that we may be ac-
commodated in as comfortable a
manner as the circumstances of
the ship will admit.
I have, etc.,
SAMUEL MARSDEN.
(Hist. Records of N.S. Wales, Vol.
Vll, page 111.
Mr. Cooke, to whom this letter was
addressed, was the Under; Secretary
at the Colonial Ofijce, through which
all transactions at that time passed.
Mr. Marsden and family, Mr. Cart-
wright and family, with Mr. Hall, a
missionary for New Zealand, embark-
ed on this ship—“ The Ann”—and ar-
rived at Sydney on the 27th of Febru-
ary, 1810. Without loss of time, Mr.
Cartwright was sent to take charge
of the Hawkesbury district, the most
extensive and most sparsely-populated
parish in the Colony, whose bound-
reside permanently at the Hawkes-
on the north to the unknown country
beyond Appin, on the south. There
were no churches for him to preach
in, very few schools and no definite
roads. The population of the
Hawkesbury district in 1810 is
officially given as 2389, of all classes,
with 32 military. At first he did not
reside permanetnly at the Hawkes-
bury, but in a General and Govern-
ment Order, dated 15th September,
1810, Governor Macquarie issued the
following notification: “The Rev. Wil-
liam Cooper, First Assistant Chaplain,
is appointed to be the resident chap-
lain at Sydney, and the Rev. Robert
Cartwright, Second Assistant Chap-
lain, is appointed to be the resident
chaplain in the Hawkesbury district.”
(Hist. Records of N.S. Wales, Vol.
VII, page 409.)
In addition to his clerical duties,
Macquarie, in another Government and
General Order, dated Bth June, 1811,
appointed him a Magistrate, and the
scope of his activities can be guessed
by its perusal. It states: “His Ex-
cellency, the Governor, has been
pleased to appoint the Rev. Robert
Cartwright a justice of the peace,
and magistrate in the township of
Wilberforce—His Excellency directs
that a Bench of Magistrates consist-
ing of William Cox, Esq., the Rev.
Robert Cartwright, and James Mile-
ham, Esq., shall assemble every Sat-
urday, until further orders, at Wind-
sor for the despatch of all magisterial
business from the several adjoining
districts and townships of Richmond,
Castlereagh, Wilberforce and Pitt
Town.” (Hist. Records of N.S. Wales
Vol. VII, page 541.
Mr. Cartwright frequently assisted
in functions outside his parochial
duties, for instance, he was a favorite
with Macquarie, and he is found often
accompanying him on his journeys in-
to the interior, or upon his visits to
country centres. From his associa-
tion with Macquarie, we are able to
infer what manner of man he was, for
Macquarie himself was a man who
was impatient of cultivating the
friendship of men of narrow outlook,
or mediocre abilities. His favorite
men were men, as a rule, of vigour,
ability, liberal views, and tolerant
temperaments. We must assume,
therefore, that Rev. Robert Cart-
wright must have had these qualities
to commend him to such a Governor.
On 2nd December, 1810, he preached
before Governor Macquarie, we are
told, “in the temporary church at
Green Hills” (now Richmond) and he
accompanied him at intervals during
that month and up to the middle of
January, 1811, in his tour of in-
spection when naming the towns of
Windsor, Richmond, Castel-
reagh, Wilberforce and Pitt Town.
Nevertheless, he found time to be
present on Christmas Day (25th De


cember, 1810) at the consecration of
St. Phillip’s Church, Sydney, the only
one there then. Mr. Cartwright re-
mained in charge of the church at the
Hawkesbury, when, additional clergy-
men having arrived, and additional
parishes having been established, he
was removed on account of his health
to Liverpool, in 1819, where he
initiated steps to build the present St.
Luke’s Church, and where he con-
tinued to labour until his resignation
in 1836.
In 1812, he received from Macquarie
a land grant of 640 acres, in the
parish of Mulgoa, not far from Pen-
rith. All the clergy of that time
were allowed a land grant to compen-
sate them as a provision for old age;
no pensions being granted them.
And his salary was by no means
princely, with a large family to pro-
vide for, it had remained, until 1824,
at £240 per annum. He named his
Mulgoa grant “Hawkestone.” It
afterwards passed in the hands of Sir
John Jamieson, and it is stated his
historic and beautiful home, known
as “Regentville” (now in ruins), was
built on the Cartwright grant.
(Royal Aus. Historical Society Jour-
nal, Vol. IV, page 176). Subsequent-
ly, in recognition of his services, he
was given an additional grant of 520
acres adjoining the town of Liverpool.
On 16th October, 1820, he joined
Governor Macquarie’s party at Liver-
pool, proceeding to the newly dis-
covered country in the south, which
had during the previous two years
explored and examined by Dr. Charles
Throsby, Hamilton Hume and Deputy
Surveyor-General James Meehan, ex-
tending from the present town of
Mossvale, and including the country
lying between the present cities of
Goulburn and Canberra, as far as
Lake Bathurst and Lake George.
On the 28th of October, he was one
of the Government party who first
viewed Lake George, and on the fol-
lowing day, on the shores of Lake
Bathurst, and on the edge of Goulburn
Plains, he conducted the first ser-
vice for Divine worship held in the
southern district of N.S. Wales. In
addition to his ministerial duties at
Liverpool, while there he actively
identified himself with projects for
the amelioration and civilization of
the blacks. He memorialized Mac-
quarie on their behalf, and suggested
large land reservations, and town-
ships for their maintenance, and al-
though his plan was not entirely car-
ried out, three establishments were
created for the bettering of their con-
dition. In 1825 he assumed control
of the Male Orphan School, then in a
parlous state of inefficiency, neglect
and irregularity. In four years under
his supervision he restored “a system
of unprecedented order and pro-
prietry.” (Archdeacon Scott, 1829).
Upon his resignation of St. Luke’s
Parish, Liverpool, in 1836, he was
transferred to St. James Church,
Sydney, and officiated there until 1838,
when he retired from active parochial
work, to reside at Collector, Lake
George, where he had a property.
While at St. Jame’s, Sydney, he was
present at the laying of the founda-
tion of the present Cathedral of St.
Andrew’s, and read the morning pray-
ers at the service which was held on
the occasion. Although no longer in
charge of a parish, Mr. Cartwright,
while living at Collector, conducted
services in premises attached to his
private house, constantly visiting and
preaching at the outlying centres of
population. Early in 1838 he preach-
ed at Queanbeyan and at Duntroon
(now Canberra) before any resident
clergymen were stationed there, and
from that year onwards, when his
health permitted, he acted as an itin-
erant minister, at Gunning, Burrowa
and Yass, where he assisted to build
churches and parsonages.
In 1851 he held office as Bishop’s
Commissary, and died at Collector, on
the 14th December, 1856, in his 86th
year. A few days afterwards his
body was taken to Liverpool, and
buried in the cemetery adjacent to
St. Luke’s Church, of which he was
the founder and father.
The following is inscribed on his
tomb there:—

JOHN CARTWRIGHT
Pioneer of the Bland
I have not any record of the place
and date of the birth of John Cart-
wright, the earliest resident pioneer
on the Bland, but I conjecture he was
born in Yorkshire, when his father
was curate of Bradford: and that he
was one of the “six children” men-
tioned as arriving at Port Jackson,
with their parents, in the transport
“Ann,” on the 27th of February, 1810.
In the very early days of this colony
there were few opportunities of ad-
vancement open to its young men.
The professions were non-existent.
Respectable employment was con-
fined to the minor offices of the Gov-
ernment service, or to the newly es-
tablished industry of stock-owning
and grazing, or “squatting,” as it
afterwards was called. The patron-
age in the former, at least in the
higher grades, rested with the Home
Government, who nominated their
friends’ friends; and the latter, until
1820, was limited in its activity to a
territory about one hundred and forty
miles in length—from Newcastle to
Illawarra —and some one hundred and
thirty miles in breadth—from the
coast inland to Bathurst and Goul-
burn Plains. From 1820 the discov-
eries of Evans, Oxley, Throsby, Hume
and Sturt opened the far interior to
pastoral occupation; whither the most
adventurous of the young men, both
native and immigrant, with their
flocks and herds, sought, like the
patriarchs of old, fresh fields and
pastures. At first they were not
recognised by the Government, but
their numbers, activity, wealth and
influence became so powerful, that in
1835 they could no longer be ignored,
and they were granted valid tenures
of occupation. The name of John
Cartwright appears, with those of
Gibson and Chisholm ,in the list of
those licensed in 1835, to occupy land
in the unsetled districts “beyond the
limits of location.”
The western boundary of the colony
at that time ran from near the pre-
sent town of Woodstock—north of
Cowra—southwards through Burrowa
and Yass. But there is evidence that
John Cartwright had formed stations
at “Bland and “Barmedman” at a
much earlier date than the Squatting
Act of 1836.
About 1832, the Rev. Henry Fulton
and his sons formed a station on the
Lachlan, at “Cowra Rocks” (now the
site of the Parish and Town of Cow-
ra.) Mr. George Rauken, of Bathur-
st, had, earlier, about the end of 1829,
formed a station where the present
town of Woodstock is built, and the
Fultons (who had grants on Bathur-
st Plains) and other Bathurst settlers
followed Mr. Rauken. J. W. Fulton
was a brother-in-law of Mr. John
Cartwright, so the sons of these
early clergymen were pioneers of
both the Lachlan and the Bland, near-
ly a hundred years ago. At that
period the blacks between the Lach-
lan and the Darling were wild, un-
civilized, and frequently made attacks
upon the white inhabitants, as both
Sturt, on the Darling, in 1830, and
Mitchell, on tire Bogan, in 1835, ex-
perienced.
■ When John Cartwright and his con-
temporaries formed their homesteads
on the Bland, they, therefore, liter-
ally carried their lives in the hands.
I regret I have not been able to ob-
tain fuller particulars of Mr. Cart-
wright’s career, but hope to do so
later, as any history of the Bland re-
mains incomplete without them.

W. J. CARTWRIGHT
Pioneer of Temora
When I applied to Mr. W. J. Cart-
wright for some information concern-
ing his family, he very kindly and
courteously sent me along some valu-
able facts which I have availed myself
of in writing this notice.
William John Cartwright is a son
of Thomas Charles Cartwright, and a
grandson of the Rev. Robert Cart-
wright. His father, Thomas Charles
Cartwright, was a Government official,
who served in Tasmania from 1838
to 1847, when he returend to New
South Wales. He subsequently set-
tled, with his brother, on a property
at Windellima, 9 mites E.N.E. of
Lake Bathurst, and about 20 mites
south of Goulburn. The Rev. James
Hassall mentions in his interesting
book, “In Old Australia,” that he
visited the Cartwright brothers there
in 1850.
Mr. W. J. Cartwright was born at
Windellima, on the 27th of May.
1849. He was one of a family of
ten children —five boys and five girls.
His father died in 1858, when he was
9 years old, and at that early age,
with his brothers and sisters, he anil
they suffered the great sorrow of be-
ing left orphans. Thus early, he com-
menced to fight his own battle in the
world. How splendidly he fought
his way, let those who admire cour-
age and character, read the record of
his carreer.
Within a day of his twentieth birth-
day he married. At twenty-one he
settled in the Cootamundra district,
and in 1872 selected 80 acres of land
at Wallendbeen. During the next
ten years he made up his holding to
800 acres. Selling out he came to
the Temora district in 1882 and took
up a section of 640 acres of land 14
mites from the town, which he named
“Boundary Villa,” as it was consider-
ed to be, geographically, near the
boundary of Riverina. This property,
enlarged and improved, he still owns.
When I lived in Temora, 47 years ago,
I remember Mr. Cartwright occasion-
ally visiting the town. He was one
of the lion-hearted band of wheat-
growers who came into the district
between 187 G and 1890, and changed
the face of the country from a few
primitive stock stations, to a vast
network of mixed farms, substantial
homes, and prosperous towns.
He did not confine himself merely
to agricultural pursuits, or live for
himself alone. He early took a pro-
minent and energetic interest in all
local public movements for the ad-
vancement of the community, and im-
provement of cereal culture. He was
one of the old committee of the Hos-
pital and an advocate for the railway
extension to Temora. He was one of
the founders of the Farmers and Set-
ters’ Association, and a delegate from
his district, with the late Hon. J. L.
Trefle and Robert Cassin, of Barmed-
man, to its first Conference, held at
Cootamundra, on the 23rd January,
1893, when the original constitution of
that body was framed. He has been
associated with the Temora Show
since its inauguration in 1885, and
had been its President for thirty
years, and is now the Patron of the
Society.
Now retired into private life, in his
82nd year, he resides in the city of
Goulburn, where we hope his years
may be prolonged, accompanied with
health and happiness, and that the
lands at “Boundary Villa” may re-
main in possession of his posterity
unto the fourth generation.

THE HISTORY OF THE GOLD FIELD
REPRINTED FROM THE TEMORA “INDEPENDENT” SOUVENIR NUMBER OF DECEMBER, 1908.
The following particulars respect-
ing the discovery of gold and the pro-
gress of the Temora field have been
gathered from the official records and
reports of the Department of Mines
to the Under Secretary. While the
information taken from such dry
sources must naturally fail to de-
pict the stirring scenes of excitement,
the feverish energy, and the contin-
uous bustle which followed on the
announcement of the finding of pay-
able alluvial gold, still it is sufficient
to prove the important part this min-
ing field has filled in the history of the
population and settlement of this dis-
trict. This article is vyritten with a
view of placing in the hands of the
present residents a lasting and reli-
able record.
At Temora, as elsewhere in this
State, mining operations precipitated
settlement, and were responsible for
the rapid development of the pastoral
and agricultural industries. It has
been well said, long before the dis-
coveries at Temora, by the late C. R.
Wilkinson. Government Geologist,
that “So widely distributed are our
mineral deposits, and so associated
are they with the pastoral and agri-
cultural areas, that they appear to
have been designedlv thus disposed in
order that the mining, pastoral, and
agricultural industries might contri-
bute to each other’s advancement,
and that their development mi"ht oc-
cupy and reward with prosperity the
energies of a large and increasing
population. We cannot doubt that a
very significant future awaits the
progress of a country thus singularly
favored with such natural greatness.”
How peculiarly applicable these pro-
phetic words w 7 sre to Temora.
First Discovery of Go ld
According to the official records,
gold appears to have been discovered
as far back as 1869. It is stated that
Goldspink and party found a reef
while sinking post holes on Temora
run, and a trial crushing was put
through at Junee, but found unpay-
able. For a number of years, sub-
sequently, Henry Waite carried on ac-
tive operations from time to time,
but no discovery was reported by
him. This man seems to have en-
couraged Henry Parker and party,
who had been mining at the Scrub
Yards, to give the field a trial, and
they took up a prospecting protection
area on the deep ground, at Tem-
ora, on 17th November, 1879. Other
persons were also attracted to the
field, and George Bloomfield and party
seem to have been the first discover-
ers of payable gold in shallow ground
about the latter end of January,
1880. But the area proved of limited
extent. Parker and party, with the
object, it is stated, of securing the
Government reward of £lOOO, im-
mediately hoisted the red flag and re-
ported the discovery of gold on Feb-
ruary 3, 1880. Unfortunately the
telegram from the Warden’s office at
Braidwood converted the yield of 2
to 4 grs. to the dish, into ounces, and
a rush at once followed. Intense ex-
citement prevailed, which were fanned
into fury when the exact facts were
disclosed. Poor Parker narrowly es-
caped being lynched, and the red flag
was taken down and torn into shreds
by the furious miners. This rush
quickly subsided and those who re-
mained turned their attention to
quartz-mining and prospecting. It is
recorded that a parcel of two tons of
quartz crushed from the Hidden Star
reef in February, gave a yield of five
ounce three pennyweights of gold.
Among those who were engaged
prospecting was James Moloney, who
was the original prospector of
Scrub Yards, Woodstown, and precur-
sor of Temora. He had struck pay-
able gold there in what w T as after-
wards known as Ponting’s Prospect-
ing Shaft, Exhibition Lead. Moloney
took up a prospecting protection
area, at Temora in May. 1880. on
what ultimately proved the main line
of lead. Another man, named Patrick
Murray, who claimed to have found
gold at Temora as far back as 1878,
(but not in a payable quantity) re-
ported the discovery a day after
Moloney and party—on July 1, 1880.
It was these two discoveries which set
the stream of miners back once more
to Temora. In the short, snace of five
weeks it was estimated that there
were 20.000 persons located on the
field. The hunger for claims, for
allotments, for an area of any sort, no
matter how small, seemed literally
insatiable, while the hardships were
added to by the fact that it was a
very severe winter. As to provisions,
there was no choice, the people had
to take what they could get, and to
pay the famine prices demanded.
Water for drinking purposes was
scarce and difficult to obtain, while
there was no supply available for
puddling the wash dirt. In consid-
ering the many pioneers of this field,
two other parties have to be spec-
ially mentioned. Alexander Ross ar-
rived in Temora early in April and
obtained payable gold in the deep
ground, while James Moore and party
were the first to find gold in the shal-
low ground immediately below the
reefs at Upper Temora. The reward
of £lOOO for the discovery of the field
was apportioned, after due investiga-
tion as to the merits of the claimants,
as follows :
James Maloney and party .. £4OO
P. Murray and party .. .. £l5O
A. Ross £l5O
J. Moore and party £l5O
H. Parker and party .. .. £l5O
The Establishment of
the Town
The Mining Registrar, Mr. H.
Margules, selected the site for the
town of Temora on 15th May, 1880.
Instructions were issued to Mr. Sur-
veyor Tozer on 11th June, of that
year, and four streets were at once
set off. Mr. Surveyor Schleicher
then undertook to lay out the town,
and he marked off six sections, but as
these were found inadequate, six ad-
ditional sections were marked. Still
the demand for areas continued, so
the town extended and settlements
were established at Upper Temora,
and later Middle Temora, where the
town now stands. The report of the
Mining Registrar mentions that the
houses extended in one continuous
chain along the one street for a len-
gth of three miles. This street he
named Hoskins-street .after the then
Minister for Lands. The Mining Re-
gistrar expressed regret that the
district had not been proclaimed _ a
goldfield as advocated by Mr. Patrick
Murray some years previously, as the
settlement for Lower Temora was
upon Mr. A. L. Deutscher’s selection,
now known as Curry’s paddock, it
being estimated that Mr. Dcutscher
drew over £6O a week in rents and
tributes. The close of the year 1880
therefore, saw a well laid out town-
ship. The creature comforts of the
inhabitants were well catered for, as
there were upwards of sixty hotels in
the town. Water was, however, scar-
ce and was selling at 3/6 -a small cask;
tanks and dams were accordingly be-
ing constructed on every available and
suitable site in the hope that rain
would soon fall. Thus, in a few
months, a settlement was located, and
a thriving population established on
what was previous a sheep walk, while
the thick pine scrub was replaced as
by magic by a fine town, which to the
stranger would appear to have been in
existence for years.


The Geology of the
Field
OFFICIAL REPORT MADE IN 1881
The Temora field was reported on
by Mr. C. S. Wilkinson in the year
1881, and the following information
is taken from his report;
“The Temora district presents
similar geological features to those of
Forbes, Parkes, Gulgong and Grenfell
goldfields, viz., silurian slates, sand-
stones, conglomerates, and limestonps.
which have in places been disturbed l y
intrusions of hornblendic igneous
rocks, chiefly diorite. The latter oc-
cur as dyke masses of irregular width,
from 10 feet, as at ’Possum Power, to
about i a mile wide, as at Temora,
and extending in a north-westerly
direction. Both the sedimentary and
igneous rocks are traversed by num-
erous quartz reefs, bn: it is only the
reefs in the diorite, and those prin-
cipally in the western portion of the
dyke, and in the slates adjoining it,
that have yielded much gold to ihe
leads. During the latest Tertiary
period this country suffered great de-
nudation, and deep valleys were erod-
ed. When these valleys happen, as
at Temora, to have been eroded in the
formation containing the gold-bearing
quartz-veins, the disintegrated rock
material has been, as it were, ground
sluiced on an enormous scale, and
the greater oart of the liberated gold
concentrated in the gravelly beds of
the old water courses. The great
rainfall of this, which wo mighs truly
designate •■he pluvial period of ihe
valleys, then gradually filled them up
to their present level. But though,
on the whole, the rainfall became less
there were evidently intervals of
heavy rain, for we notice in the Te-
mora lead that the alluvial deposits
have been at different levels excava-
ted by running water and the worn
cut hollows filled wiiii coarse water-
worn gravel (some of the boulders be-
ing 18 inches in diameter) and this
again has been covered with sedi-
ments of fine sand and clay. These
features are mentioned as explaining
the occurrence of irregular patches of
gold-bearing gravel or wash at differ-
ent levels, and why the wash has not
in some instances rested on the true
bottom of the old valley. The Te-
mora lode has its source on the nor-
thern slope of Rich’s Hill, a short dis-
tance above the Upper Township, and
then trends with an irregular course
in a north-westerly direction for a
distance of about three and a half
miles, after passing on the east side
of the Middle Township and through
Lower Temora, until lost under the
broad alluvial flat through which the
Wollondilly Creek flows. The average
depth of sinking along the course of
the lead was from 60 to 90 feet, but
it has been found to vary from 40
feet in places to over 100 feet in oth-
ers, and even to 200 feet and over.
This unevenness in the bed of the
lead and the occasional patchy nature
of the deposits of wash dirt have led
to the belief by some persons that it
is not a true lead; but, as pointed out,
this irregularity is due to some por-
tions of the drift resting upon a false
bottom. On the slope of the Diorite
Hill, near the Upper Township, some
good surfacing has been worked, and
then the alluvial suddenly deepens
and forms the Cement Lead, which is
the head of the Temora Lead, and is
so called from the pebbles, sand, and
clay of the wash being cemented to-
gether by the red peroxide or iron.
The frequent change of color from red
and yellow to white in the strata surd-
through in various parts of the Tem-
ora lead, as shown in the heaps lying
at the mouths of the shafts, is very
striking, and is due to irregular
straining of the strata with iron
oxide. Numerous hard nodules or
clinkers occur in the clays and drifts:
they have been chemically formed
from minerals in solution in these de-
posits, and consist of silica with mag-
nesia and lime. On breaking them
they are usually seen to have in the
centre irregular open cracks, the sur-
faces of which are covered with min-
ute, perfectly transparent acicular
crystals of quartz. It may be men-
tioned that Mr. Wilkinson held
strongly to the theory that a second
bottom would be found to exist in this
field, but although considerable sums
were expended from the Prospecting
Vote the results did not substantiate
that view. We are of opinion—and
this opinion is supported by the opin-
ions of experienced miners—that a
rich fissure reef will yet be found at
a depth in Upper Temora and on to
Reefton and Barmedman.
The Gold Won
To the end of 1907 the Temora field
had yielded gold to the value of
£558,271. Operations in the alluvial
ground proved that the wash dirt was
somewhat patchy, having varied in
thickness from a few inches up to six
feet or more in places, and in width
from 20 feet un to 100 feet and over.
The wash in the Golden Gate was
some 40 feet thick. The finding of
large nuggets, the weight of which
appears to have been exaggerated at
the time by the press in distant plac-
es, seems to have greatly fanned the
excitement and stimulated the rush to
the field. From the three, celebrated
claims of Keating and Haynes, Nu-
gent and Adams, and Buckley and
party. 1500 nzs. of nuggets were
picked out by hand. The nuggets ob-
tained weighed 99, 76, 68, 50, 45. 28,
24, 16 and 14 oz., while numbers
weighing half an ounce and upwards
were secured. The gold found on
this field was mostly coarse and jag-
ged, not water worn, and some of
the nuggets contained a considerable
quantity of quartz.
Rich Quartz Specimens
Increased attention was given to
quartz mining in the year 1885, the
principal claims being the South Aus-
tralian, the Mother Shipton, ami the
Homeward Bound. Some exception-
ally rich specimens were obtained
from the Mother Shipton claim, three
of which were purchased by the Gov-
ernment. The largest specimen was
estimated to contain 253 ozs. of fine
gold in about 60 ozs. of pure white
quartz, the second contamed 414 ozs.
of gold in about 90 ozs. of quartz,
while the smallest contained !) ozs.
of gold adhering to a small piece of
quartz. The largest specimen was
exhibited in 1907 by the Agent-
General in a shop window in Lon-
don, and was stolen by burglars. Its
value, however, was well cove vd by
insurance. The smallest specimen
was presented to Queen Victoria by
Sir Alex. Stuart, during Her Ma-
jesty’s visit to the Colonial and In-
dian Exhibition.
The Field and It s De-
velopment
Following on the period of feverish
activity, the year 1883 witnessed the
setting in of a cycle of depression.
Both Upper and Lower 'femora, and
particularly the latter, took on the ap-
pearance of deserted villages, whih
Middle Temora, although holding its
own, was feeling the pinch. Replying
to the statement of the alarmist that
Temora was “used up,” Mr. Warden
Baker enlarged on the suitability of
the district for the growing of cereals
and he emphatically stated that there
could be no question as to its future.
The exodus of miners continued, hut
in 1885 the Warden ■•eported that the
town was taking on a much more per-
manent appearance. The old
“bark humpies” which were remark-
able for their number and unsight-
liness, had disappeared, and their
places were occupied by neat and
permanent structures, while outside
the town bona fide seleccors were
converting the bush lands into com-
fortable and remunerative farms.
The Warden recorded with pride that
just prior to the close of the year
1885 a pastoral, agricultural and hor-
ticultural association was successfully
established. Dwelling on this fact, he
stated : “For many years gold mining
will be a factor in the prosperity of
this district, but other industries will
grow quite sufficient to support Tem-
ora as a central inland town, even if
gold mining were to entirely cease,
which is not likely for many years to
come.” These words seem to have
aptly summed up the conditions of
affairs at Temora, and to apply equal
ly to-day as they did 23 years ago, and
with them this article on the history
of the discovery of gold may well be
brought to a conclusion.

The “Mother Shipton” Nugget
The above is a reproduction of the sketch of the “Mother Shipton”
Nugget, which was obtained in the early days of mining activity in Temora,
and which was stolen. The photo, and description of the nuggets appear-
ed in an English paper, the letterpress being as follows :—“A daring rob-
bery of valuable quartz, as reported by cable, took place on the 30th
August at the offices of the Orient Royal Mail Steamship Co., in Cockspur-
street, London. The quartz belonged to the New South Wales Government,
having been lent by them to the Orient Company to be placed in the
window of the company’s office for exhibition. One piece—“The Mother
Shipton”—was of considerably greater value than the other, being almost
solid gold, and probably the richest lump of quartz in the world. It’s
value is set down at £1250. The other piece, which is much lighter, is worth
£l4O. The gold was mined in the “Mother Shipton” Reef, at Temora, New
South Wales. The theft was apparently carried out with the utmost sim-
plicity. Apparently the thieves waited until the policeman on the beat
had gone by, when one smashed the window with his foot, and, taking
out the booty, got away with as much expedition as possible.”
The “Mother Shipton” is 9 inches high by 11 inches broad at the base,
and the white patches in the sketch show “knobs” and ‘fingers” of pure
gold, which contributed to its great worth.
FAMOUS TEMORA
NUGGETS
“THE MOTHER SHIPTON”
Writing recently to the Secretary
of the Back-to-Temora Jubilee Cele-
bration, concerning models of famous
gold nuggets found at Temora, the
Under-Secretary for Mines made tne
statement that the Department has
no models of Temora nuggets other
than that weighing 168 oz. 2 dwt.
found in 1884, and which the Commit-
tee has arranged to obtain a loan of.
In the year 1885, the Department
purchased three specimens of gold
from the ‘Mother Shipton’ Mine.
These were exhibited at the Colonial
and Indian Exhibition, London, 1883,
and were thus catalogued:—
Gold in Quartz. Mother Shipton
Reef, Temora Gold Field.
(1) Depth 90 feet from surface.
This specimen is estimated (by
specific gravity test) to contain
258.33 oz. of gold.
(2) Estimated to contain 41.53
oz. of gold.
(3) Estimated to contain 8.49
oz of gold.
The total amount paid by the De-
partment was £1233/8/- and these
specimens represented part of a patch
which yielded gold valued at £4,300.
The smallest specimen was present-
ed by the Commissioner to Queen
Victoria, and the other two specimens
were exhibited at other exhibitions
(notably Chicago, U.S.A., in 1893)
and were then loaned to the Agent-
General in London for window dis-
play in 1906. They were stolen on
30th August, 1906, from the offices
of the Orient Steam Navigation Com-
pany in London and never recovered.


SEBASTOPOL IN SEVENTY
Mr. H. M. Kavanagh Tells an Interesting
Story
ME. HARRY KAVANAGH was born
on “Eulomo” Station (still con-
trolled by the Sawyers) and as that
is only 30 miles away from Temora,
he may be said to have lived the
whole 70 years of his life in this dis-
district. His father was a boundary-
rider on “Eulomo” Station in 18G0,
and afterwards lived for a time at
Wallaroobie. With his wife and, fam-
ily, he came to Sebastopol in 1870.
Mining was begun there in 1860 as
the result of a discovery of gold by a
shepherd who was in the employ of
Mr. Comans, of the Combaning Sta-
tion. Mr. Comans had a subsidiary
station about the spot where Mr.
Thomas Charles is now farming, and
the shepherd found gold up near the
Junee-road. Messrs. Ryan and Pat.
Heffernan immediately interested
themselves in the matter, and started
the “Morning Star” mine. After
working it for some years, they sold
out to Mr. Nicholson and Rich Bros,
from Grenfell, who worked the mine
for two eight-hour shifts daily. They
had two engine-drivers and a set of
12 stampers. The mine was sunk
200 feet deep and was the deepest in
the district for some time. The own-
ers constructed a big dam away to
the south of the mine, and placed a
battery upon it. Mr. Walter Welling-
ton subsequently brought an eight-
head battery from Grenfell and
crushed for the “Homeward Bound.”
Though the year 18G9 was exception-
ally dry (the first miners having to
get their domestic supply from
springs the other side of Combaning—
paying 2s. Cd. per bucket to the
carters), the year 1870 was very wen.
The father and brothers of Mrs.
“Ollie” Pike sledged the eight-head
battery (which weighed 31 tons) from
Grenfell, using a team of 24 bullocks.
It rained for three months in 1870
without stopping.
At first Mr. Kavanagh, senr., work-
ed in the mines and the family lived
nearby. The first crushing was taken
to Junee Reefs and went two ounces
to the ton. Subsequently, with stamp-
ers installed locally, both the
“Morning Star” and the “Homeward
Bound” gave yields of eight ounces to
the ton. The stone was exceptionally
rich near the surface. The ‘Morning
Star” was worked for three years
Subsequently a large lot of tailings
was treated by Mr. Marshall (late of
Barmedman), who had a roasting fur-
nace. The result was not a success,
nor were the operations of Messrs.
Fetherstone and Barbett, who brought
along a grinding machine. They
only got 21 dwts. to the ton treated.
Finally a company from New Zealand
brought along a cyaniding plant,
which cleaned up the tailings thor-
oughly, to very great advantage. In
all they treated 14,000 tons and made,
good money from it. A Mr. Millctt
was manager, but he died before tin-
job was completed. His father came
from New Zealand to finish the work
and finally shifted the plant over Al-
bury way. About two years were oc-
cupied in putting the tailings through.
The cyaniders got half-an-ouncc to
the ton from 2000 tons of “Homeward
Bound” metal, which was carted to
the plant at a cost of about Is. per
ton. These men had a wonderful
plant, consisting of three big vats,
one of which was 30 feet in the air,
and would hold 50 tons of sand. Quite
recently Mr. A. A. Stevenson, of
Temora, has re-opened the “Morning-
Star” and erected a battery there.
Sebastopol was a busy place in the
seventies, remarked Mr. Kavanagh,
reminiscently. Mr. Pat. HefTeman
had the “Exchange Hotel,” and there
were two others, conducted respectiv-
ely by Mr. Hansen and by Mrs. Ohio
Pike’s father. There were two but-
cheries, one conducted by Mr. Barrett
and the other by Mr. Denis Kavanagh
(father of H.M.). Harry was deliv-
ery boy, taking the meat around in a
basket on horseback. The houses
were mostly of bark (sides and
roof) with dirt lloors. Usually two
miners shared one of these huts,
which were very snug. There were
about 70 children attending the
school, the first teacher of which was
“Professor” Osborne, an Englishman.
It was a subsidised school, and Mr.
Osborne collected sixpence per scho-
lar on Monday mornings. The second
teacher was a Frenchman named
Chiffola (spelling not vouched for).
Afterwards there came Mr. Simpson,
a stout man of about 1G stone weight.
This poor fellow met an untimely end.
He had been engaged to teach for Mr.
Dunkin at Muttuma, who was to
meet him at the Temora Homestead.
“Young Harry” brought him across,
but Mr. Dunkin had not yet arrived.
With the object of saving time, Mr.
Simpson set out to meet him, but
lost his way, and perished with thirst
somewhere near Quandary. That was
in 1874.
Mr. Dan Breen had a baker’s shop
at Sebastopol in those days. A bit of
his mud hut may still be seen from
the Junee-road—about two chains
away, on the travelling route. One
of the storekeepers was named Corn-
throft and another was Mrs. Heller-
nan, mother of Mrs. Walter Hefl'er-
nan. There was another storekeeper
named Fletcher, and two bootmakers
named, respectively, Hennessy and
Coyle. There must have been 100
children living at Sebastopol then,
and 300 to 400 adults. The general
outfit of a man was a pair of white
moleskin trousers, a flannel shirt and
a sombrero hat. Braces were un-
known, either a leather belt or a long
sash being worn. Nobody shaved and
very few had their hair cut, except-
ing for an occasional shingle (or basin
trim).
The main sport was kangaroo-ing—
particularly on Sunday. There were
more kangaroos about at that time
than there are sheep at present. Most
of the hunting was done on horse-
back, and as many miners were nov-
ices, there were often riderless hor-
ses. Another favorite pastime was
quoits—the big iron ones made by the
blacksmith. The late Mr. Tally
Edmunds (brother-in-law of ‘Bob’ Mc-
Crone) was the champion quoit-
thrower. Another who was almost
equally good was the late Mr. John
Ryan, father of “Marie Narelle.”
They once had a match for £lO aside,
which “Tally” Edmunds won. “Tally”
was a feeder at the battery. He
died quite recently at Lceton.
Everybody kept goats in those
days. Mrs. Cuffley, at the store, had
quite a flock of them. The kids were
killed for meat and the goats were
milked. When the miners left, cows
were introduced.
The late Mr. Colin Campbell was
manager of the ‘Morning Star” for
several years. When mining ceased
he took up a portion of “Retreat”
Station, where the Dirnaseer Soldier
Settlement was subsequently started.
When he died, his wife married Mr.
Gus. Pike, who died two or three
years ago. Mr. Pike struck a reef
near Clear Hills, in what is now a
closer settlement area. The Pike s
were most hospitable people and there
used to be great picnic gatherings at
their place, with horse-racing in the
day-time and dancing at night. The
dinners and suppers were always on a
most lavish scale and those outings
are still fondly remembered. Mr.
‘Ollie” Pike, by the way, married his
cousin, who was also a Pike. The
McCrone’s were at Sebastopol in
those days—“ Bob”, “Jack” and oth-
ers. “Bob” was a slim fellow and a
notable tree climber—“he could shin
up a gas pipe if needed.”
As there were no wardens or police-
men about Sebastopol, it was neces-
sary to travel to Young to take out
a miners’ right. Mr. Kavanagh first
visited there when a boy of 12—some
58 years ago, and was over there
again quite recently, at the Annual
Sheep Show. He says that there
must have been a tremendous lot of
gold won in the Young district, where
the diggings extended for a length of
15 miles—the claims being very often
close together. The Sebastopol people
got most of their provisions in Young
—and some from Goulburn. Bullock-
drays were the sole means of haulage.
Yet prices wore astonishingly low. A
200-lb. bag of flour cost only £2,
and tobacco only 4s. Cd. per lb. Boots
could be bought at from 7s. Cd. to
10s. _Gd. per pair, or £1 for the big
Wellingtons that a good many miners


wore. Andy Baxter was one of the
bullock teamsters —also the Mackays
—who lived on Congo Creek.
Mr. Thomas Fitzpatrick, senr. (who
for ten years represented the old
Murrumbidgec electorate in , Parlia-
ment) was already at ‘Erin Vale”
when Sebastopol broke out. He had
married a daughter of Mrs. Sprome,
then owner of the Temora Station.
This was somewhere in the sixties.
For many years he ran merino sheep,
increasing his flocks year by year.
He shore as many as 17,000 and
18,000 —all with the blades, by hand.
The Fitzpatrick boys numbered three
—“Tom” John and “Eddie.” The
firstnamed is still at Erin Vale, and
the other two are still living. Eddie
is a doctor.
Speaking of the Heflernan boys,
Mr. Kavanagh observed that there
were six brothers—Walter, Joe,
Harry, Cyril, Eddie and Mick. Sirs.
Heflernan had been a governess at
Combaning. All the sons went on to
the land, three settling at “Clear
Hills,” Mick near Junee, and Joe at
Eurolie. They did well with sheep.
The sisters were Polly (Mrs. Brown),
and Sadie (now in London). The
father owned “Millbank”, which was
subsequently sold for sub-division.
Mr. Ryan, after selling the “Morn-
ing Star” went to reside near Mur-
rumburrah, where he made a lot of
money. Messrs. P. Heflernan, Ryan
and Tom. O’Brien (an uncle of Mr.
Kavanagh) were associated at that
time in the Marshall-McMahon mine,
near Murrurnburrah. Mr. Heflernan
subsequently returned to Clear Hills,
and Mr. Ryan to Sebastopol, where he
ran 5000 sheep. Mr. Tom. O’Brien
selected near Cowabbie Station, going
in for cattle raising. Mr. Ryan Anal-
ly sold to Mr. Comans, who, in turn,
gave way to Messrs. Palmer, Blair,
and Greenlaw. The Symes Bros, (of
Melbourne “Age”) had a share in
Combaning Station, and also in Te-
mora. It was Messrs. Blair and
Symes who cut up the latter into
farming areas —some 040 acres, oth-
ers 320 acres, and as low as 50 acres.
The usual purchase price was £2 2s
per acre. Mr. Ernie Keith was an
original purchaser, and still resides in
the district. Mr. Joe Lee and Mr.
Denis Kavanagh both took up land,
but Mrs. Lees continued to conduct
the store for some years after the
mines closed down.
Mr. John Lees died in the early
days of Temora, and his widow (at
the age of 72) passed way in 1913.
Mr. Denis Kavanagh died the same
year at the age of 76. Mrs. Kavan-
agh died in 1004. After marrying,
Miss Lees, Mr. Harry Kavanagh went
in seriously for sheep breeding. He
got the nucleus of his flock from
Mr. T. Fitzpatrick, senr., and at the
first Temora Show won a three-guinea
prize for the best three hoggetts
shown by owners of 500 sheep. Ho
was also successful in the following
year, and since that time has been a
consistent exhibitor at Temora, Young
of prizes. His biggest flock was 3300,
and elsewhere, having won hundreds
but this year he is shearing only 1400.
Of recent years Mr. Kavanagh has let
some of his land on shares for wheat
farming, and this year has 300 acres
under wheat and 150 under oats.
Our reporter mentioned visiting the
competition crop of Mr. Eddie Mur-
phy two seasons ago, and was inform-
ed that, in spite of set-backs, it went
nine bags to the acre.
Mr. Kavanagh has had two fires go
through his property—the first and
biggest being in 1927. That did not
do him so much damage as the small-
er fire of March, 1929.
Going back again to the raining
days, Mr. Kavanagh remarked that
Sebastopol was in the wild bush, yet
an active community ten years before
Temora town was thought of. Mrs.
Kavanagh’s father (Mr. Lees) had a
contract for carting stone to the
“Morning Star” battery. The miners
then worked eight hours a day for
Bs. 4d. (£2 10s. per week), knocking
off at 1 p.m. Saturday. The two
engine-drivers—Clarke and Mann —
were men with big families, one of
12 children and the other 13. A
family of six or eight was considered
a small family then. After the
“Morning Star” battery closed down,
both the Clarks and Mann families
went to Grenfell, and also the Rich
family. Mr. Denis Kavanagh bought
the Sebastopol Hotel from Mr.
Heflernan and conducted it for sever-
al years. It was delicensed about
five years ago, since when Mr. P. J.
Dwyer has conducted a boarding-
house and soft drinks establishment
there. It is also the local post oflice
and has a public telephone with 11
subscribers on the local exchange. The
existing school is within 200 yards of
the site of the first school of the sev-
enties. Mr. Stan. Fouracre is the
teacher to-day.
Mr. Kavanagh sometimes visited the
Temora homestead as a lad and re-
membered a boundary rider named
Herron, who had a hut near Bagdad,
“Dick” Keith still has the dam known
as the “Boundary Riders’ Dam.”
There was another dam on the Triga-
long Creek, where another boundary-
rider resided. That was at Mr. Andy
Donaldson’s place. Mr. A. Keen
(whose experiences were related a
few weeks ago) was a boundary-rider
on the Temora Station, and "Bill”
Ness and “Tom” Ness (now M.L.A.),
■were both employed there. Mr. Tom.
Fitzpatrick, senr., used to manage for
Mr. McPherson after he bought Te-
mora Station from Mrs. Sproule.
Asked about bushrangers, Mr. Kav-
anagh said that they caused no local
trouble, though everybody knew
about their exploits. Wild horses
were a nuisance and it was necessary
to trap them, which was done by put-
ting a fence around their drinking
places in dry seasons and running
them into a corral, where they were
shot. Sometimes they were skinned,
but oftener they were not. When Mr.
Robertson took up Mimosa, it was
infested with wild horses and kan-
garoos. Mr. Robertson bought from
Mr. Windeyer. There were only two
bark huts on the place at the time.
He had often seen 300 or 400 kanga-
roos yarded and once saw 5000 in a
mob at “Murrulebale.” They were a
terrible nuisance, breaking down
fencing and eating the crops and the
grass. Their skins were not saleable
in those days, otherwise big money
might have been made by killing
them. Some of the “old men” were
enormous—fully eight or nine feet
high. There were also lots of walla-
bies, a few dingoes, and some cats.
Two native bears were once caught at
Sebastopol, but those were the only
ones he ever saw or heard of. Snakes
were numerous in wet years, when the
kangaroo grass would be about three
feet high. That, of course, was be-
fore the rabbits arrived. The kanga-
roo grass provided good summer feed.
Incidentally it was mentioned that
there were some black shepherds em-
ployed in those days, two of whom
camped with their gins near Hando’s.
There were ten aborigines altogeth-
er, some of whom supplied bark for
hut-building at 2s. 6d. per sheet.
Mr. Kavanagh mentioned that Mr.
Harry Foster was at Sebastopol with
his father and brother before the Te-
mora rush set in. It was a most as-
tonishing thing that the gold was not
found here earlier. Lots of miners
used to come across and fossick
around on Sunday in Top-town.
Three Goldspink brothers and Mr.
Harry Waite were very persistent in
their search, but for years they found
nothing—though subsequent events
showed that there was plenty of the
elusive metal near the top of the
ground. Possibly later developments
will show that there is a lot more
still lying about in unsuspected plac-
es.
Mention of the Goldspinks recalled
something of the fights—with bare
fists—that occurred at Sebastopol and
we chuckled to think how a bully met
his Waterloo. It happened one week-
end, when he proceeded to worry an
inoffensive middle-aged man. He be-
gan by pulling the man’s clothing
about. When a mild remonstration
was made he tore the flannel from the
back, of his “victim.” The latter then
retaliated, giving the bully the big-
gest thrashing he had ever experien-
ced. It transpired later that the old
man had previously been a champion
boxer in England, and that he still
had great punching power. The inci-
dent had the effect of relieving the
miners from the unwelcome attentions
of bullies. They chaired the unwilling
champion and treated him royally.
Mr. Harry Kavanagh was for a
time the conveyer of mails from
Cootamundra to Broken Dam. His
father had the contract, and Harry,
mounted on horse-back, with the mail
bags in front of him, would travel
along a bridle-track from Cootamun-
dra, through Dingi Dingi, Gundabind-

Monday. The return journey, over
the same track, would be undertaken
on Wednesday. Mr. Dennis O’Keefe
had a post office on the Narraburra-
road in 1876, the site being still mark-
ed by the remains of an old hotel. On

The years 1870 to 1876 were good
years for the graziers, but there were
very big losses of stock afterwards.

nearly all the cattle died, only a few

Mr. Kavanagh said that there were

the latter said “Thank you,’’ and al-

The History of Pastoral Occupation
Blazing The Trail
The early days of Australia were
marked by varying fortunes, but the
traditions of the British race were
not cast aside in the establishment of
its primary industries and the open-
ing up of the country. Back to the
forties in the last century is a com-
paratively brief span, and the record
of achievements in the intervening
period may be described as a monu-
ment to the resource, the grit, the
adventurousness, and other great
qualities so indispensable to success-
ful colonisation, of the early pioneers
—that gallant band whose members
were never listed. It mattered not
that the landscape was wreathed in
almost impenetrable forest and held
by savage hordes, the pioneers*
watchword was “Advance,” and the
crack of the stockwhip was followed
by the ringing sound of the bushman’s
axe. It was but another exemplifica-
tion of the dictum that the fittest sur-
vive. The unenterprising, non-pro-
gressive native was dispossessed and
driven back and the zone of civilisa-
tion was gradually extended.
The history of settlement is a tale
of excitement and trouble, of gallant
struggles against almost insurmount-
able difficulties, of wrecked fortunes
and thrilling encounters, first with the
blacks and then with the bushrangers.
In those pre-railway days a journey of
300 miles was a formidable undertak-
ing, while transporting supplies in-
volved great loss of time and heavy
expenditure.
In Victoria, when the cry was, “Un-
lock the lands”; “Drive out the squat-
ter!”—a pioneer of the west asked the
very pertinent question, “What
have we done ? Why use this lang-
uage to us ? We were pressed by the
Government to take up block after
block in a hostile portion of the
country, in order to provide money
to meet the growing expenses of Gov-
ernment. We had to risk our lives in
order to open up unexplored land, the
haunt of savage blacks and kanga-
roos.”
It is only too true than in this ma-
terialistic age we are prone to make
light of, and altogether under-esti-
mate, the great work the pioneer
squatter did for Australia. There
died in South Australia a few months
ago a little old man without a penny
to call his own, in his ninetieth year..
Yet no man in Australia deserved a
monument so much as he. When he
was in the heyday of his success,
opening up new provinces for settle-
ment, penetrating the far north—
then a veritable terra incognita—and
expending tens of thousands of pounds
in developing the illimitable pastoral
resources of the unexplored hinter-
land, he was a hero. When the suc-
cessive droughts (and the banks) ov-
erwhelmed him, his army of acquain-
tances and ‘friends” deserted him; and
when the light in that grand old man
burnt out there was none so poor as
to do him reverence. Nevertheless,
Australia owes mucli to C. B. Fisher,
whose name should go down in the
pages of history as Australia’s best
colonist.
Glancing back, the name of James
Tyson stands out prominently. Though
he amassed a vast fortune in his
own peculiar way and was often de-
scribed as a “miser,” yet his record is
a tale of salf-sacrifice. and the his-
torian of the future will describe him
as one who played no mean part in
laying the foundation of successful
interior development. The man who
broke the solitudes of the vast ex-
nanse, unexplored and practically un-
known, far distant from the sea-board,
was something of a hero.
While Tyson was “blazing the
track” in Queensland, George Fife
Angas, souatter and philanthropist,
was founding settlement in the heart
of South Australia. Th.ere are many
others, some of them already forgot-
ten, whose names should be inscribed
on the roll of colonial heroes. There
were those who tried and lost, those
who’ went down in the struggle again-
st the insuperable difficulties. Some
perished by the snear of the savage,
others succumbed for lack of food and
water, or to the attacks of fever.
The present generation, riding thro-
ugh the country in a luxurious rail-
way carriage, rarely pauses to con-
template the great achievements of
the early pioneers—in this State a
long array of names that should be
enshrined in imperishable marble.
To supply anything like a complete
list is not an easv matter. There are
people who hold that Hargreaves was
the greatest man that Australia has
known. No treater fillip could be
given to development in a new country
than the discovery of gold, and when
Hargreaves found the precious metal
the glad tidings spread over the Con-
tinent with lightning rapidity and a
stream of population commenced to
pour in from all noints of the eom-
pass. In the words of t li e late Rob-
ert Lo\yc (afterwards lord Sher-
brooke), “Australia’s future was
then assured.” It meant not onlv
widening the a r ea of settlement, but
the placing of it on a lasting basis.
The two great industries, mining and
squatting, were closely associated and
the pastoralists had reason to hold
Hargreaves in grateful remembrance.
Some Of Our Own
Pioneers
The adventurous few who started
out from Goulburn in the forties in
search of “country” had to suffer pri-
vations and disappointments. Many
returned but a few went on, and were
rewarded at last. Mr. William Mar-
shall was one of the first settlers in
the Temora district, and in the course
of an interesting chat with a repre-
sentative of the Temora “Independ-
ent,” he dwelt on the difficulties as-
sociated with the early pioneering.
In the early fifties the solitudes of
the big stretch of country lying be-
tween Cootamundra and Wyalong
were almost unbroken. No sound was
heard except the “neighing of the
wild horses and the howl of the
dingo.” It was in many respects, said
Mr. Marshall, a wilderness. But the
country appeared to be suitable for
settlement, and it was being gradual-
ly taken up. The veteran said, in an-
swer to a question, that he was the
first owner of Temora Station and
also Buddigower Station. What area
he held he was unable to say, only
that it was “pretty extensive.” Mr.
Marshall, disposed of Temora
Station to Mr. G. Jones, who held it
for some time and then sold the
pronertv to Mr. McPherson.
Mr. Marshall (who was over 80
years of age when interviewed),
spoke from memory, and it may be
said that others, who claim to know,
are quite clear in their minds that
Mr. Sproule preceded Mr. McPherson
in the ownership. “Sproule’s La-
goon” was named after the family,
md during his residence at the fam-
ous old station Mr. Thomas Fitz-
natrick. ex-M.L.A. (Father of Mr. T.
J. A. Fitzpatrick, of Warre Warral),
was associated with him and subse-
ouently married one of his daughters.
The station at that period extended
from Sebastopol to Reefton, and car-
ried something over 50,000 sheep. Mr.
Dennis O’Keeffe, of Duck Creek, was
in the district in the early sixties, and
had a clear recollection of _ many
stirring incidents connected with life
in the bush in those days. The
chief trouble was to get produce, es-
pecially wool, to market. On one oc-
casion, after an extended period of
heavy rain, a wagon loaded with the
golden fleeces was five months in
reaching Goulburn from Merrool! The
place, said Mr. O’Keeffe, was _ alive
with wlid horses, and the aborigines
were about in numbers, especially
along the Bland Creek.
The Blacks and Wild
Horses
Somebody once said of the blacks
of New South Wales that, their’s was
the lowest state of mental prostration
to be met with, devoid of emulation
and curiosity, and without the slight


est Perception of moral distinction. It
would appear that the members of
the "original race” in this district
were no exception to the rule. “They
were lazy and devoid of emulation and
curiosity, but they were not savage
or treacherous in my time,” remarked
an old-time settler. Tribal troubles
sometimes occurred; cattle were
speared and sheep killed, but as civi-
lisation advanced the complaints
about their conduct became less and
less. Mr. O’Keeffe says wild horses
were far more numerous than blacks
in the sixties and down to the seven-
ties. Some of the squatters gave 10/
per head for killing them. T remem-
ber once, ” he said, “climbing an
eminence near Eeclhill, within a few
miles of Temora, and seeing many
mobs of them. They were to be seen
on every hand. They were not at all
a good class, and were a source of an-
noyance to station holders.” Kan-
garoos were also a source of trouble
—in fact in some locality they were as
great a pest as the rabbits are to-
day, and considerable expense was in-
curred in reducing their numbers.
Temora Station
They were bad enough, according to
Mr. O’Keeffe when Mr. McPherson
came into possession of Temora Sta-
tion, in the sixties, hut that gentle-
man had no occasion to repent of his
bargain. After a series of profitable
seasons he sold to Mack and Greeves,
who were succeeded by the Austral-
ian Mortgage and Finance Company,
who held possession for years, and
then sold to Morrison and Brice. The
place changed hands again, this time
the purchasers being Blair and Syme.
As settlement extended the area of
the station was gradually reduced, and
to-day it is but “a shadow of its form-
er self.’ (In 1930 it is occupied by
Mrs. M. Sunderland and beg sons.—
Ed. T. 1.) It was always regarded as
better adapted for the breeding and
rearing of sheep than for the keeping
of cattle. In the sixties and seventies
high prices were often realised for the
station wool, which was in some years
washed —the various creeks and dams
about the nlace being used for the
purpose. Every station in the district
has a history, more or less interesting,
and the vicissitudes of each as relat-
ed by the old hands, are instructive,
and serve at once to emphasise the
vagaries of the climate and the re-
sourcefulness of the managers and
owners.
Quandary Station
Quandary Station was, it is said,
founded by Mr. George Harmon, the
father of Mr. Donald Harmon,
now in Temora. Mr. Harmon came
over from Murrumhurrah in the six-
ties and having taken up about 40,000
acres at Quandary—the old home-
stead is now occupied by Mr. W.
Preston, junr., and is near to the
local railway station—started cattle
raising, which proved a profitable en-
terprise. The station brand of cattle
soon became widely known and much
sought for. Mr. Harmon had a weak-
ness for both the sturdy Durham and
the more aristocratic looking Devon,
both of which found a ready market,
and realised high prices. In sub-tro-
pical climes, among the contingencies
to be allowed for and provided against,
the deadly drought occupies a promi-
nent place. The Quandary herd,
which bad assumed largo proportions,
was once visited by the effects of a
protracted period of dry weather —
the whole landscape was whitened by
the continuous heat —and the fine herd
of cattle was reduced to 54 head.
There is a touch of romance associa-
ted wfith the name of the station. The
legend runs thus :—ln the early six-
ties a party in search of country had
fought their the East as
far as Quandary, where they managed
to lose their bearings. They held a
“council of war,” and each expressed
his opinion as to the locality, but the
opinions differed widely, and, being
puzzled and in doubt as to the course
to take they named the spot “Quand-
ary,” and resolved to go back on their
tracks eastward. In the circumstan-
ces it w'as an appropriate name.
What changes have occurred in half a
century in that district ! The squat-
ter and his cattle have become a tra-
dition, and the big run is now a suc-
cession of prosperous farms rich in
producing power.
Development at Man-
damah
Farther on was East Mandamah Sta-
tion, held by Mr. S. Pawscy, while
Mr. A. Davidson was, even in that
remote period, in possession of Man-
damah Station. There is no part of
the district that has progressed more
than the rich belt of country which
comprised the Mandamah of olden
time. Ariah Station has long been
owned by the Wellmans, but a Mr.
Hanty is credited with being the first
in possession. As far back as 1850
it was owned bv Mr. Wellsley Well-
man and in 1908 was und°r the man-
agement of his brother Mr. Sydney
Wellman. A couple of months later
the old estate passed into the
possession of Mr. G. H. Greene, the
“wheat king,” and in a year or two
the pastures later were converted in-
to profitable cereal producing fields,
thus increasing the area of labor and
adding to the wealth of the State.
Barmedman Station
There seems to be some doubt as to
the original ownership of the Barmed-
man Station. According to one ac-
count, A. G. Jones was the first in
possession and ho was followed by Mr.
McNicol, who sold to Mr. Lachlan
Robertson, owner in 1908. An-
other pioneer, says Mr. McNicol, was
the first master, and that Mr. A. G.
Jones succeeded him. Among the
early settlers at Narraburra was Mr.
Lehane, who is credited with the
breeding of a few good horses at the
station bearing that name.
The Bushrangers
The bushrangers. Ben Hall, Gilbert
and Dunn, were nearly run down at
Nnrraburra. All three were well-
known in the district. Gilbert and
Dunn w T ere employed for some time
by Mr. William Mars,hall, already
mentioned. Gilbert was considered to
be a quiet, inoffensive man. Other
bushrangers frequently paid surprise
visits to the stations. A gang of
five, with Blue Cap at their head, and
including a young blackfellow, once
stuck up Mr. William Marshall and
relieved him of £4O, all the money be
had in the house at the time. But
they missed a draft for something
over £1000; and the veteran point
blank refused to permit them to take
even a nip of the whisky which they
had discovered stowed away in a
room. The police were in hot pursuit
and the gang afterwards fell into
their bands. Alfred Tennyson Dick-
ens, a son of the famous novelist, who
came out in the ill-fated “London ”
the year before she was wrecked, es-
corted the captured Blue Cap to pris-
on, and was warmly congratulated by
the magistrate on bis pluck, and the
noble example he had set the young
colonists.
Interesting Reminiscen-
ces
It is always difficult, where no re-
cords are kept, to obtain accurate in-
formation as to early settlers. It is
said, on pretty good authority, that
Mr. J. D. McKansh, who was ac-
companied by Mr. Valentine Lawler,
was the first to occupy Temora Sta-
tion, & that was in the fifties. In an
interview which our representative
had with Mr. R. J. Lawler, of Young,
during the month, that gentleman said
that in 1847, Mr. J. D. McKansh and
Mr. Valentine Lawler, who owned
Cunningham Creek and Boyeo Sta-
tions, near Murrumhurrah, explored
the country between Wantabadgery
(on the Murrumbidgee) and Narra-
burra and Combaning. The only
place where they found water was at
Sproule’s Lagoon., Hence they were
induced to select Temora Station.
Mr. Valentine Lawler subsequently
withdrew from the property, which
was left in the hands of Mr. McKansh,
who carried it on as a sheep station
under the management of a man nam-
ed Patrick Hourigan, until the year
1855, when tim station was sold to Mr.
Sproule and Mr. W. Marshall. When

this fine property was first selected,
there were few aboriginals on the
place, and McKansh named it “Te-
mora,” after a small property he
owned near the coast. Subsequently,
however, McKansh learned that it
was called by the blacks “Gidgin Gid-
ginbung”—which was the proper name
of Temora Station. Mr. McKansh
sold the property to Marshall and
Sproule in 1855, and they occupied it
until about the year 1868, when it
was taken over by Mr. McPherson,
who stocked it with 50,000 sheep.
Later on he sold it for £50,000 to
Messrs Mack and Greaves.
Combaning Station was taken up by
Mr. J. Comans and his son Michael
(relatives of the Lawler family) in
the year 1846, and they occupied it
until 1880, when they disposed of it
to Messrs Palmer and Blair. Mr.
James Comans was the founder of
Combaning Station, which embraced a
considerable stretch of country. Mi-
mosa Station also embraced a big area
and the first owners were Messrs J.
D. McKansh and Mr. W. O. Windeycr,
a brother of the late Judge Windeycr.
The Robertson Bros, purchased the
station from Mr. Windeyer and held it
for many years.
Several of the in the big
expanse of country of that period
served as “relieving” stations, that is
to say they were only stocked when
pasturage on other stations was
short.
According to Mr. Marshall a visit
to Sydney before the advent of the
“iron horse” in the fifties and sixties,
was regarded as a formidable under-
taking, consequently very few of the
pioneers got beyond Goulburn, then
the “Entrepot” for the whole of the
South-west, and remained so until
Wagga Wagga was formed. “We
thought nothing of a ride across
country from Young to Wagga at
that time,” remarked Mr. Marshall,
and the veteran went on to relate some
of the incidents of the journey, such
as the camping out, the difficulty of
keeping possession of the horses—
there were no habitations, no yards,
no paddocks—the only fences the
Murrumbidgee and the Lachlan. The
bushrangers were not the terrors the
newspapers described them, and Ben
Hall was apparently not as bad as
he was painted. Their conduct, ac-
cording to one of the old settlers
who knew many of them, was regula-
ted by the treatment they received,
and most of them treated women with
the greatest respect. It is said that
Blue Cap was on occasion most chival-
rous, and even Ben Hall was declared
to be a decent sort of fellow, but
possessed of an extraordinary temper,
which was his undoing more, than
once. Blue Can became reckless and
developed a fondness for whisky,
which led him into excesses and
brought about his capture.
There can be no doubt as to this
region being eminently suitable for
sheep breeding, cattle raising, and the
production of wool. In the sixties,
McPherson obtained 2/C per lb. for
his washed wool, while ewes bred at
Temora Station, at Narraburra, and
Mimosa were sought after by the
squatters in other and distant centres
and high prices were paid for them.
Mr. McPherson soon discovered the
adaptability of the soil and climate to.
wheatgrowing, for he once declared at
Goulburn in the sixties, “I can grow
the best wheat and the best wool in
the colony at Temora.” It was, jud-
ged by the latter day developments,
no vain boast. Over half a century
ago one of the squatter’s troubles was
lack of water, and on occasions of
drought losses in stock were heavy.
It was said that long before the dis-
covery of gold a young engineer, who
hailed from Aberdeen, Scotland, ex-
pressed the opinion that dam-sinking
was a “terrible waste of rrood mon-
ey,” and that the only way to get a
permanent water supply was to cut
a channel across the country from the
Murrumbidgee. If he had suggested
the laying of pipes across the great
plateau he might have had a good
claim to rank amongst the successful
prophets, for that would annear to he
the only solution of a problem which
is to-day exercising the minds of en-
gineers. The young Scotsman was
only half a century before his time.

THE HISTORY Of AGRICULTURE IN TEMORA DISTRICT
»pHE AGRICULTURAL HISTORY
of Temora dates back to even an
payable gold. In those early days
earlier period than the discovery of
agriculturists had difficulties to con-
tend with which are undreamt of by
farmers of to-day. Before going into
facts regarding agriculture generally
it will be very interesting to present-
day residents to know the names of
the original selectors who took up land
in this district prior to the rush of
selectors who came along after it was
opened up by the miners. Owing to
the destruction of many records in the
fire in the Exhibition buildings in thn
early eighties many valuable records
have been lost, hut through the kind-
ness of officials of the Lands Depart-
ment we have been able to secure the
following facts concerning all selec-
tions taken up in this district up to
the end of the year 1880.
The three selections shown first in
the list were taken up in connection
with pastoral properties as stations.
It is interesting to note that the late
John Ryan was the father of Marie
Narelle. the well-known concert sing-
er. The third selector was the late
Michael Gomans, the holder of Com-
haning Station in succession to his
father, the late James Gomans, who
took up the run in 1846.
The next on the list is Mr. Dermis
O’Keefe, a native of Ireland, ■who
came to Australia when the State was
nractically a wilderness. His selec
tion was situated at his old home to
the left of the Narrnburra-road which
now leads from Temora. He may, in
justice, claim to he the first repre-
sentative of the small selectors who
nettled independently on the land in
'.his district with a view of making a
home apart from the pastoral hold-
ings. ln_ those early days he engag-
ed in business and afterwards increas-
ed his area and went in for sheep
farming as well, but beyond growing
hay, etc., for his own use, did not ent •
er upon farming as a means of liveli ■
hood till many years later. Like
most of the pioneers, Mr. O’Keefe had
a very hard up-hill fight. He was a
man of remarkable energy and perse-
verance who had gained a knowledge
of pastoral pursuits before settling
down, which has stood well to him
ever since. His case is one of the
very few instances'of success attend-
ing the efforts of a small holder in
working up from an almost purely
pastoral holding to a largo and suc-
cessful farm, combined with grazing.
We remember well on one occasion
when Mr. O’Keefe became almost dis-
heartened during one of the pro-
traded droughts, when he resolved
to sell out and move to another dis-
trict. We said to him at the. time
that the day would come when the
turn of the wheel of fortune would
bring about better times. He did not
sell, and ns the result he had the
Measure of seeme r> remarkable turn
for the better in the, district; and
with it came success to a pioneer who
deserved it as n fitting reward for
the hard struggle he made against
heavy odds in the early days.
fhe ] ? f e Mr. Lees, father of Mrs.
11. M. Havana eh, came next. He took
nt) a Mock, which he used as a eras-
ing area in connection with his busi-
ness as a storekeeper at Sebastopol
Hr. John a small
Mock on file Mernol-rnad. near the
lagoon, on the right of the road, 1J
miles from Temora, which he used
as a home and later for farming.
The next selector on the list, Mr.
John Trefle, was the selector who could
claim to be the pioneer farmer of the
Temora district, without challenging
the rights of any other selector. To
those who may not have known him, it
may be added that he was the father
of the late L. L. Trefle, M.L.A., and
of Alderman C. B. Trefle.
He was a native of
Montreal, Canada, and of French
descent, and came to Victoria in the
roaring gold digging days. In 1875
acting on the advice of the late Mr.
James Gibb, of Berthong Station, he
came overland from Penshurst, Vic-
toria, with his wife and family, to
Cootamundra, the journey taking five
weeks. He took up his first selection
and settled down on Deep Creek,
above the Cootamundra-road, his
first home being about three quarters
of a mile above the spot where he
lived afterwards. There he commen-
ced sheep and wheat farming.
The drought in the years ’76, ’77
and ’7B was the worst period ever
experienced in this part of the State
The stock of Temora Station fell from
70,000 to 5000 during that drought
During this year Mr. Trefle had heavy
losses which nearly ruined him. As
the country was all green and no
fodder of any kind was obtainable ex-
cept that which could be hauled over
bush tracks from Wagga or from be-
yond Cootamundra, the question of
feeding any of the animals except a
few horses was out of the question.
Stores had to be brought those long
distances at enormous cost. Corned
meat at Wagga ran up to 42/ per
lOOlbs., and very poor stuff at that.
It was under these conditions that
Mr. Trefle commenced farming in the
Temora district. The first cultiva-
tion paddock was enclosed with a bush
"roll-over” fence and the green
stumps of the larger trees were left
standing in the paddock. The land-
holders ploughed with single-furrow
ploughs, the grain sown by hand, and
the first harrow used was made en-
tirely of wood—tines and all. Kan-
garoos were plentiful at that time and
did considerable damage to the crops
particularly when ripe. Opossums
also did damage to the crops near
standing trees, but the combined pests
of those days were not so bad as the
rabbit pest of the present day. The
grain crops consisted of wheat and
barley and we re reaped by hand with
hooks and tied with bands made from
the corn. Reaping and binding by
hand cost 20/ per acre in addition to
supplying the reapers with their
board. The threshing was done by
means of a tapered roller with round
pieces of timber pegged on longitudi-
nally to make its surface rough- This
roller was drawn around by horses

over beds of ripe crops spread to
about a foot in thickness. The
threshed grain was shaken out of the
straw by hand with forks and cleaned
through a small American winnower
Later on Mr. Trefle introduced the
first stripper to the district, and it
was such a novelty that men up in
years would ride round the paddock
to watch the machine at work. The
wheat was carted at considerable cost
to Bethungra, and trained from there-
to Cootamundra, the rail freight alone
for that short distance being as high
as the present freight from Temora to
Sydney.
After the goldfield was opened Mr.
Trefle and the other farmers who,
like him, had commenced agriculture,
gave up growing again, except for
seed, and turned their attention to
the production of chaff to supply the
new market which suddenly sprang
into existence in Temora. For a few
years this market absorbed the hay
and chaff of the farmers, but they ov-
erproduced and, as a result, had to re-
vert back to production of grain,
which, until the advent of the railway
to Temora, paid very poorly, owing
to the cost of haulage to the railway.
In the early days of the Temora
goldfield Mr. Trefle ventured into the
milk business and for some time sup-
plied the retailers with the bulk of
the milk used on the field, but a
short, sharp drought came about 1882
and swept off some 60 cows, which
discouraged him from going into the
dairying business again.
The foregoing is a general sketch of
agriculture in this district. The pio-
neers fought an unequal battle again-
st great difficulties. The general
price to be paid in comparatively re-
cent years for grubbing dry timber
was 25/ to 30/ per acre, and the
methods of farming were much more
laborious, slower and more expensive
generally than those of the present
day. Sometimes prices were better,
but they were very patchy. In 1876
we saw a fine crop of wheat delivered
at Scott and Mullally’s flour mill at
Cootamundra at 2/6 per bushel.
To sum up the experiences of the
pioneers it may well be said that
those who stuck to the land were not.
except in very few instances, reward-
ed for their labors. Those who + ool:
up land and sold out to the squat-
ters made money much easier and
with very much more certainty than
those who tried to make the soil pro-
duce wealth for them.
AGRICULTURE FROM 1896 TO
1908
We might now take a view of agri-
culture in this district over the period
when farming had passed out of the
pioneering period into a more pros-
perous and satisfactory time when the
farmers had the good fortune to
have a railway and cheap freights be-
sides a better knowledge of the most
suitable methods to adopt in dealing
with the arable lands of the district
Space will not permit us going into
individual instances of successful
farming, so we can only give a gen-
eral idea of the great success achiev-
ed by the agriculturists during this
later period. For much of this later
information we are indebted to the
records of the Agricultural Depart-
ment, kindly placed at our disposal by
the Under Secretary of that Depart-
ment. The growth of wheat and
hay after the opening of the railway
went ahead by leaps and bounds.
The railway was opened for traffic
about 1895. The statistics shelving
the development of agriculture for Te-
mora are not very reliable beyond
1896, but the data of a reliable na-
tive for the past 14 years is ample
for the purpose of this article. The
following figures speak for them-
selves :
Holdings of one acre and upwards
of wheat cultivation in the parishes ol
Carumbi, Trickett, Dmgi Dingi, Tara,
Gundbindyal, Windeyer, Hurley, Man-
Jamah, Sebastopol, Quandary, Mi-
mosa, Culingerai, Robertson, Gidgin-
gidginbung, and Narraburra, which
made up the Temora police patrol dis-
trict.
THE PRODUCTION OF TEMORA
AND DISTRICT
The following statement shows the
bales of wool, bags of wheat, and
trucks of hay and chaff despatched
from Temora, during the years end-
ing 30th June, 1897 to 1908, inclus-
ive :
In regard to the production, it is
very difficult to ascertain the exact
figures, as a good deal of grain, etc.,
is carried from the various sidings,
and in addition to that there is a fair
local consumption, which must be de-
ducted from the total production,
leaving the above as the actual out-
put from the 'femora railway station,
the figures being from the railway re-
cords. In addition to the above fig-
ures, we give from the return in the
Police Patrol District of 'femora, the
following statistics, the figures to
each period from 1896 to 1908 not yet
being available, but the following
shows the production for the year
1908, as compared with the years 1896
and 1897
In connection with r he above figur-
es, it may be pointed out that the
acreage under cultivation is the real
index to the expansion, as the produc-
tion depends to a very large extent
on the climatic conditions prevailing
when the wheat is being grown. The
above figures show that the average
yield per acre in the year 1908 was
less than six bushels, owing to the
bad season.
this year the patrol was enlarged to present dimensions by the
addition of the portions within the counties of Bourke and Clarendon.

TEMORA DISTRICT HOSPITAL
Hospital’s Early
History
Seeing that the Hospital is to be
the principal beneficiary from the
Back-to-Temora Week, the time is op-
portune to reprint a little
brochure that was issued on the oc-
casion of the laying of the foundation
stone of a new hospital wing on Wed-
nesday, June 3, 1908. That function
was performed by Hon. W. H. Wood,
and was signalised by a special ap-
peal, accompanied by a sketch of Jio
inception and early history of the T,--
mora Hospital. Mr. M. Lazarus was
the president at the time.
The little document reads :
The committee of the Temora Hos-
pital have much pleasure in announ-
cing that on June 3rd it is proposed
to have the foundation stone of the
new wing laid. The Hon. Mr. Wood,
Chief Secretary, has definitely prornis •
ed to visit Temora, and perform the
ceremony. In view of such an im-
portant event in connection wit a the
hospital, the committee consider that
this is an opportune time to give, a
short sketch of the inception and early
history of the institution.
» * » *
August 31, 1880. —A preliminary
meeting was held to consider the es-
tablishment of a hospital in Temora.
Mr. E. Sharpe, first Warden and P.M.,
presided. Those present formed
themselves into a committee to carry
out the object.
* * * *
October 9, 1880. —A first list of
subscribers was published, amounting
to £54. Te highest amount subscrib-
ed was £3 3s. by the Warden
* * ■* *
November 3, 1880. —The committee
announced that a marquee sene from
Sydney was erected, Dr. Ryley being
Government Medical Officer at the
time.
* * * *
November 29, 1880. —A first meet-
ing of contributors to the Temora
Hospital Fund was held, and Mr.
Warden Sharpe was appointed first
chairman and Mr. W. H. L. Bailey,
proprietor of the Temora “Herald"
first secretary. A letter was road
from Dr. Ryley re placing the hospit-
al on a permanent basis, and the
appointment of a paid staff.
» * * *
January 28, 1881. —The first annual
meeting was called by advertisement,
which was for some reason adjourned
until February 4th, when the election
of officers for the year took place. Mr.
Deßoos, senr., the Warden, was elect-
ed president, Mr. S. Kearney secret-
ary, and Dr. O’Connell first medical
officer. The election of a committee
was postponed until the next Tuesday.
when the following were elected, viz.
Messrs. Seymour, Curtin, Ryan, Box-
all, Orbell, Moran, Whelan, Margules,
and H. Woods.
* * * *
May 4th, 1881.—A bonus of £lO
was offered for the best design of a
building of wood, to cost not more
than £350, to form part of a structure,
to be added to on some future occa-
sion.
* ♦ * ♦
May 9th, 1881. —Plans, etc., sub-
mitted by Mr. C. S. Smith were adop-
ted, and the secretary was instructed
to call for tenders, one for £359 be-
ing accepted.
* ♦ » «
From the above resume, it will be
seen that from that unpretentious be-
ginning the present hospital will,
when the proposed additions are com-
pleted, be on a fairly satisfactory
basis, probably equal to many country
hospitals in more important and oil-
er settled districts.
• • * *
The present wooden building, hav-
ing been in existence for less than 27
years, it must be obvious that it is
entirely unsuited for present ■;e-
quirements. The committee have for
some time past been raising monies
for a building fund, and have been
sufficiently successful to warrant them
proceeding with the work at once. The
design, plan and specifications have
been adopted, and tenders have been
called for the erection of the addi-
tions. The tenders not having yet
closed, we cannot state exactly the
amount, but according to our arrange-
ments, we have decided that the
building is to cost about £l7OO or
£lBOO. We are pleased to state that
£1250 will be to the credit of the
fund when the Government grant is
paid over, which will be done when
the tender is accepted. It will thus
be seen that about £6OO will be requir-
ed to finish and furnish the building.
The committee now urgently appeal to
a generous public to contribute a fair
sura by direct donations between the
laying of the foundation stone and the
completion of the building, the obje.'t
being of such a worthy character, that
we feel assured that your sympathy
will be accorded the movement and
that you will kindly contribute to the
fund.
M. LAZARUS, President.
J. DOWNING, Secretary.


Here Before the Gold
Was Found
Tall and erect —still a worker at
83—Mr. Arthur Keen has for 55 years
been a resident of Temora, together
with his busy little wife, who is so
well-known as a Salvationist of 43
years’ membership. They reside in
William-street (between Barmedman
and Trungley roads) and have done so
for more than 50 years.
For some time our reporter has
been wanting to have a talk with the
worthy old couple, and the occasion
offered on Wednesday afternoon,
when for over an hour the conversa-
tion was about old times in Temora,
and the pending celebration of its
jubilee. There were four in the little
party, which included Mrs. C. Bray
(daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Keen),
who was the first child born in Te-
mora, that event dating back to 1877.
Mrs. Bray had been going back
through the diary kept by her grand-
father—Mr. James Mearns—and was
able_ to give a lot of authentic infor-
mation therefrom. Mr. Mearns was a
bootmaker and his book was largely
a record of his transactions with
customers, but sandwiched in between
these were many of those tit-bits in
which a reporter delights.
As a preliminary it might be stated
that Mr. Mearns and two of his sons
arrivfed in Temora as far back as
1872—three years before the Keens.
There were James Mearns (senr.),
John Mearns and James Mearns, junr.
The locality was still in its natural
state, but there was a post office eig.it
miles out on the Trungley-road, known
as “The Rock,” and kept by Mr.
O’Keefe. Mr. Greaves came to Tem-
ora on the 22nd July of 1874 to man-
age Temora Station, and his arrival
was responsible for Mr. Arthur
Keen’s first job in Temora. Mr. and
Mrs. Keen and a five-weeks-old son
arrived from Port Albert, Gippsland,
on the 2!)th April, 1875, rather more
than 55 years ago. Mrs. Keen said
that the first part of the journey--
from Port Albert to Melbourne—was
made by boat. The train was taken
from Melbourne to Wodonga and a
Cobb Coach from Wodonga to Wagga,
where the Mearns brothers were
awaiting with their private conveyan-
ce. On arrival Mr. Keen took a* job
on Temora Station at £5O per annum
and rations.
In August of 1875 Mr. John Mearns
(brother of Mrs. Keen) selected land
at Trigalong. In. January of 1879 his
first load of wheat was taken from
Temora to the Wagga flour mill. In
1880 Mr. Mearns sold a load of wheat
to Mr. Storey, of Junee, at 4/- per
bushel. Just prior to this time, Mr.
Deutscher (father of Mr. Oscar East
Deutscher) selected 040 acres of
land near the Trungley-road. The
surveyor was Mr. Tozer. The land
was subsequently well-mined, Mr.
Deutscher drawing a considerable
sum weekly in rentals. Mr. Deal-
scher was at that time the recognis-
ed “Mayor of Temora” and • made
many trips to Sydney at his own ex-
pense for the purpose of obtaining
Government assistance for settlers
and miners-
On leaving Temora Station, Mr. and
Mrs. Keen lived for a time at Curry’s
Hill, then shifted to their present
place of abode. Soon after their ar-
rival the gold-rush broke out. Mrs
Keen remembers it well. One oi
her children was born at the time.
When she went to bed the silence of
the bush was practically unbroken;
when she got up again a few days
later, there were hundreds of tents
stretching along Trungley-road and
thousands of miners using the pick
and shovel—searching for gold. As
giving some idea of the crowd, Mrs.
Keen remarked that it was not pos-
sible for some days to get into the
post office, which was down ; n
“Thom’s paddock” alongside the police
station. The place was simply
thronged all day long. When a miner
died on the 11th October, 1880, his
funeral was attended by at least 2000
miners.
The long line of tents stretched
about three miles east and west, and
everywhere hotels were dotted around.
Mr. Keen helped Charlie Deutscher
to build the first hotel. A Mr. Wm.
Small kept the Royal Hotel near their
house and his father had one on the
Trungley-road. Mr. Boxsell also had
a hotel and he conducted the Lower
Town post office. There was also
a post office in Upper Temora.
Asked if he had any luck with his
digging, Mr. Keen said that there
were three years of drought at the
start and no water with which to
wash his dirt. The people who were
getting nuggets from the reef in Up-
per Temora were alright, but he was
not one of the fortunate ones.
Asked how she got her water sun-
ply, Mrs. Keen said that it was ca-t-
-ed about seven miles. It wasn’t very
good water, but had to be skimmed,
strained, and boiled before using.
Most of the food supplies were ob-
tained from Wagga in those days, the
journey being made ouite as quickly
as that to Cootamundra, which occu-
pied two days each way, unless one
was fortunate enough to follow in
the tracks of someone who had just
cut down the scrub. Mr. Keen tra-
velled about a fair bit at first, taking
travellers round with their samples
He also carted goods to and from
Goulburn when it was the terminus of
the railway, and took a grocer’s sh-.p
and a dwelling from Temora to that
place.
In 1888 Mr. John Mearn’s farm was
offered for sale at Deitz’s and was
bought in for £2 4s. Od. per acre. Mr.
Deutscher also offered his property,
but there was no sale, the best offer
being £5 17s. 6d., which the seller
considered too low. In the “Indepen-
dent” of 25th April, 1888, the editor
(Mr. Edgerton), wrote thus concern-
ing Mr. John Mearns’ departure :
“One of the first Teraora < select-
ors, Mr. John Mearns, of Trigalonu
Creek, has left for Cobar. He was
originally a pioneer miner in the
celebrated Murray’s P.C., from
which he sold out for a considerable
sum. Mr. Mearns is a man of con-
siderable energy, much dash and
strict commercial probity and will
succeed anywhere.. He was a ’■evi-
dent here for 15 years, and triage
many friends.”
It has already been mentioned that
Mr. Mearns, senr., was a boot-maker.
He used to take skins to Young or
to Wagga, and get leather in ex-
change. A diary entry of 34 Sen-
tember, '74, states :
“I went with James to the Lamb-
ing Flats (Young) for leather. He
went in on the third and came out
on the 4th. On the sth we were
at Grogan, and came on a creek
that we could not cross. James
swum his horse across and also
took mine, but. T had to remain on
the other side till next day.”
The diary also contains references to
shearing trips out to Mimosa and to
Fitzpatrick’s. Shearing rates woje
£1 ner hundred in those days.
Talking conversationally, Mr. and
Mrs. Keen and Mrs. Brav mentioned
several old names, including those of
Mr. W. Nixon. Mr. Bob. McCrone, Mr.
Jack Schruhm, Mesdames Smith.
Folkes. Crowley. Hickey. Kelly and
Mr. W. H. Tubman—whose father
was a butcher-
Mrs. Keen spoke of early church
activities. The first place of worship
was a gospel hall situated just near
their home, where services were con-
ducted by a local nreacher named
Jordan —father of Mr. Rube Jordan.
The Methodist Church was erected
about 1885. Mr. Deutscher gave the
land and everybody subscribed funds.
An old-time tea meeting was held ~o
celebrate the church opening.
As already mentioned, for 43 years
Mrs. Keen has been associated with
the Temora corps of the Salvation
Army. Some years before that a
Salvationist named James came from
Sydney, getting supplies of the “War
Cry” from Cootamundra, and selling
them to the miners. Major Jefferies
was divisional commander, and Capt.
Templeton the first officer to be sta-
tioned in Temora. Mrs. Keen’s two
brothers were also Salvationists, and
shared in the stirring times when
stones and eggs were cast at Army
processions, and deliberate attempts
were made to break up the meetings.
Mrs. Brav recalled that there was a
private school near Deutscher’s dam,
in the days before she was old enough
to attend. That was conducted by
Mrs. O’Rourke and Miss McDowell.
There was subsequently a public
school (comprising three tents) about


where, the hospital now stands. Mr.
Swann was head teacher and Miss
Devlin sewing mistress. Fever broke
out while the school was there, and
a transfer of scholars was made co
the present site,. where other tents
were provided. A Mr. Harris had a
private school for some time in a
stringy-bark building near Deutsch-
er’s dam—close to the post office and
police station. Mrs. Bray’s recollec-
tion was that the first public school
teacher was Mr. Swann, the second
Mr. Davies and the third Mr. Vivian.
The two named first are dead, but
she is not sure about Mr. Vivian
Mention of his name caused Mrs. Keen
to remark that the clock still ticking
on the mantelpiece was purchased 36
years ago at Mr. Vivian’s sale.
Mr. Keen mentioned how the first
hotel that he built had a floor of
squared pine-blocks and a roof of
shingles. He also recalled that soon
after selecting his block Mr. Deut-
scher put down a--big. dam in the
paddock known as “Thom’s.” The
spoil from the dam was used in mak-
ing a daub and plaster dwelling. In-
cidentally it was stated that
used to be a big battery close to the
home of the Keen s—almost opposite
the show ground gates. That worked
full time for some years, and left a
big heap of sand. In later years this
was cyanided and most of the sand
ultimately used in connection with
town buildings. Portions of -u the
machinery were scattered about the
site for years, but have now disap-
peared, though the old ramp is still
visible.
A question was asked as to whether
any attempt was made at street
lighting in the early days. The an-
swer was that the streets were prac-
tically unlit until the electric light
scheme was adopted—excepting tha"
the corner hotels near the Bank >'f
New South Wales and the A.J’.S.
Bank were pretty well illuminated.
Rising up and going to the window,
Mr. Keen remarked, reminiscently,
“The first street light I saw in Fe-
mora- was on that opposite corner
where there was a little store. It
was a candle in a bottle!” “In those
days (explained Mrs. Keen) we, were
rio’ht in the business centre. More-
people lived here than resided up in-
town. There were houses and hotels
and stores as far down as the China-
men’s place.”
The eldest son of Mr. Keen
was born in- Gippsland in 1875, and
. was brought here when a baby in
arms. Others of the family are Rev.
Sylvester Keen (now a Methodist-
minister-in New Zealand). Frances
(Mrs. C. Bray). Arthur, .James. Ed-
ward, Edith (Mrs. C^ 1 ■ ' V"; v ,
Bertha (Mrs. Adjt. Sheldrick, and
Ray Keen, who has a milk-round in
Temora.
Mr. and Mrs. Keen are still hale
and hearty. We trust that they long
may remain so, and that they will
have the opportunity this week of
meeting many visiting old-timers, who
also will talk of pioneering days.
TEMORA
Euphony won for you a visionary name—
When peace-loving Celts to your verdant meadows came ;
From following a moonpath, mystic and serene.
They, as wandering nomads, found your pastures green.
Rested they from their prolonged journeyings, and here
Saw Health and Hope, with joyful promise, re-appear.
Pictured their children’s children, midst flocks and herds,
Crooning sweet love-tales in rich and honeyed words.
The Muses sang sweetly in their responsive ears.
They longed and longed to name you their s for future years :
They sighed ! In fancy saw again their natal shore,
Pictured the rough rocks, where the surging billows roar ;
Fancy’s vision saw not here such tumultuous realm.
But a patriot's love can ever guil I the helm,
Traced they their legendery lore for fairy sound,
So thus to Scotia’s coast, where melodies abound,
They impaled thee, Temora, on a shaft sublime,
To the new land’s history, as a worthier clime,
From whence might spring a new race, loyally supreme,
Whose mighty deeds should emulate their poet’s dream.

Mrs. J. L. Trefle
who up till about 23 years ago was a prominent
resident of Temora, where her late husband (Hon.
J. L. Trefle) was associated with the present pro-
prietor of the “Independent.” It will be remem-
bered by old residents that Mrs. Trefle took an
active part in charitable, church and social mat-
ters. Since her departure from Temora she has
been residing in Waverley and her name has fre-
quently appeared in reports of various charitable
and church functions. She is always happy when
doing something for the alleviation of those in ne-
cessitous circumstances. Unfortunately, the health
of Mrs. Trefle has been indifferent of late, other-
wise she would have been among the many for-
mer residents who will return for the big week’s
celebrations.
THIS SOUVENIR
was set up and printed by the Temora “Independ-
ent,” half the proceeds from the sale of which are
to be devoted to the funds of the District Hospital.


Women’s Organisations
COUNTRY WOMEN’S ASSOCI-
ATION
A handful of enthusiasts foregath-
ered at the Country Club in Sydney
during Easter week of 1922. These
ladies resolved to found a society cal-
culated to benefit the woman on the
land and foster the spirit of mutual
help. A secretary was appointed,
who promptly got to work and circu-
larized numerous women residing in
various parts of the State and includ-
ing residents of Temora, who in their
turn, sought the assistance of their
then Mayor—Alderman Callaghan—
who placed the Council Chambers at
their disposal and called a public
meeting of ladies for the sth August
of that year. Twenty ladies respond-
ed to the invitation to be present,
and, after hearing details of the pro-
posal, unanimously decided to found
a branch of the C.W.A. at Temora—
so that the sth August next will be
the ninth birthday of the splendid
institution which has done so much
for public benefit locally and
which was the sixth branch to come
into existence in the country. Now
we have 225 branches in N.S.W.—
apart from those in other States.
Of the local branch, the original
executive included Mrs. A. A. Prater,
of “Burlington,” Little Narraburra,
who held office as president for six
consecutive years, and since then has
filled the position of patron. Mrs.
Wm. Giles, of “Delavan,” Temora, fol-
lowed and held office for the year
1929, whilst the present occupant of
the presidential chair—Mrs. J. B.
Mackinlay, of “Linton,” Pucawan, has
held office for 1930 and 1931. The ori-
ginal and organising secretary of the
movement was Mrs. H. C. Stening
(wife of the present Chief Inspector
of Agriculture), who held office until
January, 1924. Mrs. W. Pearson fol-
lowed and gave faithful service until
ill-health compelled her to retire in
1929. Mrs. Hurtle Denyer, of Te-
mora, has since given a wonderful
amount of attention to the secretarial
duties of the branch. During her
term of office a fully-equipped Baby
Health Centre has been ushered into
existence, with a visiting Clinic
Nurse on each Thursday.
Those who had filled office as hon-
orary treasurers during that period
include Mrs. Hassall (3 months), Mrs.
H. Barry and Miss St. Smith, con-
jointly for almost six years; Mrs.
Stafford Millar for almost two years;
and Mrs. James Cooney during the
past six months. These ladies have
seen over £7OO pass through their
hands for the benefit of the Temora
and District Hospital, whilst the
C.W.A. Benevolent Fund has absorb-
ed quite a large amount of money.
The School of Arts received £5O as
a gift towards the building fund in
1925, as the result of a flower show
conducted by the C.W.A. For the
first six years of their operations the
Executive of the C.W.A. sent a par-
cel of new winter garments each year
to the Royal Alexander Children’s
Hospital. During the last three years
quantities of clothing, new and second
hand, have been locally distributed
by the Benevolent Committee of the
C.W.A. and quite a number of
mothers and children have been as-
sisted financially and otherwise to
take seaside holidays at Keera House.
During the year 1927 a Ladies’
Auxiliary (with separate entity) was
founded by the C.W.A. and since then
this auxiliary has given wonderful
service to the district Hospital in
various ways and mainly under the
direction of the Hon. Secretary, Mrs.
Covers and Mesdames Wheatley,
Thomas, Davies and Pearson, assisted
by their friends.
The offices of vice-presidents of
the C.W.A. have been held during
different years by Mesdames Barry,
Giles, Harmon, Davies, J. Cooney,
Wheatley, Kimble, Mackinlay, Pear-
son, R. Keith, A. N. Denyer and Miss-
es Kook and St. Smith. It is note-
worthy that of the names of the
original Executive in 1922, only two
remain on the membership roll—the
others having either left the district
or retired from the Association, but
still the institution grows and flourish-
es like a green bay tree.
The residents of Temora have had
many reasons to be proud of its
women’s organisations, viz., the
C.W.A. and the Hospital Auxiliary.
Mrs. A. A. Prater
PATRON OF C.W.A.
Mrs. A. A. Prater, of “Burlington,”
came into prominence during the
Great War, when, as the president of
the Narraburra branch of the Red
Cross Society,, she organised some
wonderfully successful stunts for the
War Chest and similar funds and at
the same time established herself as
a leader of her sex. It is small won-
der, then, that when, in 1922, the
Country Women’s Association sprung
into existence, she should have been
elected president. She held office for
six successive years, retiring in 1928,
when she was made patron of the
local branch and which honorary ap-
pointment she still holds. She is
the wife of Councillor Prater, of the
Narraburra Shire Council, and as
such had the honor conferred upon
her of formally opening the model
road known as Prater’s Speedway.
Mrs. J. B. Mackinlay
PRESIDENT C.W.A.
“Linton,” Pucawan, is the home of
the present occupant of the president-
ial chair of the C.W.A.—this being
her second year of office. Like her
predecessor, she has the cause of the
Woman on the Land truly at heart.
Mrs. Mackinlay is a speaker of no
mean merit and has done much to
further the cause of the C.W.A. in
Temora. The existing Baby Health
Centre was established during her
regime, and, prior to filling the chair,
Mrs. Mackinlay expended a good
deal of time and energy in collecting
funds for the establishment of the
Clinic—beside which she made, per-
sonal calls on the Director of Public
Health in order to urge Temora’s
claim to such an institution. She has
also been quite a right hand support
to her husband in his efforts to fur-
ther the cause of the farmers of this
district.
THE PIONEERS
Ohl they were lion-hearted
Who gave our country birth;
Stout sons, of stoutest fathers bom,
Prom all the lands of earth.
Those great old days are over,
And vanished is the scene;
The “stations” are dismantled,
The camping grounds are green.
The flaunting flag of progress
Is in the light unfurled; ‘
The Mighty Bush, with iron rails,
Is tethered to the World.

WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE
NAME TEMORA ?
the poet Ossia’n, son of Fingal, ex-
claims in the finale ;
“The mighty are dispersed at
Temora. . . . Soft be thy rest in
thy cave, O chief of Erin’s wars.
. . . Braegela will not hope for
thy return, etc., etc.”
Thus it is evident that this chief
went abroad from his beloved and
native Isle to fight in another count-
ry, and that country was undoubtedly
the west coast of Scotland, where the
country folk living on the rugged
coast still speak of their district as
“Temora, or the land near the roll-
ing waters”—just in the same way
that Greeks speak of the Hellespont,
which we know as the Dardanelles.
Just where did that poetic name
emanate from ! Some say from Ire-
land ; but why Ireland any more than
Scotland ? The writer is of vne
opinion that the word is Highland
Gaelic, meaning “rolling waters.”
There are still a few Australians who
will remember odd words from the
Highland tongue of their parents, and
when the word—or rather name—was
applied to the rugged west coast of
Scotland. Then again Mr. McKansn,
who is said to have named his landed
property on the South Coast of New
South Wales, Temora, & then carried
the name to his local estate, was
hardly an Irishman—perhaps a Scot
fully familiar with Gaelic folk lore.
It must be remembered that the sta-
tion property on Wallidilly Creek ar.d
Trungley-road bore the name “Tem-
ora” long years before gold was dis-
covered in the district, and for yeais
before the gold fever lured the mi-
grants from Ireland and elsewhere to
try their luck as prospectors, though
it was during the mining days that
the township, which sprang up along
the gold lead, became registered as
the postal town of Temora, and nam-
ed so after the station property, from
whence meat supplies were being ob-
tained for the mining population. Per-
haps the contention that the name is
Scottish may be regarded as unortho-
dox. Perhaps also the writer may be
acclaimed quite unorthodox in assert-
ing that St. Patrick was a Scotsman.
Yet why not ? Seeing that the il-
lustrious saint first saw the light of
day on the little Isle of lona —a Scot-
tish possession. St. Patrick was bid-
ding fair towards his manhood when
he made hig way across the waters
to the land oi which he was destined
to become the patron saint.
That the name “Temora” existed
only in legend has been established
fully and in the folk lore, as tradi-
tion has given to us, referred to the
rolling torrent which formed the
strait between the coasts of Scotland
and Ireland, the land on either coast
being also called Temora in fahy
story, seeing that the subject name is
Highland Gaelic for rolling water,
■then the application is at once discern-
ible. Again, the poems of Ossian
have been quoted as the source from
which the name had emanated. Tn;s
is correct, but it is necessary tc re-
member that only a limited number
of the various cantos have been re-
surrected from the legends of tre
past, and these collections were made
in 1759 by a schoolmaster named
John Macpherson, who obtained the
whole of his data of ancient folk lore
in Scotland (not Ireland).
In the year, 1760, he published
“Temora, An Epic Poem in Eight
Books.” The whole trend of the
story goes to suggest that the mighty
chiefs of Ireland crossed into Scot-
land to wage war on their enemies.

field of the gallant chief, Cuthullin,

A Sleeper-Cutter’s
Memories
(Reprinted from “Independent.”)
Mr. Frank Stranger knew this dis-
trict before there was any Temora,
having arrived here in 1873, when Mr.
Keane took up the Narraburra Sta-
tion. He was, however, of a roving
disposition and began sleeper-cutting
at Bethungra in 1875, when the ter-
minus of the Sydney-Albury line was
still at Binalong. He afterwards fol-
lowed up the railway line as it was
extended. He was cutting sleepers
here in 1885 and remained for three
years in the district. Subsequently
he wandered away into other timber-
ed districts, _ but recently returned
(with his wife) to Temora, where a
son has for some time been employed
by Mr, George Aslin.
Mr. Stranger called in the other
day for a chat, stating that he was
very interested in the articles being-
written by Mr. Watson Steel, whom he
knew in the early eighties. Mr.
Stranger is a native of Albury and
has moved about between Mt.
Kosciusko and Lake Cargelligo, and as
far west as Narandera. He came to
Temo'ra in 1885 as a sleeper-cutter
under contract to the Government.
The sleepers he cut were delivered by
horse-team or bullock-team to Old
Junee, Mr. George Ryan doing most
of the carting. The late Fred.
Bullock did some ,also Wiles Smith
(who had the first tractor), Merefield
and others.
Since returning to Temora the only
old-timer Mr. Stranger has met is Mr.
A. Boxall. He however, recalls Mr.
McCaine, saddler and hotelkeeper,
“Bill” Talbot (Court House Hotel),
and Mr. Pincheon, chemist, with whom
he was associated in starting the first
sports ground. The present recrea-
tion ground was then called “The
Sleeper-cutters’ Sports Ground.” Mr.
Stranger also knew Joe Deitz and
Tom Shelley (hotelkeepers) and re-
membered Byron’s Hotel—afterwards
Boxill’s—the Queensland. He also
recalled Sawbridge’s Railway Hotel.
One hotelkeeper did sleeper-cutting in
the day-time and another was a mec-
hanic, though a bar-tender at night.
He knew Mr. Steel as assistant at
the Bank of New South Wales and
also knew Mr. Thompson, who suc-
ceeded Mr. Kendall as manager. Mr
Thompson had a striking figure and
wore a long silky beard.
Mr. Stranger did most of his cut-
ting on the Broken Dam road, to-
wards Barmedman, but some at Mi-
mosa (near Porter’s) and some at
Bagdad. He also cut over near Coola-
mon, Ganmain and as far south as
Wagga. The season 1887 (he recall-
ed) was a verv wet one and he could
not get his sleepers carted away.
Just before that wet year he searched
for sleepers cut in 1877 and found
most of them intact—even though a
bush fire had passed through in the
meantime. A good lot of sleepers
were salvaged and taken to Junee
and accepted.
Mr. Stranger, looking out on to the
asphalted thoroughfare, observed, re-
miniscently, that it was a much bet-
ter road than it used to be forty-five
years ago, when it was exceedingly
dusty in dry weather and very boggy
in a wet season.
Mr. Stranger says that he was one
of fhe committee that arranged Te-
mora s first show in 1886. This was
held on “The Sleeper Cutters’ Sports
Ground.” Messrs Cartwright and
Kavanagh, Talbot and Pincheon he
thought were associated with that
show. After the first one a move was
made to the present site.
Mr. Stranger is pleased to know
that the Jubilee of Temora is to be
fittingly celebrated next March and
hopes to be here to welcome back the
old-timers.
Speaking further of his experience-
in the early days of Temora. Mr.
Frank _ Stranger referred to the.
ploughing matches that were held an-
nually at Conlamon. He remember-
ed that one was won by Mr. John
Louis Trefle—afterwards proprietor of.
the “Independent” and still later Min-
ister for Lands. He also recallec
that the Lawrence brothers, of Win-
chendonvale, were champions with the
single-furrow plough, striking a per-
fectly straight line and turning over
an even symmetrical furrow, fnci-
dentally Mr. Stranger mentioned that
some of the carters of sleepers had
the alternative of delivery at either
Coolamon or Junee
Tommy Ah Tack was a blacksmith
in Temora in those early days and
had a smithy somewhere about where
the “Independent” office now stands.
Tom Tucker was the butcher and ran
his cart out to the sleeper-cutters'
camps. As a rule there were 10 to
12 men in a camp and sometime.-
there were ten different camps oner-
ating in the district. Possibly the
peak number was 150 Most of the
timber cut was ironbark. When
camped near Porter’s (on a creek
about three miles out from town),
young Porter used to cart water to
the camp. A second camp was situa-
ted between Porter’s and Rand, the
carrier, on the Broken Dam road.
That thoroughfare, of course, was lit-
tie more than a bridle-track at the
time. Sleeper-cutting extended about
six miles along the road. There was
a camp as far out as “Beaconsfield,”
and one near Gagie’s farm, on the
Mimosa side.
Referring to the first local sports
meeting, Mr. Stranger observed that
Mr. McCaine and himself canvassed
for money for the prizes and met with
a good response. They staged a £3O
handicap and a £lO hurdle race. The
hospital benefitted to the extent of
£l2. Later on, Tom Tucker and
others organised a bigger meeting
with a £lOO handicap. The winner
was Sam Ecclestone, some of whose
family are still in Temora.
Mr. Stranger tells with a good deal
of retrospective satisfaction how the
sleeper-cutters “cleaned up” a coto-
rie of bookmakers who came across
from Wagga with the intention of
“running the town.” A hefty-fighter
named McDevitt was leader of the
cutters who soon brought discomfit-
ure to the invaders. The “Southern
Cross” (Junee), referring to the
fracas, remarked, “The sleepers mis-
took the Wagga men for ironbark
trees and cut them up.”
As a final note, Mr. Stranger re-
marked that over 45 years ago Mr.
Christy Hensler had a garden and
vineyard near the Golden Gate dam
extending towards the Junee-road.
The old man made his “pile” in this
district, but died on the way home
to Germany His orchard and vine-
yard were subsequently uprooted.

Temora To-Day
The Temora of 1931, though tem-
porarily under a cloud because of low
wheat and wool prices, is a substan-
tial town, with five flourishing banks,
all splendidly housed, and a main
business street to be proud of. It
has a daily train service (Sundays ex-
cepted) to and from Sydney and is
an important railway centre, serving
the Hillston-Griffith, West Wyalong-
Cargelligo and Barmedman-Rankin
Springs lines. In the Temora railway
yard there are two five-bin silos, cap-
able of holding 500,000 bushels and
there are other silos at Pucawan,
Combaning, Gidginbung and Reef ton,
while Quandary and Springdale are
big receiving stations. Last year
there were 100,000 acres in crop in
the Temora police district and the
yield must have approximated two
million bags.
The Temora Experiment Farm,
under the direction of Mr. Leonard
Judd, does excellent experimental
work, both with wheat and oats, lu-
cerne and other pastures, and with
British Leicester sheep. The Temora
P.A.H. and I. Association also had
done a great deal to bring about first-
class methods of cultural practice,
(both by its annual Shows and field
competitions) and the district has
won several Royal Cup Champion-
ships for growing wheat crops. Flour
mills, brick works, chaff mills and ice
works are among the local industries.
There are eleven hotels in Temora
and several private boarding houses.
Churches number seven—Catholic,
Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist,
Baptist, Lutheran and Salvation
Army.'. The town school has reached
the status of an Intermediate High
School and has both Intermediate and
Leaving Certificate classes. The
staff is an excellent one. Mr. M. C. I.
Levy, B.A is principal, and has a
comprehensive staff of secondary
teachers, who conduct first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth year classes.
The' school has gained successes with
Intermediate and Leaving Certificate
candidates. Another educational in-
stitution is the Tutorial Class, con-
ducted by Mr. M. C. I. Levy, B.A.
The Sisters of St. Joseph’s also con-
duct a large school with a varied cur-
riculum and there are several small
schools in the environs. Hostels for
girls and for boys have been estab-
lished and the Parents r.:. ' CKI.-cns’
Association attached to the town
school has a membership of over 200.
Rev. H. J. Hillman, 8.A., is presi-
dent and Mr. A. Nixon secretary.
There are several strong lodges,
notably, Masonic, L.0.L., H.A.C.8.5.,
A.H.C. Guild, M.U.1.0.0.F.,
G.U.1.0.0.F., 1.0.0. F. and P.F.A.
The School of Arts is a flourishing
institution and there is a strong
Choral Society, while sporting clubs
are numerous, including cricket clubs,
the champion Rugby League team of
the South, a strong Soccer Club, ten-
nis and golf clubs, and cycling, motor
cycling and athletic sports clubs,
hockey, pigeon homing and Rifle
Clubs.
The town has a population of 3800
and is splendidly lighted by electricity
conveyed by the Public Works Depart-
ment’s Burrinjuck Scheme. The long-
awaited South-Western Tablelands
Water Supply Scheme seems within
meagurable distance of completion,
pipes having been laid as far as
Cootamundra.
Temora is in the Riverina Federal
Electorate and has Mr. W. W. Killen,
M.H.R., as its member. The State
electorate of Temora is represented in

sembly by Mr. Hugh Main, a district
resident. The Police Magistrate
(Mr. E. Harrison) visits fortnightly
from Cootamundra and there are up-
wards of 20 Justices of the Peace.
Mr. J. Byrne is the Clerk of Petty
Sessions and Crown Lands Agent and
fills a dozen other official positions,
with the assistance of Mr. W. Mc-
Andrew. Other officials include Mr.
J. A. Bradley, Coroner; Police Ser-
geant Mr. Peter Stewart (with five

Miner, Newsagent, and
Public-Spirited Man
ALD. W. NIXON INTERVIEWED
When, a few months ago, a repre-
sentative of the “Independent’ ’inter-
viewed several old-timers, he found
most of them saying: “We remember
Bill Nixon when he was a miner and
also when he started his first station-
ery shop. He has been longer in
business than any man here, and
could tell you a great deal that is
interesting about the early days.”
The matter of an interview was
broached on several occasions but it
was not until recently that we were
able to get a detailed statement of
the varied activities of Aid. Nixon, ex-
tending over 50 years.
“It was about the end of March of
1881 that I arrived in Temora (he
said). I spent the first couple of
weeks on the field, but water was very
scarce and insufficient for puddling
purposes, or even domestic use.
There Was very little doing, excepting
that some claim-holders were raising
wash-dirt. Hearing of a vacant po-
sition at Cootamundra, and believing
that “a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush,” I went to Coota for
three months, until winter came on.
Light rains fell in June and July, by
which time a few water shafts had
been sunk and equipped for puddling
purposes.
“So you came back?”
“Yes! I came back. My first ven-
ture was in a small surface show on
the slope west of the Mother Shipton
Hill. 1 bought in cheap and got my
cash back and good wages as well by
the end of the first week.
MOTHER SHIPTON LEAD
DISCOVERED
“About the 10th September, 1881,
while cuttinqr a water-race from the
Mother Shipton Hill to our surface
claim my mate (James Perman) and
I discovered the famous Mother Ship-
ton leader, which in less than 24
hours gave a sack-full of splendid
gold specimens. These were dollied by
the shareholders and the gold was
conveyed by them to Sydney where it
was sold to the mint for £2OOO.
“That was a good start!”
“Yes it was. But though the mine
opened up so well, it proved very
patchy and the original shareholders
got very poor returns. Personally, I
sold my interest at a low figure to
take over an alluvial proposition in
Foster’s celebrated alluvial claim at
Lower Temora.
DRIVEN OUT BY THE WATER
“Did you do well in Lower Temora.”
“I worked there till January of 1885,
when the drought broke up properly,
Starting on the 25th January, it rain-
ed continuously for 36 hours, by
which time no less than seven inches
of rain had fallen. Every claim be-
tween Ponting’s Bristol Hotel and
Grecian Bend was flooded out. Not
a miner could enter his old workings
again and profitable operations came
to a dead-end. Some parties sank on
the edges of the old lead, but none
were successful. Our party appeared
to be more energetic and more hope-
ful than the others and kept on keep-
ing on, sinking some 13 or 14 new
shafts. Not one of them bottomed on
payable dirt.
‘That was a disappointment!”
“Yes. Mining under such condi-
tions was no good to a married man,
so I decided to turn my energies in
another direction. Hearing that a
shop and residence were available
opposite where the Empire Hotel
now stands, I secured them and
started a newsagency and stationery
business.
PUBLIC ACTIVITIES
“That was after your entry into
the public activities of the town?”
“Yes! In 1884, while still a miner,
I was appointed Secretary of the Te-
mora District Hospital, which then
MR. W. NIXON
consisted of a tall weather-board
structure with male and female
wards, containing accommodation for
only six patients, a small double bed-
room for the matron and warder, a
sitting-room, kitchen and pantry.
This scanty accommodation served the
town for several years.
“You served a long time on the
hospital committee?”
“Yes, my association with the hos-
pital was continuous from 1884 till
about 1922—first as secretary and
afterwards as a committee-man.
“How was the stationery business
progressing?”
“It was not before I purchased, at
a low price, the stationery business of
Mr. Eugene Perrott, next to the site
of the present Tattersall’s Hotel.
Later on, seeing a chance for further
advancement, I secured a seven-years’
lease of two adjoining shops on the
site now occupied by Messrs. Miller
and James. I made the two shops in-
to one and put in what was consider-
ed in those days a large and attrac-
tive front. It was not before my
business began to improve. In those
days a stationer could grip and hold
quite a number of subsidiary lines,
such as jewellery, patent medicines,
etc., and I made the most of the op-
portunities in that direction.
“Did you still find time for public
activities ? ”
“After starting business I joined up
with a Progress Association. That
was before the advent of the Muni
cipal Council and our elections (which
took place annually) caused no little
excitement among those interested in
the town’s advancement. We took up
many schemes, includin'* that of a
water supply for domestic and stock
purposes, the erection of a public
school, Court House, post office and
police station. We also sought to
have a Common dedicated and the
roadways improved.
“Agriculture was then coming more
into vogue, was it not?”
“It was! As the district land be-
came settled and the worth of the
land for wheat production was de-
monstrated, our Progress Association
commenced an agitation for a rail-
way extension from Cootamundra.
There were many hard-fought battles
before we got our desire, but at last
we convinced the authorities that our
permanency and prosperity depended
upon railway connection. Natural-
ly, I was in the thick of the fighting
and it gives me the greatest pleasure
to-day to look back over the activities
of those progressive undertakings.
“Your Municipal Council was
formed, I believe, in the year 1890?”
“About that time! Being desirous
of developing my own business I did
not participate in municipal affairs
until many years after the town was
incorporated. It was in the year
1900 that I first entered the Council
and I was perfectly content to take a
back seat, as we had some first-class
Aldermen at the time. When the
Local Government Act was passed in
1906 I resigned from the position of
alderman and made the first valua-
tion on the Unimproved Capital Value,
as prescribed by the new Act. Need-
less to say, the valuations on the new
basis came as a big surprise to many
wealthy owners and numerous appeals
were lodged. Most of these were set-
tled at a Friendly Appeal Court, but
we could not agree concerning the
main section of Hoskins-street, from
Lcfius-street to Victoria-street. The
matter was therefore fought out in
the Appeal Court, which upheld my
valuation for the Royal Exchange
Corner (which was regarded as the
key position), with the result - that
all the other appellants fell into line,
accepting a compromise, which did
not cost the Council £25 per annum.
This valuation, it might be mention-
ed, has stood the test of 25 years, all
subsequent valuations having been
based upon it.
“The Municipal Council became
somewhat notorious in those days!”
“Yes! there was a somewhat
stormy period after the first election
under the new Act and the Municip


ality was eventually declared a de-
faulting' area. The dictatorship last-
ed for several months, then a “short-
term Council” was created to hold of-
fice until the next triennial election
came round. I was elected a member of
the short-term-Council, after some
vigorous campaigning, in which quite
a lot of interest was shown in the is-
sues of the day. Both factions
fought hard then and at the succeed-
ing triennial election, when I was
again on the winning side, together
with four others of my party, which
thus had a majority.
“Was that the year they appointed
you Mayor?”
“It was. One of the first things we
took on was the establishment of elec-
tricity works for the town, which
were in due course inaugurated and
proved successful from their incep-
tion. Excepting for necessary ad-
ditions the scheme was that which
was last year superseded by the Bur-
rinjuck scheme.
“When was the water scheme
launched?’ ’
“While Mayor I attended many
conferences to discuss projected
schemes from Adjunbilly, Junee and
Burrinjuck, which latter I strongly ad-
vocated throughout. I was one of 70
representative men who met the Hon.
Arthur Griffiths when he was Minister
for Works in the Holman Ministry.
The meeting was held at Cootamun-
dra. Mr. Griffiths was emphatic in
his declaration that the Burrinjuck
Scheme could not spare any water be-
yond what was required for the Mur-
rumbidgee Irrigation Area.
“That did not damp your ardour?”
“No! We kept pegging away and
eventually a report was prepared by
the Chief Engineer of the Public
Works Department and showed that
sufficient water could be released to
meet the domestic requirements of
several south-western towns without
in any way prejudicing irrigation re-
quirements.
“So you went straight ahead?”
“When we obtained Parliamentary
consent to a Public Works inquiry, I
took up the secretarial duties and
worked hard to obtain evidence at Te-
mora and West Wyalong in sup-
port of our claim for a town water
supply.
“It seems to be within measurable
distance of being adopted now.”
“As soon as the financial aspects
of the scheme can be equitably ad-
justed to the needs and means of the
various municipalities, only a short
period of time need elapse before
water will be running through pipes
in the town of Temora. Then one of
our long-cherished hopes will be rea-
lised. Already I feel proud of hav-
ing been associated with such a
splendid achievement as the estab-
lishment of a perfectly pure and ab-
solutely permanent water supply
scheme for Temora and the other
towns embraced in the scheme.
“You have certainly done your
share to get the water here.”
“Whatever I have done in a public
way has been from a sense of good
citizenship. Though, necesarily, I
have received some hard knocks, I
have gone through my public life with
very few clashes and believe that I
still hold the goodwill of those who
have been called my opponents. After
a long course of public life, I feel im-
pelled to say that it is the duty of
every citizen to contribute his quota
towards the good of the whole and to
pull with all others in securing the
good things. . The residents of Te-
mora possess a splendid heritage and
the district should go very far if
every unit was as keen as he should
be upon its development. Admitted-
ly, we are passing through bad times
—possibly the worst we have ever
known—but we must not forget that
we are Passing Through. It is al-
ways darkest before its dawn. We
have nothing to lose and everything
to gain by being optimistic. Al-
though an old man now, I expect to
still be here when good times come
again. As in the days of the diggings,
‘Let us keep on keeping on.” ’
Our reporter’s final question had to
do with Mr. Nixon’s association with
St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church.
“I attended the opening of the
original kirk about 50 years ago (he
said). A couple of years later I was
appointed session clerk and have
served the Church in that capacity
and as a member of the Board of
Management ever since. It was a
great delight to me when the fine
new church was built last year and
opened in November. Returning
Presbyterians will ,1 am sure, ap-
preciate what has been done in this
direction.”
Having thanked Mr. Nixon for his
courtesy in giving up so much of his
time, our reporter returned to his
office, well pleased with his “swag” of
good copy for inclusion in the Jubilee
Souvenir.
Mr. A. W. Denyer
Mr. Alf Denyer is a carpenter and
has erected many a cosy cottage in
Temora. He is a hard worker for the
Country Party, the Farmers and Set-
tlers’ Association (of which he is
president), the Show Committee, and
the Baptist Church and Sunday
School. .
Alderman W. Giles
Was elected Mayor in December last
after only two or three years’ service
as an alderman. He is one of the
most energetic of our public men,
being president of the Country Par-
ty Electoral Council, a vice-president
of the Show Committee, patron of the
Coursing Club and Golf Club, and
vice-president of the Parents and Citi-
zen’s Association. He has two fine
farming and grazing properties, re-
spectively at “Highbury” and
“Trickettdale,” Bectric, and is quoted
far and wide as an up-to-date hus-
bandman.
Mr. W. W. Killen,
M.H.R.
is a big man in every way and has
given good service as the Federal
member for the Riverina. He believes
in getting first-hand information on
any subject he discusses and knows
more about Central Australia, the
Northern Territory and the pastoral
industry than most of , the other Par-
liamentary men do. Though he had
a serious illness a couple of years ago
he has made a splendid recovery and
is ready to contest the seat again at
the coming elections.


Our Veteran Shire
Clerk
MR. AUGUSTUS CYRIL OLDRINI,
F.L.C.A., J.P.
The veteran clerk of the Narrabur-
ra Shire is in his 77th year, having
been born at Beeston, Nottinghamsire,
England, on All Saints’ Day of 1854.
He was the second son of Rev. T. J.
Oldrini, Vicar of St. Johns Church of
England, Beeston, and received his
education at Hurstpeirpoint College,
Sussex, England. After leaving
school he was employed for three
years at Moore and Robinson’s “Nott-
ingham and Notts Bank,” Notting-
ham.
At the age of 23 Mr. A. C. Oldrini
set out for Australia on the ill-fated
Orient liner, “S.S. Chimbarazo,”
which was making its second trip
and was wrecked off Point Perpendi-
cular. The passengers and crew were
carried on to Sydney by the paddle-
box steamer Colloroy. Mr. Oldrini
thus landed in Sydney on the 12th
March, 1878. Within six months he
was on his way to the interior and
began work at Lake Cowal in Sep-
tember of 1878. Mr. Oldrini
. _ «• y
MR. A. C. OLDRINI
(among other things) was a cattle
drover, and when the Temora gold
rush broke out in 1880 he brought
cattle from Lake Cowal to this centre.
He has much that is interesting to
tell about the early days of this
townsship, but pressure on space pre-
cludes this just here. ■
In April, of 1884, Mr. Oldrini took
up a!block of land in the parish of
Dinga Dinga and engaged in mixed
farming until (in 1902) he came in-
to Temora to live. He was appointed
Mining Warden’s Bailiff in 1902 and
held that position for about 20 years.
He was appointed a Justice of the
Peace in 1895 and ten years later he
was appointed as Guardian of Minors
—a position that he still holds.
When the temporary Shire Council
was established Mr. Oldrini was (on
13th June, 1906)appointed,temporary
Shire Clerk and when the full-blown
Narraburra Shire Council was elected,
it appointed him- as Shire. Clerk—a
position that he has held since the sth
December, 1906—just over 24 years.
Mr., Oldrini holds the degree of
Fellow of the Local Government
Clerks’ Association of N.S.W. and is
one of the oldest Local Government
Clerks in the State, both in point of
age and service.
He is a Lay Reader of St. Paul’s
Church of England, Temora and is
the Senior Lay Reader in the Goul-
burn Diocese. He is the senior
Church Warden of the local Church
and has been a Warden for 29 years.
He is also the Secretary of the
Church of England Cemetery Trust
and a most valued counsellor—alike
from the rectors’ and parishioners’
point of view.
Mr. Henry C. Lapthorne
The honorary organiser of the
Back-to-Temora celebrations is a
native of Bendigo, that wonderful
quartz field, from which 645 tons of
gold were won in 70 years. He be-
gan work at the age of 12, in the
Numurkah “Standard” printing office
and in January of 1890 joined the
staff of the “Mildura Cultivator.”
Acquiring that business in 1898, he
continued to control it till 1920, when
he sold to the late C. J. DeGaris.
The dried fruit industry was then at
its peak and Mr. Lapthorne purchased
a 40-acre property at Merbein, ad-
joining Mildura. Unfortunately,
though yields were good, prices drop-
ped 100 per cent, and were not pay-
able. Mr. Lapthorne had to revert to
journalism and in September, 1924
joined the staff of the “Independent.”
When the Jubilee Celebrations were
launched he accepted the position of
hon. secretary and has done a lot of
hard work in that capacity. If it
had not been for his zeal and pertin-
acity the project would undoubtedly
have been dropped in January.
Whatever measure of success it at-
tains is largely attributable to his
efforts, backed up by a dozen or so
enthusiastic Committee-men.
For 40 years Mr. Lapthorne has
been an active member of the Metho-;
dist Church, having filled practically
every position that a layman can
hold. At present he is Superintend-
ent of the Temora Methodist Sunday
School, a local preacher, Congrega-
tional Secretary, .secretary of the
Cemetery Trust, and editor of “The
Temora Methodist.”...
Mr. Harold Nicholson
Who purchased the late W. Daniels’
watchmaking, jewellery, silver and
electroplateware and optician busi-
ness sixteen years ago, is another of
our prominent citizens. For ten
years he has been a member of the
Committee of the School of Arts, of
which fine institute he is now Presi-
dent. He is also President of the
Retailers’ Association, President of
the Temora Tennis Club and President
of the District Tennis Association.
As Alderman of the Municipality he
has justified the confidence which
the ratepayers placed in him, and
there is every probability of Mr.
Nicholson being the next occupant of
the Mayoral Chair. In short, he is
an all-round good townsman and keen
sporting enthusiast.
Mr. L. P. Higgins
Is a native of Temora, and, like
every other loyal citizen, he takes a
pride in the progress of the town
where he first saw the light of day.
At the age of 14 he joined the staff
of the Temora “Independent,” and
after twenty years faithful and effi-
cient service he embraced the oppor-
tunity, eight years ago, to purchase
the Temora “Star,” the destinies of
which paper he still controls. Mr.
Higgins is President of the United
Friendly Societies Association, Presi-
dent of the Temora Cricket Associa-
tion, Warden of the A.H.C. Guild
and a member of the Committee of
the Trotting Club. At the last Con-
ference of the Country Press Associa-
tion he was elected a member of the
Executive of the Country Press As-
sociation.


The Great War
Temora did its share when the call
to arms came in 1914 and following
years. Altogether 332 local men en-
listed as soldiers and of these 30 paid
the supreme sacrifice. A memorial to
their honor was unveiled on Anzac
Day of 1922, Mrs. Robt. Harvey per-
forming that task. Four of her sons
had enlisted and three were killed in
action. Senator Pearce represented
the Federal Government. As Town
Clerk, Mr. Frank O’Brien did a great
deal of work for the Monument Fund,
but the moving spirit was Mr. Dun-
can Sinclair, of Combaning. The
memorial was erected in a command-
ing position at the intersection of
Loftus and De Boos Streets, opposite
the Municipal Chambers and the con-
tract price was £loso—with extras
and architect’s fees, which brought
the total cost up to £llOO. Each An-
zac Day and each Armistice Day
wreaths are placed on the monument
by various public bodies and by
mourning relatives and cobbers.
There is a strong branch of the
R.S.S.I.L. in Temora, of which Mr.
W. Upton is President and Mr.
M. C. I. Levy, B. A., Secretary and
Mr. Arthur Mitchell, Treasurer.
Each year it raises a large sum of
money for disabled ex-service men, as
much as £3OO being raised in 1929.
Messrs. John Meagher
& Co. Ltd.
The late Hon. John Meagher,
M.L.C., was attracted to Temora in
the very early days of the gold-fields
and promptly secured the site in
Hoskins-street, where the firm’s mag-
nificent pile of brick buildings now-
stands. The original building was of
galvanised iron, and the carting of
stores had to be done by experienced
teamsters, who had to bring the goods
60 miles from Hill End. It was after
the gold rush had petered out that the
Meaghers built their first brick
premises, and many declared that
they would prove “a white elephant.”
However, the district developed and
continued to make such progress as to
induce this enterprising firm to en-
large the store to its present propor-
tions. The firm has also established
big stores at West Wyalong, Barmed-
man and Forbes. Bathurst was an-
other of Meagher and Co.’s centres
and they have also a Sydney office
and a London buying office. Mr.
Peter Meagher, Junior, is at present
the manager of the senior store,
which continues to do an eormous
business. Incidentally, we might
mention that Mr. Peter Meagher,
Senior, when resident in Temora,
took an active part in public move-
ments and at one time occupied the
position of Mayor.
Mr. Hugh Main, M.L.A.
has represented Teniora in the State
Parliament ever since he returned
from the war. He is a most con-
scientious worker 'and has shown a
sound, practical-common sense, which
has won for him the respect of all
parties, both in the House and out.
He resides in the electorate, at “Re-
treat,” Bethungra.
Mr. Fred Mitchell
came to Temora 25 years ago
under engagement to Mr. C. Gelling,
and after being ten years in his em-
ploy, Mr. Mitchell took over the
same business, of machinery agent,
etc., which he has been running suc-
cessfully for the past 15 years.
Notwithstanding the fact that he is
a busy business man, Mr. Mitchell,
being imbued with a spirit of citizen-
ship, has been, and still is, actively
identified with public bodies. For
six years he filled the position of
treasurer of the School of Arts and
for three years he occupied the Presi-
dential chair of that fine institute, be-
sides being a committee man for some
time. He was an alderman of the
local Council for about 12 years and
occupied the Mayoral Chair for near-
ly two years. For twelve years he
proved an ideal secretary of the Hos-
pital, for which institution he has
always been an enthusiastic worker.
At the last annual meeting he was
elected to the proud position of
Chairman of the first Board of Di-
rectors for the Hospital. During the
great war Mr. Mitchell acted as
secretary for different functions to
raise funds for the soldiers.
James Thom Ltd.
The late James Thom started his
store in Temora just over 40 years
ago, in the premises now occupied by
Mr. Fred Mitchell. He had unbound-
ed faith in the district and built com-
modius premises here, also in West
Wyalong and Barmedman. For
years Mr. Thom was a familiar figure
in town and at one time he occupied
the Mayoral chair for three years.
His lamented death was followed by
another disaster in the destruction of
the Hoskins-street premises by fire.
Nothing daunted, the present spacious
and modern building w-as erected on
the old site, its completion being sig-
nalised by a wonderful ball in aid of
Hospital funds, by. which the sum of
£376 was netted. Since his father’s
death, Mr. James Thom, Junior, has
had charge of the big business.

Mr. R. McCrone
Mr. “Bob” McCrone has been about this district
almost since baby-hood. At eight years of age he
was doing a man’s work and he has been a hard
grafter ever since, up to quite recently. He is brim-
ful of interesting reminiscenses of Temora, and of
the hardships endured by the old pioneers. He has
figured prominently in local election campaigns, is
an active worker for the P.A.H. and I. Association
and the Farmers and Settlers’ Association, and has
on several occasions acted as judge of growing
crops. He is President of the Trotting Club and
the Coursing Club, and has taken an active part in
other public movements having for their object the
welfare of the town and district. No man is better
known and respected than Mr. McCrone.
Mr, H. M. Kavanagh
Mr. Harry Kavanagh is the Show Committe-Man
of longest service, and a noted exhibitor of prize
merinos—as well as a judge of these at neighbour-
ing Shows. An interesting interview with the
genial “Harry’ ’appears in this Souvenir.
The above photo was taken at the Morangorell
Hotel quite recently of three old veterans. They are
Thomas Kite (without coat), veteran shearer;
Thomas Maguire (centre) and Thomas Lovatt, the
man with a wonderful memory, who knows early
history, particularly that of the bushrangers, which
he never fails to accurately relate. It is a coinci-
dence that the Christian name of these well-known
identities is Thomas. Tom Maguire ran the Te-
mora-Grenfell mail CO years ago, and he is now
running Morangorell-Bribbaree mail. In the early
days his horse broke a leg at Temora Station, and
Tom walked from that station to Grenfell, carrying
the mailbags, a distance of 55 miles.


Ald. Wm. Callaghan
Aid. W. Callaghan came to Temora about the
end of 1907, so has been a resident for more than
23 years. Together with Mr. T. N.' Cowley, lie
purchased a butchering business from' Messrs.
Hingerty Bros., which they have carried on con-
jointly ever since. Both were unmarried when they
arrived, but that state of affairs was eventually
corrected and each has now a home and a family
in Polaris-street.
Aid. Callaghan came into public notice during the
stormy days of the Conscription ■ campaign, and
after the conclusion of the war he entered the Muni-
cipal Council. After serving for only one year as
alderman he was elected Mayor and filled that po-
sition for nine years to the general satisfaction and
advantage of the ratepayers. It was only last De-
cember that he vacated the Mayoral Chair.
Aid. Callaghan has also been President of the
Nationalist party and a vice-president of the
P.A.H. and I. Association and the Hospital Com-
mittee. With his colleague, Aid. Nixon, he has
fought consistently for the extension of the South-
Western Tablelands Water Supply Scheme, attend-
ing various deputations, both in Sydney and else-
where.
On the sporting, side, Aid. Callaghan has served
on racing and trotting committees and is an ex-
perienced boxer. His services have been frequent-
ly requisitioned to referee boxing bouts. Incident-
ally, he was president of the Back-to-Temora Com-
mittee for several months, till he made way for the
Chairman of the Hospital Committee and accepted
a vice-presidency instead.
Rev. H. J. Hillman
besides being the Minister of St. Andrew’s Presbyt-
erian Church, has taken an active part in the affairs
of the town. He is a member of the School of
Arts Committee; _ President of the Parents and
Citizen’s Association; Chairman of the Hostel Com-
mittee and Captain of the Temora Cricket Club.

UP-TO-DATE IN EVERY DETAIL
Mr. T. J. A. Fitz-
patrick
of Warre Warral, is one of the dis-
trict’s most capable men, and a hard
worker. Three years ago he contest-
ed the Cootamundra electorate for
the State Parliament, and was beaten
by only 18 votes. For two years he
has been President of the Temora
P.A.H. and I. Association, and has
filled the position with general ac-
ceptance. His paternal care of sev-
eral young farmers who have settled
on the Erin Vale sub-division is well
known and he is entitled to a good
deal of the credit for three Royal
Show Cups that went out his way.
Sacred Heart Church, Temora
Presbyterian Church, Temora.
Pardey & Co.
Mr. Arthur Pardey was for a long
time a conspicuous figure in the com-
mercial life of Temora. The up-to-
date flour mill at the west end of
Polaris-street is a monument to his
enterprise and is undoubtedly the best
equipped mill outside the Metropolis.
Messrs. Pardey and Co. are large
buyers of wheat and make sure of
getting the best. To encourage bet-
ters methods Mr. Pardey gave sub-
stantial prizes for the best growing-
crop of wheat and also offered three-
pence per bushel extra for Minister
wheat. Since his father’s retirement
to Sydney, Mr. Les Pardey has car-
ried on the business in the same ex-
tensive, up-to-date way.


Mr. A. D. Ness
Though he retired to live at Manly about two
years ago, Mr. A. D. Ness is well worthy of a few
words in this Souvenir. He came to Temora about
33 years ago, and, in partnership with Mr. Knowl-
man, was engaged in milling for six years. Subse-
quently he went in for wheat buying and agency
work.and finally took on the duties of Show Sec-
retary, which he performed most faithfully, re-
ceiving great assistance from his wife and daugh-
ter Lila. Mr. Ness served for several years as an
Alderman and filled the Mayoral Chair for a year.
He was Secretary for the Nationalist Party till he
left Temora.
Temora Silos,
Site where the first crop of wheat was grown in
Temora District.
To the late Mr. Dennis O’Keefe must be given
credit for having grown the first crop of wheat in
this district. His selection was situated at his old
home, to the left of the Narraburra road, 8 miles
distant, the remains of the chimney being shown in
the above photo. Like most of the pioneers Mr.
O’Keefe had an uphill baUle. He was a man of re-
markable energy and tenacity. His case is one of
the very few instances of success attending the
efforts of a small holder in working from a com-
paratively small farmer to a large and successful
farmer and grazier. His success was a fitting re-
ward for the hard struggle he had made in the early
days.
