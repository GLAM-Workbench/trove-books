Australian Rainfall. By H. A. Hunt, Commonwealth Meteorologist.
The main factors to be considered in relation to the controlling causes of
rainfall in Australia are the south-east and westerly trade winds, the
monsoonal and southern depressions, cyclones from the north-east and north-
west tropics, locally formed cyclones, and the anticyclones, in conjunction with
the modifying effects on these various atmospheric movements of the physical
features of the different parts of the country.
Around the central dry area of Australia the isohyets describe somewhat
concentric curves, the modifications being mostly due to variations in elevation.
Thus, the Darling Ranges to a great degree account for the rainfall of the
south-west corner of the continent. The Flinders Range (South Australia)
and Australian Alps in the south-east have a heavier rainfall than the surround-
ing tracts owing to their cooling effect on the air-currents. Along the eastern
elevated margin of the Commonwealth the ridges between large river-valleys
also account for an enhanced precipitation. Examples of the latter type are the
Peak Range and Darling Downs in Queensland, where the eastern ranges of the
northern parts of that State obstruct the south-east trade winds and cause
our heaviest rainfall. In Western Tasmania there is an excessive rainfall for
similar reasons, though there the westerly trades are the moisture-laden winds.
During the hotter months, November to April inclusive, the northern parts
of Australia are wet and the southern dry, and in the colder months, May to
October inclusive, the southern parts are wet and the northern dry, while o\er
the ï¿½astern areas of the continent the rainfall is distributed fairly generally
throughout the year.
The southern portions of the continent, where the precipitations are con-
trolled by the ? stormy westerlies,? southern cyclones and V-shaped depressions,
enjoy very consistent annual totals, but north of the tropics, and in fact in all
parts of the continent subject to monsoon rains, the departures from the
normal are occasionally very great.
When the monsoonal disturbances are in evidence, the effect of the rainfall
on the country generally and the economic results for the succeeding season
are very pronounced. The interior of the continent becomes transformed.
The plains, which ordinarily have an intensifying effect on the heat winds
of the summer, are deluged with rain, and respond immediately with a luxurious
growth of grass and herbage. The air is then both tempered in heat and loses
its dryness for considerable periods.
The monsoon region comprises the whole of Australia north of the Tropic
of Capricorn, together with Southern Queensland and the north of New South
Wales, The heaviest rains are in January and February. They are directly
due to the indraught caused by the heating of the centre of the continent. This
leads to the formation of a low pressure in Northern Australia, and the ascend-
ing winds are cooled and deposit their water-vapour in heavy rainstorms and
thunder showers.
Tropical depressions when well developed are productive of good inland
rains, and are evidently caused \jy southward flows of the atmosphere of wide
extent and considerable depth. The ? Antarctic ? disturbances are, however, the
more frequent in winter. The heaviest totals from this last-named source are
precipitated on the west coast of Tasmania. Thus at Mount Lyell the total
for one year exceeded 140 inches, and even the average is 116?05 inches. When
6 1


an ? Antarctic ? is supplemented by a' ? trough ? extending well into the northern
interior, it brings much rain to the inland areas of South Australia, Victoria,
New South Wales, and even Queensland.
Anticyclonic rains occur at all times of the year, but more markedly from
March to September. They benefit particularly the southern area of the
continent, and are responsible for many of the heaviest rainfalls and floods on
the coastal districts of New South Wales.
Flood rains occur at infrequent intervals over various portions of the
Commonwealth, principally in Queensland, the south-eastern parts of the
continent, and the northern regions of West Australia.
Typical instances of floods in South-eastern Australia are (1) the flood which
occurred in January 1910 in the Upper Darling tributaries, consequent on
abnormally heavy rains on the north-western plains and slopes of New South
Wales, as well as on the Darling Downs of Queensland.
These exceptionally heavy, continuous rains were caused by the joint action
of an anticyclonic area over the southern regions and a monsoonal depression
operating in the northern half of the continent. A monsoonal tongue developed
and extended southwards over Queensland and New South Wales, while at the
same time the energy of the high pressure in the south increased. In five days
large areas in the two States had from 5 inches to 19 inches of rain.
The enormous amount of water which fell over approximately 86,000 square miles
of country may be roughly estimated at thirty-one billion, six hundred and
eighty-seven million (31,687,000,000) tons, or seven thousand one hundred
billion (7,100,000,000,000) gallons.
(2) A similar development occurred in March of the present year, when a
monsoonal tongue extending southwards across the continent against an
intensified anticyclone in the south was accompanied by severe thunderstorms
and torrential rains. Some of the heaviest individual falls were in New South
Wales; e.g., Taraljgo on the iCentral Tablelands 10-74 inches, Sydney 8*49 inches,
Parramatta 16*91 inches, and Beecraft 18'84 inches in the metropolitan area, and
Wollongong 25-34 inches, on the south coast. The barometer readings at Sydney
ranged from 30-13 inches to 29*97 inches during the five days the storms were
in progress, while the anticyclone to the south gradually gave way simul-
taneously, the centre (30-4 inches) moving slowly over the southern parts of
Victoria and Tasmania eastwards to the South Pacific Ocean.
The wettest known place in Australia is Innisfail, on the north-east coast of
Queensland, where the average rainfall for twenty-one years is no less than
145 inches, the maximum yearly total being 21P24 inches, and the minimum
69-87 inches.
The driest region so far furnished with rain gauges lies east and north-east
from Lake Eyre, where less than 5 inches is the average annual rainfall and
where a total of 10 inches is rarely recorded during the twelve months ?This
minimum rainfall is coincident with the lowest elevation, Lake Eyre being-
actually below sea-level 39 feet. ? - &
The inland districts of Western Australia have until recent years been
regarded as the driest part of the Commonwealth, but authentic observations
taken during the past decade at settled districts in the east of that State show
that the annual average is from 10 to 12 inches.
In comparing the rainfall of the chief cities of the rest of the world 1 with
those of Australia, it is found that Bombay, Calcutta, Colombo, Singapore and
Hong Kong are the only cities whose rainfall exceeds that of Sydney? and
Brisbane. Perth has a greater annual rainfall than New York, and?more than
that of twenty-eight of the forty-two cities used in the comparison. Hobart
nearly equals London, which Melbourne exceeds by an inch, while eleven of
the forty-two places considered have less rain than Hobart.

The distribution of average annual rainfall over the Commonwealth and
?the United Kingdom in thousands of square miles is as follows

The average area under wheat in the United Kingdom during the years
1910, 1911, and 1912 was 1,926,040 acres, and the average yield 59,436,392
bushels; while in the Commonwealth for the same period the area under wheat
was 7,379,980 acres, and the average yield 86,243,133 bushels, a difference in
the total yield in favour of Australia of 26,806,741 bushels. In Australia wheat-
growing under ordinary conditions is generally considered a safe and payable
proposition when 10 inches of rain and over falls from the month of April to
that of October inclusive.. There are in all 484,330 square miles of country with
10 inches of rainfall and over during the wheat-growing period. The output
of wheat has been steadily increasing from year to year, and there are vast
possibilities of future development in this direction.
The climatic history and prosperity of the last ten years or so contradict
emphatically the preconceived notion that Australia is the particular drought-
stricken and precarious area of the earth?s surface. These misconceptions of
the true character of the country have been held in the developmental stages,
to a greater or less extent, in the early histories in the majority of all lands
and in the colonisation of newly discovered territories; e.g., see history of
colonisation of U.S. America and early Egyptian history. The truth of the
matter about Australia?s rainfall is that (1) it is generally ample for
pastoral and agricultural industries over two-thirds of its area; (2) that different
regions have distinct seasonal dry and wet periods. These must be more fully
recognised and industrial operations adapted accordingly; (3) It is subject in
part, but never in the whole, to prolonged periods when the rainfall is short
of the seasonal average. Australia is not peculiar in this respect. It follows,
therefore, that as the so far undeveloped country becomes populated and put
to profitable use, the general wealth of the community as a whole will steadily
increase.
A model representing the relative rainfall over Australia has been constructed
at the Commonwealth Weather Bureau on a horizontal of 133 miles to
1 inch and a vertical scale of 10 inches to 1 centimetre.
It shows at a glance how the annual rainfall is distributed, from the small
precipitation over the far interior to the fringe of high rainfall around the
greater portion of the coast-line, culminating on the eastern side in a great
peak indicating the annual precipitation over the Harvey Creek and Innisfail
district, resulting from the prevailing south-east trade winds carrying the
moisture against the mountain ranges just inside the coast.
The fringe of relatively high rainfall along the eastern and south-eastern
coasts of the continent as the result of the elevated contours near the coast in
those regions is also striking.
The effect of the monsoonal rains over Northern Australia is very apparent
from the model, which shows the gradual increase of rainfall from under 10
inches in the interior to over 60 inches on the north coast.
The manner in which the prevailing westerly trade winds carry moisture
along the southern portion of the Commonwealth is clearly marked by the
elevations indicating the good rains received over the south-west corner of
Australia, and, further eastward, how the ranges east of Adelaide cause good
rainfall there and prevent the rain from that direction reaching the inland
parts of Victoria.
In Tasmania also is seen the effect of the frequency of the moist westerly
winds, causing high rainfall along the mountain ranges of the west coast, with
resulting comparative dryness in the eastern parts of that State.
It may be of interest to note in closing that there exists apparently an


oscillatory movement of the seasonal rains throughout Australia about a centre-
in the vicinity of Forbes, in New South Wales. It is perhaps a natural,
coincidence that this apparent centre of oscillation is approximately the centre
of gravity of the Commonwealth?s population, and is not far from the Federal
capital site.
This peculiar oscillatory character of the monthly march of rainfall suggested
the construction of a ? Rain Clock. ? In the centre of a piece of cardboard a map
of Australia is cut out with a die. At the back of this another piece of card-
board, indicating the rain area, is manipulated on a swivel. By moving the
second piece of cardboard backwards and forwards with an amplitude of oscilla-
tion of one-fifth of a circle, the land area of the continent affected by dry or
wet conditions at any time of the year is approximately indicated.
The immediate lessons to be learned from a study of the ? Clock ? are that the
seasonal rains are more regular than was generally believed, and that the
alternating dry and wet seasons are definitely defined. That being so, when in
obedience to physical law there is an absence of rain during the normally dry
period in any part of Australia, such dryness should not be regarded aï¿½
drought, and an evil, but rather as Nature?s wise provision for resting the soil.
