1916 Song Book
THE FOGGY DEW
Old Irish Air
AS down the glen one Easter mom to a city fair rode I,
There armed lines of marching men in squadrons passed
me by;
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound its loud tattoo,
But the Angelas bell, o'er the Liffey’s swell, rang out through
the Foggy Dew.
Right proudly high in Dublin Toum they flung out the flag of
war,
Turns better to die ’neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud
El Bar;
And from the plains of Royal Meath strong men came hurrying
through,
While Britannia’s Huns, with their great big guns, sailed in
through the Foggy Dm>.
O, the night fell black, and the rifles’ crack made “perfidious
Albion” reel,
’Mid the leaden rain, seven tongues of flame did shine o’er the
lines of steel;
By each shining blade a prayer was said that to Ireland her
sons be true,
And when morning broke, still the war flag shook out its folds
in the Foggy Dew.
Twas England bade our Wild Geese go that Small Nations
might be free,
But their lonely graves are by Suvla’s waves, on the fringe of
the great North Sea.
had they died by Pearse’s side, or had fought with Cathal
Brugha,
Thsir names we’d keep where the Fenians sleep, ’neath the
shroud of the Foggy Dew.


But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell rang mournfully and
clear.
For those who died that Eastertide, in the Springtime of the
year;
While the world did gaze, with deep amaze, at those fearless
men, but few,
Who bore the fight that Freedom's light might shine through
the Foggy Dew.
Ah! back through the glen I rode again, and my heart with
grief was sore.
For I parted then with valiant men whom I never shall see
more;
But to and fro in my dreams I go, and J kneel and pray for
you,
For shivery fled, O glorious Dead!, when you fell in the
Foggy Dew.
TTHE Rising of Easter Week, 1916, commenced at
1 noon on Monday, April 24, in Dublin, and came
to an end there at 3 p.m. on Saturday, April 29. The
leaders of the Rising surrendered to save the civilian
population from slaughter.


THE THREE-COLOURED RIBBON
(A Ballad of Easter Week).
T HAD a true love, if ever a girl had one,
1 I had a true love, a brave lad was he;
One fine Easter Monday with his gallant comrades
He started away for to set Ireland free.
Chorus :
All round my hat J wear a three-coloured ribbon 0,
All round my hat until death comes to me;
And if anybody's asking me why do I wear it.
It's all far my true love I ne'er more shall see.
His bandolier round him, his bright bayonet shining;
His short service rifle, a beauty to see;
There was joy in his eyes though he left me behind him.
And started away for to set Ireland free.
Chorus
He whispered “Good-bye, love, Old Ireland is calling
High over Dublin our tricolour flies;
In the streets of the City the foeman is falling ,
And wee birds are singing ‘Old Ireland, arise!’ ”
Chorus
In praying and watching the dark days passed aver ,
The roar of the guns brought no message to me;
I prayed far Old Ireland, I prayed for my lover,
That he might be saved, and old Ireland be free.
Chorus
The struggle was ended, they brought me the story,
The last whispered message he sent unto me:
“I was true to my land, lave, I fought for her glory,
And gave up my life for to make Ireland free!”
Chorus


THE DAY
(This
song was sung in the G.P.O. in Easter Week,
1916)
Air : “The Rising of the Moon.”
GOD rest you, Robert Emmet,
And God rest you, noble Tone,
God rest you, Hugh O'Donnell,
And O'Neill of brave Tyrone.
God rest you , Patrick Sarsfield,
In your grave far, far away;
God rest you all who strove to speed
The dawning of the Day!
Chorus :
Freedom's bright and blessed Day!
Ireland free from Saxon sway!
Lift your hearts and pray God speed
To the dawning of the Day!
Not in vain you poured your life-blood,
Gallant hearts of Ninety-Eight!
Not in vain you stood, undaunted
'Neath the scourge of English hate;
Men of Wexford! Men of Antrim!
Men whose names shall ne’er decay,
But shall shine like stars to lead us
To the dawning of the Day!
Chorus
Foreign foe and native traitor
Both have failed to quench the flame
That has guided Ireland’s armies
Through the years of pride and shame;
And 'twill flash to deathless glowing
Making bright the upward way,
When our men shall march to freedom
And the dawning of the Day!
Chorus


O'er the fields your blood has hallowed,
O, ye hosts of Irish Dead!
In the light of Freedom's morning
Men of Ireland yet shall tread.
When the foemen reel before them
In the thunder of the fray,
They shall shout your name in triumph
At the dawning of the Day!

r\NLY about 1/JOO persons took part in the Rising
in Dublin. The Republican Army was composed
of Irish Volunteers, 'Citizen Army, Hibernian Rifles,
Cumann na mßan and Fianna Eireann.


THE MEN OF DUBLIN
r T'HEY nailed their colours to the mast, the Orange, White
1 and Green;
A nobler set of Irishmen the world has never seen.
They knew through sloth and idleness a nation’s soul was lost,
They rose to save dear Ireland’s soul and counted not the cost.
They knew well that a thousand men—they did not number
more —
Could never break the tyrant’s chain and drive him from our
shore;
But this they knew—and knew it well —they would not die in
vain;
Their blood would save ou? country’s cause mid give her life
again.
Who vms it led this noble band, and what has been their fate?
Was chivalry shown to them at last? No, worse than ’9B.
They fought ’gainst overwhelming odds and held them well at
Till Britain swore that she would make the innocent to pay.
Then woe betide the citizens who went abroad at night,
The soldiers lay in ambush hid and shot them down at sight.
They shot the women and the men, they shot the children too ;
The Defender of Small Nations showed herself in colours true.
Then after the surrender there began a tyrant’s reign
When young and old—the brave and true—all ruthlessly were
slain.
Tom Clarke, the Brothers Pearse and Daly, Colbert young and
ffay
And Eamonn Ceannt and Connolly were shot at dawn of day.
The same fate met Sedn Heuston, MacDonagh and Macßride,
But ’twas outside the G.P.O. the brave O’Rahilly died.
Mallin, Plunkett and MacDermott fell before a firing squad;
Their blood with brave O’Hanrahan’s for vengeance cries to


Great numbers too were sentenced then and sent across the sea,
The men and women, hoys and girls, who strove to set us free.
Gold could not buy the ones who fought for Ireland through
that Week,
And they to make their sacrifice no purer cause could seek.
Enshrined are they for ever more in every Irish heart;
God bless those men and tvomen who played that noble part.
Who left their homes behind, them, who left their kith and. kin,
And rallied round their banner when the fighting did begin.
May their memory live for ever! May our children bless the
name
Of each one who fought for Ireland! May it ever be the same.
May our country still have heroes who me not afraid to die
On the battlefield or scaffold so owr proud old flag may fly!
ÜBIETY-EIGHT soldiers of the Republic were killed
in the fighting. The civilian casualties were 310
killed, of whom 40 were women and 20 children, and
there were over 800 wounded.
The British Commander-in-lChief admitted officially
that his losses were 106 killed and 334 wounded.
It was when Pearse and Connolly saw the English
shooting down in the streets the men, women and
children who had been driven from their homes by
the fires lighted by the advancing enemy, that they
decided to surrender.


HO FEARS TO SPEAK OF
EASTER WEEK?
(Written by a nun on 3rd May, 1916, when neim of the
first executions became known).
Air ; “The Memory of the dead”.
fears to speak of Easter Week?
Who dares its fate deplore?
The red gold flame of Eire's name
Confronts the world once more!
Oh! Irishmen, remember then,
And raise your heads with pride,
For great men and straight men
Have fought for you and died.
The spirit-wave that came to save
The peerless Celtic soul,
From earthly stain of greed and gain
Had caught them in its roll;
Rad swept them high to do or die,
To sound a trumpt call:
For true men though few men,
To follow one and all.
Upon their shield a stainless field,
With virtues blazoned bright;
With Temperance and Purity
And Truth and Honour dight.
So now they stand, at God’s Right Hand,
Who framed their dauntless clay,
Who taught them and brought them
The glory of to-day.
The storied page of this our. age
Will ; save bur Land from shmne>
The ancient foe had boasted- — ho!
That Irishmen were tame.


They’d bought their souls for paltry doles,
And told the world of slaves.
That lie, men! shall die, men!
In Pearse and Plunkett’s graves.
The brave who’ve gone to linger on
Beneath the tyrant’s heel—
We know they pray another day,
With clash of clanging steel.
Now from their cell their voices swell,
And loudly call on you.
Then ask, men! the task, men!
That yet remains to do.
1 AjT\ were sentenced by British Courtmartial after
1 the Rising. 97 were sentenced to death. 16 of
these were executed; 7 had the sentence commuted to
penal servitude for life, 23 to penal servitude for 10
years, 3 to penal servitude for 8 years, 14 to penal
servitude for 5 years, 34 to penal servitude for 3
years.
* I ‘HE last of the deported prisoners were released
at Christmas, 1916, and in an effort to bring
America into the European War and to induce
Ireland to accept Colonial status, all the sentenced
prisoners were released in July, 1917. But by that
time Ireland was not in the mood to become a British
Colony. That Easter Fire was never again to be
quenched, no matter how many might fail or forget.


IRELAND OVER ALL
COMMANDANT EAMONN CEANNT.
IRELAND, Ireland ’fore the wide world,
* Ireland, Ireland over all!
When we fight we’ll fight for Ireland,
Answer only Ireland’s call•
Plain mid mountain, rock and ocean.
From the Shannon to the sea.
Ireland, Ireland ’fore the unde world,
Ireland one and Ireland free!
Ireland’s land and Ireland’s Nation,
Ireland’s faith and hope and song,
Irishmen will yet redeem them
From the foreign tyrant throng;
Ireland’s homes and Ireland’s hillsides
Shall be freed from slavery;
Ireland, Ireland ’fore the wide world,
Ireland one ami Ireland free!
Unity and right and freedom
For our Irish Fatherland,
Strive we all we may secure them ,
Strive we all with heart and hand.
Be our aim, then, God defending,
Right eternal, liberty!
Ireland, Ireland ’fore the wide world.
Ireland one and Ireland free!
A FTER the Rising, thousands of suspects were
arrested all over Ireland and deported to English
prisons.


’TWAS ON A GLORIOUS
EASTER DAY
"“PTFAiS on a glorious Easter day
In brave old Dublin Town,
They lighted Freedom's fires anew
And braved the despot’s frown-
Read out the deathless names again 1
We love them, every one;
Our hearts shall hold their memory green
Till all the days are done.
Clarke, Connolly, the Brothers Pearse,
MacDermott, loved by all,
And Plunkett and O’Hanrahan —
They come at memory’s call.
MacDonagh’s laugh rings down the years;
Macßride’s undaunted soul,
And Eamonn Ceannt’s heroic heart
Make bright for us the Goal.
Ned Daly, Houston, Colbert true —
The young intrepid three
Who died in manhood’s glorious dawn,
Their Motherland to free.
And Mallin and the Brothers Kent;
And Rory of the Gael,
Who died for us in London Town,
The pride of Grdinne Mhaol.
Some gave their lives with gun in hand;
Their story proudly tell —
O’Rahilly and~fifty more.
Who bravely fighting fell.


’Twas on a glorious Easter day
In brave old Dublin Town,
They lighted Freedom’s fires anew,
And dared the despot’s frown.
They brought their shackled Motherland
To Freedom's open door —
God grant their holy dream comes true
Ere one more year is o’er.
1916
XTOT for the cause of faithless France,
Nor grasping Britain’s greed,
Nor for the Russian Bear’s advance
Was done this glorious deed.
Against grim foes at home they rose
In manly patriot pride,
And though that birth was crushed to earth
For Ireland’s rights they died.
Not by the far-off Dardanelles
Nor slimy Tigris banks,
Nor 'mid the din of pagan yells
Went down their bleeding ranks.
O’er sainted ground, with glory crowned,
Rolled on that battle-tide.
And proudly brave, their homes to save,
On Ireland’s soil they died.


MY OLD HOWTH CUN
(By an Irish Volunteer in Prison).
' I 'HERE is sorrow in my heart,
0, my old. Howth Gun!
Since we lately had to part,
0, my old Howth Gun!
For in Ireland’s day of need
Well you proved a friend indeed,
When you made the bullets speed,
O, my old Howth Gun!
I was glad when you were near,
O, my old Howth Gun!
And no foeman did I fea/r,
O, < my old Howth Gun!
For yowr bark and bitter bite
Put the Saxon curs to flight ,
And they wouldn’t dare to fight
With my old Howth Gwn!
The parting it was sore,
O, my old Howth Gun!
Sure I ne’er may see you more,
O, my old Howth Gun!
There was glorious hope that we
Gould have set old Ireland free.
Now you’re parted far from me,
O, my old Howth Gun!
But a day will come again,
0, my old Howth Gun!
When I’ll join the fighting men.
O, my old Howth Gun!

“WE SHALL RISE AGAIN”
IN Dublin's fair city there is sorrow to-day
4 For the flower of her manhood who fell in the fray;
Her youths and her maidens, her joy and her pride,
Have gone down in the battle,in war’s raging tide.
They came forth to fight for the cause that was banned ,
When freedom and liberty called, for their land;
In the ardour of youth, in the Spring of the year,
They came without falter, they fought without fear.
Near the moon of the day, on that fine April mom
Their tramp shook the streets where young Emmet was bom,
Then they raised high their banner — white, orange and green,
And it waved o’er the freemen, the men j of ’l6.
And high o’er the Liffey it waved in the wind,
O’er hearts that were brave and o’er noblest of mind;
And they fought i as of old and they held the old town
Till their banner, unsullied, still vmving, went down.
In that brave Easter Week gallant Dublin was free,
By the blood of her soldiers, from Swords to the sea;
O, proudly again does she raise her old head,
In joy and in sorrow saluting her dead.
O, Irish Republic! O, dream of our dreams!
All radiant and quenchless thy bright beauty gleams.
Though fallen and crushed ’neath the enemy’s heel
Thy glory and beauty shine, burnished like steel.
Not in vain was their death, who for Ireland have died,
And their deeds in our hearts in red gold are inscribed.
The freeing of Ireland to us is their trust;
We can, if we will it; we can, and we must!


In Dublin's fair city there is sorrow to-day
For the flower of her manhood who fell in the fray;
But in hearts that are true there is nothing of gloomy
And Ireland, regenerate, shall rise from her tomb.
THE BRAVE VOLUNTEERS
Am: “The Men of the West.”
'VV7HEN you honour in song and in story
v The memory of Emmet and Tone,
And all the brave heroes whose glory
In history's pages is shown;
Remember the boys of your own day,
Who scorned opposition and sneers,
And struck for the glory of Ireland,
Her true-hearted, brave Volunteers.
Chorus :
Then here's to the brave Volunteers, boys,
Who cast aside doubting and fears.
And fought for the honour of Ireland,
Hurrah! for the brave Volunteers.
Though sneered at by craven and traitor
They rose at the word of command;
The faith that was in them was greater
Than slave minds could e'er understand.
And meeting the might of an empire
Whose name they had cause to revile,
The brave boys who fought for old Ireland
Faced death with a prayer and a smile.
Chorus:


Though the fight for a wee while is over,
And the true hearts that led them are gone ,
The faith that inspired them is with us,
The cause of their land still goes on.
And if, in the days that are coming,
We’re tempted to pause or forget,
The memory of Pearse and his comrades.
Will help us to victory yet.
Chorus:
Then on with the fight, men of Ireland,
Let the memory of those that have died
Inspire us to fight for our freedom,
Though our efforts be crushed and decried.
Our cause will go forward to victory,
And high o’er the land will be seen,
The flag of an Irish Republic —
The Orange, the White, and the Green!
Chorus ;
THE DYING SOLDIER
(Dedicated to Padraig Pearse).
IWT OTHER Ireland! I have loved thee
With a love that knew 'not fear;
I have drawn the sword to free thee,
At the flowering of the year.
But a hand was raised to smite me,
As I stooped to kiss thy brow,
And the arm that would have freed thee
By my side hangs helpless now.
I have lived and loved and laboured
With a patriot’s heart and will,
That the dawning years might find thee
Fearless and unfettered still.


I am vanquished, and my comrades
In the glorious fight have hied,
And the dauntless hearts that loved thee
Rest among the silent dead.
But ’twere nobler thus to perish,
Thus to wipe away their tears,
With the distant voice of Freedom
Echoing in their dying ears,
Than to stand as fawning minions
Of the sneering conqueror’s race,
With the clanking chains of bondage
Telling of our deep disgrace.
When the deathless glow of Freedom,
Flickering through the gloom of years,
Shall have flashed upon the hilltops,
Conqueror of gloom and tears;
When a future age shall find thee,
Freemen standing by thy side,
Mother Ireland, O, remember
’Turns for Freedom’s cause they died.
They are gone, and I must follow
To the golden fields above.
Where the mighty God of Justice
Shall reward a patriot’s love.
Sweet it were to live and love thfe;
Sweeter far for thee to die.
With the flower-clad hills around me
Echoing hack my last good-hye.


DUBLIN
\J r OU poured your spies upon her streets.
You ringed her round with steel;
For three most hideous centuries
She lay beneath your heel.
You kept your forces round her gates,
And built your barracks well,
And in your Castle’s heart devised
Foul deeds—too foul for hell.
And there you planned the Epitaph
Of Ireland, day by day,
And watched our people fade and die.
Our language pass away.
And undisturbed, and all secure.
You sat the centuries,
And boasted of our loyalty
And fed the world with lies.
But Dublin tore from off her face
The horrid mask she wore,
And all the nations saw again
Her beauty as before.
She hurled you from your tyrant’s seat,
And, clothed in flame and lead,
She stood, a captive unenslaved.
And risen from the dead.
And though a few sad days will pass
Till she is wholly free,
And though you claim her once again,
God holds her destiny.
For He shall smite you to the earth,
And raise her on a throne,
And for those ages of despair,
That triumph shall atone.


THE IRISH BRIGADE
(A parody on the famous song by Thomas Davis. In the black
days of imprisonment and starvation in English jails after
Easter Week the humour of the Gael shone out like sunshine
and kept men sane and courageous).
1 1 'HEY all watch their doors and each white face is set,
1 For supper is ready, though it isn’t served yet.
The Staff-Sergeant cries with an uplifted glance :—
4, lnside your cells! With the supper advance!”
With shuffling and murm’ring they’ve done as he bade,
For they are all nearly starving, the Irish Brigade.
Now hear you that shuffling, and hear you that tramp,
As along come the tay-men, your mug just to damp.
And others with baskets of stuff they call bread —
It’s only half-baked and as heavy | as lead.
Hurrah, boys I the glad hour of supper has come.
And soon we’ll be bending o’er many a crumb.
As they sat on their stools and the black tea they quaffed—
“Here’s to England, our Mother!”—and fiercely they laughed.
And here’s to the fine feeds we ate long ago,
At home in old Dublin, where the Liffey doth flow.
God prosper the bakers! You’d think them afraid.
So pale grew the cheeks of the Irish Brigade.
So they feasted and revelled, fast, fiery and true,
And of loaves, if they had them, they’d eat not a few.
Like Lazarus, they picked up the crumbs off the floor,
And they begged their own people to send them some more.
Meat, butter and bread — o, the great cakes home made! —
To save from starvation the Irish Brigade.


THE YOUNG VOLUNTEER
Air : “Fdinne gael an lae
r T'HE hour has come to strike a blow
1 For Freedom and the Right,
And proudly, gladly do I go
To meet the coming fight.
In life or death, in joy or dree,
No power can part us two;
And under God my thoughts shall he
Of Eirinn and of you.
The blackbird’s song will fill the grove,
The thrush will pipe again,
And all the golden dreams we wove
Will haunt the lonely glen.
Our dreams of love and joy and peace,
A stor, may ne’er come true,
But prayers of mine shall never cease
For Eirinn and for you.
My heart was yours through all the years —
Yours and the land’s we love —
We’ve pledged our faith, in smiles and tears.
To her and God above.
No foe can harm me in the strife
We wage for Roisin Dubh,
I’ve given my hopes, my love, my life
To Him and her and you.
/''VU’TSIiD'E Dublin, there were Rising's in Galway
(led by Liam Mellows) and in Enniscorthy (Co.
Wexford), but the confusion caused by a counter-
manding order sent out on Easter Saturday by Eoin
MacNeill, who was Head of the Irish Volunteers,
paralysed the rest of the country and ruined the
fairest hopes Ireland had had for a hundred years;


BISHOP O’DWYER AND MAXWELL
(The British General, Sir John Maxwell, called on Dr.
O’Dwyer, Bishop of Limerick, to punish certain priests who
had helped the LE.A.)
join me in my dirty work,”
Wrote England's butcher bold;
“You've rebel priests within your See,
That love us not, I'm told.
Remove those men, where never more
They'll threaten England's sway,
And England’s love and gratitude
Shall be your own for ( aye .”
Then answer made the brave O’Dwyer:
“My laws are not as thine,
For yours condemn in ruthless haste,
It is not so with mine.
Ere I’ll accuse, I’ll know the charge,
The witness, place, and time,
And ere I’ll punish, I’ll have proof
That there I has been a crime.”
And quickly came the bogus charge , ‘
In humble accents framed :
“Methought it needed not to prove,
The guilt of those I named.
They’ve hearkened to the rebels’ word,
They’ve blessed the rebels’ cause —
By voice and pen they’ve taught their flocks
To spurn the Empire’s laws.”
Our Bishop true, no longer now
His anger can restrain;
Mis words are cutting as the scythe
That reaps the harvest grain:


“These men 'you name are godly men.
In act and thought guilt free —
They serve their God, and love itheir Land,
And that’s no crime to me.”
“And were their guilt tas black as night, •
Don’t think at your behest.
I’d join with those whose hands are dyed
In blood of Ireland’s best.
Full many a ruthless English churl
Has held our land in thrall ,
But history sure will write you down
The blackest of them all.”
“And do you think that I forget
My Country’s martyred dead ;
The brave, the pure, the high-souled lads.
Whose blood you foully shed?
Then here’s your answer : I may share
The fate of those who died,
But I’ll not be the first O’Dwyer
To take the Tyrant’s side.”
Descendant of a noble clan,
May you be left us long —
Fearless and true to uphold our cause
’Gainst tyrants cruel and strong.
They thought that every voice was stilled.
That hearts were cold with fear,
No coward threats your heart could chill.
Nor make your voice less clear.
And, oh! thank God that there are men
To speak with love and pride
Of those who lie in prison cells
And those who nobly died.
And where the glorious tale is told.
Of Ireland’s latest fight,
In letters golden shall be writ:
O’Dwyeb Upheld the Eight!


IRELAND TO THE BRITISH EMPIRE
A WITHERING curse upon thee —
A curse from the vaults on high —
That shall (wither your callous heartstrings
Till the world shall hear you sigh;
Till the souls of the nations plundered
To fill up your maw of greed,
Shall laugh while your limbs are sundered
And take a hand in the deed.
A curse from a God of Justice,
A curse from a God of Might,
And thrice from a God of Nations,
And again from a God of Right,
Across your path is a shadow,
In your ears the eternal din
Of an Army that's ever marching
To wipe out your heinous sin.
Then cursed be with gun and sabre,
And cursed be with sword and pen;
On the sides of the lonely (mountains,
'Midst the bustle and throng of men.
Accursed be with lead and burning ,
With boiling lead and with brands
Snatched from the fires of nations
By the bravest of many lands.
We have waited this hour of reckoning,
We have longed for this day of strife.
As, back in the hours of anguish,
Did the Fathers who gave us life.
It has come with unmeasured slaughter,
But there, 'midst the ruin and death.
The hosts of the Lord are waiting
To stifle your poisonous breath.


THE DEAD OF EASTER WEEK
(Old Irish Air).
OD rest the brave and gallant dead
Who walked beside us in the fight,
With burning hearts and martial tread.
To strike for Ireland and the Right.
We saw them fall, we saw them lie
Upon the hard, unsheltered street.
Their caoine—the bullets whistling by.
Their funeral march—our tramping feet.
No mother’s hand upon their brow,
No wife’s fond kiss upon their cheek;
But in our hearts a silent vow,
The prayer our lips could scarcely speak.
’Tis good to think in gloomy days.
When thoughts of dark despair will ris» —
Of those who walked the blood-stained way*
To meet their death, with glowing eyes.
’Tis good to think—that Ireland’s call
Can gather still the leal and brave,
For her to give their lives, their all,
And tvin—a soldier’s lonely grave.
Some day a worthier song than mine
Their tale of noble deeds shall tell.
In Ireland’s heart their names shall shin *;
God rest them all! God rest them well!

SIXTEEN DEAD MEN
(In Commennoratkm of the Executed Leaders of 1916).
\_JARK! in the still night. Who goes there?
“Fifteen dead men.” Why do they wait?
“Hasten comrade, death is so fair.”
Now comes their Captain through the grim gate.
Sixteen dead men! What j on their sword?
“A Nation's honour proud do they hear.”
What on their bent heads? “God’s holy word ;
All of their nation’s heart blended in prayer.”
Sixteen dead men! What makes their shroud?
“AU of the nation’s love wraps them around.”
Where do their bodies He, brave and so proud?
“Under the gallows-tree in prison ground.”
Sixteen dead men! Where do they go?
“To join their regiment, where Sarsfield leads;
Wolfe Tone and Emmet, too, well do they know:
There shall they bivouac, telling great deeds.”
Sixteen dead men! Shall they t,return?
“Yea, they shall pome again, breath of our breath.
They on our (Nation’s hearth made old fires bum.
Guard her unconquered soul, strong in their death.”

THOU ART NOT CONQUERED YET
THE O’RAHILLY
r T'HOU art not conquered yet, dear land,
■ Thy spirit still is free,
Though long the Saxon's ruthless hand
Has triumphed over thee.
Though oft obscured by clouds of vx>e,
Thy sun has never set;
’Twill blaze again, in golden glow —
Thou art not conquered yet!
CHORUS:
Thou art not conquered yet, dear land,
Thy sons must not forget
The day will be, when all will see
Thou art not conquered yet!
Though knaves may scheme and slaves may crawl,
To win their master’s smile,
And though thy best and bravest fall,
Undone by Saxon guile;
Yet some there be, still true to thee.
Who never shall forget
That though in chains and slavery
Thou art not conquered yet!
Through ages long of war and strife
Of rapine and of woe,
We fought the bitter fight of life
Against the Saxon foe;
Our fairest hopes to burst thy chains
Have died in vain regret.
But still the glorious truth remains,
Thou art not conquered yet!
