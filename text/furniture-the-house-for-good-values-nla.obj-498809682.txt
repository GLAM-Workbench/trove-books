CERTAIN=TEED ROOFING.
Buy
CERTAIN-TEED
ROOFING
and build your own roof. The appli-
cation of Certain-teed is simple. The
4|oictions furnished in each roll makes
it practicable for any careful person to
lay his roof. Care rather than skill is
the important factor. .Certain-teed can
be fixed on any surface, steep or flat.
Certain-teed is inexpensive permanent
—fire-retardent—spark proof—easy to
transport—very light—vermin proof—
more pleasing to the eye than iron.
CERTAIN-TEED is not only a high
quality roof covering, but is excellent
for the floor covering of balconies, bath
rooms, laundry rooms, etc. It is a pro-
per lining to use under roof tiles and
slates which require a waterproof liner,
because of their tendency to break and
fall away. Certain-teed is used exten-
sively for damp-proofing walls and base-
ments. Walls are frequently lined with
Certain-teed, which is one of the best
insulating materials made.
CERTAIN-TEED is an Asphalt Roof-
ing put up in Rolls "36 in. wide by 72 ft.
long,” containing 316 sq. ft., sufficient to
cover a roof area of 200 sq. ft. Nails
and Cement for fixing are supplied free.
We supply Certain-teed in three weights
—One-ply, for temporary work; Two-
ply, for ordinary conditions; Three-ply
for durable permanent service. Certain-
teed Roofing consists of long-fibred
felt, thoroughly saturated with properly
blended asphalt and coated with a rela-
tive harder blend of the same materia!,
which hermetically seals the inner satu-
ration—the life of the roofing—thus
giving it the power of resisting the
action of the elements.
One cf the greatest advantages, and
in many cases the predominant one, is
that Certain-teed is the lowest-priced
permanent roofing obtainable. Accurate
data shows the completed Certain-teed
roof to lie much less in cost than iron,
which is the cheapest of other forms oi
Roofing.
