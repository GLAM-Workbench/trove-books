Question VI. —What are the resolutions of the

Answer—
Reports.—Balance Sheet
THE REPORT OF THE WESLEYAN METHODIST
SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.
This year the Council of the Wesleyan Methodist
Sunday School Union of New South Wales is again able
to report that its operations have been wider and more
successful than for a long time. For this it is very thank-
ful to God, and by it is more encouraged. The following
figures demonstrate this success in some directions :
Number of schools connected with the Union 101, last year 78
Number of schools which participated in the
Examination ... ... ... .i. 91, „ 68
Number of scholars entered for the Exami-
This year an extra silver medal and two additional
bannerettes were awarded. The following schools won the
bannerettes : —Newtown, William-street, Bathurst, Wagga
Wagga, Burwood, Homebush, Glen Innes, and Enfield,
The work of the examiners was very heavy, and they
deserve the gratitude of the Conference and of all con-
cerned. They Avere ReA 7 s. W. Wall, J. G. M. Taylor,
H. Jones, T. F. Potts, E. King and A. T. Huggart, B.A.
The second examination for Sunday-school Teachers Avas-
held this year, but the Council regrets that more did not
take part in it. Only 70 entered, and of these only 42 sat;
25 of them passed, seven in honours. It is gratifying to
knoAV that none failed to secure a pass for the model lesson,
and that the marks for Scripture were high in nearly eA r ery
instance. Many of them needed help in getting up the
text-book. The Rev. E. J. Rodd was the examiner, and
his report indicates the thoroughness and fairness Avith
which he did the Avork, and the Council recognises it»
great obligation to him.


The visitors of the Union have been seen in many of the
schools several times during the year, and have been able
to give advice to some, and to get suggestions which will
be useful to others.
The operations of the Union are yearly increasing, and,,
with the union of the Methodist Churches, will increase
much more at once. The demands upon the time of a
circuit minister who may be the secretary are too great,
especially in connection with the examination, when the
bulk of the work must be done within given time. The
Council is convinced that the time has come when a paid
assistant must be appointed, and it is urging the Con-
ference to help in this direction. The Conrrexional Sunday
School work means so much to our church, and the
necessity for making it more effective is so apparent, that
there should be no difficulty in this.
R. H. Rickard,
Hon. Sec.
REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE SUNDAY SCHOOL
COMMITTEE.
The Conference Sunday School Committee has given
very careful attention to the Sunday School statistics sent
up from the Synods to the Conference of 1902. As the
Synods are courts of review for Circuit Returns, this
Committee feels responsible chiefly for those of the
Districts.
The totals again show a considerable decrease in many
of the most important particulars, and some decrease in
every column but four. The only increases are ;
(1) Number of schools connected with the
Union—increase, 18.
(2) Morning average attendance of Teachers —
increase, 86.
(8) Number of Scholars over 16 years of age—
increase, 477.
Year after year there have been reported decreases in the
number of Scholars, while the number of children in the
State is steadily increasing. This year the decrease, viz., 855,
only partly represents the leakage. In the Sydney District
the decrease for the year is 1,054. Several other Districts
report a decrease ; but the decrease in Sydney and suburbs
is greater than all, and seems to suggest at least one of the
causes, viz., Sunday pleasure-seeking. Indifference to
religion is another cause. To remedy these, there should


oe earnest, godly visitors to the homes of the children.
We also recommend the Conference to again urge the
Quarterly Meetings to regularly consider the questions
relating to Sunday Schools, and to appoint Circuit Sunday
School Visitors, and to give their best attention to the
Visitors’ reports. This year there are so few Circuit
Sunday School Visitors’ Reports that they are useless for
■comparative purposes ; so the defaulting circuits have made
the work of the faithful ones almost useless.
The Committee respectfully asks the Conference to
'Consider also the large number of circuits in which there
are no Sunday School Scholars on the Roll of Membership,
viz., 71. In two of the Districts there are only two circuits
in each returning any Sunday School Scholars as members
■of the Church.
The Committee regrets that the opportunities afforded
by the “ Home Department ” have not been appreciated,
and as widely used, as they deserve. Where it has been
fairly tried in country circuits it has done most valuable
work for that class of our young people which is unreached
by other means.
The Committee recommends the Conference to make the
two following enactments :—(1) The District Synods are
hereby directed to carefully consider the condition of our
Sunday Schools, and to investigate the causes of the yearly
■decreases shown in the statistical returns, especially in the
number of Scholars, and to devise such measures as will
meet the difficulties. The Conference Sunday School
'Committee is hereby empowered to examine all reports on
these subjects, and institute such inquiries as it may deem
necessary, and to report to the Conference of 1903.
(2) That the Conference Regulations (Conference Minutes,
1901, p. 59) relative to Religious Instruction in Public
Schools must be observed, and superintendents of circuits
are hereby directed to ask the three questions therein
prescribed at every Quarterly Meeting.

REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND*
GENERAL COUNCIL.
Owing t(f the last Conference Rally being held on a
Saturdaymight, the numbers and results were not so large-
as for some years past. Nevertheless, an inspiring meeting
was held, and after paying the year’s expenses out of the
collection the sum of £8 was handed to the
Expenses Fund.
The returns of the Wesleyan Societies up to 80th
September, 1901, show a total of 155 Young People’s
Societies, with 4060 members, and 51 Junior Societies,,
with 1341 members. Compared with the previous year’s
report, it is seen that there is an increase of Y.P.
Societies and a decrease of 70 members ; also an increase
of four Junior Societies and 18 members.
The Endeavourers who are returned as Church members
number 2352, or 85 fewer than last year. The percentage
of members of the Church is 58.
According to last General Conference legislation Active
Junior members are to be regarded as junior members of
the Church. Only half of the circuits with Junior Societies
have furnished particulars of “ Active ” Juniors. The
total is 663.
The Committee is thankful for the measure of increase
reported, but cannot regard the general result of the year’s
work as entirely satisfactory.
The Committee recommends the Conference to urge
upon all ministers and officers the supreme importance of
fostering this institution among the young people of the
Church. Experience has proved that the C.E. Society,
when properly worked according to our own rules, is a
most valuable agency for training young Christians to
work for Christ, and recruiting members for the Church.
But it is obvious that this, like every other branch of
Church work, flourishes and furnishes best results when it
has the sympathy and oversight of the ministers and
officers.
The Committee is pleased to report that the Primitive
Methodist Y.P. Societies total 18, with 425 members, of
whom 237 are members of the Church. There are, how-
ever, only two Junior Societies reported, with 89 members
Considerable progress is reported in the United
Methodist Free Church, there being five Y.P. Societies,
with 104 members, of whom 55 are members of the
Church. There are also three Junior Societies, with 86
members, of whom 16 are junior Church members.


The General Council has met quarterly, with an
average attendance of slightly over 20. The meetings
have been occupied chiefly with the consideration of
Reports of Visitors, and Papers on subjects of importance
to Endeavourers. The meetings are invariably profitable
and stimulating, and deserve to be much more largely
attended. Attention is drawn to the fact that members of
our Societies, in addition to the elected delegates, may
attend the Council.
The Council has not been able to secure Visitors for all
the Districts, and further help would be welcomed in this
department.

Sales of Church Property.
The following sales of Church Properties, which were
sanctioned by the Conference of 1901, have been completed
and transfer and conveyance of same to purchasers duly
executed during the year, viz.:—
1. Canterbury (Lewisham Circuit)—Old Church site,
■containing half an acre, situate in Minter Street, in the
Township of Canterbury, Parish of Petersham, County of
•Cumberland, and comprised in Conveyance, dated 18th of
August, 1858, and registered 28rd August, 1858.
2. Turramurra—Old Church site, land situate at
Turramurra, Parish of Gordon, County of Cumberland
(fronting William Street), containing perches; being
lot 12, section “A”, on Deposited Plan 2511, and com-
prised in Certificate of Title, dated 6th September, 1899, —
Register Book, volume 1293, folio 178.
Remarks.
The Windsor Church site, and that also at Wallalong in
the Morpeth Circuit, still remain in an unsettled state. I
have no doubt but that a Torrens’ Title could be obtained
for the former without much difficulty ; but the costs of
the procedure seem to be a bar to the accomplishment of
that desirable purpose for the present.
The settlement of the Albury Church properties has
caused the Rev. John Clifton and the Custodian of Deeds
almost endless trouble. The work of tracing the where-
abouts of the original surviving Trustees, and of ascertain-
ing the places and dates of the decease of others, has
involved much correspondence and delay. No renewal of
the Trust has ever been made, and the Trustees were


appointed by Deed as far back as the year . We are
now, however, within sight of the legal settlement of these
properties.
I have to express my great indebtedness to the Rev.
Joseph Woodhouse for his invaluable assistance in the
important work of Deeds and Trustees’ registrations during
the year.

Custodian of Deeds.

Fifty-three removals were effected, including that of the
Rev. H. J. C. Foreman, 8.A., who was appointed to the
York Street Mission, but was sent to South Africa for an
indefinite period as chaplain to our troops, his place still
remaining vacant.
The removals last year cost £749 12s. Bd., an average of
about £l4 per head, which was about £5 per head less than
the previous year.
Every circuit has fully paid its levy, over two-thirds of
it being in the Treasurer’s hand at the end of July; and
all claims were met as soon as the state of the fund would
allow.

SABBATH OBSERVANCE, TEMPERANCE, Etc.
Question XIX. —What are the resolutions of the
Conference on Sabbath Observance, Temperance,
Public Morals, etc. ?
Importance of the Sabbath.
That this Conference, deeply convinced of the Divine
obligation of the Lord’s Day as the Christian Sabbath, and
of the importance to families and nations of its due
observance, strongly urges all Methodist people to maintain
the utmost fidelity to the requirements of the sacred day,
by conscientious abstinence from secular engagements and
unnecessary travelling, and by careful attention to all
religious duties.
Parliaments and Municipal Councils.
The Conference further urges the importance of electing
to the Parliament and Municipal Councils such persons as
are in favor of preserving inviolate the rest and sacredness
of the Sabbath, and who will earnestly oppose any attempt
to open public-houses on any portion of that day.
Sermon.
That a Sermon on this subject be preached in all our
churches on the last Sunday in June.


TEMPERANCE AND PUBLIC MORALS.
During the past year considerable interest was aroused in
the Temperance question by the advent of Messrs. Francis
Murphy and J. G. Woolley, who conducted most successful
missions in the city and country. The outcome has been
a stronger sentiment created in favour of total abstinence.
Prior to the General Election in July last, circulars were
sent out urging upon the electors to vote for candidates
who would preserve the sanctity of the Lord’s Day by the
closing of shops and the enforcement of the Sunday Closing
Clauses of the Licensing Act. A copy of this circular was
sent to the Premier. A decided improvement is noticeable
in the closing of shops.
A great deal of interest was awakened in consequence of
the revelations made in connection with the “ Tied Houses
Enquuy.” Your Committee passed the following resolution
dealing with the subject:—“ This Committee expresses its
satisfaction at the introduction into Parliament of a bill to
regulate and restrict the bonds and covenants known as
‘ ties ’ in connection with the liquor trade, and in view of
the evidence given before the Select Committee of the
Legislative Assembly on the ‘ Tied Houses Bill,’ earnestly
hopes that such legislation will be enacted as shall
effectively deal with the evils disclosed in that evidence.”
The bill was, however, thrown out by the Legislative
Council.
The main centre of interest during the year has been
created by the opportunity afforded in dealing with that
portion of the city known as the “ Rocks Resumption
Area.” Upon the course of action that should be adopted
there is considerable diversity of opinions. A deputation,
in which your Committee joined, waited upon the Premier,
and asked that the Government would provide for the
entire prohibition of the liquor traffic in the nrea. At a
subsequent meeting of the Committee the following
resolution was passed after a lengthened discussion :
(1) “ Rocks Resumption Area—“ That in the
judgment of this Committee it will be in the
interests of public sobriety and morality that
all the licenses now existing in the area known,
as the ‘ Rocks Resumption’ should be dis-
continued in the re-arrangement of that area.
But it furthermore declares that in the event
of the continuance of any license therein the
principle of ‘ Public Control ’ should be applied
to those licenses, so as to eliminate the element
of private profit; any profit arising out of the
public control to be applied to the establish-
ment and maintenance of recreative and
educational centres.”


Your Committee are glad to be able to report that the
Minister for Public Instruction has carried out his promise
to a deputation to have Temperance Text Books and
Temperance Wall Sheets for use in the Public Schools
throughout the State, and that Temperance has been made
part of the curriculum of the schools.
In conjunction with the New South Wales Alliance your
Committee waited upon the State Treasurer to request
that the following points should be included in the
Licensing Amending Act now in course of preparation by
the Government: —
(1) To extend the existing Local Option Law that
it may apply to all new licenses.
(2) To enact earlier hours of closing on week
nights.
(3 1 To enable Sunday closing to be effective by
adopting the recommendations of the Royal
Commission as to the change of onus of proof
from the police to the publican and persons
found on licensed premises during prohibited
hours, and by giving all policemen the right
to take action.
(4) To enact the non-employment of barmaids, after
reasonable notice.
(5) To provide that public-houses shall be closed on
election days.
(6) To prevent the sale of liquor to children and
young people under 17 years of age as
messengers, as well as for consumption on the
premises.
Your Committee took some share in securing signatures
to a petition protesting against permission being given to
utilise the post-offices for the conveyance of letters and
circulars relating to gambling. The Federal Parliament
passed the necessary clauses, but your Committee has
learned with surprise and regret that the provisions of the
Federal Postal Act, in reference to the stoppage of lottery
letters, are not being enforced as against TattersaH’s
sweeps. This Committee regards those sweeps as being
distinctly inimical to the moral, industrial, and commercial
well-being of the community, and earnestly requests the
Postmaster-General to put the said clauses into force
against the sweeps fund similar modes of gambling without
discrimination or delay.
We note with pleasure, that in the discussion on the
item of opium in the Federal tariff lit, several of the
members spoke strongly, and. voted, in favour of ttie pro-
hibition of the introduction of opium, except for medicinal


purposes. Its prohibition would be a great blessing to the
Commonwealth. We shall continue our efforts to bring
about this most desirable result.
The Committee are painfully aware of the terrible
condition of many of the public thoroughfares of the city in
consequence of street solicitations which is so flagrantly
p rsisted in by many poor unfortunate women. Action is
necessary to suppress this evil, which is so great a menace
to the moral well-being of the young in our midst. The
attention of the Premier and police has been drawn to this
matter repeatedly.
Your Committee is impressed with the fact that the
Bands of Hope, as hitherto conducted, have largely failed
to accomplish the purpose of their institution. The import-
ance of giving definite Temperance instruction to our young
people from the religious standpoint cannot be overrated ;
and we respectfully request the Conference to instruct the
Temperance and Morals Committee of next year to inquire
into the matter, with the view of formulating proposals to
secure the necessary organisation, and the deepening of
interest on the part of our people generally in this matter.
The work of the year has impressed your Committee
with the necessity for increased activity and earnest labour
to effectively deal with matters committed to them for their
special consideration.
Feed. Colwell,
Secretary and Convener.
Sydney, January 7th, 1902.
Local and State Option.
That the Conference adopts and earnestly supports the
principle of Local and State Option without compensation.
Municipal Local Option Vote.
That the Conference recommends our people, in the
exercise of their rights as ratepayers, to take advantage of
the Municipal Local Option Vote to prevent the increase
and renewal of public-house licenses.
Temperance Sunday.
That the last Sunday in November be observed as
Temperance Sunday.
Bands op Hope—Constitution
The Conference calls the attention of Sup erintendents
of Circuits and of the officers and teachers of our Sunday


Schools to the Constitution of Bands of Hope and
and Temperance Societies as contained in our Book of
Laws, and directs that our Temperance organisations be
carried on in conformity therewith.
Sunday School Libraries.
That Sunday School Teachers be recommended to secure
for our Sunday School Libraries and Prizes such books as
teach very clearly the great evils of gambling and intem-
perance, and that the published Catechisms re scientific
instruction be used in our meetings.
The Lord’s Supper.
That the Conference recommends the use of non-
intoxicating wine in the adminstration of this Sacrament.

HIGHER EDUCATION IN FIJI.
That as the scheme already formulated for a High
School for Fijian boys appears to be too expensive for the
limited means at our disposal, and the grant offered by the
Fiji Government is coupled with hampering conditions
that we cannot see our way to accept, and as it is highly
important that provision be made for Higher Education,
we recommend ;
1. That the District Institution at Navuloa be extended
;so as to include one hundred boys chosen pro rata from
•each Circuit in the District.
2 That the income derived from the land at Davuilevu
be allocated to the support of the High School.

School at a salary of £l5O per year and residence.

the Head Master of the Boys’ School.

shall be required to pass an entrance examination, and, in
all cases where possible, shall pay such entrance fee as
may be determined by Synod, but it shall be left to the
discretion of the Superintendent of each Circuit to decide
what scholars may be admitted free, providing that the
number of such free scholars shall not exceed one half the
number allotted to each Circuit.

SUBURBAN METHODISM.
SYDNEY.
That, in view of the rapid increase now going on in the

Church to gird itself to the task and duty of providing its
share of spiritual ministrations to this rapidly growing
population by the multiplication of churches, ministers,
and other religious agencies as fully and as fast as oppor-
tunity permits.
That in the judgment of this Synod it is desirable that
a Metropolitan and Suburban Methodism Extension Fund
be founded as early as possible with a view—
