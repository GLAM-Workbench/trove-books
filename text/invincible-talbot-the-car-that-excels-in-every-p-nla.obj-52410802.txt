TALBOT
The Car with
a Pedigree."


INVINCIBLE
The car thal excels in every
phase of motoring service


CONVINCING evidence of the superior speed and
power of TALBOT cars is conveyed by this
pictorial record of their successes in competitive trials
during the past season.
The fewer events now held, while less prolific of
TALBOT successes than former years, haye intensified
competition, and thus enhanced the. merit of these wins
in the classic hill-climbing and speed trials, open to all
makes of cars, around which motoring interest has most
keenly centred.


THESE successes have a significant value to all who
contemplate the purchase of a car. Our incursions
into the competition field have been with the two-fold intent
of demonstrating the mechanical excellence of TALBOT
cars, and profiting by the experience, which racing alone
affords, to consummate our primary aim in the production
of the most efficient touring car.
No better proof of the TALBOT cars’ fitness for
arduous road service could possibly be adduced than their
consistent triumph in every phase of motoring competition.


THE ONE event, standing out in retrospect, as the most im-
pressive performance of the year, was the historic feat of the
25 H.P. Talbot car in achieving the 100 Miles-in-One-Hour run.
For years the World’s largest and fastest racing cars had striven for this coveted
record without success. At Brooklands on February 15th, the 25 H.P. TALBOT,
steered by Mr. Percy Lambert, made a non-stop run, creating the following new records:—
50 Miles in 29 mins. 2*5 secs. 100 Miles in 57 mins. 49'38 secs.
103 MILES 1470 YARDS IN ONE HOUR.
Beating World’s Records for all types of cars.
These performances have never been approached by a car of equal
engine capacity to the 25 H.P. Talbot (101’5 m/m. bore x 140 m/m.
stroke=4s3l c.c.), and have only been exceeded by cars with engines
of 7602 c.c., and 9048 c.c. respectively. •
Comparison supplies instructive proof of the transcendent efficiency of
the 25 H.P. Talbot engine of standard touring dimensions, aptly defined
by The Motor as “The essence of excellence in high efficiency motors."

“Improving the Breed.”
THE whole of the British Press devoted to or dealing with
Motoring has eulogised the Talbot car when alluding to its
successes in competitive trials, and its exemplary behaviour in
ordinary service. We reproduce two of these comments as being
particularly apropos of this booklet:—
r'HE connection between a racing car and touring car may not at first sight be apparent ; the most
enthusiastic motorist cannot believe that the two types are analogous. A successful racing ear,
however, serves an admirable purpose, in that it shows that those who constructed it have a
profound knowledge of the elements with which they are dealing, and may be relied upon to apply that
knowledge in an intelligent manner to the production of an efficient touring car.” —” The Car Illustrated.”
T VTHERE is the practical object of racing in general ?
W Without racing We should not be driving the excellent cars We own to-day. Ido not
think that it is an exaggeration to say that practically every good point, every extra ounce of
efficiency, every evidence of capacity for withstanding strain we find in our cars is wholly and solely due
to racing—racing on the road and on the track.
All honour, I say, to the cars and their drivers who do one hundred miles in the hour. May they
do more. It is they and their kind who give us good and cheap cars. Their ears are not generally mentioned in
price lists, but they improve the breed of those which are.”—Mr. John Prioleau in the ” Daily Mail.”

Owners' Opinions.
Extracts from a few recent letters of appreciation received from Talbot motorists.
“ I am more than delighted with the running of
the 12 H.P, Talbot. It is marvellous where an
engine of 80 x 120 mjm. gets the power. It goes
up hills like a squirrel up a tree and along the level
like an express train, or when Wanted like a baby’s
perambulator.”
From a Cheshire owner.
July, 1913.
“ The car is still going Well ... I have
had a new torpedo body fitted . . . The chassis
wears out the bodies , . . Car is in regular
hard wear and tear of a country doctor s practice,
and 'always comes home.' ”
From a Cornish Doctor-owner.
January, 1913.
“The ear has steadily improved in efficiency
since I took delivery of it.”
From a Somersetshire owner.
July, 1913.
"My present car has been everything one
could wish for 4 years now, and the gears as good
as when new is sufficient proof that your cars are
made to last.”
From a Sussex owner.
February, 1913.
“Delighted with my 25 H.P, Talbot . . ,
We have never had a stop on the road—not even a
puncture—and the car has been practically every
day on the road for almost 3 years,”
From a Scottish owner.
April, 1913.
"I have to date driven Talbot ears 96,281
miles and the driving has always been a great
pleasure. ... I feel I cannot praise them too
highly.”
From a Berkshire Doctor-owner.
June, 1913.


“It may interest you to know that my ear is
10 years old. It has done 8 years’ constant daily
work in my practice, and has given the minimum of
trouble and the maximum of reliability. The car
has done some 100.000 miles, and I have come to
the conclusion that it is impossible to wear it out.”
From a Worcestershire owner.
April, 1913.
“My 1909 ‘ 12' which last year took me all
the passes in the Dauphigne and Mount Blanc dis-
tricts without a falter has this year been all through
the Dolmite country and over the Stelvio and Simplon
Passes in the same excellent style. She is a most
excellent little car and is so efficient, even at her
advanced age, that I am going to put a more up-to-
date body on her.”
From a Berkshire owner.
July. 1913.
“I consider the finish of my Clement Talbot
Limousine — Body, engine and chassis, most excel-
lent, beating anything of the kind I have seen before.
. , , The car runs beautifully and silently, showing
Wonderful power on hills. ... 7 have been repeat-
edly congratulated on having ‘ the finest car in the
district,’ ”
From a Devonshire owner.
May, 1913.
'' You will be pleased to hear that my ear has
given every satisfaction, and is to-day running as
well, and with as much power as ever. The car
has been much admired, and people are much
surprised at her climbing powers, more particularly
in view of the heavy body with which she is fitted.”
From an Australian owner.
March, 1913.
*' I wish to express to you my satisfaction
with the running of my 12 H.P. ear. I drove*it
last week from Lyndhurst (Hants.) to Chester in
7 hrs. 55 mins., a distance of 224 miles, doing
over 30 miles to the gallon on that run.”
From a Cheshire owner.
May, 1915.
