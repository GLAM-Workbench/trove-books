GENERAL DESCRIPTION
SEDAN
The Chevrolet passenger car for 1951 features a dis-
tinctly new appearance and numerous mechanical refine-
ments. From a completely new radiator grille to longer
lines for the integral fenders in the rear, many details
have been re-styled to create an impression of lower
and longer appearance. With overall dimensions essen-
tially unchanged, however, the Chevrolet remains a
comfortably roomy car that is easy to manoeuvre in
congested areas.
A complete change in the design of the brakes re-
duces, by as much as twenty-five per cent., the pressure
that must be exerted on the brake pedal for a given
rate of deceleration, because every brake shoe is now
self-energized in both forward and reverse motion of
the car. Braking is smoother with less tendency towards
grabbing and greater freedom from brake surge. At the
same time, the bonded linings have even longer life than
before, and all are designed to wear at more nearly the
same rate. Other chassis refinements have resulted in
a reduction in vibrations, and several minor engine
improvements are adopted.
The new model is styled to appear longer, lower, and
wider than before, yet its fundamental lines and overall
dimensions remain virtually unchanged. The improved
appearance results from raised and extended fender
lines in new body rear quarter panels.
The radiator grille is composed of three horizontal
chrome-plated bars which are combined in an interest-
ing, contemporary design. The top of header bar arches
across the grille opening in the same curve as in 1950
but, at the sides, it breaks downward sharply to inter-
sect the centre bar. Below the headlights, the centre and
bottom bars extend on to the fenders and are joined in
semi-circles. The name, Chevrolet, is embossed on the
header bar in script letters which are filled with black
paint.
The inner extensions of the centre and bottom grille
bars are painted Argent Silver as before, but a series of
grooves is added in the surface of the centre bar
extension.
The parking lamps are an important feature of the
styling, since they are housed within the semi-circular
sides of the radiator grille. In this position the lamps
are centred below the headlamps and these are lower
and farther from the centre of the car.
An innovation of the parking lamp design is the small
grille in the inner section of the bright metal frame of
each lamp. The grille contains five vertical slots which
not only serve as decorative details but also admit a
part of the intake air for the body ventilator ducts.
The bumper guards, both from the front and rear of
the car, have a massive base which diminishes above the
bumper to a more slender shape, conforming to the 1951
styling theme of prominent low lines. Mounted on the
same bumpers as used previously, the new guards do
not extend as far from the face of the bumpers but are
the same height as in 1950.
The front bumper guards are joined by a horizontal
tie bar which provides protection for the number plate.
It is similar in appearance to the 1950 number plate
guard. The number plate bracket, however, is attached
to the bumper rather than to the underside of the tie
bar. By this means, the number plate is carried in a
lower position, and does not obstruct the flow of air to
the radiator.
The decoration for the engine hood is of new design,
but consists of an ornament at the front of the hood and
an emblem centred above the radiator grille as before.
Both parts again are chrome-plated die castings.
The hood ornament is a stylized jet aircraft shape
with low, horizontal wings set well back from the front.
The slender nose of the ornament extends the hood top
line, creating an appearance of greater length than in
the previous model.
The Chevrolet trade mark on the engine hood emblem
is set on a large shield at the centre of tapering hori-
zontal wings. Seven, short vertical grooves appear
between the wings above the shield. The surface of the
shield is scored with horizontal lines and painted red,
whereas the trade mark is painted blue inside its raised
frame of chrome.
New fender lines in the body rear quarter panels
enhance the appearance of the sedan. Because the new
fender shape extends farther beyond the back of the
body and is higher at the rear than before, the profile
of the car is changed. Also the high, gently rounded
crown blends smoothly into the body contours.
The bumper is moved one inch, to the rear because
of the added fender length. However, the overall length
of the car is increased only -rs of an inch since the
bumper guards do not extend as far from the face of
the bumpers as in the past.
The shape of the wheel opening in the rear fender is
new to harmonize with the outline of the fender. Instead
of tapering to a slightly lower height at the rear, the
opening is symmetrical. The lower part of the leading
surface of the fender shape is capped with a gravel
shield which is lower and longer than the previous one.
The material of the shield again is black rubber.
The tail lamps are centred on the vertical, back sur-
face of the massive new fenders, increasing the apparent
width of the car and marking the actual width accur-
ately at night. The shape of the tail lamps is a modified
rectangle with a separate reflector button mounted in
plain chrome frame of the light below the red plastic
lens.
A single number plate lamp is located at the centre of
the rear gravel deflector of the sedan. It replaces the
former dual lamps which were mounted on the body
panel below the trunk lid at the sides of the number
plate. To make the new lamp even less noticeable, the
frame around the crystal glass lens is painted to match
the adjacent sheet metal.
Provisions for the number plate lamp are incorporated
in the design of the new rear gravel deflector, which in-
cludes attractive embossing on either side of the lamp
and also fits the contours of the longer rear fenders.
The rear trunk lid handle has the appearance of a
horizontal wing-shaped ornament in which the Chev-
rolet trade mark is the central figure of the design. The
trade mark is painted blue, and five grooves which
decorate the top of the ornament at each side of the
trade mark are painted black. A hollow is cast in the
underside of the handle to provide a hand grip for lift-
ing the trunk lid.
The lock for the rear trunk is mounted flush in the lid
below the handle, instead of being a part of the handle
as before. Its cover is an inconspicuous, bright metal
disc and its keyhole is protected by'the same type of
spring-loaded door as was introduced in the side door
locks of 1950. Serving to deflect rain and snow, the
projecting handle just above the lock provides added
weather protection.
The hub cap styling for 1951 features an enlarged
trade mark which is surrounded by embossed, concentric,
stepped rings. Except for the blue paint on the trade
mark, the entire cap now has a chrome-plated finish, but
the outside diameter is unchanged.

Both front and rear seats are trimmed with genuine
leather and the body interior up to the roof line is
trimmed with durable leather cloth. The headlining is
of woven cotton fabric. The interior colours are chosen
to harmonize with one another.
A dummy knob replaces the hand throttle knob. The
hand throttle has been discontinued as the fast idle
mechanism actuated by the choke control has made it
unnecessary.
There is a two spoke steering wheel with a new full
circle horn ring instead of the semi-circular ring used
in 1950.
The design of the body rear quarters is changed to
accommodate the raised and lengthened rear fender
shape. It retains from 1950 such popular features as the
concealed petrol filler compartment in the left fender
and the depression in the fenders for the ends of the
bumper that gives a neat, tailored appearance to the
rear comer of the car.
The front fenders are retained from the previous
model with changes at the front to fit them to the new
radiator grille. The fender skirts which form the side
walls of the engine compartment are modified in con-
junction with the grille change and, at the same time,
they are re-designed to be fabricated more easily than
before.
The external engine hood release is re-designed to
simplify its operation and to reduce the size, weight and
complexity of the lower lock plate, A single lever now
controls both the lock and safety catch so that the open-
ing of the hood is even more convenient than before.
The lock also is more secure since the locking plate
engages a larger area on the lock bolt than in the pre-
vious model.
The release lever again is concealed by the radiator
grille header bar although, as seen from the front, it
is located slightly to the left of the car centreline instead
of on the right side as in 1950. When the lever is lifted
a short distance, the hood lock is released and, when it
is raised farther, the safety catch is freed so that the
hood may be opened.
Horn mountings: New brackets are adopted which
change the horn positions to maintain clearance with
the new fender skirts and radiator grille. The horns
face each other directly, instead of pointing down to-
ward the inlets of the ventilator ducts, making the horns
less audible from within the car.
COUPE UTILITY
The Chevrolet Coupe Utility for 1951 is available as
an Open Utility with Tonneau Cover, The basic lines are
unchanged from 1950 but the new radiator grille and
mascot give a lower, broader appearance.
A new colour range and several mechanical refine-
ments add to the attractiveness and safety of the Utility.
A large capacity load compartment of approximately
50 cubic feet is constructed of pressed steel. The painted
wood floor is protected by steel skid strips.
Front door controlled no-draught ventilator and ver-
tically sliding door window glasses provide ample ven-
tilation in all weathers.
The doors hinge on the front body pillar with con-
cealed hinges.
Full width seating will accommodate three passengers
and provide riding comfort with good posture.
The interior is trimmed with Polyvinyl Chloride
covered fabric seating and matched coloured fabrics,
which combined with the paint finishes, gives a very
pleasing appearance.
Interior appointments include front seat adjustment,
vacuum wiper motor with dual arm and blade, adjust-
able rear vision mirror, and R.H. sun visor, ash receiver
in the instrument panel, a dome lamp in the roof and
a glove compartment with a hinged door on the left
hand side of the instrument panel. R. and L.H. door
arm rests are available as optional equipment at extra
cost.
The instrument panel and controls are the same as
1950 excepting that on the new model the hand throttle
knob is deleted. This is no longer required because of
the fast idle mechanism on the carburettor.
Safety features include shatterproof glass throughout,
and each door is fitted with a locking device.
A hydraulic lifting jack replaces the mechanical lift-
ing jack and is housed in the spare wheel and tool com-
partment. The jack handle is housed in the space behind
the front seat.
