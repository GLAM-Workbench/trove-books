lurk's Australian (Explorations.
The interior of the great Australian continent has, up to a very recent
period, remained an unknown region, which has never been penetrated by
able explorers. Attempts have been made at different times to traverse its
vast plains; but the difficulties which have been met with have driven
hack the travellers to the abodes of civilisation. Speculation has been
busy in conjecturing 1 the character of the inland country, which sometimes
has been represented as a higii table-land, broken by rocky mountains and
sandy deserts, and sometimes as a vast plain enclosing- an immense lake,
capable of receiving and absorbing the waters which must flow from the
mountain ranges which slope towards the coast. These conjectures have
been superseded by the discoveries which have been recently made by two
bold explorers, who, with two companions, have traversed the interior
from coast to coast, and whose lives have been sacrificed, when far ad-
vanced on their return journey, by the fatal mistakes of their coadjutors.
In the year 1860, the Royal Society of Victoria organised an Explor-
ing Expedition to penetrate the interior of the continent. The leadership
was intrusted to Mr. O?Hara Burke, who had formerly held a captaincy
in the Austrian army, and for some years had been district-inspector of
police in Victoria ; and with him were associated Mr. William Wills, a
young Englishman, who was assistant at the Victorian Observatory, as
astronomer and surveyor to the Expedition, and a select party as associates.
Burke left the Royal Park, Melbourne, August 20th, with camels speci-
ally imported for the purpose, horses, and ample stores of provisions for
twelve months, and proceeded by easy stages to Sandhurst, and thence
to Sandhill, where the party was most hospitably entertained by the in-
habitants of that township before it finally passed the boundaries of Vic-
toria. He then proceeded te the river Darling, and established his first
depot at the Laidley Ponds, now named Menindie, about the end of Sep-
tember ; and selecting a party of eight, he pushed his way rapidly to-
wards Cooper?s Creek, and instructed the other party, whom he left under
the charge of Mr. Wright, to follow his track with the bulk of the
stores.
His journey to Cooper?s Creek, where he arrived November 11th, was
performed without much difficulty. He found that the country was
well watered by winding creeks and large water-holes, whose banks were
frequently lined with box-trees and gum-trees, and often expanded into
flourishing grass-lands. The scenery presented a diversified aspect.
Frequently it was green and luxuriant, with tall, leafy trees fringing the
water?s edge, and sand-hills crested with pink-floweringchrysanthemums;
while in other parts the dry, cracked clay earth, covered with tufts of
coarse couch-grass, and the abrupt flinty hills, gave a barren and dreary
appearance to many miles of the country. Now the party journeyed


tliroug?li extensive gum-forests, and now along sandy wastes; sometimes
they passed through undulating and well-grassed plains, then over rugged
stony hills, and then through vast swampy marshes, where grew the por-
tulac, marsh-mallow, and other water-loving vegetation. They met several
little bands of natives fishing in the water-holes, or feasting on the mus-
sels, cray-fish, and other fish they had caught, and thin coarse cakes of
u nardoo,? or native bread. Crows, cockatoos, crested pigeons, and wild-
ducks rose up at their approach from the gum and orange trees, or from
the thick scrub which covered some parts of their way.
Burke travelled slowly down the creek till he came to a spot where
there was a good supply of water and feed for the camels and horses he
had brought with him; and having fixed a permanent depot here, he re-
solved not to wait for the party he had left at Menindie under the charge
of Wright, but to advance at once into the interior. He selected two men,
named King and Gray, with Mr. Wills as his companion, and left the
rest under the care of William Brahe, in charge of the stores at the per-
manent depot, with orders to remain there till his return, or till their pro-
visions ran short. With six camels, a horse, and about three months?
supply of provisions, the little party boldly bade adieu to their comrades,
and commenced their journey along the banks of the creek, December IC,
1860.
The first seven days?journey conducted them through a finely-watered
country, suitable for pastoral purposes. The extensive flats furnished an
abundance of grass, salt-bush, gum and box trees, and occasionally melons
and cucumbers; the waters abounded in fish and water-fowl; and thus
far only two lofty sand-ridges intersected their path. They met with
several roving bands of black natives encamped by the water-holes, who,
on most occasions, appeared very friendly to them, ofiered them fish, and
wished them fo join in their convivial dances. The men were quite naked,
but the women wore a covering of opossum - skins; and they seldom
carried any weapons, except a shield and a boomerang, used chiefly in
killing rats, which they bake with their skins on and eat. The fish are
of different kinds. There is a small one called ? cupi,? six inches long,
and flat like an eel; the common one, called ? peru;? and a large, deli-
cious fish, weighing from one to two pounds each, called u cawilchi.
The natives exchanged these fish for beads, matches, straps, or old cloth-
ing.
As the travellers proceeded northwards, they crossed a sandy and
stony desert tract of country, which was occasionally intersected by belts
of box-trees and some delightful tracts of pasture-land. They spent
Christmas-day on Gray?s Creek, a beautiful oasis in the desert, first found
by Gray, and then wound their way along the banks of a magnificent
creek, which they explored for five miles, before they stretched across the
open country.
? For the whole of this distance,? writes Wills, u we found not a
break or interruption of water, which appears to be very deep. The


banks are from twenty to thirty feet above the water, and are very steep.
They are clothed near the water?s edge with mint and other herbs, and on
the top of each side there is a belt of box-trees and various shrubs.?
After passing through the stony desert, the country assumed more of
a fertile character; and though the trees were less numerous than they
had been, there was an abundance of grasses and salt-bush, and many
small pine-shaped trees. The camels were greatly harassed by the stony
ground, and often got bogged in the deep shifting sands, which occasion-
ally obstructed their progress along the creeks. The mosquitoes, flies,
and ants which they met with proved very troublesome both to the men
and to the animals; and great ant-hills, varying in height from two feet
and a half to four feet, sometimes covered large tracts of the country.
About latitude 21ï¿½ they came upon a range of rugged quartz hills of an
auriferous character, and found rich pieces of iron-ore scattered over many
of them in great abundance. Some of these hills rose up to a consider-
able elevation, and from the top the travellers gained a fine view of the
surrounding country, which northwards appeared dry and stony. They
also met with a few snakes in their path, one of which was an immense
creature, eight feet four inches long, with a girth of seven inches, and
weighed eleven pounds and a half. They were glad, however, to cook it,
and eat it with their other provisions.
As they drew near to the Gulf of Carpentaria, they found that the
rains had been more abundant in that part of the country than lower
down, thus rendering the ground much more difficult to travel over. The
camels especially were severely tried by it; and when at last they could
scarcely move along the soft clayey soil, Burke and Wills resolved to pro-
ceed towards the sea on foot, and left King and Gray in charge of the
camels and the stores. They started after breakfast, Feb. 9th, taking
with them the horse and three days? provisions, and travelled down the
river -bank, the waters of which they found flowed into the sea. The
ground there was very rotten, and their horse got bogged several times;
and the travellers, leaving the river, which wound to the left, pushed on
for several miles through an open plain ankle-deep in water. They after-
wards came upon an encampment of natives, in a thick plantation, where
they had been digging yams, some of which the explorers secured, and
found them an acceptable addition to their other provisions. Prom the
sand-ridges just beyond the forest they could see the extensive marshes
which lined the Gulf of Carpentaria, intersected with sea water-courses,
upon which hundreds of wild geese, plover, and pelicans were sporting.
They journeyed over these marshes, until they came (Feb. 11th, 1861)
to the channel through which the sea-water entered; but they could not
obtain a clear vievy of the open ocean, though they made every endeavour to
do so. They had, however, discovered a practicable route to Carpentaria,
the principal portion of which lies in the 140 th meridian of east longitude,
and had passed from the south to the north coast with comparatively
little difficulty, and without enduring more than the common hardships of


an Australian explorer. Though their strength and powers of endurance
had been severely tested, they had accomplished the object they had con-
templated ; and they prepared to return home with joyful hearts, to
receive the honours of a triumph, little thinking of the difficulties which
awaited them, and of the sad termination to their explorations,
Burke and Wills rejoined their comrades with the camels and stores,
and set out on their return journey. They now encountered many severe
storms of thunder and lightning, and heavy rains, which, though par-
tial, often made the ground so boggy that the camels could scarcely
walk over it. The sultry atmosphere greatly oppressed both men and
animals 5 and in some districts the mosquitoes and ants scarcely gave
them a moment?s rest. They met with many disasters when near latitude
20ï¿½ on their return journey. They ost one camel in a bog, out of which
it was impossible to dig him; Burke was attacked with dysentery, which
he attributed to his eating the flesh of a serpent; and Gray was taken
exceedingly ill. They still, however, pressed on, now through slimy mud,
and now over well-grassed pebbly plains, halting where they could secure
the best shelter from the drenching rains, and where they could obtain
feed and water for the beasts. When they had passed the tropic, they
discovered that their provisions were getting very short, and that they
must reduce their daily allowance to enable them to reach their depot at
Cooper?s Creek. The camels, too, were showing signs of great weariness,
and could only proceed at a very diminished pace. The nights were very
cold, and the days sultry; the rains often extinguished their fires ; and
their clothes were both worn and torn. Their progress was so slow, and
their provisions were so rapidly decreasing, that when another camel gave
up, and could proceed no further, they killed it, cut up the flesh, and
dried it, to eke out their slender stock of food; and they did the same to
the horse, when at length his strength failed.
Mr. Wills says: ?We remained in camp all day to cut up and jerk the
meat of the horse Billy, who was so reduced and knocked up for want of
food, that there appeared little chance of his reaching the other side of
the desert; and as we were running very short of food of every description
ourselves, we thought it best to secure his flesh at once. We found it
healthy and tender, but without the slightest trace of fat in any portion
of the body.?
When a third camel shortly after died, the travellers were obliged to
leave many of their stores behind for want of a beast to carry them.
Though reduced to great extremities, they pushed on with their utmost
speed towards their depot. Their chief food now was the dried flesh of
the animals they had lost, and the vegetables they gathered on their way.
Their exhausted natures were rapidly sinking; and four days before they
reached their depot, Gray sank down and died, and was buried by
his companions in the sand. The hope of meeting their comrades at
Cooper?s Creek cheered on the survivors; and with slow and painful
journeyings they reached their depot at eventide, April 21st, but only


to find their associates gone, and tlie place deserted. Wills writes in his
diary:
11 Our disappointment at finding the dep6t deserted may easily be
imagined: returning in an exhausted state, after four months of the
severest travelling and privation; our legs almost paralysed, so that each
of us found it a most trying task only to walk a few yards. Such a leg-
bound feeling I never before experienced, and hope I never shall again.
The exertion required to get up a slight piece of rising ground, even
without any load, induces an indescribable sensation of pain and helpless-
ness, and the general lassitude makes one unfit for any thing. Poor
Gray must have suffered very many times when we thought him sham-
ming. It is most fortunate for us that these symptoms, which so early
affected him, did not come on us until we were reduced to an exclusively
animal diet of such an inferior description as that offered by the flesh of a
worn-out and exhausted horse.?
All the provisions Burke?s party had, when they arrived at Cooper s
Creek depot, consisted of a pound and a half of dried flesh; and on
looking about for any stores Brahe might have left for them, they found
marked on a tree the word ? Dig.? They speedily searched, and found
a most welcome supply of provisions, but no clothing, which they greatly
needed, and a bottle containing papers, which informed them of the de-
parture of the reserve party only a few hours before the exhausted ex-
plorers had arrived. They were then too weak to proceed in pursuit of
Brahe; and the strength of the remaining camels was nearly exhausted.
Their only chance of life, therefore, was to rest and recruit their strength
with the stores they had discovered. Finding that their provisions would
not be sufficient to carry them to the Menindie, they resolved to attempt
a shorter route to some settlements near Adelaide, via Mount Hopeless;
and after staying a few days to refresh themselves, they started on their
adventurous journey, with two camels and all the stores they could carry.
They were greatly distressed for clothing, which caused them to feel more
intensely the heat by day and the cold at night. They generally found
the natives, when they met with them, very friendly, and often procured
from them fish in exchange for straps or beads. For a short time their
progress was slow, but pleasant; and their strength and spirits revived
under the influence of the better food they now obtained. Their pathw ay
soon, however, began to g?row dark and perplexing. After seven days
journeying, one of the camels got bogged in a quicksand; and though
they tried for a whole day to extricate him, they were at length obliged
to shoot him and cure his flesh. The loss of a burden-bearer was a
very serious calamity, for it necessitated them to leave many things be-
hind, even after making a heavy load for the sole remaining camel, and
a a swag? of twenty-five pounds? weight for each man.
Their difficulties were shortly increased by their uncertainty as to the
path they had chosen. The creek, which they had expected to find flow
southward, branched out into earthy plains and disappeared ; and they


were so wearied with their explorations that they were obliged to rest for
a few days, even though every delay was increasing their danger, till they
could gather sufficient strength to attempt to cross the open country south-
wards. While the camel was resting, Burke and Wills went in search of
the native camps, to obtain from them fish, and find out how the nardoo
grew, that, in case of need, they might resort to the native supply of food.
The natives behaved very kindly towards them, and gave them a part of
what provisions they had, and entertained them hospitably. On one of
these occasions, when Wills was alone, they invited him to their hut, or
? guuyah,? and supplied him with plenty of fish and nardoo, and a couple
of nice fat rats. ? The latter,? says Wills, u I found most delicious.
They were baked in the skins.?
Their condition now was very perilous. Wills writes in his diary :
? The rations are rapidly diminishing; our clothes, especially the boots,
are all going to pieces, and we have not the materials for repairing them
properly. The camel is completely done up, and can scarcely get along*,
although he has the best of feed, and is resting half his time. I suppose
this will end in our having to live like the blacks for a few months.?
Soon their last camel fell down exhausted; and finding* it was impos-
sible, in their weak state, to go on, they resolved to return to Cooper?s
Creek, and live in the best way they could, with the hope of relief being
sent to them there.
It speedily became to them a great struggle for life. For some time
they could gain no intelligence from the natives where the nardoo grew;
and they lost their few remaining stores by a fire which accidentally burnt
down their ? g?unyah.? While one of them was searching for the natives
to obtain fish, King came upon a flat where he discovered the long-looked-
for nardoo. It is a small flowerless plant, with green foliage, resembling
clover; and on the top is a spore-case containing hard oval seeds, which
are crushed into flour and made into cakes by the natives. They rejoiced
greatly at the discovery, and immediately fixed their camp there; and
every day two went out to gather the seeds, while the other staid at home
to pound. It was, however, weary work, and they scarcely had strength
left even for that. Occasionally they obtained a few fishes; and Wills
relates the joy he once experienced when, on coming to a water-hole, he
found a large fish, which was just being choked by attempting to swallow
another which had stuck in its throat. Every da} 7, they grew weaker;
and soon Burke was scarcely able to pound, or Wills to gather it. The
natives, too, had now moved away, and there appeared to be nothing
before them but starvation; for though there was plenty of nardoo, they
could gain little nourishment from it, even if the} r had strength to gather
and prepare it. Wills writes, June 23 :
?lam so weak as to be incapable of crawling out. King and Burke
are rapidly getting weaker. The cold terribly cuts us up, from the small
amount of clothing we have. My wardrobe consists of a wide-awake, a
merino shirt, a regatta-shirt without sleeves, the remains of a pair of


flannel trousers, two pairs of socks in rags, and a waistcoat of which I
have managed to keep the pockets together. The others are no better off.
Besides these, we have between us, for bedding, two small camel-pads,
some horsehair, two or three little bits of rag and pieces of oil-cloth
saved from the fire.?
After anxiously considering what was best to be done in their forlorn
condition, Wills urged that Burke and King should leave him, with a
supply of nardoo, water, and wood close to him, and go in search of the
natives, as the only chance of saving their lives. He gave Burke a letter
to his father and his watch, and buried his diary; and urged King, if he
survived Burke, to carry out his last wishes. The two other travellers,
bidding their comrade adieu, dragged their weary legs along the native
foot-tracks. Burke suffered great pain in his back and legs; and on the
second day after leaving Wills, he was obliged to halt. He could proceed
no further. King went out and collected some nardoo, with which he
made a supper for his leader, who, though he ate it, appeared to be get-
ting worse. He said he felt convinced he could not last many hours;
and giving King the watch and the notes of the journey, he said to
him:
? I hope you will remain with me here till lam quite dead: it is a
comfort to know that some one is by. But when lam dying, it is my
wish that you should place the pistol in my right hand, and that you leave
me unburied as I lie.?
That night he spoke very little; and on the following morning he was
speechless, and died about eight o?clock.
King remained with him a few hours, and then, rousing himself to
provide for his own safety,' he went in search of the natives. He felt
lonely, and weak, and sad, and slept at nights in the deserted native
gunyahs, in one of which he had the good fortune to find a bag of
nardoo sufficient to last him a fortnight. He then returned to Wills,
whom he found dead, and stript of his few clothes by the natives. He
buried him in the sand, and remained there alone some days; and then
he tracked the natives, who had taken away the clothes, to their camp
by their foot-prints in the sand. They were not far off, for the report of
his gun, when shooting a crow, brought them to him. He went along
with them, and they gave him fish and nardoo, and provided him a
dwelling; and he shot crows for them in return for their kindness to-
wards him. They manifested the greatest sympathy towards him when
they understood that both his companions were dead, and that he was
alone on the creek. After a time, however, they began to get tired of
him, and wished him to depart; but he gave them to understand that he
should not do so, and he still further pleased them by a cure he effected
on one of the women. King says:
? The same day one of the women, to whom I had given part of a
crow, came and gave me a ball of nardoo, saying that she would give me
more, onty she had such a sore arm that she was unable to pound. She


showed me her arm, and the thought struck me that I would boil some
water in the billy, and wash her arm with a sponge. During- the opera-
tion the whole tribe sat round, and were muttering one to another. Her
husband sat down by her side, and she was crying all the time. After I
had washed it, I touched it with some nitrate of silver, when she began
to yell, and ran off crying out, 1 Mokow! Mokow !? (Fire! Fire!). From
this time she and her husband used to give me a small quantity of nardoo
both night and morning, and whenever the tribe was about to go on a
fishing excursion, he used to give me notice to go with them. . . . Every
four or five days the tribe would surround me, and ask whether I in-
tended going up or down the creek. At last I made them understand
that if they went up, I should go up the creek, and if they went down, I
should also go down ? and from this time they seemed to look upon me
as one of themselves, and supplied me with fish and nardoo regularly.
They were, however, very anxious to know where Mr. Burke lay; and
one day when we were fishing in the water-holes close by, I took them
to the spot. On seeing his remains, the whole party wept bitterly, and
covered them with bushes. After this they were much kinder to me
than before j and I always told them that the white men w'ould be here
before two moons; and in the evenings, when they came with nardoo
and fish, they used to talk about the ? white fellows? coming, at the same
time pointing- to the moon. I also told them they would receive many
presents; and they constantly asked me for tomahawks, called by them
1 bomayko.? From this time to when the relief party arrived ?a period
of about a month?they treated me with uniform kindness, and looked
upon me as one of themselves. The day on which I was released, one of
the tribe, who had been fishing, came and told me that the white fellows
were coming; and the whole of the tribe, who were then in camp, sallied
out in every direction to meet the party, while the man who had brought
the news took me across the creek, where I shortly saw the party coming-
down.?
The movements of the relief party can easily be narrated. Brahe had
remained four months at the depot at Cooper?s Creek, where Burke had
stationed him, without receiving- any tidings either from Burke?s party,
who had gone into the interior, or from those who had been left at the
Darling under the care of Wright. Scurvy had broken out amongst his
men; and fearing that his entire establishment would be endangered by
remaining longer at the depbt, he determined to ? plant? a store of pro-
visions and a paper of instructions at the foot of a large tree, on which he
marked the word ?Dig,? and to depart on the 21st of April. Had he re-
mained one day longer, Burke and his party, except Gray, would have
joined him at the depbt, and have been rescued from the melancholy fate
which overtook them. On the 28th Brahe fell in with Wright?s party,
which had been broken down and reduced in their attempt to reach
Cooper?s Creek, and was about to retreat to Menindie. Brahe placed
himself and his party under the charge of Wright, with whom he went


Lack to Cooper?s Creek, while the party rested, to ascertain if Burke Lad
returned, or Lad removed the provisions Le Lad planted; and, most
mysteriously, tLey discovered no signs of Burke?s visit, nor the papers
Le Lad left; and on Lis return, May 12, Le was sent on from Menindie
witL despatcLes to tLe Committee at Melbourne.
The continued absence of intelligence respecting the fate of the Ex-
ploring Expedition Lad induced the Committee to send out a contingent
party, under the command of Mr. Alfred William Howitt, the son of
William and Mary Howitt, the well-known authors, to search after it;
and when Brahe met Howitt, they immediately returned to Sandhurst,
and telegraphed to the Committee the tidings of the losses, and the con-
tinued absence of Burke?s party. The news created the greatest excite-
ment in Melbourne; and with the utmost promptitude Howitt?s party was
reinforced, and instructions given him to proceed with all possible despatch
to Cooper?s Creek, and search for the missing explorers, and, if possible,
to carry relief to them. Alas, while this message was winging its way
to Melbourne, Burke?s spirit was taking its flight into the future.
Howitt pressed on with his utmost speed, and on the 15 th of Septem-
ber 1861 he met one of the band of natives on Cooper?s Creek with whom
Kinp- had been living since the death of Burke and Wills. As soon as
D O
the black saw the ? white fellows,? he began to gesticulate in a very ex-
cited manner, and to point down the creek, calling out 11 Gow! gow !? and
then he ran away to inform the solitary stranger. Howitt shortly after
found King sitting in the hut where the native had placed him.
? He presented,? says Howitt, ? a melancholy appearance, wasted to a
shadow, and hardly to be distinguished as a civilised being but by the
remnants of clothes hanging upon him. He seemed exceedingly weak,
and found it occasionally difficult to follow what he said. The natives
were all gathered round, seated on the ground, looking with a most grati-
fied and delighted expression.?
Howitt remained on the spot ten days, to recruit King before return-
ing. He buried with solemn rites the remains of Burke and Wills in the
spots where they had died, cut an inscription on the two trees which stood
near their graves, and collected the note-books and various little articles,
which were now invested with thrilling interest to all concerned in the
Expedition. Before he left he held a ? palaver? with the natives, and dis-
tributed to them various presents, to reward the kindness they had shown
to Burke?s party, and especially to King. He says:
? This morning, September 24, about ten o? clock, our black friends
appeared in a long procession, men, women, and children, or, as they here
also call them, piccaninnies; and at a mile distance they commenced
bawling at the top-of their voices, as usual. When collected altogether on
a little flat just below our camp, they must have numbered between thirty
and forty, and the'uproar was deafening. With the aid of King, lat last
got them all seated before me, and distributed the presents?tomahawks,
knives, necklaces, looking-glasses, combs?among them. I think no


people were ever so Lapp} - before; and it was very interesting to see how
they pointed out one or another whom they thought might be overlooked.
The piccaninnies were brought forward by their parents to have red ribbon
tied round their dirty little heads. One old woman, Carrawaw, who had
been particularly kind to King, was loaded with things. I divided fifty
pounds of sugar among them, each one taking his share in a Union-Jack
pocket-handkerchief, which they were very proud of. The sugar soon found
its way into their mouths ; the flour, fifty pounds, which I gave them, they
at once called ?white fellow nardoo;? and they explained that they under-
stood that these things were given to them for having fed King. Some
old clothes were then put on some of the men and women, and the affair
ended in several of our party and several of the black fellows having an
impromptu ? corroboree,? to the intense delight of the natives, and, I must
say, very much to our own amusement. They left, making signs expres-
sive of friendship, carrying their presents with them. The men all wore
a net girdle; and of the women, some wore one of leaves, others of feathers.
I feel confident that we have left the best impression behind us, and that
the ? white fellows,? as they have already learned to call us, will be looked
on henceforth as friends, and that in case of emergency any one will re-
ceive the kindest treatment at their hands.?
The party slowly returned home, and King arrived in Melbourne,
November 7, amid the congratulations of the people, to communicate all
the information he can to one of the committee, who is preparing for pub-
lication the incidents and discoveries of this Exploring Expedition. A
party under Howitt has very recently been despatched to Cooper?s Creek,
to bring back the remains of Burke and Wills, in order that the honours
of a public funeral may be rendered to them.
