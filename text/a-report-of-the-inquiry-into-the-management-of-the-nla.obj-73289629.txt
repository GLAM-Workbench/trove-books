THE YARRA BEND INQUIRY.
SUPREME COURT.
CIVIL SITTINGS BEFORE TRINITY TERM.
Old Court-house. ?Wednesday', May 28.
Before his Honour the Chief Justice and a
Special Jury of Twelve.)
BOWIE v. WILSON.
The Attorney-General, Mr. Fellows, and
Mr. Billing, appeared for the plaintiff. Mr.
Michie, Mr. Wyatt, and Mr. Wood, were for
the defendant.
This was an action for libel. Damages laid
at �3,000.
The following gentlemen formed the jury:?
Messrs. John Curran, Roderick Fraser, P. T.
Gonlan, Samuel Davis, William Dodd, Thomas
Welsh, William Stewart, William Routledge,
James Paterson, Leonard Terry, John Wilson,
and Hamilton Jerram.
Mr. Billing opened the pleadings for the
Plaintiff. In this case, he observed, Ro-
bert Bowie was the plaintiff, and Edward
Wilson the defendant. The declaration
contained counts on three libels published
by the defendant on the plaintiff, in his
office of surgeon-superintendent of the Yarra
Bend Lunatic Asylum. The defendant had
pleaded eleven pleas, containing what he
1 termed justifications of these libels. Issue had
been joined on the part of the plaintiff, and
this was the question which the jury would
have to try.
The Attorney-General stated the case
for the Plaintiff. He begged to observe,
as introductory to the libel which fie was
about to submit, that Dr, Bowie Arrived
in this colony in 1852, having had at
home considerable experience in the treat-
ment of lunatics, having held the appoint-
ment of inspector of lunatic asylums in sev-
eral parts of England, and having had parti-
cularly the inspection of the lunatic asylum
in St. Catherine?s parish, London, and the in-
spection of lunatic asylums and pauper work-
houses for the General Board of Health. He
arrived here at a time when, owing to the
gold mania, people were in a considerable
state of excitement; society had not settled
down, and Dr. Bowie found a vast number of
persons, who from various causes, were labour-
ing under mental disease. His services were
engaged for the purpose of superintending the
treatment andmanaginggenerally the lunatics
to be confined in the Yarra Bend institution.
He was entirely placed under the superinten-
dence of the chief medical officer, Dr. M'Crea.
In 1858 and 1859, certain newspaper pai agraphs
and articles were published, relating to what
was alleged to be the anomalous state of
things existing in the institution. Of course,
Dr. Bowie had been unable to procure all the
appliances existing in a more civilized state
of society, but there was no objection on his
part to a full and searching investigation,
with a view to carrying into effect the various
ameliorations suggested. Accordingly, a
Committee of the Legislative Assembly was
appointed to inquire into the working of the
institution. That committee brought up a
progress report in June, 1861. The committee
had taken considerable evidence ?the evi-
dence of persons making charges with regard
to the management of the establishment by
Dr. Bowie ?and this progress report was made
with the view, as stated by the committee,
that Dr. Bowie should bring forward his wit-
nesses to meet these various charges, and
either deny or explain them. After this
progress report had been brought up, The
Argus newspaper, without waiting for the
calling of witnesses on behalf of Dr. Bowie
and his management of the institution,
thought proper to issue a series of articles,
which formed the subject-matter of the pres-
ent action. The first article appeared on the
10th September, 1861, and was as follows :
? Events occur now and again painfully re-
minding us that in the picturesque bend of
the Yarra, from which it takes its name, there
still exists, with all its horrors, as far as the
public knows, the lunatic asylum, and, with
all his weaknesses and incompetency?to use
the mildest terms we can call to mind?the
manager, Mr. Bowie. An inquest, reported in
The Argus the other day, is one of these.
True, no fact which, considering that the sub-
ject of the inquest died at Yarra Bend, can be
said to be of marked atrocity, came to light.
The verdict merely declared that ? the jury
are of opinion that the evidence of Dr. Callan
is unsatisfactory, and they beg to draw the
attention of the Government to the deposi-
tions taken on this inquest, as the evidence
materially affects the interests of the
patients in the Lunatic Asylum; and
they would suggest that, for the future,
the post-mortem examinations of persons
dying in the asylum should be conducted
by medical men not connected with it.?.
This verdict was the result of the evidence of
Mr. Rudall being directly at variance with
that of Mr. Callan, who, in a post-mortem ex-
amination, had been assisted by Dr. Bowie
and one of the attendants.? So that this in-
quest proves only what all people knew be-
fore, that Mr. Bowie is singularly unfit to
occupy the position he holds in the Asylum.
But inasmuch as Mr. Heales is the particular
friend of Mr. Bowie?to oblige whom, and to
prevent troublesome interference with whom,
he made it one of his first acts on coming
into office to remove the asylum out of the
medical department altogether, and so freed it
from all intelligent or authoritative control ?
Mr. Bowie will probably remain surgeon-
superintendent of Yarra Bend so long as Mr.
Heales remains Chief Secretary. Not the less
is it our business, however, to keep the public
informed of what goes on under the conniv-


ance ?for, after all that had previously come
to light, it is nothing short of connivance?of
the head of the department to which Mr.
Heales and Mr. Bowie doth belong.
? The progress report of the committee ap-
pointed to inquire into the condition and ma-
nagement of the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum
having been brought up some three months
since, with the evidence taken, ? for the pur-
pose,? we are told by the committee, ?of ena-
bling Dr. Bowie to bring forward such evi-
dence as to the allegations therein as he may
think fit,? we are curious to know what evi-
dence Mr. Bowie has thought fit to bring for-
ward, for this report certainly brings to light
many of the ugliest facts in the ? manage-
ment? of a public institution ever man had
to reply to. It is positively sickening to read
evidence to be found in almost every page of
this report. Were its suppression consistent
with our duty to the public, and especially to
the unhappy portion of the public that finds
its way to this den of horrors, no sentence
from this book would ever soil our columns.
There is sometimes danger, in cases of this
kind, of a journalist losing his temper, and
so heightening the colour of the facts he
speaks of, or exaggerating their importance.
We have the satisfaction, at least of knowing
that we shall not be obnoxious to this charge
for what we now print. The desire to do jus-
tice to those who suffer under the ? care? of
Mr. Bowie warns us not to comment upon or
? write up" facts, the effect of which would be
only lessened by the attempt. They shall
stand in their own naked ugliness. We shall
confine ourselves strictly to the very words of
the witnesses, and defy the most imaginative
mind wielding the most powerful pen to add
anything to their force. The evidence given
to the progress report ordered by the Legisla-
tive Assembly to be printed June 14, in the
present year, is now made public for the first
time. It was taken during the sessions 1858-9
and 1859-60, and at two short sittings on May
17 and June 12 in the present year. The state
of things described by the various witnesses
may not exist in its hideous entirety now. Mr.
Heales, who was a member of the committee,
probably kept his friend tolerably well in-
formed as to the revelations made before it.
But with this we have nothing to do. We
only know that certain acts were done, a cer-
tain state of things existed, and that Mr. Bowie
still holds the place he did while these things
were. We now turn to the evidence, and shall,
as we have said, take the very words used
by the witnesses.
? One patient was kept under continual re-
straint day and night, in a strait-waistcoat by
day and a canvas bag by night, until he sank
under it. The strait-waistcoat was composed
of the strongest canvas, fastened close around
the neck, the arms being placed in as usual,
and three padlocks applied from the nape of
the neck to the loins. The arms were pad-
locked generally behind the shoulder blade,
and twisted round, and the hands drawn up
and padlocked, causing excruciating agony at
times, as it suited the attendant?s views at the
moment. Let any one of our readers try this
upon one of his friends for half a minute, and
his friend will be able to give him some idea
of the excruciating suffering spoken of. The ,
bag was composed of the same canvas, with *
slight pockets at the sides, in which the arms "
were placed, keeping them close to the side, ?
and this fastened closely round the throat by
means of lacing behind, and the whole was 1
quite waterproof. It was quite tight?not in ,
any way to interfere with the breathing, but ,
so tight that the vermin could not enter to
the remainder of the body; a patient so laced
up was never bitten about the body, but was
bitten about the head constantly by vermin.
The words used to describe the condition of
this bag and its human contents in the morn-
ing, after being sewed up all night, we cannot
here print; any one bearing in mind that it
was waterproof, and enveloped the whole body
except the hands and head, will, we fear, find
no difficulty in supplying them. One patient
so laced up, who didn?t sink under the treat-
ment, complained to the visitors, Dr. M?Crea,
Dr. Barker, and another, and was directed to
make a written statement. He did not do so,
because a quarter of an hour afterwards that
is, after making the complaint?he was put
under restraint. Morgan Irwin came to him,
and stated it was by the doctor?s orders. Prior
to this date, he had been upwards of a year
wandering about the grounds of the asylum
without the supervision of the attendants, on
giving a pledge that he would not attempt to
escape. When Morgan Irwin came and said
it was by the doctor?s orders, he, the patient,
was walking in the space connected with the
cottages. Irwin came and said, ? I wish to
speak with you ? He led him half-way to-
wards the stone building, and then said, Do
not become excited; I have instructions from
Dr. Bowie to lock you up.? With some little
trouble, the patient was allowed to return
with Irwin to the cottages that he might pack
up his books and clothes, lying about the
room he occupied. They were taking tea in
the cottages, and the patient mentioned to
the attendants in charge of the cottages that
he was about to be removed to the stone
building by Morgan Irwin by Mr. Bowie s
orders, and he wished them to take notice
that he was not excited, and that he went
without any difficulty, merely protesting
against the order. He was kept in a solitary
cell for four or five days without leaving it?
that was from the 6th to the 10th or 11th of
July; and between that date and the 7th or
Bth of September occupied the same ward,
and was constantly in the one cell and in the
refractory yard. He was removed from the
cell to the refractory yard, and back to the
cell again. A former attendant in the asylum
gave the following evidence during a lengthy
examination, which elicited numerous other
facts scarcely less revolting :
? ? The condition of some of the wards was
very filthy, was it not ? ?Extremely so at the
time I was there. How? ?On one or two oc-
casions I remained in the day, on purpose to
oblige Mr. Goode, and I undertook to wash the
patients and put them to rights, and I began to
dress, and I found the patients were in a very
shocking state; and I know they never were
washed?those that lay in bed, I mean. 1 he
others might wash themselves if they could,
but those that lay in bed never got washed,


?,nd I found with many of them the beds were
sticking to the floor, and their backs were
sticking to the hed with filth and vermin;
and one of the patients was a complete mass
of maggots in consequence, and several of
them were very bad. The patient th at I allude
to, Watson, he made the remark that it was
the first time he ever saw the patients put to
rights. What do you mean by vermin? ?
There were a great many lice; but what I
spoke about was the maggots that were on
this patient. Were there many bugs?? Yes,
a good number of bugs. It was impossible for
a man to keep himself free from lice at that
time. Then the condition of the patients
must have been very horrible ? ?lndeed it was.
Had you any instructions given to you as to
your management of the patients ? No; _ I
never saw Dr. Bowie. I was there for six
months in the night, and I never but on one
occasion saw him round the wards, so that he
did not know whether I did my duty or not.?
? The same witness, being asked why he left
the asylum, answered ?
? ? Because I did not wish to conform to
Dr. Bowie?s rules. He made an order that the
night attendants, and, in fact, none of the
attendants, should leave the establishment
either day or night; and I considered that if
I was on duty at night, I had a right to go
away in the day time. He would not allow
it, and so I left on that ground. There was no
place to sleep in or to eat in; for the last time
I offered to eat there, the place was so dirty I
could not do so. I went into the keeper?s
room to reach a pannikin off the shelf, and in
the pannikin there was a man?s brains,
brought from the dead-house and left there.?
? These are a few samples of the facts with
which this report teems. We may observe
that they are all taken from two pages at the
commencement and two about the middle of
it. They do not form a tithe of those which
have forced themselves upon our notice during
a very brief examination. But as we shall have
occasion to return to the subject, we gladly,
for a while take leave of Mr. Bowie and
the disgraceful establishment under his
charge,?
Now he (the Attorney-General) did not for a
moment claim to deny, on the part of the
public journalist, the right to exercise a fair
criticism on the acts of public men, and on
the treatment and management of an insti-
tution like this; but when a journalist under-
took, in the middle of an inquiry?before
witnesses had been called on the other side ?
not merely to put forward evidence in the
columns of his paper, but to deal with state-
ments made by witnesses whose evidence he
(the Attorney-General) would probably show
the jury was utterly worthless, and draw his
own conclusions therefrom?if a journalist
chose to take that stand, and assume things
to be facts merely on an ex parte statement,
he must take the consequences. And if the
statements put forward in the article which
he had read were baseless and without founda-
tion, he apprehended that no -grosser libel
could have been perpetrated on any man than
had been committed in this paper on Dr.
Bowie. The second libel appeared in The
Argus of November 20,1861, and was to this
effect:?
? We trust the authorities at the Yarra Bend
Lunatic Asylum will be able to put us in a
position to contradict some very ugly rumours
prevalent as to a child to which one of the
female patients has recently given birth.
Surely quite sufficient odium already attaches
to this institution, without its being obnoxious
to so gross a scandal as these rumours im-
ply.?
What foundation there was for this state-
ment it would be for the other side to show.
The jury would, however, perceive that a
succession of attacks had been levelled at the
Yarra Bend institution and Dr. Bowie, and
the secret springs which put all this in motion
would probably be developed in the course of
the trial. But not content with this, The
Argus, on the 23rd November, 1861, published
the following article: ?
? If, in an inquiry before a coroner's jury,
the point in question rests solely upon medical
evidence, and that evidence differs, it is na-
tural to presume that the jury, in arriving at
their verdict, will be guided by the evidence
of the majority of the medical men, unless
the minority is very manifestly entitled, by
the professional reputation of the witnesses,
to greater weight than that of the majority.
If the majority are also each individually of
higher standing than the minority, and, fur-
ther, may reasonably be supposed to be im-
partial, while the minority are almost neces-
sarily disposed to be influenced by self-interest
in the matter, we have an undoubted right to
express our surprise if the verdict be given in
accordance with the evidence of the minority.
Yet the verdict of the jury, at an inquest held
at the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum, on Tues-
day last, is clearly thus given. The evidence
of three medical men, of high reputation, and
whose opinion would naturally be unbiassed,
is altogether ignored, and that of two gentle-
men, of no professional reputation at all ?
unless the word be used ip an obnoxious sense
?is taken as final, and the verdict given upon
it. It was found, on a post mortem exam-
ination, that the subject of the inquiry, who
had been in the asylum about ten weeks, be-
sides other unmistakable marks of violence,
had three ribs fractured. Dr. M'Crea, Mr.
Rudall, and Mr. Thomas asserted that the in-
juries must have been inflicted after the ad-
mission of the deceased to the asylum. The
first was of opinion that ? the fractures could
not have taken place three weeks ago; ? the
second thought them ? recent,? 1 within ten
days, or thereabouts,? and thought they 1 could
not have existed for two months;? the third
believed the ribs ? not to have been fractured
beyond twelve days or a fortnight.? These
were the opinions of the majority. The min-
ority?Mr. Bowie and Dr. Callan ?both di-
rectly and personally interested in showing
that the injuries did not take place while the
deceased was in the asylum?gave contrary
evidence. The first was of opinion that they
were ? not recent,? and existed before the ad
mission of the deceased into the asylum; the
second believed the rihs ?to have been frac-
tured for a considerable period?for three or
six months,? The fractures were re-examined


by the witnesses after having given this evi-
dence, and each adhered to his opinion, Now,
will it be supposed that an intelligent jury,
after ? attentively considering ? this evidence,
could reconcile it with their consciences to
return a verdict in accordance with that of
the minority? We suppose we must believe
them to have done this, since their verdict
was, ?that Patrick Mullens died in the Yana
Bend Lunatic Asylum, from dysentery, and
from injuries received previous to his arrival,
but by whom inflicted they were not able to
say.? So much for the value of surgical evi-
dence in the eyes of a jury.
? As concerns the culpability of the authori-
ties of the asylum, it seems to us to matter
very little whether the injuries were received
before or after deceased unhappily fell into
their hands. The jury declare that death
resulted from death ? and from injuries,? If
those injuries were received prior to admission,
then the patient must for ten weeks have been
dying from injuries, of which the authorities,
whose business it was to examine him, and
in whose hands his life rested, acknowledge
their entire ignorance. We do not see that
his death rests less directly upon them if he
was admitted thus fatally injured, and they
took no pains to make themselves acquainted
with his condition, than if the injuries were
inflicted by their hands, by their orders, or
through their negligence. They cannot escape
one horn of the dilemma without falling upon
the other. The patient was treated either
with gross cruelty, resulting in fatal injuries, or
with gross neglect?whatever the period of
time that elapsed between his death and the
infliction of the injuries, which, the jury says,
helped or hastened his death. This being
self-evident, inquiry into the case should not
be allowed to close with the verdict of the
coroner?s jury. The inquiry before the cor-
oner has served only to show that further and
searching investigation is imperatively called
for.
?We must not close these remarks without
demanding, on behalf of the helpless crea-
tures imprisoned in this place, and their
friends, an immediate inquiry into an occur-
rence alluded to in Wednesday?s Argus as sub-
ject of rumour, and which we now repeat as a
matter of fact. A patient in the asylum had
recently given birth to an infant, and the
public have a right to know which of the ser-
vants of the establishment is its father, and
why no report is made of the matter, which
it is attempted carefully to hush up. We
warn any friends having female friends in the
Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum,_ that so long as
this crime remains uninyestigated and un-
punished, they have no guarantee that those
friends are safe from the grossest outrage that
women can be subjected to. Wechallenged de-
nials of the rumours referred to in Wednesday?s
Argus. We now, on public grounds, demand
a searching and unflinching official inquiry
into the matter.
? We take this opportunity of again urging
?this time, we trust, with some chance of
doing so successfully?the necessity of the
appointment of a Royal commission, with full
power to deal with the whole question of the
management of the asylum. Until now, it
ivas obviously futile to combat the strong
Government and Parliamentary interest pos-
sessed by Mr. BoAvie. That interest, it is to be
hoped, is noAv greatly lessened, and the just
and crying claims of the public may obtain a
hearing. We repeat what we have often be-
fore asserted, that a Parliamentary committee
is a body singularly unfit to deal Avith a
matter of this kind. If even its inquiries
Avere conducted with the severest impartiality,
they must necessarily be unproductive of
good. A body should be appointed, Avhose
efficiency and integrity should be unimpeach-
able, and Avhose power should be absolute.
So only can the colony be cleared from the
great disgrace of Yarra Bend as hitherto con-
ducted.?
He (the Attorney-General) repeated that ho
did not complain of any fair or legitimate
discussion with regard to the management of
the institution in question, but what he com-
plained of was that, in the midst of an
inquiry, upon ex parte, evidence, matters
should be put forward in these articles as
matters of fact. Any newspaper proprietor or
publisher who chose to take that course, in
the expectation that he would be able ulti-
mately to justify it, rendered himself liable to
action. The jury must know the effect which
articles of this description must have on the
reputation and standing?if not on the pri-
vate character ?of a man in Dr. Bowie?s
position : because these articles declared that
he was guilty, not merely of wilful negligence,
but actually of wilful cruelty, Thedefendant
had thought proper to place on the record
eleven pleas ?ten pleas of ? Justification ? and
one of ? Not Guilty.? The libels had been
read. It Avould be for the defendant to come
forrvard and justify himself before the Court,
If the defendant?s counsel attempted to sub-
stantiate the pleas of justification by evidence,
it would then bo his (the Attorney-General?s)
duty to meet that evidence with eA?idence on
behalf of the plaintiff. He had studiously
avoided going into the pleas of justification,
or doing anything more than giving a simple
narrative of Avho the plaintiff Avas, who the
defendant was, and the circumstances under
Avhich the present inquiry had come to be
made. Allusion was made in one of the
defendant?s pleas to a progress report made
by the Parliamentary committee appointed to
enquire into the condition of the Yarra Bend
Asylum. He had already stated that that report
was made when only one side was heard. A
number of servants dismissed from the estab-
lishment for misconduct, and a number of
discharged lunatics ?were examined; and the
committee, in bringing up their report, stated
distinctly that they did so in order that Dr.
Bowie might call evidence to rebut the charges
which had been made. Was this a time ?
Avhen only these discharged servants and
lunatics had been examined ?to put forward
the statements which they had made as if
they were all facts? Since the first report
was brought up, he found that another re-
port was made by the committee. It had not
yet been adopted by the Legislative Assembly;
but if a progress report were to be relied upon?
if the defendant?s counsel claimed a right to
put in evidence the fii?st report in justification


of the articles which had been read to the
jury?then the second report ought also to be
put in evidence. He was prepared to admit
the progress report if the defendant?s counsel
would admit the second report; and, as The
Argus was always so anxious and chivalrous
to "meet an opponent fairly in the field, he
hoped that there would not be any objection
to this proposal. He was prepared to lay all
the documents of the committee before the
jury, if any importance was attached to any
of these reports, in order that they might have
the whole matter fully before them. With
these observations, he would now sit down,
leaving his learned friends on the other side
to prove what justification they had for the
libel, after he had, in the first place, established
its publication.
The Chief Justice said he hoped that there
would be no allusion to reports, either on one
side or the other, because they could not be
received in evidence, and the jury must give
their verdict upon the evidence alone. He re-
gretted that reference had been made to the
fact that the matter now for trial, or any por-
tion of it, had been the subject of an inquiry
in another place.
The Attorney-General said that fact ap-
peared in one of the articles containing the
alleged libels.
The Chief Justice remarked that the At-
torney-General had gone much further than
merely stating that circumstance, and had
thrown upon the defendant's counsel the
onus of producing the report of a committee
of the Legislative Assembly. If that report,
however, were produced, he (the Chief Justice)
should stop it, and not allow it to be put in
evidence.
The Attorney-General intimated that his
only desire had been to state that if a report?
was given in evidence at all, both reports
ought to be put in.
The Chief Justice said he should have
stopped the learned Attorney-General in his
speech to the jury, but from his unwillingness
to interrupt counsel in the midst of an ad-
dress. He thought it much to be regretted,
however, that any reference had been made
to a document which could not be admitted
in evidence.
The Attorney-General observed that he
would not have alludud to the report if re-
ference had not been made to it in the alleged
libel.
The Chief Justice said that was no excuse
for alluding to the report.
The Attorney-General said he threw out
the suggestion as to both reports being put in
evidence merely for the consideration of his
learned friends on the other side; and he ap-
prehended that he had a perfect right to do so.
. The Chief Justice replied, that if both
sides consented to the reports being put in
evidence, he would not consent.
The Attorney-General admitted that his
Honour might reject the reports: but he still
apprehended that he had a perfect right to
allude to the matter.
, Mr. Michie then formally admitted the pub-
lication of the articles containing the alleged
libels, and the proprietorship of The Argus.
The Attorney-General? That is our case.
The Chief Justice.?What is your case?
The Attorney-General.?The publication
is admitted.
Mr. Michie then rose to address the jury on
behalf of the defendant. He was sure that the
jury would agree with him when he said, at
the outset, that this case was to be tried upon
other grounds, and tested by other principles,
than the ad captandum tricks at nisi prim,
with which, he had nodoubt, they wercallmore
or less familiar. Nobody knew better than
the Attorney-General that neither the earlier
report nor the later report which had been
published respecting the state of the Yarra
Bend Asylum, could possibly be available in
this case, inasmuch as any attempt at proving
the pleas of justification must necessarily be
supported upon altogether different grounds
than any to be extracted from reports
which had been compiled by other partie
from altogether different and independent
inquiries. He would, therefore, dismiss at
the outset the observation made by the learn-
ed Attorney-General?which certainly ap-
peared like affectation?that he would consent
to the admission of the earlier report, if the
defendant were disposed to admit the latter.
He would dismiss that observation with the
simple remark, that, as far as he had been
enabled to examine and understand the evi-
dence, he believed that it might very well
subserve the purpose of the Attorney-Gene-
ral?s client to offer to consent to such an ar-
x?angement, because, as the jury would know
very well, in the prosecution of an inquiry of
this nature ?whether by a Committee of the
Legislative Assembly or any other body?that
many of those abuses which might have been
detected in the establishment at an earlier
period of the inquiry would be put to rights,
smoothed over, and made more presentable
by the end of tlie inquiry, in order that there
might appear to be a more satisfactory state
of things in a subsequent report. This was
quite possible with respect to an establishment
like the Yarra Bend Asylum : and, with this
remark, he would dispose of the Attorney-
General?s observation as to the reports being
put in evidence, as well as of any value which
might be attached to that suggestion. He
was not there to ask the jury to give their
verdict upon any other than the evidence
which would be elicited before them ?evidence
which they would hear from witnesses who
would be placed in the witness-box, and
which, unless lie was egregiously mistaken,
would satisfy them that the numerous pleas
of justification which had been placed upon
the record would be substantially proved, and
would entitle the defendant to claim a verdict.
He quite agreed with the observation made
by the Attorney-General, that if the allega-
tions contained in the articles which had been
read were ? baseless and wholly without
foundation,? the defendant must take the
consequences of having misrepresented the
character and management of the asylum!
but if, oh the other hand, they were neither
baseless nor without foundation ?if the
jury found, as he believed they would
find, that the whole of these pleas were
substantially supported, and many of them,
he might say, almost to the letter?then,


so far from the plaintiff being entitled
to a verdict, even with a farthing damages,
the jury would feel that they would only be
doing justice to the parties in the cause, as
well as to that larger interest, the public out
of doors, by at once pronouncing a verdict to
the effect that the defendant was justified in
the publication of these articles. He had not
thrown any obstacles in the way of formal
proof. He admitted at once the proprietor-
ship of the paper, and the publication of the
articles, because his client wished to try the
case upon its merits. He (Mr. Michie) was
there to satisfy the jury upon these pleas of
justification, and to show that the defendant,
in the publication of the articles which had
been read, had not merely echoed the report
of a committee of the Legislative Assembly,
or the witnesses who were examined before
that committee, but had simply given a nar-
rative of that which it now devolved upon
him to present before the jury in substantial
proof. The Attorney-General had correctly
stated that a number of pleas of justification
had been put upon the record. At this stage
he (Mr. Michie) did not intend to go fully into
the evidence which he should adduce before
the Court, as it was so voluminous that it
would require several days to systematically
arrange and study, but it would be sufficient
to put the nature of that evidence substan-
tially and generally before them. He would
go over the pleas consecutively, and briefly
state the nature of the evidence which would
be adduced in support of each. The jury
would be informed by his Honour that it
would be necessary for the defendant to offer
some evidence upon each of the pleas of jus-
tification, but not to do more than that.
Prom their experience in law courts the jury
would probably be aware that where a defen-
dant placed a plea of justification on the re-
cord, all that was required was ?either in a
case of libel or any other case?that he should
prove the substance of the issue, as it was
called. It was not to be expected, of course,
that in any case the defendant should be called
upon to prove literally the allegation which
he made, but merely to prove it substantially;
and he believed that the defendant in this
case would substantially and satisfactorily
prove every one of the issues which had been
raised by the pleas of justification. The first
plea was merely formal; and he would there-
fore call attention to the second plea (which
was the first plea of justification), and which
had reference to the case of a person named
Charles Hibbert, a patient in the Yarra Bend
Asylum, and who was incarcerated and
placed under restraint day and night. Hib-
bert, in fact, was confined in one of the
bags to which allusion had been made in
one of the articles which had been read. The
mode of confinement appeared to be this: ?
The patients were locked up in these bags,
upon each of which three padlocks were
placed, and they were kept in that way for
a number of hours consecutively, day and
night. They were not even relieved from the
bags for the ordinary calls of nature. The
consequences of this confinement were suth
as were no doubt distinctly hinted at in che
article which had been quoted, and which
must suggest themselves to every one as in-
evitable from confinement in this way. The
jury would learn from the witnesses all the
particulars relating to this case; and it would
be for them to say whether or not Dr. Bowie
?responsible and paramount controul over
this establishment?was justified in keeping
any inmate confined for a number of hours
under such circumstances. If Dr. Bowie
should be enabled to show, by means of wit-
nesses, skilled or unskilled, that this was not
merely the regular and normal, but the neces-
sary and inevitable, mode in which patients
of this character must be dealt with in similai
institutions?if he could satisfy the jury that
no more reasonable treatment could be
adopted, then he might go on, with a teme-
rity which even his counsel would be hardly
able to exhibit, to say that he was entitled tq
their verdict. If, on the other hand, the jury
were satisfied on the evidence placed before
them, that this, so far from being a necessary
or proper mode of treating patients of this
description, amounted to cruelty, which was
not merely inconsistent with their position,
but wholly unnecessary, and which must be
entirely antagonistic to any remote proba-
bility of cure, then they would agree that the
defendant had made out the substance of that
which he alleged, and was entitled to their
verdict. He would now pass on to the case of
Dr. Alfred Yates Carr, which was referred to
in the third plea of justification. This case
was a peculiar one. Dr. Carr was a gentleman
of education, as implied in his calling of a
medical man, and although at times, no
doubt, excitable, as persons labouring under
chronic or acute insanity would at times be,'
was for very long periods, a perfectly quiet,
manageable, and coherent person, ?a man
who, as they had heard from the Attorney-
General, was allowed to be at large for weeks
and months together. Dr. Carr was similarly
confined in one of these sacks or bags; and
there was this peculiarity in his case, that, on
complaining to one of the visitors of the esta-
blishment, he was remitted from the compa-
rative liberty which he had enjoyed fora con-
siderable time to this cruel form of incarcera-
tion ; not that Dr. Carr had upon the instant
become furiously maniacal ?not that he had
become unmanageable as a lunatic, but sim-
ply because he had complained to the visitor.
He (Mr. Michie) carednot whether this cruelty
was inflicted under the directions of Dr. Bowie
or not. If it was not done under his direc-
tions, Dr. Bowie was not doing his duty?he
was not exercising that surveillance and at-
tention over the establishment which was re-
quired from him ?he was delegating to com-
paratively unskilled and inefficient superin-
tendence that duty which, as director -paraj
mount of the institution, he ought always to
have exhibited towards that unfortunate gen-
tleman. If, on the other hand, the jury should
be of opinion that this was done under the
express personal direction of Dr, Bowie, they
would have little difficulty in determining
that the plea of justification relating to this
case had been substantially made out. The
jury would bear in mind, that in all the pleas
of justification?inasmuch as specific allega-
tions had been made by the defendant against


the management of this establishment ?spe-
cific allegations were made, and specific
allegations would be proved. The fourth plea
of justification refeired to the experience?
which was almost the mildest term that he
could find to designate the calamitous circum-
stances in which a most unfortunate, woman
was placed?of Mrs. Steele, an inmate of
this Yarra Bend Asylum. They had often
seen, playfully used, in the public fournals,
the expression?? What may happen to a man
in Victoria.? The jury would learn from the
evidence to be given in support of this plea,
what had happened to a woman in Victoria.
He should not merely call one, two, or three
witnesses, but he believed he should prove the
substance of this issue by more than four or
live perfectly reliable witnesses. He should
prove that Dr. Bowie, whether he knew or did
not know what happened to this unfortunate
woman at the time, heard of it some time
afterwards, and was then perfectly impressed
with the importance and necessity of suppres-
sing the divulgement of that experience to
the world at large. The evidence would show
that the unfortunate woman became insane
in consequence of acute grief on the loss of
her husband, and that she was sent to the
asylum, and there classified. He supposed he
must use that term. It would be an abuse of
the expression to say that it was a scientific
classification. The classification was only
that which Dr. Bowie apparently recognised
?namely, the classification as between the
quiet and unquiet patients ?the practicable
and the impracticable. Mrs. Steele was in
that position when advantage was taken of
her by a person who was in Dr. Bowie?s em-
ploy at the time, not as an attendant, not as
a subordinate connected with the institution,'
but as coachman. This man, who was de-
scribed as a powerful man, overcame the
resistance of this unfortunate woman, and
she became in the family way. She was
afterwards removed to a house at North Mel-
bourne, and there confined. The knowledge
of this state of things reached her brother,
and his evidence would be presented to the
jury. The knowledge of the circumstances
was possibly possessed by Dr. Bowie before,
but he (Mr. Michie) believed he should be able
to prove that Dr. Bowie had knowledge of her
condition some time after her removal from
the establishment?that Dr. Bowie was driven
in his carriage, he believed by the very coach-
man who was the father of the child, to the
house in which the unfortunate woman was
confined ?that Dr. Bowie was seen to get out
of his carriage for the purpose of making
whatsoever inquiries, or resorting to what-
soever precautions he might have thought
necessary to take with reference to the par-
ticular case. Now, what observation could
be made on a case like that? He put it
to the jury as reasonable men, that that
which happened to this unfortunate woman
might happen to a female relative of
any one of those who were now engaged
in discussing this case. The Attorney-Gene-
ral had referred to the elementary condition
of scietoy in the colony. They had not at-
tained to those private establishments in
which there were modes of treatment of a
more scientific and delicate character than
those which seemed to have obtained at the
Yarra Bend. Therefore, generally speaking,
all cases of insanity must be dealt with at this
institution ; and he repeated that that which
was the experience of this unfortunate woman
might equally be the experience of any re-
spectable woman incarcerated under these
lamentable and distressing circumstances in
an establishment of the kind. Presupposing
that he proved these allegations most satis-
factorily, he asked whether it was fitting for
the conductor of a lunatic asylum to come
into a court of justice and say that this was
an excusable result in such an institution.
If there was one position which he (Mr.
Michie) might more safely take up than an-
other, it was that patients, one and all?be
they of one sex or the other, of one condition
of life or another ?high or low, educated or
uneducated ?in an establishment conducted
by a medical man, and who was placed there
to exercise the skilful and judicious surveil-
lance which, of course, was demandable and
must be had from a person in that position?
should not, under any possible circumstances,
be subjected to such treatment. He could
imagine that there might be the possibility of
something like an excuse, supposing the con-
sequences to this unfortunate female had hap-
pened with one of the attendants of the esta-
blishment. He could, with difficulty, find an
excuse under such circumstances for Dr.
Bowie, although he held that for females there
should be exclusively female attendants, and
that the attendants on the male patients
should be persons of their own sex. But even
that state of things was not open to them.
The father of the child was Dr. Bowie?s coach-
man ?a person who had no right to have
-access to the patients at all, still less had he
the right of any communication whatsoever
with any female inmates of the establishment.
He thought the jury would agree with him
that this case was one of the most monstrous
and revolting that could by possibility occur
in any part of the world. Had any one of
them read of such a case in the country from
which lie had come, what would he not have
been prepared to say ?what measure of de-
nunciation would he not haye been almost
incontinently disposed to bestow on the per-
petrator of such conduct? If _ they could so
feel with respect to such a case in the country
in which they were born, so should they feel
in the country of their adoption, particularly
if they deserved to be recognised as a civilised
community at all. The jury would see by the
evidence that he had not overstated this un-
fortunate woman?s case. The Attorney-Ge-
neral had talked of the secret springs which
had actuated The Argus. The jury, however,
would be rather slow to think that there were
about thirty or forty combinations of dif-
ferent individuals ?for that was about the
conclusion to which they should be precipi-
tated ?in order to damage the reputation of
Dr. Bowie and disparage this establishment.
Every one of the pleas of justification would
be supported by respectable witnesses, who
could be questioned to any extent. The jury
would have the opportunity of judging of the
demeanour of these witnesses, and of seeing


with respect to their testimony, how far theh
might be entitled to confidence, and how fa-
a verdict might safely be pronounced on sury
testimony. Mr. Michie then went on to the
fifth plea of justification, which referred to
one Patrick Mullens, observing that he should
prove the cruel treatment which Mullens rec
ceived at the hands of the attendants at the
Yarra Bend. As he had already stated, Pa-
trick Mullens died in the establishment, and,
as he had not been there long, it was necessary
that there should be an inquest on his body.
Of the sort of inquest which was held, and of
the constitution of the jury, he should have
something to say presently. Mullens had suf-
fered, at some time or other, from injuries
which could only have been inflicted by most
cruel violence. There was no doubt whatever
about the fractured ribs and other contusions
which were found upon his person, and of
course it was inevitable that there must be an
inquiry as to what had been the immediate
cause of his death. It was the interest of Dr.
Bowie, in an inquiry of this kind, to have the
evidence presented as favourably as possible,
since, in any view of the case, grave suspicions
must have arisen as to how far Mullens could
have been properly treated while in the esta-
blishment. It did not matter for the purposes
of the present trial, whether Mullens received
his injuries before or after his admission into
the asylum. If he received them before, why
did not Dr. Bowie, on the admission of Mullins
into the establishment, ascertain the nature
and extent of his injuries, and pay the same
attention to the unfortunate man, as any
other man would have received, under simi-
lar circumstances, if he had been taken into
an hospital. The jury will agree with him (Mr.
Michie) that an institution like the Yarra
Bend Asylum?which was supported at vast
expense to the country?an inmate with a
broken limb or a broken rib ought to receive
the same surgical and medical attendance
which he would receive at the hospital. It
was scarcely consistent with the evidence
which would be adduced to suppose that the
unfortunate man, Mullens, could have re-
ceived even an ordinary examination at the
hands of Dr. Bowie. It was a matter of indif-
ference, therefore, whether Mullens received
his injuries before or after he was admitted
into the asylum. Dr. Bowie might accept
either one alternative or the other, for in
either case there seemed to be just cause
to reflect upon his conduct and management
as respected that unfortunate man. He had
already said that an inquest was held upon
the body of the deceased; and he might re-
mark, in passing, that when he read in the
public journals of inquests taking place at
the Yarra Bend Asylum, the impression on
his mind was, that they were ordinary coro-
ners? inquests. He found, however, on read-
ing the paragraph relating to this particular
inquest, that such was not the case. (Mr.
Wood here made some remarks to Mr. Michie.)
His learned friend, Mr. Wood, informed him,
that the system upon which he was about to
make some observations, had been justaltered,
and that the coroners?juries in such cases con-
sisted of persons who were not connected with
the asylum. Unless this were the case, these
inquiries at the 'asylum were a perfect farce.
He believed, however, that the inquest upon
Mullens was prosecuted merely by a jury con-
sisting of attendants at the asylum, and other
persons connected with the establishment, and
who had a common interest with Dr. Bowie in
giving as favourable a result to the inquiry as
possible. He was not sure whether the jury
consisted entirely of such persons, but if
there was a single attendant connected with
the asylum upon the jury inquiring into
the causes immediately leading to Mullens?
death, the public outside, who were inter-
ested in the proper management of the in-
stitution, had no assurance that one of the
very individuals who might have inflicted
bodily injury upon the unfortunate man, and
caused his death, was not himself sitting on
the jury, and inquiring into the causes which
had led to the death of the deceased? He,
therefore, hesitated not to say, that coroners?
juries, conducted under such circumstances,
and by parties so constituted, were neither
more nor less than a farce, which Dr. Bowie
must have known as well as himself, or any
one else. He repeated, that if even one of
the attendants at the asylum were upon
the jury, the public had no assurance
whatever as to the honesty and propri-
ety of the verdict. The reason why he re-
ferred to this matter was, that the finding
of the jury seemed to be utterly incon-
sistent with the medical evidence. No-
thing Avas more necessary than that ifi in-
quiries of this character there should be satis-
factory medical testimony as to the probable
time at which the injuries were inflicted. In-
ferences more or less reliable were always
derived from the appearance of the body; and
surgeons, on making a. post mortem examina-
tion, were able to give evidence which would
lead to a conclusion as to the time when the
injuries about which they spoke actually oc-
curred ; and it would be learned from the evi-
dence in Patrick Mullens? case that there
was but too much reason to believe that the
se\ r erer of his injuries must have been in-
flicted after he went into the Yarra Bend
Asylum. If injuries were inflicted upon Mul-
lens in the Asylum, by severe beatings, either
with fists or sticks, by any of the attendants,
the jury would no doubt be disposed to con-
clude that Dr. Bowie was bound to know
what was going on. He was resident upon
the premises, he had to go the rounds of the
establishment, his was the supervising eye:
and it must be concluded that he could visit
the asylum at a moment?s notice, at all hours
of the day or night, and that he was bound to
keep the subordinate attendants in check, so
that they could never know when the eye of
the master might be upon them. If, there-
fore, it was found that these operations had
been going on in connexion with Patrick
Mullens, or any other individual in the
asylum, the conviction was forced upon the
minds of the jury, that Dr. Bowie Avas ig-
norant of them, and, being ignorant, he was
criminally ignorant. He (Mr. Michie) cared
not Avhether that ignorance was from age,
from inattention, or from any other cause, or
from a variety of causes united ?if Dr. Bowie
Avas ignorant of the operations going on in


the establishment, it furnished as strong an
imputation against him as if he were inti-
mately acquainted with every act of violence
that was done by every individual in the
establishment, and countenanced or condoned
that violence. He put it to the jury as a
plain common sense proposition, that the
public were entitled to exact from an officer
who was controlling?and was paid well for
controlling?an establishment of this kind,
all those securities and assurances for the
proper management of the unfortunate crea-
tures who were incarcerated in the asylum as
would be expected if the same individuals
were in a public hospital. He would go fur-
ther, and say that although these poor persons
were not in a private house, and might not be
in a position to enjoy all the luxuries
which they would receive if they were
under the affectionate attendance of their
near relatives, yet, so far as human vigilance
and care, well paid for, could supply those
attentions, Dr. Bowie was there to accord
them ; and if it was found, from the evidence
of the witnesses who would be called, that
there were manifestly operations going on in
the asylum of which Dr. Bowie was ignorant,
he (Mr. Michie) did not overstate the fair
position of the case in saying that that igno-
rance was as criminal as wilful negligence or
actual condonation of the authors of those
maltreatments. The fifth and sixth pleas
both referred to the case of Patrick Mullens,
and put alternative views of the case. The
fifth plea assumed that the injuries were in-
flicted before he went to the asylum, and in
the sixth, that they were inflicted in the estab-
lishment. In either case Dr. Bowie was
amenable to censure. The seventh plea re-
verts to the treatment of Dr. Alfred Yates
Carr, and of his being kept in a strait-
waistcoat, with his arms twisted round. The
punishment which was inflicted upon Dr. Carr
was such treatment as only a man ought to
be subjected to who was as uncontrollable as
a wild beast ?whch in fact, only'ought to be
adopted in cases where there was a choice of
evils, where the lunatic was so uncontrollably
wild that if he was not dealt with in that
manner, he would inflict some great injury
upon his fellow-creatures. Only in the last
extremity could the manager of an asylum be
justified in inflicting such treatment upon an
inmate. The eighth plea dealt with a person
named Fitzgerald, and another named Brooke.
It would be found that they were fastened in
canvas bags, secured at the bottom, and were
kept all night in that position; that the calls of
nature were utterly unnoticed ; and that in the
morning they were in that position which of
course was to be expected under such circum-
stances. Let the jury imagine to themselves, if
they could, the grossness of the treatment, and
say if they could imagine anything more offen-
sive or monstrous. Why, they would not even
treat their animals so. When he recollectedwhat
was required in cases where men were bereft
of their reason?the tenderness of treatment,
the regard which must be had to the ex-
citability of the nervous system, the medical
regimen which was indispensable if a cure
was ever to be effected?having regard to all
these circumstances, when he said that the
juryl would not treat their domestic animas>
or even a wild beast so, how much more
forcibly did his remarks apply to the case of
the poor inmates of the lunatic asylum ? How
could it be supposed that a cure would ever
be effected when such treatment as this was
resorted to ? Why, mere physical health was
utterly impossible. The stench which must
necessarily have 'arisen to the unfortunate
person himself in this bag-prison must have
been most revolting at the time as well as
after he was released from the bag. He would
pass on from the case of Fitzgerald to the
subject-matter of the ninth plea, which re-
ferred to a case of a person of the name of
Yicari. That patient had legs covered with
ulcers, and was very deeply afflicted. It seemed
to him (the learned counsel) that he had been
as grossly neglected as a patient ever was in
that or any other situation, or in any case
ever read of in the wildest dreams of romance.
The witnesses who would be called would
satisfy the jury as to this unfortunate crea-
ture?s condition, and detail the particulars of
the swarms of vermin of every possible de-
scription by which he was beset. There were
swarms of bugs, lice, and fleas. Complaints
were made to Dr. Bowie about them by a
a person named Kobert Coates, and all the
reply elicited from the doctor was, ? Oh,
you are a lousy subject; you breed them ?
(Laughter.) It was for the jury to say
whether they were satisfied with that an-
swer. It might be said that the Yarra Bend
Asylum was a very delectable situation for the
breeding of bugs. There was an old saying,
that there were no rats at Ballarat?which
was a pleasant up country fiction ?and it
might be said that there was ample compen-
sation for the absence of rats there by an
abundance of all kind of vermin at Yarra
Bend. (Laughter.) The witness Coates stated
that he had picked 150 lice off a flannel, and
he complained to an attendant that twenty-
five were picked oif his own neck. He also
caught 623 bugs in one night, and showed them
to Mr. Barker and Dr. Eades. No doubt Dr.
Bowie might say? as he had already partially
said through the Attorney-General?that ow-
ing to the elementary condition of society in
this colony, and so forth, there were not the
same means and appliances here for the
treatment of the insane as were recommended
by Dr. Conolly and other scientific writers
upon the subject. Dr. Bowie had no doubt
been let down by the Attorney-General a little
tenderly on this point, by anticipation; but
there seemed to have been sufficient means
and appliances to prepare the poor inmates of
the Yarra Bend Asylum for this plague of bugs
and lice, which could scarcely be exceeded
even by the plagues of Egypt. So far with
regard to Antonio Yicari?s case. Coates?s case,
the evidence of which would come before the
jury, seemed to be as pitiable. Then with
respect to the tenth plea, which alleged that
the patients were not treated kindly?that they
were subjected to negligence, cruelty, and ill-
treatment, at the hands of the attendants?
he should prove these general allegations by a
very considerable number of witnesses. The
jury would find a want of attention to patients
on the part of an attendant named Goode, who


seemed to have been a sort of lieutenant of
Dr. Bowie, to whom Dr. Bowie seemed to have
delegated many of those duties which ought
to have been discharged by Dr. Bowie himself.
The jury were aware that the amusement of
the patients was an important item in the
treatment that they should receive. It was
necessary that they should have reasonable
recreation, that they should be diverted from
dwelling on their own thoughts. This, in fact-
formed portion of the regimen by which to
effect a cure. Accordingly, Yarra Bend was
provided with a bagatelle-table, cricketing ap-
pliances, and a pianoforte. The latter, how,
ever, was in Dr. Bowie?s own house, to which,
of course, the lunatics would not be admitted
for the purpose of playing on that instrument.
With regard to the cricket, it would appear
that the attendants sympathized with that
English nobleman who kept a salaried bowler
to bowl for him, because it generally hap-
pened that the attendants were ? in,? and the
patients ? out,? or fielding as it was called.
The patients were thus kept running about
for the purpose of feeding these attendant bat-
ters with their balls. This arrangement, this
running about for the luxury of the batters,
was scarcely fair play, and it was not calcu-
lated to promote the health of the patients.
Again, with regard to the negligence and
cruelty which the patients received at the
hands of the subordinate attendants, it would
be proved that many of these attendants sat
up late at night playing at cards and gam-
bling, with the lunatics in a large room lying
around them ; and that the wrangling which
arose among the card-players prevented the
patients enjoying their ordinary rest. A
great deal would be proved with regard to the
conduct of Goode and others. The 11th plea
referred to the manner in which the medi-
cines were dispensed at Yarra Bend. It was
alleged that the medicines were not labelled,
that they could not be distinguished one from
another, that the medicines were not admi-
nistered, and that the health of the patients
had not improved. It appeared that the me-
dicines were dispensed as roughly as Mr.
Squeers dispensed his brimstone and treacle,
through the instrumentality of Mrs. Squeers.
In fact, the Squeers dispensary would bear a
favourable comparison with Dr. Bowie?s dis-
pensary, if the latter was not greatly malign-
ed. The medicines were put into old wine
bottles, and sometimes they were taken and
sometimes they were not. Probably those
who did not take the medicines were the bet-
ter off than those who did. However, it would
not do for Dr. Bowie to say that these medi-
cines were not to do the patients good. Al-
though considerable roughness might have
obtained, and although in their elementary
condition they had not all the means and
appliances of the Bethlehem Hospital, Dr.
Bowie was not justified in sending forth from
his dispensary medicines in an unlabelled
condition, by which neglect Jones?s medicine
might be given to Brown, and Brown?s to
Jones, and some patients might get no medi-
cine at all. That plea would be supported by
overwhelming evidence. When the jury had
the whole case before them, they would see
whether his client had been justified or not in
the publication of these articles. He did not
ask for any favorable consideration to the de-
fendant, by reason of his having gone, to
some extent, upon Parliamentary reports, and
upon evidence taken before select committees
of the Legislative Assembly. He quite agreed
with the observations of the Attorney-General
that, if a journalist chose to take the risk of
making absolute statements with respect to
the management or circumstances of an insti-
tution like this, he must take the consequen-
ces, whether he spoke from his own actual
observation, or whether he placed depen-
dence on the representations of others. Still
by reason of the very position in which the
journalist stood, many of the observations
which he made must, by the necessities of
that position, be made upon the more or less
reliable representations of other's. Even Tlu
Arffus-e yed journal, notwithstanding the
number of its eyes, could not be everywhere.
True, it could bring ordinary judgment and
discretion to consider or tax the relative re-
liability of the different representations made
to it, and it could say, as they all could say
when they had to rely on their own judgment
for taking one course or another, ? Can this
degree or that degree of reliance be placed on
this or that statement?? And, therefore,
even if this evidence were not as strong and
overwhelming as he thought it would be found
to be, he would contend that, if they saw a
journalist, relying hand fide upon the repre-j
sentations of respectable men before a com-
mittee of the Legislative Assembly, they
should attach a different judgment to a pub-
lication under those circumstances to that
which they would give to the case of one who
had wantonly, and without reasonable form
dation, dealt with the reputation and position
of another. He was not about to appeal to
the jury ad misericordiam, on that point. He
believed the evidence which he had generally
hinted at would fully come up to what he had
put before the jury. And if that were so, he
asked not merely for a verdict in favour of
his client, but also for a public and grateful
recognition and approbation of the course
taken by a public journalist, in bringing fairly
before the public mind and conscience, the
management or rather mismanagement, of an
establishment of this kind. He need hardly
observe that, engaged as they all were, anx-
iously and feverishly, in the prosecution of
their own individual designs and interests,
this unfortunate class of persons whose posi-
tion they had been discussing, were apt to slip
out of sight altogether. They had no votes,;
they could call no public meetings, they could
get up no agitation. They were incarcerated
and cast aside, as it were, from the general
consideration and attention of the _ world]
But if there was any class of the community that
more peculiarly and remarkably appealed to
their sympathies, it was these _ unfortunate
creatures, who were placed, as it were, alt(>
gether outside the public ken. Therefore, if
there were an establishment which more empha-
tically called for the attention of the journalist,
this was the kind of establishment; and if one
tithe of the facts which he had opened to the
jury were proved, the defendant would be not
onlv entitled to their verdict, but every


vidual conscience in the jury-box must ap-
prove the course which the journalist had
taken, and say he had done no more than his
duty to the community.
The first witness called for the defence was
James Afred Yates Carr.
Dr. Carr entered the court attended by a
keeper of the Yarra Bend Asylum.
The Attorney-General asked whether the
witness (who appeared somewhat excited)
was in a condition to be sworn.
The Chief Justice (to Dr. Carr). ?Are you
aware of the nature of an oath ?
Dr. Carr.?l trust I am.
The witness was then sworn, and examined
by Mr. Wyatt. He deposed as follows : ?My
name is John Alfred Carr. lam commonly
called Alfred Yates Carr. lam a member of
the Royal College of Surgeons, London. I
come now from a certain bastile, commonly
called the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum. I
went into that institution about the middle
of March, 1857. When I first went there I
was allowed to go outside the stone building
in charge of a servant. I remember being
visited by Dr. M'Crea in September, 1858. 1
had been seven or eight days in continual re-
straint. A strait-waistcoat, padlocked, with
the hands behind, was placed on me in the
first instance. It was put on in such a way
as to create actual physical torture. Over that
waistcoat was placed a bag. There were three
or four bags used in the asylum, with all of
which I have acquaintance. The bag was not
removed by an attendant for seven or eight
days, and it was not until I was questioned
by Dr. M?Crea that it became known that I
succeeded in releasing myself from the jacket
in the space of fifty-four hours after it was
put on. The bag I could remove and put on
ut pleasure, so that I might appear, when any
?one entered the cell, in just the same condi-
tion as when the bag was first placed upon
me. The jacket was put on in the afternoon,
and the bag not until the evening. Before the
bag was put on I managed to make a small
orifice in the canvas stitching, and acting on
that, and breaking a padlock, I was enabled
ultimately to free myself. I made a com-
plaint to Dr. M?Crea, and also, I think, to Dr.
Eades and Mr. Barker, of the treatment which
I had received. The result of this complaint
was, that I was replaced in the canvas jacket.
Dr. Bowie came to the door of the cell, and
said he did not care what orders the board
gave, I should be placed under restraint, and
should so remain as long as I was in the asy-
lum. My hands were padlocked up against
the shoulder-blades, and I suffered in conse-
quence a greater amount of physical pain. I
had not committed, by deed or word, any
breach of the regulations. The jacket was
kept on about half-an-hour, when Mr. Barker
entered the cell, -and by his orders the jacket
was removed. On the 4th of July previoiis
I was admitted to an interview with Sir
Henry Barkly. I was then allowed to go
about, on parole, in the asylum grounds, and
I had power, with Dr. M'Crea?s sanction,, to go
occasionally to Melbourne with an attendant,
?who carried a warrant, signed by Sir Henry
Barkly, authorising my detention in safe cus-
tody. This arrangement was brought to an
end the day after I saw Sir Henry Barkly
On that day [the sth July] I was told that
Dr. Bowie had been looking about for me, and
wanted to see me. I kept out of his way.
The board of visitors came down that day to
the asylum, and held a meeting. After the
meeting I saw Dr. M?Crea, in the presence of
Mr. Barker and some other gentlemen. I
complained that two inquests ?the one on
Francois Hibbert and the other on Duncan
Pemberton ?which had been held at the asy-
lum, had been more or less improperly con-
ducted. I also complained that the superin-
tendent had hushed up an inquiry as to the
very gross ill-treatment of a patient named
Lang. Dr. M'Crea asked me to make a writ-
ten statement. I promised to do so. I was at
that time the occupant of a wood cottage, in
which Sloane [who also acted as Dr. Bowie?s
coachman] was an attendant. The visitors
had left, and I was sitting down to tea when
Morgan Irwin, an attendant, came to me,
and said he had received instructions from
Dr. Bowie to take me down below. Irwin
stated that Dr. Bowie had sent him, because
he was of opinion that I was somewhat ex-
cited. Irwin said at the same time that he
thought I was excited the day before?the day
I saw the Governor. I went with Irwin into
B ward. As soon as we got there, Irwin said,
? I have orders from Dr, Bowie to put you to
bed.? Irwin put me to bed and then removed
my clothes from the cell, and left me to soli-
tude. I cannot say how long I was in solitary
confinement, because I became delirious.
While in solitary confinement I had some
communication with Dr. Bowie in reference
to my going to England. At that time I was
in a position to pay my passage to England.
I have in my possession a letter which I then
wrote to Dr. Bowie, requesting him to send it
to my wife. This he returned to me, enclos-
ing the copy of a letter which he proposed
that I should send to my wife. In August I
saw Dr, M?Crea, and made another complaint.
A few days afterwards, Gore, the dispenser,
came to me and said, ?You have received a
sheet of paper; you are to make your state-
ment upon that, and leave a margin for any
remarks which Dr. Bowie may have to make
upon it.? I said, ? Inasmuch as Dr. Bowie
has thought proper to put me in solitary con-
finement, and to all intents and purposes de-
prive me of all liberty, I shall most certainly
not write that letter.? I have not yet pom-
plied with the request then made to me by Dr.
M?Crea. I was put into solitary confinement
on the pretence that I was ungovernably ex-
cited ; but documents in my handwriting
will show pretty clearly the state of my mind'
at that time. The handwriting varied unde's
such circumstances. Pemberton?s case I
know little more of than that, prior to his
death, I saw him confined in a bag, which
seemed unnecessarily to restrain him, and to
give unnecessary agony to a dying man. It
was a strong' Canvas bag, fastened close round
the neck, fitting pretty closely, and open only
at the back, so as to allow it to be put on,
laced up, and fastened with a padlock round
the neck. With regard to Hebert, he had in-
variably a jacket by day, and generally a can-
vas bag by night. I recollect seeing hL.j 0.,.c


or twice altogether out of restraint, and naked
in the straw. The strait-waistcoat was of a
somewhat similar description to the strait-
waistcoat used at present, hut the difference
was in the mode in which it was applied hy
the attendants. At that time I observed that
some patients were worse treated in that re-
spect than others. Hebert did not seem to
give much evidence of actual physical torture.
When the attendant was somewhat mali-
ciously disposed, he could inflict extra torture
upon the patient hy twisting the wrist or
altering the fastening. Dr. Owens could ex-
plain this matter.
Mr. Wyatt. ?Has Dr. Owens undergone
the experiment?
Witness. ?He came round with the commit-
tee appointed by the Legislative Assembly,
and spoke to me about the matter of restraint.
Hebert was a captain of the Garde Mobile in
Paris, in 1848. His death, I consider, was ac-
celerated, by the manner in which he was
kept in restraint. I requested that I should
he allowed to make a statement before the co-
roner at the inquest. Dr. Bowie distinctly re-
fused me permission. The juries, I may ob-
serve, are principally composed of attendants.
When Hebert was lying ill, I said to Father
Bleasdale, who came to me about a book
which another father had lent me, ?I shall
have some curious revelations to make when
I get out of this place ; they commit mur-
der here.? That was the impression on my
mind at the time, and it has not been ma-
terially altered since. The bag used by He-
bert was of a similar character to the one
in which I was placed at the same time. I
will describe the feelings which I experienced
the first night on which I was put into the
bag. The bag was composed of strong No. 1
canvas, impervious to water, which was passed
over the feet, and slipped up the body, fitting
closely, the hands having to be placed flat
against the sides. The bag came close round
my neck?so close, indeed, that even the hugs
could not get ingress between the bag and the
neck. I continually passed urine into the
hag, and there it was next morning, ac-
companied sometimes with fecal matter.
The head was not protected from vermin,
though sometimes by day, and occasionally
by night, a stiff canvas cap was added, and
padlocked under the throat. My own head
was _ bitten all over with bugs and fleas?
particularly bugs. Before I was put into re-
straint I occupied a cell which was literally
swarming with bugs, and I was bitten all over
my person with them. I complained to the
superintendent that the bugs prevented my
sleeping, and he permitted some spirits of tur-
pentine and tow to be given to me, to pass
lighted up and down the walls to destroy the
bugs. I flared away accordingly, but the tur-
pentine became so hot that it was upset, and
there was a great conflagration on the floor.
On one or two occasions I had lice upon my
person, more especially on the head. Lice can
be got rid of by cleanliness and care. Lang
was admitted into the asylum about the 9th
or 10th of May, 1867. Lang occupied an ad-
joining cell to mine. One night Lang shouted
and jumped about in his cell. Between twelve
and one o?clock I heard a footstep in the ward
and a noise as if a chain or buckle were being
drawn along the ground. I heard the door of
Lang?s cell open, and a series of severe blows
struck. First there was a heavy blow and a fall,
and then there was a series of blows, as if given
by a strap. I heard Lang cry, ? Enough,
enoughand ask for a drink of water. The
voice of an attendant replied, as I believe,
? Not a d d drop." The door then closed,
and the footsteps retired. In about half an
hour Lang commenced shouting again. Foot-
steps again approached the cell, and there
was a repetition of the violence. On the fol-
lowing morning I had opportunity of exami-
ning Lang?s person, and I observed that one
aide of his face was severely braised, while the
other side showed two red lines, as if he had
been struck there with a strap. Lang said he
had been jumped upon, and beaten by a strap.
I had a little stand-up fight with an at-
tendant on Sunday the 26th of April, 1857.
I recollect the day, because Keith, a pa-
tient, said to me afterwards ?? Day and
date, recollect.? I was so often subjected
to torture, and yet could get no redress,,
I appealed to the superintendent, and he
merely said, ?I don?t wish you to be ill-
treated : but I have on the one hand the state-
ment of the attendant, a sane man, and I
have on the other hand the statement of
yourself, an insane man, and I am obliged to
believe the statement of the sane man before
yours.? I then came to the conclusion that
it was better to die suddenly and violently
then to continue to endure the torture and
agony that I was perpetually undergoing,
feeling satisfied that if things went on in the
same way they would result either in my
death, or in my becoming utterly and totally
idiotic. Rather than suffer that, I determined
to create such an impression on the mind of the
attendant who next ventured to ill-treat me
that he would remember to his dying day.
On the morning of Sunday, the 26th April,
after passing a restless night, owing to
the bugs, Morgan Irwin opened the cell-door ,
and pitched in a tin plate containing my tea
and a piece of bread on the top just as he
would pitch a bone to a dog. I did not like
to have my bread in a sloppy state; I prefer-
red to have it dry, and the tea hy itself. I
remarked that I was not in the habit of being
treated like a dog. This led to angry words, |
at the conclusion of which I was induced to
spit at Irwin as he was closing the door. He j
turned round, and, as I was lying on the floor,
gave me a kick in the loins, which had the
effect of pitching me over on to the bed. As
I inferred that the next step would be the
introduction of the strait-waistcoat, I barri-
caded my door. In course of time Irwin
end eavou red to force the door. Ijtreated him first
to the entire contents of a pot containing urine
and fecal matter. I then struck him on the
head with the vessel, inflicting a wound, the
scar of which yet remains. I then became I
perfectly passive. I was knocked down, got a
thorough good hammering about the head
and shoulders, and was rendered powerless.
Some time afterwards, when lying actually
helpless on the mattress, Irwin came and
jumped and stamped on my hack with all his
force. Had I been lying on the floor instead


of the mattress, bones would have been
broken, and in all probability death would
have resulted. While this occurred, I saw
Dr. Bowie preparing, in an opposite room,
some dressing for Irwin?s head. Dr. Bowie
dressed Irwin?s head, but he never came
near me, to see what treatment I had
received, and from that day to this I never
had the opportunity of giving my version of
what then occurred. I believe Dr. Bowie now
hears for the first time what did then occur.
After this I was placed under restraint. The
jacket was placed upon me and padlocked in
a peculiar manner, and the canvas bag was
placed over that. I was pitched on the floor
just as you would pitch a log, and there I lay
in agony, only able to move my head from
side to side. The perspiration poured in tor-
rents from each temple. Goode, an attendant
afterwards came in and relieved me; and
from that day to this, although I have been
repeatedly under restraint, I have not had to
complain of any undue or excessive cruelty.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
?I was seriously ill in England in August,
1855, on the death of my mother, and became
mentally depressed, in consequence of which I
was an inmate of the Prestwich lunatic asy-
lum. I remained there several weeks, and was
very kindly treated by all parties connected
with it. I was sent to the asylum upon an
order of the magistrates, after proper inquiry,
upon the ground that I was incapable of self-
control. I believe the treatment I received
there saved my life. I did not write a pam-
phlet about Indian hemp. I once got an ex-
tract inserted in a newspaper on that subject.
I believe Indian hemp has been administered
to me both here and in England, but not since
admission to the Yarra Bend Asylum. If you
want to know the effect of the use of Indian
hemp I refer you to an article on the subject
in Johnston?s Chemistry of Common Life. I be-
lieve it produces a species of intoxication.
I do not attribute the state of my health, from
the 6th to the 26th of April, 1857, to Indian
hemp being administered to me. I have a
strong suspicion that on two or three occa-
sions Indian hemp has been administered to
me in wine or tobacco. I don?t think it pro-
duced any permanent ill-effect upon me. I
have myself administered it medicinally. I
found it was used in one asylum in certain
cases of melancholia, but I afterwards gave up
administering it, from an opinion given to me
by Dr. Phillips and other medical men.
[The witness made some further voluntary
statements about Indian hemp, and proceeded
to speak in a very rambling manner. He
concluded a string of incoherent remarks by
saying, that when our Saviour worked mira-
cles, the Jews said that he was possessed of a
levil, and was mad. ? Was Jesus Christ mad
or not, Mr. Ireland'?? asked the witness. ? I?ll
make a fair bargain with you,? he continued;
? I am under cross-examination, and I am
supposed to be an insane person.?]
The Attorney-General? Oh, no.
The witness said he would make a fair bar-
gain. The Attorney-General should ask one
question, and he (witness) would ask another.
The Attorney-General continued the
cross-examination, putting a number of ques-
tions relative ,to the witness?s visit to His Ex-
cellency the Governor.
[Witness said that he went to the Governor?s
residence in company with Morgan Irwin, one
of the attendants at the asylum, and he ob-
tained an interview with His Excellency in
the usual way in which one gentleman ob-
tained an interview with another, by sending
in his card.]
The Attorney-General.?How did you
leave His Excellency?s residence ?
Witness. ?I walked out.
The Attorney-General. ?You were not
put out'?
Witness. ?No. Ask Sir Henry Barkly the
next time you meet at the Executive Council.
The Attorney-General.? Did you see the
Chief Secretary that day ?
Witness.?l did. Having stated to His Ex-
cellency in as few words as possible what I had
to say, I begged to be permitted to retire, and
did retire. A few minutes afterwards, I had
an interview with Mr. O?Shanassy, who was
then Chief Secretary. The same card I sent
in to the Governor was subsequently sent in
to Mr. O?Shanassy.
The Attorney-General? Were you put
under restraint the same day ?
Witness. ?No.
The Attorney-General? When, then?
Witness?At six o?clock next day.
The Attorney-General. ?Are you ac-
quainted with the present Emperor of the
French'?
Witness.?l am not aware that I ever set
eyes upon the man in the whole course of mv
life.
The Attorney-General. Are you ac-
quainted with any of the Plantagenet family?
Witness.?The Plantagenet family is gene-
rally presumed to have ceased to exist. Such
is the result of my reading history. (Laugh-
ter.)
The Attorney-General. ?ln fact, you
never knew any of them ?
Witness. ?Never knew what ?
The Attorney-General. Any of that
family.
Witness.?l decline to answer that question
at present. [The witness here became exceed-
ingly incoherent in his statements. He
talked about having written something upon
a cover of The Argus newspaper, and in the
midst of his remarks he took up a book lying
beside him, and wrote in it with pencil the
words ? Alfred Yates Plantagenet.? The wit-
ness, turning to the Attorney-General, then
said?? If you can disprove, Mr. Ireland, that
I have any right to what I have done, I will
instantly acknowledge myself in error, and
cancel what I have just done. Now go a-
head.?]
The Attorney-General.? Are your family
connected with King Alfred the Great?
Witness.?l can?t say positively. Eecollect
I am on oath now.
The Attorney-General? Will you take
the book, and just put it down?
Witness. ?I have nothing to put down on
that subject. I have no positive knowledge
upon the subject.
[The Attorney-General here proceeded to
put a number of questions to the witness as


to whether he was acquainted with the Due
de Barry. The witness answered the ques-
tions, but stated that he only did so on the
understanding that he was to be allowed
aftewards to put some questions to Mr. Ire-
land. His replies to the questions about the
Due de Barry were all of a negative character;
but in reply to one question, he said that it
must be submitted to another tribunal.]
The Attorney-General, (continuing the
cross-examination).? Oblige me by taking the
book, and putting it down ?
Witness.?l decline to oblige you. I can t
afford to do so. [Witness, however, imme-
diately afterwards took a piece of paper, wrote
something upon it, crumpled it up, and threw
it upon the counsel?s table. It was understood
by the reporter that the words ?Due de
Barry? were written upon it. The witness
offered to answer any further reasonable
questions which were put to him, but reserved
the right of declining to answer such as he
should think fit.] . .
The Attorney-General intimated that he
had no further questions to put. He also told
the witness (apparently ironically) that he
had answered everything most satisfactorily,
and that he should have a copy of the evi-
dence and a minute of the report to take
away with him. [The witness had previously
asked for the report of the Parliamentary
Committee relative to the asylum.]
The witness expressed a wish to put a num-
ber of questions to the Attorney-General, and
he asked the learned gentleman if he had
searched through the records of his office, as
be had promised to do on the previous day,
to see if any letter had been received by any
of his predecessors as Attorney-General.
The Attorney-General. ?l have not had
time, but I will direct a search to be made to-
daThe Witness.?l am Alfred Yates Carr, and
I want a writ of Habeas Corpus,
Mr. Michie. ?Did you see Mr. Ireland yes-
terday?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?Where? .
Witness.? At the asylum, in the presence of
Mr. O?Farrell (the plaintiffs solicitor), one of
the official visitors, and Dr. Cameron.
No further questions were put to the wit-
ness, who then left the box. uttering some
remarks in reference to the Attorney-General,
which were not distinctly heard.
The next witness called was
Mr. Robert Coates, who was examined byMr.
Wood. He said.?l was formerly a patient at
the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum. I went there
on the 14th of April, 1866, and left on the 30th
of May 1858. The second day I was there, I was
employed under the care of one of t he atten-
dants?M?Conichie. Afterwards I was employed
by Dr. Bowie, for his private use. I had all the
liberty I liked. I was employd as Dr. Bowie's
gardener. I had from three to fourteen of the
patients working under my care. I laid the
grounds out according to my own plan. Dr.
Bowie said I might lay them out as I liked.
I thought, after I had broken up the ground,
and cultivated it, that I might be allowed to
give the patients a few green onions, lettuce,
and such like things of that sort as I knew
they liked. Dr. Bowie forbade it. He saidrj
he wanted all the vegetables, except what
were required for his friends, for the animals.
I said there would be still enough left for the *
inmates; and he replied, that the remainder 1
should be used for seed. Some of the
refused to work in the garden. A patient
named Edwards was locked up for refusing to
work. He was a quiet man. I had access to E-]
every patient?s ward. I was under no restric- j
tion for one year and eight months. Afterwards **
I was prohibited from visiting the wards, on n ,
the ground that I was a dangerous man.
During the early part of the time I was in the
asylum the walls of the rooms were daubed t<l
copiously with human excrement, which I have a ,
also seen lying on the floor, and in other parts j
of the rooms. I believe that on the floor was C 8
covered with lime, but the dirt was not other- ge
wise removed. In the course of time, it would
be removed by treading and so forth, but it was I 1(
not cleansed in any other way. The dirt on the
walls was not subjected to any cleaning
at all. The beds of the patients were frequently ir
in a most frightful condition, daubed with urine
and excrement. In consequence of the lime a ]
beingupon the floor, there was an accumulation e ,
of lime and filth, which adhered to the beds, in
conseqence of the beds being damp. To the be st j
of my knowledge, the beds have remained in j r
that state for days together. The persons in L
bed were sometimes in a very dirty state, I w
allude to persons who could not take care of n
themselves. They were filthy with excrement.
I could not say how long they remained in that a]
condition. I could undertake to say that they
have been so for four or five days. On occasions a
when Dr. Bowie has come round the wards s j
while the patients? beds have been in that state, a:
I have seen the attendant take up a clean sheet e:
or counterpane, throw it over the dirty bed un- 4
til the Dr. had passed, and then remove it. I c
am speaking of the earlier portion of the time I
was in the asylum. I remained in the same M
ward nine or ten months after going to the asy- v
lum, and during all that time the state ofthings n
which I have described continued. I never saw 0
Dr. Bowie go up to the sick patients, and feel S1
their pulses, or examine them. I have seen c
patients not only filthy, but also bruised. I t
don?t know how those bruises happened. I t
have seen medicines served out to the patients, v
They were put in common blue bottles, without t
any labels, and without corks. Th ere was one t
attendant named Philip Henry Goode. Hecame t
to Dr. Bowie?s under rather peculiar circurn- n
stances. He had been living with Dr. Bowie?s K
son-in-law (Dr. Daniels), and got indebted to t
that gentleman to the extent of �BO or �4O, \
and he came to the asylum to work the debt 1
out. On one occasion, Goode brought up the t
medicines, and I w r as the first person to whom t
he offered them. I drew his attention to the t
bottles, and he said that he had both medi-
cines and lotions; but he scarcely knew the �
one from the other. I therefore declined to t
take any medicine, for fear I might be poisoned t
The medicines were brought in a filthy panni- I
kin at that time ; but there was an improve- p
ment afterwards, I believe the patients {
frequently never took their medicines at all. p
as I saw the bottles in the same state in the l


morning as they had been brought the pre-
vious night.
Mr Wood.? Were any medical comforts,
such as arrowroot, sago, &c,, prescribed for the
patients?
Witness. ?They were sometimes given out
for the sick patients, but the attendants did
not think it worth their while to distribute
them. I have had them offered to me if I
liked to take them, but I never saw them
given to the other patients.
Examination continued. ?I knew a patient
named Potter. He was in a very emaciated
state, and was ordered new milk and other
things. The milk was not all given to Pot-
ter, but was partially consumed by the attend-
ants. Sometimes the attendants took it all.
I reported this matter to Dr. Bowie, who
called me an officious person, and also repre-
sented my conduct to the attendants, in con-
sequence of which I was subject to much an-
noyance. Dr. Bowie said that I was a dan-
gerous man, and that they must be careful of
me. During the early portion of my residence
in the asylum I received every care and at-
tention from Dr. Bowie and his family, I was
allowed to be in the kitchen, and had wine
every day. After I became more officious, as
it was called, I was not allowed any wine, and
I was taken from the kitchen, and removed
into F ward After that time I was forbidden
both bread and water, and was frequently in
want, unless some of the other patients brought
me some food.
Mr. Wood. ?Did the attendants show their
animosity towards you in any particular way?
Witness.?They called me a old rogue,
a old scoundrel, and used such expres-
sions as those towards me. I told Dr, Bowie,
and he said, ? Served you right; what can you
expect ? ? This was after I reported to the
doctor that the patients did not get the medi-
cal comforts.
Examination continued. I remember a
woman bringing a plum-cake for her husband,
who was an inmate of H ward. The cake was
never delivered to the husband, but was all
consumed by the attendants. When I remon-
strated with the attendants, one of them,
called Johnson, threatened to kick me out of
the room. I have known butter and such
things brought for another inmate, which
were never delivered to him, but consumed by
the attendants. Dr. Bowie had a large quan-
tity of poultry. I believe be hatched some-
thing like 500 in one season. There was a
man appointed to attend to the poultry, and
some of the inmates assisted him. The poul-
try were fed with the bread and rice remain-
ing from that which was served to the inmates.
He had seen bread which had not been
touched by the inmates broken up to give to
the poultry. On one occasion, he had been
told by an attendant, John Moore, to break
up some of the bread, and he refused to do so.
Some of the vegetables which were grown in
the garden were sent out of the establishment
to Dr. Davies, Mr. Symington, and other of
Dr. Bowie?s friends. I was so completely dis-
gusted with the proceedings of Dr. Bowie and
his attendants, that I refused to work in the
garden. I was then placed in H ward, in the
hope that I would return to my duties, but
when it was found that I did not do so, I was
removed to F ward, and treated in the way I
have described. I was at all times prevented
from seeing the visitors, and it seemed to be
artfully managed, as when the visitors came
I was removed from one part to another as
they inspected the asylum, so that I could not
see them. This was done because it was known
that I should make some observations to the
visitors. This was carried on for eight
months, and it was only by accident that I
saw the visitors upon one occasion when they
came earlier into my room than was expected.
The visitors on that occasion were Dr. M'Crea
and Dr. Eades. I had caught 523 bugs the
night before, and I presented them to Dr.
M'Crea. I used to catch bugs night after
night, and bring them before Dr. Bowie, who
told me he did not believe that I obtained
them in a straightforward way. I never
caught so many before, but I got from 300 to
400 some nights, and at last I was locked up
for catching them. I mean to say that it was
not usual for me to be locked up in a room,
but I had access to any part of the ward dur-
ing the day or night. After catching the hugs,
however, I was not allowed that privilege, but
was locked up in my room. Dr. M'Crea said
he would take care that means should be
taken to get rid of the bugs, and immediate
means were used. Previously, it was a fault
to destroy bugs?such a fault that I was locked
up for it.
Mr. Wood.? For poaching in Dr. Bowie?s
preserves! (Laughter.)
Examination continued.?l also complained
of lice. When in F ward I felt a most un-
comfortable itching on my neck, and one of
the patients looked at my neck and said it
was covered with lice. After that I com-
plained to Dr. Bowie, and the doctor said.
?You are a lousy subject; you breed them.?
I put up with the itching until another
flannel was brought me, and when it was
brought, I looked at it, and saw that it had
from fifty to one hundred lice upon it. I
pointed this out to Johnston, the attendant,
and told him that I had not bred these lice,
at all events. Johnston then took the flannel
away. On one occasion, a Mrs. Churchill, a
friend of the gardener?s, came to the estab-
lishment. On her leaving, I, at the request of
the gardener, showed her the way to the gate.
Dr. Bowie observed me, and ran after the
woman, and charged her with having received
a letter or message from me. I had not given
her any letter or message; but, nevertheless,
I was locked up in my own room for a fort-
night after the occurrence. The attendants
behaved to the patients according to their
own natural dispositions or inclinations ?
there was no restraint placed upon them.
In one instance a young man named Anderson,
while walking about in the yard with the
other inmates, eating their teas, threw down
a piece of bread, when one of the attendants,
Paddy M'Lachlan, who had no right to inter-
fere at all, went up and asked Anderson why
he had done so. Anderson, who was a quiet
inoffensive man, made no answer, and M'Lach-
lan struck him some violent blows with his
fist, and also with his feet. Anderson was
afterwards removed to his room, and remained


there until he died. Ido not say he died in
consequence of the treatment which he then
received. Some of the attendants were scarcely
ever sober. One of them, named O?Donoghue,
used to be in a beastly state of intoxication
for days together. There was another, a night
attendant, whom I have seen, at the time he
ought to have been doing his duty, carried to
bed by two men, in consequence of his being
helplessly drunk. I have myself told Dr.
Bowie that he ought to visit the ward at
different times, when the attendants did not
expect him, and see what was going forward.
Dr. Bowie replied that he should do nothing
of the kind. I have never seen him visit the
wards except at the special times duly ap-
pointed. The attendants were then ready
waiting to receive him; and I have heard
some of the attendants say, when waiting the
Doctor?s arrival, ? I wish the old fellow would
be sharp, as I want to be off to town.? On
one occasion, I inquired for seven or nine
different attendants, and they were all gone
out of the way. When Dr. Bowie came, he
knocked at the door leading to each ward,
and it was opened for him. He had no key to
open the doors himself. There were amuse-
ments provided for the patients. There was
cricket, but I was never close enough to see
that game played at, as I was engaged at my
work during the day. There was a billiard-
table, but it was generally occupied by the
doctor?s sons, their friends, and by the atten-
dants and their friends. On one occasion
there were twelve games played amongst the
attendants for �1 a game. When the billiard-
table was not engaged, the patients could
amuse themselves at it. (Laughter.) There
was a dead-house in the garden appropriated
for the production of vegetables or the use of
the establishment.
Mr. Wood. ?Have you ever seen post-mortem
examinations conducted there ?
Witness.?l don?t know what you call them,
but I have seen the mangling of bodies car-
ried on there. I have put skulls and portions
of skulls out of the way of the other patients
myself. I have seen portions of bodies hang-
ing on the trees there until the stench was so
sickening and offensive that we could scarcely
bear the place. (Sensation.) Other persons
have seen the same. There were skulls and
portions of skulls lying about the garden.
They were afterwards taken, and put into an
old box lying near the dead-house, and that
box was subsequently taken away. I do not
know what became of it. The patients, in
walking about the garden, could see the
bones, and on a dark night they were apt to
kick against them. Goode and Johnson were
the principal persons engaged in dissecting
the bodies. On one occasion Goode told me
that in consequence of O?Donoghue being
drunk and mangling the bodies, he should
really have to complain of him. On that oc-
casion I locked up O?Donoghue, but he got out
of the window of his room, went down to the
dead-house, and commenced operating him-
self. I have known the attendants disagree as
to whether a patient had died at eleven,
twelve, one, or two o?clock, and the dispute
was settled by arrangement, as it was neces-
sary to agree as to time. Sometimes the at-
tend ants said the sick persons were sham-
ming. and I have seen the food for them
placed down by the side of their bed, and still
left there, untouched, after the patients were ?
dead. I remember a person who acted as 1
Jack Ketch. The night before he died I a '
heard some blows upon the floor, and I heard" 11 �
his dying groans. In the morning he had 1
been drawn out of the room by one of the at-At
tendants. His body was bruised all over.*h�
The sick patients had not been properly at- 6 ! 11
tended to previously, but after this occurrence. 0 ?
there were persons appointed particularly to�b
look after them at nights. [The witness was V I I
examined at some length relative to the mode Y IS
in which the food for the inmates was distri-f h<
bated, and other matters.] He stated thatp n
the meat and vegetables used to be brought llo
in on dirty plates, piled in a heap; that thereP 1
were no knives, forks, or spoons ; that the 01 ?
plates were not distributed amongst the in-S a
mates, but such as could do so seized hold ofP a:
them, and the others who were not able to lib
walk, had either to go without or depend^ 0
upon the kindness of their fellow inmates toF er
get them something to eat. Moreover, the^o|P r,
was only one small table, and the inmates) 1 ;
had to eat their food as they were walking 00
about. He next gave some evidence as to a l l
man known as Charley, the sweep, who was) 1111
once an inmate himself, but subsequently! oo
taken into the doctor?s service. This man 00
was said to have kicked and struck the in-,
mates, and on the attention of the attendants
being directed to it, they took no notice ofj
the matter. Witness also spoke of Dr. Carr m
as a very quiet patient, and described the bagi ,
punishment. He stated that the bags were, 1 "
strong canvas bags, which he believed would 01
hold water. He also gave evidence to the .
effect that there had been a scarcity of water J?
supplied to the inmates, and that they were tr
sometimes compelled to drink puddle. He 111
had also seen sheets, blankets, and other ''
things used to light the fires with, when there i
was a scarcity of wood, and on one of the at- , c
tendants (Goode) being remonstrated with on Ip
this waste, he replied, ? What does it signify ? ~
they can afford it.? He had seen patients
destroy blankets, clothes, &c., and the torn
articles had all been shoved into a hole by V
the side of the River Yarra. In reply to a i;
question by Mr. Wood, the witness stated V
that the various malpractices which he had _?
described continued during the nine or ten ,
months he was in F ward, but that after that
there were great improvements made ?knives |
and forks and dining-tables were provided for 1
the inmates, the rooms were better cleaned,
clean linen was supplied oftener, and there
was more attention paid generally to the ,
cleanliness and comfort of the patients.]
At the close of Mr. Coates?s examination-in- ,
chief, which occupied about an hour and a ,
half, the Court adjourned until ten o?clock on ,
Thursday morning, ,


SECOND DAY.
as The examination in chief of Robert Coates,
?ja witness for the defence, had just closed
T( lpie previous day when the Court rose.
ac j The witness was now cross-examined by the
it. Attorney-General. He said ?it was in 1857
o r 'that the exposure of bodies which I have
jtJspoken of took place. There was then no
ICT other medical man attending the establish-
to'ment besides Dr. Bowie. Dr. M'Crea, Dr.
as Webster, Dr. Eades, and Mr. Barker were the
that year. I have said that several of
ri.the patients drank dirty water, but I do not
know that any of them died from it. lam
aware what was my particular delusion
re when unwell. I worked for about seventeen
[ u ,or eighteen months in Dr. Bowie?s private
n . garden. I afterwards worked,in the patients?
When I refused to work, I was shut
� o llp. I was taken to the H ward by Dr.
K j Bowie. lam not conscious of having suf-
fered any mental illness while there. Myim-
roPression was that I was as sane all through as
es tt am now. Dr, Bowie said himself that he
me capable of taking any charge
a I pleased- He authorised me, in the first
as [instance, to go about where I pleased ; and I
[ y commenced the alteration, in his garden at
, n once.
n . The Attorney-General?Why were you
t s kept there at all ?
Witness, ?A great deal through unfair treat-
rr ment.
L ? The Attorney-General.?You were under
r 'g the impression that you were never mentally
( j diseased at all ?
ie Witness. ?Not there. For six months pre-
;r viously I was at Geelong, and there was no-
thing more the matter with me than there is
now. I perfectly understood what I said,
; r what they said to me, where I was, and what
X! I did, 1 applied to be let out some time be-
fore I was discharged. I was examined by the
n doctors, but I was not then discharged.
m The doctors who examined me were Dr.
M'Crea and Dr. Webster, Dr. Bowie being pre-
n sent at the time. The reason I was not dis-
v charged was because of evidence being brought
a forward, which has since been proved to be
q false. The persons themselves declared to
q Dr. M'Crea that they had been employed to
a make the statements under the influence of
x those persons. A-
g The Attorney-General.?Who are those
r persons?
Witness. ?Dr, M?Crea will give you the
I names of the persons who told him. I was
3 not under any mental disease, to my know-
ledge, while I was in the asylum.
Samuel Wain wright, examined by Mr.
v Wyatt.?l keep a dairy in Collingwood. I
1 have been an attendant in the Yarra Bend
Asylum. I went there on the Ist August,
1856, and remained until the Christmas fol-
lowing. I was in F ward, which was a kind
of infirmary, There were then three wards
altogether. I was engaged first as a day atten-
dant, but I was not satisfied with what I saw
in the first week, and I told Dr. Bowie that
the situation would not suit me. Dr. Bowie
then offered me a night attendant?s place, and
I took it. The other attendants in the ward
were Goode, Moore, and Donoghue. I was the
only night attendant at the time. Goode?s
duty was to take charge of the ward in the
day-time, and render what assistance he could
if called up in the night. He was, however,
generally engaged in writing for Dr. Bowie,
taking charge of the females? wine, and run-
ning on messages for Dr. Bowie. He was
frequently away, and was not employed upon
the duties which he was paid to perform.
Goode told me so, and I know he was fre-
quently absent from his duties, I complained
one day?when I was a day attendant ?to
Dr. Bowie that there was no wood. Dr. Bowie
said, ? Fetch some.? I said, ? No, I can?t do
that until somebody relieves me. Goode is
doing some writing for you; and I won?t
leave the patients, to allow them to jump into
the fire.? Goode at that time, as he after-
wards told me, was in the women?s ward.
Donoghue was another day attendant. He
considered himself the senior. He was very
often tipsy. I have seen him tipsy at eight
o?clock at night, when he ought to have been
on duty. His duty closed, I should say, about
eight or nine o?clock, when the patients were
put to bed. I never saw Goode the worse for
liquor. When I have gone on duty as a night
attendant I have found the patients very much
neglected. They were seldom washed. They
lay with dirt in the beds, their backs sticking
to the beds, and the beds sticking to the floor.
M'Coll, a young man whom I found dead, was
in a shocking state. He had sores on his back
from lying in bed. The sores were not dressed.
One evening when I went on duty I went into
the dark room, and there found M?Coll lying
dead apd cold. I waited a considerable time ?
about half an hour or so, and then Donohoe
made his appearance, the worse for liquor. I
said to him, ? How is M?Coll?? He said, ? All
right.? I said, ?He is dead and cold.? Donoghue
only replied, ?Is he, by God ?? When I went
on duty at night I received the medicines from
the day attendant. Some of them were in
?old tom? bottles, which were frequently
without labels, and sometimes without corks.
I have found that the patients never had their
medicine in the day-time. I mentioned the
matter to Goode. He said, ? I really have so
much to do, I have no time.? I have seen
Donoghuedrinkup something like six patients?
wine at a draught, and I have reason to be-
lieve that that was frequently the case.
Moore, the other day attendant, was addicted
to drinking, and was sometimes absent. I
administered the medicines myself. When I
received the medicines from Goode I took
pencil and paper, and wrote down the direc-
tions.
Mr. Wtatt.?Did you ever make a mis-
take ?
Witness. ?It is very probable. Dr. Bowie
used to come round with a number of atten-
dants, about eight o?clock at night. The at-
tendants knew his hour, and they were always
in readiness to go round with him. I remem-
ber a patient named Watson. He was usually
clean and comfortable. He is not now at the
asylum. I have often asked Watson, on going
on duty at night, whether the patients had had


their wine, and he has said, ?No; I have not
seen them.? These patients lay sick, unable
to help themselves to the food which was
brought to them ; and I have frequently found
when going on duty at night, three meals
lying beside them untouched. The patients
were so weak they could not help themselves.
In the day, the food was brought on a large
trajr into the middle of the yard, and the pati-
ents came round it. Those who could help
themselves got one or two dinners, _ while
others ?idiots?had very likely to do without,
and very often did. The food was usually
boiled or roast meat, I have seen salt with
it, but not pepper or mustard. The tray was
put in the yard, on the ground: but if the day
was wet it was placed on the floor of the F
ward. The broken food was carried to Dr.
Bowie?s pigs, and the bread was carried to his
fowls. I have seen ten or a dozen pigs about
the premises. I could not tell the number of
fowls; there were hundreds. I never saw the
patients have any pig-meat, fowls, or eggs.
There was a large quantity of vermin. I
should say there wasnot in my ward a patient
who had not lice on his person. I could not
escape them myself. There were a great many
bugs. One patient (M'Coll), had a mass of
maggots under him. His back was in a shock-
ing bad state. I stopped one day to cleanse
him, and Watson said that was the first time
he had been made comfortable. I remember
one night when on duty I saw a patient who
looked as if he would not live long. I went
to Dr. Bowie, and asked him to come and see
him. Dr. Bowie came and said, ? Well, he
will not live long; but I hope you will be able
to keep him alive until after twelve o?clock.?
He did not say why, but I thought I knew his
meaning. I understood if the man kept_alive
over twelve o?clock, his death would go in the
return for the next week. There was no
knives and forks allowed to any of the pa-
tients. The food was cut up into bits, with
greens and potatoes; you scarcely recognised
it at all, it looked so black; and the patients
had to eat it with their fingers. I was ten
years in Bethlehem Hospital, London. I
never saw such a state of things at that insti-
tution. It would never have been tolerated.
The patients there were trusted with knives
and forks. There might have been one or
two who were not so trusted. At Yarra Bend
the male and female wards were separated?
the one did not open into the other?but
it frequently happened that male atten-
dants could get into the female depart-
ment. I have seen female attendants come
into the male department. I never saw
during the ten years I was at Bethlehem
Hospital, anything like the bag used at
Yarra Bend. I remember one day a female
attendant coming into the ward to ask a male
attendant to come to her assistance in re-
straining a refractory female patient. I said,
? Can I assist you ?? She said, ? No.? She
wanted a certain individual ?a j r oung atten-
dant.
Mr. Wyatt. ?A young attendant! You
were too old.
Witness. ?The wards were cleaned with
sand and lime. Soap and water were not
used. If there was any dirt the sand and lime
would be left on. You can hide dirt witlj M?
sand and lime, but you cannot remove it is
There was a piano in F ward. There wai Ei
also a bagatelle-board. I have seen patient lai
play a little upon it. The attendants used kj nc
play on it, for money, until one or two o?clock ar
in the morning. There was a great quantity hi
of clothing. No precautions were taken T!
against their destruction. Blankets given th
out one day might be torn tip by a patient at
and then new blankets were given to the in
same patient again. In a well-regi i lated estah gc
lishment this could be prevented. Api
coverlet could be made of canvas lined al
with blanket, and stitched crosswise. This hi
could not be torn, and would last a n
considerable time. I have known men
to be locked up for refusing to work in the tl
garden. Dr. Bowie saw the patients, but 1 ci
never considered that he paid the cases the h
attention which they required. I never sav n
him feel their pulse, look at their tongues u
examine their persons, or make any memo J
randum as to their condition. I found one
day a pannikin containing the brains of e tl
man. It was in the day room, where we had w
our food. I was looking for a pannikin to a
drink with, and reaching this down, smelt tl
what it contained. Goode said ?? It?s old So 4
and-so?s brains? (I forget whose). Dr. Bowie a
told me to bring them. ti
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General, a
?At Bethelehem Hospital there are rooms lined h
with indiarubber, and when a patient is a
refractory he is put into one of these rooms, g
but his limbs are not restrained. a
The Attorney-General? But a patient 1
can tear himself to pieces with his hands ? c
Witness. ?I never saw a man tear himself c
to pieces with his hands. I have known (
patients confined in the canvas jacket at Beth- t
lehem Hospital, hut the jacket is not used i
there now. That institution is large, but
regularly conducted. It was built for 500 !
patients. It is a very different place from what
Dr. Bowie had at Yarra Bend. Dr. Bowie?s i
establishment consisted of wooden buildings, 1
and had nothing like the appliances and com-
forts which were at Bethlehem Hospital. I
left that institution to come here with my
family. My trade is that of a shoemaker
Dr. Bowie never complained to me of working i
at my trade in the day-time. After 1 left
Yarra- Bend he gave me work at my trade.
Dr. Bowie never eomplained of me till I re-
signed the situation: Then he remarked that
he had made up his mind that an attendant
should not leave the institution day or night.
The Attorney-General. ?You had leave
to resign ?
The Chief Justice. ?Is that so? Did you
resign, or did Dr. Bowie dismiss you ?
Witness. ?I resigned; and I have a testimo-
nial from Dr. Bowie in my pocket.
The Attorney-General A resignation is
sometimes given in anticipation of a dismissal.
With respect to M'Coll, how did you allow all
this accumulation of filth and maggots ?
Witness?l consider that the patients ought
to be cleansed in the day-time, and not at
night. I had been night attendant for two
or three weeks before I cleansed M?Coll. I
made no representations to Dr. Bowie as to


M?CoH?s frightful state. I believe Donoghue
is dead. I have heard that Goode has gone to
England. I know that Moore was in Queens-
land, but I don?t know were he is now. I
never represented the conduct of Donoghue
and Moore to Dr. Bowie. Bethlehem Hospital
has a surgery, Where the medicines are kept.
There was no such thing at Yarra Bend during
the time I was there. The waistcoat used
at Bethlehem was a kind of canvas frock,
inside of which were pockets for the arms to
go in. The jacket was laced up behind. The
patient had room enough to work his hands,
although they were placed in front of him. I
have seen strait-waistcoats at Bethlehem, but
not in use.
By the Chief Justice ?A patient wearing
the jacket could not handle anything, but he
could use his hand inside. He could put his
hands down to the full extent of his arms. I
never saw at Bethlehem a bag used like that
used at Yarra Bend. I came to the colony in
June, 1866.
By the Attorney-General. ?Restraint was
then in a great measure altogether dispensed
with at Bethlehem Hospital. There were
attendants for the very violent cases, to stop
them from injuring themselves. I have known
400 patients at Bethlehem Hospital. One
attendant was allowed for every eleven pa-
tients. I cannot say how many patients were
at Yarra Bend at a time, but it frequently
happened that the attendants were taken
away from their work. I have seen when
going home of a morning, an attendant riding
a young horse about the paddock, instead of
being in the wards, assisting in the cleansing
of the patients. I had not much opportunity
of knowing whether Dr. Bowie had one atten-
dant to every eleven patients. I brought a
testimonial from Bethlehem Hospital. (Testi-
monial produced.]
The Attorney-General. ?This is not from
a medical man. This is from the steward.
Witness.?Yes. He "had almost the entire
management of the place. He had been there
forty years, and he appointed and dismissed
all the servants, subject to the approval of
the committee. The medical man was changed
frequently, and therefore could not speak to
my services of ten years. Dr. Bowie has a
steward, but his duty is simply to take charge
of the stores. I know Nott and Grant. I
never stated to them that there had been a
row in England about the Bethlehem Hos-
pital, and that money had been given by the
newspapers, and that the same thing might
be done here. I never said anything of the
kind in my life. I read of an inquiry taking
place with regard to the Bethlehem Hospital
about twelve months after I left.
[A certificate of the witness?s discharge
from the army, after a service of eleven years,
signed by Lieutenant-Colonel James Mac-
donald, and dated 13th May, 1829, was here
read by Mr. Michie. It stated that his
character was good, that he had received one
distinguishing mark of good conduct, and a
Pension of 6d. per day.]
The witness said this pension was only for
three years. It was given him without ask-
>ng. He forfeited his claim to a pension by
asking for his discharge.
Mr. Michie.? You were asked if you were
allowed to resign, as if you were kicked out
of Dr. Bowie?s service.
The Attorney-General. ?l did not in-
sinuate anything of the kind.
Mr. Michie. ?It was insinuated.
The Attorney-General.?l did not mean
anything of the kind. I suppose I may judge
of my own opinion. What I put to the wit-
ness was, that Dr. Bowie, finding he had been
onstantly at other work, determined to part
with him.
Mr. Michie. ?You were not happy in com-
municating your idea, for we all managed to
misunderstand you. (To witness.) ?Did you
understand it as an insinuation that you
were kicked out ?
Witness. ?I did.
The Attorney-General. ?Well, I hope you
are all relieved.
[The certificates from Dr. Bowie and from
Mr. Nicholls (late steward of Bethlehem Hos-
pital) were then read. The former stated that,
while an attendant at Yarra Bend, the witness
had conducted himself with propriety. The
latter set forth that he had been employed for
ten years in charge of lunatics at the Bethle-
hem Hospital, and could, without hesitation,
be recommended to any simlar employment.]
Mr. Michie. ?As I understand, Dr. Bowie
made no objection to you after you left, but
sent you work ?
Witness. ?Yes, and said he was very sorry
that he had not a situation that would suit
me.
By the Chief Justice.? ln the first few
days that I was at Yarra Bend, I found that
if I retained my situation, all the dirty work
would fall upon me. If the attendants had
acted together, the work would have been
done.
The Chief Justice? Did you tell Dr.Bowie
substantially that ?
Witness.?l said the situation would not
suit me. I could not begin reporting attend-
ants the . first few days. Dr. Bowie then
offered me the office of night attendant. I
resigned that for this reason. There was a
bedroom door broken down, and I reported it
for a fortnight. It was not attended to, and
one morning an old patient, who watched me
go into the yard, managed to make his escape.
Dr. Bowie blamed me, and yet the fault rested
with him, because there Avere on the estab-
lishment two carpenters paid by the Govern-
ment. That was the reason I resigned. Dr.
Bowie said I was at work for myself in the
day, and asleep at night when I ought to be
attending to my duty. With regard to the
padded room in Bethlehem, the floor was
composed of indiarubber, cork, and a kind of
cement. The bedsteads were made of a simi-
lar material, and the walls and doors were
lined with it. There were also rooms padded
Avith straw and canvas, to prevent the pa-
tients injuring themselves when striking
against the wall.
Rebecca Haslem, examined by Mr. Michie.
?I am a barmaid at the White Hart. I was
formerly a female attendant at the Yarra
Bend. I went therein July, 1860, and remained
there, to the best of my knowledge, sixteen or
seventeen months. I left of my own accord.


During the first four months I was in A ward.
My duty was to see the patients cleaned in
the morning, all right for breakfast, and to
see they were all right during the day. Gene-
rally I was engaged from seven o?clock in the
morning until nine at night, when the night
attendant came on. I was afterwards removed
to the cottages. I had to see the patients
washed and dressed, and then to take them
to the workroom and superintend their sew-
ing. There were four attendants, and we su-
perintended the sewing in turn. It was my
duty to do this every third or fourth day.
When not so engaged I had to walk out with
the patients in the paddock. There were
twelve patients under my charge. I had had
no experience of lunatic asylums before.
Mr. Michie.?How often did Dr. Bowie visit
the patients under your charge?
Witness. ?Sometimes he would call in the
morning. At other times I did not see him
for days. Dr. Bowie used to visit the wards
twice a day, but up at the cottage we did not
see him sometimes for days together. To the
best of my knowledge, he was at one time a
week or fortnight without coming up to the
cottage. I had one day in the month for a
holiday; but I did not take it sometimes for
three months together.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
?The sewing-room was in the centre of the
cottages. I cannot say whether Dr. Bowie
has called at the cottage while I have been in
the sewing-room. He has called at the sewing-
room when he has not called at the cottage.
The best patients lived at the cottages. There
were twelve in each. They had more liberty
than the patients down in the wards, and they
were allowed knives, forks, and plates. The
cottages were kept clean, and the furniture
and linen were regularly attended to.
By the Chief Justice. ?I had the sole
control of this cottage, There was no female
superintendent. I was directly responsible to
Dr. Bowie. I left because I objected to accom-
pany the patients to Northcote church.
Henry Richard Ray, examined by Mr.
Wood.? -I am an attendant at the Yarra Bend
Lunatic Asylum. I have been there about
five years and four months. Since I have
been there the asylum has very much im-
proved. The management has improved in
every respect. The patients are treated more
kindly; they are more looked after than they
were before, and the supervision is far better.
The patients are kept cleaner than they used
to be. When I first went there the patients
in some of the wards were not kept in a
cleanly state. I speak particularly of H, F,
B, and D wards. I have been an attendant
in almost every ward in the place. When I
first went to the asylum there was a degree of
carelessness with regard to the cleanliness of
the patients. In some of the wards the beds
were very filthy: and the persons of a great
many of the patients were not in a cleanly
state. Things are improved now.
Mr. Wood. ?How long is it since this change
has taken place ?
Witness. ?Things have gradually kept on
altering during the time I have been there.
There was first one improvement and then
another. I have seen some of the patients
put in bags. The bag has varied occasionally
both in the quality of the canvas and in the
shape and make. When I first went there a
fit was on for abolishing all restraint. The
first kind of bag I saw was one of a light de-
scription. The next was a strong one ?so
strong that water could not go through. Some
of the bags were open at the bottom and some
closed. In the bag used when first I went
there the patients could move their arms
backwards and forwards, but could not raise
them. The bag now in use is pretty well the
same, but it is lined, and open at the bottom.
There has also been a vast improvement in
the mode of administering food. During my
first year the food was served in a very irregu-
lar manner. The trays were brought down to
the kitchen from the different wards, and the
meat was cut up. I have seen the cutting up
of the meat commenced at eleven o?clock, and
the potatoes boiled, perhaps, one hour after.
It was the duty of three or four of the pa-
tients to divide the meat, and place it on the
dishes. It was then brought up to the pas
tients in this way, and some of the patientt
got three times as much as others, and ate i-
in any manner they could. There were
benches and a table in some wards, and not
in others. I believe there is now a table in
every ward. When I first went to the asylum
not a patient had a knife and fork. Now, I
believe, 300 male patients have the use of
knives and forks.
Cross examined by the Attorney-Gbneral.-
The asylum had baths when I went there, and
now there are more baths than there were then,
but still there is a deficiency. There has been
a whole range of buildings since I went there,
eight red brick cottages, each of which ac-
commodates from fourteen to nineteen pa-
tients. These buildings have afforded increased
facilities for the comfort and cleanliness of the
patients. I don?t think it was possible for
the patients to have had the same amount of
comfort and cleanliness when I first went
there that they have now. The walls and
floors of the four wards I have mentioned are
cleaner; the tables are cleaner; in fact every
thing is cleaner. Patients have been drafted
out of all the wards except B and D into these
cottages. Some of the patients are less cleanly
in their habits than others. You have to
watch and look after the dirty patients as far
as possible. Some patients dirty everything
that is on them. It is the same at night, but
the beds and linen are not changed at night.
I have put a great many patients into the
bag.
The Attorney-General. ?Was it necessary
to do so ?
Witness. ?It was the order to do so. It is a
question of opinion whether it was necessary.
[The witness was then requested to examine
two bags and two jackets produced by the At-
torney-General.] This bag (holding up) appears
to be half a foot wider at the foot than any
bag I have seen at the asylum. It is the shape
of the asylum bags in other respects. I have
seen the general run of bags used.
The Attorney-General.-Tlice I shall send
for an other. You will have no objection to go
for another presently, when your examination
is over ?


Jly Witness.?lf the doctor orders me.
the The Chief Justice.? Explain the way in
re a which a patient is put into the bag.
fhe Witness.?The patient is sometimes naked,
de- and sometimes he has a blanket round him.
-so I have seen this bag used in the case of a man
ime who would not keep his bed-clothes on at,
une night. I have seen it used in the case of a man
ent who ran shouting after the doctor, making
?ms him think that he was going to be struck,
use This (holding up another article) is a jacket
the that I have never seen before. I know this
)m, jacket (another garment) but the arms are too
in long.
my The Chief Justice. ?In your opinion, they
gu- are none of them exactly of the kind used,
to What are the eyelet holes for ?
:he Witness.?To fasten up the arms behind the
up patient?s back.
nd The Attorney-Gene ral? ls that necessary
,er, in some instances where a patient is violent ?
oa- Witness.?That is a matter of opinion. I
he shall not give any opinion about it.
>as The Chief Justice. ?Were these patients so
itt violent as to require their arms to be re-
i i- strained ?
;re Witness.?That, as I said before, is matter
iot of opinion. My opinion may not agree with
in another person?s opinion,
m The Chief Justice.? Well as you are a ser-
I vant there, I will not ask for your opinion,
of The witness then, at the desire of the Court,
put on jacket No, 1, the usher of the court
holding the open parts behind. The witness
id said he could not get his arms out, but he was
n, not subjected to pain. In reply to questions
in from the Jury, he said he had not seen a
?e, jacket of the same kind since he had been at
c- Yarra Bend. Such jackets might be there,
a- but he did not believe they were.
;d Thomas Hugman, examined by Mr. Michie,
ie ?I was formerly an attendant at the Yarra
ir Bend Asylum. I went there first on the 11th
of of September, 1861, and remained there seven
it months. I was engaged as out-door attendant,
d I lodged in S ward, at the new buildings
re where the brick cottages are. The duty
?y assigned to me was to take out the patients,
d to work about on the roads, and to pay par-
se ticular attention to Dr. Bowie?s poultry. I
y did this until Dr. Bowie turned away a young
0 man for some fault, and asked me to take his
,r position. It was an unpleasant one, but for
g the sake of my wife and family I consented,
t and then I told Dr. Bowie that it was impos-
t. sible for me to look after the poultry. Dr.
e Bowie said he would get some one else to do
it, and 1 was cleared of that duty. At the
y same time I did myself great harm. I incurred
the displeasure of Mrs. Bowie, which is worse
% than incurring the displeasure of Dr. Bowie.
Mr. Michie. ?You are quite right. You are
e a competent judge of human nature.
Witness.?lt is the duty of every man to
3 study human nature. When I was thus
r cleared of all charge of the poultry, my par-
; ticular duty was to empty the filth boxes (of
3 which there are about twenty-seven) every
morning, and to take the bodies of dead
1 female patients to the dead-house, and after-
> wards dig graves and bury them. I had also
i to keep the drain round the cottages clean. I
ound this drain in a most fearful state?full
of mud and fifth of every-description ; while
on the banks were heaps of rubbish, which
had been lying there for months. When my
men turned it over to take it away in barrows,
the rubbish was found to abound with mag-
gots. It took me a week to clear away the
heaps of rubbish which I found all round the
cottages of the female patients. The drains
at the back of the female wards were mere
square boxes; some were quite rotten and
broken, so that, if not emptied every morn-
ing, the filth would be running about on the
ground. I called Dr. Bowie to look at them,
because the patients had filled them with all
sorts of rubbish. He came and said he would
reprimand the attendants for allowing it, but
it occurred several times, and I threatened to
report it. [The witness then described the
closets of the female patients, which, he said,
were open to such an extent that the persons
of the patients were exposed.] Dr. Bowie
told me to give orders to the carpenter to
have the filth boxes repaired. I gave
the orders, but the carpenter said there
was no timber to make them. I did
not report the carpenter?s answer to Dr.
Bowie. There was a patient named Fitz-
gerald. He died on the 22nd March last,
near Dr. Dalian?s residence. He came up from
H ward. He was very sickly and feeble, and
seemed terrified. He was very destructive
with regard to his clothes, and, in consequence
was put into a bag during the night. It was
a narrow kind of bag, made of very rough
canvas?what sailors would perhaps call No. 3
canvas. It was very dirty?almost black.
Mr. Michie. ?Not like the bags which we
have seen, and which seem to have come fresh
from the-factory, or clean from the wash ?
Witness?l have seen nothing like them.
Those bags seem to have been made expressly
for the occasion.
Mr Michie.? Some of us had that impres-
sion before.
Witness.?Fitzgerald was confined in that
bag all night. He could not move his arms.
He was placed on the bed, and lay there like
a mummy. The bag was fastened by leather
staps and a padlock. In the day-time, he was
put into the airing yard. He had on some
patent gloves?canvas gloves without fingers,
fastened by a leather-strap and padlock which
screwed up, and if screwed up tight, would
give excruciating pain to any man. Fitzge-
rald was in the brick building five or six
weeks before he died. He was first received
by a person named Johnson, who treated him
with every kindness, and paid every attention
to him. Afterwards a man named Con-
way had the charge of him. He was
then much neglected, and when he died
he was in a filthy condition. Conway was
his attendant for three or four weeks,
down to the time of his death. When
Fitzgerald was dead he was so covered with
fasces, that it took the attendant nearly three
hours to clean him. I was told this. I saw
him at the time of his death, and I saw that
he was in this filthy state. I was called to see
Fitzgerald on the morning of his death, and
it was upon that occasion I saw the condition
bis body was in. He was covered with his
own excrement, Fitzgerald was taken down


to the dead-house the same day. Dr. Bowie
and an attendant were waiting for it when I
was in the grave-yard, about twelve o?clock,
and the doctor asked me why the body had
not been brought down. I told him the at-
tendant was cleaning the body, and would
send it or bring it down when he got it clean-
ed. I then went and got the body, which was
cleaned by that time, and I and four men
took it to the dead-house. This was between
twelve and one o?clock. I kept a diary while
I was at the asylum. [Witness here read the
following extract from his diary : ?? Tuesday,
October 19, 1861. In the morning, as I was
passing along the south-east end of the female
cottages, I heard a child screaming, and
directly afterwards observed the attendant
forcing one of the insane children?s heads
against the side of the cottage with her hand;
but the moment she saw me she desisted from
her brutal conduct, and I said nothing, but
thought the more.? I made that memoran-
dum at the time. I observed other ill-usage.
On one occasion, the date of which I do not
remember, as I was returning from my work,
I heard a cry of distress, and I went down
through the ward, and saw one of the atten-
dants on the bed, and one of the patients had
hold of him by the neck. I disengaged the
?atient from the attendant, and immediately
did so, the attendant took hold of the pa-
tient, dashed him on the floor, punched him
as hard as he could, and held him firmly down
with his knees on the patient?s breast.
Fearing that some serious injury might be
inflicted, I begged the attendant to desist,
and on reflection he did desist. The patient?s
name was Birnie. The assistant?s name was
William Goolde. I have not seen Dr. Bowie
go round the upper wards regularly. I have
known him not make his appearance in our
ward (where the cottages are) for two or three
days together. I have seen him pass round
without coming into our ward at all. The
attendants have been ready for his coming
up, but he did not come. The alarm was
always sounded when Dr. Bowie was coming.
They always knew when he was coming.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
?I was first employed in the establishment
on the 11th September, 1856, I was there seven
months. I began to take notes at first. I
did so because I have been accustomed to
keep a diary all my life. I was dismissed from
the asylum, but I am puzzled to know the
reason why. The reason assigned for my dis-
missal was for keeping the place dirty. Wit-
ness was here proceeding to read some further
extracts from his diary, when
The Attorney-General remarked that the
witness was going to give a history of his life
for seven months.
The Chief Justice told the witness that he
might look at the notes to refresh his memory,
but he could not be allowed to read from his
diary.
Witness then said that about the end of A pril,
Dr. Bowie showed him a heap of dirt, which
had been placed at the back of the cottages
by the attendants. I said I was not aware of
the place being dirty, and that it was quite
clean three weeks before. The doctor then
said that if I did not keep the place clean I
must leave the asylum, and he would appoint
another man in my stead. I said he might do
as he liked; and he then said that I must go
in a month. He also found fault with me on
the Ist of May. He would not listen to any
justification from me, but drew me to the back ol
his own house, and said, ? Look at this place.?
It was cleaner than it has ever been since,
There were some weeds and bones about, which
had probably been thrown out of his own
house. He said that if I would clean the dirt
up that afternoon, he would keep me another
month. I said I had to dig in the graveyard
that afternoon; upon which he replied that I
must clean up this dirt also. I said I could
not be in both places at once; the doctor
replied, ? Well, then, go.? There were other
reasons why I left besides that, but I suppose
I shall not he allowed to mention them. The
poultry business settled me. (Laughter.) As
Mr. O?Shanassy, or the Government, had
ordered Mr. O?Grady to be taken back, Dr.
Bowie thought he would make a vacancy for
him by sending me through the big gates, as
it was called. (Laughter.)
James O?Grady, examined by Mr. Wyatt,
deposed as followsl am an attendant at the
Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum. It is sixteen
months since I was first appointed there. I
was there during a portion of the time
Hugman was there. He did not succeed me.
I was placed first in Award. My duty was to
see that the patients were up at a certain
hour, and that they got washed and got their
meals. Some of the patients were sometimes
under restraint. A jacket was sometimes
used, and sometimes a canvas bag. I have
seen the bag there as late as last night. [Wit-
ness here described the bag.] The bags were
sometimes clean but in many instances we
were obliged to dry them before we could put
them on. They were not washed on those
occasions. I have been away from the asy-
lum about two months. In one case, in which
two patients tried to run away, they were put
in jackets and padlocked together, side by
side. They only remained in that position
five or six days. They were connected toge-
ther in that manner all the day, except at
meal hours, but not at night. I remember a
patient named Melbourne being in a strait-
jacket for four or five months. At one time
he was very dangerous, but he afterwards be-
came quiet. Melbourne was in the strait-
jacket both during the night and day. He
was under my care. I cannot say that he re-
quired the restraint during the night. He
was put under restraint by the directions of
Dr. Bowie, on my complaint in the first in
stance. For a portion of the five months he
required to be under restraint, but I do not
say that he required to be so all the time.
Cross-examined by Mr. Fellows. ?The two
patients fastened together were Melbourne and
a man named Joseph Hughes. The jackets in
which they were placed were of a similar
character. The reason why they were put
under restraint was because one day Mel-
bourne was discovered assisting Hughes in an
attempt to escape over a wall about eighteen
feet high. The patients might have been
allowed their liberty without any risk, if they
had been placed in different wards.


Mr. Fellows asked the witness whether, if i
the men had been allowed to go out into the i
yard uncoupled they could have been kept 1
separate from each other? *
The Chief Justice said he did not see the
orce of the question, inasmuch as the men <
had not been taken into the yard together,
but had been kept padlocked in one of the
wards.
Re-examined by Mr. Michie.?l have never
seen any brands on the jackets or bags.
By the Jury.?l have seen a jacket used like
the one now produced.
I Frederick Ferdinand Kauwerau, examined
by Mr. Michie. ? I am an architect and clerk
of the works in the Public Works Department.
I have charge of the buildings and building
operations going on at the Yarra Bend Asylum.
I had charge of the first about three years ago.
My duties were to design the plans, and write
specifications for the several buildings re-
quired for the establishment, and see them
properly carried out; also to see any repairs
made, and to make any report about the
buildings I found necessary. During the time
I had charge of the buildings a sunk wall was
built to prevent the escape of the lunatics.
There is a ditch on the outer side of the wall,
which assists to carry off the drainage from
the establishment. The drainage is very de-
fective. I have frequently made suggestions
to Dr. Bowie, and he has made suggestions to
me. There has been a great deal of nuisance
made by the patients near the sunk wall, and
I have called Dr. Bowie?s attention to it. Dr.
Bowie was not in favour of the sunk wall
being erected in the first instance, and he said
that in consequence of the existence of the
sunk wall he could not prevent the nuisance.
I told him I could prevent it, and I suggested
that he should make the attendants watch
the patients. From continually seeing the
nuisance since that time, I presume the atten-
dants have not watched the patients. I have
seen the nuisance lying there for weeks to-
gether. I have seen a female patient called
Finger. She was then in G ward, but I be-
lieve is now in one of the cottages. lam not
aware whether she was confined there. _ Dur-
ing the time I had charge of the buildings I
had opportunities of observing hqw the atten-
dants were employed. It struck me very fre-
quently that they could have given much
more attention to the patients. I observed
the general condition of the place as to clean-
liness. On the whole, it now appears to be
reasonably clean. At the time I was_ there it
was certainly not kept so clean as it might
have been. Some parts were filthy, more par-
ticularly in the then very crowded F ward.
There was certainly filth observable on several
occasions when I passed through it. The
odour was very strong, and sometimes is now.
It is almost impossible to prevent that as the
ward is constructed, but it is cleaner now than
it was then. During the last six months it
has been changed to a female ward. There
was an improvement in the state of the ward
before it was changed to a female ward. I
ascribed the improvement to the fact that
there were not so many patients there as pre-
viously.
Cross-examined by Mr. Billing.? l know,
in a general way, what number of patients the
attendants had to attend to. In each of the
brick cottages there were fourteen patients,
and there was an attendant to each. There
were also other attendants. My duties were
chiefly out of doors, in connection with the
buildings. #
Re-examined by Mr. Michie.?l have seen
some of the attendants lying in bed in the
afternoon; and, as I have said before, if they
had looked after the patients, this nuisance
would not have existed. ,
By Mr Billing.? l could not distinctly
state whether the attendants I saw lying on
the beds were night or day attendants.
By Mr Michie?l had seen the same atten-
dants doing duty during the day. I know, in
one instance, the attendant whom I saw asleep
had charge of a cottage, and I don?t think that
the attendants having charge of the cottages
did night duty.
By the Attorney-General.?l do not know
the name of that attendant.
Mary Steele, examined by Mr. Michie, said,~
I am a widow, and was formerly a patient in
the Yarra Bend Asylum. My mind became
affected soon after the death of my husband,
which occurred in June, 1856. I remained in
the asylum for four years and a half, and left
in January 1860. I was in A ward. I remem-
ber an attendant named Sloane. He was a
night watchman. He afterwards became Dr.
Bowie?s coachman. One day I went up to
one of the cottages, and Sloane was there. He
said he would get a kiss from me. I said. Get
away * you are a married man. He tried to
get round me. I then sat down on the bed,
and I told him to go away, the doctor would
be coming. I blew out the light, and he shut
the door. lat last got away, and did not go
up to the cottages until six weeks afterwards.
Before the end of the six weeks I found I was
pregnant I was confined in Madeline-street,
North Melbourne, on the 19th June, 1860. I
left the asylum about a twelvemonth before
that I left the asylum on the 29th of January,
1860. I was pregnant when I left the asylum.
Sloane was the father of the child. I had had
children before that time. I was confined at
my brother?s house. My brother's name is
Francis Bent. He is a labourer. I remember
Dr. Bowie coming to my brother-in-law?s
house before I was confined. He came in his
carriage, which was driven by Sloane. My
? eldest'brother came with them. Dr. Bowie
. came into the house and saw me. He said,
?So you won?t tell me?? That was the way
; the conversation commenced. No communi-
. cation had taken place between Dr Bowie
and me before on the matter. My eldest bro-
i ther came in to the house before Dr. Bowie
? My brother said he had come to try and do
; some good for me. He said, ? Tell me who is
; the father of your child.? I said, I told you
l before I did not want to tell you my business,
t My brother was in a great rage, and asked me
; to open the door. ?He then went out and
I came back again in a few minutes with Dr.
[ Bowie. The Dr. said, So you won t tell me ?
t In reply to that, I said, ? I did not wish to tell
- him my business.? Dr. Bowie then said, It
you don?t tell me, I shall send you back to
r , the wards.? I replied, ?Well then, doctor


come in, and I will tell yon.? He came in,
and I then said, ? Well, doctor, the father of
my child is Sloane.? The doctor replied, ? I
must discharge Mr. Sloane; and he added, as
he left the house, ? A nice way to leave the
Bend.
Mr. Michie. ?Avery correct moral reflection.
Examination continued. Dr. Bowie?s
daughter came to me the day before the doc-
tor?s visit. She brought an attendant with
her. She said, ?Dear me, Mrs. Steele, how
stout you are.? She also said her father had
heard that I was not quite well?that I was
pregnant, and that Mr. Sloane was the father
of the child, and that he (Dr. Bowie) was de-
termined to get at the bottom of it. She added,
that her father was coming next day, and I
I shall he glad to see your father any
day. I summoned Sloane at the District
He did not attend but wrote a letter
to Mr. Hackett, the magistrate. An order was
made upon Sloane for the maintenance of the
child, and the money was paid. Some time
after Sloane?s wife oame for the child. I told
Sloane that 7s. 6d. a-week was not sufficient
to keep the child, and my lawyer wrote a let-
ter, and asked him for more. Sloane said he
could not give any more, but he would take
Hie child, and his wife afterwards came for it.
1 he child died about two months after Sloane
took possession of it.
By the Chief Justice.? At the time Sloane
came into the cottage to me, he was an inmate
oi the asylum.
The Attorney-General. ?And only acted
as Dr. Bowie?s coachman occasionally ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
I have had four children. I was appointed
assistant-laundress at the asylum on the 14th
January, 1859. I was pretty well then, and
have continued so ever since. The date of my
visit to the cottage would be about September
of that year. I went to the cottage for some
calico and ribbon. It was at eight o?clock in
the evening. _ There were other cottages ad-
joining, in which there were inmates. There
was a bed in the room. When I said Sloane
wanted to get round me, I meant he would not
let me go out. I had been in about a quarter
of an hour before I wanted to go out. Sloane
was not romping with me during that quarter
of an hour. I was going out, but Sloane asked
me to sit down, as he was going out. I then
sat down on the bed, and he went out for three
minutes, and then returned. He went into an
adjoining room. The reason I did not go out
was, because I was waiting for him to come back
again. (Laughter.) He asked me for a kiss
alter he came into the room, and after he re-
turned. He put his arm round my shoulders
and wanted to kiss me. I did not call out be-
cause there were twelve patients in the adjoin-
ing room. I did not think there were any
attendants in any of the adjoining rooms. I i
did not try to attract any person?s attention, i
I was not a consenting party to what Sloane i
did. I tried to get up. I was not perfectly 1
conscious of what I was doing. I am aware 1
that after I told Dr. Bowie, Sloane was dis- i
charged.
By the Chief Justice.? Sloane lived in the s
cottage himself. I went for some ribbons and 1
calico, which I asked him to bring me fron sa i
town. The room in which I slept was a shor thi
distance from Sloane?s cottage. re
Re-examined by Mr. Michie.?l had coral be
missioned Sloane to bring me some ribbons nr
&c., from town, and I went to his cottage to nc
see if he had brought them. I was a patient gn-
at this time, and not receiving any salary for S ui
what I did. I was just put to work at times, re(
like other female patients. dii

Dr. Bowie call at her house.
This witness was not cross-examined.
Dr. Michael Barry examined by Mr. Michie, ?
said, ?I am a doctor of medicine. I have not
a great deal of knowledge as to the condition
and management of the Yarra Bend Asylum. ! -
I first visited it about the middle of 1857. I
only visited it three times. The last time I
went, I went with Mr. J. T. Smith, who was
at that time Mayor of Melbourne. I have
seen lunatic asylums at home. I have seen
most of the principal asylums in France, Ire-
land, and England. I was struck with the ap-
pearance of great despondency presented by the
patients at Yarra Bend Asylum. Although
things appeared clean to the eye, they were
unpleasant to the nose. Almost everywhere
there was an offensive smell, particularly in
the dormitories and airing ground. There
was particularly a smell of urine. That struck
me to be the case almost everywhere I went.
I thought the per centage of restraint used at the
asylum was most unnecessary. There seemed to
be various bags and sacks used for restraint. I


saw seven or eight people shut up in things of
that kind. Even under the old system of
treating lunatics, I should have taken that to
be an unusual degree of restraint. That re-
mark applies with still greater force to the
new system of treatment, which has now
superseded the old system. In my opinion
such restraint would, of necessity, retard the
recovery of the patients very much indeed. I
did not particularly notice the water-closets.
I noticed that the substitute for a privy in the
airing grounds was a hole cut in the ground,
with a perch across. [Witness gave more
minute evidence on this point, and stated
that these closets were quite open and exposed
to observation.] I called Dr. Bowie?s atten-
tion to this matter, and he said that it would
be unsafe to allow the patients a covered
privy. I was not satisfied with that remark.
On my last visit my attention was attracted
to a boy who had had very little exercise for a
long time. He appeared to be more an in-
valid than an insane person. He required open
air exercise, and I belive he had not such ex-
ercise for three or four weeks. The boy was
thirteen years old. Afterwards arrangements
were made to take him out in a cart, and I
believe he recovered from that circumstance.
The boy seemed to have wanted proper nu-
triment as well as exercise. He appeared to
be quite sane, but he wanted treatment as an
invalid. Mr. Smith and I called the servant?s
attention to this boy, and asked the reason
why he had been neglected. A change was
promised, and was made the next day, as I
have already stated. On that occasion I heard
anoisefrom acellwhichwaslocked. Wegotthe
door open, and a very respectable-looking wo-
man complained that her hair had been cut otf,
and that she had been much ill-used, for hav-
ing, as was alleged, broken a square of glass.
She denied having broken the glass, and I
believe she was speaking the truth. We made
inquiries, and found Dr. Bowie was not aware
of this treatment. This woman was not ex-
cited, and showed no symptoms of insanity.
She was very calm in telling about her hair
being cutoff, but, of course, she was much
annoyed at the indignity to which she had
been subjected. In the women?s airing ground
I saw a woman sitting on a block, using very
obscene language, and there was no person to
correct her. A few words of kindness would
have put a stop to her language. I was in
court yesterday, and heard Dr. Yates Carr give
his evidence.
Mr. Michie was about to put a question to
the witness as to whether he believed Dr.
Carr was perfectly sane when he gave the
earlier portion of his evidence on the previous
day, but
The Chief Justice interfered, and said that
this was a question entirely for the jury. _
Mr. Michie then asked the witness if it
were not possible for a man to have a mono-
mania on one subject, or upon two or three
subjects, and yet to be perfectly sane upon all
others ?
Witness.?Yes.
The Chief JusTiCE.?For instance, a man
may believe he is the Emperor Alexander, and
the moment you touch him about that, or
about anything connected with the Emperor
Alexander, he is raving mad, but upon all
other subjects possibly he may be sane ?
Witness. ?I think so. ,
By Mr. Michie. ?I saw the manner in which
Dr. Carr was dressed yesterday.
Mr. Michie. ?Was that dress calculated to
irritate him ?
The Attorney-General objected to the
question.
The Chief Justice ruled that the question
was entirely a scientific one, and might be
then stated that he saw the dress
which Dr. Carr had on. [lt was understood
to be the ordinary garb worn by the inmates
of the Yarra Bend Asylum, and had upon it
some arrow-heads and other distinctive marks
belonging to that institution.] He expressed
his belief that the fact of Dr. Carr?s being
brought to the court in that dress might have
the effect of irritating him, but his attendants
ought to have been aware of this, and that it
would have been more judicious if they had
not brought him in that dress.
The Chief Justice. ?Do you think the
patient saw the dress ?
Witness. ?I am sure he felt it very much?
from his conduct when giving evidence.
The Chief Justice.? Do you think that
ought to have been anticipated by a man con-
versant with the management of lunatics ?
Witness.?l think so.
Mr. Michie.? lf an educated lunatic were
put in the same class along with a rough un-
educated one, do you think that that circum-
stance would he detrimental to his cure ?
Witness. ?It would be more injurious to
the educated man than to the other.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
?I do not know that Dr. Carr was accus-
tomed to come to Melbourne on parole in the
same dress. If he had gone to the Governor
in that dress, I should not have thought he
was much affected by wearing the dress at
that time?that is, supposing he had the op-
portunity of changing it. I am not aware
whether he had any opportunity of changing
it or not. I know the boy to whom I have
referred had not had proper exercise, because
the persons round about him said so. His
appearance made a strong impression on my
mind. Possibly it may be a common practice
for lunatics to make complaints to visitors.
I feel sure that the woman I saw sitting on
the block and using obscene language might
have been calmed by a few words of kindness.
lam against all restraint for lunatics. Al-
most all the asylums are conducted without
restraint. Even at the worst asylums, such as
Bedlam, they have done away with corporal
restraint. Ido not think that a lunatic will
offer violence to anybody without violence
having been offered to him in the first in-
stance. I believe that lunatics have always
acted on the defensive originally, and that
they have become aggressive in consequence
of violence having been used towards them.
I would not use any corporal restraint to any
lunatics. At the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum
there are 1,200 lunatics, without any corporal
restraint being employed. I have-not read a
case of a nursemaid cutting a child?s throat.
There may have been such a case but Ido


not suppose the act was done in consequence
of the nurse being a violent lunatic. That is
a different matter altogether. The deed was
probably done from an hallucination, I have
heard of a woman dashing a child?s brains out
in a fit of insanity. That, however, would
not be in consequence of the lunatic being a
violent lunatic, but probably from a delusion.
It is a different matter entirely.
The Attorney-General. ?Do you say that
lunatics are never aggressive, without being
provoked to it from violence ?
Witness.?Yes. A lunatic does not offer
violence without he has been provoked to it in
the first instance.
By Mr. Michie. ? I have read of the case of
George 111., and the difference which took
place in his demeanour after he was taken
from the care of Dr. Williams, and allowed to
have a knife and fork, and to dine with his
wife and family, and was treated like an
rordinary being. I have seen precisely simila
cases.
By the Chief Justice. ?Anything like vio-
lence will provoke and irritate a lunatic. The
use of the bags in this asylum is a very bar-
barous process. It is used for punishment as
well as restraint. It is a most objectionable
punishment. If a lunatic attempts to escape,
the course to adopt is to put proper super-
vision over him. Supervision is the substi-
tute for all these unnecessary restraints. One
lunatic may be allowed to watch another, but
this is not a very wise practice.
Dr. David John Thomas, examined by Mr.
Wyatt. ?l am doctor of medicine and sur-
geon. I did not make a post mortem examina-
tion of the body of Patrick Mullens, but I was
called to see his body after the post mortem ex-
amination was made. I had no opportunity of
examining the viscera. I merely examined the
honey structure. I found three fractured ribs
on the left side, and from the appearances
presented the fractures seemed to be of very
recent occurrence. The fractures were in
front. The bodies of the ribs were broken.
The fractures could not have been inflicted at
an earlier period than fourteen days before
death. [The witness gave the scientific
and medical grounds upon which he arrived
at this conclusion.] I think the ribs had not
been broken more than two or three days
before; fourteen days would be the extreme.
I visited the Yarra Bend Asylum once, about
eighteen weeks ago. I was present yesterday
during the examination of Dr. Carr. It is
quite possible for a person to be insane on two
or three subjects, and quite sane upon all
others. I would, not, however, place much
reliance upon a man if he became excited.
Dr. Carr complained to me yesterday, when
he was coming to court, of "the dress he had
on. He said ??Do you see? I have been
dragged through the towm in this dress, with
this badge upon it.? I think it would tend
to irritate him to bring him up in a dress with
the brands of the Lunatic Asylum upon it. I
think this ought to have been avoided.

smoothness at the ends of the fractured bones dici
That is purely mechanical. After the laps* due

Further evidence was called in support of res
the defendant?s pleas of justification. Dr
Dr. William M'Crea, examined by Mr. ' J , a
Wyatt. ?l am chief medical officer to the tin
Government, and was officially connected
with the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum from
the beginning of 1864 to the end of 1860. Dr.
Bowie had charge of the institution during wc
that time as surgeon-superintendent. It was ov
intimated to me a little before the close of
1860, by the Government of which Mr. Heales n . e
was Chief Secretary, that at the termination r i ]
of the year, my duties with regard to Yarra �f
Bend would cease. I asked the reason why Wi
the asylum was taken out of my department, ?i
and it was stated in answer, that the Govern- Wi
ment conceived it would conduce to the better & e
regulation of the institution. wi
Mr Wyatt. ?During the time you were
connected with the institution, did you find ai
that it was conducted as it should be ? se
Witness. No; I frequently made com-
plaints and reports. I used to report to the
Chief Secretary. I was not only the head of **
the department, but chairman of the Board
of Visitors, and in that capacity visited the ?
institution every month. That Board of | e
Visitors existed before the asylum was put
into my department. The reports which I ai
have made have been made in the capacity of ?
visitor. When the asylum was put into my
department, it seemed to me a badly-regulated ?
establishment. There was a great deal of
restraint, and there was an entire absence,
apparently, of everything in the shape of a

n%museraent. The food was served up in an
pen mtidy, improper, and uncleanly manner.
, adhere were no decencies or comforts. There
'eei ve re no knives, forks, or tablecloths. The
fon food was served to the patients in tin plates,
ues jyrith spoons ?the potatoes and the meat being
no mixed together,
li Mr. Wyatt. ?Had Dr. Bowie, at that time,
isti the means of providing amusements and com-
em brts?
ion Witness.?He could make requisition for any
Althing he required. I desired him every year
nl( to make an estimate of what he required, and
'be: in that estimate provision ought to have been
made for everything that he thought neces-
loisary. Many of the amusements which
?s. were suggested he objected to. For instance,
gei the board suggested that draughts, backgam-
lolmon, and other games should be provided,
not Dr. Bowie objected, on the ground that the
oi patients would swallow the draughtsmen and
mg dice: and in support of his objection, he pro-
psfi duced a piece of copper, through the swallow-
:hf ing of which, he said, a patient had died. It
his was then suggested, that they should have
my books. Dr. Bowie said, the patients would
be destroy the books. He said the patients could
be- not be trusted with knives and forks. I don?t
think that in any part of the establishment
i, knives and forks were used. The patients, I
ist think, had spoons from the first. The first
ay report I made was in 1866. The number of
patients early in that year was 162 males, and
eighty-nine females ?total, 261. At the latter
end of that year the number was 190 males,
and 108 females?total 298. The proportion
of patients restrained was large?much larger
than it ought to have been. The means of
of restraint used were bags, jackets, and mittens.
Dr. Bowie always represented to me that the
[ r , bags were used at night, especially in winter-
be dime, to prevent patients catching cold. If
ed they were used only for that purpose, I can?t
n> imagine there would be any objection to them.
i r . There were a number of restless patients, who
ig would not lie at night with the bedclothes
i,| over them, and it was necessary to put on
of them these bags, which were lined with flan-
ks nel. But on the 7th of September, 1868, du-
n ring an official visit, I found a patient in a bag
?a of a very different character. That patient
y was Dr. Carr. To the best of my recollection,
t, that bag was not lined with flannel, and it
jl was fastened round the patient?s neck. I for-
Vf get the nature of the fastening?whether it
was tied or padlocked. This was in the day-
?e time, when a patient had no bedclothes to
d kick off. Dr. Carr said he had been there
seven days. The bag was not very tight; he
i- could move his arms inside; but the bag was
e h> restrain him; not to keep him warm. I
,f conceived the treatment improper and barba-
-1 rous, and I ordered Dr. Carr to be taken out
e of the bag immediately. Dr. Carr was per-
f fectly quiet and perfectly rational. His
t hands and nails were tolerably clean,
and I asked him how he could re-
concile that fact with the statement that
he had been seven days in the bag. I
understood him to say that, in forty-eight
hours after he was put in the bag he managed
to free himself. The matter was investigated
and reported upon. Another case which at-
WILSON.
tracted my attention was that of a man
named M?Donald. I saw him in a strait-jacket,
exceedingly tight and fastened with two or
three padlocks, in such a way that he could
not move. He had committed two murders
in the asylum. The restraint was more se-
vere than was necessary, but it was much
modified by Dr. Bowie, at my suggestion. I
saw McDonald so restrained several times He
was also confined in a cell. He was restrained
both in the cell and out of it. I remember
Dr. Carr being put under restraint in the pad-
ded cell in January, 1860; but there was no
convenience, and the patient had to pass his
urine and faeces in the cell. Dr. Bowie provi-
ded means, after I mentioned it. That is the
latest case of restraint I remember. There was
a number of persons restrained in each year.
Mr. Fellows. ?How do you get it ?
Witness. ?From a return of Dr. Bowie. In
January, 1866, there were eight males and six-
teen females restrained; in January, 1857,
there were ten males and six females. In June,
1857, there was no restraint at all. The visi-
tors urged upon Dr. Bowie that, as in nearly
all the asylums in England restraint was
abolished, it was necessary that restraint
should terminate here. Dr. Bowie objected.
He stated that he did not believe in it?that
the violence of the patients was such as to
render restraint necessary, and that if restraint
were abolished, there would be a large addi-
tional expenditure, owing to the tearing of
clothes, &c. Eventually the objections were
overruled, and the return of restraint for
June, 1857, was nil. The man M'Donald, and
one or two other dangerous and violent pa-
tients, were still restrained. It was not until
April 1859, that a padded chamber was intros
duced. I don?t think it was-necessary in 1859
to resort to the restraint of the bag. The
privy accommodation, down to very lately,
was very deficient. The airing yard was a
close, confined place. In one of the airing
yards there was a seat with several holes in it.
This was used by the patients, and was open
to the view. The excrement ran into the
yard, and was afterwards shovelled away.
The patients on being served with their food
had their meat and potatoes together in a
small tin dish. It was a solid lump of meat.
This was in 1855 and 1866. The knives and
forks were introduced only at the suggestion
of the board of visitors, and on my urgent
request. They were not used to the extent
they ought to have been at the end of 1860.
Dr. Bowie never stated, to my recollection,
an instance of injury following the use of
knives and forks. I remember the case of
Antonio Vicari. In July, 1860, he was shut
in a dark wooden dormitory in F ward, which
was the place where the sick were kept. Both
of his legs were greatly swollen, and covered
with foul ulcers. They were not clean, and
they were without poultice or dressing of any
kind. The wooden ? dormitory was six or
seven feet long, by four or five feet wide. It
was a small, dark, ill-ventilated place. I re-
member the case of John Monckton. He was
found in a similar place in July, 1860. He
was suffering from dysentery?his stool was
not removed ?and he was eating potatoes and
mutton chops.


Mr. Michie. ?Nice food for dysentery.
Examination continued.?When I told
Dr. Bowie of it, he said the patient would die,
and it did not matter. Another lunatic,
named Germain, was found in a similar state.
His head appeared to have been blistered the
previous day, but the blistering ointment had
not been cleansed off, and his head appeared
very dirty. John Ford was in a similar con-
dition. He had a large abscess containing foul
matter, which required to be opened, but there
was no poultice or covering of any kind.
1 here was a sick-hook kept, with the names of
tne patients and their diseases, but of these
cases there was no entry, except that of Ger-
main. There was evidence of gross neglect
with regard to these patients staring you in the
face. The food which I found Moncton eat-
ing was not fit diet for a person in such a con-
dition. It was explained by Dr. Bowie that
tne man had fancied it and expressly desired
it, and it had been given him by the atten-
dant, as there was no chance of his living
these patients had been under Dr. Gallant
charge but Dr. Callan was away, and Dr
Bowie had gone the round of the wards that
morning The board reported on that case.
1 .did not approve of the manner in which the
sick record was kept. I desired Dr. Bowie,
betore that, to put before the board the record
ot the sick, and he stated that it was before the
Parliamentary Committee then sitting. I
asked for the notes on which the record was
rounded, but these notes simply contained the
names of the patients and the medicines I
asked Dr. Bowie whether from that he could
put down the diseases, and he said he could?
he had a good memory, There must have been
about 564 patients in the asylum at the begin-
ning of 1860, and 690 at the end. I generally
calculate the sick at about ten per cent. At
that time there was an hospital ward for
females only. The sick male patients were
scattered through F ward. I suggested that
there should be a stone building, with a fire-
place in it, for the male patients. Dr. Bowie
xux?* carry out the suggestion. Instead of
that, he knocked four of the wooden cells into
one. The stone building would have been
more suitable. Vermin would be much
more under command in a 'stone building
than in a wooden one.
Mr. Wyatt.? Was it possible to retain in
memory all those patients without a proper
record ?
Witness?l could not do it. It is impossible
for the board of visitors to know what is the
treatment of the patients unless a proper
record is kept. I ordered the record to be put
on the board table, but it was evaded from
time to time. My impression is, that 1 gave a
written order on the subject. A billiard table
was provided for the institution when it was
under my department. I don?t remember
ever seeing the patients play; but every time
I went to the asylum I saw the attendants
playing billiards. I mentioned the matter to
Pj ? P owle - He said it was unfortunate that
I did not see the patients playing. I was at
the institution regularly once a month, and I
was there also at other times. I was always
there when patients were to be discharged. I
also urged upon Dr. Bowie the necessity of
having out-door amusements for the patient
At my suggestion, he applied for stumps, hat
and balls. Several times when I went out t
the asylum I saw people in the grounds ei
gaged in cricket; hut as I approached th
players, I found that whilst the lunatics wei
placed in the correct positions in ? the field,
the batting and the howling seemed entire!
to be performed by the attendants. On on
occasion, after observing this state of things,
went into the asylum to discharge a patiem
When I came out I saw a patient bowling, am
I heard him say?? What is the use of gettin
me to bowl ? I can?t bowl a bit.?
Mr. Michie.?Dr Bowie was not afraid the 1
would swallow the bats ?
Witness.?l don?t know. He seemed t<
have a great deal of fear of some sort. Then
was not, until lately, a proper number of table
to allow the patients to sit down and havi
their food in comfort. It was not until ai
examination was made into the state of thi
asylum, and a report made by Dr. Pugh. Di

for them.

beneficial effect on the mind of a lunatic ?

I don?t know the practice of asylums in Eng-
land from my own observation, but reports
show that these things are supplied to .the
patients.
Cross-examined by Mr. Fellows. -- The
worst portion of the six years during which 1
visited the asylum was the early portion.
The institution gradually improved the whole
time I was connected with it. The first year
was bad, the next better, and there was a gra-
dual amelioration of the whole establishment.
I consider the distribution of the food in 1865
improper. I have always entertained that
opinion. I used to make reports to the Chief
Secretary.
Mr. Fellows called the attention of the
witness to reports made by him on the 7th
November and the 4th December, 1855, in
which he stated among other things that the
buildings at Yarra Bend were in good repair,
and kept in a state of cleanliness and order
conducive to the health of the inmates; that
the bedding and furniture were of a proper
kind, were kept clean, and were sufficient for
all the purposes required; that the food sup-
plied was of good quality and sufficient; that
it was well cooked, and that its distribution
was well adapted for the wants of the patients;
that the patients were treated with kindness
and humanity by the surgeon-superintendent;
and that the attendants performed their
duties with patience and temper.
Witness.?That was my opinion at that
time.
Mr. Fellows.? But that does not quite tally
with your opinion now ?
Witness. ?No, it does not,
Mr. Fellows. ?l asked you just nowwhether
the distribution of food in 1855 was adapted
to the wants of the patients. You said ?No.?
Here (in the reports) you say otherwise.
Witness.?l meant that the quality was


I, and that the quantity and division of
food was ample.
r. Fellows. ?But here you say, ? The dis-
ition of it is well adapted for the wants of
patients.? Now distribution would in-
e knives and forks.
Witness. ?It would include nothing of the
kind. It means that enough food was distri-
buted to each person.
Mr. Fellows. ? What do you mean by dis-
tribution ?
Witness. ?Simply that the qhantity served
out to each person was enough.
Mr. Fellows. ?Entries were made by you
of your visits to the asylum in the visitors? book ?
Witness. ?There was an entry made almost
every month.
A book called ?The Visitors? Book? was
handed to the witness, who was requested by
Mr. Fellows to read certain marked entries in
his handwriting The entries extended from
March 31, 1855, to August 9, 1858, and pur-
ported to be comments on the state of the
asylum by Dr. M'Crea and the other visitors.
Most of the entries in 1865 were to this effect ?
?The Board has minutely examined the asy-
lum, and found it in a satisfactory state.? In
1866 it was written ?? The state of the asylum
is as satisfactory as circumstances will admit,
but the accommodation is very deficient.? In
1857, the entries set forth ?? The asylum is in
a satisfactory state; the patients in on account
of the weather; several are engaged in read-
ing and playing on the bagatelle-board; the
Board happy to see the restraint diminish-
ing.? ? With the exception of the yards, the
drainage of which is not in good condition,
the asylum is in a satisfactory state.? In 1858,
?The asylum is very clean and full.? ?The
asylum is, on the whole, in clean and good
order, as usual.? ? The board are happy to
observe that the bugs have been reduced.?
? The number of lunatics in the yards, with-
out amusement or occupation, is very great,
but the board are convinced that, with a few
harmless means of recreation for the patients,
this evil might be easily decreased.?
Witness.?l may tell you, with regard to
these reports, that the Board of Visitors were
v ery anxious to have the co-operation of Dr.
Bowie, and they were desirous not to put in
the book a single remark reflecting upon the
asylum.
Mr. Fellows.? Then that book does not ac-
curately represent the state of things as you
found them?
Witness.?lt represents it so far, that when
the board saw anything satisfactory, they re-
corded it. There were things which the board
Bad to inspect. The food, the bedding, the
state of the wards; and if these were found
satisfactory, the board put down that the asy-
lum was in a satisfactory state. There was
another reason ?the board were anxious to
give every consideration to a man of Dr.
Bowie?s age, and they were desirous that he
should take the suggestions of the board in as
friendly a spirit as they were made.
Mr. Fellows. ? Now, as the head of the de-
partment, the estimates relating to the asylum
sent in to you before they went to the
Government.
Witness, ?That was always the case in each
year. So much was put down for provisions,
so much for bedding, so much for medical
comforts, and so on. I don?t remember any
detail beyond these.
Mr. Fellows. ?But did you never inquire
for the items from which these sums were
made up? For instance, when a sum was
put down for furniture, did you not inquire
as to what furniture was wanted ?
Witness. ?My impression is that I have
inquired as to what furniture was wanted. I
had power to alter the estimates before they
went in to the Government, and I have done
so with regard to food and medical comforts.
Comparing the estimates of one year with the
estimates of previous years, I have found that
Dr. Bowie?s estimate has been much greater
than I thought necessary, and accordingly I
have reduced it. It was clearly the duty of
the person in charge of the asylum to put
down knives and forks if he required them.
I suggested, as a member of the board of
visitors, that they should be used. A requisi-
tion was afterwards made for knives and
forks. Dr. Bowie said he had hit upon a plan
which, he thought, would suit all parties. He
bought a number of knives, blunt at each end
and sharp for about two inches in the middle
?sufficient to cut meat. These were bought,
I believe, from a friend of his; and the price,
as I afterwards ascertained, was about double
that of ordinary knives, which Dr. Bowie
could have had blunted on the grindstone. It
was in July, 1860, that I first saw Antonio
Vicari. He was covered with ulcers, and
was not clean. I know what they call bark
powder. I know it from dirt. There might
have been bark powder on the ulcers. There
ought to have been poultices on them. I went
out to call the attention of my co-visitors to
the subject, and on my return I found that
poultices had been applied, and stockings
drawn on to the patient?s legs. I believe Dr.
Bowie uses bark powder for dressings, but very
few people else. I don?t think it is used in
any hospital in the colony. I have had lu-
natics under my charge since I have been in
the colony, but not before. I recollect the
discharge of a patient named Keith. It was
in 1855 or 1856. I think there was some
difference between Dr. Bowie and myself on
the subject. As far as I recollect, Dr. Bowie,
instead of applying to the two medical men
who regularly discharged the patients, got out
two others, and sent their certificates to the
Chief Secretary. A representation was made
to the effect that the patient was a very vio-
lent and dangerous man, and I directed the
two regular medical men, Mr. Ford and Dr.
Youl, to examine him. The result of their
examination was that the patient?s discharge
was countermanded.
Mr. Fellows. ?The treatment of lunatics is
almost a subject of itself ?apart from the study
and practice of medicine ?
Witness. ?The treatment of lunatics is suf-
ficient to occupy any one person, but that
person must be a medical man. No one but a
medical man is qualified to take charge of
lunatics.
Mr. Fellows. ?And not every medical man ?
Witness. ?No.
Mr. Fellows. ?It is a separate part of pro-


fessional study, particularly in modern times ?
_ Witness. ?Yes. I have never been over a luna-
tic asylum out of this colony. A board was ap-
pointed to inquire into the lunatic asylum, but
I was not aware that it was at my recommda-
tion. The first board consisted of Sir Red-
mond Barry, Sir James Palmer, and myself.
That was, I think, in 1855. There was a second
board -consisting of Mr. Champ, Mr. Gill
(the architect), and myself? appointed to find
a site for a new asylum. I remember the
cottages (both sets) being put up at the Yarra
Bend. They were put up at my suggestion.
When I made the suggestion (which I ob-
tained from the Quarterly Review), Dr. Bowie
approved of the idea, but he afterwards
claimed the suggestion to be his own. This I
proved, in correspondence to be untenable.
I recommended at the first board meeting, in
1864. that the present asylum grounds should
be applied to some other purpose, and that a
new asylum should be erected on such a site
as might be determined on. I condemned the
building altogether from the first time I had
anything to do with it. It is in a perfectly
unsuitable place, considering half the patients
are melancholy and idiotic. I recommended
that an asylum should be erected on a hill,
having a cheerful view. I also recommended
that when the new asylum was erected a
superintendent, conversant with the latest
modes of treating lunatics, should be brought
out from England. I meet with criminal
lunatics in the gaol. A bag, similar to that in
which Dr. Carr was confined, is used in the
gaol at night to prevent people injuring them-
selves. The bottom of the bag is tied to the
bottom of the bed, and the sleeves containing
the patient?s arms are also fastened down.
The bag and the canvas jacket are the only
restraints used in the gaol. But in the gaol
there are no separate cells?they sleep in the
dormitory with other people; while at the
asylum there are a great many separate cells.
Mr. Fellows.? ls there not at Yarra Bend
a peculiar form of bedstead, to keep the
patients from rolling or getting out of bed ?
Witness.?There is a box bedstead (with a
moveable bottom), which Dr. Youl suggested
early in 1854; but I think it is a clumsy sort
of thing. [Model of the bedstead produced.]
Bedsteads of the kind are in use. Iron bed-
steads were procured afterwards. I suppose
the object of a visitor is to make complaints
to the superintendent, and see that the super-
intendence of the asylum is proper.
Re-examined by Mr. Wyatt. ?lf I had pro-
per places at the gaol I should not use the bag ;
for the lunatics, except as a covering at night. <
It is not necessary in applying such a bag to I
lace it up, and put several padlocks upon it. ;
The Yarra Bend Asylum was never crowded
to such an extent as the Western Gaol, where i
the lunatics are kept. They are sent down i
there from all parts of the country, and, as ]
vacancies occur in the asylum, are removed t
thither. I don?t remember an instance of bags i
being used in the day. The jacket is only 1
put on when it is necessary to restrain them, a
Mr. James Thomas Rudall, examined by I
Mr. Wood. ? I am a surgeon. I made a pout i
mortem examination of the body of Patrick r
Mullens on the 18th November, 1861, at Yarra | t
? Bend Asylum. No medical man assisted m
,- but the medical officers of the institution wei
- present a portion of the time. The body wa
t much emaciated, and there were numeroi
- contusions. Three ribs were fractured. A
- abscess was connected with the fracture t
?. the fourth rib on the left side. Other swei
I lings were connected with the fracture of th
I third and second ribs. I gave an opinion a
I the inquest that the fracture had not existe
; more than ten days. I formed that opinioi
i from the condition of the ends of the ribs, am
. from an abscess being connected with th
- lowest rib.
' ? W ood the fracture had existed mon
i than ten days, what would have been the ap
pearances at the end of the rib ?
Witness. ?Either repair would have com
menced, or the ends must have become dead
I gave ten days or thereabouts as the outsidt
limit. I myself think it was within ten days
By the Chief Justice. ?l think I examine!
the body from twelve to twenty-four hours aftei
death. There were also several contusions, whid
must have been of recent occurrence. Then
wasan abscess on the left elbow, one ontherighl
elbow, and another on the left thigh. Thej
must have been cat \ sed by an injury which musl
have occurred within a few weeks before death,
[Witness here read an account from his notes
of appearance of body, describing its condition
in medical language.]
Cross-examined by Mr. Fellows? l think
that within ten days after fracture the sharp
ends ofthe bones must commence to be rounded
off and the repairing process must set in. Nei-
ther things had occurred here. The bones were
P>st as it they had been recently broken. I
don t think it is possible the bones could have
been united and afterwards have become dis-
united. I have a strong opinion they could
not. Fractured bones, after being joined,
sometimes become disunited again from
scurvy. I don?t think that applies in this
case It is only in rare and extreme cases of
scurvy that such a thing occurs.
By the Chief Justice. ?There were no
symptoms of scurvy here.
Cross-examination continued.?There were
no symptoms of scorbutic dysentery. I be-
lieve there was no dysentery, but that the
utmost that existed was dysenteric diarrhoea.
That is my opinion as a medical man. Ido
not admit that if there had been scorbutic
dysentery that it would have accounted for
the appearance of the bones. Ido not think
that scorbutic dysentery would account for an
abcess round the ends of a fractured bone, and
coagulated blood round the ends of other
bones. An abscess may remain sometimes for
years, but not an abscess round a fractured bone.
Be-exammed' Mr. Wood. ?Separation of
united bones in consequence of scurvy or
scorbutic diarrhoea is of very rare occurrence.
In such a case there would be no injury
about the soft parts, therefore there
would be no abscess and no coagulation of
bloocl. simple disunion without violence
wouid not cause anything of that kind. I
believe that the edges of the bones could only
remain sharp when the fracture had been of
recent occurrence, or when necrosis [death of
the bones] had set in.


By the Chief Justice.? The appearance
presented by the bones in this case does not
support the view that the patient suffered
from scorbutic diarrhoea. The cases of a dis-
union of bones from such a cause are ex-
tremely rare. They are looked upon as a
wonder more than anything else. The other
injuries which 1 observed on the body might
have been inflicted by the patient himself.
Mr. Edwin Collier Whittenbury, examined
by Mr, Michie, said? l am a surgeon, residing
at Brighton. I was a frequent visitor at a
lunatic asylum near Quebec, which at that
time was the general asylum for the whole of
Canada. It was under the charge of a friend
of mine, and was about the size of the Yarra
Bend Asylum. On one occasion I was shown
the Quebec Asylum, in all its details. I
visited the Yarra Bend Asylum on one
occasion. I went to see a connection of
mine, named Wilmot. This was at the com-
mencement of 1869. I have spent many years
of my life in public institutions, aud I could
not compare the Yarra Bend Asylum with
these institutions with respect to cleanliness.
It was very dirty. I was formerly connected
with the Geelong Hospital. The uncleanliness
which I noticed at the Yarra Bend Asylum
was general rather than special I will men-
tion one particular circumstance. Having
heard that there were patients under restraint
at Yarra Bend, and not having seen anything
of the kind, I asked Dr. Bowie if he would
show me some patients under He
said, ? Oh, yes; I will show you several.? _He
showed me one case. I believe the patient
was a man named McDonald ?a tall power-
ful man. I believe he had not been attended
to for several days. At all events, Dr. Bowie
said ?calling to some of the keepers ??? We
had better attend to this case now; Dr.
Whittenbury wants to see it.? At a
given signal, the bolts were shot, and
four attendants sprang into the cell. Two
of the men seized the patient by the neck and
shoulders, and the others seized him by the
logs. The four men then threw him upon the
ground, and held him there, whi?e a fifth
attendant removed some straw and dirty
things out of the cell This occurred about
four or five o?clock in the evening. The cell
was very dirty. The attendant who took the
straw away afterwards returned with some
clean sheets and a blanket or rug. The patient
was naked, with the exception of having on
what is called a lunatic or skeleton jacket,
which fastened the upper portion of the arms
to the breast. To effect their escape from the
cell, the attendants bound the patient?s legs
and feet together, and then rushed out, and
bolted the door after them. The lunatic?s
strength was so great that he immediately
jumped up, and almost instantaneously burst
his bonds asunder, and sprang at the grating
of the cell. I had never seen such a case in
my life before, and was quite shocked. The
cell was a stone cell. No doubt the circum-
stance of the four men springing upon the
lunatic irritated him. I should think it was
altogether unnecessary to use such violence,
from what I have read as to the treatment of
violent lunatics. I think the proper course
would have been to have put the lunatic in a
padded cell. I think there would be about
the same number of patients at the Quebec
Asylum as there were in the Yarra Bend. The
Quebec Asylum was, in the first instance, a
private speculation of my friend, but was
afterwards subsidized by the Government.
There was no bed in Macdonald?s cell, and, I
believe, no mattress. There was some; straw.
The patient I went specially to see (Wilmot)
was in one of the cottages. He was not a vio-
lent lunatic. I thought he appeared very-
comfortable. He used to keep a diary, and I
found an entry in it under one date to this
effect? Scrubbed the cottage floor.? I be-
lieve the attendants used to make him scrub
the floor of the cottage. Another man, named
Murray, lived in the same cottage. Money
was paid for the maintenance of Wilmot in
the asylum, and I believe that was the case
with respect to Murray.
Cross-examined by Mr. Billing.? The state
of the asylum certainly did not compare fa-
vourably with what I have seen at public hos-
pitals. I was apprentice at Burnley Hospital.
I was resident-surgeon at Macclesfield Hospi-
tal, and I was also connected with an hospi-
tal at Manchester. There is not always every
accommodation for patients in hospitals. If
there was not accommodation in the Yarra
Bend Asylum for the number of patients con-
fined, I should not institute the same compa-
rison as I have made between its state and the
state of the hospitals which I have seen. The
comparison would not apply to the same ex-
tent. I did not go into Macdonald?s cell
when the keepers went in. I could see the
state of the cell at a glance. I don?t see why
there should not have been a padded cell in
the asylum'. I don?t know whether there was
one or not.
Re-examined by Mr. Wood.? Taking into
consideration the extent of the accommoda-
tion at the Yarra Bend Asylum, I don?t think
it was as clean as it ought to have been. I
could see at once the state of Macdonald?s cell.
There is another thing I may state. At the
Quebec Asylum the lunatics all appeared to be
cheerful, and my friend said it was very rarely
that any of them tried to escape. I did not
observe the same cheerful appearance in con-
nexion with the lunatics at the Yarra Bend
Asylum.
Mr. James Murson, examined by Mr. Wyatt,
said ?I am a house decorator. I finished a
contract at Yarra Bend Asylum in April, 1861.
I was there six months. I was a sub-contractor.
The contract I had was to paint and glaze the
large new buildings. I often took walks, early
in the morning, and at other periods of the
day, to see the state of the patients, and how
they were attended to. The first thing that
attracted my attention was the emptying of
urine and excrement upon the pathway lead-
ing to the large front doors of the main build-
ing of that portion of the asylum which was
appropriated for females, and also upon the
steps leading up to the door. On one occasion
I called the attention of two workmen on the
premises to this state of things, and to the foul
stench which arose from it. I took notes in a
pocket-book at the time, but I don?t know
whether I could find that book now or not. I
might find it at home. I have frequently


observed this filth lying about. I have seen
excrement lie there for weeks together. This
place was open both to patients and attens
dants. It was one of the usual ways of ingres-
and egress from the building. I never saw Dr.
Bowie there. I made a general complaint to
the attendants at the time, but they took no
notice of the matter. I thought of writing a
letter to The Argus upon the subject, but I
could not find time to do so. The pathway
was very dirty, and wet from the weather, and
boards were taken away from the contractor
to lay there. I was told they were laid there
for Dr. Bowie to visit the patients in that por-
tion of the asylum. On one occasion the doc-
tor came there, but the boards had been re-
moved by the contractor. The doctor was
much annoyed at this, and said if the paths
were not better he would not visit the patients
at that end of the buildings. On one occasion
I heard a scream, in a large yard in which the
female lunatics were placed promiscuously. I
looked, and saw one violent patient beating a
quiet one on the head with a stone. There
were both stones and pieces of wood lying
about the yard. I directed the attention of
one of the workmen to this, and also shouted
out for an attendant to come, but no one ap-
peared. At last a tall lady came. I thought
she was the matron, and I told her what was
going on, but, from the reply which she made,
I found she was a lunatic. I have often seen
the violent patients there beating the quiet
ones with sticks or stones, but I never saw an
attendant there. The stones lying about ap-
peared to be broken bluestone. They were
apparently stones which had not been cleared
out of the yard. I expressed astonishment
that they had not been cleared away. The
yard was enclosed with a wall, and I could
not get into it. I tried on several occasions
to get an attendant, but I never could succeed
in finding one. I mentioned to one of the
male attendants what I had seen, but no
notice was taken of it. I also complained of
some of the violent lunatics having axes.
Mr. Wyatt. ?They had axes given to them
instead of knives and forks ?
Witness. ?The axes were given to them to
cut down trees. I frequently saw patients
with a wild, mad look using sharp axes to fell
large trees; and also using shovels and picks.
I noticed the ventilators in the stone build-
ings, near Dr. Bowie?s residence, where violent
lunatics were confined. The tops of the win-
dow frames were covered with human excre-
ment. I noticed this at the time I first went
there, and also at the end of the six months.
The dirt was not removed during the whole of
that time. I pointed it out to some Germans
on one occasion. I noticed this excrement on
the windows of several of the cells. I know
Dr. Callan by sight. I noticed he had a pecu-
liar staggering gait, and heard him on two or
three occasions use violent language to atten-
dants. He appeared to me to be intoxicated.
The language he used was a kind of cursing
and swearing.
Cross-examined by Mr. Fellows. ?The only
person I saw visit the asylum was Mr. John
Thomas Smith. I saw him on the occasion
riding by smoking a short pipe (laughter), and
I said to myself, ? There goes John Thomas
Smith. I wonder if he will do anythin!
towards bringing about a better state oj
things.? I never said anything to him. I did
not see any visitors visit the asylum. I do
not know Dr. M?Crea. I never complained to
Dr. Callan. I thought it was utterly useless
to make any complaints. I had read a little
in books about the general management of
asylums.
James Stewart Johnston (the Commissioner
of Public Works), examined by Mr. Wood, said
?I studied for the medical profession, but
never graduated. I have been two or three
times at the Yarra Bend Asylum. I was last
there about eighteen months ago. I went on
one occasion with Mr. Watts, Dr. Youl, and 1
think Dr. M?Crea. That was not upon the last
occasion. Upon the last occasion I went along
with some of the members of a committee of
the Legislative Assembly. On both occasions
I went over the asylum to see its condition. I
went through the wards. I have been through
one or two private asylums at home. On the
two occasions I last visited the Yarra Bend
Asylum, I saw a good many of the patients in
the bags which have been described. Many
of the patients in these bags appeared quiet, as
if they might have been permitted to go about
the place under the charge of an attendant. I
went into the padded room with Dr. Bowie,
and he said it was of no use ?it was utterly
impossible to keep the patients from tearing
the walls to pieces. I think the room was
padded with coarse canvas. Ido not remem-
ber what led to Dr. Bowie?s remarks about the
inutility of the padded room. I think his
objection was, that the patients pulled the
canvas in pieces. I had some conversation with
Dr. Bowie, with reference to the new two-
storey buildings. Verandahs had been erected,
to allow the patients to go out in wet weather
to have exercise. I saw that the upper veran-
dahs were closed, and I asked Dr. Bowie the
reason why they were not used. He said it
would not be safe to let the patients be there,
as they would break through the wire-work.
I suggested that the barriers might be stronger,
and the doctor replied that the patients would
hang themselves to the barriers. I then
suggested that upright stanchions might
be erected, but the doctor said that he
would not be responsible for the patients if
they were allowed to use the upper verandahs.
I think Dr. Bowie received any suggestions
that were made to him in an unkindly spirit.
He seemed to regard a suggestion as a censure.
He stuck his back up, and was rather
obstructive and impracticable. Ido not know
whether there was any ward set apart for in-
curable patients. I remember that one of the
occasions upon which I went to the asylum
was during the hot weather, and 1 noticed
that the patients had no means of shading
themselves from the heat of the sun. They
had the ordinary clothing on. I could not
speak as to the condition of the clothing. I
went to the billiard room. I never saw
the patients on any occasion playing at
billiards. On one occasion, I saw a man
knocking the balls about, but I believe he
was an attendant. I don?t think I ever saw
any one in the reading-room. I believe, on
one occasion the door of the reading-room was


locked. I don?t remember seeing the piano.
I heard a man playing on the fiddle once when
I was there. (Laughter.)
Mr.MiCHiE. ?PerhapsitwastheScotchfiddle?
Witness.?l don?t think it was the Scotch
fiddle. It might have been made in Scotland.
(Laughter.) There was a man playing on a
fiddle, and one or two persons dancing, /.That
was the only thing I ever saw in the way of
amusement for the patients. Ido not think
I ever saw them playing at cricket, or any
[ other game.
Cross-examined by Mr. Fellows.?l think
one of my visits was made in 1860, and the
i other in 1861. I cannot mention the dates.
1 The last time I was there the two-storey
I buildings were finished. I think, considering
the crowded state of the asylum, there was not
much amiss in the way of cleanliness. The
brick cottages stand on a high part of the
1 reserve, but it is flat, and the drainage is not
! good. I do not know that any other part of
the premises stands on higher ground.
James Thomas Harcourt, examined by Mr.
Michie, deposed,?l am at present resident
secretary and superintendent of the Im-
I migrants? Home, Prince?s Bridge. I was for-
merly owner of a private lunatic asylum in this
colony. I had experience in the management
of the insane in the mother country for fif-
| teen or sixteen years. I was proprietor of a
lunatic asylum at home, and frequently visited
the principal asylums in England and Scot-
land. I know very little of the Yarra Bend
Asylum. I visited it in July, 1856, hut I did
not visit it again until January last. When
I first visited it, I thought it very inferior, in
comparison with similar institutions in Eng-
land. I thought the buildings very objec-
tionable, hut my visit was a short one. Dr.
Bowie kindly accompanied me through the
establishment, and showed me the main
features of it. I did not inspect it minutely.
I don?t recollect seeing any patient under
restraint. I did not ask to see any particular
cells, I merely looked at what Dr. Bowie
showed me. I saw no conveniences in the
institution for the proper management of
insane persons. With the disadvantages under
which Dr. Bowie laboured, it was impossible
to have the asylum as clean as it ought to
have been, the structure being of wood, and
there being no facilities for classification.
Mr. Michie. ?I am speaking of cleanliness,
it is possible to have wooden structures clean?
Witness.?l believe that it was impossible
to have the old wooden building wholesome
a nd clean. Mechanical restraint is all but
obsolete at home. There are some advocates
of the total disuse of mechanical restraint.
Upon this subject I have spoken with the first
authorities?Dr. Conolly and others?but I
have never found a substitute for a mild form
of restraint in particular ca-es.
Mr. Michie. ?What do you call a mild form
of restraint ?
Witness.?A great deal depends upon the
Person having charge of the patient. I may
r efer to a case in which a patient has ulcers
upon his body, and in which it is necessary
f� poultice the ulcers. Some patients would
tear off the poultices, and constant watching
would not prevent that. In that case a mild
form of restraint was required. I have also
known other cases in which a mild form of
restraint was required. It was necessary in
the case of a certain lady patient, who was
addicted to very dirty habits. The restraint
was a part of the treatment of the case, and
the patient was afterwards very grateful for
it. Insane persons generally have a very vivid
recollection of what passes during their pa-
roxysms of insanity. I have known restraint
used as punishment, but I object to the punish-
ment of an insane person. I object to punish
a being who does not possess his reason. I
would not order a person into mechanical re-
straint because in a moment of irritation he
may have struck an attendant. I saw the
man who had the bag put upon him in the
witness-box. I never saw a similar figure in
any asylum.
By the Chief Justice. ? A mild form of re-
straint in the case of a patient who tore poul-
tices off his ulcers would he to put him a long-
sleeve dress on, or muffle his hands. If that
did not effect the purpose, it would he neces-
sary to further restrain his hands. The treat-
ment required would depend a great deal upon
the nature of the case.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
?I nev r saw an asylum which had the same
character of buildings as the Yarra Bend
Asylum. There was no facility for the proper
treatment of the patients. There was no
suitable accommodation for their manage-
ment. If a patient showed violence, and was
likely to repeat his violence, I would not put
him under any mechanical restraint. I would
put him in a room by himself for an hour.
I heard Dr. Whittenbury describe the case of a
violent lunatic whom he saw in the asylum.
I have had many cases as bad as that under
my care. In such a case I would put the
patient in a room by himself for an hour, and
endeavour to get a promise from him that he
would be better at the end of that time. When
I have had a specific promise from an insane
person, I have generally known him to keep
it. If he broke his promise, I would have
him placed in a room. If he knocked
himself against the bars of the door, 1 would
then have him placed in a padded room. I
did not see any padded rooms in the Yarra
Bend Asylum when I was there in 1856. In
the absence of such appliances it might be
proper for a number of men to hold a patient,
if moderation were used. I have seen eight men
required to hold a violent lunatic. I have
seen such gloves as those now produced used in
asylums in England. The restraint required
would depend very much on the circumstance
of each case. I had once a patient under my
care who lost his life in a pond. In my hands
he was like a child, and I could lead him
easily. During my absence, one day, he broke
from his attendants, and ran to swim in the
pond. He swam across, but, in returning, he
was seized with the cramp, and was drowned.
I know that he was drowned in consequence
of being seized with the cramp. A superin-
tendent of an asylum might exercise a control
over the mind of a patient which could not
be exercised by another person. If I had been
there when this patient was drowned, I don?t
think the circumstance would have occurred.


The Attorney-General? You don?t con-
sider yourself to blame for the occurrence ?
Witness?Yes; I was held to be so.
Cross-examination continued. I had a
patient from Warrnambool in my establish-
ment. He would frequently secrete his own
excrement in his pocket and say it was gold.
That is a common feature with lunatics.
The Attorney-General.? ls that confined
to the mining population ?
Witness.?Not by any means. The only
remedy was to watch the patient; but with
ordinary vigilance on the part of the atten-
dants, it was impossible altogether to prevent
the practice. In consequence of the character
of the building at Yarra Bend, I believe it
was utterly impossible to carry out the ordi-
nary regulations of a lunatic asylum there.
Re-examined by Mr. Michie?ln 1856, the
cost of padding a room would be �8 or �lO.
If the Legislative Assembly would grant �lOO,
it would be sufficient for a dozen padded
rooms.
By the Attorney-General. ?Any room
might be adopted as a padded room. The
Yarra Bend Asylum was very crowded.
Re-called, and further cross-examined by the
Attorney-General. ?l have known Dr. Carr
fifteen years. He was sane when I first knew
him. fie is insane now. I consider him a
clever man gone mad. At one time I em-
ployed him as a medical officer in my private
lunatic asylum in England. One day, in con-
sequence of my finding fault with him for
neglecting his duty, he assaulted me, by
throwing a chair at me. He repeated the
assault two or three times. In consequence
of this, I dismissed him, and prosecuted him
for the assault, and he was convicted. Had
Dr. Carr been a patient of mine at the time
he assaulted me, I should have shut him in
a room for an hour or two. I should not have
placed him under mechanical restraint.
By the Chief Justice? lf a man?s pa-
roxysms of insanity extend over a number of
years, they would probably increase in vio-
lence. On the other hand, if he got more
demented, he might become harmless. There
is no rule on this matter.
By the Jury?Of course, I considered Dr.
Carr sane when I engaged him. I considered
him insane when I dismissed him.
By Mr. Michie.?l think he was insane
when he threw the chairs at me. It was not
a mere ebullition of passion. I simply repri-
manded him quietly for neglecting his duty.
I might feel a little natural irritation at his
neglect, but I spoke to him quietly.
The Chief Justice.? Did you prosecute him
for the assault ?
Witness.?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?Why did you prosecute him
for the assault, if you thought he was insane ?
Witness?He was not proved to be insane
with me. He had undergone no examination,
and therefore I thought I was justified in
giving him what the law provided.
The Chief Justice remarked that he could
not understand the witness?s prosecuting Dr.
Carr if he believed him to be insane.
By Mr. Michie.?l have read of the pa-
roxysms of insanity manifested by George
111. while in the hands of the Court physi-
cians, and of the great change which took
place in his conduct after he was placed under
the care of the Rev. Mr. Willis, and allowed
to dine with his family, and to use a knife
and fork. Several years ago I recommended
before a select committee, that the patients at
Yarra Bend should be allowed the use of a
knife and fork.
Mr. ? Job Phillips, examined by Mr.
Wyatt? l am a surgeon, residing at Prahran!
I have had experience in connection with
lunatic asylums in England. I was surgeon-
superintendent of a private asylum near De-
vizes. It contained about 180 patients. I
have also visited other asylums. I approve of
the system of moral restraint. The cure of
the patients depends a great deal upon the
moral treatment. I think it is the duty of
the superintendent of an asylum, if he has a
sufficient staff of assistants, to keep a diary of
every case under his care. It is considered
the duty of a medical attendant to take notes
of all the sipk cases. I think it would be
quite impossible for him to prescribe for thirty
or forty sick persons without taking notes of
their cases. I see no difficulty in making a
padded room for ordinary cases. It is difficult
to do so for exceedingly violent patients. Or-
dinary patients would not be so destructive.
In many cases, however, the patients are so
destructive that they would destroy an ordi-
nary padded room. In a superior padded
room leather is used. The other day, a man
at the Prahran watchhouse destroyed the
pitch-pine lining of his cell. If he could de-
stroy pitch-pine, he could destroy canvas
lining. Ido not approve of any system of re-
straint for punishment. I don?t admit the
term ?punishment? in connection with in-
sane people; and in very few cases, indeed, is
restraint necessary at all. I don?t think a
strait-jacket, with a canvas bag over it, should
ever be required. There is no necessity to
confine a man?s legs in a sack. If he kicked,
his boots might be taken off', and a pair of list
slippers placed on his feet.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.
?I think insane persons ought not to be
punished. To prevent them committing acts
of violence they may be put under restraint.
The Attorney-General. ?The most effi-
cient preventative is hanging, and yet, at the
same time, it is punishment. (Laughter.)
Cross-examination continued?if a great
amount of violence is used in putting a pa-
tient under restraint, then it becomes punish-
ment. If a violent lunatic killed a man, and
were likely to kill another, I should restrain
him from doing so. I do not think you can
call that punishing him. If you are obliged
to resort to means to prevent a lunatic repeat-
ing acts of violence, 1 don?t call that punish-
ment. There is a distinction between punish-
ment and restraint. The usual course to re-
strain a lunatic is to put him in a padded room.
Of course it depends upon the facilities of the
asylum. I have not inspected the Yarra Bend
Asylum. Compared with similar institutions
at home, it is very inferior.
The Attorney-General.? Just so; like all
other institutions in the colony, including the
press. (Laughter.)
Mr. Wyatt. ?And portions of the bar.


3k , Re-examined by Mr. Wyatt.? There is no
er difficulty whatever in constructing a padded
ed lWm ia any asylum. ? There would be no

4 Bend Asylum, . ~ ?
at Mr, William Roscoe Pugh, examined by Mr,
a Wood? l am a surgeon and physician, I was
appointed by the Government to inquire into
?i. the dietary arrangements at the Yarra Bend
n. Asylum, I visited the asylum in December,
A 1858. I saw the way in which the food was
a- distributed. It was distributed very unequally,
e- and there was a want of arrangement in the
I distribution. One day the diet consisted of
of rice, which was carried into the dining ward
of in a large tin vessel, about 15in. by 2ft. bin. in
ie size. The attendants put a quantity into each
of pannikin with a spoon, by guess-work, and
a the pannikins were arranged round the room,
of the patients being afterwards admitted into
d the room, I selected two plates, and the quan-
tity of rice on them varied materially, as was
?� unavoidable from such a system of distribu-
y tion. On one plate, I think the quantity of
>f rice did not exceed five or six ounces, while on
a the other plate there were fifteen or sixteen
If ounces, I sent a report to the Government on
f* the subject. On reference to that report, I
- now find that one plate had eight and a-half
0 ounces of rice upon it, and the other fifteen
? and a-half ounces. The way to distribute the
1 rice which I would suggest, would be to weigh
1 one or two rations, and apportion the rest, ac-
e cording to the eye, so as to make them as
? nearly the same size as possible. The dining-
-8 room was only sufficient for a part of the in-
? mates. The tin plates were packed in a heap
3 on the table. Some of the patients sat down
? to the table, but the others were served in the
5 yard. A number of the tins were carried into
f the yard by the attendants and placed on the
I ground, and the lunatics walked about eating
' their portions of the rice. Sonny of them rushed
> back, after they had eaten their own portion,
and seized with their hands a portion of the
contents of the other tins; and such a scene
"'as presented as I could hardly have con-
ceived to, be furnished in a colony like Vic-
'toria, I had recently returned from Europe,
and while there visited several asylums, inclu-
ding the Colney Hatch Asylum, and Bir-
niingham County Asylum, I was _ invited
to go through the details of the establishment
at Colney Hatch. Independently of the dif-
ference in the building between that and the
asylum at Yarra Bend, there was a great dif-
ference in the character of the management
�f the two institutions. At Colney Hatch
?Asylum the management resembled that of
an ordinary human family and a home. The
Patients sat down in comfort, and all the
asual observances of civilized society were
apparent; but the management of the Yarra
bend Asylum reminded me of the old convict
establishment in Tasmania ?there was no
order, no arrangement whatever. [Sensation.]
oolney Hatch is the Middlesex pauper lunatic
asylum. While visiting that asylum, I went
toto the worst ward with the superintendent,
an d a homicidal patient of the worst class
[ashed across the ward towards another
Patient. He was, however, stopped by the
attendants, and removed to a padded room.
I followed him there. He was not placed in
a strait-waistcoat ?there was not such a thing
in the establishment, nor any mechanical re-
straints. I also observed a female who became
extremely violent. She was removed to a
similar room, and was not subject to any
restraint, I don?t think it necessary that
four men should hold a patient on the ground
that he might be cleansed. I believe if the
patient had been in a padded room, he would
not have maintained such an amount of re-
sistance as has been described. Some lunatics
are of filthy habits ; but I do not know how
often and at what times they are cleansed in
English asylums. At Colney Hatch, the
larger number of patients exercise in the gar-
dens. For the other patients there are yards,
containing shrubs, and generally resembling
a garden, but having a wall round. I noticed
the billiard tables, I observed the cloths
were torn, and the cues without points, I
did not see any patients playing. It was not
such a table as I would like to have played at.
Cross-examined by the Attorney-General,
?I had been practicing in Tasmania, and I
visited Europe in 1854, The quantities of rice
which I saw distributed on the occasion on
which I went to the Ymra Bend Asylum were
not adjusted before the patients partook of the
rice. When I visited the asylum,. Dr, Bowie
offered to accompany me round, I told him
I did not, think it was necessary. I went
there in consequence of seeing Dr. M?Crae.
I am aw-are there was a difference of opinion
between Dr. Bowie and Dr. M?Crea as to the
dietary. Dr. M'Crea reduced the scale. I
was one day at Colney Hatch Asylum, That
was in 1857, or the beginning of 1858. I also
visited the -Birmingham County Lunatic
Asylum for a few hours. I base the opinions
which I have expressed upon those visits, and
upon visits I have paid to other asylums.
Re-examined by Mr. Michib. ? I was anxious
to see the new mode of treating the insane,
and I therefore visited several asylums. My
attention was particularly directed to the two
I have mentioned.
At the close of the examinatipn of Mr. Pugh,
Mr, Michie said that there was only another
witness?a woman?to call on. behalf of the
defendant, but she had left the court, with the
impression that her evidence, would not be
wanted to day. As it was now near the usual
hour for adjourning, perhaps his Honour
would have no objection to adjourn the court
for the day?
The Chief Justice intimated that he had
no objection to do so,
The Attorney-General consented to the
admission of the coroner?s inquisitions with
reference to the inquests held at the Yarra
Bend Asylum, reserving his right, however,
to make any objection to any of them which
he might afterwards see fit,
Mr, Michie asked that the extracts from
the report of the Parliamentary Committee
appointed to enquire into the state of the
Yarra Bend Asylum which were quoted in the
articles containing the alleged libels should be
admitted to be correct extracts from an au-
thentic report. Otherwise, he thought it was
open to the other side to argue that they were
fabrications or too highly coloured extracts.


After some discussion on this point,
The Chief J ustice said that there was no
issue raised upon the pleas as to the extracts
or the report, and that therefore they were not
admissible in evidence. Of course the learned
counsel on either side could refer to them, and
extract any argument from them which in-
genuity could suggest. The alleged libel, how-
ever, would be considered as a whole, and was
not connected with any reports.
The Attorney-General intimated that he
should call witnesses in reply to the evidence
given by the defendent?s witnesses, and that
the examination of the plaintiffs witnesses
would probably occupy four or five days. He
hoped his Honour would agree to adjourn the
court at an early hour on the following day,
in order that all parties engaged in the case
might have a little rest, after their fatiguing
labours of the last three days.
The Chief Justice said he had no objec-
tion to adjourn next day about one o?clock.
The Court then adjourned, at a quarter to
four, until ten o?clock on Saturday morning,
FOURTH DAY.
On the opening of the court this morning,
The Chief Justice intimated to counsel that
he had looked more closely at the record, and
he had looked at authorities, and he was not
quite clear that in mitigation of damages the
defendant was not entitled to show that the
extracts in the libel were true extracts. If
counsel for plaintiff were not at liberty to
admit that special fact, he should like to hear
argument on the point.
The Attorney-General said the only diffi-
culty he felt in connexion with the matter
was, whether they could go beyond the mere
extracts in the documents from which they
were taken, and read the context.
The Chief Justice observed that he was
disposed to think not. But he had not consi-
dered the ppipt. All that Mr. Michie desired
the previous day to have admitted was, that
the extracts in the libel, as set out in the
record, were true extracts.
The Attorney-General remarked that the
context might show that the extracts bore a
different interpretation to that put upon them
in the libel.
The Chief Justice observed that if plain-
tiff?s counsel did not make the admission,
defendant would have to put in the document
from which the extracts were taken.
The Attorney-General said he bad no
objection to admit the genuineness of the ex-
tracts.
Mr. Wyatt wished the Attorney-General to
know what admission he was making, because
there were in the article extracts which were
not placed within inverted commas.
The Attorney-General said he would exa-
mine with Mr. Wyatt the documents from
which the extracts were taken, and admit all
that were taken.
The Chief Justice observed that he did not
want to shut out the defendant from proving
the extracts.
John Edward Cooper was then called for
the defendant, and examined by Mr. Wyati
He said ?I am a cook and waiter. I
second cook for two years and a-half at thi
Yarra Bend Asylum. I left about February
1861. I remember a patient named Wood
being found dead, about four months before
left. He was a patient in F ward. Georgi
Fraser, the night attendant, was dismissed or
that account. When first I went to the asylun
the kitchen was very indifferent; but sooi
after I went there, the investigation with Di
M?Crea commenced. I had some of thi
patients in the kitchen. Some were naturally
very clean, and some were naturally ver
dirty. When I have found them dirty I havi
taken them over to the wards again, i
remember a patient named Laing. He wai
very sly. I never saw him assault or kill any
body.
The witness was not cross-examined; am
with his evidence the defendant?s case closed,
The Attorney-General remarked that thii
was the time for the defendant?s counsel t<
sum up his evidence.
The Chief Justice said he thought thi
defendant?s counsel ought to sum up after thi
rebutting case had been heard. Perhaps
strictly speaking, he had a right to sum uj
now, and reply on the rebutting case also; but
it would he more convenient if he reserved
his address until the close of the evident*
adduced on the plaintiff?s side.
The Attorney-General admitted that hf
had seen cases in which the defendant?s
counsel addressed the jury at both stages ol
the trial, hut he did not know that this wai
the proper practice.
Mr. Wyatt intimated that the defendant's
counsel would waive his right to address the
jury now.
After some further discussion on this point
The Chief Justice repeated his opinioi
that the defendant?s counsel had a right tc
sum up his own evidence now, and make a
general reply upon the plaintiff?s case also;
hut he thought it would be more convenient
for all parties that he should only address the
jury after the examination of the plaintiff?s
witnesses.
This course was tacitly assented to by the
counsel on each side, and the examination of
witnesses on behalf of the plaintiff was pro-
ceeded with.
The following evidence was adduced before
the Court adjourned
Dr. Charles Stilwell, examined by Mr.
Billing, deposed,? l am a medical practi-
tioner, and have practised in this colony
nearly ten years. I was brought up In my
father?s lunatic asylum, and after that I had
lunatics under my treatment at a private
lunatic asylum in England. My father's
asylum was near Uxbridge, and there were
about thirty patients in it. I was also con-
nected with a lunatic asylum at Philadelphia,
called the Pennsylvanian Lunatic Hospital.
There were about 850 patients in that institu-
tion. _ I was there two yearn. I cannot say
that in the treatment of lunatics mechanical
restraint can be dispensed with altogether.
There are some cases in which mechanical
restraint is necessary. For instance, a suicidal
patient must either be put under restraint, or


e must be four or five attendants with him,
ratch him, and prevent him committing
of violence. Of the two, I think mecha-
-1 restraint the most judicious, as it would
ate the patient much less than if he
*gled with antagonists. In speaking of
hanical restraints, I mean what are com-
ly called strait-jackets. Some of these
ets have pockets to put the hands of the
mt into. They are of different construe-
in different institutions. I have seen
the padded room in lunatic asylums. The
cases in which the padded room is more par-
ticularly applicable are cases of acute mania,
where the patient's reflective powers are for
the time altogether obliterated. If a patient
were dangerously violent I don?t think he
could be sufficiently restrained by placing
him in a padded room. I did not hear the
case of M?Donald described yesterday. If a
lunatic had committed two murders, and was
extremely violent, I should consider some
mechanical restraint decidedly the most mer-
ciful treatment of him. I was at the Yarra
Bend Asylum rather more than twelve months
ago, and again about three months since. I
went over the institution, and remarked va-
rious matters connected with it. I observed
the general appearance of the patients who
were there. There appeared to be a great
number of chronic cases. Without going into
special things, I should say that the general
impression left on my mind, after passing
through the asylum, was extremely favour-
able. I saw one or two patients under re-
straint, who were pointed out as dangerous
patients. I was not told their names. They
had on the peculiar form of jacket which has
been exhibited in court, and a sort of sack,
with pockets for the arms inside. They were
walking about with the other patients ges-
ticulating, but they seemed perfectly comfort-
able. They did not seem to be annoyed by
the confinement, and the restraint did not
seem to excite them in an inordinate degree.
With patients of that character I might have
adopted that mode of treatment, or possibly I
wight have modified it. It depends very
much upon each particular case. My atten-
tion was not attracted to the amusements
provided for the patients. The last time I
Went to the asylum I went about half-past ten
o?clock in the morning. I observed the cot-
tages at the asylum. I think them very
useful, especially in the case of convalescent
Patients. I could not speak decidedly upon
the management of the cottages, because my
visit was a very cursory one. I went into one
of the cottages, which appeared to be very
comfortable, and fitted up for all domestic
Purposes. The patients there appeared to be
Very well satisfied. I did not observe how
many patients there were. Dr. Bowie went
round the asylum with me during my visit.
Die patients appeared to be pleased when they
attracted his notice. The institution struck
me as being ordinarily clean ?as clean as hos-
pitals usually are. I did not observe anything
that struck me as a want of cleanliness. I
had no opportunity of observing the dietary
�t the patients. In the case of a patient who
did not keep his bedclothes upon him I should
made use of some mechanical means to keep
them upon him. I would have a quilt with
straps to fasten it to the side of the bed. I
have never seen bags used in the treatment of
lunatics. I have seen gloves placed on a pa-
tient?s hands, and the hands fastened down
to his side with a belt; that would be in cases
where the patients were liable to attack per-
sons?in fact, in the case of dangerous patients.
I consider that in such cases the use of gloves
might be found necessary, and also the use of
the strait-waistcoat. I should not consider it
safe to allow a patient who had committed
two murders to be without restraint at all
times. The treatment depends very much on
observation. Many patients who are very
violent at one time, are very passive at an-
other ; and it would be very unjust to keep
that patient in restraint when in a passive
mind. As a general rule, I consider restraint
would be necessary. I examined the cooking
apparatus at the Yarra Bend Asylum. I
thought it was a very efficient establishment
altogether. I went through it to observe it.
I did not see any of the patients at their
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.? l think I
was at the Yarra Bend Asylum in March, this
year. I went at the invitation of Mr. Weekes,
M.L.A., and accompanied that gentleman, to
give him the benefit of my private opinion.
We went on a Sunday morning, and we had
gone through one or two of the wards before
Dr. Bowie knew we were there. I do not
know where he was. I made a mere cursory
inspection of the asylum. I did not inspect
anything minutely, as a person would who
was officially appointed to inspect the institu-
tion. When I was at the Philadelphia Asylum
mechanical restraint was used there, under a
very modified form, and unde.r the strict sur-
veillance of the principal physician. I consider
that a very important part of the case. Re-
straint would not be allowed under any cir-
cumstances unless I was acquainted with it.
It is necessary that there should be particular
observation as to when the restraint is abso-
lutely indispensable, and when it may be dis-
pensed with, because where unnecessary it
would have a bad effect, inasmuch as the
patient would know it to be unjust. I have
never seen bags used at the Philadelphia
Asylum. I was not in court when a bag was
exhibited upon the person of an attendant,
but I heard it described.
Mr. Michie? A bag fitting closely, and close
up to the throat, as if the person inside of it
were a mummy, to use the term which has
been used?
Witness.?l never saw that at the Phila-
delphia Asylum, nor anything like it.
By the Chief Justice ?The old-fashioned
strait-waistcoat is a waistcoat with sleeves,
like the one now in court. It is made to draw
in with strings at the end of the arm. _ There
are two loops in front ; through which the
arms are placed at ease, and the strings are
tied behind the patient, the arms being in
this position. [The witness illustrated the
position of the arms, which were crossed in
front of the body, and appeared quite easy.]
Cross-examination continued?l was over
Hanwell Lunatic Asylum twenty years ago.
At that time violent patients were there put


into a padded room, without further restraint.
Abuses may exist in public institutions, with-
out the public being able to detect them. I
should like to modify that answer, ?I mean
without the public being able to immediately
detect them, unless they had a more strict sur-
veillance of such institutions than they have
at present. It is possible for the attendants
at an asylum to telegraph from one to another
the approach of -visitors or of the head of the
establishment. When the strait-jacket is used
for restraint, it must be under the surveillance
of the chief physician.
Mr. Michie. ?It is almost superfluous to ask
you if it is proper for a physician to delegate
that important duty, which depends so much
upon nice and scientific observations, to an
unskilled and uneducated subordinate ?
Witness. ?I should say it is wrong to do so.
The Chief Justice.? lf I understand Dr.
Stilwell aright, he would only allow restraint
in cases were it is absolutely necessary, and
then only under the surveillance'of the chief
physician.
Cross-examination continued. ?It is, in fact
part of the curative process, and is more re-
quired at the commencement than at the
latter part of the treatment. I was not at the
Yarra Bend Asylum long enough to give a
candid answer as to the classification. I did
not see the reading-room. I did not see any
amusements going on. It is necessary that
there should be a reasonable assortment and
classification of the inmates of an asylum,
with respect to their previous habits, position,
&c. It must be very plain to every one that
placing refined and educated people along
with those who are uneducated must have a
very bad effect on the mind of the former. It
would be veiy unjust to associate persons of
low habits with gentlemen. Although wholly
or partially insane, educated men have, to
some extent, the same habits and modes of
conversation as when they are sane ; there-
fore, being associated with uneducated men
would be a source of annoyance to them, and
whatever annoyed them would have a had
effect on the brain, and would produce further
deterioration of the brain. I have not had
the advantage of reading Dr. Conolly?s hook.
I have seen extracts from it. [Mr. Michie
here read an extract from Dr. Conolly?s work,
describing the author?s system at Hanwell
Lunatic Asylum, and stating that mechanical
restraint had been abolished at that institu-
tion, with very beneficial results.] I do not
go to the same extent as Dr. Conolly. I think
a lunatic asylum requires to be governed
exactly in the same way as a man would
govern a family of children. If you exclude
fear of punishment altogether, I do not see
how you are to govern a lunatic asylum. Ido
not mean corporeal punishment. To say to a
lunatic, ? If you are not quiet you will have
to go into that padded room,? would he to
keep him in fear of punishment. I think
some mechanical means of restraint are re-
quired in an asylum, but Dr. Conolly says
none are required.
Mr. Michie remarked that Dr. Conolly?s
words were to the effect that mechanical
means of restraint had been almost entirely
dispensed with.
The Chief Justice thought the witne!
substantially agreed with Dr. Conolly. J
understood the witness to say he would m
have corporeal punishment, but moral punis!
ment.
Mr. Michie.? You would not punish a ma
by confining his hands, or his whole body?
Witness. ?I think you or I would prefer I
have our hands confined, and ivalk in tl
open air, to being shut up in a solitary room
Mr. Michie. ?Well, Dr. Stilwell, perhaj
you had better speak for yourself. (Laughtei
But you will grant that the sort of jacket pi
upon a lunatic should be so loose as not!
constitute anything like painful restraint ?
Witness. ?Certainly.
By the Chief Justice?l never saw tl

My father conducted his asylum on the pri
ciple of a family. I believe he was one
those who first commenced the more mercif
treatment of lunatics.
By Mr. Michie.?l was not at the Yan
Bend Asylum during any meal hour.
Re-examined by Mr. Billing? l did nots
the attendants ? telegraphing? at the Yau
Bend Asylum. The patients who had tl
hags on, with their hands in the pockets, di
not seem to be at all annoyed at the trea
ment.
By a Juryman. ?I was not at the Yam
Bend Asylum before 1861.
Elizabeth Powell, examined by Mr. Fit
lows, said ?I am one of the attendants at the
Yarra Bend Asylum. I first went in Decem-
ber, 1852. I left of my own accord, and was
away a short time, and then returned. I
I think I left in 1853, and returned in 1851.
My duties were to attend to the wants of the
female patients, and see Dr. Bowie?s instruc-
tions carried out by myself and any one
assisting me. On the admission of a patient.
Dr. Bowie immediately saw her, and gave in-
structions what should be done with her. I
am acquainted with the manner in which the
female patients have their meals. When I
first went the food was cut on trays in the
kitchen, and then put on plates, and a plate
was given to each patient. The patients ate
their food with a metal or wood spoon as a
rule, but some of the patients were allowed a
knife and fork. Those were special cases. After-
wards a change was made, and spoons were con-
fined to the violent patients, knives and forks
being allowed to all the quiet ones. That change
took place about four years ago. A tray contain-
ing a number of plates was taken into each
ward, and the plates were then distributed.
There would probably be twenty-four patients
in a ward. They sat round a table, covered
with a cloth, to partake of their meals. That
was always the case. When I first went to the
asylum my ward was A ward. After the cot-
tages were built, I was removed to G ward, J
ward being appropriated for the sick. I went
into the other wards occasionally. I had a�
opportunity of noticing the rooms, furniture,


bedding, &c. I always thought them clean.
Pr. Bowie would not allow any dirt to remain.
The matron?s duty was to inspect the female
department daily. She did so once or more
every day. Her name is Rebecca Challicombe.
I remember a reduction in the dietary scale
being made, three or four years ago. At that
time I was in one of the cottages. In that
cottage the patients were delicate people, who
never ate much at any time, and the reduced
scale of dietary was sufficient for them, but in
many parts of the asylum there were com-
plaints that it was not sufficient. The patients
manifested their discontent by violent be-
haviour, one patient snatching another?s spoon
and food.
The Chief Justice? l am not taking a
word of this down. I don?t think it is evi-
dence.
Mr. Fellows. ?A great deal was said about
the food on the other side.
The Chief Justice. ?Not about the quan-
tity of food being insufficent.
Examination continued. ?We never used
restraint without Dr. Bowie?s orders. Some-
times we used a jacket or bag, or muffled
gloves. I have seen both bags with sleeves
outside and for the arms to remain inside.
When Dr. Bowie gave an order to use a bag or
jacket, he told us which kind to put on. If
a patient would not keep her clothes on, for
instance, Dr. Bowie would very likely order a
bag to be put on her. If a sick patient threw
her clothes of, we might be ordered to put a
bag over her, and a blanket over that, to keep
her in bed. A bag was never used in the day-
time unless for a patient who was in bed.
Sometimes complaints were made by the pa-
tients as to these bags. Dr. Bowie sometimes
ordered the bag to be kept on for a certain
time, and at the end of that time we took it
off. If no order was given, Dr. Bowie would
visit the patient again. I saw the supply of
medical comforts, &c., for the patients. The
quantity was not limited. These comforts
consisted of arrowroot, sago, milk, wines, and
brandy. If anything more delicate were re-
quired, it was supplied by Dr. Bowie himself,
and not supplied by the Government. There
were various amusements for the patients?
such as bagatelle, billiards, draughts, &c., for
the men; and I have seen shuttlecocks and
battledores for the women, and dances, con-
certs, piano, &c. A dramatic society was
formed by the attendants, for the amusement
of the patients. (Laughter.)
The Chief Justice.? Was there tragedy or
comedy.
Witness. ?Both.
Examination continued.?The patients at-
tended the representations with much plea-
sure. Dr. Bowie inspected the asylum at
various hours. We never knew when he was
coming. When he went round the wards he
generally carried a small book and pencil with
him. When the medicines were distributed,
they sometimes passed through my hands.
They were supplied in bottles, which were
labelled and dated. The bottles were ordi-
uary medicine bottles, of various sizes. I
have never known a female, patient to be in a
dirty state for a length of time. Occasionally
they would get dirty, but it was our duty to
clean them, and that was always done. When
Dr. Bowie visited the patients, he did not
annoy them in any way. They were very
glad to see him, as a rule, and I never saw
them manifest any dread of his appearance.
The patients were restrained by sacks when
they were violent?for instance, when one
patient struck another. If I saw a patient
strike another, I should report the case to
Dr. Bowie, and act according to his instruc-
tions. I never did anything without his
orders, and when I received his orders, I
acted accordingly. Dr. Bowie objected to the
patients being locked up unless he found they
would injure others by being at large. He
wished violent patients who were locked up
to go out daily. When a violent patient was
taken out, she went out in a jacket, and was
accompanied by two or more attendants.
Some of the patients are not able to feed
themselves, and we feed them with a spoon-
If they resist, Dr. Bowie feeds them him.
self.
Cross-examined by Mr. Wyatt.? The pa-
tients who required to he fed by the atten-
dants very rarely resisted. There were for-
merly six fiemale wards. There is one attendant
to each ward, and a number of assistants.
The wards which are at present appropriated
to females are distinguished by the letters
A, C, F, G, I. My present ward is F and part
of A ward. At one time I was in No. 8 cot-
tage. That was a little more than a year ago.
The wards were clean on all occasions. It
was impossible for filth and excrement _to
remain for months around the paths leading
to the main building. I never saw anything
of the kind. If another witness has said he
saw it, he has said what was not true. The
tables which are now in A ward were there, to
the best of my knowledge, in 1852. There
were two tables, and they would seat thirty or
forty persons. I have sometimes seen the
matron inspect the female wards three or four
times a day. I never saw her miss a day. I
never put on a jacket or hag without Dr.
Bowie?s orders. Dr' Bowie gave verbal orders,
and they were carried out. I believe
there was a record kept of how those orders
were carried out. The matron kept that
record, sometimes from our verbal reports
and sometimes from her own observation. _ If
the matron was not present when the restraint
ordered by Dr. Bowie was put in force, the
case was reported to her. I cannot say what
Dr. Bowie wrote in the memorandum-hook
which he carried with him. As a general rule,
Dr. Bowie ordered a patient?s hair to he cut
before it was cut. We never acted against his
orders, hut we might sometimes act without
them. ? Ido not know Dr. Barry. I do not
remember the case described of a woman s
hair being cut for breaking a pane of glass.
It might have occurred in another ward, or I
might have been absent from the asylum at
the time. I have not known an instance in
which patients have beaten each other and
not been reproved. I remember a patient
named Fingar. She would be between
eighteen and twenty-five years of age. She
was under my care during the time I had
charge of No. 8 cottage. I have never known
her have a day?s illness since she has been in


the asylum. Ido not know which cottage
she is in now, or under whose care she was in
1860, but I have never lost sight of her.
Re-examined by Mr. Fellows. ?In a case
in which Dr. Bowie orders a blister to be put
on a patient?s head he might not order her
hair to be cut off first, but I should not be
such a fool as to put the blister on without
removing the hair. Ido not remember any
other cases in which the hair was cut off
without Dr. Bowie?s orders. I should not
think of cutting it off for punishment. It
was Dr. Bowie?s wish that the hair should not
be removed without his orders.
By the Chief J ustice. ?l know of no in-
stance in which the hair was taken off as a
punishment.
William Cowley, examined by Mr. Fel-
lows, ?I was formerly an attendant at the
Yarra Bend Asylum. I went there in August,
1856, and remained there until the 9th of
May, 1857. I recollect a patient named Dr.
Carr. He was in D ward, which was my ward.
At the time he was brought to the institution
I was on night duty. I recollect Dr. Carr
striking an attendant named Phillips in the
eye with a pannikin.
Mr. Michie.? Did you see it?
Witness?No; but I heard of it ten minutes
afterwards. For that Dr. Carr was put into a
cell. Dr. Carr was in a very violent and ex-
cited state. He was swearing and making a
noise. I heard him say how he would
murder Dr. Bowie. I can?t say whether I
reported that to Dr. Bowie. When Dr. Bowie
came round the ward, at nine o?clock at night,
he ordered Dr. Carr to be put in a bag. Dr.
Carr was in the cell at the time, and had on a
jacket. Phillips, Kennedy (another atten-
dant), and myself put him in the bag, Dr.
Bowie standing at the cell-door at the time.
The bag was a canvas bag. There was no-
thing in it but a blanket, which was wrapped
round Dr. Carr. (A new-looking bag pro-
duced.) That is not the sort. (Another new-
looking bag produced.) That is not the sort.
(An old-looking bag, narrower than the two
before exhibited, produced.) It was a bag
similar to this, but the lacing came further
down, an d it was sewn up, instead of being
open at the bottom. It came up to the
shoulders, and was fastened round the neck.
The Chief Justice. ?Could he move hand
or foot when in the bag ?
Witness. ?He could move his arms slightly.
We had great trouble to put him in. He was
dreadfully violent at the time. He offered to
strike us, and tear ns to pieces.
By the Chief Justice. Before he was
aware of our intention to put him into the
bag he was lying on the bed, with the jacket
on. The violence was offered when we com-
menced putting on the bag. He then resisted
as much as he could.
By Mr. Fellows. ? The object of taking off
the jacket and putting on the bag was to put
Dr. Carr to bed.
Mr. Michie. ?Bag and bed seem to be
synonymous terms.
Examination continued. ?The bag, I should
say, was the easiest for him to sleep in. The
jacket was worn with the arms in pockets
inside, and was laced up at the back. Dr. Carr
asked about three o?clock in the morning to
be let out of the bag. He was swearing and
going on fearfully up to that time. I said I
could not let him out without orders from Dr,
Bowie, who came round about eight o?clock
That is the jacket (produced) usually worn in
the asylum.
By the Chief Justice.? lf a patient confined
in a bag told me that he wanted to relieve
himself, I should go to another attendant,
and with his assistance, lift the patient out of
the bag. I don?t remember a patient asking
to be let out to relieve himself.
By Mr. Fellows. ?I remember a French
patient named Francois Hebert. I never saw
him ill-treated at all. He was two nights in
D ward, and was then removed into B ward,
I had, in my night duty, to look over B, D,
and H wards. Hebert was under my charge
(a;S night attendant) for three months. I was
night attendant for only five months; the rest
of the time that I was in the asylum I was
on day duty. I never saw Hebert subjected
to ill treatment. I have seen him sometimes
in a bag.
By the Chief Justice? He was put there
because he was very violent.
By Mr. Fellows. ?The bag was put on at
night. I never saw it used in the day. I
have seen Hebert several times in the refrac-
tory-yard, with a jacket on.
The Chief Justice. ?You say that the bag
into which you put Dr. Carr was more com-
fortable than the jacket. In what did the
comfort consist ?
Witness. ?He could put his hands down,
and I should think he could lie easier in the
bag than in the jacket. I should say the
jacket would be tighter.
The Chief Justice. ?l cannot appreciate
the comfort. In the one case the patient had
a perfect use of his legs ; in the other he was
restrained.
The Attorney-General. ?But without the
bag he might have rolled off the bed, and
have been without the blanket which was in
the bag.
Examination continued. ?The asylum was
clean so far as I saw. I saw no dirt about
during the time I was there. There were no
bugs, lice, or other vermin, about the wards
that I was in. I don?t know of a patient
being sentenced to bread and water, or any-
thing of that kind. I had to administer medi-
cines to the patients at night. The medicines
were in medicine bottles, and each bottle was
labelled with the patient?s name and the
time at which the medicine was to be given.
I had no difficulty in distinguishing them.
My instructions were, if any illness, or any
thing out of the common, occurred during the
night, to go immediately and call up Dr.
Bowie. I never had occasion to do that. My
instructions, in the case of a patient becoming
refractory or violent, were also to go and tell
Dr. Bowie, but I don?t remember ever doing
so. I never saw any of the day attendants
drunk. There was no billiard-table when I
was there, but there was a bagatelle-board in
H ward. Cricket was also played. I have
played at it myself. I know Coates. He was
there about five weeks before I left.
Mr. Fellows. ?What sort of a patient was he ?


Witness.?He was the same as the rest,
.aughter.) I saw no difference between him
id the rest.
Mr. Fellows. ?Do you mean to say that
they were all like Dr. Carr ?
Witness.?No; I believe that Dr. Carr was
one of the worst I saw.
Mr. Fellows. ?Well, he was like the others,
except Dr. Carr?
Witness.?About the same, I saw no differ-
ence.
Mr. Fellows. ?What did you particularly
observe in him ?
Witness. ?When first I went there I saw
him working in the garden, along with three
or four more lunatics. He seemed to take the
lead over the others, instructing them what
to do.
Mr. Fellows. ?Do you know what symp-
toms he exhibited of being insane ?
Witness. ?He always appeared very fast in
talking.
The Attorney-General. ?He has kept that
habit since.
Mr. Fellows.? What was his particular
weakness ?
Witness.?He used to talk very fast and at
random at times. I remember, when in the
garden one day, saying to him, ?Are you
married, Mr. Coates ?? He replied, ? I have
had forty-seven wives, and I shall have three
more ?that will make fifty. Will that do for
you ?? (Laughter, in which Mr. Coates him-
self, now a spectator in the gallery, very
heartily joined.)
The Chief Justice. ?That you think a
proof of insanity. Was there any one to direct
the gardening except him ?
Witness?He had the whole control over
the other patients working with him, as far
as I saw.
By Mr. Fellows. ?During the time I was
there I did not see the beds bedaubed with
urine and excrement, nor lime thrown on the
floors to cover excrement. With regard to the
day arrangements, as I observed them when a
day attendant, the food was sent to the wards
from the kitchen. Each patient had for break-
fast a pannikin of tea, and bread on a tin
plate. This was set down at a table having
forms on each side. There were twenty-three
or twenty-four patients in D ward, and there
was room for all at the table. After breakfast,
the patients would go out into the yard and
Walk about. The dinner was brought up from
the kitchen in tin plates, with wooden spoons.
The food consisted of potatoes, cabbage, and
heef, cut up into small pieces?quite small
enough for eating. There was plenty of room
for the patients in B and H wards, as well as
in D ward. I never saw the food supplied to
the patients in the yard on the ground. There
was no difficulty in the way of patients seeing
the visitors whenever they came. They
always had access to them if they so wished.
I don?t believe that any one caught 500 or
600 bugs in one night at the asylum, I don?t
remember whether Coates was in the habit of
making complaints. I don?t rememer that he
tad a fit while I was there.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie? The nearest
approach towards insanity that I ever observed
in Coates was that remark about the wives.
We did not put him in the bag or jacket for
that. He seemed to have control over the
three men who worked in the garden, as any
ordinary head gardener would have. He gave
directions as to the management, and laying
out of the gardens. He was a well-conducted
man. When I was a night attendant, I could
in the day-time lie abed, or go about the pre-
mises, or, on leave from Dr. Bowie, go away
from the premises. I never saw any of the
attendants drunk. I have seen the attendants
play at bagatelle. I have played myself. I
have seen card-playing among the attendants
after eight o?clock?after they had done duty.
They have played, not in the room where the
patients were, but in their own room. Some-
times the patients who were up later than
others might be in the room where the card-
playing was going on.
By the Chief Justice. ?Some of the mildest
of the patients would sit up to a later hour
than others. I never saw the patients sitting
about on the ground taking their food. As a
general rule, in H, B, and D wards every
patient sat down to his dinner. There was
room for all.
By Mr. Michie.? There were about twenty-
four patients in D ward, about thirty-eight in
B ward, and perhaps thirty or thirty-four in
H ward. The food was brought in from the
kitchen on a large tray, which was placed on
the table. Each attendant then took three or
four plates at a time, and placed one before
every patient. The patients were arranged at
the table before the food was distributed.
Mr. Michie. ?It never could happen, then,
that some ate the supply of two or three,
while others perhaps went unsupplied ?
Witness. ?I never saw it done. During the
time I was there, I saw every patient come
andsit down, and receive what wasputforbim.
Mr. Michie. ?Perhaps you did not look par-
ticularly.
Witness?l could not be in the three wards
at the same time.
Mr. Michie?But perhaps in the particular
ward in which you were, you were not parti-
cularly vigilant in seeing that each patient
got his share ?
Witness?l was. There were two or three
attendants in each ward while the food was
being distributed.
Mr. Michie. ?Did Dr. Bowie see that the
medical comforts were consumed by the per-
sons for whom they were ordered ?
Witness. ?He could not be present in all
cases. He had to trust to the attendants.
Mr. Michie. ?But supposing that the at-
tendants themselves bad a weakness for
medical comforts, was it possible for them to
take some ?
Witness.?Yes, if they chose to be so mean.
I know the Highbury Barn, in the immediate
neighbourhood of the asylum. I have had a
glass of ale there on returning to the asylum
from Melbourne. I have never seen any of
the other attendants there ._ I don?t know of
wine intended for the patients having been
consumed by the attendants. I have never
seen the medicines in ? old tom? or square
bottles. The medicines used to be dispensed
by Dr. Bowie himself, and his son, Thomas
Bowie. The age of his son was perhaps six-


teen or seventeen. I have seen some hugs?
not very many?in the wooden cells. I don?t
think it possible that a person could have
seen there a tumbler full of bugs. We white-
washed the walls to keep the place clean and
healthy.
Mr. Michie. ?Was it not done to keep under
the bugs as much as possible ?
Witness.?Perhaps it was. I understood it
was done to keep the place clean and healthy.
There were no knives and forks when I went
to the asylum, nor when I left.
Mr. Michie.?l understand you to say, with
respect to Dr. Carr, when it was determined
to take away his jacket and replace it with a
bag, that he was lying on his back in his bed.
He was quiet enough at that time ?
Witness?He was lying down there?swear-
ing.
Mr. Michie. ?Then we have the jacket
taken olf, and the bag put on ?
Witness.?But a blanket was put round
him, and the bag was put on to prevent him
catching cold.
Mr. Michie.?Was that done every night ?
Witness. ?This is the only time I can re-
member.
Mr. Michie. ?He must have been subjected
to cold every night in the same way.
Witness. ?That is the only occasion that I
remember.
Mr. Michie.- The only occasion you re-
member of his being kept warm.
Witness. ?I have not been in an asylum
before, and I don?t know anything about the
proper and efficient management of an insti-
tution of the kind. I know very little about
Hebert. He did not die whilst I was at the
asylum. I don?t remember whether he took
to his bed while I was there. I never had oc-
casion to call up Dr. Bowie at night to a
single patient. I chiefly spent the night in
walking about from one ward to another, I
sometimes sat down and read for half an hour
in the dayroom. I never remember going to
sleep. I might.
Mr. Michie. ?If anything of that kind had
occurred, your reporting power to Dr. Bowie
was of no use.
Witness?l never remember going to sleep.
Mr. Michie?lf Hebert had made com-
plaint to you, of course you would not have
understood him ?
Witness.?l should not, as he was a French-
man.
By the Chief Justice?l never saw a
jacket and bag put on at the same time.
At the close of this evidence the Court ad-
journed until Monday.
FIFTH DAY.
The following evidence was taken to-day
in support of the plaintiff?s case.
John Harbottle, examined by Mr, Fellows.
?I arrived in this country in 1854. I was
afflicted with lunacy on board ship. On
arriving here I stopped for a week with a
friend on Emerald Hill. I was then affected
with lunacy, and was removed to the Western
Gaol. I was taken by a friend to the Swans-
ton-street Police Station, and given in char]
and I was then sent to the Western Goal f
seven days? medical treatment. At the Weste
Gaol- I was put into the yard among t
prisoners. I had a jacket on occasional
My hands were fastened across my breast,
did not see a bed there. I had to lie on t
floor, and my bones were through my skin.
Mr. Michie submitted that the inquiry h
nothing to do with what occurred in t
Western Gaol.
Mr. Fellows said the examination (
showed the value of Dr. M?Crea?s evid(
as to the treatment in the Western Gaol.
The Chief Justice ruled that what t
place in another building could not be
ceived as evidence.
Examination continued. After I was
three months in the Western Gaol, I was
removed to the Eastern Gaol, and there
I remained three months. I then went into
the Yarra Bend Asylum. I was treated with
kindness at that place. I arrived there in the
afternoon, near tea-time. My clothes were
changed, and I was washed. Afterwards I
was turned into the yard with other patients,
and then I was called in to tea. Tea was put
on the tables in pannikins?a piece of bread
being beside each pannikin. I went to the
asylum in March, 1865. I was there three
months. At the end of that time I was dis-
charged cured. I used to get my food regularly
with the rest of the patients for about a
month. After that I went to work in the
grounds of the asylum. I was asked by one
of the attendants whether I wished to go to
work. The first work I did was wheeling
sand for making a road. I kept at that work
about a week, and then I was set to coffin-
making and other carpentering. I am a
carpenter by trade. I had no reason to com-
plain of the treatment I received. After I left
the asylum, I was away up country for three
or four months. On my return, I made ap-
plication to Dr. Bowie for an attendant?s place
at the asylum. I got it. I was an out-door
attendant, working outside with the patients
most of my time. I was afterwards engaged
there as carpenter, under the Public Works
Department. I hold that situation still.
During 1856 and 1857, I had charge of a tent
occupied by twenty-one patients. My duty
was to attend to them in the evening, put
them to bed, get them up in the morning, wash
them, and hand them over to the day atten-
dants. I had to administer medicines to the
patients at night on several occasions. The
medicines were in proper bottles, bearing
labels giving directions as to how the medi-
cines should be taken. Balls, dramatic
entertainments, cricket, football, and skittles,
were provided for the amusement of the
patients, and were open to the patients
from six o?clock in the morning until
(in the case of some patients) nine o?clock
in the evening. I have seen jackets used in
the case of patients having blisters on their
heads, to prevent them pulling olf the blisters;
also when they have been very violent. I
have likewise known bags put on patients
who would not stop in bed, on going to bed.
I know Dr. Carr. I never assisted to put him
in a jacket, but I have seen him in one. I


have seen him very violent, and threaten to
strike the attendants. I have heard him dare
the attendants to come into the room where
he was.', This was when he was confined in a room.
I have seen Dr. Carr go about the ground very
rational to all appearance. I remember Dr.
Carr being imt into a jacket for striking one
of the attendants with a tin pot, and cutting
his head. I did not see the blow, but I saw
the cut. He was afterwards put into a
jacket. I have seen Dr. Carr put into a bag
at night when going to bed, because he used
to tear up his bed-clothes, and destroy every-
thing in his room. I recollect Dr. Carr, after
a ball and supper, getting up and proposing a
vote of thanks to Dr. Bowie for the kindness
he had shown to the patients. I think that
was in 1857 or 1868. I have played bagatelle
with Dr. Carr several times. When I was an
attendant I played very often with the
patients, and Dr. Carr in particular. I re-
member Coates. He was a very talkative
kind of man; his tongue was continually
going during the time he was in the asylum.
He used to work in the garden. Grapes,
melons, and peaches were taken from Dr.
Bowie?s garden, and placed on the table in
the day-room, where the patients were al-
lowed to go. My! workshop was about 100
yards from the garden. I saw nothing while
Coates was there of human hones and limbs
about the grounds. The rooms were cleaned
every morning when the patients got up; and
during the day, If dirty. I have seen plenty
of excrement on the walls, but it has never
been allowed to remain. I have not seen
lime thrown upon it. The beds wcre'changed
every morning, if dirty, and clean blankets
and sheets provided. Dr. Bowie was in the
habit of going round, in a general way, twice
a day, and as often as he was reqn ired he was call-
ed. I have seen him examine patients who were
sick, feel their pulses, and prescribe for them,
using at the time a pencil and book. We
used to give the patients their medicine in a
pannikin, measuring it by means of a marked
glass. The pannikins were clean, and kept
expressly for the purpose in some of the atten-
dants? rooms. Glasses were afterwards sub-
stituted. The medical comforts were given
to the patients according to the directions on
the bottle labels.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?At the
time I was removed from the gaol to the
asylum, I was very weak and low-spirited. I
was supposed to he insane. I was also very
weak from the treatment which I had re-
ceived. I was sent to the gaol for medical
treatment, hut I got no medical treatment
there. I came direct from the ship to Emerald
Hill, and there, at the house of some ship-
mates, I stayed a week. My friends brought
me to the Police-office at Swanston-street, and
asked what I was to be done with, as I could
not eat anything, and did not like to go to
bed at night. I was brought before the Bench,
and sent to the Western Gaol for seven days?
medical treatment.
The Chief Justice. ? Beyond the question
of bad spirits and want of appetite, were you
suffering from anything ?
Witness. ?I was very quiet, and never said
a word to any one, unless asked a question.
The Chief Justice. ?I wish that could he
said of every other person.
Mr. Michie. ?The silent philosopher was a
man of that description, and he was not sup-
posed to be insane.
Cross-examination continued. ? I was in
good health during the passage out until a
month before my arrival. I was badly
treated. The medical officer was generally
intoxicated, and I never got any medicine.
During the four months up country I was en-
gaged in farm work sheep-shearing, and
so on.
Mr. Michie.? And then you came hack to
Melbourne. Was it a fancy of yours to go to
the Yarra Bend for employment ?
Witness.?l thought that as good as any-
thing else.
Mr. Michie.? Comfortable lounging sort of
employment?was it not ?
Witness.?l always had my hands pretty
well blistered with working. I had to saw
timber and make coffins.
Mr. Michie.? That was while yon were a
patient ?
Witness.?And afterwards too.
Mr. Michie. ?Then it was on account of the
liveliness of the employment that you went
back to the Yarra Bend ?
Witness?l did not see much liveliness
about the employment.
Mr. Michie? Although a carpenter, you
did not particularly affect the making of
coffins?
Witness.?When we are in Australia we are
obliged to do as we can, not as we would.
Mr. Michie.? What I want to understand is
why you should prefer leaving the employ-
ment which you had for a number of months
outside the Yarra Bend, and go to work as
hard, or harder, there ?
Witness. ?One reason was, that I would be
getting �2 a-week, while I could be getting in
the country only �l. I could not get work at
the carpentering. When the Theatre Royal
was building I asked for a job, but could not
get it, although I am a regular tradesman, and
had served my apprenticeship. There were
plenty of men without me, so I went up the
country sheep-shearing. I have never seen
skulls and bodieslying about the grounds of the
Yarra Bend Asylum. I have seen three bodies
on the shelves of the dissecting-room. I have
never seen in the rooms any filth which has
not been removed immediately. I have been
carpenter and attendant at the asylum ever
since 1856. There has been another carpenter
within the last twelve months. I get �126 a
year, and board and lodging, for my services.
I was at the asylum when Wainwright was
there, and some months before. The patients
I had charge of occupied a tent adjoining F
ward. They were moved into F ward during
the day, and I had charge of them during the
night. I have seen Dr.Carr put into a jacket;
he had plenty of room to swing about his
arms in front. I have tried on the same sort
of jacket. Not a month ago I put one on,
with one of the attendants, expressly to try it.
Mr. Michie. ?Then you and the other atten-
dant had some doubt as to what would be the
nature of the sensation.
Witness.?l said to Andrew Young, ?Put me


was broken, but the impressions left were as
if handcuffs had been on the wrists. I did
not notice any other marks about his person.
When he was in the bath he was covered
with water.
The Chief Justice. ?Did you dry him, or
did he dry himself ?
Witness. ?He dried the forepart, and I dried
the after part.
The Chief Justice.?ls it usual for patients
to dry themselves in that way ?
Witness.?lf they are capable of doing so.
It is our place to dry them as quickly as pos-
sible after the bath.
The Chief Justice.?Did you see the man
all round his body while perfectly naked ?
Witness. ?Yes. I saw him before he went
into the hath, and after he came out; and
when Dr. Bowie saw him that night. I only
rubbed his back; he rubbed himself in front.
He had a towel, and I had a towel. The door
of the bath-room was open, and some of the
patients were present at the time. While
Mullens was in the bath I stood alongside, to
see whether he washed himself well or not.
He washed himself all over. He could wash
himself as well as I could wash myself. The
bath stood on the floor, and Mullens had to
step over the side to get into it and get out
of it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.?l not only
saw, but I had peculiar opportunities of
observing everything about Mullens? person.
He was a proportionately built man.
Mr. Michie. ?Pretty muscular ? .
Witness. ?So far as the muscles of his arms
went.
Mr. Michie. ?If he ever became emaciated
itmust have been while he was in the asylum?
Witness.?l expect so; but I did not see
him after I left my ward. I don?t think the
bathing business occupied a Quarter of an
hour. I did rub him, and he did not dislike
it. Before Dr. M'Crea saw Ford, his ear had
been poulticed three days, but he had not
worn the poultice well, and we had to use the
padlock until the morning of the third day.
On the afternoon of the day after (the Bth
September) the padlock was resumed, because
Ford did not keep on the poultice well. I
cannot say whether he had taken it off fre-
quently before. The poultice was on twenty
minutes before Dr. M'Crea came in. An
attendant, named Robert Harper, had charge
of Mullens at night, while he was in F ward.
Harper is still at the asylum, but as a day
attendant. I believe Johnson succeeded Con-
way as attendant in the ward where Fitz-
gerald died. Johnson and Conway are both
in the establishment now.
Mr. Michie. ?How often did you put Fitz-
gerald into a bag ?
Witness. -I can?t say how often. A fort-
night might pass, when in his quiet fits,
without putting him into it. Then he would
take a fit, and never rest night or day.
Mr. Michie. ?Would there be days when he
would never be out of it ?
Witness. ?He was taken out in the morn-
ing, and very often changed at night. We
never put him in the bag without acquaint-
ing Dr. Bowie. I have often gone to Dr.
Bowie at twelve o?clock at night, and told
him Fitzgerald?s state; and he has told me
to put him in the bag, and that he would
come down by-and-bye and see him. I have
seen some bugs at the asylum. I think I was
there about twelve months before any effort
was made to get rid of the vermin. 1 never
saw thousands upon thousands there. When
I was cleaning the bedsteads I saw a few.
Mr. Mjchib,?Was it not at the suggestion
of the visitors that this cleansing process took
place ?
Witness.:?l don?t know at whose suggestion
it was.
The Chief Justice. ?During the eighteen
days that Mullens was under your care did
you observe anything about his habits?
whether he was violent or quiet, dirty or
clean ?
Witness.?He was dirty and restless. He
would scarcely sit down to take his meals.
I have seen him once or twice strike two of
the other patients in the yard. He never
showed any violence towards any of the at-
tendants.
By the Jury.?l frequently washed the floor
of the night-room in F ward, in 1857. It was
done only during the heat of the day. Hot
sand and lime were then put down, so that
the floor should be thoroughly dry before the
patients went in in the evening. I could not
say positively how many times a month it
was washed. I am sure it was done once a
month. It was scrubbed with sand and lime
and water, with a wooden scrubber.
Mr. John Thomas Smith examined by Mr.
Billing, deposed?l have visited the Yarra
Bend Asylum. I have been an official visitor
there for upwards of nine years, and I also
visited the institution privately before that
time. I have visited it 400 or 600 times alto-
gether. I generally went once or twice a
month, and made entries in the visitors? book,
I did not find the asylum in such a state as
one could wish; but, considering the appli-
ances Dr. Bowie had, in was generally, almost
invariably, satisfactory. In making the
entries in the book I was not influenced by
any consideration for Dr. Bowie. The entries
were generally made by the board of visitors.
Dr. M'Crea used to be chairman of the board,
and I was chairman at one time. The visitors
included Dr. Fades, Mr. Barker, Dr. M'Crea,
and other gentlemen. Upon some matters
connected with the management of the insti-
tution Dr. Bowie took one view and the
visitors took another. I believe Dr. Bowie
was conscientious in the opinions he expressed,
and the board were also conscientious in the
opinions they entertained. Many things re-
quired for the institution were applied for, and
not supplied for months. I myself pointed
out to the Government that the institution
was suffering from want of certain necessary
things, and they were not supplied for a con-
siderable time afterwards. Dr. Bowie enter-
tained a strong opinion as to the new buildings
and Dr. M'Crea held an opposite opinion. The
brick buildings are in a very excellent posi-
tion, and very well adapted for their purpose,
if there were plenty of them; but they have
not kept pace with the requirements of the
institution. The board were in the habit of
conferring together every time they met as to


any suggestion that might he made, and the
results of the discussions were entered in the
visitors? book. Some of the buildings were
built of bluestone?honeycombed?which con-
tained myriads of small holes. This stone
encouraged the vermin. An attempt was
made to" burn them out with canvas, but that
was not successful. The Board of Works tried
in vain to suggest a remedy. In one of the
rooms one of the patients stuffed the holes in
the wall with plaster to keep away the vermin
-thus showing that one of the lunatics could
do what the Board of Works could not do.
(Laughter.)
By the Chief Justice.?l do not think that
walls built of this sort of bluestone could be
kept clear of vermin, unless they were white-
washed. The walls were frequently washed?
so often that the whitewash had to be scraped
off again. I have been about the grounds of
the asylum hundreds of times. I have never
seen any parts of human bodies hanging upon
the trees. I have never seen human hones or
skulls lying about. I do not remember having
visited the institution with Dr. Barry on the
occasion to which he referred I cannot re-
collect, but no doubt Dr. Barry may be correct
in what he has said. Ido not remember the
case of the boy, thirteen years of age, who
wanted nutriment. I have no recollection of
the case of the woman having her hair cut off
for breaking a pane of glass. If such a thing
had occurred I should have made inquiries
about the matter, if I thought the woman?s
statement was a credible one. You often
cannot rely upon what a lunatic says. I re-
member the board giving some directions with
respect to Dr. Carr. At times Dr. Carr was
quite rational, and was allowed to go about
the grounds. The board recommended a
laxity of treatment in the case of Dr. Carr,
which they afterwards saw reason to regret;
and they therefore gave orders that he should
be treated like the other patients. I myself
found he had taken advantage of the privi-
leges which had been allowed him. The order
to treat Dr. Carr like the other patients was
given by the board on the 6th of July, 1861.
That entry was my own. 1 found several
other entries made by me as to visits paid to
the institution, and the result of them. [Wit-
ness here proceeded to read a number of en-
tries which he had made in the visitors?-
book, commencing on the 18th September,
1853, and extending over some months follow-
ing. The entries were principally to this
effect? Establishment in excellent order.
Every attention appears to be paid to the
comfort of the inmates.? ? All things satis-
factory. Additions necessary to classify and
accommodate the inmates ? ? The establish-
ment requires to be enlarged, in order that
fheremay be a proper classification.? ?The
establishment is in excellent order.? ? Visited
at the dinner-hour. Found food abundant
and very good.?]
During the reading of these extracts.
The Chief Justice remarked that he
fought it was unnecessary to examine the
witness as to the entries in the visitors book,
a� he had already stated that he considered
me state of the asylum, generally speaking, to
1)6 satisfactory, considering the appliances
which Dr. Bowie had. Anything farther as
to the entries in the book was a matter for
cross-examination.
Cross-examined by Mr. Woon, ?On the 2nd
September, 1858,1 find the following entry:?
? B ward was not very clean, the bedding in
bad order, and several urinals half full of
urine, in the associated dormitories. A com-
plaint was made by a patient (Dr. Carr) of
ill-treatment by the attendants, of being de-
prived of water for washing for seven days, and
that his strait jacket was not removed for seven
days. Some of this statementwas borne out bythe
attendant Fitzgerald. Several female patients
were in bed, under medical treatment, all of
whom were not entered on the medical note-
book. A rug in one of the cells in C ward
was eaten by rats, several of which animals
were seen by the board.? (Laughter.) I
think it next to impossible to get rid of rats
in that establishment. Some of the patients
were very dirty, and that had a tendency to
encourage vermin. After the walls of the
room to which I have referred were plastered,
the bugs were got rid of in that room. We
were constantly whitewashing the rooms to
get rid of bugs and for other sanitary purposes.
The whitewashing is done independent of
the board. I do not remember that it was
first recommended by the board to get rid of
the bugs. That process repeated would tend
to get rid of the bugs. The bluestone is of
the ordinary sort, but of a very bad descrip-
tion. It is full of holes?honeycombed. I
have frequently passed the dead-house, in
going to the patients? garden. I could not say
whether all the bodies were carefully removed.
I never saw any portion of bodies lying about
the door of the dead-house. Dr. Barry spoke to
me the other day about my visit with him.
I cannot remember that visit, but I would
not |altogether dispute it. I did go over the
asylum once with Dr. Barry. I don?t remember
his pointing to a boy, and saying, ? There?s a
boy who is starved.? Possibly he may have
said, or I may have said, ? There is a person
who wants a meal.? Some people always look
hungry, even just after they have had a meal. I
have visited various asylums at home. The
amusements at the Yarra Bend Asylum were
much increased at my suggestion. At first
Dr. Bowie had not space for many amuse-
ments. Anything that occurred tojthe visitors
as likely to promote the comfort of the in-
mates was suggested. Ido not remember who
suggested the billiard-table. Ido not remem-
ber a woman who had her hair cut off being
pointed out to me by Dr. Barry. There is no
special reading-room. In each ward there is a
table with books placed upon it, for the use
of the patients. I think I remember Dr.
Bowie objecting to the patients being allowed
to play at draughts. I think I was in Eng-
land when the inquiry took place into Dr.
Carr?s case. I see on one occasion about that
time my name is entered in the book by
somebody else. It is entered in the margin.
By the Chief Justice. ?If the entries were
not entered by myself, I cannot say whether I
was there or not upon those occasions.
Mr. Wood. ?Then the entries seem to he of
a formal character, if visitors? names can be
entered when they are not there.


Cross-examination continued. ?I was not
present on the Bth September, 18-58 ?on the day r
the inquiry was made into Dr. Carr?s case. I
remember a patient who called himself Elijah
making a complaint. The only complaints I
remember his making were, that he could not
drive a cow into the Yarra, and that a cock
was on a dung-hill. (Laughter.) He was not
capable of making any rational complaint.
Dr. Carr was allowed privileges. He was
allowed to walk about the yard, and to go off
the grounds on parole. His privileges were
abridged because he abused them. He broke
his parole, and came into town, and went to
the Governor. The board then determined he
should be treated as an ordinary patient, and
not indulged. He was deprived of the privi-
lege of going off the grounds of the institu-
tion. There is an entry on the sth of July,
1861, to this effect: ?? Dr. Bowie reported that
Dr. Carr had absented himself from the asy-
lum, and gone to town; and that in the hear-
ing of one of the board ?Dr. Eades?Dr. Carr
had conducted himself very violently: that
the returns of Dr. Carr?s attacks are now more
frequent and impulsive, and Dr. Carr should
be rigidly guarded, as all other ordinary pa-
tients; and, in the opinion of the board, it is
very unsafe and dangerous to allow Dr. Carr the
amount of freedom and liberty he has of late
enjoyed?the opinion of the board being that
Dr. Carr is the most dangerous man in the
asylum. The hope Dr. Carr appears to have
entertained of being compensated by a grant
from the Legislature, and being allowed to go
to England, appears for some time to have in-
creased his excitement. The food appears
very good, and abundant.?
In reply to another question by Mr. Wood,
Witness stated that upon the subject of re-
ceiving a grant from the Legislature, Dr. Carr
frequently got into a state of excitement, and
was a perfect raving maniac.
Mr. Wood.? Of what privileges was Dr. Carr
deprived ?
Witness. ?He was deprived of the privilege
of going to town, and of going about any part
of the institution at freedom. If a person
went into his cell now, I believe Dr. Carr
would strangle him, from what I saw of him
last night. I have seen Dr. Carr so violent
that an attendant dare not go near him. He
was striding about the room, and swearing
in a most fearful manner. I remember a man
called Shankland, who was in D. Ward.
Re-examined by Mr. Billing? There were
bagatelle, a billiard-table, cards, and back-
gammon boards at the institution, and balls
and concerts were frequently given for the
amusement of the inmates.
Mr. William Perry, examined by Mr. Fel-
lows, said ?I have been one of the visitors at
the Yarra Bend Asylum since the commence-
ment of 1861. I attended about once a month,
with the other members of the board. I have
also taken persons over the institution. I
have been all over the wards. I have gene-
rally seen them very clean, and the beds also.
I have turned the beds down. I have seen the
canvas underneath the beds decayed, and I
pointed the matter out, and was told that
there was not sufficient new canvas to replace
the old at present, but that that would be
done as soon as possible. There was no filth
about the floor. I have smelt urine in some
of the wards, in consequence of defective ven-
tilation. I have not seen any bugs. I have
heard complaints about bugs, and know that
efforts were made to get rid of them by white-
washing the walls. In the wooden buildings
it is impossible to get rid of them, except the
buildings were burnt down. It is difficult to
keep the bluestone wards clean, because the
stone is of a honeycomb, porous character. I
have walked round the grounds, and I never
saw any human bones about. I have visited
the asylum with Dr. Eades and Mr. O?Farrell,
and I once met Mr. Barker there. There was
generally a full board?five members ?pre-
sent. I have seen the inmates at the finish of
their meals, but not at the commencement. I
have seen the inmates at dinner, both in the
cottages and the bluestone wards. They were
all seated. I have seen the patients playing
at billiards, bagatelle, and cricket. I have
seen patients have the strait-jacket on, and I
once saw a patient with gloves on, which I
understood was because he had sores on his
body, and was in the habit of picking them.
I have frequently been round the institution
with Dr. Bowie. The patients seemed very
friendly with the doctor, and shook hands
with him. The principal complaint was, that
they wanted their liberty. Before I was offi-
cially connected with the asylum, I visited it
for nine or twelve months during 1860.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie? l did not
visit the asylum above three or four times in
1860. The grounds are very extensive, and
the attendants can see a visitor coming for a
considerable distance along the grounds
before he reaches the asylum. It is about ten
minutes? walk from the entrance to the
grounds to the nearest portion of the build-
ing?the new brick buildings. Dr. Bowie
usually accompanied a portion of the board
during their monthly visits. The hour of
visiting was generally two o?clock. That
rather interfered with the luncheon hour.
Sometimes I took lunch before I went, and
sometimes I had none at all. I had no
luncheon there. After the board meeting
was over, I have had a nobbier of brandy,
and some beer of the same description as,
that provided for the patients. (Laughter).
It is very rare that honeycombed bluestone is
used for buildings. I was generally a day
visitor, and did not see any bugs. I have
heard complaints of them. The smell of
urine was the most predominant smell I
noticed. I have been in the wards when they'
were free of smell. I have been over the
Melbourne Hospital. I did not notice the
same kind of smell there. I think it is better
ventilated.
Mr. P. A.. C. O?Farrell, examined by the
Attorney-General, said: ?I am the plain-
tiff?s attorney in this case, and one of the
official board of visitors at the Yarra Bend
Asyluim I was appointed one of the visitors
at that institution in January, 1861. I had
visited the asylum in a private capacity
during the year and a-half before I was ap-
pointed an official visitor. I believe I first
went in January, 1866. I frequently saw the
interior of the institution in its most minute


Hi details. There is a great difference between
tie t) ie accommodation which now exists at the
n- asylum and what existed in 1856. [Witness
ve here referred to a plan of the buildings, and
at described their situation. He classified the
e- buildings as stone buildings, wooden cottages,
gs crescent cottages, and new brick buildings.]
he wooden cottages were not built in 1856.
to There were very few patients at the asylum
he i n 1856 compared with the present number.
1 There are now about 700. There always ap-
e[ peared to be plenty of food.
3d The Chief Justice said it was unnecessary
U, to go into the quantity of food,
as The Attorney-General wanted to ask the
e * witness more particularly as to the distribti-
�| of the food.
I The Chief Justice hoped that he would
16 come to the distribution at once,
re Examination continued. ?I have heard Dr.
Pugh?s evidence about the distribution of the
re food; and I certainly say that unless what he
1 describes happened upon that isolated occa-
I sion the evidence was not in accordance with
is the fact. The food has always been properly
a. distributed among the patients, each patient
in getting his proper share, and always expres-
-7 sing himself as content.
Is The Chief Justice. ?Confine yourself to
it what you saw.
S' Witness. ?I have seen patients eating their
it food about the yard, and outside the doors of
the cottages, but that was their own choice.
There was plenty of room for all the patients
n at the dining-tables. On every occasion that
?4 I have seen the patients eating their food,
a from January, 1861, to the present time, I have
Is seen some of them eating it away from the
Q tables at their own choice. Previous to 1861
' e I had seen the food distributed, and it was
1- always distributed as I have described. I
ie heard the evidence given as to the verandahs.
4 The verandahs which were referred to are at
the new brick buildings. They are constructed
4 of thin wire, which the patients broke. It was
r - therefore ordered that the verandahs should
4 he shut. The visitors have ordered stronger
0 wire-work, but it has not yet been put up. I
5 heard the evidence about the wall, with a
ditch in front of it. I have not examined
18 that part to see whether there were deposits
)? of filth there. It is possible the patients
18 would put filth there. The board ordered a
Y Monthly return to be made of the number of
e Patients admitted, the number discharged,
the number put under restraint, the kind of
1 restraint employed in each case, and other
y Particulars. That has always been the rule
6 4nce I was a member of the board. There
8 Were five members of the board. They used
r to go round and inspect the institution in
Co 'iples.
e The Attorney-General.? The fifth man
1 ? toust have been by himself at all events.
? (daughter.)
. witness.?Perhaps a visitor might be late
5 ln , attending. I have gone round the asylum
1 with each of the other visitors at different
y tlr aes. Some of the visitors would inspect
some portions of the asylum, and the others
* inspect the ?other portions. Having
e ttlUs gone round and inspected the institution,
e We held a board meeting, and discussed what
we had seen during our inspection. I have
not seen vermin in any instance. There
might have been vermin without my seeing
them. I have not seen Dr. Carr in any violent
paroxysms. There could not have been any
bones about the ground, or any pieces of
human bodies in the trees, without my seeing
them. The only way in which I can account
for the statement which has been made by
one of the witnesses about this matter, is from
the fact that Dr. Bowie kept some anotomical
specimens.
The Attorney-General.? Did you write a
letter to the defendant before the trial ?
The Chief Justice interposed, and asked
how that could be made evidence?
The Attorney-General said he proposed
to refer to the letter as evidence of malice on
the part of the defendant.
The Chief Justice said it could not be in-
troduced into the rebutting case. It ought to
have been made evidence in the first instance,
if it were to be produced at all.
The Attorney-General admitted that if the
defendant objected he could not put the letter
in evidence.
The Chief Justice? l will stop it; it is not
evidence. I know what it entails very well.
Mr. Wyatt here handed a letter to the wit-
ness, which the witness said was the letter he
referred to.
The Attorney-General was understood to
ask the defendant?s counsel if they objected to
the letter being put in evidence, and it was
understood that they did object.
The Chief Justice repeated that he would
not allow the letter to be put in evidence.
This concluded the evidence of Mr. O?Far-
rell, and the defendant?s counsel did not cross-
examine him.
Mr. Richard Henry Horne, examined by Mr.
Fellows. ?I have been acquainted with the
Yarra Bend Asylum about nine years, and
have often been there. I have stayed some-
times a day, and sometimes two or three days.
I was once there nearly a fortnight, when I
had a sore throat, and wished Dr. Bowie to
prescribe for me. I went over the various
wards. The beds appeared to be made up in
a very cleanly manner, just as is usual in
similar institutions and hospitals. I never
saw any dirt in any of the wards. I have seen
it outside, at an early hour in the morning,
but what I saw appeared to be exudations
from some place. I have seen various amuse-
ments provided for the patients. There was a
piano, which I have heard a patient playing
upon. It was played upon until it was broken
to pieces. There were also cricket, billiards,
and other amusements. There were dances,
concerts, and also theatrical amusements.
The amusements have been much increased
within the last three or four years. The
patients were treated with great kindness and
attention by the attendants. I frequently
went round with Dr. Bowie. The patients did
not appear alarmed at his appearance, but the
attendants did. I have occasionally seen a
bullock or calf s head about the grounds, or
some remains of meat used by the patients,
but not any human bones. I
present at meal times in 18 �4 and 1805. Ihe
food was spooned out by the attendants, and


put on plates. The majority of the patients
sat down to eat, but two or three had a fancy
to run away with their food, and eat it out-
side. I played with Dr. Carr at billiards
several times. He always appeared in a very
good state. I never saw him violent. I have
seen him dance in quadrilles and other dances,
and conduct himself very well. Robert Coates
was an ? alarming gardener.? (Laughter.)
Mrs. Bowie dared not go into the garden when
he was there. I have sometimes had a fancy
for a few strawberries, and have walked about,
but durst not take any in consequence of
Coates being there. I have heard him swear-
ing, but I did not see that he was swearing at
anybody.
Cross-examined by Mr. Wood - I last played
at billiards a few months ago. The cloth on
the table was cut, and the leather tips were
knocked off the cues. I do not think Dr.
Carr would cut the table, because he had been
accustomed to play at billiards before. Many
of the patients, however, had not played be-
fore. I have seen attendants playing at bil-
liards. They generally played with the
patients, and I observed the same thing at
cricket. The patients did the greater part of
the fielding at cricket. I never saw them bat-
ting. There were books at the institution. I
think there was a room set apart for reading,
but the patients would not stop there; and
they tore up the books which they got. If a
patient had a book given to him, I should say
he would tear it up. The attendants certainly
seemed alarmed, and tried to get out of Dr.
Bowie?s way when he approached. They had
a quieter, subdued, more deferential manner
when they saw Dr. Bowie than when he was
not there.
Mr. Wood ?Did they testify equal alarm
when you drew near ?
Witness.?No; certainly not.
Cross-examination continued. I was on
terms of considerable intimacy with Dr
Bowie. I saw the food given to the pa-
tients when first I went to the asylum
There was a long table for the patients to sit at to
take their food. There were a certain number
of patients sitting at a table in each ward
Latterly the wards were so crowded that
there would not be room for all the patients
to sit at the tables. In 1856 the patients had
only spoons. I think Dr. Bowie was afraid of
their jobbing each other?s eyes out if they had
knives and forks, I have since seen them with
knives and forks, and they did not gouge each
other?s eyes. The exudation I spoke of might
be excrement. There was a certain hour Ibr
cleaning the rooms, and I being up before
seven o?clock ?earlier than the hour for clean-
ing-saw the exudation. I suppose it had
not been cleaned up. I cannot say whether
it was removed every day, but when I have
gone round during the day it has not been
there. I have not seen Dr. Carr in a bag He
was quite quiet when I was there.
Thomas Greenwood, examined by Mr. Bil-
ling, deposed?l am a contractor, and was
working from the latter part of the year 1856
until 1860 at the Yarra Bend Asylum. I have
seen Dr. Bowie go round the institution.
When he went round, some of the patients
would shake hands with him, some would
cringe into a comer, and some were violent
perhaps. They manifested different appear
ances according to their different diseases, as
it appeared to me. I had a key of the
various wards, and had the opportunity
of seeing every part of the institution at
any time. I have always seen it very
clean indeed. I have observed at six or
eight o?clock in a morning some dirt made
by a patient in his room, but it was instantly
cleaned up. I have had all the rooms under
my repair, and can say that they were always
clean. _ I know Dr. Carr; I have seen him
very violent, and I have seen him very calm,
On one occasion I was going to the Public
Works Department, along with Dr. Bowie, but
in consequence of one of |the attendants run-
ning after us we went back, Carr was upon
one of the tables in one of the wards, and was
running about raving. One of the attendants
tried to take him off, and Dr. Carr took up
a pannikin, and struck the attendant
with it. That would be about March, 1858,
I have heard Dr. Carr holla-ing and swearing
on other occasions. He has complained that
Dr. Eades and Mr. Barker had hocussed him-
put something into his pipe; and he has made
complaints about being hocussed at the gaol
I never saw any human bones about the
grounds of the asylum. Dr. Bowie had an
eagle fastened in his own garden, and
there were a number of beast?s bones and
pieces of flesh about that part. These were
the remains of the eagle?s food. I have been
to several of the balls and concerts given for the
amusement of the patients. They were held
in a large room between the yard of the male
department and some of the female wards. I
have also seen the patients playing at billiards
on many occasions, and also at cricket. I
have seen a hundred of them playing at
cricket at a time ; and attendants were posted
in various parts of the field to prevent any of
the inmates escaping. There was a reading-
room, to which the patients had access. I
remember Robert Coates. I frequently saw
him at the asylum. He was a very violent,
hot-tempered man. On one occasion I was
erecting a fountain, and, as Coates was tasty
in doing little things about the garden, I ap-
plied to Dr. Bowie to allow Coates to assist me
in making a grotto round the fountain.
Coates was allowed to do so ; but he wanted
to take my position in the matter, and be
master. He abused my men, and I had to
apply to Dr. Bowie to get him removed.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie ?Coates did
not know what my plan was about the grotto.
He had not the slightest idea what my notion
was. He ought to have got to know it by
asking me what he was to do. I asked him
to put some rock-work at the bottom of the
fountain. He differed with the men I em-
ployed, and wanted to assume the direction. j
knew Coates was mad. (Laughter.) I should
not think every man I saw upon the premise*
was mad. If I had seen you there I should
not have thought you were mad. (Loud
laughter.) lam sure Coates was a very violent
tempered man. My work at the asylum la?
in the different yards, wards, and rooms. *
had no opportunity of knowing what went 0�
during the night. My time was from si*


o?clock in the morning to six at night. I was
there before Mr, Kauwerau. The sunk wall
which he spoke of was not in existence when
I was there. I have visited the asylum since
my contract was finished. I have gone to see
the balls, which are held monthly. I have
not seen any dirt or the attendants sleeping
during the day. I do not say that Mr. Kauwe-
rau may not have seen that. I never noticed
that the attendants were additionally atten-
tive on the approach of Dr. Bowie.
Adam Howie, examined by Mr. Billing,
said,?l am a night attendant at the Yarra
Bend Asylum, and have been so for nearly
four years and a half. During the first two
years I was in F ward, and since then I have
been at the cottages. I never knew a patient
die without some person being in attendance
upon him. I went to the asylum at the be-
ginning of 1858. I thought it was kept re-
markably clean. I have never seen any hu-
man bones lying about the grounds, nor pieces
of human flesh hanging on the trees. I have
seen the food distributed to the patients. It
was put on plates, in as nearly equal quantities
as possible. After the food was placed in each
plate, the plates were put on the table in the
mess-room, and the patients were called in
and sat at the table. I was frequently up
during the day and saw this. I also saw the
clothes and beds of the patients. They were
kept very clean. That remark applies more
particularly to the ward in which I was en-
gaged. Sometimes the patients got supplied
with fruit and vegetables from Dr. Bowie?s
private garden, and sometimes they were sup-
plied with medical comforts from Dr. Bowie?s
house ?such as milk, wine, bacon, and other
things, which were not in store at the time.
I thought Coates was a strange kind of man.
I remember a patient called Baker. He was a
man of cleanly habits, but he had broken his
legs. An attendant always sat by him to keep
him clean. I never saw him in a state of filth.
I remember a patient called Anderson dying
of dysentery. I was with him about the time
he died. I cannot say I ever saw Coates ex-
hibit any violence. I administered the medi-
cines at night. I got them from the head at-
tendant, Mr. Young. I received them in wine
bottles and regular medicine bottles. The
bottles were quite clean, and so were the ves-
sels in which I administered them A patient
named Potter died of consumption in H ward
?ti 1858. I do not remember the month. I
attended him, and supplied him with medical
comforts at night. I attended that ward one
Week, and another attendant attended it an-
other week. We attended it alternately. I
was present at Anderson?s death, and gave
bim wine and medicine, and what he required
during the night. He made no complaint of
Dot getting anything he required. The pa-
rents had cards to play with, and had also
books to read, and football, skittles, bagatelle,
draughts, and other amusements. I attended
about 120 patients in F ward. There would
be, perhaps, four or five day attendants, and
oue night attendant. It would be impossible
ter any patient to call out at night without
toy knowing of it. I went round every half-
hour, and looked specially into the rooms
where there were epileptic patients, or any
cases requiring attention. The patients might
call out for a little time, but not for any
length of time, and I always attended to any
call.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ? I do not
remember seeing Dr. Whittenbury. I knew
McDonald. He was in F ward when he com-
mitted the first murder. He was not confined
day and night in any cell in F ward. I can-
not speak as to what was done with him in
any other ward. In F ward he was treated
like the other patients. He was there a few
months. I think he was there when I went
in January, 1858. He was afterwards removed
to the refractory ward. I was a juror on three
or four coroners? juries held at the asylum
after I went. I was an attendant during that
time. The juries consisted of twelve persons.
Probably they would be all attendants.
Mr. Michie. ? A little congress of day and
night attendants ?
Witness.?They were mostly day atten-
dants. I may have been a juror on three or
four inquests. I was not on five or six juries.
We were called to attend on the juries by the
steward of the establishment. He was sent
round to get the attendants to come and sit
on the jury. The person who had charge of
the patient who died was never put on the
jury. The attendants varied according to the
number of patients. I think there would be
upwards of twenty in 1858. I cannot say
exactly how many there were. There was one
day attendant for every eleven patients, and I
think there were three or four night atten-
dants. I think there are four night atten-
dants now, and an outside watchman. When
I said I was with Anderson about the time he
died, I meant I was with him at the time he
died. I called a day attendant, who saw
Anderson shortly after he died. The medi-
cines were sometimes in wine bottles. I could
not say they were never in old tom bottles. I
never saw medicine in one of the square
bottles.
Re-examined by Mr. Billing.? For several
years past the coroners' juries have consisted
of strangers, and upon the occasions I have
spoken of, when attendants were upon the
juries, strangers would have been summoned
if they could have been procured.
Alexander Grant,examined by Mr. Fellows.
I was cook at the Yarra Bend Asylum from
May, 1856, to the 12th October, 1868. During
that time the food was cut up in the kitchen
small enough for the patients to eat it with a
spoon. It was then taken up to the wards in
a tin dish, and was afterwatds served by the
attendants to the patients. Coates used to re-
ceive his food in the kitchen with me. He
was indulged by Dr. Bowie as he was a very
peculiar man; and as he complained he could
not eat the usual food, he was allowed stewed
mutton, or anything that might be promiscu-
ously going to Dr. Bowie?s house. Coates was
a very peculiar man. I could never under-
stand him. I never saw him violent on any
one occasion. I recollect Wainwright being
at the asylum. I remember having conversa-
tions with him after he left the asylum. On
one occasion, I met him in Collingwood, and
he asked me how things were getting on over
the way, meaning at tne asylum ; and I said,


? Tolerably well.? He then said that he had
been the means of rooting up or ripping out
an institution of that kind at home, and he
intimated that he would do the same here.
He also stated that Dr. Bowie was more fit to
become an inmate of the institution than
to have the management of it. (Laughter.)
By the Chief Justice.?This conversation
took place about three years ago.
This witness was not cross-examined.
William Trumble, examined by Mr. Billing,
said. ?I am a dav attendant at the Yarra
Bend Asylum. I went on the 18th November,
1868, and have been there ever since. I have
only assisted to place one patient in a bag.
His name was David David. The patient,was
in a padded cell, and a blanket was put round
him before he was placed in the bag. I never
saw a padlock used on any of these bags. I
don?t remember seeing any other patient put
in a bag. I was removed to H ward?a con-
valescent ward?and I was there for eleven
months, and I was then removed to the cot-
tages. The asylum always appeared to be
kept very clean. I very seldom left my own
ward. I speak principally of my own
ward. I have administered medicines to the
patients. I generally received them at the
surgery. I received them in bottles, which
had always corks in them, labels on them,
and directions on the labels. I cannot re-
member the directions which were on the
labels. The attendants at the cottages were
sometimes day attendants, and sometimes
night attendants, I have seen the patients
play at billiards almost every day. I have
also seen them play at cricket, and other
amusements. The attendants always ap-
peared to be very civil, attentive, and kind to
the patients.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?I know
Andrew Young. He was an attendant while
I was an attendant. I never remember seeing
any patient but David David in a bag. I
was in a convalescent ward a great part of the
time. There may have been patients put into
bags in other wards which I knew nothing
about. Young may have put patients into
bags. The padded room was fitted up some
time in 1858 or 1859. It was fitted up for
David David?s occasion, and remained so for
any other occasion. He was in the bag in the
padded room. He was put into the bag to
keep him warm. He would not keep his
clothes on. I and two other attendants as-
sisted to put him into the bag. He did not
sahe would be cold. I knew he would be
cold. (Laughter.) He used to stand naked in
a cell until he was put in a bag. (Laughter.)
Mr. Michie. ?Did he used to stand regu-
larly ?
Witness.?No; not regularly.
Mr. Michie.? l want to see if these bags
were his regular suit. (Laughter.) Was he in
the habit of standing naked ?
Witness. ?I do not remember his doing so
more than two or three times.
Mr. Michie?lf it was not his habit, he re-
quired to be kept warm with a bag ?
Witness. ?Yes. He was not in the bag
during the day.
Mr. Michie.? But always, I believe, during
the night.
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?For how long ?
Witness. ?I can?t remember. He might be
in the bag three or four nights. ?
Mr. Michie.? Then his cold fit passed away
after three or four nights ? (Laughter.)
Witness?l cannot remember that he was
in the bag more than three or four nights.
The Chief Justice.?How did the other at-
tendants come to be there ?
Witness.?l went for them to come and put
the patient in the bag.
The Chief Justice.? Was it necessary to
have three attendants to put him into the
bag ? Did he resist ?
Witness.?lt was very difficult to put him
in.
The Chief Justice. ?Where was this?
Witness. ?In the padded cell.
The Chief Justice.? Was he standing: or
what?
Witness. ?He was standing in the cell.
The Chief Justice? Why was he in the
padded cell ?
Witness. ?To keep him from knocking him-
self about.
The Chief Justice.? Before you attempted
to put him into the bag was he violent
towards you or towards the other attendants?
Witness.?He was a very dirty patient.
The Chief Justice.? What answer is that
to give to my question, sir? I ask you if he
was violent, and you tell me he was dirty!
Witness. ?I don?t remember his being vio-
lent.
George Knott, examined by Mr. Fellows,
said, ?I was a day-attendant at the Yarra
Bend Asylum. I went in March, 1868, and
left in December of the same year. I was there
again as private attendant from October, 1860,
till March, 1861. I went to attend upon one
gentleman. I knew Coates. Dr. Carr was in
the asylum the second time I was there. I
was sometimes ordered by Dr. Bowie to go
with Coates to Mr. Cole?s garden to buy seed,
On one occasion, when we were crossing the
river by the boat, Coates wished to take the
boat across himself, and I would not allow
him. He threatened to tell Dr. Bowie because
I would not allow him to take the boat across.
When I was first at the asylum my ward was
B ward ?the refractory ward. I was in a cot-
tage on the second occasion. My duty in B
ward was to get the patients up, take them
out for a walk, and see them get their meals.
There were two patients?Reggs and Clancy?
in restraint when I was there. There were
about three dozen patients in the refractory
ward while I was there. I think no change
took place in the number of the patients
during that time. I only recollect two cases
of restraint. By restraint I mean strait-
jackets. There was another man who required
to have a jacket at night, because he would
not keep his bedclothes upon Mm. Those are
the only three cases I recollect. Dr. Bowie
always went round the refractory ward twice
a day, and I have known him go oftener some-
times. I was a day attendant all the time. If
the night attendant required any assistance,
he summoned a day attendant. I was never
summoned. On one occasion I went for Dr.
Bowie to visit a sick patient, at six o?clock in


the morning, and the doctor sat with him two
hours?up to the time of his death. When
there was no sago or arrowroot in store, I went
to Dr. Bowie?s house and got some.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. The
medical comforts were distributed by the at-
tendants.
This was the last witness examined before
the rising of the Court.
The Attorney-General intimated that he
would look over the remainder of the list of
witnesses for the plaintiff, and make a selec-
tion of them.
The Chief Justice asked if the examination
of the plaintiff?s witnesses would be concluded
on the following day ?
The Attorney-General thought it would
be concluded early on Wednesday.
The Court then adjourned, at five minutes
past four o?clock, until Tuesday morning, at
ten.
SIXTH DAY.
The following additional evidence was ad-
duced this day, on the jiart of the plaintiff; ?
Edmund Jones, examined by Mr. Fellows.
?I am an attendant at the Yarra Bend
Asylum. I went there in August, 1856. I
know Dr. Carr. I recollect his being put
under restraint. I saw him strike Shearer, an
attendant, with a pannikin, I don?t recollect
the date. Dr. Carr was in B ward, and asked
Shearer for a drink of water. Shearer went
for the water and gave it to Dr. Carr, when
Dr. Carr lifted the pannikin and struck
Shearer in the face. Shearer went away and
came back with Dr. Bowie; and Carr was
put into a jacket ?one with sleeves. He was
then left walking about. This was in 1868.
Carr was in restraint once before, for striking
lue with a small phial in the eye. I was bad
for nearly a week in consequence. I believe
Shearer is now in America. Carr was kept
for about five or six days in the jacket. The
jacket had sleeves, and Carr?s hands were
fastened in front. Carr was in the ward that
I had charge of in 1857. I have seen Carr in
a bag at night. The bags are used for keep-
ing warm those patients who knock them-
selves about. I recollect Dr. M?Crea com-
plaining of Ford?s ear not being attended to.
The day before, I saw Dr. Callan lance the ear.
I believe Dr. Bowie was confined to his bed
at the time. I recollect a patient named
Quin. One evening, when I was passing in
with the patients? tea, Quin took up an axe,
which was lying at the door, and struck at
nie, cutting my ear and lip, and laying open
my leg. I was laid up three months in con-
sequence. I saw the barricading of Dr. Carr?s
door on one occasion. I was in the ward at
the time. Several of the attendants (includ-
ing Morgan Irwin) were there. Dr. Carr had
a broom in his hand, and swore he would
knock down the first man who went in. The
door was forced, and the attendants went in
and secured him. I don?t recollect Dr. Carr
emptying the contents of a vessel over their
beads. He was put under restraint, but he
was not put on the ground as I saw. I had
to serve out medicines and medical comforts.
They were always given me labelled. I have
seen a padlock on the sleeves of a jacket
which fastened in front of a patient, but in
no other place.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?The pa-
tients had axes sometimes, to cut down trees,
and also to cut wood in the paddock. I
should suppose there were somewhere about
thirty male attendants. I believe there were
about four night attendants. The labours of
the attendants seemed to have been divided
into watches?day watches and night watches.
I don?t know why there were so few atten-
dants at night as compared with the number
in the day. # '
Samuel Conway, examined by Mr. Billing.
?I am a day attendant. I have been there
since the first of January last. I remember a
patient named Edward Fitzgerald. He died
from dysentery. I had charge of him from
the 6th to the 22nd of March. I saw him the
night previous to his death. I found him
dead between six and half-past six o?clock in
the morning. He was perfectly warm. I felt his
pulse. I sent for Dr. Callan at once. He came,
and pronounced him dead. The night before
I had cleaned Fitzgerald. I always kept him
clean. He was a little dirty when I found
him. I saw him at ten o?clock at night
when I gave him in charge to the night watch-
man. I never put Fitzgerald into a bag. I
never had him under any restraint, except
gloves. The gloves were put on because he
was most destructive. He would destroy all
his clothes and leave himself naked at night.
Dr. Bowie accompanied by the dispenser, saw,
him between eight and nine o?clock on the
night previous to his death. I never observed
any marks round his wrist. I observed no
marks of injury when we received him.
I recollect aperson named Hugman.
He was in the adjoining ward. He could
not have had any opportunity of seeing
how Fitzgerald was treated. I have never
seen a jacket padlocked at the shoulder-blade.
I have never seen a padlock at the asylum at
all . ,
By the Chief Justice? l was in the asylum
for nearly two months before the Ist of
January, as a supernumerary.
By Mr. Billing?l have not seen any
restraint at all while I have been at the asylum.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.?l was taken
on as a supernumerary at my own request. I
had not been a patient.
Mr. Michie?Do you feel a natural call to
that sort of employment ?
Witness.?l was out of employment, and
took a walk out to Yarra Bend to see if they
wanted a supernumerary. Dr. Bowie took me
on as a ? super.,? and afterwards put me on
the staff.
Mr. Michie.? l understand you to say that
you never saw any restraint ?
Witness?l have seen patients in the night-
dress?the bag. That? was a regular dress.
The patients were put into the bag for com-
fort s sake. I believe Fitzgerald was put into
the bag, but I never saw him. I received
charge of him on the 6th March, and had
charge of him until the 22nd March. I re-
ceived him from Johnson, who was then
removed from S ward to one of the cottages.


Fitzgerald had been under Johnson?s care for
some time previously. The night watchman,
John Fitzgerald, told me that he saw Fitz-
gerald alive at half-past five in the morning.
The patient Fitzgerald was given into the
night watchman?s charge at ten o?clock the
night previous, when I went to bed. The day
attendants are supposed to be up at six o?clock
in the morning in summer, and at seven
o?clock in winter. I got up soon after six
o?clock on the morning Fitzgerald died. It
was the duty of the night watchman to visit
him as often as possible. The watchman
would take from three-quarters of an hour to
an hour in going his rounds. There are four
night attendants at the cottages, but, if a
patient is dangerously ill, they generally visit
him oftener than they would otherwise do.
Goold, an attendant, cleaned Fitzgerald the
morning he died. Unless the night watch-
man was present, there was no one with Fitz-
gerald at the time of his death
Re-examined by Mr. Billing. The at-
tendants act under printed regulations.
That is one [produced]. I received it from
the office and had it hung up in my ward.
The Rev, William Wood, Church of England
clergyman, examined by Mr. Fellows.? l
have been in the habit of visiting the asylum
for the last seven years. When I went there I
have generally gone all over the establishment.
I have hadsufficientopportunitiesduringthese
visits to see the mode in which the buildings
and the bedding were kept as to cleanliness.
I he condition varied according to the charac-
ter of the inmates. For example, I found the
wards appropriated to idiots more disagree-
able than others. A smell always pervaded
that ward. The others I have always found
in a state of great cleanliness. I have seen
stains, but nothing solid, on the walls. The
floors were particularly clean. The ventila-
tion is now much better than it was in 1855
and 1856. Indeed there has been a progres-
siye improvement from year to year. I don?t
think the idiotic ward was as well ventilated as
the others. My first visit was on account of my
being written to from the country by the
brother of a patient who asked me to go and
visit her, and let him know what state I thought
she was in. I visitedher, and communicated the
result of my visit. I have visited patients on
two other occasions. When I have gone
round with Dr. Bowie, I have lingered behind
and said a few words to the patients, so that
they had opportunity to speak to me if they
had any complaint to make. I have received
only insane complaints?accusations of poison-
ing, confidential communications as to how
many Dr. Bowie had poisoned in the course of
last week, and such like. I have seen the
jackets, but not the bags. I suppose I have
been to the asylum three times within the
last twelve months. I have generally gone
about mid-day. I have not been there when
the patients have been having their meals ?
but I have seen the food prepared, and I have
tasted it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Wood.?l had never
been in an asylum before I went to the Yarra
Bend. I went there prepared to find some-
thing very horrible, but I did not find any-
thing very horrible. I have seen the patients
play at cricket.
Mr. Wood.?Have you seen any num her of
patients amuse themselves, either at billiards
or in any other way ?
Witness.?Not at billiards, certainly. J
have been in the reading-room. I think there
were not many patients there?
Mr. Wood?Do you think the asylum is
very crowded ?
Witness. ?I cannot say with regard to the
new buildings, but that has been my impres-
sion with regard to the asylum.
Mr. Wood?Have you?not given different
evidence elsewhere ?
Witness.?That refers to my recent visits,
The asylum was overcrowded formerly, and I
qualified what I said by speaking of these
new buildings. At the present time, the esta-
blishment is not overcrowded, judging by the
beds.
Mr. Wood?When the patients are out, is
there sufficient protection for them from the
heat of the sun ?
Witness.?There was not the last time 1
was there, but I understand it has been altered
since then
Mr. Wood, ?Did you ever use this expression
The day yards are revolting to one?s
ideas ?
Witness.?Certainly; and I do think so.
Mr. Wood.? Have they a supply of water
from the Yan Yean there ?
Witness.?l believe so; but I cannot tell
whether there is much use made of it.
Mr. Wood?The last time you were there,
had they availed themselves of it with respect
to sanitary arrangements ?
Witness?Considering what has been done
at Pentridge Stockade, I think they might
have done a great deal more.
Mr. Fellows. ?In what respect were these
yards revolting ?
Witness.?There is a desolate look about
them. They are surrounded by high build-
ings. The poor creatures lie along one side of
the Avail? one in one place, and one in another
?looking (though I don?t like to use the ex-
pression) like wild animals in a den.
William Goode, examined by Mr, Billing.?
I am an attendant at the Yarra Bend Asylum,
and have been so employed since the 12th
September, 1861. I know a patient named
Fitzgerald. I was in attendance upon him at
different times. I was in the adjoining ward.
I saw him the night before his death : he was
then perfectly clean. I saw him dead in the
morning. He was clean then, with the excep-
tion of what he had purged, apparently in the
death struggle. I washed and cleansed the
body. No one assisted me. I have always
seen the institution clean. Whenever the
patients were found dirty, their clothes were
changed. The patients? food is properly
divided. There is a plate for each patient,
and the patients sit on a form at a table. The
food is perfectly clean and good.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ? I did not
know the place before the 12th September,
1861. At the time of Fitzgerald?s death I was
a day attendant in the adjoining ward. Con-
way asked me to come and clean Fitzgerald
while he went to Dr. Bowie and reported the


patient's death for the inquest. Conway was ?
away an hour, or perhaps more. It would J
take him perhaps five minutes to go down to
Dr. Bowie's, and five minutes to come back, t
The inquest took place about twelve or one
o?clock. I was not examined. I was not there y
at all. I know there was an inquest, because J
I saw the jury pass and repass, and because I
read the account of the inquest in the news- 1
paper afterwards.
Mr. Billing. ?The Argus t
Mr. Michie.?You get the news of what ;
happened at Yarra Bend from Collins street? .
I call that candid. Then they know more in
Collins-street of what is going on at the Bend
than you do ?
Witness?l don?t know. Perhaps they
know more. (Laughter.) I never saw any
dirt about the place at all, without its being
removed as soon as it was taken notice of.
The dirty clothes were always removed as
soon as discovered, and afterwards either
washed or sent to the laundry.
John Fitzgerald, examined by Mr. Fel-
lows?l have been an attendant at the Yarra
Bend Asylum since the Ist January last. I
was night attendant on the occasion of Ed-
ward Fitzgerald?s death. I went on duty at
ten o?clock at night, and relieved Conway in
S ward. Conway directed me to pay particu-
lar attention to Fitzgerald. I went and saw
him at once. He was very weak. His clothes
seemed very clean. I visited him about every
half-hour. I also visited another man whom
I had to attend to down stairs every half-
hour. During the night I found Fitzgerald?s
bed and sheets soiled. I put a clean mattress
under him, and gave him clean sheets. I left
him about half-past five o?clock. He was then
alive and clean. I know Carr. I remember a
disturbance between him and an attendant
named Tarraway. That was in 1858?when
I was in the asylum before. I was there then
for eight or nine months. Carr bit Tarra-
way?s finger. Tarraway went into Carr?s cell
and put" a jacket on him. Carr was lying
abed, and kicked and spat at us. I was on my
knees, trying to get him into the jacket, and
I heard Tarraway cry out, ? Let my finger
go.?
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.?Carr was
lying on the bed. He resisted us, and would
not get up. . ?
Mr. Michie. ?Why not let him he there ?
Witness. ?Because we had orders to put on
the jacket. ?
Mr. Michie. ?But for those orders you saw
no reason why he should not lie there on his
back as long as he was disposed to do so ?
Witness?l would not have put it on with-
out orders.
Mr. Michie. ?But there was no reason, in-
dependent of the orders, against letting him
lie on his back ?
Witness.?l did no more than follow my
instructions. ?
Mr. Michie.?Who first went up to Carr ?
Witness?l can?t say whether it was Tarra-
way or myself. I think we both entered the
cell together, for I would not go in by myself.
Mr. Michie.?What was the first thing you
did to him ?
Witness.?As well as I remember, either
Tarraway or I said, ?We want to put the
jacket on you,? and he resisted.
Mr. Michie. ?Did he say, I don t want
the jfteket
Witness.?l believe he said something to
that effect; but we said, ?You must be
i acketed.
Mr. Michie.?He was still disinclined to
have the jacket. .
Witness.?He was very violent.
Mr. Michie,?And then you began to pull
him about ? ? ,
Witness?We got him by the collar, and
lifted him up, and put him in the jacket. I
don?t think it was a padlocked jacket It
was laced up. When the jacket was on, Carr
was still violent. Dr. Bowie was sick at this
time. I think Tarraway got the orders. Dr.
Callan was not in the asylum at the time.
Mr. Michie,? Then you were simply ordered
to go and bag Carr, and away you went and
bagged him ? _ . T
Witness?lt was stated to Dr. Bowie, I sup-
pose, that Carr was violent.
The Chief Justice.?He knows nothing of
Dr. Bowie and the order.
Cross-examination continued.?-Dr. Carr nas
thrown his food at me. We could not make
him wait and be hungry. We must give the
patients their food at the proper hours, no
matter how violent they are. I have seen
Dr. Carr once in the bag.
By the Jury?l never called up Dr. Bowie
during the night. I have called up the other
doctor frequently since the Ist January last.
I did not call up any one to assist me in plac-
' ins Fitzgerald into clean sheets. I did not
call up Dr. Callan. There was no occasion,
as there was no change in Fitzgerald from
the time I went on duty at night until the
morning. . ?, nr
Thomas Tarraway, examined by Mr. Bil-
ling.?l am a day attendant at the Yarra
Bend Asylum. I went there in 1858. I know
Dr. Carr. I remember going with the last
witness (Fitzgerald) to Carr?s ward. I had
seen Carr two or three hours before, when he
was very violent. He struck an attendant
named Shearer across the face. I received
instructions from Dr. Bowie to put him in a
jacket. Carr was at the time lying on his bed
in the cell. We had to put the jacket on him.
He resisted. I never saw any of the jackets with
a padlock on the shoulder-blade. When the
jacket was placed on the patient, he had no
freedom for his hands. His hands were placed
across the breast. The institution has been
very clean ?as far as the appliances would go
?as long as I have been there. The patients
had their food at a table, round which they
sat. The food was equally divided among
the patients. The food was good and clean
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. I was there
when Dr. Pugh visited the asylum. I assisted
in putting out the food in the way he has
described. I never tfas in the ward where
Dr Pugh went. I was in the building.
Mr. Michie. ?Since 1858, when you first
went there, I suppose things have been gra-
dually improving ?
Witness?l have seen them as good in
1852
By the Chief Justice.? l was there in


1852, and remained, perhaps, seven or eight
months.
By Mr. Michie. ? I should say things were
better in 1852 than they are now. There was
a larger quantity of food distributed, there
was a smaller number of patients, and the
thing was more under command,
Mr. Michie. ?Then lately it has not been
thoroughly under command '?
Witness. ?There is a great deal to do at pre-
sent. The buildings are now scattered over a
mile of ground.
Mr. Michie. ?A little more lounging could
be had in 1862 than of late years ?
Witness. ?No ; I never saw any lounging
at all. I don?t know when the Highbury
Barn Tavern was built. I know the house,
and that is all. I don?t believe I was ever in
the house in my life. I am not in the habit
of frequenting such places. There was more
food for the patients in 1852 than there is
now.
Mr. Michie. ?Then there is not sufficient
now ?
Witness. ?There is sufficient.
Mr. Michie. ?Then there must have been
more than sufficient then. I suppose the
patients could then have been smothered
under food. The poultry might have looked
livelier that year. How many poultry might
you have observed ?
Witness. ?I have not paid attention. I will
swear there were not 500.
Mr. Michie. ?Will you swear there were not
400?
Witness.?l never counted them. (Laughter.)
We had to take Carr up and put on the jacket.
We lifted him up very gently, just as you
would lift a baby.
Mr. Michie. ?And Carr was so grateful for
this tenderness as to abuse you ?
Witness. ?He nearly bit my finger off.
Re-examined by Mr. Billing. ?The patients
have increased from seventy-two in 1852, to
700 and odd. There were only four wards in
1852.
William Bellow, examined by Mr. Fellows.
?I am a day attendant at the asylum. I
went there in 1858. I have been accustomed
to use the bags, and have seen patients sleep
in them. When I went to the asylum, I was
particularly interested in the bag, and the
putting of it on. There was in my charge a
patient named Griffiths, who was very destruc-
tive and violent. We used to give him at
night two blankets, a rug, two sheets, a bed,
and a pillow, and in the morning we found
everything destroyed. This man would also
get up from his ? net-making??as he called
the destroying of his clothes?and commence
hammering at the door in the middle of the
night. I have informed Dr. Bowie of this,
and he has said, ? The best thing you can do
is to ? bag? him ; put him in the night-dress.?
This man could only get sleep when put into
the bag. If asked on a morning, after he
was put in the bag, how he got on, he would
say Stunning?all rightbut the moment
he was free he would again commence his
clothes-tearing. Old things had to be pro-
vided to amuse him. Then there was another
patient named Spencer, a Tarrengower pub-
lican, who had a perpetual motion with his
t fingers, and whose whole body was on thi an
move from morning till night. I have beet yo
i up to patients at night, and I have seei 1
i Spencer at that time in this continual motion no
i He was for tearing all his things to shreds, ne
; but whether he had anything to tear or not| ]
he always kept up this motion with his arms yo
i and fingers. The only way to give the man 1
sleep was to put him in a bag. I remember ]
? another patient named Collins. He was a Bo
? stout man, and had a large corporation. He 1
was a butcher from Geelong. (Laughter.) The kii
reason he was put in the bag was that he was ]
constantly patting his stomach, creating sucl yo
a noise at night as to keep the other patient! 1
awake. (Laughter.) So far as I observed, the tin
bag treatment was not uncomfortable. A ]
blanket was always put inside. * m
Cross-examined by Mr. Wood.? l don?t say atl
that Spencer was moving his arms for twenty- pa
four hours without cessation. I don?t say that eai
he did move them when sleeping, I have wa
been in no other asylum than the Yarra Bend, ap
Mr. Wood. ?Don?t you think it possible, by rer
sewing stout canvas to the blanket, to prevent gai
a patient picking a blanket to pieces ? At
. Witness. ?He would pull the canvas or cold tal
side to him. Moreover, the blanket could not na
be sewed to the canvas so as not to be picked Hr
away. c i (
Mr. Wood. ?Would it not be easy to have Hi
bars of iron round the bed ? w!
Witness. ?A man would be apt to knock his I
head against the bars. h a
Mr. Wood. ?lt could be lined with a mat- ati
tress, or something of that sort, so that a man ne
could not hurt his head. an
Witness.?Such a thing might be ; but we pa
had no convenience in the asylum for do- ati
ing it. M,
Mr, Wood. ?You have seen children put at
into beds of that kind ?
Witness.?Yes; but I think putting men ha
into them is a very different case altogether. as
The Chief Justice. The bags were ca
handier. ? j a(
Mr. Wood. ?Could you not have put muf- or
tiers on the hands ? I
Witness.?Yes; but then he would have pc
had continual motion with his hands. re
Mr. Wood.? But he could not have picked ni
the blanket. ; n
Witness. ?It would have answered in that
respect; but he would not have had rest. te
Mr. Wood.? Do you mean to say he would
not have got tired and gone to �leep ? in
Witness. ?I don t mean to say he would a
not; but I mean to say that when put into a F
bag he could sleep more composedly. N
Mr. Wood, ?We are told that one of the hi
regulations of the asylum is, that no attendant tt
shall be allowed to marry.
Witness?l believe so. tl
Mr. Wood, ?What is done when attendants tl
marry ? a ]
Witness. ?Either one or the, other has to T
leave. _ I cannot say I am ? a particular Ji
favourite of Dr. Bowie. I am married to
Elizabeth Powell who was examined last
week, since December last. Dr. Bowie never w
knew we were married. Our resignation is E
sent in. d
Mr. Wood.?Does not Dr. Bowie know it,


thi and has he not made a special exception in
beei your favour?

A Peter James Avezel, examined by Mr. Bil-
UNG ?I went to the Yarra Bend Asylum as
say attendant in November, 1858. I remember a
ity- patient named Ford. I was present when his
hat ear was lanced. After the ear w r as lanced it
ave was poulticed. I assisted Andrew Young in
nd. applying the poultices The poultices were
by removed and others were put on when neces-
ent sary. I remember Dr. M'Crea seeing Ford.
At the time he saw Ford, Ford had himself
old taken off the poultices. I remember a patient
not named Antonio Vicari. He was very violent,
ted He endeavoured to escape, he destroyed his
clothes, and he was very dirty in his person,
we He had very bad legs, which were dressed
whenever necessary, and he was kept clean,
his I recollect a patient named Germain. He
had a blister on his head, which blister was
at- attended to as often as was necessary. I
an never saw a patient lying in bed with filth
and maggots about him. I remember a
we patient named Monckton; he was properly
io- attended to, and kept clean. I remember
Mullens. I never saw him ill-treated by the
?ut attendants. He was very kindly treated.
Cross-examined _by Mr. Michie.? Things
en have improved since I have been in the
asylum. It is a safe place for people who
:re can?t control themselves. There are bags and
jackets. I have frequently used them, under
if- orders. When I considered a necessity arose,
I went to Dr. Bowie or Dr. Callan, and re-
ve ported what had happened. I have frequently
reported such a case in the course of the
3(1 night. I have got up Dr. Bowie many times
in the middle of the night,
at By the Chief Justice.?l was a day at-
tendant.
Id By Mr. Michie.? But I was up many times
in the night. I had troublesome people, and
Id a troublesome ward to attend to. Mine was
a F ward, which was always nice and clean.
Nobody ever found 1,000 bugs in F ward. I
ic have seen bugs, but it is now too cold for
it them.
Mr. Michie.? Yes; they have retired into
their winter quarters ?into the recesses of
is the bluestone. I suppose you expect to see
all of them in the course of a few months ?
o They will be in full force about December or
>r January?
� Witness.?l am sure of it. (Laughter.)
it Re-examined by Mr. Billing.? Before I
r 'vent to the asylum I was in the Melbourne
s Hospital for nearly two years, as day atten-
dant. I was also at the Geelong Hospital for
ii one year. I have seen handcuffs like those
produced [leather handcuffs produced] used
in the hospital in fever cases.
Mary Anne Curie, examined by Mr. Fel-
lows. ?My husband was a patient in the
Yarra Bend Asylum. He went there in_lBsB,
and remained until he died, in 1861. I visited
the asylum while he was there always once a
week, and sometimes twice a week. I never
saw anything but cleanliness in the asylum.
The place where my husband was in was
always clean and wholesome. I never saw
any ill-treatment, and I never heard him
complain of any.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie, ?When I
visited the asylum I did not go round the
establishment. I went only to that part
where my husband was. He was first in D
ward, and was afterwards removed to one of
the cottages.
Re-examined by Mr. Fellows?l was asked
to come here. I think it nothing but right
that all should speak as they found.
Elizabeth Chambers, examined by Mr. Bil-
ling.?l had a son in the Yarra Bend Asylum.
He died there about three years ago. I was in
the habit of going to see him from January
to June ?the time he was there; ?three or four
times a week. His age was I al-
ways found him perfectly clean, and his food
was very nice. I have tasted his sago; it was
very nice?fit for a baby. My son was para-
lysed ; he could not speak. I have come here
voluntarily.
The witness was not cross-examined.
Hermann Ketsch, examined by Mr. Fel-
lows. ? I am an attendant at the asylum. I
went there first in December, 1860. I knew
Patrick Mullens; he was under my charge
from the 27th September?which was shortly
after his admittance ?until the 17th of No-
vember, the day of his death. I had to see
him dress and get up in the morning. I saw
his body every morning. I saw on it marks
of former sores and boils. There was no
gathering, and I did not notice any bruises.
I observed traces of a black eye. He was well
able to dress and undress himself, and he al-
ways washed himself during the first portion
of the time he was with me. About a month
before he died he fell sick, and became more
idiotic and From that time I
washed and dressed him. He never com-
plained that it hurt him to dress him. For
the last three weeks of his life he did not get
up. I changed his bed frequently, and he was
able, with assistance, to get up while his bed
was changed. I never saw him ill-treated in
any way.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.? From the
time he came in until he was handed over to
me he was in Andrew Young?s care. I paid
every attention to him. During the last three
weeks of the seven weeks that he was with
me he was very restless. He exhibited his
restlessness in tearing his clothes into strips,
and continually walking about. He never
was noisy. I never observed any marks of
injury about him. There was an inquest upon
him. I was examined at the inquest, and
gave there the same account that I have
given now.
Mr. Michie? But how do you account for


the two abscesses on the thigh, and the three
broken ribs on the left side ?
. Witness.?l can?t account for the broken
ribs at all, because I never knew they were
broken until after the man?s death. The ab-
scesses on the body came through the dysen-
tery. I saw the body after death.
Mr. Michie. ?Did you see Mullens naked
four days before his death?
Witness. ?Every day, and -several times
during the day, because I had to clean him.
Mr. Michie. ?Did his body then present the
same appearances that you saw immediately
after death ?
Witness.?The same?with the exception
that some of the sores which he had were,
perhaps, more dry before his death. Some of
the other sores came out anew. He never
complained of any pain.
By the Chief Justice.?Mullens slept on
two mattresses, on the ground, for about three
weeks before his death?from the time he be-
gan to be restless.
William Armstrong Mowbray, examined by
Mr. Billing.?l have been an attendant at
the asylum ever since January, 1861. I know
Dr. Carr. I have never seen him treated with
seventy- quite the reverse. He has received
treatment beyond any other patient in the
asylum. The attendants have taken him
mto their room, and he has dined with them
and taken their food instead of that allowed
to the patients. I have known him to "et
porter, and other things allowed him bv the
doctors. I have seen him in a jacket? put there
for violence. I cannot state the time' exactly

a bag for preventing a patient getting his

Re-examined by Mr. Billing.?l don?t know
that a bag was put on in the daytime to pre-
vent the patients taking off a blister. I have
never seen a bag used except to prevent i
patient pulling a blister off his head.
Morgan Irwin, examined by Mr. Fellows,
said ?I am an attendant at the Yarra Bend
Asylum, and have been since April, 1866. I
was a day attendant in B ward. Dr. Carr was
in that ward. A patient named Lang was in
B ward at the same time. I remember one
morning that a fight took place between Dr,
Carr and myself. I recollect the circumstance
to which Dr. Carr alluded, but I don?t think
it occurred on a Sunday morning. Dr. Can
was accustomed to have a shower bath, but he
was later than usual in having his bath that
morning. I went into his cell, and Dr. Carr
immediately took up a chamber utensil, and
threw the contents in my face. He then took
the utensil, and said, ? I will kill you; ? and
he struck me with it, knocked me down, and
struck me again several times with it. I then
seized him. laid him on the bed, and went out
of the pell as soon as I could. I went to him
again in a few minutes to get the utensil
from him, and he struck me once or twice
with it, and cut my eye, but did not seriously
hurt me that time. Dr. Bowie was present on
the second occasion. In consequence of this
conduct Dr. Carr was ordered to be put under
restraint. He was put in a jacket. I did not
kick Dr. Carr. The door of his cell was not
barricaded that day. I had always been in
the habit of going into his room before he had
his bath. The shower-bath was erected at the
bottom of the yard. Dr. Carr had the bath at
his own request. I recollect an instance in
which the door of Dr. Carr?s room was barri-
caded. Dr. Carr did not empty the contents
of the utensil upon me on that occasion. The
occasion on which the door was barricaded
was some months before that. On the occa-
sion of the barricading, Dr. Carr had struck a
man named Shearer with a broom-handle.
Dr. Carr also put his bed against the door,
and we were obliged to forcibly push the door
open. When we got into the room, we took
the broom from him, and on that occasion he
was also placed under restraint. There were
three attendants present on the occasion of
the barricading. I did not lay Dr. Carr on
the floor that time, but I did on the other
occasion. Ido not recollect entering into
compact witli Dr. Carr after either of those
occasions. He afterwards said he was sorry
for what he had done, and hoped that he
would not do it again I said I hoped he
would not; but I knew he was mad, and did
not know what he was doing at the time.
The restraint used for Dr. Carr was a canvas
jacket. Ido not recollect who took the jacket
off. I remember Dr. Carr being taken to a pas-
sage behind the cells. That was on the occa-
sion of the barricading. I do not recollect
which attendant took him there. Dr. Carr
never said that if I used violence again, he
would make another attack. He always said
he would kill some of us. On one occasion,
when he had an attack of delirium, he said he
would kill me, but he would wait for his own
convenience. I never said to Dr. Carr that I
was married, and I did not want to kill him-
contradicted the remainder of Dr.
Carr?s evidence on this point.] I always treated
him kindly. During his sane hours he was


it t always very civil. I brought Dr. Carr here to
give evidence. He was in xny charge. Before
>ws, we left the asylum in the morning, I asked
end if he would not put on his own clothes ?
I meaning the clothes in which he was accus-
was tomed to attend the balls at the asylum. He
i in replied that ?As they had thought proper to
one send him a writ to come here, he would see
Dr, them to the dqyil first before he came in
nee any other clothes.? Since he was examined
ink here, Dr. Carr had been very bad?very much
lan excited. I knew a patient called M?Don aid.
the Ido not know Dr. Whittenbury. I remember
hat that McDonald was in B ward. I do not re-
pair collect any occasion on which any person
md came to see any man in particular. Ido not
iok remember Dr. Bowie saying that a person
md wanted to see the case. I remember several
md persons coming round. I never saw four men
xen rush into McDonald's cell when it was opened,
out and seize him. I never knew M'Donald or
dm any other patient, seized and thrown to the
isil ground by three or four attendants, except in
Ice the case of a very big and violent patient,
isly called Splint. Ido not know anything about
on the first murder M?Donald committed. He
his was then in F ward. One day, after he was
der removed to my ward, he was walking up and
not down the yard, and, during my absence for a
not few moments, to get some tobacco for some of
.in the patients, he took up a log of wood, and
lad knocked one of patients named Grinning,
the down with it by a blow on the back of the head,
at nearly severing the head from the body. He also
in struck another patient, but that man warded
rri- the blow off his head with his arm. He was,
nts however, rendered senseless, and remained so
he for three hours and a-half. M'Donald then
led went up to another man, but I prevented him
ca- from injuring that man, and took the piece of
t a wood from him. He then became quiet. The
lie. piece of wood had been taken out of the fence,
or, It was a kind of prop, and was fixed in the
ior ground before M'Donald pulled it up. He was a
ok very strong man, about five feet eleven inches
he high, and built in proportion. The bags are used
ere for two or three purposes?for the purpose of
of putting them on patients when they are ex-
on ceedingly noisy; to prevent them knocking
ler pots against the walls, and disturbing the
ito other inmates; and to prevent them taking
>se theirclothesoff andgettingcold. Whenabagis
ry put on, a blanket is always put inside it, and
he wrapped round the patient. I have seen Dr.
he Carr in a jacket. He has been placed in
[id uiany positions in the jacket. I have seen
ie. him, on one occasion, with one arm behind
?as him. I have also seen him with one hand
:et fastened to his side, and also with both hands
is- in front. Dr. Carr has often requested that
;a- the position of the jacket should be changed.
;ct I have never seen him in it with his hands
irr fastened up to the shoulder-blades,
he By the Chief Justice.? l have seen both
id hands : fastened round the back when the
in, patient had the jacket on.
he Mr. Fellows.? ln what case would that
m be ?
;I Witness.?That would depend upon the
n. state of violence in which the patient was in.
)r. If he was more violent than usual, the hands
d Were put behind, and they were altered when
as he became less violent. Dr. Bowie said that
if the patients wished a change they were to
have it. He did not say why. The jackets or
bags were not tight round the neck so as to
be painful. I never saw Dr, Carr use turpen-
tine or tow to extirpate bugs. I recollect him
setting fire to his bed and bedding. That was
in the adjoining ward to mine. Ido not re-
collect the date of this occurrence. I ran out
of my ward, and saw what had happened, and I
was nearly suffocated with smoke. I recollect
Lang. A man named Cowley, I think, was
the night attendant when Lang was there, I
recollect going to Dr. Bowie, in consequence ot
Dr. Carr making a complaint that Lang had
been badly treated, I requested Dr. Bowie to
come and examine the patient, and he did so.
He found there were no such marks on his
person as Dr. Carr has described. I was pre-
sent at the time. I was one of the two at-
tendants who had charge of this ward. I
used to take the patients their meals. At one
time the bread for tea was cut up and weighed
in the store for the patients, and we then took
it up to the patients along with a pannikin of
tea. It was placed upon the tables, and the
patients sat down to eat it. If a man was ill,
we took the food into his cell to him, but we
did not throw it in as if we were throwing a
bone to a dog. Our practise was quite the
reverse. It was quite the reverse with respect
to Dr. Carr. I have seen bugs about. I might
see one or two lice on the patients from time
to time. Some of the patients breed lice, and
require looking after, _ There are _ very few
such institutions in which you won?t find two
or three lice on some of the patients. I have
seen one or two lice, from time to time. After
Dr. Carr was examined in Court, I examined
the most dirty looking patients in the asylum,
and I could not see even one louse upon them.
I never saw the bags tight round the neck ot
the patient. I could always put my hand
down between the bag and the patient s neck.
I remember a Frenchman called Hebert. He
was under my charge about three months, at the
commencement of 1857,1 think. He was under
my charge the whole of the time he was in
the asylum, except two or three days. He
was put into one of the bags. He would be
in the bag six or seven weeks altogether, con-
tinuously. That was in consequence of his
destructive habits, pulling his clothes off,
and making a fearful noise in his cell, so as
to prevent the other patients sleeping. I think
Hebert was in the sack during the first six
or seven weeks "of the three months. After
the bag was removed he was tolerably quiet.
I think the bags were put on him from the
commencement of the time he was in the
asylum. He was in a canvas jacket in the
day time. Sometimes a jacket with sleeves
was used, and sometimes one of the other
kind. The jacket was used because he was a
very dangerous man. He once tried to set
fire to the place. He also took his clothes oft,
and tore them, and it would have required
one person to watch him constantly. I re-
ported the disposition of the man to Dr.
Bowie. I reported that he was very danger-
ous and destructive, and that it would require
one man to watch him, if he were not placed
in restraint. Dr. Bowie came round and saw
him, and ordered him to be put in a jacket


He was kept in restraint six or seven hours in
the day. During the remainder of the day he
was locked in his cell, He only had the
jacket on when he was out for exercise.
When the jacket with the sleeves was used
the patient s arms were put behind him.
There were also three padlocks on the jacket.
[A jacket was here handed to the witness
who described the manner in which it was
put on the patient and padlocked. The
jacket, as has been previously stated, has a
row of eyelet-holes behind, wnich are laced
after the jacket is put on. The witness stated
that a padlock was placed on the top eyelet-
hole, and one about the middle. The third
padlock was placed lower down the arms of
the patient being put behind his back and
the padlock being placed through an eyelet-
hole in the cuff of each sleeve of the jacket
and then fastened through one of the eyelet-
holes at the back.] The sleeves of the jacket
[contimied the witness] would be ten or
twelve inches longer than the man?s arm. I
recollect Herbert s death, which occurred
while he was under my charge. I believed he
died of diarrhoea. It was my duty to take
his clothes off each morning. He was a very
dirty patient. I do not know whether the
bag he was put in was changed during the
night. I was not a night attendant. Herbert
was ill about three weeks before he died. He
did not wear a bag during that time. The
jacket without sleeves has been used five
years in the asylum. I think it has been used
ever since I went there. I have seen bags
and jackets of different sizes. I have seen
bags as large as those now produced,
but I have seen them a good deal smaller. I have
seen them smaller in every way. We re-
quired large bags if they were for a large
man, and small ones if they were for a smaller
man. On one occasion Macdonald attacked
me. He was talking in his cell one day, and
I went in to ask him if he wanted anything;
he immediately jumped over and closed the
door. One of my arms was in a sling, and
my head was in a poultice. He took ad-
vantage of these circumstances, and would
have killed me if another attendant had not
come to my assistance. I was three weeks
in bed from the effects of the injuries I re-
ceived from Dr. Carr, and I was fourteen
days in bed from the injuries McDonald in-
flicted upon me.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?I first
went to the asylum as an attendant in April,
1856, and have been there ever since. I have
always been in the same capacity. I had no
authority over the other patients. I was
examined before a Parliamentary committee
as to the state of the establishment generally.
I remember saying that there was now no
restraint in the establishment. That is cor-
rect. There was no restraint at that time in
the whole establishment. I alluded to re-
straint during the day.
Mr. Michie said that the words which the
witness used when before the committee, in
February, 1858, were?? There is no restraint
throughout the establishment now,? i
Witness. ?I meant to speak as to the day-
time when I said that. I did not intend to i
deceive the committee. I did not say that we (
i used restraint during the night, I did not
; know it Was used during the night at that
j time,
. Mr. Michie.?Then why should you have
I intended to limit your remark to during the
. daytime ?
Witness.?lt was my impression that re-
, straint was not used during the day, but I
i could not swear. By restraint I mean a man
s placed in a canvas jacket. ? I had not many
i opportunities of knowing whether restraint
I was used in the other wards during the night,
1 I don?t recollect having any conversation on
the subject with the other attendants. I
could not say how long restraint during the
? day had been abandoned before February,
1858. I think it must have been some months
before, but I could not speak positively. I
will not swear that a man had not been ?in a
bag during the day three weeks before the
11th of February, 1858. 1 would not swear a
man had not been in restraint the day before,
I only spoke as to my opinion. McDonald
was in my ward in 1859. Ido not know Dr.
Whittenbury ._ Ido not remember any in-
stance in which M'Donald was set upon by
four attendants, in the presence of any visitor,
1 swear positively it did not occur while I was
the attendant ?not to my knowledge. If I
took a part in the matter, I could not have
forgotten it. It might occur in my absence?
if I had gone to town, on leave. I know an
instance in which it required four or five
men to remove a patient from one ward to
another. I have taken part in that operation,
That has been in a case where the patient has
been very dirty. It occurred at different
periods of the day?nine o?clock in the morn-
ing, or four or five in the afternoon.
Mr. Richie.? When do you consider a cell
is sufficiently dirty to change a patient.
Witness. ?I always had a man changed in
my ward before he was very filthy. If Mr,
Whittenbury said that the straw in M'Donald's
cell was very filthy, that must be incorrect. I
have not changed a patient from one bag to
another during the night. It was the busi-
ness of the night attendant to do that. Calls
of nature have sometimes taken place in the
bag. I don?t think any canvas is impervious
to wet. I don?t think No. 1 is. Ido not
think a man who was several hours in a bag
would be in a state of complete perspiration,
He would be much more comfortable when he
was taken out of it than if he had been with-
out it. I remember one occasion on which
two men ?Melbourne and Hughes?were pad-
locked together in bags. Ido not know how
long they were fastened together. They were
not under my charge. I have seen two or
three lice. That would be about the number.
I could not say whether there were more than
three or not.
Mr. Michie. ?When did you take your last
census ? (Laughter.)
Witness.?l last made a count two or three
mornings ago. I counted none then. (Laugh-
ter.)
Mr. Michie.?How did you set to work to
count them? (Renewed laughter.)
Witness.?l did not count any. I examined
the heads of about fifteen or twenty men. I
did not examine them with a small-tootb


dot comb. It is a very good plan to examine them
| iat with a small-tooth comb. I think I have
only been on two coroners? juries at the asy-
lve lum. lam sure 1 have only sat on two juries.
th e I cannot remember upon whose bodies the in-
quests were held on those occasions.
re . Alexander Kennedy Smithj examined by
11 Mr. Billing, said ?I am a civil and practical
ian engineer. I have been connected with the
,nv Devon County Lunatic Asylum, in England,
int I had charge of the buildings, as engineer,
Id and was there from 1848 to 1851. In the
on exercise of those duties, I had access to every
I part of the building at all times. Restraint
the was used at that asylum. These jackets were
xy made of strong ticking, not canvas, and the
ths patient?s hands were fastened behind, at the
I side, or in front, as the case might be. Another
x a means of restraint was to put trousers on
-he the patients and fasten them with straps.
r a There was also a padded room, which was
ire , strongly padded with horsehair. The restraint
was always used under the direction of the
D r , medical superintendent or his assistant. I
i n ! have been to the Yarra Bend Asylum since
hy 1854. Considering the appliances, it was Con-
or, ducted as well as the Devon Asylum, as far as
raj the sanitary arrangements went, but as to the
f i treatment of the patients I cannot speak. The
,ve Devon Asylum had all the modern appliances,
L_ but the Yarra Bend Asylum had not. At the
an Devon Asylum the quiet patients had knives
ve and forks, but the knives were of a peculiar
to description. [The witness gave a description
)n , of the knives, from which it appeared that the
, a j blades were partially blunted, with a view to
D t Prevent the patients cutting each other with
- n . them.] The first time I visited the Yarra
Bend Asylum I had some conversation with
e U Dr, Bowie about these peculiar knives used at
the Devon Asylum. I believe that conversa-
jn tion took place in October, 1864. I inspected
j r the various wards of the Yarra Bend Asylum.
j>j I found some things objectionable, which
1 were being remedied. About other things Dr.
to Bowie said he had sent in requisitions to the
s j. Government, and he expressed regret that he
[] g could not obtain them as quickly as he re-
\xe luired. Dr. Bowie asked me to get some of
Q9 the knives used at the Devon Asylum, and I
0 t to England for some. I informed Dr.
jo Bowie of their arrival, and he requested me to
n , fix a price for them. I did so, but they were
he refused in consequence of their being above
|j. the ordinary price. I do not know who re-
;jj fosed them. The price was about 14d. each.
(I- I think the price was very cheap. The price
w of an ordinary knife of the kind is lOd. or Is.
?e The Attorney-General hoped that his
jj Honour would take a note of this.
r. The Chief Justice said it was not evidence,
,n and if the defendant?s counsel had objected he
Would have opposed it.
gt , The Attorney-General said that Dr.
M'Crea had given evidence about some knives
te Procured by Dr. Bowie.
x- The Chief Justice remarked, that he did
not take Dr. M'Crea?s statements about that
0 matter, as they were not evidence.
The Attorney-General.?The jury heard
d what Dr. M'Crea said.
1 The Chief Justice replied that the jury
b might hear this, but he should tell them that
it did not contain a particle of evidence. It
seemed to be just a waste of the public time.
Mr. Billing (to the witness). ?Were amuse-
ments provided at the Devon Asylum ?
The Chief Justice.?Nor do I think that is
evidence.
Mr. Billing remarked that questions had
been asked on the other side about amuse-
ments at the Yarra Bend Asylum.
The Chief Justice remarked that there was
no traverse nor issue as to whether amuse-
ments were provided at the Yarra Bend Asy-
lum. The complaint was, that the amusements
were used by the attendants, and not by the
patients.
Mr. Billing said that the first thing would
be to see what amusements there were.
The Chief Justice. ?I dont think it is.
Mr. Billing said that he was about to ask
the question as to the attendants.
Examination continued.?There were va-
rious amusements in the Devon County
Asylum. The attendants joined with the
patients in their amusements. The superin-
tendent of that asylum had a small farm near
the institution.
The Chief Justice. ?What has that to do
with the matter ?
Mr. Billing remarked that it was to show
that at the Devon Asylum a patient was em-
ployed to work in the superintendent?s farm
or garden at that institution, as Coates had
been employed to work in Dr. Bowie?s private
garden.
The Chief Justice remarked that if it were
proved that a patient in one asylum had been
employed for the private purposes of the super-
intendent, instead of for the purposes of the
asylum generally, and that there were certain
peculations or perquisites?whatever name
they might be called by?that would not
render such a proceeding at another institu-
tion either justifiable or censurable.
Mr. Billing.?That is a question for the
jury.
The Chief Justice?Any other person
doing right or wrong won?t affect it.
Mr. Billing.?l wish to show a similar in-
stance.
The Chief Justice repeated that whatever
another person might have done would not in
any way affect the question at issue.
Mr. Billing intimated that he would put
the questions to the witness which he had in-
tended to do, unless his Honour stopped them.
The Chief Justice said that Mr. Billing
might put the questions, but he would not
take the answers down, as they were not evi-
dence.
Mr. Billing then sat down, without putting
any further questions to the witness.
This witness was not cross-examined.
George Wood, examined by Mr. Fellows,
said?l first visited the Yarra Bend Asylum
in November, 1860. I had a son there at the
time, and I went to see him once or twice
'every three weeks from November, 1860, to
March in this year. I never saw anything at
the asylum but as it ought to be. The insti-
tution was in a most cleanly state. I heard
no complaints in the institution. My son
had previously been in the Western Gaol. He
had been there from the 27th October to the


16th November. I never saw him in the gaol.
I saw him a few days after he was removed to
the asylum. He was in a most deplorable
state, and I despaired of his life. He was in
bed, and had had his head shaved. Ido not
think he knew me when I went. He remained
in the asylum about a year and a half, and I
had the opportunity of seeing how he was
treated. I saw his food given to him fre-
quently. I first saw him in F ward. I saw
the cloth laid, but I then left. Every atten-
tion, however, seemed to be paid to the in-
mates. My son was afterwards removed to
the cottages, where he remained a few weeks.
He was afterwards removed to H ward, and
I noticed each place he was in, and it appeared
clean. I often sat on his bed ; and I never
saw a bug in the asylum. I don?t say there
are no bugs there.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?I always
saw Dr. Bowie or Dr. Callan before I saw my
son, when I called at the asylum. I frequently
looked into the kitchen, to see the victuals.
My object was to see my son; but, to satisfy
myself, I liked to see other things.
Mr. Charles Jardine Don, examined by Mr.
Billing, said? l know the Yarra Bend Asy-
lum. I was engaged there in the winter of
1854, for three or four months, in the erection
of the first stone building and other work. I
have repeatedly visited the asylum since, and
made it my especial business to inspect the in-
stitution and see how the patients were
treated. They were treated with the utmost
kindness and civility by the attendants. Dr.
Bowie was always kind and attentive to the
patients. Dr. Bowie drew a plan of the cot-
tages, and I gave him an estimate of the pro-
bable cost. I have seen the patients indulg-
ing in various amusements. I have seen them
at the theatre, where there was comedy or
pantomime, and some of those things acted. I
have also seen them playing at bagatelle?
sometimes with the keepers and sometimes
amongst themselves. I have examined the in-
stitution carefully, and I always found it
very clean. Every place was so clean that
I could have lain down and slept in it my-
self.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.?l inspected
the asylum after I became a member of the
Parliamentary committee appointed to inquire
into the state of the institution. That would
be about the beginning of last session?the
end of 1860 or beginning of 1861. I visited the
asylum once a week on an average. I gene-
rally went by myself, but I have gone with
other members of the committee. I went by
myself during the period over which the com-
mittee?s inquiries extended., Dr. Bowie knew
the inquiry was going on. I wanted to see if
what the witnesses said about the asylum was
true. All I can speak of is as to what I saw
during the time tbe committee was making
inquiries as to the condition of the institu-
tion. I never noticed any particular smells.
In the yards where the closets were I have
noticed a smell, but I thought it was impossi-
ble to avoid it. I have not noticed a smell of
urine in any of the wards. I examined all
the wards, particularly that in which the re-
fractory patients were kept. I cannot men-
tion the wards by their distinctive letters. I
never saw any vermin. I did not see bugs in
the bluestone, nor in the wood. There are
plenty of holes in the bluestone, into which
bugs might creep. I never saw a bug in blue-
stone. (Laughter.) I never saw a bug at the
Yarra Bend Asylum in my life.
Mr. Michie. ?You never scuttled a bug out
of bluestone ? (Laughter.)
Witness. ?No.
Mr. Michie. ?And, I dare say, never will do,
Re-examined by Mr. Billing?l cannot say
whether a committee was inquiring into the
state of the asylum in 1854.
Mr. Edward John Wilson, examined by Mr,
Fellows. ? I am a legal practitioner at Rich-
mond. I have seen lunatics ever since I com-
menced the study of my profession. I have
seen them at Scarborough Workhouse, and at
St. Luke?s Asylum, London. St Luke?s
Asylum was under the management of my
particular friend, Dr. Hardwick. That would
be about fourteen years ago, when Charles
Dickens used to give an account of the balls
held there. I saw the treatment of the
lunatics. The modes of restraint at St. Luke?s
Asylum were the padded room and the jacket,
which I have seen here. At St. Luke?s I did
not see the bag, which seems to be an improve-
ment on the former appliances.
Mr. Fellows. ?What is it an improvement
upon?
Witness.?l don?t think it is an improve-
ment upon any particular appliance. It is an
original one in itself. (Laughter.) I did not
visit the wards at St. Luke?s Asylum at
night. A person who is mad on two or three
subjects may appear to reason correctly enough
on other subjects, but you could never trust
him. You never could believe him capable of
telling the truth.
The Chief Justice. ? I only want to know
your medical opinion as to whether a person
can be insane on some subjects, and sane upon
others. Can a patient suffering under mono-
mania upon one or two subjects, be sane upon
other subjects?
Witness.? Yes, of course he can. Perhaps
you will state me the circumstances.
The Chief Justice. ? I can only ask your
medical opinion as to whether a person may be
insane upon some subjects, and sane upon
others. The question as to the credibility, or
incredibility, of a person who is insane upon
some subjects is a question for the jury. One
is the province of the jury; the other is the
province of the witness.
Mr. Fellows. ?Is Dr. Burgess an authority
on insanity?
Witness.?Yes.
Mr. Fellows read the following extract
from Dr. Burgess?s work, entitled Relations of
Madness :?? Nor should tbe idea of partial
insanity be received or entertained, for where
th re is monomania there is total madness, or,
at any rate, madness should be considered to
be the rule. Where hallucinations and illu-
sions exist, the patient convinced of their
truth, acts upon their suggestions, which, on
restored health, seem to have been a dream or
a suspension of personal identity.?
Witness.?Yes; that is the point I wish to
come to. If you ask me if a man can do an


5 t which is sane while he is suffering from
lonomania, I say, of course he can.
The Chief Justice. ?I don?t understand
Examination continued. ?I am not aware
that any one advocates the total abolition of
mechanical restraint. There are circum-
stances in which a person might do himself
an injury, and it would be necessary to put
him in restraint. It might be necessary also,
if he was guilty of some secret habits, or if he
was violent. Patients have begged to be put in
restraint, as a merciful act towards themselves.
I once applied restraint to a patient who
nearly murdered me. In another case, a pa-
tient whom a dozen men could not restrain
was perfectly passive in my hands. There is
no ?universal pill ? in the treatment of lu-
nacy. I have had lunatics under my care in
private practice. During the time I had one
gentleman under my care, I came in contact
with Dr. Conolly. I have been to Hanwell
Asylum. Notwithstanding what Dr. Con-
olly says, I have seen canvas-bags used there.
These were laced round with straps. Insanity
is a primary desease frequently, and also a
secondary one. The irregular distribution of
blood is one of the causes of insanity.
The Chief Justice appealed to the Attor-
ney-General as to whether it was necessary to
go into the question as to whether insanity
was a primary or a secondary disease.
The Attorney-General intimated that in
his address to the jury he wished to refer to
different treatises on insanity. If he could do
that without proving the treatises his object
would be answered.
The Chief Justice. ?You may adopt any
theories you like in your address, but that is
not to say that the jury will take them for
evidence.
I The Attorney-General here took up the
examination of the witness, and, after reading
an extract from Dr. Burgess?s work, asked,
What is the physiological account ?according
to the received authorities ?as to the origin
of madness?
Witness.?That is one of the most difficult
questions to answer.
The Attorney-General? l know it is, and
that is what I expect you to do. (Laughter.)
Have you read Burgess ?
Mr. Michie.? Let us have Wilson; never
mind Burgess. (Laughter.)
The Attorney-General. What is the
origin of madness ?
The witness gave an answer to the effect
that the origin of the development of madness
must be that the mind was defective.
The Chief Justice.? l don?t understand it.
The Attorney-General? l understand the
theory thoroughly, your Honour.
Witness.?The brain is the material organ
% which man is enabled to express the in-
tellectual thoughts which are attributed to
the mind.
The Attorney-General? Precisely so.
The Chief J ustice. ?Stop, stop.
The Chief Justice having written down the
last answer,
The Attorney-General next asked the
witness?Do you know what is called moral
Ihsanity ?
Witness. ?Yes.
The Attorney-General.? ls that caused
directly, or indirectly, by the disturbance to
which I have alluded ?
The Chief Justice. ?What is the disturb-
ance which has been alluded to?
The Attorney-General.? The disturbance
between the cerebral functions and the mental
functions, as laid down in the paragraph I
have read to the witness?
Witness. ?Yes.
The Attorney-General? lf so, insanity
is a secondary disease, not primary ?
The Chief Justice.? l don?t wish to put
you into the box, Mr. Attorney-General.
(Laughter.)
The Attorney-General? Do you regard a
particular phase of monomania as one of the
phenomena of madness ? _
Witness.- Of course it is.
The Attorney-General? And the un-
soundness of the mind is not limited to that
one phenomenon ?
Witness. ?No.
The Attorney-General? lt is an indica-
tion of general unsoundness ?
Witness.?lt is the special symptom.
The Attorney-General? Of a general dis-
ease of the mental functions ?
Witness. ?Yes.
The Attorney-General? Do you know
what are called emotional or passionable
symptoms connected with insanity?
Witness. ?Yes.
The Attorney-General.? They frequently
exist in connexion with sanity of the mind ?
Mr. Michib.?l object to your reading pas-
sages for Dr. Wilson to stand in the box and
say?l assent to all that. (Laughter).
The Chief Justice.? Some of his answers
are opposed to his previous answers.
The Attorney-General. Very likely,
your Honour. (Laughter.) (To the witness.)
?These emotional symptoms frequently co-
exist with sanity ?
The Chief Justice. ?Emotional symptoms
of insanity?
The Attorney-General.? l do not say so,
your Honour.
Witness.?The mind has strong impressions,
and is capable of expressing them without
being insane.
The Attorney-General.? Then the true
way of ascertaining the insanity or sanity of
the mind would be by a process of diagnosis,
if you could resort to it ?
Witness. ?It would be.
The Attorney-General.? And have not
cases of insanity been ascertained in that way
by an examination of the vertebrae ?
Witness?l cannot speak to that.
The Attorney-Generral. ?Do you know
the difference between an illusion and a delu-
sion ?
The Chief Justice.? Before you go to that
point I want to know if you (turning to the
witness) consider that where monomania is
exhibited there is total insanity as a rule,
and that partial insanity is the exception ?
Witness.?l don?t understand that ques-
tion. . ~
The Chief Justice.? What is the meaning
of ? monomania ??


Witness. ?Simply that in all cases there
are prominent symptoms upon which you
form your diagnosis as to the state of the
general disorder'. Monomania is a prominent
symptom.
The Chief Justice?l asked you a few
minutes ago if a patient might not be labour-
ing under a delusion on one subject, or two or
three subjects, and be sane on all other sub-
jects. I understood you to say that that
might be the case. Were you correct in that
answer ?
Witness. ?I was not correct in that answer.
If you ask me whether a person having an
abscess of the liver can be perfectly healthy,
then I can understand the question. If you
ask whether a person who is a monomaniac
can be in a state of sound mental health, I
say, ? No,? as I also say in the other case.
The Chief Justice.?l did not ask you
that ?
Witness. ?That is the position in which I
am placed.
The Chief Justice.? No; you miss the
whole point. What I wish to know is whether
a man may be insane upon certain subjects,
and sane upon others ?
Witness. ?Pardon me ; I wish to illustrate
my view by a pathological illustration. If a
person has an abscess of the liver, and I am
asked if a disease of a certain organ can co-
exist with a general healthy condition of the
rest of the system, I should say, ?No and
if I am asked if a person can have a mono-
mania on one or two subjects and be to all
intents and purposes a sane man, I say, ?No.?
The Chief Justice.? lt would have been
much easier for you to have answered ? No?
to the question in the first instance.
The Attorney-General. ?Do you know
the pathological distinction between an illu-
sion and a delusion ?
Witness I understood one to refer to the
ideas and the other to the senses.
The Attorney-General?The other to ex-
ternal objects ?
Witness ?Yes.
The Attorney-General.?Supposing a
man is under a delusion, in what case may
it become a dangerous delusion, having re-
gard to the functions of the memory and the
will?
Witness. ?The case which occurred to me
is a case where a person fancied that, in
order to justify himself as a Christian, it
was necessary to prove his faith by beating
his attendants.
The Attorney-General.?l don?t want an
instance. I want a physiological illustration
to my theory. Having regard to two powers
?the will and the memory?will you explain
by which process a man?s delusion may be-
come to be a dangerous delusion ? (No
answer.)
The Attorney-General? You know the
function of the will ?
Witness. ?Yes.
The Attorney-General.? Can you tell me
what it is ?
Witness. ?I certainly cannot, from the way
you put it.
The Attorney-General? What place does
the will take amongst the mental powers ?
Witness.?lt is that which ? gives a person
determination to do certain acts.
The Attorney-General.? Exactly. It con-
trols his acts.
Examination continued. ?I attended Dr.
Bowie at the asylum when he was suffering
from carbuncles. He was laid up for some
weeks, and it was doubtful whether he would
recover or not. The asylum was under Mr.
Armstrong?s management at that time. At
Dr. Bowie?s request, I sometimes went round
the asylum with Mr. Armstrong, and with
Dr. Daniels, Dr. Bowie?s son-in-law. It is
usual for medical men to note their visits
in a memorandum-book. Dr. Bowie?s name
would occur in my book about that time.
The Attorney-General. ?ls it .necessary
to jot down the name of every patient visited
in the asylum ?
Witness. ?My usual course was to take the
name. In some cases, it would be impossible
to do more than take the name of a patient.
I have heard Mr. Rudall?s evidence with
regard to the fractured ribs of Patrick Mul-
lens. I do not concur with that evidence.
There are no data known to me as a pro-
fessional man sufficient to fix definitely the
period at which a fractured bone dies, or
the reparative process commences. I have
known cases in which it was impossible to
detect any alteration for nearly eighteen
months. It does not at all follow, as a matter
of necessity, that death of the bone must
take place within ten days after the fracture
unless the reparative process sets in.
This concluded Mr. Wilson?s examination
in chief.
Mr. Michie. ?What is a phenomenon?
Witness.?An infant phenomenon ?
Mr. Michie. ?We don?t want any facetious-
ness. You won?t get out of it that way. I
ask you, what do you mean by the term phe-
nomenon ?
Witness. ?I made use of the word to indi-
cate one of the
Mr. Michie. ?It has an etymological mean-
ing, has it not? (No answer.)
Mr. Michie. ?What is the meaning of it?
What is the meaning of it? What language
does it belong to, because it is not an English
word, I take it ? (No answer.)
Mr. Michie (after a pause).?What language
does it belong to ?
Witness. ?The English language, I presume.
(Laughter.)
Mr. Michie? You don?t give it as a speci-
men of good Saxon ?? the pure well of Eng
lish undefiled,? do you ?
Witness. ?No, no, I do not. (Laughter.)
Mr. Michie. ?What language is it derived
from ?
Witness (hesitatingly).?Well?
Mr. Michie. ?Do you know?
Witness.?l believe it is derived from the
Latin language. (Immense laughter.)
Mr. Michie. ?And I suppose monomania is
also from the Latin ?
Witness. ?No; that is from the Greek.
Mr. Michie. ?I won?t press you further as
to the meaning of phenomena. I suppose we
are still to take your answer that monomania
is one of the phenomena of madness ? (No
reply.)


[r. Michie. ?What do you understand by
term monomania ?
Witness?l understand where a person is
me, and the most prominent indication of
hows itself in relation to a particular idea
desire. .
Mr. Michie. ?Will you state that again, 11
m please ? (Laughter.)
Witness.?Where the individual, being ni-
ne, marks his insanity by a particular
ision. . �
r. Michie. ?What is the meaning of the
n?
Witness?The meaning of the term is, that
he is insane on one subject. That is the
ordinary meaning.
Mr. Michie. ?There is only one meaning.
Witness. ?Medical men differ.
Mr. Michie. ?I don't care about a medical
opinion ; I want a schoolboy?s opinion. (Sup-
posing you came to attend me, and said, ? You
have got a mojiomania, Mr. Michie; ? and I
said, ?Doctor, what is that? what does it mean??
nhat would your answer be ? (Laughter.)
Witness. I don?t know what answer I
should give until I knew the symptoms of
your case ?until I knew the particular delu-
sion under which you were labouring.
(Laughter.)
Mr. Michie.?Then my particular delusion
would be required in order to assist you to
explain the meaning of the term. Why, lam
indispensable in all parts of the world to
explain the term! (Great laughter.) Very
good; then I won?t press you further upon
that term. I will take you from etymology
and accidence to biography. Did you ever
read the life of Martin Luther ?
Witness.?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ? You have heard of John
Bunyan ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?Arc?you sure Luther was not a
Grecian ? (Laughter.)
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?And that John Bunyan was
an Englishman ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr, Michie. ?Have you heard of these indi-
viduals being under a delusion ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie.?What was Martin Luther?s
delusion ?
Witness (after considerable hesitation). ?It
does not occur to me at this moment. (Loud
laughter.)
Mr. Michie. ?Did you ever hear that he
ff as under the impression that he had seen
fte devil, and thrown his ink-bottle at him ?
i Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you think Martin Luther
w as a thorough madman ?
Witness. ?I think he was at that time.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you think he coiild have
discussed a question of theology with you.
(Laughter.) [No reply.]
Mr. Michie. ?Did you ever hear that Dr,
Jo hnson was under the impression that his
Mother had called him ?
Witness.?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?Now, where did that occur ?
Witness.? l don?t recollect. (Loud laughter.)
Mr. Michie.?lf Dr. Johnson was under the
impression that his mother had called him,
must he have been thoroughly mad at the
time ?
Witness. ?Well, that was a delusion of the
senses.
Mr. Michie. ?A delusion of what ?
Witness. ?The sense of hearing deceived
him.
Mr. Michie. ?Possibly his mother did not
call him. (Laughter.) Do you say it was a
mistake ?
Witness. ?It was the exaltation of his
natural senses. (Laughter.)
Mr. Michie. ?Oh, the ?exaltation!? Sup-
posing a man retained the impression that he
had thrown an inkstand at the devil, do you
say he was insane all his life ?
Witness. ?I should say that was an insane
delusion.
Mr. Michie. ?It is a monomania, you know?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?You say that man was tho-
roughly insane ?
Witness.?l say he was insane.
Mr. Michie. ?That he was insane all his
life, from the time that the delirium first
existed in his brain until he got rid of it ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?Have you read any of Martin
Luther?s works ?
Witness?Yes, I believe so.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you think he could write
coherently ?
Witness. ?Probably. Many men who have
been insane have written coherently.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you really mean to tell the
jury, Dr. Wilson, that in the successive efforts
of his high-intellect, Luther was insane ?
Witness.?Of course I don?t.
Mr, Michie. ?Then what do you mean by
saying he was insane ?
Witness.?lf you ask me if anything that
has a flaw in it is perfect, I say ? No.?
Mr. Michie.?You have said that a man
having a monomania was thoroughly insane.
Do you adhere to that ?
Witness. ?I do.
Mr. Michie.?What do you mean by tho-
roughly insane ?
Witness?l mean his mind is incomplete.
Mr. Michie. ?To what extent ?
Witness?To the extent of that particular
delusion.
Mr. Michie?Do you say he is incapable of
reasoning upon other things ?
Witness?l don?t say he is incapable of
reasoning upon other things.
Mr. Michie?Then what is the value of
your evidence here to-day ? You are not
here to give a metaphysical lecture, but to
speak about the degree of reliance which may
safely be placed in Dr. Carr?s evidence. Was
he coherent ? Did you sit and listen to him ?
Witness. ?I did.
Mr. Michie.?What does coherent mean ?
(Loud laughter.)
Witness.?To cohere together. To follow in
natural succession.
Mr, Michie.?Did Dr. Carr appear as natu-
ral and reasonable as any other man ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie?Then, when a man appears as
natural and reasonable in the narrative he


Elves as any other man, what is your test that
e is insane ?
Witness.?l must examine the ground upon
which that narrative is based.
_ Mr. Michib. ?If a man gives you a narra-
tive of acts done and suffered by himself, and
communicates it to you as another man would
do, what is your test as to his sanity ?
Witness. ?I have none.
Mr. Michie. ?In point of fact ?to come back
to the original point?a man may be under a
delusion with respect to one particular sub-
ject or object, and yet be apparently, as far as
human observation goes, quite sane, and, to
use your words, his statement may cohere on
all other subjects ?
Witness. ?It is generally recognised that
that may be so.
Cross-examination continued. ?Idon?t agree
with Mr. Rudallin his evidence about the frac-
ture of the ribs of Patrick Mullens. I don?t
think there are any data to determine at what
period after the fracture death of the bone
takes place, or the reparative process com-
mences. I heard Dr. Thomas?s evidence as to
various stages of that process. I was not pre-
sent at the inquest on the body of Mullens,
but I was immediately afterwards. I after-
wards saw one of the ribs. I consider the bag
used at the Yarra Bend Asylum an improve-
ment upon the former system. I think the
idea of a bag for keeping a patient from eat-
ing his own feces, and at the same time keep-
ing him warm, is the best contrivance I know.
Mr. Michie. ?Perhaps you will recommend
Dr. Bowie to take a patent out for it ?
(Laughter.)
Witness There are many worse things
patented than that.
Mr. Michie. ?ls it an improvement at all ?
What are the peculiar advantages of the bag?
The Chief Justice said he thought it was
unnecessary to ask the witness what were the
particular improvements connected with the
bag, for, in the first place, he had not named
that which the bag was an improvement
upon.
Mr. Michie did not press the question fur-
ther.
Re-examined by Mr. Fellows.?l saw some
of the bones of Mullens after the inquest, but
I cannot form any opinion myself as to when
the fractures occurred.
The Chief Justice asked how many wit-
nesses had yet to be examined ?
Mr. Billing? Nine or ten.
? T.j C Chief Justice said he was sorry that
it did not appear likely the case would be got
through next day, as he had hoped.
The Court then adjourned, at a little after
four o clock, until ten on Wednesday morn-
ing.
SEVENTH DAY.
T. he following additional evidence was given
this day on the part of the plaintiff:?
Henry Wakeham, examined by Mr. Fel-
lows. I am a plumber. I have frequently
been over the Yarra Bend Asylum. My wife
has been an inmate there about eighteen
months. During that period I have been the
nearly every week. I have seen my wife evei
time I have gone there. The premises ha l
always appeared very clean. I have b�
there at meal times. The patients seem*
pretty well pleased. Some get different mei
to the others. My wife was an invalid, ar
had different meat to some of the other p
tients. I never observed filth about the plac
My wife seemed very well pleased, and gai
Dr. Bowie a good character. In fact, all tl
patients where she was seemed to speak wc
of him.
Cross-examined by Mr. Woon. ?I have seei
my wife have her food two or three times.
Mr. William Crooke, surgeon, examined b;
Mr. Fellows. ?l had to visit the Yarra Beni
Asylum pretty often in the early part of 1851
I was resident surgeon at the General Hospita
at Hobart Town for nearly four years. Whil
there I had the management and treatment o
the lunatics sent in from various parts of thi
colony, previous to their being sent to thi
New Norfolk Asylum. I had also the oppor
tunsty of visiting them there, and of observinj
their management and treatment. I havt
been in the Yarra Bend Asylum perhaps fivi
or six times. I went to the asylum in the firs!
instance to ascertain how the establishmenl
was managed, with a view to placing there a
friend (Mr. Munro), who had arrived from
England in a state of paralysis and insanity
He was placed at the asylum. I considered
the asylum, with the exception of the crowded
state of the apartments, a well-managed insti
tution?as well managed as the circumstance!
of the case would permit. My recollection oi
the floors and the bedding is, that they were
in a very satisfactory condition. I observed a
bagatelle-board in the room which my friend
requented. Skittles were also provided. If
believe there were some books.
Mr. Fellows.? From your knowledge of the
mode of treating lunatics, do you consider re-
straint can be dispensed with ?
Witness.?As a mode of treatment, it cannot
be dispensed with. There are certain cases
which cannot be managed without a certain
amount of restraint. I allude to the case of
patients likely to prove hurtful to themselves
and others. There are patients so dirty that
they cannot be kept clean unless they are re-
strained from fouling themselves. I believe,
at the same time, that the restraint can be so
mild as to be not at all distressing to the pa-
tient. I have examined the night-dress, or
bag, as it is called, usep at the Yarra Bend
Asylum. I think it is well calculated to afford
the patient a certain amount of comfort at
night?in certain states of lunacy?which could
not be obtained by any other means. I recol-
lect, on one occasion, visiting the asylum, and
seeing Dr. Carr there. This was, I think, ' n
March or April, 1867. I accompanied D r -
Bowie to the ward where Dr. Carr was con-
fine K Dr. Carr was brought out of a separate
room. He was secured in a strait-waistcoat
He presented to me the evidence of insanity-
I think Dr. Bowie told me that either that da}
or the day previous he had assaulted a wards-
man. A wardsman was shown me with 3
black eye. I consider Dr. Carr decidedly jD ,"
sane. He talked to me and to Dr. Bowie,


, Tf [remember Dr. Bowie distinctly saying that
n he hoped he should soon be justified in relax-
lv; i n g the punishment. I looked upon Carr at
, CT; (he time as a dangerous lunatic. After the
ied first visit, Dr. Bowie gave me permission to
eat stroll about as I liked. On one occasion I saw
nd the patients were taking their dinner. I re-
na. member a wretched-looking being lying
, ce under the verandah in the yard. He was in-
lVf oessantly repeating the first line of the Lord?s
the Prayer. An attendant was feeding him. I
rell observed the food at the time. It struck me
as very wholesome, very savoury, and well
;en dressed. My last visit, I suppose, was about
the middle of May, in 1857. I think the insti-
llT tution was far too crowded then. It was im-
,nd possible for the best superintendent, with the
is[ best intentions, to classify the patients as they
t a i should be classified. There were scarcely any
iile means of classification beyond dividing the
tof wards into male and female. I have seen the
the mode of separating the different classes in
the Tasmania. We did not keep the incurables
lor . and the idiotic in the establishment at all.
ing Hence the average cures in Tasmania were so
ive much higher than the cures recorded here.
[ v e The average of cures in Tasmania was over
irst seventy per cent. Here it was only thirty-nine
en t per cent. Of the modes of restraint in use at
e a Yarra Bend I found the ordinary strait-waist-
0m coat, with the endless sleeves, which has been
ity, in use for years. Then there is an improve-
re?d ment on that, with sleeves inside, so that you
led can fasten the hands where you like, according
sti- to circumstances. And then there is-the
ce j night-dress, or bag. I did not find at the
of asylum the manacles, or armlets, which used
ere to be employed in the olden days. I was in
d a court when Mr. Rudall was examined as to
; nd the state of Patrick Mullens. I observed what
If he stated as to the appearances which the ends
of the fractured bones presented after death,
the Ido not agree with his opinion. There was
re- nothing in his account of the post-mortem
appearances to determine that the fracture
not took place within ten or twelve days?the
,ses hme stated by him.
jin Mr. Fellows. ?Has an abscess a different
of effect on a broken bone to what it has on
mother bone ?
The Chief Justice. ?How does that apply?
Hr. Rudall never stated that the abscess
ve, caused necrosis.
so Mr Fellows (to witness).?Would necrosis
pa- occur with or without the abscess ?
or Witness?Not without the abscess, but even
; nd with the abscess it is not at all likely to occur,
jrd At all events, the absence of an opening to
at this abscess, to allow the atmospheric air to
uld cuter and decompose the matter, removes
sol- horn my mind any idea that such a change
,nd could be effected as to cause necrosis in that
in time.
Dr Mr. Fellows. ?What would be, in your
:>n- opinion, the shortest time in which it would
at< occur ?
>at Witness. ?It is impossible to define the
ty Period.
la)' Mr. Fellows.? Have you known instances
ds- �f an abscess existing without any of these
i n circumstances following ?
in- Witness.?The pus will remain in contact
md w ith the flesh or bone for an indefinite period
without producing destruction of the flesh or
necrosis of the bone. I have known an instance
of matter being in contact with the bone for
nine or ten months without death of the bone
taking place.
Mr. Fellows.? ls it possible for the union
of the bones to be prevented by constitutional
causes ?
Witness.?There are certain constitutional
causes which operate to prevent the union of
the bones. These are scrofula, scurvy, syphilis,
and cancer. Pregnancy will prevent it. In
all these cases the process of union may be
suspended for a very long time, without any
change taking place in the position of the
parts.
Mr. Michie. ? I think all this very super-
fluous, unless Mr. Crooke can state that he
heard anything from Mr. Rudall or Dr.
Thomas as to any one of these particular
conditions being in the patient. Who ever
heard of a pregnant man ? (Laughter.)
Mr. Fellows. ?Will anything that Mr.
Rudall stated enable you to form an opinion
as to the state of this man?s constitution ?
Witness. ?The man being a lunatic, the state
of his constitution would approximate closely
to the states I have mentioned. Lunacy, in
seventy-five per cent, of the eases, is a blood
disease, and would influence the formation of
the bone.
Mr. Fellows. ? In your opinion, would
scorbutic dysentery account for the occur-
rence ?
Witness. ?I think in any low state of the
system, the deposit of callus and the unity
of the bones might be suspended from the
period during which the man was in the
asylum.
Mr. Fellows. ?What time would it take
before the ends became smooth and united
together ?
Witness.?That is a very difficult point to
determine. It would depend upon the amount
of motion which the bones suffered, the posi-
tion of the fracture, and a variety of circum-
stances. It is possible that absorption of the
soft structures might be going on at the same
time, leaving the bony ends still sharp. An
abscess would indefinitely retard the union of
the bones; it would interfere with the deposit
of callus. Any abscess may exist for an indefi-
nite time without the patient suffering any
great inconvenience. An abscess will fre-
quently remain for months ?particularly in
the case of a lunatic?without any disturb-
ance being created by its presence.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.? The cases
of lunacy treated at the Hobart Town Hos-
pital were of a transitory character. A large
proportion of the patients were men who had
been convicts.
Mr. Michie. ?Not men whose bodies were
in a condition conducive to the preservation
of health ? They were frequently hard
drinkers ?
Witness.?A great many of them were. _
Mr. Michie. ?And if you had to deal with a
certain number of lunatics selected from one
class, you would rather, if you desired to get
a reputation for many cures, deal with
patients from another class than that ?
Witness.?l must admit it as a proposition,


certainly; but I have not found much dif-
ference in the result of treatment or manage-
ment.
Mr. Michik. ?Have you had many instances
of lunacy to treat among people of a higher
class in life, who regarded more particularly
the means of health ?
Witness. ?We had paid patients placed
under our treatment at the hospital?men of
respectable position in society. I have treated,
in the course of a practice of twenty-five years,
perhaps 100 such cases.
Mr. Michie. ?You have asked about the
continuance of an abscess and pus being un-
relieved. But where there is a secretion of
pus, you cut down into it. That is a canon
in surgery?
Witness.?As a rule it is. We allow the pus
to be absorbed whenever dangerous to cut
down to ; but whenever we can get rid of the
pus by cutting down, we do so.
_ Mr. Michie. ?As to the fracture, the ques-
tion is not as to what would, or what would
not, retard the union of the fracture, but as
to the process of attrition or smoothening of
the fractured bones. Supposing it stated that
the ribs were fractured some inch or two from
the sternum, and that the fractured ends of
the bones were jagged and rough?taking that
by itself, would you consider it an indication
of a recent fracture ?
Witness. ?Not necessarily.
Mr. Michie.?Why not necessarily ?
Witness.?For the reason I have stated
before, that the process of the deposit of callus
might be suspended so completely through
constitutional circumstances as to leave the
ends rough and broken as when originally
fractured.
_ Mr. Michie.?But if the patient, after his
ribs have been fractured, breathe for days,
must not the ribs, with each inhalation of at-
mospheric air, be thrown out ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?And do they not, by each ex-
halation, fall in ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?That being so, in the incessant
operation of breathing must not the ends of
the bones be against each other?
Witness. ?They may not?they may be
separated by a filament of flesh. They may
override each other.
Dr. William Mackay Turnbull, examined
by Mr. Billing. ? I am a duly qualified
medical practitioner. I have visited Yarra
Bend Asylum several times. My visits com-
menced in July, last year, and continued
until January, 1862. I went round the estab-
lishment occasionally. I went to the asylum
specially to see a private patient who was
there. Ho was first placed in one of the stone
wards, and afterwards removed to the cottages.
Dr. Bowie, on one occasion, directed my atten-
tion to a padded cell. The cell was lined with
calico, and between the wall and the calico
was straw stuffing. I thought it a very good
idea, which might be acted upon even in pri-
vate practice. I have never seen Dr. Carr at
the asylum, but I have seen him here exa-
mined as a witness.
Mr. Billing. ?What is your opinion as to
his state of mind ?
Witness. ?That he is a maniac?not a
monomaniac.
Mr. Billing. ?You have had opportunities
of knowing the system of restraint used in
the treatment of lunatics in different places!
Witness?No. My experience is confined to
the hospital, of which I was one of the hono-
rary physicians. Occasionally, after confine-
ment, women become mad, and before we can
send them to Dr. Bowie we have to strap them
down. ?Strapping down? is a harsh term,
but a patient has a much better chance of re-
covery by being so fastened by the ankle or
wrist than if she is allowed to struggle with
three or four attendants. [Buckle strap pro-
duced.] I have said often to a patient??lf
you will not keep quiet we will strap you
down again.? And this alone has had the
effect of keeping patients quiet.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie.? l brought
the strap produced from the Melbourne
Lying-in-Hospital. It is a copy of the one we
got from the General Hospital. It is used
during paroxysms arising from puerperal
fever.
Mr. Michie? That, although it looks alarm-
ing to the uninitiated, is not so formidable a
type of insanity as others?
Witness. ?I beg your pardon.
Mr. Michie. ?It is uniformly recognised as
curable ?
Witness.?As a general rule, all diseases are
considered more or less curable. I consider
Dr. Carr a maniac. I heard him give the first
part of his evidence.
Mr. Michie.? Supposing you had heard
nothing about the Yarra Bend; supposing yon
had not seen Dr. Carr in that dress; supposing
the question had not been his insanity at all
?would you have said that you considered
him a maniac?
. Witness ?There was very great circumstan-
tiality about his story.
Mr. Michie. ?You would not have said, at
that moment ?? That man is insane? ?
Witness. ?No; I would not. Maniacs have
lucid intervals of longer or shorter periods.
Mr. Michie. ?What do you mean by a lucid
interval ? If a man left you a large property
in a lucid interval, would you have said, ?1
cannot take it from the heir-at-law ?the man
was a maniac? ?
Witness. ?I should have said the man was
in his right senses.
Mr. Michie? And supposing the result of
the story which Dr. Carr told the other day
was to put you into possession of a freehold
property, would you have said that that was a
lucid interval ?
The witness laughed.
Mr. Michie. ? I see your consenting smite
(Laughter.)
Re-examined by Mr. Billing? l formed wj
opinion that Dr. Carr was a maniac from what
I had heard, and from reading his evidence
From what I saw myself I consider his evi-
dence very straightforward and circumstan-
tial.
Mr Billing (reading from a book). ?What
is your opinion on this passage
theless, in such cases of epilepsy or intermit-
tent madness, madness should be considered
the rule; which, under cover of the usual


a mental habits and practice, is only temporarily
masked by the lucid interval. Yet in homi-
ies cidal madness, if lucid intervals exist, they
in are not admitted by jurists either to condone
s? or extenuate crime ??
to Mr. Michie. ?I object to medical men swal-
-1- lowing whole passages. I might make men
� swallow Connolly.
an Witness?l concur in the view, and place
?ffi not the slightest reliance on Dr. Carr?s evi-
re- The Chief Justice. ?But that is not the
01 question asked. If Dr. Carr committed mur-
ith der in a lucid interval, he would be hanged.
f 0 ; Mr. William Gillbee, surgeon, examined by
?lf Mr. Fellows. ?I have been at the Yarra
�� Bend, and have had an opportunity of seeing
; h e the buildings and other arrangements. lam
acquainted with other hospitals.
;ht Mr. Fellows. ? Do you know _ anything of
? the existence of maggots in hospitals, and the
cause of them ?
ie( J Witness. ?Under what circumstances ?
ra l Mr. Fellows. ?Where there are poultices
about, and things of that kind ? _
m ? Witness. ?In summer time it is difficult to
3a keep wounds free from maggots. You may
have them in a very few hours. Indeed,
during the hot weather the large blow-flies will
38 deposit maggots in a wound while you are
dressing it. I did not hear Mr. Rudall?s evi-
I ?r Mr. Fellows. ? I will put a case : an abscess
rs ? iu contact with the fractured ends of a bone;
can you say within what time the fracture oc-
J( * curred ?
0,1 Witness.?l cannot without some other evi-
njj dence to lead me to a judgement.
al ] Mr, Fellows.? No repairing process had
ecl commenced, nor any necrosis ?
Witness. ?Still that would not lead me to
IIV state confidently at what time the fracture
occurred.
a ? Mr. Michie. ?Extravasated blood?
Witness. Extravasated blood generally
ive takes place at the same period as the fracture
.. itself. You may have a broken rib and extra-
?'ll vasated blood without any external appear-
s �ce; in fact, in the case of a fractured rib
there is seldom external appearance of the
iracture.
Mr. Fellows. ?The fact that the bones were
?aS Hot worn away by attrition ?that they had
f a ot been so rubbed together as to cause a
, 0 smoothing or roundness of the edges?would
that help you ? ...
0 Witness.?l should be careful in making a
statement as to the date of a fracture discov-
ered after it occurred. It would be a difficult
~ question to decide, unless I had some causes
lie ' to lead me to the date. Even after a post-
Mortem examination, I should be very careful
,n - assigning a date. A fracture of a rib-bone
, ?night remain a length of time without any
?j' change of appearance that would lead you to
I, any date to it?without any appearance
11 of friction, reparation, or necrosis.
?t Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?The sys-
.. tem might be in such a state that there would
i. he no effort of nature to make any change. I
' i don?t believe the rubbing of two bones to-
i p?ther would cause a smoothness that would
? you to detect the date of the fracture. I
have seen extravasated blood on a pugilist's
eye after a fight. Extravasated blood is blood
forced out of its proper vessels, and is visible in
a black eye. I have heard none of the evidence
in the case.
Re-examined?l should look for extrava-
sated blood to be absorbed quicker in a healthy
person than in an unhealthy one. Nature is
longer in removing an injury sustained by a
man suffering from dysenteric diarrhoea than
by a healthy subject. .
Mr. John Blair, surgeon, examined by Mr.
Billing. ?l have visited the Yarra Bend Asy-
lum frequently, for the last five years ; and I
have had full opportunity of seeing the state
in which it was carried on. I have been in
the wards, and have gone round
with Dr. Bowie, The asylum has been kept
as clean as it is possible to keep an institution
of that nature. It has been very well con-
ducted. I have been there at meal times, and
seen the food served out to the patients. I have
seen the patients sitting at table, with their
plates and pannikins. Some of the patients
would pass their plates aside, but all had pro-
per opportunity for getting their proper share
of food. I had an opportunity of studying
the diseases of the brain, while an hospital
student at Edinburgh. I think the Yarra Bend
Asylum will bear a favourable comparison
with the other institutions of the colony. It
is impossible to have any institution of that
kind, with 700 patients, in the best order at
once, as it is impossible to get clear water all
at once from the Yan Yean. I believe the
cottage system an admirable plan. It is more
conducive to the health and comfort of the
patients, especially when becoming convales-
cent. I have had about a dozen patients at
the asylum. I found they were well attended.
I was visiting them daily, with Dr. Bowie.
The treatment was in every way scientific
and suitable to the cases he had under his
charge.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie ?l was in
practice for some time in the immediate neigh-
bourhood ?at Northcote. I did not know Dr.
Bowie, in a friendly way, for two or three years
after I first visited the asylum. I have visited
the asylum daily, and sometimes there has
been an interval of three weeks or a month
between my visits. I went, perhaps, once or
twice a month during the first two years. _ I
would go round sometimes with Dr. Bowie,
and sometimes without him. I been
there late at night?twice as late as ten o clock
?seeing patients.
Mr. Robert Bowie, examined by the At-
torney-General.?l am the plaintiff in this
action, and surgeon-superintendent of the
Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum. I arrived in
this country iu February, 1852.1 had not been
connected with a lunatic asylum previously,
except as having private patients, and visit-
ing them, and being appointed to inspect
twice or thrice a-year such institutions, by
the parochial authorities among whom I
lived. I had been engaged in the treatment
of lunatics, I suppose, forty years. _ I was in
the habit of visiting patients at private asy-
lums at Hoxton, Bethnal Green, and at the
west end of London.
The Attorney-General? Were you ap-


pointed inspector to any lunatic establish-
ment ?
Witness. ?No ; I was to have been, (Laugh-
ter.) Upon my arrival in this colony I com-
menced practice as a general medical practi-
tioner, I was appointed in October, 1852, to
the charge of the Yarra Bend Asylum. The
condition of the asylum was then very im-
perfect. It was better in one respect, in that we
were not so much crowded as we are now. The
asylum was full, but it had no more than the
exact number it would contain, namely-
seventy-two. After a little while, and seeing
the distress existing among patients in the
gaols, I managed to take in more than the
usual number. I thought I could do so and
#t the same time preserve the health of the
institution. Mr. La Trobe was well satisfied
with what I did. There were no wooden cot-
tages at that time?nothing but the stone
buildings. There was nothing like a kitchen.
There was a miserable hovel intended for a
kitchen, and a washhouse and stable, but
there was danger of the stable taking fire.
There was no road, and there was quite a bog
around the asylum. It was a miserable place.
There was no garden at all, save a litle flower
plot just before my own door. The general
condition of the patients removed to the
establishment from the gaols was very bad.
Many of them were dirty, swarming with
vermin, and covered with sores. The food
was cooked in the kitchen, and divided and
sent into the wards. There were tables and
forms for only a portion of the patients at
first, but ultimately we got sufficient tables
and forms. The first addition to the build-
ings was the erection of a double row of cot-
tages in the yard. When this was done the
patients increased, but the attendants in-
creased only very leisurely, Thi increase in
the number of patients was at the rate of
1r0m.50 to 100 a year. I did not get many
additional attendants at first. It was exceed-
ingly difficult to get attendants at first.
The Attorney-General. ?Had you the
same class of persons to select from as are
available in England for that purpose ?
Witness. ?Certainly not. I was glad to take
what I could get. There were no trained
nurses available, except two or three who were
in the asylum before I went. I think I had
two males and two females. I was obliged to
take in new hands?inexjierienced people.
However, I got on very well with most of
them. I found them obedient, and the great
thing in attendants is to do what they are
told. The cottages were lined with wood. At
the time they were built they gave great satis-
faction, and were thought very comfortable.
They were for the males. Then we had
another row built for the females. We never
had an empty house. We no sooner got a
house built than it was full. I think the pa-
tients increased to 150 or 200 before we had
the larger buildings. I have now brought you
to the end of 1863 or the beginning of 1854.
We then had a better style of wooden build-
ings erected. We had a large room 110 ft. long,
with dormitories on each side. We then had
sufficient room for a time, but in the course of
two or three months we required more. This
has been the constant difficulty since I have
been at the institution?we have had so matir
more people than we could accommodate con-
veniently. The first visitors were Dr. Sullivan
and Mr. James Smith, Then Dr, Sullivan
died, and Dr. O?Mullane took his place, hut
only for a few months. Then we had Dr.
Eades, Mr, Smith, and Dr. Dick, Dr, M'Crea
came, I think, in 1855. I had not the same
accommodation or appliances that could be
found in any well kept institution in Eng-
land. I managed without, but it was with
difficulty. During this period, I was in the
hahit of going round the wards and examin-
ing the patients twice a day, I was also in
the habit of examining the premises. I have
seen vermin and lice on the patients, but they
were no sooner seen than orders to clean were
given. I thought they were very few, con-
sidering the nature of the building. It is im-
possible to be altogether free from them. The
attention of the board of visitors was called
to the circumstances. We kept the place as
clean as possible with decoctions; and we
scalded the beds. Dr, M?Crea recommended
a solution of corrosive sublimate, I thought
it dangerous, but it was tried. It so happened,
however, that it caused the whitewash to peel
off the walls, and the stuff was carried out to
the dunghill, and led to the destruction of a
number of favourite fowl and peacocks. There
was an increase of the wooden cottages and
cells on the other side of the large yard.' These
additional buildings accommodated about
fifty people. The attendants now began to be
increased a little more liberally, but I was
still short.
The Attorney-General.? When the pa-
tients were about 160, what number of atten-
dants had you ?
Witness.?l suppose from ten to twelve.
Subsequently, there was one attendant to
every eleven patients, but I always had some
patients over. There were about four acres
of garden formed in 1855. I was told it
would be impossible to have a garden. The
whole extent of garden we have now under
cultivation is about fifteen acres. About
five acres of that is my own private garden.
I grow in it vegetables, maize, flowers, and
fruit. The patients? garden consists of about
ten or twelve acres. I find the garden a
healthy occupation?one in which the pa-
tients take great interest. Many of the patients
who had no taste for gardening when they
came to the asylum, are now quite proud of
it. I have jiever compelled the patients to
work in the garden. It is no use to try it.
The produce of my own garden I use myself:
I give some to my friends, and some is given
to our cows and poultry; but the patients
get their share. If there is one thing better
than another, they always get a little share
of it. I heard Coates state, when examined,
that he was ill-treated on refusing to work
because I declined to give a portion of the
produce of my garden among the patients.
It is not true. The next improvement was
the new stone buildings. They hold, I think,
about seventy-five patients. Yards are at-
tached to them. Some additional wooden
cottages were then erected, on my own sag"
gestion. I have always recommended cot'
tages. The advantages of cottages over ordi'


tm wards is, that they are better ventilated r j
h Ant ] more comfortable, that they look to the 1
7) ' undents more like home. They are not so i
in much crowded* and if there is a noisy patient �
at the cottage he is removed. The patients 1
? a t the cottages had knives and forks, and 1
tables, and little gardens before their doors, i
68 There was an attendant to each cottage. 1
The Attorney-General.? Have you found 1
mur expectations as to the cottage system i
f' realized since the cottages have been erectedV
Witness?l have. Patients who, in the old j
? e buildings, could not do well, were cured after
?' they were sent up to the cottages. We have i
! n sometimes to draft women back to the wards, :
ve b u t rarely. Then we had for recreative pur-
y poses a long room, Where the patients could i
ire amuse themselves with dancing, concerts,
"? draughts, embroidery, and, indeed, anything
u ? they liked. Then there was a library, but we
?? e could seldom keep that in a good state, as
m the books were torn. Take all the care we
33 would, there was always a great destruction
of books. The brick cottages were the next
? work They form the crescent of cottages. I
1 think there are eight cottages, with generally
1 eighteen patients in each (though there ought
f to be no more than sixteen), and an atten-
. dant in charge of each. The patients in the
brick and wooden cottages are now allowed
"j the use of knives and forks. I know that
? under a sudden impulse, they have threatened
i to use the knives improperly, but no actual
Z injury has resulted. Then we had as wards
some two-storied buildings. They hold about
100 patients between them.
The Attorney-General. ?Has lunacy been
t increasing, as far as your experience goes ?
Witness? Rapidly. There has been a race
rr, between the attempt to give accommodation
i' and the numbers coming in, to the advantage
Z of the latter. There are now in the gaol
(I , twenty to thirty patients whom I cannot
take., The patients come now in better con-
bp dition from the gaol than they did in 1853.
Dr M'Crea came, I think, in 1854. He is the
chief medical officer, and I was then brought
? under his department. He ceased to control
?j the asylum in the beginning of 1861. He used
,t to come to the institution about twice a
a month. He examined the buildings, and
? sometimes he examined the patients. He had
f, what opportunity he liked of examining them.
For a time he took an active part in the man-
nV agement. Sometimes he suggested something,
1,, and sometimes he did not. He was asso-
I* ciated on the board of visitors with Dr. Eades
/. and Mr. Barker. These gentlemen inspected
n ' the patients, the dietary, and everything, and
ts do so still. _
R f The Attorney-General. ?Dr. M Crea states
. e that when the place was put into his depart-
,l ment, it seemed to be badly regulated.
?b Witness. ?I don?t think it was badly regu-
,e lated.
o _ The Attorney-General. ? Didhe make any
jg improvements or alterations after he became
Connected with the institution ?
t ; , Witness.?l don?t wish to say much on that
n subject, but I think if we had been left with-
r out him it would have been much better. He
stopped a number of improvements. It was a
i- | long while before I got the patients garden.
There were many other things which I wanted
for which I sent in requisitions. The food
was not served out in an improper, untidy,
and uncleanly manner. It went from the
kitchen to the wards, and was placed on the
tables with plates and spoons. I am speak-
ing of 1854. It was not the custom to throw
the tray on the ground, and let the patients
help themselves. Some of the patients chose
to sit on the verandah or on the door-step.
We were so crowded at one time that I had to
get one of the patients to make some tables.
With respect to amusements, from almost the
time I went to the asylum I introduced sing-
ing among the patients. They used to meet
in the evening, and sing and amuse them-
selves. The men used to play at quoits. By
decrees we got on to cricket. I did not object
to cricket. I was the one who introduced it.
I certainly objected to some games that were
proposed. I objected to marbles. There was
no restriction about the patients playing
cricket, except that the dangerous and violent
were not allowed to have the bats. I remem-
ber backgammon and draughts being intro-
duced I objected to backgammon because
the patients might swallow the dice. I have
known them swallow larger substances. I ob-
jected also to draughts, until I could have
them made of a large size.
The Attorney-General. ?With regard to
the bags, will you explain to the jury what
thev are, and where they were borrowed from /
Witness. ?The origin of their invention is
verv simply told. When I was in practice in
Scotland I had the charge of an insane
woman, upon whom we could get no strait-
jacket or anything else to secure her. I then
bethought?myself of a sack. got one,
made it into a kind of dress, and put her into
it and I had the satisfaction of seeing that
woman cured. I saw the advantages of the
thing, and I used it afterwards. It was used
in the asylum to keep the patients warm, and
to prevent them injuring themselves An in-
sane person will often throw himself out of
bed leaving his bed-clothes behind him ; and
to prevent him taking cold, we roll him in a
blanket, and then put him into the bag. It
was never used as a punishment. My direc-
tions to the attendants were, never to use a
jacket or bag without consulting me. If an
extreme case arose, a man might be put into
a jacket, but I must be told immediately. If
an attendant had not done this, he would
have been discharged. The bags were of
different sizes. None of them were tight. A
patient in a bag had more freedom for his
hands than in a jacket. _My positive instruc-
tions were, that if a patient relieved himself
i in his night-dress, another bag should be put
ol The Attorney-General called the wit-
ness?s attention to a passage in Dr. Conolly s
work on the Treatment of the Insane, to the
effect that many patients in the early stage of
their malady could not be safely placed in
their ordinary sleeping-room without being
fastened to their bedsteads.
Witness.?l would not fasten any patient to
the bedstead ; but, if I did not use the bag, I
should have to do so. If he wanted more re-
straint I should put him m a jacket. Dr.


Cair came into the asylum on the 17th March,
1857. He was in an exceedingly excited state
?loud in his exclamations as to the treat*
ment he had received in being taken up and
sent to gaol. He said, ?I am very glad I am
with you, Dr, Bowie.? I said, ? Well, if you
behave yourself, you will have no reason to
regret it. _ He said, ? I will give you my
parole I will not leave the grounds,? In the
course of a few days he was allowed to walk
about, an attendant watching him. He had
every indulgence that I could give ; indeed he
was treated more as a visitor than as a pa-
tient. I heard Dr. M?Crea state that he
saw Dr. Carr in a bag in September 1858.
I was confined to my bed, and I believe all
these mistakes?all this confusion about Carr
??took place at that time. In consequence
ot something that was reported to me by mv
dispenser, I told him to put Dr. Carr under
restraint, I got with difficulty into the ward
next day, and saw that Dr. Carr had
thrown a sheet over the ventilator, and
made other preparations to effect his escape
Me was exceedingly violent. He abused and
spat at me, and called me all the names he
could possibly think of. He was going to
strike me, but the dispenser (Mr. Armstrong)
stepped between. It is necessary to keep vio-
lent lunatics under restraint for six or seven
days at a time, for they may injure either
themselves or others at any moment. I never
directed that Dr. Carr?s hands should be pad-
locked up to his shoulder. I never saw it, and
never would have allowed it, I think the
position of Dr. Carr?s hands, when put in the
jacket on that opcasion, was behind his back?
the same position in which, I believe, Bona-
parte is usually represented. (Laughter.) I
recollect, on one occasion, Dr. M'Crea telling
me that Dr. Carr had complained that he had
been improperly confined with a jacket in a
I object to the jacket being taken
off, and it was. taken off. Dr, Carr was then
most abusive,_ and told the patients not to
take any medicine from me, as I would poison
the whole of them. Under these circum-
stances, and apprehending another outbreak,
I desired the jacket to be put on. These
jackets are of different kinds. The jacket
Carr had on was of an easy kind. There was a
patient in my establishment named M?Donald,
He was a powerful and furious man when his
maniacal paroxysms were upon him. Dr,
M Crea said that he has seen M'Don aid in
a strait-waistcoat, exceedingly tight, and fast-
ened with two or three padlocks: but it is a
mistake to suppose that M'Donald was in that
state all the twenty-four hours. It was only
during his worst paroxysms. At the time Dr.
M Crea saw him he was exceedingly danger-
ous. There never was a patient allowed to go
to sleep with a padlock on except on that
occasion. The jackets are ordinarily fastened i
at the back of the neck. The object of the
padlock is to prevent the jacket being un-
fastened by other patients. The size of the ;
padlock was about that of a half-crown. (Pad-
lock produced.) The padlocks might press
the parts where they were placed. On that ?
account I did not allow them to be used in <
the cells. Dr. Carr, in January, 1860, was 1
confined in a padded cell. I heard Dr. M'Crea f
, say that Dr, Carr had no convenience, and pas-
-3 sed his fasces in the cell. The reason was, that
* Dr, Carr only used the convenience to throw
I the contents into the face of any one opening
i the door, or to cut his head with it. The places
i however, were constantly cleaned. At that
> time I used to visit Dr, Carr three or four times
a day. I remember his coming to Melbourne
i on the 4th July, 1858. On returning, with
? the attendant, he told me that he had been to
I the Governor, that he had nothing further to
; do with me, that he had withdrawn his parole
? and it was only to Sir Henry Barkly that he
! would in future pay attention; he would go
; where he liked, and do as he liked. I said,
You know I must detain youwhereupon
he became insolent, and defied us as to what
we might do. He had one of his very violent
manaical paroxysms, and then we had to
adopt the usual system. When in one of
these paroxysms he was very violent. There
was scarcely an attendant who was not in-
jured, and I have been injured myself by him.
From the hour I went to the asylum to the
present time it has _ been my anxious endea-
vour to do away with restraint. I have done
away with it by degrees. I abolished the
chain handcuffs, by which the patients
were secured when I went there. I have
made padded rooms, but patients have torn
down the padding. The padded rooms in
the asylums of England and Scotland are
constructed of Indiarubber, or a sort of buf-
falo-hide, so well put together that a patient
would have difficulty in tearing them. I had
no indiarubber available for the purpose in
1854, I have made requisitions for it, and I
sent in the offer of a party to put up a proper
padded cell for �5O. I never got it. The
visitors were cognizant of my recommenda-
tion, but I don?t think they joined in it. I
kept a book in which the medicines were
entered, and I kept notes of any particular
case, and entered them in the medical journal.
That book has been away from me three
months at a time, and I have thus been caused
considerable confusion, I heard Dr, M'Crea
state th at the record book was continually
ordered to be kept on the board table, and
that the order was continually evaded. It
was never continually evaded. Some altera-
tion was recommended by Dr. M'Crea in the
dietary scale. It was to lower the scale. I
did not agree in it. It was tried, and pro-
duced a great deal of misery, violence, and
disturbance, My own life was in danger. We
returned to very nearly the old dietary. That
is sufficient, though not quite as much as at
first. I had no collusive bargain with Mr.
Smith to pay him double for knives and
forks. I used to prepare the estimates of
the asylum, and send them to Dr. M'Crea,
as chief medical officer. He has reduced
some, but I cannot tell in what respect,
I had a patient named Antonio Vicari. He
was idiotic, and constantly attempting to get
away. Dr. M'Crea states that he was shut up
in a dark wooden dormitory; but not one of the
wooden dormitories is dark. Yicari's legs
were swollen and ulcerated. He was not
covered with dirt. I used bark powder and
flour, which I find one of the very best dressings
that I can use in such a case. It is of a brown


colour, and might be mistaken for dirt by any
one who does not understand it. I know a
neat many people who use bark powder, but
it was an idea of my own. I had a patient
named Monckton, who died of dysentery.
Dr. M'Crea found him with a mutton chop,
but I did not know he had anything of the
kind until I saw him eating it. The patient
at that time was in a hopeless condition. He
was very dirty. I remember Germain His
head was blistered one night. The next day
I saw him, but I did not consider his head
dirty. Many of the patients are exceedingly
irritable, and it is impossible to wash them as
clean as they should be washed. In Germain?s
case, we had put on a rag with lard, which
weakened any stimulating effect that the
blister might have, and at the same time took
off all the dressing. I had a patient named
John Ford. He had an abscess on the ear.
I saw it after it had been opened by Dr. Cal-
lan. Dr. M'Crea said it had not been opened,
but I said it had. This was in the presence
of the attendants. The poultice had been on but
a few minutes before Dr. Crea came in. I had a
patient named Hebert. He was an exceed-
ingly violent man?very dangerous and very
destructive. He was under restraint for some
time. The book before me contains an entry
of the treatment of this man. He was a very
violent man, and it was necessary to restrain
him. He would have attempted to strike
anybody who happened to be near him unless
he was placed in restraint, I restrained him
to prevent his being violent towards his at-
tendants, and also to prevent him hurting
himself. He was never kept naked in a cell
with straw in it. After I went to the asylum
I had mattresses put in all the cells. Hebert
had a jacket on during the day, and a bag
during the night. He had a particular jacket
made, because he was suffering from dysentery.
Herbert had formerly been an artist or toy
manufacturer, I believe. I do not recollect
Dr. Carr requesting me to allow him to go
before the coroner when the inquest was held
on Herbert?s body. I said that if there was
anything he wished to say, I would have
bun brought before the coroner. It is not
hue that I kept him back. I thought it
was an improper thing for the attendants to sit
�n the coroner?s juries, I said to parties
about the Government that it was a strange
ming, but the excuse was, that they could not
Set strangers. We used to select as many
strangers as possible from the workmen about
"he buildings, and if there were not sufficient
fi> constitute a jury, we made the number up
with attendants. That practice has now,
however, been discontinued. There was a
Patient named Lang. He came into the
asylum in 1867. I heard Dr. Carr?s evidence
about Lang. It was a delusion. No such
ming occurred to Lang as Dr. Carr described.
Lang was so much provoked at Dr. Carr
taking the charge that we had difficulty in
Preventing him striking the doctor. I looked
at Lang?s face, and there were no marks upon
*"? There was not a single spot upon the man.
H was a delusion altogether, or a malicious
hehision. I recollect a patient named Mel-
bourne, and another named Joseph Hughes,
t heard one of the witnesses describe those
two patients being fastened together. I will
explain that matter. Some patients are ex-
ceedingly dexterous in trying to escape, and
sometimes two will combine together for that
purpose. Melbourne was a person of that
class. He believed that he had got a com-
mission from God Almighty to kill every man
in the world, and he commenced his attempts
by striking one of the attendants with a _ bar
of iron. Melbourne and Hughes combined
together to effect their escape, and Melbourne
got upon the parapet of a wall with that
object in view. I therefore considered that I
was justified in fastening them together. It
was done without any ill-nature, but for the
purpose of making thein tired of each other's
company, and preventing them associating
with each other for the future. The restraint
did not cause them any pain. I had used it
with two patients before, for the same object,
and it answered exceedingly well. In that
case, the two men had been exceedingly
troublesome, and I fastened them together
for two or three days. One of them said, ?If
I was only quit of this partnership, I would
not behave so again.? He behaved very well
after they were separated. [Witness here
read from the ? Eeception-book,? a book in
which the names of the patients were entered
on their arrival at the asylum, and also the
treatment they received from time to time, the
particulars of the treatment which Hebert re-
ceived, from the 28th of February, 1857, when
he entered the asylum, to the month of May
following. On the 18th of February, there
was this entry:?? Is now noisy, threatening
dirty, and destructive. Seclusion.There
did not appear to be any other entries as to
restraint.] Witness continued. ?Hebert died
on the 21st of May. For about a fortnight
before he died, he had no restraint on him at
all. These entries as to the treatment of the
case were open to the inspection of the board
at any time, and there was no objection made
to the particular treatment adopted. I heard
the evidence about Fitzgerald, a patient, who
died. Fitzgerald wanted to starve himself to
death. I had to feed him, I fed him even
twice a day, and paid the utmost attention
to him I could; but he died of exhaustion on
the 22nd of March, this year. I heard the
evidence of Hugman about the treatment
of Fitzgerald, but I do not believe it.
There was not a bag put on Fitzgerald
locked with a padlock. There never was
a padlock on a bag. It is not true that
patent gloves, with straps round the wrists,
were used for Fitzgerald until there were in-
dentations upon the patient?s wrists. Hug-
man never reported such a state of things to
me. I did not see Fitzgerald when he died.
A patient, named Patrick Mullens, has been
spoken of. I heard Mr. Iludall examined,
Mullens was a very troublesome, restless
patient. He had a black eye, and was very
much bruised when he came to the asylum,
and he said he had been very much beaten.
I saw him nearly every diy he was in the
asylum. He was not a very spare man, nor
yet of a very full habit; he was middling.
I did not discover any fracture of his ribs. I
do not think he had any fracture of the ribs,
I There were no symptoms. His pulse was as


regular as any man's. It is no Uncommon
thing to find, after death, that a lunatic had
serious disease which had never been dis-
covered during life. I heard O?Grady ex-
amined. If Melbourne was in restraint four
or five months by my orders, there will be an
entry about it in my book. He had to be
secured several times at night, but an easy
kind of restraint was used ?a pocket jacket.
[Witness here refreshed his memory by look-
ing at the book.]
The Attorney-General. How do you
keep that book?
Witness.?The steward, Mr. Bifond, made the
entries in it.
The Attorney-General.? From what in-
formation was it made ?
Witness.?The attendant, under whose care
the patients in restraint were placed, took the
particulars of the restraint to the dispenser, the
dispenser took them to the steward, and the
steward made the entries.
The Attorney-General?Did you then
look to the book to see that the restraint was
ln accordance with your directions ?
Witness.?l did not look at the entries every
day but I did every second or third day. I
can t check every entry. 1 checked the greater
number of them, and, to the best of my be-
lief, they are right. I looked at the entries
in the book while my directions as to the
restraint to be used were fresh in my mind.
Mr. Michie objected to this evidence, on
the that the witness could not speak
us to the original information from which the
entries were made in the book.
The Chief Justice remarked that the wit-
ness had stated that the particulars of every
case of restraint were entered in this book,
and he (the Chief Justice) would be desirous to
know by what process that was done and what
check there was upon the entries. He under-
stood the witness?s statement upon those points;
but what it was worth was another matter.
Examination continued. ?There was no
man under restraint without my knowing it.
I inspected the book while the orders which I
had given were fresh in my memory. My
signature is affixed to the entries in the book.
I could not be more particular about the
matter. No objection was made by Dr.
M Crea or any of the visitors to the particular
treatment entered. I find from the book that
in August, Melbourne was thirty-one days in
restraint, ten hours each day. He was never
in restraint during the night. The dress
used during the day was of the loosest kind?
it was the jacket with pockets. He had a bag
on at night, and his hands were loose at
meals during the day. Melbourne was a
very powerful and dangerous lunatic. In
September, he was thirty days in restraint
ten hours each day ; and in October, he was
twelve days in restraint, ten hours each day.
In the next month, the restraint was done
away with, as I found he could be trusted.
The reason why he was put in restraint was
because he was a very violent man, and had
threatened that he would escape, if it cost
him his life or the lives of the attendants. I
do not_ very perfectly recollect Dr. Whitten-
bury visiting the asylum. I think I saw him
there. I do not recollect Dr, Whittenbury
asking me to show him a violent patient, I
do not recollect the occasion to which Br,
Whittenhury referred in his evidence. 1 don?t
believe such circumstances could occur as he
described?that the bolts of a lunatic?s cell
were withdrawn at a given signal, and four
attendants sprang in upon the lunatic, and
that after they got out, the patient made a
spring at the grating of the cell. There is no
grating in the cell. There is a small opening
of about three inches. There is a grating out-
side the cell altogether.
The Attorney-General Then this is an-
other delusion we hav discovered. (Laughter.)
Witness.?l heard Dr. Barry examined, and
make a statement about a female patient
having had her hair cut off. I do not remem-
ber that circumstance. I expect that is another
delusion. I never ordered any woman?s hair
to be cut off for breaking a window. I have no
recollection of Dr. Barry pointing to a boy
who wanted air and exercise. I believe he
was right when he said that he saw a woman
sitting upon a log using obscene language.
There was a woman of that character. She
could not have been pacified by quiet means,
There must have been some species of restraint
to pacify her. She is now better, fortunately.
She is now in the cottages, and is a quiet,
peaceable woman. My experience is quite
contrary to Dr. Barry?s, when he says that
lunatics never attack persons unless they are
ill-treated or provoked. There was no patient
named M?Coll in the asylum. There was one
named William Macaulay, who died there. I
saw him die. He was completely emaciated,
and died of consumption. There might be
bed-sores upon him. He was some weeks in
bed. I attended him every day until his death.
His bedding was kept as clean as it possibly
could be, considering the state of the patient.
I do not remember the attendant who had
charge of him. It is perfectly untrue that he
was a mass of maggots when he died. There
was no such thing. In hot weather it is ex-
ceedingly difficult to keep them clear from
maggots, but they are always kept clean. We
have very few maggots. I have used a prepa-
ration of arsenic to prevent them, and it has
been found very useful. The maggots are
living almost as soon as they pass from the
body of the fly. I do not think Wainwright
came and said to me he was likely to die. I
believe it was a patient named Dorres who
came. I might have said I hoped they would
keep him alive till twelve o?clock. If he died
before then it would be another death to the
week. I wished to avoid that, but I had no
particular reason for doing so. Edwards was
a quiet, peaceable, well-behaved man. I heard
Coates?s statement, that Edwards had been
locked up for refusing to work in the garden.
That is not true. He never required to be shut
up or restrained. Upon one occasion he let,
the garden because he was ill, and he re-
mained in his dormitory until he was wellf
He was not locked up for threatening Coates.,
He was never locked up at all. He was ill
and I remember Coates saying that hwe as
skulking, and that he ought not to be allowed
to remain in his dormitory* The form of
Coates?s insanity was moral insanity, with
kleptomania, or a desire of stealing. I was


I B lgo told he had attempted to commit suicide, i
�r. While working in the garden he believed that J
ft spirits surrounded him. I know Mary Steele, i
ie Sloane was one of the attendants at the ]
ill asylum, and used to drive me to town. Steele :
ir W as discharged from the institution, but I was
id not aware that she was pregnant at that time. '
a I first heard a rumour that she was pregnant
10 about a fortnight before I found it out. I had
ig instituted inquiries, but had been unable to
t- discover the truth of the rumour. One day
when I was out with my carriage I met
n- Steele's brother, and asked him how his sister
r.) was. He said, ?Do you not know she is m
id the family*way by one of your _ attendants .
it I immediately said, ? Sloane, drive me to Mrs.
a- Steele?s house.? He did so ; Mrs. Steele came
er to the door, and I went in. I saw the state
ir she was in. A report had been that
10 Sloane was the father of the child, and 1 sent
yj gome parties, including my son, to make m-
ie nuiries of Mrs. Steele. Sloane, however, was
.n rather cunning, and got an old woman to per-
:e, senate Mrs. Steele when they went. In this
le way Sloane threw us off the scent, When i
is. went to the house I found it out. ( When 1
it came out of the house Sloane said, Does she
y. say who is the father?? I replied, You drive
st, me home.? As soon as he drove me home i
te said to Sloane, ? You may walk, sir. i sent
it him off. Steele was received into the asylum
re in July, 1856, and discharged on the 11th ot
it February, 1859. She was hired as a laundress
ie on the 14th of February, 1859, and left in Sep-
I tember of that year. My visit to her would
1, be about a month before she was confined. 1
ie think it would be about May or June, low.
n The Attorney-General here read the mi-
ll. lowing paragraph from The Argun of November
ly 20 1861:?? We trust the authorities at the
t. Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum will be able to
d put us in a position to contradict some very
ie usrly rumours prevalent as to a child to wnicii

mours imply.? , ... , .
is Witness. ?There was a child born in the
re asylum a short time before that was pub-
re lished. The mother came from the gaol, cer-
it tified to be pregnant. I thought the rumours
I referred to that child. I heard Coates s evi-
-0 dence as to the mode of cleaning out the cells,
d Hot sand and lime were used to scrub out the
d cells. The patients were not in the celts at
e the time. The sand and lime were scrubbed
c off in half an hour after they were put on.
?s That process is recommended by the tommis-
d sioners of Lunacy. It takes away all the
11 offensive smell. It will happen that the beds
>? of the patients may be daubed with excre-
* ment, but they are always cleaned imme-
diately, They never remained in that state
for days together. The patients have never
1 Wen allowed to remain dirty with excrement
? for four or live days together. I never saw an
i attendant throw a clean sheet over a bed as l
8 went round. I went round the wards at all
i hours of the day. I examined the patients,
11 and felt their pulses. The medicines were sent
!1 out in proper medicine bottles, corked, la-
-8 belled, and dated. It is not true that we
issued medicine in old tom bottles, without
labels or corks. Philip Goode was an attend-
ant. I did not know of the debt he owed to
mv son-in-law when he came to me. He told
me of it, and paid it off. I did not employ
him on the condition that he paid it, i Ire*
quently saw the medicines administered
to the patients. I never saw the bottles
remaining in the morning without the
medicine having been administered. 1
might say Coates was a dangerous man
in his presence. He used to have wine
from my kitchen, hut when he went into
the asylum he was put on the ordinary allow-
ance. He said he would not work any longer
in the garden, and he went inside the asylum.
I did not press him to work. lam not aware
that he was removed from one ward to
another when the visitors came round, to
prevent him seeing them. Such a thing did
not occur. I heard his evidence about the
520 bugs he caught. I don?t believe there
were so many caught. He showed me a num-
ber of bugs he had collected, but I did not count
them. I told him he had not obtained them
in a straightforward way. I meant jhe had
employed agents to collect them all over the
building. (Loud laugh ter.) . 1Y
Mr. Michie. ?That will do just as well. _
The Attorney-General. ? A kind ot joint
venture of the lunatics. (Laughter.)
Examination continued. ?Dr. M Crea knew
we were doing all we could to destroy the
bugs. At last I have succeeded, and we
have very few now. Coates was a dirty man
and we could not get him to wash himself.
I may have said that he bred lice?that he
was a lousy subject. Some insane patients
are liable to breed them. I believe he did
breed them. I did not know Mrs. Churchill,
a friend of the gardener's. I remember seeing
a woman come. I did not run alter her, but 1
might have asked her if she was carrying away
a message. I did not lock Coates up for a
fortnight because I thought he was sending a
message by her. Paddy M?Loughlin jwas an
attendant. I never heard he knocked down a
patient called Anderson. 0 Donoghue was a
capital attendant, but he had one failing he
occasionally got intoxicated. I sent him two
or three times away, but he came pack in .a
state of starvation, and I employed him again.
At last I was compelled to discharge him
finally, and one day he was found drunk in a
ditch. He afterwards died in gaol. Goode
has gone to England, and is educating for the
church. His father was a .clergyman of the
Church of England. I never told Coates that
I would not visit the wards at different times.
I remember Coates suggesting something to
the effect that I ought to do so, but 1 did not
say I would not. It was my custom to do so.
? 1 had a key of all the wards. The patients
s played at bagatelle and billiards. My son and
? his friends sometimes.played, but they would
not have deprived a patient of an opportunity
l of playing. I think the statement about skulls
[ lying about the ground, and parts of dead
I bodies hanging on the trees is a delusion. I
, never saw anything of the kind, and I must
t have seen bones and flesh if there had been
- anv about. There were two or three small
3 portions of skulls which I wished to preserve


and present to the mnsenm, as illustrative of
particular diseases. They were,however, in the
dead-house, and could not have been got out
unless Coates,or somebody, had taken them out.
I afterwards found there was no place in the
museum for such things, and they were buried
m the cemetery. It is not true that the food
was brought to the patients on dirty plates.
It is not true that they snatched the food
from each other?s plates. Atone time there
was such an excitement amongst the patients
about the reduction of the diet, that there was
a regular scramble amongst them for the food.
I heard Coates s statement about the death of a
man who went by the name of Jack Ketch.
He did not die in the way described. There
were no marks of violence on his body. His
nai ne was Charles White. There was a patient
called Charles, a sweep. He was a merry lively
man. I never heard that he ill-used any of the
patients. I never heard that patients drunk
puddle. Coates said one man had died of drink-
ing puddle, but that ma n is cured and has left
the institution. I don?t believe that sheets and
blankets were used to light fires with. There
is a check upon the sheets &c., given out.
1 lie attendants have to bring in a return, but
sometimes the sheets and blankets are torn
into so many pieces that it is impossible to
say how many have been torn up. The blan-
kets are twisted up and made into ropes some-
times.
The Attorney General here handed to
the witness a number of torn blankets which
had been twisted into ropes, wreaths, &c.,by
the patients.
Examination continued.-Coates told me that
he had a bad temper,that he had quarrelled with
ins family, and that he could not live with
them. He also told me he was a landscape
gardener, and that he had been employed by
several gentlemen, but he had quarrelled with
them all, and left them because he was too
extravagant and expensive for them. I some-
times employed Goode to write on the business
of the asylum, but not for my private purposes.
I did not employ him to run messages for me.
It is not true that he was frequently absent
from the asylum. I recollect Wainwright?s
evidence. His statement as to the conversation
about the_ wood is not true. It is not true
that he said ? Goode is doing some writing for
you, and I won?t leave the patients, to allow
them to jump into the fire. I heard Coates
speak of finding a pannikin of brains. That
is another delusion. Ido not see how brains
could get there. I never ordered such a thing
and would not have allowed it. Wainwright
told me he wished to resign, bacause he was
going to make boots and shoes at home. I
would not allow him to go home and w r ork
during the day because I found that, if he did so,
he was not fit for his duties at night. I com-
plained of his working at home during the day
and said I would not allow it. He then said he
would rather resign, and did so. One lunatic
escaped, and we thought Wainwright had
been asleep during the night, and let him
escape. There was a sewing establishment in
connexion with the cottages for the female
patients. I visited those cottages every day
and sometimes twice a-day. I heard Ray ex-
amined. It is not correct that the wards
f Ray refers to were not kept in a cleanly
3 state. The statement which Ray made about
t the food is not true. The cutting up and
. distribution of the food were as regular as it
3 is now, until the reduction in the diet took
1 place. I had introduced a system of sending
I up the joints to the wards, and allowing
. them to be cut there, as in any ordinary
[ establishment, but my plan was withdrawn,
: and I was obliged to return to the former
way. The visitor?Dr. Eades amongst others
; ?expressed surprise that the attandents could
guess so correctly in cutting up the meat. It
is not true that the bags which have been pro-
duced in court have been made for the occasion.
I told the attendants to take clean bags, of the
regular size. There are bags in use at the
asylum of a larger size than the largest of the
bags brought into court. [Witness here com-
pared a bag in use at the asylum with the
largest which had previously been produced in
court, and stated that the one which was in use
was larger.] I gave no directions to pick out
any special bags, to be produced in court. I
said the bags were to be of the regular size;
and I gave the same instructions about the
jackets. The same kind of jackets as have
been produced in court have been in use at the
asylum. I never put any man into a bag for
shouting after me. I used a bag for a man
who was violent. 1 never used a bag in the
day-time. Bags were only used during the
night. I heard Thomas Hugman examined.
I never asked Hugman to attend to my poul-
try. He was not locked up for refusing to do
so. Hugman was an attendant at the asylum.
There is a drain which goes round the wooden
cottages. I wished the drain to be cleaned,
and Huhman did not clean it. I found fault
with him for not doing so. The female closets
were like ordinary privies. The patients when
using them, could not be seen. There was a
board put up to screen them from observation.
In some cases, however, it is necessary to have
the patients watched while at the closets. I
heard James O?Grady examined. It was not
the practice in his time to dry up dirty bags,
and put them upon other patients before they
were washed. I should not have allowed such
a thing, I heard Kauwerau examined. I have
always opposed the sunk wall. It is impossible
to prevent the patients depositing filth there.
While one patient was being watched by an
attendant, another patient could commit a
nuisance. I protested against the sunk wall,
I pointed out my objection to Dr. M'Crea but
he said it was to be done. My protest was not
attended to. I think it is not improbable that
day attendants may have gone to bed in the
day time, because we are so short-handed that
I had been obliged to employ some of the day
attendants as night attendants occasionally,
and, of course, they could not be expected to
be up both day and night. I heard Dr. Thomas
examined. I am satisfied in my own mind,
from the appearance of the bone of Mullens?
rib, and the appearance around it, that the
fracture had occurred much earlier, I have
seen ribs that never united. I could not under-
take to say at what time the ribs would unite.
The patient in this case was a restless man;
and, if the ribs had been united, it is possible
they may have become separate again by his


knocking about in bed. It is a common case
for a man to have his ribs in that state with- '
out feeling pain. Fat people, in some cases, 1
have scarcely felt a fracture of the ribs at all,
while sparer men would feel more pain. 1
The Attorney General. ?You don t think
I would feel it much? (laughter) ;
Witness?l wont answer for that. I don t
believe a person may be insane on one subject
and quite sane upon others, because the bal-
ance of mind would be overthrown if he were
insane upon one. One form of insanity very
rapidly and frequently merges into another.
Dr. Carr has clothes of his own, which he
wears to attend the balls and concerts at the
asylum. I wished him to put those clothes
on when he came to the court, but he would
not. I did not overlook the circumstance
that he might be excited by wearing the
ordinary uniform. I wished him to appear in
court as respectable as possible. I heard the
evidence of James Merson, contractor. It is
not true, as he says, that the contractors laid
down planks for me to walk to one part of
the building. The pathway was so bad that
I got a gangway made by our own carpenter,
and the contractors took the wood used tor
the purpose away, which they ought not to
have done. Merson never pointed out to me
any excrement lying about the paths. I re-
member Mr. Johnston, the Commissioner ot
Public Works, stating that the patients had
no means of shading themselves from the heat
of the sun. There were not sufficient means,
but a good deal has been done to remedy that
since. The wards were new in the first in-
stance, and the sun-sheds were not put up at
that time. It is perfectly untrue that the
windows of the stone buildings near rny house,
were daubed with excrement for six months
without being cleaned. I frequently recom-
mended the board of visitors to erect sheds, to
protect the patients from the heat of the sun,
and some sheds were afterwards erected. _ i
heard Job Phillips examined. I heard him
state that a violent lunatic could destroy a
padded room. I have seen that done. Ur.
Carr tore one down. I heard Dr. Pugh s evi-
dence. I remember Dr. Pugh visiting the
asylum two or three times in 1858. He
requested that I would not go round with
him, and I did not. I heard his description
as to the distribution of rice to the inmates.
He took a most improper time to witness the
distribution, for the patients were at that
time in a state of excitement, owing to the
reduction of the diet. I was not present at
the time, and know nothing about what oc-
curred. The practice was to bring the patients
a certain quantity of food, and to it
into as equal quantities as possible. The rice
was carried to the wards in one or two messes,
and distributed amongst the patients, every
one getting his allowance. Dr. Pugh evidently
madic one mistake, in supposing that the rice
was given to the patients in unequal quanti-
ties. When he saw a large bulk on one plate
and a 'small one on another, the
had not had time to equalize the division.
The Chief Justice said this report could
not be received as evidence. If any of the
attendants could be called, that would be a
different matter.
Witness. ?I don?t think I have the atten-
dants, but I have their certificates to this
effect. The attendants have left. It was not
the practice to give the patients food in un-
equal portions. It was not the practice to
place the plates on the ground outside the
wards; but many of the patients preferred to
have their food outside, and it was given to
them there. It was not the practice to put
three or four rations on one plate. There is
another thing with respect to the distribution
of the rice. The longer rice is boiled the
heavier it grows; so that a man may get six-
teen ounces apparently, and yet have no more
than another who only gets four. I have
known instances in which it has been neces-
sary for three or four attendants to hold a pa-
tient. It is some times more merciful to send
three or four attendants to a patient than
only one or two, as it prevents the patient
struggling. I heard the suggestion made as
to the erection of stanchions on the upper
verandahs. I objected to that because it
would give a gaol-like appearance, and a pa-
tient might fasten a rope to the stanchions
and hang himself. I heard Dr. Stilwell ex-
amined. I heard him say that I said if a pa-
tient was sufficiently violent, he could not be
restrained in a padded room. If we had suffi-
cient attendants and proper padded rooms,
there would not be a patient under restraint
in the Yarra Bend Asylum. I have frequently
made applications for these, and have pointed
out the necessity of the asylum not being
so over-crowded. I never was in Hanwell
Lunatic Asylum, but I believe the baths and
washhouses are according to my own plan. In
every English asylum which I have visited,
mechanical restraint is used. For months
past we have had no cases of restraint, except
an occasional use of the night-dress. Perhaps,
if we had proper padded rooms at the asylum,
that might do as a substitute for restraint, but
I am not sure. I think we must have the night-
dress. [The Attorney-General here handed the
witness an iron chain and a pair of iron
handcuffs.] These were the things which were
for restraint, in use at the Yarra Bend Asylum
when I went there. We now put the patient
into a blanket and a bag When I
went, the violent patients had a pair of hand-
cuffs on at night, which were connected to a
chain, which was fastened to the bedpost. He
slept in that way during the night. I dis-
pensed with all that. I truly believe the
patients get every medical comfort which is
ordered. I have administered the medical
comforts to them myself at different times.
Every year it has cost me many pounds for
the amusement of the patients, in addition to
the Government allowance. The attendants
also subscribed, and the Collingwood Band
have given their services at the balls. I heard
Coates refer to a patient named Potter. I do
not believe that the milk given to Potter was
partially consumed by the attendant. Potter
' never complained to me that he did not get
the milk. lam confident he was well taken
care of. I have looked over the book contain-
ing the visitors minutes, and think there _is
i not one complaint except those made with
i, respect to Dr Carr and Yicari, when I was
ill. The kitchen arrangements are now much


improved; they are perfect. We can boil a
gallon of water in half a minute. Up to 1856
we had only two or three old baths, which were
nearly useless. In 1854 I began the baths. We
had only four or five for 200 or 300 patients. We
have now ten or twelve baths, but they are of
a larger size. The patients themselves made
a plunge bath out of the side of the river,
which is nearly as large as this court. Nearly
eighty patients bathe there every morning.
The site of the new buildings at the asylum
is very unfavourable. I remonstrated against
it. I told them it would be found to be a bog
and a quarry, and they have found it so.
There is no difficulty in erecting proper build-
ings on the higher parts of the grounds. The
site of the old building is a very excellent one.
I heard Merson?s evidence about one female
patient beating another with a stone. I do
not believe that occurred. The rubble stone
was left about the yards by the contractors.
It ought to have been removed by the Govern-
ment, I consider. I got some of the patients
to assist in removing it.
The Attorney-General ? l will ask you
one concluding question. Did you ever, on any
occasion, put a man in restraint, by way of pun-
ishment, for anything done on the premises ?
Witness.?No; and I will never do it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Michie. ?The pa-
tients assisted in removing the rubble-stone.
I believe it had been left lying about the
yards for months. I thought it was best to
get rid of it. We did all we could to remove
it from the first. I cannot say how much had
been removed at the time Murson speaks of.
The site for the old part of the asylum is not
bad. I think it is an excellent site. I heard
that Dr. M?Crea had expressed an opinion
that it would be much better to have a new
site ?to remove the buildings altogether, and
to have a fresh man from England acquainted
with all the modern appliances for the treat-
ment of the insane. 1 will not give any
opinion as to whether it is necessary to have
a new man from England, but I will give an
opinion as to the site. Before I knew it was
contemplated to send for a new man, I had
strongly recommended that there should be a
new site for the asylum. My recommendation
was not strengthened by the idea of sending
for a new man. Dr. M'Crea told me I was to
be the superintendent of the proposed new
asylum. It seems there had been a wish
about that time that a new man should be
sent for from England. With some patients,
if you have a well-padded room, such as there
are in English asylums, you might do without
restraint, but I will not undertake to say that
that could be done. If there were good padded
rooms and sufficient attendants, mechanical
restraint might be dispensed with. I sug-
gested two or three years ago, or even before
that time, that a properly padded cell should
be fitted up, and that it could be done for
�SO. I made a representation to Dr. M'Crea
to that effect. I believe I made it in writing,
but I cannot positively say. I am almost
certain I sent a letter, recommending that a
properly padded cell should be obtained, and
that there was an opportuity of obtaining one
cheap, through a man with whom I was
acquainted.
Mr. Michie. ?Did you say it was indispensa-
ble for the proper management of the patients?
Witness. ?Yes. I would be very happy to
have it. If I could not get it, I would make
the best shift I could by having temporary
padded cells.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you recollect that Mr.
David Moore went to Yarra Bend Asylum in
1857, to ask specially what requisitions you
had for the institution ?
Witness. ?I have so many things to do and
think about that I can?t recollect.
Mr. Michie.?lf Mr. David Moore were to
say that he went expressly to you for the pur-
pose of receiving requisitions for the estab-
lishment, and that you had no requisitions
to make, save an addition to the culinary ar-
rangements, would that be correct or incorrect?
Witness. ?I can?t tell. I don?t remember.
Mr. Michie. ?Had ybu padded rooms in 1857?
Witness. ?We had had several padded rooms,
but they were torn down. They were padded
with canvas, and with painted canvas, and
were stuffed with cocoanut fibre and with straw.
Mr. Michie.? Supposing the patients had had
mufflers on their hands, would they have pulled
the padded walls down ? Do you think they
would have pulled them down with their teeth?
Witness. ?1 don?t know but they might
have done that.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you think the nose would
have been an obstruction to that operation ?
(Laughter.) Have you had many patients
without noses ?
Witness. ?I have had them without noses,
and some of the patients that have got noses
will bite very severely. If there was the
smallest hole in the padded walls they would
tear the walls to pieces with their teeth. They
would tear the strongest sailcloth if they could
get hold of one of the seams or find the
smallest hole. I have seen the whole of
the canvas on the walls of a room down
within an hour.
Mr. Michie. ?The patients having the use
of their hands ?
Witness. ?Yes.
Mr. Michie. ?But with the mufflers on ?
Witness. ?That is restraint.
Mr. Michie. ?But a mild form of restraint.
The learned counsel read a passage from Dr.
Conolly?s work, to the effect that putting
lunatics with mufflers on their hands into a
padded room, had been a very effective process.
Witness. ?I am not speaking of what Dr.
Conolly saw. I am only speaking of what
my patients can do.
Mr. Michie. ?Victorian patients, then, are
more successful in tearing the walls of a
padded room than the lunatics at the Hair
well Asylum are ? (Laughter.)
Witness.?l think so.
Mr. Michie, ?That is another discovery of
yours ?
Witness. ?Yes, it is.
Mr. Michie.?l will try to get an entire list
of your discoveries. You have invented the
bag, bark-powder, and bluestone lodging for
bugs, apparently. (Laughter.) Had you any,
experience whatever in the management of
lunatics ?
Witness. ?I have had experience in large
establishments where there were lunatics.


Mr. Michie.?What sort of experience ?
Witness. ?Attending to them In London
(here was a large establishment where the
houseless poor used to be sheltered. I was
one of the committee and their honorary
medical man. I attended the inmates of that
establishment, and there were lunatics among
them whom I had to take care of until they
were transferred to the different poor law
unions to which they belonged.
Mr. Michie. ?Do you call that a lunatic
asvlum ? , ,
Witness?lt was an asylum for the time. It
was the Houseless Poor Asylum.
Mr. Michie. ?Every workhouse is an asy-
lum, is it not.
Witness.?A species. I never had expe-
rience in the management of a lunatic asylum
till I came to this colony, but I had to visit
lunatics in parishes, to see that they were pro-
perly taken care of.
Mr. Michie?So has every vestryman.
Witness. ?I went as medical man.
Mr. Michie. ?Then you had the same expe-
rience as every other medical man.
Witness.?That is the sort of experience.
Mr. Michie. ?Then your experience is like
Dr. Wilson?s experience?
Witness. ?Probably the same. He had
about the same experience.
Mr. Michie. ?Every doctor of a poor-law
union at home has the same sort of experience.
Witness. ?I don?t know that he has not.
Mr. Michie?As to the opportunity of ob-
serving the management of pauper lunatics?
Witness. ?Every man has not the same ex-
perience that I had.
Mr. Michie. ?What were your peculiar op-
portunities that every doctor of a poor-law
union would not have ?
Witness. ?It w�Aild depend on the extent
of his practice.
Mr. Michie. Supposing a man is the
medical officer of a union containing some
hundreds of paupers, amongst whom there
was a certain portion of lunatics, would he not
have the same means of observation or expe-
rience as you have ?
Witness. ?It may be so.
Mr. Michie. ?What I call ?observation,?
you call ? experience? ?
Witness Yes.
Mr. Michie?You say you never used re-
straint for punishment. What do you call
punishment ?
Witness. ?If a man were to be treated
cruelly or severely, or chastised if he did not
deserve it, that would be punishment; or it
may be punishment, if he did deserve it. A
Patient was not put in a bag for punishment,
hut to prevent his using violence.
Mr. Michie. ?From the account you gave
of the manner in which Dr. Carr was treated,
that looks very like bagging him for punish-
ment, on the discovery that he had intruded
himself into the presence of the Governor ?
Witness. ?He was very insolent to me.
Mr. Michie. ?One would be petty treason,
a 'id the other high treason. (Laughter.) So,
from his being insolent to you, and the other
circumstances combined, you ordered him into
the jacket?
Witness.?l rather think that was the time.
Mr. Michie. ?There is no doubt it was the
Witness. ?Very well.
Mr. Michie.?Did you believe Dr, Carr was
sane or insane ?
Witness. ?Insane.
Mr. Michie. ?Then why did you order him
into a jacket?
Witness. ?Because he was a violent man.
Mr. Michie. ?But he did not offer any vio-
lence to the Governor?
Witness. ?I knew he was a dangerous man,
and might have done so. I do not know what
his demeanour was in the presence of the Go-
vernor, but I knew he had broken his promise,
and that he was a violent man, and I could
not tell what consequences might ensue. He
had thrown a great many things at my head.
I saw him strike Morgan Irwin before he went
to the Governor, and I knew that he was a
very violent man. I think he remained in the
jacket two or three days, and the ?storm of
passion continued throughout that period. We
did everything we could to soothe him. He
was placed in a room by himself.
Mr. Michie.?Did you tell the persons whom
you sent to see him in his cell that if he was
merely abusive to let him alone, or did you
give a general order to put him in the jacket ?
Witness. ?I saw he was in such a riotous
state, that I considered the sooner the jacket
was on the better. There are three padlocks
on some of the jackets?all behind. I remem-
ber the visitors ordering Carr out of confine-
ment.
Mr. Michie. ?How soon after they left was
he in confinement again ?
Witness?l think in about an hour or two.
I went somewhere else, came back, and found
the man in an excited state.
Mr. Michie. ?But the visitors did not think
it quite necessary for the restraint to be con-
tinued ?
Witness.? They did not see as much of him
as I did. I told them it was improper to take
off the jacket; but they had their own way,
and I had to submit.
Mr. Michie. ?Did you tell them that they
might spare the trouble, because you would
put it on as soon as they were gone ?
Witness. ?I told them if he became more
outrageous, I would do so ; and, about three
hours after, he became more outrageous.
Mr. Michie. ?Did Carr state, in the presence
of the visitors, that he had been offered his
release provided he would give up certain,
documents ?
Witness. ?That was upon another occasion.
I then told the visitors that I had not offered
to let him loose on giving up papers. I said
that to Dr. Eades, Mr. Barker, and Dr. M'Crea.
Mr. Michie.?Had you asked lor certain
documents of Carr ?
Witness. ?Never.
Mr. Michie. ?Had you sent anybody to ask
.him ?
Witness?No. A gentleman (Mr. Arm-
strong, the dispenser), went of his own accord,
but I did not ask him.
Mr. Michie intimated that his cross-exami-
nation would occupy something like an hour-
and-a-half longer.
The Court at once adjourned.


EIGHTH DAY.
On the Court assembling this morning, the
cross-examination of Dr. Bowie, the plaintiff, was
continued.
In reply to questions from Mr. Michie, the
witness said, ?I stated yesterday that the dis-
penser on his own mere motion went and applied
for these documents from Dr. Carr. I told him
he ought not to have done so, and that I did not
wi,h to interfere. I don?t perfectly recollect Dr.
Whitteubury visiting the asylum, but if he had
come I should have gone round with him.
Mr. MICHIE.? Do you undertake to say that
what Dr. Whiitenbury described in your hear-
ing as taking place in the asylum did not
occur ?
Witness. ?I don?t remember it occurring. I
remember Dr. Barry?s visit more distinctly. I
heard Dr. Barry?s account, but I never knew of a
woman's hair being cut off for breaking a pane of
glass.
Mr. MICHIE. ?Do you undertake, standing
there as you do, to declare- positively that any
portion of that is untrue
Witness.?l don?t recollect the circumstances
he describes. If he saw them, I did not.
Mr. Michie. ?Are you aware that the propor-
tion of attendants in your asylum is very much
larger than the proportion of attendants in lunatic
asylums in England?
Witness. I believe one attendant to ten or
eleven patients is the proper thing. In private
asylums there are fewer.
Mr. Michie. ?But I am speaking of public
asylums. In private asylums there may be an
attendant to each patient. Dr. Conolly states,
in his book on the treatment of lunatics, that the
proportion of attendants to patients in public
asylums is one to seventeen. That is a much
smaller proportion of attendants than at the
Bend ?
Witness.?Yes. But this asylum is very dif-
ferent from those in England. Here the build-
ings are scattered about, and consequently more
attendants are required than in an asylum where
the buildings are more concentrated.
Mr, MICHIE. ?But you don?t have attendants
between the buildings, where there are no
patients at all
Witness.?There is a space for them to travel
to get from one building to another.
Mr, MlCHlE. ?Yesterday I understood you to
insist upon the inferiority of the attendants, as
compared with those at home.
Witness. ?I said I could not get as practised
attendants as those at home; but after I had
them under my management I found them as
useful as any I could get from England, perhaps
more so. They required to be broken in. I
was the breaker in ; and having broken them in,
I found that, if they were not as good as Dr.
Conolly?s aitendants, at all events I got on ex-
ceedingly well with them.
Mr. Michie. ?Have you any iecord-book con-
taining ihe history of each case?
Witness.?l have a great deal of writing and a
freat deal of walking about to do, and therefore I
ave not been able to keep such a book as I
could desire. Besides, my books have been kept
away from me for months together, and I
have had great difficulty in keeping up anv
records. r 3
Mr. Michie. ?But stationery and other books
are purchasable. You can surely keep up your
Witness.?l keep them up the best way I can.
1 could always understand a case from the records
I kept.
Mr. Michie.?But could other people under-
stand them ?
Witness.- -I could explain them.
Mr. Michie. ?ls it not the fact that a great
proportion of the cases turned out by you as
cureA have been with you but a short lime?
in short, have been cases of a transitory de-
scription ?
Witness.?There are a good manv who are with
me a short time, and go out. They go out as
cured, and are recorded as cured.
Mr. Michie.?But they are not cases which
you would be justified in describing as cases ot
chronic insani y ?
Witness.?l have known cases sent out not
cured,
Mr. Michie.?Well, you have no record-book
which gives the history of each individual case ?
Witness.?Yes; it is here. It gives the history
of a case from the time the patient comes in.
The Chief Justice.- I should like to see the
history of Patrick Mullens?s case.
Witness (producing books). ?I am afraid I have
not that; hut I will send for it.
Mr. Michie. ?That is most extraordinary,
You fish up a book as big as a merchant?s ledger,
and although two of the pleas treat of the case
of Patrick Mullens, you have nothing relating
to itt
Witness,?The books I have with me are to the
middle of the month of .July, 1861. Patrick
Mullens died in November, 1861. The book
containing his case is at the Bend. The steward
kept topics of all requisitions sent to the Puolic
Works Department. Dr. O?Mullane was a visitor
in 1853 or 1854.
Mr, MICHIE.?Do you mean to say that hand-
cuffs were never used during the time he was �
visitor ?
Witness.?Yes. My a'tendants threatened to
leave me if they were not disused, and it was
then I introduced the canvas, and showed the
patients could be safe with it, and so got rid of
the iron.
Mr. Michie. ?But the impression which your
examination yesterday left on my mind was that,
as soon as you went to the asylum, the use of
the irons was instantly suppressed.
Witness.?They were not instantly suppressed.
I suppose they were not got rid of altogether
until 1854 and 1855. I got rid of them as fast
as I could. It was sometimes three months,
sometimes six months, before a requisition that I
sent in to the Government for woiks might bs
complied with. Some requisitions would not be
complied with at all. The floor of F ward wa�
not repaired for a year after I required it. A re-
quisi'ion for shoes was not complied with until
the year following. The steward and clerk did
the greater part of the writing for me. Goode
did writing for me, but that was very different
sort of writing. It was confined to keeping note*
of what he gave to the patients. In using the


ij jioket I confined the arms behind the back, for
the comfort of the patients. I changed the posi-
ks tion of the arms frequently,
ur Mr. Michie ?You geve them a day of the one
ud a day of the other. You call that change ?
D. fitness.?Yes.
ds Mr. Michie.?l call it torture. Have you
made the experiment how long you could hold
r- w t your right arm at right angles to the body ?
Witness.?You could not do it.
Mr. Michie.?Do you think you could hold it
at lor ten minutes without the severest pain ?
as Witness.?l think I could, but I never tried.
- [shall be happy to make the trial,
e- Mr. Michie.?l assure you that when you
lave made the trial you will reconsider the pro-
th priety of putting a man with his arms behind his
as lack the whole day.
Witness.?l am happy to take suggestions,
;h Mr. Michie.?But Mr. Johnston has said that
of you seemed to put your back up, and would not
take suggestions?
ot Witness.?Many gentlemen walk with their
lands behind their backs.
)k Mr. Michie.? I have my arms behind me now.
Witness.? And it is not very painful ?
rj Mr. Michie.?But then I can bring my arms
to the from, and do as I please wi h them,
is Don?t you remember that of the varieties of tor-
tore to which Baron Trenck was subjected, one
ol the most painful was that of being compelled
to preserve the same attitude for hours together?
Witness.?l don?t wonder at it.
Mr, Michie.?And yet you put your patients
r ? lor a whole day together with their arms behind
i 6 fcm?
Witness.?At the meals they are changed,
Mr. Michie.?Well, we will give you a pre-
ie lent of the meals. How long do they occupy ?
; k Witness,?Say an hour and a-half.
'k Mr. Michie.?And with the exception of the
�eal hours you keep patients ihe whole day in
10 this nice easy Napoleonic at?itude? I should
W think they long for the dinner hour.
Cross examination continued.?l had knives
i- bd forks in the asylum before Dr. M'Crea came
a there. I might have supplied knives and forks
to about a dozen patients out of perhaps 200.
[ 0 About half the patients have knives and forks
, 3 tow. A patient named Thorium, once rushed
ie kme with a knife. I agree with Dr. S il-
-3f toll, tha it is of the utmost importance that
totraint of a mechanical nature, when applied,
mpuld be applied strictly under the personal sur-
-11 toillance of the attendant. Restraint, if not
h tocessary, must be mischievous.
" Mr. Michie.?lf the mechanical restraint
?Pphed to a patient is beyond what is necessary,
i. toust it not have an irritating effect ? Must it
it tot b e confirmatory of the disease rather than
it toative ?
ii Witness.?l don?t know that. I have allowed
I to'ients to have axes, but only those that I was
ia Pretty g ur e ef. I know a pa'ient named Alex-
,e **der Anderson. He became excited. He
is tooted to make his escape, and he was rt-
?? ?trained.
il Mr. Michie,?When a man wants to make an
d 'toape, y ou ca ,n t h al; becoming excited ?
6 witness.?lf a man can?t escape, he becomes
it belted.
8 Mr. Michie.?lf slaves in South Carolina
sought to escape, and failed to cross the border,
they would get excited ?
Witness.? There would be excitement in that.
Mr. MICHIE, -Yes; in getting: away. Don't
you know that it is not a usual thing for patients
m well-regulated establishments to desire to get
away ?
Witness.?l have read of these things, but I
cannot say that I have seen them. (Laughter.)
Mr. Michie. -No doubt of it. You read one
thing, and you see another.
Witness. Yes, Ido very often.
Mr. Michie.?Wereyouno perfectly astounded
at the collec ion of bugs which Coates exhibited
to you ?
Wi ness.?Not I. (Laughter.) I knew they
must take a long while collecting.
Mr. Michie ?You believed that no mortal
man could have brought these bugs together?
Witness. ?Net in one night from one cell.
There never was a skull lying the grounds.
There were two or three which I had collected in
the deadhouse, intending to present them to the
Museum; but as I found they had no room, I
buried them. There never were any anatomical
preparations of my own on the bou.hsot trees.
I don?t believe it would be any great torture to
wear the jacket for a day, with my arms crossed
on my breast.
Mr. Michie. ?Have you ever tried it for a
whole day ?
Witness.?No.
Mr. Michie.?For an hour ?
Witness ?No.
v r . Michie.?For half an hour?
Witness.?No.
Mr. Michie -For a quarter-of-an-hour ?
Witness.?l dare say 1 have.
Mr. Michie.?Have you ever tried it for five
minues?
Witness.?l am sure I have.
Mr. v ichie.?Have you ever had the jacket
on at all ?
Witness.?No. I never required it.
Mr. Michie called attention to an entry in the
report, of the Board of Visitors, dated 4th Sep-
tember, 1856, commenting upon a case of ill-
treatment of a patient by two attendants, the in-
ability to identify the attendants, and Dr.
Bowie?s conspicuous advocacy of the a tendants.
The attendau s were a little accommodating to
each other sometimes ?
Witness. ?I should not be at all surprised.
The witness was then questioned as to the
closet arrangements in two of the female yards.
The exposed seat, he said, was to prevent im-
proper practices on the part of the patients.
There were no females having regard for delicacy
in those yards.
Cross-examination continued.?The Board of
Visitors did not wish me to accompany them in
their inspection of the asylum. I thought it
better to accompany them, but gave w�y when
they expressed the opinion that I might exercise
an undue influence. Carr bad the key of the
reading-room whenever he could be entrusted
with it.
Mr. Michie.?Do you think his lucid intervals
likely to have been prolonged by mildness rather
than force?
Wi ness?l always used mildness, except when
other treatment was required.


Mr. Michie ? A mild jacket.
Cross-< xamination continued.?Dysentery is not
a particularly prevalent disease at the asylum.
It is a frequent disease there when it prevails
elsewhere. But I think we have less of it than
other places.
Mr. Michie. ?Why did you say to Wainwright
that you hop-d he would keep a certain patient
alive up to twelve o?clock?
Witness.?l did not ask him to keep him alive.
I said I hoped he would live. I wished to have
as few dea hs in a week as possible. I have
never been to Hanwell Asylum. Ray, an at-
tendant, was discharged for breaking the window
of one of 'he cottages, and causing a girl to run
out,and place herself under tbe protection of 'he
night watchman, I suspended him and another,
but as Dr. Vt'Grea reinstated the other, and as
the thing was a lark, I reinstated Ray. i had
Melbourne and Hughes, two patients (who
could not he kept separate), coupled together, in
order to sicken them of each other, and the plan
succeeded.
Mr. Michie.? Have you had any private
practice since you have been at the Bend ?
Wi ness.?l have had a few patients who came
to the asylum; and I have given the poor the
benefit of my advice. On one or two occasions
I went out of the establishment to private
patients. They were chiefly friends in whom I
had an interest. Iwenttwice o Kangaroo Ground,
sixteen miles away. Two attendants were on
one occasion fined �l, by Mr. Hackett, for ill-
treating a patient. The patients were furnished
with small tooth combs and brushes, to the best
of my knowledge. I suppose (including the
chickens) I may have 300 head of fowl.
Mr. Michie.? l suppose they may make a
tolerable hole in the dietary ?
Witness - That I deny most positively. Fitz-
gerald, an attendant, was discharged by order of
the board of visitors; but he was taken on again
by direction of the Chief Secretary, because it was
thought that he was unjustly discharged. The
confinements hat have taken place at the asylum
are recorded in the book. There is a record of
the birth of the child (Armstrong) mentioned yes-
terday. A woman named Sage was confined
lately. Woods and Preston, two other women,
were confined some time ago. These are all mar-
ried women. An unmarried woman named
Thornton, who came from Geelong pregnant,
has also been confined. She was confined
four or five months after she came into
the asylum. Not a single woman has been de-
livered in the asylum who has not come into it
pregnant, I don?t know of any instance of a
young �oman whose name began with P, and
who did not come into the institution pregnant,
being delivered in the asylum.
Mr. Michie.? Will you swear that pregnant
women have not left and been confined outside
the asylum, besides Mrs. Steele?
Witness ?l cannot take upon me to say. I
don?t know of any such circumstances.
Re-examined by Mr. Billing. ?There is a
rule in the asylum that no patient at all dan-
gerous, shall be allowed to walk about without an
attendant. I found Anderson, a suicidal patient,
one morning going down to the grindstone to
sharpen a knife. The attendant who ought to
have had care of him was at once discharged.
By the Jury.?l think there is a record of
Thorburn, a pa'ient, having attacked me with
a knife, but I cannot tell the date. A gentleman
who has been subpoenaed, however, can speak to
the fact. I have been attacked by a patient
without making any record of it. Dr. M'Crea
gave permission to Dr. Carr to go to Melbourne
occasionally. I would not allow Dr. Carr to go
without Dr. M'Crea's sanction. When Dr, Carr
broke his parole, he had no attendant with him.
He wandered away from the asylum with the
intention of stabbing the Governor or Mr.
O?Shanassy.
Tbe Chief Justice. ? l don?t understand that
Dr. Carr broke his parole in the ordinary accep-
tation of the term. He went to the Governor,
and then he informed Dr. Bowie that he would
no longer recognise his authority, and accord-
ingly he withdrew his parole. He never broke the
parole.
Witness.?That is nearly so.
The Chief Justice.? Will you tell me how it
is not so?
Witness.?He gave his promise that if I
allowed him to go to Melbourne with an atten-
dant, he would never seek to go anywhere with-
out his consent.
The Chief Justice. ?But he never broke bis
parole. He withdrew it. He never went beyond
the bounds of honour so long as he was on
parole.
By the Jury.?Dr. Carr would attack the at-
tendants and myself, but I don?t think he ever
attacked any of the patients.
Mr. Richard Heales, M.L.A., examined by Mr.
Billing,?l was Chief Secretary for nearly
twelve months. The period commenced about
the 20th of November, 1860. The Yarra Bend
Asylum was in my department. I have visited
the institution altogether about seven or eight
times. I was satisfied with the management of
the asylum, so far as I could comprehend the
management during my visits, and as far as my
infortnaion went m the office. 1 went to one ball
at the asylum. There was a large number of
patients present.
The witness was not cross-examined.
Mr. John Basson Humffray, M.L.A.,examined
by Mr, BILLING ?I know Dr. Carr. The last
occasion on which I saw him to sneak to was
about fifteen months ago. I was talking to a
gentleman in Collins-street, when I was tapped
on the shoulder, and somebody called me by
name. I turned round, and saw Dr. Carr. He
had a three-pronged fork in bis hand. He said,
? Seventeen years ago, I stabbed a man in the
thigh with a fork ; but the proceedings were in-
formal, and broke down. You can tell John
O?Shanassy to look out. If I don?t have justice
done to me, I shall seek another interview with
His Excellency the Governor.? I told him not to
agitate himself; and that, if he had any claim,
justice would be done him. He then told me be
was the Due de Berry. I made no observation,
except to calm his mind, and walked on.
By the Chief Justice. ?There was no at 1
tendant with him.
By Mr. Billing. ?l communicated with the
Attorney General, and Dr. Carr was arrested
sime two hours afterwards. I thought it unsafe
for him to be abroad. I have visited he Yarrs
Bend Asylum once or twice, but several years ag�-


name appeared in the visitors? book on the
li of February, 1857. I saw only portions of
asylum. Those portions appeared very clean,
well conducted.
Cross-examined by Mr. MlCHlE,?Those por-
tions I saw under the auspices of Dr. Bowie. He
was with me part of the time. Dr. Bowie was
very polite, and asked me inside. I don't
recollect that he asked me to have a glass of
ICI I j ?
Mr. MICHIE.?I suppose the Dr, said.
You?ll have no objection to record your visit,
[r. Humffray ??
Witness.?l observed considerable anxiety on
rat point.
Mr. Michie. ? I suppose a man is considered
ther an ill-conditioned dog if he turns away
id won?t sign?
Wi ness. ?There is pretty much that feeling, I
iprehend.
, Mr. Michie. ?Especially when he has been
11 shown the clean parts ?
. Witness. -Yes. (Daughter.) I have known
1 Dr. Carr some years. I first saw him in Novem-
?' her, 1853. For long periods he has been per-
fectly rational and lucid, and able to attend to
. Ms professional duties. When enjoying a long
lucid interval, he was always recognized as a man
I of capacity and talent.
m By the Chief Justice.? He must have left
, Ballarat early in 1855. I think he was subpoenaed
' ? to the state trials here, and went home in the
e James Baines. Up to that time, he was in
general practice in Ballarat. I have known occa-
,* sons when he has had to be taken care of on
? Ballarat. That was not the result of any excess.
u 5 I have not seen him drink more than half- a-
II j dozen times when the practice of drinking was
1, very prevalent on Ballarat.
< Frederick Robert George Woodward, examined
,* by Mr. Fellows. ?l was a patient in the asylum
' � about eighteen months?from November, 1860,
jj up to about eight weeks ago. I was in F ward,
1 i then up at the cottages, afterwards in H ward,
1 and then in No. 6 cottage. I always found these
places pretty clean. They were well swept and
j '-leaned every morning. Dr. Bowie came round
? , daily, I have seen him round the cottages some-
J times twice a day. The amusements, in my
? a time, included bagatelle, cricket, dancing, and
' g( j dramatic entertainments. Those patients who
t lilted, and who were able, joined in these amuse-
n* �ents. I never observed excrement lying about,
?j it was cleared away daily.
John Goulson Burtt, examined by Mr. BILLING,
in- r 1 ave vls * tec i the asylum on several occasions.
*hn P aBS ' n K through the wards on one occasion
Ice ie ma, i e P a ients were taking their dinner.
Itb j I he lunatics rose up, and appeared to ad-
dress himself to me, in a complaining manner, as
1 iHhe small quan ity of food supplied. I tried to
be f e ify him. He made toward Dr. Bowie, bran-
listing his knife. I drew the attention of the
' Supers to the circumstance, and he was secured,
i. Ms was either in the latter part of 1859, or the
ginning of 1860.
the two last witnesses were not cross-examined.
ted This was the case for the plaintiff.
a ra The Chief Justice called attention to the
' *6t that Coates in bis evidence made a charge
' ?to perquisites and peculations, and expressed
his doubts as to how this should be sent to the
jury.
Mr. MICHIE said this was not specifically
relied upon. The only possible direction it
would have would be, that, in looking after the
fowls, so much of the services of the attendants
was diverted from the proper interests of the
establishment.
The Chief Justice,- Under what issue should
it come ?
Mr. Michie.?Under the tenth or eleventh
pleas, relating to general neglect in the general
superintendence of the place.
After a short pause,
Mr. Michie proceeded to address the jury
on behalf of the defendant. He spoke as follows :
?May it please your Honour,?Gentlemen of the
Jury,?lt appears to me that in the whole con-
duct of the case by my learned friends on the
other side, the most extraordinary misconception
has pervaded their view of what I may state to
be the merits of their client?s position here. They
have confounded altogether the character of this
institution with another. The lunatic asylum at
the Yarra Bend is not ?at any rate, jt ought not
to be- a gaol. It is, or ought to be, an asylum
or hospital; and I take leave to say at the very
outset, that when my learned friends have
been from time to time?l suppose on the sug-
gestion of Dr, Bowie, whose coarse discrimination
seems to me perpetually to involve the one es-
tablishment with the other?throwing back this
place as no worse than another, they by no
means apply their attention in a legitimate
fashion to tbe issues you hayetp try. A gaol, wo
know, is established for one purpose?an asylum
exists for another. A gaol is fer,punishment?
an asylum for cure. And when my learned
friends say that the modes of restraint or punish-
ment in the two establishments are pretty well
the same?that the punishment or, restraint in
the asylum is no worse than that afpretime in-
flicted in the gaol?they altogether, evade or
avoid the due mode of discussing thp question.
We have nothing to do with the question of what
inflictions parties suffer in the gaols or elsewhere,
but with the proper mode of conducting an es-
tablishment the merits of which we, for so many
days, have been endeavouring to comprehend.
With that caution, let us see how far my learned
friends have succeeded iu making out that posi-.
tion which was absolutely laid down?laid down
without qualification?that the publication of the
defendant, complained of by the plaintiff, is en-
tirely unjustified, and that there is not?to quote
the language of the learned Attorney-General?
? the slightest foundation whatsoever for the
charges or insinuations which have been levelled by
the defendant, Mr, Wilson, against the posi-
tion of this establishment.?* ?If you find,?
says tbe learned Attorney-General, ? in the ini
vestigation which you are about to make, that
these charges are baseless, and wholly without
foundation, the defendant must take the conse-
quences." Generally, I repeat now, as I did at
the outset, the admission that if these charges
are ? baseless, and wholly without foundation,"
of course my client, like any other defendant in
the same position, must take the consequences.
But if, so far from that, they are not baseless?if,
so far from being without foundation, there is the
most ample and abundant foundation for these,


and more than these charges, I say, my client is not
liable to be cast in damages for the publication of
what is called a libel?namely, an unjustifi-
able publication, without reasonable cause or
excuse, reflecting on the character or con-
duct of another?but that he has only done
that which, according to the law of Eng-
land, every man may do where he adheres to
the truth, and writes within the facts before his
knowledge, and with reference to the larger
public interests which lie beyond. With these
preliminary observations, allow me to call your at-
ten ion, as shortly as possible, to the sub-
stance of these various issues, and the evi-
dence, so far as we find it, applicable to
those issues. The first instance which I
placed before you was that referred to in the
second plea, which deals with the case of Charles
Herbert, and the manner in which he was kept
under restraint day and night?waistcoat by day
and canvas bag by night, made to fasten, as de-
scribed by witnesses, so tight as to cause a re-
straint to his person. Now, with respect to that
case, as well as the case of Alfred Yates Carr in
the third plea, there is no doubt that, to a con-
siderable extent, it is dependent upon the evi-
dence of Carr himself ; and I only guard myself
to you by saying to a considerable extent, be-
cause you cannot have failed to observe that,
although from time to time my learned
friends?under the instructions of their client
?have been calling witness upon witness-
witnesses day after day? with the object of
showing you that Carr, from his state of
mind, is a person unworthy of belief, or a
p-rson on whom you can place no reliance;
yet it is rather remarkable that when you come
to collate his statements with the account which
even Dr. Bowie himself gives in the books, and
the particulars furnished by other witnesses, you
find, in large measure, m many particulars,
Dr. Carr himself confirmed by Dr. Bowie and
these other witnesses. And therefore I am not
put to the difficulty with which I should be
otherwise pressed?'O ask you to confide wholly
and exclusively in Dr. Carr. In other words, I
am in a position to ask you to believe that
ha is a person on whose version you can
place the most implicit reliance, as that of an
individual whose judgement or intellect had
never been impugned on the charge of insanity.
But before referring to these other passages of
evidence that bear upon his, and to a consider-
able extent make out his story, let me for a
moment recall your attention individually and
exclusively to that unfortunate gentleman him-
self. In the first place, you had this great ad-
vantage before you?you heard his story; you
saw the man; you heard the examina'ion-in-chief;
you heard the cross examination. That story has
been taken down in all its circumstantiality. You
may have had the opportunity of reading it, as
it appeared in print, after it was told, almost
word for word. I ask you, supposing you were
to clear away from that narrative all the prelimi-
nary observations by which it was introduced
those observations by the learned Attorney-Gene-
ral?the actual subject of discussion before us?
suppose you hat the narrative before you as the
narrative of an ordinary man, giving you the
history of a succession of events, would you
not assent, as Dr. Wilson himself was com-
pelled to assent, to this ?that, looking at the
narrative alone, there is nothing from which
you can extract any suoposition as to the
insanity of the man? What, then, does that
establish, or rather re-establish, but ibis old
posi ion?a position as old as the study of the
subject itself?namely, that not merely is there
on the one hand monomania, but there is on the
other hand mania? Take the case as put, either
by Dr. This or Dr. That, you may have, on the one
hand, a man utterly unreliable on one particular
subject, and yet as sane and as capable of dealing
with o her subjects which he might be invited to
discuss as any other individual in the community;
on the other hand, you may have a man who is
subject to mania generally?who is, therefore,
totally and absolutely insane?and yet who may
have lucid intervals, of longer or shorter
periods, when he would be as entirely reliable as
any other individual with whom you may con-
verse. So take Dr. Carr?s case as one or the
other. It may be that he was under the impres-
sion that he was the Due de Barry, and no doubt
that proceeding took place which Vlr. Humffray
mentioned as having occurred between him and
Dr. Carr eighteen months since. On the other
hand, Dr. Turnbull puts it that Dr. Carr at times
is a maniac. This, however, does not affect the
position that Dr. Carr has intervals in which he
is perfectly reliable and sane; and therefore I
say that Dr, Carr?s evidence must be received
by you, unless impugned upon the grounds of
any absolute immorality upon his part, any
utter disregard of truthfulness, any carelessness
as to the sanctity of an oath. You witnessed his
admirable demeanour in answer to his Honours
question?? Do you know ihe nature of an
oath?? I place before you that witness?an
educated and accomplished man?as deserving of
your implicit credii whilst in the box speaking
on oath as any other individual who has been
called before you during the whole course of
this inquiry. I do that the more, because Dr.
Carr was cross-examined under advantages pecu-
liarly favourable to the Attorney-General for
shaking his testimony, had that been possi-
ble. You collec ed from Dr. Carr?s account
that he had been examined from time
to time before committees of the Legisla-
tive Assembly?hat he has detailed those
atrocities to which his person has been subjected
over and over again before committees ot that
body. You see, therefore, that supposing Dr.
Carr had been insane, or supposing he had
even been a liar, and liable to the application of
the maxim, that a certain class of persons must
have good memories, the learned Attorney-
General must have been aware of this. My
learned friend had the written letter of Dr.
Carr?s evidence under his hand, and had Dr.
Carr substantially varied from the version given
on a former occasion, down would have come the
learned Attorney-General on the witness, and a!
once have faced him with a circumstantial or
matter of fact contradiction. But was that at-
tempted? No. Why? Because no one better
probably than the Attorney? General knew that
both the one version and the other were substan-
tially the same?that both were furnished forth
from the memory of a man who reproduced these
miseries, which were too painfully burnt into his
memory, and which never probably would be


obliterated from it. He was asked whether he
had read the former evidence, or whether he had
not. He had examined the words when enjoying
a lucid interval, and he described circumstantially
and particularly all the subjects to which they re-
ferred. When a man gives evidence like that,
I require higher authority than Dr. Wilson or Dr.
Turnbull before I can admit that he is not re-
liable as a witness. Insaniiy does not speak so.
You remember the expression of one who was a
far higher judge than Dr. Wilson or Dr. Turnbull
as to the phenomena of the human mind :
? It is not madness
That I have utter?d : bring me to the t"gt
And I the matter will re-word, which madness
Would gambol irom ?
Why the old language of the English law?the
expression ? sound mind and memory??shows
bow deeply and inextricably the faculty of me-
mory is involved and implicated in madness.
It shows how utterly impossible it is for a
lunatic to rely upon his memory for the giving to
you, coherently and consecutively, the narrative
of a number of circumstances, dates, and events ?
that is, if he be absolutely and thoroughly insane.
It is a moral and intellectual impossibility. It
never was done, and never will be done. Then
that would entitle me to entirely rely upon Dr.
Carr, even if there were no confirmation whatso-
ever of the account which he has substantially
given to you. You remember the account which
he gave of his visit to the Governor. The ques-
tion was asked, ? How did you manage to
see him ?? The answer was, ? I sent in my
card.? Had he conducted himself with any
peculiar impropriety, you may rely upon it
that Dr, Bowie and his acute solicitor would
have taken care to get the particulars. And then
Dr. Carr told you that he had his interview, that
he kept within his parole, that he returned, and
that, as the result of his interview with the Go-
vernor, he refused to acknowledge Dr. Bowie?s
authority any further. All this was quite pos-
sible with Dr. Carr being at the time perfectly
sane. It appears that he was treated frequently
by Dr. Bowie as being perfectly rational ?that he
was allowed to ramble about the grounds, that he
was created librarian, and thus put into authority.
Dr. Carf, being conscious that he was under no
delusion at the time, desired to effect his enlarge-
ment. He returned within his parole, and then
what ensued ? So far, I think, as we may follow
out the legitimate conditions of the human mind,
the conduct of Dr. Bowie is much more like that
of a lunatic than Dr. Carr?s. I take leave to sav
that, as a general proposi ion, I think I shall
make this out incontrovertibly. We are quite
certain of one thing?that when Dr. Carr thus
returned to the establishment he was either sane
or mad. If sane, Dr. Bowie had no right to keep
him there a second. If insane. Dr. Bowie used
words which, I cannot refrain from saying*
would more properly come from a very ignorant
man than from a man professing to have a know-
ledge on the subject. Dr. Bowie has said that
Dr. Carr had broken his pledges, that he had ob-
truded himself into the presence of the Governor,
and that he behaved very insolently on his return,
and, therefore, he ordered him into the jacket.
Now, I cannot understand a lunatic behaving in-
solently. What is such behaviour but an ebulli-
tion of the madness ? It is absurd language
for an educated man ' to use with regard to
a lunatic. It might have been a matter
to be reprimanded. It might have been
a matter in which Dr. Bowie should have
endeavoured to humour his patient rather
than reprimand him. He could have said ? I
hope you will not go and repeat a visit of this
kind again.? There is a mild mode and there
is an unseemly mode of treatment. If we can
understand anything whatsoever from the discus-
sion of the subject, efficacious treatment consists
in the judicious application of mildness?the duly
observing of human character?the accustoming
the sane man to the morbid appearances of the
insane man. This was absolutely indispensable
in bringing about cure, or leading to the hope of
cure. But this whole process, which is admitted
by Dr. Bowie to be a curative process, is out-
raged by the treatment of Dr. Carr; because on
the 7th July this gentleman is incarcerated in the
unjustifiable manner which has been (.escribed,
and left for days wrought up to such a degree by
the absolutely intolerable misery that, to use his
own strong expression, he earnestly prayed to
God to relieve him from his misery. This I
think you will very easily understand, considering
the prolonged period during which he suffered
under that misery. And Dr, Bowie, who has
never experimented on his own person for ten
minutes, or even for one minute?who has never
ventured to say that he ever put a jacket
on at all?could live on at that establish-
ment and see this unfortunate gentleman,
day by day and night by night, subjected
to this most atrocious torment, although he pro-
fessed to read all those books which should have
taught Dr, Bowie something of his business, even
had he been grossly ignorant of it when first he
took upon himself the charge of the asylum.
With such means, appliances, and information at
his disposal, day and night he allows that most
unfortunate man to be in that position; andjthen,
gentlemen, he has the temerity to go into the
witness-box, and endeavour to make you believe
that that is to be accepted by any rational mind
as the best curative treatment. Was anything
so monstrous ever presented to a reasonable
mind ? If you walk to the zoological gardens
of any country, you see the lion and the
panther walking up and down their den, exhibit-
ing great restlessness at their being ?cabinned,
cribbed, confined? in so miserable a space.
Science would hardly justify'the case. How, then,
can be justified the confinement of Dr. Carr in
an instrument of torture, which even Dr. Bowie
himself cannot say was not an instrument of
torture, though he has the effrontery, almost
jocosely, to observe?? I have ordered the arms
to be fastened behind, because Bonaparte carried
his arms in that manner ?? ? I have my arms be-
hind me now/? says Dr. Bowie ; but there is this
peculiarity about the illustration, which Dr. Bowie
presents, and of which I reminded him when
in the witness box ?there is all the difference
between entire liberty and entire restraint. Dr.
Bowie?s most absurd and ludicrous illustration,
so far from being a parallel, is the most striking
contrast that can be stated by human ingenuity.
The one is total deprivation of the liberty of the
body, the other is the total possession of that
liberty. Although Dr. Bowie had at that instant
his limbs behind him, he could bring them


before him in the next instant; and when he says
that it was only for a certain number of days or
hours that Dr. Carr was confined, and there-
fore hints that there could be bo misery
or discomfort from it, I take leave to
say that Dr. Bowie-whom I by no means
intend to charge as a cruel man, though he was a
thoughtless and careless man with respect to the
subject?has never experimented, as I think he
was bound to do, on himself in all these years, in
order that he might ascertain what might be the
nature of the infliction, and what might be the
probable or necessary consequences Dr. Carr,
then, is admitted to be in that situation, and put
in that situation by the very individual placed in
authority over him?by the very individual who is
to cure him, by the very person who is placed in
this high and responsible office to effect as many
cures as he possibly can. It does not depend,
however, on Dr. Carr, or on Dr. Bowie?s ad-
mission. We prove the same facts by the
evidence of Dr. M'Crea. ? 1 saw the position in
which Dr. Carr was,? says Dr. M'Crea, ? I
considered it barbarous. I ordered it to be taken
off, and it was taken off.? And what took place
afterwards ? Do you find there were any jus-
tifying circumstances immediately afterwards
that could at all excuse Dr, Bowie in reimposing
that barbarous treatment ? Dr, Bowie said he
knew Carr to be a violent man. I think if he
had any desire that patients of this class should
be reasonably treated, he might have waited until
some fresh exhibition of that violence had come
on. Instead of reimposing that restraint by
simply sending down the attendants to put on the
jacket, as was proved' y Dr. Bowie?sown wi nesses,
why did not Dr. Bowie act according to the
advice of Dr. Stilwell, and personally superintend
the operation ? Instead of that, he quietly sits
down in his own house or goes to bed, and
sends down Tarraway and the other attendant to
put on the jacket. Away they go. They find
Carr lying on his back, using violent language?
not a very unusual circumstance in a lunatic.
He was not otherwise violent. The effervescence
of his temperament or nature might have been
passing off in mere words, as effervescence will
pass off both from sane and insane. All
these circumstances staring the men in the
face, what is the account they are com-
pelled to give of the manner in which
the restraint is reimposed? ?We had our
orders, and whether we thought it necessary or
not, we had simply to follow out our orders and
reimpose the jacket.? It scarcely lay in their
function to go back and report. Dr. Bowie, not
having had the advantages of similar institutions
at home, resorts to the worst practice of the
worst times in the worst establishments of the
olden period?to utterly obsolete usages with
respect to the treatment of patients of this class.
He is not a believer in these things. That seems
to me as if Dr. Bowie?to use Mr. Stewart
Johnston's expression?was ? somewhat im-
practicable,? and somewhat unreasonable.
With all possible deference to Dr. Bowie?s
Victorian experiences, I think that deserving of
somewhat more credit than Dr. Bowie's expe-
riences and observations are those multitudinous
experiences in all parts of the civilized world
which have ended in a new system?in an entire
and most successful revolution of the old
system, which revolution has been followed by
most beneficial and desirable results. Keeping
all that in view, I say, I think Dr, Bowie is a
somewhat unreasonable and impracticable person
in answering us in this way?? I have read all
these things, and I confess I don?t believe in
them.? As Mr. Johnston said, he ? set his back
up??a very good graphic expression, which rather
clung to my memory?? and seemed to consider
every suggestion a censure.? You have a whole
history in Mr. Johnston?s graphic account of the
particulars of his interview. You read there
the character of Dr. Bowie. I believe that
Dr. Bowie is not naturally a cruel man,
not perhaps na'urally a tyrant; at the same
time he is not naturally a very saga-
cious man, not naturally a scientific observer,
not naturally an enthusiast in bis particular
business as to being always abreast of the
experiences of the time?he is not a man of
that kind of capaci y or habits; therefore, he
has fallen behind the experiences of his time, and
has entailed results as disastrous as could pos-
sibly accrue from a man who absolutely was cruel.
Dr. Bowie, gentlemen, equally in the interview,
the details of which are given by Mr. Johnston,
as in the particulars which we extract from that
little incident of Dr. Yates Carr being put back
into his bag after <he visitors had departed, did
not choose to have his jurisdiction challenged in
the slightest degree. ? I am here. I am the
governor of this institution. I am not going tc
take suggestions from anybody, or observe any
course recommended by anybody ; and although
some of the visitors may require a thing to be
done at the very instant they are here, I will
have my way in the long run.? Like an obsti-
nate woman, gentlemen 1 That is more the
course Dr. Bowie seems to have observed than a
conscien'ious and nice regard to all the obser-
vances, and all those duties which ought neces-
sarily to be involved in his most responsible po-
sition. Well, gentlemen, I ask you, after you
have heard the account that Dr. Carr gave ua
of the particulars of his own individual suffer-
ing, of all the observations he had made as to
the inflictions upon others - Dr, Bowie?s own
admission that Dr. Carr was never violent to
any patient with all this before ? you, I
ask whether or not Dr. Carr is worthy of your
credit? Dr. Turnbull says, ?I should not think
him quite reliable.? When asked, ? Did you
ever hear of a lucid interval ?? he replied, ? Oh,
yes!? I also asked Dr. Turnbull whether, in
the event of a bequest having been made to him
by Dr. Carr in language as clear and intelligible
as that which he employed in the witness box,
he would reject the gift in favour of the heir-at-
law? Dr. Turnbull said, ?No, I would think
that was a very sensible proceeding.? (Laughter.)
In addition to this, nothing can be more certain
than the sugges ion which was thrown out
by his Honour, namely, that if Dr- Carr bad
commit ed a murder during a lucid interval he
would have been hanged for it, notwithstanding
his previous hallucinations at another time. He
would, in fact, have been dealt with like an
ordinary criminal, for at the time he committed
the crime he was an accountable being, and an
accountable being because he was a rational man
rationally distinguishing between right and
wrong. Not only did Dr. Carr describe the par


ticulars which he has described, but you find that
he was by no means deficient in the other
and higher moral sensibilities; for that was
rather a touching passage in the course of his
account, in which he says, that from the grief
with which he was afflicted upon the death of bis
mother, it was necessary to confine him in the
lunatic asylum of the County Palatine of Lan-
caster ; and that he shall ever bear in memory
the kind and considerate treatment he there re-
ceived, You find that Dr. Carr was not at all
indifferent to the feelings of gratitude. He
knows whether he is well or ill-treated, and the
kind and considerate treatment he received in
that establishment clings to his memory as
tenaciously as will the contrary trea ment he
suffered in the establishment, the merits of which
we are now discussing. Unless you, therefore,
are prepared to reject not merely Dr. Carr?s evi-
dence, but also to reject a great part of Dr.
Bowie?s own admission, ?to reject Dr. M'Grea?s
testimony, to reject Wainwright?s testimony,
to reject Ray?s testimony, to reject the tes-
timony of all those witnesses who speak to
the inflictions and misery to which this un-
fortunate gentleman was subjected,?l say
that the pleas which refer to his and He-
bert?s case are made out, I confess I should have
liked?confronted as I am with thm grievous
mortality which seems to beset this institu-
tion ? some more circumstantial accounts of
these cases ; but we have them not. We have
them, gentlemen, merely in this obscure form?.
that they arrived one day, that they were put to
bed in a few days afterwards because they suf-
fered, that they died, are buried, are forgotten.
I snould like to know something more about these
numerous particulars. I say that these pleas are
substantially proved. I say, with the utmost
confidence, that you are not justified in rejecting
the large body of evidence that you have sup-
porting the principal allegations of these issues.
What nonsense does Mr. John Thomas Smith
talk! He goes into the box and says, that he ap-
proved of the resumed treatment inflicted by
Dr. Bowie, forsooth! Because why? Oh, la-
mentable evidence to come from the Dick Whit-
tington of Victoria?the man who has been more
than ?three times mayor of Melbourne!
(Laughter.) Because he had broken his prm-
leges_ho had ? abused ? them; that was the term
used. He had abused his privileges, and had
rendered himself, therefore, liable to this
punishment. Gentlemen, for a man
who is sitting upon the justice-seat, and
saying from day to day, ?lined 405.; take
him over??(laughter) ?for a man who noni
day to day is bolding that most respectable
position, to use such grossly ignorant language as
that 1 I am sorry, I must say, for that section of
the administration of justice in Victoria, because
when he tells us that the resumption of the treat-
ment was justifiable, because Dr. Carr had
abused his privileges, he is using language
which alone is applicable, or could be warranted
in being applied, to a roan perfectly sane. *ou
see, therefore, gentlemen, what kind of spirits
Dr. Carr had fallen amongst. You find they
produced some of the vistore. There was Mr.
Perry, a gentleman knowing a little more about
auctioneering, probably than the treatment of
lunatics. They produced another visitor, but it
is a very odd thing that they have not called the
two professional visitors, Dr. Barker and Dr.
Eades. It is very curious they have called the three
non-professional visitors, but neither Dr. Barker
nor Dr. Eades. Why ? They best know. I can
surmise; so may you. Why did they not call
Dr. Callan ? Dr. Callan was up here ; unless I
am mistaken he was under this roof since the
commencement of the case, and his name has
been used very frequently. Why was his evi-
dence rejected, or otherwise superseded? He is
the gentleman who could have given evidence
upon one particular matter, at all events. I
thought it not an improper question to put, as to
how frequently the medical men might be called
up in the night. That Dr. Callan was frequently
called is so stated. Spirits were frequently called
from the deep by Owen Glendower; but would
they come when they were called ? Dr. Callan
was frequently called up in the night, but did ho
very frequently get up? That is the question.
These are two different things. In the first
instance, you have got to be saisfied that
he was very frequently called, and, in the
second place, you have got to bo satisfied that
he very frequently, or as frequently, got up when
he was called. Perhaps having quite as much
affection for his pillow as for his duty, he might
say, ? Is he very boisterous ?? ?Yes.? ?Well,
then, bag him!? (Loud laughter.) ?And ha
would drop in in the morning and see how ha
was getting on.? That might occur at eleven
o?clock, or ten, or just after tea, or any time
during the night. Perhaps it was very inconve-
nient to be turned out of a warm bed on a cold
night. (Laugh er.) If the direction was to
? bag him,? there the patient would lie from the
time of the execution of the order until. he follow-
ing morning, before his case could be considered.
I will not say re-considered, because it cannot be
said to be considered until a medical man makes
an actual, personal, minute, and in-
spection of the symptoms of the pa'ient
to know whether?to use the becoming lan-
guage of Dr. Stilwell, whom I claim as my
wi ness rather than theirs?it is necessary
that there should be any incarceration at all.
Perhaps my learned friend the Attorney-
General, in his reply, will enlighten us as to why
Dr. Callan was not called, whv Dr. Barker
was not called, and why Dr. Eades was not
called. Perhaps he will show you it was unneces-
sary. ?True,? he may say, ?you heard Dr.
Callan?s name frequently used ; true, you heard
some of the attendants say they frequently called
Dr. Callan in the night time, but then Dr. Bowie
got up one nighr.? But Dr. Bowie had got a
lieutenant?the lieutenant was to get up and look
after tbe bag. You have not one authenticated
case of Dr. Bowie being out of his bed after he
had actually turned in, to use a seafaring expres-
sion. We go then, gentlemen, from the second
and third pleas, which treat of the cases of these
unfortunate individuals. I am not desirous of
wearying you by the reiteration of evidence,
although I have a considerable number of very
important passages marked, to which your atten-
tion will doubtless be called by his Honour. I
am not desirous of wearying you by a mere recital
of these further passages of evidence. They will,
I dare say, be sufficiently fresh in your memory
to enable you to apply them to these issues.


*ni see how clearly and satisfactorily the
allegations have been made out with respect to
what took place daring the periods to which those
pleas refer. I therefore, gentlemen, proceed to
call your attention to the subject matter of the
fourth plea, which refers to the case of that
Eatient, Mrs. Steele, who, some time after she
ad been incarcerated there, was taken into the
character of a semi- attendant, and received some-
thing per month from Dr. Bowie. It would ap-
pear almost from the very language Dr. Bowie
makes use of in referring to hat woman, that he
had never ceased to regard her as a patient, who
was liable almost at any moment to be replaced
within the precincts of the establishment, because
you will remember that he said to her, ?If you
do not tell me who is the father of the child, I
will take you back again into the ward." Is this
the language which would be used by one in the
position of Dr. Bowie to a party he considered
entirely compos mentis ? He would know that he
could not address that language to a per-
fectly sane person, because the person so ad-
dressed, if she were perfectly sane, would
say at once, ? You have no badness to
take me back.? He might take lunatics back
into the ward, but no sane person would
allow him to have any authority or jurisdiction
over her. When you find, therefore, that he used
language which he could never have used if he
had not regarded her as still, to a certain extent,
under his jurisdiction as superintendent of the
establishment, you can have no doubt, gentle-
men, as to what was the history of that woman in
that place. I care not, gentlemen, what were
the particulars under which this outrage took
place. I call your attention fo her demeanour
and her language in the box. If ever a woman
were, it seems to me, deficient in average appre-
hension at the particular moment, that woman
was. A woman of weak intellect, with no inten-
tion to lie or deceive, it is quite obvious she was
not disconcerted in the slightest degree, as a
thoroughly sane or acute witness would be, at any
con trad ictionsor discrepancies in her evidence ;
and, with a sort of weak comprehension, or
scarcely half mas?ery of the meaning of the
questions put to her, she gave answers
to me inconsistent with some answers to
questions put by my learned friend. You,
who have been observers of human nature, will?
I venture to say, without the assistance of Dr.
Wilson, or Dr. Turnbull, or any other doctor, but
from mere observation of your fellow-creatures?
say that ihat woman, the moment she was giving
her evidence, was of deficient intellect. I say,
therefore, that Dr. Bowie was bound, with re-
spect to persons of that nature, to see that there
was no liability of such outrages as that which
has taken place with respect to her. It is quite
certain that the man Sioane did commit that
which has been imputed to him. It is quite cer-
tain that Dr. Bowie believed it. It is quite cer-
tain that Dr. Bowie discharged him for it. You
will bear in mind that, inasmuch as it requires
the certificate of two medical men before a
patient can be received into that establishment,
so it requires the certificate of two medical men
before a person can be legitimately discharged
from the establishment; and there has been no
evidence before you that Mrs. Steele was
ever legitimately discharged from the institution.
When you take that in connexion with the fur-
ther fact that Dr. Bowie said, ? If you don?t tell
me, I will bring you back into the ward,? we are
at liberty to contend that she was not legitimately
discharged. There is a rather curious circum-
stance connected with the manner in which this
very acute and sagacious gentleman ac ed in this
affair. His intellect is always wide awake.
(Laughter.) It may be, gentlemen, that he was
an old man, but he knew how to take care of
himself?no man better; so much so that he
never even tried on the jacket. It is very
amusing, as showing the remarkable self-posses-
sion of the man, to see the course he adopted,
when he had ascertained the fact that Sioane was
the father of the child. Sioane wishes to be in-
formed as to what was the knowledge he had
derived within doors. ?Drive me home,? says
Dr. Bowie, ? I will tell you when you get home.
Drive me home.? He was driven heme ;
and Dr. Bowie then says, ? You can go about
your business.? (Laughter.) This is really
a specimen of character, because it shows that,
notwithstanding the startling discovery, so dis-
graceful to the establishment?? A pretty way for
Mrs. Steele to leave the Bend in !??he was in the
position, when he came outside the house, of
what Sir Robert Peel would call three alterna-
tives?he must either run the risk of Coates
levanting, running away at once, if he said im-
mediately ? I will discharge you when you get
home or he must have put up his horse and
carria?e some way, and gone home in the
omnibus ; or he must have walked home. All
these alternaiives Dr. Bowie had turned over in
his sagacious mind when he said ? Never you
mind ; drive me home.? I only so far dwell upon
this because it is an indication of character, and
it marks the nice discrimination which Dr. Bowie
would deem it necessary to have between that
section of the padents who happened to have
wife, father, mother, brother, or sister, as the
case might be, and who, with the natural
sympathy which blood-relations have, would
be anxious to know how they were progress-
ing in the establishment from time to time- the
natural discrimination Dr. Bowie drew between
the position he had allowed those persons to bo
in, and the degree of atten'ion which would be
exhibited to the scores upon scores?not to say
hundreds?of poor friendless creatures, who had
no relations, perhaps, in this hemisphere to drop
in and inquire about them ; no one to send them
little presents of affection, to be eaten up, per-
haps, by Donohue, and stopped in transitu.
Dr. Bowie was keenly alive to protect himself in
all those instances in which inquiries might be
started. He took good care there should be no
appearance in the eyes of other, so as to render
him amenable to censure in those particular in-
stances. He_ would have, indeed, been dense?
suicidal of his own interests?utterly regardless
of bis own position, and the probability of
holding it even for a day, if he had not taken
uncommonly good care that, with respect to this
class of patients, who were habitually receiving
their relations as visitors, things should be
found passable and presentable. These are
not the sections of the establishment with
which we are dealing?these are not the facts
upon which those issues arise. These are not the
sections which constitute the entire management


of the establishment. These are not the sections
which constitute the entire experience of it
You must take the whole establishment. You
must look at all the particulars of the establish-
ment?the cleanliness ; the condition of the pa-
tients ; the condition of all the wards ; the day
management; the night management; the con-
duct of the attendants, the due and punctual
and conscientious discharge of their duties ; the
proper surveillance o�er them if they outraged
those duties, or neglected them, ?all these things
are to be looked into. If all these things are
satisfactory, of course it will be a very different
question. It great numbers of these things are
unsatisfactory, then these articles are perfectly
justifiable, and many more articles at the back
of them. With respect to the facts applicable to
the fourth plea, the substance of the issue has
been proved with respect to Mrs, Steele, and we
are entitled to your verdict upon that. Going
from that to the fifth plea, and to the issues
upon that and the sixth plea, I confess, gentle-
men, that, for the sake of Dr. Bowie, I could
almost have hoped?although I am counsel against
him?that a more creditable and even rational
explanation could be given as to the treat-
ment of that unfortunate man, Patrick Mullens,
than has been afforded you from the establishment
itself.
The Attorney-General,?On this point, I
have sent for the book, if my learned friend
wishes to make any use of it. [A book was here
handed by the Attorney-General to Mr. Michie.]
Mr. Michie ?Gentlemen,?l am not going to
pause in my observations to make a liitle inspec-
tion of that large volume, which my learned
friend has kindly favoured me with. I will leave
him to peruse that book for what it is worth ; and
as it is not very convenient for me to turn to any
particular entry in the middleof the observations I
am presenting to you on these issues, I shall pur-
sue my own course. I can only remark, with
respect to the tender just now made to me, that,
inasmuch as i his case has now been trying for
something exceeding a week, and inasmuch as
these issues have been before the plaintiff
for many weeks, so that he might give
them his most powerful and astute at
tention, with the assistance of counsel,
and that he also had the usual notices to
produce, I should very much indeed have
liked if Dr. Bowie had come forward at a much
earlier period of this case, instead of waiting
until every witness had been put into the box
before he went in himself. I regret that Dr.
Bowie was not put into the box at an earlier period
of the case, which would have allowed an op-
portunity for those documents to be placed before
me earlier, which might have enabled me to
ascertain how far there had been advice in this
particular case, how far this could have been
deemed satisfactory, or how far Dr. Bowie had
preserved any?if he has preserved any written
requisitions, important or unimportant, that he
had deemed it necessary to send in to the Go-
vernment as to the further means and appli-
ances he had required for this establishment,
and which he had not been furnished with; for
it would be seen, if one may judge from the open-
ing of counsel, he had very limbed means and
appliances, and could do no better than he
did do. He has done badly it is admitted.
and he has done so, it is alleged, because
he could not get all the means and appliances he
wanted. If here was anythin* that he said he
wished, I take it, it would have been seen on the
production of the requisitions. I asked Dr.
Bowie a question on this point, and I could have
called evidence about it if it had been necessary,
but the necessity did not arise. I called his
atteniion to a period as far back as 1857, a period
when M r. David Moore was in the position of
Minister of Lands and Works, and when, in that
position, he went to the Yarra Bend Asylum with
one of his subordinates, expressly for the purpose
of receiving instructions as to what should be put
upon the Estimates for the establishment; and I
asked Dr. Bowie?? If Mr. David Moore stated
that you said you had no requisition to make at
that lime, beyond some slight, addition to the
culinary arrangements, would you contradict
him ?? ? No, I will not. I don?t remember the
circumstance j? is Dr. Bowie?s answer. Had he
contradicted Mr. Moore, I could, with his
Honour?s permission, have called Mr. Moore
for the purpose of contradicting Dr. Bowie,
but the necessity did not arise. I would
have been rather more satisfied had we had
these written requisitions before us, to see what
they were?whether they were important or un-
important. It was his business to see if anything
was required, and to send in a requisition for it.
If the requisitions which he sent in were im-
portant, nothing was easier than for Dr. Bowie to
enumerate them one after another; but they can t
have been very important, when the principal one
that he can recollect giving was as to the neces-
sity of repairing a floor in a particular ward. He
can remember the particulars of all his patients,
but not the particulars of these requisitions.
Hence I think I am justified in the conclusion I
come to. You saw his demeanour. You saw
the consciousness that beamed over bis face
in that portion of the cross-examination which
took place yesterday with reference to Dr. M'Crea?s
suggestion to remove the asylum to a more
healthy site, and the introduction jof a new man
from England, acquainted with all the modern
means and appliances for the treatment of in-
sane people. To that question, Dr. Bowie an-
swered ? Yes.? When asked if it did not occur
to him that there was a probability of there
being ? new establishment?new man,? he said,
? It was suggested that I was to be the super-
intendent.? But it was also suggested that he
was not to be ; and I can very well understand
how Dr. Bowie, with all his old affections ?his
favourite peacocks, and all the rest of it?
desired to keep his position as long as he could.
I can very well understand the course a superin-
tendent would take under those circumstances.
I will now return to the subject I have left, for the
Attorney-General's interruption wi h his bulky
volume has led me into a longer digression than
I intended. I ask the jury to recall their minds
to the substance of the fifth and sixth pleas, and
the issues on them, premising that >be tifih issue,
dealing with the case of Patrick Mullens, is based
on the assumption?for, of course, the pleas were
drawn before the evidence was elicited?that the
injuries of which that man died occurred before
his reception into the asylum; while the sixth
plea was drawn upon the other assumption, viz.,
that the injuries were inflicted after that reception.


As, therefore, in my disquisition, the issues
arisingout of both those pleas must be considered
conjointly and together, it will be better for me
to treat them in that manner. Now, you must
bear in mind that the evidence as to the history
of this case?taking it for what it is worth?
differs from that given as to any other, because
it has so occurred that both the attendant who
received Mullens into the establishment, Mr.
Andrew Young, as also that important individual
with the uneuphonious name of Ketsch, under
whose auspices Mullens died, were both placed in
the box, bo'h of them declaring that there
were no marks whatsoever approaching in cha-
racter to those described by Mr. Rudall, Mullens,
you must bear in mind, was received into the
asylum on the 11th September, 1861, and re-
mained under the care?if I am not amsing the
word?of Andrew Young till the 27th of the
same month, and from that time till his death,
was supposed to be under the care and attention
of Mr. Hermann Ketsch. What did Young say ?
Throw back your memories for a day or two?
endeavour to minutely photograph to yourselves
the unpleasant imaee my learned friend cut while
he was examining Young?and you will be able to
carry away with you some notion of she dreadfulem-
barrassrnentin which he was when he found he was
not able to get out one groan or complaint
which might be suggested as having come from
Mullens when that unfortunate individual was put
into the ba'h. Well might my learned friend
say, ? I never knew of a bath so long,? for the
reason Mr. Fellows prolonged that particular por-
tion of the examination so long was, that having
read carefully through these very pleas, he knew
the importance of the issues arising out of them.
He knew how all-important that evidence was
to his client. With respect to that gentleman?s
attempted vindication of imputed negligence of
Mullens, I can hardly see the importance,
for reasons I will give presently. However,
it was very important to Mr. Fellows to show
that these injuries were inflicted on Mullens
before he came to the asylum, and it was a long
time before he could get the poor fellow out of
the bath and dressed. The questions came thick
and fast. ? How did he get in ?? ? Did he sep
in?? ?Yes,? said Young, ?he stepped in like
anv other man.? ?You rubbed him well??
? Yea ; he rubbed himself in front, and I rubbed
him behind. He was willing to be rubbed down,
and I was willing to rub him.? ?He made
no complaint?? asked my learned friend; and
the answer was, ? No, not at all." ?No scars ;
eh ?? ? No, only a dry scab on his elbow, and
the remains of a black eye.? Well, there was
nothing suggesting broken bones in that. Here
was Young in a position quite antagonistic to Dr.
Bowie?s interest. Dr. Bowie wanted broken
bones, and Andrew Young would not oblige him
?would not give him more than existed. Mullens
remains with Andrew Young till the 27th Sep-
tember, On that day, he is transferred to Ketsch,
and, at the end of nine weeks after his reception,
this unfortunate man dies. A post-mortem exami-
nation takes place, but what sort of examination ?
From one of the returns of in quests put in evidence,
we find the return, ? Died of dysentery and of
injuries received before the deceased was brought
into the asylum.? Is it, or is it not, the truth,
as alleged on the face of one of these articles.
that that finding was grossly, monstrously, I had
almost said revoltingly, in the face of the evi-
dence. You have the evidence before you of the
fact. You heard Young and Ketsch, who gave
you an account of the manner in which the poor
fellow was received and treated. No injuries
they say had been inflicted on him at all
when he was brought in. They say no less. They
dare say no less for their lives, because I say
there is evidence here, which, as between men,
had there been an unbiassed, thoroughly honesc
jury, would have warranted them in a finding
which would have caused twelve other honest
men to inquire into a grave question?if there was
not murder imputable to some one, although it
might be some one unknown. We have examined
Mr. Rudall and Mr. Thomas, and those who at-
tempt to dissent from them are, nevertheless,
bound to admit that their conclusions are the same
as those made on thousands upon thousands of
accredited instances of minute surgical examina-
tions at different periods after the infliction of
the injuries. The history of each case, the
notice of the minu f est particle of each minute
appearance as it arises, the general deductions
and conclusions, the accurate laying down
of principle, then going back to other dates,
and so on further?all these have been
done, it is not too much to say, in millions of
instances amongst the scientific men of all
countries. And then you hear Dr. Thomas in
evidence saying these words, ? I only used the
words fourteen days, because the coroner said,
do you think i he bone could have been broken
before fourteen days since ? And I replied, No
longer, certainly ; when, in point of fact, my
opinion is that that fracture had taken place a day
or two, not more than two or three days, before
dea h,? You heard him give his reasons. He said
the ends of the bone were jagged and rough,
that the fracture looked fresh, and that there
was an extravasation of blood. He said the
blood was extravasated, because it was significant;
for blood in a state of extravasation goes rapidly
into a lymph like substance, so that extravasated
blood is always a sign of a recent injury. You
know scientific images scarcely afford that in-
formation to the mind which is gained from more
familiar and stronger language. For instance,
if you say a man?s eye is black and blue, you
know he has been engaged in a recent pugilistic
contest?at all events, that a blow has been
given by a hard substance. Experience enables
you to come to that conclusion. In fact, it is
extravasated blood which is lying there ; and
therefore this blood had been lying in the im-
mediate region. If a little time is allowed to
elapse, there is soon no indication of blood at all;
and hence Dr, Thomas?s conclusion that only two
or three days had elapsed since the injury was
inflicted. This accounts for my strong expres-
sion, that if the coroner?s jury had done their
duty as men of reasonable sense?for every
killing not cut down to a minor offence is
murder ?there would have been a verdict against
some person or persons in the Yarra Bend un-
known. Then, gentlemen, take it that the
weight of evidence is overwhelming with respect
to that poor man. You must believe the plain-
tifl?s own witness, Andrew Young. You can t
reject that. The plaintiff can?t ask yp u
reject it. You must also believe the plaintiff �


own witness Ketsch, as far as you are able.
How do we get the injury accounted for?
Do you believe a man with three broken ribs could
get into a bath, rub himself well, be rubbed down
well, and yet make no complaint ? Do you
believe that that man could go on like this for
many days, and yet not complain ? It he had
three broken ribs when he was received into the
asylum, what sort of examination could have been
made on him by Dr. Bowie ? At all events it was
a pretty rough mode of doing it. He is received.
You take him into your ward ; you bathe him ;
you don't see that any injury is done;
and then you bag him. (Laughter.) He
remains under Young so many days, then
he is taken to another ward, and all the time
there is apparently no examination made. Dr.
Bowie, in evidence, never said that he had ex-
amined Mullens once. Suppose Mullens had
been taken to an hospital, or any other place, is
it likely that for nine weeks he would have lain
there without his broken bones being known, if
he had been properly attended to? It is actually
more charitable to Dr. Bowie to say that Mullens
had no broken bones to detect ?to agree with the
scientific reasons given by Dr. Thomas and Mr.
Rudall why the bones were not broken before ;
and, therefore, lamentable doubts beset my mind
as to the story of Mullens's uniformly kind 1 reat-
ment, and how far it is true. I take leave to
doubt the evidence, therefore, and urge that
either under one plea or the other, we are entitled
to your verdict. It would be monstrous if the poor-
est man?if the most miserable, humblest human
being? were received into this establishment, which
every nobbier that poor man drank helped to pay
for, and did not meet with the same conscien-
tious attention from Dr. Bowie as the man whose
rich relations could pay to place him there. It
was rnons?rous that this poor unfortunate man
should be taken to this place, rap-dly passed to
death, and then his history to be over, and no
more to be heard of him. If a man had a dog
that he respected he could give a more minute
and particular account of his treatment than you
have had of this man who was treated as
a lunatic. And yet, forsooth, we are to be
told that these charges brought against the mal-
administration of this establishment, are baseless,
and without the shadow of foundation. I think
I have said enough about this man?s case to jus-
tify me in passing now to the next plea; but
before quite leaving the subject entirely in your
hands, I will just read to you a few passages from
the evidence of Mr. Rudall, respecting the post-
mortem examination. [The learned gentleman read
The Argus report of the evidence given by Mr.
Rudall in this case, and proceeded]lt seems to
me that I may without impropriety refer to one
subject, because no doubt the observation was
originally elicited by his Honour, I have been
attending very particularly to Mr. Rudall?s evi-
dence, and I do think that it requires consi-
derable ingenuity to imagine any other supposi-
tion than that which occurred to me after a pro-
longed study of the case, which has been long
disposed of in my mind, and which I have en-
deavoured to place properly in yours. His
Honour asked one of the attendants whether
the unfortunate Mullens slept in a bedstead or
on the floor. The answer was, ?On the floor,?
and had the answer been other than that, we
should have felt it in the highest degree impro-
bable that, in falling out of bed, he should have
broken three ribs, and got such contusions on his
thighs as to cause an abscess to form on each.
We are, however, net left alone in such a conc.u-
sion ; for the attendants are compelled to admit
that there was a mattrass on the floor, and how
and by what human ingenuity it could be sug-
gested -that the ribs were broken in the way
communicated to us, I am at a loss to say.
There is but one other conclusion, the grounds
for which are not over obvious, from the reasons
confided to us. It can?t be confided to us?it
must ever remain a mystery, I suppose, as to how
Mullens received these injuries. An inquest has
been held on him?such an inquest as you have
had an account of. Take one as a sample of the
bulk. Here are a lot of papers rela?ing to various
inques?s, and the findings in them have been put
in evidence. I find here that an inquest was
held on the body of one Alfred Freeman ;
and I look upon the findings of juries thus
constituted as farcical. It is admitted by Dr.
Bowie how they were impannelled, and so little
can he say for them, that in the witness-box he
is compelled to s*y that he thinks them not quite
proper as means of inquiry. He is compelled to
admit that, because no human mind that claims
to be rational can say that juries constituted
sometimes mainly of the attendants of the
deceased, can properly inquire into the cause of
death of an inmate of the asylum, when they
might have committed the assault of which the
man died ? Men who frequently?as has been
given in evidence here?have been fined by Mr.
Hackett, at the police-court, for inflicting per-
sonal injuries on a patient, and who decide on
their own acts and acquit themselves. These
are the juries who for years and years have
conducted these inquiries long after those
suburbs had become comparatively populous ;
and why, I ask, did not the reforma-
tion take place years and years ago ?
Why? The answer that alone can present itself
to us, is that it is more convenient, no doubt, to
the comfortable discharge of the business of the
asylum to have these things as snug family ar-
rangements as possible amongst the attendants
themselves, otherwise this kind of an abuse of
an inquiry could not have had so long a life.
You are, in this civil inquiry, not to inquire as
to who has, or may have, deprived this unfortu-
nate man, Patrick Mullens, of his life; but you
are, between the plaintiff and defendant, to
weigh the evidence, to see where it preponderates,
and to say whether or not, in your opinion, (he
balance of the evidence shows that the injuries
which must have been strongly conducive 10 the
death of that unfortunate man were inflicted after
he entered the establishment or before. Un-
less I very much misapprehend the weight
or effect of the evidence, I think there
can hardly be the possibility of two opinions
on that point, so overwhelming is the evi-
dence that the injuries were inflicted after-
wards. If that be so, what kind of jurisdiction
over the proper watching of a person in that
position could there have been, when such a
monstrous result has taken place ? I dismiss,
then, gentlemen, that case ; and go on to the
subject-matter of the seventh plea. Most of the
evidence I have already commented on as bearing


on the second and third pleas, relating: to Dr.
Yates Carr, also applies to the seventh plea.
You will remember the very circumstantial and
particular account which Dr. Carr gave ; and
you will bear in mind what Coates said?and he
gave his evidence very fairly on this point?
that, from the power which the attendants had,
a merciful attendant could be merciful, a cruel
and bad tempered attendant could be the con-
trary. It is precisely, gentlemen, from these
caprices of temper or disposition in the attendants
that the patients are to be protected by the
superintendent. You would never imagine but
that a patient who has been taken into an es-
tablishment of this kind is supposed to
be projected by the superintendent, who is
well paid for discharging the duties of su-
perintendent. He had no right to delega eto
subordina es anything of the discretion, or any-
thing of the power to violate or abuse their sub-
ordinate authority for a moment. He must take
all possible precautions for the protection of those
who are placed under his charge. You find, how-
ever, that these precautions have merely con-
sisted of going through these formal rounds.
Coates said that the attendants were perfectly
aware when he was coming ; that they were
ready waiting for him, and that he had heard
them say, ? I wish the old fellow would be quick,
I want to be off to Melbourne.? The attendants
were posted there, waiting for his arrival; and it
was clear that the visits were merely of a formal
character. Although Dr. Bowie sometimes made
notes in a note-book, sometimes in a memoran-
dum-book, and sometimes on a bit of paper, he
did not examine the patients?he did not go up
to them, and ask them to put out their tongues,
and feel their pulses, as a medical man ought to
do. Dr. Bowie, as the principal of this estab-
lishment, must be held responsible for the
proper management of it. If he be too
old for this post, let him give way to
younger, abler, more vigilant men; but let
him not be in the position of neglecting those
high duties which, while he holds the position of
superintendent of this establishment, he must
discharge. If duties are neglected by any over
whom he has authority, he must be held re-
sponsible for that neglect, and wherever mis-
management occurs in the institution, of what-
ever character it may be, he must be held
responsible for it. The evidence of the seventh
plea as to Dr. Yates Carr is proved, not merely
by himself, but by Coates, by Wainwright, and
by o hers. I hardly know what is going to be
said about Wainwright. At first he was allowed
to resign, next he was told to go, and then, again,
the Attorney- General said yesterday that he was
not told to go.
The Attorney-General.? l said I made no
insinuation as to the man?s character. He was
not sent away for any moral offence.
Mr. Michib. ?Then Wainwright?s character
must stand entirely unsullied. There is no reflec-
tion upon his moral character. But there is this
reflection upon his intellectual character? his
comparative fitness, by the side of Dr, Bowie,
for being a fitting judge as to what is proper in
an asylum of this description, Wainwrieht had
had ten years of observation under the most
skilful management at that time, at Bethlehem
Hospiial. Wainwright says that such a state
of things as he witnessed at Yarra Bend would
not have been tolerated there for one moment.
He very naturally said afterwards, in that little
interview with my friend, Mr. Fellows, afterwards
alluded to, that when he was asked by Coates how
the things were going on over the way, he replied,
? Oh, tolerably welland that Dr. Bowie was
fitter to be an inmate of the asylum than to be
the manager of it. That was, no doubt, the
genuine and honest opinion of Wainwright. Bu f ,
he was asked, ? Why did you not report upon the
other attendants ?? ? Why,? said Wainwright,
? I did not like in a very few days to be reporting
upon my fellow-attendants, but I called the
attention of the attendants to these things.? He
said that he saw O?Donohue was repeatedly
drunk. Dr. Bowie admits this. He says that
O?Donohue was an excellent attendant, but that
be was addicted to the vice of drunkenness.
O?Donohue was one of the attendants, and he had
this unfortunate weakness. ?If one of the attend-
ants had a weakness for the medical comforts of
the patients had he the means of getting them ??
?Yes,? said Dr. Bowie, ?if he were mean
enough.? Here was O?Donohue, who was ad-
mitted to be a drunkard, and whom Wainwright
stated he had seen drink the wine of five or six
patients at once, kept in the establishment by Dr.
Bowie, and kept fo be the carrier and dispenser of
the medical comforts to the patients of his ward I
Are you to reject Wainwright?s evidence? His
character is not reflected upon; he gives a
straightforward account of what he wimessed ;
he was ten years in the Second Regiment
of Life Guards ; he brings an excellent
character from his regiment, and, as I
observed, upon the certificate there is a distin-
guishing mark of good conduct; he goes with a
good character from Dr. Bowie, as having always
behaved with propriety; his three years? pension
he did not ask for, because he had forfeited it by
asking for his discharge; he comes and gives
you his version of what he witnessed. And are
you to be asked by the learned Attorney-General
to say that Wainwright has committed a tissue of
perjuries?that he has falsified this establishment
without any adequate motive ? He was not a dis-
carded servant. I have heard it urged by counsel,
?Oh, he is a discarded servant : you can?t believe
him.? There is no doubt a discarded servant may
have an animus against the institution from which
he is discharged, and may state what is not the fact
about i*. I have yet to learn that that is neces-
sarily the case ; but we are not embarrassed by
that consideration here. Wainwright was not a
discarded servant; he retired of bis own
accord, with a good character from Dr.
Bowie, and after he left the institution Dr.
Bowie gave him work to do in his capacity
as a tradesman. I ask you, therefore, to receive
Wainwrighi?s version as being from the beginning
to the end an account which a veracious man
gives you of all he witnessed?of what he saw
there, not merely so far as it applies to these
issues because his evidence applies to these, but
to those o her issues to which you find the other
evidence applies, and to which I may find again
occasion to recur. The eighth plea refers to the
case of the man Fitzgerald, a patient, who was
proved to be kept at night in a canvas bag,
fastened at the bottom. You heard the evi-
dence as to the filthy condition in which he was


found, and I dare say you will never be able to
forget it. The ninth plea is one which deals
with those allegations which occur in the course
of the articles of which the plaintiff has com-
plained?those allegations that refer to the
plaintiff?s duty to take care of the patients, and
see them kept clean, so that the sores and ulcers,
&0., with which they were afflicted might be
properly attended to. It is equally complained
of that all this is libellous, without foundation
and without justification. There is no justifica-
tion, because i is untrue, it is said. How stands
the evidence upon this point ? I say it is rather
remarkable, bearing in mind the adverse cir-
cumstances under which my client must fight
the plaintiff in a position of this kind. It is only
where you can get two occasional instances
which stand as very good samples of the bulk, it
is only by accident ?such as people communicating
their experiences to the defendant, or to a com-
mittee?that we are able to elicit anything that
takes place within the precincts of the esta-
blishment ; because all are concerned in hushing
up anything that may be objectionable?from the
superintendent paramount down to the meanest
subordinate ; so that the difficulty is peculiar in
getting up evidence as to what is the amount of
effective care on the part of the plaintiff, with
respect to the possibility of his seeing that the
sores and ulcers were properly managed. I will
read a portion of the evidence of Dr. Whitten-
bury ? I visited the Yarra Bend Asylum on
one occasion. I went to see a connexion of mine,
named Wilmot. Tnis was at the commencement
of 1859. I have spent many years of my life
in public institutions, and I could not compare
the Yarra Bend Asylum with these institutions
with respect to cleanliness. It was very dirty. I
was formerly connected with the Geelong Hos-
pital. The uncleanliness which I noticed at the
Yarra Bend Asylum was general rather than
special. I will mention one particular circum-
stance. Having heard that there were patients
under restraint at Yarra Bend, and not having
seen anything of the kind, I asked Dr, Bowie if
he would show me some patients under restraint.
He said, ? Oh, yes; I will show you several.?
He showed me one ease. I believe the patient
was a man named M'Donald ?a tall powerful
man. I believe he had not been attended to for
several days. At all events, Dr. Bowie said-
calling to some of the keepers??We had better
attend to this case now; Dr. Whittenbury wants
to see it.? At a given signal, the bolts were shot,
and four attendants sprang into the cell. Two of
the men seized the patient by the neck and
shoulders, and the others seized him by the legs.
The four men then threw him upon the ground,
and held him there, while a fifth attendant re-
moved some straw and dirty things out of the
cell. This occurred about four or five o'clock in
the evening. The cell was very dirty. The at-
tendant who took the straw away afterwards
returned with some clean sheets and a blanket
or rug. The patient was naked, with the ex-
oeption of having on what is called a lunatic or
skeleton jacket, which fastened the upper por-
tion of the arms to the breast. To effect their
escape from the cell, the attendants bound the
patient?s legs and feet together, and then rushed
out, and bolted the door after them. The
lunatic?s strength was so great that he imme-
diately jumped up, and almost instantaneously
burst his bonds asunder, and sprang at the
grating of the cell. I had never seen such a
case in my life before, and was quite shocked.?
You will bear in mind that Dr. Whittenbury fixes
the time at about four or five o?clock in the
afternoon. Dr. Bowie said, ? We will attend to
this case now.? This shows that but for the
lucky accident?if there be any luck to poor
M?Donald at all- -of Dr. Whittenbury wishing to
see a case of restraint, poor M'Donald would not
have been looked to, and his foul and filthy straw
would not have been changed. It was a mere
accident. Because Dr. Whittenbury required to
see a sample of this class of patients. Dr. Bowie
said to the attendants, ? We will attend to this
case now.? They say, in effect, ? Wnile we are
exhibiting the animal, we might as well kill two
birds with one stone, and go for some fresh
straw.? This is the manner in which it seems to
have been done. The straw was foul and filthy,
and the uncleanness was so revolting, that well
might Dr. Whittenburv say he was quite
shocked. It had been said, with great triumph,
? But Dr. Whittenbury says there was a grating.
There is no grating; it was merely an opening,? I
suppose because there was no grating, Dr, Whitten-
bury was not there at all ? It was said tbe cell could
not be dark. A day or two before a question was
as to whether, in the gloom of the cell, the bark
powder might have been mistaken for dirt. It
would seem from this, however, that the cell was
dark. Dr. Whittenbury had said that the patient
sprang up at the grating, or what be supposed to
be the grating ; but that is really not the mate-
rial point. The question is, was he there ? I
have heard, gentlemen, that truth consists where
different persons tell different stories in substan-
tial agreement with circumstantial variation, and
you would always suspect the account of a man
who undertook to be most positive with the
utmost possible minutiae. It is not whether
Dr. Whittenbury mistook a small opening for
a grating, but whether he was there. I am almost
afraid, in justice to Dr. Whittenbury, to put this
supposition to you, but it seems to be necessary
from the obliviousness of Dr. Bowie?do you
believe it to be possible that Dr. Whittenbury
committed wilful and corrupt perjury in
the account he gave of what he wit-
nessed on that occasion? You do not. It
is not possible, gentlemen. What motive can he
have, or what motive could any man have in
that position, or in any position, in malign-
ing this institution ? I say, therefore, that Dr.
Whittenbury must be taken as giving us precisely
all the particulars of what he actually witnessed,
and which, although Dr. Bowie does not remem-
ber it, he would not venture to deny. He thinks
he recollects the gentleman being there?he
thinks he saw him there?but he has forgotten
th s altogether. If he has forgotten that altoge-
ther, he can only have forgotten it because it must
be so familiar a manif-station to him of what
took place in the establishment that it did not
produce that impression on his mind that it did
on Dr. Whittenbury?s. If Dr. Bowie did not re-
member it, the reason must have been because it
was part of his daily and hourly experience to
witness such things, which could not be wit-
nessed by Dr. Whittenbury, or any other
man unaccustomed to such atrocities, with-


out producing a profound impression on
his mind. No creature bearing ?the human
form Divine? should be subjected, under
any circumstances whatever, to such a revolting
position as that in which i his man was placed.
When you find, also, that Dr. Bowie is
equally oblivious with respect to the interview
which Dr. Barry describes, it confirms me in the
impression that it is merely part of Dr.
Bowie?s ordinary experience. Dr. Bowie does
not remember anything with respect to
what Dr. Barry described in reference to
the woman who complained of having had her
hair cut off for breaking a pane of glass. Dr.
Barry also speaks about the general filth which
he observed at that time. Do you believe that
Dr, Barry has concocted a story ? Do you believe
that Dr. Birry has perjured himself? Do you
believe Dr. Whittenbury has perjured himself?
When you find respectable witness af er re-
spectable witness speaking in this manner as to
the filthiness of portions of this establishment;
as to these dens from which by accidents of this
description the poor lunatics are for a moment
citizens?is it not too much for the plaintiff to
come here to this court, and ask you to find that
these observations?which, after all, are very little
more than an echo of the evidence taken before
the Parliamentary Committee?that these observa-
tions in these articles are wholly without founda-
tion? Dr, Whittenbury also observes, with respect
to the asylum at Quebec, that the patients there
looked cheerful, but that, at Yarra Bend, every-
body locked miserable. Then again, gentlemen,
with respect to the evidence as to lunatics trying
to escape, Dr. Bowie is asked if, in other esta-
blishments, the cases of patients trying to effect
their escape are not exceedingly rare ? He says,
? I have read of this, but I don?t believe it.? He
has had so many escape from his own particular
protection, that he can?t believe a lunatic asylum
can be made, not merely endurable, but pleasant
to those who are inmates of it. Of the particulars
as to the ninth plea, with respect to the alleged
incapabili y of attending to the sores and ulcers,
you remember what Dr. M/Crea said, with re-
spect to his observations of A. Yicardi and
other patients. I think you will be inclined
to believe that Dr. M'Crea did not over-
colour his testimony in that respect. True,
Mr. Fellows confronts him with certain certificates
which he had given from time to time as to
what he observed in the asylum ; but that must
be taken together with Dr. M'Grea?s explanation,
that the visi ors desired to act in conjunction
with Dr. Bowie, thao they wished to co-
operate with him, and that they were ad-
verse to condemnations of him if they could
be avoided. You can see Dr. M'Grea partly
suggesting to Dr. Bowie, and partly re-
monstrating with him, for the first suggestion
about the knives and forks which were at one
time only given to six or seven per cent, of the
patients, and were afterwards extended to fifty
per cent., wi h no worse effects than existed when
they were confined to six or seven per cent. You
see Dr. Bowie resisting all these innovations with
the characteristic prejudices of a comparatively
uninformed mind with respect to the treatment of
this class of disease -adhering rigidly, un-
flinchingly, uncompromisingly, to the old, ex-
ploded, monstrous, and revolting appliances
of the old system, which had almost become
obsolete even in the worst asylums?adhering
to all these, and not to be dislodged from
them. With these observations I will leave
the account Dr. M'Crea gives you with respect
to these issues as being one which you may
implicitly rely on. In addition to that we have
the account of the witness Houghman, and also
the evidence of Goates. 1 have not been able to
understand how the other side propose to present
Coates here. At one time they were disposed to
make a lunatic of him; at another he is not a
lunatic. They introduce a witness who described
him in a way which was intended to be very
facetious and very pointed, but which I think
was very pointless, as an ?alarming gardener.?
I believe he looked after the garden in his
own way ; and I believe this is a natural charac-
teristic of gardeners who are devoted and en-
thusiastic in their particular pursuit. Sometimes
they almost growl and look gloomy if their own
employer ventuies to interfere too much with
their handiwork, and destroy some of their little
achievements in gardening, or interfere with them.
But Dr. Bowie admitted that this man was at
large, and even that he was taken to be the head
of the other gardeners?that he was put in
authority over them, that he was let out into the
garden, and treated on all hands as a sane
person, and apparently considered by every one
as such. It appeared that he was anything but a
violent man. The learned counsel for the plaintiff
was unable to get out of any of the witnesses?
yes, there was one who said that he had a violent
temper?but the uniform tes imony of everybody
else was, that he was a quiet man, not in any-
body?s way, and that he went about the place by
himself, and making himself evidently useful to
Dr. Bowie. Goa es?s expressions of disgust at Dr.
Bowie afterwards were most natural. He says,
? 1 wanted a little freedom in the matter. I
wanted the patiems to have a few green vegetables
?onions, lettuces, and such little things of that
sort, as I knew they liked. I had laid out the
grounds, and 1 wanted to distribute these things
amongst the patients; but Dr. Bowie would not
allow me.? These vegetables were not all sent to
Dr. Bowie?s own friends, though Dr. Bowie said
in the witness-box that he did make presents of
such things. No ; they were sent to the pigs
and so on, and the rest were preserved for seed,
of course to Coates?s disgust. Was that any
reason why Goates?who gave a most coherent
and natural account of the affair?was to be dis-
trusted, much less disbelieved? Gan the jury
believe that Goates invented any portion of his
story ?that he has been telling a tissue of lies ?
He did certainly return to Dr. Bowie what was,
in bis mind, an equivalent for his own treatment.
In his literal sta'ement of the bugs he found it
was singular that he should quote exactly Dr,
Bowie?s remonstrance about them, Coates was
so disgusted with the filth of the place, with the
bad superintendence of a portion of that establish-
ment which was under Dr. Bowie?s care, and is still,
that he presented him with the extraordinary
contribution of a collection of these small ani-
mals. You can almost imagine the thing to
yourself - Dr. Bowie struck almost of a heap.
He was enraged. He says?? You did not get
those together in a straightforward way.?
(Laughter.) Dr. Bowie in his evidence admitted


that. He said, "I did say that to him.? ?But
what did you mean by that ?? I said. ? I meant
that he had employed agems to collect them,?
was his reply. Gentlemen, whether he employed
agents to collect them or not?whatever Coates
did personally, it is quite clear to my mind that
the bugs were there. I said to Dr. Bowie,
? Come now?did he not give you another lot
the morning after?? tasked if Coates did not
come up to him with more bugs, till at last the
door was banged in his face, and Coates, bugs
and all, were shut out. Dr. Bowie does not deny
this; but you see, he says he does not remember
it. Why ? Because bugs were just as familiar to
him as anything else. They were a part of
his daily and hourly experience, and it was
most natural that he should have forgotten it.
At last, you see, he was annoyed about it.
? Couldn?t Coates let those bugs take their own
natural course." He would hink, and be ex-
terminated by what he?Dr, Bowie?would
consider legitimate means, each man acting for
himself. (Laughter.) Dr. Bowie might very
naturally think, ? Why, this confounded fellow
devotes himself to this pursuit. It will get
talked about." So he got displeased. He thought,
perhaps, what a liberty Coates took in destroying
these bugs. So, as Coates says, ? I was put
first into H ward, and then into P ward.? Though
Dr. Bowie said he did not imprison him for that,
he did not say, at the same time, that poor
Coates was not some time kept in those wards.
He did not tell you why Coates was at large for
many months, and when he got disgusted, and
said, ? I?ll work no more. I've made your garden
what it is, and now I have done so 1 think I
ought to be allowed some little privileges, to make
myself agreeable as head gardener, and present
lettuces and oher little things to the patients -
so you'll get no more work out of Coates??he
did not say why the poor fellow was locked up.
1 can easily imagine a sensitive man giving utter-
ance to expressions of disgust, at such selfishness.
Coates has given you an account so circumstan-
tial and so reasonable that it is most unjust to him
to say he invented all these things, or that he has
coloured them too highly. Then there are the
anatomical preparations?if they were not skulls,
toey were parts of skulls. Coates is not an ana-
tomist or a surgeon, to know all about them; but
he has the instinctive horror which most people
have at seeing any portions of the human form
in their way. As Coates says, it is a most uncom-
fortable thing to come upon these articles. Take
this in connexion with what Dr. Bowie says
about his getting together portions of skulls to
send to the Museum, if they had any room for
little curiosities of that kind, and that it might
he that some of those skulls were left lying
about. Thus Coates's story was more than possible,
and a m�n must have a very powerful imagina-
tion to invent it. Put human brains in
Pannikins! Quite incredible ! But I suppose
human brains may have been in pannikins. Men
*ho go about inventing stories don?t make them
Preposterous. When people are coining out ot
their imagination stories that other people are
to believe, they would put in probable circum-
atanees rather than improbable. So that matier
,f hich in fact came out in Wainwright?s evidence
no doubt equally correct. You remember,
t�o, Dr. Bowie?s saying he could not keep the
bugs down in the wooden building, but yet, when
the lunatics themselves tried, they succeeded to a
considerable exteut. So it seems that Dr. Bowie
never took any new course till it was forced upon
him. Reform after reform were forced upon an
unwilling agent, and he only made the amend-
ments when he could hardly help himself. These
are all the observations I ihink necessary to
make to the 9th plea. Take now the 10th plea,
which alleges negligence on the part of the plain-
tiff. You remember the evidence of Murson, the
subcontractor, who was empl< yed in April, 1851,
to paint and glaze the place. [The learned counsel
then read several long extracts from M arson?s
evidence, respecting that person having seen
much filth and excrement about ihe place, the
violent patient beating a quiet one with a stone,
the neglect of the at'endants and their refusal
to in erf ere, and the fact that some of the violent
lunatics were permitted to have axes. He then
proceeded]:?This is what one person accident-
ally saw, and that was at a period when it was
represented,?and, so far, accurately repre-
sented?that by degrees the institution was wet-
ting better than it was, though very far inferior
to what it ought to be. Here was Mr. Murson?s
description of the state of things in 1861. Here
is a wi ness who tells you that he tried to find
the attendants, and yet never could succeed.
On the occasion when he saw patients beating
each other, and one striking another on the
head with a stone, where were the attendants?
A teudant after attendant have been called
before you; they say they did their duty;
but you only get a very few called, and
some whom the plaintiff omitted to call
were those who I think might have been called,
whose names were used by the witnesses for the
defendant. Therefore, when you find Murson
giving you this account of what he witnessed,
you must believe him, or else believe that, he and
all i he other witnesses who have spoken of the
filthy state of things at that period, and even
anterior to it, have all lied. Take also the acci-
dent! discoveries made by Dr. Whittenbury and
Dr. Barry, and I think you can have little diffi-
ccl.y in deciding ihat abundant charges have
been made out of want of proper attendance?
in one word, of negligence of attendants, and
the want of a proper performance of their
d>*?,ies. Then the eleventh plea goes on to refer
to ?he improper dis ribu ion of food, and you
heard all tha. the witnesses have had to sav upon
th- subject. I am sorry that Mr. O?ParrelJ,
wen in the box, should, in his natural interest
for a man who takes the position of his client,
have thought fit to go as far as he did
in respect to his observations on Dr.
Pueh?s evidence, because it was dealing
irrationally with inquiries of this kind to
say that, Dr. Pugh had observed an exceptional
state of things. Exceptional to what ? to what
other visiiors observed or not ? I think Dr.
Pugh went the right way to work. Dr. Bowie
offered io attend him, but he preferred to go
alone. Perhaps he felt that the lunatics, even
during their lucid intervals, might ftel some con-
straint in Dr. Bowie?s presence?jest as pupils
before their schoolmaster or usher?as compared
with their state of mind when relieved of it So
Dr. Pugh thought hat by examining for himself,
bis experience would be altogether unqualified by


any possible influence Dr. Bowie?s presence might
occasion. You remember what he said. He said,
? I said to the attendants, now please to lay out
all the things exactly as you do every day.? If I
have not given you the exact words I have given
you the equivalent. They proceeded then to do
what he asked of them, and what picture does he
draw of the place? His report was that the
variation in the distribution of food was almost
ridiculous; some got a very little, and some a
great deal. Some of the patients had to go out
of the diningroom, and every door step was oc-
cupied by patients sitting down. Now, I appre-
hend that although it might be their own sweet
wills that led them to do this, yet if there
were comfortable seats at table, and plenty of
room, it would be part of the curative process to
establish a regularity of habit which would coun-
teract the effects of their desultory life. Indeed,
you can have very little doubt that, if there were
the means and appliances, the proper tables and
chairs, the patients would have sat down. Now,
Dr. Pugh tells you that the place reminded
him more of what he had witnessed already
under the convict regime in Tasmania than
a lunatic asylum in the colony of Victoria,
and that the whole state of things which he saw
was entirely unsatisfactory, and therefore you
will at once reject Mr, O?Farrell?s alernative.
Now, with respect to the improper distribution
of food, there is abundance of other evidence.
It is quite clear to me that under either dietary
scale, so far as I could weigh the evidence, there
was enough, and that the complaints of a defi-
ciency of food simply arose from carelessness,
the distribution being in the hands of the atten-
dants, and not properly looked after. And yet
the attendants there are in far larger proportion
than are required in other establishments of the
kind ; for, as far as I could follow the observa'ions
made as to the deficiency of means and appliances,
both by the attendants themselves and by Dr.
Bowie?s evidence, it seemed that though 'he
ordinary number of attendants in such establish-
ments at home was one attendant to seventeen
patients, yet in the Yarra Bend there was one
attendant to only eleven pa ients, many of
these being merely transitory, rapidly dis-
posed of, and soon discharged. Thus, then,
I think we have made out these pleas
with subs?an tial and satisfactory proof from
various witnesses. 8t 11 I suppose the learned
counsel for the plaintiff will soon return to the
charge, that the means and appliances provided
were not such as Dr. Bowie ought to have had.
But we have seen already how the matter stands.
We have seen how Dr. Bowie flinches from say-
ing that in 1857, when Mr. D. Moor was in office,
he wanted little more than an addition to the
cooking appliances, but you have to deal with the
probabilities of the case Do you suppose it
probable that in Y-ctoria, wherefrom year to year,
and under one Government and another, there
never was a time when there was not exhibited
every possible disposition to vote largely and
liberally, not to say lavishly, for every possible
purpose connec ed with institutions like this ;
that if any additional requirements to this
establishment had been asked for, that the
request would have been unattended to ? No. I
say it is monstrous to conclude hat that would
have been the result. I say, that if representa-
tions were made at all they must have been made
by word of mouth, and in so slipshod a manner,
that they scarcely amounted to representations
at all. If there had been a point to make on
this, I am sure Dr. Bowie would have given
you chapter and verse, the exact date when
the requisitions were sent in, when they were
complied with and when not. Even if these re-
quisitions were clearly made out, there is no
excuse for Dr. Bowie, because it was his duty,
if he had not the proper means and appliances,
to say?? I can?t, as a man professing to have a
conscience and a heart in my bosom- I can?t?l
will not?undertake these duties with deficient
means and appliances. If I can?t protect the
inma es of this establishment, keep them clean,
preserve them from filth and vermin, and see
them properly lodged, I will surrender my
charge, unless you enable me to do my duty
with satisfaction to myself and to my employers.?
That course a man of fastidious conscience
would have pursued; but I find neither one
course pursued nor the other. The only requisi-
tions brought out in evidence are dimly and
obscurely alluded to by Dr. Bowie, and that is
all the information we have about it. How does
the case stand now? We have made for our
justification a number of pleas, which have
had to be proved, because a number of
allegations have been made and adopted
in these articles complained of. These allegations
we have endeavoured to prove, and I think we
have proved them by a large and overwhelming
body of testimony, calling for specific evidence to
meet them. These charges have not been met.
Is it enough to call a number of witnesses to say,
? I visited the asylum at such and such a time,
and I was satisfied after seeing all that Dr. Bowie
showed me ?? Avain, ? I visited the place at
such and such a time, and everything shown to
me <>y Dr. Bowie was quite clean.? So would
you and I have said if we had gone when Dr.
Whittenbury wen there, and left Dr. Bowie to
show us just what was expedient to him, for it
was only when Dr. Whittenbury professed a de-
sire to see more, that he had revealed to him the
outside of that which was only a sample of what
was festering within. This was the sort of ma-
nagement on which my client commented, and if
there be one function of the press more import-
ant than another, it is exercised when it can, by
legitimate inquiries, ferret out cases of this kind,
affecting the happiness of so large a portion of
our fellow beings. It it has one duty more
sacred than ano'her, it is to comment,
as The Argus has commented, upon this.
Would they have done their duty to the com-
munity if they had not made hese observations,
warranted by facts, which are complained of here.
Gentlemen, it is more important that the press
should see more than is on the surface. We get
familiar with these atrocities We read of them
from day to day. We read of enormities com-
mitted in our peculiarly constituted community
so often, that at last we become almost blind?
our sjmpathies are blunted; but we must
feel how terrific these things are when occa-
sionally they are revealed to us. And if
anything is more important than another to
proteo us from possible declension, it is that
when we have the opportunity, we should see
that the humblest among us receives rigorous


justice?that when the poorest among us comes
into an asylum like this, in which he is entitled
to receive every possible attention, that he
does receive it. This we must do, if we do
not wish to see ourselves most properly
and justly reflected upon for our gross neg-
ligence in the guardianship of an institution
like this, by allowing these things to pass
without censure when they arise for censure.
Do you not remember what Dr. Crook told us
when he said that in Tasmania the proportion of
cures in lunacy cases was seven y per cent.,
while in this asylum it is only thirty per cent ?
Good God, gentlemen, what are we to make of
this? Here is a difference of forty per cent, to
be accounted for. A mere fact in statistics, it is
true, but how is the case with the two men,
Mullens and Fitzgerald?unfortunate wretches?
young men who left their parent country and
arrived on these golden shores, expec ing far
different results, and have fallen victims in this
most wretched Golgotha ? There is forty per
cent, to be accounted for, and I ask Dr. Bowie if,
in point of fact, a large proportion of the cases
which come in o bis establishment are not those
of persons addicted to intemperance?cases of
comparatively an evanescent, character, soon
treated and soon discharged ? Yet these pass into
his list of cures, and constitute part of the thirty
percent, against the seventy per cent, of Tasmania.
Surely a difference of forty per cent, ought to be
satisfactorily accounted for. That fact is trumpet-
tongued. It is a great fact behind which a vast
number of a'roci'ies must have occurred?atro-
cities to miserable wretches rapidly passing into
a state like that of wild animals, till they
leave their tormentors never to rise again.
Houghton digs their grave, individual
washes the body, an instant and it is all over.
The tragedy, gentlemen, of these facts is else-
where. Many an old father or mother can guess,
perhaps?getting a glimpse into these_ matters
from inquiries of this kind?that in some
wretched place, far away in Australia, some poor
son or daughter is lost, never more heard of, and
probably last seen or known of there. If the press
ever did its duty, it did it in ferretting out
monstrous abuses of this character; and now I
leave you to do yours.
At the conclusion of Mr. Michie?s address,
which occupied nearly three hours in delivery,
there was immense cheering by ihe spectators In
the galleries. The officers of the court, of course,
promptly suppressed a the applause ; and the Chief
Justice ordered one of the parties who had ap-
plauded to be brought before him. A man named
Dunn was brought down from one of the galleries
by a police officer; and
The Chief Justice, addressing the man,
asked the reason of his improper and indecent
behaviour. It was absolutely necessary, said the
learned judge, that proper order and decorum
should be preserved. The Court was not a public
house, nor a playhouse; but a place in which
questions affecting men?s lives and properties had
to be tried, and it was absolutely necessary that
there should be no such unseemly exhibitions as
that which had taken place.
Dunn expressed his sorrow that he had trans-
greased the rules of the Court; but stated that
he had been carried away in a moment of tern-
porary excitement. He promised not to trans-
gress again.
The Chief Justice told Dunn that he had in-
tended to commit him to gaol, but after this
apology he would discharge him.
The man was then liberated.
The Attorney General asked his Honour
to adjourn the Court now, as it was too late for
him {the A torney General) to commence his
address to the jury that day.
The Chief Justice acquiesced in the course
proposed. He added that an adjournment would
have been necessary, even if the Attorney-
General had gone on with his speech now, as he
(the Chief Justice) wished to look over his notes.
He did not intend to read the whole of his notes
to the jury, as that course would rather tend to
confuse them; but he should comment upon the
salient points of the evidence, and trust to the
jury for their retention of the details.
The Court then adjourned until ten o?clock on
Friday morning.
NINTH DAY.
On the assembling of the Court this morning,
Mr. Wood called the attention of his Honour
to the array of books on the table before his
learned friends on the other side, and observed
that it was not allowable for the At orney-General,
in the course of his address to the jury, to read
extracts from medical works which had not been
put in evidence in the course of the trial. In
support of his objection, he cited the ac ion for
libel upon a Roman Catholic, heard before the
Court' of Exchequer, in which the defendant?s
counsel wished, in the course of his remarks, to
read extracts from various works, to show what
were the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.
It was held in ihat case that the works might be
referred to only for the sake of illustration, and
not as proving any particular fact.
The Chief Justice observed that counsel
ould read a passage from a book (without men-
tioning the name of the book) as a portion of his
peech. He was not at liberty to cite it as an
xtract.
The attorney-General said that whatever
he read would be merely to illustrate the
principles which be might lay down ro the jury.
The Chief Justice remarked that the jury
could only take it as an argument, and treat it
according to its worth.
The Attorney-General then proceeded to
reply on the whole case. The ury, he observed,
would recollect that in the perora ion delivered
by the learned counsel on the other side the pre-
vious day, he dwelt with considerable * fleet upon
the per centage of cures in the Yarra Bend
Asylum, as compared with the per centage of cures
in the lunatic asylum in Tasmania, and similar
institutions elsewhere. The. appeal which his
learned friend made, not only to the passions of
the jury, hut to the passions of an audience, con-
sisting, perhaps, not of the most impartial per-
sons in an inquiry of this kind, would he recol-
lected. That attempt to mislead the jurv was
not an ingenuous one. The assertion of his
learned friend was not only not founded upon
fact, but it was opposed to the medical evidence


which was brought forward ; and he trusted that
this would be taken as a sample of the reasoning
which, throughout, marked his learned friend's
elaborate address. It would be remembered
Mr. Orooke stated in the course of his evidence
that, owing iothe separation of ihe incurable and
idiotic from the other patients, the per centage
of cures was much higher in Tasmania than the
psr centage of cures here. There it was over
seventy per cent.; here it was only thirty-nine
per cent. He also stated that the average of
cures in England was thirty-five per cent.?a
circumstance overlooked by the learned counsel
on the o her side. Thus it appeared that in Eng-
land, with all the appliances and accommodation
that could there be commanded, the average
cures were smaller than those at the Yarra
Bend, where there was no classification, where
the lunatics were huddled together, and where
all the difficulties which Dr. Bowie had described
in evidence existed. Under these circumstances,
the seventy per cent, of curable maniacs in Tas-
mania was no standard by which to measure the
average in an establishment elsewhere ; and he
trusted he had now dispelled any impression that
might have exis ed as to the forty per cent, re-
maining to be accounted for. He would now
proceed to discuss the case as succinctly as
he could, considering the mass of evidence
with which he had to deal. He had no
desire to occupy the time of the Court
unnecessarily, but he felt that every thing
dear to his client was en rus ed to his hands.
The defendant presented himself before the
Court in the character of a public journalist,
claiming the right to criticise the acts of public
men, and the management of public institutions.
He (the Attorney-General) was not 'here to deny
any such right on the part of the public journalist.
But this right must be exercised within proper
limits, A journalist had no right, under the
pretence of seeking to ameliorate the condition
of an institution, to indulge in vindictive attacks,
and assail the public and private character of
such a man as Dr. Bowie. He hoped never to
see the right of criticism abridged ;
but the liberiy of the press was one thing,
and its licentiousness another. With these
introductory remarks, he begged to call the
attention of the jury o the circumstances at-
tending the publication of the first libel, in
Sepiembtr, 1861. An inquiry had been insti-
tuted by a Parliamentary committee with respect
to the condition of the Yarra Bend Asylum.
Witnesses?discharged attendants and half-cured
patients?unfavourable to Dr. Bowie, had been
examined ; and on this ex parte evidence the de-
fendant though proper to come forward and
denounce Dr. Bowie as an incompetent old man,
and as a sort of mons er of cruelty. But was
that legitimate criticism ? Was that fair- play ?
Supposing any one of them engaged in litiga-
tion, would it be fair for a public journal
to come forward, when only the evidence for the
adversary had been supplied, and inflame the
public mind by pu ting forward as facts state-
ments resting only on ex parte and hostile evi-
dence ? He denied that this was done in the
legitima e exercise of the rights of a puhlm
journalist. He denied the right of a journalist
to take an inquiry out of hands entrusted with it,
and ake upon himself the double office of accuser
and judge with regard to the management of this
institu ion and the conduct of Dr. Bowie. He
entreated the jury to put from their minds the
assumption thrt it was with a proper desire
to inquire into the alleged abuses of the
asylum that this libel was published. It
was simply a wanton abuse of the power of the
press. And let them imagine for a moment the
position of Dr. Bowie. Here was a gentleman
engaged for forty years in the superintendence
of similar charitable ins itmions in England.
He came to the colony in 1852, and was con-
nected wi h the Yarra Bend Asylum in that
year. For ten years?during a most unsettled
state of society -he had been managing that in-
stitu ion with such appliances, accommodation,
and attendants as were placed at his command.
And what was the result ? He had been assailed
in the manner which had been described. Dr.
Bowie was a public officer, amenable to the
head of his department and to Parliament.
Was it possible for him to stand still under
such imputations? No Government could have
permitted such statements as ihose contained in
the libel to appear in a public print without in-
quiring into them, and consequently Dr. Bowie
had to be forced, at his time of life, into a court
of justice, before a jury, and have all the acts of
his life criticised,or be branded as an incompetent
old man, assailed in his profession and reputation,
and held up before the world as a monster of
cruelty. Was that fair play ? Was it essential
to the maintenance of the rights and liberties of
this councry, that the press should have the
power of taking such a course as that ?
And now he would ask the jury to observe
the conduct of the defendant throughout the
trial. By the course he had taken, he had
become responsible for all the statements he had
thou ht proper to make. If he was not able to
make out his pleas of justification, there must be
a verdict against him. To the three counts con-
tained in the declaration, eleven pleas of justifi-
cation had been made, all pointing towards dif-
ferent allegations complained of in the declarar
tion, and set forth in the libels. The first case
which presented itself to their notice was that
known as Herbert?s. The principal evidence
relied upon with respect to that case was
the evidence of Dr. Carr, on whose credibility
and mental condition he (the Attorney-General)
should have to comment presently. Now, this was
the evidence given by Dr, Carr with regard to
Herbert: ?? He had invaiiably a jacket by day,
and generally a canvas bag by ni.ht. I recollect
seeing him once or twice altogether out of
restraint, and naked in the straw. The strait-
waistcoat was of a somewhat similar description
to the strait-waistcoat used at present, but the
difference was in the mode in which it was
applied by the attendants. At that time I
observed that some patients were worse treated
in that respect than others. Herbert did not
seem to give much evidence of actual physical
torture. When the attendant was somewhat
maliciously disposed, he could irflict extra tor-
ture upon the patient by twisting the wrist or
altering he fastening.? Now. what was all this
hut a description of the mechanical restraint
rendered necessary by circumstances ? Herbert,
Dr. Carr says, was subjected to no unnecessary or
actual physical torture. And this was mainly th�


evidence relied upon. Now, who was Herbert ?
He was a Frenchman, and had been a
captain of the garde mobile. He was a
man of most violent temper, a confirmed
drunkard?a man who could not be allowed
to be at large. And the only eviden jd with re-
gard to his case was that of a lunar ir, who was
smarting under the delusion that t�e was de-
tained at the asylum contrary to law, and withou
justifica ion. Dr. Carr said that he had seen
Herbert out of restraint, and naked in the
straw; but Dr. Bowie had explained that some of
the lunatics were in the habit of tearing their
things to shreds, and the jury had seen samples
of the patients? handiwork A madhouse was no
paradise at any time ; but the question which the
ury had to ask themselves was, whether,
with the appliances Dr. Bowie had at his
command, mechanical restraint was not essen-
tial at the Yarra Bend ? There was nothing
in Carr's evidence /elating to Herbert that would
lead the jury to the conclusion that any brutal
treatment had taken place in his case. And th* n
if they took the statements of Cowley and Mor-
gan Irwin, they would see that the whole pre-
ponderance of evidence with regard to this par-
ticular lunatic was in favour of the plaintiff.
Cowlay, who was an attendant when Herbert was
a patient, said he never saw Herbert ill-treated at
all; and this evidence was confirmed by Mor-
gan Irwin, who was the man who had charge of
Herbert from the time he went into the asylum
until the time of his death. Unless they were
disposed to disbelieve him, they must be satisfied
that Carr?s evidence was not true. He {the
Attorney-General) had been taunted with cabin*
the attendants at the asylum; but what other
witnesses could he call so well able to speak to
specific ins ances of alleged ill-treatment? The
jury ha'l seen the manner in which they had given
their evidence,and would be ablet judge whether
it were worthy of credence or not. It was qui e
clear that Herbert was treated properly, having
regard to his violent and filthy habits, and all the
circums ances of the case, and to all the means
and appliances placed at the disposal of Dr
Bowie. He was treated in a proper and humane
manner. He would refer to Dr. Bowie's own
evidence on this subject. They had seen the
manner in which Dr. Bowie had given his evi-
dence. No man who had heard him could be
Otherwise than impressed that Dr Bowie was the
witness of truth. The account he gave of Her-
bert?s case tallied exactly with that given by Irwin
and Cowlev. [The Attorney-General here read
an extract from Dr. B iwie?s evidence in reference
to the case.] He submitted that Dr. Bowie bad
given the true account of the ma ter, and that he
had dealt with Herbert in a proper way, and that
he had acted wisely in putting Herbert under
restraint. Dr. Bowie had had for y tears? expe-
rience in England, and he had been appointed the
medical superintendent of the Yarra B-nd Asy-
lum because of his supposed knowledge of the
treatment of lunatics. A man of his experience
observation could see at once �he her a
bient was likely to be attacked with a violent
roxysm or not, and bo verv properly thought
tt he would restrain before and not after he
d committed he threatened act of violence. If
had waited until Herbert had committed some
of violence, and then put him in restraint.
that would have been punishment, about which
so much bad been said in the course of the
trial, and which had been objected to by all
writers and authorities. They had the evidence
of Cowley, who was formerly an attendant, and of
Morgan Irwin, who was an attendant atthr present
time, as to Herbert's case, and he could see no
reason why that evidence should be thrown over-
board. They had also the evidence of Dr.
Bowie, who sta ed that for a fortnight before
Herbert died, he had no restraint at all, and
there was the book produced, which con ained
the entries as to the restraint used. For the life
of him, he could not understand how Dr.
M?Urea?s statement about the board of visitors
being anxious to co-operate with Dr. Bowie, and
that therefore they were willing to overlook his
little peccadilloes, could be considered consistent
with his duty. He was placed, in the cause of
humanity, to superintend the establishment,
and to act without fear, favour, or affection. He
(the At orney-General) had satisfactorily disposed
of Herbert?s case, and yet this was he par icular
instance that The Argus thought proper to put
forward as its justification for a paragraph so
foul as that portion of the libel set forth
in the first coum. He next came to the
third plea of justification, which raised the
case of Dr. Carr, which case was also
coupled with the seventh plea. He should
dispose of both these pleas at once. The jury
had seen Dr. Carr, they had seen his demeanour
in the witness-box, and they would judge whether
be was a reliable witness with regard to the treat-
ment which he said he had received in the Yarra
Bend Asylum. He went into the institution
about the middle of March, 1857. Prior to that
time, little was known of him, but that he was
then a maniac there could be no doubt, or that,
at aU events, he was labouring under a delusion
or illusion, and it became necessary to place him
under the care of Dr. Bowie. What was Carr's
own account ? That he was allowed to walk about
the grounds and elsewhere, on parole; 'bathe
was permit'ed to visit Melbourne, in 'he charge
of an attendant; that he was tieated with every
civility and kindness. Did this show a disposi-
tion on the part of the plaintiff to ill-treat the
patients under his care? On the contrary, it
showed that he was kind in his treat-
ment, and that it was only when he was
obliged to have recourse to restraint that
he was likely to have recourse to it.
Possessing these privileges for a certain period.
Dr Carr, in July, 1858, had an interview
with His Excellency the Governor. Dr. Carr
described three occurrences in that year -one in
July, one in August, and one in September ; but
his descriptions of them were all mixed up in such
a rambling way that it was nearly impossible to
tell in what order they occurred. In July, how-
ever,' it appeared that Dr. Carr came to town,
and took advantage of the opportunity to have an
interview with the Governor; and he obtained
that in ervitw?at least, so he said himself?as
one gentleman obtains an interview with ano her,
by sending in bis card to the Governor. Taking
into account the evidence connec ed with Dr,
Carr, and the position in which he was placed,
they would be of opinion, however, that that in-
terview was not ob ained in the ordinary way.
After this interview occurred. Dr. Carr went back


to the asylum, on the 4th of July; and what
occurred ? The circumstances were reported to
Dr. Bowie ; and what did Dr. Bowie do? He
did not go near him on the 4th, because,
as he had said himself, he did not wish
to have recourse to restraint until it was neces-
sary to do so. If Dr. Bowie had been a man of
cruel character he would not have acted in this
considerate way. On the s;h, he saw Dr, Carr,
and ordered him to be put to bed. From his
experience Dr. Bowie saw that it was necessary
to place Carr under restraint ?he saw that he was
in a state of excitement, and he apprehended
violence from that excitement. Who was the
best judge? Dr. Bowie, always excepting Dr.
M'Crea, whose business it was to fupervise Dr.
Bowie's arrangements. Dr. Carr was put in re-
straint ?the restraint which Dr. Bowie, as a
humane and kind man, deemed necessary. [Having
referred to the evidence of Dr. Carr as to the
treatment which he stated he had received in
September, the Attorney-General read the evi-
dence of Cowley on the same subject, and sub-
mitted that Cowley?s evidence proved that no
extraordinary degree of violence had been used
towards Dr. Carr.] Dr. Carr was a man of great
violence; he had threatened to murder the plain-
tiff ; he had struck with his pannikin one of the
attendants ; and he (the Attorney General)
thought Dr. Bowie was justified, as the
medical man having charge of this insti-
tution, in having recourse to some means
of preventing any further violence taking
place. He would ask them also to consider
the evidence of Andrew Young, one of the
attendants, which was to this effect:??l recol-
lect Dr. Carr, but, he was never under my charge,
or in my ward. I remember on a Sunday fore-
noon, in 1858, being sent for, along with another
attendant, to lend a hand to put Carr into a
jacket. Carr was standing, with his bedstead
barricading the door of his cell, chamber-pot in
hand, threatening to knock out the brains of
the first man who entered his room. I saw him
standing on his bedstead. When he saw who was
outside, he laid down the utensil quietly, and he
was then put into a jacket.? I think he said,
? There is no resisting you ; there are too many
of you.? If they believed this evidence, they
must believe it was absolutely necessary that
something should be done to restrain Dr. Carr
from further acts of violence. Something must
have occurred before this. Surely it was not
for Dr. Bowie?s own amusement that he sent
an attendant to Dr. Carr to exasperate
him. What could be the use of that?
There was the barricading of the door, and there
was ihe torrent of violence ; and other violence
must have occurred, and must have been ob-
served by Dr. Bowie, and the treatment which he
placed Carr under was, to prevent a repetition of
violence, and not as punishment. Was Dr. Bowie
to prevent further violence, or was he to wait
until further violence had ac ually been com-
mitted ? If he had refiained from having recourse
to means of restraint until violence bad been
actually comrait'ed, how the learned counsel for
the defendant would have rung the changes. He
would have said?? What was Dr. Bowie there
for ? What did he receive his salary for ? Whv
had he a staff of at'endauts ? Why was all this
expenditure upon buildings? What were all these
means of restraint for, if they were not to pre-
venr violence ?? Was the medical officer of the
establishment to prevent violence, or was he to
wait till violence had been committed, and then
not to prevent it, but to punish it ? The jury
would remember �he other instance in which life
had been taken away. Was Dr. Bowie to wait till
a similar scene took place ? Was there to
be a second deed like that committed by
M?Donaid ? Why, if ?he plaijntiff had allowed
Dr, Carr to proceed without putdng him
in restraint, be would have been neglecting his
du y, [The Attorney-General proceeded to read
the evidence of Grimwood, the contractor, which
he said was concurrent testimony with the tes-
timony of the other witnesses as to the condition
of Dr. Carr, in 1858 ] This portion of the case,
however, did not even rest upon the evidence of
Cowley, of Grimwood, or of the other witnesses
to which he had referred; but there was ihe evi-
dence of Edmund Jones, one of the attendants,
who said :??I am an attendant at the Yarra
Bend Asylum. I went there in Augus , 1856. I
know Dr. Carr. I recollect his being put under
restraint. I saw him strike Shearer, an attendant,
with a pannikin.? This was rather at variance
with the philanthropic scientific notion of Dr.
Barry, who said that a lunatic never s ruck any
one unless he was first ill-trea ed. He (the
Attorney-General) was not dealing with vague
generalities, like his learned friend?he was not
going into bags, bugs, lice, and vermin, and
small jokes on a momentous subject; but he was
going into specific instances of alleged ill-treat-
men'. He felt too much the responsibility cast
upon him to indulge in the levities which persons
may indulge in who were connected with news-
papers? who scribble for hire, irrespective of the
feelings they may wound, or the characters they
may destroy. Having read the evidence of
Tarraway, an attendant, which he contended
also confirmed his argument that Dr. Bowie was
jus ified in the course which he had pursued with
respect to Dr. Carr, the Attorney-General said
the jury had heard the changes rung upon the
allega ion that Dr. Carr was exasperated be-
cause he would be brought to the court
in the dress usually worn by the inmates
of the asylum. A medical witness, who
was examined, had stated that Dr. Carr had said
that tha 1 was the cause of his excitement. But
what were the facts? Why, Dr. Carr was asked
if he was not going ro put on bis other clothes ?
the clothes which he wore when be went to the
balls ; and he refused to do so. When he got
into a paroxysm in 'he box, and pointed
to the ? broad arrow,? as he called it, he
evidently wished to impress the minds of
the jury unfavourably towards Dr. Bowie
in regard to this matter, and there is evi-
dence of malice on his part, because he had
made an allusion to this matter to a medical man,
evidently with the view of fortifying his state-
ment, and bus endeavoured to force on ?be jury
views which he considered might be detrimental
to the plaintiff. [The learned counsel next read
Dr. Bowie?s evidence as o the treatment of Carr,
which concluded thus :?? I never directed that
Dr Carr?s hands should be padlocked up io hiS
shoulder. I never saw it, and never would have
allowed it. I think the position of Dr. CarrS
hands, when put in the jacket on that occasion.


was behind his back ?the same position in which,
I believe, Bonaparte is usually represented/?]
It miahi be supposed that, his mind being con-
stantly devoted to the treatment of patients, he
not unnaturally borrowed a lesson from life, and
seeing a man with his hands in a particular
position, he got the idea of a new course of treat-
ment, and adopted it. His learned friend made
a great handle of this, and treated it in a humor-
ous manner certainly, but not as he (the
Attorney-General) would have treated so serious
a subject. [The learned counsel then read from
The Argus report of the evidence a few ex-
tracts elating to Dr. Carrr?s violence.] He
would ask the jury, as men of common sense,
if, looking at the evidence, and regarding Dr.
Bowie?s position, and the object for which he was
placed at the head of that establishment, they
did not think that it was necessary that Carr
should be restrained, or would they believe the
contrary version of the facts given by a maniac ?
It did not appear that Dr. 01?Crea carried the
allegation of ill-treatment one step further than
Carr; and the jury were left to dwell only
upon Carr?s testimony to the truth of the
cruelty said to have been committed in 1858.
Let them look at what Dr. M'Grea said, and see
how much argument there was, and how little
evidence. In 1860, the Chief Secretary took the
asylum from under his control, and he had given
a version of what he thought of the place when
he was there. The management was not good,
he thought, and all his requisitions and sugges-
tions were objected to. That was his evidence,
and they had heard Dr. Bowie?s reply. They
had heard Dr. Bowie say that his order invariably
was that the one particular purpose for which a
bag should be used was to keep a patient warm.
He always desired that a blanket should be put
in ; and yet Dr. M'Grea said, sneaking of Carr,
? To to the best of my recollection, the bag was
not lined with flannel." Why, ic never was lined
with flannel; and the plaintiff never said it was,
or wished it to be. Dr. M'Crea did not seem to
know what sort of institution he was in. He
appeared to be dreaming of something which he
had read of in books relating to similar
institutions in other countries. Blankets were
the usual things, and the object of them
had been explained over and over again.
This was no better evidence than Carr?s manacles
and padlocks, and was extremely valuable indeed.
Dr. il'Crea said that Carr had not got the bag very
tight, but the evidence of Carr was that it was
fastened so tightly that the vermin actually could
not get in. Who was to be believed ? Dr. IVl'Grea,
again, said ? The matter was investigated and
reported upon.? How was it that this report was
not heard of ? Who did it condemn ? The
natural inference was that the matter was inves-
tigated, that Dr. Bowie was vindicated, and that
Dr. M'Grea naturally dropped the subject. What
was done with the report ? Would any one tell ?
Was Dr. Bowie reproved or reprimanded, or the
attendants dismissed ? All that could be got was
Dr. M'Crea?s dim and very vague recollec-
tion ; and yet the jury were coolly invited
to the conclusion that Carr was treated in
a manner described. [The Attorney-General
re read the entry made in the board-book
lative to Carr?s visit to town and its con
[uences.] Was it not necessary that, under
circumstances like these, there should be some re-
straint? Counsel for the defendant did not ven-
ture to go into evidence of this kind. It suited
him better to go into rhapsodies ban meet the
case on its substantial merits. The jury?s duty
was a different one. They had to pronounce a
verdict which would be the salvation or ruin of
that aged gentleman, whose conduct had been
dragged before them in so public and merciless a
manner in the libels complained of. Carr?s case
was now disposed of; and he came to the fourth
plea, respecting Mrs. Steele, Counsel for the
defendant had coolly told them that on this case
he was clearly entitled to a verdict. He (the
Attorney-General) certainly could not help ad-
miring the face of the learned gentleman.
There was no doubt that it was Dr. Bowie who
was entitled to recover on that issue, and that
counsel for the defendant felt, or he would not
have tried to ride off with a degree of celerity
which actually outstripped what he had done
before. Why, he knew it was his weak
point, and that there was not one tittle of
evidence to justify the allegation in the libel.
In The Argus of November 20, 1861, there was
this paraeragh ?We trust the authorities at
the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum will be able to
put us in a position to contradict some very ugly
rumours prevalent as to a child to which one of
the female patients has recently given birth.
Surely quite sufficient odium already attaches
to this ins itution, without its being obnoxious
to so gross a scandal as these rumours imply.?
Did the jury believe the author trusted or wished
anything of the kind ? Did they believe he was
not pandering to his own morbid appetite for
scandal ? Rumours, indeed !?rumours of his
own creation, which his trade and practice
enabled him to invent, and on which bis paper
lived. This was followed up by another paragraph
on November 23, in which the libeller said :
? We must not close these remarks without de-
manding, on behalf of the helpless creatures im-
prisoned in this place, and their friends, an im-
mediate inquiry into an occurrence alluded to in
Wednesday?s Argus as subject of rumour, and
which we now repeat as a matter of fact.? As if
it were not sufficiently harassing that the mem-
ber of a family should be placed in an asylum
under such circumstances, but that suspicion and
alarm shouli be excited among the friends out-
side. ? Repeat as a matter of fact,? indeed ! He
first made the rumour, then adverted to it as a
rumour, and finally declared it to be a matter of
fact. The paragraph went on to state that
a female patient had given birth to a
child, and that it challenged contradiction.
That was it?'he libeller first invented the
rumour, turned it into a fact, and then chal-
lenged contradiction. Now, the plea of justifica-
tion to this was, that ? a patient in the asylum
had given birth to a child, and that one of the
servants of the asylum was its father, and that
no report had been made of the matter, which it
was attempted to carefully hush up.? Mrs.
Steele had been called; and was there one tit'le of
evidence to show that she was of unsound mind,
or that any attempt had been made to hush
the matter up ? The woman was certainly
originally a patient, demented by the loss of
her husband. She remained on the premises till
she was discharged as sane; and discharged by


Dr. M'Crea. It had been said that she had not
been legally discharged, and that Dr. Bowie?s
threat to send her back to the asylum was proof
of her insanity. Did not Dr. MCrea discharge
her; and were they not nowaoked to believe that,
in fact, Dr. Bowie improperly and illegally dis-
charged her when an uncured patient? It was
monstrous, and trifling with common sense, to pu'
these things before them. Though the Governor?s
warrant had not been put in evidence, he could
state itjas a matter of fact, that a patient could he
discharged in this way, on the certificate of the
chief medical officer and the recommendation of
the board. Was Mrs. Steele to be treated as dis-
charged legally at one time, and illegally at
another ? The libel said the child was born in
the asylum ; but let them look at the dates. Mrs.
Steele arrived in the asylum in June. 1856; and
was discharged on February 11, 1859. She was
hired as a laundress, at �3 per month ; and the
jury saw how the learned counsel for the defend-
ant was staggered at that fact?how he reeled
under the discovery that the woman was a servant,
hired at �3 per month. That scene of hers, when
she blew out the candle, occurred in September,
1859. If Dr. Bowie was to be responsible for the
virtue of ladies of this description, he would
hardly be able to manage his duties. The woman
was receiving waues, there had been five months?
experience of her sanity, and, undet the very nose
of the Board of Visitors, she sat down on Sloane?s
bed, waiting for him to come, and when he
did come she blew out the candle. As soon as
she was found out she quitted the asylum, and,
after the proper nine months, was delivered of a
baby. And it was the responsibility of all this
that defendant wished to attach to Dr, Bowie, in
a libel written in November, 1861, though the
woman was confined in June, 1860. The ?child
recently born? was one year and five months old,
and this was what it was said Dr. Bowie had
hushed up. What was the whole story but an
invention?an admitted invention? And there
was not one io'a of evidence to enable the jury to
arrive at any other conclusion than that it was a
malicious invention of the author of the libel.
No matter for the acts of negligence of which Dr.
Bowie might in a minor degree be culpable?and
he (the Attorney-General) would show presently
that he was not culpable? this was the libel, and
Dr. Bowie was not guilty. Let it be supposed,
for argument?s sake, that all the series about the
bugs, lice, and objectionable modes of treat-
ment were true, would that justify the
editor or proprietor of a newspaper in wilfully
charging an aged man? in his seventieth year?
who had been a professional man for forty years,
who was without a blemish on his moral or pro-
fessional character, who for ten years had been
engaged in this very asylum, crowded with luna-
tics pouring in from all the gaols in the country,
with none of the proper modes and appliances
for proper treatment, with being a monster of
cruelty, a deliberately cruel roan, who let this
affair go on, and would not make a report of it,
and then endeavoured to suppress the facts ? Was
there a tittle of evidence to prove this justifica-
tion ? Let them take for granted the bags, the
bugs, the lice, and the excrement on the wall?
were those reasons why Dr. Bowie should be
charged with conniving at an act of immorality,
and coolly suppressing the fact ? What justification
was there in 'he whole of the case? Was there
anv at all? The charges of negligence might be
well or ill founded, but what did the jury
think of them coupled with a reflection on
the plaintifl?s moral character? Here was the
fa her of a family, at an advanced period of life,
living at this good old age by his intellectual and
physical exertions, risking his life every day ; and,
assuming every charge of negligence to be
proved, was 'here any justification for this foul
charge ? Did the defendant dare explain his own
malign intention ? If it were so, he would ask
them, however desirous they were to maintain
the rights of criticism upon public men and public
institutions, to pronounce a just verdict. That
right of criticism must not be abused?it must
be exercised in regard to legitimate objects, and
not be so used as, while censuring acts and
negle it, to rob a man of the means of life, dis-
grace him in the eyes of the community, and
turn him out beggared in his old age. He (the
At r orney General) was perfectly satisfied, what-
ever applause might come from a mob in
the gallery, that there could be no sym-
pathy for such an offender. Uneducated per-
sons, hearing the harangues of counsel, and
stories about bags, bugs, lice, and fleas, might cry
?Oh, what cruel treatment!? But he would
ask the jury to look at it all as men of sense.
Was there any evidence to touch one of the
allegations in this plea about Mrs. Steele, who
was no more a patient in the hospital when the
child was born than Dr. Bowie tried to hush the
ma ter up. What did he do ? He sent some one
to inquire as to the father, and some other
person was imposed upon him. Immediately
afterwards he went there in his own carriage,
Sloane, the seducer, driving him. But at that
time Dr. Bowie was convinced that Sloane was
not the father. He endeavoured to extract the
secret, but Mrs. Steele told him to mind his own
business. Was that evidence of her insanity?
She was cunning enough in this instance. He
said he would take her back to the wards ; and
her old respect for his authority had its weight,
so she said who was the father of her child. He
went home ; Sloane drove him, and a great deal
had been said about his not wanting to pay a
shilling or half-a crown to go home without
his coachman. What aggravation ! What wicked-
ness ! And when he got home he at once turned
Sloane out of the house. It was trifling with the
jury to allude to such topics. Surely there was
no justification in this. It was a lie on its face,
and the jury should pronounce their verdict
against the man who had concocted i his malicious
falsehood, to injure a man discharging a public
duty. Perhaps there had been negligences in
other respects; but he would prove to them that
they were not so when due respect was had to
tbemeans and appliances at Dr. Bowie?s command,
and the circumstances of the colony at the time.
That was the fourth plea, and on that it was
simply a question of damages. He had disposed
of that, and would now proceed to pleas five and
six, which related to Mullens. They had heard
evidence with regard to Mullens on the other
side?the evidence of Dr. Thomas and Mr.
Rudall. They would find that Mullens went into
the hospital nine weeks before his death, that he
had been fighting, and had a black eye and other
marks, which showed that some violence had been


used to him. Then they found the circumstances
under which he died according' to Dr. Thomas ;
but upon that subject he begged to say that the
whole of the evidence on it was merely the
opinion of two medical men. They found
themselves on the horns of a dilemma. Three
of 'he ribs were broken when he died, ac-
cording to the post mortem examination, and
they were told that they were broken in
one of two ways, either before he entered the
asylum or af er he entered it, and that whatever
way they were broken the defendant was neces-
sarily entitled to a verdior. They would recollect
that on a matter of fact there could be no dispute,
and he would read them a case which was similar
to that of Mullens, and which they might take
as true or not, as they thought proper. He
merely put it as part of his case : ?A. 8., a
tall, stout, middle-aged man, with a dark com-
plexion, and wood carver by trade, was admitted
into the Asylum, He had been insane
two years before, but was paid to have recovered,
and had, on his admission, been ailing only six
weeks?this latter statement being somewhat
doubtful. He was quite paralytic, spoke in a
loud blustering tone, and in the deliberate
manner of a general paralytic. He had the
usual classes of delusions in such cases?
wealth, and so forth. He would sleep for
about half the night, and when awake was rather
noisy. He ate heartily, even greedily, and, with
the exception of the symptoms stated, seemed in
excellent health. He was occasionally much ex-
cited during the day, but was readily pacified. Un-
less carefully wa'ehed, he was apt to fall, as his
legs afforded him but little support. As this
patient was so noisy and loquacious, he was not
examined physically, in the hope that the excite-
ment would shortly subside, but he died rather
suddenly on the thirteenth day after admission.
An examination of the body disclosed ten ribs
fractured?six on the left side, from the fourth
downwards, and four from the sixth on the right.
The fractures occurred in a line extending from
the junction of the middle and anterior thirds of
the highest broken rib to the anterior extremity
of the first false ribs. Several of the ribs were
broken in three places.?
The Chief Justice.? What is this?
The Attorney-General.? lt was a case he
put in and read to the jury in the course of the
trial. Ills learned friends need not be so
anxious to throw any obstacles in his way. lie
had seen that anxiety on their part throughout.
To resume the exTact ?? In these ribs one point
of fracture was found to be converted into a false
joint, a second to have a collection of pus, and a
third to have callus around it, but not of any
recent date. ... A few hours before his
death, this man had been exhibiting his very fine
voice, as he called it, running up and down the
scale in a very powerful, but by no means cor-
rect, manner. He appeared to be quite uncon-
scious that anything was the matter with him,
&nd made no complaint whatever of pain and
Uneasiness, and expressed himself well satisfied
with the treatment he received in the asy-
lum.? ?M. , an incoherent and ex-
tremely restless lunatic, moved about as usual,
Ulads no complaint of pain or injury, and ate
heartily up to the time of his death. On ex-
amining the body, six ribs were found broken on
the right side and one on the left. No suspicion
of these fractures had existed before death,
although special attention had been drawn to the
right side, by the appearance of a swelling, which
was subsequently proved to contain pus, conse-
quent upon the fractures ? He had now put
cases which they might take for whatever they were
worth, but he wanted to guard them against being
led away by the tes imony of two medical men,
which was founded merely upon their own ex-
perience and judgement. It was not impossible
that, though due a'tend on was given, the fracture
of the three ribs in Mullens should have escaped
the attention of Dr. Bowie and his attendants.
He would take them to the evidence, if they
liked, of Dr. Thomas, who was a physician,
he admitted, of great skill and respectability.
[The Attorney General then read over the por-
tion of Dr. Thomas?s evidence referring to the
post mortem, and where he said the ribs could
not have been fractured more than fourteen days
before death.] Mr. Rudall was also callel ; but
to show that they might be mistaken, a jury of
twel-e men differed from them, and even found a
verdict in the face of the majority of the opinion
of the doctors. Thus they were fortified in the
view they (the jury) might take. Mr. Rudall, in
his examination, said he made a post mortem
examination of the body of Mullens within twelve
or fourteen hours after death, that he found three
ribs broken, and that the fracture might have
occurred ten days previous to death. That gentle-
man, when asked how he could tell the length of
time the bones had been fractured, accounted for
it by a trition. He (the Attorney- General) believed
there was a process of a?trition on stone, but he was
not aware that it was produced so rapidly on the
body. It was rather a refined notion, and if he
were one of the jury he should be rather inclined
to reject it. That question was debated on the
inquest, and there were a majority of doctors in
favour of it, gentlemen no doubt very clever, but
for practical purposes not very reliable. It might
be said, that at all events the ribs were broken,
but was it impossible that the ribs were broken
and not detected ? That was so in the case he
had read, and if it was so in the case where a
man could ? run up and down the scale? with ten
ribs broken, it was very possible that three broken
ribs might not be discovered. What were they
then to do ? Were they to fix upon Dr. Bowie all
those things? Was he to be dragged into that ?
Was he to be condemned, slandered, and ma-
ligned, and were ten pleas of justification
to be pla< ed on the records of that Court after-
wards ?He would go on to the evidence of his
side?to that called by the plaintiff; and what
was the fact ? He liked facts betier than opi-
nions, particularly those of doctors. Speaking
of Mullens, Ketscb, the attendant, spoke of him
being washed, and that he had traces of former
bruises and sores. He was glad to hear the
evidence of that man, and of others, as it spoke
of the care shown to Mullens. There was also
the evidence of Andrew Younq on that subject.
Young said he received Mullens from the gaol,
and that he undressed and bathed him. He saw
some marks upon him, and a black eye. He
went on to say that when in the bath Mullens
was covered with water, and that he partly
dried himself When he was capable of
doing so, it was the practice to allow him


to do it. He saw the man perfectly
naked, and Dr. Bowie saw him at night when he
was taken with fits. If the man had his ribs
broken, as was found by a post mortem examina-
tion, it was hardly fair io make such charges
against Dr. Bowie or the attendants for not
having detected that they were broken, as they
must have seen the fractures, if they showed at
all, when the man was washed and rubbed.
There was other evidence on the subject given by
Avesel, who was a most respectable witness. He
would call attention to it, as he had no desire to
screen any evidence. Avesel said, he ?knew
Mullens, and he believed he was kindly treated.?
So that there was Ketsch?s evidence?that of
Young, who also spoke of his not being ill-used ;
and then there was AveseTs evidence ?all
that was against the evidence of Dr.
Thomas and Mr. Rudall. In addition to that
there was the evidence of Mr. Gillbee and Dr.
Bowie. He might say that no gentleman stood
higher in his profession than Mr. Gillbee, and
that he was an unbiassed witness, as he was not
connected with the establishment or Dr. Bowie
in any way. He merely appeared to give his
evidence on oath. No doubt he did not see the
body, but he had had some facts placed before
him, and, having the diagnosis before him, he
was quite as competent as any man to give an
opinion. [The Attorney- General then read por-
tions of Mr. Gillbse?s evidence, which was given
on Thursday.] He would ask, in a case of that
description, of a recent injury of that kind, which
could not be discovered by external symptoms,
and into the cause of which one could not
be led by the complaint of the patient, how
could any man be blamed? With 700 souls
to look after, was he to go into every
minute examination where there were no symp-
toms of complaint? It would be unreasonable to
expect him to do so, and taxing him beyond what
he could do. There it was, a man like Mr. Gill-
bee, who was at the head of his profession, told
them that without external show a man could
have his ribs broken, and yet his client, who had
had years of experience, was to be libelled by
The Argus, and complained against because
neither he nor his attendants could discover that
Mullens had broken three ribs. What was the
opinion on which they were called upon to act?
They had Mr. Gillbee, Dr. Bowie, Mr. Rudall,
and Dr. Thomas ; and then there was that
of Dr. Grooke. [Tbe Attorney-General read
long extracts from Dr. Grooke?s evidence to
prove how different it was to that given
by Dr. Thomas and Mr. Rudall. He
also quoted from the evidence given by Dr.
Bo vie.] Ho had read them a body of evidence,
of impartial evidence ; for they could put Dr.
Bowie?s on one side, if they chose, and take the
others'. There were the witnesses Ketsoh, Young,
Avesel, and others, who proved that the man
was kindly treated, washed, and examined?that
he showed no symptoms of fracture?that Dr.
Bowie went in to see him every night to examine
him; and against all that evidence, you have that
of two men, who say the accident must have
happened from violence in the asylum. Against
them there was the evidence of Dr. Bowie, Dr,
Turnbull, Mr. Gillbee, and Mr. Grooke ; and he
would ask them whether, af er that evidence,
they would assume that the fracture was
from an act of negligence, for which his
client was responsible ? The black eye and the
bruises on the man?s face would all indicate that,
before being received into the asylum, he had
the fracture; and all the evidence went to show
that the fracture could not be ascertained from
outward appearances. He thought everything
was in favour of its occurring before the man
went to the asylum ; and yet, with all that evi-
dence before them, Dr. Bowie was to be libelled
and assailed in the columns of The Argus. He
had a book before him in which an en ry was
made of all the persons received into the asylum.
He offered it to the learned counsel on the other
side, who, however, said to himself, Timeo
Danaos dona ferentes. There was an entry
made on September 11, 1861 [The Attorney-
General was in the course of reading an
extract from the book, when an objec-
tion was raised by Mr. Wood.] He said
as his learned friend objected, he would not
go further; but he had read enough to show
what it was?he had read enough to show that
those parties who were using the rights of the
press to criticise the conduct of a public man,
would not allow the records of his office to be
produced,
Mr. Wood.?We have no objection, if you
have none, to our commenting upon it after-
wards.
The Attorney-General proceeded to say he
would have no objection, but the opposite side
had had every opportunity of refusing it. It
was merely one of those nisi prius tricks which
were perpetrated under certain circumstances.
The course was often resorted to, particularly
in criminal cases; and, to his shame be it
spoken, he, when on his last legs, had done some
little things of the kind. He was now discussing
the case of Patrick Mullens?not in a general
way, but specifically, and on the evidence. There
was a coroner?s inquest held in that case, but
there the opinions of Mr. Rudall and Dr. Thomas
were not accepted, and yet there were no at-
tendants on the jury. The great point on the
o her side was that the jurors were attendants-
murderers sitting on their own handiwork.
It had been explained, however, that the
asylum was in a neighbourhood where
there were few residents outside the asylum,
but that whenever strangers could be ob-
tained they were always summoned to act on
the inquests. He thus disposed of the sixth
plea. The seventh plea had been dealt with in
connexion with the third plea, and, therefore, he
would pass on <o the eighth, which related to the
case of a patient named Fitzgerald. Hiighman,
a witness called on the part of tbe plaintiff, and
who was an attendant at the asylum for about
seven months, stated this with regard to Fitz-
gerald He died on the 22nd March last, near
Dr. Callan?s residence. He came up from S
ward. He was very sickly and feeble, and seemed
terrified. He was very destructive with regard to
his clothes, and, in consequence, was put into a
bag during the night. It was a narrow kind of
bag, made of very rough canvas?what sailers
would perhaps call No. 3 canvas. It was very dirty
?almost black, Fitzgerald was confined in that
bag all night. He could not move his arms. He
was placed on the bed, and lay there like a
mummy. The bag was fastened by leather straps


and a padlock. In the day time he was put into
the airing yard. He had on some patent
gloves?canvas gloves without fingers, fas-
tened by a leather strap and padlock which
screwed up, and if screwed up tight
would give excruciating pain to any man.
Fitzgerald was in the brick building five or six
weeks before he died. He was first received by a
person named Johnson, who treated him with
every kindness, and paid every attention to him.
Afterwards a man named Conway had the charge
of him. He was then much neglected, and when
he died he was in a filthy condition. Conway was
his attendant for three or four weeks, down to
the time of his death. When Fitzgerald was
dead he was so covered with fasces that it took
the attendant nearly three hours to clean him.
I was told this." Yes, that was what it came to.
The gossip of the mad-house was to be the evi-
dence to ruin the reputation of a gentleman in
Dr. Bowie's position. The jury could see with
what animus this witness Houghman gave his
testimony; they could see that he was actuated
by anything but friendly motives towards his
former employer. But what evidence had been
produced on the part of the plaintiff with regard
to this particular case ? There was the evidence
of Andrew Young, Samuel Conway, Goold, and
John Fitzgerald, by whom all that was said by
Houghman was entirely refuted, and by whom it
was shown that Houghman had not the opponu
nity of knowing the condition of the
patient Fitzgerald. [The Attorney-General
read the evidence bearing on the case given
by these witnesses.] With regard to the alle-
gations as to the cleanliness of the institution,
there was no doubt that if persons were desirous
to misrepresent such an establishment, there was
no difficulty in 'heir doing so, seeing that it was
easy, if a particular period of time were fixed on,
to draw a revolting picture. For instance, the
impression created on the mind of a man who
saw the asylum after it was cleaned up in the
morning would be different to the account which
would be given by a person who got there before
the rooms were cleaned up. It was alleged that
the plaintiff allowed the place to remain dirty.
But he (the Attorney-General) could not re-
concile this with the great body of evidence
which had been presented on behalf of
the plaintiff. Be it remembered that he did
not call such witnesses as the man who went
into the asylum the day after the libel was pub-
lished, and then proceeded to enter every little
mater (no mater how loathsome) that came
under his notice, in his diary. The evidence sub-
mitted on the part of the plaintiff related to the
chronic, and not the exceptional, state of the in-
stitution. With respect to the case of Fitzgerald,
he called upon the jury to believe the circum
stantial, minute, and corroborative evidence
which he had produced, rather than the malicious
tales of discarded servants and half-cured pa-
tients. The jury could appreciate the value of
Mr. Coates?s testimony. The yabber-yabber
of that witness when in the box showed
that there was a screw loose somewhere.
�ud yet on his testimony they were called
Upon to pronounce a verdict which must be the
annihilation of his (the Attorney-General?s) client.
The ninth related principally to alleged maltreat-
ment and negligence in connexion with the cases
of Vicari, Germain, Ford, and Monckton. The
jury remembered Dr. M?Urea?s evidence with re-
gard to Vicari. Dr. M'Crea complained of the
dormitory in which Vicari lay, and yet he chose
to reject the requisitions and suggestions of Dr.
Bowie. Why should the responsibility for the
smallness of the apartment be fixed on Dr. Bowie ?
If there was any responsibility, surely it lay with
the chief medical officer. The gravamen of the
charge with regard to Vicari was, that he was
suffering from ulcers, that he was not cleanly, and
that he was lying in a small and dark dormitory.
This, however, was the actual and necessary con-
dition of some of the patients in the best institu-
tions. Andrew Young, however, denied ihat it
was a dark room, and spoke to the treatment of
Vicari?s legs with linseed- meal poultices and bark-
powder. But it appeared that because Dr.
M'Crea happened to look in at the asylum at a
certain time, and to find a patient suffering from
ulcers, therefore these libels were justifiable.
Then there was Monckton?s case. The man was
dying from dysentery, and Dr. M'Crea found him
eating a mutton-chop and potatoes. But what
was the great crime in that ? The man could
not live, and the granting of this particular
food was a satisfac ion to him. And here
it might be observed that it was not very
polite, of Dr. M'Crea, to intimate to Dr. Bowie,
in the presence of the attendant, his objections
to the treatment. Then there was the case of
Germain, whose head was blistered. Dr. M'Crea
objected that he was not kept clean ; but the
paiient was a restless one, and surely it was
better to aHow his beard to grow than to put him
into a strait-waistcoat in order to be shaved.
The statemen s generally on the other side, how-
ever, were inconsistent, and therefore the defend-
ant?s case became self-contradictory. Then
there was the patient Ford, who had a swollen
ear. Dr. M'Crea, who seemed to have been in a
fit of ill-temper on the occasion, asserted that
the ear was never opened ; but it was
opened by Dr. Callan, in the presence of
the attendants. And then he alleged that the
ear had not been poulticed, and would not deign
to look at the poultice used for the purpose and
shown him by the attendants. Was this tem-
perate and discreet conduct on the part of the
chief medical officer? Why should he import
his own little piques into the management of
such an institution ? and seek to lower and
weaken the influence of the superintending sur-
geon ? Then there was all the talk about the
padlock attached to the cap. But this, however
unpleasant it might be,.was applied only from
humane and merciful motives. It was done with
the view of curing the patient?of preventing
his removing those things which were applied
for the purpose of affording him physical relief.
Then there was the allegation as to the existence
of maggots. How Dr. .Bowie could prevent,
in hot weather, the engendering of maggots, it
?was difficult to say ; but the evidence showed
that whenever maggots were found they were
removed. Mr. Gillbee had shown that flies en-
gendered maggots in a wound while being dressed.
And, then, it should be remembered that the
physical debility which usually accompanied in-
sanity had a tendency to generate vermin. Conse-
quently their presence was to be expected, no mat-
ter what precautions might be taken. All that could


be expected in such an institution was that they
should he removed as promptly as circumstances
would permit. This had been done in the asylum.
He did not deny that there were bugs and lice in
the establishment; he did not deny that they
were to be found in large quantities; he did not
deny that mechanical restraint was frequently
used, but he said it was necessary ; and that, as
to the other things, they were beyond the control
of Dr. Bowie, or any man, or any body of men.
Remembering the over crowded state of the build*
inifs, and 'heir imperfect character?remembering
the shortness of hands, and the fact that persons
were constantly being sent into the asylum from all
the gaols of the country?he really was amazed
how the institution was managed as well as it
was. How could the asylum be put in comparison
with such institutions at home? Why, he ven-
tured to say that since the discovery of gold in
1852 down to the present time none of the insti-
fcu ions of the colony, public or private, could
be put into comparison with similar ones in
the old country. He would appeal to the jury
as to whether their houses had not been in-
fested with bugs. Had their establishments
been conducted with that due regard to comfort
which they could have desired ? Supposing a man
were to be tried for being an unnatural parent,
who kept his children in a wooden house festering
with bugs, and that discharged nursemaids were
to give evidence that they picked lice on one oc-
casion and bugs on another?why, he would
be reduced to an issue upon which no one would
hardly think tha f his character was at stake. He
asked no more, then, for his client, than any of
the jury would demand for themselves under
similar circumstances. The second part of this
plea dealt with generalities, which he had just
been discussing?which he had dropped into; but
the first branch of it related to the specific
occurrences which he had mentioned, as to
Germain, Ford, and Monckton. The jury heard
the evidence which was given by Coates, who
talked about the trees dangling with the remains
of human bodies just like the Chinese lanterns at
Cremorne Gardens, and of men?s skulls and
bones lying about the ground in such profusion
that they were kicked about. Why, this was an
entire delusion on the part of Coates. There was
not a single witness who was called to corroborate
this sta'ement. Visitors had been called, clergymen
had been called, ex-mayors had been called?there
had been doctors, private individuals going from
curiosity ; there had been Dr, M'Crea, but there
had not been one human being to give one io'a
of evidence to corroborate the maniacal descrip-
tions given by this half-cured lunatic Coa'es, who
had been called to speak as to the management
of lunatic asylums. How hard must a counsel
be driven who had recourse to such resources in
defending what was called the liberty of the
press. He was reluctantly compelled to refer
to Mr. Coates?s evidence. Mr. Coates had given a
description of theasy lum, and of what he considered
the general management of it. He (the Attorney-
General) did not wish to cast any imputation on
the verajity of Coates, and he would take his
own account of himself. Coates said that be
was as insane as ever, and he complained that he
had been improperly confined in the asylum.
At all events, he was a lunatic when he was ad-
mitted into the asj lum, and he said that he was
as much one now as he was then, and therefore
he was a lunatic now. And yet the jury were to
be guided by his evidence ! Coates began with a
long rambling statement, and tided over a number
of most irrelevant particulars He remembered a
patient named Edwards being locked up for refus-
ing to work in the garden, but nothing of *the kind
occurred. This was another example of his won-
derful imagination. Dr. Bowie had explained
that a most excellent mode of cleansing a cell in
which, perhaps, a loa hsome patient had been
sleeping during the nuht, was to scrub it ont
with sand and lime. The practice was to sprinkle
the sand and lime on the floor, and to have it
scrubbed off before the patient went to bed. The
use of lime was a most effective mode, both for
preserving the purity of the atmosphere and for
cleansing the cell. Coates had told them that,
in consequence of the lime being upon the
floor there was an accumulation of lime and
filth, which adhered to the beds. This was an-
other delusion, and ano her instance of his dis-
torted imagination. This was 'he gentleman who
said he had married forty-seven wives, and hat
he was going to marry three more, to make the
number up fifty. Oh, but he is not insane ;it is
only a monomania 1? was what was stated on the
other side. Surely it could not be a monomania
the fifty wives. That was a general delu-
sion rather than a particular one. Was
it upon the evidence of this man that
this important case was to be decided ?
Was it upon testimony of this character
that the pleas of justification were to be esta-
blished ? Lunatics frequently received antipathies
without cause, and no doubt this was to some
extent the case with Coates. He threw no re-
flection upon Coates. He would not dignify his
evidence as being that of a responsible being.
Coates said that the sago and arrowroot, &c., did
not get to the patients, but that it was consumed
by the attendants, and that the unfortunate
O?Donohoe, who must have been a countryman of
his (the Attorney-General?s), by the name,
drank six patients? wine in one night. This was
certainly a very curious account, but the
jury would see the kind of testimony on which
it depended, and would place very little faith in
it. Coates was the gentleman who took the cen-
sus of the bugs. He found one day 523 bugs,
and put them in a vessel, and presented them as
an offering to Dr. Bowie. He (the Attorney-
General) thought the jury would be of opinion
that there must have been some kind of company
established for the purpose of making a collection
of that description. That these bugs were in a
place where they could be collected there was no
doubt, and that they were not confined to the
520. Prom the character of the buildings, from
the influx of patients which was continually
taking place from the gaols, and from
the means and appliances which Dr. Bowie had,
it was impossible to prevent vermin. That was
bis answer to this ; but it appeared to him that
the bringing together of quantities of vermin on
the premises was rather an exaggera'ed item in
the bill of indictments against Dr. Bowie.
Coates was flady contradicted about his being re-
moved from one ward to another, and kept from
making complaints. Dr. Bowie had said that
Coates was a lousy subject ?that he bred lice.
Well, perhaps, he was; perhaps he bred all the


523 (bugs) himself ; perhaps he had sufficient to
establish a station. (Laughter.) The At orney-
General proceeded to say that he did not place
the Yarra Bend Asylum in comparison with
Colney Hatch, or any other institution, but he
contended that, considering the app iances which
Dr. Bowie had, considering the difficulties with
which he was beset, he had ably managed the
asylum, and he had discharged his du ies,
and that he was not amenable to censure. The
learned counsel also animadverted in strong terms
upon Dr. M?Grea, who, he said, had tied up Dr.
Bowie?s hands, and who, if any abuses had
existed in connexion with th ? esrablishmen ,
shared the responsibility with Dr. Bowie ; and he
called upon the jury to interpose between the
abuses of the press and an innocent, unoffending,
meritorious old man, who had fairly performed
his duties?to interpose with their verdict, ana to
declare that while they would not stop legitimate
criticism, they would denounce and punish
slanders which, for venial purposes, had been
indulged in in the unjust articles which con-
tained the libels complained of. He laid great
stress on the circumstance that an old woman whose
husband had formerly been in the asylum had
voluntarily cume forward to give evidence as to
the treatment he there received, and that another
witness had deposed to the kind treatment which
his son had received. He alsocommentedupon the
evidence of Dr. Barry and Dr. Whittenbury, who
were examined on behalf of the defendant; ridi-
culed Dr. Whitteubury?s evidence as 'othelunatic
in the cell who was seized by four attendants, and
described Dr. Barry as a man more philanthropic
than philosophic, as evidenced by his no-
tions with respect to the proper treatment of
the woman whom he described as using obscene
language; and that portion of Dr. Barry?s evi-
dence which related to tbe woman who, he
stated, had her hair cut off for breaking a
pane of glass, he (the Attorney-General) re-
plied to by the evidence of Mrs, Powell.
[The Attorney-General then read several extracts
from Elizabeth Powell?s evidence, and proceeded
to say that, this was the evidence of a respect-
able woman, not come to commit perjury.] Of
course there might be a bug or two in the wards,
Out the witness?s cleanliness and indus ry en-
abled her to keep her ward clean. The jury
must not for a moment suppose that the plaintiff
denied the existence of bugs in the asylum. He
took no such ground. So much for Elizabeth
Powell?s evidence. Next came that of John
lomas Smith, who was the companion of Dr.
irry. He did not recollect the observations
lich Dr, Barry said he made, so they could
rdly have been so very striking. It was not
ficult to magnify the most trivial things into im-
ttarce when necessity demanded that it should
done. He (the Attorney-General) asserted that
ery trivial circumstance had been magnified
;o a sort of justification of these libels. To pro-
ed?The tenth and eleventh pleas related to
tteral mismanagement of the asylum, such
Watson lying in a bag, covered with mag-
fs, and other complains; but, now that
inohoe was dead, and other men were gone
?&y, how was the plaintiff to meet the case of
cry individual bug which existed in the ima-
laiion of half-crazed or wholly crazed patients?
e eleventh plea went on to speak of Coates,
and his story of the medicine given out in old
tom bottles, and the medical comforts?sago,
arrowroot, and such like-that, he said, were taken
away by the attendants ; also, about the quantity
of beds and bedding destroyed, the rooms not
cleaned, nor properly inspec ed. But how was it
that evidence was dis inctly given that Dr. Bowie
was always inspecting, and that to the patients
he was anything but harsh. This was the sort
of case which was made up. There was the story
about the cricke and other things, which weremo-
nopolised by the attendants?all was so idle and
' vague that it was impossible to meet each charge
specifically As to the i ales relating to general mis-
management?the bags full of bugs, the clothes
destroyed, and the non-superintendence?be read
of them in the pleas, but nowhere else. The de-
fendant had called twenty witnesses, and he bad
called forty, and though he was aware tbe jury
would never think of weighing the number of
witnesses, but ascertain the value of the evi-
dence given by rigid scru iny, yet still, on a
question of management extending over many
years, and seeing the limited connexion of so
many of the servants with the asylum, be might
safely contrast the witnesses which he bad called
with those brought up on the other side, and who
for their calm demeanour, their respectability,
their credibility, and impartiality, must have the
preference. What had they in evidence on the
other side but discharged servants and men who
had been patients ? As to the matter of fact,
the counsel for the defendant had called no
witnesses to disprove the plaintiff?s case,
except those classes of persons, and a
few members of the medical profession. What
was the story of Mullens about tbe bones,
and subtle theories of that sort? What was
Wainwright's evidence? What reliance was to be
placed upon his observations ? What importance
was to be attached to the steward?s certificate ?
It was a remarkable circumstance, that men of
this sort, old servants with all their esprit de
corps, should come forward in this way. Should
not their evidence be looked upon with great cau-
tion and suspicion ? Then as to these pleas respecting
general management, the treatment of patients,
and the condition of the buildings, what evicence
was there? He had gone through what the
witnesses had said?some minor matters had been
spoken to, but what witness bad been of material
assistance in making out the case ??because re-
gard must always be had to the means and ap-
pliances of treatment actually in possession. In
winding up this question, however, he could not
more appropriately conclude than by calling
attention to a document which had been already
put in evidence. It was the report of tbe chief
medical officer, Dr. M?Crea. He would take what
Dr. M?Grea reported on the 4th September, 1855
?a period which came within the limits of this
inquiry, and to which Dr. M?Grea had appended
his signature. He stated, then, among other
things, that the buildings at Yarra Bend were in
good repair, and kept in a state of cleanliness
and order conducive to the health of the inmates ;
that the bedding aud furniture were of a proper
kind, were kept clean, and were sufficient for all
the purposes required ; that the food supplied was
of good quality and sufficient; that it was well
cooked, and that its distribution was well adapted
for the wants of the patients; that the patients


were treated with kindness and humanity by the
surgeon-superintendent; that the attendants per-
formed their duties with pasience andiemper;
and that it was to be regretted that, for want
of pioper accommodation, it was impossible to
classify the patients. Gould Dr. M'Crea go be
hind that document ? Why, he had now become
the principal witness for the plaintiff. He (the
Attorney-General) stood on ihat, report, and need
go no farther. One word about the appliances
for restraint. A great deal had been said about
the bags produced?that they were instru-
ments of torture; but what was the fact? Were
they worse than the fetters which had cu into
Carr?s flesh ? [Manacles produced and exhibited.]
Were not those manacles more fit for wild beasts
than men ? And because Dr. Bowie had substi
tuted a mild mode of treatment for one so re-
volting, he was called a monster of cruelty.
Those fetters were what Dr. Bowie had got rid
of. It was not to be supposed that the bag varied
according to the size of the pa ient. Its object
was night use?that during the absence of power
to make a classification, while accommodation
was deficient, the patients should not suffer.
There must have been some means adopted to
save the patients, who would throw away their
clothes on a cold night, and stay exposed to the
weather ; and what were the means adopted ? A
patient was put into a loose bag, rolled in sheets
and blankets, so that whatever occurred he would
be like a snail, carrying his protection against the
weather with him wherever he went. Which was the
more humane?the chains or the warm bag ?
How were the bags to be dispensed with, unless
they strapped the bedclothes down ? The jury
had been told of filthy deposits in them ; but if a
patient could do no more than stay in bed, some-
thing must happen. Some lunatics would soil
those bags, who would, of course, soil their
clothes as well. Talk of restraint with manacles.
Let the jury look at one picture, and then
on that. Which was the most humane?the
fetters or the bags with pockets, which Dr.
M'Crea recommended in his own repor ?
Dr. M'Crea, in his evidence, expressed an
opinion that the bags produced in court
were prepared for the purpose ; but the jury had
heard what Dr. Bowie had said, that they were
those in ordinary use, and were not fetched from
the factory, as the counsel for the defendant
wished to make out. Padlocks were used occa-
sionally, but very seldom. It was usual to put
them on when the patient had blisters on bis
head. The jury were not to regard the use of
those bags as a punishment at all; nor were
they so much for restraint as for comfort.
An institution like this was not under one per-
son only. If a thing was done, it had to receive the
sanction of the board. Every act had to be ratified
even by the chief medical officer. There was no
getting out of that. Gould he go behind his own
report ? Surely not. The Attorney-Gereral,
after narrating and commenting upon the prin-
cipal facts contained in the evidence given by
Morgan Irwin and Cowley, asked the jury
to recollect the state of the wards at the
time when this alleged negligence took place-
how crowded they were; and how when the cot-
tage system came into vogue, when the more
quiet patients were enabled to live more com-
fortably, to group themselves together, to get
little domestic comforts, such as knives and
forks, to live like small families, their position
became improved, and their health settled.
As to the improvement of the place,
there was always shown a progressive
improvement as the facilities increased.
Everything that could be done was done,
and as the buildings sprang up, and the
appliances improved, so did the condition of the
patients. As for the padded room, it could not
be got. It was not enough to stuff a room with
s?raw and canvas ; that might be] torn down in a
flay. Padded rooms were made of leather and
indiarubber, and these could not begot. When all
the patients were huddled together how were such
appliances to be procured ? There was no room
for them then, but when they could be obtained
they were got ready for use. It was of no
use to complain, because impossibilities could
not be performed. He would call their attention
to Dr. Bowie?s own description of the place.
[The Attorney-General then quoted from Dr.
Bowie?s evidence, to show that when that gentle-
man took charge of the asylum, in 1852, the con-
dition of the institution was very inr erfect.]
There were no wooden cottages at the time, but
only stone buildings. The general condition of
the patients was very bad. The first addition to
the buildings was a double row of cottages in the
yard. There were no trained nurses, except two
or three, and he was obliged to take in inexpe-
rienced persons. Dr. Bowie then entered into
the minutiae of what had been done since. With
regard to the character of the evidence given by
Coates and Dr. Carr, he wished to make a few
observations. He did not wish to enter into any
physiological remarks unnecessarily; but when he
saw men brought up there labouring under a dis-
ease, and they (the jury) were told, because
those men could give a narrative, that they were
to rely upon it, and to take it as proceeding
from sound and sane persons, he felt bound to
call attention to the result of his own reading.
The law with regard to lunatics had been
stationary for some centuries, and some dogmas
had forced themselves into the courts. The
favourite theory had been that of a special mad-
ness -that a man might be mad on one point and
sane on others; but that was opposed to all
modern science. It was now believed that mad-
ness was not a degree of disease, but a kind of
disease, and that, in point of fact, any
particular symptom was more a symptom of
a diseased mind than of a mind diseased
?that the mind might be overthrown by
disturbing the equilibrium of the body;
experiments had been made by which different
effects were produced by removing the different
hemispheres of the brain. In point of fact, what
was considered madness was an exploded theory ;
nothing more nor less than a secondary disease,
and nothing more than a nervous disease, without
physical pain. Hence it was that not very long
ago Lord Lyndhurst, that venerable judge whose
intellect had overstepped the limits of technical
knowledge, laid down the proposition which he
(the Attorney-General) now endeavoured to put
forth. It was in giving judgement on the case of
Sir John Nicholls. That proposition was selected
by the highest living legal authorities in England,
and was in accordance with the opinions of all
who had made that particular branch of science


their study. He would ask them whether, be-
cause a man was suffering from delirium, because
he called himself our Saviour?a common delu-
sion- or the Emperor Bonaoarte, they would call
him in to see heir children, or their wives,
or themselves, simply oecause he had not proved
himself to be a mad doctor as yet? It was absurd ;
and the laws in our books were mere dogmas, and
could not alter physiological facts. He put it to
them whether, when they saw men exhibit such
symptoms as those made out, they were not
labouring under a delusion?the one external,
and the other imaginary ? Taking the case put
before them of Dr. Johnson, or Martin Luther;
they might be under a delusion or illusion,
but there was nothing to denote madness.
If it was accompanied by such symp oms as were
seen in the other cases?with violence--he would
say that, whether Martin Luther or Dr. Johnson,
he was a madman. He would say that with those
men the will never lost its power, and that theirs
was merely a harmless delusion ; but when they
once found a person like Dr. Carr or Coates, he
would ask them not to implicitly tru t him. It
came to ihe part of Lord Erskine?before be was
Lord Erskine -to defend a man named James
Hadtield, who fired at George the Third in the
Drury-lane Theatre. Mr. Erskine then took
occasion to read a report of a case which took
place in the time of Lord Mansfield?who, although
he had re ired from the bench, was then alive,
and furnished it to Mr. Erskine?in the address
to the jury:?? A man of the name of Wood had
indicted Dr. Munro for keeping him as a prisoner
(I believe in the same madhouse, at Hoxton)
when he was sane. He underwent the most
severe examination by defendant?s counsel with-
out exposing his complaint; but Dr. Baitie having
come upon the bench by me, and Laving desired
me to ask him what had become of the Princess
whom he had corresponded wi h in cherry-juice,
he showed in a moment what he was. He
answered that there was nothing at all in that,
because having been (as every one knew) impri-
soned in a high tower and being debarred the use
of ink, he had no o her means of correspondence
but by writing his letters in cherry-juice, and
throwing them into the river which surrounded
the tower, where the princess received them in
a boat. There existed, of course, no tower,
no imprisonment, no writing in cherry-juice,
no river, no boat; but the whole was the
inveterate phantom of a morbid imagina-
tion. I immediately directed Dr. Munro
to be acquit ed ; but this man Wood, being a
merchant in Philpot-lane, and having been car-
ried through the city on his way to the mad-
house, indicted Dr. Munro over asain for the
trespass and imprisonment in London, knowing
he bad lost his cause by speaking of the Princess
at Westminster; and such is the extraordinary
subtlety and cunning of madmen, that when he
Was cross examined on the tnal in London, as he
had successfully been before, in order to expose
his madness, all the ingenuity of the bar, and all
the authority of the Court, could not make him
say a single syllable upon that topic which had
put an end lo the indictment before, although he
still had the same indelible impression on his
mind, as he signified to those who were near him ;
but, conscious that 'be delusion had caused bis
defeat at Westminster, he most obstinately per-
sisted in holding it back.? That was a case of a
person exhibiting monomania, and remembering
things which never existed. Apply that theory
to some of the witnesses who bad been before
them?to the bug doctrine?to the remains of
human bodies being hung upon trees ?and to the
scattering about of bones and skulls, and what
would they say ?He might be insane, they might
say, on those things; but it was a fact that mad-
men remembered things which never occurred.
He would further say, upon that topic of in-
sanity, i hat he found i' laid down, in the course
of his reading, by Pritchard, a distinguished
writer, that if a man got well, during a lucid
interval he supposed sense was restored ; but
why did be get ill again ? That showed it was
a constitutional disease. Transferring his ob-
servations from man to horse, he would ask them
whether they would buy a horse with a bad
constitution, when he had shown a bad gland ?
Let them apply the remarks of Lord Mansfield
as sensible men. Dr, Carr never showed him-
self insane as a professional man, but would they
call him in as a doctor ?If they would not, let
them not allow him to take away the character of
that respectable gentleman whose reputation was
assailed. Having asked them to do that, that
was all he intended to say on that physiological
subject. He would not go through the evidence
of Dr. Carr or Coates, as they were unreliable
witnesses, and were not to be believed. He would
not impugn their veracity?he [would not dignify
them by using such a word. Far be it from
him to wish to hurt that gentleman, and it was
painful to him when he put the question about
? Plantagenet.? He then touched the chord,
and the witness took a piece of paper, and wrote
upon it. They saw vhat. He was sorry for it;
especially as Dr. Carr had been bad ever since.
Having discussed those theories regarding men-
tal affections, he would say a few words, before
concluding the case, generally upon the libel.
There were several witnesses who had spoken
generally upon the ninth and ten'h pleas,
and he had no inten ion of wearying their
patience with again going through them. Look-
ing at all the circumstances, he would first ask
hem whether the defendant had made out his
pleas of justification ? Whether he had sus-
tained the position he bad taken up as
a public journalist, of stating facts which
were wholly incorrect ?He was prepared to say
that there was some of the evidence to be be-
lieved in on the other side? that there was a
want of proper attention. But was there any-
thing to justify the libeller at one moment calling
Dr. Bowie a cunning old man, and next saying
he had no desire to blame him ?It stated on the
face of the libel that he was aware of the brutali*
ties and cruelties which were carried on, but that
by dint of political influence he endeavoured to
keep them silent. Had that been justified ? Was
not vir. Heales, the late Chief Secretary, ex-
amined, and could* he tell ihem of any act
referred to in the article ? Was he to be charged
an old man, the father of a family, and whose
foot was now on the brink of the grave?was he
to be charged with brutal inhumanity for political
purposes ? Was that a statement for a newspaper
to make?a statement which would bring ruin on
families? If there were dirty bags, if the pa-
tients were not clean, was that any reason for


going beyond mismanagement, and saying that
he kept up inhumanity for political purposes?
The very man ( Mr. Heales) was in the box, and
he was not asked a word about it - about what
appeared in the leading article. | The Attorney-
General then read a portion of the leading article
which referred to political influences ] Tons bad
Dr. Bowie been driven into court, to vindicate his
character. 4le could not help doing so, as no
Government could allow him to do otherwise;
and the committee could not continue their re-
port. He would not enter in o that report, but
they might go on the other side, and might
imagine such a thing as a report favour-
able to the individual. They could imagine
what it was. It was said in the libel, ?We are
curious to know what reply Dr. Bowie will make."
Pending the very inquiry referred to there, and
in contemplation of a further report being made,
the pa riot stepped in with his newspaper, and
cut and hacked about everything before him,
assailing Dr. Bowie and the Parliament. And
should not such a man be visited with pun-
ishment for those things. When they came to
consider them, let him not escape with mere
nominal damages. He had not gone there
to ask for vindictive damages, for though
Dr. Bowie was not a rich man, he did not go
there to make money. He would ask for exem-
plary damages, and show the press, which assumed
to look after the public gwd, that they were
not to overstep their portion, and assail the
priva e character of any person. He had taken
great interest in the contest. His client was
drawn into it. He did not go there willingly.
He would rather not have gone. Gould anyone
look upon his grey hairs?could they consider all
he had gone through? how, af er years of faithful
service to the public, he had been maligned
and slandered?how his grey hairs might be
brought down to the grave?without punish
ing the man by whom he had been libelled ?
He relied upon the interposition of the verdict of
the jury to prevent such a result. He had now
done his duty. He trusted he had done it like a
man, having respect for age?having respect for a
man old enough to be his father?a man who had
been engaged all his life in humane actions. That
man having passed forty years in the exercise of
his profession, without a stain on his reputation
and character, had lived to come to this country
to be assailed by a vile, malicious slanderer, dis-
guised underthe anonymous word ? We." Heasked
the jury to remember these things. He entreated
them not to let any calculation as to the bias of the
paper it fluence their decision. They were on
their oath* ?they sat there as twelve men?and
he believed that twelve men could not be found
who, on the facts which had been adduced in
evidence in this inquiry, would hesitate to give
such damages as would vindic*te the character
of his client, and have the effect of repressing
the system of libelling pursued on the part of
the defendant. No special pleading, he thought,
could eventuate in any other result. He then
had done his duty, and he asked the jury to re-
member theirs.
Slight applause was expressed at the close of
the Attorney-General?s address, but it was im-
mediately suppressed. '
The Chief Justice then summed up. He
first congratulated the jury on the fact that their
protracted labours were now approaching a ter-
mination, and then went on to observe that the
action was brought by Mr. Robert Bowie, sur-
geon superintendent of the Yarra Bend Asylum,
o recover damages for the publication of a libel
-y Mr. Edward Wilson, as proprietor or editor of
the Argus newspaper. There were three counts
in the declaration. To these the defendant
pleaded ? Not Guilty that he did not publish
the libel, or, rather, that the publication
was not made in the malicious manner
charged in the declaration ; and he also en-
tered several pleas of justification. [These
pleas the learned judge recited.] The jury
would see that, although it was nectssary to find
according to these partu u'ar circumstances, they
were not obliged to find in detail as to every cir-
cumstance set forth in the pleas, if they were
satisfied that the pleas were substantially proved.
True, the defendant was bound by his pleas, yet
the question for the jury to decide was, whether
they were substantially proved or not. In order
to ascertain this, the jury must first consider
what the pleas were a jus ification to. He
did not wish to read all the alleged libels.
It would be sufficient for him to notice 'he first.
This was dated the 10th September, 1861. [His
Honour read the article which appeared in The
Argus of hat date. J The second publication re-
ferred >o the case of Mrs. Steele ; and the third
repeated the charges about Mrs. Steele, and re-
ferred also to Mullens?s case, and went on to
express the hope that the whole matter should
be referred to a Royal commission, pointing out
that a Parliamentary committee was not the body
to institute such an inquiry, and decide upon such
charges, and concluding by declaring,? ? So only
can the colony be cleared from the great dis-
grace of Yarra Bend as hitherto conducted."
Now, in his opinion, th- se three publications,
taking them as a whole, amounted substantially to
this : ?? Here is a certain public institution in
which we are all interested, conducted in an im-
proper manner ; transactions take place there
which ought not to be tolerated. The plaintiff is
'he surgeon superintendent of the Government;
and the Government, instead of inquiring into the
matter, and removing him,allows him to remain;
and we feel it onr duty to write on this subject,
and write as forcibly as we can, at the same time
citing the of the witnesses who have been
examined." There was no allusion whatever
to the personal or private character of the
plaintiff Beyond the immorality necessarily
involved in the neglect of public duty, there
was no immorality charged against the plain-
tiff. It was on his public character, in the
discharge of his duties as surgeon-superinten-
dent, tba' that was a libel, if a libel at all. It
said in effect, that the asylum under his super-
intendence was disgracefully conducted, and that
he was amenable for it. He (the Chief Justice)
must say that in bis opinion the article was tem-
perate and moderate. He could not conceive
any subject more calculated to enlist the sympa-
thies of any man, he >ared not whom, than that
of the unfortunate inmates of a lunatic ai-ylum
being treated in the way described in the evi-
dence quoted. It was important to consider
bat, because on both sides, very fairly, 'he
sympathies of the jury were sought to be
enlisted. The plaintiff had been described to


them as an aged man, but that should not in-
fluence their decision. Public men were public
property, and public institutions were public
property. The higher a man was raised in public
life, the more exposed he was to public censure, if
he deserved it. All men delighted in the praise
of their fellow men; but how were public men to
be favoured or censured, as the case might be,
except through the instrumentality of ihe public
journalist? Therefore, if the present plaintiff
was an aged man, or if, in consequence of his
age, he was unequal to the discharge of the
duties of an office which required the most
extreme activity and vigilance if Govern-
ment had improperly kept him there beyond the
time he ought to have been so kept?that was a
matter for the Government- If the plaintiff had
grown old in the public service, the country
should properly provide for him. But what an-
swer was that to these charges, if they were true ?
If the charges were not true, there was an end
to the case. Supposing any of their friends were
inmates of the asylum, what consolation would
it be to them to be told,?? True, your friends
have not been properly managed?the asylum
has not been conducted in a desirable way?but
then the superintendent is a very old man ?"
What answer was that ? Any one with com
mon humanity must feel for an aged man,
but that was not the question for the jury. In
such a case, iheir feelings might be wrongly di-
rected, and they might in consequence be guilty
of an act of great injustice or great cruelty. He
alluded to this in order to disabuse the minds of
the jury of any impression that might have been
made upon them by the speeches of counsel.
They must take a high and broad view of the
case. The probable results of their verdict,
which had been sketched before their minds,
ought to have no effect upon them. They had
to give their verdict according to the evidence.
If the publication were a libel, and it were only a
libel on a public man, they must look upon i
in that light. Jf they satisfied themselves as to
what the publication was, they had to say whether
the pleas on the record were substantially proved
or not. That was the simple issue before them ;
and if they allowed their minds to be drawn from
that issue?either to one side or the other?they
would not discharge the solemn duty imposed
upon them. It was a difficult task to have to
scrutinize the mass of evidence placed before
them?a vas deal of which was beside the ques
tion?in order to de ermine the issue, whether
the charges put forward by the defendant were
substantiated or not. There was no ques
tion that the evidence on both sides was fairly
Open to comment. On the one side were
discharged attendants and men afflicted with
lunacy ; while, on the other hand, me plaintiff
relied on persons still in his employ. The jury
had to consider what the evicence in each parti-
cular case was worth. There was no doubt that
poor human na ure was apt to look favourably
Ml a par icular case, if tha case clos.-ly and imi-
tuately affected himself. They were not to sup
pose that a man, because he was a discharged
servant, would say that which was false; still he
might magnify little peccadilloes into large
offences. On the other hand, they were not to
lay that a man in a good situation, and rectiviog
a large salary, would not tell the truth, although
it was probable?indeed, it was only human
nature?that he would look favourably on a case
which concerned himself. These observations
were applicable to a great portion of the evidence
given on each side; but the objections arising
therefrom might be easily disposed of. The jury
had to determine the credibility of men sffl cted
with insanity. On this point, he (the Chief Jus-
tice) must confess that he was in no way impressed
with the observations made by the Attorney-
General in his very elaborate and able speech.
He could not understand why it was necessary
for the jury to determine whether Dr. Carr
was afflicted with monomania or not, or
what was the precise nature of his in-
sanity. The law said that nothing should
be shut out from the jury. The evidence,
whether it were that of an interested man, a
criminal, or a lunatic, went to thun; and they
would say what weight they attached to it. He
did not think that, as far as the evidence went,
the jury were to look at Carr as labouring under
monomania. The evidence went rather to show
that Carr was an insane man, with lucid intervals.
Did the jury believe that the time Carr was in the
box was a lucid interval ? Was it corroborated, or
was it not ? Was it a part of the story supported
by other evidence, or did it s and by itself? Was
it a consistent stor> ? Madmen were clever, and
frequently showed their cleverness in ways most
astonishing ; but it required an exceedii gly clever
man to invent a thoroughly consistent tale?a
tale not founded upon fact. The story of Dr.
Carr related to times gone by?in fact, to times
so far back that, until he saw the publication re-
ferred to what took place in 1858 and 1859, and
anterior years, he thought the evidence not ad-
missible. The jury beard Dr. Carr refer to par-
ticular dates and then give his evidence, a d it
would be for them to say whether the story was
a consistent one. With regard to Mr Coa es,
he would only observe that that man, although
formerly in the asylum, was now a discbaiged
patient, and therefore, to be regarded as
sane. This being so, he (the Chief Justice) could
not understand the observances relating to
Coates? evidence. He could not see any dif-
ficulty whatever in a man now sane remember-
ing what took place during a paroxysm of in-
sanity. On the contrary, the evidence pointed
to his fact? that a man recovered from insanity
remembered wi h singular particularity during
his life all that took place in those paroxysms.
Assuming that Coates was insane during bis re-
sidence in the institution, he was now sane.
There was nothing in bis demeanour to show that
he was insane. He was examined and cross-ex-
amined, without betraying a want of sanity. N >w
befoie considering the portions of evidence relat-
ing to each particular case, he (the Chief Jus-
uce) desired to make one .or two observations
referring to the evidence generally. The de-
fendant asser.ed that be was jus ified in the pub-
lication of the alleged libel because certain facts
were true. These were specified, and issue was
joined on them. Evidence had been adduced ia
proof of hem, and evidence had been brought to
contradict them. This included a mass of general
evidence; but if the jury were sati tied that any
par icular fact was proved, general evidence
was worthless to contradict it. It only ren-
dered the particulars of the charge specified tm-


probable. He could not describe it better than
by reference to what took place every day
in criminal courts. A larceny is proved against
a man, and he calls witnesses to character. He
did not wish by these observations to have it sup-
posed that he disregarded general evidence; but
when they came to nice distinct issues, on which
they had to pronounce ?aye" or ?nay,?he could
only invite their attention to the evidence bear-
ing on those issues. Let them take, for instance,
the question about the distribution of the food.
If one witness, whom they believed, spoke to a
particular transaction on a particular occasion,
what was the use, comparatively speaking,
of a host of witnesses who deposed gene-
rally to what look place some years after-
wards? It might be said that it was very
improbable that an institution apparently so
well conducted should be lax in this particular
instance. But did they or did they not believe
this evidence ? If they did, he did not see how
they could get over it. He begged to invite the
attention of the jury to these distinct issues ; and
to remind them that, with regard o the particular
institution which formed the subject of the
inquiry, there was no harm in general deductions
being drawn from particular instances. Allusion
had been made to the board of visitors. Bu'
how were they to go behind the scenes in all
the transactions taking place in a public
institution of this kind ? No one could
do it. Yisitois might go at particular
hours, and inspect as closely and carefully as
they pleased ; bu% in the meantime, a man
might be confined in a particular cell which they
did not visit, or something might be going on of
which they were not aware. Therefore, it was
not unfair to say that any par icular instances
which might have been adduced were inconsistent
with ihe proper and vigilant management of an
institution of the kind. A particular instance
was proved, and it was met by general evidence,
given by witnesses who did not happen to be
present at the particular transaction. Visitors,
medical men, and clergymen had been examined,
and the effect of their evidence was to render
the defendant?s story improbable. But the
specific instances had not been dis urbed by the
general evidence. General charges were very
fairly met by general answers; and if the alleged
libel had sta'ed generally that the surgeon-
superintendent was unfit for his office, and if
only some minute and trivial instances had been
brought forward in support of the charge,general
evidence might have been sufficient to answer
it. But special and particular instances of mis-
manaiement might be given coincident with
general evidence of an opposite character. These,
however, were two parallel lines which never met.
Both were perfectly true. The general evidence
might be as correct as possible ; the witnesses who
spoke to it might be detailing simply what they
witnessed; but how did that touch the other?
It occurred at different times, and there was an
end of it. He would now come to the issues which
the jury really had to decide in this matter.
Evidence was brought on one side or the other,
with reference to what the defendant alleged as
a form of peculations?'hat was to say, that
the servants about the establishment were used
by the plaintiff for his private purposes, that
food which belonged to the patients was given to
his poul?ry, and that other such charges were
made against him. In his (the Chief Justice's)
opinion, that evidence was not in issue, and al-
though the plaintiff called evidence to answer it,
this matter ouvht to be shut out altogether. It
was not in issue before 'he jury, and they must lay
itononeside. Hedidno know what conclusion they
might arrive at upon i his matter if it was in issue;
but it was not in issue, and they could not con-
sider it. Coming then to the second count, the
charge which it contained was substantially that
Mrs. Steele became pregnant whilst she was a
patient. He certainly concurred with the Attorney-
General?s observations on this matter ; and if the
jury believed that it was a libel, he though? the plea
of justification was not supported. The plea was,
substantially, that Mrs. Steele was a patient, and
that she became pregnant while a patient. Ac-
cording to her own statement, after she was dis-
charged, she was retained?whether properly or
improperly, the jury need not consider?as a ser-
vant in the instiution, and she then became
pregnant. Supposing the plea were made out,
all that it amounted to was evidence of laxity of
management ; for, whether the circumstance
happened with violence, or from the immorality
of the parties concerned, was not the question ;
but the question simply was?such occur-
rences ought not to take place in a well-
manared institution. In his opinion, all that it
proved was, tha it did take place between ser-
vants, and although there was certainly evidence
here to go before the jury of mismanagement,
yet it did not support the particular plea of
justification, and the publication?if in the
opinion of the jury it was a libel?was not justi-
fiable. Upon the second count, therefore, the
plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. What damages
they would give, if they found against the plain-
tiff on the other issues, was a matter left to the
determination of the jury. All 'he publications
had reference, not to the plaintiff?s private estab-
lishment, but to his management of a public in-
stitu ion, and what damages they would con-
sider the plaint ff entitled to if they merely
gave him a verdict on 'his particular count, he
would leave the jury to decide. A portion of the
third count was a repetition of the second, and the
same observations which he had made on the
second would apply to ii also. He would give
the jury a skeleton of the several pleas and issues
before they retired to consider their verdict.
They were at liberty to find, if they pleased, on
this count, what was termed a distributory ver-
dict?that is, a verdict partly for the plaintiff and
partly for the defendant. The third count, as he
had already remarked, contained a reped-
tion of Mrs. Steele?s case. The remainder
of it alluded to Mullens?s case, to the un-
fitness and incompetency of the plaintiff, and
to the asylum being a disgrace to the colony,
(laving already substan rally disposed of Mrs.
Steele?s case, he would next call attention to the
alleged unfitness and incompe ency of the plain-
tiff to manage this institution ; and that question
must be decided upon the evidence as to what
took place at the institution. First, then, as
regarded the bags and 1 he management of them.
The use of the ba/ might have been very well
intended, but if it allowed an attendant to inflict
cruelty upon a patient at his will, he (the Chief
Justice) thought it was a relic of the barbarous


ages. He confessed that a waistcoat with the long
sleeves, capable of being tied behind the back of the
patient, did not seem to be a proper thing. He
could not see why it was necessary to continue
this at all, or why the same object could not have
been achieved by the waistcoat. A witness was
asked by one of the learned counsel, Mr. Fellows,
as to the cases in which patients? hands were tied
behind their backs, and the answer was that they
were tied according,to the degree of violence mani-
fested by the patients. He (the learned judge)
thought this ought not to have been at the option
of the attendant. If the jury thought it was
absolutely necessary, then it was justifiable;
but he thought that it should not have been
left to the option of an attendant to
tie a patient?s hands behind him when he
thought it was necessary, and it did appear to
him that the end might have been gained by the
jacket, without sleeves, or, rather, with the largo
pocket inside, into which the sleeves went. And
what was that bag ? Was that necessary ? It
was stated that it was necessary in order to keep
the patients warm; but was there no other suffi-
cient device ? What was there to prevent, as
had been suggested by some of the witnesses, a
coverlet being thrown over the patient in bed, in
such a way that he could not throw the clothes
off?that the patient should be covered with can-
vas, stitched across to prevent the blanket being
thrown off? Was a man who was labouring
under irritation and excitement likely to be more
irritated by being forced into this bag ? If a pa-
tient were put quietly to bed, and covered with a
strong coverlet, which was strapped down, and if
an attendant watched the patient, what was the
necessity for the bag ? That which was not ne-
cessary was cruel. He did not mean to say that
the jury should adopt the view which seemed to
have been taken by one class of witnesses,
namely, that all mechanical restraint should be
done away with; but, at the same time. Dr.
Bowie was bound to bring a proper amount of
skill to bear upon the management of the insti-
tution, and he was bound to use appliances and
means by which the possibility of cruelty could
be prevented. If the jury thought these bags
were necessary, then their use was justifiable,
but they could not say that their use was justifi-
able if the plaintiff merely said he had recourse
to them because he could not devise any other
method. This was not the only course which
could have been pursued. The management of
other asylums led to the contrary conclusion ;
and, as far as could bo gathered from the evi-
dence, the bags were not known elsewhere; in
fact, that they were, he was ashamed to say,
limited to Victoria. He had made these obser-
vations with reference to the use, or rather the
abuse, of the bag generally ; and he would now
fo to each particular case, Hebert?s case was the
rst on the record. He would rather invite their
attention to the cases generally. He had classi-
fied them as well as he could under their par-
ticular heads, and he would apply them to each
particular accouut. Following the issues raised by
the pleas would only distract their attention, and
not enable them to comprehend the evidence so
clearly, or follow him so distinctly. He would
ask the jury to find the verdict on the different
counts. The case to which he now invited their
attention referred particularly to cruelty by the
abuse of these bags. Before he went to that, he
would say one word about cruelty. It had been
said that the plaintiff had been represented as a
cruel man. He could see no such representa-
tion ; but any one of the jury would see in a
moment that a man at the head of bis establish-
ment, who was not a competent man, or not a
vigilant man, might by his acts entail cruelty.
If there was not such organization and manage-
ment as to prevent the attendants practising
cruelty, the most humane man might be cruel?
that was to say, his want of supervision might
result in cruel acts. In that way only, as he
understood it, was the plaintiff charged with
cruelty. The plaintiff seemed to be a man
of humane disposition; but if he was not
as vigilant as he ought to be?if he had
not the whole establishment under his control?
if he allowed the lunatics to be treated by the
attendants as the attendants wished?what was
that but being, in effect, cruel? The weakest
men in government, as he had said before, were
sometimes guity of acts, from their very want of
vigilance, which led to the greatest cruelty, even
though they were of a most humane disposition.
To go back to Hebert?s case. That case was
supported by Dr. Carr, and almost by him alone.
He had stated that Hebert was confined in a bag
unnecessarily before his death, and that he
suffered cruelty in consequence. Dr. Bowie
and Morgan Irwin contradicted this, and the jury
must decide between the evidence. There was
one very singular point connected with this
matter which rendered it necessary that the jury
should examine it more closely than, perhaps,
they would otherwise have been disposed to do.
Carr spoke to the cruel treatment of Hebert,
but there were two witnesses against him;
and the jury might, therefore, not be dis-
posed to attach much weight to his evi-
dence. It was, however, a singular thing
that Carr should have applied to Dr. Bowie to bo
allowed to give evidence at the inquest which was
held in Herbert?s case, and, as he said, he was
prevented from doing so. Dr. Bowie said that
Carr did apply to him, and that he (Dr. Bowie)
told him that he might give evidence, but that
Carr did not do so. Carr seemed to be the most
impulsive, pugnacious man naturally that he (the
Chief Justice) ever saw. He appeared to be a
man determined to speak everything he thought
without restraint; and it did seem extraordinary
that he should have had permission to give evi-
dence, and yet he did not do so. If this permis-
sion were given by Dr. Bowie to Dr. Carr, why
did he not avail himself of it ? Did the jury think
it was likely he would do so ? But for this cir-
cumstance, he should not have called any parti-
cular attention to Hebert?s case. He left it to
the jury to say whether it did not present a very
different aspect to what it would nave done if it
bad rested merely upon Carr?s unsupported evi-
dence alone. Then there was Carr?s own case,
which was ushered in by his own statement. The
jury bad heard Carr's evidence, and if it were
not the truth, it was a most touching tale. They
had heard him describe the sufferings which he
had gone through, and the outrages which he had
been subjected to. They had heard his descrip-
tion of the night when he lay upon one side until
the sweat fell from him, and then turned to the
other side with the same result, until at last the


keeper relieved him ; and that he was subjected
to such outrages that he prayed to the Almighty
to relieve him. Was that necessary? Did the
jury believe that or not? That particular instance
was not corroborated by any other witness, but
the fact that he was subject to restraint was sup-
ported by Dr. M'Grea, and a reference was made
to Dr. Barker. That reference had not been
contradicted. Dr. M'Crea stated that he found
Carr under restraint which he thought was cruel.
The jury had heard the comments made upon
Dr. M?Crea?s evidence. There might, unfortu-
nately, have been a quarrel between Dr. M'Crea
and Dr. Bowie, but he did not suppose that, in
consequence of that quarrel, either one or the other
of those gentlemen had told the jury what was
not the truth. But it did not rest upon
Dr. M'Crea?s evidence alone. He said he found
Dr. Carr in a bag, which he (Dr, M?Crea) had
never sanctioned, and there was a reference made
to Dr. Barker. Dr. Carr had told them that he
was subjected to confinement; that the board
visited him, and directed him to be released; that
he was released ; that Dr. Bowie afterwards di-
rected him to be confined again ; that he was
confined again, but that he was afterwards seen
by Dr. Barker, who came suddenly and unex-
pectedly, and that Dr, Barker directed him to be
released, and he was released, and expressed his
gratitude to that gentleman that he was released.
That was not contradicted. There was no evi-
dence to contradict that final release. Why was
the second incarceration necessary ? Dr. Bowie
said that he anticipated excitement ?that he
anticipated Carr would be violent. Although
one might recoil from the use of the articles which
had been instruments of restraint, just as one
would recoil from the manacles which had been
exhibited, the use of them was not the question
so much as the abuse of them. If a man were
improperly put into a bag or sack, he was sub-
jected to cruelty. If the unfortunate inmates of
the asylum were not to be properly treated, why
send them there at all ? If the place was intended
merely for confinement, and not for cure, they
might be kept in the gaols. If that cold-blooded
view were to be taken of the duty towards these
unfortunate creatures, they might be kept in
gaol safely and securely, and at much less expense
than in the asylum. What was the asylum for ?
To cure them. Restraint might be necessary for
that cure, sacks and confinement might be, but
the object of the asylum was cure ; and anything
which restrained the patients unnecessarily was
cruel. After Dr. Carr?s case came Lang?s case. This
was supported by Carr, and by Carr alone. He (the
Chief Justice) would leave the jury to deal with
it. They had heard Carr?s evidence with respect
to it?how that one night he heard a noise in
Lang?s cell, that he heard a footstep in the ward,
and a strap or buckle driven along the ground;
that he heard a man knocked down, and a cry
for water, and the expression, ? Not a drop.?
That was contradicted by Dr. Bowie, and it was un-
supported by any evidence except that of Carr
himself. He must leave the jury to deal with
that. Then there was M'Donald?s case, which,
though not opened particularly in the pleas, had
been accepted by both parties. This case was
supported by Dr. Whittenbury?s evidence. Dr.
Whittenbury stated that the. patient was naked,
with the exception of a jacket, in a stone cell.
If it were necessary to preserve him from tearing
his clothes, why were not his clothes on him
as well as the jacket ? The circumstances
witnessed by Dr. Whittenbury produced a
lasting impression on his mind, and, accord-
ing to his evidence, they must have produced
a lasting impression upon anyone?s mind who
heard the evidence. Did the jury believe him ?
And if the description given by Dr. Whittenbury
were true, was such a state of things necessary ?
Why was the man without clothing? It was
painful to his mind to hear the attempted excuse
as regarded this matter. Were they to reject this
evidence because there was an aperture in the
cell, and not a grating ? Dr. Bowie?s mind was a
blank as to the occasion altogether. They heard
the observations which the learned counsel, Mr,
Michie, had made on this subject?that it indi-
cated that these things were constantly occurring
before Dr. Bowie. They would say whether it
was necessary that M'Donald should have been
in this state; and if it were not necessary, it was
cruel. Nothing was known about M?Donald, ex-
cept that he was a violent man, and a dangerous
man; and it was therefore necessary that some
precautions should be taken to prevent him
committing violence. But why was he in
this state?without clothes ? Was it neces-
sary that he should be in a stone cell, in
the middle of the day, without clothes ?
The particular mode in which he was seized by
the attendants was not of so much importance as
the condition in which he was found in the cell.
He (the Chief Justice) could understand the sug-
gestion made on behalf of the plaintiff, that it
was more merciful to send four men to overpower
the lunatic at once than to send an insufficient
force, and thus probably cause the patient to be
exasperated by the resistance which he would
offer. It was not a question of whether one or
two attendants were sent, or four attendants, al-
though it would appear from the description given
that more violence was used than was necessary
in throwing the unfortunate man on the ground ;
but the great question was as to the condition in
which the unfortunate man was found. The
plaintiff?s mind was a blank as regarded Dr.
Whittenbury?s evidence, and he had not called a
single witness who spoke to this case. Leaving
M'Donald, he came next to Mullens?s case. That
case had been referred to another tribunal?
a coroner?s jury. That fact was before them,
and had been commented upon; but he always
regretted, on the trial of any case, that any
reference should be made to an inquiry by
another tribunal upon the same subject. It was
an unintentional insult to their common sense to
say that they must be governed by the decision
of another tribunal. They did not know what
evidence was before the coroner?s jury ; they
could not dive into their minds; and it might be
that, though they had arrived at one conclusion
upon certain evidence, they might arrive at a
different conclusion now. He invited them to
give their close attention to this case, and
to give their verdict upon it apart from
anything which they had previously heard, and
be guided entirely by the testimony which had
been adduced before them. The case of Mullens
was put in two pleas, which were substantially
to this effect?Mullens received certain injuries
before he went into the asylum, or after he went.


If he received them after, they were inflicted by
the attendants, by other patients, or by the
man himself. In any case, there was negli-
gence. This was the way in which the
defendant put his case ?if the injuries were
inflicted by the attendants, there was gross negli-
gence ; if by the other patients, there was negli-
gence ; and if by himself, they should have been
discovered. Though it might affect the amount
of negligence in one sense, in his opinion it was
not essentially necessary that they should deter-
mine by whom the injuries were inflicted, because
if they believed that three of Mullens?s
ribs had been broken after he went to
the asylum, they would say whether they
did not think some explanation ought to
have been given as to how this did occur.
There was the evidence of Mr. Rudall; and there
was the evidence of a man named Young, an
attendant, who washed Mullens, and stated cir-
cumstantially the injuries which he observed on
his body, namely?a black eye, a sore on the
elbow (partially dried), and a mark round
each wrist. Mr. Rudall, who examined the body,
describes, in addition to the broken ribs, in-
juries on various parts ?on his side, on
his back, on his legs?all of them fresh.
But put the ribs on one side. They had been told
that Mullens died from injuries inflicted. Now,
the breaking of three ribs would not kill a man,
unless he was suffering very badly indeed from
other causes. Those other injuries must have
been very many to have caused death. They
were spoken of as abscesses resulting from other
injuries, all of recent date. When Young was
asked if Mullens could have inflicted those in-
juries upon himself, he replied, that he thought
the man could; and, following that train of idea,
he (the learned judge) asked the witness what
kind of bed the patient was lying on, because it
was probable the man might have thrown himself
continually on to the floor, inflicted injuries on
himself by so doing, and said nothing about it.
There were many instances in which the imagi-
nation, acted upon by a particular mania, might
have disposed a lunatic to commit such acts; but,
if he did commit them, the fact ought to be known.
Was a man to die from injuries, of the infliction
of which there was to be no explanation whatever ?
There was evidence which made it just possible
that Mullens might have inflicted the injuries
himself. He had been described as a restless
and destructive man, and also as a man who had
once been seen to be cruel towards another
patient. The problem which required solution
was this. The man had received injuries. Were
those injuries of recent date ? It was sworn by
those who performed the post-mortem examina-
tion, that he did receive them recently; but
where did the man come from ? How did the in-
injuries occur ? Was the Court to hear nothing
about them ? If either view was taken, the go-by
was given to the medical evidence, which could
not be discarded. Did the jury believe the evi-
dence of Mr, Rudall and Dr. Thomas 1 It
seemed to him that their evidence was deserving
of consideration, because they had actually seen
the body, and he did not care for the whole faculty
if they bad not seen it. What did the evidence
of Dr. Turnbull and Mr. Gillbee say ? They <
were cautious ; but everybody was cautious in
giving such opinions. One medical witness i
r said he did not know what to say, unless
i he made a post mortem examination. Why, the
? men who made that very examination had been
i called in court, and had said that the injuries
i must have been of recent date. If a stick was
broken, so it remained; but they all knew that
the ribs wore in such a position that they could
not overlap. They were kept in their places by
a number of membranes, and were bent back-
wards or forwards by the motion of the body.
Were those splinters, then, likely to remain long
in the same state ? It needed no medical men
nor medical evidence to suggest so simple a thing
as this. Medical testimony might be mistaken,
and he would leave the jury to believe Young or
disbelieve him. If Young had not undressed
Mullens and bathed him in the manner described,
it would have been a different matter, and the
doubts would have lain in a different direction.
Leaving Mullens?s case, he would come to that of
Melbourne. This man had been described as
a man who frequently attempted to escape,
and had been unnecessarily restrained. The
general evidence given in this matter was very
contradictory. He was said to have been under
restraint for five or six months, according to one
witness, and for a longer period according to
others. It appeared that he and another patient
named Hughes were fastened together by a pad-
lock. He could understand that device being
had recourse to. The two men had been plotting
together, and it was an object to make them dis-
like each other?s company, and so break up their
combination. They might, perhaps, have been
tied together, but as it was, they were jacketed
together- -a slight restraint, done with the best
intentions, and the jury were to say how far it
was justified. The case appeared to him in a
totally different light to some of the others.
Then Fitzgerald was described by Houghman as
having been improperly put into a bag, merely
because he was restless. Talking about the
bag, rendered it necessary to go back to that
in the first instance. Was it necessary, or
could the same object be gained another
way. Hughman said the man was treated very
cruelly by Conway, and Conway contradicted
him. Hughman said Fitzgerald was cruelly left
to lie in his own ordure, and could not be
washed for some two or three hours, and so on.
He would now come to the next class of cases,
and invite their attention to the alleged neglect
or inattention. It was alleged that a dying
patient was not attended to in his last moments.
Of course, it was impossible to be with a patient
continually, but that was no excuse for leaving
him to die alone. Then there was M?Coil?s case,
spoken to by Wainwright. It appeared that the
attendant did not know whether his patient was
dead or alive. Wainwright?s evidence was chal-
lenged, and as he (the Chief Justice) understood,
he was the only wi ness so challenged. He was
challenged on the ground that a person of the
name of Grant swore that he had expressed some
intention to injure the institution, and certainly
if he did so, it looked as it be were disposed to
carry his intention into execution. The whole
question, however, was one for the jury to con-
sider, and determine as to the credibility of
either party, Wainwright?s character and disposi-
tion, the length of time he had been absent
from the institution, and the possible absence


of all malice on that account. The words might
have been used years ago, and after all have been
only a casual observation. If Wainwright told
the truth, they would have to explain M?Coil?s
case as regards want of attention. There was a
person described as the Jack Ketch of the place
- he really did not know who the individual was.
This man was spoken of by Coates. They would
remember Coates?s description of that man?s last
moments, his dying groans, and body covered
with bruises, and no attendant with him when he
died. Four other cases, those of Germain,
Vicari, Ford, and Watson, were in somewhat the
same position, for, according to the evidence
adduced for the defendant, they were not
attended to when they ought to have been. One
ought to have had his ear lanced, another his
sores dressed and poulticed. Vicari was one of
these, and it was said he had not had poultices
on at all. Really he (the Chief Justice) could
not exactly follow all the evidence about this.
It did not appear to matter much, but it showed
the want of attention which was complained of,
and that the plaintiff?s attention had been di-
rected to it. One case ?that of Vicari?differed
from that of the others. According to Dr.
M'Grea, his legs were not poulticed, but, as soon
as the doctor was seen to have visited the man?s
cell, the poultices were at once put on in his
absence. This looked as if it were felt that there
had been some omission. All this was excused
on the ground that Dr. Bowie was unwell at the
time; but if Dr. Bowie were unwell, he could not
be blamed, except that, if his locum tenens ne-
glected his duty, the doctor was to some extent
answerable. Dr. Callan was in that position:
his name had been frequently used, a good deal
had been attributed to him, and yet not one word
was heard of him. It was said that Dr. Callan
had charge of these patients, but yet he was not
called. If there was no excuse, why was Dr.
Callan retained at the asylum ? and if there was
an excuse, why was it not made ? In an institu-
tion of this kind, those matters were not to be
trifled with. It would not do to be kind to one
man at the expense of the others. Justice even
almost to sternness was essential in an institution
of this sort. There must be the utmost vigilance
and activity, and, moreover, such a control exer-
cised by those in command that the men will fear
to neglect their duty. If this were not done,
what safety could there be ? A patient could not
always be at the attendant's beck. Duties must
be done, checks must be established, and it must
not bo left to the option of the attendant whether
he does his work or not. The extent to which
that feeling pervaded an establishment marked,
in his mind, the difference between a well-regu-
lated and an ill-regulated establishment. He
would leave this question to be dealt with by the
jury, who must remember to consider other mat-
ters germane, to them. The next case was that.of
Monckton, who was seen eating potatoes and
meat with a fork. Certainly a man afflicted
with dysentery ought not to eat food
like that. Other cases illustrated the same
thing. There was the boy spoken of by Dr
Barry. That boy was apparently not afflicted
with insanity in anyway. He wan ed fresh air
and exercise, according to Dr. Barry?s evidence,
and this course was, after a while, pursued. The
evidence here was very vague, but still it was not
contradicted. As soon as the different course
was pursued the boy recovered. It was neces-
sary to call attention to this, to show that it was
useless to depend on others for their attentions,
unless there was such a supervision kept up as
would ensure duty being performed. There were
other issues to be considered, but they were of
less importance. It was pleaded that certain per-
sons were put under restraint improperly and
with an improper motive. If that were made
clear, the case was of course materially affected ;
but the evidence scarcely supported the allega-
tion. Dr. Carr had led them to believe that ho
was put into a canvas bag because he raised a
complaint, and also that he was put under re-
straint and left solitary in bis cell. It might, of
course, have been necessary to put him under
restraint; but it was singular, to say the least,
that, that moment should have been selected.
Dr. Bowie said he dreaded an outbreak, and that
Carr had become delirious ; if so, be was certainly
right to take means to prevent the lunatic from
doing himself an injury. It was for the jury to
determine this, and whether Carr should not have
been induced to go into his cell instead of being
locked up in a bag. They had heard the state-
ment, that Carr was lying down comparatively
quiet, but on the attempt to interfere with him
he became outrageous at once. They would see,
also, that part of Coates?s evidence pointed to
perquisites or peculations ; but they need not for
a moment embarrass themselves with this part of
the case. Coates had invited them to concur
with him that he was put under restraint because
he refused to dig, but then, again, the jury must
determine whether this was so. It appeared, as
Coates said, that he was supplied with everything
so long as he was working ; but as soon as he re-
fused he got insufficient food, and was put under
restraint. He got wine while he was gardener, but
immediately after ho gave it up he was deprived of
it, and was treated in a different way altogether,
more particularly so after he made certain com-
plaints. Perhaps it might have escaped the
attention of counsel, but Dr, Bowie was not
examined on this point. Edwards stood in the
same category. Dr. Bowie said he supposed the
man to be skulking; but Coates came in to say he
was suffering from insanity and other diseases.
He would leave that part of the case. There
was a general charge of allowing dirt to exist,
but they must bear in mind the allusions made
to, and great reliance placed on, the want of
means and appliances; at the same time, it
seemed to him (the learned Judge) that the want
of means and appliances only existed before the
date of these charges. These wants apparently
existed from 1857 and upwards, and during the
time after 1858 there was a padded-room added
to the institution, lie could easily conceive that,
during the years from 1852 to 1857, there was a
great difficulty in supplying the wants of the
establishment; but the jury were to say whe-
ther this excuse could be admitted after
that date. It was said that these appliances
could not be got in the country, and, moreover,
were not granted by the Government. Mr.
John Thomas Smith corroborated that statement,
and that was all respecting him which he (the
Chief Justice) bad got upon his notes. If there
were an intention to change the site of the build-
ing, it was probable there would not he the same


disposition to spend money on a place that was to
be removed; but still they must not wander
away, nor, again, fix their attention upon any one
particular case. That there was a sufficiency of
attendants did not appear to be deniodj for in
fact there was an unusually large proportion in
comparison with similar institutions in other
countries. He could understand the necessity
for this, but the proportion was still exceedingly
large-one attendant to eleven patients. He
could easily understand that progress had been
made at a certain time, and after that still more,
and so on; but the absence of these means and
appliances at any time must be taken as an ex-
cuse with extreme caution and discretion.
That they were not easily procurable was no
reason why they were not to be had,
or, if pressed for, not to be granted; because
there was a large difference between a superin-
tendent saying,' 4 1 will not go on without them?
I will worry till I have them," and saying, 44 It
is not my fault,? and going on, or saying, even if
the things required were not done, 44 Well, I will
stop at all events." That was not the way for
the manager of such an institution to look at the
subject; that was not a conscientious discharge
of duty. It might, indeed, be a perfunctory
mode of getting through the work tor a certain
amount of money, but no more. But to go back
to the question of dirt. The evidence went over
various dates. There were the vermin, a certain
number of which he looked upon as inevitable.
Did the jury think there were too many ? He
could easily understand that a number of persons
coming in from all directions to a wooden build-
ing would necessitate an excess of vigilance to
keep down the vermin. Then, again, there was
the tilth in the pannikins. All this seemed re-
ducible to the same category. There was the
tilth at the sunk fence. That sunk fence re-
quired rather more attention; but was that at-
tention persevered in ? Why was the filth not
removed? The existence of it appeared in the
evidence given by quite a disinterested man,
Mr. Kauwerau, who pointed ouSjwhac was neces-
sary to be done. Was it necessary? The fence
was put there for a very good reason, viz., to
avoid giving the inmates the idea that they
were in a gaol or place of confinement,
and a low wail?a ha-ha?was substituted
for a hagh enclosure. If the patients at-
tempted to ascend, the angle of the wall cut
them off?they could not ascend it. Under such
circumstances, it was easy to understand
What vigilance was required to keep the patients
from running down there and creating filth.
Murson, the contractor, gave evidence about this
filth, and did the jury believe it ? It was not,
perhaps, distinctly proved, but certainly it was
stated generally in their evidence. More particular
evidence of another description was given. They
would, perhaps, remember Wainwright?s de-
scription of M 4 CoU?s case. The proper attend-
ants had not washed him, and Wainwright did.
The man seemed thankful; and a man, named
Watson, said M'Coll had never been so treated
before. In Fitzgerald?s case, it would seem that
his cell had not been cleaned out, and that, in
fact, the whole establishment was not in a state
of cleanliness. Evidence of this was given in a most
disin. crested way by Hay, who was still an attendant
at the place. Ray fairly told what was for and what
was against the place, without hesitation. Ha
acknowledged to a marked improvement, and the
whole of his evidence required great attention.
The jury could imagine how some men might
see things in a distorted light; but Ray had
every inducement to speak favourably of the
institution, and yet told out fairly all about it.
They must see, by the peculiar form of the libel
ihat it referred to anterior occurrences, and the
improvements which were stated to have taken
place since then only showed that the necessity
for them existed before. The asylum could not
have improved in the way described, unless some
of the charges made were really true at some
time. But he would leave the question of un-
cleanliness altogether. It seemed to him to be
attributable more than anything else to a want
of vigilance, a constant supervision, an insisting
upon certain nuisances being removed, and a
determination not to tolerate uncleanliness in
any part of the place. Then there was one
other question, viz,, the steps not taken to
insure decency, lie said it advisedly, that in
his opinion an indecent, filthy, and obscene
patient in that asylum, was just the person to
whom the utmost attention should be paid. Bad
habits of that kind ought to be removed by the
most active steps. The jury had heard the evi-
dence of Carr and other witnesses about this.
Patients were put in cells, and allowed to dis-
charge the calls of nature where they were.
Why ? Because the vessel was broken. Surely
something .could be devised by which the
decency of the patient could be secured.
Was it impossible to construct a vessel of such
material as would induce Carr to use it. The
very fact of his not using it might be because be
hud not the opportunity. In one sense, this was
a very small point, but in another it showed the
prevalent mode, and was deserving great atten-
tion. Women?s persons were allowed to be ex-
hibited in the privies just in the same way. It
was easy to understand that the utmost vigilance
might be required to correct this, but that was
not the point. What were the attendants there
for ? Was it necessary or not ? Were (hey to
allow women to have recourse to these filthy
practices to suit the laziness of an attendant.
It was stated that it was not possible to prevent
them, but was decency to bo waived in conse-
quence. The jury were to say if they would
accept that excuse. He should have thought
that ihe more depraved a man or woman was,
the greater was the necessity for watching.
They knew what attention was paid in any
public institution to these matters, that the
utmost decency was required at schools, and
that in all schools it was looked upon as one
of the essentials that every care should be taken
to preserve decency before one shilling of the
public money was given. Why was this ? Because a
habit of indecency once formed, was degrading,
and not easily cured. It lowered the moral
tone, and the mind itself. There was no doubt
of the fact in this asylum, and they were to say
whether they would accept the excuse. Next
came another class of cases dwelling on want of
order, which was said to pervade every thing
rhe want of arrangement, organisation, and proper
checks. He alluded to this indirectly because
some of the instances had a reason given for them.
He could easily conceive that the very fact of


those cottages being placed there since showed
that a very large amount of arrangement and
order was required, and also the fact of their
being detached, and not in one block. They
could make fair allowance for that, and it was
only right they should. Another charge was,
that the medicines were improperly administered
?that he must leave the jury to determine.
There were certainly more witnesses stated that
on the one side than on the other; some said the
medicines were in large blue old-tom bottles, and
in bottles which were not labelled. The size of
the bottles was of no importance, but the
absence of labels was. The absence of me-
dical comforts was another thing. That an
attendant might drink up all the wines meant
for the patients one witness said was too mean ;
but he would leave that to them. Then, again,
there was the restraint-book?not the fact of such
a book being kept?but the mode in which it was
kept. It was for them to say whether the at-
tendants who imposed the restraint were the most
proper persons from whom to get information, or
whether some other person, such as the house-
surgeon, Dr. Callan, or the steward, or some
other person in authority, should not have gone
round and taken the names, to see whether the
patients should be restrained, or whether the
authority of Dr. Bowie should not have been ob-
tained. The best evidence of anything was not
that given by a man who committed the deed.
The only check mentioned was that spoken
to by Dr. Bowie himself, who said he went
round and refreshed his memory; but was
that sufficient ? Surely it would require a
most accurate memory to retain all that. He
would leave them to say whether they thought
it should have been entrusted to his memory.
Then, again, there was the visiting the patients at
certain periods. Some witnesses said that the
attendants knew when Dr. Bowie would visit the
patients. It was for them to say whether, if
such were the case, any preparation had been made.
Then there was the distribution of the food?
was the plan adopted the proper one by which
food should be administered ? One witness. Dr.
Pugh, spoke as to the plan at one period; and
another witness, Ray, spoke to a different period.
Dr. Pugh went to see how the food was ad-
ministered, and was asked by Dr. Bowie if
he should accompany him, that offer was de-
clined. ? Why,? says Dr. Pugh, ? I am not
going to ask you. I will go, and then I will
form my own opinions.? He went, and formed
those opinions. He witnessed the distribution of
food, and then asked Dr. Bowie to call in the
patients. He then took two lots of food, and
found one to weigh nearly twice as much as the
other. If the attendants said afterwards that
Dr. Pugh took them too soon, and that they
could have changed them. Dr. Pugh?s intentions
would have been defeated, for he did not want
to see what was done on one occasion, but what
was done everyday. The number of witnesses
who said they saw the food distributed in 1861
did not affect the evidence of Dr. Pugh as to
what was done in 1859. The instant his report
appeared no doubt it effected a great reform, for
Bay?s evidence went to show that. The question
was, whether the necessity for that reform existed
at the time, and that was spoken to. Was it a
proper arrangement or organisation f It was
said that the poor things could not have been
kept until the food became cold and loathsome
to them ; but how was it managed in gaols and
other places ? There was then the construction
of sheds to shelter the patients from the sun,
but they were not erected until a suggestion was
made by Mr, Johnston. As to the case of the
drunken servant, the result of mere drunkenness
on his part might have been of small importance
if it occurred when he was off duty ; but when
on duty it was very different indeed. That an at-
tendant might get tired with the monotony of his
work, and might get drunk when allowed to visit
Melbourne, he could understand, and also that
such an offence should not be visited very
severely if he were a good man in other re-
spects ; but being drunk on duty he regarded
altogether in a different light. Then there was
the tale told by Dr. Barry, who, seeing a woman
who had had her hair cut for breaking a pane of
glass, and another one who was sitting on a log,
using most filthy and obscene language, called
for an attendant, but one did not come.
Mr. Murson, the contractor, spoke of a woman
in the same way, and no attendant came. He
spoke to a respectable-looking man, who was a
patient instead, by mistake. If there was no
attendant, was there that attention shown which
there ought to have been ? They were not to
fasten on one particular item, but to look at the
evidence as a whole. There might be a mass
of items to bring one conclusion to their
minds; and, on the other hand, there might
be a mass to lead them to another con-
clusion. There was the destruction of property,
which was only referred to by Coates, who said
that sheets were used for lighting fires ; but Dr.
Bowie said there was a check to the destruction
of property, and it was for them to say whether
it was enough or not. Patients? blankets were
torn into all imaginable pieces, but Wain-
v right?s evidence showed how that was prevented
at Bethlehem. The same process of prevention
might take some time in the absence of sufficient
accommodation, and it might be necessary to
ascertain the exact state of each of the patients,
so as to draft them out; but nothing was said of
that. Imagine a piece of blanket bound with a
piece of canvas across it, the tearing at that
would have been very ineffectual. There would
have been much more in that than the mere waste
of blankets, and of the public expenditure, as
by a little ingenuity that destructiveness might
have been avoided, and also the restraint which
was said to be so bad for patients. The more
they regarded that of the matter the more it
was capable of being pressed and extended. As
regarded knives and forks, in the same way, there
was a laziness and want of attention on the part
of the attendants. It was said by some that the
patients would stab themselves or others; but
why on earth were they not watched ? As far
as keeping a person alive, one could eat his food
without a spoon, if necessary ; but in that insti-
tution there were persons of all grades and classes,
from the most ignorant to the man who had been
brought up in luxury, and who might be made
considerably worse by having to take up
his food in his fingers. The excuse was,
that the patients might injure themselves;
but ought they not to have been watched ?He
thought he had now gone over all the items. He


had laid before them the issues raised by the
pleas, and it was for them to say whether in
their opinion they were, or were not, substan-
tially proved. If they were proved, the defend-
ant was justified. If not, and they considered
there was a libel on the plaintiff, and that his
position had suffered thereby, they would find
for him, and say what damages he was, in their
opinion, entitled to. There were a number of
issues, but after all they were reduced to the
question of fitness or unfitness?competency or
incompetency; disgrace to the country or not,
and, if so, in consequence of what ? If the
plaintiff cast all these things on the Govern-
ment, there would be no excuse for him if he
tolerated them. No matter whether he said there
was too much work thrust upon him?whether
he was competent at first, and that his incom-
petency proceeded from the advance of old age,
there was no excuse as regarded the present de-
fendant. It was a matter between the plaintiff
and the Government. If he was in that state, he
deserved some provision ; but he ought not to
remain for one day in an establishment if, by so
doing, he jeopardized the life of one of the
persons in it. They were not discussing the
press?that they had nothing to do with ?but
whether there was a libel. Although it was
published before, and was no news to the world
here, still, if the defendant was not justified in
publishing it, it was no excuse that another per-
son published it also. He had now brought their
attention to the salient points in the case.
If any particular point should arise, he would be
happy to read that portion of his notes to them ;
but he thought it would have only embarrassed
them if he had entered into all the items at
length. He had endeavoured to class the de-
tails, and he would now leave the rest to them.
It was merely a skeleton of the counts. The first
related to the unfitness of the plaintiff; the se-
cond to the case of Steele; the third was a repe-
tition of Steele?s case. Then there was Mullens?s
case?the unfitness of the plaintiff for his office ?
the general management of the establishment,
and whether it was a disgrace to the colony,
they found for the plaintiff in Steele?s case, ami
the defendant on the other counts, they would
have to give a verdict accordingly.
The jury then retired to their room, and were
there deliberating for about two hours and
a half.
On their return into Court, shortly after half-
past six o?clock.
The Foreman (Mr. H. Gerraud) announced
that the verdict of the jury was?
On the first count, for the defendant.
On the second count, and so much of the third
as related to Mrs. Steele, for the plaintiff,
damages �IOO.
On the third count (except as to the part re-
lating to Mrs, Steele), for the defendant."
The Court was crowded with spectators through-
out the day.
