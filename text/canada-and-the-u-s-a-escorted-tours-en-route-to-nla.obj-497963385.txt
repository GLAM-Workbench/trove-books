CANADA and U.S.A.
Many Australians and New Zealanders do not realise that when
making a “return journey” to Europe, they are to all intents and
purposes making the equivalent of a “Tour Round the World,” except
that they are doing one-half twice. Many travellers also are not
aware that they can make the complete tour round the world without
losing any of the advantages and reductions afforded in a return
ticket.
It is also a fact that even in a country where the language is
the same, the different methods of procedure, customs, etc., cause
many would-be travellers to hesitate before undertaking the second
half of the journey Round the World, and their travel experience
lacks a visit to that great country of North America, comprising
the Dominion of Canada and the United States of America.
To meet the needs of such travellers, Cook’s Travel Service have
organised a series of Escorted Tours Across Canada and The U.S.A.,
both for the outward journey to Europe and for the return journey
from Europe via the Atlantic and Pacific.
Membership of these Escorted Tours assures the traveller of
complete and satisfactory arrangements. He knows in advance
exactly what the Tour costs, as all necessary expenses are provided
for in the Fare, including gratuities to hotel and railway servants,
baggage porters, etc. He has only his personal expenditure, such
as smokes, beverages, laundry, etc., to pay. He does not need to
carry so much money, as everything is paid for in advance: in fact,
if by any mischance he lost all his money and credits, he would still
be assured of a satisfactory tour. The independent traveller in such
circumstances would be in a very difficult position.
All reservations are made in advance in the individual names of
the members, and, in addition, there is the experienced Tour Manager,
who knows the ropes, and attends to all the worrying details, and
so converts what would otherwise be a harassing journey into a
Pleasure Tour.
We do not claim that the Tours outlined in this programme
cover all the routes or offer an exhaustive tour of Canada or the
U.S.A., but we do definitely say that the traveller who is limited
as to time and who must travel to a schedule should be able to
find a Tour as complete and comprehensive as the period allowed will
permit.
Before enlarging further on the attractions of a visit to North
America, we must point out the necessity of making all steamship
reservations in advance. Apart from the obvious advantages secured
in making reservations early and leaving nothing to chance, it should
be realised there is a clearly defined “Travel Season” when accom-
modation is in great demand, and the length of a tour across North
America is to a great extent controlled by the steamer connections
plus the securing of steamship accommodation.
Cook’s Travel Service have full information of all sailings, plans
of all steamers, and they reserve accommodation in any class. There
are No Extra Charges or Booking Fees.

BRIEF DESCRIPTIVE NOTES.
The following are some brief notes on a few of the great cities
and districts included in the Tours detailed in this programme:
NEW YORK must be seen to be appreciated—buildings that seem
to defy the law of gravitation as they soar up to the skies, their
upper stories at times partially lost among the clouds—streets
crowded with motor vehicles, while overhead thunders the elevated
railway, and underground roars the “subway.” A fantastic city,
representing the climax of modern American development, and
at the same time presenting a “pot pourri” of nationalities.
Here is the “Harlem” of night club and jazz-band fame, with
its amazing negro population; the “Chinatown,” which might
well be a transplanted section of Shanghai; the “East Side,”
and its large Jewish population; and Italian population as great
as that of Naples; a Greek quarter which constitutes a sub-
stantial city in itself; and odd corners representing a dozen
other European nationalities, in characteristic modes of living.
No less characteristic is the far-famed amusement district along
Broadway—the “Great White Way,” where millions of electric
light bulbs flash out advertising slogans; and Coney Island, with
its vast amusement parks and bathing beaches.
Within easy reach of the City is the Storm King Highway,
a magnificent motor road leading along the cliffs that overlook
the Hudson River, and through beautiful mountain scenery.
Only two hours’ distant is Atlantic City, the largest bathing
resort of America.
A few days in and around New York offer an unlimited field
for sightseeing and entertainment. Important sports events are
held almost every day throughout the summer—baseball, tennis,
polo, boxing, and wrestling. Other features well worth seeing
are the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Natural
History, innumerable fine public buildings and monuments, and
important educational and scientific institutions.
PHILADELPHIA, the so-called “Quaker City” which played such an
important role in the early history of the United States as an
independent nation, is only an hour and a half distant from New
York by fast train, and possesses many points of interest to
visitors. With a population of nearly two millions, Philadelphia
is one of the leading industrial and commercial cities of America,
as well as a place of historical backgrounds. Here we find the
Congress Hall, where the first Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives met, and where George Washington was inaugurated as
President of the United States. The famous Liberty Bell and
the house where the first American Flag was made are other
interesting places. A favourite motor drive is that to Valley
Forge, where Washington’s army camped in 1777.


The Capitol, Washington.
The White House, Washington.


WASHINGTON, the Federal Capital of the United States, is one of
the world’s most beautiful cities, laid out on a lavish scale, with
wide avenues and magnificent governmental buildings. The huge
Capitol Building; the White House, residence of the Presidents
of the United States; the great Library of Congress; the National
Museum; the Mint; the lovely Lincoln Memorial; and the Arling-
ton National Cemetery are among the outstanding sights. A
drive along the Potomac, over the George Washington Highway,
takes one quickly to Mount Vernon, the beautiful home of
Washington. Motor drives may conveniently be made to the
famous battlefield of Gettysburg and other historic places con-
nected with the War between the States.
DETROIT, with a population of more than a million and a half, is
the fourth largest city in America, and one of the world’s lead-
ing industrial centres. The rapid growth of Detroit has been
coincident with the remarkable development of the motor in-
dustry in the United States, and many enormous motor plants
and factories are located in or near Detroit. Apart from its
industrial importance, Detroit is a handsome, modern city, with
a large quota of skyscrapers, fashionable shopping sections and
residential subui’bs. Its famous Belle Isle Park is the largest
amusement park in America.
CHICAGO, the metropolis of the Middle West, now has a population
of more than three millions, and only two years ago celebrated
its 100th anniversary. Its situation, on the shores of Lake
Michigan, is strikingly beautiful. Like New York, it has its
forest of skyscrapers, its streets filled with traffic, its hurrying
crowds, and its general atmosphere of excitement.
The famous “Loop” district, with enormous department stores,
theatres, night clubs and cabarets, is a rival of New York’s
“Great White Way.” Chicago also has magnificent residential
sections, stretching along the shores of Lake Michigan.
The University of Chicago is one of the largest in the United
States, and is noteworthy for its fine buildings and beautiful
park-like surroundings. There are several interesting Museums
and Galleries, an endless numbers of parks, huge, modern in-
dustrial plants that are of great interest to many visitors, as
well as the vast stock yards and meat packing houses, for which
Chicago is famous throughout the World.
NIAGARA FALLS rank as one of the great natural wonders of the
world, being second only to Victoria Falls in the volume of their
flow of water. The Falls are broken into two distinct divisions;
the one in the United States, and the other, the magnificent “Horse-
shoe Falls,” in Canada. Points of particular interest are the
Cave of the Winds, beneath the Falls; the spectacular Rapids,
above them, and the awe-inspiring gorge below the cataracts.
There are many points of vantage from which to see the Falls,
on both the American and the Canadian sides, and from the
splendid bridge which spans the river, forming a connecting
link between the two countries. The roar of the waters can
be heard far off, and clouds of mist and spray float over the
gorge, forming perpetual rainbows on sunshiny days.


MONTREAL, with a population of more than a million, is the
largest city in Canada. Founded in 1642 by early French settlers,.
Montreal has, throughout the years, retained something of its
foreign atmosphere, although it is to-day a great, modern
metropolis, equipped with unlimited port facilities, enormous grain
elevators, and many important industrial plants. In the old
historical quarters of the City are many buildings and streets
associated with the early explorers and settlers. Many pleasant
drives may be made in the vicinity of Montreal, which abounds,
in delightful lake and mountain resorts.
QUEBEC, one of the oldest and most picturesque cities in North
America, with its old Citadel, standing on the cliffs, overlooking
the broad St. Lawrence River, presents a charming picture when
seen from the decks of an incoming liner, and offers many attrac-
tions to those who remain for a few days within its gates. The
City is closely associated with the names of those great French-
men, Jacques Cartier, Champlain and Montcalm, who played such
heroic parts in the history of Canada, and also with the early
struggles between France and England for control of this vast
land. French is still the principal language of Quebec. Visitors
will enjoy exploring the old fortifications and ramparts where
ancient iron cannon still keep watch; and Battlefields Park, where
in 1759 the battle was fought which gave Canada to England.
Dufferin Terrace, the fashionable promenade overlooking the St.
Lawrence, is one of the City’s most attractive places.
OTTAWA, the Federal Capital of Canada, is a delightful City, note-
worthy for its parks and tree-lined avenues, and its handsome
public buildings, particularly the new Canadian Houses of Parlia-
ment, built of greystone, and strikingly situated on a hilltop
overlooking the Ottawa River and the distant Laurentian Moun-
tains of the Province of Quebec. The outstanding feature of
the Houses of Parliament is the beautiful “Peace Tower,” with
its Memorial Chamber and Altar of Sacrifice, commemorating
the 60,000 Canadians who gave their lives in the Great War.
The belfry of the Tower contains a fine set of chimes, which
are played at frequent intervals. The Victoria Memorial Museum,
the Royal Mint and the Government Experimental Farms are
among the interesting sights of Ottawa.
TORONTO, the second largest city of Canada, has a population of
about three-quarters of a million, and its business section is
noteworthy for the number of tall, modern buildings. Toronto
has somewhat of the “skyscraper” aspect usually associated with
the big cities of the United States. At the same time, it ranks
as a great educational and recreational centre of Canada. On
the Shores of Lake Ontario, within the city’s limits, is Sunnyside
Beach, with its broad-walk, amusement park, swimming pools
and sandy beaches, protected by a sea wall. Toronto stands
at the gateway to the marvellous lake and mountain region
of the Province of Ontario, a paradise for lovers of outdoor
sport. This area is dotted with hundreds of summer recreational
camps, hunting lodges and fishing preserves. The Canadian
National Exhibitions, which take place every summer at Toronto,
are among the most important trade fairs held in North America.


A Hopi Indian at the Grand Canyon.


YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK is a place of towering precipices,
granite spires and domes, and sparkling waterfalls plunging into
flowery depths. The huge cliff, El Capitan, Bridal Veil and
Vernal Falls, the Cathedral, Sentinel Dome and Cloud’s Rest, are
but a few of its never-to-be-forgotten sights. The winding climb
out of the valley and over to the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees
is one of the supreme delights of the Tour.
GRAND CANYON OF ARIZONA is described as “the most sublime
of all earthly spectacles.” This gorgeous rift in the earth’s
surface, 217 miles long, ten to twenty miles wide, and at some
places a mile deep, is the work of the swift-rushing Colorado
River, aided by the weathering process of countless ages. No
medium can convey the impression of the giant peaks and the
brilliant colour display of this grand facade of seven systems
of rock formation.
LOS ANGELES is the metropolis of Southern California, and is said
to be the second richest American City in proportion to population.
It has many excellent shops, miles of streets bordered by beauti-
ful homes, and an admirable transportation system to and from
the adjacent seaside and mountain resorts. The equable climate
has drawn people from all over the world, and the seasons are
so mild that in nearby Hollywood strawberries are ripe from
Christmas to Christmas. The rapid growth of motion picture
production in Hollywood has become a great factor in Los Angeles
life, and its effects are so widespread that even the most casual
visitor is conscious of its presence.
SAN FRANCISCO has the air of the greater cities of the world—
something of gravity and much of beauty. The shops of San
Francisco are of the best, and the florists’ shops, including the
sidewalk flower markets, are a joy and a delight to the eye,
with their variegated colours and pleasing perfumes. San Fran-
cisco has always managed to keep its restaurants in the lime-
light. These are numerous and varied, deserving of the fame
they have achieved. Market Street is the Broadway of San
Francisco, and its popular theatre section is locally termed the
“Path of Gold,” corresponding to New York’s “Great White Way.”
The Bay of San Francisco, which varies from four to ten
miles in width, and is nearly seventy miles long, is the world’s
largest land-locked harbour. Ships from every corner of the
globe drop anchor here, and men of every race and colour meet
and tell their tales in the eating houses and cafes along the
water-front.
THE ROCKIES. The Great Ranges of North America offer some
of the most gorgeous and inspiring scenery to be found anywhere.
Here are lofty snow-capped peaks, broad, winding valleys, preci-
pitous, ever-changing glaciers, and exquisite mountain lakes, set
like jewels amid towering walls of granite.
VANCOUVER is Canada’s largest Pacific port, and its harbour is
busy with shipping from all parts of the world. In charming
British Columbia, it is in the heart of Canada’s evergreen play-
ground. It is built regally on hills which slope down to its
sheltered waters.

IMPORTANT POINTS.
PASSPORTS.—VaIid Passports with Visas where required. Full
information as to necessary formalities can be obtained at any
of our. Offices.
N.B.—Passengers making two entries into U.S.A., i.e.,
travelling from, say, San Francisco to Montreal, thence to
New York, are required to obtain two visas, one for each
entry.
U.S.A. “Sailing Permit.—All passengers sailing from New York, or
other U.S.A. Port, MUST obtain a “Sailing Permit” from the
Customs House at the port before boarding steamer. This is
very similar to the Australian “Taxation Clearance Certificate,”
and it is quickly issued to passengers holding through tickets.
BAGGAGE.—Passengers holding through tickets to or from Europe
are allowed 350 lbs. of baggage free per adult ticket on
Canadian and UtS.A. railways.
Heavy baggage can be checked through “in Bond” across
Canada or U.S.A. from the port of arrival to the port of
departure without charge, except that the cost of the transfer
of the baggage between the steamers and the depots (railway
stations) at both ports is payable by the passenger. (This
charge is not included in the Escorted Tour Fares quoted in
this programme.) Passengers are strongly urged to avail
themselves of this facility to check heavy baggage through
in bond, as it will save them considerable inconvenience and
delay in customs examination, also substantial expense.
INSURANCE.—Travellers are strongly advised to avail themselves
of Cook’s system of Baggage Insurance. Accident Insurance
may also be effected at any of their Offices. Proposal Forms
and full particulars on application.
Offices in Canada and U.S.A.—AII arrangements for the Escorted
Tours are under the direct supervision and control of our own

COOK’S TRAVELLER’S CHEQUES are readily cashed throughout
Canada and the U.S.A. at all Banks, Hotels, on Railways and
at large Stores. For safety and convenience sake, carry your
funds in the form of Cook’s Traveller’s Cheques, in $ or
Sterling. Experienced travellers recommend them.


SPECIAL NOTICES.
FUNDS FOR TRAVELLERS.
The safest and most convenient method of carrying funds while
travelling is in the form of Cook’s Traveller’s Cheques. These are
issued in cheques of £2, £5, £lO, and £2O, and also in Dollars in
cheques of $lO, $2O, $5O, and $lOO. These are cashed by any of our
Offices and Banking Correspondents throughout the World. If lost,
their value is repaid by us against a suitable guarantee, provided
the instructions issued with them are complied with. We frequently
make repayments against such guarantees, and we do not know of a
single case where a Traveller has ultimately suffered any loss,
whereas, if he had carried his funds in the form of hank notes, there
would have been little or no chance of recovering the amount.
We also issue drafts, cash Travellers’ Cheques, and make pay-
ments on Letters of Credit issued by other Bankers. We exchange
Foreign Money in large or small quantities at the best current rates,
and can remit money by cable through the medium of our principal
Offices.
With Branch Offices and Correspondents in all parts of the
World, we have exceptional facilities for transacting Banking and
Exchange business for Travellers on the most favourable Terms.
