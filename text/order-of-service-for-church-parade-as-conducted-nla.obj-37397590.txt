Him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and before
Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy son.
If After which the Minister shall say —
I pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to
accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice, un-
to the throne of the heavenly grace, saying after me,
If A general Confession, to be said by all present —
Almighty and most merciful Father: We have erred
and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have
followed too much the devices and desires of our own
hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws. We
have left undone those things which we ought to have
done; And we have done those things which we ought
not to have done; And there is no health in us. But
thou, O lord, have mercy upon us, miserable offenders.
Spare thou them, O God, which confess their faults
Restore thou them that are penitent; According to thy
promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our
Lord. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his
sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous,
and sober life, To the glory of thy holy name. Amen. '


IT The Absolution, or Remission of sins, to he pro-
nounced by the Priest alone ,
Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that
he may turn from his wickedness and live; and hath
given power, and commandment, to his Ministers, to
declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,
the Absolution and Remission of their sins; He par-
doneth and absolveth all them that truly repent, and
unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore let
us beseech him to grant us true repentance, and his
holy Spirit, that those things may please him which we
do at this present; and that the rest of our life here-
after may be pure and holy; so that at the last we may
come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord

trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation;
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

7. E'or He is the Lord our God; and we are the
people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.

hearts; as in the provocation, and as in the day of
temptation in the wilderness;
9. When 3 r our fathers tempted me; proved me, and
saw my works.


10. Forty years long- was I grieved with this genera-
tion and said: It is a people that do err in their hearts,
for they have not known my ways;
11. Unto whom I sware in my wrath; that they
should not enter into my rest.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son; and to the
Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be; world without end. Amen.

HYMNS.
“Oh, be joyful in the Lord.”—Ps. c. 1. L.M.
1 All people that on earth do dwell.
Sing’ to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell.
Come ye before Him, and rejoice.
2 S l .?, Lord > ye know, is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His flock. He doth us feed;
And for His sheep He doth us take.
3 Oh! enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto;
Praise, laud, and bless His name alwavs
For it is seemly ,so to do. ’
4 For why, the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood
And shall from age to age endure.
5 To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom heaven and earth adore
From men and from the Angel-host,
Be praise and glory evermore.
Amen
1 Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom ’fly,
While the gathering waters roll.
While the tempest still is high
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm' of life is past:
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh, receive my soul at last.
2 Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave—ah! leave me not alone
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.


3 Plenteous grace with thee is found
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound,
Make and keep me 'pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart;
Rise to all eternity. Amen.
'Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.”
—1 Tim., vi, 12. L.M
1 Fight the good fight with all thy might,
Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.
2 Run the straight race through God’s good grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;
Life with its way before us lies,
Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.
3 Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;
His boundless mercy will provide;
Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove,
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
4 Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near,
He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee.
Amen.
'Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.”
—Ps. Ixxxvii. 3. 8.7
1 Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He, whose Word cannot be broken.
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation’s wall surrounded.
Thou may’st smile at all thy foes.


2 See, the streams of living- waters
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove.
Who can faint, when such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord the Giver
Never fails from age to age.
3 Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear,
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near.
Thus they march, the pillar leading,
Light by night, and shade by day,
Daily_ on the manna feeding,
Which He gives them when they pray.
4 Blest Inhabitants of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer’s blood!
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
, Makes them kings and priests to God.
Tis His love His people raises
Over self to reign as kings;
And as priests His solemn praises
Each for a thank-offering brings. Amen
Lord Jehovah is the Rock of Ages.”—Tsa. xxvi. 4
1 Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven Side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power!
2 Not the labours of my hands,
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone!
3 Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress:
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the Fountain fly-
Wash me. Saviour, or I die!


4 While I draw this fleeting- breath,
When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown
See Thee on Thy judgment Throne,
Rock of ages! cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee!
Amen.
T am the Lord, thy Redeemer, which leadeth thee by
the way thou shouldst go.”—lsa. xlviil. 17. 8.7.
1 Lead us. Heavenly Father, lead us
O’er the world’s tempestuous sea:
Guide us, guard us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but Thee;
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be.
2 Saviour, breathe forgiveness o’er us,
All our weakness Thou dost know;
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe:
Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert Thou didst go.
3 Spirit of our God descending.
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy:
Love with every feeling blending,
Pleasures that can never cloy.
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy. Amen.
"Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help.
—Ps. cxlvi. 5. C.M.
1 O God, our Help in ages past.
Our Hope for years to come.
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal Home!
2 Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have d-welt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.


3 Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
4 A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream
Bears all its sons away;
They fly, forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
6 O God, our Help in ages past,
Our Hope for years to come;
Be Thou our Guard troubles last,
And our eternal Home.
Amen.
VIII.
Ye approach this day unto battle against your
enemies: let not your hearts faint.”—Deut. xx. 3. 7s
1 Oft in danger, oft in woe,
Onward, Christians, onward go,
Fight the fight, maintain the strife,
Strengthened with the bread of life.
2 Onward, Christians, onward go,
Join the war and face the foe.
Paint not! Much doth yet remain,
Dreary is the long campaign.
3 Shrink not, Christians! Will ye yield?
Will ye quit the painful field?
Will ye flee in danger’s hour?
Know ye not your Captain’s power?
4 Bet your drooping hearts be glad;
March, in heavenly armour clad;
Fight, nor think the battle long;
Soon shall victory tune your song.
5 Let not sorrow dim your eye;
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not fears your course impede;
Great your strength, if great your need.
6 Onward then to battle move;
More than conquerors ye shall prove;
Though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go. Amen.


Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the Cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ, the Royal Master,
Reads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
Do His banners go.
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!
At the sign of triumph
Satan’s host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.
Onward, Christian soldiers, &c.
Like a mighty army,
Moves the Church of God.
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope, in doctrine,
One in charity.
Onward, Christian soldiers, &c.
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise,
And that cannot fail.
Onward, Christian soldiers, &c,
Onward then, ye people,
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song;
Glory, praise and honour
Unto Christ the King;
This, through countless ages,
Men and Angels sing.
Onward, Christian soldiers.
Amen,


1 “Christian! seek not yet repose;
Cast thy dreams of ease away;
Thou art in the midst of foes:
“Watch and pray.”
2 Principalities and powers,
Mustering- their unseen array,
Wait for thy unguarded hours:
“Watch and pray.”
3 Gird thy heavenly armour on,
Wear it ever night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one;
“Watch and pray.”
4 Hear the victors who o’ercame;
Still they mark each warrior’s way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim,
“Watch and pray.”
S Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His Word,
“Watch and pray.”
6 Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray, that help may be sent down;
“Watch and pray.” Amen.
Put on the whole armour of God.”—Bph. vi. 11. S.M
1 Soldiers of Christ! arise,
And put your armour on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies
Through His eternal Son:
2 Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
And in His Mighty power;
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror!
3 Stand, then, in His great might,
With all His strength endued;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The armour of your God.


4 From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle, and fight, and pray,
Tread all the powers of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day;
5 That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts past,
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,
And perfect stand at last. Amen,
Christ is the Head of the Church.” —Bph. v. 23
1 The Church’s one foundation
lb Jesus Christ her_ Lord;
She is His new creation
By water and the word;
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride.
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.
2 Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one Faith, one Birth;
One Holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.
3 Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore opprest,
By schisms rent asunder,
"By heresies distrest;
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, “How long?”
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.
4 'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for evermore;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.


5 Yet she cn earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won.
Oh, happy saints and holy!
Lord, give us grace that we
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee!
Amin
XIII.
Through the night of doubt and sorrow.
_ Onward goes the pilgrim band,
Singing songs of expectation,
Marching to the promised land.
Clear before us through the darkness
Gleams and burns the guiding light;
Brother clasps the hand of brother,
Stepping fearless through the night.
One the light of God’s own presence
O’er His ransom’d people shed.
Chasing far the gloom and terror,
Brightening all the path we tread:
One the object of our journey,
One the faith which never tires,
One the earnest looking forward,
One the hope our God inspires;
One the strain that lips of thousands
Lift as from the heart of one;
One the conflict, one the peril,
One the march in God begun:
One the gladness of rejoicing
On the far eternal shore,
Where the One Almighty Father
Reigns in love for evermore.


Onward, therefore, pilgrim brothers,
Onward with the cross our aid;
Bear its shame, and fight its battle,
Till we rest beneath its shade.
Soon shall come the great awaking
Soon the rending of the tomb;
Then the scattering of all shadows,
And the end of toil and gloom. Amen.
XIY.
I count all things but loss for the excellency of
the knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord.”
—Phil. ill. 8. L.M.
1 When I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died.
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
H Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.
3 See! from His Head, His Hands, His Feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
4 Were the w r hole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small,
Love, so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all. Amen


(A. and M„ 542.)
‘Quit you like men; be strong’.”
1 Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!
Ye soldiers of the Cross;
Lift high His royal banner.
It must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory
His army He shall lead,
Till every foe is vanquish’d,
And Christ is Lord indeed.
2 Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!
solemn watchword hear;
If while ye sleep He suffers,
Away with shame and fear;
Where’er ye meet with evil,
Within you or without,
Charge for the God of battles,
And put the foe to rout.
8 Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!
The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumber’d foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.
4 Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the Gospel armour,
Bach piece put on with prayer;
When duty calls or danger
Be never wanting there!
5 Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s song.
To him that overcometh,
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of Glory
Shall feign eternally.
Amen


XVI.
God Save The King.
God save our gracious King,
Long live our noble King,
God save the King.
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us:
God save the King.
O Lord our God, arise,
Scatter his enemies,
And make them fall
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks;
On Thee our hopes we fix:
God save us all.
Thy choicest gifts in store,
On him be pleased to pour;
Long may he reign
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice:
God save our King.
Amen
