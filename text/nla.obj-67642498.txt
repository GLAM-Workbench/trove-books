SOUTH AUSTRALIA 1861.
FELLENBERG COMMERCIAL SCHOOL.
in the City of
The half-yearly meeting of the scholars of the Fellen-
berg Commercial School, conducted by Mr. J. Martin, took
place on Friday afternoon.
A lanre number of relatives of the scholars and visitors
were present, amongst whom were the Rev. Canon Russell,
the Rev. W. Harcus, Messrs. J. C, Paisley, Resile, King,
Burgan, Francis and others.
The junior department of the school was first examined
V#y the Kev. Canon Russell, and Miss Jupp, on scriptural
subjects and in natural history and acquitted themselves
satisfactorily
Mr. Neville Blyth, M. P. then took the chair In his
returnks he facetiously said, that he was enabled to attend
on that occasion because he had a holiday in his own school
on North-Terrace*
He remarked it would be the last time that he should
be present at an examination ot Mr. Martin?s school in the
Pulteney-street Schoolroom, as the school was about to be
removed. He heartily regretted that Government sought to
diminish the aid now granted by the State to education. He
read a report of an examination of the boys by the Rev.
D. J. H. ibbetson, from which the following are extracts.
??The subject dealt with were elementary physics, hydrosta-
tics mechanics & the answers of many of the boys both
delighted and surprised me. In the laws of motion & in the
different orders of laws, they were well up, and one boy
(Li, Fhillipps,) proved himself a philosopher. In addition
to the above boy, who answered well throughout, I
must make honourable mention of Anderson, Bailey, Calder,
James Ist, James 2nd, Lambell, Bruce and Harcus. I must
congratulate you on the evidence which the boys furnished
of the care which you have bestowed on their instruction. ?
Another report from Mr. H. Nootnagel stated that the
Alluding to the Parliment House which is situated there.

he had examined in Latin grammar, were exceedingly well
up in their knowledge of the subject; and that with reference
to geography, he was pleased with the general correctness
of the answers. , , .
The Rev. Mr. Harcus, who had examined the hoys in
Writing and Drawing, expressed himself satisfactorily as to
the result. . ,
Several recitations were then given by some or the
