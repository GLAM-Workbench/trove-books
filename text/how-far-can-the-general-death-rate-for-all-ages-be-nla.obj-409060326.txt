HOW FAR CAN THE GENERAL DEATH-RATE FOR
ALL AGES BE RELIED UPON AS A COM-
PARATIVE INDEX OF THE HEALTH OR
SANITARY CONDITION OF ANY COMMUNITY ?
By R. M. Johnston, F.LiB.
[Bead April 19.]
Indices to the state of health or Sanitary condition of a
community are of the utmost importance to all, and
especially so to those who are responsible for local sanitary
provisions, and hence it is often asked, how far is the general
death-rate of any year to be relied upon as a test of either
the health or sanitary condition of any place or country ?
I shall this evening try to demonstrate that the general
death-rate of any one place, though in itself due to a
combination of many compile causes, may, nevertheless, be
used as a fairly reliable local index to health and sanitary
condition, although a most faulty index as regards the
comparative health or the sanitary condition of different
localities. The dominant influences which determine the total
death-rate are these :
1. The proportions living at various age groups, especially
the old age group, 60 years and over.
2. Migration, as affecting the said proportions.
3. Birth-rate as affecting the death-rate of 0-5 years age
group.
4. Climate.
5. Seasonal influence.
6. Cosmical or obscure influences varying or intensifying
local causes of disease over wide cycles of years.
7. War, violence, and famine.
8. Density of population as exemplified by town and
country dwellings.
9. Sanitary provisions.
10. Local conditions of soil, altitude, etc.
Now, of these important influences, which together combine
to make up the total death-rate, the first three, though
strongly affecting it, are not in the slighest degree connected
with either health or sanitary conditions. It is also obvious,
so far as any one locality is concerned, that many of the
conditions enumerated are more or less constant; while, as
regards different localities, and especially countries widely
apart, nearly all the conditions come into play as disturbers,


and hence it is, that the general death-rate of any one locality
may he a fairly reliable comparative index of the health
and sanitary condition from year to year ; while, as regards
longer periods, or widely separated localities, comparisons by
the indication of a general death-rate are often utterly
fallacious or misleading.
Much prejudice exists in some minds against the use of
figures. “ Figures can prove anything,” is a current popular
phrase.
But even words and phrases, as such, are more easily
twisted to Avrong uses than figures. Yet we do not despair
of arriving at correct conclusions by the aid of facts and
figures, where due care, thorough investigation, and logical
methods are employed. As a rule it is not so much that the
results of computed figures are false, as that careless and
false interpretations are put upon them. Lord while
presiding over the statistical section in 1865, happily
illustrated some of the mistakes of this kind, by the state-
ment that erroneous interpretations are taken from
death-rate totals where abnormal causes are not
taken into account; for example, “ a year of pestilence,
not only by its effect on the mortality of the year
of its occurence, but by its clearing away feeble lives,
and so lightening the death-rate in years immediately
consequent.” But there is less to be feared from errors
arising out of this source, if wo lay to heart the warning uttered
by Mr. Goschen on a recent occasion. “ Beware of totals ;
and if we recognise more fully than Aveare usually apt to do that
a table of figures, even if it be absolutely correct as a state-
ment of facts, is merely raw material, not a finished product.
The misfortune is that it is only too frequently treated as
the latter.”
Kew tables of totals indicating the death-rates per year of
different countries are too commonly treated as finished pro-
ducts, whereas I shall in the following remarks endeavour to
demonstrate that they are raw materials, so far as deductions
relating to comparative health and sanitary condition are
concerned.
With this object in view I shall address myself to illustrate
the disturbing effect of the dominant influences already
indicated upon the total death-rates in different years and in
different places.
The Disturbing Effect of Varying Proportions of
Persons Living at Various Age Groups.
To fully comprehend the effect of disturbance from this
source Ave must know in a general way the widely differing
proportions which each age group of living persons yield to


the yearly death-rate. This is best appreciated by dividing
the ages into three well-marked groups ; the first* 0-5 years,
showing the heavy losses at the beginning of life; the
second, 5-60 years, or vigorous period, showing the sudden
descent to a mini mum, covering the period of youth and middle
age; the third, 60 years and over, or old age period, suddenly
curving upwards and marking the maximum of loss occasioned
by the natural decay and termination of the more vigorous
lives.
The tables and diagrams give a picture of
the broad proportional agreement in different
countries as regards the losses of life at the three great ago
groups. For, notwithstanding the fluctuations caused in
different countries, whether due to climate or peculiarities of
local condition, there is a wonderful similarity in the propor-
tions which different countries yield at each respective age
group.
The first ranges between 27'65 and 50-60 per 1,000 living.
The second „ „ 5-60 „ 12-66 „ „ „
The third „ „ 49’18 „70 39 „ „ „
The mean of each age group shows the relative proportion
still more clearly thus :
0-5 years’ age group yields 42-15 deaths per 1,000 living.
5 under 60 years „ „ 7-73 „ „ „
60 years and over „ „ 6153 „ „ „
Thus it appears that there is a very wide difference in the
proportion of deaths yielded by each age group, and hence it
is that if there be any wide difference in the proportions of
the respective groups living in different places, as in voung
Colonies, the total death-rate would be so much disturbed
thereby, that comparisons, so far as they refer to health or
sanitary condition, would be erroneous and misleading.
That this is to be expected is made still more apparent by
contrasting the percentages of ages living with the percen-
tages of deaths per year under corresponding age groups.

A study of the foregoing table reveals that if 1

population, yield as much as 6020 percentage of the

deaths for one year, it follows, if there be any material
difference in the respective living groups of different coun-
tries, that the total death-rate would show a corresponding
difference, even though the proportion of deaths yielded at
each age group were identical in the several countries com-
pared. Thus, though the death-rate of each specific age
group were identical in two countries, still the country
having the smaller percentage of old age and children living
would show a lower death-rate. Nay, more. If the variation
be considerable the country with the smaller percentage of
extremes of youth and old age living would show a lower
total death-rate, even where the ratio of deaths at specific ages
were much higher. Take, for example, two towns of 100,000
inhabitants, as in the following illustration :

differently proportioned as regards age grotips living,
although the proportion of deaths yielded by both are

This is a good illustration of cases where the total death
rate is a faulty comparative Index to the state of health or
sanitary condition, for the difference 2*82 per 1,000 is due
entirely to the varying proportion of persons living at each
age group, and not to any difference in the proportion of
deaths yielded by them.

This comparison again still more forcibly illustrates the
faulty indication of the total death-rate, as regards the com-
parative state of the health or sanitary condition of the two
towns taken, for it so happens that D, which has a much
smalleryield of deaths relative to each age group, is nevertheless
made to appear T 23 per 1,000 person higher than C by tbe
total death-rate. Whereas the true relation of C, in relation
to health and sanitary condition, as compared with D, can
only be ascertained by computing C’ s death-rates at each age
group in connection with the same living age group propor-
tions, as in D. By this means alone would a true comparison
be effected between them, as regards health and sanitary
condition, and instead of C being 13‘38 per 1,000 persons, and
lower than D by T 23 per 1,000, it is, as regards health in
relation to I), really equivalent to 17'90 per 1,000 persons
living, or equal to 3*29 per cent, per 1,000 above the index of
D.
Since the Health Standard was proposed by me in 1882,
another method for effecting truer comparisons than
offered by the total deaths between different countries, has
been adopted by Mr. Hayter (Yearßookfor 1885,p.p. 264-268),
termed by him the Absolute Death-rate. This consists of
ignoring actual proportions living at each age altogether, and
artificially substituting uniformity of proportion, by recognis-
ing fifteen age groups of equal value (say 1,000 for each). It
makes no allowance for the element of old age, and consequently
this health element neutralises the true approximate indication
of proportion from preventible causes. It is, however, an
admirable method in many respects, although its general
results would still produce anomalies in comparisons relating
to health and sanitary condition.
The method would be greatly improved if the fixed
standard for the various age groups were more closely
approximated to the actual proportions living in different
countries. By dividing them into three groups, as follows,
this might be effected very closely, viz.:—
Let. A=Represent proportion of ages living 0-5 years =3 *
B= „ „ „ 5-60 „ =l6*
C „ „ ~ „ 60 and over =1 *
Ra= Death-Rate actually yielded by ages living 0-5
Rb= „ „ „ „ 5-60 „
R c= „ „ „ „ 60 & over
D. = Relative Death-Rate for all ages.
Then,
AR a + BR b + CR c _
A+B+C
These figures are the lowest simple relative approximates to the mean
proportions living within the respective age groups.


A Relative Health Standard might be fixed similarly for
comparison between different countries, by combining age
groups under 60 by the same fixed values and by eliminating
Thus AE a + BR 6 =H or Re i ative Health Standard.
C A +
If the death-rates for Australasia be compared by these
methods, the following would be the results for each
Colony:—
Death-Rate per 1,000 Persons Living.
Alt. Ages. “ Health Standard ”

South Australia 1885 17*67 12*48 12*91 10*74 10*81
Victoria 1885 21*48 14*73 15*49 12*23 12*84
Now South Wales 1884 19 99 15*88 15*55 13*23 13*32
Queensland ... 1885 26*04 19*58 21*09 18*48 18*68
As regards the value of these five standards as comparative
indices of health and sanitary condition, there can be no
doubt of the superiority of the Actual and Relative Health
Standards, and the following may be taken as the order of
their respective values as health indices: —
1. Actual Health Standard (ages under 60).
2. Relative Ditto Ditto.
3. Relative Death-Rate for all ages. -
4. Absolute Ditto Ditto (Hayter’s method).
5. General Total Death-Rate for all ages.
Thus there are five methods for effecting comparison.
1. The Total Death-Rate for all ages, which makes no allowance
whatever for the varying proportions of age groups-
2. Hayter’s Absolute Death-Rate for all ages, giving an
arbitrary fixed value of 1,11 and 3 to ages living 0-5,
5-60, 60 and over, respectively ; superior to total death-
rate, but defective inasmuch as the arbitrary fixed values
do not approximate to the average mean of the actual
proportions of the several age groups, and because it
ignores the disturbing element of old age in com-
parisons regarding health and sanitary condition.
3. “ The Relative Death-Rate ” for all ages, giving a fixed
value of 3,16 and 1, for ages 0-5, 5-6, 60 and over,
respectively, based upon the actual average proportions
of the several age groups living, but defective as a
standard of health, by including the old age element.
4. “ The Relative Health Standard ” for ages under 60,
giving a fixed relative value of 3,16 to the two groups
0 5 and 5-60, and so approximating to actual living pro-
portions. This method eliminates the old age element,

and is convenient for effecting comparisons with
countries where the rates yielded for the particular
groups are already computed.
5. “ The Actual Health Standard ” for ages under 60, giving
the true yield of deaths per 1,000 persons actually
living under the same age limit in each country, and
thus effecting the best form of index as regards the
comparative health and sanitary condition of different
countries, by the elimination of the healthy old age
element.
Of course these and other standards are supplementary to
the more minute analysis, showing the actual death-rate at
each specific age group. .
That there is a great disparity in the proportion of living
persons at each age group in the Australasian Colonies has
alreadv been shown, but it is nowhere so strikingly apparent
as in the Colonies of Tasmania, Queensland, and New Zealand.
This is at cnce apparent by observing the proportions in
each Colony of persons living,‘and of deaths occuring in the old
age group.

Here we are at once struck with the fact that, included
within the total death-rate in Tasmania (15-40 per I,tOJ
persons), there is 36-14 per cent, of the total deaths for ages
60 years and over. While in the total death-rate of Queens-
land (18'47 per 1,000 persons) there is only included 6 38 per
cent, of the total deaths for ages 60 years and over. That
this is solely due to the greater number, of persons in
Tasmania living at this age group (8 04 per cent), and not
because of lack of health, is made unmistakably evident by
computing the mean of all ages at death in the 60 years and
over age group. This would show :
Percentage of death Mean age at
60 and over. death.


Tins again proves that the true test of the death and
sanitary condition for the old age group is longevity rather
than the accidental proportion to the comparatively small
number living at this age; and according to this test
Tasmania, with a mean age of 7771 years for all deaths at
age group 60 years and over, is far above any other country.
Where, as in Tasmania, 36 74 per cent, of the deaths
exceeds the alloted span of life, “ three score years and ten,”
and where old age in itself among specific cause heads the
list, it is evident that the total death-rate, which includes and
conceals this important element, must in itself be a most
unsatisfactory test of health or sanitary condition between dif-
ferent countries or places, although fairly good enough where
comparisons are made for different years in relation to the
same locality.
Extreme old age, per se., is an infallible index of health,
whether due to the life or its environment. Therefore, to
mingle deaths from extreme old age with deaths from the
more or less preventible causes in any common rate used as
a test of sanitary condition, must, as I have shown, frequently
result in anomalies and confusion.
Under any circumstance, as already urged by me in my
report on Vital Statistics for 1882, it would seem to be most
desirable to separate the deaths from extreme old age from
other causes in analysis of matters bearing upon health or
sanitary condition ; for although in imagination we could,
with Dr. Richardson, conceive of the future Hygeia as
perfectly freed from preventible causes of death, yet if it be
admitted that the fully ripe aged must die sooner or later,
we must also conceive that as we approach the ideal City of
Health the proportions of death in childhood, youth, and
middle age can only diminish as the proportion of old age
increases. Thus, when the future Registrar-General can
record deaths from extreme old age “ 100 per cent.,” there
will be perfect health and peace, and the only value of the
annual death-rate for all ages, will be merely as a measure of
the natural increase or decrease of population. From these
considerations it is clear that the ordinary death-rate index
for Tasmania is not a fair test of her sanitary condition as
compared with the neighbouring Colonies, for of all countries
with whose statistics I am acquainted there is none which
so closely approaches the ideal standard of perfect health.
It may be that one is generally more satisfied with a
bantling of one’s own creation; but, making allowance for
this, I am also strongly convinced that the Health Standard
proposed by me in 1882 (viz., deaths under 60 years com-
pared with the population living under the same age limit)
would moi'e fitly than any other method fulfil all the condi-

tions required in a general death-rate for testing the health
and sanitary condition of different places.
By this standard two very desirable objects are secured.
First, the widely disturbing effect of differing proportions
of the old age group is entirely eliminated and truer com-
parison as regards comparative health may be attained; and
second, the element of old age, whose proportions over 60 are
in themselves good indices of environment, are not mixed
up with deaths due to adverse causes, and so producing
confusion in the general result, as in the total death-rate and
other standards for all ages. The national death-rate for all
ages, it is true, is a very simple and ready test, and may
still be used with advantage in some countries where the
age relations are comparatively stable, but in the Colonies,
where these relations are continually disturbed by migration,
the Health Standavd, as already defined, is more reliable, can
be applied universally, is simple, and, for comparison, easily
computed.
It would also be of the greatest value in the comparison
of different cities in Europe by minimising the errors of
comparison arising out of migration between town and
country districts.
To Health Officers, who are responsible for the sanitary
conditions of towns, such a test would prove of great
advantage, and it would often save them from unmerited
opprobrium based upon the unreliable total death-rate index,
which takes no account of the important disturbances caused
by the variation of age group proportions.
Mr. N. A. Humphreys, in 1874, read a masterly and useful
paper before the Statistical Society of London, in defence
of the general utility of the total death-rate as an index to
comparative health so far as England is concerned; but
he admitted its defects, and many of his conclusions have
been combated by Mr. Thos. A. Welton, Dr. Letherby, and
other well-known authorities on vital statistics.
As regards the disturbed age groups of the Colonies, how-
ever, Mr. Humphreys would probably admit that the general
death-rate for all ages would be unsatisfactory and mislead-
ing as a comparative index of health.
These conclusions are fully borne out by placing the
results of the two methods side by side as applied to the
Australasian Colonies.

Thus, by the total death-rate, the several Colonies take up
the following order, in which Tasmania is made to occupy the
fourth position, while, by the more accurate Health Standard ,
Tasmania rightly occupies the second position.
By the Total Death-Rate index:—l, New Zealand ; 2, South
Australia ; 3, Victoria ; 4, Tasmania ; 5, New South Wales ;
6, Queensland.
By the Health Standard : —l, New Zealand ; 2, Tasmania;
3, South Australia; 4, Victoria; 5, New South Wales; 6,
Queensland.
The order of greatest percentage living over GO is also
shown thus: —1, Tasmania; 2, Victoria; 3, South Australia;
4, New South Wales; 5, New Zealand ; 6, Queensland.
The true test of comparative health for this group is
longevity, and in this respect Tasmania again heads the
list:—l, Tasmania; 2, South Australia; 3, New South
Wales; 4, Victoria; 5, New Zealand; 6, Queensland.
The misleading nature of the total death-rate as a test of
comparative health and sanitary condition is still more
forcibly illustrated in regard to comparisons made between
cities where the age groups are differently constituted. Thus
the total death-rates for the following cities are placed in
the order of the highest death-rate for all ages.
Death Rate
per 1,000 persons.
1. Hobart, 1885 24 - 70
2. Sydney, 1884 2333
3. Brisbane, 1885 2T64
4. London, 1885 19 7
5. Adelaide, 1885 18"9
But when we come to analyse the figures it is at once
made apparent that the order is far from correct, as indicating
comparative health or sanitary condition, for the proportion
of age group 60 and over is extremely variable, thus:—
Percentage of Deaths Mean age
over 60 years. at death.
From this it is clear that the Hobart total death-rate of
24-70 per 100, which includes 43-46 per cent, of ages 60 and
over, cannot fairly be contrasted by this means (from a
health point of view) with the other cities, which only contain
from 8"54 to 18"80 per cent, of the old age group. Especially
so when we consider that in Hobart the mean age at death
of the group is the highest.


The truer index of the relative health and sanitary
condition, as computed by the Health Standard, would place
Hobart far before the others. It is not always possible,
however, to make a close estimate of the ages living under 60
in cities, but if we measure deaths under 60 by the estimated
total population, we get a close approximation to relative value
of the condition affecting health and sanitation in the cities
compared, thus :
[Deaths under 60 years per 1,000 persons living -
1. Hobart, 1885 ' 13-97
2. Adelaide, 1885 15-42
3. London, 1885 17-16
4. Sydney, 1884 19"52
5. Brisbane, 1885 19*79
Thus it is evident that the true index to health and
sanitary condition of different places can only be obtained by
eliminating the old age group, as in the method of the
Health Standard. Comparisons by the usual mode are widely
misleading. The very remarkable circumstance that Hobart
shows 43 - 46 per cent, of the total deaths, as being 60 years
and over, with a mean age at death of 74-30 years, is of itself
sufficient as to prove the reasonableness of these conclusions.
The Influence of Migration
The death-rate for all ages is also greatly affected by
Migration, as it invariably disturbs the proportion of the
principal age groups.
The bulk of Immigrants to cities and young Colonies
consists of persons between the ages of 5 and 50. This is the
period of life, as already explained, when deaths are at a
minimum, relative to the same age group living. In most of
the Australasian Colonies the death-rate for this group ranges
between 5‘60 and 7"72 persons per 1,000 living.
Where Immigration is large in proportion to the original
population, there will certainly be a very great fall in the
total death-rate, without any change in the proportional
yields for each age group, and without any material change
in the conditions affecting health.
Thus if a stream of Immigration equal to 10,000 per year of
ages between 5 and 50 were absorbed by a young Colony
whose original normal population was 200,000, with a total
death-rate of 15 40 per 1,000.
Then if the death-rate for ages 5-60 was only 6T7 per 1,000,
it follows that in ten years the total death-rate would be
reduced to 12-32 per 1,000 —that is a fall of 3 - 08 per 1,000 in
the total death-rate without any alteration whatever as
regards death-rate yield for particular ages, and with no


material alteration in the conditions affecting the health or
sanitary state of the Colony.
A corresponding increase in the total death-rate, however,
need not be expected in the country from whence Immigra-
tion proceeded, as the numbers in most cases would be
comparatively insignificant.
Thus if the country from whence Immigration proceeded,
originally numbered 86,000,000, with a normal death-rate for
alleges of 20 per 1,000 —then a stream of Immigration, equal
to 10,000 per year for ten years, of persons between 5 and 50
years of age would only have the effect of increasing the
total death-rate for all ages, by about 0.004 per 1,000.
From such considerations, therefore, it is evident that a
very considerable decline in the death-rate of a young Colony,
which yearly absorbs a large number of Immigrants, may be
almost entirely ascribed to this cause, and not to any improve-
ment in local health or sanitation.
From similar considerations it is also evident that the
comparatively low death-rates of somelarge citiesmaybe due in
great measure to the absorption of fresh country lives between
15 and 40 years, and not to the comparative health and
sanitation of the city. The comparative high death-rate of
young lives in rapidly growing cities confirms this view of the
case. These considerations should be borne in mind in com-
paring the total death-rates of different places, and here again
it may be safely affirmed that the Health Standard, would
prove to be more reliable than the total death-rate as a test of
comparative health and sanitary condition.
The Influence of the JBirth-Eate.
The next most important influence acting as a disturber of
the comparative value of the death-rate for all ages is the
birth-rate.
To appreciate the effect of the birth-rate disturbance it is
necessary to bear in mind that the deaths under 1 year of age
range from about 96 to 220 per 1,000 births per year, and
comprise from about 22 to 25 per cent, of the total deaths.
It follows, therefore, if the birth-rate be abnormally high in
any year, that the total death-rate would be considerably
increased without any disturbance of the local condition
affecting health.
It has long been observed that an improvement in material
welfare leads to a corresponding increase in the marriage and
birth rates, and hence it follows that any unusual improve-
ment in the material welfare of a country has an intimate
relation with causes which tend to increase the proportion of
deaths under one year of age, and thus considerably increase


the total death-rate for all ages without any disturbance of
matters affecting the local health and sanitary conditions.
The foregoing influences may be described as the principal
disturbers of the death-rate index, although in no way
affecting the conditions connected with health and sanitation.
The influences commented upon hereafter (viz., season,
climate, cosmical or epidemic visitations, war, famine and
violence, density of population, etc.,) form a group which
greatly affect both health and death rates for all ages, even
though the state of sanitation be good, or at any rate
normal, and therefore comparatively neutral as regards
death-rate variations.
The Influence of Climate.
Independently of all other causes enumerated, the death-
rates of different countries are seriously affected by special
diseases, which are more or less restricted to given geo-
graphical limits. Yellow Fever may be taken as an example
of diseases of this kind, being mainly restricted to certain
tropical latitudes, and there, again, mostly confined to low-
lying plains adjacent to the sea.*
The total death-rate for such places certainly may give a
fair index of its health from year to year ; but its presence
or absence in different countries is a condition of latitude
rather than local hygiene.
* Hirsch states that in the Western Hemisphere its range extends
between 32 0, 46 K, and 22°'51 S., and in the Eastern Hemisphere between
14 0, 53 N., and s°'7 N.
The Influence of Season.
The seasonal influence has an important bearing upon
health, although its influence is similar in different years.
Its effect, therefore, is seen in the varying monthly or
quarterly death-rates rather than in the total yearly death-
rate.
If we take our own local experience of the influence of
each month, and reduce it to a diagraphic form, we
readily perceive that there is an intimate relation between
the temperature and the death-rate.
These temperature extremes are in January and July, the
first showing the maximum, the second the minimum. Now,
extremes of heat and cold are both injurious to health,
although, upon the whole, the former is more fatal. The
death-rate curve for the year sensitively follows the double
curves of temperature, although the second curve occurring
between April and November appears in inverse order. Thus
the double death-rate curves and double temperature curves
run together (between November and May, and May and
November), the maxima of the two death-rate curves closely


corresponding respectively with the maximum and minimum
curves of temperature, thus :

These curves are best appreciated when shown in diagraphic
form, and comparisons in this way show the close corre-
spondence which exists between deaths from zymotic diseases,
deaths of children, the major maximum total death-rate
curve, and the maximum curve of temperature.
At the same time there may be seen also a close corre-
spondence between the curves of deaths relating to old age,
deaths from diseases of the respiratory system, the minor
maximum seasonal death-rate curve, and the minimum curve
of temperature.
It is clear, therefore, that the death-rate variation of
particular months is of no value in itself as an index of local
sanitary condition, which seldom varies to any extent within
the space of one year, and therefore this form of death-rate
variation must, in nearly all cases, be ascribed principally to
seasonal influences lying beyond human control. The Typhoid
seasonal curve is a very remarkable one. It is at its lowest
point invariably from July to November inclusive, rising
rapidly to its highest point in March, and from that point
falling as rapidly to the beginning of its minimum period in
July.
This curve is not in any way disturbed by the rise and fall
of its death-rate in different years. A glance at the diagram
showing the deaths from Typhoid in Australasia shows clearly
a periodic rise and fall during the last twenty years, with an
average duration of fully four years for each period.
The close agreement between the various widely separated
Colonies in these periodic curves teach us caution in referring
the unusual rise or fall to causes altogether local.
Local causes, no doubt, are fairly indicated by the smaller or
greater intensity of the rise or fall, but the actual tendency


in itself to rise or fall during each period is more probably
referable to some hidden cosmical influence.
Thus there are probably three great causes opeiating, as
regard the variations of Typhoid, viz:—l. Local hygiene. 2.
Seasonal influence. 3. Cosmical influence. None of which
may be neglected in forming a correct opinion from local
death-rate data.
The Influence of Cosmical or Obscure Causes, such
as Epidemics, in Adding to or Varying the
Intensity of Local Cause of Disease Over Wide
Cycles of Years.
If we study the diagram showing the movement of the
death-rate in Australia and Europe since 1850, wo at once
perceive a series of waves generally covering a period of ten.
to eleven years. These are somewhat modified in different
countries by what we may term subordinate ripples upon the
greater wave, but these in no way disturb the close agreement
of the greater waves, or cycles. The length and the time
occupied by each great cycle closely correspond with the sun
spot periodicity.
There can be no doubt of the marked agreement of the
disturbance of the general death-rate of the various Colonies
in Australasia, each of which differs iu the actual death-rate
relative to their respective populations. It becomes a most
important question, then, to enquire whether and how far these
wave like disturbances—not the relative local death-rate
peculiar to each place—are within the limits of human control,
and, therefore, to what extent are they of value as an
indication of local sanitary conditions ?
The cause of this periodic rise and fall in the death-rate
occuring simultaneously in different widely separated
countries is, I admit, a most difficult question. It is open to
us to consider the results as due
1. To human neglect of, or attention to, sanitary conditions
fluctuating simultaneously in different countries, in
' accordance with the periodic fluctuations of the
death-rate.
2. To periodic fluctuations in the intensity of specific zymotic
diseases in centres where they are endemic—but
periodically becoming epidemic or pandemic when the
period of intensity is at its height.
3. To periodic fluctuation in the medium or channels of
conductibility from endemic centres, the death-rate
decreasing with the increase in nonconductibility and
increasing with its increased powers of conductibility.
4. To hidden cosmical influences simultaneously affecting the
life and activity of disease germs throughout wide


regions of the earth’s surface, and fluctuating in a
wave-like rise and fall of longer or shorter cycles, as
in the well known fluctuations of magnetic variations
and sun spot intensities; favourable or unfavourable
conditions in different regions,intensifying or diminish-
ing the general effect, but not altogether dissipating
its influences.
As regards the first of these (human action or inaction) it
needs only to be mentioned to be at once rejected, for
whatever value we may ascribe to the ameliorating influence
of human action in improving sanitary and other conditions
connected with health and the treatment of injury or
disease, and thus lessening the severity of attacks of disease,
whether epidemic or endemic. Still we can hardly conceive
that men’s minds and action should act in concert, consciously
or otherwise, in all local centres over many countries so as to
produce a rhythmic result upon local health, corresponding to
the rhythmic rise and fall observable in the actual death-rate
of countries widely separated during many years.
It must be borne in mind that knowledge tends always to
increase, and improvement must needs follow in one direction,
however slow it may be. Action, though fitful, always fol-
lows upon increasing knowledge, and although it may be
more than counterbalanced by the tendency of people to
become unduly aggregated in old or new centres. Still the
failure to advance with increasing needs would not result in
such rhythmic rise and fall in relation to the generally improv-
ing provisions, so as to agree with the death-rate cycles
referred to.
Again, the habit of referring all unusual epidemic
visitation to a chance medium for its communication from a
distant endemic centre, either by infection or contagion, is a
most unsatisfactory explanation.
This only places us a link further back in a possible chain
of causation. Is it true that the channels of communication
from endemic centres are only open to infection or contagion
at periods corresponding to local death-rate cycles ? Even if
we admitted this in some cases it would still leave us without
an answer in respect of the fluctuations of intensity over well-
marked cycles, in the very centres where a specific disease is
endemic and never wholly absent.
The only natural explanation of these extraordinary
fluctuations, as regards origin, is to refer them to unknown
or obscure cosmical influences, the sum of which may
harmonise with the known periodicity of the death-rate
occurring simultaneously in countries wide apart. This
reference is justified by analogy, with known modes of
cosmical or superterrestrial disturbance. For example, we


know the seasonal variations of temperature corresponds with
the seasonal death-rate variation, and, whether it be a direct
or indirect relation, we must admit that the varying intensity
of the sun’s energy from season to season, has much to do
with the varying effects upon human life.
If, therefore, the small variation of the sun’s position, and
•consequent energy relative to a given portion of the earth’s
surface, produces such noticeable effects within each year
upon temperature, and through it the death-rate, is it not very
reasonable to suppose that variations in the sun’s energy,
independent of the earth’s distance from if, should produce
•corresponding disturbances in harmony with the larger
eycles covering periods of several years ? It is not necessary
to indicate the special form of direct energy exerted by the
sun over terrestrial matter, whether of light, heat, or
magnetism. It is enough for my argument to claim that all
of these, directly or indirectly, exert a most powerful influence
upon terrestrial life and motion. Now, it has been clearly
proved that the sun’s energy is subject to cycles of
•disturbance, in the shape of violent photospheric storms,
producing a perceptible diminution of light emitted, if not of
heat; and what is more important, for the purpose of my
argument, these periodic sun storms—termed sun-spots—
have been proved, by careful observation, to produce upon the
earth a marked corresponding wave of variation in the
magnetic curve.
If this be so, and I see no good reason for doubting the
alleged facts, does it not follow that the variation of the
sun’s energy in light and magnetism must produce effects
upon terrestrial life, corresponding in time with its periodicity,
and in effect, though differing in degree, corresponding with
the shorter cycles of seasons recurring year by year ?
This may be termed a craze, like all other suggestions of a
far-reaching and novel character, but I am quite willing to
run the risk of being accused as crazy on this subject if fact
and reason give it support. That it has much support,
though falling short of perfect demonstration, is very
suggestively borne out by the close correspondence that exists
between the periodicity of the sun spots and that of the Austra-
lasian death-rate during the last twenty years. The general
agreement in Australia between each distant Colony, as
illustrated in diagram, is all in its favour. And, as already
suggested, it may be that in the young Colonies where the
mean death-rate is lower than that of Europe by 10 per 1,000
persons living, and where local artificial causes of death are
at a minimum, the death-rate more sensitively indicates the
■effects of obscure superterrestrial influences than in crowded


centres of population, as in Europe and other Old World
centres.
In any case, whatever difficulty remains unexplained as
regards the periodicity of the death-rate, the reference to a
cosmical or superterrestrial influence has more to commend it
than the other three sources so frequently referred to without
support of a satisfactory character.
Let me not be understood, however, to assert the valueless-
ness of human effort by ascribing the periodical death-rate,
rise, and fall, mainly to far reaching superterrestrial causes,
among which the sun’s varying energy plays a large part.
On the contrary, I desire to affirm that human effort,
directed to selection of sites for dwellings ; supplies of pure
food and water ; to provision against poisonous food and
drinks ; to improvements in sanitary matters, and to facili-
ties or healthful recreation; to improvements in workshops and
factories; to the multiplication of acknowledged' health safe-
guards and of convenient centres for Ihe proper treatment
of disease, as well as to improvement in treatment of injuries
and diseases. In all such matter human effort does much, and
can do more, to mitigate the intensities of attacks of disease,
from whatever source they come, even if it cannot wholly
subdue them. That sanitation and improved treatment has
done much in England during the last twenty years to lower
the death-rate of the younger lives, cannot be reasonably
doubted, and this of itself should encourage local effort
to strive for further improvememt.
Man’s Influence. Density of Population and
Hygiene.
Except as an ideal standard of health, there is not much
value in making comparisons between urban and country
districts, because density of population is itself an important
factor in raising the death-rate. If we examine the mean
death-rate of urban and country districts during the years
1882-5, we find, after making due allowance for old age,
hospitals, and public institutions, that the former indicated
for ages under 60, 1383 per 1,000, and the latter BT3 per
1,000 ; that is a difference of 70T per cent. This is an
enormous difference in favour of country districts. It is
true that the centralisation in the urban districts of
the sick in Hospitals and of paupers and criminals from all
parts of the country artificially increases the death-rate of
the former, and lessens that of the latter, to a much greater
extent than happens in countries where Hospitals and
Asylums are more generally distributed. Notwithstanding
this, however, and while recognising on the average that the
occupations of townspeople are more unhealthy than those^of


people living in country districts, and making due allowance
for the important excess of the age element in urban dis-
tricts, there is still a very great difference, which is difficult
to account for satisfactorily in a young countrv ; and while I
am of opinion that the lower death-rate in country districts
is not due to the relative superiority in artificial modes of
sanitation as compared with urban districts, it is becoming
evident that the closer contiguity of dwellings in towns
demands that artificial sanitary measures in the latter should
be specially framed to provide for those unfavourable condi-
tions peculiar to all crowded centres of population. In
villages and townships the several dwellings, even although
more imperfectly conditioned in themselves as regards local
sanitary provision, are naturally more perfectly insulated
from each other by more or less broad regions of pure air.
The poisoned exhalations of every individual dwelling do not
spread and become more virulent by coming into direct
contact with the poisoned atmosphere of neighbouring
dwellings, but are at once dissipated or purified by that
septum of pure air which it is reasonable to infer insulates
dwelling from dwelling in thinly populated country districts.
In urban districts, on the contrary, the septum of pure air
surrounding each dwelling does "not exist, or only exists
temporarily or imperfectly, and consequently, notwithstanding
special medical supervision, purer water supply, and in many
cases superior sanitary provisions, the death-rate is invariably
higher and the atmosphere of every well regulated dwelling
is more or less in direct contact with the exhalations of every
noxious centre within the town. Hence it would appear that
the absence of the insulating septum of pure air around
town dwellings renders the inmates of every house more
liable to the attack of all infectious diseases which may be
floating in any part of the atmosphere within the town.
Even the otherwise healthy wind may be the agent which
directs the fatal effluvia from an unhealthy centre upon a
relatively pure and healthy division of the town.
A town dwelling, therefore, unlike country dwellings, is
insecure as regards health so long as any centre or dwelling
within its boundaries is allowed to vitiate the common
undivided atmosphere with poisonous exhalations, A special
responsibility therefore rests upon Town Boards of Health
to juevent, as far as possible, the creation and spreading of
all noxious exhalations anywhere within their province.
Improved antiseptic measures should be devised and rigor-
ously enforced in every part of the community.
There can be no doubt that urban and country district
death-rates prove that the crowding together of human
beings in particular centres is injurious to the health, and


although the social needs of modern civilization render it
impossible to prevent such aggregation, wise provision may
mitigate its attendant evils by reducing this tendency to a
minimum. This may be more easily effected in new coun-
tries, by only allowing town allotments to be proclaimed
after the careful selection of healthful sites situated in
localities where a good water supply and healthful drainage
can be secured. Good ventilation, at the same time, can only
be secured by a proper system of streets and lanes, and central
reserves for parks. By prescribing the breadth of great
intersection broadways for each division; the minimum
width of streets and lanes ; the minimum area of central parks
within each division; and the minimum air space in dwellings
and workshops for each person, the tendency to over-
crowding would be minimised, and a healthful circulation of
all quarters secured.
No building should be allowed to be erected 'until plans
of the same, completed according to prescribed forms of
structure, ventilation, and drainage, were passed and approved
by a permanently appointed Board of competent advisers;
and the removal of all refuse and filth should be effected
entirely by the town authorities, by the best methods suited
to the particular locality.
Together with these provisions we must also include the
influence of man in the prevention and treatment of injury
and disease. The healthful selection of Hospitals, the proper
isolation of cases deemed to be contagious or infectious,
and the proper treatment of cases, have also a very important
influence upon the death-rate of each locality.
CONCLUSION.
In conclusion I think it has been made tolerably clear by
these observations, that while the total death-rate for all ages
may be used locally as a fairly reliable index of the health and
sanitary condition of the same place from year to year, it
has been proved to be a most fallacious index as regards the
comparative health and sanitary condition of different localities,
owing mainly to the extreme variability in the proportions
living in different places under the principal age groups.
The elimination of old ages, as in the Health Standard, has
been shown to be a more reliable index between different
countries. As regards variaton from year to year, it is hoped
that the observations made may be helpful to others in
making proper deductions therefrom.
