3. (a) Aeolian Harp (plucked strings)............. Henry Cowell
(b) The Tides of Manaunaun..................... Henry Cowell
(tone-clusters in the left hand)
Manaunaun was god of motion, and long before creation,
he sent forth tremendous tides, which swept to and fro
through the universe, and rhythmically moved the par-
ticles and materials of which the gods were later to make
the suns and worlds. (Story according to John Varian)
(c) Sinister Resonance.......................... Henry Cowell
(muted strings and harmonics)
(d) The Lilt of the Reel........................ Henry Cowell
(tone-clusters in the right hand)
Henry Cowell is known throughout the musical world as
one of the most daring, yet balanced, of innovators. He
is a restless exponent of modernism; yet his whole music
is firmly rooted in a wide study of the “Classic” as well
as of folksong and primitive music. He is perhaps the
only composer who has used all the resources of the mod-
ern piano. His additions to pianistic technic may be
compared to such innovations into violin technic as those
of the I 7th century, when “pizzicato” and “Tremolo” were
introduced by Monteverdi. Percy Grainger.
4. (a) Le Gibet (The Gallows) Ravel
Is it the stir of the night-wind I hear, or the sigh of the man
hanging on the gallows-trees? * * * * Or is it some spider
embroidering a yard of muslin as a scarf for this strangled
neck? * * * * It is a bell chiming on the city wall, while
the sinking sun reddens the body of the hanged man, seen
against the horizon. (From the French of Aloysius Ber-
trand) .
(b) Ondine (The Water Sprite) Ravel
“Listen! Listen! My father strikes the water with a
branch of green reed and my sisters caress with their
foamy arms the islands of cool grass, water lilies and Iris,
or mock the lowly willows which seek to fish them from
the deep.
Her murmured song entreats me to take her betrothal ring
upon my finger, to be the lover of Ondine, to visit with
her in her palace, to be king of the Lakes. When I re-
plied that I loved a mortal, she, pouting and vexed, wept
bitter tears, uttered a scream, fainted and trickled in
white drops along my bluish window pane.
(From the French of Aloysius Bertrand).
(c) Colonial Song.............................. Grainger
In this piece the composer has wished to express feel-
ings aroused by thoughts of the scenery and the people of
his native land, Australia. It is dedicated to the com-
poser’s mother.
(d) “The Hunter in his Career” set by........... Grainger
The tune is from W. Chappel’s “Old English Popular
Music”. The Following (final) verse is typical of the
words associated with the melody:
Thus he careers, over heaths, over meres,
Over deeps, over downs, over clay:
Till he hath won the noon from the morn,
And the ev’ning from the day.
His sport then he ends, and joyfully wends
Home again to his cottage near.
Frankly he feats himself and his guests
And carouses in his career.
