AFFECTIONATE TRANSPORTS.
Young lovers of each degree, pray give attention unto me,
The truth to you I will impart, the cause of my poor aching
heart,
It s once. I loved a beauty bright, and courted her both day and
night,
And to maintain her fine and gay I went to rob on the highway,
But my career was stoppâ€™d at last, for I was taken, tried & cast,
The judge great mercy showed to me, that death recorded I
should be.
My love as you shall understand, she robbed her master out of
hand,
Thinking to clear me with all speed, she was taken for the same
deed,
But when her trial did come on, she prayed to share my doom,
Her sentence was to follow me for fourteen years across the sea,
The ship conveyed us from the shore, our native land to see no
more,
My heart it then did beat with glee, to think my true love I
should see.
X 1 Ox full five months we ploughed the main, m heavy storms of
wind,
It was ordained so to be, near to swan river lauded we,
We both were sold as you shall know, unto a planter for to hoe,
Bnt mark what unto us befel, we ran away and thought it well,
Unto swan river we did repair, and found a boat lying there,
We sailed across quite full of glee, my love and I for to get free.
The wolves and tigers they came down, their dismal cries we*
heard all round,
They dragged her lifeless to their den, which parted me and my
lovely Jane,
So when I found my love was gone I fell into a swoon,
The boat was drifted with the tide and I found myself on the
ocean wide,
I was six days as you shall know, tossed by the billows to & fro,
ISIo land nor light then could I see so I prayed to God to think
on me,
But Monday being the seventh day a ship came bearing down
that way,
They shewed great kindness unto me and we landed safe in
America
