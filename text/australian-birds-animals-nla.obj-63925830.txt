KANGAROO.
The Kangaroo is only native
to Australia, and there are
many species. It carries its
young in a pouch, and the
long muscular tail is used as
a balance to assist in its
leaping movement. Held by
the tail, a kangaroo can be
made to go in any direction
wished. 'They often grow to
a height of over six feet.

AUSTRALIAN KANGAROOS




THE KOOKABURRA.
The Kookaburra or Laughing
Jack is dear to all native
born Australians. Its merry
laughter, usually at sunrise
and sunset, has made it
popular with all, and on this
account it is usually known
as “ The Bushman's Clock."

THE DINGO.
The Dingo is Australia’s
nearest type to the wolf. It
does not hunt in packs, how-
ever, but usually in pairs.
Unless brought to bay, it
will not attack mankind,
but is often very trouble-
some to the flocks of sheep.
It is said to possess more
cunning than the fox.

THE PINK COCKATOO.
The Pink Cockatoo has been
described as the most beau-
tiful of all cockatoos, being a
subdued harmony of rose-
pink and white, with a hand-
some crest of feathers,
banded in crimson, yellow
and white. Like all other
cockatoos, these birds are
practically found nowhere
else outside of Australia.

THE DUCKBILLED
PLATYPUS.
This creature is a world’s
conundrum —it suckles its
young, but lays eggs, and
when full grown has a duck-
like beak. Its feet are webbed,
and the body is covered with
both hair and fur. In the
bank of a stream it will make
its burrow, often titty feet
in length, and is equally at
home on land or water.
Many are the arguments as
to whether it is a reptile,
animal, bird or fish.

HE EMU.
The Emu is Australia’s largest bird, being
second in size only to the Ostrich. They can-
not fly, but are very swift on foot. Being of a
curious disposition, they will often keep pace
with a motor car
for miles at a time, and a
treat of grace anc
i beauty is thus provided to
the motorists.

THE OPOSSUM
The Opossum rarely moves
abroad in the day time; but
ventures forth at night to
feed on the young gum
leaves. Its beautiful coat of
fur is much sought after in
the markets of the world.
When caught early in its
career, it can easily be kept
uncaged, but owing to the
fact that it will jump without
warning on to the object of
its affections, it is not popular
as a pet, except while young.

THE NATIVE BEAR.
This quaint animal holds the affections ot
Australians on account of its inoffensive manner
and child-like trust. It feeds entirely on the
young shoots of the gum tree and when dis-
turbed looks around without any sign of fear.
It carries its one baby, first in its pouch, and
afterwards on its back.
