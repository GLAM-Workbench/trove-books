introductory.
Named after our late revered Sovereign,
Victoria, nestling peacefully in the bosom of
the Southern Ocean, is one of the jewels of
the British Empire. Blessed with a climate
more equable than that of Italy, its “pleasure
days unspoiled by rain, its lustrous nights
secure from chill,” it is the Garden State of
Australia, and, with its infinite possibilities,
is calculated to give race development its
amplest scope. Yet little more than half-a-
century ago this garden was a wilderness.
Historical controversy concerns itself with
the epoch-making names of the men who first
set foot in this “Greater Britain across the
seas”; but the man who laid the foundation
of the present State’s phenomenal progress
and prosperity was he who first within its
confines found gold. Prior to this the pursuits
of the land, peopled by the most adventurous
of the Anglo-Saxon colonising stock, had
been principally Arcadian. Hardy pioneers,
who loved the free air of the mountain, the
mystery of the forest, the fierce excitement
of race and chase, and the honest thrill of
manly sport had braved the dangers of the
bush, and twelve years after the landing of
Batman and Fawkner at Hobson’s Bay, the
little settlement of Port Phillip, as Victoria
was then called, presented the appearance of
a prosperous pastoral community, blissfully
unconscious of the Eldorado of which it was
in possession. This is described by Mr. Brough
Smyth in “Goldfields of Australia,” as fol-
lows :—“For more than 25 years the colony
was traversed in all the more accessible parts
by gentlemen of education, and by men who
had previously been engaged in mining or
who were acquaint? 1 with mineral districts;
and some places, since ascertained to be rich
in gold, were occupied for vears bv shep-
herds and stockmen, who must have had oc-
casion very frequently to disturb the soil, in
which large pieces of gold were embedded;
and yet no one ventured to assert that the
land lying to the south of the Murray River
was likely to be occupied for other than
pastoral purposes. Every district was valued
solely in proportion to the number of sheep
or cattle which each acre would carry. Reefs
of white quartz, standing 20ft. above the sur-
rounding surface, every foot of which con-
tained gold visible to the naked eye, excited
neither curiosity nor enquiry, and the care-
less shepherd, whose earnings amounted to
not more than ros. or 15s. a week, every
day drew water from the creek, beneath
whose bed lay nuggets and grains of gold far
exceeding in value the fee simple of the run
on which he was a labourer.”
But although in part reclaimed from bush
and aboriginal, and although not altogether
unblessed with the advantages of a primitive
civilisation, the whole character of the place
was not so much changed in that twelve
years as it was within the next five. And by
what means was this transformation effected?
How was the most wonderfully rapid de-
velopment of national wealth the world had
witnessed brought about? The answer is
contained in the simple words —by the dis-
covery of gold.
The excitement throughout now be-
came intense. Workmen quitted their em-
ployment, shepherds deserted their flocks,
shopkeepers closed their doors, and a great
tide of fortune-seekers day by day wended
their way to the goldfields. Amongst the
number was the late Marquis of Salisbury,
afterwards Prime Minister of England.
Melbourne and Geelong, the two chief ports,
were practically deserted. Sailors left their
ships in the bay with scarcely a man to take
care of them. One idea possessed them,

and gold had simply to be shovelled into
bags and carted to Melbourne. Colour was
lent to this impression by men who had al-
ready returned from the diggings with for-
tunes made in a week. Fifty pounds weight
of gold had been taken out of one claim,
and in another each member of a co-opera-
tive party had, as the result of six weeks’
work, received as his share 6olb. troy of
gold.
When news of the rich gold deposits
spread it acted like a talisman to attract
population. People sprang from the soil as
if by magic. In five years the population
rose from 77,000 to 463,000, and the basis
of it all was the mining industry. On this
foundation was raised the whole superstruc-
ture of State, a great self-governing State, in-
stinct with national life, dowered with free
and enjoying political rights and
privileges, and a freedom unapproached in
any other part of the world.
Within its walls the world has since laid
its stores, and nouveau-siecle cities with
noble thoroughfares and stately buildings
have arisen. Its waste places have been
turned into waving cornfields, richly laden
vineyards, and smiling homesteads.
•The discoverer of gold has been to Victoria
what the industrial inventor has been to
England, and the achievements of mining en-
terprise are worthy of their place in the an-
nals of State as the most striking example
of enterprise and perseverance which our his-
tory displays.
On the importance to Victoria of the year
1851, historians are agreed. In July of that
year Port Phillip gained its independence,
and from that year onwards its prosperous
career was related under its new name of
Victoria. But the event which made 1851
especially memorable in the annals of Victoria
was the discovery of rich goldfields. The first
useful find was made almost simultaneously
with the granting of autonomy to the colony,
as on the Ist July, 1851, a Californian digger
named James Esmond found gold at Chines,
97J miles north-west from Melbourne. Al-
most on the same day gold was unearthed by
a party of six men only a few miles up the
Yarra, the river on which Melbourne, the
capital of Victoria, is situated. It is, there-
fore, difficult to determine whether or not
Esmond was in reality the first discoverer, al-
though he received honours and emoluments
as such, and in after years was presented with
by Parliament.
But, according to the following letter dated
from Bourke-street, Melbourne, in 1849, even
greater doubt exists as to whether Esmond's
discovery was not anticipated by at least two
years. The writer was Mr. Robert Russell,
first Commissioner of Crown Lands, and a
colleague of Mr. Robert Hoddle, the first Sur-
veyor-General of Victoria, the man who map-
ped out Melbourne with its splendid uniform
streets. The letter was addressed to a rela-
tive in England, to whom Mr. Russell con-
fided the following;—
“ Bourke-street, Melbourne, Feb. 2nd, 1849.
And now for the last novelty —gold! pure,
rich, valuable, undeniable gold has been ob-
tained at the Pyrenees. For some time I con-
fess I was sceptical on the subject; but there
is not the slightest doubt of the fact that
much surface gold has been obtained. After
much rumour, and of course some slight varia-
tions in the statements, the main facts have
been in an extraordinary degree verified (for
common report is not in geneial given to
veracity). The facts are these: —A shepherd
on the station of Messrs. McNeil and Hall,
whose run, amongst others, I surveyed last
year, collected some of the precious metal
first, and took a quantity down to Melbourne
for the purpose of shipping himself off with it
to Sydney or elsewhere. On arrival in town,
however, he had occasion for money, and sold
a lump (value, as I believe, some to a
jeweller for about The jeweller ob-
tained what information he could, and, being
an old hand in the colony, and up to most
things, went craftily and quietly down to the
place he had been told of as the deposit of
the treasure. Not so quietly, however, but
that his gig wheels were tracked and his marks
discovered, the tracks being very much
deeper on his return. Subsequently he again
went to the run, and entered into a negotiation
with the present holder for the purchase of
his interest in it, who, however, was not quite
so uninformed on the subject as the jeweller
supposed, having himself been in possession
of a small piece of gold found by a shepherd.
He discovered that there was something in it
more than a mere ordinary proposal to pur-
chase a run. Meanwhile the Government
heard of the affair, and a party of police were
sent down to the station to keep away fortune-
hunters of the town sort who started to the
land of promise from Melbourne (for the news-

papers got hold of the subject). All this is
of very recent date, and from the latest ac-
counts (which I have from a resident of the
run but yesterday), the vein, if any, is still un-
discovered, but they are, as we used to say in
playing hide-and-seek, getting so hot that I sus-
pect they will soon find it °ut. The surface
gold having been removed, tne difficulty of dis-
covering the spot is, of course, much greater,
and when you remember that these runs are
from 15 to 30 miles long, and partly thickly
timbered, hilly and difficult to over, you
will not wonder that they have not yet found
out the prize. It is a very interesting subject,
particularly so to* me, for I know that country
generally very well, but in my travels never
lit on anything resembling gold. It will be of
much interest in England, for it is no fudge,
and you may rely on my statement as quite
correct. Many little anecdotes relating to it
are interesting; and whispers of a gig heavily
laden having arrived at the before-mentioned
jeweller's at an unusual hour of the night
seem to say that the jeweller had got more
than he purchased. I may mention that he
took with him in his gig a pick, axe, etc.
Should we ultimately find morel of this metal
the first discovery will be an interesting matter
of history. The shepherd is off. I suspect
he has left the clue to his profitable field of
labour behind him.”
For several years after this the history of
Victoria is little more than the story of the
feverish search for gold, with its vast hopes,
its labour, its turmoil, and its madness, its
scenes of exultation and splendid triumph.
The excitement was not only sustained,
but increased as the rich returns continued.
Thousands upon thousands poured into the
colony, their fired by the hope
of finding a royal road to fortune. Some of
them succeeded. In many instances men went
back rich on the return voyage of the ship by
which they had arrived, having abundantly
realised their wildest dreams. Many among
the most successful, however, squandered their
all in senseless prodigality. One man had his
horse shod with gold. Games of “ninepins”
were played with bottles of champagne, and
he who broke fewest had to pay. It came to
be regarded as the duty of a lucky digger to
“shout for”—that is to treat all-comers at a
cost of ,£lOO or more. And that was the life
of “Roaring Camp,” in Victoria.
As already stated, Clunes and Anderson’s
Creek were discovered in July, 185 r. Other
fields followed, hardly a month passed without
its own particular find. Thus August brought
Buninyong and Ballarat, and September Mount
Alexander near the present site of Castle-
maine. In October 10,000 men were at work
on a streamlet near Ballarat, known as the
Yarrowee, and a few weeks later the glories of
these “rushes” were dimmed by Bendigo
Creek. By May, 1852, there must have been
70,00 men in the country between Buninyong
and Bendigo, all engaged in the same occupa-
tion.
The staple industry was mining for gold, of
which, in 1852, one hundred and seventy four
tons were raised, valued at ;£i 4,000,000.
Since then, with the advent of fields in-
numerable, no less than 69,956,44702., valued
at have been won, this being
about one half the quantity recorded for the
whole of Australia.
The industry to-day is in a highly encourag-
ing condition. Though nearly 60 years have
elapsed since the date of the first discovery,
there is still a feverish desire for the winning
of the precious metal. Time has necessarily
changed the conditions. Quartz and reef
mining have taken the place of alluvial, but
the latter still commands considerable atten-
tion, as witnessed by the numerous handsome
nuggets found a few feet within the surface
about 18 months ago at Poseidon, in the
Tarnagulla district, a previously neglected and
deserted area. Dredging for gold, too, plays
no small part in the methods of mining.
Though practically of a new birth, land which
probably would not keep 10 sheep to the acre,
is now being turned over by this process,
the metal contents obtained and the ground
reclaimed for future use by the orchardist and
agriculturist. Quartz and reef mining have
developed by leaps and bounds, and now gold
is being obtained at Bendigo at a depth of
over 4300 ft. from the surface, one of the
greatest depths in the world; at 3200 ft. at Bal-
larat, and at great depths at other places. Deep
leads mining is also in full swing at many
places. Here underground rivers are being dex-
terously dealt with, and the gold contents won.
None of the numerous fields for mining can
be judged as being exhausted —that is, de-
pleted of their full value of gold or other
mineral contents —and many are awaiting the
development that is essential for further pro-
gress.
Although in the front rank as a gold-pro-
ducer. and although giving employment to


about 32,000 persons in this industry alone,
the millions already referred to by no means
represent the extent to which Victoria has
augmented the world’s riches by her mining
industry. In addition to platinum and silver,
most kinds of precious stones —diamonds, sap-
phires, rubies, emeralds, topaz, turquoise, and
others —have been found in Victoria, some of
them being of comparatively common occur-
rence. Then there are the economic minerals,
including coal (black and brown), copper, tin,
iron, lead, antimony, clays of the finest
quality, zinc, and others which exist in con-
siderable quantities.
Incidentally the mining industry has con-
tributed largely to the progress of the pastoral,
agricultural, and manufacturing industries.
Hardly less important than the discovery of
gold in aiding the early development of the
State was the part played by wool produc-
tion. In 1836 the sheep numbered 41,332,
while at the end of 1906 they had
increased, despite so-called droughty sea-
sons, to 11,455,115. It was during
these bad seasons that Victoria had
reason to be grateful to the mining in-
dustry for its augmented output of gold, and
for the splendid manner in which it tided the
State over its difficulties. For the year
1905-6 the wool production was 75,738,3031 b.
The principal crops grown are wheat, oats,
barley, potatoes, and hay. In 1906-7 the
area under wheat was 2,031,893 acres, which
yielded 22,618,043 bushels, or 11.3 bushels to
the acre.
The story of the progress of the wine-
growing, dairying, and frozen meat indus-
tries is most convincingly told in a table pre-
pared by the Government Statist, which is
appended at the foot of this article.
Thanks to the extent of her mountain ter-
ritory, and an ample rainfall, Victoria is the
best wooded of the Australian States, possess-
ing about 12,000,000 acres of woodland.
About twenty of the timbers are of commer-
cial value. The total value of Victoria’s
primary products and manufactures for the
year 1906 was £36,549,206, or an increase
on the previous year of .£2,613,595.
Victoria is at once the most southerly State
of the Australian mainland, and the most cen-
trally-situated State of the Australian Com-
monwealth, having the island of Tasmania to
the south, South Australia and Western Aus-
tralia to the west, and New South Wales and
Queensland on the north. It occupies the
south-eastern corner of the Continent, and has
an area of 87,884 square miles (about
same size as England, Scotland, and Wale*
collectively). From its geographical position
between the 34th and 39th parallels of south
latitude, and the 141st and 150th meridians of
east longitude, it enjoys a climate more suit-
able to the European constitution than any
other State on the Continent of Australia.
The estimated population on the 30th Sep-
tember, 1907, was 1,250,796 —626,931 males,
623,865 females; on the 3-st December, 1907,
it was 1,258,140 —631,140 males, 627,000
females —thus showing an increase of 7344
persons. The natural increase during the
quarter was 4126, and the excess of immigra-
tion was 3218. Tasmania gained from the
State 2181 persons, and New Zealand 853.
New South Wales lost 1278 persons, Queens-
land 407, South Australia 732, Western Aus-
tralia 1776, South Africa 461, and United
Kingdom 1176 to the State.
In the matter of the wealth per head of the
population, three of the Australian States
stand above all other countries in the world,
except Great Britain, and Victoria is one of
the three. The amount of public indebted-
ness is much less per head than in any other
Australian State, and, what is most important,
the greater part of the money that has been
borrowed has been expended upon revenue-
earning railways by 3398 miles, of which the
State is traversed. Revenue has steadily in-
creased, that for 1905-6 being £7,811,475,
and as the expenditure for that year was onlv
£7,261,475, there a surplus of £ss°> 000 -
Since 1850, the year before gold was dis-
covered, the value of Victoria’s imports has
gone up from £745,000 to £25,234,000, and
that of her exports from £1,041,000 to
£28,915,000. These figures incontestibly prove
the value of her resources. Shipping, too, has
expanded from 195,117 tons to 8,136,991
tons. It will thus be seen how magnificent
has been Victoria’s career; how wonderful her
record of progress and prosperity; how liberal
her institutions; how enlightened her people,
on whose ‘ f free, secular, and compulsory” edu-
cation the State annually spends three-
quarters of a million sterling; how nobly in
antipodean Australia she has bom the hal-
lowed name of “Victoria.”

The auriferous lands of Victoria are dis-
tributed over a very extensive area, and are
comprised in no fewer than seventy divisions,
but for the purpose of administration the State
is divided into seven distinct districts. Many
of these districts extend for a distance of
over 30 miles, and in each the several forms
of mining—reefing, alluvial, alluvium, and
deep leads—are conducted with considerable
success in some respects and in others with
more or less profit. But by far the greater
quantity of gold produced comes from the
western goldfields, which comprise Bendigo,
Ballarat, Castlemaine, Maryborough, Beech-
worth, and Ararat and Stawell. The gold
districts and their several divisions are as
follows :

fields can be judged as being exhausted, and
that in many there are still many thousands of
ounces of the precious metal yet to be won.
It has been noted that in times past, where
fields which have been temporarily aban-
doned, due to a degree to a rush to some other
likely locality, have since been mined on pro-
gressive lines, and have brought about estab
lished districts. In the words of Mr. E. J.
Dunn, Director of Geological Survey, “min-
ing in many districts has only been carried to
water level, and profitable returns should be
gained by further development.”

and “pockets,” which characterise certain
well-known districts, there remains the fact
that a lode of the same average productive-
ness may pay well in the upper part, but may
prove unremunerative in the lower part, the
actual yield of gold remaining the same, the
general working expenses being far less for
shallow mines than for deep mines.

reefs were opened up. The country rock in
which gold has been found is of almost every
description and age. It has been found in
sands and clays of recent alluvial deposits;
in quartz reefs, traversing sandstone, slate
and granite, diorite and many other rocks.
Certain portions of the country rock are more
favourable than others for the formation of
lodes and reefs, with their metallic contents.

Thus at Bendigo the reefs are to a great ex-
tent confined to the portion of the country
where the rocks are bent over in arched folds.
When the rocks have been fractured or fis-
sured favourable spaces are formed in which
ore deposits may occur, forming what are
known as the fissure reefs. In some districts
it is found that certain distinct beds of slate
or shale have a direct influence on the gold

course, passed through many phases since the

gold digging was to a large extent mere sur-

great scientifically directed and well organised
industrial enterprise which has carried tne

has turned the giant nozzles of hydraulic
dredging plants on to the auriferous gravel

Goldfields.
BENDIGO.
Gold
Value
Proverbial for its consistent production of
the precious metal, the Bendigo field to-day
occupies a unique position in the mining
world, and is a glistening monument of the
powers of the mining industry. It is still in
the vanguard of progress. Already its output
of gold has long since reached some millions
of ounces —18,596,700 —its annual contribu-
tion is reckoned by some hundreds of thou-
sands of ounces, it has the distinction of hav-
ing one of the deepest gold mines in the
world, while greater depths in search of gold
are still being attained, and best of all the
fortunate shareholders in the mines have, to a
highly satisfactory degree, made handsome
fortunes from their investments. To-day
Bendigo holds a position akin to that of the
Kalgoorlie goldfield in Western Australia —
the premier producing field in the State, with
the promise of permanence for years to come.
In short, it is the “biggest thing in Eastern
Australia.”
Situated 100 miles from Melbourne —the
Queen City of the South, and the metropolis
of the State—with which it is connected by an
established railway, the City of Bendigo ex-
tends over a few low hills from the Big Hill
range. It occupies an area of 7856 J acres,
and is adjoined on the north by the borough of
Eaglehawk, to which place the mines of
Bendigo field extend. Fifty years ago Ben-
digo was a sheep walk. A brilliant transfor-
mation has since been effected. To-day it
is the second principal inland city in the
State, with a population of over 32,000; it
has over a hundred miles of splendidly-formed
streets, palatial private and public edifices,
well-equipped electric tram service, numerous
parks, magnificent water supply—in fact,
everything in keeping with a prosperous and

contented community. The climate is most
agreeable and exhilarating, and the soil is
adapted for vine growing, the surrounding
country being covered with vineyards and or-
chards, apples, pears, grapes, and almonds
being among the fruits most successfully culti-
vated. These achievements are in brief some
of the rewards of the gold dug from the
bowels of the earth.
Gold was the magnet which attracted people
to the place in 1851. It was not scattered
broadcast on Golden Square—the scene of the
first find —nor was it seen outcropping on the
surface. At that period it had its being a
few feet from grass roots. All who went
thither in search of the hidden treasure were
not rewarded. Disappointment followed dis-
appointment, and it is chronicled that many
pronounced the place a rank duffer, and de-
parted. Others who remained were more for-
tunate. Nuggets —that all enchanting word—
were unearthed. A bigger rush followed, and
within four years (during which time Bendigo
was proclaimed a municipality), the alluvial
diggings became famous as the best in the
colony, as Victoria was * then called. The
alluvial gold drift was found in the old pipe
clay and slate beds. The tin dish and cradle—
then the most popular appliance for winning
the gold—were used, but these proved inade-
quate, and soon there were some 3000 pudd-
ling machines at work. And what a store-
house of treasure was in the drift. Sensa-
tional finds were made. The first nugget,
weighing 5730 Z., was discovered in 1852.
Other large pieces were brought to light in
rapid succession. One turned the scale at
3400 Z., another at 3320 Z,, another at 3370 Z.,
another at 3390 Z., and sixth at 28802.
Quartz reefing began in 1853 and 1854.

Latham and Watson found two “saddle reefs”
on the Hustler’s line, and constructed the first
crushing machine. As reefing came to the
front the alluvial claims were deserted, and,
indeed, the principal gullies had been well
cleaned out, the only alluvial left being in the
outside districts. The Lower Huntly deep

field are either “spurs” —veins or masses of
quartz irregularly crossing the bedding of the
rocks —portions of “saddle reefs” laid bare
by denudation, or quartz “legs,” bodies of
quartz running with the strata, and that were

to a depth of 120 ft., and for a width of from
200 to 500 ft.
Since then marked progress has been made,
and to-day quartz mining is being profitably
carried on at a depth of over 4300 ft. For
scientific mining, probably no field offers
greater possibilities. Within the limited confines
of these pages, however, it is not proposed to
deal with the physical aspect, geology, auri-
ferous zones, rock structure, etc., for all these
degrading and denuding forces have removed.
The most peculiar feature about the
quartz veins of the district is the occurrence
of the so-called “saddle reefs.” These are
bodies of quartz of lenticular form that are
bent over the axial lines, both anticlinal and
synclinal, but only to a moderate extent are
they found along the synclinals. On the
course of the anticlinal axes they are largely
developed, the superficial transverse section

amounting to 400 or more superficial feet.
They extend continuously along the axes for
miles, thickening out or diminishing in size
as they are traced along, they occur conform-
ably with the bedding in a general way, and
have the same beds bounding them for great
distances, they “pitch” with the pitch of the
strata, and they also “dip” with the strata,
though the continuation of the quartz with the
the quartz ceases; such joints are commonly
known as “channels.” The legs are seldom
more than 3ft. to 4ft. across; like the “saddle
reefs,” of which they form a part, they fre-
quently extend for very considerable distances
with the strike of the rocks; they are conform-
able to the strata, lying between the bedding
planes. The “legs” are simply the thinner
continuation of the quartz downward from the
POPPET HEADS, TRAMWAY
AND ENGINE HOUSE.
*‘dip” is not so extended as with the “pitch.”
The extension east and west of the “centre
country” of the quartz downwards from the
“saddle reefs” are known as “legs.” The “legs”
often thin out rapidly in the form of a wedge,
in some cases they extend to a depth of 300 ft.
or more below the “saddle reefs,” but as a
rule they seldom exceed 100 ft. in depth below
the cap of the “saddle reef,” the joint between
the beds or “back” often continues well de-
fined for considerable distances bevond where

“centre country.”
The “saddle reefs” are often from 20 to
50ft. across, measuring horizontally over- the
“saddle” or stone on which the quartz rests,
and which divides the east from the west legs;
they are frequently 20 to 30ft. in height, and
in some cases the quartz extends upwards
through the fissured rocks for a height of
100 ft. or more. They are of an infinite va-
riety in form, as might be expected from the

varied conditions under which they originated.
Generally they appear to have formed in cavi-
ties caused by the bending over sharply of the
rigid rocks of this region; these cavities re-
sulted when two beds were in contact that
yielded unequally at the point of bending or
along the lines of arching. In this lunate-
formed cavity, which would extend along the
axial lines as far as the conditions of the beds
were identical, the quartz of “saddle reefs”
formed. Tt happened in some cases that the
foliae is considered in that light. The
“saddle reefs” were formed of white crystalline
quartz, in which rudimentary cleavage planes
are abundant, very extensive masses are of
snowy whiteness. This is not considered sa
favourable to the presence of gold as a cer-
tain amount of streakiness caused by the scal-
ing off from the walls of thin laminae of car-
bonaceous slates. In tracing these “saddle
reefs” out in length they are found in some
cases to diminish so much that at last there is

enormous strains exerted on the rocks at the
arch was so great that the rocks as the bend
became sharper were riven, and they opened
out. Into these cavities the quartz forming
the “saddle reefs” also extended. At first the
quartz probably accumulated in the cavities
from telluric waters holding silica in solution,
and probably the process somewhat resembled
that under which agates are formed in dole-
rites, except that there are no bandings, un
less the streaking of some of them by slaty
merely a thread of quartz or even a joint only
to indicate where the reef should be; in such
cases by tracing the joint out along the strike
it will be found to again expand, and further
large bodies of stone may be encountered.
These “saddle reefs” are not only of great
size in places, of remarkable persistence in
length, but they are also notable for recurring
in depth one below the other. In the Lazarus
there are from the surface to the 2200 ft. level
no less than 24 of these “saddle reefs,” thirteen

of which are auriferous to a profitable degree.
Some of these reefs are very small just as
others are of enormous size, yielding enough
stone in some cases in a length of a few
hundred feet to keep a mine busy for years.
It is when these several characteristics of the
“saddle reefs” are fully appreciated that the
vast resources of the district becomes appar-
ent.
“Saddle reefs” are not confined in the district
to those belts of strata which are gold-bearing
alone; the anticlinal axes pass right through
all the silurian beds, barren, moderately auri-
ferous, and richly auriferous alike, and as the
“saddle reefs” have resulted from the bending
over of the strata along these lines, they are
met with in the barren rocks as well as in those
that are auriferous. It does not follow that be-
cause a “saddle reef” on the surface on a par-
ticular anticlinal axis is barren therefore the
succeeding “saddle reefs” below will also
be barren, but they may be expected to be-
come moderately productive in gold at a
greater depth, and still further down to be rich
in gold.
In addition to the “saddle reefs” the quartz
makes in “spurs,” which cut across the coun-
try strata at all angles, sometimes running
parallel to the strike of the rocks, sometimes
at right angles to it, sometimes flat, some-
times perpendicular, and sometimes filling
gaps caused by faults. How profitably spurs
can be worked has been shown in many mines.
They are larger and more frequent in sand-
stone country than in slate, but in both cases
they are often highly auriferous. In width
they vary , from a streak to 4ft. or sft., and in
some mines have been worked for a length of
hundreds of feet, and in the New Moon for
a width of 120 ft.
The field j comprises a long network of
reefs, the lines on which most mining is now
being carried on being the New Ghum, Devon-
shire, Garden Gully and Johnson’s, The Pyke
and Moon, Hustler’s, and Sheep’s Head. Then
there are the Diamond Hill mines, and numer-
ous other ventures which help to swell the gold
returns to an appreciable extent. The auri-
ferous resources of the district are practically
inexhaustible, and afford employment to be-
tween 6500 to 7000 miners. Some of the
lines of reef are being worked for an extent
totalling fully 22 miles north and south of the
city, and are being proved to be phenomenally
rich. Many of the oldest mines have been
proved to a great depth.
Last year’s operations did not result as
satisfactory as in former years, but this, is
largely due to the amount of development
work taken in hand, the fruits of which will be
seen during the current year.
There are about 200 mines in active work
on the field. The gem of the cluster is the
Garden Gully Co., which holds 635 yards
along the line of reef, of the same
names as the company on which there are three
shafts. Their No. 1 shaft is down 2650 ft.,
and the No. 3 or southern shaft is 960 ft. Their
last good reef was situated about the 1440 ft.
level, and from this they disbursed ,£848,817
13s. 3d. in dividends. The lease of this com-
pany embraces another line of reef, known as
the Paddy’s Gully, which has been very rich
in places further south. It is a mine that is
always well engaged in valuable prospecting
work, and although under the shadow of de-
pression at present, is not easy stock to pur-
chase. With such a large, and what has been
a good lease, there is always that sanguine
feeling among local investors that further rich
reefs wall be discovered in the deeper grounds,
and values will accordingly bound up a
hundred fold. The total gold yield is over
416,00002.
The New Chum Raihvay mine is the deep-
est on the field, and one of the deepest in the
world. A journey of 4300 ft. is a long way
from the clouds to terra firma, but when it is
done daily, into the bowels of the earth by
men for their daily sustenance, it causes one
to wonder where man’s limit will cease. The
company was formed in 1878, and is m
38,890 shares, with a lease of 23 acres, going
300 yards along the line of reef. The past
records of the company are good. It has
crushed 170,944 tons for i09,845J0z. of gold,
dividends amount to £171,077 7s. 6d., hav-
ing been paid on a called-up capital of
£40,579. It is computed that over £85,000

claims prior to the formation of the present
company. From one reef alone, worked in
1895, which was situated above the 2878 ft.
level, the profit was ,£78.391, or 425. 6d. per
share. Strong formations are the rule in this
mine, consequently any important discovery
means several years work before the reef is
broken out. Owing to the reef channels
trending east in their descent, and the shaft
going down perpendicularly, each crosscut has

to be driven further east than the previous
one, but it also means that the more west-
ern formations get correspondingly nearer the
shaft. The shaft is now being sunk in the
syncline or trough, between the New Chum
line; and one of what is known as a side line.
Later on with a short crosscut west, this
side line will be intersected, and in the event
of being any good, will prove an incentive to
the mines north and south to go in search
of it also. It will, therefore, be noted that
this company is not only pioneering the way
into the deep ground, and thereby furnishing
an object lesson to the world, but will also
demonstrate the worth of the adjoining side
line.
The most consistent dividend payer on the
field is the New Moon Co. Altogether it has
crushed 438,370 tons for i92,i240z. gold,
valued ,£630,778, and has paid ,£341,128
in dividends, average £l3 14s. per share. Prior
to 1869 (in 1867) when the original Co-opera-
tive Company was formed in 16 shares, fhev
sunk a shaft, and after expending ,£l6O (be-
ing 10 calls of £1 each per share) obtained
payable quartz at 173 ft. below the surface,
enabling dividends to the amount of £2728 or
£l7 1 os. per share to be paid. Machinery was
erected and the company registered in 1870 in
24,000 shares. Dividends continued after
registration in 1870 and 1871 to the extent
of £6600 or ss. 6d. per share; calls then fol-
lowed during the next six years, when in 1878
four dividends of sixpence per share were ob-
tained from the old workings between 180 ft.
and 240 ft. In this year the adjoining lease
north was purchased; this included the pre-
sent main shaft, then down 400 ft. with a suit-
able winding plant erected complete. Both
shafts were kept going for some time with the
assistance of tribute parties. In 1883 opera-
tions were confined to the main shaft, and
since that date the South shaft which had at-
tained a depth of 490 ft, has remained idle.
The workings down to 300 ft., but principally
at and above the 240 ft. level, by the com-
pany and tributers, produced 57,250 tons
yielding 23,30002. of gold, an average of Bdwt.
per ton. At 360 ft. very little prospecting was
done on three distinct runs of stone inter-
sected in the crosscut west, but the average
vield of that crushed was about sdwt. to the
ton. Crosscuts were driven west at 415 ft. and
475 ft.; the former 200 and the latter rooft..
which completes the prospecting done in this
shaft, and as all the workings of the past 15
years have been in a channel of country fur-
ther west, and deeper than the south shaft
workings, the company has a very fair
prospect in this direction when the ground is
fairly opened up. Very large deposits of
quartz have been developed at the different
levels opened up, and the experience has been
that there is a little gold fairly evenly distri-
buted throughout these large formations, with
occasional patches of better quality, more es-
pecially where the quartz occurs in smaller
quantities. These, when taken together by
system in working, gradually adopting better
method by the experience gained, and improv-
ing the appliances and machinery so as to ob-
tain a maximum quantity of crushing material
at a minimum of cost, combined with the
fact that the progressive work has always been
well ahead, are the leading features in the
steady progress made. The company has re-
cently installed a powerful electric winding
plant.
The Great Extended Hustler’s Co. has had
a magnificent record. Gold was discovered
on this ground in 1853 by Jonathan Harris,
an African black, who had several other
“coloured men” for mates. The claim proved
a rich one, and the party took their success
so much to heart that they revelled exten-
sively, and engaged a band to play on the
ground. They soon, however, sold out to
J. Hustler (a one-armed man, whose name was
given to the reef he subsequently worked so
successfully), Jonathan Latham, and John
Watson. This party got very fine yields near
the surface, as much as roooz. to the load
being occasionally obtained. Latham and
Watson (Hustler had been bought out), which
was immediately north of the last-named, was,
however, “the daddy of them all,” a reef
worked between 400 ft. and 600 ft. from the
surface being so rich that, it is said, over
£500,000 worth of gold was obtained from
it. When in 1867 the Duke of Edinburgh
visited the city, he was banqueted in the 400 ft.
level of this mine, the floors of the huge ex-
cavation made by the removal of the reef be-
ing carpeted and the walls draped, while the
whole of the workings were brilliantly lighted.
This mine has now produced over 300,00002.
of gold, and has paid dividends amounting to
£’500,000.
The above may be accepted as some of the
principal ventures on the field.
Other extensive mines, which have con-
tributed in no small degree to the gold vield

Rushworth. The Heathcote reefs were first
worked in 1854, and yields of over 20 to 3002.

The Ruslrvvorth and Whroo reefs were very
rich when first worked, returns of as high as
5002, to the ton being obtained. They are
usually in flat floors, and are in two belts,
having a generally easterly and westerly course.
The Whroo mines were also very rich, one
alone turning out .£250,000 worth of gold
from the surface to a depth of 250 ft. The
Balaclava reef treated a party working it to
£25,000 in 13 months, and the reef was after-
wards cut at a depth of 360 ft., but not worked.
The principal mining field in the Kilmore
division is at Reedy Creek. One of the prin-
cipal reefs on the field was the Langridge.
which gave splendid returns to a depth of
300 ft., below which it was not worked. The
Leviathan and Tunstail reefs, a large dyke for-
mation with rich quart 2 veins, were worked to
water-level, and proved very rich.

the amount of gold purchased by the various
banks in the district from November, 1851, to

BALLARAT.
Gold Yield to Date
“The Golden City" and “The City of
Statues” are titles by which Ballarat, Victoria’s
most important inland town, is known through-
out Australia. Both are well-deserved, and
after familiarising himself with its art treasures,
its imposing public edifices, and its broad, tree-
shaded avenues, the visitor, ignorant of its his-
tory, would find difficulty in realising that sixty
years ago the site whereon it stands was a mere
thinly timbered waste of hills and gullies. As
before narrated, it was the discovery of gold
at Ballarat in 1851 which m irked the new era
for the colony, which attracted the great rush
from all parts of the world, which made the
locality the great centre whence radiated the
pioneering energies destined to be so richly re-
warded, and which laid the foundation of the
prosperity the city has since enjoyed. To-day
it yields in point of attraction and development
to no modem rival. It stands at an elevation
of about 1500 feet above sea level, about 80
miles north-west of Melbourne, on the main
railway line to Adelaide. For purposes of local
19,730.4930 z.
government it is divided into Ballarat East and
Ballarat West, each a distinct municipality
under the government of a mayor and council-
lors, the portion west of the Yarrowee Creek
being a city, and the eastern portion a town.
The city has an area of 4090 acres, with a
population of over 26,000. The nei annual
value of ratable property is The
town’s area is 4331 acres, and population
19,000, and the annual value of ratable pro-
perty is The two municipalities were
established in 1855, and in 1870 Ballarat West
was proclaimed a city.
The city (and for present purposes Ballarat
West and Ballarat East may be treated as
forming one city) is admirably laid out, has for
many years been splendidly lighted by gas and
electricity, and has a splendid service of elec-
tric trams. Its streets are mostly fine, broad
avenues, and the principal one, Sturt-street, is
charmingly laid out as a park, and dot-
ted with seats beneath giant gums and trees of
less size that give better shade. In this street
24
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES


is situated the Town Hall, which is, perhaps,
the most striking and beautiful edifice in the
city, and between this building and Yarrowee
Creek are to be found the majority of the
many handsome business places that help to
make Ballarat animated and beautiful.
Ballarat has been made famous not for gold
only, but as having been the scene of the only
organised resistance to constituted authority
which has marked the history of the State. The
trouble arose from the imposition of a miner’s
license fee of 30s. per month. This was stoutly
opposed by the miners, who at length rose in
arms and entrenched themselves within an en-
closure known as the Eureka Stockade. This
was attacked by the 40th Regiment under Cap-
tain Thomas on 3rd December, 1854, and was
taken by storm, some 30 or 40 miners being
killed on the one side and Captain Wise and
three privates on the other. A monument has
been erected on the site of the Stockade. The
outcome of the riot was the practical abolition
of the obnoxious tax and the subsequent be-
stowal upon the State of a responsible form of
government.
The best evidence of the success of the
mines of the Ballarat district is afforded by
the dividends paid since 1889. which total
while the gold won since 1851
amounts to no less than 19,730,49302.
The Ballarat mining district, as previously
pointed out, includes the following divisions:
—Buninyong, Beaufort, Berringa, Blackwood.
Bitfield Plains, Piggoreet, Smythesdale, Steig-
litz, Smeaton, Creswick, Egerton and Gordon,
and Meredith, all comprising a length north
and south of about 60 miles by a width of,
say, 50 miles.
The City of Ballarat is situated pretty well
in the centre of it, in the country known as
“The Divide” of Victoria, and the rocks
around, in common with those of most of the
other goldfields of the State, are composed
principally of sedimentary strata of Silurian
origin, through passages in which have been
ejected vast quantities of volcanic matter of
the basalt class. So far as can be traced the
gold was first found at a place now known as
Hiscocks, not far from the homestead then at
Black Hill, about six miles north of this, but
it was its discovery at Golden Point, in Ballarat
East, which set upon the auriferous character
of the country the seal of certainty and perma-
nence. When the great rush of 1851-2 set in
the diggers went to work in a manner similar
to that practised by those who do not under-
stand the game they are about to engage in,
but experience is a kindly yet stern suggestor,
and very soon methods were adopted and ap-
pliances came into use fitting with the require-
ments of the calling. These latter comprised
puddling tubs, cradles, and short sluice boxes.
As might be expected, the first attack was
made on the higher parts of the field, where
the bed-rock, carrying boulder washdirt, was to
be met with on the surface. The rise since
known as Golden Point received the most at-
tention, and here great wealth was met with
in a layer of washdirt bedded on the surface
of the rock and just under the cements. The
diggers were not long operating on these de-
posits before they found that the surface of
the bed-rock had been cut into by a net-work
of small gutters, which, on operations being
extended to lower parts, were seen to be but
the fringe of an ancient system of drainage.
Then followed mining operations by windlass,
whip, and whim into “deeper ground.” The
washdirt met with on the higher parts of the
Ballarat field, as all the world knows, proved
to be very rich, and as mining extended to
the lower parts, and along the course of the
main gutter, it was seen that these stores of
golden treasure had been opened on the
outer edge of a cabbage-leaf-shaped watershed,
whose main stem or trunk (which lay south)
had been buried by a volcanic covering. This
main gutter had cut its way through the ter
raced wash-beds of earlier tertiary times. As
with the higher ground, its gravel proved to
be exceedingly rich. There being more water
to contend with as operations advanced under
the volcanic plateau, powerful steam winding,
puddling, and pumping machinery plants filled
the place of the horse and hand turn-outs used
on the higher ground. Company after com-
pany took up the running in consecutive order,
and the bed of this ancient river (with the
beds of its numerous tributaries and high
fringes) was lifted and put through puddlers
througout an area which extended south from
Ballarat proper for a distance of about 15
miles, and as a result more than
worth of gold was obtained.
The quartz mines of the Ballarat or Central
division occur in three distinct series—Little
Bendigo, Ballarat East, and Ballarat West.
These three lines are approximately parallel.
The most northerly and easterly line is that of
Little Bendigo, extending for some two miles
in length to Black Hill. From the dividing line
of Black Hill the Ballarat East line begins,
2 5

26

and stretches southward tor seven or eight
miles. Yet a mile further west is the Ballarat
West line, extending for some three miles
north and south under the Sebastopol Plateau.
The most important lode-line of Little Ben-
digo is known as the Monte Christo, of which
the reefs are bounded by two parallel walls
Soft, apart. Between these walls are bands of
sandstone and slate, traversed by a series of
flat quartz veins, which pitch to the south, and
dip to the east. The gravels along this line
were very rich; the reefs were fairly rich near
the surface, and the gold occurred in fairly de-
fined shoots; but, hitherto, the reefs have not
proved profitable with the methods of mining
adopted in the deeper levels (300 to 600 feet).
A band of slate in the middle of the lode in
the Metropolitan mine is called Jarvis’ Indi-
cator. The Grey Horse group of reefs at the
northern end of the field were extraordinarily
faulted, the shoots of ore very short, but so
close together that they could be profitably
worked, and they have been followed down to
a depth of 600 ft. The Temperance line is cut
•off to the south by a fault, beyond which it has
not been traced. The Yorkshire line, which
also occurs at Little Bendigo, should, perhaps,
be regarded as the easternmost member of the
Ballarat East line. The Temperance line has
lodes of laminated stone, with smooth walls
and shoots pitching to the south.
The working of the East mines naturally
passed through three stages. The first work
was done in the superficial gold-bearmg de-
posits, and in the leads buried under the clays
and sands of the existing gullies. Secondly, as
the surface deposits were exhausted, com-
panies were forced to take over larger areas,
and work by deep shafts, and long under-
ground drives. Various quartz reefs were dis-
covered during these operations. The quartz
was proved to be auriferous, and the larger
alluvial companies gradually developed into
quartz mines. In spite of the unusual character
of the East mines they have made steady pro-
gress.
The development of the division was greatly
aided in 1887-8 by two diamond drill bores
by the Mines Department. These bores
were regarded as highly successful, “as aurife-
rous stone was brought up from two different
levels (the deepest 91 1 feet), in No. 1 bore (at
the East railway station), and from 758 feet in
No. 2 bore, besides numerous quartz cores of
promising appearance, though not actually
showing gold. These results unmistakably tend
to establish confidence as to the future pros-
perity of deep quartz mining in the locality.”
These bores showed that the gold-bearing
quartz reefs extended to a depth of over
2000 ft, and greatly aided the development of
this field by inspiring capitalists with confi-
dence in the downward continuation of the
reefs.
The lodes of the West appeared normal.
But at the East the quartz was distributed on
a very different plan. The plan of the gold
distribution at the East was gradually un-
ravelled as mining proceeded. The compara-
tive poverty of most of the quartz was com-
pensated for by the occurrence of irregularly
scattered nuggets or rich nuggety patches. The
distribution of these patches appeared at first
erratic; but, as the mines were worked, the
clue to 1 their distribution was discovered.
These rich patches occur where the flat quartz
veins, or floors, intersect thin vertical lines of
dark-coloured slate. A quartz vein crossing
such a band of slate was often extremely rich
beside it, whereas 18 inches on either side it
might be quite barren. Thus, Dr. Don tells
us: —“Away from the indicator, the greater
part of the quartz vein is absolutely barren;
but at the intersection with the indicator large
masses of gold (often more than roooz. in one
piece), have been obtained, and the greater
part of the gold extracted from this —i.e., indi-
cator —belt, has come from those parts of the
quartz veins near some of the indicators. ” Ac-
cordingly, the miners, by following these ver-
tical lines, were able to pick up these rich posi-
tions with a minimum of dead work. As these
lines of indicated the direction which the
mining should follow, they were called “indi-
cators.” There are several claimants for the
discovery of these indicator linesj but the
credit is generally attributed to Mr. Morgan
Llewellyn, who was working on the Black Hill
Flat in April, 1871. He there cut, at a depth
of 80ft., a series of thin, horizontal veins of
quartz, which yielded 1570 Z. of gold. Most of
the gold was found where a seam, which is
said to have been pyritic, intersected thin floors
of quartz; the seam guided him from patch to
patch of gold. As the seam indicated the most
profitable line of work, Llewellyn called it the
indicator, and this name has since gained wide
popularity among Victorian miners. The name
“indicator” has been widely used in mining lite-
rature owing to the practical value of the indi-
cators, and the apparent ease and certainty
27

with which they can be used. The name has
been extended to other mining fields, where it
is applied to structures different from those
which are found at Ballarat. The indicator
structures are the best known and most cha-
racteristic features of the East goldfield, the
mines of which are sometimes described as the
“Indicator Series.”
The indicator bands, though typical of the
East field, do not extend through all its mines.
Two distinct types of mines occur in that field.
The northern mines contain large quartz lodes,
which are developed along fault lines. They
are not fissure lodes; they have not been
caused by the filling in of open fissures, but
by drainage along fracture lines. Much of the
richest gold-bearing quartz in these mines oc-
curs along a big strike fault, whereon the
crushing of the slates has produced a seam of
tough, leathery “pug,” or fault rock, locally
known as “Leather Jacket,” This name is
sometimes extended to the fault line and the
quartz along it, which is said to be “Leather
Jacket quartz,” or* to be “on the Leather
Jacket.” The mines in the northern part of
the Ballarat East field may be grouped to-
gether as of the Leather Jacket type. The
typical “Indicator” mines are in the southern
part of the field, and are east of the belt of
country traversed by the Leather Jacket fault.
The faults at Ballarat play a very important
part in the geological structure of the mining
field. There are two chief types of faults.
The first are reversed strike-faults, or slides,
the courses of which are parallel to the strike
of the rocks. In some of the strike-faults the
movement has taken place along the bedding
planes, but, as a rule, the fault plane crosses
the bedding at a low angle. The second type
of fault is the cross-course, which cuts trans-
versely across the rocks. E, Lidgey, formerly
of the Mines Department, enumerates 46 cross-
courses in a length along the field of 3J miles.
Some of the cross-courses are small, with a
heave of only a few feet; one has a heave of
140 feet; and, according to Lidgey, the cross-
course in the Prince Regent mine has a heave
of 612 feet. These cross-courses are normal
faults, and the heave is usually greater than
the throw. In most cases the rocks to the
south of the cross-course are heaved to the
west. The formation of these faults extended
over a long period of time. One fault is often
broken and displaced by a later, intersecting
fault. Some of the faults were, no doubt,
formed earlier than the deposition of the gold.
because the gold has been deposited along the
fault planes. In other cases the faults are
later; thus, at both the Normanby North and
North Woah Hawp mines, a fault cut across
one of the gold nuggets and displaced the two
parts by a distance of some feet. At other
places—as in the North Woah Hawp mine, in
I 9°3 —some of the slickensided fault surfaces
are glazed with gold, due to the grains having
been rolled out into a film, as thin as the finest
gold-leaf.
The principal mines in the East field are the
Victoria United, Last Chance, Llanberris No.
1, Normanby North, New Normanby, North
Woah Hawp. This field has been making
headway of late, and is at present the most ac-
tive centre of the Ballarat district, and the
Victoria United mine has during the last year
ranked next to the Jubilee in the Scarsdale
division of the district as a producer and profit
distributor. During the last quarter of 1907
these mines turned out approximately about
28000 Z. each, and paid respectively and
in dividends. In all the Victoria United
has produced 88,7080 z. of gold, and the Jubi-
lee 76,8040 z.
The most southerly and westerly of the series
of mines is that of Ballarat West. The reefs of
this part of the field do not outcrop on the
surface, as its whole area is covered by basalt.
It has supplied a vast amount of alluvial gold,
which has been obtained from the continuation
of the leads rising on the White Horse Range.
The story of how the mechanical obstacles to
the working of these deposits were overcome
well illustrates the courage and indomitable
perseverance of the Australian miner. Gold
was found in the gravels under the Sebastopol
Plateau, in such quantities, and so rough and
coarse in grain, that it had clearly been de-
rived from local reefs; all of it could not have
been derived from the weathering of the White
Horse Hills to the east. Hence, the working
of the leads led to the mining of the under-
lying reefs, which have since been followed to
the depth of over 3200 ft. There are five com-
panies at work at present on the West line,
viz., the New Koh-i-noor, Band Loch, South
Star, Star of the East, and Central Plateau.
The South Star Company was subsidised by
the Government under what is known as the
Mines Development Act, and the most impor-
tant work at present in progress in the Sebas-
topol Plateau is the prospecting at depths un-
dertaken by the company. Rough gold has
been struck at a depth of over 3200 ft., and the

opinion that good stone exists for an unknown
distance below this level has led to the shaft
being sunk another lift and a cross-cut put in
at 3175 ft. This is the deepest point at which
mining is being carried on in the division.
The foregoing account of the district, while
•dealing with Ballarat proper, leaves unwritten
the glories of the innumerable outlying fields
comprehended within this mining district, all
of which have played an important part in the
mining history of Victoria by reason of their
auriferous productiveness. The millions won
for the first few miles of the Berry-Creswick
lead, at the head of which the Berry United is
still working as part of a comprehensive scheme
for developing the deep lead system of Vic-
toria, described in another portion of this pub-
lication, is alone evidence of the fame achieved
by one of these fields.
Immediately north of Ballarat proper, and
on the northern slope of the “Divide,” the
main gutter of the Allendale and Kingston sys-
tem of alluvial deposits gets its rise. Like the
shallow diggings of Ballarat proper, it received
attention early in the fifties, and the flourish-
ing mining town of Creswick was established
at a point, say, six miles north of the head of
the gutter, and about eleven miles north of
Ballarat. In due course discoveries were made
to the north of the town, at a high part of
Silurian country, but thinly covered with vol-
canic rock, and the riches which came to
light again started mining activity at Creswick.
This find proved to be another tributary to the
main Creswick gutter, and its wealth amply re-
warded the majority of venturers which took
part in the scramble for its gold. Then fol-
lowed a general mining move into the plains,
and townships sprung up as company after
company went “feeling for a grip” on the gold
further ahead. The Berry group of mines
opened the field on the north, and eventually
part of an alluvial system, contained in a dis-
tance north and south of about eight miles,
was mined for a return of about 2,800,00007.
of gold. As this total cost less than 60 per
cent, of its value to produce, mining for it
proved to be a pleasant undertaking.
The Creswick gutter system is not unlike
several stems of rhubarb associated. One part
has its leaf south-east by south, with its trunk
going north-west through Creswick itself, while
three other parts lie, respectively, one to the
south-east, one to the east, and one to the
north-east. For the most part, only its head-
land has received attention, great stretches still
being virgin country. Companies known as
the West Berry Consols, the Madame Berry
West, the Berry Consols Extended, and the
Spring Hill and Central Leads, are engaged in
the centre of the shed, while further north the
drill has intimated that the north-eastern gutter
may join the others of the valley. From its
own ground, and from a portion tributed from
the Berry Consols Extended, the Spring Hill
and Central Leads won during the last quarter
of 1907 improving yields totalling 150802.
This company’s prospects have been further
improved by an extensive development scheme,
for which the adjoining Berry United has just
raised the sum of by an issue of de-
benture stock. On the other side, the Berry
Consols Extended has succeeded in draining its
ground and getting bores up into payable wash.
At the West Berry Consols a greal deal of
prospecting work has recently been carried out,
and rises from the top level at 350 ft. have al-
ready gone into wash of a remunerative cha-
racter.
On the Berringa field the active units are the
Williams’ Fancy and the Birthday Tunnel, the
former treating 24,503 tons during the year for
a return of and paying during the last
quarter of the year £6OO in dividends, and
the latter’s record for the last three months of
the year being 8921 tons for 165402. and
in dividends.
The fame of the Egerton district was made
by the Black Horse and Egerton mines, which,
after long working separately, amalgamated.
From these two mines alone about one and a-
quarter million pounds’ worth of gold was won,
and about half-a-million sterling paid away in
dividends.
At Scarsdale, the reputation of the Jubilee
as a consistent gold-producer was well main-
tained during 1907. During the year a total of
32,685 tons of quartz was reduced for a yield
of 11,81407. izdwt. of gold; also 431 tons) of
concentrates, worth sfoz. per ton. The fact
that the cost of hauling, milling, etc., is prac-
tically the same as the preceding term, and
that dividends amounting to have
been paid, speaks well for the economical
management of the mine. Several large blocks
remain to be taken out in the eastern section
in the upper levels, and a large amount of ore
is being developed in the bottom levels.
During 1907 dredging was started at Beau-
fort with three plants—the New Yam Holes,
the Fiery Creek, and Tipperary. The New
Yam Holes from 9th July to 28th November

obtained 2660 z. The Tipperary Company,
main lead, only obtained from 31st August to
30th October a total return of 7202. The re-
turns from the Fiery Creek are encouraging,
their last yield of 71OZ. being regarded as pay-
able. Six paddocks have been sluiced for
4220 Z. pdwt. The ground treated was of a very
low grade, but the plant now being fairly in
the old lead, much better yields are expected
during this year.
There has been a revival at Piggoreet.
Those who took up shares in the Port Arthur
at the float have been recouped three-fold,
mainly on the gold from the roott. level. Dur-
ing 1907 eight dividends, totalling 45., were
paid. The shoot in the 200 ft. level has not
been proved for any length. The shaft is
being sunk another lift and a pumping plant
installed, and there appears to be a fair ex-
tent of payable ore to enable the directors to
carry on vigorous prospecting work in the next
level.
At Pitfield Plains, the Glenfine South has
done much work in prospecting the alluvial.
The gutter was originally worked with some
success, although only a couple of dividends
were paid, the majority of the profits going to
clear the company of all liabilities; but its
prosperous career was impeded by the wash
getting out of hand. It has been recovered,
and appears to be of good quality generally.
The work of opening it up is being vigorously
prosecuted, and the company have decided to
also resume work in the quartz. The Pitfield
Plateau, mining on a small scale, divided
amongst the few shareholders during the year;
and the Ninety-six party, operating on portion
of the lease, had a profitable innings.
BEECHWORTH.
Gold Production from Reefs.
In glancing briefly at the quartz mining
activities in the Beechworth district it may
be remarked that, great and diffused as they
are, their total production from year to year
does not latterly amount to one-third of what
is obtained from deep lead mining (as repre-
sented at Chiltern and Rutherglen), alluvial
mining, sluicing and dredging, within the
same area, to which due space is given else-
where in this publication. Last year 22,35802.
ißdwt. of gold was got there from quartz reefs,
whereas in 1906 the yield was 31,29702. n
dwt. from the same source; so there is great
variation. But the rise and fall of the gold
yield in mining within certain limits by no
means necessarily indicates either an increase
or decline in enterprise, although such circum-
stances are sometimes incidental thereto. In
the tract under consideration during last year
changes in the weight of gold met with in
particular reefs would account for a large pro-
portion of the shortage. Still a very peculiar
state of feeling amongst mining men prevails
there, which tends to throwing claims out of
action, and causes the yields to decline. This
is an aversion to following the known rich
reefs of the early days below water level, and
a disposition to limit new prospecting to above
that point. Miners persist in tunnelling into
hill sides rather than sinking shafts. When
the tunnelling and cross-cutting and rising
does not answer, work is often stopped. Ex-
perience has shown that in working down-
wards, directly the water is reached the free
milling stone becomes charged with sulphides,
and, besides the cost of pumping, extraction
expenses are greater. It is these contingencies
that are so generally avoided. Nevertheless,
reef mining has reached the requisite second-
ary stage in many parts of the district, where
the necessity of putting in pumping plants is
being faced. Works have also been estab-
lished for the separation of refractory metals,
notably at Bethanga. That process really in-
volves the greater outlay, as water does not
present itself in extra great volume. Work
on up-to-date principles is now being done
near Bright, at Morse’s Creek, Freeburgh
and Harrietville, but it is essential if any-
thing approaching the old abandoned yields
from quartz is to be obtained in individual
mines that capital must be applied to further
3 1

developing the scores of idle properties in
other directions, which were formerly highly
productive, but were abandoned years ago at
the water level.
The town of Beech worth is 17 if miles north-
east of Melbourne. It has a population of
nearly 3000, and is well situated in hilly
country. With most of the territory to which
its name is given for mining purposes its in-
habitants have no business connection, but such
townships as Rutherglen, Chiltern, Yackan-
dandah, Bethanga, Harrietville, Wandiligong,
Alexandra, Gaffney’s Creek, Bright, Wood’s
Point, Corryong, and Jamieson’s, north, south,
east and west, are embraced in the area so
denominated.
In thirty years, from 1868 to 1898, no less
than 2,990,4870 z. of gold was raised in this
section of Victoria. Before 1868 the annual
output was higher than the 30 years’ average,
and in 1906 the Beechworth district yield ex-
ceeded that average by 35,13 i0z. i3dwt. So
there is no real falling off in the gold produc-
tion of that valuable part, even if it is not all
got from quartz. A summary of what is be-
ing done by reefing in the various divisions of
the district is as follows —
In the Indigo division the returns disclose a
faljing off in gold got from quartz last year
as compared with 1906, but it is much more
than accounted for by the variation in the
yield from one mine, namely, the Chiltern
Golden Bar, which was only crushing in half
of 1907. Its total for that period was 31202.
i2dwt., contrasted with 19260 Z. i4dwt. in
the previous twelve months. The company is
now engaged in further opening up work.
Apart from this particular claim, there has
been a great deal of progress recently. Whilst
the Chiltern Golden Bar Extended mine in
1906 only produced 86oz. 6dwt., last year, be-
ing more forward in development, its yield
was 8220 Z. Bdwt. There was an increased
output from the Robbie Burns claim also. The
Magenta United Co. is doing good prospecting
work between two reefs. Stone from the
Golden Bar reef at Chiltern was got, years
back, which gave as high as 500 Z. to the ton,
and 20,000 tons averaged about ioz. to the
ton. The Chiltern Quartz Co.’s reef has been
another phenomenally rich formation. At
Rutherglen very little reefing is now bemg
done. That there are neglected possibilities
here is indicated by the records, which show
that gold was got from the old-time Camp-
bell’s Reef up to ioooz. per ton for a small
crushing; that the Great Eastern Reef pro-
duced for its first owners 90000 Z. from 3000
tons, and the Great Northern, in nine years,
yielded 30,268j0z., and paid in dividends
Some small parties in the Indigo
division are doing fairly well.
The chief company working reefs in Bright
division is the Pioneer, which distributes a
considerable amount in wages, and has a 12-
head battery and pumping plant, worked by
electricity. Nothing was done in 1906 at the
Pioneer, but last year 13110 Z. Bdwt. was got
from 3688 tons. Grenness and Crofts, a pri-
vate party, have averaged well for two years.
Small quantities of considerable richness have
been treated by the Ringer Co. In 1906, from
34 tons, 750 Z. was obtained, and last year,
from 56 tons, 1510 Z. i7dwt. was got, an im-
provement from slightly over 20Z. to nearly
30Z. per ton. Another excellent yield from a
small quantity is reported by the Lady Spen-
cer party, at Porepunkah, 10 tons yielding 46
oz., or over 4JOZ. per ton. From the Old
Lucky Jack 6ooz. Bdwt. was got from 38 tons,
as compared with 570 Z. ndwt. from 15 ton&
in 1906.
The town from which the Wandiligong
division takes its name is about three miles
south of Bright. A fair amount of reefing
has been done there for some time. In the old
Gladstone mine, about seven years ago, as
much as 2JOZ. was got to the load. The total
crushings from a 60-foot shoot averaged over
ioz. per ton. About the best known enterprise
there now is the Peabody and Berkshire Gold
Mines Ltd. Up to the end of February, 1899,
they had crushed 710 tons for 102 i0z., a very
satisfactory average, and although the produc-
tion from the claim in point of quantity has of
late been very uneven, there were two quar-
terly yields last year that went over 30Z. to
the ton, these being 900 Z. sdwt., from 28 tons,
and 750 Z. Bdwt., from 21 tons. Another quar-
terly return was 580 Z. sdwt., from 32 tons.
The Liffey Co., a small paying concern,
mostly owned in Footscray, had a yield in
the December quarter of 900 Z, sdwt., from
42 tons. The old Oriental Reef yielded be-
tween 1859 and 1867 over worth of
gold.
The crushings from Buckland were richer
last year than formerly; from the two claims
operating in this division the gold return
was more than double that of 1906, from a
considerably less quantity of stone treated.
3 2
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


A continuation of the Old Victory Reef is
being worked in the Harrietville division by
Dr. Hepworth and party. Stone was got by
the original workers, yielding 40Z. 2dwt. per
ton for 56 tons, and varying down to Joz.
per ton minimum. Harrietville was the scene
some years ago of the operations of an Eng-
lish company called the New Options Limited,
which worked six proved rich reefs. Their
outlay was too widely disseminated over 17
miles of underground workings. Had work
been concentrated on the richest mine taken
over, handsome profits would no doubt have
been realised, but after paying one dividend,
totalling the company, having sus-
tained a loss of nearly went into
liquidation. Their best property, the Mons
Meg mine, however, was payable right
through. Last year, after not being worked
for some time, 1230 Z. was got out of the
Mons Meg from 240 tons, and the Harrietville
Co., who bought the Johnson’s claim, another
of the New Options mines, produced i6ioz.
4dwt. from 397 tons, compared with 320 Z. 6
dwt. from 41 tons treated in 1906. The Rose,
Thistle and Shamrock mine is, just now, the
most active in the division. From 1045 tons
4070 z. 6dwt. was obtained in 1906, and last
year 13800 Z. i7dwt. was got from 3786 tons.
Mr. E. J. Dunn, Director of the Victorian
Geological Survey, was in. Shamrock Gully,
where this mine is, in 1862, when the first
outcrop of the reef was discovered, and he
was shown by the prospector a moss-covered
piece of quartz speckled all over with gold
This reef was, with the assistance of Mr.
Kenny, of the Geological Survey Department,
rediscovered about two years ago, and after
the company had uselessly expended a con-
siderable sum on prospecting work, struck the
reef, which was 7ft. 6in. wide, and assayed 12
dwt. per ton. Since then a 10-head battery
has been erected, and 60 to 70 men are some-
times employed at a time. The crushings
average about pdwt.; there is abundance of
stone in sight, and every prospect of perma-
nence. Amongst the private parties working
in the Harrietville division, Howell and Co.
got the richest yield, of 310 Z. i3dwt., last
year from 10 tons.
In Beechworth, the central division of the
district, the most notable company working
quartz reefs is the Homeward Bound Limited,
which has been operating for years with vary-
ing success. The stone now being raised
averages about 3-4dwt. to the ton. Crushing
last year was, however, only done for nine
months, and the yield, 3750 Z. i9dwt., was
quite insignificant compared with the 1906
total, which was 13150 Z. 4dwt. Near the
Homeward Bound mine some rich discoveries
have lately been made between Hurdle Flat
and Lucky Point. Downs and Co., at
Hurdle Flat, from 10 tons, have crushed 27
oz. sdwt., and, from 20 tons, have got 40
oz. Bdwt. ; whilst Hodgens and Co. secured a
fluky single crushing, producing 1480 Z. from
14 tons, an average of rojoz. Small parties at
Buffalo Creek, Murmungee, and Merriang are
doing well. At Myrtleford, where formerly
the Reform and Nil Desperandum were good
payable properties, only the latter is now
working of the two, and last year got 780 Z.
i2dwt. from 160 tons of stone. The Mines
Department geologists believe that if capital
were found to put down a new shaft in the
Pioneer mine it could be payably carried on.
Not only partnerships but families carry on
small mines in this division, often lucratively.
At Stanley, the Perfect Cure Co. has opened
up a large reef of low grade ore, which it is
believed can be worked with profit. There is
comparative stagnation in reefing just now at
Happy Valley, Woorage, and
all of which were formerly good gold produc-
ing localities. More enterprise of the right
kind would be well rewarded.
The Go Ahead mine, in the Yackandandah
division, although only raising stone for six
months last year, had two good crushings,
namely, 1790 Z. rodwt. from 84 tons, and 298
oz. isdwt. from 124 tons. Whilst the former
is well over 20z., the last is nearly per
ton. In the whole division only i6oz. rodwt.
of gold from quartz was obtained in 1906. At
Twisted Creek lately 30Z. to the ton has been
obtained from a crushing by a small reefing
party, and this has led to a small revival in
quartz mining there. At Sandy Creek, a Mel-
bourne syndicate, which has bought the Grass-
hopper mine, has started on right lines to fol-
low the reef below water level. Proper pump-
ing appliances will be installed.
Thin reefs are found in the Alexandra divi-
sion, which occasionally are very rich. Years
ago, for instance, at Yea, the Welcome Com-
pany produed worth of gold. From
the Luckie Reef 978 tons yielded 48430 Z.,
whilst from the No. 2 Albert Vulcan, a claim
on the same line. 20,i400z. of gold was ob-

tained, and ,£47,000 distributed in dividends.
Another old time successful mine was the
Homeward Bound. Most of the work now be-
ing done near Alexandra is by small parties,
but the Alexandra Reefs Consolidated Co.
and Robb’s Reward Co. operate considerable
undertakings. The former, in 1906, got 709
oz. from 515 tons, but last year only obtained
3302. zdwt. from 167 tons, doing much dead
work. From Robb’s Reward, whereas, in
1906, only 2ioz. i4dwt. was got from 50 tons,
the output last year was 1450 Z. isdwt. from
420 tons. Rich yields from small parcels
have lately been got by Bromley and Co.,
Junction Hill, 230 Z. ndwt. from 7 tons, and
J. Caddy, of Merton, Boz. 7dwt. from 2 tons.
Since years ago, when the Luck’s All mine,
in the Big River division, paid jQ 60,000 in
dividends, no large enterprise in quartz reef-
ing has been successfully carried on there.
Small parties last year got 2200 Z. i2dwt. from
94 tons, an improvement on what was done in
1906, when 15802. sdwt. was got from 225
tons. There is much scope for prospecting
on likely formations, especially towards
Enoch’s Point.
Fair activity prevails in the Gaffney’s Creek
division, where several well-established mines
have been improving their output. The Vic-
toria A 1 Gold Mines Limited last year pro-
duced 275202. 3dwt. from 4238 tons, being
more than treble its production in 1906. The
New Dempsey’s yielded 164302. Bdwt. from
2157 tons, more than double its total in the
previous year, and Mackay’s Quartz Co. got
7520 Z, Bdwt. from 1765 tons, nearly double
its 1906 production. The total gold got from
reefs in the Gaffney’s Creek division last year
was the creditable total of 53270 Z. i3dwt., the
richest divisional yield from quartz in the
whole Beechworth mining district, as compared
with 20540 Z. 2dwt. raised in 1906. The reefs
there are mainly floors of quartz, traversing
diorite dykes. The history of the district
teems with records of rich yields in the past.
The Wood’s Point division was a wonderful
producer during the sixties. The Morning
Star claim, which was the first reef discovered,
paid its five first owners over each
in four years. It yielded altogether 74,00002.,
and paid in dividends. The best
yield from the reef was worth of
gold, got in ten days. Scott and Grerry’s
claim, on the same reef, yielded over 40,000
oz., and paid £70,000 in dividends. The
Wood’s Point Quartz Co. also, in two years,
produced 24,50002., and paid in
dividends. From the Royal Standard Co.
was paid in dividends in nine
months. Owing to reckless distribution of
profits, practically no money was put by for
prospecting purposes, and when the rich yields
ceased the claims were one by one given up,
when working became difficult. For the last
two years the total reefing yields from the
division have been over 2000 ounces, but there
is only one really important mine working,
namely, the All Nations, which in 1907 pro-
duced 179202. 3dwt. from 2728 tons, and in
1906 rendered up 104202, i2dwt. from 1180
tons. Here is another part for enterprise.
Gold is also being got by smaller companies,
such as the Sir John Franklin and Star of
Hope Co., and Clements and Co. The last
year’s operations of the two former were less
productive than in 1906, going into very small
figures. Still the possibilities for the pro-
sperous development of the reefing industry
in Wood’s Point division are vast.
A considerable number of companies are
persistently exploiting the reefs in the Jamie-
son division, which in 1906 contributed 10,523
oz. 7dwt. to the Beechworth district yield, or
one-third of all the gold raised in that area
from quartz. Of that total the Star of the
West produced 35020 Z. sdwt. from 5302 tons
of stone, the Horse Shoe Co. provided 21190 Z.
i7dwt. from 2060 tons, and the Star of the
West Extended, 12990 Z. Bdwt. from
tons. Last year the Horse Shoe Co. was only

the other being no less than 130 Z. per ton.
Two ounces to the ton were got by two or three
other parties.
But little is going on in the Corryong divi-
sion, excepting what is being done by small
parties. The total yield last year of ifiioz.
from 177 tons was contributed to by ten such
combinations. About roooz. more was got in
1906, but since then the Mount Elliott mine,
which formerly produced 30Z. to the ton. has
been let on tribute. The district is rLh in
gold, but at present is not being energetically
developed.
MARYBOROUGH.
Value of Gold
Maryborough, the capital of the county of
Talbot, gives its name to one of the largest
of the Victorian mining districts. It lies on
the north side of the great dividing range, 112
miles north-west of Melbourne, with which it
is connected by two lines of railway. It has
a population of over 16,000, and its public
and private buildings are of a substantial and
pleasing character. Agriculture, besides min-
ing, abounds in the district. The mining
divisions are Amherst, Avoca, Carisbrook,
Dunolly, Inglewood, Majorca, Maryborough,
St. Arnaud, Tarnagulla, and Wedderburn.
Not only gold, but silver, lead, and zinc,
and many other minerals have been found
within the confines of this district, which is,
however, chiefly remarkable from a mining
point of view as furnishing an example of a
great alluvial field, in which the lines of the
deep leads mark the ancient lines of drainage,
the gravel deposits in these deep leads corres-
ponding to the gravels of the present river
courses. As the rivers took their course through
the valleys, they acted like gigantic sluices,
and the softer material was ground to powder,
and has gone to make the great tertiary plains
which are a feature of the northern areas of
the State, while the harder material (quartz,
for instance), has remained as well-rounded
pebbles, and it is in association with these
pebbles that the well-worn particles of gold
are found.
Just as a river branches off into creeks, and
these again into gullies, so the leads of Mary-
borough are found to branch and split up into
tributaries. The immense potentialities of
deep alluvial mining in this district have
£6,000,000.
already induced English capitalists to engage
in work on a magnitude hitherto unknown in
Victoria, and form the subject of a special
article in the present pamphlet.
One great system, originating at Spring
Hill, near Creswick, world-famed as the
“Berry Lead,” which yielded a million ster-
ling to the mile for six miles of its head-
waters, has, by means of boring, been traced
for a length of 30 miles. On the extension of
this trunk lead are situated the Loddon Valley
goldfields. To the east of the Berry, or Cres-
wick lead, is the Loddon Valley lead, and to
the west the Majorca and Carisbrook leads,
where such gold winners as the Kong Meng,
Chalks and Napier Freeholds, Chalks No. 1,
and the Chalks Junction found a place, and
where the Chalks No. 3 Consolidated, and
the Charlotte Plains Consolidated are still
working, and the New Junction Deep Leads
were working until recently. To the end of
December, 1907, the Chalks No. 3 had pro-
duced 44,4060 z. of gold.
A low range of silurian hills divides the
Maryborough and Carisbrook leads, and
through this range a well defined line of lode
strikes, and contains the Mosquito, Blucher’s,
Flagstaff, and Shaw’s reefs, which have
yielded handsome returns, and have un-
doubtedly been the source of much of the
alluvial richness of the district. To the west
of the town of Maryborough is the great
“master” lode of the field, which outcrops
boldly in Mariner’s Reef and Bristol Hill,
and was worked with great success at Levia-
than Reef. From this lode springs the famous
Chinaman’s Flat lead, gold having been traced

from the grass roots to where it was formerly
mined by the North Duke Company, and in
conjunction with the Maryborough Main Lead,
is now being worked by the Duke and Main
Leads Consols Co., at Bet Bet. This company
has produced gold to the value of ,£15,185,
and after six years of development work and
lead-draining, is just entering the profit-earn-
ing stage. Enriched by a tributary known as
the Alma, the Chinaman’s Flat lead has been
clearly defined by boring, not only to its con-
fluence with the Marvborough Main Lead.
mining in Maryborough is about six millions
sterling.
In the early history of the Mariner’s Reef
and Bristol Hill quartz mines, excellent re-
turns were obtained. Recently payable stone
has been met with in the Mariner’s Reef at a
depth of 500 ft., and further development is
being undertaken.
Inglewood, Avoca, Talbot, Amherst, St.
Arnaud, Tarnagulla, and Dunolly are all sub-
divisions of the Maryborough mining district.
Few among the Victorian goldfields have a

Long as is already this list of leads, the

which were very prodigal of gold, have not
been mentioned. However, if all the leads
and all the mines, past and present, of Mary-
borough, were dealt with, the limits of this

was when the Unity, Maxwells, Jersey, Colum-
bian, and a score of other mines were “house-

the rich surface shoots were worked, and when
the time came for the deeper mining to be
undertaken, there was no money left; the
companies broke down because they were finan-
cially weak, and because they had not the
departmental data, now available, which would

have enabled the mines to be worked in a pro-
per manner. Attempts at resuscitation were
not successful, except in the case of the Max-
wells Co. (which picked up the run of gold,
and is said to have paid away ,£50,000 in
dividends, without a break), and the Great
Columbian, which is still working, having to
date turned out 11,95702., and paid
in dividends.
Gold was first discovered in the Avoca dis-
trict in September, 1853, and in a short space
of time the find proved to be a very rich one.
In November of the same year the first escort
—a small one —was despatched. Early in
1854 the yields gradually increased, until 9000
oz. was sent by one fortnightly escort, and the
official returns for the first 12 years showed
that 624,11502., valued at were
sent by Government escort from Avoca. The
amount, large as it may appear, represented
not more than one-third of the gold won, large
quantities being sold privately in Melbourne,
Geelong, Creswick, Daisy Hill, and other
places. No less than worth was
sent from two of the places during the first
eight years—all of which came from Avoca —
thus making a total of by escort
alone, for the 12 years.
The fields of St. Arnaud have had a very
chequered career. Following rapidly on the
Ballarat, Avoca, and Maryborough rushes, the
rich alluvial deposits were soon unearthed.
Then came the period of rest, broken by land
selection and settlement, and the consequent
locking up of much auriferous country. The
usual reefing companies with small capital and
primitive machinery followed, getting the
richest stone near the surface, and leaving
it at water-level, and often abandoning quartz
which would now be considered profitable to
work. In the eighties there was a silver boom,
during which the town itself was marked out
for leases, and there was an extravagant waste
of shareholders’ money in expensive buildings
and machinery. The collapse of the silver
boom has been largely compensated by the suc-
cess of the Lord Nelson Gold Mining Co.
From the time this mine was opened out below
the broken country, known in all these lines of
reef, it paid .£254,550 in dividends, that were
regular until a couple of years ago, when an
expenditure of ,£15,000 was incurred for
plant, which has now all been liquidated out
of the profits derived from stone averaging
about rodwt. to the ton. The lode lives down,
and at r 800 ft. gives every promise of per-
manence, and the early resumption of divi-
dends. The gold won by this company to
the end of February, 1907, was 254,i700z.,
out of which, roughly, £1 per ounce was paid
in dividends.
Dunolly is a division that has been well ex-
ploited with success, and has had a lot of
money spent in developing its auriferous de-
posits. Such well-known mines as the Queen’s
Birthday, New Birthday, Burnt Creek,
Dunolly Alluvial, and others have shown the
possibilities of this field. The Burnt Creek
Co. is just preparing to enter wash. The total
gold produced by this company since 1891 is
40,98202., and the dividends paid,
Maryborough’s prospects of a mining revival
depend in the first place on new discoveries
and developments, and in the next, on the
result of the work now being done by the
Duke and Main Leads Consols, Burnt Creek,
Lord Nelson, and Mariner’s Reef mines, no
less than on the success of the large English-
owned undertakings at Moolort and Charlotte
Plains.

CASTLEMAINE.
Value of Gold Won
The Castlemaine goldfield is historically one
of the most interesting, for it was the first
which achieved sensational success, and for a
time surpassed even Ballarat and Bendigo.
Castlemaine itself is about 78 miles north-
west of Melbourne, with which it is connected
by rail. The goldfield of the same name is
situated in the north-eastern portion of an ex-
tensive, more or less auriferous 2one of country,
which extends from Mount Alexander in a
southerly direction past Daylesford.
The district is divided into six divisons,
the chief of which are known as Castlemaine,
Fryers Creek, Daylesford, Taradale, Maldon,
and St. Andrew’s. The active quart 2 mining
centres are Maldon and Daylesford, and the
active dredging centres, Castlemaine and
Fryers Creek. To the immense yields derived
from these sources the principal contributors
have been the Beehive and German, Eagle-
hawk Consolidated, Derby United, South Ger-
man, North British, Grand Junction, Nuggetty
Reef, Cornish and Ajax mines.
Gold was first discovered in the district in
July, 1851, at Golden Point, Forest Creek, but
for some time the discovery was kept a secret.
By the beginning of September four men were
mining for gold, which was found in plenty,
and won with ease. The field at that time was
£6,000,000
known as the Mt. Alexander, or Forest Creek,
goldfield. Early in November a rush set in,
miners deserting rich claims at Ballarat, and
by the end of the month 10,000 persons were
at work on the field. The gold escort leaving
Mount Alexander on the 27th November,
1851, took 10,42802. of gold to Melbourne, and
left about 600002. of gold on the field. A re-
port to the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce
in April, 1853, gives the following amounts of
gold taken to Melbourne by escort for the
weeks ending as follows:
October 29th, 1851 22802.
November sth, 1851 ... 96502.
November 12 th, 1851 ...
November 18th, 1851 ... 6,44302.
November 26th, 1851 ... 10,58802.
December 3rd, 1851 ... 13,76302.
December 10th, 1851 ... 23,65002.
December 17th, 1851 ... 18,19202.
December 24th, 1851 ... 10,07702.
December 31st, 1851 ... 10,59802.
94,52402.
Apparently over 60,00002. were obtained
ii. 7 •
during December. For the ten years following
the discovery of gold, the escort to Melbourne
took, on an average, 700002. of gold each week
from this field, or a total of over 3,500,000
39
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


oz., the average value being about 15s. per
ounce. For a number of years no systematic
quartz mining was carried on, but as the allu-
vial deposits were gradually becoming ex-
hausted more attention was directed to the
matrix from which they had been denuded.
The quartz outcrops in places proved to> be
very rich in gold, and large bodies of payable
stone were opened up and treated. Some in-
stances of wonderful yields are:—“From mines
in Wattle Gully, Chewton, large parcels of
stone yielded as high as 12 ounces to the ton.
One parcel of two tons gave 402 ounces; a sec-
ond parcel of two tons gave 533 ounces, and
from half a bucket of specimens 286 ounces
were obtained. Below water level quartz yield-
ing 45 ounces per ton was obtained, the gold
being generally coarse, roz. and 502. pieces be-
ing found.” These yields were taken from nar-
row veins of quartz found intersecting the coun-
try rock at all angles. A great number of reefs
were opened up, and, although the claims
originally were only 12 feet square, shafts were
frequently sunk to depths of 70 and 80 feet. As
the sinking became deeper the length of ground
allowed by law was extended to 60 feet, and
throughout the field, along abandoned lines of
reefs, a large number of shafts sunk at intervals
of 60 feet are still noticeable. When water
level was met with, adjoining claimholders fre-
quently co-operated to erect suitable machinery.
Engine shafts were sunk, and mining advanced
another stage. As these smaller companies
reached the limit of their capacity, larger com-
panies obtaining leases, further prospected the
areas, and the total production to date is over
six million pounds’ worth of gold.
Topographically, the north-eastern portion
consists of a series of low hills, constituting a
range which extends from a granite area north-
east of the town in a southerly direction, nearly
to the township of Chewton, two' miles east of
Castlemaine. This range forms the water-shed
between Forest Creek and its largest tributary,
Moonlight Flat, and is, as it were, the back-
bone of the auriferous belt. In an easterly
direction from the range fall a number of small
gullies, which, although short, were wonder-
fully rich in alluvial gold. Westward from the
range the gullies are larger and longer, and, all
eventually uniting, form Moonlight Flat.
These gullies have all been worked for alluvial
gold. Scattered over the surface of the greater
portion of the field occur fragments of quartz,
mostly derived from denuded portions of reefs
and spurs which intersect strata in various
directions. Before the arrival of the miners
large masses of quartz were exposed, standing
some feet above the general surface.
The chief feature in the geological structure
of the field is the marked similarity that it
bears to the Bendigo goldfield (twenty miles
northwards), as regards the corrugation of the
strata, and the occurrence of saddle reefs asso-
ciated with the anticlinal folds, i.e., folds in
the country like an inverted “V.” Quartz occur-
rences are of varying form and character, and
may conveniently be divided into:—
(a) Fissure reefs—along well-marked planes
of fissure not conforming in strike or underlay
with the enclosing strata, generally with well-
defined walls.
(b) Saddle reefs—with the same general
characteristics as the saddle reefs of the Ben-
digo goldfield.
(c) Fault reefs—large masses of quartz
accompanying faults, and extending irregularly
for varying distances from the fault plane into
the adjoining country rock.
(d) Spurs—masses and veins of quartz depo-
sited in irregular fissures and crevices in the
strata.
Although in most instances gold is found in
the quartz masses, it has been found in places
on the field, in clean slates entirely devoid of
any particles of quartz; also in sandstone in
which quartz veins are not always noticeable.
In the quartz it is found in the form of nuggets
(pieces 3 and 40Z. being commonly met with in
the shallow vein workings), in shotty grains of
various sizes and shapes, and in flakes. In
laminated quartz the gold is frequently seen in
the form of fine specks scattered throughout
the darker or mineralised portions. In sand-
stone it is frequently noticed in a more or less
regularly crystallised form, and in the slates it
is oftentimes so fine or “flowery” as to be in-
visible till wetted. The shotty nature of the
gold appears to be characteristic of the field,
this form being frequently noticed even when it
is present in unpayable quantities. The gold
does not appear to be found in any defined
shoots, being generally found in irregular
patches; and in the quartz spurs it is by no
means uncommon to find highly auriferous and
barren patches within a few feet of driving. As
regards age of disposition, the gold, with its
quartz matrix, appears to extend over a very
lengthy geological period. Thus there is gold
deposited in the “saddle” formations, which
probably represent the oldest quartz occur-
rences on the field; in spurs, formed on “faults”
40
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


which intersect the saddle reefs, and which are,
therefore, of later origin; in spurs intersecting
these faults, and of later date again; and also
in the decomposed “lava” dykes, which appear
to be still younger. Although a great number
of shafts have at various times been sunk on
the numerous lines of reef throughout the field,
in very few cases has much work been carried
out below water level. This affords all the
more cause for reflection when it is considered
that at Bendigo payable results have been ob-
tained from depths exceeding 3000 feet in
country presenting no apparent notable dis-
similarity.
The Daylesford (formerly Jim Crow) division
was first brought into prominent notice during
the year 1853, by the rich and extensive allu-
vial deposits which were discovered underlying
the basaltic hills in the neighbourhood of the
present township, and Spring Creek, and the
unearthing of the auriferous treasures so freely
distributed in the flats and gullies, and which
at an early period were thought inexhaustible.
The Jim Crow Creek is the main stream which
intersects the Daylesford goldfield, but in the
neighbourhood of Corinella Paddock, Keep it
Dark, Old Tom, Spring Creek, Wombat Flat,
Sailor’s Gully, and Deep Creek, the alluvial
workings were of a very extensive character.
From Wombat Hill and Flat alone some tens
of thousands of ounces of gold have been
taken. With regard to quartz mining, a vast
amount of work has been done, extending over
the whole of the Daylesford division. The first
reef opened up and worked was the Mauritius,
“Kidd’s Gully,” in the year 1854. In the same
year the Cornish Reef was opened up. This
reef is still being worked by the Victorian Cor-
nish, an English-owned company. Work on a
large number of auriferous quartz reefs, from
which encouraging prospects had been obtained
in the first instance, but which had long been
idle, was resumed about a couple of years ago.
The chief of these was the Ajax, which has
since produced i6,ioooz. of gold, and paid
* n dividends. The reefs about Spring
Creek, Hepbum and Dry Diggings proved
highly auriferous in the early days, but until
recently were only partially prospected. Already
90 distinct quartz reefs have been proved to be
auriferous throughout the Daylesford division,
the total production of which, since 1868, has
been and that of Maldon for the
same period 92i,i620z.
Only small portions of the Castlemaine-
Chewton field are covered with higher level hill
gravels, the lower level hill gravels being much
more extensively developed than those of the
older gold drift. The drift is well developed,
and consists of two welbdefined channels or
runs. One branch, running parallel to Barker's
Creek, passes through the central portion of
Castlemaine, at an altitude of 30 feet above
the present stream. The other branch starts to
the east of Chewton, and has a westerly course
till it joins the Barker’s Creek channel, the
continued down-stream course being thence
apparently parallel to Campbell's Creek. The
drift varies from a few feet to 50 feet in thick-
ness, and has been extensively worked for gold.
Alluvial and recent gravels are to be found in
all the gullies and flats throughout the field,
consisting chiefly of gravels, sands, silts, and
soil, distributed in irregular layers. From these
recent deposits in former times, tons’ weight of
gold were obtained from depths varying from a
few inches (in “surfacing”) to 40 feet and more
(on the flats). The greater portion of the gold
was obtained from the lowermost layers, rest-
ing on a soft pipeclay bottom, into the crevices
of which the gold was frequently found to pene-
trate to a depth of several feet. From the
richer deposits in the deeper ground as much
as twenty to thirty ounces to the square foot
were obtained from, the bottom. The alluvial
deposits of Forest Creek were followed up the
branch gullies, the richest deposits being found
in the watercourses, and at narrow bends or
junctions of the creeks.
The methods of working the shallow alluvial
deposits were in the early days very primitive—
shaft sinking at random, and gouging out as
small a quantity of the lowermost layer, or
“bottom,” as possible, the material obtained be-
ing washed in a dish. By these means the
richer portions of the field were worked. The
succeeding method was to work the ground
from top to bottom, in a face, treating by pud-
dling the bottom layers and material from ihe
crevices in the bed-rock only. As numbers of
diggers left the field, the quantity of ground
obtainable for claims became larger, and sluic-
ing operations were carried on during the rainy
seasons of the year. The supply of water from
the Government races for sluicing purposes
marked a new area in alluvial workings in the
district. All the old ground, which had been
worked over and over again, was taken up, and
sluicing with large bodies of water under vari-
ous heads was, and is still being, carried on in
the gullies and flats. With these means all the
ground from top to bottom is passed through
41
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


the sluices, the bottom laid bare over large
areas and scraped, practically all the gold be-
ing thus obtained. In places where the
surface fall was insufficient to carry away
the tailings, elevators of various descrip-
tions were employed. Recently bucket dredg-
ing and hydraulic sluicing, by means of
water under pressure from centrifugal pumps,
has been resorted to to obtain profit-
able results from the already worked alluvial
deposits. These centrifugal pumps and neces-
sary machinery are fitted on barges to enable
them to be more readily moved by flotation
from one position to another, the debris being
deposited on the portions already worked out.
In this district there are 32 plants at work, and
the dividends paid from 1905 to 1907 inclusive
from this source alone were ,£23,037, while
the gold won was 72,75802.
ARARAT AND STAWELL.
The Past History.
Ararat itself is situated on the western edge
of the Dividing Range, fifty-six miles north
of Ballarat, and 131 miles from Melbourne,
with which it is connected by a direct line.
In the mining district, which bears the same
name, much more than the railway terminus
and its environs are comprehended, as it ex-
tends from Stawell on the north to Beaufort
and Raglan on the south, and from Crow-
lands and Landsborough on the east to Moy-
ston on the west, the total area being 800
square miles, of which 60 have been proved
to be auriferous. Of this area Ararat proper
was in the golden fifties the chief mining
centre, and it can claim that from it has
radiated the enterprise and energy which has
developed the surrounding district. Ararat,
opened in 1854, was one of the fields dis-
covered almost immediately after the great
rush to Ballarat, when the opening of Ben-
digo, Mclvor, Beechworth, Pleasant Creek,
Avoca. Tarrengower, Creswick, Fiery Creek and
Maryborough followed in such quick succession,
and at such widely separated points. Of all
these, none was so rich in parts as Ararat.
The fame of the yields from the Old Canton
lead still lives in the wonderful story of the
marvellous returns which rewarded early dig-
ging enterprise. It drew 20,000 people to the
field, and the old residents still point to some
of the holes, close to where the Port Fairy
Road crosses the old lead, from which buckets
were sent up containing more gold than dirt.
These were the famous “Jeweller’s shops.”
With the ebbing of the great tide of popu-
lation, consequent upon the check to its min-
ing industry, it took on a quieter, not to say
a somewhat lethargic, habit of life. The allu-
vial having been worked out, beyond one or
two efforts to prove the deep lead running
into the valley of the Hopkins, little has been
attempted in the way of systematic mining;
yet within a few miles south of the town the
broad basin formed by this Hopkins Valley
is believed by scientists and practical men to
contain a large area of rich alluvial. The
main gold-bearing zone of the Ararat field
passes through it, and on the top of this is the
bed of a pre-historic river, above which now
lies, in consecutive order, sedimentaiy layers
of white clay, rubbley wash, white clay,

Gold Mines, an alluvial undertaking associ-
ated with a far-reaching scheme for the de-
velopment of the deep leads of the State in

barked, is the largest producer on this field.
Although the district took its name from
Ararat, in a few years Stawell became the
active mining centre. Long before the dis-
covery of gold in the fifties, the whole of the
country round Stawell had been occupied as
sheep runs. A station-hand on one of these
runs was struck with the similarity of the
country to that of Buninyorig, near Ballarat,
where he had previously lived, and was in-

duced by this likeness to undertake a little
prospecting on his own account, with the re-
sult that he obtained gold from some gravel
taken from the bed of the creek near his hut,
and thus inaugurated the Stawell field. Some
cement hills in the neighbourhood of the
creek were opened up and yielded richly, al-
though rather patchily, pieces of gold from
a “pennyweight to a pound” being found em-
bedded in the cement.
Subsequently gold was found in the quartz
of Big Hill, at whose base the town of Stawell
stands. From this quartz magnificent speci-
mens were obtained early in 1857, but about
the middle of the same year an alluvial rush
took place at Deep Lead, about four miles
distant from Stawell, and this entirely eclipsed
the Big Hill reefs and almost every other gold-
field in the colony. Diggers flocked in from
all directions, other fields were almost de-
serted, stores of all descriptions were opened
and stocked, and a daily coach communicated
with the more settled towns. This rush con-
tinued with but little intermission for several
years, maintaining a population variously esti-
mated at from 5000 to 50,000 people, and
fortunes were made in the eventual develop-
ment of the lead. A rich layer of cement on
the bedrock forms a peculiar feature through-
out this lead. Much of this cement was
crushed, and gave highly satisfactory yields.
Attention was then once more turned
to the Big Hill and its golden quartz,
the development of which determined the per-
manency of the Stawell goldfields, and which
has resulted in the foundation of a town of no
mean importance. The first crushing machine
was erected during 1857, but was used almost
entirely for crushing the richest of the cement
from the Deep Lead, and much of the gold
thus obtained was afterwards the prime factor
in the work of opening out the quartz reefs.
Other crushing plants were soon erected, and
various reefs were discovered and worked
with fairly good results. Amongst the great
names of this field were the Magdala, Oriental,
Newington, Prince Patrick, Crown Cross,
Prince Alfred, North Magdala, Federal, Amal-
gamated Scotchman, New Perthshire, Sloanes
and Scotchman, and the Magdala-cum-Moon-
light.
A crushing of 31 tons of quartz raised from
depth of 1060 feet in the Oriental mine
yielded 50Z. i4dwt. i7gr. of gold per ton.
From the 870-feet level of the Extended Cross
Reef Co. 964 tons were raised, and yielded a
return of roz. 6dwt. sgr. of gold per ton. The
Pleasant Creek Cross Reef Co. obtained an
average yield of roz. isgr. of gold to the ton
of quartz raised from between 578 feet and 900
feet, and 10,972 tons raised from 712 feet
yielded roz. 6dwt. ngr. per ton. From the
flat reef, at a depth of 850 feet, the Crown
Cross Co. got 804 tons of quartz, which gave
roz. jdwt. 2gr. of gold per ton. By the re-
ports of the manager of the Pleasant Creek
Cross Reef Co, it is shown that, from the be-
ginning of 1870 to the end of 1876, the com-
pany had crushed r 59,000 tons of stuff for a
return of 216,54002. of gold.
The magnificent yields from the North Cross
Reef and the Oriental mines were the largest
ever obtained in Stawell, amounting, in the
case of the Cross Reef, to 11 tons of gold, and,
from the Oriental mine, to over 6 tons of the
precious metal.
The Magdala-cum-Moonlight Company
treated 166,963 tons of stone from the
famous Magdala mine for a yield of 86,35902.
of gold, and concentrates of auriferous pyrites
to the value of 7s. 9d. additional.
The one noticeable feature of the two main
alluvial leads running parallel with the direc-
tion of the present valley of the Pleasant
Creek is the cemented drift in horizontal beds,
which crop out in all the channels running
through the flats, and appears to cover the
whole width of the valleys flowing from the
granite range.
Next Jto Stawell, Moyston was the busiest
reefing centre in the Ararat mining district.
It lies 10 miles west of Ararat, and 8 miles
from Mount William, the highest peak of
the Grampians. In 1858 the gold-bearing
stone of the Campbell reef, which first gave
its name to the field, was discovered, and
after the initial difficulties of getting crush-
ing machinery to the place had been sur-
mounted, Moyston was for years a busy hive
of mining industry, the hum of which was fur-
nished by the throb of the engines and the
ceaseless roar of the stampers. The main line
of reef, Campbell’s, was very rich, yielding
over ,£250,000. On this there were five
mines—North Star, Southern Cross, Three
Crowns, Kangaroo, and Sir George Bowen,
and there is not a man who worked in these
mines but stoutly maintains that rich stone
has gone underfoot in nearly all of them.
About 12 months after the first discovery
gold was found 4 miles north of the Yam
Holes, in the neighbourhood of Fiery Creek.
43
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


The field therefore became widely known as
the Fiery Creek diggings, and this designation
covered all minor finds within an extensive
area. Few old-time Victorian mining centres
attained to greater celebrity. Within three
months of the second discovery it had at-
tracted a population estimated at not less
than 60,000. For two miles due south, toward
the Yam Holes (a company bearing the name
of the New Yam Holes is still at work), what
proved to be large tributaries were worked
with splendid results. These tributaries were

the diggers of the day, with their primitive ap-
pliances, from payable gold, and to this day,,
though nearly half a century has intervened,
the lost lead has never been recovered, though
many attempts have been made, and much
money spend in fruitless endeavour. Fiery
Creek was phenomenally rich, and the amount
of gold sent away enormous. On one occasion
a six-horse escort left with one and a-half tons,
of gold on board. This represented the accu-
mulation of the diggers, who were all eager

liberally fed by smaller ones following the
course of the gullies within a radius of 4
miles. At a point two miles south the larger
tributaries joined the Main Lead, which
proved to be phenomenally rich, and which,
retaining its name, conferred it upon the
township which has sprung up in its vicinity.
This lead, from which the gold was taken
not merely in ounces, but in pounds weight,
was traced down to within a mile of where
now stands the picturesquely situated town
of Beaufort, the principal centre in the
county of Ripon, but unfortunately the water
to get it out of the colony before the export
duty of half-a-crown an ounce, put on in lieu
of license, took effect. In 1858 gold was again
found two' miles further south of where the
lead was lost, at Jock’s Gully, and Jenkins’
Gully, which turned out to be also tributaries,
forming, however, a continuous lead trending
towards the Fiery Creek main lead. At one
time five engine claims were working on this
tributary, which was followed till it functioned
with the supposed main lead, when the gold
again totally disappeared, although before this
the claims were paying large dividends. This

fact makes old residents firm in their opinion
that good payable gold exists in the deep
ground in the locality.
In 1859 a rich tributary was discovered near
Beaufort and successfully worked by those
three famous mines the Royal Saxon, the
Homeward Bound, and the Hope. It was
about this time that attention was turned to
the Waterloo diggings, situated about six miles
north-east of Beaufort. For about ten years
the new ground proved to be very payable,
although the numerous alluvial claims were
mostly working on tributary leads, all trending
towards the lost main leads of Fiery Creek,
only lower, down, with which it would junc-
tion at a point further south. The principal
mines were the Waterloo, Hobart Pasha, New
Victoria, South Victoria, Frusher’s Freehold,
Victoria Regina, Saxon Consols Co., and
others.
To-day Beaufort, Ararat, and Stawell are
the productive centres, and all the gold-win-
ning mines, with the exception of the Mag-
dala, are alluvial.
GIPPSLAND
Total Gold
Gippsland, named after Sir George Gipps,
Kt., who was Captain-General and Governor-
in-Chief of New South Wales, Van Diemen’s
Land, and their dependencies during the early
period of Victorian discovery and settlement,
is the easternmost mining district of the
State. It has 13 divisions—Omeo, Mitchell’s
River, Boggy Creek, Crooked River, Dargo,
Donnell’s Creek, Russell Creek, Jericho, Wal-
halla, Bendoc, Orbost, Tarwin, and Haunted
Stream, the most important being Walhalla,
where the celebrated Long Tunnel and Long
Tunnel Extended mines are situated, Jericho,
famous for the New Loch Fyne, Victor’s
Quartz, and Garibaldi mines, Bulumwaal, or
Boggy Creek, and Omeo. Gippsland is a wild
and rugged country, very mountainous, heavily
timbered, and in parts almost inaccessible,
while in other parts its beautiful lake scenery
makes it one of the most picturesque divisions
of the State. For the first mentioned reasons
prospecting was a work of great difficulty and
severe privation, though, thanks to the pro-
gressive policy of the Government, the worst
difficulties have disappeared before the cutting
of tracks and the providing of portable crush-
ing mills for use in mountainous country.
Because of the hardship and labour it en-
tailed, little attempt was made to penetrate
tihis district while others more accessible
and more easily worked were yielding gold so
abundantly. Its mining development was de-
ferred until the surface wealth of the west-
ern fields had been largely realised, and it was
2,822,1910 z.
not till about 1868 that it became a large gold
producer. From that time, however, it
steadily gained in importance. As its rich re-
turns attracted attention, it was realised that a
new province of first magnitude and brilliant
promise had been opened up. Over the last
sixteen years its output has advanced at the
following rate of progression :
Oz.
For the 39 years ended December, 1907,
during which it has been a contributor to the
general yield, Gippsland has produced
2,822,1910 Z.
Although Gippsland is a large district —
about 200 miles long by 160 miles in width —
it is auriferous over nearly the whole of this
area. Mineralogically it may be divided into
belts or zones, which differ from each other,




and also from the rest of the State, both in
the occurrence of the reefs and the associated
minerals. In the Walhalla belt, for instance,
many of the reefs are in or associated with
dykes, and the mines are much larger and fur-
ther apart than in the other Gippsland belts,
whereas in other parts of Gippsland one may
see, say at Cassilis, reefs in schist or granite,
or in both, with complex minerals, and find a
dozen reefs in as many hundred yards. It is
this which has made Eastern Gippsland a typi-
cal miner’s field. The belt that has produced
the most gold is that starting below Walhalla
and running northwards through Jericho. Mat-
lock, Enoch’s Point, Wood’s Point, and Jamie-
son. Had it remained undiscovered up to the
present, and had a body of experienced pros-
pectors and miners rushed it like Western
Australia was rushed, what phenomenal re-
turns would have been flashed across the seas.
The Morning Star mine gave i0,0000z., or
,£40,000 worth, of gold in 10 days, and there
are other mines rivalling it in richness ajl
around, at Matlock, Jamieson, and Walhalla,
while the Long Tunnel mine, at the last men-
tioned place, has proved to be one of the rich-
est and most uniform gold-producers in the
world. The Victor’s Quartz and the New Loch
Fyne, which are still working at Matlock,
have paid ,£30,000 and £109,000 respectively
in dividends.
Freestone Creek, the lower extremity of
the next, or Grant belt, heavy alluvial gold has
been obtained. The source'of this gold has
been found, and a large amount of gold taken
out. The yellow metal occurred in lumps be-
tween two bedding planes. This was the first
discovery of reef gold in Devonian rock in Vic-
toria . The Grant belt lies south of the Great
Dividing Range, and is practically confined to
the watersheds of the Mitchell River and its
tributaries.
Grant itself has produced a great deal of
gold. At a place called Mayford, at the head
of the Dargo River, many good shows were
worked some years ago by'the miners, but the
reefs were abandoned as soon as water and
mineral were reached; yet this place is well
worth prospecting.
At the southern extremity of this belt lies the
goldfield of Bulumwaal, on Boggy Creek. This
creek has produced more gold than anv other
in Gippsland, and the Beehive Co. is working.
About seven miles to the east of Bulumwaal
lies the township of Deptford, on the Nichol-
son River. The main lines of reef at this
place are confined to a small area. The reefs
are among the best defined in Gippsland, cut-
ting the strata at a slight angle, and having
clean, well-defined walls; the shoots of stone
make along these in regular intervals, and the
walls come together where there is no quartz.
Crossing the Divide, between the Nicholson
and the Tambo Rivers, the goldfield of
Haunted Stream, or Stirling, is entered. The
country is composed of a dense hornfels rock,
hard as flint, and very much broken and dis-
turbed by faults. The reefs have formed be-
tween these faulting planes, and run in almost
all directions. By following up the stream one
comes to Sheepstation Creek; the auriferous
belt lies on the Divide between the Mitchell
and Tambo Rivers, and about five miles from
Mount Baldhead. Many rich shoots of stone
have been discovered here, and phenomenal
returns obtained, but the tops of the hills, so
to speak, are only scratched yet. About 12
miles further on, Cassilis is reached. The com-
pany of that name has turned out 67,0000 z. of
gold, and paid £14,000 in dividends. At pre-
sent it is engaged on a large electro-hvdraulic
scheme, at a cost of £17,000. Most of the
reefs lie in schist or diorite, are splendidly de-
fined, with good walls, have rich shoots in
them, and are heavily mineralised; the com-
moner minerals being galena, blende, arsenical
pyrites, and sometimes copper pyrites. The
gold is associated with a great deal of silver.
Nearly all the creeks and spurs surrounding
these places are auriferous.
Mount Wills is a field 20 miles from Omeo,
where some rich reefs —Maude and Home-
ward Bound, Scot’s Perseverance, Meer-
schaum, Mt. Moran, and Yellow Girl, amongst
others—are being opened up.
Among the other noteworthy goldfields and
gold-bearing zones in Eastern Gippsland may
be mentioned the Bemm River, Bendoc, Bo-
nang, and Mallacoota. The first named lies
about 40 miles to the east of Orbost. The
reefs opened up are small, but rich, and it will
probably turn out to be a good co-operative
party field. Bendoc, Bonang, and Mallacoota
all have small reefs, rich and patchy stone,
more suited for miners than companies. There
is still, however, a large tract of country al-
most unexplored, and a dozen goldfields could
easily exist in it. The possibilities of silver
being discovered in large quantities are great.
Many lodes exist of immense size, all contain-
ing a little silver and gold, and if one of these

metals the Broken Hill lode would be small

at Gelantipy, and these, if they prove pay-
able, will have great influence in causing the
country to be prospected for silver. Lead

which it returned to its shareholders

Pride of place among the Gippsland gold-
fields, however, belongs to Walhalla, which
has acquired a world-wide renown through the
prolonged productiveness of two mines, the
Long Tunnel and the Long Tunnel Extended,
which between them have paid over two mil-
lion sterling in dividends, and are still on the
dividend list. Several other mines, which were
at work on what is known as “ Cohen’s” line of
reef, have been absorbed by the two companies
named, which have thus acquired large leases,
has been maintained, but not, at times, with-
out a struggle, and the way in which crises
have been faced, and difficulties overcome, can-
not fail to excite universal admiration. At one
time it seemed as if the solution of all pro-
blems would be found in amalgamation, but
these proposals having been definitely rejected,
no time was lost by either company in demon-
strating its courage and ability to play a lone
hand. The problems of the Extended Co.

bour, and its main task comparatively straight-
forward, if somewhat arduous. The main
shaft has been sunk 900 ft. in little more than
six years. The timber and fuel tramway, taken
over from the North Long Tunnel Company,
has been relaid, the main line extended about
three miles, branch lines cut for about two
miles, and a second locomotive purchased.
The aggregate length of tramway is now about
12 miles. After crushing at a 30-head battery,
owned by the Long Tunnel Company, for over
twenty years, the Extended decided to erect a
reducing mill of its own, and this was com-
pleted in 1903. The new plant cost about
and crushes about 1300 tons of
material per month. An electric lighting plant
has been obtained, the new battery tunnel to
the machinery chamber and underground levels
now being fitted with electric lights. An under-
ground telephone has also been installed. Re-
cently new winding ropes were obtained
of sufficient length to haul from 3500 ft. When
to the above are added several thousand pounds
expended on a new winding plant in 1901, and
00 paid for the North Long Tunnel pro-
perty, it would be a captious critic who would
reproach the Extended management with lack
of energy during the past decade. Yet by
comparison with the achievements of the Long
Tunnel Company, these important operations
are of no great magnitude. On the failure to
amalgamate, the position of the Long Tunnel
Company was far more serious than that of
the Extended. The inferior quality of the lode
in the deep levels rendered the high cost of
working a deep blind shaft with compressed
air, and several subsequent handlings of
material, prohibitive; while, at the same time,
the shaft was practically useless for working
the payable stone that was gradually being
developed by the Extended Company on the
-southern mutual boundary. The Long Tunnel
main shaft might have been deepened, and
drives put in north to work this ground, but
the long levels and rapidly increasing length of
crosscuts would have made working costs high,
while making no practical provision for work-
ing the northern (or north-western) ground,
where ore still remained to be extracted at a
profit, providing that working expenses could
be reduced to a reasonable figure. Quite a
number of schemes were projected; one was a
new main shaft to an adit or the surface in
the neighbourhood of the Extended main
shaft. Work in the blind shaft had ceased in
January, 1901, and in the intervening period
the main shaft had been deepened from 900
to nooft. It was ultimately decided to sink
an incline shaft simultaneously from the sur-
face and the 900 ft. level, to a depth of 3000
ft. The successful accomplishment of this
task was regarded as a triumph of engineering
skill, and has enabled the company to bring
stone from the face of the bottom level to the
hopper with practically no handling, and so to
reduce its working costs that ydwts. to the ton
will pay.
Of late years Gippsland has assumed im-
portance from a new aspect, viz., as a dredging
area. Payable gold has been found in the
watershed of the Mitta Mitta River, at Omeo
and Mt. Wills, and nearly the whole of the
4000 acres available on the Mitchell River have
been applied for. Dredging is also in progress
at the Crooked River, the Dargo, and Boggy
Creek, and pump sluicing is in progress at
Swift’s Creek, and in contemplation on the
Nicholson and the upper portions of the Tam-
bo River.
Near Toora, in South Gippsland, there is a
belt of tin-bearing deposits 15 miles in length,
and covering about 2000 acres. Since the
opening of the field, in 1870, the upper
washes of a few acres have been worked for
a return of about worth of tin, but
those in the bedrock remain untouched.

Deep Leads Mining.
A Wonderful Achievement.
What deep leads mining stands for in con-
nection with the Victorian gold production is
attested by the records of many of the mines
in various parts of the State. Indeed mining
men well know that in point of importance the
pioneer deep lead systems of the State closely
partner its reef systems.
Deep lead mining as carried on at present
mav be characterised as a remarkable achieve-
ment of modern enterprise. Its object is to
recover from the bed of a long buried sys-..
tem the gold deposited during the remote past
by the water’s flow. It requires no stretch of
imagination to carry one’s thoughts back
through long ages to the time when what are
now the deep leads of Victoria formed the
main drainage channels of the country. The
hills were then much higher than what they
now are, larger streams of water were flowing
in their channels, with heavy floods during
the rainy season. It is easy to imagine, for
instance, the creeks flowing from Creswick
northward, which has since produced im-
mense quantities of gold, forming eventually
a river flowing nearly parallel with what is
now the Loddon River. During what is termed
the pliocene period, a change took place ;
earthquakes shook the land; volcanoes poured
forth their streams of molten lava, filling
gullies, creeks and rivers, and in many cases,
so it is recorded by the geological officers of the
Mines Department, forming one vast, almost
level, plain of what is now commonly called
bluestone or basalt. The same change took
place over many other portions of Victoria,
especiallv throughout the western district.
Some of these ancient river systems drained
areas containing widely distributed gold reefs,
and from these regions large amounts of
sand and quartz gravel were eroded and
washed down by the streams and deposited
along the bottoms of the ancient valleys. The
gold contained in these sands and gravels was
concentrated bv nature near the base of these
beds, i.e., near the “bedrock.” The gold-
bearing sand and gravel is usually referred
to as the “wash.” The leads thus follow the
bottoms of the ancient valleys, and have in
general distribution all of the characteristics of
modern drainage systems, with tributaries
opening into larger streams and eventually
into large trunk rivers and valleys.
The leads known to exist are shown below.
The portions marked (a) have been proved by
boring, etc. ; of those marked (b) there is not
sufficient data to warrant any further state-
ment other than that of the probable
The Loddon is the largest system, and is
the most important system of alluvial auri-
ferous deposits in the world. The area of the
watershed of the present Loddon River sys-
tem to as far north as Inglewood is approxim-
ately 4000 square miles, and that of the
Avoca River system 1500 square miles. The
respective areas prior to the basaltic overflow
were, however, 3000 and 2500 square miles.
It was the basaltic flow down the Madame

Hopkins Valley that diverted the water from
a large area into the Loddon River.
The Berry Lead proper is formed by the
junction of the Ristori and Dykes Leads.
This junction takes place in the Lone Hand
Co.’s mine, and the lead then continues in
a north-easterly direction through the old
Madame Berry Co., Berry Consols and Berry
Consols Extended Co., where it is being
worked at present. The Australasian Lead
heading from Creswick joins the Berry Lead
in the Berry Consols Co. lease. The Berry
Lead is situated on the same auriferous belt
that so enriched the surface gravels lying
on it between Buninyong and Creswick; north
of the latter town silurian rocks and gravels
became overlaid with the basaltic flows which
bury the whole Loddon Valley. The poorer
values of the wash in the Berry Consols Ex-
tended and other mines to the north is due
to the presence of very little coarse gold.
This is due to the lead being located off the
belt of enrichment, and the wash has had
to rely almost entirely on transported gold
from the upper parts of the lead, and from
small tributaries from the east. The Ristori
Co. worked a well-defined lead some 400 ft.
wide continuously for nearly one mile. At
a sharp bend of the lead the wash in the gutter
was unpayable for about 700 ft. ; for the
whole of this length, however, a rich “reef
wash” was found on the inner side, and
this continued for a width of 250 ft., a total
distance of 1600 ft. This wash was some 20
ft. to 30ft. above the bed of the main gutter.
The Loughlin Co. worked a lead for 1500 ft.,
with an average width of 300 ft. On taking
a slight easterly trend the lead crossed a very
hard bar of bedrock, leaving on the west side
of the bar an older bed of wash, which re-
unites with the newer and deeper easterly
lead in about 2000 ft. The older (west) lead
of wash was highly payable, but the eastern
branch was practically barren ; this was prob-
ably due to the waters which formed the more
-recent channel not having time to re-concen-
trate the gold from the older beds of wash.
The feature about the lead in the famous
Madame Berry mine, which produced gold to
the value of 758, paid ,700 in
dividends, £433’°°° in wages, and ,£130,000
royalty, on a capital of is its ab-
normal richness compared with the mines al-
ready below it. The following are from re-
turns published, giving particulars of some
of the richest deep lead mines that have been
worked. These mines are only on tributaries
,ot the main trunk leads :

The Carisbrook, or Maryborough, lead be-
gins beneath the basalt in the vicinity of
Mount Mitchell, some six miles west of Clunes.
The lead has been proved to be unpayable
to where it is joined by the rich tributary
called the Sadowa Lead, which is formed by
the junction of the small rich gutters con-
stituting the Talbot diggings, which lie on
one of the belts of enrichment. The non-
auriferous character of the wash at the head
of the lead in the vicinity of the northerly
continuation of this belt is probably due to
the granitic bedrock which is there present.
The Sadowa Lead had an exceptionally steep
gradient, and this accounts for the richness
of the main lead immediately below the con-
fluence of the Sadowa Lead, and for the great
falling off in value some little distance be-
yond. For a distance of several miles below
this rich wash, although prospected at fre-
quent intervals, the lead was unpayable till
it crossed the reef near Majorca; here the
gravels were enriched by the local coarse gold.
The enriching effect of the local gold from
the belt of reefs which this lead crossed at
Majorca did not extend far into the Chalks
Freehold Co., the mine below the Napier
Freehold Co. In Chalks No. i Co. glacial
conglomerate first makes its appearance, as
the bedrock and payable wash did not con-
tinue for more than two-thirds of a mile after
the lead left the silurian rock. Towards the
northern end of the mine, however, a patch
of silurian bedrock, containing the continua-
tion of the Majorca quartz reef, reap-
pears, and enriches the wash for a small area.
From Chalks No. 3 Mine the lead traverses
the glacial conglomerate in a north-easterly
direction until it meets the silurian bedrock
on the opposite side of the old glacial valley-
in the vicinity of the Charlotte Plains Lo.’s
shaft. The head of the Duke Lead is in the
vicinity of Alma, a few miles west of Marv-

borough; here the lead is about 50ft. below
the surface of the alluvial plains, but the
gravels gradually get deeper till Timor is
reached, where the lead is some 200 ft. below
the surface. From Alma to Timor the wash
has been removed for a continuous distance
of more than four miles. At Timor, on the
eastern side of the auriferous belt, the quartz
reefs are apparently richer, and have had a
greater enriching effect on the wash of the
leads and gutters in the vicinity. From Timor
the lead has been worked by the following
The total gold yield from Alma to the N.
Duke Co., as far as records show, is 450,000
oz. The length that has been continuously
worked to produce this yield was about seven
miles. This gives the value of the lead as
about per foot of lead; it must be re-
membered, however, that at Timor the wash
was worked in places over 800 ft. in width.
The Duke Group of Mines extend for a
distance of six miles, but the wash has not
been taken out continuously for that length
because only sections of the lead have been
found to be payable. For instance, in the
North Duke Co. the lead had several large
bends in it. Where it was running north
with the country stratification the wash paid
to remove, but when running east or west
there was not sufficient value. An explanation
of this is given by Mr. H. L. Wilkinson in
his admirable paper on “Deep Leads” as
follows :—After the Duke Lead left the belt of
enrichment the wash had to rely largely on
transported gold for value. Where the course
of the lead was across the country stratifica-
tion, its bed had probably a steeper gradient
than when the lead was in line with its
course; hence it is probable that the water had
a more rapid current in the east and west
reaches than in the northerly' ones, conse-
quently less gold was deposited. Further,
it is always found that there is irregularity
in the surface of the bedrock where a lead
crosses the country stratification. This irre-
gularity sets lip eddies and counter currents
which prevent the deposition of transported
gold, and would cause the decreased value
of the east and west portion of the lead.
Before leaving the Duke Lead it is neces-
sary to point out the great disturbances in level
that have taken place since the laying down
of the auriferous gravels in this lead. From
the junction of the Duke Lead with the main
Loddon Lead to the Duke United mine, a
distance of eight miles, the gradient of the
lead is 15ft. per mile. South from the Duke
United mine, however, the bed is flat for a
considerable distance, and in the vicinity of
the old Grand Duke Co., the wash is con-
siderably lower than in the) Duke United
mine. This subsidence in the vicinity of
Timor which caused these changes in level is
probably the eastern continuation of that
noted in connection with the levels of the
Avoca and Homebush leads.
Ini point of view of area of watershed and
flatness of gradient of its branches the Loddon
Lead may be said to rise about four miles
north-west of Ballarat. Thence it continues
past Clunes till it is joined in the vicinity of
Glengower by the main eastern branch from
under the basaltic flow east of Creswick. With
respect to these main branches little or nothing
can be said either as to the width of wash or
its value. The only work so fax done is on
the tributaries of the Berry, Australasian and
Midas Leads. Northwards from the junction
of the two main east and west branches in
the vicinity of Glengower, the main lead is
located by several lines of bores, but they
give no indication either as to its width or
value.
The main Avoca Lead follows the Avoca
River, and is wholly covered by alluvium. It
is more than probable that northward from
Avoca the Cainozoic River had reached its
base level of corrosion for a very long period
prior to the silting up of the Avoca Valley
south of Avoca. The normal gradient of the
lead bed from Avoca to where it debouched
into the Murray basin would have varied from
15ft. per mile at Avoca to zero at a point per-
haps 15 miles north of St. Arnaud.
The river which formed the Madame Hop-
kins Lead had evidently pirated a consider-
able area in the vicinity of Ballarat West and
Beaufort from the southward flowing rivers.
The narrowness of the cross-section of this
lead valley at Lillicur and Bung Bong, and
the small amount of drifts between the basalt
and the lead beds show that the channel cut

The deep leads of the Chiliern goldfield,
in common with the rest of the inland lead
system trending northward from the main
divide, are at much lower altitudes than those
forming the southerly or coastal system, there
being a difference of about 300 ft. The chan-
nels forming the leads are fairly well defined,
and the wash regular in thickness. In the
deep alluvial ground, where little variation
in depth occurs, the fall in the bed of the
lead is regular, averaging from 20 to 25ft.
per mile.
Generally speaking, the shallower parts of
the leads, although payable, have not proved
as rich as the intermediate ground lying be-
tween the shallow workings and the present
deep mines.
A considerable difference of opinion exists
among the local mining men regarding the
trend of the Chiltern Valley Lead westward
of the Chiltern Valley present workings, some
advocating a north-westerly direction through
the Wallace Chiltern Valley Consols lease
and onward to the Southern and Chiltern
Valley United (see Sheet No. 6), and others
considering that a direct westerly channel
exists, continuing through the Chiltern Valley
Consols lease. Some idea of the value of

The thickness of the deposits overlying
the ancient river varies from 250 to 400 ft.,
the width of the ancient valley varying from
two to five miles. The “wash” or gold-
bearing strata next to the bedrock varies from
2 to 5 ft. thick, and the width of the wash
from 400 to 1500 ft., its length being, of
course, the full 21 miles of the lead within
this section. Overlying the wash there is from
50 to 260 ft. of debris, composed of gravels,
sands and clays, and overlying this, for the
most part, a considerable thickness of lava
and basalt.
There are two systems employed in taking
out the wash, both of which may have to be
adopted in any alluvial mine if the depth of
wash varies from over 4ft. to under that
amount. These systems are named blocking
and panelling. Where the wash is over 4ft.
thick blocking is the method adopted. To
work by this method the wash dirt is divided
on each side of the main wash dirt drive into
blocks of 120 ft. in width, usually called cross
drives, and from the sides of these cross drives
truck-roads are driven at intervals of 32ft.,
so as to leave a strip of ground 16ft. wide on
each side of every truck-road. The wash is
then taken out in strips Bft. wide, the height
varying with the wash. As the material is
taken out the roof is supported by laths, which
rest on cap pieces of round timber, which are
supported by pieces of round or split timber
(known as collared legs), 6in. in diameter,
and varying in height according to the thick-
ness of the wash. Blocking is done bv con-
tract at a price per running foot, the width
being always Bft. This system is in opera-
tion at the Charlotte Plains Consolidated
Gold Mine.
Where it is necessary to adopt the panel-
ling method, that is when the wash narrows
to a thickness of less than 4ft., the dividing
up of the wash into blocks and putting in of
truck roads is the same as for the other
method. The wash dirt, which may vary
from a few inches to the panelling limit of 4
ft. in height, is taken out in strips of 4ft.
6in. Where the wash is less than 2ft. 6in.
thick, it is necessary, when the ground is of
a loose nature, to take out extra country rock,
to give a working space of 2ft. 6in. high, as
men cannot work otherwise. While the wash
is being extracted the roof is supported by
laths kept up by panelling props (pieces of
round or split timber) in size, and from
2ft. 6in. to 4ft. long, placed about 6in. apart.
Panelling is usually done by contract at a
price per fathom, the dimensions of which
are Bft. 6in. long, 4ft. 6in. wide, and vary-
ing in height with the thickness of the wash.
A panelling party consists of six miners and
three truckers, who, for the contract price, take
out the wash dirt, truck it, and tip it into
the shoot. The mining company provides all
tools and material required except candles,
which are provided by the contractors.
It has been found economical to use various
53
VICTORIA AND ITS MIXING RESOURCES.


types of trucks for different methods of work-
ing. Thus where the jump up method of ap-
proaching the wash is used, door trucks are
found most suitable, as they can be pushed
to the top of the shoot and tipped easily. At
the bottom of the shoot there is a" door
opened and shut by a lever, and the wash is
thus easily filled into box trucks in the main
drive. To get timber and other requisites
from the main drive to the top of the jump
up a windlass is used. When the balance
shaft is used to approach the wash, it has
been found most advantageous to use box
trucks, which, when filled at the working face,
are pushed along the level to the top of the
balance shaft, and caged one at a time to
the main drive. The cage is lowered by
means of a friction brake. An emptv truck
or one loaded with timber or other requisites
is raised in the second compartment by the
weight of the descending truck. As the full
trucks reach the main drive they are pushed
on to a siding. There are three lines of rails
laid at the bottom of each jump up or balance
shaft—a main road, a siding for full trucks,
and a siding for empty trucks. When suffi-
cient trucks of wash to form a train have been
put on to the siding, an electric locomotive at
the Plains mine is attached, and the train
hauled to the shaft, whence the trucks are
hauled two at a time to the main brace erected
on the poppet legs about 70ft. above the
ground. The wash dirt is automatically
tipped into puddlers 7ft. below the main
brace.
The Charlotte Plains Consolidated Com-
pany, which is working on the Majorca Leads
near Maryborough, is now one of the pioneer
mines in the district. With a capital of
£ 40.000, an extensive plant was erected.
Further capital was forthcoming, interest was
acquired in the New Havilah, to the south,
and the Deep Leads Electric Transmission
Company, whose plant is at the Charlotte
Plains mine, was formed to supply power for
the Plains mine and also other mines in the
vicinity. The central power house was erected
near the Charlotte Plains shaft. It has
proved a wonderful success, and has enabled
a saving of 42 per cent, to be made in pump-
ing charges. There are three engines erected
in the power house, and they are of the hori-
zontal cross compound condensing side crank
type. The total weight of each engine, with-
out the rotating parts of the electric genera-
tor, is 36 tons. .Six Babcock and Wilcox
300 horse-power water-tube boilers are erected.
The feed water is supplied to these boilers
by two large Worthington duplex pumps. Al-
though the plant is a condensing one, there
will be some loss which requires making up,
therefore two of Caird and Rayner’s patent
evaporators are fixed in the boiler house, ar-
ranged to work double and single effect, and
having a capacity of 35001 b. per hour when
working double, and 42501 b. when working
single. Each evaporator is provided with
feed regulating valves, heater, steam feed
pump, etc., and a spare door and copper coil
attached, and a steam connection with the
boiler and vapour connections to the con-
densers. The electrical equipment is particu-
larly interesting, inasmuch as it includes the
latest type of machinery for generation,
transmission and utilisation of electric power.
The total capacity of this machinery aggre-
gates over 2200 horse-power. The alternating
current apparatus in the generating stations
include three 400 kilowatt machines and two
30 kilowatt exciters. The large generators
are of the revolving field type; they have 48
poles, and run at a speed of 150 revolutions
per minute, and generate a three-phase 60-
cycle current at a potential of 6600 volts.
The pumping plant originally installed con-
sisted of two three-throw plunger pumps, one
at each mine, New Havilah and Charlotte
Plains, capable of raising 3,200,000 gallons
of water 350 ft. per 24 hours. Later on a
centrifugal pump, capable of raising 2,500,000
gallons of water 350 ft., was installed at the
Charlotte Plains mine. These three pumps
raised 8,900,000 gallons of water 350 ft. every
24 hours for several years. More than a year
ago a turbine centrifugal pump, capable of
raising 2,000,000 gallons of water 350 ft. every
24 hours, was installed at the New Havilah
mine, so that the pumping plants are capable
of dealing with 10,900,000 gallons of water
every 24 hours, but as only a comparatively
small quantity of water has now to be pumped,
the centrifugal pumps are kept idle—held in
reserve —and only two poles of the three-
throw plunger pumps are kept going. Some
idea of the* quantity of water raised bv these
pumps may be gathered from the following
statement, that since 1902, working 4717,
the water discharged equals 13,847,800,000
gallons, and would fill a reservoir two miles
square, about 20ft. deep. The weight of the
water pumped would be about 61,820,000
tons.

A few months ago Mr. E. J. Dunn, tne
Director of Geological Survey of Vic-
toria, inspected the company's mines,

show that the most southerly line defines the
position of the lead approximately with seven-
teen bore holes. The more easterly of these
disclose two shallow depressions at a depth
of 251 and 287 ft. below the surface, which
are evidently the upper part of the same drain-
age line found in another section, and there
proved unpayable. The deepest trough has
not been defined, the last bore being on the
west rim, and its bed rock elevation 487 ft.,
which probably is about 72ft. above the bot-
tom. The basalt is very heavy, in places over
200 ft. thick, and underlain by sand and some
interstratified clays. The deepest trough
shows heavy wash up to 4ft. 6in. thick over
a distance of 1500 ft.; the four last bores
brought up colours of gold. The central and
most important line is where the shaft is
located. The surface elevations range from
828 ft. near the shaft to 646 ft. near the river,
and the number of bores put in, 14. Up to
No. 8 the bores indicated a shallow, wide de-
pression about 300 ft. deep, covered with a
great thickness of basalt (up to 260 ft.) This
depression is covered with quartz gravel, and
up to 60ft. of clays of various kinds. Bores
Nos. 1 and 2 gave colours of gold, but the
gravel proved unpayable. The main lead is
very well exposed by the bores Nos. 8 to 14;
it shows a trough probablv 3000 ft. wide. The
basalt is 200 ft. thick; underneath it rests up
to 170 ft. of sediment, at first clayev. then very
decidedly sandy; nearly the whole thickness
consists of alternating strata of coarse and fine
“drift;” on the bottom rests 8 to 10ft. of heavy
quartz wash exposed over a distance of over
200 ft. Bores 9, 10, 11 and 12 gave colours of
gold. Over a distance of 1500 ft. the bed rock
seems fairly even, and the lowest depression
has an elevation of 394 ft. The bed rock
throughout is a clayey slate or a sandstone. The
company, which recently received a grant
from the Government of to further de-
velop the property, is now carrying out opera-
tions from the Keystone shaft. A splendid
plant is in use sufficient to cope with the
water.
In the Chiltern and Rutherglen division
alluvial mining is closely associated with the
deep leads. The length of the alluvial fields
from the head of the Chiltern lead to the spot
where the main lead may be supposed to cross
the River Murray is about 23 miles, in a
straight line. It was in 1858 that the first
lead—the Indigo—was found, and the same
year the New Ballarat lead was discovered.
In 1859 the Indigo rush was over, and the
bulk of the miners crowded to the Suffolk
lead, when the great Chiltern lead, formed
by the junction of the New Ballarat and Suf-
folk leads, was discovered by the Nil Des-
perandum Company, in sinking a prospecting
shaft in what is now Chiltern Park. The re-
turns from the work done were so good that a
new rush set in, and mining went on briskly
till the leads became too deep, and water too
heavy, for small parties to continue work.
There was then a great probability of the field
being almost wholly abandoned, and it was
only through the enterprise and determination
of the late Hon. John A. Wallace, M.L.C.,
and one or two others, that work did not alto-
gether cease. For years Mr. Wallace spent
his money when there seemed little hope of his
ever obtaining a satisfactory return. In
the early seventies the district received a
severe blow from the failure of the Doma
Mungi mine, in which much local capital had
been sunk, but the Chiltern Valley Company
started soon afterwards, and quickly proved
the richness of the Chiltern deep lead, which
it is still working.
In Rutherglen the first gold was got in Sep-
tember, iB6O, the scene of the discovery being
now, as is the place which made Chiltern, a
recreation park. A great rush ensued, and the
population soon exceeded that of depleted
Chiltern. The shallow ground was highly
payable, as the following records will show :
There were also some minor leads worked,
but those mentioned give a total of 213,300
oz., and an additional 22,20002. was ob-
tained from half-a-dozen quartz reefs, of

Dredqinq for Gold.
Revolution of the Mining Industry.
Dredging for gold is, so far as Victoria is
concerned, a comparatively modern develop-
ment in mining. Since 1900 it has made great
strides, until now it has become a recognised
and important source of production, the value
of the output for 1907 being and
the amount paid in dividends .£38,105.
The salient points of this method of winning
gold are the immense quantity of material that
can be treated at a trifling cost to i|d.
per cubic yard), and the low-grade material
that can be made to pay (1 to 2 grains per
cubic yard). In the Annual Report of the
Mines Department for 1906 reference is made
to the Vaughan Bucket Dredging Co., working
in the Castlemaine district (about 78 miles
from Melbourne, the capital of Victoria),
which treated for an average of only 1 grain
per cubic yard 437,214 cubic yards of mate-
rial for 91402., valued at and paid
,£lOOO in dividends. The paid-up capital of
the company was .£3500, nearly a third of
which (28.57 per cent.) was paid back in one
year. This, however, is the record for cheap
working, the average for the whole State for
eight years (1900 to 1907 inclusive) working
out at 2.4igr. to the cubic yard for 88,328,016
cubic yards treated, out of which .£175,000
has been paid in dividends, irrespective of
those paid by private plants, which do not
make any returns to the Mines Department in
this matter.
In estimating the value per yard of dredg-
ing returns, and the cost per yard of treating,
the figures are worked out to" three places of
decimals, and so finely are things cut that the
profit or loss (happily in the vast majority of
cases in Victoria profit) lies in the decimal
rather than in the integer. But with an im-
mense turnover the profit decimal soon de-
velops into surprisingly important integers.
Dredging has revolutionised mining, as
ground that had long been abandoned as
worked out. or ground that was regarded as
too poor to be worth assaying, has been turned
to most profitable account. Old diggings are
consequently being turned over again, and
river beds and riparian flats made to yield
their toll of treasure.
Operations are not confined to dredging up
spoil from the bottom of rivers, lagoons, lakes,
etc., for floating dredges will w’ork their own
way into the banks of a stream, or, if placed
in a paddock, will work the adjacent ground
so long as water to float them and wash the
spoil is available. Dredges can therefore be
used to work any shallow alluvial flat where
the ground is not over 40ft. or 50ft. in depth.
They are not dependent on running water.
The method is to excavate a paddock in which
the machine can float and to keep adding suffi-
ciently to the water supply. The dredge will
then work the whole flat and continue to oper-
ate so long as the seepage is sufficient to float
the machine and clean enough to wash the spoil.
The active centres of this class of mining
are Beechworth, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Ben-
digo, Gippsland, Maryborough, Ararat, and
Stawell, all except Gippsland (a district) being
important inland towns, situated at distances
varying from 75 to 200 miles, principally
north-east and north-west, of Melbourne. Each
place is the centre of a wide district. Gipps-
land is the largest. From the sources of the
Ovens and the Crooked Rivers in Victoria,
right across the big divide to Mt. Dromedary’,
in the North Monaro district of New South
Wales, whose territory Gippsland borders, is
outlined perhaps the most extensive dredging
ground in the world. The gravels of this im-
mense area have been brought dow r n in three
flows. First, the deep level; next, the
“placer” or terrace level, 150 ft. to 300 ft. above
the present river level; lastly, the present river
strata. These gravels are apportioned almost
equally between Victoria and New South
Wales. Those in Victoria have their source
on the summits of Mounts Bogong and
The Fainter. Thence it bifurcates north to
the River Murray and south along the Mitchell
57

river to the sea. The distance, allowing for
windings and turnings, cannot be less than 250
miles. The whole run is auriferous, and, al-
though not all payable, nor even workable,
would, it is estimated, support at least 50
dredges.
Only the surface of this immense field has
been scratched, but the other districts, par-
ticularly Beechworth, Castlemaine, Ballarat,
and Maryborough have been worked more in-
tensively. The expression “intensively” is used
only in a comparative sense, as out of 112,000
acres of dredgable land only 2000 acres have

For facility ot reference, Departmental re-
ports on this subject group together Bucket-
dredging, Hydraulic Sluicing by centrifugal
pumps, jet elevators, and rotary hydraulic
plants. All these methods somewhat resemble
one another in the use of water to break down
the material, but their after effects in respect
to denudation and river pollution are totally
distinct, and, strictly speaking, bucket dredg-
ing, the least hurtful to the agriculturists’ in-
terests, is the only one entitled to be thus clas-
sified, The reason of the innocuousness of
bucket dredging is that it does not put an
ounce of matter into the stream that was not
previously deposited there, but only lifts the
material by buckets from the bow of the
dredge and re-deposits it at the stern. Thus
there is discolouration, but not pollution. None
the less the other forms are still largely in use
where the nature of the ground does not favour
bucket dredging. Thus in the districts pre-
viously referred to (Gippsland excepted) there
are 84 hydraulic pump sluices and 4 jet eleva-
tors at work.
Perhaps in no field has the method of hy-
draulic sluicing been employed so extensively
as in the Ovens district, especially at Stanley,
Beechworth, Hurdle Flat, Hillsborough, Yack-
andandah, and Buckland. One of the adjuncts
to this method is the giant nozzle, through
which water is directed with such force by
gravitation that it will do the work of from 20
to 30 men.
In connection with the modern form of min-
ing two names stand out prominently, viz.,
those of the late Hon. J. A. Wallace as pio-
neer, and Mr. P. W. Tewksbury as perhaps
the largest and most successful dredge-owner,
the man who was quick to adapt himself to
new conditions and turn them to profitable ac-
count.
The bucket dredge, which Mr. Tewksbury
favours, has now firmly established itself, the
system proving a very economical means of
treating huge quantities of auriferous wash.
Gravel, or river wash, is met with a few inches
from the surface, and to float the dredge, water

is brought in by means of a race some few
inches long connected with the river higher up
stream. Bucket dredging for gold is not very
clearly understood by the general public, but
the system is simplicity itself, and, with care-
ful investigation into the general conditions of
a property to be dredged (the speculative ele-
ment does not enter into the proposition), it
becomes purely an investment. In prospecting
and proving the ground the contents of the
shafts are put through a sliuce-box. The cubi-
cal contents of the shafts are then measured
up, and the gold from each separately weighed
and valued. When the shafts are sunk syste-
matically over the area, the general nature of
the ground is ascertained, and the value per
cubic yard is easily calculated. There are up-
wards of 28 dredges operating successfully in
the Bright district, and the gold won from
them is estimated at 30,000 ounces per year,
value over Half of this can be con-
sidered as profit to be divided amongst the
shareholders.
To be successful in bucket dredging, the
general conditions must be favourable to the
treatment. Clay, very heavy boulders, hard
rocky bottom, and sunken timber are obstacles
that often cause failure where the gold con-
tents prove highly satisfactory on prospecting.
Treatment of the quantity is the main point to
be considered after the property has been
proved to contain payable gold. Land that is
free from the obstacles enumerated, and, pro-
viding depth is right, can be treated at the
rate of 6000 to 12,000 cubic yards per week
with a good up-to-date dredge, so that it is not
difficult to arrive at the probable profits alter
satisfactory prospecting. Two men per shift
are all that is required to work the dredge, and
wages in Victoria work out as follows; —
CREW FOR ONE DREDGE' WORKING
DAY AND NIGHT
Per Week.
£ 2 5 12 0
It is therefore apparent that the wages are not
a big item. Firewood, which is worth on an
average 10s. per cord, is responsible for the
expenditure of about ;£io, as it takes on an
average about 20 cords per week for each
dredge. Repairs and renewals and general
maintenance can be estimated at from jQ 2O to
Jj 2 s P er week, and £6O to
per week is a fair estimate for total
costs. The majority of dredges at pre-
sent working are equipped with a 20 h.p.
boiler, a 16 nominal h.p. compound engine,
which drives the gear, buckets, and centrifugal
pump. A separate engine is used for the winch
and electric lighting. The quantity of water
required for the boxes depends on the amount
of material being shifted. A dredge working
on reasonably light ground, treating 6000 to
7000 cubic yards per week, would require 1700
to 2000 gallons of water per minute running
over the boxes. The boxes are of the ordi-
nary sluice-box type, generally 4ft. to 4ft. 6in.
wide, fitted with angle iron ripples and perfor-
ated plates, under which is laid first canvas,
then cocoanut matting. The boxes are given
1 in. to 1 Jin. to the foot fall. The buckets,
ordinarily from 30 to 40 in number, according
to the depth required to be dredged and length
of ladder, are an endless band, working exactly
in the same manner as the harbour dredges for
lifting silt in the water courses. The buckets
lift the gravel or gold-bearing wash, and de-
posit it into a sluice-box, through which a cen-
trifugal pump is sending upwards of 1700 gal-
lons per minute. The force of the water car-
ries the stones over the ripples and out of the
end of the box on to the end of the tailings
dump. Any gold that may be in the gravel js
deposited between the iron bars called ripples,
and gets embedded in the cocoanut matting,
and remains there until the mats are lifted and
washed, which is usually done once a week.
The quantity and value of the gold vary in dif-
ferent districts. In some cases large nuggets
are found, but 90 per cent, of the gold would
be like that already described. It is quite pos-
sible to work land by means of dredging, and
leave it in a condition so that it can be subse-
quently put to profitable use.
The pontoons of a modern dredge are 86ft.
long, 31ft. 6in. wide, 7ft. 6in. deep, and the
ladder is 61 ft. long. There are 37 buckets on
the band; each bucket will hold 5 cubic feet
of wash, and deliver at the rate of 120 cubic
vards per hour full. There is a 12m. centri-
fugal pump, delivering 2500 gallons of water
per minute, into the boxes; a 30 h.p, under-
fired boiler supplies the whole of the steam;
20 h.p. nominal compound engine drives the
buckets, all the gearing, and the pump. The
dredge is fitted with an electric light plant,
which supplies 40 lights. There are 90,000

It draws sft. of water, and costs This
plant is capable of treating from 10,000 to
r 1,000 cubic yards of wash per week at a cost
of from to i|d. per yard.
As an example of the capabilities of a mo-
dern bucket dredge, take the Tewksbury Free-
hold Gold Dredging Company’s No. 2 dredge,
operating in the Bright district. This dredge
started work in August, 1906, and during the
first five weeks turned over 58,000 yards of
wash. As the ground was only 12ft. deep, a
surface area of 3 acres was represented. This
company, with a capital of with two
dredges at work, made a profit of with
No. 1 dredge working 16 months in ground
worth under 3d. per cubic yard; and with No.
2 dredge, working 10 months in ground worth
under 4d. per cubic yard. The land operated
on consisted of flats 15ft, above the present
river level, and formerly used as grass pad-
docks, and partially cultivated. Yet another
company, the Tewksbury Gold Dredging Com-
pany, prospected its lease as worth Bd. per
cubic yard, and the actual results for 26
months’ work gave 7jd., so that the prospect-
ing was very accurate. This company, with a
capital of has paid in dividends 20s.
6d. in the jQ within two years, and in addition
has secured over jQiooo worth of extra pro-
perty.
The following tables show the progress that
has been made by the dredging industry in
Victoria since the beginning of the present
century, and how successfully miners accus-
tomed to exploit the gold-bearing gravels on
river banks, and tantalised by being obliged to
cease following some rich ‘Tun” of ground on
account of its having dipped underneath a
stream, have adopted and developed a method
which has enabled them, at small cost, to
overcome the difficulty, and profitably prose-
cute their industry even in the river bed itself.

Nuqqets.
Some of the Largest in the World.
One of the chief characteristics in Victoria
in mining has been the finding of nug-
gets within a few feet of the sur-
face. and ranging to a depth of over
440 ft. Many of these nuggets are the largest
in the world, and have realised very handsome
figures. The heaviest and most valuable, named
'The Welcome Stranger,” which was found
only a few inches below the surface at Molia-
gul. in the neighbourhood of Dunolly, turned
the scale at 25200 Z. It measured 21 inches in
length and 10 inches in thickness, and, though
mixed with quartz, the great body of the nug-
get was solid gold. The price brought for this
piece of gold was The lucky finders
detached and gave to their friends a number
of specimens and pieces of gold before the
nugget was sold. The melted gold weighed
226 Boz. rodwt. i4gr., and contained only
1-75th of alloy, which w-as composed chiefly of
silver and iron, so that 98.66 per cent, of the
nugget was pure gold.
The Welcome nugget, found at Bakery Hill,
Ballarat, on 15th June, 1858, was sold by the
discoverers for 1.0,500, and, after being ex-
hibited in Melbourne, was again disposed of
for £95 2 5- then weighed 215902. This
nugget was found at a depth of 180 ft. The
Welcome was melted in London in November,
1859. and contained 99.20 per cent, of pure
gold. Two other large nuggets, one weighing
48002. and the other 5710 z., were unearthed
in the immediate vicinity three years before.
The Blanche Barkly nugget (17430 Z. 13
dwt.).. of the value of 12s. 9d., was
found at Kingower, at a depth of 13 feet, and
within 5 or 6 feet of holes that were dug three
years before. Previous to its being melted the
nugget was exhibited in Melbourne and at the
Crystal Palace, London. It assayed 95.58 per
cent, pure gold.
A party found in the Canadian Gully, Bal-
larat, at a depth of 60 feet, a nugget weighing
161902., just after unearthing a nugget of 7602.
Two of the party had been in the colony not
more than three months, when they returned
to England with their prize, which yielded
them £553 2 7 s - 4d- Near the same gully, on
Bth September, 1854, a nugget of gold weigh-
ing 11770 Z. i7dwt. was found, and from the
same hole upwards of 2201 b. of smaller nug-
gets were obtained, so that the value of gold
taken from this claim was
“The Victorian” nugget, found in the White
Horse Guliy, in 1852, weighed 3400 Z., and
was bought by Parliament, at a cost of
for presentation to the late Queen. Close to
the same spot, lying amongst gravel about a
foot from the surface, the Dascombe nugget
was found in January, 1852. It weighed 332
oz., and was sold in London for
“The Lady Hotham,” of ioiioz., was found
at Ballarat.
“The Heron” nugget, found by two young
men near Old Golden Point, Fryer’s Creek,
Mount Alexander, was a solid lump of gold,
which drew the scale at iooBoz., and realised
The lucky finders had been only three
months in the colony.
At Kingower, two men came upon a nugget
of 80502. within a foot of the surface, and the
following year another nugget, weighing 7820 Z.,
was found in the same locality.
A party of three divided as the pro-
ceeds of working a claim at Back Creek, Tara-
dale, to a depth of 12 feet, their yield includ-
ing a nugget of 6480 Z.
In an abandoned hole at Eureka, Ballarat,
a 6250 Z. nugget w r as found in 1834. At
Mclvor, in 1855 and 1858, two nuggets, weigh-
ing 6450 Z. and 6580 Z. respectively, were un-
earthed in shallow workings.
A 6oooz. nugget, of the value of was
found at Yandoit, Castlemaine, in April, iB6O.
At Maryborough, in June, 1855, a nugget
weighing 103402. sdwt. and sold for
was found at a depth of only 5 feet from the
surface.

Two nuggets, found simultaneously at Dun-
oily, in 1857, weighed 295202. The gold was
distributed through a rust-coloured matrix.
When melted the nuggets produced 136302. 18

At Ballarat, in August, iB6O, at a depth of
400 feet, a solid lump of gold weighing 8340 Z.
was unearthed, and with it ioooz. of smaller
gold.
It would occupy more space than can be al-
lotted to enumerate the many nuggets which
have been found at various places, suffice to
say that amongst the number were the follow-
ing : —Biooz., 7820 Z., 7150 Z., 6170 Z., 5730 Z.,
5400 Z., 5370 Z., 4770 Z., 4780 Z., 4610 Z., 4080 Z.,
3840 Z., 3680 Z., 38402., 3380 Z., 3280 Z., 3000 Z.
Over fifty nuggets between 2000 Z. and 30002.
have been found at different periods, whilst in-
num rable records may be cited of pieces of
gold having been unearthed between ioooz,
and 2000 Z. and 5002. and ioooz.
Other nuggets found may be summarised
as follows : —At Dunolly the Schlemm nugget
was found, weighing 4780 Z., at a depth of 3ft.
from the surface. The Spondulix nugget,
found in a quartz reef at the same place, at
a depth of Bft. from the surface, weighed
1300 Z. Among other big nuggets since dis-
covered are the Baron Rothschild, 9002., at
Creswick, in 1884; the Lady Loch, 6170 Z., in
the Midas mine, Creswick, in September,
1887 ; the Lady Brassey, from the same claim ;
and in 1889, a 4610 Z. nugget, found at Iron-
bark, in a small pillar of ground between two
old holes, one 540 Z., at Rokewood; and an-
other 480 Z., at Pinchgut Gully, Ballarat.
Within the fortnight ending May 7th, 1898,
three nuggets were found, one weighing 127

Tarnagulla Nuqqet Field.
Romance in Mining-
No auriferous country in Australia is more
prolific in nuggets than Victoria, which has
achieved an enviable reputation in this respect.
Within the past couple of years the Tarnagulla
field has been the home of nuggets, and, in
consequence, received a well-deserved impetus
at the hands of prospectors. Midway between
line of reef was worked for a short time by
the two discoverers, and then it was divided,
one of them getting 25J feet, out of which he
took a ton of gold. Forty tons of quartz from
this claim are said to have averaged a pound
weight of gold per bucket. The other' not
finding the reef by the time he had sunk 70
FINDERS OF THE POSEIDON NUGGET
Dunolly and Inglewood is the township of Tar-
nagulla. In the early days it was famous in the
mining history of Australia owing to the dis-

weight of gold was taken out in seven weeks, and
three claims on the reef, whose total length
along the line was only 141 feet, produced
59,257uz. of gold from 24,369 tons of quartz.
How those enormous yields were obtained can
be understood when it is remembered that in
the No. 2 claim the reef was 20 feet thick for
a depth of 60 feet, and this enormous mass of
stone averaged 6oz. per ton throughout. One
crushing of 317 tons gave a return of 23970 Z.
The yield of gold from this reef often went as
high as 500 Z. to the ton, and the reef, con-
trary to the general rule, became richer as it
went down. The reef was worked down for
400 feet by the first prospectors; but at 350
feet it became poor. The amount of gold
taken from this reef, according to the best
authorities, was valued at Sub-
sequently all the battery sand on the mine,
which originally came from this reef, was
bought up and cyanided at the first works in
Victoria. Some of the sand is said to have
yielded as high as ioz. and upwards per ton,
and, taking into consideration that from 15,000
to 20,000 tons of sand were treated, the total
value of the gold won from the reef should
not be less than
That story belongs to what is spoken of in
Victoria as the “fifties.”
Within the last few years interest has been
revived in the district by the large number of
nuggets that have been unearthed at the Nick
o’ Time and the Poseidon “rushes,” in country
always accessible, but which has been princi-
pally used for pastoral purposes. The nuggets
were a revelation. No one, except, apparently
a “hatter” (one w 7 ho works by himself) ever
dreamt that nuggets, and big-sized ones, too.
could be got by the mere digging for them a
few feet from the surface; but this was the ex-
perience of a lone miner. Immediately the
news of the discovery became public property
the place was rushed from all parts of the
State, and nugget after nugget was unearthed.
The Nick o’ Time lead is situated in the val-
ley of the River Loddon, four miles east of
Tarnagulla. The early history of (he rush, in
common with many other alluvial finds in Vic-
toria, contains a thread of romance, fur gold
in the surface soil w 7 as found by a fencing con-
tractor named Polo, some six years before the
first claim was pegged out. He cut a nick in
the post, from the hole of which he had ob-
tained a gold prospect. On hearing of this
incident local prospectors commenced a search
for the marked post, and Hatt and party
were the lucky ones to find it and secure a pay-
able claim, taking out some worth of
gold. Thus originated the Nick o’ Time rush.
The Nick o' Time lead has been noted for nug-
gets, many of them, through their size and ap-
pearance, being thought worthy of model-
ling for museum purposes. The largest
(1050 Z.) was obtained from the Irishman’s
claim towards the end of 1904, and in shape
resembled an irregular oak leaf. To date some
160,000 to 170,000 has been won from this
lead.
The nugget period was in 1906. The locality
of the finds was named the Poseidon field by
the discoverer, after the horse that w 7 on the
“Melbourne Cup” of 1906. Within a few feet
from the surface innumerable nuggets, or, in
the vernacular of the miner, “slugs,” were
found. The largest (9670 Z. gross), appropri-
ately christened the Poseidon, was only roin.
underground. Then, in the shallow sinking, in
dark brown surface soil and clay, others came
to light, viz., the Christmas Box, 3730 Z .; the
Hazel, 5020 Z. : Georgina, 98J0Z. ; the Leila,
6750 Z .; and the Federal, 3870 Z. The gross
weight of these few nuggets, together with a
little gold that was obtained at the same time,
totals over 30000 Z., representing over
taken from a patch of ground only
84ft. in length.

Black and Brown.
The present principal sources of coal (both
black and brown) supplies, are at Gippsland.
The discovery of coal at Coleraine, Colac, and
Apollo Bay suggested the possibility of Vic-
toria depending on its own resources for this
indispensable to the industrial vitality of the
State, These, however, disappointed expec-
tation ; but the hope of a more fortunate re-
sult was strongly renewed by the discovery
of a coal seam at Kilcunda, in the Gippsland
district, 72 miles south-east of Melbourne.
This was the pioneer mine of the Gippsland
coal-fields. A later discovery was that at
Coal Creek, farther to the eastward, and this
was followed by the discovery of a still more
promising seam at Moe, Morwell, and Mir-
boo.
The mines at work in it are the Coal Creek
Proprietary, the Jumbunna, the Outtrim,
Howitt and Co., the Silkstone Coal Co., New
Extended Coal Mining Co., the New Strezlecki
Coal Mining Co., and the San Remo colliery.
In an interesting monograph on the geology
of Victorian coal-fields Mr. James Stirling, a
former Government Geologist, writes as fol-
lows touching the South Gippsland area :
This is the most important coal-field of Vic-
toria, and comprises an area of 1750 square
miles. It stretches from the Langlang Valiev
on the west to Merriman’s Creek on the east,
and is bounded on the north bv the Latrobe
River, and on the south by the coast. Part of
this area is covered by tertiary formation and
older volcanic rocks. Two distinct classes of
coal occur here, belonging to two distinct geo-
logical periods. In the Latrobe Valley there
are immense deposits of lignite and brown
coal of tertiary age, whereas the coal found
south of this locality belongs to the jurrasic
period.
The existence in Victoria of brown coal, or
lignite, has been known for half a century,
but the attempts made from time to time in
earlier days to utilise it as a fuel were, un-‘
der the then conditions, premature. Now,
however, the utility of brown coal is becom-
ing better understood, and its future as a
potent industrial factor is not far off; the
fuel is no longer the negligible quantity it
was once considered, and is now attracting
more and more the attention of the public
as a probable economical generator of power
for a variety of purposes. Numerous im-
portant experiments in the further manufac-
ture of briquettes and in the distillation of
the coal are being undertaken by Mr. Bayly,
of the metallurgical branch of the Mines De-
partment, with marked success.
Probably the first occurrence of lignite, or
brown coal, discovered was that at Lai Lai,
on the Geelong to Ballarat railway line.
There is here a great alluvial basin, almost
entirely surrounded by low hills of silurian
and granitic bedrock. The area of the flat
is several square miles, and in sinking in
search of auriferous deposits about 50 years
ago, the shaft passed through a thickness of
over 1 ooft. of. lignite. The Lai Lai lignite
bed is wholly unconnected with any other
deposit of the kind, though there are occur-
rences of lignite of small thickness under the
southern portion of the Sebastopol Plateau,
near Ballarat, approximately 13 miles dis-
tant in a south-easterly direction, and, in-
deed, more or less in association with all the
western deep alluvial lead systems.
Subsequent discoveries were made at McKir-
ley’s Creek, the head branches of the Tarwin
River, the Latrobe Valley. Discoveries of the
brown coal in large seams were made by means
of boring and sinking at a number of places
along the valley—at Yarragon, Moe, Boolarra,
Darlimurla, Morwell, and Toongabbie. At
Morwell in particular a diamond drill bore,
put down at a depth of about 1 oooft., passed
through in that distance an aggregate of 700
ft. of brown coal in various seams, the thick-
est of which was 250 ft, The deposits are
believed to extend underneath, between the
localities named, and thus there is in the
Latrobe Valley an area, roughly, of 24 miles,
by 10 miles, underlaid bv the brown coal in

the great thickness above-mentioned; one of
the greatest in the world. At Altona Bay bor-
ing proved the existence of a 70ft. bed of
lignite, but after sinking a brick-lined shaft
and raising a quantity of the fuel, the old
idea as to true coal beneath induced deeper
exploration, with the result that artesian water
was struck, and the shaft swamped. A bore
afterwards close by reached the silurian bed-
rock. after again piercing 74ft. of brown
coal, and tapping the artesian water beneath
the underlying clay bed. A little south of
Laverton, and at something over 300 ft. a seam
of brown coal 135 ft. in thickness was struck,
analysis from which showed the coal to be
quite equal to that of Morwell and Altona.
The strata passed in the 350 ft. above the coal
consisted of about 50ft. of basalt, a little
drift, and tolerably firm calcareous rocks. A
winding and pumping plant was erected, and
a shaft commenced near the bore. This
passed through the basalt, but for want of
funds at the time, went no further. Mean-
while, in order to secure from London the re-
quisite capital to carry out the project, there
were prepared plans, reports, and estimates.
Amongst other things, it was shown that the
equivalent in calorific value of one ton of
black coal could, in the form of brown coal,
be put into the furnaces for 2s. 6d. The
scheme was placed on the London market, but
the time would appear to have been inoppor
tune, and the enterprise fell through tern
porarily. The assurance has since been re-
ceived from London that if reports are favour-
able the capital will be guaranteed.
Some 15 vears ago. under the direction of
the Mines Department, tests were made on a
fairly exhaustive scale. The analysis and ex-
periments showed that the brown coal has a
calorific value of about two-thirds of that of
Newcastle coal, quantity for quantity, and
the better kinds are very low in ash contents.
In the raw state, though suitable for station-
ary and steamer engines, it was found to be
unsuitable for locomotives, and for the manu-
facture of briquettes appeared to. lack the co-
hesiveness of the brown coal so extensively
used for that purpose in Germany. A number
of briquettes were made in Germany from a
• quantity of Victorian coal sent for the pur-
pose. They looked well externally, and gave
good heat, but fell to pieces too readily in
the furnace, thus causing 7 undue waste. This
difficulty has since been, to a great extent,
overcome by improved machinery and methods
of treatment prior to pressing.

end of 1906 the total quantity raised has been

Economic Minerals and Rocks.
Their Uses and Variety
Victoria has scarcely passed through more
than primary stages of development. Indus-
trial pursuits are not readily adopted in a new
country. It takes time and study to find out
in what directions the population can form
useful cogs in the wheels of commerce, and
until leading lines have been laid down and
prosperous enterprises have been founded
upon them, the more thorough investigation of
the less obvious sources of possible wealth
is necessarily delayed. There can be no mis-
take in affirming that many mineral deposits
that in the future will produce millions of
pounds, and bind a vastly increased army of
workers to the State, have thus had to' await
testing. Progress has, however, brought the
inhabitants to the verge of exploiting their pos-
sibilities, whilst otherwise profitably engaged,
and great things may be expected before long.
Starting with the conviction that some of
the most priceless discoveries remain to be
made, attention is drawn to the fact that a
very wide range of deposits other than gold
and silver, such as precious stones, building
stones, pigment clays, and minerals, marbles,
infusorial earth, coal and pottery materials
are found. For general information, a brief
account will be here given of what is being
done with them, and the extent to which their
existence has been made manifest.
Galena. This is the metal from which the
lead of commerce is produced. It is very
widely disseminated over the State, and is of
precisely the same character as that worked
with such valuable results at Broken Hill, New
South Wales. This means that if the galena
deposits prove extensive, Victoria may ulti-
mately become a great lead producing country,
when the market conditions are again favour-
able. Certainly the promise given by the
discoveries of this metal announced are worthy
of the closest attention of capitalists. Mr.
E. J. Dunn, Director of Geological Survey,
says the testing done justifies very favourable
conclusions as to the probability of systematic
work being properly rewarded, but nothing
has so far been followed below water level.
The best developments are in parts of the
country difficult of access, but the construc-
tion of a few miles of good road in most cases
is all that is requisite to bring the products
to a railway, or direct to a seaport of some
kind. The most promising occurrences of
galena at present reported are near Buchan,
in lodes at Mount Deddick, at Pine Moun-
tain, in the Upper Murray district, and on the
Mitta Mitta and Dark Rivers.
Tin. Sufficient tin has been raised in
Victoria to permit of a small exportation trade
being started when the price was high,
namely, ,£2OO per ton. A considerable depre-
ciation in the value of the metal, of course,
results in the paralysing of the industry, effort
being at once diverted to gold seeking. The
State possesses plenty of the metal in the
same form as it occurs in Cornwall, England,
namely, that of ore ; so there can be no doubt
there is a good future of recurrent prosperity
for a Victorian tin industry. In granitoid,
porphvritic, igneous, sedimentary and schistose
rocks it is found in lodes at Mt. Cudgewa,
Mt. Wills, Pilot Range, and Eskdale, all in
the north-east; and at Mt. Singapore, on
Wilson’s Promontory, in the south-east.
Stream tin occurs at Beech worth, El-
dorado, Chiltern, Stanley, Tin Creek, Agnes
River, near Bruthen, Upper Yarra, Gem-
brook, Darreen, Neerim, and along the
Bunyip and Tarago Rivers.
Copper.—While no mines, ex/cept at
Mt. Bowen, which company has good
prospects, are at present being worked,
the sulphide ores of copper occur in
such quantities that in certain mining
districts such as Bethanga, etc., they could
be profitably converted if the proper
methods w r ere introduced. A mine called the
Walhalla, on the Thomson River, Gippsland,
was worked intermittently years ago for cop-
per in association with gold, silver and plati-
num. With a rather primitive system of
70
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


smelting as much as 650 tons of copper was
obtained in all, and assays showed that cer-
tain ore raised there contained gold up to
2dwt. per ton, silver up to i3dwt.per ton, and
platinum up to sdwt. per ton. The copper
there was in a diorite dyke, having horn-
blende in its composition, which traversed
silurian, sandstones and mud stones. The
mine has not been by any means exhausted.
It will probably be worked again when cir-
cumstances are more favourable. Copper has
been found at Granya, Cassilis, near Buchan,
Orbost, Accommodation Creek, near the
Snowy River, and other places in the north-
eastern part of the country, mostly in quartz
reefs in granitoid and porphyritic rocks. At
Bethanga it is seen in schists. Sulphide of
copper and antimony, and sulphide of copper,
antimony and lead have been discovered in
association at Warrandyte, near Melbourne,
and Steiglitz, in small quantities, as well as
in the north-east.
Antimony.—This is another mineral which
is fairly plentiful, and can be worked to ad-
vantage whenever it is quoted at fairly high
rates on the market. The chief places where
it is now mined are Broadford, near Kilmore,
Reedy Creek and Costerfield. An English
company is operating at the latter place.
Wolfram. —This most valuable mineral,
largely employed in the manufacture of ferro-
tungsten steel for high speed tools and mag-
net steels, etc., is being successfully mined in
alluvial near Marysville, about 50 miles north
■of Melbourne, Mt. Murphy, near Omeo, and
Chiltern, in the north-east, and near Avoca,
in the midland district. Small quantities are
being exported from Marysville. Its nature
is tungstate of iron and jnanganese, called
wolfram, and tungstate of lime, called scheelite.
It commands, as a rule, a very remunerative
price, consequently every effort is being made
to discover more of the ore.
The above comprise practically all the
metals, apart from gold and silver, that have
been or are likely to be soon turned to com-
mercial account. But the country yields many
more, regarding which greater prescience than
existing circumstances engender is needed to
foretell their ultimate market value. Iron is
one of these, and others are zinc, platinum,
manganese, cobalt, bismuth, mercury, chro-
mium, molybdenum, barium, and magnesium.
Iron.—There are very important iron de-
posits at Nowa-Nowa and Buchan, in the
morth-eastern district, but the essential of
working them advantageously, namely, good
contiguous coal-fields, is absent. Otherwise
their quality and quantity would lead one to
believe they might be very profitably worked
with the aid of a moderate protective duty.
Irregular masses of different oxides of iron
are met with through the north-eastern, east-
ern, southern, and south-eastern country, and
lodes of haematite and limonite occur in the
porphyritic rocks in the first-named area and
in diabasic rocks and sandstones of northern
and central Victoria.
Mercury.—A deposit was worked about 60
miles north df Melbourne some years ago, but
owing to the small supply of the metal opera-
tions proved unprofitable.
Marble.—With absolute confidence it may
be asserted that Victoria will in due time
achieve a reputation with some of its marble
products, and employ a great many people in
working them. The latest discoveries, too re-
cently made to have given opportunity for
systematic working, at Limestone Creek, in
the far north-east, near the New South Wales
boundary, are most extensive, and consist of
finely coloured marble, principally yellow,
fawn and pink. Beautifully coloured marble
in several tints is now being quarried near
Orbost, and at Buchan and Bindi good
varieties of marble abound. All these
places are very difficult of access by
land, but they are within a few miles of the
coast, and when these deposits are properly
opened up an outlet will no doubt be made for
sea transport via Cunningham. Encrini-
tal grey % marble, prettily marked with fossil
shells, is available for quarying in great bulk
near Toongabbie, in the south-east. At pre-
sent it is only being worked in a small way,
yet slabs bearing a good polish are frequently
disposed of in Melbourne, where they are
much admired. For monumental, decorative
and sanitary purposes there is a large Vic-
torian demand for this material, as well as
the coloured marbles from the north-east, and
this demand may be relied upon to develop
the supply. It is justly anticipated that some
of the latter will find a ready market, if ex-
ported to other countries. Ultimately Vic-
toria’s marbles must prove a source of vast
wealth. Some splendid porphyries are avail-
able for quarrying in the Snowy River section
of the north-eastern district, and at Mt. Cud-
gewa, further north.
Building Stones.—The State is most liber-
ally endowed with all kinds of building stones,
71

the working of which in one way and another
maintains thousands of people. Grey granite
is produced at Harcourt and Cape Woolamai;
red granite at Gabo Island, Castlemaine and
Beech worth; basalt at Footscray, near Mel-
bourne, and Malmsbury ; non-crystalline lime-
stone at Waurn Ponds and Batesford, near
Geelong; sandstone and freestone at Bacchus
Marsh and the Grampians, near Stawell ;
and slate and flagstone at Castlemaine and
Gisborne. There is an exceptionally wide
field for the further development of the build-
ing stones quarrying industry. The basalt in
broken form is largely used for macadamising
roads and asphalting. A continual demand
exists, too, for this material for kerbing and
channelling. Serpentine, a mineral rock of
green colour, used for various ornamental pur-
poses, such as mantelpieces and bath-room
fittings, is found in small quantities in the
west and in the north and south-east.
Pottery Clays. —Victoria’s wealth in clays
suitable for all kinds of pottery is enormous,
and, happily it may be said, although much
that might be done to turn these deposits to
commercial account has not been attempted,
several very large enterprises are prosper-
ously engaged in manufacturing goods from
them. There is perhaps no more hopeful in-
dustry operating on the mineral products of
the soil, other than in gold, than the pottery
business. Wonderful advances have been
made, in spite of strong competition from
abroad. From merely making bricks some
years ago. the companies extended their un-
dertakings to the production of drain pipes,
glazed tiles of various kinds, terracotta arti-
cles, flower pots and garden pottery. Then
tea-pots, filters, jardinieres, and more orna-
mental work were turned out satisfactorily,
improvements being made in the latter class of
goods until they were brought into conformity
with quite a good standard of art. The com-
plete sewering of Melbourne, which was taken
in hand during the last ten years, of course
created a demand for certain classes of white
sanitary ware. The pottery companies rose to
the occasion, and supplied great quantities of
it of equal quality to anything imported. Once
embarked on white ware they went in for the
manufacture of the commoner kinds of domes-
tic crockery, such as pudding basins, pie
dishes, crocks, jars, gaily pots, white plates
and vegetable dishes with great success. These
things are now meeting a large share of the
Australian demand. Up to the present the
making of china ware, porcelain goods, and
the lighter kinds of earthenware, such as tea
cups, saucers and plates is not done, despite
the fact that the finest possible raw material
is obtainable in the State. Fire bricks of
good quality are made at South Yarra, Mel-
bourne and Lai Lai, near Ballarat; but ap-
parently they have not up to the present the
durability of the imported article in gasworks
furnaces, as the gas companies still prefer the
latter. Whether this is due to the clay or
some imperfection in its treatment has yet to
be seen. Kaolin, the most valuable pottery
clay, is found plentifully, but through china
and porcelain manufactures not being yet at-
tempted, there is no local demand for it.
Large quantities are, however, being exported,
more particularly that raised at Egerton, near
Ballarat, which is particularly fine material,
found in a decomposed felspathic dyke. An-
other extensive deposit of good quality is
being worked at Knowsley, near Bendigo. At
Bacchus Marsh, near Melbourne, there is also
fine kaolin, which is being mined successfully.
It exists elsewhere, ready for working, in
several widely separated localities.
Pigment Clays.—Shales, clay stones and
mud stones of various shades of grey, red,
pink, yellow and brown, specially suitable for
making good pigments, abound in Victoria. At
Mulgrave, near Melbourne, efforts have been
made to convert these into saleable paints,
but so far with slight success. Still, that is
merely a discouraging incident. When the
matter is taken thoroughly in hand by people
with sufficient influence and capital nothing is
more certain than that these clays will produce
as marketable pigments as any to be obtained
elsewhere and in # other parts of Australia.
Quantities of himatite and limonite, con-
vertible into paint by grinding, are found in
the eastern part of the State. Sienna occurs
in lodes in workable quantities at Granite
Flat, in the north-east. At Ballarat, from
roasted pyrites, obtained from the concen-
trates of mines, a very useful purplish red
or brownish red paint is made, which has come
into general use. The marketable character
of this metallic product having been demon-
strated, it is singular that the manufacturing
of the beautiful variety of coloured pigment
clays available has not yet been systematically
taken in hand.
Infusorial Earth. —There have been several
valuable discoveries of infusorial earth, which
are being profitably worked for export, their
72

uses being to polish cutlery, to absorb nitro-
glycerine in the making of dynamite, to form
the base of toilet soaps, and furnish steam pipe
packings. This material not only goes to
Europe, but is sent in large quantities to New
South Wales. It occurs interbedded with
sands and clays in basalt sheets or in hollows
on the surfaces of basalt sheets. Some excep-
tionally pure diatomite, as it is called, is being
mined at Lillicur, near Talbot, central Vic-
toria, being light, porous and snow white.
For some years quantities have been regu-
larly despatched from there for abroad. Some
few miles further east, at Glengower, a similar
deposit is being mined. In at least a dozen
places in various other directions, it is obtain-
able in smaller quantities.
Abrasive, Moulding, Glazing, and Clean-
sing Materials.—For the manufacture of
grindstones, scythe stones, and. hones, the
\ ictorian sandstones and mud stones are
found very serviceable. They occur prodigally
in the east, central and Grampians districts.
Fine sands, suitable for iron moulding, are
found in the south-eastern and far north-
western districts, as well as at Rowsley, near
Melbourne. Polishing powder of very good
quality for burnishing cutlery and brass is
made also in the vicinity of the capital by
crushing felspathic dyke rock. From this
formation, which frequently occurs in the same
locality, good material for glazing can be got.
There is a large quantity of valuable felspar
which is not being used. In the Strathbogie
Ranges eastward, it is seen in numerous large
crystals in granitic masses, whilst in the same
direction there are masses of felspar porphyry,
which may be used for glazing. Nothing is
yet being done with it, neither with numerous
pure lime stones, silicas and barytes, not to
speak of kaolin, available for the same pur-
pose.
Lime. Cement, and Plaster.—ln several
localities in south-western, southern, central
and south-eastern Victoria first-class lime for
ordinary purposes is made by burning marine
limestone. A fairly flourishing Vic-
torian cement business has been established,
radiating from Lara, Waurn Ponds, and
Lilydale, and the supply of lime
mainly from Waratah Bay, on the south-
east coast, Mansfield and Lilydale, has for
\ears been a very profitable trade. Gypsum
is now being sent to Melbourne from Lake
Boga, on the northern plains, being ground
and used as mineral manure. For vines
especially it is found very serviceable. Vast
quantities of impure gypsum are obtainable
on the surface, and for many feet below, over
a large portion of north-western Victoria. It
is all being collected, ground, bagged, and
used for manure. Another useful mineral
fertiliser is phosphate of alumina, which is
being raised and distributed from Mansfield.
Arsenic.—This product is scattered through
the slates, sandstones and quartz of the State,
and identified as white mundic, in the form of
sulph-arsenide of iron; but it appears in
patches and lumps in the eastern districts. It
is turned to economical account at Ballarat,
where the oxide is obtained from the flues of
the roasting furnaces, and at Bethanga, where
it is being sold at 30s. per cwt.
Salt.—There is very general distribution of
salt in the western and north-western areas.
When numerous salt lakes and pans dry up in
the summer, quantities are bagged, sent to
market in Melbourne and exported. Near Gee-
salterns have been constructed, where
salt is being evaporated from sea water, with
financial success.
Graphite, Monazite and Asbestos are
found, but not in quantities or circumstances
that will admit of payable working.
Precious Stones.—lt would be a mistake
to close a general description of the economic
minerals of Victoria without referring to pre-
cious stones. They have been freely found in
various parts, but, unfortunately, in most
cases without those superior qualities that
distinguish the finest gems. Still, the possi-
bilities have by no means been exhausted. The
most promising find has been turquoise, in the
north-east, at Edi and Tatong, but only por-
tion of the stone is of the true colour. Jewel-
lers have been merely able to use it in rough
uncut form. Similarly, this is the only way
that Victorian opal, found at Beech worth,
has been marketable. Some good blue sap-
phires have been turned to trade account, and
also some excellent yellow topaz. The latter
are found rarely, but small sapphires and
emeralds are commonly seen in many locali-
ties. Large zircons of beautiful shades of red
and yellow are obtainable; also carmelian,
chalcedony, agate and olivine. But little or
nothing is being done towards devoting them
to economic purposes. Small rubies and small
diamonds are rarely discovered in stream
gravels.

VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


The Stale’s Timber Resources.
Variety and Quality.
Ihe time in which Victoria has been in
civilised occupation is so brief that intense
culture has been hitherto but little attempted.
Consequently each landholder, to make a liv-
ing, has had to occupy a greater acreage than
otherwise would have been necessary, and the
population has encroached on the originally
vast tracks under forests, and now about one-
tenth of the country is reserved for that pur-
pose. The supplies that are obtained from
the forest reserves, amplified by what are got
from clearing lands in private possession,
about satisfy the Victorian demand for tim-
ber, but there is a margin available for ex-
port. Probably when private clearing has
been practically done in the course of a few
years, in order to bring the progress of re-
afforestation into line with requirements, large
land resumptions will have to be made at great
cost to the State. At present the estimate is
that half as much land will have to be brought
back as is now under forests, namely, a total
purchase of something over 2,000,000 acres.
According as more forest land is parted with
by the Government, henceforth, more will
have to be in the future thus acquired.
Victorian timbers are of most valuable kinds,
both for ordinary purposes and the finer manu-
factures. The waste that has taken place in
their use during the sixty-one years of the
State’s existence, however deplorable and
crippling for the commercial purposes of to-
day, was due to pressure of unusual circum-
stances, want of general knowledge of their
utility, and the lack of an administrative con-
trol, that realised that this source of wealth
could be exhausted, or that had the requisite
powers to prevent it being squandered if ex-
haustion had been foreseen. A tight-handed
grasp of our timber resources in the past
might have left the country in a position to
export to-day, but it would have hindered the
development of the main factor in the build-
ing up of Victoria, namely, the great mining
industry, besides making many other pioneer-
ing enterprises unduly expensive. So, all
things considered, the spoliation of the forests,
calamitous as it is from trading, climatic and
hydrographic points of view, may have been
a sacrifice that has been worth the making,
especially as it is to a large extent reparable.
There is at least a hopeful trend in recent ad-
ministration. Not only has an Act been passed
which locks up all the existing forest’s re-
serves in such a way that they cannot easily
be further alienated, but replanting is being
more systematically pursued, thinning and
saw-milling are under better supervision, and
a proper royalty value has been set on all
classes of timber felled, instead of allowing
woodmen and others, who paid ridiculously
small license fees, to remove what they chose.
The result has been that the revenue derived
by the Government from the forests has ad-
vanced from in 1899, t 0 nearly
in 1907, in spite of a slight shrink-
age in the total area under control.
The little exportation that has been done,
and the prospects of export under present con-
ditions, may be soon described. Hard wood,
chiefly consisting of sawn bluegum, messmate,
and mountain ash, with dressed coachmakers’
material, has been for some years despatched
to South Australia and southern New South
Wales in small cargoes. There is still a sur-
plus of these timbers and of stringy bark. The
bluegum is strong and durable, weighing 6olb.
per cubic foot. It makes good railway sleep-
ers, upper timber for jetty and bridge work,
bridge piles, shafts, felloes, spokes, and
frames of vehicles, and is useful in building
construction. Messmate is mainly used for
building purposes in weatherboards, studs,
rafters, joists, etc., but certain kinds make
good railway sleepers and fencing posts. Moun-
tain ash yields a seasoned timber very like
English oak in appearance. It is used in
building and split into palings, shingles, rails,
mining laths, etc. Stringy bark is similarly
used. Up to 1877 between 5000 and 10,000
tons of wattle bark were exported annually.
In that year 16,378 tons, valued at
was sent away. There were then heavy de-
mands bv the home market to satisfv, and
74
VICTORIA AND ITS MINING RESOURCES.


Victoria was the largest exporter to New
South Wales and New Zealand. But to sup
ply these quantities, it was found strippers
were ruthlessly despoiling the trees. Stems
only an inch in diameter were being denuded,
and trees were destroyed at an alarming rate.
Some protection was then given by limiting
the stripping season thenceforth to six months
in the year, but, owing to alienation of forest
lands and little being done in replanting, the
bark available for export diminished in 1890
to 1181 tons. Since then the exportation has
been inconsiderable, but there is a lively de-
mand for this product, and the Conservator
of Forests is recommending people to grow
wattle on their own lands as a profitable en-
terprise. The percentage of tan extract in the
bark varies from 29 to 40 per cent. Remem-
bering the bountiful provision nature had
made in Victoria of all kinds of serviceable
timbers it has been always a source of irrita-
tion that the wholesale denudations of the past
have prevented the State from competing
with West Australia, New South Wales, and
Tasmania in exporting hard woods for street
laying to the London market. Victoria still
produces suitable material for this purpose of
excellent quality, but not in sufficient quan-
tity to spare. Considerable exportation of
eucalyptus oil derived from our forests is car-
ried on at remunerative rates. A large local
market is also supplied. At Inglewood there
are so many prosperous oil factories thgj; the
industry is one of the principal supports of the
town. Blue mallee eucalyptus provides the
greatest bulk of oil, and it is of good quality.
The forests also support a large honey-produc-
ing industry, bee areas being reserved in all
directions. Some exportation has been done
in that commodity. So much for what has
been accomplished. Now for the outlook. A
broad view of the situation compels the be-
lief that as time goes on, excepting in such
matters as wattle bark, eucalyptus oil and
honey, exportation of Victorian forest pro-
ducts must entirely cease, because the State's
own demands are likely to increase, whilst the
forest area, being already reduced 50 per cent,
below requirements, cannot possibly yield what
is even locally wanted without enlargement in
the way already predicted.
In his last annual report the Conservator of
Forests gave a hint of what is to be expected.
He remarked: ‘‘The attention of saw-millers
generally is again drawn to the fact that sea-
soned hard wood flooring, weather and lining
boards, are being imported into the State
from Tasmania. Large forests of suitable
timber, dotted with saw-mills, exist within 50
miles of the city, yet it is a fact that sea-
soned hard wood boards are not obtainable in
Victoria from Victorian timber/ 7 This cer-
tainly indicates that Victorian saw-mi Hers
stocks can even now be got rid of practically
as soon as they are milled. Long ago the Mel-
bourne City Council, being unable to obtain
regular supplies of blocks cut from Victorian
redgum at a reasonable price, had to import
New South Wales tallow wood and black butt
for the purpose. Victoria’s mining industry
necessarily makes a great drain on its forest
resources, and keeps the mills going. An-
other large consumer is the Railway Depart-
ment, which has over 3000 miles of lines to.
maintain, and for all the other purposes of a
progressive country timber is in great demand.
What is really available may at this point be
conveniently catalogued.
On account of its durability and the many
uses to which it is put, E.* rostrata, the river
redgum. must be first mentioned. Its timber
is of a deep red, very heavy, hard and dense,
with inlocked grain. Enormous quantities
have been cut since the foundation of the
State, and the available supplies on Crown-
reserves are now very limited, being prin-
cipally confined tc Barmah and Gunbower
Forests, on the Murray. The saw-mills on
this river now largely depend on the New
South Wales reserves for their supplies of
logs, and they are being cut out also. Red-
gum is greatly valued for use in contact with
the ground, hence it is preferred for piles,
railway sleepers, fencing posts, house founda-
tions, etc. It is also largely employed for
bridges and pier decking, short beams, cross-
ties, and paving blocks, and makes excellent
fuel and charcoal. A valuable medicinal kino,
which is a useful astringent, is extracted from
the older trees.
Red ironbark (E.* leucoxylon), which grows,
chiefly on the ironstone and schistose ridges of
the auriferous tracts stretching westward from
the River Goulburn to St. Arnaud, is heavy,
dense, strong and very durable in contact with
the ground. It is greatly valued for bridge
beams and piles, and ranks with grey box as
most durable for railway sleepers. It is also*
cut for railway waggon frames, bridge, pier
and jetty timber, and for spokes, etc., in-
conchbuilders’* work. The mature trees have-

VICTORIA AND ITS


been largely cut out, and the areas in the
northern reserves now being worked bear
growths of comparatively small size. The
white variety is known to timber-cutters as
spotted box, while in South Australia it is
called bluegum. It is largely cut for rail-
way sleepers, bridge beams, and fencing posts,
and in some districts it is considered but little
inferior to red ironbark for this class of work.
Grey box (E.* hemiphloia) is chiefly found
on the northern side of the Dividing Range
on clay or loamy flats, or on low hill ridges
mixed with ironbark. It grows to a height of
80 to 130 ft., with a diameter of 2to 4ft. Its
timber is of a pale-brown or grey, inlocked in
grain, and very heavy, hard, and durable.
The older trees are usually hollow, the “pipe”
extending right through the trunk, while many
are mere shells. It is greatly prized for rail-
way sleepers, lasting from 30 to 35 years in the
track, and is also in great demand for tele-
graph poles, posts, bridge and culvert beams
and piles, mine-props, shafts, wheel spokes
and naves. It is the principal firewood on
•sale in the Melbourne market, the largest sup-
plies being obtained from the north-eastern
district, where immense areas of young grev
box have been ring-barked by settlers. An-
other variety of the common grev box (E.*
albens) is found in the vallevs of the Tambo
and Snowy Rivers, and in the ranges east of
the latter stream. It does not attain a large
size, but is considered a durable timber for
fencing' posts. The Bairnsdale grev box (E.*
Bosistoana) is confined to Southern and East-
ern Gippsland. It grows chiefly on limestone
formations or low schistose ridges and slopes,
and is found to a limited extent between Sale
and Alberton. The tree is of a straight sym-
metrical habit, and attains a height of 100 to
150 ft., with a diameter of 2to sft. It fur-
nishes the finest and most durable pile timber
for wharfs and jetties, lengths of 60 to 70ft.
being obtainable. It is also in high repute
for sleepers, railway waggon frames, bridge
decking, sheet piling, fencing posts, spokes
and felloes, and studs and ground plates of
wooden buildings.
Stringybarks (E.* macrorrhyncha, E.* capi-
tellata, E.* piperita).—The first of these is the
common stringybark of the northern and north-
eastern districts. It is sawn bv mills into
ordinary building timber, and is also largely
split by settlers into posts and rails and rough
building material.
