A FOREWORD.
“Amity,” New Farm, Brisbane,
29th November, 1918.
A few words from myself.
I promised to write the history of the Yacht
Club, now yclept the Royal Queensland Yacht
Club, and what is here set forth has been my
best effort.
In one important respect I have been greatly
handicapped. After most diligent search
among the “ archives ” of the Club, willingly
assisted by the present hon. secretary (Mr.
Wishart) and others, no minute books of an
earlier date than the 10th July, 1900, could be
found. It is almost incredible, but it is a
fact, that of the many meetings and other
transactions that must have taken place during
a period extending over the first fifteen years
of the Club’s existence there are no official
records now available; and I have had to do
the best that is in me with such data as could
be unearthed from old programmes, cuttings
from newspapers, and investigations in other
directions—much of this material having been
supplied by old members who have kindly come
to my assistance.


Naturally, under .such circumstances, the
result is not all that I could have desired; but
such as it is, kind readers and fellow members,
take it kindly; forgive many errors of
omission, for I can assure you there are none
of intentional commission, and, please, forgive
me for all drawbacks and faults.
With best wishes,
Believe me to be,
Yours affectionately,
THOS. WELSBY.

“SEA FEVER."
I must go down to the sea again, to the lonely sea
and sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer her by,
And the wheel’s kick and the wind’s song, and the
white sails shaking,
And a grey mist on the sea’s face, and a grey dawn
breaking!
I must go down to the sea again, for the call of the
running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds
flying,
And the fleeing spray, and the blown spume, and the
sea-gulls crying.
I must go down to the sea again, to the vagrant gipsy
life,
To the gull’s way and the whale’s way, where the
wind’s like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn, from a laughing fellow
rover,
And a quiet sleep, and a sweet dream when the long
trick’s over.

History of the
Royal Queensland
Yacht Club
CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTORY AND HISTORICAL.
That most delightful of all modern writers,
Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson, better known as
Robert Louis Stevenson, or better still as
“R.L.5.,” wrote in one of his earliest produc-
tions, entitled “An Inland Voyage,” as follows
(and who of us as yachtsmen cannot but ap-
preciate his words) : —“I am sure I would
rather be a bargee than occupy any position
under heaven that required attendance at an
office.” And also—“ For will anyone dare to
tell me that business is more satisfactory than
fooling among boats.”
And there is a pleasure in fooling among
boats, be it our first experience of the early-day
square-ended punts or our last experience with
the present up-to-date motor-launches. There is
a charm in being able to claim their full or


part ownership that both youth and old
age appreciate, yet can poorly express in
words; and be it either standing on the
Hamilton training wall watching a cham-
pionship eighteen-footer race, the boats with all
sails and kites extended, or being on any one of
the crafts themselves, there is experienced an
indisputable feeling of pleasure that none but a
boating man can understand. And as I take in
hand my willing task of writing the history
and doings of our Club from its inception
in 1885, I experience a pleasure even such as
you, my sailing companions and friends, must
not envy or disturb, for have not you and I
“fooled among boats” and know, as did
“8.L.5.,” that after a good woman, and a good
book, and good tobacco there is nothing so agree-
able on earth as a river and the joy of sailing
upon its waters.
I remember the late Captain Mackay, at one
time Port and Harbour Master of Brisbane, at
a dinner of “ Ancient Mariners,” speaking some-
what in this manner—“ Take the boy on his
first voyage, as day by day he becomes familiar
with his changed environments; becomes familiar
with the ocean with ail its grandeur, its over-
whelming vastness; its varied moods of storm
and of calm; note how he marks with boyish
enthusiasm man’s intelligence and skill to
combat successfully with the fiercest storm:
then gradually finds himself possessed of a
spirit of manly emulation to which before he
was a stranger.”
HISTORY OP THE R. Q. Y. C.


It is my intention to make this brochure, if
it may be so termed, as chatty as possible, for
I am not one of those to put down in deadly
coldness records and recollections such as may
relate to our Club, but to give history and
accounts of ('vents in a pleasant, readable, and
presentable form. Dry-as-dust figures and data
do not possess the taste of caviare, aye, even
to an ordinary and unskilful yachtsman. I
remember a Dutchman employed by me when
I was in the shipping trade when before
Captain Fison for examination for a river
master’s certificate, expressing very forcibly
his disgust as to how and in what manner, and
under what conditions he w r ould use the lead line:
“I ’as no lead line; I finds the bottom mit a long
pole. ” .And so it is with me. I will not use the
deep-sea lead line in manner and method of
the man of w-ar’s man, as used even when pass-
ing my humble abode at “Amity,” New Farm;
nor throughout my writing will I speak by the
“mark” or by the knotted fathom, for I pur-
pose using the simpler way, as did my friend
the Dutchman, trusting that the result will be
found accurate enough; for you, my readers
of friendly relationship, well understand the
difference between deep and shallow waters,
even as well, may I say, as you know the defer-
ence due to a red buoy.
It is a long stretch to hark back from the
year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred
and eighteen to one thousand eight hundred
9
HIS T OUT o F H E R. Q. Y. C.


and eighty-two, for to the latter year, some say,
belongs the birth of our Club. At one time
it was generally understood that the first meet-
ing called to form the sailing club from which
our present club obtained its existence, was in
the year 1882, the venue being Lennon’s Hotel,
in George Street. Personally ido not agree
as to the year 1882. That was the year when
many good sporting men in Brisbane were en-
gaged in forming or bringing about the forma-
tion of clubs or combinations for the promotion
of two other branches of sport—the first (and
may I be pardoned for saying it) —being the
present well-known Brisbane Gymnasium, the
other the arranging of the first series of Inter-
colonial Football Matches between New South
Wales and Queensland, played in that year;
and I think I should have remembered the
sailing event had that also taken place in the
same year. Many of the good men and true
who became the originators of the Club aver
that it was in 1884 that the first meeting was
held in the hostelry yclept Imperial, and I am
one strongly of that opinion. X know that the
late Reg. Earle, Commodore 1892-1893, also the
recently deceased Charlie Lilley, often in con-'
versation together argued that they, as well as
I, were of the original members, and others who
will be named in later pages. From a little
book kindly sent to me by Waiter J. Morley,
bearing on its front page the words, “Rules
and Sailing Regulations of the Brisbane Sailing
10
HISTOKY OF 'MB R. Q. Y. 0.


Club,” I find the words ‘‘lnstituted 1885;”
and I think that should suffice regarding the
year of the birth of our Club. No doubt
a preliminary meeting was held some time late
in 1884, but while the little book referred to
gives the year of institution as 1885 the con-
tention that that was the date is strengthened
by other data before me as I write.
The late Reginald P. Earle was a yachtsman
and a man well worth knowing. An enthusiast
in all sailing matters, he has left behind him
many gleanings of yachting information ac-
ceptable and useful to me in every way. From
one book in particular, now owned by my es-
teemed friend, W. A. Douglas, Commodore
1898-1899, 1899-1900 and 1902-1903, I shall
quote often, for in that book there are preserved
useful newspaper clippings under chronological
order that cannot be disputed.
From that book I learn that the open-
ing cruise of the first season 1885-1886 of the
Brisbane (Amateur) Sailing Club took place on
Saturday, the 24th September, 1885, Sir Thomas
Mellwraith being present in his steam yacht
Bompy, and His Excellency the Governor Sir
Anthony Musgrave, K.C.M.G., putting in an ap*
pearance in the Pippo. As I purpose giv-
ing a chapter on ‘ ‘ Opening Days ’ J I leave furthet
reference to this one later on.
I have discovered that my own professional
services in the year 1885 were recorded, for

member, and Mr. Thos. "Welsby certified to
the receipt?* and expenditure statement ag
correct. 1 have no recollection of the fee paid
us, but 1 presume the same reward applies to
present day auditors of the Club, viz., the
honour and glory attached to the signing
thereof.
From 1885 until 1894 the Club was known as
the '‘Brisbane Sailing Club.’ 5 In 1894 the name
was changed to the “Queensland Yacht Club,”
and in that year permission was granted to fly
the Blue Ensign of Her Majesty’s Fleet. In this
connection the following should make interesting
reading:—
Admiralty, 21st July, 1894.
Sir, - With leference to your letter of the first ultimo,
I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty to forward a warrant authorising vessels of
the Queensland Yacht Club to fiy the Blue Ensign of
Her Majesty’s Fleet
2. The necessary personal Warrants for Yacht
owners belonging to the Club will be issued on ap-
plication being made to the Admiralty by the Secretary.
Such application should state the following particulars
in each ease: —Name of Yacht, Rig, Length, Breadth,
Registered Net Tonnage (to decimals), Port of Registry,
Owner’s Name.
I am, Sir,
Your Obedient Servant,

In May, 1902, the name of the Club was
changed to “Royal Queensland Yacht Club,”
which name it still retains.
In the year 3885, when the Club was known as
the “Brisbane Amateur Sailing Club, M the fol-
lowing were office bearers;—

It may have been noticed that in mentioning
the Opening Cruise in September, 1885, I have
placed the word “Amateur” in parenthesis.
This should be explained. The Club when first
formed was no doubt named the “Brisbane
Amateur Sailing Club,” and retained that title
for a while, but some time in 1886 the word
“Amateur” was deleted and the Club until
1894 was known as the “Brisbane Sailing
Club.”
Then in the year 1887, when the Club was
known as the l< Brisbane Sailing Club,” the fol-
lowing were the office bearers;—

II ISTOBY OF 'ME R. Q. Y. C.


Following on from the year 1887 until the
further change was made in the name in 1894,
we come to “Queensland Yacht Club,” when
the office bearers were;—
Patron: His Excellency, Sir Henry Wylie Norman,
G. 0.8., G.C.M.G.
President: Sir Arthur Palmer.
Commodore: J. G. Vidgen.
Vice-Commodore: James Clark.
Hon. Secretary- W. J. Weatherill.
Hon. Treasurer: R. Hookings,
Committee: H. Henderson, W. F, Cameron, R. P.
Earle, H. R, Eaton. C. E. Bernays, Jas. Clark, Cyrus
Williams.
It is but fair for me to record the birth in
October, 1887, of the King Island Echo, a paper
run by the enthusiastic literary (sic) members
of the Club, with Reg. P. Earle as its editor.
There is a bound copy of the Echo in the Club
rooms. 1 also have (me numbered in my private
library, and it does one good—that is the
older members—to scan it now and again
I was a contributor both in prose and—
poetry—-1 hope lam forgiven—under the nom
de plume of “Fiz. ” It ran into a small second
volume, but a fire at the Outridge Printing es-
tablishment at Petrie’s Bight was a good reason
for its discontinuance, and those of us who fin-
anced the venture smiled, paid, and looked
pleasant.
In 1888 the Club entered into possession of
a shed, built at the Hamilton as its hed-
quarters. The funds for this structure and
15
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


the land on whieh it was erected were
raised by debentures taken up by members, the
remaining balance being provided by that good
supporter of sport, Mr. Geo. E. Markwell, who,
though now practising his profession as a
solicitor at Innisfail, North Queensland, is still
a life member of the Club. The debentures,
I may add, were not interest-bearing, and
nobody ever saw—if indeed be ever expected—
the principal again. In addition to a fine shed,
with lockers, etc., and plenty of room for stor-
ing gear, there was a substantial jetty (de-
signed by a one-time committee man and one
of the Lassie “combine,” Mr. C. E. Bernays),
a slip, and cradle for hauling up boats. This
site for moorings, however, with sometimes very
rough ivater and a strong tide, and with only
an hourly ’bus service to and from town, did
not become popular, and only a few yachts
were kept at the place. The evergreen J.
Macfarlane, since a boatbuilder at the Hamil-
ton, was our caretaker. In the big flood of
1893, however, a large coal punt got under the
jetty and wrecked it, the shed and what was
in it were greatly damaged (to say nothing of
the boats sw r ept from their moorings). The
shed was afterwards sold “for removal,” and
the Club had to resume a habitat in the city.
The year 1893 sawr the first of the inter-
colonial sailing races for 22ft. boats, which
races were arranged under the auspices of the
Queensland Yacht Club, the course being that
16
TH E R. Q. Y. C.
HIS T O R Y


known as the Cleveland course. The
first of the two races was won by J. H.
Whereat in the Bulletin (builder H. McCleer),
from a design by Joe Donnolly, of Sydney; the
second by the Irex. a Sydney boat, owned and
sailed by Mr. N. Johnson. But I shall have
more to say about these races in a Jater
chapter.
It may be noted that on Tuesday, the Bth
January, 1895, the then Club Commodore, Mr.
E. H. Lawson, sailed for Townsville to take
up a Government position in that town, and
that on the Saturday previous he was enter-
tained by Club members on the river in the
s.s. Emma. Commodore Lawson was ever a
good solid yachtsman; the send-off he received
was well deserved, and a very pleasant after-
noon was spent.
We come now to a land mark in the history
of the Club, for it was not until 1896 that re-
vised rules and regulations were prepared and
printed for the guidance of the Club in respect
to sailing and general matters. The draw-
ing up of these rules was placed in the
hands of a committee of three, who spent a
great deal of time and care in their production.
The draft had been set up in print and revised
by each member separately and then again con-
jointly. Sailing rules of the Y.R.A. and of
the leading English, American and Australian
Clubs were carefully examined and adapted to
suit our local conditions. This committee of
17
HISTORY o F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


three, after their final revision, sent a copy to
each member of the general committee, who,
after several meetings, at which the rules and
regulations were thoroughly gone into, had
them printed ready for submission to and con-
sideration at a general meeting held in the
National Hotel on Monday, the 13th April,
1896, when the presented copy was again
thoroughly examined, and after a few minor
alterations, passed; while .at a subsequent
general meeting on Monday, June Bth, they
were finally adopted and ordered to be printed
in pamphlet form.
In my voyage of discovery into the archives
of the Chib, I picked up a notable landmark in
the shape of the first minute book that could
be found, and thereafter had plainer sailing
than when nothing could be found as a guide.
This book bears the date 10th July, 1900. It
contains 286 pages, and on the first of these
pages we read—“ Minutes of committee meet-
ing held at National Hotel, on Monday, 10th
July, 1900/’ The handwriting is that of our
old friend, S. W. Cameron, and an infixed
report is that of the “Queensland Yacht Club
for the year ended 30th June, 1900,” which
report is signed “For the committee, S. W.
Cameron,’* and the minutes were signed, as
confirmed, on the 13th August, by Jas. Clark,
who had been elected Commodore at the annual
meeting held in July. At this annual meeting
G. P. Southern took the place of S. W,
18
R. Q. Y C.
HISTORY O F TH E


Cameron as hon. secretary, and for the first time
your bumble servant, the writer, began real
active work, for my name appears on the Com-
mittee list of that year, and, curiously enough,
the elected Commodore, on responding to the
toast of himself, uses the following words:—“lt
was largely to sailing men that they would have
to look for assistance in their first line of de-
fence.” Thank Heaven, I can say now that
many of our boys—Club members—are defend-
ing our Empire both on land and sea.
And in the year 1902, when we were allowed
to call our Club the “Royal Queensland Yacht
Club,” we find the office-bearers to have been—
Patron: His Excellency, Sir Herbert Chermside.
G.C.M.G.
President: Hon. E. B. Forrest, M.L.A
Commodore: James Clark.
Vice-Commodore: W. A. Douglas.
Pear-Commodore: G. C. O ’Beirne.
Hon. Secretary: Geo. T. Southern.
Hon. Measurer; F. Cowell.
Hon. Treasurer: M. C. Dalby.
Hon. Auditor: F. Hambridge.
Committee: T. Welsby, J. Mackenzie. 0. B. Fox, H.
Marshall, J. H. Whereat, W. Norton.
Racing Committee: J. H. Whereat, C. B. Fox, W. A.
Douglas.
Xn the year 1902 the first House Com-
mittee was formed, their duties being the super-
vising of the rooms and providing evening
entertainments. The first Committee were
Messrs, Pox, Gibbon, Cameron, and the Hon.
Secretary. Prize money paid away was
19
history of the r. q. y. c.


£5l/14/-. And it was during the season 1902-
1903 that Mr. W. A. Douglas, whilst Com-
modore of the Club, was married, and a present-
ation to him was made by the members. The
gathering was at the National Hotel, the Hon.
E. B. Forrest presiding.
Then, again, it is recorded that on the 28th
April, 1903, a smoke concert was held in the
Commercial Union Chambers, Eagle Street, to
celebrate the opening of the new Club Rooms
of the Royal Queensland Yacht Club—rooms
which we still occupy. Yes, gentlemen, that
was the day of our coming into our present
rooms, and I think the removal from the cellar
of the A.M.P. Buildings has been quite justified,
for we have made headway ever since. Long
may we remember the season 1902-1903 for its
many blessings to us all.
The Club continued on its even course, with
fair winds and smooth sailing, and withall
making good headway, until the fateful year
1914, when, following the outbreak of the war
which devastated Europe, all racing and public
functions were suspended ; eligible young
members enlisted, and the energies of those
who perforce had to remain at home were
devoted to patriotic objects. In this connec-
tion I think it fitting to give an account of a
meeting of the Club, held on the Bth September,
1914, and published in a daily paper:—■
A special meeting of the Committee of the Royal
Queensland Yacht Club was held last night to consider
the opening demonstration and racing fixtures in re-
20
HISTORY 0 F THE R. Q. Y. 0.


lation to the necessity oi' placing all their energies
in helping the Empire in the present war. Mr. Thos.
Welsby, M.L.A., occupied the chair, and there was a
full attendance. A letter wa° received from Mr, i'ouglas
ashing that a meeting should be called, Messrs.
Douglas and Fox stated that British troops were, and in
the future our own troops would be. defending the
liberties of the Empire with their lives, and. they con-
sidered that an attempt to display any jollification at
the present time would be inappropriate. They thought
that the opening day should be postponed. Mr.
Moriey concurred. Mr. Hart said he thought the
racing fixtures should not be cancelled, and suggested
that the trophies won at these events be donated to
the Patriotic Fund. Mr. Dan MaeTaggart was fully
in accord with Mr, Hart’s suggestion. Captain Collin
said he thought arrangements might go on in the
meantime, and if necessary might be postponed. The
Chairman read a telegram from the Royal Prince
Alfred Yacht Club, Sydney, stating that the war would
probably affect its season’s programme. Pie had
been It; communication with the Naval Commandant
who had urged them to carry on functions as usual.
He suggested that a fund should be formed in the
Club to be donated to the relatives of Briitsh and
Colonial seamen lost in the war. He thought they
should carry out the functions as an aid to such a fund.
Mr. Douglas formally proposed that the opening day
function should be cancelled in view of the war. Mr.
Fox seconded the motion, which was unanimously agreed
to. Mr. MaeTaggart suggested that the opening day
expenses, say £3O, should be placed as a start to the
fund to be supplemented by members. This was
agreed to. Mr, Thos. Cobb offered to act as hon.
treasurer. The meeting concluded with three cheers
for the Empire and the singing of the ‘ * National
Anthem. ,f
Then, on the 12th August of the following
year (1915), it is reported:—
The monthly General and Committee Meeting of
the Royal Queensland Yacht Club was held on Monday
evening. Commodore Thos. Welsby presiding over a
good attendance of members. The Admiralty, London,
advised that application to fly the blue ensign would
MIST 0 R Y 0 R TH K R. Q. Y. C.


not be received during the war. It was decided to
donate £25 towards the Patriotic Pund. The Sailing
Committee's report and programme of events was sub-
mitted to the meeting, and it was unanimously resolved
that in view of the war no racing of any description
should be held during the coming season. . . A copy
of the resolution foregoing the racing programme was
decided to be forwarded to the various sailing clubs.
The matter of farewelling members of the Club who
had gore into Camp was left in the hands of Mr.
Douglas.

CHAPTER II.
OPENING DAYS AND DINNERS.
The first cruise, or opening ceremony, took
place in September, 1885, the twenty-fourth day
thereof. The dinner was held in the evening
in a shed'on the Lytton wharf. Amongst the
boats we find the following:—lsabel, cutter,
Hon. E. B. Forrest; Osprey, cutter, Mr. R. B.
Eehlin; Blanche, sloop, Mr. W. Pickering;
Annie S., 22 feet, Mr. W. S. Sunners; Sea-
belle, 21 feet, Messrs. W. J. Morley and E. J.
T. Barton; Edith, 21 feet, Messrs. C. B. Lilley
and E. Cullen; I jo] a, 20 feet, Mr. R. Earle; Ida,
20 feet, Mr. T. Botham ley; lanthe, Mr. F. D.
G. Stanley; Eileen, 17 feet, Mr. J. E. Harris;
Fantasia, dingey, S. Lawerman; Dot, dingey,
A. Earle; Coomora, dingey, Mr. H. G. Bourne.
The Blanche was the only boat whose
crew donned the Club uniform. The wind was
a stinking nor ’ easter. On the Isabel, sailed
by E. B. Forrest, were two of the sons of His
Excellency the Governor. When the boats
reached Lytton it was found to the dismay of
the crews that mine host, Mick Daly, had not
arrived with the tucker, but a wait of a little

It is written that not less than one hundred sat
down to dinner. At first I wondered whether
this was correct or whether it was the counting
of a thirsty and over-supplied reporter; but on
being reminded that the scribe on this occasion
was the old-time and present member, W. J.
Morlcy, that there were upwards of a score of
boats at Lytton that night, and that the shed
on the wharf, which was a large one, was packed,
my doubts were cast adrift, and I accept the
number without question. Walter Morley was
undoubtedly amongst the first, and was one of
the most active members, and from the weekly
aquatic notes and reports that he for years con-
tributed to the “Brisbane Courier” under the
nom de plume of “Tell-Tale,” I have drawn
largely in the following pages.
Our friend lately deceased, the Hon. E, B.
Forrest, was chairman. The various toasts were
proposed and responded to by Mr. Forrest and
Mr. Pickering, the first secretary of the Club,
and at half-past nine the affair was over. Did I
say over? Well, if I did I was wrong; I should
have said the formal part was over, for the
remainder of the evening was spent in con-
viviality, and there is still with me a lively
recollection of the dinner and its merriment.
The following afternoon the steamer Garnet
towed back many of the boats, a calm having
come over the river in the afternoon, and the
tide ebb.

Then the Club closes its first season on May
24th, 1886, the proceedings consisting of a
procession of boats, with a dinner in the
Hamilton Pavilion. The sailing procession
was led by the lion. B. B. Forrest. M.L.C., in
his fine yacht, the Isabel. Other boats taking
part in the procession were the Nyoola
(Geo. Markwell), Vagabond, Seabelle, Lola,
Wateriily, Dot, and Fantasia. It is in cold
print as follows; —“In addition to these, there
were three or four outsiders present, and as
the boats sailed down the reach they presented
a very pretty sight. ”
Comparisons may be odorous, so we pass on
and make no reflection of the year 1356 <is
against the years well in the ninteen hundreds.
The dinner was held in the Hamilton Pavilion,
as stated already. Tickets were one guinea,
and the Hon. B. B. Forrest occupied the chair.
Speeches were made by J. G. Drake;, Geo.
Markwell, W. J. Morley and R. Earle. The
Chairman in his remarks said the membership
of the Club numbered ninety-two, with nineteen
boats on the register, including two steamers,
which latter were Sir Thos. Mellwraith’s Bompy
and Mr. R. Dickson’s Scylla.
Season 1886-1887 opened on September 11th,
1886, the Hamilton Reach as usual being se-
lected, but the procession was a drifting one

on account of there being no breeze. (Vide
Inset containing fac simile of official pro-
gramme). The Commodore, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, was in attendance in the Bompy,
the Vice-Commodore’s yacht Isabel heading the
fleet. It is written that some forty boats fol-
lowed the Vice-Commodore, or tried to do so.
We And new boats amongst the number as fol-
low:—Atlantic, Mazeppa, Taipo, Sabrina, Siren,
Pelican, Thistle, Nyoola, Pert. The Q.G.S.Y.
Lucinda was also in attendance, having on
board the President of the Club (His Excellency
Sir Arthur Palmer). Sir Arthur must have
been Acting-Governor then by virtue of his
office as President of the Legislative Council.
Cheers were given for Sir Thomas Mcllwraith
and Sir Arthur Palmer.
At half-past six in the evening, upwards of
seventy persons sat down to dinner, some of
those present being W. T. Blakeney, P. D. G.
Stanley, J. G. Drake and \V. Kinniard liose
(Editor of the “Brisbane Courier” in those
days). Curious to note, at this very meeting
the question arose re throwing the Club open
to everybody and not amateurs only. Loud
cries of “No” followed the remark. The
concluding part of the report, published in a
daily paper, reads thusly;—“The singing of
‘Auld Lang Syne’ brought the official pro-
gramme to a termination, and the success of the
opening celebration was completed by an hour

or two spent in dancing in the Pavilion.” Now
I happened to have been at this very dance, but
I do not remember any ladies being there.
The opening of the 1887-1888 season was a
combined one of sailing and rowing, the
former under the auspices of the Brisbane
Sailing Club and the latter under those
of the Breakfast Creek Rowing Club.
This was an innovation, 1 well remember, and
did not meet with full approval.by the sailing
men. However, it was a change, probably a
welcome one to many, possibly so to the spec-
tators. Personally lam sure the amalgamation
was mainly in honour of Mr. Geo. Markwell, an
active member of the sailing club and also the
captain of the Breakfast Creek Rowing Club.
Mr. Markwell w-as, during the afternoon, pre-
sented with a beautifully illuminated address by
the Rowing Club as an expression of their
gratitude for the manner in which he had so ably
captained them as well as of their desire to show
appreciation of his manly and liberal efforts,
the presentation being made by Mr. Justice
Mein.
The usual sailing procession took place, Hon.
E. B. Forrest leading, as customary. On this
occasion nearly all the sailing craft carried
their colours at half-mast in consequence of the
death on the previous evening of Mr. W. H.
Costelloe, who had been not only a member of
27
HISTOR y of the r. q. y. c.


the Vagabond's crew, but a general favourite
amongst boating men. The sobriquet given
to Costelloe by the crew of the Vagabond was
<c the Reverend K. 7J No doubt many who read
this will remember him. lie was a genial
character and a host in himself, and many
pages could be written about him, but we have
not the space. He was the life and soul of yacht-
ing parties, especially during Easter Regattas at
Southport. Requiescat in pace.
The Brisbane Sailing Club and the Breakfast
Creek Rowing Club again held a combined open-
ing on the 4th September, 1888, for the season
1888-1889, with a rattling nor’easter blowing.
The Q.G.S. Otter, kindly lent by the Hon. B. D.
Morehead. Colonial Secretary, was the flagship,
having between two hundred and three hundred
guests on board. Amongst the new boats were
the Lotus, Dream (22ft.), Gipsy, and the J. S.
Poyen, and Wanetta. The J. S. Poyen,
which was an American craft brought here from
Sydney, was remarkably fitted with a 2 1
block of east-iron as movable ballast running
on ways athwart the boat, and hauled to wind-
ward on each tack by means of block and tackle.
This contraption was afterwards taken out of
her, possibly owing to the not remote
possibility of the boat being suddenly
taken aback or of something going wrong with
Anne led the procession. Strong comment
was made by the Press report in regard to the
HIST 0 R Y 0 I-' 1 TH B R. Q. Y. C.


want of uniformity in costume, only one boat,
the Gipsy, having her crew properly rigged out.
The dinner was held in the new shed built
by the members of the Club at the Hamilton
The speakers were Hon. E. B. Forrest, J. G.
Drake, M.L.A., W. T. Blakeney, C. B. Lilley,
C. W. Chambers, E. Markwell, and Thos.
Weisby.
Again in ISB9-1890 the opening season, day
was the same amalgamation, the Otter and the
Lucinda being the flagships, with His Excel-
lency the Governor and suite in attend-
ance. The recorder on this occasion used these
words: —“Never has a yachting season in Bris-
bane been opened under more favourable cir-
cumstances, and it will be the ardent wish of
everyone interested in boating that the summer
may bring many an afternoon as bright and as
happy as Saturday.” The day was the 7th
September, 1889.
The yachts were more numerous than in the
previous year. New boats were—Hinemoa,
Thistle, Irex, Bulletin, La Belle, Mayflower,
and Midge.
The dinner was held in the new shed, Hon.
E. B. Forrest, presiding. The usual toasts
were proposed, the usual talkee took place, the
unusual “shandy-gaff ” was not partaken of, and
the report ends with these words: — 44 The pro-
ceedings were brought to a close at an early
hour.” Quite right this time. Speechifiers
HISTORY op the k. q. y. c.


were the Hod. E. B. Forrest, M. B. Gannon.
The Chairman stated that the Chib membership
totalled 335. as against 314 the previous year,
arid that the prize money had not been large, as
the committee had practised economy in racing
and had spent more money on the Club Shed.
Other speakers were J. F. G. Poxton, M.L.A.,
W. T. Blakeney, Geo. Markwell, and some of
the smaller fry.
So the seasons go on, and we come to the flood
year of 1893. This year’s opening was the
3rd of September. But what a sad year it had
been. Our boat shed and jetty had almost gone,
many of the boats had been terribly knocked
about; my own, the Vagabond, sank in the
Hamilton Reach, almost alongside where the
red buoy was moored for so many years. But
sailing boys and men have hearts of oak, and
the opening was successful. Mr. "W. J.
Weatherill was honorary secretary. Captain
South was in charge of the Otter, and “Mr.”
Junner was then the Otter’s chief officer. There
were the same evolutions, the same mingling of
boats, and the same merriment. Details of a
little importance give the members of the Club
as being only eighty, but surely there is a
mistake somewhere. I And there were forty-
seven boats on the roll, but only three or four
had made the Club shed their permanent
headquarters. Also “that Sir Henry Nor-
man had for the fourth time given £lO for
racing prizes, and had likewise donated to the
30
nTST 0 R Y 0 F THE K. Q. Y. C.


Club a dozen volumes on matters of interest to
yachtsmen, collected during His Excellency’s
honoured career. The books included one
spcially valued as coming from Sir Henry’s
own pen, ‘A Governor’s Cruise in the West
Indies.’ ” lam wondering where those books
are now.
Apparently there was no evening gathering
this year, and now that I have mentioned that
I recollect there was a break for many years
in the holding of dinners. The year 1893 saw
my home first erected at New Farm, and it was
my annual custom on opening days to give my
crew a spread with some vintage, such as was
wanted, with Barney Phillips as caterer. There
were also a few, but not many, other friends
present at these functions; needless to say
they always terminated “at an early hour.”
Looking over the name of boats cruising this
opening day in September, 1893, I find the fol-
lowing as making their first appearance. (Re-
member, some of them may have been on the
river, either cruising or sailing at an earlier
year). The names are Thelma, Tarakoo,
Clyanthus, Caneebie, Grace, Gladys, Pepita,
Cupid, Rival, Petrel, Mary C., and Mr. R.
Dickson’s steam yacht Scylla.
Season 1894-1895 saw the opening on the 15th
September, 1894, the G.G.S. Miner being present
with the Governor and Lady Norman on board,
also Miss Noman, Hon. A. S. Cowley, Hon. H.
Tozer, and Dr. Thomson, the flagship being the
31
HISTORY OF TH £ R. Q. Y. C.


Otter. Let me give an extract from the re-
port published on the Monday:—“No doubt the
intercolonial races of last season have given an
impetus to the sport in Brisbane. The parade
on Saturday included all the veterans of yacht
racing in this port, and some trying their can-
vas for the first time this season. When the
flagship anchored opposite the old Ice Works the
water was simply alive with craft of all sorts
and sizes, and the picture was one to gladden
the heart of any yachtsman.”
The report also refers to the sending of boats
(22 footers) to Sydney. Herewith a few
notes: —“Brisbane is at present under the dis-
advantage of having no purely local boats of
sufficient merit to stand a fair chance against the
Sydney boats, and Mr. R. Hamilton, with a view
to overcoming the difficulty, endeavoured, and
that successfully, to obtain a new boat.” (The
boat was named the Lady Norman, and I was
one of the syndicate). She sailed in Sydney
in 1895 and came in seventh, but was the first
of the Queensland boats in the race.
Speaking from memory and from amongst the
names before me, I think the following were the
new boats to come out this opening season of
18.94-18.95:—Wynella, Hibiscus, Colarmi, Auric
and Spray—a 25 footer.
Season 1895-1896 was opened on September
14th, 1895, the Governor attending with many
friends on the Lucinda. There was no
dinner and most of the boats made for King
II IST O E Y O P THE R. Q. Y. C.


Island, after the manoeuvres, for the usual week-
end blow. New boats—at least new as far as
attending the procession goes—were Ellen,
Viking, Gondolier, Alcestes, Bohemian, Ida,
Boomerang, Bluette, Campsey-Glen, Coralie,
Bady Norman, Spider, Vendetta, Waratah,
Eenobia, Era, Calluna, La Cigale, Nell, Satanita,
Veruna, Raceland, Beatrice, Vera.
The 1896-1897 opening was held on September
the sth, and was of much importance so far
as guests and visitors generally were concerned.
Lord Lamington was present as our patron for
the first time, whilst distinguished company gave
us the following:—Sir Samuel and Lady Griffith,
Sir Charles and Lady Lilley, Hon. J. S.
Turner, Hon. A. S. Cowley, Hon. Robert
Philp, Hon. B. D. Morehead, Hon. D. H. Dai-
ryrople, and the Hon. A. H. Barlow, ail
these honourables being accompanied by their
good ladies. In fact, looking down the list of those
present I much doubt if ever our Club saw a
gathering of guests of so much importance. The
report does not say if any of the honourables
gave any cups or prizes to the Club for racing
purposes. New boats—Victoria, Fanny, La-
vonia, Galatea, Dolly Varden.
Again, no dinner.
Season IS9S-1899 gave the honour to Satur-
day, the 17th September, the Otter being the
flagship with the usual galaxy of high-titled
and honourable personages, together with their
good ladies and charming marriageable daugh-
history op th e b. q. y. c.


ters. The Harriette Anne led the pro-
cession with our good friend and loving Club
companion. Archie Douglas, as Commodore, in
charge. Lord Lamington and Sir Samuel
Griffith were on board the Lucinda. A new
boat, owned by the Vice-Commodore, Mr. C.
Lilley and Mr. E. Cullen, named the Marama,
was having her first spin. The launches
Mabel. Undine, Ariel, and Pet were
also cruising about during the afternoon with
private parties on board. The Dolly
Varden, a new 16 footer, owned by Mr. B.
Marshall, came in for special observation on
account of being ‘'manned” by four ladies, one
of whom was skipper, the crew all being in
sailor costume, and spoken of as the first lady
crew to sail in Brisbane boating waters. It is
also pleasing to note and read the following:—
“At this opening more boats than previously
appeared with their crew in uniform costume,
which added greatly to the display and to the
boats’ appearance.” One is glad to read this,
for, on my honour, some of the uniforms, if you
could so call them, worn by certain of the Club
members were beyond all reason. Nowadays
in regard to uniform, not only on opening days
but on ordinary cruising trips, the question of
dress shows even a still more marked improve-
ment.
So the years run on, and we have our opening
demonstrations in much the same manner, but in
1900, ’twas the 21st day of July, an innovation
34
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


was made by having the annual meeting held
on the Miner, which anchored at Cairncross
buoy; Mr. W. A. Douglas, Commodore. For
the ensuing season Mr. James Clark was made
Commodore, and Mr. G. T. Southern Hon.
Secretary. Speaking personally, this year 1900
was the first year in which I took an active part
iu the actual official work of the Club, and an
honour was conferred upon me by making me a
committeeman. We find the membership very
small, so that the drop in numbers mentioned a
few pages back is now accounted for, for the
report gives for 1900 only a membership of
sixty-eight and thirty-three boats on the
Club’s register. So small a number of
members with so many boats shows that the Club
then was composed of good yachtsmen whose
hearts and souls were in their work. I am
sure that from the days of George Southern
taking up work as Hon. Secretary the Club pro-
gressed with a marked degree of success, and
surely now cannot go behind again.
Then comes the opening day, 27th September,
will: more now boats, viz., Juanita, Zamia,
Violet. Aurora, Beau Ideal, Trilby, Wylo,
Byanda, Evelyn.
Still no dinners. Really one is inclined to
think that so long a spell between dinners on
opening days was responsible for the falling off
in membership. There is a power of good in
a dinner, and where conviviality prevails
there is true friendship made. A business man
HISTORY OF T HE R. Q. Y. C.


—and it, is ’.veil known to be true—is better seen
in the afternoon than early in the morning, for
a full innards makes a contented mind and a
more givablc disposition. I wonder whether
if a. wedding breakfast were held prior to the
marriage it would make any difference in after
life?
Season 1901-1.902 was ushered into the sporting
boating man on the 28th September. Same old
Lucinda, same old Otter, nearly the same old
guests, same old sandwiches, and no doubt the
same old lies with a new story perhaps inter-
woven during the festive gathering. ‘‘Some
sixty or seventy white wings were seen flitting
noiselessly (?) over the smooth, waters, making
a picturesque scene, some creeping steadily
along, othei-s careering gaily with the wind, with
the gunwale almost hidden as a favourable gust
would furnish the extra amount of vim to create
a dash; and all unconsciously combining to pre-
sent a picture worth much more than a cursory
glance. ”
It reads well, does it not, dear comrades, but
what about a black sou’easter in the middle of
the Lay, and having to lower away for reefing
purposes with more than one half of your crew
fully sea-sick? Whoever wrote the report for
the daily paper from which I am quoting and
on which I am commenting, well, he wrote it
A L, and should be made a life member of the
R.Q.Y.C. This is how he concluded his re-
port:—“The one thing that sailing has felt in
HTST 0 R Y O F TH E R. Q. Y. 0


the past more than any other thing is the ab-
sence of good practical public support, and a
few such demonstrations as Saturday 's should
give it a decided impetus. ’ ’
Season 1902-1503 was a memorable one in many
respects. The Lucinda did not fab to put in
an appearance. the Otter could not do any-
thing bn! its duty seeing that Captain Alee. J.
Jnnner was in charge, and all went merry as a
marriage bed, for the Club had returned to its
senses, and the day’s eating wound up with a
Club dinner.
Fw-wy that, ye gods, a Club dinner; and as
if to shove its feelings the weather tackled us
right royally, for the heavens opened and rain
poured down in torrents, and all through the
festival of food demolishing the thunder rolled
and lightning hashed and everything really was
at sixes and sevens.
I not only remember the rain and the dinner,
but I remember how I capsized the Ida when
George Collin was on the cross trees trying to
free a throat halyard from the jaws of the gaff;
bow he smiled as he toppled over; then how the
Ida went down and left seven of us in the
Twiddle of the river; and how we nearly lost the
life of one of the crew.
And it was in this year too —1902 —in the
month of May, our Club received, through His
Excellency, the Governor, a communication that
His Majesty King Edward VII had been pleased
to confer the title of “Royal” on the Club.

The season 3903-1904 was opened on the 3rd

still the Otter graces us with her presence and
Captain Junner smiles from the bridge thereof,
whilst the steamer Greyhound is also engaged.
His Excellency Sir Herbert Chermside and suite
also do us honour, and this year—l have to write
it —for historical as well as for date requirements
—the Commodore led the procession in the
boat called the Beau Ideal. Gentlemen, the
year 1903 saw me your Commodore, and as at
that time I thanked you I now ask permission
to thank you again, also asking that if in my
duties since then I have hurt or irritated any
members’ feelings I plead “that I have shot mine
arrow o'er the house and hurt my brother.”.
Whatever I have done since then, be it for weal
or woe. has been done with my heart’s best in-
tentions and for the good of members as well
for the Club. This year we have 167 members
on the roll, an increase of 37 for the twelve
months. The register shows 52 yachts, 3 power
boats, 1 steam yacht, and 2 auxiliary schooners.
There was only a credit balance of £B/11/9 to
carry forward.
This year Mr. W. J. Weatherill—Commodore
in 1887—was elected a life member of the Club.

HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


Ten races bad been held during the previous
year, the most successful boat being the Maori,
owned by Mr. G. C. O’Beirne, and built by
Logan, New Zealand, she having won three firsts
and two seconds out of a total of five starts; the
total prize money amounting to £33 only.
This year certain debentures were issued to
enable the Committee to purchase furniture for
the new Club rooms.
Amongst the many boats in the procession,
new names appear to me as follow ; —Maori,
Minerva, Leading Light, Butterfly, Zada, Golden
Arrow. Dragon, Thanet, Trident, Fleetwing,
Atilla, Stanley, Ethel, Victoria, Sabrina,
Kelpie. Lu Lu, Trilby, Eadythe May, Flame,
Sao, Regina, not all, however, being the pro-
perty of our members. The most attractive
yacht, or rather the one most spoken of
during the afternoon, was the Peeress, cruelly
nicknamed by some facetious boating man the
“Cockroach.” She was a racing rater built
for Mr. J. "Williams, and designed by that fam-
ous American designer, Mr. C. D. Mower. She
was of a very different type to any boat on the
river. I think later on she went to Sydney to
take part in Intercolonial races there, but was
not allowed to start in any race, she being, so it
was said, of a class entirely of her own. Strange
to say, a couple of years later she was raffled, I
being the lucky wiifner, but as it required a
special crew to run her I was content with the

Holumiian) end 1 sold the Peeress to Mr. J.
Donaldson tor £25.
.In the evening the Crab held its annual
dinner in the nev>- rooms, the caterer being Mr.
nieklin.
Of ihc nineteenth season, in the year 1904-
.UK;S, the opening day was on the Ist of
October. The Lucinda, was still to the fore
with a crowded upper and lower deck, and it
was estimated that over one hundred sailing
craft attended the function. After the cus-
tom ary ('.volutions a sweepstake race for class
“one design” boats was sailed over a. short
coarse—viz., from the Hamilton down to and
••onnd Cai:Ticro'.s buoy, hack to the Lucinda,
and again round the same course. The follow-
ing gives the result:—Yera, 4hrs. 42min. BOsec;
Maud. 4hrs. 42min. 40sec; Mist, 4hrs. 42rem.

Dinner as usual. Yes, it was held in the
Club rooms, the Hon. E. B. Forrest presiding,
members being honoured by the presence of
Captain Creswell, P.N., Captain Baibler of the
Oopaek, Captain C. P. Downes, and Captain
Geo. "Wallace. The toast list was, as usual,
short and sensible—viz., “The King,” “The
Club,” “The President.” A really fine smoke
concert terminated the evening ? s gathering.

The opening of the 1906-1907 season yvas
the “Gemmg of Age” of the Club, and we
hasten to give it a welcome.
The procession took place in the Hamilton
and Follmba Reaches on the 29th September,
TOGO. The Lucinda being in dock, the Com-
mittee decided to entertain their guests on the
hist or y o e th e r. q. y. c.


fawn at Newstead, by kindly permission of the
owner. The procession for motor boats and
sailing craft respectively took place at 3.30, the
Sunbeam leading the way as a motor, with the
sailing boats under the leadership of the Rear
Commodore in the Fleetwing. After rounding
the Beaver the first time the Sunbeam broke
away and assumed the lead of the sailing craft;
the Vice-Commodore then led the motor boats
in the Amity. On the lawn at Newstead were
Lord and Lady Chelmsford, Captain Tiekell,
and others of renown and repute, the report in
one daily paper stating that His Excellency in-
speeded the Commodore s boat, the Sunbeam,
where, 1 have no doubt, he met with a hearty
and welcome reception, and drank success to
the members of the R.Q.Y.C. The annual
drnner was hold the same evening at Eschen-
ha gen’s, one hundred guests sitting down to a
suostantial repast. The toast list was short
and the greater portion of the evening devoted
to a general smoke concert.
The soiling season for 3907-1908 saw the light
on Saturday, sth November, 3907, and on this
occasion the Commodore was honoured by
carrying around the course on the Sunbeam the
very finest intellect, without exception, in
united Australia. It so happened that the
Full Court of Australia was sitting in Brisbane,
and, thanks to Mr. W. A. Douglas (our Com-
modore in 3898-3899 and in .1902 end at the
time of this opening ceremony Registrar of the
42
HISTORY Q F THE K. Q. Y. C.


Supreme Court of Queensland), the presence of
the learned Justices was secured at our opening.
We read “that amongst those present at the
opening were Sir Samuel W. Griffith, Chief
Justice, and Mrs. T. H. Brown (his daughter),
Sir Edmund Barton, Mr. Justice Isaacs, Sir
Pope Cooper, the Hon. E. B. Forrest/' and
many other notables. The venue was again the
grounds of Newstead, gaily hedagged with many
a well decorated little corner, and the Hamilton
and Bulimba reaches were covered with score
upon score of small craft. We also read —“The
Hamilton Reach is one of the natural beauty
spots of the Brisbane River, and when enhanced,
as on Saturday afternoon, by scores of sailing
craft with their white sails, one understands
more fully the great fascination of the river.
Here and there a canoe, guided by clever hands,
made its way between the larger boats, and the
inevitable smaller sharpie with the inevitable
schoolboys on board was also present. ’’ And
further on— ‘‘Momentary excitement of a mild
nature was caused by the falling overboard of
a member of the Commodore’s crow when the
Sunbeam was near the Beaver.” Now. I
wonder ivho that could have been.
It was, indeed, a glorious day. Why, the
scribe who noted detail and “wrote up” the
day’s proceedings broke into poetry in this
strain:—
Sometimes swiftly, as swallows blithe,
Skimming the ocean’s breast;
Sometimes sleeping with folded sail
7n calm and peaceful rest.
43
ffISTOBY OF THE B. Q. Y. G.


Following up the custom of some years’
standing, the Club concluded the opening cele-
bration with a dinner in the Protestant Hall,
over one hundred members being present.
“The King,” ‘‘The Club,” “The President”
were all the toasts, and then a musical
programme was indulged in, those assisting
being AYynyard Joss, E. J. Atkinson,
Percy Davis. R, V. Chapman. E. 0. Rees,
W. 11. Beattie, Geo. Webster, and the Brisbane
Banjo Club.
Did I not hint that, no note of sadness would
be in ray writing? Yes, I think so. Yet,
here I am inclined to dwell just for a moment
on time and its changes. Ars ionga, vita
brevis. Mr. Forrest, in responding to the
toast of his health, mentioned with kindly sin-
cerity that ho had sailed with good and fast
friends at Cleveland in the year 1866, but, on
looking over a record given him by me, he
found that he, Major Snelling, and the
Hon. Vdiiers Brown were the only three
left of those memorable sailing days.
And as I write I think of vita brevis,
for not only have Major Snelling and Mr.
Brown gone aloft, hut Mr. Forrest has also left
us. For nigh upon 50 years Mr. Forrest
proved himself a rare sailing enthusiast, and
the Club has done what it could to perpet-
uate his memory by having a “Forrest Cup”
placed in the rooms, which cup has been
sailed for and will be again sailed for
44
ii IST O K Y OK THE ft. Q. Y. C.


when this cruel 'war of Prussian militarism
is ended. Our worthy President well deserved
such recognition of his services, not only as an
enthusiastic yachtsman, but for all he has done
for the R.Q.Y.C. during the many years he was
connected with it.
The season of 1908-1909 was opened on the
3rd October, 1908. Newstead Point was
thronged with people, and the river, like Re-
gatta Day at Henley, was alive with craft of
various sizes. It was the yachtsman’s cere-
monial day, and he made the best of it.
“The outstanding feature of the display was
the important part taken in it by motor boats
and boats equipped with auxiliary engines, and
the number of these afloat was significant of
the change that was taking place amongst sail-
ing craft and sailing men.”
“Poor white wings,” quoth I.
The annual dinner was held in the Club
Rooms, over one hundred persons being
present, Mr. Forrest, as usual, in the
chair. During the evening one member
mentioned that a meeting of the Club
members should be called to see if they could
not get a boat built and sent down South to
take part in the second contest in connection
with the Northcote Challenge Cup. A meeting
was afterwards called, the matter was well and
thoroughly discussed, but no action was taken.
45
HIS T ORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


Now, briefly let me allude to the opening days
cl the remaining years up to 1914, the year
of the outbreak of the war.
The opening demonstration for the season
1909-1910 was held on the 2nd October, 1909,
in the Hamilton and Bulimba Reaches. The
lawn at Newstead was generously lent by Thos.
Heaslop, Esq., for the use of members and
friends. The occasion was a memorable one.
The Queensland Flying Squadron joined with
the Club, and the fleets of the two clubs made
the function a splendid success. The annual
dinner was held the same evening in the Club
Rooms, some 90 members attending.
For the year 1910-1911 the annual report
says—“ The Club’s annual opening day
evolutions were held on October Ist, 1910, in
the Hamilton Reaches, in conjunction with the
Queensland Flying Squadron, and was a highly
successful and pleasant function in every way.
A particularly good attendance of craft of all
description was secured, due, possibly, to the
change of location. It is doubtful whether a
better gathering of craft could be obtained in
the Commonwealth. The dinner was held in
the evening of the same day in the Club Rooms,,
at which some 80 members and friends sat
down. It proved an enjoyable function and
an unqualified success.”
Again for the season 1911-1912 we read—
“ The opening was a demonstration held
in conjunction with the Queensland Plying
H 1 !iTOm ; UJ: TH E R. Q. Y. C.


Squadron in the Hamilton Reach on the 30th
September, 1911. From a sailing aspect the
function was spoiled by a lack of wind, but
the large number of auxiliaries and other power
yachts that took part in it greatly helped to
enliven the scene, while socially the event was
a decided success. The annual dinner was
held on the Monday following instead of on
the same evening as the opening ceremony, and
was attended by some 60 or more members.’ ’
Season 1912-1913 is revived by “The
season* as on previous occasions, was opened
by a demonstration held in conjunction with
the Queensland Flying Squadron in the Hamil-
ton Reach, the date for the function being the
21st September, 1912, A position was obtained
on the Plarailton retaining wail in which to en-
tertain members and their friends. There was
a fine display of boats, although the wind was
light for sailing, and the function was socially
a decided success. The annual dinner was
held on the night of the opening, and was
attended by some 60 members.”
And for the year 1913-1014 the annual re-
port gives us the following:—“Complete ar-
rangements were made for what should, under
ordinary conditions, have proved a very suc-
cessful opening demonstration, the date fixed
for the function being the 27th September, 1913,
the grounds at Newstead, being kindly lent
for the occasion by Mr. Cyril Lambert. Un-
fortunately, heavy and almost constant rain
47
HIST O R y O F TH F H. Q. Y. C.


ml 1 during the afternoon and only a few boats
turned out, whilst there were scarcely any spec-
tators on shore. The annual dinner which
followed the opening was held in the Club
"Rooms, and was attended by some 50
members. ”
And so for opening days and dinners we
y/rite fims. The opening day of 1913 was the
Inst of these functions attended by our
President, Mr. Forrest. This gentleman was
on duty punctually at the hour appointed to
sail with me as Commodore in the Sunbeam, and
all the time it rained heavens hard. Mr. Forrest
was too unwell to attend the annual dinner,
and, as members know, he departed this life on
March 30th. 1914. The annual report of 1914
has the following:—“lt was with very deep
regret that your Committee heard of the death
of the President, the Hon. E. B. Forrest,
M.L.C., who was one of the first members of
the Club twenty-nine years ago; who has for
many years filled the position of your Presi-
dent, and to whom the sport of yachting in
Queensland is indebted in the past for very much
assistance. Your Committee fittingly recorded
its sense of the loss which the Club had sus-
tained, and conveyed its condolence to the re-
latives of the deceased gentleman. Steps have
also been taken to perpetuate the memory of our
late President, by establishing a cup to be com-
peted for annually under somewhat similar con-
ditions to those governing the “Amity Cup,”
aist o k y a f tn e r. q. y. c.


and donations from members are solicited in
order to make this trophy worthy of the name
with which it is to be associated.’ ’
With this I conclude my chapter on opening
days and dinners, for the year 1914 brought
about a state of affairs throughout the civil-
ised world that even we, as a minute particle of
club life in the great Empire bearing Britain’s
name, forebore to partake of amusement in such
manner as had hitherto been our custom, and
neither opening days nor dinners have been
held since the year 1913. War had been de-
clared on August 4th, 1914, and we on that date,
had resolved even then to hold our customary
demonstration, but, as shown in Chapter I, it
did not take place. So this was the last of our
opening day demonstrations, dinners, and racing
fixtures. God grant they may not be long in
coming again, for the civilised world is aweary
of the slaughter of human beings and of grim
and gruesome horror of war. But may the
victory be to those on the side of humanity and
righteousness.
May I be allowed to add this in conclusion:
I am certain that when our time comes to leave
this earthly sphere and others take our positions
in the Club, we, who will then have gone, will
not be blamed for having done our little bit
of duty even this wise—the cancelling of all
personal Club and sailing amusements until
the proper and only time was opportune.

CHAPTER III.
CLUB AND OTHER SAILING EVENTS.
A wet sheet and a flowing sea,
A wind that follows fast,
And fills the white and rustling sail,
And bends the gallant mast.
—Allan Cunningham.
There may have been sailing contests in the
year 1885, but search as I may, nothing can
be found, prior to October, 1886, of any Club
races in the Brisbane waters, so we pre-
sume 1885 became merged into 1886, and that
the latter was the year of the inaugur-
ation of boats battling against each other for
supremacy in Club races and those held under
its auspices.
The first regatta of 1886 was held on the
2nd October, the course being what was termed
the Hamilton Course, and the races were for
centre-board craft not exceeding the following
over-all measurements in their respective classes,
viz:—l6ft., 20ft., and 22ft. Captain W.
Sunners acted as starter. Mr. W. J. Morley
as umpire. We find familiar names as we read,
both of the boats and their captains, so without
50
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


writing details we give, for 2nd October, the
names of boats in each race in their order of
class and places as under: —
For 16 footers—
Pert, 16ft., Arthur Earle, 1; Snark, 16ft., Wave
Cameron, 2; Dot, 14ft., E. Midson, 3.
For 20 footers*—
Lola, 14ft., B. Earle, 1; Sabrina, 20ft., 2.
(Only two competitors).
For 22 footers—
Taipo, 22ft., T. Goodall, 1; Nyoola, 22ft., G. Mark-
well, 2; Annie S., 22ft., W. gunners, 3.
Prior to the year 1886 there had been much
racing outside Club recognition, and the South-
port Regattas, which were held annually at
Easter, had become almost an institution in
themselves The 22 footer, Nyoola, designed
and built by W. H. Golding, of Balmain,
Sydney, to the order of Mr. Geo. E. Markwell,
made her first appearance and won her maiden
race at one of the Southport Regattas. She
proved herself to be a great boat by walking
off with her race in the most convincing style.
The Nyoola was always sailed by her owner,
and earned quite a reputation for special quali-
ties, but the Taipo (a locally built craft), this
day, as will be seen from the result of the 22
footers race given above, defeated the favourite,
and her captain and crew received great cheer-
ing as she came in first. The Southport Re-
gatta of 1883 was marked by a sad fatality,
whereby three lives were lost in a terrific and
unprecedented south-east squall, which some
51
HISTORY of the b. q. y. c.


described as a tornado, that either capsized or
disabled nearly all the boats taking part in
the different races; but to this I will refer more
fully in the chapter on ‘ ‘ Aquatic Reminis-
cences.”
In the eighties, as well as in the nineties,
river racing was a great pastime, but now and
again a bay race would take place, and then
King Island was generally the terminal point.
On November the 13th, 1886, a race to King
Island was sailed, and I am inclined to think
that this was amongst the very first to this, at
that time, favoured Island. The race had been
timed to start at 2 o’clock, all boats to go off
together, but owing to a want of punctuality
and other causes, it was twelve minutes past
3 when the boats got away.
There were four races for prizes of £2 and
10/- sweepstakes—viz., for 25ft. 22ft., 20ft.,
and 18ft. boats respectively.
For the last-named only one boat, the Dot,
showed up, and there was consequently no race.
In the Lytton Reach a pretty high sea was
running, and also between the Boat Passage
and King Island, but although nearly all the
crews got a good wetting no accidents occurred
on.the way down. For the 25 footers throe
boats started, and they arrived at King Island
in the following order:—Vagabond at 5.23,
Lord Byron at 6.15, and Atlantic at 7 p.m.
I happened to be one of the crew of the Vaga-
bond.
HISTORY OF TH E R. Q. Y. 0.


In the 22ft. race the Nyoola, which made the
quickest time of any boat engaged, reached
King Island at 5.11 p.m., Annie S., at 5.1 G p.m.,
and Taipo at 5.29 p.m. We read—“ The boats
of this class not belonging to the Club were the
Vendetta, which reached the Island at 5.14, the
Yapina at 5.18, the Lassie (the new boat re-
cently built for Messrs. Lawson and others) at
5.29, and the Spec at 5.51 pm.
On the 27th November, 1886, Mr. Arthur
Earle, in the Pert, badly defeated Mr. C.
Lilley in the Midge, over the Hamilton course.
On the 12th March, 1887, a Club Handicap to
King Island took place, seven boats out of the
eight entries facing the starter —viz., Nyoola,
22ft., scratch; Yapina, 22ft., and Vagabond,
25ft., five minutes; Lola, 20ft., Siren, 20ft., 10
minutes; Pelican, 20ft., and La Belle, 18ft., 15
minutes. Yapina got the best of the start,
and at the Boat Passage led the Nyoola by five
minutes. It was almost dead low water in the
passage at the time, and this meant that the
old Devil’s Elbow had to be very carefully
negotiated. This “Devil’s Elbow” was the
bend on the northern side of the Passage
almost opposite to where the first red beacon is
now standing, and, as far as I can recollect,
was altered by the ’93 flood, the deeper water
being now towards the southern side. The
race ended in—the Nyoola 5.29., Yapina 5.82,.
Lola 5.39., Vagabond 5.45., La Belle 5.47., Siren
6.52., and Pelican at 6 pm. Allowing for the
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


handicaps, the Yapina won by two minutes, the
Nyoola being second, and the Lola, half-a-
minute astern of her, third. Several other
boats were at the Island. After the races there
was a dinner, and the evening and night are
described as having “passed off very comfort-
ably considering the weather was squally until
daylight next morning.”
On the 17th of March of the same year we
find the following boats competing, the course
being from the Hamilton to the Magazine Buoy,
thence to Breakfast Creek, back to Doughboy
Creek, down to the Red Buoj r off Caimcross’s,
and back to the Hamilton. Boats competing
were (that is, in all races without distinction
of class or winners) —Daisy, Sappho, Gitana,
Water Lily, Star, Yapina, Nyoola, Vendetta,
Spec, Rival.
What memories these named boats bring to
me, as I am sure they will to others when we
learn the names of some of the skippers. Good
men and true were they even as they are to-day.
There was Jack Whereat in the Vendetta, Ned
Clark in the Spec, Nyoola Geo. Markwell,
Yapina Harry M’Cleer.
Here is an exact copy of an advertisement
appearing during the year 1887 in a Brisbane
daily which is worth repeating. As my pen
slips along the paper I am inclined to say that
I must give the result, briefly, of the races and
cups referred to.

The report from which I quote adds: “This
was by far the best finish that has been
seen in the Brisbane waters. There was only
a period of 45 seconds between the first boat
and the last, and ail the boats were the same
size. Unfortunately, however, when the spec-
tators were congratulating themselves upon hav-
ing seen a close contest, they learned that the
result was likely to be upset by protests, one
entered by the Yapina against the Nyoola, and
another by the Vendetta against the Fiona.
Both will be referred to the Sailing Committee
to decide upon.”
The race was re-sailed, when the boats were
placed—Yapina, Vendetta, Fiona. The um-
pire, Mr. 0. B. Lilley, disqualified the Yapina.
as she was not sailed by a member of the Club,
and the Fiona took first place on time allowance.

in a boat built by Langford, of Sydney, which
had been called the Whistling .Dick down there,
but as she had the reputation of drowning a
few of her crew, he changed her name, and
during the five or six years that he owned the
Kate she was never beaten. His next boat was
the Lillian, the next the Frenchman, then the
Christine, then the Charm, then the Isabel, and
lastly the Notre Dame. That covered a period
of 27 years, during which time he bad been a
competitor or an official in every regatta that
had ever been held on the Brisbane River or
in Moreton Bay.
October of 1888 saw a race to Redland Bay
for a trophy presented by the proprietors of the
King Island Echo, nine boats starting in the
face of a howling south-easter, to thrash for
over thirty miles down to Langley’s Jetty. The
following handicaps were allowed:—lsabel, 36ft.>
scratch; Yapina, 22ft., 9 min.; Lotus, 30ft., 10
min.; Spec, 22ft., 14 min.; Fiona, 22ft., 14min.;
Rival, 22ft., 15 min.; Wannetta, 20ft., 17 min.;
Lassie, 25ft., 18 min.; Vagabond, 25ft., 20 min.;
Sabrina, 20ft., 21 min.; Dorothy, 16ft., 42 min.
Nearly ail the boats were to be sailed with limited
crews. Outside the passage the wind was a
snorter, most boats giving in, some to anchor
under the Ice of King Island, others under Green
Island. Only two boats battled right through,
HIST O K Y O F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


—the Vendetta and the Rival, the first men-
tioned passing the winning post at 8.40 p.m.,
the. Rival at 8.57 p.m.
Later in a handicap race for the Toombul
Cup, presented to the Club by M. B. Gannon,
M.L.A., seven boats competed, viz:—Wannetta,
22ft., (T. Goodall) scratch; Yapina, 22ft., (E.
M. Hart) scratch; Gipsey, 20ft, (E. H. Drury)
6 min.; Sabrina, 20ft., (J. Tolson) 6 min.;
Sylvia, IBft, (Geo. Beal) 8 min. Daisy, 16ft.,
(L. M. Bond) 9 min.; Arfoma, 16ft., (S. Beal)
9 min. Charles Liliey acted as starter and
umpire. The race resulted, allowing for handi-
caps, as under:—

On the 21st September, 1889, seven starters
in a race from the Hamilton round the old
Pile Lightship and back to Lytton faced the
starter —viz., Harriette Anne, Isabel, Wanetta,
Fiona, Puritan, Yapina, and J. S. Poyen. The
corrected times at the final placing were —
Wanetta (1), 4 hours 56 minutes; Yapina, 5.49;
and Fiona 6.14.22.
Then on the 28th October, 1889, a sailing chib
race took place from the Hamilton to Humpy-
bong, the boats finishing at this place —Bulle-
tin (1), 5.20.30; Wanetta (2) 5.38.50; Ven-
detta (3), 5.48.10. J. G. Vidgen acted as
starter, and E. M. Hart as umpire.
The next event taken in hand by the Club
was not until 10th December, 1892, when it
58
HIST 0 R Y 0 F TH E JR. Q. Y. 0.


took the form of a sealed handicap race with
limited crews, open to all sailing craft whether
on the Club’s register or not, and without any
restrictions as to length or rig. The entrance
fee was made a nominal one of 2/6, the object
being to get as large a number of boats
together as was possible, and in this con-
nection the Club’s officials had every reason
to be satisfied with their efforts, as no fewer
than 36 boats of various types and sizes, and
ranging in length from the open 18-footer to our
largest yachts entered. This was easily a record
entry, and therefore the largest fleet of boats
to start together in any one race in Brisbane
waters. The course was from the Hamilton
to Cleveland Jetty, observing the buoyed
channel down the river, thence through
the Boat Passage, keeping the Fairway Leads
at the outer end of the passage on the port hand,
thence passing out into the Bay, and “go as
you please” in the open water to Cleveland
Jetty, passing between a marked boat, to be
left on the starboard hand, and the head of
the jetty.
The race was timed to start at 1.30 o’clock
on the Saturday afternoon, and the fleet was
duly taken in hand by the starter at the ap-
pointed time, but with so many craft to get
away they were not despatched until 5 minutes
to 2, the breeze at the time being light from the
north-east. By the time, however, the fleet had
reached and entered the mouth of the Boat
59
HISTORY 0 F THE R. Q. Y. C.


Passage, the north-easter had died right away;
the aind immediately came in hard and
solid from the south-east, and blew a regular
snorter: so hard, in fact, that when the two
leading boats at this stage of the race (Mr. T.
GoodalFs Caneebie and Mr. G. MarkwelFs fine
yacht Thelmar) emerged from under the land
end of Fisherman’s Island, brought St. Helena
into sight, and got the full force of the wind,
both met with mishaps. The Caneebie,
slightly to windward and ahead of the Thelmar,
got the first welt, which carried away her peak
halliards, whilst the Thelmar almost simul-
taneously had her gaff snapped in two as
though it were a carrot. Anchors were im-
mediately pitched overboard and the damage on
both boats was smartly repaired. Caneebie,
sending a man aloft, re-rove a new peak billiard,
and Thelmar’s crew quickly fished her
broken gaff by taking her top-sail yard and
lashing it to either side of the break. Funnily
enough, both these boats carried away together
and both set sail again together. The mis-
haps left them a lot of lost ground to make up.
but both craft sailed grandly in the hard blow
and rough water, and by the time the “leads"’
at the outer end of the Boat Passage were
passed and the fleet had reached the southern
end of Green Island, Caneebie and Thel-
mar were again in the lead and fighting it
out in great style. The wind in the meantime
had increased in force until it actually
Hi BTO K Y 0 F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


whistled in the shrouds, and the sea in the open
from here down to Cleveland was a “sneezer.”
By the time, however, that Hope's Beacon was
brought abeam Caneebie had succeeded in
shaking off Thelmar and held a commanding
lead from the whole fleet, eventually crossing
the finishing line at Cleveland with the race
well in hand.
Referring to the account as contained in the
Telegraph on the following Monday. De-
cember, 1892, the reporter says:—“From
the Cleveland Jetty the sight was truly beauti-
ful. The atmosphere was very clear and every
boat as she advanced was distinguished very
plainly. Shortly before 5 o’clock the first
three boats hove in sight, the Caneebie, the
Nyoola, and the Bulletin appearing on
the horizon, and immediately after followed
the Thelmar and the Wannetta, while
behind them came the Fanny, the Harriet,
the Spider, the Cupid, and about eight
others following. Probably one-half of those
entered did not go further than King Island,
so hopeless was the task while working against
such a stiff head-wind and sea.
“The first to pass the flagboat and the head
of Cleveland Jetty was the Caneebie, at six
hours 50!/2 minutes, while quickly following in
succession came the Nyoola, the Bulletin,
the Thelmar, and the Wanetta; and these
were heartily cheered from the jetty, where
a large concourse of people had assembled
61
HIST 0R Y OF Tll K K. Q. Y. C.


tu witness the race. The Fanny, the Har-
riet, and the Spider passed the winning
post later on within a few minutes of each other.
As witnessed from the jetty there can be no
doubt that every boat that finished had been
skilfully handled, for the course was not only
long, but the weather conditions put those in
charge on their mettle to punch through (with
racing sails) in the teeth of such a heavy wind
and sea. Of the 36 boats entered about 18
reached Cleveland.
“In the evening the erews assembled at the
Cleveland Hotel, where Mr. W. J. Morley opened
the sealed handicaps, and it was found that the
order of finishing, after adjusting the times,
was Caneebie first, Nyoola second, and Wan-
etta third, and these took the first, second
and third prizes respectively. Subsequently,
however, a protest was entered by the master of
the Bulletin against the Nyoola for omitting to
take in the black buoy off Pinkenba; the protest
was sustained, and the Bulletin was given the
third place in the race. The following morning
(Sunday) Baby Bay and the Cleveland Jetty
presented a very animated appearance, a large
number of persons having arrived by train and
boats from Brisbane and from the surrounding
district, and with the large number of visitors
Cleveland was crowded and gay. ’ ’
Then for a long time races took place in the
river, occasionally to King Island and fairly
regularly to Southport, and in 1894, the month

being March, the days the 17th and 19th thereof,
we read of the first inter-colonial sailing
race for 22-footers taking place between this
State and that of New South "Wales, under the
auspices of the Club. This and other inter-
colonial races that followed will be fully dealt
with in another chapter.
On the 9th November, 1894, six boats of then
good repute, and having names which bring
back pleasant recollections, competed at the
Humpybong Regatta for prizes, £lO and £3.
The starters were Colarmi, J. Clark; Gondolier,
A Baldwin; Harriette Anne, Sir Thomas Mcll-
wraith; Isabel, R. P. Earle and G. Baynes;
Thalmar, C. J. Tripconny; and Petrel, I).
Mac Diarmid. The course was from Woody
Point Jetty round a buoy between Woody Point
and Francis Channel, thence round marked
buoy off Woody Point Jetty, round same
course a second time, and finishing between
marked boat and Woody Point Jetty, leaving
the marked boat on the starboard hand. The
boats got away from a flying start at 11.52.
The race ended Colarmi, 3.31.30: Gondolier,
4.5.0; Harriette Anne, 4.9.0; Isabel, 4.15.80;
Petrel’s time not being taken.
A few weeks later a race for the second
moiety of a donation of ten guineas given by
Sir Henry Norman took place, the course being
from the Gas Works in Bulimba Reach to
Luggage Point and back, the craft getting away
at 3.15. A real typical Queensland storm
burst over the Hamilton Reach, the rain coming
63
HISTORY 0 F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


down in torrents and the wind blowing in fierce
squalls. The rain was so thick that at times
some of the boats could not be seen at a short
distance off. The Harriette Anne, with a big
topsail set, and later on with a jib topsail, laid
over to the squalls until at times not much more
than half her deck was out of water. The
placed boats were—Colarmi, 6.13.0; Gondolier,
6.28.30; Harriette Anne, 6.39.
The first of January, 1895, tells of a race at
the Sandgate Regatta, from the Pier to Woody
Point mark, round Pile Light, and back to
Sandgate, the course being sailed over twice.
Shortly after the race had started a stiff and
ugly south-easter sprang up, the Gondolier,
Harriette Anne, Petrel, and Colarmi all being
forced to retire from the race, the latter having
carried away her topmast in the second run to
Woody Point, thus leaving Isabel and Thalmar
first and second respectively.
It will be impossible for me to tell of all races
of importance, so that if any familiar to the
reader or more impressed upon his mind are
omitted I must plead space and a desire not to
be tedious.
The sailing season, 1894-1895, was indeed,
regarded as one of the busiest from a racing
point of view that the Queensland Yacht Club
had ever experienced. There was no doubt that
the visit of the New South Wales boating men
had given a big impetus to sailing generally, for
no less than fourteen races took place during
II [ST 0 R Y 0 P THE 11. Q. Y. 0.


the season. These included three races each for
22, 18, and 16-footers, two cruising races and
one each for yachts, sharpies and punts.
Throughout there were not many good sail-
ing breezes for the racing craft, the majority
of the days being rainy and dull, notably for
the 22-footer contests as well as the yacht race.
The number of general members had largely
increased, the yachts of all descriptions number-
ing 70, prize money being over £SO. With
other outside races Mr. Whereat had proved to
be the most successful boat owner, he having
secured with the Bulletin alone £39 locally,
£3O and a valuable shield in Sydney, and with
the Vera £32/10/-, Mr. Goodall being very un-
luck}', his wins barely reaching £ls/10/-.
Now,boats built during the year under the
Club’s auspices were the Colarmi (a name aptly
formed with the first letters in the Christian
names of Mr. Jas. Clark’s three children —Colin,
Arthur, and Mildred), Lady Norman, Hibiscus,
Victoria, and Caluna. It may not bs out of
place to freshen the memories of boating men
of the year 1895 by stating that on the way
back from Sydney the Caneebie and Rose were
very severely damaged in a big gale, while the
Waihora was slightly damaged; all the boats
being well forward on the deck of a coasting
steamer.
The opening day of the Queensland Yacht
Club was held on the 14th September, Sir Henry
Wylie Norman for the fifth year in succession
65
history of the r. q. y. c.


presenting a prize. It is somewhat amusing
when scanning the circular sent out to members
intending being present on the opening day to
read the following:—‘‘Members of yacht crews
are requested to appear in Club uniform of
navy blue, failing that, white.” (How genteel
we were becoming, or had we been negligent of
dress in former years?).
The opening race for the year 1895-1896 took
place on Saturday, the 25th September, the races
being for 22-footers, the Bulletin, Caneebie,
Clyanthus and Lady Norman competing, the
Caneebie winning and beating her old opponent
the “Bully” by 1 minute 30 seconds. On the
sth October the Vera, in the 18-footer race,
beat the Truant by 2% minutes, whilst in the
16-footer race the Irene finished first at 4.56.0,
with the Pearl at 4,57.5.
Then on the 19th October a handicap race
for sharpies eventuated with nine starters, fin-
ishing times being—Comet, (F. Perry), 4.27.35;
Referee (A. Homan), 4.27.48; Niobe (H. Sar-
gent), 4.36.15.
The Emma followed the Club races on the
sth January, 1895, or as much of the racing as
took place, for a heavy storm breaking in the
River a little after 4 o’clock made racing any-
thing but pleasant.
There were seven competitors for the 22ft.
class, the Caneebie winning. Two familiar
names I must quote: Harry Prentis, one, sail-
ing the Waihora, and Peter Wood, the Lady

Norman, this boat having the bad luck to buckle
her centre-board. The Bulletin, on the return
from the bottom rounding mark and when just
about opening the Hamilton Reach, and with
barely any headway was struck hard on the
leeward side of the sail with a heavy gust and
capsized when well in the lead. On the run
home from the Cairncross buoy the Zenobia
also was capsized.
The 16-footers’ race resulted in a win for the
Myee, sailed by Arthur Earle.
On March 4th, 1895, a cruising race to King
Island saw eleven boats competing under a sealed
handicap and with limited crews. The wind
was light, but all boats managed to complete
the course. Mr. Wave Cameron was the handi-
eapper. Result: —Gondolier, 5.6.36; Vera,
5.10.9; Nyoola, 5.12.32. The last boat arrived
at the winning line at 5.24.36, thus evidencing a
good race.
About this time the Lady Norman changed
hands and became the property of Mr. James
Clark, who was Commodore in 1895-6-7, and
again in 1900-1901.
During April a sweepstake sailing race took
place amongst the Club boats, only five boats
entering, the course being from the Toombul
Wharf down to and around the old Pile Light
and thence back to Fisherman Island Light-
house, the Petrel, Lassie and Rival finishing in
that order.
HISTORY OF TII E R. Q. Y. C.


The Southport Regatta of this year saw the.
Bulletin and Caneebie in the 22-footers J
race, the former winning. The Caneebie
first of all carried away the jaws of her gaff
and later on lost her jib halyard. How often
in those days, aye, and even in these days, has
it been argued as to which was the better boat
and which the better master. lam not writing
to give any opinion, but in Club rooms and at
regattas how often have I heard the question
discussed? They were both good boats, their
masters were good men, and it will be many a
year before the names of Jack Whereat and
Tommy Goodall will be forgotten. And to
think of it, these two famous 22-footers, Bul-
letin and Caneebie, were for many years
housed and watched and guarded long after
their class races had disappeared—to become,
shall I say it? —yes, they were only in recent
years altered considerably, and in due course
joined the noble army of “Kickers.”
On Saturday afternoon, November 2nd, 1896,
the Queensland Yacht Club tendered their fare-
well regatta to His Excellency, Sir Henry Wylie
Norman, in the Hamilton Beach. There were
seven races during the afternoon, with thirty-
three competing boats in all, the day being
everything that could be desired with a strong
wind from the nor ’-nor’-east. Briefly, the
results were as follows;

The Humpyboi}g Regatta of this year, held

a real strong south-easter with a heavy sea
running, defeat the Caneebie by three min-
utes, the old rivals 'Whereat and Goodal] being
respectively in charge. This day, with its wind,
proved disastrous to many boats, the Zenobia,
Bulletin, and Caneebie having minor mishaps,
whilst there were several capsizes and many
boats had to run to Cabbage Tree Creek and

HIST 0K Y OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


there anchor until the weather abated. The
Waihora and Irene became swamped during
the night.
Still Vvc refer to the Bulletin and the
Caneebie, for on Saturday, the 16th Novem-
ber, 1895, a 22-footer race took place under
Club's auspices in the Brisbane River, there
being four good contestants in the match—viz.,
the Bulletin, Caneebie, Lady Norman and Ettie,
the respective skippers being J. "Whereat, T.
Goodall, S. Sanberg, and Jim Clark. The
winning post was passed as follows: —Bulletin,
4.47.0; Lady Norman, 4.49.50; Caneebie, 4.49.55;
Ettie, 4.50.58. The race was regarded by the
knowing fraternity as the best of the season so
far, the Bulletin, so report sayeth, by her score
this time making her third win in a fortnight,
regarded in sporting parlance as the hat trick,
and with £2O of prize money thrown in.
On the 30th November we find the 18-footers*
race going to the Vera, sailed by Sanberg,
with the Truant and Britannia some two
and four minutes behind respectively. The
Arfoma won the 16-footers.
On Saturday, the 21st December, the Colarmi
(James Clark) defeated the Harriette Anne by
25 minutes over the down river course, the
latter boat, unfortunately, carrying away her
galf just after rounding the red buoy off the
Boat Passage.
Monday night, the 23rd December, saw the
official reception of the crews of the Sydney

boats which had come up to compete in the
Inter-colonial Sailing Carnival, the Hon. B. B.
Forrest presiding. Other speakers were James
Clark, P. J. Donovan, Fitzsimmons and Kinna-
irtont.
On Saturday, the 18th January, 1896, a boat
not much hoard of —her name, the Chicqueta —
defeated the Auric and Nyoola in a cruising
race to the Powder Magazine and back, seven
boats starting.
On the Ist February, we find four well
known 22-footers coming in as follows —the
course being the usual Hamilton Reach one: —
Caneebie, 5.11.10; Ettie, 5.12.25; Bulletin,
5.13.0; Lady Norman, 5,17.10. The Zenobia
fouled the Magazine Buoy and did not finish.
On the Bth of February in the same year the
City of Brisbane Sailing Club held handicap
races for 22-footers and 18-footers in the Milton
Reach. Four boats entered for the 22-footers,
but the Bulletin was not among them. Opinions
varied at the time, but it was averred by some
that Whereat objected to handicap races for
this class of boat, although the Vera (owned by
him) was entered in the 18-footers, but was
sailed by Sanberg. The handicaps were:—
Caneebie scratch, Ettie half-a-minute, Zenobia
5 minutes, Hibiscus 4 minutes, the respective
skippers being T. Goodall, W. C. Wain, W.
Slawson and W. Spring. Finishing times were
—Zenobia, 4.2.49; Caneebie, 4.8.45; Ettie,
4.9.2. Mat Colclough was handicapper.

March 7th saw the Britannia, sailed by
Arthur Earle, defeat the Vera by 30 seconds
only over the Hamilton course, the Daisy, a
16-footer, sailed by Reg. Hookings, scoring
against the Arfoma and Irene.
The last race, for sharpies, took place on the
14th March over the Hamilton course, there
being six starters, the Niobe (Gi McNieby), a
16-footer, winning.
On the 28th March the last handicap cruisers’
race was sailed, and the reading of the follow-

HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


The opening race of our Club was on date
October 3rd, and for the 22-footers' this is how
the three first boats came over the winning
mark: —Caneebie, 5.33.12; Bulletin, 5.34,32;
Ettie, 5.37.10. The wind was very heavy from
the south-east, with nasty squalls.
The handicap 22-footer race under the auspices
of the City of Brisbane Sailing Club, held on the
10th October, was a race of mishaps, the Zenobia
and Caneebie coming to grief and the Ettie
capsizing. The Mary (Glen Beal) came in first.
In November of this year the Hinemoa, at one
time the property of Mr. W. J. WeatherUl, went
ashore at Dunwich and came to a sad ending.
Mr. Weatherill at this time owned a new craft,
a peculiar shaped sharpie, of American style,
and gunter rigged.
At the Humpybong Regatta, held in November,
the windward rounding mark could not be
found by some of the boats owing to the heavy
sea running. The Bulletin came in first in the
22-footer race, defeating the Zenobia. The
Caneebie, having failed to find the right buoy,
retired. The Bulletin having rounded a wrong
mark, the Zenobia was declared the winner.
Half a gale blew almost throughout the whole
day.
A race in November, in the Milton Reach,
under the heading 22-footer Championship, we
find resulted—Bulletin, 5.27.12; Caneebie,
5.33.58; Zenobia, 5.38.24.

Roach —Bulletin, 5.57.15; Caneebie, 5.57.27;
Ettie, 6.1.15. The race went to the Caneebie
on a foul from the “Bully.” Then again on
the 12th. December—Britannia, 4-1.42; Vera,
5.5.11; Satanita, 5.6.56.
IVhat days of 22-footers these years were, and
how the Bulletin and Caneebie battled
against each other. They had another go on
the Boxing Day of 1896 at the Cleveland Re-
gatta, the result being—Bulletin, 3.51.12; Can-
eebie, 3.56.2; the day and wind being in every
way favourable. The Britannia was first in
the 18-footers at 4.5.15, Vera with 4.13.45,
and Satanita 4.21.0.
The Sandgate Regatta of New Year’s Day,
1887, has on record: 22-footers—Bulletin,
2.51.15; Caneebie, 2.52.5; Zenobia, 2.57.0;
18-footers—Britannia, 2.29.54; Vera, 2.30.19;
Satanita, 2.31-50.
As I seek, gather, and obtain information and
write as I am perforce compelled to write, be-
fore the days of 22-footers fall away into dim
memory, I am now thinking my readers will
be getting awearied, but here goes again,
speaking of those real racing craft.
On Saturday, the 9th January, 1897, the City
of Brisbane Club saw the following result in
Milton Reach:—Bulletin, 4.58.57; Caneebie,
4.58.58; Ettie, 4.59.3; Nyoola, 4.0.35. Just
think—what a race—only one second between
first and second! It will do you good to look

up the files of the Conner of Monday, January
11th. 1897. and read the full account.
Early in 1897 Mr. James Clark, the Com-
modore of our Club, returned from a voyage
to the “old country” and on Saturday, the 13th
February, a "Welcome Home” afternoon was
given, hiru by the members. The s.s. “Natone”
bad been engaged as flagship for the day, and
during the passage from town to the Hamilton
a very hearty welcome was given Mr. Clark in
the cabin, the Hon. E. B. Forresst speaking on
behalf of members.
The Haters Race resulted:—Australia, M.
Colclough, 1: Wanetta, R. Hoc-kings, 2; Waihora,
G. H. Collin, 3.
From February we pass on to April and find
the Bulletin and Caneebie beaten by the Stanley
at the Southport Easter Regatta, Harry
Prentis —peace to his ashes —sailing the winner.
During the race the Nyoola capsized.
For the closing races of the season for our
Club on Saturday, the 27th March, most of the
prizes had been donated by His Excellency Lord
Lamington, who was on board the Colarmi
with the Commodore, Mr. Clark; a very light
wind prevailing. The Caneebie won the 22-
footers’ race, with the Ettie second. The Aus-
tralian won the raters’ event.
At the Annual Meeting of the Club held on
Monday, the 19th July, Mr. Weatherill retired
from the position of Hon. Secretary and was
elected to the position of Vice-Commodore.

HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


After giving this last date —viz., 19th July—
there is unfortunately a hiatus, which owing to
absence of data, cannot be properly filled.
There is, however, certain matter available, and
now before me, from which I can obtain some-
thing of interest, and maybe of importance, but
whatever may have happened during this most
certain “hiatus” and not recorded must not be
blamed upon poor simple me.
A very dilapidated and knocked-about agenda
book, found amongst archives that should have
been better stored, gives the following inform-
ation, the date being 28th July, 1897, W. J.
Weatherili in the chair:—
Decided that races be held during the season on ebb
tide Saturdays up to the month of November, and
from December onwards on flood tide days, the fixtures
being—
2nd October —Ist race —22, 16 and 12-footers.
30th October —2nd race —raters, 12-footers and
sharpies.
27th November —3rd race—22, 16 and 12-footers.
18th December —4th race—raters, 12-footers and
sharpies.
15th January, ’98 —sth race—22, 16 and 12-footers.
19th January, ? 98 —6th race — 18-footers and
sharpies.
It was also resolved io hold a Yacht Club Ball on
the 20th August.
If any reader is desirous to know how the
above races went off 1 must refer him to the
daily files of papers existent in the year 1898.
T don’t suppose any member will really and ac-
tually do that, but this having been a free and
unenlightened country about that date, there is
nothing to prevent bins in searching if he cares
to do so.
HIBT 0 ii Y 0 F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


Getting again into stride in reference to sail-
ing events generally, wo arrive at the 24th Sep-
tember, 1898, and find the Zana winning the
22-footer race in the Milton Reach. On the
13th October, 1898, we have: Victoria, 4,31.53;
Zana, 4.34.1; Nyoola, 4.36.17, the finishing times
of the 22-footers’ race. The Nyoola and Can-
eebie capsized after crossing the line. The
Bulletin was not entered. The 18-footers’ went
to the Vera, and the raters’ to the Gondolier.
The Humpybong Regatta of this year saw the
22-footer race go to the Stanley, the Caneehie
being unable to compete on account of having
broken her bobstay whilst beating down the
cutting near the Pile Light, while Bulletin was
not entered on account of being blocked in the
owner’s shed. The Gondolier won the rater
contests.
How tersely reads the following:—
In the 18-footers’ raco on Wednesday at the Humpy-
bong Regatta the owner of the Satanita on finish-
ing claimed that his boat had been fouled at the start
by the Britannia. On Thursday a protest was
lodged with the umpire, Hon. E. B. Forrest, M.L.G.,
and through the courtesy of that gentleman we are
enabled to publish his decision, which is final;—
: 1 Protest not in accordance with the rule 24, sec. 85
of the Queensland Yacht Club Buies. Apart altogether
from the informality I decline to entertain the pro-
test. The start came under my close personal ob-
servation. The facts are not correctly set out in the
protest. Disallowed. —E. B. Forrest, 11 November,
1898.”
Is not the decision characteristic of our late
President?
77
history of the r. q. y. g.


A light wind prevailed on Saturday, the 26th
November, when the Victoria defeated the Can-
eebie and Nyoola in the 22-footers’ race, the
18-footers’ going to the Britannia, and the raters’
to the Gondolier, the Ida finishing 19 seconds
behind. On the Ist December the Victoria and
Britannia were victorious in the 22-footer and
18-footer races respectively, the Gondolier again
winning the raters’, this being her fourth suc-
cessive win. Jack Carey was in command.
The Sandgate Regatta of the Ist January,
1899, disclosed that for the 22-footers’, 18-
footers’ and raters’ respectively, the winners
were Stanley, Satanita, and Gondolier.
Apparently there was little racing for our
Club members this season, for one newspaper
reports that the programme arranged finished in
January, 1899. That being so our attention
turned to Sydney, where the 22-footer champion-
ships took place.
Again comes a blank as between January,
1899, and July, 1900, but we have done our best.
It is evident that matters were not organised in
proper business manner in our Club, for “Bob-
stay,” writing in April of 1899, stated—
This Club, which is our oldest body, is not as alive
as it might be, and the infusion of some “new” blood
on the Committee next season might tend to liven it
up a bit, as it has certainly got into a very dormant
state and is falling behind the younger and more pro-
gressive clubs.

“Tiller” also writes:—
Since the end of the year very little has been heard
of the Club. What should be the most alive Club ap-
pears to be about the slowest, and the members at the
annual meeting in July should see that a better set of
officials is appointed.
The first race of the season in 1900 —that is
for 22-footers —went to the Caneehie, with Irex
second, Satanita third; the Ida in Class 5 and
6 winning from the Evelyn and Gondolier.
However, on Saturday, the 15th November, the
Gondolier defeated the Ida in a similar race, the
difference in finishing times being only 30
seconds. On this same Saturday the Caneehie
again wins from the Aeolus and Nellie
Early in December of 1900 the Gondolier,
in a cruising race to Fisherman’s Island, de-
feated five other boats, and the following day
saw a club gathering at Toorbul, Bribie, when
a cricket match took place during the day and
a smoke concert came off in the evening. The
following day the return voyage home was made
a race to the Pile Light, the Gondolier com-
ing in first (1.34.30) and Viking (1.37.44)
second. Corrected time (according to handi-
caps) gave the race to Viking, G. C. O’Beirne.
In February, 1901, the racing took the form of
miscellaneous boats, the 22-footers dropping out.
In Class 3 to 5 the Gondolier defeated the
Boomerang and Viking. In this same class
on the 23rd of February, the Zamia (Frank
Illidge) came in first well ahead of the Gon-

HISTOKY 0 F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


duller, Viking and Boomerang. In September
of this year a presentation was made to Mr.
James Clark.
The 26th October saw a general handicap race,
the Gondolier (sailed by A. Baldwin) defeating
the Maori, Ida, Satanita and others.
The Maori scored a win on the 2nd November
against the Zamia, Whisper and Satanita, and
again on the 30th November in a race under
Classes 2to 5 defeated the same boats. But on
the 14th December the Zamia sailed away from
the boats already named and from the Gondolier,
winning by almost ten minutes. The last
Saturday of this year a race for 14-footers,
scratch, in the Hamilton Reach, saw the placed
boats as—Violet, Irex, Queenslander.
The Club held its first race in 1902 in Feb-
ruary, and in Classes 2 to 5 the Satanita wins,
with Maori and Gondolier second and third, the
Violet winning in Class 1.
Very little racing indeed was done this year.
On the 15th March the Annual Cruising Race
took place with all classes eligible to compete—
Rear-Commodore 0 ’Beirne offering a cup for
competition. Two events took place, the first
to the mouth of the river, and the second from
Bribie homeward to the File Light. The Ida,
Clyanthus and Gondolier finished respectively
in order for the river contest. A cricket match
and concert in the evening was the next day’s
order of enjoyment. The race home resulted
in the Ida coming in first with the Bill Nye
and Kelpie close at heel.
HISTORY 0 F TH B R. Q. Y. C.


A precis of the year’s racing now before me
gives the Violet five starts and five wins, but
who of my readers does not know the Violet
and its late lamented and highly respected
skipper (Charlie Crouch) f
The Club’s opening race for October, 1902,
took the form of a General Handicap Race, the
Othello just winning from the Violet. In
November the Maori defeats the Satanita and
Eileen, and the Violet, the Iduna, and LuLu;
while in December in Classes 3 and 4 the Maori
won from the same boats again, the old-timer
and general favourite, Gondolier, coming in
first in the unclassified boats against the Octavia
and Marama.
In January, of 1903, in unclassified boat
racing, we find new names as competitors such
as Fleetwing, Dragon, and others the Ida
winning from the Octavia and Pleetwing on the
17th March mentioned.
On the 31st January, 1903, Class Races 3 and
4 give the winner as Satanita 11, with Maori
second. Class 1 gives Thistle a win from the
Violet and Othello.
On the 14th February the Maori had a good
win from six other well known boats —the
Fleetwing being second.
The first race for the season 1903-1904 was
held in October of 1903, the event being a general
handicap. The Peeress (with Arthur Earle
at the tiller) won with ease. It would take
up too much time and space to describe this boat,
fl IST O R Y O F THE It Q. Y. C.


but boating members of our Club in this year
will remember her well. She was christened the
“Cockroach’ ’ by some admirers, hut she could
sail! By-the-way, during Brisbane’s big year of
dengue fever, whilst I was ill in bed, a friend of
mine threw for me and won her in a raffle.
She was no good to me, seeing that I owned the
Bohemian about this time, so I sold her for £25
to Mr. J. C. Donaldson, of the Soap Works.
It was somewhere about this time that our
first “One-Design” boats came into prominence.
The first lot of boats of exactly the same
design which raced for the first time this
season, were five in number. They were 18ft.
long with a 6ft. beam, and were built by J. H,
Whereat from an American design by C. D.
Mower. These craft, all owned by the builder,
were let to anyone wanting them for racing or
other purposes. They were the means of pro-
viding a fine series of scratch events lasting
over three seasons, but were eventually sold to
persons who took them away from Brisbane.
Early in the 1909-10 season the Club adopted a
“one-design” class (22ft. by 6ft. beam) by
Linton Hope. Three were ordered, but
Whereat, who had the job, built five altogether
on the stocks.
On the sth October a race In the Hamilton
Reach amongst these “One Designers” gave the
following:—Maud, 5.3.50; Mist, 5.4.25; Vera,
5.4.30; Hera, 5.6.25; Wa Wa, 5.6.50.
82
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


In January. 1904, in the same class the Hera
won from the Mist; and in a race for Classes 2
to 5 the Portia won from the Satanita 11,
Dragon and Maori second and third respectively.
In February a general handicap took place,
with fourteen starters —ranging from the Iduna,
10ft., scratch, to the Peeress, 24ft. Bin., 37 min-
utes behind. The course was the usual Hamil-
ton Reach stretch, with a slight variation by
going back to and around the Cairncross buoy.
Bear in mind the two handicap times mentioned
and note the finish: —Peeress, 5.21.30; Eileen,
5.26.20; Zamia, 5.30.20: Maori, 5.34.0. Com-
ment on the sailing powers of this self-same
Peeress is not required when the above finishing
times are quietly considered. We read—“ The
way she (Peeress) disposed of one after another
opponent called forth admiration from those
on the flagship. In the hard puffs she seemed
literally to fly along, and neither the rough nor
smooth water made any difference to her.”
St. Patrick’s Day of 1904 saw a general han-
dicap race in Moreton Bay. the course being laid
over a distance of 20 miles—starting from the
Pile Light, thence 10 miles dead to windward to
a buoy off Moreton Island, thence back and fin-
ishing at starting point. The weather was
perfect, but rather too calm for good racing.
This race I may perhaps be allowed to name
as “the Bay Race,” for the prizes were—cash
£25, £lO, £6 and £4. The entries were large—
-23, I think, in all. The Caneebie, after lying

in her shed for over four years, was again put
into commission for this special race. The
event was open to all boats and was not therefore
exclusively a Club matter, although sailed under
its auspices and management generally. An
unfortunate occurrence caused the race to be
re-sailed. According to the printed programme,
boats were to round “Mark boat and buoy on
starboard,” this mark being almost abreast of
the Upper Sand Hills on Moreton Island. The
Caneebie, having the lead, followed by the
Spider, rounded only the buoy and not the boat,
the Undine, which should have been fastened
to the buoy, having become separated from it.
Gondolier and Peeress on nearing the rounding
spot appeared likely to do the same thing, but
evidently being informed by those on the steamer
(the Undine), they hauled their wind and
rounded both the buoy and the Undine, which
was acting as the boat mentioned in the pro-
gramme. The finishing times were:—
It will therefore be seen that the Caneebie
won the event by six minutes, but through the
regrettable incident mentioned the race was
ordered to be re-sailed, the Manly coming m

with Eileen,, Satan ita II and Gondolier follow -
ing. The Cr.neebie unfcwtuimtely hr oh e her
mast shortly after the start. I always held,
and still hold, that the race should have gone
to the Caneebie in the first instance, for the
officials on the Undine admitted that they had
made a mistake in mooring away from the buoy
when it was first put overboard, it being gener-
ally understood that the steamer and the buoy
were to be as one, the buoy being the rounding
mark the steamer merely being an object easily-
seen at a distance, when a buoy could not
be picked up. Had not some officious in-
dividual called out from the Undine, ail compet-
ing boats 'would have rounded the buoy, as did
the first two leading boats (and they were per-
fectly in order in doing so), and nothing would
have been said. I was a contributor to the
prize money, but naturally, not being on the Sail-
ing Committee, had no official say in the pro-
test decision, though I voiced my opinion very
openly in the Club Rooms.
The first race of the season 1904-5 took place
on the 6th October, 1904, in the Hamilton Reach,
the event being a genera] handicap for all Club
beats. There were fifteen starters, including
the Peeress, but this marvel turned turtle
shortly after the start of the race, the placed
boats turning up in the Mist, Maud, Portia.
On the 14th November the ‘‘One Designers''
Race resulted—Mist, Maud, Hera; Class 2
giving Portia, Maori, Satanita. In December
HIST 0 K y 0 F TH K R. Q. Y. C.


the Violet, Rose and Queenslander were the
placed boats in the 14-footer class; while the
Maori won the General Handicap Race.
In February of 1905, the season opened with
a general handicap over the usual Hamilton
Reach course. There were IB starters—the
Maori being scratch, and the Peeress 30 minutes
behind. The result was Dragon, Maud, Portia.
And now we hie away over the space of a few
months, passing opening days on our starboard
side and the annual dinner on our port, running
all the time with a free sheet, blue sky, and con-
tented and clear conscience, until we see the
starter’s flag hoisted for the first race of season
1905-1906 and the afternoon, the day that of the
Centenary of Trafalgar, the 21st October. That
day—all day—l was busy preparing the Club
Rooms for the evening’s celebration, but
evidence before me now tells of the afternoon’s
racing on the river. To celebrate Nelson’s
great victory the Club held a General Handicap
for all boats. 24 nominating and all save six
crossing the starter’s line for the contest. The
trophies were donated, the donors, respectively,
being Messrs. S. W. Cameron, J. B. Arthur and
A. H. Clark. Result: —Dragon, 5.29.48; Maori,
5.33.34; Maud, 5.85.39. It was a great after-
noon, but the evening was the piece de resistance
—a Trafalgar Night in the Club Rooms; this
to be referred to later on.
On the 4th November, 1905, a “One Design”

Reach, the course a triangular one and measuring
one and a-half miles, the event run in three
heats and a final, the first of each heat and
the two best seconds qualifying for the final.
The competition was really one between skippers,
who sometimes changed boats in the different
heats. The lateness of the hour precluded the
final being sailed, and the contest was never
finally decided. The winners in the first
three heats respectively were:—A. E. Gibson, in
the Maud, V. Campbell, also in the Maud, and
J. H. Whereat, in the Mist.
On the 25th November the Wa-Wa, sailed
by Jack Whereat, outdistanced four other
similarly built boats, while the Othello beat the
Violet in the 14-footers.
December 16th gave a win to the Dragon 11,
15 boats having entered for the general handicap.
January of New Year 1906 opened with a
race for 14-footers and a general handicap for
erasers. Violet I and Violet II entered for
the first, but Violet No. 1 did not start and
Violet II sailed the course alone. Six boats
entered for the cruising handicap, the Fleetwing
winning from the Bohemian (late Beau Ideal),
sailed by W. A. Douglas. February the 10th
—the Club completed its competitions for the
season so far as river sailing was concerned,
the race being a general handicap for all boats
belonging to members of the Club (a record
entry being received), and the Mavis winning
from the Portia and Dragon.

H I STO RY OF THE R. Q. Y. G.


Toe year .1906 saw, on October 11th, a general
handicap for all Clubs, and the first race under
the Club’s auspices of motor boats, the winner
of the first contest named being Bohemian
(Mr. (4. C. O’Beirne). Viola and Eileen coming
in second and third respectively. Nineteen boats
entered and started for the motor ‘race,
the Wanderer (11. Perry) being scratch and the
Shiela (F. 0, Hamilton and F. Bestie) 50 min-
utes behind. The winner turned up in the
Nami, with Doris and Norma second and third..
The year 1906 may be stated as the starting
point of motor craft racing, whether auxiliary
or otherwise, and—say it softly and in sorrow-
ful tones—the decadence of sailing craft. What
did Ophelia exclaim —
Woe is me to have seen what I have seen,
Sea what I see!
And so say I. In this year I can name the fol-
lowing motor craft: —Quinphos, Sunbeam,
Amity, Wanderer, Erica, Dora, Wilga, Marama,
Shiela, Ivianna. Goomai, Nami, Brenda, Yvette,
La Sonnette, Dixie, Airlie, Vendetta, Balmoral,
Mamie, Old Sport, Electra, Echo, Pevcrill,
Norma, Doris, Evelyn.
October of 190? saw three races run simul-
taneously over the same course, the Eileen
winning the heavy class, Dragon II the light
class, and the Old Sport the motor boat
race. The cruiser race for coppered yachts (at
least half decked with fixed house, carrying all
camping gear, dunnage, etc., and dingy) from
-i ! s 0H y OF TRK R. ,Q. Y. C.


the Hamilton to King Island, resulted in Fleet-
wing, Eileen, and Nara being the placed boats.
December contests consisted of a general han-
dicap and an auxiliary yacht handicap, the
Fleetwing defeating the Kara for the first, my
own craft, the Sunbeam, coming in first for the
second event.
Here again we have a* slight blank, but my
memory tells me that very little racing took
place this year, so we make no ado, but think
hard, saw wood, and say nothing.
I find a scrap and memoranda book of the
year ISOS, bearing evidence of the writing and
keeping by that good old-time yachtsman, J.
G. Vidgen, and write accordingly therefrom.
Early in January of 1908, Satanita II ran away
from the Federal and Viola in the Light Yacht
Race, the Thalia winning the Heavy Class.
The Cruising Race to King Island on the 25th
January, 1908, gives the Mavis winning from
the Thalia and Fleetwing. And from an ad-
vertisement I gather that the season 1907-1908
was to have been wound up by a Bay Race on St.
Patrick’s Day for yachts measuring 18ft. water-
line and over, sails to consist of mainsail, jib,
and spinnaker, the latter to be used as a balooner
or vise versa, no other sails to be used; the course
from King Island round black buoy olf Cleve-

of this race, for minute-book of 13th April, 1908,
page 75, has thereon words thusly:—
THB BAY RACE. —Owing to the flood, this race was
postponed, and on the question of sailing it later on
it was unanimously agreed to abandon it altogether for
the season, and the Treasurer was authorised to refund
entrance fees.,
Looking at the annual report under date 29th
June, 1908, we read:—
The Club J s sailing yachts were re-classified —heavy
and light classes —and it was anticipated that this in-
novation, coupled with the fact that many valuable
trophies and substantial prizes were offered, would in-
duce keener competition than had iatteriy been shown.
This anticipation, however, was only partially realised.
So there you are for the season’s racing from
one point of view!
Turning once more to a scrap-book, ill and
badjy kept, but keeping my eye on a minute-
book as well us other books of reference, we sail
along the path of passing months of winter,
with no wind for racing or pleasure sailing
until wo come to October of 1908, the day
the 26th.
First wo have Heavy Glass Yachts with five
starters, the order of passing the winning post
being Mavis, Thalia, Corinne; the Light Class
contest going to the Lu Lu, with Dragon second.
The Motor Boat race resulted in the first being
the Penguin. November programme consisted
of Heavy Class, Light Class, and motor boat
events, the Thalia, Federal, and Coo Goo win-
ning respectively.

The December Saturday afternoon contests
took place in squally and heavy weather, the
strong breeze prevailing calling into exercise
all the skill and knowledge possessed by captains
and crew. The Thalia won from the Defender
in the General Handicap. Sunbeam took the
Auxiliary Race, with Zoe and Bohemian
second and third. For the Motor Boat event
the Goo Goo was declared the winner.
Now, we jump from December, 1908, to Feb-
ruary of 1909, and come to Light Class and
Heavy Class contests. Defender, Federal,
Arfoma, were placed respectively in the first
named, and Nirvana, Nara, Stanley in the
second.
Here again I meet with difficulties, for refer-
ence books in regard to the newspaper reports
are not to be found sufficient to give the par-
ticulars I would desire. There is neither
beacons nor buoys to donate a- proper course,
and the writing tide is mostly ebb. However,
as we had no Club racing since 1915 the gaps,
or haitus, will not be so very difficult for me to
fill in correctly. Methinks the minute-book
will be my best friend.
And page 140 of this book, under date Bth

riariy in the 1909-10 season the Club adopted
a one-dusign class by Linton Hope, the boats
being 22ft. in length, with a beam of 6ft. An
order was given for three of these craft to be
built, but W. J. Whereat, who received the
order, put live of them on the stocks. These
boats afforded good racing for several years, but
some of them afterwards were sold out of the
BISO’ o K Y Q F TII B K. Q. Y. C.


Club, and races for the class had to be omitted
from our programmes. Later on the Club, in
the hope of reviving the class, ordered from,
and had built by. Norman Wright, five of the
same class, which were purchased by .members
of the Club; but war conditions intervening and
crews becoming depleted through their joining
the ranks, the boats had to be disposed of. with
the result that the hoped-for revival did not
fully materialise.
Getting back to our references to the sailing
of events of the season 1909-10 we find that the
minute-hook before quoted, under date 14th
March, 1910, reports:—
Heavy Class. —Nara, Ida. Mavis.
Light Class.—Maori, Defender. Arfoma.
One-Design,—Weona, Dandy, T.W.
Motor Boat. —Teal, Aye,-ha, Venus.
On March 17th, 1910, a Bay Race took place for
coppered boats from 18ft. upwards, sails to be, for sloops
mainsail, jib and balloon jib, to be used as a spinnaker
if reouired: for two-masted boats the same sails with
the addition, of the usual foresail or jigger, and that
no other sails be used, auxiliary boats to be allowed to
compete provided engines were sealed: the course the
usual Cleveland course, starting from King Island.
Result —Ida, Nara, Maori.
This apparently ended the racing for 1909-
1910, and I cull a few words from the animal
report under date 30th June, 1910: —
During the season 23 races were held for Heavy
and Light classes, Auxiliaries, Motor-boats, and One-
Designers.
The Committee recommended that such a race —
Bay Race —be made an annual event in the Club
and that a trophy be given for competition with cash
prizes added thereto.

In this year. 1911, the first race for the
54 Amity Cup' 5 took place. I am, however,
reserving another chapter for this and the
L< Forrest Cup.”
The Annual Report reads as follows:
RACING.—The Club provided five race days during
the season, giving five races each for the Heavy, Light,
and ‘‘One Design” Classes, three races for the Auxili-
aries, and two for the Power-boats. Two cruising races
were also provided for each of the Sailing and Auxili-
ary Classes, one of which, however, had to be abandoned
on account of bad weather. As promised by him at
out last annual meeting, your Commodore, with his
usual unbounded generosity, has given the Club a hand-
some Challenge Cup, to be styled the ‘ ‘ Amity Cup, ’ ’
for competition annually for a race in the Bay, and the
heartiest thanks of the members are due to him_ and
to Messrs. L. M. Bond and C. B. Fox for their generous
donations for the first and second prizes, also to Mr.
P, P. Grimes for his special and generous donation
to this race which, with his consent your Committee
has used in providing a replica of the Cup to the
winner, and trophies for the third prize and fastest
time over the course.
The Cup was competed for on the 17th March last,
and all Club yachts —IBft. waterline and over—were de-
clared eligible. The race was sailed over the Cleveland
Course, but through want of wind was robbed of a great
deal of interest. The * 'One-Design” yachts, Macona
“T.'WC 5 , and Colarmi II secured first, second and
third places respectively. The winner was, however,
beaten for fastest time over the course by Gladys II
by eleven seconds^
The entry for this race was a splendid one and 18
boats crossed the line at the start.
Again I draw on the Club’s report and give
the following for the result of the year’s
racing:—

The season 1914-1915 is a reminder of the
present cruel war, the opening demonstration
having been done away with, as previously
recorded. The racing programme submitted
by the Committee included ten races for yachts,
eight for auxiliaries, and two for power boats.
Of the sailing and auxiliary events, three each
were in the river, four each were cruising races
to King and Peel Islands, and four were races
in the Bay—

There has been no racing since, the report of
June, 1916. reading:—
At tie first meeting (in 1915) your Committee ap-
pointed a Racing Committee, who however, on bringing
up their report, accompanied it with a suggestion, that
owing to the war situation there should be no racing,
during the season, and the suggestion was unanimously
endorsed by your Committee.
With this I say adieu to this chapter and get
now into more descriptive literature, trusting
my Club members are not awearied of my jot-
tings so far.

CHAPTER IV.
RACES FOR AMITY and FORREST CUPS.
Away, away, what nectar spray she flings about her
bow;
What diamonds flash in every splash that drips upon
my brow,
She knows she bears a soul that dares and loves the
dark, rough sea;
More sail, I cry: Let, let her fly, this Is the hour

The Amity Cup.
Outside ordinary trophies in the shape of cups
donated to, and sailed for by members of, our
Club, these two competitive cups were given for
special races, and are regarded as the sailing
events of the year. (Perhaps this should scarce
be said by me, seeing that the "Amity Cup”
was given by myself.) It was donated in the
year 1910, and up to 1915 was raced for in
Moreton Bay waters regularly every year.
It may be of some interest to the reader to
know the reason for my giving the “Amity
Cup.” It happened in this wise:—After the
sailing of the Bay race in which the Can-
eebie, as previously stated by me, was, through
101
HISTORY OP THE R. Q. Y. C.


an unfortunate blunder in connection with the
laying down and rounding of the 10-mile mark,
deprived of the race, yachtsmen who witnessed
the original race and the re-sailing thereof
were quite agreed that Moreton Bay was an
ideal place, .and otiered all the necessary facili-
ties for real yacht racing. This expression of
opinion was not only voiced by members of this
Club, but also by other yachtsmen, and I may
say here that their views exactly coincided
with my own. for I know of no finer Bay or
stretch of water (on this side of the globe)
which is so beautifully situated and admirably
adopted for such purposes. There are, for in-
stance, no high headlands to obstruct either the
force or alter the true course of the wind, nor
is there any lack of expanse or depth of water
to prevent the sea rising high enough to satisfy
the appetite of the most ardent and daring
skipper, even allowing him to be the greatest
glutton for rough water. It was, therefore,
with the full knowledge of these great facilities
which our Bay offers for yacht racing, and with
the object of inducing yachtsmen to make more
use of it, and also with a view to the encourage-
ment and advancement of real yacht racing,
that I gave the “Amity Cup,’' the lid of which
bears a replica of my one-time boat Bohemian
(late Beau Ideal).
Our Club introduced Interstate Open-boat
Racing. Let us hope it will also take the credit
of introducing Interstate Yacht Racing I
102
HISTORY 0 E THE R. Q. Y, G.


Just io-cgine seeing iudf-a-dozcn thoroughly
equipped and well-handled representative yachts,
of one design, meeting in our beautiful Bay,
doing battle for their respective States in a good
old north-easter, such as usually blows during
the summer months. What a glorious sight it
would be, and what an attractive gathering it
would bring together, not only of local yachts-
men. but yachtsmen representing the various
other States, saying nothing of the crowds of
sailing enthusiasts who always turn out in great
force to witness any event of an Interstate or
special character. A movement, therefore, in
the direction of Interstate Yacht Racing on. the
part of our Club (after the termination of the
present dreadful war—when things have become
somewhat normal) would give a great impetus
to yacht racing and sailing generally, and would
bring this Club into line with the Prince Alfred
and other large yacht clubs of the Southern
States.
If, therefore, the inauguration of the “Amity
Cup” races should lead to such a. happy result,
the writer, as Commodore of this Club, will be
more than pleased, and consider he has at least
done something to foster and maintain yacht
racing not only in this State, but also indirectly
in the other Slates of this great Commonwealth.
I gave the Cup with but one condition, and
that was it should be raced for and won by
iona fide amateurs who are members of the Royal
Queensland Yacht Club; all other conditions I
HlsT 0 R y O F TH E H. Q. V. G.


left entirely in the hands of the Committee.
These conditions were in due course prepared
and submitted to me. meeting with my full ap-
proval, and these will he found some pages
ahead. The Cup has engraved on it the season
of each race and the names of the winning boats
up to the present time. They are as follow: —
1910- Maccma
1911- Velona
1912- lona
1918-1914 Nara
1914-1915 Nara
It is to be sincerely hoped—at this time of
writing (duly, 191B)—that it will not now be
very long before the present war ends, and
let us hone most victoriously for Britain’s
just cause and the protection of civilized human-
ity, and that we may soon see further competi-
tions taking place not only for this but the
“Forrest Cup.” I purpose describing each
of tho five races for the years as mentioned
above. Let me. however, write that, thanks
to the kindly generosity of the late Mr.
R. F. Grimes, a replica of the “Amity Cup”
was promised by him for the winner of the said
Cup, such replica to become the winner’s per-
sonal possc-ssion and not of necessity to be left
In -be drib Rooms, as is the larger Cup itself.
There was some difficulty for a while as to
the most suitable time of the year for the race
to take place, as in the first place a whole day
was required, and it was intended, if possible,
that the ordinary cruising holidays should not
be interfered with. Then, again, it was so
history of the r. q. y. c.


essential, in order to ensure a good race, to hit
upon a time of the year when there was every
prospect of getting either a good north-east or
south-east breeze, so as to thoroughly test the
capabilities of the competitors and make the
race an interesting one from a spectacular point
of view.
The course decided upon was that known as
the Cleveland course—that is, starting from the
small black beacon on the north-western town
side of King Island, thence to Cleveland black
buoy, thence to the Naval Reserve buoy, and
home.
Now for the races!

All boats started together, the handicaps
being adjusted after the finish of the race, and
this system has been adopted in all races both
for this and the “Forrest Cup.”
All the boats got away to a good start at 11.30
a.m., the wind being a light east-north-easter,
giving the small, shallow boats an advantage.
And be it remembered, the race was contested
under cruising conditions with limited sail. The
Cleveland buoy was rounded by the Macona,
Gladys and “T.W.” in the order mentioned,
the wind not having in any way shifted or
altered. Then came Ida, Colarmi and De-
fender. The Naval Reserve buoy saw Gladys,
Macona, “T.W.” Colarmi, Ida, Nirvana and
Defender in this order, the wind showing a
tendency to strengthen. On the way home the
breeze became more lively, bat with nothing out
of the ordinary. The finishing times were —

The race was started in a moderate south-east
breeze over the customary course, but unfortu-

place, Cynthia, Nara, and Ailema leading, some
boats standing well out into the Bay, others
hugging the Ormiston shore, where smoother
water prevailed. Wistaria carried away some
of her gear near Wellington Point, and retired.
Nearing Cleveland a very heavy sea was run-
ning, requiring a skilful knowledge of boat
handling to keep the craft afloat.

The win of the lona was a surprise, for she
seemed to get so far behind in the work to
Cleveland as to be in a hopeless position.
I happened to be in Sydney at the time at
the Anniversay Regatta, and awaited the result
of the “Amity Cup” race. On receiving a wire
announcing the winner, I replied in friendly
terms, adding, “I trust the Cup will con-
tain, or rather hold, enough shandygaff until
my return. ’ ’ It did—at least so I was informed
on my return.

and by the time the boats reached the Cleveland

A fine south-east breeze prevailed in the Bay
for this race (the last, on account of the war).
The coarse was the usual Cleveland 15-mile
course. A good start took place, the Carissima,
Ailema, Nirvana and Nara getting across the
line together, the Velona coming next, sailing
beautifully. The Ormiston shore was worked
by the majority of the skippers. The Velona
was the first around the Cleveland buoy, at
11.29.20, then coming Nara at 11.33.35; nest
the little “one-design” class boat the Oarissima
at 11.37.40—the remainder coming along and

around almost in a bunch. The positions at
the Naval Reserve buoy remained unchanged
for the two leading yachts, the Nirvana taking
third place. Spinnakers were set on the road
home and endeavours made to reduce the handi-
cap between the leading boats, the wind by this
time having reduced in force. The order of
finish at Sing Island beacon was:—Yelena,
Nara, Nirvana, Garissima, Ailema, Cadonia,
lona, and Niobe. Deductions for handicaps
resulted in the following places being allotted: —
1 Nara 1.10.12
2 Velona 1.10.36
3 lona 1.13. 3
Messrs. Kent and Macintosh received hearty
congratulations upon their win, the Nara being
so far the most distinguished boat, having
its name on the Amity Gup with two firsts
and two thirds.
Forrest Cup.
. In the year 1914, the Club sustained a serious
loss in the death of its President, the Hon. E.
B. Forrest, who had held that office for
fourteen years. The late honorable gentle-
man was for many years a member of the Legis-
lative Council of Queensland, and resigned from
that House to contest the Brisbane North seat.
He was successful in being returned as member
for the Metropolitan constituency, which he con-
tinued to represent for many years. He was
the last President of the Club, the Executive
114
HISTORY 0 F TII B B. Q. Y. C.


of the Club having, as a token of the esteem in
which its late President was held, left the posi-
tion unfilled since his decease. The late Presi-
dent was endowed with a singularly genial
nature, and increasing age only tended to add
to the bluffness and heartiness which were his
characteristics.
The “Forrest Cup,” which is one of the
Club's principal prizes, was subscribed for by
members shortly after the death of its lamented
President, as a memento of the deceased’s con-
nection with the Club, and to perpetuate the
great regard in which he was held by the mem-
bers. Mr. Forrest was not a mere figure-head
in the Club, but took the keenest interest in
its welfare.
The Cup itself is a valuable silver cup stand-
ing on a pedestal and is enclosed in a beautiful
glass case bearing a silver tablet. It has only
been raced for once, as owing to the war no
races either in the river or bay have been con-
tested. The winner was the Ailema, on the
17th March, 1915, the course being nearly the
same as that for the “Amity Cup,” with the
addition of a stretch out to the red buoy on
the Hope Bank, outside Green Island, at the be-
ginning. The conditions also were almost
similar.

All the boats with the exception of the Mahra
got away to a first-class start, the breeze being
a hard one from the south-south-east, the tide
the top of high water. The fleet stood to-
wards the Hope buoy against a heavy sea and
wind. The Cadonia, after about a two mile
run. retired from the contest and squared away
for home. The sea increased in force, as did the
wind, and later on the example of the Cadonia
was followed by the Lotus, Ailsabel, and Ida,
the crews evidently having by this time had
enough of the continual drenching by heavy
seas.
The Ailema, which had got the best of the
start, showed out prominently when on the

weather side of Green Island, the Velona travel-
ling fast, and issuing the Ailema a good sporting
challenge. On the former tacking to weather
the Hope buoy she put the Ailema under her
lee, and stood right into the Ormiston shore to
avoid the heavy seas in the deep channel.
Ailema and Nara followed suit, the latter soon
weathering the Ailema. Nirvana and Niobe
had stood out a long way on the starboard tack
towards Stradbroke Island. On changing to
port tack the Nirvana, with apparently good
chances for a third place, squared away for
home. In short tacking along Ormiston shal-
lows the Velona while in the lead met with an
unfortunate accident to her peak halyards, and
was forced to retire, squaring away for home
under .]ib only. Much sympathy was ex-
pressed for Mr. Hart, her skipper, meeting with
this mishap when having the race well in hand.
Tins accident also robbed the race of much in-
terest, leaving the contest to one between the
Nara and Ailema, the Niobe being a great dis-
tance behind. The Nara moved well across
Raby Bay, and headed the Ailema at the Cleve-
land mark by a little over five minutes, the
times of squaring away here for the Naval
Reserve buoy being—
N *ra 1,55.55
Ailema 12.51.45
Niobe 2.15.10
Ailema, using a ballooner, had reduced Nara’s
lead by three minutes at the Naval Reserve

buoy. The Nara did not jibe going around the
buoy, but the Ailema did and gained thereby
at least fifteen seconds. The crew of the
Ailema in re-setting her balloon jib allowed
the sheet to get adrift, and in an attempt to
lower away, the sail got down into the water
and was lost. Nara, meantime, had half hoisted
her balloon jib, and with the Ailema made
splendid pace and a fine race all the way to
the finish, this being—
Nara 1.55.55
Ailema .. . . .. 1.57.38
Niobe 2.15.1 b
On adjusting the handicaps it was found that
Ailema had won by 17 seconds, the result
therefore being—
Ailema , . 2.17.38
Nara 2.17.55
Niobe 2.21.10
It was a fine hard race all through and was
an excellent test of the sailing knowledge and
prowess of skippers and crews. The captains
of the Nara, Ailema., and Niobe (Macintosh,
Capt. Collin, and D. Mactaggart, respectively,
all veterans) received hearty congratulations
at the conclusion of the race for the plucky
manner in which they stuck to their guns in
the face of such a hard blow and heavy sea.

CHAPTER V.
INTER-COLONIAL RACING.
In March, 1894, the first Inter-colonial sailing
race took place in Moreton Bay. The event,
held under the auspices of our Club, was for
22-footers, and the course was from an imagin-
ary line between the new* Cleveland Jetty and
a mark boat (the start being a flying one),
thence around the black buoy off the Naval Re-
serve bank to the northward of Feel Island;
thence round a mark buoy near the Hope
Beacon off the mainland between Cleveland
and Wellington Point, thenee round a mark
off Sandy Island, between Cleveland and
Coochee Mudlow, and back to the starting point,
a distance of about 15 miles. The race was
sailed under best and best conditions, the only
restrictions being the length. The first prize
was £3O, second £lO, third £5. As this was the
first of the Inter-colonial contests, and was
practically a test of skill in open boat sailing
between the two colonies mentioned, I deem it
right and proper to name all competitors, with
details;—

The wind was light, and all the boats came
out with large racing outfits, the mainsails of
the three Sydney boats being a tremendous
spread of canvas, and if any of my readers
want to fully understand this remark let him
but see and scan the picture of the Effie,
another well know T n Sydney crack, on the wall
of our Club Rooms.
Captain Almond was the starter, and the
Portia got away first. This craft, just
before time had expired, and with all canvas
drawing, dashed clean through everything and
crossed the starting line within a second or two
after the final gun was fired. At the Naval
Reserve buoy the time of the first three boats
were—l rex, 3.44.30. Catena 3.44.32, Bulletin

of all the boats. Off Cleveland Point the boats
had to jibe. The finish resulted —Bulletin,
5.30.10; Latona, 5.32.56; Zenobia, 5.33.10.
Then came in this order, Irex, Portia and Cly-
anthus.
Poor Ciyanthus 1 As I write at Amity Point
I remember seeing this boat a few
hours ago off King Island with a friend of mine,
Jack Connors in charge, and propelled by an
engine. “To what base uses may we return,
Horatio?”
Bob Lawson, then Commodore of the Club,
acted as umpire; W. J. Weathered, Commodore
in 1897, was hon. secretary; Captain Almond,
as already stated, was the starter, and the Gov-
ernment had lent the Pippo for these officials,
the Committee, and a few friends. Commodore
Weathered sailed as one of the crew of the
Latona. The Otter and the Midge, other Gov-
ernment boats, also followed the race.
The second race was a win for the Sydney
crack, Trex, sailed and owned by Nick John-
son, the date being the 19th March, 1894. The
prizes for the event were the same as in the
previous race—viz., £3O first, £lO second, and
£5 third, It had been arranged that the course
should be 10 miles dead to windward from the
Pile Light, with a run back to the starting point.
The time had been fixed for noon and both the
flagships and the starter’s boat arrived at the
Pile Light somewhat before that hour. At the
time, however, the weather was almost a calm,
121
HISTORY OF THE Y. 0.


and it was impossible to tell what would be a
windward course. The umpire and starter
therefore decided to postpone the start for
half-an-hour and at the expiration of that time
the wind was coming in very gently from the
east, The contestants were the same as in the
first race, save that the Yarakoo was added to
the list, whilst the Australian .had not been
entered, the starters therefore numbering ten.
At twenty-five past twelve Captain Almond
fired the preliminary gun, thus announcing that
the boats were to get away five minutes later
to a flying start. /The first to pass over the line
after the starting gun had been fired w r as the
Irex on the port tack, closely followed by the
Latona on the same tack, Bulletin, Clyanthns,
and Caucebie in close order following. To
show how light the wind was, let me say that
there was a difference of two minutes between
the first and last boat to cross the line. Differ-
ence of opinion with the men in charge was
seen a little later on—that is. a difference in
regard to the probable wind, and as to the cur-
rent, for the Irex went right away from the
crowd on a long board towards St. Helena,
possibly expecting the ebb tide on her lee bow
to give her some help, whilst the Clyanthus
■went just as far away in the opposite direc-
tion, so that the spectators, aye, even the cap-
tains of the yachts themselves, knew not how
the race was standing. The Lady Musgrave,
with Captain Collin in charge, steamed
122
UIiST O ii V OF THE R. Q. Y. 0.


toward Moreton Island and anchored about two
miles to the northward of the Sand Hills,
she being the rounding mark for the competitors.
The beat to windward was a very tedious pro-
cess for all, the wind being so light. And here
let me say how conflicting were the opinions
of the various skippers, for such experienced
men as Jack Whereat and Jim Clark in the
Bulletin and Clyanthus respectively, had gone
so far to the nor’rad that they got almost out of
sight of the steamer passengers, and became
as it were unknown quantities. No doubt they
were after a nor’easier, which never came.
Shortly after three o'clock the wind, such as it
was, hauled a few points to the nor’rard, be-
came indifferent and then went back to the east.
As the boats got nearer the flagship it was easily
seen that the Sydney champion, Irex, held a
long lead, with the Caneebie second, and the
Portia third.
The order and times of rounding the Lady
Musgrave were as follow: —
Irex . . . . .. .. 3.53,44
Caneeoie .. .. .. 4. 3.20
.Portia . . . . . . . . 4. 5.58
£enobia . . . .. 4.11.30

Latona .. .. .. .. 4.13.48
Bulletin .. .. .. 4.17.43
Turkrooar .. .. .. 4.24. 3
Yarakoo . . . . .. 4.28. 8
The Nyoola some time previously had given
up and returned home.
II IST 0 H Y 0 F TII E K. Q. Y. C.


It is vTitten:—“The Irex, after rounding,
with her lead of about four minutes, did not
hurry much in getting on extra canvas, but
eventually sent aloft a square sail and raffee.
GoodaJl hoisted a squaresail on the Caneebie
and then sent up a large ringtail to his mainsail.
The Portia quickly got on a souaresail and
watersails under both mainsail and squaresail
booms, while the Zenobia sent aloft a squaresail
and ringtail to mainsail. James Clark, who had
rounded the fiagboat almost level 'with the
Zenobia, ran up a very large spinnaker and
soon had the Clyanthus well ahead of the
Zenobia. Whereat, as soon as he got the Bul-
letin before the wind, clapped on every stitch
cf extra canvas he could, his kites including
squaresail. with a jib headed raffee, and a large
ringtail to mainsail. For a long time the run
home was a very slow procession, with long gaps
between the boats. ’’ The times of finishing were
as follows:
I rex 5.38. 0
Careebie .. .. , 5.49. 0
Portia 5.52.30
OJyanthus .. 5.52.45
Latona 5.56.30
Bulletin .. .. 5.56.45
Zenobia . . . . . 5.58 0
Bob Lawson acted as umpire. Newspaper
reports say that the initiation of these inter-
colonial races was to the credit of Mr. Cameron,
and general regret was expressed that he did
not have better luck with his boat, the Turk-
rooar.

January of 1895 (19th and 26th) saw the
22-footer championship inter-colonial races held
in Sydney, the Lady Norman already referred
to, being one of the Queensland competitors.
Before leaving the pleasant subject of the
Inter-colonial races (and no one but must admit
that the reading of those friendly contests is
pleasant) I will quote .from the [Brisbane
Courier, of Friday. January 4th, 1895. It is
as follows:
The following members of the Club have signified
their intention of going to the Carnival:—Hon. E. B.
Forrest, J. H. Whereat, W. P. Cameron, J. Clark, E.
Clarke, F. J. Clarke, W. J. Weatherill, W. Hanson,

E. Markwell, J. Williams, E. Perry, E. Hockings, S.
Sanberg, E. Silvester, W. Fowler, O, Kelley, 6.
Parrott, W, Effie, F. Midson, and E. Harland.
W. J. Morley (“Tell-Tale”), I am reminded,
was “also present,” but, with characteristic
modesty, didn't mention the fact when writing
the above paragraph. The reading through of
these names should prove interesting, for,
although some know the great secret and hove
gone aloft, there are many familiar personages
in the list still taking an active part in yacht-
ing and at present helping the good honest
sport along.
The course for the 22-footer race in Sydney
Harbour was the customary one from Fort
Denison to the Sow and Pig, near the South
Head, and back.

Just fancy, nineteen 22-footers in one race,
all starters, fourteen Sydney craft against five
from Brisbane. Sydney Harbour never pre-
sented such a sight before. Does not one’s
mouth water, and the lover of those good old
days of sailing for such craft strongly desire
that these days would return once more?
“Alack and aday, never, 5 ’ I hear my reader
say, for the white wings of such craft seem for
ever doomed and skippers and crews of such
quality may ne’er sail the waters again neither
here nor in Sydney.
At twenty minutes past three a!) the immense
fleet were sent away, all being close together
when the final flag was lowered. In the con-

fusion of the start there were two or three
fouls, but it would have taken a very smart
umpire to have made any disqualifications.
Even up to the very last minute before the
final flag was lowered some of the skippers,
fancying their crew too many and heavy,
dropped a man or two overboard in the harbour
to be picked up by the first pleasure boat or
steamer coining along.
The Irex was the first to show out in front,
the Lady Norman, however, holding the
best wind and position and the Bose close fol-
lowing. Both the Bulletin and Caneebie
had bad luck at the start, and not having their
topsails set did not appear to have much life
in them in the very light breeze that was blow-
ing. Just before reaching Bradley’s Head the
Ellie, a well watched and favoured Sydney
boat, carried away her bobstay, and was un-
fortunately out of the race. The Lightship was
rounded by the Lady Norman at 3.59.58,
Latona 4.0,32, Portia 4.1.29, Bose and
Caneebie seventh and eighth boats respec-
tively, the Bulletin (number fourteen at this
part of the race) at 4.5.32.
To reach home meant stretches of long and
short legs. The Latona and Irex both
weathered the Lady Norman, the Esmeralda
shortly afterwards challenging the leading
boats, and running into first place, whilst the
Lady Norman-—or the “Brisbane Syndicate
boat,” as she was called by our Sydney friends
HIST 0 B Y O F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


—lost a lot by tacking too close inshore under
Shark Point, and thereby getting becalmed.
At Shark Island the Esmeralda was wed
ahead, and leading in great style, the Brisbane
boats being well out of the running. At Shark
Island the breeze became fresher, and with
eased sheets the boats, bowling along in great
style, presented a sight well worth going to
Sydney to see. Towards the finish the Lady
Norman ran into fifth place, but was blanketed
by a pleasure boat. The finish was;—
Esmeralda .. . . 6. 1.37
Irex .. .. .. .. 6.8.4
Varuna • - . . - • 6. 8.42

Bulletin . . . . . . 6,13. 6

The umpire (Mr. W. R. Griffiths) without
protest, disqualified the Portia and Ata-
lanta for committing breaches of the sailing
rules, which disqualification placed the Lady
Norman fifth, the umpire openly stating that
ail the Brisbane boys sailed a fair and square
race.
On the 23rd January the sailing race for the
18-footer class took place, the Sydney boats
being the Ruby, Ariel, Nereid, Cygnet, Aztec,
and Edith, and the Brisbane craft Victoria,
Vera and Truant. The winner turned up in
the Ariel, sailed by George Ellis; then came
the Victoria, with the Ruby third.
11 ISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


Next we come to the Anniversary Regatta
Day programme, which, among other events,
included the second of the Inter-colonial Con-
tests, the races that day being both for 22-footers
and 18-footers, and there is no doubt in my mind
that those races will never be forgotten by those
who witnessed them or by the skippers and crews
of the boats taking part therein. There was
what yachtsmen call a snorting breeze from the
south-east with plenty of sea in the lower
harbour. Seventeen boats, including the
cream of the Sydney craft, faced the starter,
and it was said, prior to the final flag going
down, that to such experienced men as Jack
Whereat and Tom Goodall they stood a good
chance of either winning or being placed.
From the description supplied to the Brisbane
Courier by “Tell-Tale” (Mr. W. J. Morley) I
learn that the morning of the day broke dull
and threatening, and early in the afternoon a
drizzling rain set in with a bleak, driving wind,
causing the Queenslanders much cold and incon-
venience ; but they were game, neither wind nor
rain damping the ardour of the crews. The
18-footer race resulted in Ariel (1) . Victoria
(2), Nereid (3).
In the 22-footers’ race the Lady Norman ap-
peared in the sails of the Zenobia, which were
much smaller than her own, whilst Tom Goodall
had put aside the new mainsail he had used for
the first race, and the Caneebie appeared with
an older and smaller suit, the Esmeralda carry-
129
HIST 0 R Y OF THE B. Q. Y. C.


iog the same sail she had won the first race with.
At 2.33 p.m. the boats got well away, it being
difficult to say which had the advantage of the
start. The wind came in short squalls from
the southern shore of the harbour, the Caneebie
and Waihora being the only boats that carried
suitable sails for the afternoon. Sheets had to
be well aboard to fetch Bradley’s Head. Off
the Head, about two miles from the start, the
Portia had headed the Esmeralda, many of
the craft setting square sails, the Bulletin
for some time being content with a topsail as
extra canvas. Tom G-oodali got out a spinnaker,
the “Bully” shortly afterwards following suit,
this latter boat at this juncture passing one
boat after another until she ran into third
position. Off Middle Head, where there was a
heavy roll and a strong breeze, the order was
Irex, Portia, Bulletin, with the Waihora
well in the rear. Off the Quarantine Station,
just inside the North Head, the Bulletin sailed
past the Portia and drew rapidly on the Irer.
sailed by Johnson. To fetch the rounding
marks the boats had to be kept very square
before the wind, which was awkward for those
having too heavy a press of canvas, and just
before reaching the buoy Rosetta and Gladys
turned turtle, while the Latona lost a man, over-
board but returned and picked him up. The
Manly buoy was rounded by Irex at 3.26.00,
by the Bulletin 40 seconds later, Esmeralda
3-27.32, Caneebie being the eighth boat at
H IBTORY OF TH E R. : Q. Y. 0.


3.28.15. The Bulletin kept her topsail up
until hauling the wind, and then Whereat
housed it. None of the other boats tried a
topsail on the wind. The thrash up to and
across the Heads, with the wind blowing
stronger than ever, w r as quick and lively work,
and those of my companions who have been to
Sydney and have seen how it can blow there at
times, will appreciate my expression of “quick
and lively.” The “Bully” slogged into it
in grand style, and amidst great excitement
amongst those on the steamers following the race,
continued to gain on the leading boat. The
Caneebie also, in her small suit, bowled along
at a fine pace, and soon worked into third
position, whilst the Lady Norman fell away
and afterwards lowered sails and retired. After
throwing round on to the port tack off the
Manly shore, Jack Whereat took a long stretch
over to Middle Harbour, the Irex keeping more
towards the Quarantine Station, these two boats
closing in together off the North Head. At
first the Bulletin passed just under the stem
of the Irex, but after another short board she
threw round, crossing to windward of the Irex,
and thereby had the Sydney crack beaten on a
wind. The order of rounding Shark Island
buoy was—Bulletin 4.30.35, Irex 4.31.19,
Latona 4.33.10, Caneebie 4.34.35. None of
the boats in the run home set any extra canvas,
although the water in the upper part of the
harbour was comparatively smooth and the

At the close of the race there was tremendous
cheering from the flagship and the other vessels
in the vicinity, the Queenslanders receiving
hearty congratulations on the success of the
“Bully.”
On the following Saturday the final contest
in connection with the Inter-colonial Sailing
Carnival of that year—lß9s —took place, again
in Port Jackson, under circumstances so “Tell-
Tale'’ wrote, never paralleled in Sydney. For
several days before the race the wind had been
blowing strong from the south and south-east,
causing a heavy sea outside, but hy Saturday
the wind had increased to a gale, with drench-
ing and blinding rain, which became continuous
almost up to the time of starting the race.
Every fresh shower was accompanied by fierce
white squalls, blowing almost with hurricane
force. .From the upper part of the harbour
could be seen a continuous line of breakers
across the Heads, whilst the spray was dashing
right over the forts on Middle and George’s
Heads. Heavy sea was breaking over the Gap
into Watson’s Bay. “Tell-Tale” says that the
sea tumbling in at the Heads caused a heavy roll

HISTORY O F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


all up the harbour, the southerly gale striking
the waves at an angle and causing a confused
and awkward sea, the marvel being that any of
the smaller craft were able to keep afloat in it.
One of the large Manly steamers in crossing
inside the Heads had a boat washed out of the
davits, another had a passenger washed over-
board, whilst the large yachts of the Royal
Sydney Yacht Squadron, which had a race ap-
pointed for the day, with a course altered from
an outside one to twice round a Manly mark,
did not venture to Manly a second time, pre-
ferring to finish the race with one lap. All
this I am giving to show what a day it was,
at the same time being desirous to put on record
that the boats sent down from Brisbane did
their duty nobly and well under the guidance
and skilful care of individual skippers and
crew.
The course for this Inter-colonial race was a
triangular one, only three miles long, but it
was quite enough for the day, especially as it
was nearly an hour past the appointed time of
starting before the boats could get away. The
starring point was Clark Island, off Darling
Point, with a run dead before the v/ind to
Taylor Bay, between Bradley and Chowder
Heads, then a thrash up to and around Shark
Island, off Rose Bay, and thence to the starting
point with a loading wind. It is remarkable
to read that in such weather and on such a day
only three of the boats contesting capsized dur-
133
HISTORY OF THE R.Q. Y. C.


mg the race. One of these went over at Tay-
lor Bay mark, where there was a rocky shore
under the lee, and as the waves kept washing
the crow off the upturned boat they had a
rather perilous time before they could be rescued.
Two other boat* turned turtle before reaching
the mark, and it was a good while, too, before
their crews could be picked up. From another
boat a man fell overboard. While manoeuvring
to pick him up her rudder broke, and she was
forced to anchor a long way to leeward of the
man in the water, who, fortunately, was a very
strong swimmer. After a while one of the
Balmain ferry steamers, which had been follow-
ing the race, threw him a couple of life buoys
and soon afterwards the umpire’s boat got near
enough to throw him a line, which he secured,
and was hauled on board after being in the
water a quarter of an hour. Many sailing
craft in the vicinity of Clark Island came to
grief.
The prizes for the race were offered by the
Sydney Flying Squadron and consisted of £2O
first, £lO second, and £5 third. There were no
less than twenty-six entries, the race being sailed
in two heats, with a final, the handicap being
allowed at the start.
For the first heat there were eleven starters
out of thirteen entries, the Bulletin, under Jack
Whereat, being the only Brisbane competitor.
She had her own sails with one reef -in the
mainsail, but carried a large crew, thus putting

her very deep in the water. Her peak had to
be continually lowered to keep her afloat. The
Victoria, capsized at the start. The Connie
turned turtle on reaching the first rounding
mark, and the Elbe, breaking her boom, retired.
The result was: —
Vera. 18-footer, . . 4.28’15
SteJla, 18-footer, 4.28.31
Secret, 22-footer, .. .. 4.28.45
Bulletin, 22-footer, 4.29.15
For the second heat there were also thirteen
entries, but only eleven started, the Lady
Norman being the only Queenslander. The
event was started almost immediately after the
first heat; consequently the two races were in
progress at the same time. Most of the Brisbane
boys having returned home, the Lady Norman
was in charge of and steered by Chris. "Webb,
was manned entirely by Sydneyites, and had
one reef in. The finish was as follows:
Lady Norman, 22-footer, . . 4.42.22
Cygnet, 18-footer, .. .. 4.43.15
Betthia, 20-footer, . . . . 4.44.10
Victor, 20-footer, .. .. 4.44.15
The boats thus in the final heat were—Vera,
Stella. Secret, Lady Norman, Cygnet and Bet-
tina. They started in pouring rain, and when
they had travelled about half-way to Taylor
Bay mark they were struck with a white squall
blowing with almost hurricane force. The
Cygnet and Bettina were capsized, the Vera
only saving herself by a half-lowered mainsail.

The finish came—
Lady Norman .. .. 5.31.46
Secret . . . . . . 5.33.21

Then on the Ist January, 1896, in the Hamil-
ton Reach, there was sailed a sweep-stake race
of £1 per boat, with £5 added by the Queensland
Yacht Club, the contestants being three Southern
and two local 18-footers, the names being—■
Ariel, Olinda, and Yvonne (Sydney boats), with
for Brisbane the Britannia and Vera, the prize
money being £8 and £2. The result was:—■
Ariel .. .. . . . - 5.20.54
Britannia .. .. •• 5.21.57
Vera 5.24.29
Yvonne .. .. .. 5.24.31
Olianda .. .. .. 5.26.30
Geo. Ellis was in charge of the Ariel, whilst
Arthur Earle had the Britannia under his
control, Sam Sanberg having the tiller of the
Vera.
At the Sandgate Regatta, of 1896—the eighth
annual one, lam informed—Sydney and Bris-
bane again tried their prowess, Brisbane winning
both events. Sandgate was en fete for the
occasion, many thousands of onlookers being
either ashore or afloat. The Bulletin put in
a good win to her credit in the 22-footers’ race
and the Britannia repeated her Cleveland per-
formance among the 18-footcrs. In the former
event there was a remarkably close finish for
second place, the Irex, of Sydney, just beating
the Caneebie by half a second only. These two
boats, however, had been recalled by Captain
n!ST O R Y o F TII R R. Q. Y. C.


Almond as being over the line at time of start-
ing. Both, therefore, had to return and re-
cross the line, which considerably delayed them.
The handicap cruiser race was won by the
22-footer Australian, and the 18-footer ditto by
the Daisy. The Lucinda, Otter and Pippo fol-
lowed the races, the Regatta and all details
being well in the hands of Harry Marshall,
Hon. E, B. Forrest, umpire, and Captain Al-
mond, starter.
A strong east-south-east blew almost the entire
day, and proved enough for all the boats, the
course being principally leading and running.
There was some delay in the starting of the
22-footers, the Sydney boats Irex and Esmer-
alda changing their suits of sails more than
once before deciding to start, the umpire grace-
fully allowing them time to do so. There were
nine starters, two Sydney and seven Brisbane
boats. Finishing times were—
Bulletin .. . . . , 3,29.50
Irex 3.32.12
■Oaneebie . . .. 3.32.12 J
Hibiscus .. .. .. 3.35.30
Jack Whereat, as usual, sailed the “Bully,”
Geo. Ellis the Irex, Tom Goodall the Caneebie,
and Billy Spring the Hibiscus.
For the 18-footers there were three Brisbane
boats, represented by the Britannia, Truant,
and Vera. Finishing times were—
Britannia .. . . .. 2.51.10
Vera .. . . .. .. 2.51.46
Yvonne .. ... ~ 2.52.10
Arthur Earle was in charge of the Britannia.
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


Best 1 forget, methinks the Caneebie was
built in Sydney for Mr. Tom Goodall by W. H,
Golding, of Balmain.
The following Monday saw an 18-footer
sweepstake between boats from the two Colonies
in the Hamilton Reach, the winning placed boats
being, Ariel, Yvonne, Olianda, the Vera cap*
sizing.
The Intercolonial races at the Sandgate Re-
gatta I have already referred to. On Thursday,
the 2nd of January, 1896, another 18-footer
sweepstake was sailed under the guidance of our
Club in the Hamilton Reach, five boats starting,
three from Sydney and two from (Brisbane.
The prize money was a sweepstake of £1 each
with £5 added money from the Club, the wind
being a light puffy east by north east, the Q.G.S.

The result reads—

Olianda .. .. 5.23.45
Note the narrow margin of time between the
third and fourth boat.
The settling in connection with the champion
and sweepstake races took place on the 3rd
January, 1896, and on Saturday, the 4th, a com-
plimentary regatta was tendered the Sydney
yachting visitors by the City of Brisbane Sail-
ing Club in the Milton Reach.

The 22-footers ; race fell to the Queensland
boat, Ettie, after an extraordinarily close race
with the Sydney boat Esmeralda. This latter
boat held the lead until within 100 yards
from the finishing line, where the Ettie came
up and passed her, winning amid intense excite-
ment by five seconds. Then came in order
named—lrex, which beat Caneebie by half a
second for third place, then followed Bulletin
and Hibiscus. The 18-footer champion race
went to the Britannia 4.17.45, and Yvonne
4.19.20.
Here we wander away for a while to the Inter-
state Carnival held in Sydney in January of
1897. At a civic welcome given to our rep-
resentatives and visitors, many high and promi-
nent Sydney sports were present. X clip this
from a Sydney paper:—
Mr # Sam Horden, inter alia. —“I have a cheque of
£2O from Mr. J. Harris, of Ultimo, and if you gentle-
men will allow me, I will present you with another
cheque for £3O. and if you see fit let the latter be
awarded as the prize for the Inter-colonial Championship

Thu Cancebie, Stanley, Victoria, and Bttie
woiv sent down to Sydney and contested the
22-foot Championship of Australia on the 21st
January, 1899, but owing to the faint breeze
which blew from the east-north-east the course
was not completed in time. One Sydney
writer has it on record—it was the dullest and
most uneventful couple of hours’ sailing ever
witnessed in Port. Jackson.
The 22-footers’ Challenge Race in Sydney
Harbour on Anniversary Day was won by the
Bede, the Queensland boats being altogether out
of it. On the 29th January the Championship
was won by the Bilie, her finishing time being
5.57.10, the Stanley, a Queenslander, coming
in at 6.5.10, and the Caneebie at 6.7.34.
The Daily Telegraph, a Sydney newspaper, m
commenting on the races said: —
'fhey will have io bund new boats and have them
rigged io. much ueUtr tanhon than at present if they
with co ou-ocessruliy compete with the cream of the
Sydney racing erait.
Maybe, 1 have dwelt longer than was neces-
sary over these races, but to this day the imai
race in Sydney Harbour in January, 1095 is
spoken of in Sydney by the old hands as a
race of races on a day of days. Mind, you,
it can blow in Sydney Harbour equally as
well as in Moreion Bay, and to race 18 or
22-footers with the tremendous spread of can-
vas carried by this type of craft over such a
course as is laid down for the Sydney contests
requires not only good boats but cool-headed
HIS T O ft. Y O P TII B ft. Q. Y. 0


and very experienced skippers with calm quali-
fied crews to keep them afloat. The boats are
sailed without an ounce of dead weight, and for
their stability are solely and wholly dependent
upon the leverage produced by the crew hang-
ing out or sitting in from the gunwale to
counteract the sail area pressure from the
force of wind. Any lull or increase in wind
must be quickly met by the crew either
getting in or hanging out, otherwise an im-
mediate catastrophe would be inevitable; the
boat would either fall over to windward or
bury her lee gunwale and fill up. To give some
idea of the type of boat and the sail area she
carried I have taken the following extract from
a report which appeared in the Evening News
of Saturday, November 16, 1907:
THE 22-EOOTEK.
The 22-footer is a marvellous production of the
local builders and designers. Built of half-inch red
cedar, with bent hickory or spotted gum ribs, and keel,
stem and stern post of hardwood, she is, as she must
be, a triumph of strength, combined with lightness.
Roughly speaking, her beam is from 10ft. to lift., and
her depth not more than 2ft. 6in. Mr. Taylor’s
“Keriki,’ ’ one of the last of her type, measures from
the fore end of her bowsprit to the latter end of her
boom exactly 59ft. 6in.; her jib is 22ft. on the foot,
her mainsail 36ft. on the boom, 22ft. in the hoist, 22ft.
on the gaff, and 40ft. on the after leech. The ring-
tail is 21ft. on the yards, and 39ft. on the after leech;
her spinnaker is 42ft. on the hoist and 40ft. on the
boom, and her topsail yard is 21ft. To carry such
a spread of canvas in so relatively small a boat without
an ounce of ballast, some 15 to 25 hands are required,
and pretty smart hands they must be.
HIST 0 R ? O F TH E R. Q. Y . C.


What a pity the days of 22-footers are, it
seems, over, for that length of a boat is the length
to try and command skill and knowledge and to
bring out the true sailing qualities and pluck
of a yachtsman. The 18-footers of to-day in
our waters are, I admit, good types of boats
and dare anyone tell me we have any but good
men in charge of them in their various contests!
Many of those skippering such craft
are equally capable of taking charge #f the
larger craft in almost any weather conditions,
and thanks be to this noble, healthy and manly
pastime, they are the tutors of many a lad
who, in time to come, will give a good account
of his early tuition. One is almost sorry that
the 22-footer contests between Sydney and Bris-
bane w'ere not a yearly affair, for if it had
been so the boats would probably never
have gone out of commission. There is, I
know, the cost of upkeep, but to my mind the
real reason was the difficulty of keeping together
and commanding a regular and good working
crew. For both 22-footers and 18-footers alike
are not sailed and worked by a man and a boy
as forward hand. I wonder, yes, I wonder,
if we will see again those noble 22ft. craft sail-
ing as of yore on our Brisbane River and More-
ton Bay waters? How lazy and independent
the kicker is making one. I was once told by
a friend of mine that a motor now-a-days, as
compared to the early craft of years ago, is but a
“corkscrew boat.” I wonder what that means?
HIST OR V 0 F TII E R. Q. Y. G.


To this Club must be given the credit of
having inaugurated these Inter-colonial contests
which did so much towards the encourage-
ment and advancement of yacht racing. At first
these events were confined to battles between
New South Wales and Queensland, but latterly
Western Australia has taken a hand in them,
and the racing now has become a sort of tri-
angular affair between the three States men-
tioned. In the earlier racing, however, the
rivalry between New South Wales and Queens-
land for supremacy was particularly keen, and
produced some of the finest exhibitions of skill
in open boat racing ever witnessed in New
South Wales or Queensland waters by the
large crowds of the sporting public who always
gathered in great force to watch these races.
In the contests held in Sydney Harbour, how-
ever, the New South Welshmen had all the thick
end of the stick, in point of numbers; that is
to say, for every 22-footer representing Queens-
land, the sister colony pitted against us four
boats. This was strikingly represented in
the two races held in the Harbour on 19th
and 26th January, 1895, to which I have pre-
viously drawn attention, viz:—Fourteen on the
first day and twelve on the second day of Syd-
ney’s flyers, in charge of the very best skippers
new South Wales could produce, against our five,
was a trifle over the odds. It was soon there-
fore realised that a more equitable arrangement
would require to be made. The position was

should represent each State. lam pleased to
say that notwithstanding the fact that the 22-.
footer class has died out, these Interstate contests
an; still kept or. foot and provide much sp(jpt
amongst the smaller fry. Personally, so soon as
this dreadful war is over, I should like to see
this Club, whether I am Commodore of it or
not, take the matter up with the Southern Yacht
Clubs, with a view, if possible to bringing about
an Interstate Yacht Race, The size and class
of yacht would of course, have to be mutually
agreed upon, and no dohbt a small vessel cap-
able of transhipment by coasting steamers from
one State to another would be the most desir-
able type. The races could be for a Challenge
Cup. and conducted on the principle of the
.America Cup. but on more equitable conditions
then those irnnosed on the challenging craft by
the New York Yacht Club. In f-ny ease yachts-
men must sec to it that these Interstate contests
are not allowed to die out, nor must the white
wings bo allowed to grow weary through the
introduction of the 1 'kicker. ’ J
It is but right and gracious on my part to
say that to Mr. T. Goodall, the owner and
skipper of the Caneebie, belongs the honour
of having brought about the first of the Inter-
colonial races between New South Wales and
Queensland. Somewhere about the beginning
HIST O R Y 0 P THE R. Q. Y. C.


of the year 1894 Mr. Goodall paid a visit to
Sydney, and while there suggested to Mr. W. H.
Golding, of that city, the advisability of an Inter-
colonial Carnival being held. The matter was
placed before the Johnstone’s Bay Sailing Club,
with the result that the secretary of that club
(Mr. Sid Dempster) wrote to Mr. Goodall asking
what inducement could be held out for Sydney
boats to visit Brisbane. The correspondence
was handed to the Club, the matter was taken
up with much energy, and the Club became in-
debted to Mr. Waverly Cameron for the ar-
rangement of the first races over the Cleveland
course. Mr. Cameron thought the idea was
such an excellent one that he even went to the
expense of specially building and equipping
the Turkrooar to take part in the first race.
How deeply I regret the discontinuance of
these 22ft. races.
Yet a little more of these Inter-colonial con-
tests and I am done. These races were under
the auspices of our Club, and should be given a
note in my writings, for not only did the
races bring about much good and friendly
rivalry, but they decidedly sent yachting ahead
on our own river and bay and that did much
good to other clubs as well as to our own.
On Boxing Day of 1895, a regatta was held
at Cleveland for 22-footers and for 18-footers,
the winners turning up in the Bttie and the
Britannia respectively, both Brisbane boats.
The start was a flying one, across an imaginary
145
HIST 0 a Y o F TH E R. Q. Y. G.


line between the end of the new Cleveland
Jetty and a mark boat, and the course was the
same as that previously laid down for Inter-
colonial contests at Cleveland. For the Re-
gatta. we find—President Hon. J. R. Dickson,
Vice-President W. Finucane, Hon. Treasurer
J. F. Bell, Umpire Hon. E. B. Forrest, Starter
Captain Almond, with Waverly F. Cameron as
Hon. Secretary. 4
There is little need for me to give any'
lengthy details, save that in fairness I should say
the Irex, a Sydney boat when in second position,
and the Hibiscus, a local boat, made a mistake
in the course, the Bulletin thereby, so it would
appear, obtaining second place in the 22-footers.
The weather was showery, with a steady
south-east breeze, not quite perhaps as strong
as some would have desired, but quite strong
enough to show and bring about good sailing.
It is written that the victory of the Ettie was a
somewhat unexpected one, but that she won
on her merits and outsailed her opponents on
every point. She was a comparatively new
boat, and had only one previous victory to her
credit, namely a handicap race in the Milton
Reach, She was built by her owner, Mr.
Wain, the design being, it is understood, by
Mr. E. A. Cullen.
The 22-footers ended in this wise—

very fair sea running. lam not going into

Secretaries and Their Work.
So now we leave the dull—in some respects
I fear, through no fault of mine, incomplete—
details of racing contests, and write from
memory of events and doings such as I deem
worthy of chronicle, even though you, rny dear
readers, may perhaps deem them as tedious as a
twice told tale. There are honorary secre-
taries to enumerate, lectures to dwell upon,
smoke concerts to hark back to, with pleasant
memories of singers past and present, dim recol-
lections of friendly gatherings, with not too
much detail, for Club life, with its varied
side-lights must not be depicted in its halo
of truth, for—well, for many reasons. Think
of the days of Garrick; of Lamb, the gentle
Elia ; of Dean Swift; of Boswell and his famous
Johnson; of Sheridan; of Hook, and many
others, Bohemians of the. true Bohemian type,
merry over a flagon of ale or the best Rhenish
wine, their evenings—evenings of wit and mer-
riment —and best of all, of the brighter side of
life and humanity, harming no one save per-

haps themselves. And I hear you say: * ‘ Com-
pare our Club life and its doings to suit those of
the famous men of yore!” I answer “No,” for
I make no comparisons and know our wit and
pleasantries were not as those I have mentioned,
but I say, ‘ ‘ Have we not had merriment as well
as they; have we not, over a glass of the very
best, fought our sailing contests and events over
and over again with friendly voice and pleasant
eye, and have not all such merriments given
us much pleasure?” Your answer —“Yes!”
Our Club has, indeed, been blessed with
many good honorary secretaries, so good
that now on calm consideration I think
it best to mention not one of them even
by name, for that would be unfair, indeed.
The pioneer secretary had much work to per-
form equal in degree to that of those of
later days, and on the secretary very
often rests the very life and being of a club.
It was not, however, until the forming of a
Club Room in the basement floor of the A.M.P.
Society, in Edward Street, that the work to be
performed became arduous and responsible.
Earlier secretaries had meetings to call and ar-
range. the business chiefly being of a thorough
and true yachting nature. There were races
to be catered for, the fixing of all officers for
the day, the prizes to be allocated, and the
thousand and one things to do to make the work
complete—and to be appreciated. And “Tell
it not in Gath”—(l suppose you have heard
149

thal before)--there were ‘'members in arrears 5 '
to l>e written to, and I presume the customary
“hacl debts” to be written off, the treasurer’s
statement for annual meeting presentation, the
same as still applies nowadays not only to
our Club but lo all sporting clubs in our midst.
Think not I am writing unkindly or untruly, for
in my time I have acted as honorary secretary
to sporting clubs and know the frailties of mem-
bership even in this wise. •
ft was on the 28th April, 1003, that we left
ihv. A.M.P. “Cellars.” and it is really from that
date that our Club has grown in membership
—and I trust in importance; and it was from
that date also that the duties of the honorary
secretary became all the more arduous and
onerous, and the position no sinecure. At the
opening of the new rooms in Eagle Street,
our then President was in the chair, and a
goodly attendance of members awarded the sec-
retary his due for making all provision for a
pleasant gathering. It was on that evening
that arrangements were made for members to
take up debentures, no higher than £5, for the
furnishing of the Club Rooms and the finding
of an up-to-date billiard table. But there was
no actual bar then in our midst; that came later
on, and still exists, and will exist I presume
until six o’clock closing or “total prohibition”
is put into effect. And then, inethinks, when
we have all “gone dry,” Club life will be a
hollow mockery and a sham, and Club members
HISTORY OP THE R. Q. Y. C.


—if there should be any—will engage in pious
conversation, discussing the merits of halos in
the dim and distant future. There will be no
“two-up” schools in Brisbane, nor will the
merry (sic) toot of the motor-horn be heard
abroad in the early morning, and we shall caper
nimbly to the enticing strains of lutes. It is a
pleasant picture, Is it not?
And the work of the secretary grew apace!
There was money to collect for debenture
purposes, there was the room to furnish, there
were gala evenings of entertainment, and song
to be arranged and looked after—and there was
much work to do. Then, when the billiard
table was provided, there were tournaments to
be regulated, and sing-songs came along in good
pace, and the social comfort of members was not
to be neglected. And well do I remember that
billiard table, for on my attaining a certain
coveted position in the Club I found that our
finances had flourished—all the secretary’s
work—and a piano was wanted. Debentures
fell due, and it was a pity to disturb our nice
bank credit balance and deplete it almost by
handing back certain “fivers” and “oners” to
members who had subscribed and really didn’t
want the “filthy lucre” returned; so in merry
mood I prepared a little circular to debenture
holders asking them to reply whether they
wanted a refund of their money or would leave
it to be used for the purchase of a piano for
the Club Rooms. Opposition of a slight nature
HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


was met with, but everything ended happily and
well, and our Club Room piano was obtained
and still remains in our room, although the out-
break of the war in 1914 made some members
look askance upon it, for it was of German
origin. V/e consoled ourselves even then—ami
even now —by letting any highly-strung and
patriotic member thump its very life out,
but still it discourses sweet music when occasion
requires. It is pleasant to hear our National
Anthem played upon it, and know that in our
hands it spells “culture” in proper manner,
despite its manufacture.
This billiard table and piano have afforded
our members much pastime and pleasure.
There have been strenuous contests played upon
the former, for at one day our Yacht Club had
amongst its members some three or four
amateurs able to hold their own against any
amateur player i# the city. And, instead of
hiring pianos, at a high price, instead of
the fear of damage to the article itself and with
the knowledge that the beauty of our staircase
and the wads were damaged continuously—and
the wrath of our landlord fell heavy on our
heads —the secretary the recipient —there is no
piano expense to our pleasant evening now.
Let me again say the piano -was purchased, and
in the words of the “Lays of Ancient Romo”
any visitor to our Club Rooms may see and say--
And there it (stands) unto this day,
To witness if I lie.

HISTORY OF THE R. Q. Y. C.


A Party at Peel.
I remember one most pleasant evening ar-
ranged by the secretary in 1904. It was sug-
gested that during the Easter Holidays Club
yachts in Moreton Bay for the time should
gather at Peel Island, provided that the weather
was propitious and no south-easter blew into
the Bay in that vicinity. And around the Sun-
beam in Peel Bay there were gathered many
boats, varied in size, in rig, in crew, and in song,
and the sky above was clear and cloudless.
There was the banjo player with clin-clin-clank,
and the negro melody, for as the evening went on
and the wine grew more to our taste, our spirits
grew better than our wine, and the company was
genial. We were all out under the open sky
and we know for keen and real enjoyment
4 ‘There was no home like God’s out of doors.”
It was, indeed, a great evening, and many were
the songs of fervour and wholeheartedness, and
singers and listeners were one in their enjoy-
ment. The Chairman kept decorum, and
prudence allowed such liberty of song and con-
versation that would sully no one or affect any
listener, and during the pleasure of the evening
nothing marred or made uncomfortable the feel-
ings of best of comrade or friend. Yes, it was
a great evening! All was favourable and in-
vigorating, and, when midnight grew near
and the effervescence of jmuthful and warm
blood tingled with joy and emotion and
there was a slight inclination on the part of
153
HISTORY OF TH E R. Q. Y. C.


some to break just a little from the proper
path, our National Anthem was sung, echoing in
the ".roods ashore amidst the silence and sleep
of nature, and the midnight hour ushering in
the Sabbath heard 14 All’s Well,” and “Good-
night” spoken from craft to craft. The morn-
ing was as the evening, calm and tranquil,
and pleasurable. There were bathing parties
galore 44 in puris naturalibus, ” for the white
dag of the motor-boat was unknown even in
those days. No doubt there was the morning
44 dip” on more craft than one, and I as portion
of the crew on the Sunbeam, have a slight
recollection of the said 44 dip” being made and
partaken of by someone.
Such events as this have happened but rarely
among our cruising holiday pleasures; those
partaking in them having recollections vivid and
comforting, trusting that they may still come
again from time to time and be equally as en-
joyable.
Peel Island and St. Helena.
For some years there was at Peel Island
right abreast of the Leper Station, a red light
placed there for the convenience of yachtsmen
and fishermen going across on a deep, black
night towards either Dunwich, Myora, Peel, or
Bird Island. The authorities had been ap-
proached, permission was given to have the light
erected, and, thanks to the big kindly heart of
Captain John Maekay, the Harbour Master of
Brisbane at the time, the Government bore the
154
HIST 0 H Y 0 F THE R. Q. Y. C.


cost of the lamp and pole and kerosene, Captain
Mackay asking me to get the Yacht Club to pay,
or rather give, one of the poor unfortunates on
the Island a fee for lighting the said lamp.
On my placing the matter before the Committee
they willingly donated a couple of guineas an-
nually for the purpose. This lamp was there
for some years, hut has now disappeared—for
what reason I cannot say—-but I know the Club
kept its part of the contract and regularly re-
mitted its cheque to those in authority.
Speaking of Peel Island reminds me of the
establishment of the Leper Station there, and
on that Island it should never have been plaeed.
I won 7 t mention names of Home Secretaries, but
the station at one time was almost being situated
at Myora. Then Amity Point was spoken of;
then Pat’s Point, and, with no ado hut the De-
partment’s own inclination, Peel Island was de-
cided upon. Public meetings were called and
held; special speakers were selected both medical
and otherwise, but it availed nought, the station
was built and on Peel Island it still stands.
Were it my part here how strongly could I
write and condemn its erection on that Island,
and even more so condemn the existence of St.
Helena as a penal establishment, when both
islands could be thrown open to the populace of
Queensland as healthful and pleasure resorts of
the very best in the world. Certainly some
day these Islands will be free. St. Helena is
the best of all, and without doubt is the finest

island in Moreton 13ay, and should be a
children’s paradise in holiday times for gala
functions and occasions.*
Something About King Island.
It is not a long, although sometimes a very
rough, cruise from Peel to King Island, and
let us moke the trip now. In 1887 (thirty-two
years ago) King Island was, by proclamation,
temporarily reserved for recreation purposes,
but as it was not considered to be within the
boundaries of the Cleveland Divisional Board
and no trustees wore appointed, it remained a
“no man’s land” for a number of years. In
that year our Club, at the request of the then
Minister for Lands, nominated trustees for the
island, but the residents of Wellington Point
intervened, and nothing was done. In 1894
the Club moved to get King Island permanently
proclaimed as a recreation reserve, and placed
under trustees who were members of the Club,
the sole object being to preserve the place for
public purposes; but again the local residents
got nr) in awns. Result: Again “nothing
doing.”
In 1898 the interesting question was raised
as to whether King Island did not really belong
*Shortly after this was in print the present Govern-
ment announced —and tbe announcement was received
with universal approval —that they had decided at some
time to remove the penal establishment at St. Helena
to the mainland, and dedicate the island to the public.
156
HIST 0 H Y O F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


to the mainland, and consequently to the Cleve-
land Division, inasmuch as, .so it was asserted,
“the neck of the sandbank connecting the island
with Wellington Point is not covered at high-
water neap tides, though it is covered at high-
water spring tides and at high-water of ordinary-
tides. 5 ’ This knotty problem was submitted to
the learned officials in the law —the Crown Law
office—who held the opinion that the “line of
the medium high tide between the springs and
the neaps’ ’ is the “boundary of the Cleveland
Division,’ ‘ so that if the water at that level
flowed over the well-known spit the Cleveland
Board was out of it--left high and dry. As the
learned Crown Solicitor didn’t know—what
most boating men could have told him—whether
that was the case or not. he left the question
there. Evidently, however, the local authority
got sonm information on the subject, and did
not press their claim further. Finally, years
afterwards, the prickly pear pest, which threat-
ened to overcrown all the available dry land,
settled the question of the control of the island.
The then Government got an estimate that it
would cost them no less than £3O to clear the
island of the pear. They thereupon cast around
for somebody upon whom to place this great
burden, and in 1912 they appointed the members
of the Council of the Cleveland Shire for the
time being as trustees of the island, which had
been made permanently a recreation reserve, and
the Shire Council, which has since had control,
cleared the pear for an expenditure of £9.
157
HIST OK Y OF TH E R. Q. Y. C.


Thus endeth the official history of King Island,
which, according to law, does not belong to the
Cleveland Shire, but does belong to trustees
who are the Shire. Curious, isn’t it? More-
over, the Shire has no legal authority to spend
money on the island, and perhaps its members
may be individually liable for that £9.
Fragments.
This chapter should have been headed— * ‘A
Jumble Chapter.” for my mind wanders from
subject to subject, just as the fit or tempera-
ment of mind suggests.
Looking again through scrap books for
general information, for any overlooked item of
even slight or greater importance, I find that
in June, 3905, our worthy and esteemed member,
Mr. C. B. Pox, gave notice at the annual meeting
that he intended to move at the next ordinary
meeting of members a resolution providing for
the admission of youths under 21 years of age
to certain privileges of the Club, including that
of racing in boats, this being carried later oh.
As I have named Mr. Pox I must also men-
tion Mr. Southern, and these two only. In my
opening remarks of this chapter was it not
written that Twere best to mention no names.
If that be so, and it is so, a digression or an
evasion must be made, whatsoever the word
you choose, for the names of these two— and
these two only—will be here written down.
158
HI SJT 0B Y 0 P TH E R. Q. Y. C.


Both gentlemen received presentations from
the Club, and both were well worthy of the same.
Mr. Southern, after strenuous labours, great de-
termination and assiduity, gave the Club an im-
petus it has never retired from: while Mr. Fox
kept the flag flying, the membership strong, and
his genial good friendship and companionship
were revered by all, as was the case with his pre-
decessor, Mr. Southern. I was at both gather-
ings, the last-named gentleman receiving a gold
watch and albert, Mr. Fox a beautiful gramo-
phone with good records that even unto this
day give many a pleasant hour in his home at
Sandgate.
They were good, live honorary secretaries,
knew and did their duties fearlessly and well,
were good sailing enthusiasts, and feared no
one. May I say, right here, that to the gather-
ings of newspaper clippings in various books
kept by them both I am indebted, for much of
what I have written in respect to sailing events
and carnivals. These two gentlemen, as I
write, are still hale and hearty; so long may
they live and enjoy all the true pleasures of
this world.
Just by the way, and to relieve the tedium
of my writing, but more especially your read-
ing, let me ask the question—“ How do you box
the compass?” You don’t know—neither do
I—so for our edification I give the following:—

In April, 1903, through the courtesy of Cap-
tain (now Admiral) W. R. Creswell, p.M.Q.,
Navel Commandant for Queensland, the Com-
mittee of our Club was enabled to supply a long-
felt want by the establishment of a class for the
instruction of the rudimentary principles of
seamanship. A similar class had been estab-
lished in Adelaide, also through the agency of
Captain Creswell, and had proved a success.
Meetings were held in the Club Rooms once a
vmek. Good instructors were found and ‘the
class formed received much benefit, as to this
day can he seen. More than one member—and
I mention no names—is now giving valuable
service to the Empire, and this early day in-
struction has done him no harm. Many a ship
on the Mediterranean waters has been directed
in her course and controlled in hex actions by
wireless from a certain quarter near Suez, and
the directions therefrom are sent out by the hand
of a good member and true of the Royal Queens-
land Yacht Club.

looked upon and treated as a source of much
enjoyment by the members both young and
matured. The Library now contains some 500
books, and —whisper it not too loudly—fiction
does not altogether predominate. Then we
have our periodicals, the leading ones of the
day, upon our reading table, and these, too,
are well «ought after and appreciated.
Trafalgar Day.
In looking up more material for this chapter
of “Chiefly General.” or “Odds and Ends,”
•whichever you care to design it, I come across
the year 1905, and the day “Trafalgar Day.”
Modesty forbids me to write or say much, so
please let the following from a daily morning
paper suffice:—
ROYAL QUEENSLAND YACHT CHUB.
Date, 21st October, 1905.
In the evening the Royal Queensland Yacht Club
held a commemoration function in their spacious Club
Rooms, Eagle Street. There was a large gathering
of over 200 members and many invited guests. The
Hon. E. B. Forrest (President of the Club) occupied
the chair, and there were also present Fleet Paymaster
Pollock, Captain Pennefatber, Messrs. James Chapman
(President Queensland Flying Squadron), F. W. Perry
(Commodore Brisbane Dingy Club), and many others.
The officers of the Yacht Club present were: —Messrs.
Thos. Welsby (Commodore), G. C. O’Beirne (Vice-
Commodore), C. McLay (Rear-Commodore), Geo. T.
Southern (Hon. Secretary), and M. C. Dalby (Hon.
Treasurer). The rooms were tastefully and suitably
decorated with bunting, cutlasses and other emblems of
martime warfare, and on the walls were shown some
interesting naval pictures of Nelson’s time. One of
the specially invited guests of the evening was Lieut.
Montague G. Pascoe, who is a grandson of Rear-
Admiral Paseoe, who acted as Nelson’s flag Lieutenant
161
HIST 0 K V U h TH JB K. Q. Y . G.


at the battle of Trafalgar, at which time he was Chief
Lieutenant of the “Victory.” There were also present
ten sailors who have served on the “Victory,” their
names being—
Bill Hemming, Red Hill
W. E. Greensell, Registrar General's Dept.
Geo. Shoebridge, C.S.R. Co., New Farm
Geo. B. Cutbush, George Street
Daniel Golding, Morayfield Station
Svdney Geo. Blake, Merton Road. South Brisbane
W. Hadelwood, Boundary Street, West End.
J. Phillips, Sent., New Farm.
Thos. Perming, London Bank Chambers.
W. W. Whatley, Stanley Street, South Brisbane.
The musical portion of the programme was supplied
by an orchestra composed as follows; —Flute, GK
Marshall; Cornet, Inspector Munroe; Trombone, R.
Hendry; Violins. Martyn. Jones, W, H. Vizer, and
Chas, Stumm; 'Cello, "Mason-Beatty; Contra-basso, J.
R. Coates; Drums, J. Cousins; and Piano, R. Kaye.
Proceedings were opened by the honouring of the
toast of “The King,” after which followed a musical
selection by the orchestra. The President (Hon. E.
B. Forrest) then delivered an address. In his opening
remarks he said so much had been said and written
about Nelson and Trafalgar that he would not dwell
on the subject, but he was on safe grounds in saying
that every member of the Club, in fact every British
subject, must wish to join in that day’s commemoration
in some way or other. He stated that the British race
wore as proud of Nelson's record to-day as they were
in 1805. Nelson had thoroughly understood the value
of the supremacy gained that day one hundred years
ago, and quoted Nelson's -words that “Mistress of the
Seas was Master of the World.” A matter of signifi-
cance, be stated, was that our enemy of 1805 was now
our warmest friend in. 1905 —(Note by T. W. as he
now writes —“And still our friend in 1914-1918”).
This, he continued, was most satisfactory, and he
hoped it would always remain so. He stated that the
glory of Trafalgar rested chiefly on Nelson, and rightly
so, too, but due honour must be paid to the officers
and men who fought so nobly under Nelson that day.
(Applause).
A duet, “Army and Navy,” by Wm. H. Long-
bottom and D. B. McSwaine, was well rendered and
warmly received, the orchestra accompanying.
162
HISTOK Y 0 F TH B E. Q. Y. C.


Tho Chairman called upon Mr. Thos. Welaby to
read a paper on Trafalgar. The Commodore, who was
well received, read a thoughtfully and splendidly put
together paper on Nelson, his life, and death, which was
greeted with great applause.
The Chairman then made a small presentation to
the Commodore of a loving bowl and tobacco jar of
Trafalgar design. The Commodore suitably responded
and thanked the Committee for their kindly present.
The song of the evening—“ Death of Nelson ’’ —was
rendered in excellent style by Wm. H. Longbottom, who,
in response to an undeniable encore repeated the last
verse, Mr. Percy Davis sang “Rule Britannia’ ’ with
good expression, the company joining in the chorus.
Mr, C. J. Pound gave an interesting exhibition of
lantern views illustrative of Nelson and Trafalgar,
while Mr, C. McLay read short descriptions of the
various views.
The singing of “God Save the King” concluded a
most successful and enjoyable evening.
A number of interesting relics of Nelson and
Trafalgar were exhibited in Mr. Welsby’s office, ad-
joining the Club Room, which were most instructive, and
were viewed with deep interest by all present. The
function was a great success, and the Royal Queensland
Yacht Club and its Commodore (who was the originator
of the movement) are to be complimented on the com-
pleteness of all the arrangements.
This finishes, mine ancient and most sober
reader, the story of Trafalgar, in 1905. The
Cup presented to me then is still in my posses-
sion, and requires no divining rod to find water.

This is apropos of the Yacht Club balls. Many
and many a. pleasant Yacht Club ball
has been held in the city of Brisbane, when
damsels dark and damsels blonde have danced
with pleasure, when sweet soft nothings have
been breathed, and 0, the world was young and
gay, blithesome and happy. Governors, with
titles of the very best, with madames of kindly
disposition have attended our functions. There
have been gaily bedecked Captains of His
Majesty’s Ships of War, and away in some nook
or corner the middy of simple uniform and
ambition has made love to the daintily dressed
nymph of seventeen. The music has been
sweetly in tune, and to the luxurious, dreamy
waltz the first awakenings of love have wondered
si; then* birth.
The good wives and daughters of senior mem-
bers have undertaken the bedecking of the danc-
ing area: they have toned their mingling of
colours of flags and festoons and flowers, have
seen that the floor was in real proper dancing
condition, and have dreamed and worried and

worked over the dancing programme itself.
Some have wanted “All Waltzes,” some have
desired few “Lancers.” and fewer “Quad-
rules” with no “Mazurkas” or “Schottisches”
but —“ Do make the music sweet, Mr. Commo-
dore,” they have pleaded—and “Please have
three extras whilst the beastly supper is on.”
And we please them all: and the early morning
sees a silent and empty room with a little piece
of lace or the part of a fan, or a crumpled pro-
gramme or broken pencil, and the night has
made its own. stories of love or destiny or fate,
whatsoever you may designate it, yet all pro-
claim “It was the best ball of the season.”
And so it was; who could or would deny it?
Shall I give away a friend, and a Masonic
one, too 1 / Yes, is my own reply. “Can you
tell me if the Commodore is about anywhere?”
No one knows. The time nigh on twelve
o’clock, the music is dreary, hearts are beating
with fond fervor and admiration and the scene
is the Centennial Hall. No one has seen the
worthy gentleman. The querist roams the full
expanse of the ball room, sees no familiar faces,
no forms with either port or starboard listing
and wonders why the world seems so turvy. The
question is asked more than once, and no rational
reply is received. No unravelling of a mixed
and confused tangling is arrived at, but, mark
you, when the proper question is put: “Is this
not the Yacht Club ball to-night?” then comes
a gleaming reason and sanity, for the answer is
HIST Q K Y Q F THE B. Q. Y. G.


received “No, this is the Railway ball.” With
sad and demure countenance the Masonic
member socks the precincts of the Technical
College, South Brisbane, and there is content
and happy.
We must not forget, the goodly lectures kindly
given by friend C. J. Pound and many others.
There have been many lantern slide entertain-
ments, and lectures, brief and long, have added
to the social enjoyment of members and friends.
There have been lectures on Nelson and Na~
poleon, given with all the zest the lecturer could
evolve from a heart and mind intent to do the
best. There have been memorial gatherings,
either speaking of the late King Edward or the
Anzae Day recollections, yet the attendances at
such gatherings has shown the heart of the
Nation, the soul of the man and the love and
kindly membership of all.
The yachtsman’s life makes a basis of social
life, and those partaking of both have associ-
ated river and bay pleasures with the pleasures
of the Club Rooms in all good and loving
respect. For does not the hard living bay man
make a good Club member, and has not the man
who may perhaps have used a very, very hard
word in a sailing race bad and held subdued
voice in Club concerts and felt a throb and
choking sensation when some touching song has
been given or some pathetic speech made? And
yet we criticise and talk about each other, not
too often before each other’s faces, but too often
alas behind each other’s backs.

I would not have mentioned the subject but
have been toid it should be included in my writ-
ings. “At Homes’ 5 have been held by many
commodores prior to ’Xmas Holidays. There
have, been the meetings of many friends on
these occasions, and over a glass of wine or some-
thing else Club members have wished each other
well and “Peace on Earth, Goodwill towards
Men” has been desired of all.
Lest We Forget.
Early in June, 1908, it was determined that
photos 01 all Club Commodores should be placed
on the walls of the Club Rooms, and this was
done in due course.
In September, 1908, memorial photographs of
the late Sir Thomas Alcll wraith. and the late
Sir Arthur Palmer were unveiled in the rooms
in the presence of a large gathering, the late
Hon. F. B. Forrest being in the chair. I had the
privilege and pleasure of doing the unveiling.
Recently the photographs referred to have been
made larger, and I thank most heartily the com-
mittee for having donated to me the first picture
of such prominent men of the early history of
Queensland. These pictures now hang on the
wails of my private residence at New Farm.
There are many photos on the walls of the
Club Rooms of deep interest to all. Pictures
of early days, of openings of the sailing season,
of various craft, but best of all to my mind is

the line of photos of those who have gone to the
war and have done their duty. Their names

A very happy thought struck one of our
members shortly after the outbreak of the war,
and that was to send each soldier member
at the front doing his bit a Christmas souvenir
from the Club, and this has been done regularly
and well; but not only that, a souvenir such as
some would receive was also sent to the parents
or friends here of those who have gone. Letters
have been received from those across the sea
and in the firing line most heartily appreci-
ating the action of the Club members in so send-
ing friendly reminders from those left behind.
No doubt there are many subjects or topics
that need mentioning so as to make the histoiy
HIST OK y O F T. H E R. Q. Y. C.


of the Club as time and correct as possible,
but the one I now relate may be regarded as an
evidence of the patriotism of our members and
the kindly feeling that prevails and has prevailed
for many a long day. It is mentioned in the
annual report for 1915 and must not be omitted
by me. The opening demonstration for 1914
had been arranged for the 26th September, 1914.
and has already been referred to by me in earlier
pages, but to the credit of the Club be it said
that opening demonstration with its customary
gaiety and pleasure never eventuated. The
sum usually expended on the demonstration—-
that is actual expenditure generally charged to
profit and loss —usually amounts to about £3O,
and on this occasion of 1914, the year of the
outbreak of the war, by the unanimous resolu-
tion of the Committee, the amount of £3O was
drawn from the Club funds and donated to the
“Jack Tar” Fund. This amount was started
to assist sailors in trouble after having fought
for the protection of their country, for
civilisation, for Christianity, and for freedom,
the fund also being for the assistance of de-
pendents of men-of-warsmen killed or injured
in the war. A list was opened and well sub-
scribed to, the total on hand and now in the
Government Savings Bank being at this date
£234/0/11. The trustees are Thos. Welsby and
Alex. C. "Wishart. Be it written and remem-
bered well, many members contributed to that
fund the amount they were ordinarily out of
pocket on these occasions. The following eon-

Speaking of trophies, I may be permitted to
write here that on more than one oc-
casion has our Club been approached with
offers of valuable cups, or shields, purely in the
interests of advertising, but, thanks to many loyal
and true amateur sporting committees, these
offers have always been religiously turned down,
no matter what the value of the trophy or the
cup or shield following. I need not write it,
but I am sure our Club will never become an ad-
vertising club, nor will our rooms ever be used
for such purposes.
Outside the “Jack Tar” Fund (which so far
has only had one call upon it, and that a well-
deserving one, too), our members have not only
individually assisted in patriotic movements
both by cash and personal service, but from
those attending cur rooms wc have collected
donations for the following:—
Nurses’ Fund ,
Belgian Relief Fund i
Red Cross Fund i
Queensland Patriotic Dayj
Reinforcements
Anzae Day !
Y.M.C.A
French Bed Cross Fund
Heroes’ Hay Fund
Sailors’ and Soldiers’
Childrens’ Fund
Jack’s Day.
It should not be for me to write it, and that
purely from a feeling of sympathy and not of
sentiment, but there are many amongst our
members, perhaps a little advanced in years,
who have suffered losses of sons and relations.
Yet their hearts have ever been strong, their
pockets always open, and I must perforce say
as I now write that the members feel keenly
such losses, and our sympathies are in all truth-
173

fulness extended to them; and may I say it
especially to the “Mothers,” who bear their
grief and mourn in the silence of their own
rooms.
Anzac Day of 1917. and the commemoration
in our rooms, will, I am sure, never be forgotten
by those in attendance. The address given on
that occasion was rare and pathetic in the ex-
treme, for he who narrated had been there and
spoke with knowledge, truth, and heart. It
reminded me very much of a noted gathering
in our rooms shortly after the late King Edward
passed away, and if any outsider looking upon
yachtsmen as callous and worldly had but heard
their voices raised in the melody of well be-
loved hymns, had noted the gathering, and the
sincerity throughout and after the proceedings,
he would indeed have changed his views. Both
occasions were felt —I can use no other word,
and brought Club members nearer to each other
more than they thought or would say.

CHAPTER VII.
SOME AQUATIC REMINESCENCES.
An Early-Day Regatta Programme.
The first curio of early-day remembrances is
a very ancient Brisbane Regatta programme,
possibly stolen from somewhere. (Vide fao
simile, inset is facing page 27.) This pro-
gramme, as will be seen, is headed—“Pro-
gramme of the Brisbane Anniversary Regatta,
to be held on Monday, January 26, 1857, ’’ and
the event was held in what is known as the
Bridge Reach of the river, the courses for the
races extending from Walmsley’s Point (on the
south side above the bridge) to Garden Point,
below what is now known as the Domain, while
the flagship was moored oif Victoria (now the
Queen’s) wharf. The umpire was Captain
Geary; the committee were A. Beazley, George
Harris, G. Christie, and A. Harvey, and the
hon. secretary and treasurer was N. Bartley.
Amongst the competitors were such identities,
well-known in Brisbane for many years after-
wards, as R. B. Sheridan (afterwards Sub-Col-
175

lector of Customs at Maryborough and later a
member of our Legislature; Wm. Pettigrew,
who was owner of the old sawmill that stood in
William Street where are now the new premises
of the City Electric Light Coy, and whose
colours in the race were a circular saw in red
and white; and last, but not least, Nehemian
Bartley, who got third place in a sailing skiff
race. The entrance fees were £1 each, and a
total of no less than £122 was given in prize
money.
Remember, reader, this was the year 1857,
two years before separation from New South
"Wales, and that both pulling and sailing con-
tests took place all on the same day, with no
north-easter such as we find in the Hamilton
Reach, and such a total of prize money. There
must have been plenty of cash in those days or
little taxation, although two years afterwards,
when the first Queensland Ministry was- formed,
the total amount in the Treasury, according to
Governor Bowen, was 7%d. Yet, who can say
that our early day pioneers were not sports.

What memories, even to me, the names bring
forth. First, we have Sir George Bowen, the first
Governor of Queensland; then R. G. W. (after-
wards Sir Robert) Herbert, our first Premier,
and who for many years afterwards was
Under Secretary to the Secretary of State for
the Colonies in the Home Office; E. B. Forrest,
who from its beginning and until his death
was associated with our Club, some years as
yiee-Commodore and afterwards as President,
and who may fittingly be termed the father of
Brisbane Yachting; also A. R. Jones, B. H.
Webb, W. Y. Brown, H. Duckett White, fathers
of some of our present-day members. ■ Then
there was Captain O’Reilly, who was manager
of the old A.S.N. Coy., and who built the first
Dolly Varden, a una-rigged yacht, with sail
made of blue and white striped canvas; Capt.
Curphy, the early-day skipper, still held in lov-
ing remembrance by old-time coastal travellers;
and Dr. O’Doherty, for many years afterwards
one of our best-known, and most popular Bris-
178

bane medicos. Then I should like to know
just what were the duties of the “Cup Bearer,”
a post which I notice was held by Chas. Coxen,
the original owner of “the Quarries,” the stone
homestead which was such a prominent land-
mark on the river, just above Doughboy Creek,
and which stood on the hill that has since been
excavated to form a site for the meatworks at
what is now known as Queensport.
A Regatta in 1873.
An old programme lent to me by W. J.
Morley is that of one of the combined sailing
and rowing races that in the seventies used to
take place in the Hamilton and Pinkenba
reaches on the Prince of Wales’ Birthday (9th
November). These functions are remembered
particularly for the thunderstorms (sometimes
regular snorters) that came up on this par-
ticular day for several years in succession.
The programme before me is for the regatta of
1873. We still find on the Committee the
names of several of those who were on the 1857
programme. The Marquis of Nomanby was
the Governor doing vice-regal honours. Chas,
C. Innes was the secretary, E. B. Forrest (of
course) umpire, Chas. Coxen sailing starter, and
W. T. Blakeney pulling starter. The prize
money totalled up to no less than £204, the sail-
ing boat winners getting cash and the rowers
cups. The prize for the Yacht Race was £4O,
and the competitors were—the Gleam, then

owned by J. Jones, and afterwards by Geo. Bond,
father of ['resent members; the Charles Dickens,
K. Clark: and Maggie Lauder, owned by
W. Nimmo. who afterwards built the Harriet,
which was, at least not long ago, still afloat on
the Brisbane River —of course with a “ki«ker” in
her. Not long before then the first centre-board
boat (the Fairy) made her appearance in Bris-
bane; and in the races in 1873 there were separate
events for ‘‘fixed keel” and centre-board boats
respectively. It was at this regatta that W. J.
Morley made his debut in boat sailing contests,
his craft being the 17ft. open keel boat Hebe,
amateur built, in which he and his partner (B,
J. T. Barton) used to do regular fortnightly
cruises in the bay every year.
Disaster at the Southport Regatta,
A disaster, which was described at the time
as one “which will for ever mark the regatta
with a black letter in the annals of Queensland,”
occurred after the start of the four boats in
the second race at the Southport Easter Re-
gatta. held on Saturday, 24th March, 1883.
This catastrophe unfortunately resulted in the
drowning of three young fellows (one from the
Vagabond and two from the Alert) and would
have caused further loss of life but for the
promptness with which boats that remained
afloat during the squall that caused the accidents
went to the aid of those in danger, and for the
bravery of some of those who took part in the
HIST 0 R Y 0 F T. H B R. Q. Y. C.


rescue. The blow that caused the trouble was
a south-east squall of unprecedented violence,
although short in duration, and occurred when
all the races except one were in progress. It
was simply overwhelming for craft that could
not get their racing canvas in before feeling its
full strength. The start for the sixth race—
the 25-footers—was about to take place. In
those times races started from fixed moorings.
Amongst those entered for that 25ft. race was
the boat of which I afterwards was an owner
(the Vagabond), then owned and sailed by W.
B, Smith. She was running up before the wind
under full sail to take up her moorings when the
sudden squall swooped down on the ill-fated
yacht (causing her to torn turtle and sink), and
continuing on its coarse overwhelmed the Alert
in similar disaster. In the case of the Vaga-
bond, there was no doubt that the crew were
taken quite unawares, for as soon as the squall
struck her the boat capsized, and, being bal-
lasted v,- ith 15cwf, of railway iron, at once sank,
leaving her crew struggling for their lives in the
water. Mr. E. B. Forrest, umpire, was the
first to go to the rescue in a boat from the
flagship; and, with Gardner (the Southport
pilot) in another boat rowed as hard as they
could for the men in the water. The wind was
now blowing a hurricane, causing the sea to rise
high, .and those pulling in the boats had a heavy
task rowing against both wind and strong cur-
rent. However. Mr. Forrest reached the scene
HiST 0 R V 0 F TH E R. Q. Y. C.


of Ibe accident, and got on board four of the
Vagabond’s men, while Gardner succeeded in
getting another six into his boat. These men
reached the flagship in a most exhausted con-
dition, but soon revived under the treatment of
Dr. Hancock. It v/as at first thought that all
the Vagabond’s crew had been saved, but when
too Me one was reported to be missing, and
this v/as found to be a man named Bishop, who
had not originally formed part of the crew, but
who had volunteered at the last moment as an
extra hand to give more weight when the wind
showed signs of freshening. His body wan
thrown up upon the outside beach on the follow-
ing (Sunday) morning.
The excitement consequent on the accident
to the Vagabond had scarcely calmed down
when the 16-footer Magic, in the first race, com-
ing down to the flagship on her first round with
her flag at half-mast, reported the sad news that
the' Alert, in the 22ft. race, had also capsized,
and that two of her crew had been drowned, the
victims in this case being Leonard Burton, in
the employ of Mr. John Cameron, and Frank
Beetham, son of Mrs. Beetham, of Labrador,
near Southport. The Alert (built by the father
of Arthur White, senr., of Newstead, who was
one of the crew, and sailed by Kelly, one of
her owners, was running before the wind on
the first stretch to Gurrigee, and was oil Lab-
rador, when the squall struck her, with the re-
sult that she turned turtle and disappeared.
HI.ST 0 ll Y 0 F TH E H. Q. Y. w.


The Artemis Ward (sailed b\ Mv. Frarsk
Watts, an old-time bay hand and hA'o.v then
and now a State School teacher) and the liar-
riett, sailed by “old” Ned Clark), corning
np some distance astern. They managed to
lower away everything, and. running under
bare poles, dropped anchor as near as possible
to the men struggling in the water, rescuing all
of the Alert’s crow except the. two unfortunate
young men who disappeared before help could
reach them. One of that crew (Harland).
being carried away by the strong current that
was running, was in a perilous position, but
Frank Watts, getting hold of a portion of the
Artemis Ward’s topmast, which had been
broken in the squall, and using this as a sup-
port in the water, swam to the drowning man
just as be was about done, and saved him—for
which brave act Watts was afterwards presented
with a pair of binoculars in recognition of his
plucky conduct.
These lamentable mishaps at Southport oc-
curred thirty-six years ago. Such a squall as
that which caused them has never been known
either before or after they happened. Since
that time, and for as many years before as the
oldest sailing man in Brisbane can remember
{over forty years), there has never been, a fatal-
ity in connect ion with sailing regattas o* other
sailing races either in the river or bay. And
yet some timid parents object to their darling
boys going sailing because it is “so dangerous.”

Lord Brassey and the Sunbeam.
It makes very interesting reading to scan the
cutting from the Courier under date 29th July.
1887, in reference to Lord Brassey and the Sun-
beam. The following should suffice:—
*’Tlie Sunbeam weighed anchor at 1.30 p.m.
yesterday for England, via Rockhampton. Cook-
town. and Torres Straits. Shortly before she
departed, however, a party, consisting of the
Hon. E. B. Forrest and the Committee of the
Brisbane Sailing Club, Messrs. R. Earle, H. G.
Bourne, J. Gair, AV. F. Cameron, R. H. Lawson,
and G. E. Alarkwell, with AV. J, Morley as a
member of the Club and in his capacity of
newspaper scribe, boarded the Sunbeam
for the purpose of presenting a beautifully
arranged address, which was described in yester-
day's issue. The visitors were received by Miss
Brassey, in the absence of Lord and Lady
Brassey. who had not yet returned from Gov-
ernment House, and the hospitality of the yacht,
was extended to them in the interval. As soon as
Lord and Lady Brassey arrived on board the
presentation was made in the reading room by
the IToo. E. B. Forrest, Vice-Commodore of the
Club, who, after apologising for the absence of
the Commodore, Sir Thomas Mellwraith. said:—
T-I 1?T O R T O F TIT K K. Q. T. C.


w My Lord, you see before you a few members
of the Brisbane Sailing Club. Our object is to
hand you an address practically of welcome to
these shores. It is addressed to you on the
Sunbeam, and as it is very short 1 may be per-
mitted to read it to you. It is as follows:
£ The Members of the Brisbane Sailing Club
desire to offer you a welcome to Queensland
waters. To everyone interested in yachting it
is a source of satisfaction to find one of the
representative .yachtsmen of England endeavour-
ing to establish the fact that yachting is some-
thing more than a pleasant pastime; it un-
doubtedly extends to the wider sphere of use-
fulness. That you may have a prosperous
voyage round the world is the earnest hope of
the Club. Brisbane, 27th July, 1887.”
Then followed the usual talkee, talkee, and I
presume, more hospitality

A matter of interest may be said to be the
meeting of certain gentlemen on Monday, the
24th June, 1895, at the Longreaeh Hotel (situ-
ated then where the West Picture Show now
stands), Mr. W. Stephens, in the chair,
and the formation of a new club to be called
the City of Brisbane Sailing Club, with Mr. G-.

Nclder as lion- Secretary. The Club had its
first opening on Saturday, the 31st of August,
the venue being the South Brisbane Reach of
the River, with the Otter as flagship. Mr. J.
Beale (then Government Printer), as Commo-
dore, led the fleet in. the yacht Isabel. The
Q.G.S. Lucinda was also there with a Govern-
ment House party on board, including His
Excellency Rear Admiral Bridge.
The America Cup.
It may also perhaps be of interest to read this
extract, as another reminiscence, though not a
local one:—
THE AMERICA GUP.
Those interested in the recent contest between Lord
Lunraven’s yacht Valkyrie 111 and the American yacht
Defender, for the historic prize, the America Cup,
the Defender winning the first race,
the Valkyrie the second on a foul which caused the race
to be awarded to the Defender, while in the third
the Defender sailed over the course alono, tho
Valkyrie refusing to start owing to alleged serious in-
terference in the previous race by the many excursion
steamers which followed the racing.
I merely add that the event took place in
September, 1895, over a course of fifteen miles
to windward and return.
A Curious Episode in Sport.
Here let me refer to a rather curious episode
in sport and connected with sailing. On Mon-
day, the 16th December, 1895, before His
Honour, Judge Paul, a case was heard as
186
HiST O R Y 0 F THE R. Q. Y. C.


under ‘‘Nalder v. Wheeler and Others, ” mem-
bers of the Committee of the City of Bris-
bane Sailing Club—-an action for the re-
covery of the sum of £6/6/-, being the first
prize offered by the said Club for a handicap
race held in the Milton Reach on the 28th
September. It appeared that the plaintiff,
Nalder, Lad entered his boat, the Waihora, for
a sailing race, and claimed that he had won it,
but the umpire, owing to an alleged foul during
the race between the Hibiscus and the Wai-
hora, had awarded the race to the Brit-
annia. The owner of the Waihora con-
tended that the Hibiscus had made a false
start, in not crossing the starting line, and could
not be regarded as a boat in the race. The
merits of the race, however, were not gone into,
the plaintiff relying particularly on the fact
that there was no rule in the programme provid-
ing that the decision of the umpire should be
final. Moreover, that the umpire, Mr. Oolelough,
had stultified himself by giving contradictory
decisions, and that he seemed to have acted on
the judgment of the Committee, more than naif
of whom were engaged sailing the race and
therefore interested persons.
The defence; v.as that the appointment of Mr.
Col dough as umpire had been, duly recorded
in the minute hook, and that th° race was com-
peted for under the Yacht Racing Association
Rules, which provided that the decision of the
flag ofiicer or umpire who had charge of the sail-
n i s t a r y o ■■■> r ]i j: r. d y. c.


ing could be referred to the Sailing Commit Lee of
the Council of the Association. Therefore, the
plaintiff had not exhausted the means at hia
command to get redress if he were entitled to
any.
His Honour, Judge Paul, after hearing evi-
dence, deferred decision, bat later on in the
week his judgment was given in language as be-
low;- -His Honour, Judge Paul, gave a deferred
decision of interest to committees or organisers
of sporting events. The Committee of the City
of Brisbane Sailing Club had been sued for the
amount of a prize. The plaintiff’s boat had
passed the winning line first, but the umpire
disqualified the boat in consequence of a foul
during the first thrash up the Milton Reach.
The plaintiff based his claim to the prize on
the ground that the matter of disqualification
rested with the Committee, but primarily because
in the advertised programme it was not stated
that the decision of the umpire would be final.
The defendant Committee, however, proved by
a record in the minute-book of the Club that
an umpire had beer appointed, and Ills Honour,
accepting Tie fact, said that the plaintiff had
competed with that Knowledge. He held that
necessarily the decision of the umpire was final
and gave a verdict for the defendants.
A Bay Accident.
in the year 1904 a sad accident occurred in
Moreton Bay to a boat leaving Wynnum

for Cleveland, whereby valuable lives were lost,
the survivors being on the bottom of an up-
turned boat for a day and a night, eventually
getting aground on the St. Helena shallows. A
public meeting was called at the rooms of the
R.Q.Y.C. at which your Commodore presided,
the room being completely tilled, the date being
Ist March, 1904. A long discussion took place,
it being eventually decided to appoint a com-
mittee of three members each from the Royal
Queensland Yacht Club, Brisbane Flying
Squadron, and the Brisbane Dingy Sailing
Club to deal with the matter and make a
report to a later meeting. Many meetings
of the Committee were held, and eventu-
ally a report, under date 15th July, 1904, pre-
sented to a meeting of yachtmen, irrespective
of clubs, was unanimously adopted. What good
eventually the report did is very hard for me to
say, but I and others interviewed Sir Arthur
Morgan, the then Premier, with the result
that later a boat was kept on hand at Wynnura,
under the careful eye of Mr. Mat. Colclough,
and was there for some time for use in case of
emergency, but what has now become of it. is
hard for me to say.

forgetting a good pal—a good pal who was kind
to me in the yachting circles of Sydney and
who has enjoyed, with his crew, the hospital-
ity of the R.Q.Y.C. in Brisbane. I refer to
Walter Marks, the Commodore of the Royal
Prince Alfred Yacht Club of Sydney. I look
with kindly eye on a certain card, and in
justice to the Prince Alfred Club of Sydney
copy the same, this being the reading thereof:—
Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club,
Club Rooms, May 29th, 1908.
Dear Sir,
The Officers and Committee of the R.P.A.Y.C.
desire to welcome the Commodore of the Royal Queens-
land Yacht Club at a friendly gathering of members
of this Club, on Monday evening next, the Ist June, at
Mr. Saunder ’s motor-yacht Buri.
Your attendance on this occasion is particularly
requested.
The 11 Australia' ’ Orchestra will play during the
evening, and vocal items will be given by members and
others. —Yours faithfully,
G. H. SCARR,
Secretary.
Friendly Club member who reads, let me say
this —I was in attendance; it was a good even-
ing, and six o ’clock closing was not in the minds
of sensible persons then. I return the feeling
of kindness shown me that evening, and give
Walter Marks’s log of the Culwulla’s trip to
Brisbane:—
CULWULLA'S VOYAGE TO BRISBANE. -
Saturday, April 20, 1912.
All stores, etc., being stowed, and the crew aboard,
the moorings in Rushcutter’s Bay were cast off at 2.50
p.m., and a start made for Brisbane, 500 miles North,
solely for the purpose of paying our respects to Com-
modore T. Weisby and the members of the Royal
Queensland Yacht Club.

The crew for the voyage were my chief mate for
some 15 years, W. Balgarno, who also voyaged with me
from Hobart to Melbourne, P. Usher, one of the Cul-
wulla’s racing crew, Travers Black, my forward hand
in Isea, and A. Campbell, one of the finest paid hands
I ’ve ever sailed with, and who for some time was master
of the famous 40-tonner ‘ 1 Bloodhound ’ ’ in English
waters.
When steering down the harbour we were surrounded
by a fleet of yachts and motor yachts, who kept us
busy answering the various signals. We replied to the
numerous farewell signal guns by a similar method,
and took farewell near North Head of Sayonara (P.
Ross) and Messrs. Sayer and Albert’s Rawhiti, the
last two of the sailing fleet to see us out to sea, as also
Mr. Saunder’s motor-yacht Euri.
On reaching the open sea a fair lump and steady
E.N.E. wind was encountered. North Head was abeam
at 4 p.m. Course set from Norah Head, Nx E. Sea
watches arranged' —4 hours on and 4 hours off —and
kept throughout. Barometer, 30.20.
6.3s.—Barranjoey Lighthouse abeam to the W.
11.35 p.m.—Norah Head abeam, bearing W. The
wind had gone around to a steady easterly. Course,
N.N.E. Making good progress, with dry decks and
the promise of a quick voyage. It was my desire, if
possible, to put up a record for a sailing vessel.
Sunday, April 21.
2.25 a.m. —Nobby's Head lighthouse was brought
abeam about six miles off, with the wind blowing a fresh

drop.
3.35 a.m.—Heavy clouds banking up in the N.,
with vivid lightning, so decided to douse topsail and
change jibs to Ho. 3.
6,15 a.m.—The storm came to nothing but heavy
rain, and what light wind there was broke the yacht
away to N.E. by N. Slow progress; at times hardly
steerage way.
8.45 a.m. —Port Stephens abeam. For the last
two hours had simply crawled up to light. Signals
were made and promptly answered by the signal-master
on the headland. Wind light N.W., smooth sea.

2.15 p.m. —Charlotte Head abeam quarter mile off.
Wind light S.S.E. Lovely day, with smooth sea, but
the barometer falling made us anxious.
3.30 p.m.—At last we had a taste of what was
coming, and a? I thought, a hard southerly. In order
to press on set full sail ana squaresail. Yacht making
great pace —10 knots. Course N-half-E., but the sea
wag making every minute with the yacht pooping
rather badly. Set up the water-tight cockpit cover,
and made all secure. Barometer 29.95; still dropping.

ing great guns from the south. Sea still making. Pros-
pects of a dirty night ahead, so took in mainsail —a
difficult task under such conditions, but the ciew never
tarred a hair, and had the sail stowed home on the
crutch securely lashed down,

at this light for some time when in the vicinity, but no
notice taken of it. Running under square-sail and

fashion, although the steering was most difficult,
Cou me N.N.E. Speed, 10 knots.
7.15 p.m. —Diamond Head abeam. Very dark
night. Huge sea now running before a gale from the
south. Anxious rime, but we were encouraged by the
prospects of putting up a fine time for the distance if
we could continue running before it with safety.
9.15 p.m.—Tacking Point abeam one and a half
miles off, with the sea moderating under influence of
a touch of W. in the breeze. Barometer 30.06'; rising.

Tuesday April 23.
2.40 a.m, —Tweed Heads abeam; still bowling along
with a steady W., on a fairly ernootli sea.
6 a.m. —The outlook at daybreak was indeed a
dismal one on emeging from the cabin out into the
cockpit. Wind now almost a gale from the south.
Huge seas were towering astern, and at times breaking
heavily on the counter and pooping into the cockpit.
The conditions were such as to necessitate the immediate
■ eduction of canvas. First, the throat halyards were
eased up, and as at 8.30 a.m. it had hardened into a
gale, we were forced to take in the mainsail. Again
this difficult task was splendidly and quickly performed
by the crew. It must not be forgotten that this yacht
is but 9ft. in beam and without life-lines or rail to give
a feeling of safety under the most ordinary conditions,
let alone these.
Under the jib alone she was wanting the pace to
give security from the rollers towering astern, so
three reefs were put in the squaresail, and up it went.
The yacht now tore along at 11 knots on a course of
N.W., to bring the land closer, as at this time we were
about 15 miles off.
9.30 a.m. —Point Lookout abeam. Conditions the
same, but yacht behaving splendidly. Course, N.N.W.,
for Cape Moreton. Barometer, 30.12.
Rous Channel entrance abeam, and we soon ap-
preciated the advice of the Queensland yachtsman not
to attempt this bar, as the seas were breaking badly.
Hoisted signals, but were too far off to be seen.
When approaching Cape Moreton we had a most
sensational experience, and one we are never likely to
forget. The yacht had just ‘ ‘ shot a breaker/ ’ and
instead of stopping for the next sea astern to pick her
up she raced on to tbs huge wave, ahead, and shot into
the hollow in front of it, some 10ft. deep, and sheered
clean through the top of the wave which formed the
trough, but came out magnificently, covered with water
and spray almost to the, erosstrees. Dalgarno, Black,
and Usher were forward of the mast at the time, and
how they escaped being washed overboard can best be
told by themselves.
The storm-sail, close reefed, was now bent for
rounding the headland. This was abeam at 1 p.m.,
making the time 69 hours out from Sydney Heads, a
distance of 450 miles. T was subsequently informed
by Pilot Murchic that this was easily a record for any
vessel under sail between these ports. Signals were
•exchanged and the pilot taken aboard in the calm water
under the headland.
