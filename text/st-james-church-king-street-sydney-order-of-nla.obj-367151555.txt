ORDER OF SERVICE
Hymn
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me:
Still all my song would be,
55 Nearer, my God, to Thee, —
Nearer to Thee!
Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me.
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
ADDRESS
Pastor Ake Sundelin.
Hymn
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee.
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
ADDRESS
Mr. Bo AIaNDER, Charge d’Affaires of Sweden
