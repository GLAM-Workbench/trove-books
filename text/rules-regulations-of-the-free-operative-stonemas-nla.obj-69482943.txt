PREFACE.
In presenting to you these Kules for your
guidance, we would strongly urge upon you to
give them your most serious consideration, as
they are the standard by which your conduct
will be regulated ; it is by them you will be
taught the duty you owe to the Society of
which you have become a member. We would
charge you to be exemplary in the discharge of
any duty that you may be called upon to per-
form, by never countenancing any act that may
have a tendency to subvert the peace and good
order of the Society. Let prudence direct
you, Temperance chasten you, and equal jus-
tice to all, be the rule and guide of your
actions. Wo have endeavoured to avoid as
much as possible any arbitrary measures, such
as Strikes, &c., only so far as necessary to
maintain and support the efficiency and well-
being of the Society.
VV hatever opinions may be formed of the
efficacy of Strikes as one of the Bulwarks of
Labour, every reasonable man will neverthe-
less avail himself of any other system of de-
fence if it can be shown to be more effectual.
? Strikes (says a popular writer) are but the
tactics of individual warfare, which must be
changed as soon as they cease to be efficacious,
and to stick with a blind pertinacity to any,
particular method not warranted by success


only shews that we have lost sight of the ob-
ject for which we are contending.? The end
we seek to obtain is, for every member _to re-
ceive a fair share of the profits of his own
industry, we want his intelligence and self-
respect to be increased by lifting him beyond
the reach of want, and elevate his position in
society.
We do not seek to make proselytes by co -
ercing them to join us ; we do not wish to re-
sort to the expediency of fines to increase our
numbers, but we have endeavoured to make
our laws so attractable, that men shall not only
be glad to join it, but that they shall feel an
interest and a pleasure in lending a helping
and willing hand to put their shoulders to the
wheel and help forward our Car of Progress.
These are the motives which have actuated
us, and by paying proper attention to the
Chairman, and due respect to all its officers,
our Lodge-meetings will be opened in order,
conducted harmoniousy, and end in good fel-
lowship with all,
