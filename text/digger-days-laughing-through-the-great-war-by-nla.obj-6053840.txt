DIGGER DAYS
LAUGHING THROUGH THE- GREAT WAR

THE WAR had many moods —and when we reflect on
those &rim days, those who went through their
horrors are anxious to sieve the happier moments
from the painful memories of the muddling through of
1914-1918.
This selection of drawings, reprinted by courtesy
of the Proprietors of “Smiths Weekly,” is my humble
effort to carry on the portrayal of Di&&er wit in which
there came a break when my comrade of the campaign left
to join our old “cobbers” who “went west.” And so,
to the memory of Cecil Laurence Hartt I dedicate this book.
FRANK DUNNE.
APPRECIATION
For better for worse, in sickness or in health, until death parted
us from some of the best mates a man ever had — the War, taking
it by and was largely a jest. The humour was a bit strained
sometimes, rather &rim sometimes, but it was always there, other-
wise we could never have carried on.
Even those for whom those four years are nothing but
a bitter memory because of their own personal losses, even they
must find some consolation in the fact that men died with a lau^h
on their lips, not the lau&h of mockery, but the lau&h that refused
to admit defeat even in death.
Here, then, are the lau&hin& memories of an army that
laughed its way to victory. In these sketches Di££er Frank Dunne
has recaptured the spirit of the A.I.F. as I knew it, recaptured it
even as Cecil Hartt did with those illustrated Digger jokes that
first helped to make “Smith’s Weekly” the soldiers’ testament.
When your youngsters ask: “What did you do in the
Great War, Daddy?” —Show ’em this.

First Digger: “Fritz must have tons of ammunition.”
Second Digger: “Well, he’s sharin’ it with us now, ain’t he, yer greedy cow?”
First Digger (first
time in): “What sort
of shells is he sending
over?”
Second Digger:
“Everything but tor-
toise, oyster, and egg
shells.”
Sarcastic Q.M.: “ ’Course the wars give yer
corns. Don’t we all get ’em —even me?”
Candid Digger : “ But —blast yer ! — I’ve gotta
walk on mine!”
DIGGER DAYS


First Digger: “Any’ow, our guns
are giving Fritz a taste of ’ee’s own
medicine now.”
Second Digger: “Well, all I ’ope
is that the blanky dose repeats on
’im often.”
“Who’s at the other
end?”
“He says: ‘An officer
and a gentleman.’ ”
“ Well, tell them
that they can’t both
speak at once.”
Digger: “ One thing about this flamin’ job, yer not afraid of gettin’ the sack.”
DIGGER DAYS


Officer: “Have you shaved this morning?”
Digger: “Yessir.”
Officer : “ Then have another one, and stand a bit
closer to the razor.”
First Digger: “E’s all bull. D’jer
ever ’ear ’im doin’ anythin’ worth
while?”
Second Digger : “ Yair; five hun-
dred 4 onks ’ to me in cold blood, at
poker.”
Disgusted Queens-
lander : “Gripes! I
come thousands of
miles ter get
away from growin’
blasted pineapples, ’en
the lands me
with a pineapple
bomb!”

DIGGER DAYS


Bluey : “ I’ll shoot the next flamin’
Tommy who asks do they call us
4 Diggers.’ ”
“It’s a wonder to me he didn’t get a
slug in the back, the cow.”
“Perhaps he was never at the front.”
Nervy Digger: “I’d give anything to be out of here.”
Sergeant (sick of him): 44 ’Ere’s a bomb; be a blanky
sport and give it all to your bloomin’ self.”
“Betcher five 4 onks ’ they come
down ’eads!”
DIGGER DAYS


New Arrival; “It’s only
the First of November;
what the hell will it be
like on the Fifth?”
First Digger: “What’s
wrong with your mate,
Nugget?”
Second Digger : “ Oh,
he’s been looking on the
Yin-blanc when it was
red!”
Colonel: “What sup-
port would you bombers
need to take that pill-
box?”
Bomber : “ Half a jar
ought to make a proper
job of it.”
DIGGER DAYS


Officer: “Stop! Stop! You’re flooding my dugout!”
Digger: “Well, I can’t pile it up in flamin’ lumps, can I?”
Sergeant: “There’ll be four reinforcements arriving for dinner.”
Q.M.: “Well, tell the cook to put another quart of water in the stew.”
Digger : “ Motors are taking the place of horses in
this war.”
Cook: “How’s that?”
Digger : “ I found a bit of rubber in the stew this
morning.”
DIGGER DAYS


Artillery Officer: “Out
of the way; we are going
to shoot!”
Digger: “Wot at?”
Artillery Officer: “The
ration dump.”
Digger : “ That’s no
ration dump, yer
goat, that’s only me
cbhher!”
Digger (about to go to
outpost): “Why do you
keep remindin’ me to get
the flares up quick when
Fritz opens up?”
N.G.0.: “To give us a
fair go back in the
trench. We’re bettin’ on
what goes up first —you
or the flares.”
Reinforcement: “The
Sergeant seems a callous
cow.”
Digger : “My oath he
is; when Fritz sends
over tear gas it only
makes him laugh.”
DIGGER DAYS


0.C.: “And why did you overstay your leave?”
Digger: “Just to see what sort of a sport you were.”
First Digger: “To think I
tossed up a good job to
have this war on.”
Second Digger* “Would
you risk it again?”
First Digger: “No blanky
fear. Not even to call tails
on a double-’eaded brown.”
Visiting Brass Hat: “You must have searched many
bombing schools to have discovered such a proficient
bomber.’ 5
Bomber Sergeant: “No; I could tell he had the gift
the first time I saw him slinging bottles at the
‘Jacks.’ ”
DIGGER DAYS


First Digger: “Will
Pongo’s wound be a per-
manent disfigurement ?”
Second Digger: “No;
his pants will hide it.”
Officer: “I hope the men don’t lose their heads in
the next big stunt.”
N.C.O. (absent-mindedly): “What’d be the use if
they did ? They’d only get another pack of lousy cows
like we have at present.”
Reinforcement (seeing Verey Light for first time): “Gripes ! Wassat?”
Old Timer : “ Crackers, yer blasted fool. Don’t yer know it’s Empire Day?”
DIGGER DAYS


Sentry: “Halt! Who goes there?”
Digger: “One friend and a coupler flamin’ mules.”

First Digger : “And did the O.C. know that the trench had fallen in?”
Second Digger : “No; we had to dig him out to tell him.”

communiques.”

DIGGER DAYS


First Digger: “Did that sheila you wrote to, pick

Second Digger (just back from Blighty): “My oath!
Every cent I ’ad the night I met ’er.”

er?”
Darky : “ What kind ?
D’yer think the y’v e

in tins?”
Officer: “Have you sufficient volunteers for the raid
to-night ?”
Sergeant: “No; you’re just in time for it.”
Tommy (old sweat): “You fellows ain’t real soldiers. Why, I was with Kitchener at Khartoum.”
Digger: “You should have been with him on the “Hampshire.”
DIGGER DAYS


Digger: “ These pants
are tighter than me
skin.”
Q.M.: “How the blazes
can they be tighter than
your skin?”
Digger: “Well, I can
sit down in me skin, but
I can’t in these.”
Affable Padre: “Hello,
my son, been kicking
over the traces again?”
Dilapidated Digger:
“No, Padre; I accident-
ally kicked over a jar of
rum.”
Newcomer : “Do you
think it’s me that’s the
Jonah?”
Old Timer: “Think it?
Huh! It’s the smell ’uv
the whale still on
yer that’s alwuz drawin’
the crabs on us.”
DIGGER DAYS


Digger (to Q.M.) : “ Could
yer give me another pair of
boots to fit inside these so’s
they’ll fit.”
Digger: “I haven’t drawn a pay for months, and
still my book’s in debt.”
Pay Officer: “What can I do?”
Digger: “ ’Elp me file a schedule. See if the cows’ll
accept two days in the quid.”
Bull Artist (who isn’t going over): “Now, men, in pointing out our objective and how we’ll take it, have I over-
looked anything?”
Digger (who is): “Yes; it looks as if you’ve forgotten there’s a flamin’ big team of Fritzes between here and
there!”
DIGGER DAYS


Officer: “But why can’t you sleep at night?”
Digger: “Well, there’s a bloke in our hut who snores the
same tune as the gas horns.”
“I once saved a Hun’s life.”

“What! —Fired at him and missed him, I suppose.”
Fagged-out Digger: “ ’Ow’d a lovely double-’eader whiskv

Indignant Padre: “You’re forgetting yourself, aren’t
you?” :
Digger: “’Struth, yes! I wuz forgettin’ a bonzer long,
frothy beer for a chaser.”
Broad Scot (Base Instructor); “Tha’s no the wee ah tould ye tae dee it!”

First Digger: “There are no flies on me.”
Second Digger: “No; but there are fleas and that’s a
ruddy sight worse.” '
C. 0.: “Can’t you realize that the M.P.’s are only doing
their duty?”
Digger (up for assaulting “Jack”): “Yes; but the cows
always forget that if it wasn’t for the likes of me they’d
be out of a job.”
M.O. (puzzled): “You want a sleeping draught to rub
into your skin?”
Digger: “Yes; I reckon if I can get them flamin’ chats
to snore off, I’ll be able to have a bit of a doze meself.”
Second Digger: “The poor coot ain’t a s oldier; ’e’s a flamin’ Aunt Sally!”
First Digger : “ Chalky’s bowled
over again. That’s his seventh
wound.”

Host (fox hunting): “I say, Diggah, the usual cry is ‘Tally Ho!’ —not ‘There
goes the ruddy cow!’ ”
“They only seem to give
you rum before you go
over the top.”
“Well, ain’t the rum
worth it?”
First Sniper: “ You
were pretty sudden on
that poor coot.”
Second Sniper: “I did-
n’t like the way ’e wuz
lookin’ at me.”
First Sniper : “ How
was he lookin’?”
Second Sniper:
‘‘Straight along the bar-
rel of ’ee’s rifle,”
DIGGER DAYS


Well-meaning Padre: “Honestly, I don’t see
how you can get out of the M.P.’s assault
charge.”
Hardened Culprit: “Don’t worry, Padre ; I
got no flamin’ intentions of trying to beat the
cows honestly.”
First Digger: “’E’s a
liar! I never said you
was wooden-beaded.”
Second Digger: “Well,
what did you say?”
First Digger: “To tell
yer to keep yer blanky
head down, so’s a flamin’
swarm of white ants
wouldn’t get loose if
they plugged yer.”
The Near-Rainbow (Reg. No. Umpteen Thou-
sand) : “I wonder if I’ll ever bump into a shell with
my number on it?”
The Original (Reg. No. 15): “D’yer think there’d
be room on a ruddy shell to put it on?”
N.C.O. : “ How about
you pair going out to
look for Roozy ? He got
lost on patrol.”
Digger: “Like ’ell we
will. Shove ’ee’s rum
issue on the parapet;
e’ll flamin’ soon smell
’ee’s way home.”
DIGGER DAYS


First Digger: “I suppose we’ll pay dearly
for this blasted war if ever we get back
’ome!”
Second Digger: “Strikes me some of us
are paying our ruddy whack now stayin’ off
that last shillin’ with every crime we get,”
Doctor (examining
wounded R.S.M.): “Dash
it all, he wouldn’t be
knocked about like this
from just a bullet wound
in the leg.”
Stretcher Bearer: “It’s
’ee’s own fault. The cow
would keep spoutin’ ’ee’s
wound wasn’t crook
enough to leave the line
with.”
Scotty: “None of my pay is ever wasted, any’ow.”
The Wild Colonial: “Ain’t it? Yer made a
allotment to your wife, didn’t yer?”
First Digger: “There must have been a hell of a
row at the War Office last night.”
Second Digger: “How’s that?” (
First Digger: “They took away my stripes again
this morning,”
DIGGER DAYS


The Genial Brass Hat: “Things pretty quiet to-day, eh?”
The Candid Digger: “Yair, what with the birds singin’ ’en you blokes strollin’ ’round, a man’d hardly know there
wuz a war on!”
First Digger: “A Fritz
in front talks bonzer
English.”
Second Digger: “ ’Ow’d
yer find out?”
First Digger: “I called

did ’e say?”
First Digger: “Bother
you!”
“Did you tell the G.O. the meat was so tough that you
couldn’t cut it with your bayonet?”
“Yes; and the —— crimed me for not looking after my
bayonet!”
DIGGER DAYS

the nip.”

humming-bird.”

it you’re not pastin’ Fritz?”
Gunner: “We don’t shoot,
choom, ’less ’e do.”
Digger: “Ain’t yer wastin’ yer
time with guns when yer could
have the blighter on at Snakes
and Ladders?”
Digger: “Hey. Fritz, get up and run for it. I’m not used to sittin’ shots.”
DIGGER DAYS


First Digger: “Who the blazes are these plenipotentiaries?”
Second Digger: “Some flamin’ cows they’ve dragged in to prolong the war.”
“Why do Scots wear kilts?”
/
“Because their feet are too flamin’ big to get them
through the legs of ordinary trousers.”
Digger (to Q.M.):
‘‘Call this a fit? I call
it a flamin’ seizure.”
DIGGER DAYS


First Digger: “I wonder if the bloke who invented rum ever got knighted.”
Second Digger: “I don’t suppose ’e ever knew.”
First Digger: “What is base ingratitude?”
Second Digger: “Well, if you’re refused a pass
to go down to the bull-ring that would be base
ingratitude.”
Officer: “Did you pick up anything use-
ful at the bombing school?”
Digger : “My oath!
When they raided the
two-up ring I ’opped
down on a coupler
double-headed browns.”
First Digger: “ What’s this
espirit de corps the R.S.M.’s always
talkin’ about?”
Second Digger : “ Bet it’s some
poor cow’s rum the blighter’s
thieved while ’e was at Corps
Headquarters.”

Private Isaacsteen : “ ’Struth, Serg., look at all the gas that goes to one of my sniff's compared to one of ’ees!”
First Digger: “If ever I get killed I’ll leave all me
chats to the Q.M.”
Second Digger: “Do yer wanter get square with the
Quarter bloke?”
First Digger: “No; I wanter get square with them
flamin’ chats!”
Sergeant Clerk: “How much are you going
to allot your wife?”
Digger: “Five quid a week.”
Sergeant Clerk: “Don’t be silly!”
Digger: “Well, you started it, yer cow!”
Cook: “What’s wrong with the bacon, anyway? Strikes me
you’ve got blanky little to growl about.”
Digger: “Too ruddy right, we ’ave; and that’s just what we’re
going lousy about.”
DIGGER DAYS


“Gripes! What are
yer doin’ a bunk for?
If yer name’s on it,
you’ll get it.”
“I hear the Old Man’s going back to Australia!”
“But ’e’s already been ’ome once.”
“Yes; but ’e’s got a bar to his Bowler Hat.”
M. 0.: “What’s wrong with you?”
Digger: “I’m chatty, sir.”
M. 0.: “That’s nothing—we all get chatty.”
Digger: “It may be nithing to you, but give them
anither night at me and there won’t be anything left.”
*• v *
First Digger (at Base Gamp) : “How do you
find things ’ere, Dig?”
Second Digger: “We don’t find things! We
lose things. Why, ’ere they’d pinch the blanky
bridle off a nightmare !”
DIGGER DAYS


Officer: “A man like him without any nerves shouldn’t be
wanted on ration fatigue.”
N.C.0.: “No blanky fear, he ain’t. He always carries the rum.”
M. 0.: “ There’s a strange fluttering in your chest that I’m
not too sure of.”
Digger: “ Before yer raise me ’opes, Doc., how about making
sure some blasted chats ain’t sparrin’ under your ear-phones.”
Babbler: “I’ll have you
blokes know I served two
years as officers’ cook,
and was wounded twice.”
Digger : “ It’s a blink-
ing wonder they didn’t
flamin’-well kill you!”
Bluey’s rum dial.
First Digger: “I dunno.”
Second Digger : “ Dunno what ?”
First Digger: “Oh, I dunno.”

Recruit: “Yes; I like my eggs fried on both
sides.”
DIGGER DAYS


The Medical Orderly: “You don’t look to me to
have trench feet.”
The Lead-swinger: “I ’aven’t! Me feet alwuz
keep walkin’ me out of them damn places.”
Digger: “I feel all right, except me nerves are all
shot ter ’ell,”
Q.M.: “It’s the Doc. you want to see, not me.”
Digger (very hopefully): “P’haps if you’d gimme
somethin’ ter make me feel shot ter ’ell me nerves
’ud be all right.”
Officer: “I want none of your back chat.”
Digger: “Well, take one from the front.”
Nervy Digger: “Any deep dugouts around here?”
Sentry: “Only one with the stairs blown in. But
if you slid down you’d never get up again.”
Nervy Digger: “ Who the hell’s talking about
cornin’ up again?”
Picquet: “Put on your mask, you fool. Don’t you

M. 0.: “Yes.”
Boozey (hopefully) : “Well, is there
any hope of a rum to save it turning
into a shipwreck?”
CFhe Grub Spoiler : “ D’yer

same as yer ruddy self ?”
