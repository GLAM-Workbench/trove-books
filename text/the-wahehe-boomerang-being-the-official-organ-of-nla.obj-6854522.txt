brutal and autocratic military caste
of Prussia a smashing blow, is now
returning home.
The passenger list would appear
to me to peculiarly lend itself to
the happening of humorous incidents
of which, no doubt, the Editor and
his correspondents will take full
advantage.
The instituting of a journal of
this nature is to be commended. It
gives food for thought, affords
amusement to many, and opens an
avenue for the display of literary
talent, which would otherwise re-
main latent.
Good luck to the “Wahehe
Boomerang !” May it flourish and
embrace the whole ship in its cir-
cuitous flight. I am sure that those
responsible for launching it will see
that there is no wounding, no matter
how unintentional, of the suscepta-
bilities of any of our small com-
munity.
GRANVILLE RYRIL.
From Chaplain-Lieutenant-Colonel
R. W. Rolland,
Senior Chaplain on H.M.A.T
“Wahehe.”
Along with my fellow-Chap-
lains, I look forward fearlessly to
the shock of the “Boomerang,” in
spite of the foreknowledge that it
will make a distinct impression.
Some of us will pass this way
again, but none of us under similar
conditions. We shall not a second
time have the same “home thoughts
from the Sea,” and even if the sun
should shine as fiercely on another
voyage, never again could we ex-
pect as honeyed a moonlight.
Therefore, I feel that the pass-
ing thoughts and humours of this
unique journey are well worth the
longer life that print can give and
I wish the ‘‘Boomerang” and its
staff, under whatever difficulties
they may labour, a success that will
satisfv even them.
L. W. HOLLAND.
OURSELVES.
“I Go Out —to Return.”
It is our aim to make this paper
secure more than a passing-place in
the affections of its readers and to
render it, not only a mere souvenir
of the voyage, but also a journal
which can be read, both now and in
after years, for its intrinsic merit.
How far we have succeeded —or
shall succeed —in this ambition is
for our readers to declare ; but at
least we are sure that in passing
judgment they will neither hypo—
nor hyper —critical.
The title which we have chosen
for the paper needs no apology. It
is apt, euphonious and distinctively
Australian. Like the “Boomeranp'
c**>
the majority of us who travelled on
the “Wahehe” have been flunp* far
and strangely by the Master
Thrower —Fate, and after many a
wide detour and sudden swoop we
have at last returned from whence
we came. It is with us. as with
It is with us, as with
those wanderers of the olden days —
the happy haven where we have so
often longed to be has claimed us,
“and so we journeved Madly to our
J -/ n j
home.”
We left the Old Land with re-
gret. I here can be no parting,
worthy of remembrance, without its
touch of sorrow —and, least of all,
from those ancestral isles of ours,
where we have found so many
friends and passed such happy
hours. Nor can the closing of the
Great Adventure leave us unsad-
dened or unstirred. We scarce
can realise that it is all over; that
the life that has known us so long
shall know us no more for ever.
In a sense, and with all humility,
may we not dare to apply to our
selves the magnificent egotism of
Cl o
Saint Paul and claim that we, too,
have met with wild beasts at Ephe-
sus and fought the good fight? God
o o o
grant that we may “finish our course
with joy.”
Thanks are due, and are hereby
most gratefully tendered, to the
veritable platoon of contributors
and helpers who have enabled us to
bring this journal to the light of
publication. It would be invidious
to mention any by name; nor is such
mention necessary; for the majority
of the contributed matter appears
over the names of the persons res-
ponsible for it, and in those cases
where this is not so, the anonymity
of the contributor would have to be
respected in any event. There is,
as in the! case of all rules, one ex-
ception in this regard-—we think our
subscribers would like to know that
the beautifully designed and exe-
cuted cover, with which we are
privileged to clothe the paper, and
which bears no signature, is the
work of Warrant Officer H. Wool!-
cott, of the War Records Section.
We feel sure that all readers of the
paper will join with us in acknow-
ledging the merit of the work and
the skill of the worker.
We have gleaned contributions
from every field of activity on tlie
ship, from all ranks, and from all
classes. To such an extent, indeed,
that we would ask any contributor
who may find his ‘‘copy” more or
less drastically edited, to remember
that we have tried to pursue the
policy of allowing as many pens and
pencils to assist in the compilation
of the “Boomerang” as is compat-
ible with the literary and artistic
standard we have set up.
We believe that every line
whether drawn or written
which appears in this paper was
actually so drawn or written for its
pages by some member of the ship's
complement of passengers or staff.
But it is not easy to check matters
of this kind under the circum-
stances, and if by accident any pir-
acy or plagiarism has been perpe-
trated we can only apologise and
promise not to do it again.

A “WAHEHE” ALPHABET.
o
By “Nestor.”
A— is the land of the clear Southern
Sea —
Australia, Australia, where
soon we shall be.
B—is the Boat and the Bay of
Biscay
Which belied its repute 1
am thankful to say.
C’s the Canteen where they’ll sell
you, I think,
A stiff lemonade —if you
really must drink.
D is the Deck where we two-step
at night
And nobody minds if there
isn’t much light.
E—is the note-takin’ Editor man,
Who’ll put you all into his rag
if he can.
F’s the French class we should none
of us miss
“To pronounce the word
Tine,’ pout your lips like
a kiss.”
G— stands for Gibraltar we wanted
to see
But passed it at night when
’twas dark as could be.
H is the would-be-a-Huraourist
bore
He’s bad enough single, but
married —oh, Lor’!
I—ds for Isaacs, who is earning
great fame
At the Y.M.C.A. —as you’d
guess by his name.
J —is for Jenkins, so sauve of
address,
But a bit of a “sweep,” I am
bound to confess.
K—stands for King’s Regulations—
O.V.—
Thank Heaven, they bother us
little at sea!
L—are the Ladies —‘‘First Class”
all the lot.
God bless the whole bunch of
’em—married or not!
M's for Mackenzie, who runs the
whole ship,
And who’s doing his best to
make pleasant our trip.
N's for the Nautical terms which
we hear
“She’s 'aft’ —er him ; really,
so for’ard, my dear!”
O —is the Orderly Officer, who
Goes round every morning in-
specting the “stoo.”
P—is the Paper we’re trying to run
I’m afraid ’twill prove stodge- —
still, it might be good fun.
Q's for the Queue at the bath, all
enraged
At the sign always there,
which is Hun for “Engaged.”
R —is the Run that we bet on each
day
I suppose some one wins—
but I really can’t say.
S —is the School where they play
“little gamete”
With singular rules and some
very strange names.
T—is the Time, which has gone “on
the tear”
Till my watch has drawn out
of the race in despair.
U —is the Upper Boat Deck, where
the moon
On these warm summer
nights simply asks us to
spoon.
V’s the Vexation of spirit we know
When a third party comes there
and spoils the whole show.
W’s Wahehe —Hun built —missed
the “Bus” !
For along came the War,
and gave her to us.
X—stands for ’Xcuse, an article
made
For use when you find that
you’re late on parade.
Y’s for the Youngsters who round
the Decks race
In the list of our imports
they take the first place.
And Z is our Zeal —we don’t shirk
any work;
But that’s, I suppose, 'cos
there’s little to shirk.
BY LOG AND LIMERICK.
(A Diary of the Voyage, by S.E.N.)
The Distances and Positions are given
as at Twelve (Noon) each day.
Oct. 30th, 1919, (Thursday) — Left Til-
bury 4 p.m., with full complement of
passengers. Weather fine. Off
Folkestone at midnight.
A damsel up Tilbury way.
When she saw our Ship get under
weigh,
Remarked with a wink—•
“Me’ art’s broke—l don’t think!
Thank ’Evin, they’re going to-day!
Oct. 31st (Friday). —Off Portland Bill,
Dorset, at 9.30 a.m. (50.25 N., 3.14
W., 250 miles).
A certain young lady of Dorset
Said stoutly—“l’ll not wear a corset,
Tho’ no figure I’ve got
I’ll be bally well shot
Ere with whalebone and sichlike I’ll
force it.”
Put into Brixham, Devon—famous as
the birthplace of “Abide With Me”—
and dropped Pilot there about mid-day.
There is a young fellow at Brixham
Whose teeth are so loose that to
fix ’em
He uses a paste
Of such horrible taste
That he’s ill for a week when he
sticks ’em.
Off Start Point at 2.45 p.m. and, bear-
ing south, took our last view of Eng-
land. Gradually settling down. Sea
calm, weather fine.
Nov. Ist (Saturday). —'Passed Ushant
Light about 1 a.m. and entered the
Bay of Biscay a little later. Sea
calm, weather fine. (46.38 N., 7.16 W.,
284 miles).
November 2nd. (Sunday). —Passed Cape
Finisterre about breakfast time, thus
completing the crossing of the
famous Bay and having beautiful
weather all the way. Church Parade
11a.m. Coast of Portugal showing
in the distance to port. Raining and
rather boisterous breeze at night,
but sea very little disturbed. (41.50
N., 9.35 W., 308 miles).
A Ma’mselle from Cape Finisterre
Was embraced by an Aussie out
there—
She pretending alarm,
Tried to slip from his arm;
But he cried —“It’s no bon —as you
were!”
Nov. 3rd (Monday). —Good night; ship
rolling a little towards morning.
Passed Cape Roca about 1 a.m.
Passed Cape St. Vincent about noon.
Calm and fine until about 4 p.m.
when a squall of rain blew up. Boat
drill had to be abandoned. Blustery
night, but very little sea. (37.7 N.,
9.10 W., 289 miles).


Nov. 4th (Tuesday). —Passed Gibraltar
about 4 a.m.—too dark to see the
Rock—only the lights on each side
visible. Dull day with fresh follow-
ing breeze and sea till about 2 p.m.
when it grew very calm. (36.11 N.,
3.38 W., 287 miles).
There is a Duenna in Gib.,
Whose mantilla is made like a bib;
With it on her shoulders
She shocks all beholders—
They don’t like the cut of her jib!
Outline of Southern Spain showing
hazily to port about n a.m. Boat drill
at 4 p.m. Very much warmer.
Nov. sth (Wednesday). —At daybreak
North coast of Africa close to star-
board. Steamed along it all day. At
1 p.m. passed Algiers and had a good
view of that city. (36.49 N., 2.27 E.,
297 miles).
A gentle young Jew of Algiers,
As he smothered his Dad, said, with
tears—
“It is bad for his health;
But I’ve needed his wealth
For goodness knows how many years!”
Good concert and conjuring entertain-
ment in saloon after dinner. Night
very warm, many of the men sleeping
on deck. Passed Meridian of Green-
wich. and watches have to be put on
daily from now onwards.
Nov. 6th (Thursday). —Passed Island of
Galeta about noon. Now off Coast
of Tunis. Passed Cape Blanco at 3
p.m., and the town of Bizerta
shortly afterwards.
A beautiful belle of Bizerta
Wore sandals so tight that they
hurt her,
And she gave such loose rein
To her tongue in her pain
That her husband was forced to de-
sert her.
Crossed the Bay of Tunis and passed
Cape Bon about 8 p.m. Magnificent
night—calm and moonlit. At 11.30
passed the Island of Pantalaria. (37.16
N., 8.47 E., 316 miles).
Nov. 7th (Friday).— Sighted Malta on
the starboard bow about breakfast
time, and Sicily in the dim distance
to port a little later. Passed Malta
fairly closely about 10 a.m.
There was a young maiden of Malta
Wiio swore that her love could not
alter;
But by what people saw
While her boy was at war
They think it’s beginning to falter.
Full moon, calm and cloudless. Lec-
ture on Papua in saloon; dances on
promenade and after decks and a con-
cert by the “Diggers” on the well deck,
all proceeding simultaneously. Upper
boat decks largely availed of by star
gazers and others. (36.7 N., 15.2 E.,
300 miles).
Nov. Bth (Saturday). —Still beautifully
fine and calm—no sight of land. At
to a.m. passed s.s. “Neuralia,” a
8.1. boat homeward bound with
troops from India. Sports in the
afternoon—Obstacle Races, Tugs-of-
War, Hallowe’n, and Bun-Eating
Competitions; “Thread the Needle”
Race for ladies, etc., ptc. great
success—thoroughly enjoyed by all
parties, everyone entering thoroughly
into the fun. Debating Society in-
itiated in evening. Another magnifi-
cent moon-light night. (34.42 N.,
20.52 E., 295 miles).
Nov. 9th (Sunday). —Still calm and
fine. Church Services morning and
evening—both well attended. The
day mostly utilised for writing let-
ters. (33.2 N., 26.46 E., 311 miles).
Nov. 10th (Monday). —Coast of Egypt
near Damietfa showed up a little
after breakfast. Arrived Port Said
about noon. General Ryrie and
party embarked. All ashore in after-
noon and evening, viewing town and
making purchases. All aboard again
by midnight; no serious casualties.
(3i-37 N., 31.59 E., 278 miles).
A timid old girl of Port Said
Says of showing her face she’s
afraid—
1 saw it one day
And I certainly say
It’s the kind that lo<'ks best ’neath a
shade!
Nov. nth (Tuesday). —Left Port Said
8 a.m., after coaling and watering
and entered Suez Canal. Service in
commemoration of Armistice Day
at t 1 a.m. Passed several vessels in
Canal, two containing troops re-
turning from India. When we tied
up to allow them to pass some of
the boys had a swim in the Canal.
Ran aground opposite Kantara
Camp and were there about two
hours, through some accident to
steering-gear. Arrived Suez after
midnight. (Steaming through Suez
Canal all day, 87 miles).
There’s a dashing young damsel at
Suez
And her eye as her language as
blue is;
She wears a red fez
And the things that she sez—
W r ell, the only word suitable—
“ Phew!” is.
Nov. 12th (Wednesday). —Left Suez at
5 a.m., Venus, Jupiter, and the
moon making a beautiful trio in
the Eastern sky over the Arabian
shore, Venus being distinctly visible
long after the sun was above the hori-
zon. Steamed down the Gulf of
Suez all day, with the rugged, scor-
ched and desolate coasts of Egypt
and Arabia on either hand. Entered
the Red Sea proper about 8 p.m.
Very close and hazy. Kept Sinai in
sight all day. This is probably the
closest association lots of us will
ever have with the Ten Command-
ments! (28.49 N., 32.58; E., 71 miles—
from Suez).
Nov. 13th (Thursday). —-No sign of land
except dim and distant vistas of
Egypt now and then. Weather very
warm and muggy, sea calm, very
little wind. Fans, ventilators, awn-
ings, baths, all in great demand. De-
bating Society’s first regular debate
in after-saloon. Subject: “Contin-
ental Cafe System versus Australian
‘Pubs’ ” —latter won; good attendance
from all parts pf the ship. Very large
number of passengers sleeping on
deck. (24.39 N., 35.56 E., 30T miles).
Nov. 14th (Friday). —Sailing down Red
Sea all day, no land visible; calm,
fine, very hot. Steering-gear not
working too satisfactorily. Several
of the men unwell to-day. Can it be
the Port Said “Prawns”? (20.28 N.,
38.42 E., 294 miles).
A Porpoise who swam the Red Sea
Was as merry as merry could be,
Till he tried one sad day
With a mine to make play —
And that was the end of his spree!
Nov. 15th (Saturday). —Still doing the
Red Sea stunt. Out of sight of land
all day until 4 p.m., when we passed
the Farsan Archipelago—a lonely
group of sterile islets, better known
as the “Twelve Apostles”—one is
away by himself—possibly Judas!
Sports in the afternoon—pillow-fight-
ing, scratch-pulling, etc., etc., Egg-
and-Spoon Race and “Musical Men”
for ladies—well attended, well car-
ried out. (15.58 N., 41.28 E., 313
miles).
Nov. 16th (Sunday). —Perim Island in
sight, ahead, at dawn. Passed it
about 7 a.m. and a little later cleared
the Straits of Babelmandeb—gener-
ally known as “Hell Gate,” though
the word really means the “Gate of
Tears.” Turned more to the East,
and skirted the South Western Ara-
bian Coast, passing Aden, which we
did not see, about 4 p.m. (12.26 N.,
44.28 E., 295 miles).
'There’s a funny old fisher at Aden
Whose soul with sore sorrow is
laden;
For all he could get
When he last hauled his net,
Was a very old, scaly Mer-Maiden.
Usual Church Services morning and
evening. Fine, breezy day, sea calm,
very much cooler. Number of vessels
passing in both directions.
Nov. 17th (Monday). At dawn the
Guardafui Peninsula was close at
hand on the starboard side. Coasted
along it all day, seeing a whale in the
afternoon, and passed the Cape
shortly after dark, thus seeing our
last of Africa. (12.6 N., 49.35 E., 294
miles).
An Arab on Cape Guardafui,
Found the place so distressingly
dewy,
That he sighed for the air,
Of Arabia, where—
It’s always so pleasantly stewy.
Lecture on China—first of series by
Mr. Butcher on “Australia and its Col-
oured Neighbors.” Cool night. Sea
smooth.
Nov. 18th (Tuesday). —At 4.30 a.m. the
Southern Cross and Pole Star both
visible. At dawn the Island of
Socotra showed up hazily in the
distance to port (North). Passed it
at a great distance at about 9 a.m
Cool, calm and fine all day. Prac-
tically all patients recovered from
their indisposition. (11,22 N., 54.32
E., 301 miles).

The dusky-eyed belles of Ceylon
Will tell you the winter is gone
—lf you’ve somehow forgot
That the weather is hot—-
By the clothes that they haven’t got
Arrived at Colombo 5 p.m. Went
ashore 7.30 p.m. and inspected the town.
Nov. 24th (Monday). —Ashore all day.
Train trip to Kandy—hot, but most
enjoyable—saw the Lake, the Temple
of the Tooth and all the rest.
A captious old Coolie of Kandy
Smash’d his wife with a stone that
was handy;
“For,” he said, with a grin:
“She is not only thin;
But inclined—which is worse—to be
bandy!”
Left Kandy about 4.30 p.m. by train

about 9 p.m.—very hot and dusty.
Nov. 25th (Tuesday). —Ashore all day
seeing the sights of Colombo and

of a swell all night. Crossed the line
at 1.30 p.m. Neptune and his court
boarded the ship and after meting
out the usual dose to his victims got
a taste of his own medicine. Pro-
ceedings broken up in disorder and
hilarity. (0.14 N., 84.57 E., 314 miles)'.
Said a man, who was mixed in his data;
“I can’t find this ’ere blessed equator—
A “Menagerie lion”
I ain’t clapp’d an eye on
Some bloke must a’captured the cratur!”
Debate in the evening on “League of
Nations”—large attendance, but rather
dull speeches. Muggy night, some rain
and considerable swell.
Nov. 28th (Friday).— Fair swell all day
—one or two rain-storms. Lecture on
“Japan” in the evening—interesting
from “White Australia” standpoint.
Biggest run of the voyage to date.
(3.17 S., 89.0 E., 322 miles).
Nov. 29th (Saturday).— Fresh breeze,
fine, good swell, quiet day, no sports,

impromptu concert in saloon. (7.06
S., 92.20 E., 304 miles).
Noy. 30th (Sunday). Beautiful day,

or Keeling Islands about 9 p.m.—We
were too far south to see them.
(to. 59 S., 95-24 E., 294 miles).
A Cocosite cynic of Keeling
Remarked to his “missus,” with
feeling:
“I suppose you display
Your calves in that way
Because they so much need YQ-veahngV’
The Orvieto, which left Colombo six

have had. Wind and sea dropped at
sundown. Sports (second day of
final championships) in afternoon.
Competitors found it difficult to
keep their feet. Final Pierrot Con-

contingent departed after medical
inspection, etc. Rest of us ashore at
6 p.m. for five hours’ visit to Fre-
mantle and Perth. (31.40 S., 115.18
E., 262 miles).
The fellows who left us at Perth
All swear it’s the best place on earth
But I think it’s the thing
For people to sing
Such hymns to the land of their birth.
Full moon, clear and cool. A few
new passengers—held up by a “strike”
on the Trans-Continental—embarked to
take the places of those who left.
Everybody back by midnight. We are
to go direct to Melbourne, landing the
South Australians and Tasmanians
there.

rounded Rottnest, and turned south
for the Leeuwin. Usual Church
Services. Weather clouded up a bit
m the afternoon. Passed Leeuwin
about 11 p.m., turned east towards
morning and got a bit of a beam
swell. The only fatality of the voy-
age occurred this day—the lonely
little monkey brought aboard by a
member of the _ crew died—appar-
ently of home-sickness. (32.17 S.,
115.17 E., 37 miles).
Dec. Bth (Monday). —Grey day, with

—turned up early this morning and
stayed with us all day giving a beau-
tiful display of aviation. Education
lecturettes in afternoon. Lantern
lecture on “The Earth’s Neighbours

play. Concert in evening—presenta-
tion to Miss Stroud. Quite cold at
night. (37.0 S., 128.49 E., 294 miles).
Dec. nth ’(Thursday). Grey, bleak
day—sea got up a little in afternoon.
Everybody pretty restless at pros-
pect of termination of voyage. Due
south of Adelaide about mid-day.
Debate at night “Should Bachelors
be Taxed?” Large attendance and
great interest. It was decided that
they should be taxed, amid great
enthusiasm. (38.9 S., 134.49 E., 292
miles).
Dec. 12th (Friday). —Fine day, fresh
breeze. Seal came right alongside
about noon. Coast of Victoria show-
ing up all day. Albatrosses have
left us. W.-Os’ and Sergeants’ third
dance aft, another success. The
“Orvieto,” which had called at Adel-
aide, once more caught us up and
passed us during the night. Passed
Cape Nelson early in afternoon.
Cape Otway about 10 p.m. (38.385.,
141.5 E., 295 miles).
An odious oaf of Cape Otway
Who used to say ceaselessly: “Wot
way?”
To whatever was said,
Is now suddenly dead
And we hope that his ghost walks
the hot way!
Dec. 13th (Saturday). —Arrived Port
Phillip Heads 4 a.m. At daybreak
wp were well up the Bay and about
7 a.m. we anchored off Williamstown
for medical inspection. Drew up to
wharf about 9 a.m. Landed South
Australians, Tasmanians and Victor-
ians. “Orvieto” berthed just in
front of us. She left about noon —
fine sight. We left about half-an-hour
later. Very hot; and country looked
shockingly bare and dusty. Passed
through the Rip about 4 p.m., and
dropped the Pilot. Very quiet after-
noon and evening—everybody “dopy”
and tired. The “Orvieto” disappeared
over the horizon ahead of us about
dusk. Our company very depleted
now. Passed Wilson’s Promontory
about mid-night—good swell the
ship has a strong list to starboard.
(38.12 S., 145.20 E., 223 miles).
Dec. 14th (Sunday). —Fine, fresh day—
sea calm. Usual Sunday Services.

p.m. All hands off the ship by 3.30.
Queenslanders to catch a special
train to Brisbane in the morning. So
ends a pleasant and memorable
voyage. (33-59 S., 151.2 E., 296 miles).
Here endeth the tale of the trip
So let’s give a hearty “Hip! Hip!'
FEp Hooray!” and one more,
Good luck! Au revoir!
To the Skipper, the Crew, and the
Ship!

OUR COMPANY.
We are a strange crowd —we of
the “Wahehe” —if we may believe
the classification of the passenger
list —especially we who collectively
bear the brand upon us of “First
Class.” The very term itself is
like charity, in that it covers a
multitude of sins—and sinners. We
are divided into ‘‘Officers’* (which
includes all brands, from a Major
General with half the letters of the
alphabet trailing after his name, to
the latest “Honourable Second
Loot”) ; “Dependents” (of which
the Amlg'ar synonym is ‘‘hangers-
on” ; but which is apparently here
used in its secondary significance of
wives!, children and fiancees),
“Civilians” (of whom there is pre-
cisely one solitary sample) and —
quaintest of all —“Indulgence Pas-
sengers,” a category which is appar-
ently only represented by the Davis
Cup challenge party from the Bri-
tish Isles. Why they should have
earned this name, or what it really
means, I do not profess to under-
stand. I can only hope it has no
ulterior or double meaning. So
far as I know their abstemiousness
has never been questioned —but then
this is a '‘dry” ship and “one never
knows, does one?” Finally, there
are one or two individuals amongst
us whose names appear upon the
list under no classification whatso-
ever. These mysterious personages
add an air of romance to the trip.
Can it be that some great incognito
is amongst us? Truly, “they that
go down to the sea in ships shall
see grejat marvels.” We are told
that adversity doth make strange
bed-fellows—but as a compiler of
curious companies it isn’t in it with
the ‘‘Wahehe.”
“FIRST CLASS.”
THE MOON.
[A small passenger, playing on the deck
one Mediterranean Night was moved
to wonderment about the beauty of
the moon. It is not suggested that
she actually rendered her thoughts
into the following words; but the
writer of the lines begs to acknow-
ledge his indebtedness to her, all the
same.]
About the Moon I wonder so—
What is it; and why does it grow
Smaller an s smaller an’ less bright,
And then again fill up with light?
And who turns on an’ off its glow?
It’s round; just like a circus show;
But if it’s “full,” I couldn’t go—
I wish I knew just what is right
About the moon.
Do children there just cry “What Ho!”
Like we do here; or, bowin’ low,
Say “Salaam!” like a ’Rabian
Knight?
And are those children black or
white?
There’s heaps of things I’d like to
know
About the moon.
About the Moon a little band
Of clouds dance on the golden sand,
A dance whose name I ’most forget—
I think it’s called the “Mignon-
ette.”
I watch them move round hand-in-hand,
And bow and turn upon the strand
I’d join them, but I s’pose command
Was given to the stars, all set
About the moon,
To keep us out. It would be grand
To slip behind that Fairy Land
And see what wonders might be
met;
It might be creepy there, but yet
How well I’d get to understand
About the Moon !
—S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
THE DAVIS CUP.
By Lieut.-Col. A. Kingscote,
I have been asked to discuss the
prospects of the British Lawn Ten-
nis Team now travelling to Aus-
tralia to challenge that country for
the Davis Cup. I have accepted
the invitation, apologetically, with
tennis as a secondary reason; but,
primarily, if I may say so, as a pre-
text for displaying the knowledge
which has been injected into me.


kindly but firmly, as the result of
the complete ‘"Education” scheme
which has been so successfully de-
vised and assiduously carried out
on board H.M.A.T ""Wahehe.”
Rather than discuss the relative
merits of racquet grips would I
speak of orbits, meridians and de-
clinations ; rather than enlarge on
the zeal and energy of the British
Team would I prefer to expound
my knowledge of the cannibals of
Papua. Had I been asked to do
so I should have liked to discourse
upon many subjects such as econ-
omics, bee-farming, commercial law,
and others including the ‘‘determin-
ation of character of babies by
virtue of sound,” but Editors know
their business and so I have been
asked to confine myself to tennis.
It is difficult to discuss the pros-
pects of a team which must travel
some ten thousand miles before
commencing its preparation for the
all-important matches, and when
these thousands of miles lie over
seas of varying turbulency, the op-
timism (or pessimism) which may
pervade an article of this kind must
be to a certain extent interde-
pendent upon the period at which
it is written and the resulting phy-
sical capacity of the writer to enjoy
his meals.
On board the ‘"Wahehe” the Bri-
tish Team is admirably cared for.
mentally and physically, by the
kindest of ship’s captains, a most
courteous ship’s staff, and the most
agreeable and enterprising of ship-
mates. At the time of writing all
members are fit, well, and happy,
and enjoying themselves very much
and it is pleasant to record that up
to date they have all won through
without the loss of a single meal,
nor is there any sign of discord or
the formation of a players’ union—
all these things are on the right
side of the account.
It is idle, I think, to lay too much
stress upon the doings of last sea-
son ; these doings can be recapitu-
lated very briefly. As regards
Singles, Patterson stood out pre-
eminently and beat easily two mem-
bers of the present British Teamt —
one on wood in April and one on
grass at the end of June; he met
neither of them again nor has he
played agfainst the ithird (member
of the British Team. Patterson was
beaten on wood in April by a mem-
ber of the British Team which de-
feated France at the end of August.
Brookes played only one match in
England and that against Patterson
who beat him somewhat easily. He
has not met in match play any
members of the British Team.
O’Hara Wood was just beaten in
June by one of the British Team ;
he did not have an opportunity of
taking his revenge, nor has he met
the other two members of the team.
It is improbable that Australia
will look beyond these three players
for the selection of their team as
regards singles; although I am ig-
norant of any talent there may be
now in Australia. In doubles
there is a galaxy of talent, and I do
not propose to prophesy what team
will be chosen.
Of the British Team none of the
members have played much match
tennis during the year; they do not
form the best team that the British
Isles could put into the field, had the
match been played in England; but
they do form, 1 think, as strong a
combination as could reasonably be
expected to be got together to make
so long a journey. They should be
considerably stronger in singles
than in doubles; in fact they have
no formed doubles combination.
But as I have said previously,
last season’s form and results count
for little —a new season opens when
the team lands in Australia. What
measure of form will be attained is
very prdblematical—muscles must
be trained afresh, the eye and mind
quickened, after the pleasant lazi-
ness (?) of life on board ship. The
team is inhaling much good oxygen
and feel that a month’s practice at
Sydney prior to the matches should
bring the members at least to the
measure of skill attained previously
—it is hoped further still —and they
know that they want every ounce
in order to win. The British Team
wants to win, intends to win if it is
humanly possible to do so, and,
moreover, stands a chance of doing
so. Whether it does win or not all
the members are looking forward
to visiting Australia and are now
experiencing on board ship a fore-
taste of the kindness and sympathy
which they know will be their share
when they reach that land.
If the critics think that Aus-
tralia should win and win easily; if
this opinion should appear to be
confirmed by paper records; yet
there is one fact which may upset
the book and, should this, be so,
what an opportunity there will be
for the propaganda of the ""Pussy-
foots” ! Patterson was deservedly
pre-eminent and beat the British
players in England; but on those
occasions the latter had not been
‘"Pussyfoots” for six weeks!
What may happen when he meets
them on a "‘Pussyfooting?” What
may happen after six weeks on the
“Wahehe” ?
WOOL IN THE GREASE.
(By a “Digger” on “N.M.E.” near
London Docks).
As I sit in my office drear,
In the midst of the city’s pride,
An odour is borne to me, clear,
Thro’ the hurrying feet outside.
How often its message has cried,
In this haunt of the “bear” and the
“bull,”
Of the days that have long since died—
That keen scent of the greasy wool.
From the ships at the neighb’ring pier,
As they wait for a favoring tide,
That odour is borne to me here,
My wandering thoughts to guide;
And, with memory’s giant stride,
They are back in the bushland cool,
Where ’twas comp’ny on many a ride—
That keen scent of the greasy wool.
And I see them, again, those dear,
Old comrades, true-hearted and tried;
I can hear the click of the shear
And the crack of the whip, well-plied.
The life and the laughter allied
Of those days at my heart-strings pull,
And with them will ever abide
That keen scent of the greasy wool.
ENVOY.
Australia! Thy pastures are wide
And with perfumes thy bush is full;
But there’s few to compare beside
That keen scent of the greasy wool.

AN INTERLUDE.
Tear Old Lady (on the upper boat
deck) to young mother with baby in
her arms:—“lsn’t it a sweet? —So like
it’s father, too.”
Young Mother: “Do you really think
so? I can never see the resemblance.”
D.0.L.: “Oh, my dear! His mouth and
chin! Anyone can see at a glance that
they’re so like his”—waving her hand
to the Male Person present at the in-
terview.
Y.M.: “But that isn’t his father,
that’s ”
But explanation collapses, and all
three retire in different directions and
in varying stages of dudgeon.

SPORTS AND PASTIMES.
By Our Special Reporters.
OUTDOOR.
Within a few of having said
“Good-bye!” to Old England and
her good folk, arrangements were
made to get busy with sport, and as
soon as the committee were drawn
together everyone was eager for a
meeting. The first of these took
place on Saturday afternoon, the
Bth November, and proved a great
success. The entries totalled 240,
but the Committee were equal to
the pressure and the whole pro-
gramme was completed without a
hitch. The serious events were
keenly contested and fought out,
and other competitions such as
Bun Eating,” “ Hallowe’en,”
“Thread the Needle” and “Boot-
Race” had the onlookers raised to a
high pitch of hilarious excitement.
Each deck supplied a representative
Tug-of-War Team, and during Ir-
respective “Pulls” enthusiastic fol-
lowers made excitement run high.
The “Final” was very evenly con-
tested, No. i Officers’ Team defeat-
ing No. 2 W.O’s and Sergeants’
Team after a strenuous pull.

With glorious weather and
everybody happy, the second Sports
Meeting was held on Saturday af-
ternoon, the 15th November, and it
proved another huge success. The
Committee put forward another very
interesting programme and the en-
tries numbered more than 200. A
start was made at 2 p.m. with the
“Pillow Fight” (over a ship’s bath)
and after a humorous half-hour”s
entertainment Mr. Walker defeated
W.-O. Dart for first prize, many on-
lookers envying the defeated man’s
good, cheap bath. The Obstacle
Race and Scratch Pulling proved
very interesting events, and both
contests were very evenly fought
out by our athletes. The ladies
were well catered for, and the final
of the “Musical Men” proved that
some of our Officers’ wives can
sprint.
The Tug-of-War, as usual,
roused considerable interest, but
No. 2 Officers’ Team wisely in-
cluded a new non-lightweight (Gen-
eral Ryrie), and after a hard
struggle beat the victors of last
week’s meeting.
Results —
Pillow Fight. —Mr. Walker Ist, War
rant Officer Dart 2nd.
Egg and Spoon Race (Ladies). —Miss
Sheppard Ist, Mrs. Hollins 2nd.
Obstacle Race. —Warrant Officer Lord
Ist, Lieut. Berry 2nd.

(Capt. Murphy) Ist, No. 1 Officer’s
Team (Lt.-Col. Brown) 2nd.
Musical Men (Ladies). —Mrs. Wackett
Ist, Mrs. Williams 2nd.
T he third meeting was held on Sat-
uiday afternoon, the 22nd Novem-
ber, in ideal weather, and with large
entries. Long before starting time
the stands and promenades were
crowded, and at 2 p.m. the Starter
(Lieut. Hough) set the programme
in motion with the first heat of the
Pillow Fight. Warrant Officer Wil-
liams proved the victor in this event,
bowling all his opponents off the
bar in good style. The Tug-of-War
again attracted the athletic element
and only after long and strenuous
pulling the various heats were de-
cided. The ‘‘Diggers,” Warrant
Officers and No. 1 Officers Team all
pulled pluckily, but could not re-
verse last week’s winners and Cap-
tain Murphy again led his team to
victory amid long and loud cheer-
ing. The Lemonade, Bun and
Whistling Competition proved the
humorous item of the programme;
but AV.O. Jenkins, being an old
stager at this sort of sport, won eas-
ily with Sister Smith as partner. The
Ladies’ Potato Race was well con-
tested and both the heats and the
final were only won by inches. The
last event of the day proved most
attractive for men of the running
world and 13 teams toed the line for
the Relay Race. In all instances
the finish was fought out and only
inches separated the winner and sec-
ond man at the tape.
Results—
Pillow Fight. —Warrant Officer Wil-
liams Ist, Pte. Braund 2nd.
Tug-of-War. —No. 2 Officer’s Team
(Capt. Murphy) Ist, No. 1 Officer’s
Team (Lieut.-Col. Brown) 2nd.

Ist, Mrs. Wilson 2nd.
Relay Race.— “ Diggers” Team (Cpl.
Weatherall) Ist, Officers (Lieut. Berry)
2nd.
The weather was very dull and
overcast when we started on our
Championship Two Days’ Sports
Meeting on Wednesday, the 3rd De-
cember, but the weather failed to
damp the enthusiasm of the support-
ers, and the results were very grati-
fying to the Committee. A start
was made with the Pillow Fight, and
after some of the finest contests wit-
nessed aboard, W.-O. Squires won
from Sgt. Wilson. Quite a number


of athletes faced the starter for the
Relay Race and a considerable num-
ber of heats had to be run off be-
fore the semi-finals could be pro-
ceeded with ; the racing was very
keen, and no winning team had any
great advantage at the finish. Con-
siderable interest was taken in the
Obstacle Race which proved a very
popular race for the onlookers. After
tea it was necessary to get to the
course early if one wanted to see the
Ladies’ Potato Race decided, and
long before the commencement the
“Full House” was hoisted. The
heats were very evetily contested,
and the Light Horse element in the
crowd made themselves heard when
both Miss G. Ryrie and Miss M.
Ryrie were successful in their heats.
The final was quite exciting and the
Light Horse favorites filled first and
third positions respectively and Mrs.
Hollins second. The Ladies “Thread
the Needle” Race was another great
attraction and caused much fun.
The heats of the Tug-of-War were
again very closely contested and,
after a rattling pull in the final No.
2 Officers beat No. 1 Warrant Offi-
cers’ and Sergeants’ team. Ring
Wrestling, Boot Race, and Scratch
Pulling all proved good sport and
were followed with great interest.
The final event of the meeting was
listed as “The Judges Handicap,”
and was possibly the most popular
of all. The handicapper treated
General Ryrie to a good start, and
notwithstanding his additional avoir-
dupois he won handily from the
fieety skipper of the English Davis
Cup Team.
Results—
Obstacle Race. —Lieut. Berry ist,
W.-O. Lord 2nd, and Corpl. Luke 3rd.

The Judges worked untiringly,
and a large share of the success of
the meetings was due to them.

mander “Wahehe”; M/General Sir G. de
L. Ryne, K.C.M.G., C.8., V.D.; Lieut.-
Colonel R. Williams, D.5.0., 0.8. E.,

cote; Major I. Isaacson; Captain E. O.
Gaze; Warrant Officer D. Jenkins.
Starter. —Lieut. Hough.
Great credit and thanks must be
accorded to the members of the
Committee who all worked very
hard to make these meetings the suc-
cess they proved to be. The lady
members did particularly good work,
and Major Nobbs’ administration
was a feature of the meeting. Ser-
geant Stephenson as Clerk of the
Course was a very active and ardent
worker.
INDOOR.
Under the direction of the Indoor
Amusement Committee, Bridge,
Euchre, Chess and Draughts Tour-
naments were carried out on the
ship. They were all keenly con-
tested and provoked great enthusi-
asm both among the participators
and spectators. Credit is due to all
parties concerned in the arrange-
ments (and particularly to Hon,-
Lieut. Butcher and W.-O. Cohen),
the competitions being all carried
out smoothly and efficiently. In
addition to the above, two most en-
joyable ‘‘Fun Evenings” were held
at which “Search Parties” and “Pel-
man Parties” and other similar com-
petitions were entered into with
energy and hilarity. The ears of
certain frequenters of the famous
“Boat Deck” must surely have
burned during the reading of some
of the limerick, conundrum and
verse entries; nor are any of us
likely to forget the terrific din
created by the assembly in the
“Rival Choir” stunt, nor the agon-
ies of the competitors in the ‘‘Stand-
ing Grin” and “Long Distance
Grouch.” The results of what we
may term the more serious com-
petitions are given hereunder :

Not sufficient entries were available
from the Troop Deck for a Chess Tour-
nament, but Trooper Duff was selected
to represent “Other Ranks” in the
Ship s Championship. Trooper Duff
met Sergeant Napier in the semi-final
round (Major Hutchinson having drawn
a bye) and was beaten by the latter after
a great battle.
Euchre and Crib Tournaments having
been held each week, space prevents us
giving a detailed list of all the winners
in these sections. No Ship Champion-
ships were played in either of these two
classes.
A FEW TOPICAL “LIMERICKS.”
(By “Anon.”)
THE BABIES
Our babies I'd like you to know
Could each take a prize at a show
By feeding on Glaxo it stiffens their
backs so
They’ll soon tell their mothers to “go.”
TRY ME !
This ship’s so uncommonly “dry”
That it even makes “Pussyfoots” shy;
But I seem to think, if offered a drink
I’d accept without winking an eye.

Who’s Whose?
Pen and Ink Drawings by Miss M. Ryrie


THE TEMPERATURE.
It’s been warm, even hot, they have said
But they’re not in the least bit dismayed
On the boat-deck, you see, between
you and me
It is always just—two in the shade!
M’YES.
Is billing and cooing contagious?
For we see, as it’s so advantageous,
From gun’le to gun’le on both sides
the funnel,
Well —to tell we’d be very courageous.
THINGS THAT COME TO PASS
IN THE NIGHT.
Scene: Cabin 77. Time—Midnight.
The occupants of the cabin are peace-
fully sleeping.
Quack —a self-sacrificing man, occu-
pies the top berth. Mrs. Quack is doing
her best with one end of the lower, the
siix-months’ infant having established
inalienable rights to the other.
Mrs. Q. is wakened by a steady stream
of vituperation from the opposite cabin.
After lying there for a while, damp with
horror, and hearing words that enrich
the vocabulary but make the fine higher
if a pure-minded policeman hears them,
she gently but firmly pushes a darning
needle into the mattress above her. It
is the signal agreed upon between hus-
band and wife “should danger affright,”
in the words of Moody and Sankey.
Mr. Q. wakens with a yell and, when he
realises the signal, leans out of his berth
and enters into active competition with
his neighbour across the way.
Mrs. Q. —O, Horace! Don’t! (then in
a coaxing voice) Will you get up, or
will I ?
Mr. Q. —You, of course. Wasn’t that
on the back of our Marriage Certificate?
I was to pay the bills and you to do
the chores —this s a chore.
Mrs. Q. (a woman of one idea at a
time). —No, dear, it’s—O—What was
that? Why-—it’s water —
Mr. Q. —Well, it’s a chore, anyway!
Mrs. Quack rises, and, in the spirit
that turns a woman into an Ibsen hero-
ine, switches on the light and examines
the cabin. She utters little horrified
shrieks “O, Horace. It’s the baby’s
dresses and my new nighties!”
Quack leans out of lied, mildly sym-
pathetic:—“ Well, you shouldn’t put
them on the floor,”
Mrs. Quack, (disenterring clothes as
she goes)—“Oh! And your new suit!”
Quack springs up, bangs his head on
the ceiling and brings his legs over the
berth in an abandon of rage: “The devil
it is!” He is overwhelmed with anger
and rushes out before his wife can stop
him. He collides with Fly-by-night,
the vituperative airman, and for two
minutes the whole corridor teems with
frightfulness, as they paddle about in
three inches of water and wipe fish
scales and potato peelings out of their
eyes.
Then the airman opens up:—“ Well, I
didn’t do it for my soul’s good, you can
bet your life on that. The dam’ things
came in through the port-hole.”
Quack makes a vulgar noise witli his
tongue, as one who would say: “You
and your port-hole!” But before they
can get to grips, the door of a third
cabin opens and out comes Costs, ar-
rayed negligently in his own pyjama
legs and his wife’s ornate dressing-
jacket
“What the Devil’s the matter? Can’t
you fellows sleep? For Heaven’s sake,
dope your beastly consciences and give
a man a chance! Am Ito be kept
awake all night to listen to your beastly
rows, eh?”
The two conspirators start to explain,
but all explanations are drowned in a
fresh blast of fish-tails, potato peelings
and dirty water. The three dance like
Macbeth witches in the cramping pass-
age, and threats to take the life of the
Captain, to report to the 0.C., to in-
stitute an inquiry, etc., etc., are hurled
about recklessly, when suddenly a fourth
door is opened and a well-aimed shower
of boots gets the trio in vital parts, or
to be less vulgar, in “vitalibus partibus”
(this is for our lady friends). Fly-by-
night, nursing his “tupnmy,” rushes
furiously to the door whence the boots
had come; but is met by a well-directed
spurt of water.
All three then retire to their cabins,
each hoping that the other has got a
worse time than he has, for we have
passed the Red Sea and altruism is on
the wane.
Inside the fourth cabin the victor
climbs leisurely into his lower berth
and “collogues” with his wife; “Got
’em all! Caught ’em bending—what—
what—!”
“What did you do it for, old thing?”
says the wife; but hubby is asleep, or
pretends to be, while outside three
phantoms timidly glimmer in the gloom,
trying to make up their minds to con-
certed action.
In the morning they complain and a
harassed Purser decides that the only
thing to do is to blame the boot-
thrower; so he sends an A.B. to create
the evidence by pouring water from a
vantage point in his cabin over the other
three. The inquiry is still proceeding
as we go to press. The only evidence
the boot-thrower has to support his
contention that he did not do it is the
absence of fish-tails and potato-peelings
in the second lot of water. But we
understand that the Purser is seeing to
that, and is prepared, if necessary, to
bring fresh evidence with at least three
fish-tails to every bucket of water be-
fore he will let the matter drop.

THE EDUCATION SERVICE.
(To the Editor “ Wahehe
Boomerang.’’)
Permit me to give a brief His-
tory of the Educational activities
obtaining on this Transport.
The “ Wahehe” is classed as a
“Family Shi])” —the A.I.F. Repatri-
ation and Demobilization Depart-
ments, and even the Education Ser-
vice in London, are of opinion that
very little educational work is pos-
sible on such ships; but our experi-
ence very clearly demonstrates the
contrary.
After a thorough canvass of the
ship for tutors and students, a most
comprehensive list of subjects—32
in number—was obtained, and in-
structors for each subject were soon
forthcoming from the quota’s per-
sonel.
Those ladies and gentlemen who
have given their services so will-
ingly deserve our very best thanks.
Following are the subjects, aver-
age attendance, and instructors: —
French, 63, Major Hutchinson, W.-O.
Gray, and W.-O. Barrett; English, 8,
Lieut.-Col. Rolland; German, 8, Major
Isaacson, Mrs. Rolland; Italian, 6.
Major Tofft and Miss Mansfield; Latin,
5. Capt. Allen; Arabic, 3, Mrs. Fletcher:
Urdu, 2. Mrs. Fletcher; Wireless, 7,
Lieut. Johnston; Wool-classing, 12.
Lieut. Wight; Surveying, 5, Capt. Potts;
Book-keeping, 56, Lieut. Rogers and
W.-O. Dart; Arithmetic, 6, Lieut.
Graham; Mathematics, 14, Capt, Bur-
nell; Shorthand. 5, Lieut. Hancock;
Aeroplane Designing, 1, Lieut. Treacy;
Architectural Drawing, 8, Capt. Kees-
ing; Agriculture, 17, W.-O. Williams;
Motor Mechanics. 17, Major Cutler and
Lieut. Weston; Photography. 19, W.-O.
Marriott and Sgt. Smith; Psychology,
16. Lieut. Saunderson and Mrs. Hain;
Astronomy. 14, Major Wackett and
Capt. Potts; Anatomy (Vet.) 1, Lieut.
Crozier; Bacteriology. 1, Major May;
Commercial Law, 31. Lieut. Skipper,
Capt. Hain; Typewriting, 5, W.-O.
Dart; Sketching, 15,, W.-O. Goodchild;
Bee-keeping, 4, Lieut. Berry; Economics
6, Lieut. Saunderson and Mrs. Hain;
Bootmaking, 2, Sgt. Harper; Bridge-
buliding and Concrete Work, Capt.
Mead; Sewing, Crochet, and Knitting,
Miss Tofft.
Percentage of personnel attending
classes—6l per cent.
All the above classes are well at-
tended and easily constitute a re-
cord for Family Ships, and, as far
as I know, will just about create a
record in subjects and attendance
for any transport returning to Aus-
tralia, in proportion to the numer-
ical strength of quotas.
Enrolments include all ranks from
Private to Major-General—-another
record that will take some beating.
The great success of the move-
ment was made possible by the
keen interest, assistance, and advice


given by the O.C. Troops —Lieut.-
Colonel Williams, D.5.0., 0.8. E.
We are very fortunate in having
on board the well-known lecturer,
Mr. Butcher, who has delivered il-
lustrated lectures, highly interest-
ing and instructive, concerning our
new possession, Papua, and also on
Australia’s coloured neighbors in
China, India, and Japan.
A Debating Society has been
formed and weekly debates are be-
ing held before large and interested
audiences. It is particularly notice-
able how excellently the lady pas-
sengers have supported this, as well
as all other branches of educational
activity.
Finally, a tribute must be paid
to the Kindergarten which, under
the kindly supervision of Mrs.
Kingscote and Capt. Keesing, has
not only largely interested and
bcnehtted the children themselves,
but has been much appreciated by
their parents. —-Yours, etc.,
H. B. LINTON-SMITH, Lieut.
Education Officer.
[Naturally Lieut. Smith, in for-
warding us the above report, has
omitted to mention his own good
work, and that of his able assist-
ants, W.-O. Dart and Sgt. Robin-
son. But inferentially the report
speaks for itself in this respect. It
only remains to add that if it had
not been for the energy of the three
gentlemen named the classes would
have been neither so varied in sub-
ject matter nor so largely attended.
The passengers on the “Wahehe”
have a lot to thank the ‘‘Ministry

THE FUTURE AND EDUCA-
TION.
■ ——o
In consequence of the interest
evinced in the educational applica-
tions of psychology by members of
the Psychology Class on board, and
with a view to the possible practi-
cal utility of discussions of some
problems of education, a circle was
commenced with the object, of hear-
ing lecturettes on various aspects
of these problems.
Each session of the circle lasted
about two hours and was well at-
tended. Lecturettes were given as
follows: —
i.—“ The Average Citizen and
Education,” by Hon. Lieut. Butcher.
2. —‘‘Education and Democracy,’
by Hon. Lieut. Ingram.
3. —“Primary Education, “ by
Lieut. Buchanan.
4. —“The Place of the University
in Education,” by Capt. H. W.
Allen.
5. —‘‘The Man on the ' and and
Education,” by W.-O. Williams.
6. —“Vocational Training,” by
Capt. Burnell.
The classes were organised by
Lieut. W. Saunderson, who acted
as chairman. The discussions on
Agricultural and Rural Education;
the University, and Technical train-
ing were particularly interesting
and enlightening. It was agreed
that greater facilities should be of-
fered for the training in the practice
and theory of agriculture, both in
High Schools and Colleges. The
importance of a good sound found-
ation work was emphasised, especi-
ally in the humanities. Too early
specialisation was deprecated, but
it was thought that without speci-
fic technical education being given
some preliminary work could be,
with advantage, introduced into pri-
mary and secondary schools. Edu-
cation was regarded as of a three-
fold nature; to develop personality,
to inculcate ideals of good citizen-
ship, and to make preparation for
future vocation by giving practical
equipment. The lack of teachers
of the standard and puality desired
was commented on and the opinion
was freely expressed that the status
of the teacher should be materially
improved by greater inducements
being offered to attract the best
men and women to a profession,
which had such a responsible task
as that of moulding the future citi-
zens of Australia. Other subjects
touched upon included the desira-
bility of history—teaching under
newer methods, the questions of sex
instruction and religion.
Many were able to offer sugges-
tions as fruits of a ripe experience,
and also as the result of study
and research whilst on N.M.E. in
England.

MORE LIMERICKS.
(By “Anon.”)
JAZZ.
We’ve a Jazz Band conducted by
Wackett.
Which makes such harmonious racket
That the people all come to hear the
big drum,
With the kettle and cymbals to back it.
THE LADY.
Her mind was too easily swayed
To join in debate—so she said,
So she’s placed on committee without
any pity
And that’s how the Bond was repaid.
PUB OR CAFE.
The result of the votes, when debated,
Was success for the “Pubs”—they’re
elated,
The ladies they smiled, but were in-
wardly riled
And there’s rumours of husbands
much slated.
THE BATH
Yes, the bath was a glorious treat,
Such a boon to us all in the heat;
Mixed bathing “verboten,” some thought
rather rotten;
But the Grundys said “No!—lndis-
creet! !”
THE MEDITERRANEAN.
(By Hon. Captain H. W. Allen).
The sea through which we are
now passing must always He for us
the most interesting of all the
world's waterways. It is the
cradle not only of human historv,
but of human civilisation. The Med-
iterranean littoral has seen the rise
and fall of nation after nation —
Egyptian, Sumerian, Hittite, As-
syrian, Babylonian, Phoenician,
Cretan, Greek, Persian, Macedon-
ian, Roman, Spanish, Turkish, Moor-
ish, Goths, Huns, Vandals, Franks,
and Normans, Crusaders from Eng-
land ; all have played a part in the
world’s drama on this stage. Gal-
lipoli is an age-old battle ground,
and the Trojan war is said to have
been fought for the key to a trade-
route. In fact to write the story of
the Mediterranean would be to
write the story of the world.
But of all Mediterranean lands
Egypt is the most important. Here
according to such an eminent auth-
ority as Professor Grafton Elliot
Smith (an Australian, by-the-way,


and named after his native town),
we may put a definite finger on the
original home of civilisation. And
the reason why Egypt, of all Medit-
eranean lands, was chosen for this
distinction, may be, as I have seen
maintained, that here agriculture
first began. Major T. Cherry,
A.A.M.C., recently Professor of
Agriculture in Melbourne, contends
that the regular inundations of the
Nile, and the peculiar climatic con-
ditions of Egypt, gave man the first
idea, and the first opportunity, of
cultivating cereals, and that the
necessary conditions could have
been found in no other place in the
world. Hitherto, man had led a
nomadic hand-to-mouth existence,
with never a reliable enough food
supply to organise an ordered com-
munity, or plan for the future. But
once a regular and abundant staple
of life was assured, men might
settle in large numbers in a perman-
ent abode, and a staple society was
made possible. However that
may be, it seems certain that Egypt
was the radiating point of human
progress. And, given the start, it
is amazing how quickly and how
far it radiated. It is a mistake to
suppose that the ancients were con-
fined by narrow geographical limits.
Horace (as Major Hutchinson will
tell you) marvels at the courage of
the “robust and brass-bound man”
who first braved the raging sea, and
we used to be told that the frail
cockle-shell of the early sailor could
not ride out a storm in the “Wa-
hehe” swimming bath, and that the
‘(pillars of Hercules” at Gibraltar
were the end of the world. But we
know that, somehow or other, even
at the dawn of history, men travel-
led far and wide, and Elliot Smith
declares that the ancient world was
cosmopolitan. Not only were there
well established land-routes which
gave them gold from Africa, sp : ces
from Arabia, amber from the Baltic,
silk from China, and tin from Corn-
wall; not only did they communi-
cate freely by sea with Mediteran-
ean shores and islands; but there is
unmistakeable evidence that they
reached the Pacific Islands, the East
Indies, and even America. There
were, for instance, no elephants in
America, yet we find Aztec carvings
of Indian Elephant-heads, which
could hardly have been efforts of
imagination or the creatures of a
nightmare; and Elliot Smith told
the British Association in Mel-
bourne, in 1914, that he found
traces of Egyptian burial customs
even in Australia. It was, in fact,
according to him, the practice of
mummification which gave the first
incentive to commerce, because the
Egyptians wanted resins and spices
to embalm their dead, and metals
for the working of their stone
tombs, and timber for their sar-
cophagi.
Whether, then, it was agricul-
ture or religion that was originally
responsible, certain it is that Egyp-
tian culture spread all over the
known world. And one of the
first places it would reach would be
the Island of Crete, the stepping
stone between Africa and Greece, as
Sicily was between Africa and Italy.
How far the civilisation of Crete
might have developed independently
of Egypt is an arguable point;
there are evidences there of a civil-
isation which had gone as far as to
develop a separate alphabet and
script —almost the highest pinnacle
cf human achievement. But Crete
inevitably fell under Egyptian in-
fluence, and it is essentially from
Crete that the ancient Greek or
“Mediterranean” culture radiated.
Some two thousand years B.C. there
was a highly developed ‘‘Minoan”
civilisation, called after the legend-
ary king, Minos of Crete, the builder
of the famous labyrinth.
Recent excavation at Cnossos by
Sir Arthur Evans unearthed the
capital of this early civilisation, es-
pecially the “Palace of Minos,” a
splendid structure, planned on a col-
ossal scale, with huge hall of audi-
ence, with staircases, tall columns,
living rooms, store rooms, water
supply, sewerage system, and
“every modern convenience.” And
it is surprising how modern these
ancients were. There is a gem
showing a “Minoan” lady in a tier
and flounced skirt which might be
the dernier cri from Paris, and all
the gems and jewellery, carvings
paintings, decorations and archi-
tecture, show the highest level of
culture.
This Minoan culture spread and
established itself in the mainland of
Greece, and became the foundation
of that wonderful civilisation of
Ancient Greece, from which we have
derived so much of our art and lit-
erature and learning. Greece con-
quered her conquerers, and spread
the gospel to her Roman masters;
Rome in her turn spread it over her
great Empire, and our present
European civilisation derives in-
timately and immediately from
Rome. It has, of course, been in-
fluenced and modified by the chang-
ing sway of various nations, and
most peoples in Europe, and some
in Asia, too, have had some part in
shaping it; but it remains funda-
mentally Greek and Roman, and
our whole social order, as well as
our art and literature and religion
is deeply permeated by “classical”
influences.
So, in barest summary, we trace
the line of human progress. To
establish each step in any detail
would require more paper than there
is on H.M.A.T. ‘‘Wahehe”; but the
line is sure, and, despite its count-
less branches into ancient and med-
iaeval and modern empires, lead
us back to the Medierranean basin,
through Romq, land Greece and
Crete, and ultimately to Egypt and
the Nile Valley. I leave it to our
Egyptian experts to tell us some of
the wonders of that fascinating
land. We shall hardly learn to ap-
preciate them from our own re-
searches during our call at Port
Said.
A MEDITERRANEAN NIGHT.
To-night I hear the luring Sirens croon
The song they sang Odysseus of old;
To-night I read the World’s Great
Story, told
In scintillating hieroglyph and rune
Upon the silver scroll which Night’s
high noon
Hath o’er this Sea of Memories un-
roll’d
The romanc’d years return and I be-
hold
The Golden Age beneath the full-orb’d
moon.
Over the haunted waves I watch the
flight
Of Tyrian trader and of Berber
barque;
I hear the racing Corsair’s hissing
keel
And see the great oar’d Roman tri-
reme reel;
And as the vision fades into the dark
A ghostly “Hail—Farewell!” salutes the
Night.
S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.

THE CHAPLAINCY DEPART-
MENT.
The Chaplains on board repre-
ent various branches of the Church,
but sectarianism has been an ab-
sentee during the voyage, much to
the joy of most of the passengers.
Besides the morning and evening
services, the communion has been
celebrated each Sunday, and a Sun-
day School and Bible Class have
been undertaken.
Armistice Day was impressively
recognised by the whole Ship’s
Company as we steamed slowly
through the main artery of the
Empire.
But it is quite possible that the
Chaplains value most the many op-
portunities of free discussion on
great topics that such a voyage af-
fords. They have certainly availed
themselves of the opportunity of
rendering very varied service, and
if they have lifted as many burdens
from peoples’ minds as they have
chairs from the saloon, they should
be well content with the result of
their labours.
One of the most pleasant items
in the religious life of the ship was
the open-air evening service, which
was held with great frequency dur-
ing the voyag'e. This al fresco
method of worship, which con-
sisted for the most part of the sing-
ing of favorite hymns and songs,
combined with a short prayer and
address, was always well attended
and heartily participated in by all.
One/ of the happiest memories of
a very happy trip will always be the
sound of many voices rising to the
calm and tropic skies, in the words
of the well-loved airs of Home.
THE Y.M.C.A.
Tribute must be paid to the
Y.M.C.A. Representatives on the
“Wahehe” for their consistent and
helpful work on the voyage. We
have referred to Mr. Butcher’s lec-
tures elsewhere; but we cannot al-
low the energy and zeal of Mr. In-
gram and his helpers (Sgt. L.
Isaacs and Cpl. G. Nicholls) to
pass unacknowledged. The relig-
ious, literary, musical, and sporting
life of the ship has been very
largely dependent upon them and—
as is almost invariably the case with
the Y-Emma they have risen
nobly to their opportunities. The
following* letter which was received
by Mr. Ingram from the “other
ranks” on board just prior to reach-
ing Fremantle, speaks for itself: —
H.M.A.T “Wahehe,”
At Sea, Dec. sth, igig.
To Lieut. Ingram—
Representative of the Y.M.C.A.
We, the undersigned, as a token of our
appreciation and esteem of your kind-
ness and thoughtfulness for our welfare,
wish you to accept this in the spirit in
which it is offered.
We shall always treasure kind
thoughts and remembrances of the
many comforts and benefits received
from the Y.M.C.A. in the coming years
of Peace, as we did during the years of
War.
(Here follow the signatures of every
man on the Troop Deck).
A letter, couched in similar
terms, “mutatis mutandis” was also
handed to Capt. Franks, the Salva-
tion Army Representative, whose
earnest work and quiet help were
deeply appreciated by all on board.
Needless to say the letters will be
treasured by both gentlemen to
whom they were addressed.
THE CANTEEN.
During the voyage the Canteen
was open regularly on the
poop deck aft, and under the-cour-
teous supervision of Sergeant F.
Gleeson and his able assistants —
Trooper T. Duff and Driver S. R.
Hardwicke proved itself ‘‘a
boon and blessing to men,” to say
nothing of women and children.
From Epsom salts to toothpaste
and from chocolates to tin-openers,
the varied tastes of a very catholic
community were amply provided
for.
WAHEHE ITEMS.
Learning Things.
We are taught about boots and the bee
There are lectures on astronomee;
But the things we are taught
Are really as naught
To the many queer things that we see!
The Grouser
The menu lacks whisky and beer;
The rudder gets clean out of gear,
The baths are too few
And the paint is too new—
Even- I am a nuisance, I fear.
In Loco Amoris.
The “Wahehe’s” a wonderful barque:
She's just like a bit of Hyde Park—
The Boat Deck above
Is devoted to love
And all space is full-up after dark!
A Vers-atile Man.
Our popular skipper, Mackenzie
When he gives up the sea to keep
hens, he
Will teach them their ways
In a series of “lays”,
Which he’ll sing in a lyrical frenzy!
A ZULU PALAVER.
(A Reminiscence of the Boer War.)
At the time of which I am about
to write the Australians were oper-
ating in the North Eastern Trans-
vaal, beyond the Crocodile River,
and news was brought to the party
of which I was a member, that
bloodshed had occurred between
two powerful neighbouring tribes
of Bantus, known as the Sekukuni
and the Malocooti, and that war
was imminent. Our C.O. Major
(now Brig.-Gen.) J. R. Royston,
who spoke the Zulu and Bantu lan-
guages fluently, recognising the
military importance of keeping
these tribes friendly, sent to each
of the chieftains an offer of medi-
ation, and appointed a place of
meeting, which was accepted. Each
chief was to be accompanied by six
head men and to come unarmed
and otherwise unescorted.
Knowing the Zulus well, our
C.O. first saw to a dramatic setting
and then warned us against evinc-
ing the slightest signs of amuse-
ment, as the natives are very sus-
ceptible to ridicule. The warning
was a timely one, as events proved.
The place chosen for the palaver
or conference was at the foot of a
large kopje, from the base of
which projected a flat slab of rook.
Before us, and as far as the eye
could reach, spread the undulating
veldt, ranges of hills vanishing in
the immensity of distance and form-
ing ramparts on either side, on
which were dotted native villages
whose kraals looked like diminutive
bee-hives scattered over the veldt.
At the appointed hour, and winding
in and out, came two black lines
from opposite directions, converging
as they approached us. Native
forms soon took shape and all ex-

cept the chiefs were observed to be
in native attire, consisting of bead
ornaments and rings on arms and
ankles. Around the loins they
wore small aprons of monkey skins,
while on their heads coils of ebony
wood denoted their high rank. Their
progress was stately and dignified,
and as they drew close our eyes first
alighted on the Chief of the Sekuk-
uni. Held high above his head by an
attendant was a large white umbrella
lined with green; on his woolly pate
was balanced a second-hand, black
silk top-hat, several sizes too small
for him; on his huge back, and
wrinkled as if in pain, stretched a
woebegone frock coat which re-
fused to meet in front, and a waist-
coat that had fallen out with the
coat and trousers and scorned to
fraternise with them across his
dusky skin, which here formed a
kind of ‘‘No Man’s Land.” He was
sans shirt, sans socks, sans boots ;
but full of dignity.
Next we observed the Chief of
the Malacooti approaching and our
lips became tremulous with sup-
pressed laughter once again; for
this warrior far surpassed his rival
in originality of design, if not in
dignity. Above his head, also, but
too precious to be borne by other
hands than his own, soared a lady’s
parasol, blue in colour and long in
handle. Open at the neck to allow
the breeze to whisk across his
manly bosom, and buttoned in front
with three beautiful bone buttons,
one perceived a more-than-normal-
sized lady’s cotton blouse, with
large red spots on a white back-
ground. A red bandana handker-
chief was caught in the girdle,
which itself was made of plaited
deerhide—and at this point the
trader’s'persuasions and my descrip-
tion alike cease; for the reader
must turn to nature to complete the
attire.
Meanwhile the C.O. had taken
his position on the ledge of rock,
his officers behind him in a semi-
circle. Arrived on the scene, each
of the Chiefs and their followers
halted, and in native fashion, with
uplifted arms, in chorus greeted the
great white chief, who, with equal
solemnity rjefiurned the greeting
and invited them to be seated. This
they did in lines opposite to each
other, at an interval of a dozen feet,
and at right anglds to us. The White
Chief rose and in pure Zulu—the
softest and most musical of dialects,
and of which he was a thorough
master —harangued the gathering.
You must imagine the tenor of it —
of the Great White Queen, of their
fealty to her and of his offer to do
justice to each in his decision. Pic-
ture the rapt attention of each
chief and warrior; their furtive
glances towards their respective op-
ponents; the “Hurrs” and grunts of
approval or disapproval, punctuating
the speech until it closed.
Each Chieftain in turn, arose
with dignity, and in fluent and earn-
est language, now vehement, now
scornful, now appealing, presented
his case with dramatic gestures,
amid applause from his supporters.
1 hen the White Chief addressed
them again and announced his de-
cision, and called upon the Chiefs
for their answer. This given, the
palaver ended, and after salutations
we watched each party as it wound
in and out on its homeward path.
In state they came—in state they
withdrew. Peace had been re-
stored and fealty to the Great White
Queen —then alas! so near the end
of her glorious reign—renewed.
It was an engrossing spectacle
and, as our C.O. pointed out, one
unique for white men to witness.
Put it seemed a pity that a cere-
mony so picturesque, conducted
with such dignity and in such a ro-
mantic setting, should have been
marred by civilisation’s inevitable
first-fruits—incongruity of costume.
H. D. FORBES.
THE CHILDREN
On board the “Wahehe” there
were quite a little army of young-
sters, of all ages, sexes, sizes, and
conditions, and in consequence it
became necessary that their comfort
and happiness should be carefully
considered. A Committee, of which
the personnel appears on another
page, was therefore appointed, and
as a result a Kindergarten was es-
tablished, sports and games were
regularly held—certain portions of
the deck and day being reserved for
the children’s use —and in general,
everything was done, that could be
done on such a crowded boat as the
“Wahehe,” for their welfare. Des-
pite the conditions of the Red Sea
passage, very little infantile sick-
ness was reported and none of any
seriousness. Opportunity was taken
of the presence of so many mothers
and children on board, for the de-
livery of a lecture on the care and
treatment of children in the tropics,
which function (being aided by the
dispensation of afternoon tea and
music, and the revealing to the
mothers of the future of their babies
by the pair of celebrated Cassandras
whom we had on board) was
largely attended and proved a great
success. A word of praise must be
specially given to Mr. Walker for
his thoughtful kindness in devoting
an hour or so every morning to ar-
ranging and superintending games
amongst the youngsters. A more
detailed account of the special
sports meeting for children, which
was held on the afternoon of the 4th
December, is given elsewhere by
our special representative at the
function.
MR. BUTCHER “SPEAKS HIS
PIECE.”
One of the most enjoyable and
instructive social features of the voy-
age was th'e series of lectures de-
livered by Mr. B. T. Butcher, of
the Y.M.C.A. They were given bi-
weekly and were finely illustrated
by an electric lantern, operated by
W.-O. Dart and Sgt. Simmonds.
The first th ree lectures were de-
voted to New Guinea—or “Par-
poo-a”—as Mr. Butcher properly
and firmly insists on calling it. In
these lectures the speaker gave us
his own experiences during 12
years among this, the largest island
in the world, telling stories of
travel and explaining and describ-
ing som,e of the difficulties of the
pioneer.
But by far the most interesting
lectures of the series were those
which Mr. Butcher entitled : “White
Australia and Its Coloured Neigh-
bours.” There were four of these
and they dealt respectively and in
that order, with China, India, Japan,
and Africa. Of these the Japanese
lecture was easily the one wfiich
held us.most. It resolved itself
into not only a description of the
past and present life of this great


people, but also into a prophesy of
what the future relations with Aus-
tralia might be. “Shall Militarism
or Commercialism dominate New
Japan, or can we help her to find a
happier basis for her life?” This
was the question dealt with by the
lecturer, and he took as his text,
the words of that well-known Jap-
anese Statesman, Count Okuma:
“This problem cannot be solved by
warfare, diplomacy, or legislation;
but only by the Christians apply-
ing their principles to these prac-
tical problems of international life.”
Thje lecturer has a happy, tact-
ful, and earnest method of delivery,
in which the saving salt of humour
plays a prominent part. As a con-
sequence the lectures were all
largely attended and heartily ap-
preciated by those who heard them.
Mention should be made, while
on the subject of lectures, that a
special lantern lecture on “The
Earth’s Neighbours in Space” was
delivered by Major Wackett in the
Saloon Lounge on the evening of
the Bth December to a numerous
audience; and that on the 3rd De-
cember Major General Ryrie gave
us a fascinating account of the work
of the Light Horse in Palestine,
prefaced with a short account of
the political position in Egypt. Both
addresses were listened to with the
greatest interest.
THE CHILDREN’S SPORTS.
December 4, 1919.
No list of events or prize-winners is
necessary, as the afternoon was one con-
tinuous delight for both children and
adult spectators and the success was so
uniform among competitors that no
child escaped the honour of winning at
least one tempting prize.
A hunt for nuts opened the afternoon.
Ladies and gentlemen mysteriously
poked nuts into all manner of nooks
and crannies, and . the children then
opened a massed attack on the hidden
treasure, the winner succeeding in plac-
ing 61 nuts.
Then came the Potato Race, hotly
and evenly contested, and the young-
sters showed they were masters of the
art equally with their elders. Wild ex-
citement and jumping and laughter her-
alded the sack race—a very pretty sight,
with pillow-slips for the diminutive legs,
followed by the Hopping Race, like all
the others evenly contested, strictly ac-
cording to rules, and with Col. Kings-
cote captaining the tiniest mites, just
as successfully as if they were members
of a most hopeful tennis team.
The foot race took a whole length
of deck, and the ages and sizes of chil-
dren was so varied that the handicap-
ping spread the competitors over two-
thilrds of the course.
Then came the great event (the Tug-
of War) —four a-side—furious pulling—
Col. Kingscote in his element inculcat-
ing the elements of team work. Three
pulls, and a dead heat! Prizes for
everybody; all happy.
Then games, and while the Blind
Man’s Buff is in full swing the announce-
ment —“Tea Ready” is heard. What a
rush! What a spread! Long tables of
goodies, gorgeous trifles, brilliantly col-
oured icings, shivering jellies, dainty
sandwiches and what appetites! The
S.M.O. has such a beaming face! He
has taken the children’s temperatures
for the ship’s returns before the ban-
quet!
Mrs. Williams distributed the prizes
to the excited children, who gave her
three cheers as a grand finale—three
ringing, deafening, lusty cheers. Thus
ended a most amusing and successful
afternoon, very gratifying to the Child-
ren’s Committee, and with hearty thanks
to the ship’s staff for their care, trouble
and work.
G.S.K.
IN THE LIBRARY OF THE
MIDDLE TEMPLE.
(N.B. —The badge of the Middle Temple
is the ‘‘Holy Lamb,” or “Agnus Dei.”)
I sat beneath the Angel-wings,
Wherefrom the shadow’d roof
In wooden lace-work vaults, and flings
Its carven web and woof.
I heard from somewhere far outside
The mutter of the street —
The dim and ever-flowing tide
Which floods the banks of Fleet.
And thro’ the open window-way
Was borne that fountain’s song,
Amid whose shaded, iris’d spray
So many memories throng.
Out from the books in ordered rows,
With but a dim surprise,
I felt the very souls of those
Who wrought and lov’d them, rise.
They spoke of whom those walls had
known,
Down thro’ the freighted years;
They gave to every blacken’d stone
It’s tale of hopes and fears.
They told of many a cloistered walk,
Where, still, on silent shoon,
Dim shades amid the shadows talk
Beneath the mid-night moon.
Oh! Storied Inn, where peace is found
Beneath the “Lamb of God,”
I feel that thine is holy ground,
Where I should walk unshod!
And tho’ I lack the fitting word
To hymn thy hallow’d dust,
Like some rough-voiced, but eager, bird,
Who only knows his heart is stirred,
I sing because I must.
—S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
THE FANCY-DRESS BALL.
Various dances were held on
board during the trip, both in the
saloon and aft. The former were ar-
ranged by the Dance Sub-Commit-
tee, and the latter by the Warrant
Officers and Sergeants. The latter
were partciularly successful, invi-
tations being extended to, and ac-
cepted by (among others) General
and Lady Ryrie and the Misses
Ryrie, Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. Wil-
liams, Major and Mrs. Strachan,
Capt. and Mrs. Hain, Lieut, and
Mrs. Skipper, Lieut, and Mrs. Hol-
lins* Mrs. and Miss Shannon, Mrs.
Bond, the Misses Stroud, Sheppard.
Jenkins and Cannon, and Sisters
Robertson, Lummer, Cobcroft,
Smith, and Cheke. Good music
was supplied on each occasion by
the Jazz Band, assisted by various
volunteers, and though the space
was necessarily limited and the
movement of the ship added new
and unexpected steps and figures, the
enjoyment was thereby all the more
accentuated. But the great social
event of the voyage was the Fancy
Dress Ball, held on the forward
deck on the evening of Tuesday,
the 2nd December. Arranged at
short notice the affair was taken up
with spirit by everybody and the re-
sult was a perfectly amazing and
spectacular success. No less than
115 dancers appeared in fancy cos-
tumes, and th e preliminary parade
before the judges (Lieut.-Col.
and Mrs. Williams, Commander
Mackenzie, Lieut.-Col. Kingscote
and Mrs. Bond) would have done
credit to the artists at the Albert
Hall. All the costumes were pre-
pared on the ship and the resource-
fulness of the wearers was as great
as the effect was picturesque.
The judges, by a process of
elimination, gradually reduced the
competitors for the prize costumes
to 11 for the best sustained charac-
ter and to 6 for the most original
dress. The final decision among
these was left to chance, and for
the best character dress Dr. Muir-
head won the prize as “Chu-Chin-
Chow,” while Mrs. Newmarch se-
cured the trophy in the original
class with her well carried-out rep-
resentation of “Lemon Squash”
Supper was provided by the
Ship, and for those who did not


dance, a most diverting and keenly
contested series of “stunts” and
competitions was held in the saloon
lounge by Lieut. Butcher and Sgt.
Napier. Some of the entries in the
Limerick, Riddle, Verse and Tele-
gram Competitions were distinctly
clever—the prize winners in the
last named event being so particu-
larly g*ood that they are certainly
worthy of commemoration here.
The idea was that a telegram was
to be sent to the Prime Minister of
Australia, consisting of nine words,
such words starting with the letters
of the word “Australia” in proper
order. The first prize was awarded
to Lieut. Hough for the follow-
ing:—“ Arriving utterly stony —try
redeem all loans —I ;
while Sergeant Webb ran a close
second with “Arriving under
steam to-morrow —request addi-
tional leave if allowable.”

THE WAHEHE “LANGHAM
CLUB” EXHIBITION.
We were fortunate to have with
us, on the “Wahehe,” special-
ists in almost all departments
of art and science. Indeed, if
the occasion had arisen our
company could have successfully
turned their hands, as one enthusi-
ast put it, to “anything from boots
to botany with a side line in Greek
verse.” It was therefore, not sur-
prising, in a sense, that the decision
to hold an exhibition of the works
of the artists aboard the ship
should have been carried to a tri-
umphant success. Over 80 ex-
hibits were “hung,” all of them,
save three, the work of some mem-
ber of our passenger list and a
great number of them, having been
actually painted or drawn on the
ship during the voyage. An inter-
ested and appreciative queue of
sight-seers thronged the exhibition
all the afternoon and gave the works
of art (several of which are repro-
duced in this volume) the atten-
tion and admiration that they de-
served.

Can’t he see its eleven
By the mantelpiece clock?
There! I’ve done it! The Block
Has sat here like a rock
Since a quarter past seven.
There! I’ve done it! The Block!
Can’t he see it’s eleven?

What! A yawn? Oh, Great Scot!
I must really he going,
’Stead of love-smiles I’ve got

With embarrassment glowing.
What a yawn! Oh, Great Scot!—

CROSSING THE LINE.
On the 27th November, at pre-
cisely 25 minutes to 2 in the after-
noon. we crossed the equator and
the ship was honoured by a surprise
visit from King Neptune and his
Court. Clad in more than regal
majesty and a vast quantity of
“hair,” armed with his trident and
followed by his dainty spouse and
fearsome retinue, the monarch of
the ocean paraded the decks and
finally held a levee on the well deck.
Finding on board but few who had
the honour of visiting his realms
for the first time, his majesty was
fain to arraign victims on various
fearsome charges. It mattered not
whether one were a general or a
“digger” —if your name was on the
Executioner’s little list you came
up and “went in.” For, following
a system apparently compounded
from those in vogue in Wonderland
and at the French Revolution, ac-
cusation was synonomous with con-
viction —and it was “sentence first
evidence afterwards.” The first of-
fender to be dealt with was the O.C.
Troops, and his offence was ‘‘approv-
ing of the issue of large quantities
of intoxicating liquors to all pas-
sengers on the ship.” Despite his
plea of u not guilty,” the criminal
was lathered and shaved and dip-
ped and ducked in quick order, to
be replaced within the dock by Gen-
eral Ryrie. This “old offender” re-
fused to plead at all to the charge
of “false pretences in that he joined
the Light Horse, well knowing he
weighed 17 stone,” and created a
scene in court by endeavouring to
duck the barber. Fortunately for
the course of justice, the latter
'Tide-stepped” in time, with the re-
sult that the prisoner received the
reward of his guilty actions with
even greater celerity and complete-
ness than his predecessor. A pro-
cession of unfortunates followed,

including the members of the Davis
Cup Challenge Team, who were
jointly and severally charged, sen-
tenced, and ‘‘dealt with” for ‘Ton-
spiring to wrest the aforesaid
Davis Cup from its proper holders,”
until the arrival within the dock of
Lieut.-Col. Brown, charged with
“being the chief of a clique of un-
desirable men who failed to uphold
their reputation in a recent sporting
event known as a tug-of-war, there-
by rendering themselves liable to
the suspicion of having been bought
with pieces of silver.” To this ter-
rible indictment the prisoner, who
is evidently a hardened ruffian, not
only refused to plead but set upon
the officers of the court with in-
tent to provoke physical injury
upon them. His action was evi-
dently a pre-arranged signal —for
immediately the rest of the tribe of
sans-culottes and miscreants who
were awaiting trial rushed the tri-
bunal and in a moment all was con-
fusion. We regret to say that as a
result of the melee which followed
the forces of law and order got the
worst of it and the dignity and
majesty of the Neptunian Deity was
as completely disregarded as if he
had been a mere commoner. With
indignation and apprehension we
watched from a secure vantage
point his throne overthrown and
his person thrown over, his barber
barbarously treated and his doc-
tors docked. Even the fair partner
of his fortunes —the noble Amphi-
trite —was ingloriously dealt with
and with a shameful display of lin-
gerie and —er —lower limb, was
spreadeagled in the bath. Finally
a base Israelite dared to direct the
water from the ship’s hose upon the
struggling rabble, and that, in the
classic phrase, “bust up the show”
completely. A sad and disgruntled
crowd of courtiers withdrew to
staunch their wounds, their gar-
ments clinging like cerements and
the emblems of their once potent
sway all bent and broken. It was
a solemn lesson on the brevity of
pomp which it is to be hoped will
not be lost upon those who wit-
nessed it. With a view to placing
upon record the principals in this
sad affair we publish herewith a
list of those concerned, preceding
it with some of the charges upon
which the prisoners—other than
those already mentioned —were, or
should have been, indicted.
Cooper (Capt.)—Conduct to the pre-
judice of good order and military discip-
line in that he devoted too much time to
his manicuring.
S.-Sergt. Nutte.—For fraudulently im-
posing as an invalid and soliciting sym-
pathy from the Nursing Staff, and
continually occupying the starboard
boat on the Poop Deck.
Sergt. Napier.—-For inflicting “News
of the World’ 7 on the people when their
time was required for honey-mooning.
Sergt. Webb. —For refusing point
blank to give song and amusement to
passengers on His Majesty’s Ship
“Wahehe.”
W.-O. Alexander.—For accepting the
position of Ship’s Sergeant Major when
he was of such a retiring and modest
disposition.
Lieut. Berry.—For entering for Sports
under the assumed name of Berry, well
knowing that his correct name was
“’Arry.”
Major Isaacson. —For having ordered
Eggs and Bacon from the Stewards for
all breakfasts.
Chaplain Captain Harvey. —For being
a member of a notorious gang, who
principally pass their time playing that
Australian School Game—“Two-Up.”
Here follow the mortal names tem-
porarily assumed by the Monarch of
the Sea and his suite while visiting the
ship:—Neptune, W.-O. Gray; Amphi-
trite, Lieut. Fleiter; Counsel for Prose-
cution, Major Nobbs; The Doctor,
Major May; The Doctor’s Assistant,
Hon. Lieut. Ingram; The Barber,
R.Q.M.S. Burton; The Barber’s Assist-
ant, Sergt. W. Brown; The Court Crier,
W.-O. Collins; The Court Jester, Q.M.S.
Herbert; The Nurse, Lieut. Mcßain;
Courtiers and others: Capt. Lamrock,
Lieut, Brown, Lieut. Butler, W.-O. Wil-
liams, W.-O. Clarke, C.S.M. Hunter and
W.-O. McGregor.
Prizes for the best costumes were
awarded to W.-O. Collins (first) for his
“get up” as a Scarecrow, and to Lieut.
Fleiter (second) for his charming im-
personation of the sea nymph “Amphi-
trite.”
THE GOLDEN RULE,
Hammer on, steadily all the time
And you’ll fashion your fortune securely.
In fair days or foul ones, remember the
rhyme:
“Hammer on steadily all the time!”—
It swings to the ear like Dick Whitting-
ton’s chime,
And rings out its message as surely.
Hammer on steadily all the time,
And you’ll fashion your fortune se-
curely.

Oh! Love is a usurer-pirate,
Most anxious rich profits to earn.
We pledge him our hearts at a high
For Love is a usurer-pirate!—
And when we pay up we are irate
To find he our pledge won’t return;
For Love is a usurer-pirate,
Most anxious rich profits to earn!

DADDY ANZAC.
Much water has flowed under the
bridge of Time since the free-born Aus-
tralian voluntarily threw in his lot with
the Empire and Allies and made his first
stand on the rough coast of old Gal-
lipoli. All that he has done as a sol-
dier is now a matter of history, but
‘Digger’ has turned a new page in his
book. He has turned from the red
blood-stained leaf of war, to the clean
white page of Peace.
The question is “How is Mr. Aussie
shaping in his new role?”
C3ne needs to be on a family trans-
port to get a glint of the warrior being
transformed back to the lamb.
One may see a sturdy Anzac, who, in
pre-war days was way-back on some
sheep station, doing a bit of wool-
chopping, or branding steers on a
Queensland run, wearing a red stripe
and four blues on his sleeve and a
brass “A” not far from his biceps, now
holding a skein of wool for his war
bride or nursing the baby.
Daddy Anzac is not a bad nurse. He
grips the kid with a strong confidence
as if he owned it.
Never did new-won brides re-
ceive more tender and detailed care,
She is loved so much that Mr. Digger
does not like to lose sight of her. It
isn’t that he hasn’t unbounded faith in
his new “Missus” —but he knows his
cobbers.
Some raw-boned Tasmanian or log
chopper from Gippsland who can swing
“Douglas” as easy as a conductor’s
baton or a bit of lead “drops his bundle
and his name is mud,” when some
mild-eyed bit of fluff from Blighty looks
at him. Simply looks at him and
hooks him.
Man, great man, “kids himself” that
he’s strong, and brave, and resolute,
and determined.
It’s camouflage.
One look of Love and he’s down on
his marrow bones, with both hands up
in the air yelling—“Kamerad!”
It puts the breeze up him quicker
than a Mills Bomb.
Daddy Anzac is learning to be a
father and is making good. His wife
is looking towards Australia as a land
flowing with milk and babies.
God bless ’em! There is room in
Australia for the lot.
—A. J. HAMPSON.


SUNSET ON SINAI.
All day long, as the steamer
passed, the mountains of Sinai lay
in sunshine, and beautiful indeed
they looked across that blue shim-
mering sea, with the mellow haze
of distance softening their harsh
and savage outlines.
It was with a curious awe that
one gazed upon these mountains,
on whose highest peak the sacred
law was first given to mankind, and
which look down upon the same
wilderness that ancient Israel trod
in travail and bitterness for forty
years.
Though it was difficult to realise
the fact that one was looking on
the actual scene of events which
marked such an epoch in the history
of mankind, one may venture the
assertion that even the passing of
this historic shore as a traveller, in
the sweltering Eastern sunshine,
must bring the mind to a juster ap-
preciation of that old sustained
trial of endurance and faith.
A scorched and barren land it
looks, and one could fancy it al-
most without life, save perhaps for
those few poor forms which had
survived by natural selection in a
pitiless environment. Here and
there one notices small beaches of
sand; but more generally it is
brown rock which meets the water’s
edge. Beyond are ridges with no
trace of vegetation to be seen, and
miniature ranges worn down to a
few hundred feet in height by the
slow attrition of time; and behind
them, again, are higher spurs and
ridges lifting gradually with almost
geometrical precision to the great
peaks, which here reach an altitude
of 8,000 feet.
A savage scene in reality, yet
transformed by distance, sun, and
shadow into one of ethereal beauty.
Walls and bastions of rose and saf-
fron, with shadows deep as purple
pansies; brown rock castles with
the sun shining warmly on their
ancient battlements, with here and
there fretted pinnacles of stone ris-
ing through the blue mist like far-
off cathedral spires; sheer faces,
like red geranium fields on terraced
gardens, overhanging enchanted
villages; a golden shore sparkling
and steeping its edges in a torquoise
sea. All these I saw —at least with
the eye of fancy. For one might
imagine anything with such an ever-
changing pageant of colour before
one’s eyes, such as these magic hills
presented during the late after-
noon.
And thus it was in lighter vein
1 dreamed. Perchance it may have
been the influence of that corn-
flower-blue sea over which we
sailed; but suddenly there came to
me the thought that over there lay
the crystal hills themselves, known
to me in the fairy stories of long
ago. Known to me, aye! and to
many another also; but never
reached by any of us, however long
and ardently we dreamed. For they,
too, were coral pink and the light
shone through them from side to
side and from base to lovely sum-
mit they were all made from sugar-
candy !
But, indeed, there was enough
of magic in the scene without en-
listing the aid of fancy. The sun
sank behind the western hills and
the whole Eastern shore glowed
like a rose-garden seen through a
mist of amethyst. Pale blue was
the waveless sea, while near the
shore there ran a narrow ribbon of
a deeper azure. Then above the
mountain tops the sky changed
again, and the water, reflecting this,
turned to a pale luminous green —
a strange and beautiful effect sav-
oring of unreality, of pink moun-
tains caught between pale green
sky and sea. And now from mo-
ment to moment, almost, the can-
vas altered. Peaks in the shadow
caught the afterglow; while on the
slopes of others the blue shadows
deepened into black. Tone by tone,
as the light waned, the splendor of
the colour-scheme faded into more
tender harmonies—pale pink and
smoke-grey mist with a faint blue
wash of sea. Then the last flicker-
ing fires died out among* the hills,
which lay now in mist of grey with
no line visible between opaline sea
and shore. The slopes of the wes-
tern mountains were in deep
shadow; but with every ridge, and
col, and peak, clear cut against the
primrose of the sky—a delicate
austere effect in high light and
shadow.
Then suddenly the light went,
like a candle blown out by the wind,
leaving only dark water and blue-
black sky with its quiet stars. Night
had come.

THE DAVIS CUP.
(Air: “Bonnie Dundee.”).
To the Lords of Lawn Tennis ’twas
Beamish who spoke:
“If our Kingscote go down there’s
still Lowe to be broke;
And if, like himself, his dark head should
lie ‘Lowe!’
Why, hang it, may Lords, there is
still me to go!”
Chorus:
“So we'll go for the Cup and we’ll go
for the men;
Tho’ they’ve beaten us once, we
may beat them again—
O’Hara and Norman and Patt —all the
three—
May go down 'neath the racquets
of L.K. and B.”
“Let us rush from the base-line and
play at the net,
And volley the beggars each chance
we can get;
For the labouring years have their hold
upon Brookes
And Patterson's serve’s not so hard
as it looks.”
Chorus:
“So we’ll go for the Cup and we’ll go
for the men;
There’s always the chance of good
luck now and then;
But we’ll have to strike boldly, or else
it will be
All up with the chance of Lowe,
Kingscote and me!”

OUR DEBATING SOCIETY.
Committee: President, Lieut. Skip-
per; Secretary, Lieut. Barnes; Mem-
bers: Lieut.-Col. Brown, Lieut. Linton
Smith, H.-Lieut, Ingram, W.-O. Os-
borne, W.-O. Williams, Cpl. Linane,
Pte. Narraway, Mrs. Bond and Mrs.
Hain.
Since the days when the Sphinx pro-
pounded her famous question and gob-
bled up all those who failed to answer
it correctly, we have progressed con-
siderably. For instance, there is no
riddle which the “Wahehe Debating-
Society’’ could not solve. Its fame—
on board—became so great that the
Skipper undertook to transmit the re-
sult of its deliberations to Mr. Lloyd
George and “Billy” Hughes, but unfor-
tunately the wireless broke down at the
mere suggestion. Only through the
medium of this journal, therefore, can
its good work be made known.


The first subject handled was “Con-
tinental Cafes versus Aussie Pubs,” and
it was entrusted to experts. W.-O.
Gray and Cpl. Linane advocated the
Continental system, whilst W.-O. Wil-
liams and Sergt. Napier sang the praises
of the devil we know. The debate took
place in the Red Sea and resulted in a
triumph for the Aussie Pubs. It was
thought, however, that had some of
us regained our sea legs after our ex-
periences at Port Said, the result might
have been different. We next tackled
the “Nationalisation of Monopolies,”
and in one and the same evening de-
cided that Governments were the worst
employers, and politicians the most,
supine of men. Mrs. Hain and Lieut.-
Col. Brown were the advocates of Na-
tionalisation, but the destructive critic-
ism of Capt. Gaze and Lieut. Saunder-
son won the vote for the “Noes.” The
“League of Nations” was next consid-
ered, Lieut. Hampson and Col. Rolland
leading off in its favour and winning
against the opposition of Major Wac-
kett and Capt. Burnell.
During the last fortnight of the
voyage two further debates were
held, the first on the advisability
of forming a non-exclusive and
Political Returned Soldiers’ Association
being a very tame affair in which Lieut.
Skipper supported by W.-O. Lindo were
opposed to the proposal and S.-Sgt.
Davies led in its support. The opposi-
tion won. The last debate of the series
was held on the night of the nth De-
cember, and as the subject was “Should
Bachelors be Taxed?” a huge audience
was assured. Sergt. Napier and Major
Strachan were the leaders for taxation;
Capt. Allen and W.-O. Brighouse spoke
against it. Despite their efforts the
final vote was in favour of the tax. The
debates have throughout been well at-
tended, all parts of the ship contribut-
ing their quota, both of debaters and
listeners. The ladies, also, took a large
and active part in the proceedings, and.
altogether, the evenings devoted to the
Debating Society were among the most
pleasant of the voyage.
[The above report was contributed by
an esteemed supporter of this paper,
and although the reference to one_ of
our staff as an “expert” on the subject
of “Aussie Pubs” is unkind, we have not
the heart to delete it, but print it more
in sorrow than in anger.—Ed. “W.B.”]
IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS.
(By Lieut. L. H. Skipper).
Scene—At Demob, Somewhere in
London.
Demob. Sgt. (yawning): Taking the
girl to tea s’arfternoon, Corp?
Demob. Corp.: No, Sarge.
Sergt.: What about allotting berths
on the “Wahehe?” ,
Corp.: When’s she going?
Sergt. We’ve sent out notices for
the 3rd or later, 10th or later, and 26th
or later.
Corp.: Seems quite definite —Who’ve
yer got?
Sergt.: There’s a lot of single loots.
Corp.: Put ’em in the single cabins
on the promenade deck. They can go
to bed late without disturbing the other
passengers.
Sergt.: What about senior officers?
Corp.: Shove ’em down the hold.
Nice and quiet there! ’Sides they can
talk about the way they won the war
without annoying the junior officers.
Sergt.: Now the women an’ kids!
Corp.: I aint up in babies. Don’t
they amuse each other?
Sergt.'. I think so. We'll put ’em
three in a cabin, to make sure!
Corp.: What about “Glaxo?”
Sergt.: Fat lot you know; they feeds
little Diggers on bully beef nowadays.
Corp.: Right oh! No “Glaxo!” Now,
there’s the ’usbands. Stick ’em well
away from their wives. It’ll be a holi-
day for ’em, and they won’t be wakened
up by their own kids.
Sergt.: ’Ere; we’ve got too many
aboard.
Corp.; Let’s ’ave a look! No, you
’aven’t; there’s no one allotted to the
swimming bath!
And that’s how the "“Wahehe” re-
ceived her complement of passengers.
11.
Buying—At Colombo.
——o
Officer (to Native) : How much these
beads, boy?
Native: Three rupees, master!
Officer (firmly): . Three rupees, be
blowed. Give you two!
Native C 1 cWingly) : Two fifty, mas-
ter !
Officer (less firmly): Two rupees!
Native (boldly): Two fifty, master!
Digger (arriving on scene): What’s
the matter, sir?
Officer: This blighter wants two
fifty for his beads, and I won’t give him
more than two!
Digger (seizing beads): Let’s have
a look at them. (After inspection):
Seventy-five cents!
Native: Oh, no, master! Two rupees!
Digger: Seventy-five cents, I tell you!
Mative: Oh, no, master; me lose, mas-
ter! Cost me two rupees! One rupee
seventy-five, master!
Digger: Seventy-five cents!
Native: Me poor man, master! One
rupee fifty, master.
Digger: Seventy-five cents. Not a
penny more!
Native: Me no father and mother,
master! No rice for two days, master!
One rupee twenty-five, master!
Digger: No! Seventy-five cents!
Native: You have it, master!
AT THE CORNER TABLE.
There are six of them at the table,
three wives and three silent husbands.
The three wives chatter gaily and a
character goes at every fresh spurt of
the conversation. “They say some of
the women want the bath open for the
afternoon; but it’s no use to me,” moans
Mrs. Costs, “I haven’t a bathing gown,”
Mrs. Medico smiles: “I have one; but
it’s too small.” Then one of the silent
husbands speaks up—addressing the
marble walls. “Why do women want
bathing gowns? We don’t!”
Silence is unbroken for the space of
three minutes. Then the second silent
husband moves uneasily on his chair
and glances timidly at his wife —and
that spikes his guns. But the third
S.H., glancing at his spouse, notices
that she is swallowing a fish-bone. He
seizes his chance and speaks slowly:
“It’s their shape—their funny shape,”
he says, “They-—” Then he stops. The
fish-bone hasn’t choked her after all.
She turns upon him a petrifying glance
and the silence of the table is unbroken
for five minutes by the watch, except
for that sound that is like a cross be-
tween a “Ford” car in motion and a
German eating soup and which signifies
that Woman is thinking.
Conversation at the corner table is
usually intellectual in patches; like the
Curate’s egg—l don’t specify which
part. The Man of Law was obediently
telling his wife what had happened in
those parts of the ship not under her
immediate supervision.
“Quite a good idea, y’know,” he was
sayling. “Sang - hymns and songs about
Mother, y’know—‘Mother Macree and
Tell Mother I’ll be There,’ and all that
sort of thing, dontcherknow?”
Mrs. Man of Law was not impressed.
“I don’t know that I call that very
elevating,” she frowned; “they ought to
sing things more appropriate like—
like—” Then it came like an inspira-
tion —“Like ‘Those in Peril on the Sea’
—there’s plenty of ’em on this boat in
that position.”
MEDITATIONS OF A SENSIBLE
GIRL ON THE BOAT DECK OF
THE s.s. “WAHEHE.”
When to Austral’s sunny shores you
wend your way
And routine follows routine day by day,
On board the liner.
One wishes then for something more
diverting
Than talking scandal, other people
hurting;
Far better do a little harmless flirting:—
M’yes, that’s finer.
But then, where is the flirting without
harm;
’Tis difficult the critics to
They are so knowing.
I’m sure they won’t believe in moder-
ation
They’ll talk, and that just causes irri-
tation
The matter wants some re-considera-
tion;
M’yes— l’ll do some sewing!
—D. MACKENZIE.

“Good idea!” agreed the Medico, who
has been there. “Might liven it up,
too, with a strategic map of the boat
deck. What—what!"
Then they dropped that subject also.
In the hush that comes 'twixt plum
pudding and dessert, the long-eared
man was telling the nightly tale of his
scandalous neighbours. “There she
was,” he said, “with her head out of the
port-hole, as tight as could be.”
He glanced around to see the effect
of his words. The air was full of it.
Five pairs of eyes met_ his, alive with a
new hope. Five pairs of hands stretched
towards five imaginary glasses. Five
dry tongues beat the roofs of five dry
mouths, as they breathed their breath-
less aspiration:—“ Where did she get it?”

YEO HO !
Yeo ho! to the winds that be;
Yeo ho! to the rolling sea.
We have left the land where the old oak
grows;
We have left the land where the old
Thames flows;
We have left the streams where the
boatman rows,
For Home and Aussie.
Yeo ho! to the ships that sail;
Yeo ho! to the roaring gale.
We laugh with careless and wayward
glee,
We laugh at the spray and the rolling
sea;
We laugh as we rock on the “Wahehe,”
For Home and Aussie.
Yeo ho! to the birds that fly;
Yeo ho! to the changing sky.
We look with a keen and anxious eye;
We look as the ancient lands pass by;
We look and remember with deep-drawn
sigh.
Our Home in Aussie.
Yeo ho! to the land that’s mine
Yeo ho! to the southern clime
Yeo ho! to the land that breeds the free
Yeo ho! to that land from sea to sea
Yeo ho! Australia that is to be
My Home My Aussie!

HERE AND THERE.
Though the sea and sky were blue
enough the day we left for Suez,
it was a grey one for somebody. But
perhaps it was only that he had the
blues, too.
By an extraordinary coincidence, de-
spite the heat of the trip from Suez
onwards, we have had Snow and Frost
with us all the time. Indeed, the night
was so “thick” at Port Said that a
heavy fall of Snow was recorded there
for the first time in history.
Whisky talks, they say. But what
was it Port Said?
The street sweepers near Horseferry
Road have adopted the Aussie head-
gear as a sort of trade mark. A Digger,
observing them when on leave for the
first time recently, remarked amazedly:
“So that’s how you put in your N.M.E.,
is it?”
The Boat Deck may—and doubtless
does —afford an opportunity for seclus-
ion which is not entirely disregarded;
but the Poop Deck aft is rather a nutty
—we mean natty—little cosey-corner,
also.
There has been no sea-sickness
amongst the Diggers, we are informed,
The one who was seen leaning over
the side in a suspicious attitude, subse-
quently explained, in a voice stifled ap-
parently by emotion, that he had been
merely observing the coral growing at
a great depth.
Ever since the voyage started there
has been a constant demand at the Can-
teen for Eno’s Fruit Salts. Please pass
along the lyre of Omar:—*
The sufferer no question makes about
his woes;
But straight-way to the Ship’s Can-
teen he goes
And there gulps down what will
great soothment yield:—
Eno’s —about a glass—Eno’s!—Eno’s!
From a hasty observation, made dur-
ing the passage of the Red Sea, we be-
lieve that the sands of the desert have
not yet grown cold—not so that you
would notice it, anyway. So the Be-
douin who sings his love song in the
smoke lounge aft, must hang on to her
a while longer
The question of the Vanity Bag is
still disturbing the community. Whose
was It? Where was it found? And,
above all, WHO found it? Our staff
of professional sleuths still being en-
gaged upon the Missing Mirror Mys-
tery (what a title for a film thriller!)
the V.B. matter must be left to any
amateur Sherlock Holmes who cares to
tackle it. Couldn’t the “Mysterious
Aubrey” do anything?
During one of the Tugs-of-War at
the Ship’s Sports Meeting, a kiddie was
heard to remark: “Oh, there’s my daddy
at one end and a man at the other!”
Now what did he mean by that?
Colombo is spelt in some old Span-
ish maps —“Coalon-Boa.” When you
see them put “Col-on-Boa’d” there you
will see how very nearly correctly the
old Dons got it. But why we should
stay there for that purpose it is im-
possible to understand, for we’ve al-
ways had enough Cole on board, good-
ness knows!
This did not happen to one of the
ship’s personnel—or, if it did, it must
have been long ago when he was poor
and honest. A certain young Hard-up
was in doubt as to what to give his in-
amorata on her birthday. Putting his
perplexity to a friend, the latter solved
it in this way—“ Nothing easier. You’ve
just taken up engineering, haven’t you?
Well, keep the engine for yourself and
give her the ear-ring!”
A certain Officer who purchased
some white shoes at Port Said, found,
latet on, that the wily heathen had sold
him two for the one foot. Still, as the
shoes were, in a manner of speaking,
“all right,” and the Officer was in every
sense of the word “left,” there is
a certain amount of squaring up on the
deal.
The steering-gear has been playing-
up recently. But there were compensa-
tions, as witness the following:—
They sat together on the Deck,
Beneath the moon, and tho’
He strongly urged her to be his,
She meant to answer: “No!”
Just then the steering-gear went
wrong;
The Ship described an “S”;
It put the poor girl off her course
And so she whispered: “Yes!”
Dialogue heard at the Sergeants’
Mess:—
Ist Three Stripe: What’s this we’ve
been eating, Sarge?
2nd Three Stripe (referring to menu) :
Rag-out of Mutton!
Ist Three Stripe: H’m, they seem to
have left the rag in mine!
At the. Officers’ Bath one day lately
an enraged queue were kept waiting
beyond the limits of their patience.
They hammered at the closed door and
yelled threats at the offender within—
all to no purpose. One by one they
desisted and departed in despair—all
except one who, with the lust for ven-
geance written all over him, sat on.
and ever on, determined to have it out
with the delinquent. Half an hour had
passed and still the door remained un-
opened. At this point the bath steward
appeared—“What’s the trouble, sir?” he
asked, in surprise. The reply of the
waiting nemesis is unquotable. “Oh,”
said the steward, “There’s no one in
there, sir—you’ve been turning the’andle
the wrong way—it sticks a bit”—and he
flung the door open as he spoke, reveal-
ing the empty bath-room. There is no
record of the sequel; but it is doubtful
if the whole remainder of the voyage
will be sufficient for the indignant one
to do justice to the occasion. And he’s
pretty fluent, too!


Ihe Menu on Armistice Day con-
tained the items “Consommc-a-Allies"
and “Fouding Foch." judging by the
appearance of the former the Alliance
is not one of blood; while as for the
latter we hope it was intended as a
compliment to the brave old Marshall—
but we have our doubts. The M.O.
should see to it that no further similar
outbursts are permitted, or the conse-
quences may be deplored. We are a
healthy ship, so far—but if we are to
remain so we think it is necessary that
the “Pouding” supplied should be of the
common or garden English variety; spelt
with two d’s’ and no “O”—either in it or
after it!
SONGS FOR PERSONS AND
PLACES:
For the G.0.C.. A.1.F., Egypt:—“l am
the very model of a modern Major-
Giniral.”
For the O.C. Troops:—“ Back I came
with my little lot.”
For the P.M.O.:—“Pm Sorry I made
you cry!”
For the ist Class Saloon:—“I dreamt
that I dwelt in marble halls.”
For the 2nd Class Saloon:—“In aft-er
Days.”
For Captains and Loots:—“ The Pip-
Squeak.”
For the Orderly Officer:—“A Perfect
Day.”
For Subs, and Sgts.:—“Stars and
Stripes for Ever.”
For the Ship’s Q.M.: —“This Little
Shop will Soon Belong to Me.”
For W.O’s.:—“Ah WO is me!”
For the Orderly Sergt.:—“l Do All
the Dirty Work.”
For “Other Ranks”:—“The Singing-
Soldiers.”
For “Indulgence” Passengers:—“ The
Charmed Cup.”
For Civilians:—“My name is Walker.”
For Stewards: —“I Hear You Calling
Me!”
For Parades:—“ Absent.”
For the Ship’s Bugler:—“ Trumpeter,
What are You Sounding Now?”
For the Crow’s Nest:—“Oh, dear;
I’ve been Seeing a Lot of Funny Things
Lately!”
For the Boat Deck:—“ For Me and
My Gal.”
For the Whole Ship: “Coming
Home.”
(N.B. —The Commander of the Ship
says that his favourite song is “I am
Monarch of All I Survey.” This is all
very well; but we hope that he’ll elim-
inate the second line: “I am Lord of
the foul and the brute!”).
AN INTERESTING COMPARISON.
[The following article has been con-
tributed by Major I. Isaacson, and is a
translation by that gentleman of an ex-
tract from a new work entitled “Wil-
liam ll.—His Abdication and Flight,”
written by Paul Grafen Von Hoens-
broeck, who declares himself to be “a
firm believer in the dynasty of the
Hohenzolierns, but one who blames the
deeds and acts of the Emperor as the
cause of Germany’s downfall." The
book has just been published in Berlin,
and is unknown, as yet, to the outside
world. We think our readers will
agree that it affords an interesting in-
sight into the real opinion of the Junck-
ers on the ex-Emperor. Von Hoens-
broeck is a prominent figure in German
circles.—Ed.]
Let us compare, for once, William I.
as the embodiment of the old Prussian
and Hohenzollern spirit, and William
11. as the embodiment of the new.
Wm. I.—Cautious, industrious, con-
scientiously fulfilling his obligations.
Wm. ll.—Self-advertising and shun-
ning serious work.
Wm. I.—Saving; disliking pomp and
theatrical display; without pose, but
in words and deed of kingly dignity.
Wm. II. —Extravagant, pompous, con-
tinuously posing; insincere and in gen-
eral theatrical; unreliable in word and
deed.
Wm. I.—Loyal, as well as self deny-
ing; showing his gratitude to his co-
workers by act of reward rather than
by words of praise.
Wm. ll.—Full of praise, but only
with words; untrustworthy in acts,
whether towards the deserving or the
most repulsive.
Wm. I.—A soldier in the best sense,
from head to foot; asking much, but
mostly from himself; a true cavalier,
without fear or reproach.
Wm. ll.—With all the appearance of
a soldier, a lover of military trappings;
asking little from himself but much
from others; without self-restraint or
personal bravery.
Wm. I,—Unbending in the pursuit of
what had been determined as the goal
of what was necessary for Prussia-Ger-
many.
Wm. ll.—Listening to no one, swaying
here and there between big ideas and
small mindedness.
Wm. L—German King and German
Emperor for Germans; polite to For-
eign Nations and Foreigners, yet digni-
fied in manner.
Wm. ll.—Holding aloof from Ger-
mans, but attracting Foreign Nations.
Wm. I.—Although believing in the
Grace of God, yet no mystic, recognis-
ing in himself the source of Germany’s
greatness and the support of the throne.
Wm. ll.—Self-reflecting the Grace of
God—meaning himself—belittling the
people.
Wm. I.—A Christ without display.
Wm. lI.—A Christ of the theatre.
Vanity and splendour and self worship;
associating the divinity of Christ with
his own ambition.
Wm. I.—Never over-stepping the
limits of his knowlege and capabilities,
thus accomplishing great things.
Wm. IT—Never remaining within the
limits of his knowledge and abilities;
knowing everything better, doing every-
thing better —and thereby accomplish-
ing nothing.
ON A TRANSPORT.
Reveille.
The Dawn has swept her cloudy bed-
clothes wide
And, rising, rosy-flush’d from sleep,
looks round,
To hear across the waves on ev’ry side
The herald bugles of the convoy
sound.
Tattoo
Out to the Night the sobbing echoes
yearn;
The sleepers on the deck no motion
show—•
I see, within the phosphor fires astern,
What hopes, what fears, what pallid
faces glow!
—ROTIDE.
“WAHEHE PIERROTS.”
The Ship’s Concert Party, which after
a week or two, developed into a highly
efficient and attractive little troupe,
known as the “Wahehe Pierrots,” gave
a series of performances during the
voyage. All the members worked hard
to make the concerts a success, both
collectively and individually, and all of
them became popular favourites in their
various lines, “Cam’s” beautiful sing-
ing on all occasions being specially
worthy of mention. The success of the
Company, however, was mainly due to
the capable direction of Sergt, A . M.
Simmonds (the Mysterious Aubrey)
himself a Prestidigitateur and Hypnotist
of a very high order—who spared neither
time nor trouble in bringing the per-
formances to a high standard of excel-
lence. Everybody on the ship will re-
member through the years to come the
pleasant performanes of the Pierrots!
The following ladies and gentlemen
comprised the Company:—
Vocalists:
Mrs. Hunter, Miss Boyce, Miss Jen-
kins, Lieut. Burke, Lieut. Postle, W.-O.
Cameron, W.-O. Harvey, Sergt. Webb,
Staff-Sgt, Davies, Air Mechanic Hall.
Comedians:
Lieut. Hough, Warrant Officer Gray.
Instrumentalists:
Pianist, Miss Stroud; Violinist, Lieut.
Rodgers; Jazz Effects, Major Wackett.
Stage Manager: Segt. Stephenson.
Producer: Sergt. Simmonds.
In addition to the above the appre-
ciated services of many other ladies
and gentlemen have from time to time
been availed cf at special performances.
One of the most important and attractive
of these took place on the night of Satur-
day, Nov. 22nd, when a concert in aid
of “The Ship -wrecked Fishermen and
Mariners’ Royal Benevolent Society”
was given. At this entertainment
Mrs. Berry, W.-O. Lewis, W.-O.
Bridges and Sergeants Isaacs and
Brown contributed items; Mrs. Berry
giving a series of impersonations
of well known London stage identities;
W,-0. Lewis a finely-played cornet solo.


and W.-O. Bridges a most interesting
display of posing and muscle control,
followed by a clever demonstration of
jiu jitsu, assisted by Sergt. Rhodes, who
acted as foil and “horrible example”—
an unpleasant part which he bore with
good-nature and equanimity. The
item was subsequently burlesqued by
Sgts. Isaacs and Brown “Miff and Muff”
(grotesquely got up as a “promoter”
and “Strong Man” respectively) with
great effect. Mrs. Henningham, and
the Misses Shannon and Sheppard,
daintily attired in seamen’s caps and
jerseys, “took round the hat” during
the interval and raised such a goodly
sum that with the addition of the
amount obtained by the auction sale
of programmes, the total realised
amounted to £4O. During the interval,
also, Major-General Ryrie explained
the objects of the charity and presented
the sports prizes.
On the sth December, again, upon
the occasion of the final appearance of
the Pierrots, the programme was
strengthened by the contributions of
Corporal McCormack, who rendered
“The Wedding of Sandy McNab,” in
costume, with such effect that he was
the recipient of a double encore. On
this occasion, also, “The Mysterious
Aubrey” appeared in the second part
of the programme and gave us a splen-
did exhibition of conjuring and sleight
of hand. There is no doubt that in
skill and versatility “Aubrey” is a win-
ner all along the line.
Finally, on the evening of the 10th
December a concert was given by such
of the members of the Pierrots as were
still with us, assisted by other volun-
teers (several of whom might have been
called upon earlier in the voyage with
great advantage to the programmes)
and during the interval Lieut.-Col. Rol-
land, as Chairman of the General Exe-
cutive Committee of the Ship, presented
Miss Stroud with a pair of inlaid Ti-
betan vases, as a recognition of the
cheerful and capable way she had as-
sisted in all the musical events of the
voyage. The presentation was heartily
acclaimed, for Miss Stroud’s cheery
and enthusiastic help on all occasions—
even when she might well have pleaded
excuse —was undoubtedly one of the
prime factors in the success of the
“Wahehe Pierrots” in particular and
of the social life of the voyage in gen-
eral. At dances, concerts, religious ser-
vices—whenever and wherever Miss
Stroud could give assistance —that as-
sistance was forthcoming as ungrudg-
ingly as it was capable and appreci-
ated by all. The recipient was con-
siderably overcome by the unexpected
presentation, but expressed her thanks
through the medium of an interpreter.
CEYLON.
COLOMBO—KANDY.
Colombo is an important city on
the West Coast of Ceylon and has a
population of 221,000 persons. It is a
popular and almost necessary coaling
station for French, British, Chinese,
Japanese and Australian shipping.
Within its protected harbour 21
large ocean-going vessels were riding
at anchor when we arrived, and also
many craft of smaller type. The na-
tives are keen for business and are
persistent and clamorous for trade.
The business ethics of the East are
even more pronounced than the West.
“Pinch, or be pinched” is enshrined in
every act. To ask from the traveller
20 rupees for some article and then ac-
cept five rupees for it after a wordy
barrage, is common.
This is the place for the pigeons of
the world to get plucked by the crows.
The odor of the East pervades Colombo.
If Ceylon would add the God of Sani-
tation to its religious creed, and put him
on a pedestal as high as the Nelson col-
umn above the devil of filth, it would be
a greater gain than the power of self-de-
termination.
Travelling from Colombo to Kandy
(the ancient capital of the Cingalese
kings) one gets an impression of the
marvellous fertility of this chocolate-
coloured, volcanic, porous soil. Every
particle is covered with vegetation, scat-
tered with a prodigal hand. The
wealth produced from the tea-trees, the
cocoa-nut, the cocoa-bean, banana,
rice, mangoes, paw-paw and vegetables
is made possible by a hot and humid
atmosphere. The country is green as
far as the eye can reach across the
crumpled sharp-pointed hills. Arcadia
reigns supreme in the numerous deep
valleys. The light-coloured rice patches
creeping up the steep hills like irregular
terraces, stand out in sharp contrast to
the dark green of the broad banana
leaves. Water is plentiful owing
to a copious rainfall. The housing
problem presents few difficulties under
the hot atmosphere of Ceylon. Where
shade is so plentiful all that seems neces-
sary is a little mud and a mat-like
roof of reeds to make a home, if not a
palace. How the air circulates amid
the dense jungle growth is not quite
clear; but the houses of the poor (and
the bulk of the 4,500,000 inhabitants be-
long to that class) are not built to ex-
clude it. There is plenty of doorway
and open ventilation in these village
houses, but no windows. Many houses
are roofed with semi-circular red tiles.
Bricks and tiles are made by native
labor and burnt in small kilns. The
women carry the bricks on their head.
In this hilly country transport is diffi-
cult and woman as a burden bearer does
not run concurrently with Australian
sentiment. There is a long vista of
effort apparent before woman in Ceylon
is emancipated from the thraldom of
custom. Her Christian white sister in
Australia stands on velvet compared
with the dirt and degradation here.
Houses are not the great question to
these coloured people, neither are
clothes. I thought the low-cut blouses
and the yawning gaps cut out of the
back of some London and Paris cos-
tumes were fairly liberal in conception;
but they are merely interesting inci-
dents compared with the scanty cloth-
ing of the Cingalese. These people are
not immodest for lack of clothing;
they merely accommodate themselves
to nature’s beneficence by keeping
comfortably warm without it. The
piccanniny seems to be happy, straddled
on his mother’s hip.
When visiting the Buddist temple at
Kandy one is struck by the manner in
which this religious edifice is degraded
by gross commercialism and cadging.
The religious symbols and relics are
mostly crude and tawdry. It is re-
deemed in spots by clever carving in
wood and chiselling in hard stone.
The mount where legend says Buddha
left his footprints is six miles away.
Whatever good there may be in the
ethics of Buddha’s teaching, when it
produces an effect such as I saw on
one of the faithful, scantily clad in a
cotton rag, lying on the ground with
knees drawn convulsively up to his
abdomen, then extended with a jerk,
keeping rythm with estatic clapping of
his hands, eyes closed and mumbling
prayers as an Incantation; with a jam
tin near by as a receptacle for gifts;
one wonders of what use is such a
creed to such a man, or what good it is
to his fellows or the world. This man,
lying on the muddy roadside, doubtless
was convinced that this was a meritor-
ious deed, while to one whose mind is
impervious to religious humbug it
seemed an act of sheer lunacy.
The market at Kandy is square, with
a verandah running around the greater
part of it. The goods are easily access-
ible to the public, a portion being placed
on the ground in good Eastern fashion.
The stall-holders are noisy and push
trade vigorously. Even the many stall-
holders selling dark, tough-lookilng
meat with little fat, eagerly ask the
travellers to buy. Sales of meat to the
visitors are difficult, on account of
the inconvenience of carrying a sheep
or goat’s pluck in such a climate, in
conjunction with other considerations.
Ceylon is picturesque, Kandy is pretty;
Colombo is a black man’s city.
Electricity, motor cars, and Western
ideas jostle with the mat-covered
wagons drawn by diminutive bulls,
with hump necks; who are tatooed like
a Maori and look degenerate compared
with the Tyson types from a Queens-
land run.
The age of 3000 years ago rubs
shoulders with Western modernity.
The Katamaran sails beside the
liner. Ceylon is interesting to look at;
but not sufficiently fascinating for a
life’s sojourn ,to white mortals* It
was, is, and will be —Black.

PUBLIC NOTICES.
PERSONAL. —Young man, of pre-
possessing appearance, having success-
fully attended the Psychology, Econom-
ics and Astronomy Classes on this vessel,
feels that he is now competent to take
a pupil for instruction in the “Ars
Amoris.” For terms and particulars
apply “Ovid” at the office of this paper.
SISTER, unattached, required two
companions for alternate evenings on
the Boat Decks. Would be satisfied to
commence in either case with the com-
mon-places of the Poop and ascend
gradually to the rarer circles of the
Upper Boat Deck. Address Red
Cape (who, eschewing the nautical vul-
garism, gives her address as “For-
ward”).
WANTED. A Complete Set of
Manners for Table No. Umpteen, Ser-
geants’ Mess. If slightly soiled or
out-of-date they will still be acceptable,
as they could not possibly be worse than
the ones in present use.


ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“Digger.” —You ask us “Who the
Ship’s Sergt.-Major’s particular fancy
is?” This is a personal matter in which
we do not care to enter. All we know
is that we have seen Alex-and-’er sit-
ting on the deck very often.
“Old King Cole.”—To remove sun-
burn expeditiously—from someone else
—use bath brick and turpentine, and
rub well. You should then remove
yourself—also expeditiously.
“O.P.” — No; it is not necessary to
use opera-glasses at a less distance than
five yards; although it is sometimes
done. Under certain circumstances —
such as at revues with an extreme ten-
dency to ballets —it might be a good
plan, even when sitting in the front
row, to use them by looking through
the wrong end. We cannot be sure on
this point as, personally, we have never
adopted it. Your further question as
to the advisability of using field-glasses,
if you should not be able to afford the
opera variety, is answered in the nega-
tive.
“Re-Peater.” —We believe Abernethy’s
are very sustaining and fattening—but
you can’t expect all the youngsters to
be Peters. It is only given to a few
chosen ones of this earth to attain to
that proud pre-eminence.
“Franchise.” —The novels of Paul de
Kock are not considered suitable, as
yet, for the French class—even the most
advanced one. If the weather should
get cooler a move in this direction
might be deemed advisable.
“Sport.” —Yes, the Davis Cup is a
weight-for-age event. It is run in three
heats and a final, and the man who
kicks more than four goals loses his
wicket. No niblicks are allowed in
the hazards; the winner takes the pool
and the third man is always disqualified
for “holding.” There are other regu-
lations; but these will do to go on with.
“Bather.” —By R.O. tooty-two, para.
9991, not more than 24 persons shall
use the Swimming Bath at one time,
unless with the consent in writing of
the undermost layer of bathers. Also,
no long-distance racing nor diving for
pennies is permitted.
“Pegasus.” —You tell us that your
contribution is “entirely original.” My
dear sir, we accept your assurance on
the point with alacrity. It bears every
impress of the fact.
“Nap.” —We print your limerick
gladly. You deserve to be paid for it,
and we hope you will be —by its sub-
ject, to whose tender mercies we here-
by most heartily commend you:—
“A sweet-voiced young cherub named
Brown,
Is good at the “Anchor and Crown”;
But most happy he feels,
When he’s having his meals
And has to pass plates up and down!”
(N.B. —We confess we do not quite
understand the allusion in the second
line. If some Village Inn is referred
to, we desire to make it clear that no
attempt to advertise any particular
placg, or brand, will be permitted in
this column.
“Eno.” —lt is a mistake to say that
Fruit Salt should be worked into a
stiff paste and nibbled between meals.
We never go beyond a saturated solu-
tion, ourselves; but others—who are of
a more, dry and sardonic nature— prefer
it neat.
“Davis Cup.” —You ask if Lewis Car-
roll’s invitation to “Come to my arms,
My Beamish Boy,” has any reference
to a member of the British Isles Chal-
lenge Team. Certainly it has—equally
with “Lowe —here the gentle lark.”
But “Lo!—the poor Indian” is of quite
another family.
“Sweet Singer of Israel.” —Your noble
effort to push “Lindo, through the
cabin window” fails on account of its
“terminological inexactitude.” They
call ’em “port-holes” on board ship
and not even you can rhyme “Lindo”
with “port-hole” without tearing some-
thing pretty badly. Besides, we don’t
want Lindo pushed overboard. We’d
have to waste a lot of good time pick-
ing him up—so ridiculously strict are
the authorities on small matters of that
kind.
“S.” —We understand that the volun-
tary services of a manicurist are ob-
tainable on this ship, if application be
made in the proper quarter. But this
should be done at the “toot,” as al-
ready the stroud—we mean crowd—-of
clients is very large. D’ye get me,
Steve?
“No. 2 Officers.” —We are glad to
know that the new anchor-man of your
team has proved such a “general” suc-
cess. You certainly obtained some
“pull” when you managed to get him in.
“Tote.” —The conveniences of this
popular pastime are available some-
where aft —but we do not care to give
the locality with too much definiteness.
It might be regarded as a “place,”
within the meaning of the Act-—and
then there’d be trouble!
“Aqua.” —We are sorry for your un-
fortunate position; but are afraid that
we can do nothing for you. You must
confine yourself to your regulation
supply. We know that this is a “Dry
Ship” and that, under the circum-
stances, and to a man of your ability
in that line, ten gallons per diem is
hardly a fair thirst-quencher—but if
you must drink it, why not use it for
bathing purposes first? It is impos-
sible to reverse the order of that pro-
cedure.
“Obstacle.” —We print your verses—
not because we think that they are
worthy of it; but so that you can see
what they really do look like in print,
and, we trust, be properly ashamed of
them: —-
He’s in the race;
He makes the pace;
He has no time to tarry.
The race is won;
We hear: “Well done,
There’s none can hurry Harry!”
But when he’s not
The first place got,
Despite his desperate scurry—
Ah, then, we hear
The words: “Oh, dear!
Why doesn’t Harry hurry?”
“Jock.” —We do not know what the
rates of pay for fully qualified swabbers
are, but we understand that the course
of instruction is both lengthy and ex-
pensive. The Bos’n informs us that he
is prepared to receive articled pupils,
but he requires a stiff premium and is,
we are informed, somewhat celebrated
for the thoroughness with which he
drives home his instruction. We would
recommend direct application to him.
“Red Cape.” —Re camisole. We
strongly advise that this garment
should be cut on the bias with as little
frill as possible; but the decolletage
should be carefully sewn on. Herring-
bone work or applique are both fash-
ionable just now; but for a really chic
effect you might hem the skirt with a
few ehoux of cretonne. The most
important thing to remember, how-
ever, is the elastic. This must be put
on the right end or trouble is bound to
follow. Finally, “goffer” the whole
thing—any “goffer” will do, so long as
he is a plus man and good on the drive
—garnish with cloves and serve with a
hot iron. For any further particulars
or explanation of terms used apply to
the War Artists’ cabin.
“A.N.Q.” —No—all the Canal Com-
pany’s employees left us at Suez. The
gentleman in question is only sunburned.
“Sketch.”— You ask us to have a
sketch of you inserted in our So-
ciety columns and state as an induce-
ment that you have “a prominent chin
and nose.” We know another feature
of your face which is prominent and
which you do not mention—your cheek!
However, our cartoonist is a “good
child” and if you can induce him to
oblige you with a sitting we will only
be too glad to publish the result.
Whether you will then be so glad you
asked for it, is your funeral.
“Avoir.” —We do not know why you
apply to us on a question of French
Grammar, when you have so many ex-
pert tutors available; but since you
have done so, we will certainly help
you. The “Interrogative ‘Aperatif’ ”
of the verb “to have” is mi unnatur-
ally a puzzler to you; for it is an idio-
matic phrase which would be a pitfall
to anybody. It is best rendered by the
words which we hope will become
more familiar to you after you have left
this ship than they can possibly be upon
it—“What’s Yours?”
“Rob.” —The brand of cigar you men-
tion has not often been smoked by us;
but we had the good fortune to be pre-
sented with one the other day by a
connoisseur, and we can most certainly
recommend it, especially “on a terrace
verandah, with an agreeable com-
panion.” With regard to your other
question re pyjamas we believe that
the latest “dart” is to have one
leg and one arm sewn—preferably by
a sister (someone else’s, of course—at
the end furthest from the main portion
of the garment. The only objection
to this fashion is that the sewing is apt
to cause trouble to the uninitiated, who
are extremely likely to rip the work in
their hurry to get into bed.
