LAND (TENURE) REFORM LEAGUE.
TRACT 3STo. 5.
PRINCIPLES.
1. ?? The revolutions that impend over society are not now from ambition and
rapacity, from impatience of one or another form of government; hut from new
modes of thinking, which shall recompense society after a new order, which shall
animate labour by lore and science, which shall destroy the value of many kinds of
property, and replace all property withinthe dominion ofreasonand equity .?? Emerson.
2. ?? The essential qorinciple of property being to assure to all persons what they
have produced by their labour, and accumulated by their abstinence, the principle
cannot apply to what is not the produce of labour, the raw material of the earth." ?
Mill.
B. ?The land is the inalienable property of the inhabitants of every country
throughout all generations.
4. ??No consideration ought to be paramount to that of making the land available
in the highest degree for the production offood and the employment of industry."
5. ? Selling the fee-simple of the land is a political misdemeanour, as opposed to
justice and reason, as it has proved injurious to the material and moral interests of
society.
6. ? The alienation of the state lands gives to the landowner the whole improvement
in value from the increase of population and national works. The State Landlord,
preserves all for the benefit of the people.
7. ? Land, is the state capital, the primal source of food and wealth, and in parting
with it our legislators have not only most iniquitously limited, the field of profitable
employment, but have burdened the people needlessly? with double taxation?the one, a
highly unjust system to provide a general revenue; the other, a direct tax on food and
the necessaries of life, to enable landlords to live in idleness by the labour of others.
8. ? A rent on state lands, being light and for a manifest benefit, would meet all the
requirements of a just and desirable means of raising revenue. It would be easily and
cheaply collected, and would greatly reduce the expenses of Government by rendering
unnecessary some of the present costly and otherwise hurtful departments.
9. While strictly preserving the right of ownership in land for future generations,
the greatest possible facilities for actual and productive settlement may be afforded.
10. ? The advantages of almost free land, and the total absence of taxation, would
ensure an unexampled condition of steady progress and general prosperity.
11. With an absolute freedom from taxation, and, full and unfettered scope for
industry, every inhabitant of the country would enjoy a beneficial interest from his
share in the state lands, whether occupying a portion of these or not.
12. ?? The best political economy is the care and culture of men." And such a use
of the common patrimony, the gift of God to all, would not only promote to the utmost
the material welfare of society, but would raise us mentally in the scale of nations, by
affording the most liberal culture of which each is capable; special privileges, which
should be deemed the inherent right of every member of the community.
13. ?Acting on these principles, we would not only do our duty to our own people by
conferring on them all the advantages possible with our present knowledge of political
and economic science; but would prove to the world at large what may be done for the
progress of humanity by an enlightened appreciation of the circumstances in which we
find ourselves placed.
OBJECTS.
1. ?The immediate cessation of the sale of all Crown lands.
2. ?The fee-simple of the public domain to vest in perpetuity in the state (that is,
the people in their corporate capacity).
3. ? Occupancy, with fixity of tenure, and right of transfer, subject to rental for
revenue purposes.
4. ?Land already alienated from the state to be re-purchased, by the state. No
re-sale to individuals to be permitted.
5. ?The gradual abolition of all indirect taxes whatever. The revenue of the state
to be derived solely from the rentals of the land.

? England?s great man and America?s great man? have spoken as
seers on most of the important social and political subjects bearing
on the existing, and the possible-desirable, condition of society.
Mr. Carlyle?s utterances on ? the condition of the people question,?
in reference to our immediate thesis, will, it is thought, be found
pertinent and suggestive. The ? after?ward of ?shooting Niagara?
may not be so very perplexing to earnest and skilful pilots. The
extracts of this present Tract are from ? Chartism? and ? Past and
Present,? edition 1858. The pages being given will facilitate
reference to the original, should it be felt desirable to read the
context to the extracts.
1. The condition of the great body of people in a country is the
condition of the country itself: this you would say is a truism in
all times; a truism rather pressing to get recognised as a truth
now, and be acted upon, in these times. Yet read Hansard?s
Debates, or the Morning Papers, if you have nothing to do! The
old grand question, whether A is to be in office or B, with the
innumerable subsidiary questions growing out of that, courting
paragraphs and suffrages for a blessed solution of that; Canada
question, Irish Appropriation question, West-India question,
Queen?s Bedchamber question; Game Laws, Usury Laws;
African Blacks, Hill Coolies, Smithfield cattle, and Dogcarts ?all
manner of questions and subjects, except simply this, the alpha and
omeou of all! Surely Honourable Members ought to speak of the
Condition-of-Engiaud question too. Radical Members, above all;
friends of the people; chosen with effort, by the people, to
interpret and articulate the dumb deep want of the people! To a
remote observer they seem oblivious of their duty. Are they not
there, by trade, mission, and, express appointment of themselves
and others, to speak for the good of the British Nation? * Whatso-
ever great British interest can the least speak for itself for that
beyond all they are called to speak. They are either speakers for
that great dumb toiling class which cannot speak, or they are nothing
that one can well specify. P. 5.
2. Work is the mission of man in this Earth. A day is ever
struggling forward, a day will arrive in some approximate degree,
when he who has no work to do, by whatever name he may be
named, will not find it good to show himself in our quarter of the
Solar System: but may go and look out elsewhere, If there be any
Idle Planet discoverable? ?Let the honest working man rejoice
that such law, the first of Nature, has been made good on him;
and hope that, by and by, all else will be made good. It is the
beginning of all. P. 14.
3. For, in truth, the claim of the poor labourer is something
* The emphasised portions in italics are deemed more specially applicable
to the general argument.


quite other than that ? Statute of the Forty-third of Elizabeth?
will ever fulfil for him. Not to be supported by roundsmen sys-
tems, by never so liberal parish doles, or lodged in free and easy
workhouses when distress overtakes him; not for this, however in
words he may clamour for it; not for this, but for something far
different does the heart of him struggle. It is ?for justice? that
he struggles; for ?just wages,? not in money alone ! An ever-
toiling inferior, he toould fain (though as yet lie knows it not) find
for himself a superior that shall lovingly and wisely govern: is not
that too the ?just wages? of his service done 1 ? It is for a man-
like place and relation, in this world where he sees himself a man,
that he struggles. At bottom may we not say, it is even for this,
That guidance and government, which he cannot give himself,
which in our so complex world he can no longer do without, might
be afforded him? P. 15.
4. A man willing to work, and unable to find work, is perhaps
the saddest sight that Fortune?s inequality exhibits under tliis sun.
Burns expresses feelingly what thoughts it gave him: a poor man
seeking work; seeking leave to toil that he might be fed and
sheltered! That he might but be put on a level with the four-footed
workers of the Planet which is his ! There is not a horse willing
to work but can get food and shelter in requital; a thing this two-
footed worker has to seek for, to solicit occasionally in vain. He
is nobody?s two-footed worker; he is not even anybody?s slave.
And yet he is a iwo-footed worker; it is currently reported there is
an immortal soul in him, sent down out of heaven into the earth;
and one beholds him seeking for this ! Nay, what will a wise
Legislature say, if it turn out that he cannot find it; that the
answer to their postulate proposition is not affirmative but nega-
tive ? There is one fact which Statistic Science has communicated,
and a most astonishing one; the inference from which is pregnant
as to this matter. Ireland has near seven millions of working
people, the third unit of whom, it appears by Statistic Science, has
not for thirty weeks each year as many third-rate potatoes as will
suffice him. It is a fact perhaps the most eloquent that was ever
written down in any language, at any date of the world?s history.
Was change and reformation needed in Ireland ? Has Ireland
been governed and guided in a ? wise and loving? manner ? A
government and guidance of white European men which has issued
in perennial hunger of potatoes to the third man extant, ought to
drop a veil over its face, and walk out of court under conduct of
proper officers; saying no word; expecting now of a surety
sentence either to change or die. All men, we must repeat, were
made by God, and have immortal souls in them. The Sanspotato is
of the selfsame stuff as the superfinest Lord Lieutenant. Not an
individual Sanspotato human scareci?ow but had a Life given him
out of Heaven, with eternities depending on it ; for once and no
second time. With immensities in him, over him, and round him ;
with feelings which a Shakespere?s speech would not utter; with
desires illimitable as the Autocrat?s of all the Bussias ! Him
various thrice-honoured persons, tilings, and institutions have long


been teaching, long been guiding, governing; and it is to perpetual
scarcity of third-rate potatoes, and to what depends thereon, that
he has been taught and guided. Figure thyself, O high-minded,
clear-headed, clean-burnished reader, clapt by enchantment into
the torn coat and waste hunger-lair of that same root-devouiing
brother man 1 ? P. 16.
5. To whatever other griefs the lower classes labour under, this
bitterest and sorest grief now superadds itself: the unendurable
conviction that they are unfairly dealt with, that theiv lot ni this
world is not founded on right , not even on necessity and might, is
neither what it should he nor what it shall be. P. 26.
6. The French Revolution is seen, or begins everywhere to be
seen, ? as the crowning phenomenon of our Modern Time;? ? the
inevitable stern end of much; the fearful, but also wonderful,
indispensable and sternly beneficent beginning of much.? He
who would understand the struggling convulsive unrest of
European society, in any and every country, at this day, may read
it in broad glaring lines there, in that the most convulsive
phenomenon of the last thousand years. P. 27.
7. An ideal of right does dwell in all men, in all arrangements,
pactions, and procedures of men; it is to this ideal of right , more
and more developing itself as it is more and more approximated to,
that human Society for ever tends and struggles. We say also that
any given thing either is unjust or else just; however obscure the
arguings and strugglings on it he, the thing in itself, there as it lies,
infallibly enough, is the one or the other. To which let us add
only this, the first, last article of faith, the alpha and omega of all
faith among men, That nothing which is unjust can hope to
continue in this world. P. 30.
8. Another thing, which the British reader often reads and
hears, in this time, is worth his meditating for a moment: That
Society ? exists for the protection of property.? To which it is
added, that the poor man also has property, namely, his ? labour,?
and the fifteen-pence or three-and-sixpence a day he can get for
that. True enough, O friends, � for protecting property most
true: and indeed if you will once sufficiently enforce that Eighth
Commandment, the whole ?rights of man? are well cared for; I
know no better definition of the rights of man. Thou shalt not
steal, thou shalt not he stolen from: what a Society were that; Plato?s
Republic, Moore?s Utopia mere emblems of it! Give every man what
is his the accurate price of what he has done and been, no man shall
any more complain, neither shall the earth suffer any more. P. 36.
9. ?To this English People in World-History, there have been,
shall I prophecy, Two grand tasks assigned? Huge-looming
through the dim tumult of the always incommensurable Present
Time,�outlines of two tasks disclose themselves : the grand Indus-
trial task of conquering some half or more of this Terraqueous
Planet for the use of man ; then secondly, the grand Constitutional
task of sharing, in some pacific endurable manner, the fruit of said
conguest, and showing all people how it might he done. These I will
call their two tasks, discernible hitherto in World-History : in


both ot these they have made respectable though unequal progress.
Steam-engines, ploughshares, pickaxes ; what is meant by conquer-
ing this Planet, they partly know. Elective franchise, ballot-box,
representative assembly; how to accomplish sharing of that
conquest, they do not so well know. Europe knows not; Europe
vehemently asks in these days, but receives no answer, no credible
answer .? P. 46.
10. England is full of wealth, of multifarious produce, supply for
human want in every kind; yet England is dying of inanition.
With unabated bounty the land of England blooms and grows;
waving with yellow harvests; thick-studded with workshops,
industrial implements, with fifteen millions of workers, understood
to be the strongest, the cunningest, and the willingest our Earth ever
had; these men are here; the work they have done, the fruit they
have realised is here, abundant, exuberant on every hand of us:
and behold, some baneful fiat as of Enchantment has gone forth,
saying, ? Touch it not, ye workers, ye master-workers, ye master-
idlers; none of you can touch it, no man of you shall be the
better for it; this is enchanted fruit!? P. 71,
11. ? Passing by the Workhouse of St. Ives in Huntingdonshire,
on a bright day last autumn,? says the picturesque Tourist, ? I saw
sitting on wooden benches, in front of their Bastille and within
their ring-wall and its railings, some half-hundred or more of these
men. Tall robust figures, young mostly or of middle age; of
honest countenance, many of them thoughtful and even intelligent-
looking men. They sat there, near by one another; but in a kind
of torpor, especially in a silence, which was very striking. In
silence: for, alas, what word was to be said 1 An earth all lying
round, crying, Come and till me, come and reap me?yet we here
sit enchanted! In the eyes and brows of these men hung the
gloomiest expression, not of anger, but of grief and shame and
manifold inarticulate distress and weariness; they returned my
glance with a glance that seemed to say, ?Do not look at us. We
sit enchanted here, we know not why. The Sun shines and the
Earth calls; and, by the governing Powers and Impotences of this
England, we are forbidden to obey.' ? P. 72.
12, This successful industry of England, with its plethoric
wealth, has as yet made nobody rich; it is an enchanted wealth,
and belongs yet to nobody. We might ask, ? Which of us has it
enriched 1? We can spend thousands where we once spent
hundreds; but can purchase nothing good with them. In Poor
and Rich, instead of noble thrift and plenty, there is idle luxury
alternating with mean scarcity and inability. We have sumptuous
garnitures for our Life, but have forgotten to live in the middle of
them. It is an enchanted wealth; no man of us can yet touch it.
The class of men who feel that they are truly better off by means
of it, let them give us their name !
Many men eat finer cookery, drink dearer liquors?with what
advantage they can report, and their Doctors can: but in the
heart of them, if we go out of the dyspeptic stomach, what increase
of blessedness is there 1 Are they better, beautifuller, stronger


braver 1 Are they even what they call ? happier ?? Do they look
with satisfaction on more things and human faces in this God s-
Earth; do more things and human faces look with satisfaction on
them 1 ? Not so. Human faces gloom discordantly, disloyally on
one another. Things, if it be not mere cotton and iron things,
are growing disobedient to man. The Master Worker is enchanted,
for the present, like his Workhouse Workman ; clamours, in vain
hitherto, for a very simple sort of ? Liberty the liberty ?to buy
where he finds it cheapest, to sell where he finds it dearest.?
With guineas jingling in every pocket, he was no whit richer;
but now, the very guineas threatening to vanish, he feels that he
is poor indeed. Poor Master I And the Master
Unworker, is not he in a still fataller situation ? Pausing amid
his game-preserves, with awful eye?as he well may ! Coercing
fifty-pound tenants; coercing, bribing, cajoling; doing what he
likes with his oiun. P. 74.
13. To whom, then, is this wealth of England wealth ? Who is it
that it blesses; makes happier, wiser, heautifuller, in any way better ?
Who has got hold of it, to make it fetch and carry for him, like a
true servant , not like a false mock-servant ; to do him any real
service whatsoever ? As yet, no one. We have more riches than any
Nation ever had before; we have less good of them than any other
nation ever had before. Our successful industry is hitherto
unsuccessful ; a strange success if we stop here! In the midst of
plethoric plenty, the people perish ; with gold walls, and full barns ,
no man feels himself safe or satisfied. P. To.
14. Acts of Parliament are venerable; but if they correspond
not with the writing on the ? Adamant Tablet,? what are they 1
Properly their one element of venerableness, of strength or great-
ness, is, that they at all times correspond therewith as near as by
human possibility they can. They are cherishing destruction in
their bosom every hour that they continue otherwise. P. 77.
15. Alas, how many causes that can plead well for themselves in
the courts of Westminister; and yet in the general Court of the Uni-
verse and free Soul of Man have no word to utter. Honourable
Gentlemen may find this worth considering, in times like ours.
And truly, the din of triumphant Law-logic, and all shaking of
horse-hair wigs and learned-sergeant gowns having comfortably
ended, we shall do well to ask ourselves withal, What says that
high and highest court to the verdict ? For it is the court of courts,
that same; where the universal soul op I act and very Truth sits
President: and thitherward, more and more swiftly, ivith a really
terrible increase of swiftness, all causes do in these days crowd for
revisal, for confirmation, for modification, for reversal ivith costs.
Dost thou know that court! hast thou had any law-practice there?
What, didst thou never enter; never file any petition of redress,
reclaimer, disclaimer, or demurrer, written as in thy heart?s blood,
for thy own behoof or another?s; and silently await the issue?
Thou knowest not such a court? Hast merely heard of it by faint
tradition as a thing that was or had been ? Of thee, I think, v e
shall get little benefit. P. 78.


16. Oceans of horse-hair, continents of parchment, and learned
sergeant eloquence, were it continued till the learned tongue wore
itself small in the indefatigable learned mouth, cannot make unjust
just. The grand question still remains, li as the judgment just ?
If unjust, it will not and cannot get harbour for itself, or continue to
have footing in this Universe, which was made by other than One unjust.
Enforce it by never such staining, three readings, royal assents; bloiv
it to the four winds with all manner of quilted trumpeters and pur-
suivants, in the rear of them never so many gibbets and hangmen, it
ivill not stand, it cannot stand. From all souls of men, from all
ends of Nature, from the throne of God above, there are voices bidding
it: Away, away ! Does it take no warning; does it stand, strong
in its three readings, in its gibbets and artillery-parks? The
more woe is to it, the frightfuller woe. It will continue standing
for its day, for its year, for its century, doing evil all tire while;
but it has one enemy who is Almighty: dissolution, explosion, and
the everlasting laws of Nature incessantly advance towards it;
and the deeper its rooting, more obstinate its continuing, the deeper
also and huger ivill its ruin and overturn he. P. 78.
17. As many men as there are in a Nation who can withal see
Heaven?s invisible Justice, and know it to be on Earth also
omnipotent, so many men are there who-stand between a nation
and perdition. So many, and no more. P. 81.
18. And truly this first practical form of the Sphinx-question,
inarticulately and so audibly put there, is one of the most impres-
sive ever asked in the world. ? Behold us here, so many thou-
sands, millions, and increasing at the rate of fifty every hour.
We are right willing and able to work ; and on the Planet Earth
is plenty of work and wages for a million times as many. We
ask, if you mean to lead us towards work ; to try to lead us?by
ways new, never yet heard of till this new unheard-of Time ? Or
if you declare that you cannot lead us 1 And expect that we arc
to remain quietly unled, and in a composed manner perish oi
starvation '? What is it you expect of us ? What is it you mean
to do with us i? This question, I say, has been put in the hearing
of all Britain; and will be again put, and ever again, till some
answer he given it. P. 84.
19. The Progress of Human Society consists even in this same,
The better and better apportioning of wages to work. P. 86,
20. The world, with its wealth of nations, supply-and-demand
and such like, has of late days been terribly inattentive to that
question of work and wages. .We will not say, the poor world
has retrograded even here: we will say rather, the world has been
rushing on with such fiery animation to get work and ever more work
done, it has had no time to think of dividing the wages; and has
merely left them to be scrambled for by the Law of the Stronger,
law of Supply-and-demand, law of Laissez-faire, and other idle
Laws and Un-laws ?saying, in its dire haste to get the work done,
?That is well enough!?
And now the world will have to pause a little, and take up that
other side of the problem, and in right earnest strive for some solution


of that. For it has become pressing. What is the use 0/ your spun
shirts? They hang there by the million unsaleable; and here, by the
million, are diligent bare backs that can get no hold of them. Shirts
are useful for covering human backs; useless otherwise, an unbear-
able mockery otherwise. You have fallen terribly behind with that
side of the problem ! Manchester Insurrections, French Eevolu-
tions, and thousandfold phenomena great and small, announce
loudly that you must bring it fonvard a little again. Never till
now, in the history of an Earth which to this hour nowhere
refuses to grow corn if you will plough it, to yield shirts if you
will spin and weave in it, did the mere manual two-handed
worker (however it might fare with other workers) cry in vain
for such ? wages? as he means by ? fair wages,? namely food and
warmth! The Godlike could not and cannot be paid; but the
Earthly always could. Gurth, a mere swineherd, born thrall of
Cedric the Saxon, tended pigs in the wood, and did get some
parings of the pork. Why, the four-footed worker has already got
all that this two-handed one is clamouring for ! How often must
I remind you 1 There is not a horse in England, able and willing
to work, but has due food and lodging; and goes about sleek-
coated, satisfied in heart ! And you say, ?It is impossible.?
Brothers, I answer, if for you it be impossible, what is to become
of you 1 It is impossible for us to believe it to be impossible. The
human brain, looking at these sleek English horses, refuses to
believe in such impossibility for Englishmen. Do you depart
quickly 1 clear the way soon, lest worse befal. We for our share
DO PURPOSE, WITH FULL VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY, WITH
TOTAL DISBELIEF IN THE IMPOSSIBILITY, TO ENDEAVOUR WHILE
LIFE IS IN US, AND TO DIE ENDEAVOURING, WE AND OUR SONS,
TILL WE ATTAIN IT, OR HAVE ALL DIED AND ENDED. P. 87.
21. O my Conservative friends, who still specially name and
struggle to approve yourselves ?Conservative,? would to Heaven
I could persuade you of this world-old fact, than which Fate is not
surer, that truth and justice alone are capable of being ? con-
served? and preserved ! The thing which is unjust, which is not
according to God's law, will you in a God's universe try to conserve
that ? It is so old, say you ? Yes, and the hotter haste ought you,
of all others, to be in to let it groiv no older ! If but the faintest
whisper in your hearts intimate to you that it is not fair ? hasten, for
the sake of Conservatism itself, to probe it rigorously , to cast it forth
at once and for ever if guilty. How will or can you preserve it, the
thing that is not fair ? ? Impossibility" a thousandfold is marked on
that. And ye call yourselves Conservatives, Aristocracies:?
ought not honour and nobleness of mind, if they had departed
from all the earth elsewhere, to find their last refuge with you 1
Ye unfortunate ! P. 199.
22. Giant Labour, truest emblem there is of God the World-
Worker, Demiurgus, and Eternal Maker; noble Labour, which
is yet to be the King of this earth, and sit on the highest throne
?staggering hitherto like a blind irrational giant, hardly allowed
to have his common place on the street-pavements; idle Dilettant-


ism, Dead-Sea Apism crying out, ? Down with him, he is
dangerous !? P. 203.
Labour must become a seeing rational giant, with a sold in the
body of him, and take his place on the throne of things?leaving
his Mammonism, and several other adjuncts, on the lower steps of
said throne.
23. But what will reflective readers say of a governing class,
such as ours, addressing its Workers with an indictment of
? Over-production !? Over-production : runs it not so 1 ?Ye
miscellaneous, ignoble manufacturing individuals, ye have pro-
duced too much ! We accuse you of making above two hundred
thousand shirts for the bare backs of mankind. Your trousers
too, which you have made, of fustian, of cassimere, of Scotch-plaid,
of jane, nankeen, and woollen broadcloth, are they not manifold 1
Of hats for the human head, of shoes for the human foot, of stools
to sit on, spoons to eat with?nay, what say we hats or shoes 1
You produce gold watches, jewelleries, silver forks and epeignes,
commodes, cheflbniers, stuffed sofas?Heavens, the Commercial
Bazaar and multitudinous Howel-and-Jameses, cannot contain
you. You have produced, produced?he that seeks your indict-
ment, let him look around. Millions of shirts, and empty pairs of
breeches, hang there in judgment against you. We accuse you of
over-producing : you are criminally guilty of producing shirts,
breeches, hats, shoes, and commodities, in a frightful over-abun-
dance. And now there is a glut, and your operatives cannot
be fed /?
Never, surely, against an earnest Working Mammonism was there
brought, by game-preserving aristocratic Dilettantism, a stranger
accusation since this ivorld began. My lords and gentlemen?why,
it was you that were appointed, by the fact and by the theory of
your position on the earth, to ? make and administer laws??that
is to say, in a world such as ours, to guard against ?gluts;?
against honest operatives, who had done their work, remaining unfed!
I say, you were appointed to preside over the distribution and
apportionment of the wages of work done; and to see well that
there went no labourer without his hire, were it of money-coins,
were it of hemp gallows-ropes: that function was yours, and from
immemorial time has been; yours, and as yet no other?s. These
poor shirt-spinners have forgotten much, which by the virtual
unwritten law of their position they should have remembered : but
by any written recognised law of their position, what have they
forgotten 1 ? They were set to make shirts. The community with
all its voices commanded them, saying, ? Make shirts ????and
there the shirts are ! Too many shirts ! Well, that is a novelty,
in this intemperate Earth, with its nine hundred millions of bare
backs ! But the community commanded you, saying, ? See that
the shirts are well apportioned, that our Human Laws be emblem
of God?s Laws??and where is the apportionment? Two million
shirtless or ill-shirted workers sit enchanted in Workhouse
Bastilles, five million more (according to some) in LTgolino
Hunger-cellars ; and for remedy, you say?what say you I ??


? Raise our rents !? I have hot in my time heard any stranger
speech, not even on the shores of the Dead Sea. You continue
addressing those poor shirt-spinners and over-producers, in really a
too triumphant manner:
? Will you bandy accusations, will you accuse us of over-pro-
duction] We take the Heavens and the earth to witness that
we have produced nothing at all. Not from us proceeds this
frightful overplus of shirts. In the wide domains of created
nature circulates no shirt or thing of our producing. Certain fox-
brushes nailed upon our stable-door, the fruit of fair audacity at
Melton Mowbray; these we have produced, and they are openly
nailed up there. He that accuses us of producing, let him show
himself, let him name what and when. We are innocent of pro-
ducing ; ye ungrateful! what mountains of things have we not, on
the contrary, had to ?consume,? and make away with! Moun-
tains of those your heaped manufactures, wheresoever edible or
wearable, have they not disappeared before us, as if we had the
talent of ostriches, of cormorants, and a kind of divine faculty to
eat] Ye ungrateful!?and did you not grow under the shadow of
our wings'] Are not your filthy mills built on these fields of ours;
on this soil of England ivhich belongs to ?whom think you] And
we shall not offer you our own wheat at the price that pleases us,
but that partly pleases you] A precious notion! What would
become of you, if we chose, at any time, to decide on growing no
more wheat]?
Yes, truly, here is the ultimate rock-basis of all Corn-Laws;
whereon, at the bottom of much aiguing, they rest, as securely as
they can: What ivould become of you, if we decided, some day, on
growing no more wheat at alii If ice chose to grow only partridges
henceforth, and a modicum of wheat for our oivn uses 1 Cannot we
do what we like with our own 1 Pp. 203-5.
24. Men talk of ? selling? land. Land, it is true, like Epic
Poems and even higher things, in such a trading world has to be
presented in the market for what it will bring, and as we say be
? sold ;? but the notion of ? selling,? for certain bits of metal, the
Iliad of Homer, how much more the land of the World-Creator,
is a ridiculous impossibility ! We buy what is saleable of it; no-
thing more was ever buyable. Who can, or could, sell it to us ]
Properly speaking, the land, belongs to these two: To the Almighty
God ; and to all His children of men that have ever worked well on
it, or that shall ever work well on it. No generation of men can or
could, with never such solemnity and effort, sell land on any other
principle: it is not the property of any generation, we say, but that of
all the past generations that have worked, on it, and, of all the future
ones that shall work on it. P. 206.
25. The soil of all countries belongs evermore, in a very considerable
degree, to the Almighty Maker ! The last stroke of labour bestowed
on it is not the making of its value, but only the increasing there-
of. It is very strange, the degree to which these truisms are for-
gotten in our days; how, in the ever-whirling chaos of Formulas,
we have quietly lost sight of Fact, which it is so perilous not to


keep for ever in sight. Fact, if we do not see it, will make us
feel it by-and-by ! From much loud controversy and Corn-law
debating there rises, loud though inarticulate, once more in these
years, this very question among others, who made the land ot
England 1 Who made it, this respectable English land, wheat-
growing, metalliferous, carboniferous, which will let readily hand
over head for seventy millions or upwards, as it here lies: who did
make it 1 ?We!? answer the much -consuming Aristocracy;
? We !? as they ride in, moist with the sweat of Melton Mowbray:
? It is we that made it; or are the heirs, assigns, and representa-
tives of those who did!? My brothers, You? Everlasting honour
to you, then; and Corn-laws as many as you will, till your own
deep stomachs cry enough, or some voice of human pity for our
famine bids you hold ! Ye ai?e as gods, that can create soil. Soil-
creating gods there is no withstanding. They have the might to
sell wheat at what price they list ; and the right, to all lengths,
and famine-lengths, if they be pitiless infernal gods ! Celestial
gods, I think, would stop short of the famine-price; but no infernal
nor any kind of god can be bidden stop ! Infatuated mortals,
into what questions are you driving every thinking man in
England 1 F. 207.
26. Again and again, what shall we say of the Idle Aristocracy,
the owners of the soil of England; whose recognised function is
that of handsomely consuming the rents of England, shooting the
partridges of England, and as an agreeable amusement (if the pur-
chase-money and other conveniences serve), dilettante-ing in Parlia-
ment and Quarter-Sessions for England 1 We will say mournfully,
in the presence of Heaven and Earth, that we stand speechless
stupent, and know not what to say. That a class of men entitled
to live sumptuously on the marrow of the earth; permitted
simply, nay entreated, and as yet entreated in vain, to do nothing
at all in return, was never heretofore seen on the face of this
planet. That such a class is transitory, exceptional, and, unless
Nature?s laws fall dead, cannot continue. That it has continued
now a moderate while; has, for the last fifty years, been rapidly
attaining its state of perfection. That it will have to find its duties
and do them; or else that it must and will cease to be seen on the
face of this Planet, which is a working one, not an idle one. P. 209.
27. What is the meaning of nobleness, if this be ? noble T In
a valiant suffering for others, not in a slothful making others suffer
for us, did nobleness ever lie. The chief of men is he who stands
in the van of men; fronting the peril which frightens back all
others; which, if it be not vanquished, will devour the others.
Every noble crown is, and on earth will for ever be, a crown of
thorns. The Pagan Hercules, why was he accounted a hero 1
Because he had slain Nemean Lions, cleansed Augean Stables,
undergone Twelve Labours only not too heavy for a god. In
modern, as in ancient and all societies, the Aristocracy, they that
assume the functions of an Aristocracy, doing them or not, have
taken the post of honour; which is the post of difficulty, the post
of danger?of death, if the difficulty be not overcome. II faut


payer de sa vie. Why was our life given us, if not that we should
manfully give it? P. 210.
28. Cotton cloth is already two-pence a yard or lower; and yet
bare backs were never more numerous among us. Let inventive
men cease to spend their existence incessantly contriving how
cotton can be made cheaper; and try to invent, a little, how cotton
at its present cheapness could be somewhat just Her divided among us.
Let inventive men consider, Whether the secret of this Universe,
and of man?s life there, does, after all, as we rashly fancy it,
consist in making money? There is one God, just, supreme,
almighty: but is Mammon the name of him?? With a hell which
means ? Failing to make money,? I do not think there is any
heaven possible that would suit one well; nor so much as an eartli
that can be habitable long! In bi'ief, all this Mammon-Gospel, of
Supply-and-demand, Competition, Laissez-faire, and Devil take the
hindmost, begins to be one of the shabbiest gospels ever preached;
or altogether the shabbiest! P. 213.
29. Plugson, who has indomitably spun cotton merely to gain
thousands of pounds, I have to call as yet a Buccanier and Choctaw:
till there come something better, still more indomitable from him.
His hundred thousand pound-notes, if there be nothing other, are
to me but as the hundred scalps in a Choctaw wigwam. The blind
Plugson: he was a captain of industry, born member of the
Ultimate genuine Aristocracy of this Universe, could he have
known it! These thousand men that span and toiled round him,
they were a regiment whom he had enlisted, man by man; to
make war on a very genuine enemy: Bareness of back, and dis-
obedient cotton-fibre, which will not, unless forced to it, consent
to cover bare backs. Here is a most genuine enemy; over whom
all creatures will wish him victory. He enlisted his thousand
men; said to them, ?Come, brothers, let us have a dash at cotton!?
They follow with cheerful shout; they gain such a victory over
cotton as the earth has to admire and clap hands at: but, alas, it
is yet only of the Buccanier or Choctaw sort, as good as no victory!
Foolish Plugson of St. Dolly Undershot: does he hope to become
illustrious by hanging up the scalps in his wigwam, the hundred
thousands at his bankei??s, and saying, ? Behold my scalps ??
Why, Plugson, even thy own host is all in mxxtiny: Cotton is
conquered: but the ? bare backs? are worse covered than ever !
Indomitable Plugson, thou must cease to be a Choctaw; thou and
others, thou thyself, if no other. P. 220.
30. This is not a man I would kill and strangle by Coin-Laws;
even if I could! Ho, I would fling my Corn-Laws and Shotbelts
to the devil; and try to help this man. I woxild teach him, by
noble precept and law-precept, by noble example most of all, that
Mammonism was not the essence of his or of my station in God?s
Universe; but the adscititious excrescence of it; the gross, tex--
rene, godless embodiment of it; which would have to become,
more or less, a godlike one. By noble real legislation, by true
noble's-ivork, by unwearied, valiant, and ivere it wageless effort, in
my Parliament and in my parish I would aid, constrain, encourage


him to effect more or less this blessed change. I should know that it
would have to he effected; that unless it were in some measure effected,
he and 1 and all of us, / first and soonest of all, were doomed to 'per-
dition ! Effected it will be ; unless it were a demon that made this
Universe; which I, for my own part, do at no moment, under no
form, in the least believe.
May it please your Serene Highnesses, your Majesties, Lord-
ships and Law-wardships, the proper Epic of this world is not
now ? Arms and the Man;? how much less, ? Shirt-frills and the
Man no, it is now, ? Tools and the Man that, henceforth to all
time, is notv our Epic ?and you, first of all others, I think, were
wise to take note of that ! P. 232.
31. ? Labour? will verily need to be somewhat ? organised,? as
thev say?God knows with what difficulty. Man ivill actually
need to have his debts and earnings a little better paid by man ;
which, let Parliaments speak of them or be silent of them, are eternally
his due from man, and cannot, without penalty, and at length not
without death-penalty, be withheld. How much ought to cease among
us straightway ; how much ought to begin straightway, while the hours
yet are I P. 233.
32. And yet I will venture to believe that in no time, since
the beginnings of society, was the lot of thos f e same dumb millions
of toilers so entirely unbearable as it is even in the days now
passing over us. It is not to die, or even to die of hunger, that
makes a man wretched ; many men have died ; all men must
die?the last exit of us all is in a fire-chariot of pain. But it is
to live miserable, we know not why; to work sore and yet gain
nothing; to be heart-worn, weary, yet isolated, unrelated, girt-in
with a cold universal Laissez-faire : it is to die slowly all our life
long, imprisoned in a deaf, dead, infinite injustice, as in the
accursed iron belly of a Phalaris? Bull ! This is and remains
for ever intolerable to all men whom God has made. Do we
wonder at French Revolutions, Chartisms, Revolts of Three Days 1
The times, if we will consider them, are really unexampled. P. 234.
33. We raise fifty-two millions, from the general mass of us, to
get our governing done or, alas! to get ourselves persuaded that
it is done : and the ? peculiar burden of the land? is to pay, not
all this, but to pay, as I learn, one twenty-fourth part of all this.
Our first Chartist Parliament, or Oliver Redivivus, you would say,
will know where to lay the new taxes of England ! ?Or, alas, taxes ?
If we made the holders of the land pay every shilling still of the
expense of governing the land, what-were all that ? P. 262.
Yea, friend Teufelsdroch, and we diffidently aspiring towards
? Oliver Redivivus,? do manfully, and we hope intelligently
believe, these our present efforts to be, so far as the functions of
legislation can legitimately go, the only practical solution of that
second problem, the fair division of the wages.
34. One wide and widest ? outline? ought really in all ways to
be becoming clear to us; this namely: That a ? Splendour of God,?
in one form or other, will have to unfold itself from the heart of
these our Industrial Ages too; or they will never get themselves


? organised but continue chaotic, distressed, distracted ever-
more, and have to perish in frantic suicidal dissolution. A
second ? outline? or prophecy, narrower, but also wide enough,
seems not less certain: That there will be a king in Israel; a
system of Order and Government; and every man shall, in some
measure, see himself constrained to do that which is right in the
king's eyes. This too we may call a sure element of the future; for
this too is of the Eternal ; this too is of the Present, though hidden
from most; and without it no fibre of the Past ever was. An
actual new sovereignty, Industrial Aristocracy, real not imagin-
ary aristocracy, is indispensable and indubitable for its. P. 265.
35. To be a noble master, among noble workers, will again be
the first ambition with some few ; to be a rich master only the
second. How the inventive genius of England, with the whirr of
its bobbins and billyrollers shoved somewhat into the backgrounds
of the brain, will contrive and devise, not cheaper produce exclu-
sively, but fairer distribution of the 'produce at its present cheapness !
By degrees we shall again have a society with something of heroism in
it, something of Heaven's blessing on it; we shall again have, as my
German friend asserts, ? instead of Mammon-Feudalism with unsold
cotton-shirts and preservation of the game, noble just industrialism
and government by the wisest!" P. 281.
36. Ho working world, any more than a fighting world, can be
led on without a noble chivalry of work, and laws and fixed rules
which follow out of that?far nobler than any chivalry of fighting
was. As an anarchic multitude on mere Supply-and-demand, it is
becoming inevitable that we dwindle in horrid suicidal convul-
sion, and self-abrasion, frightful to the imagination, into Choctaw
workers. With wigwams and scalps?with palaces and thousand-
pound bills; with savagery, depopulation, chaotic desolation !
Good heavens, will not one French Revolution and Reign of
Terror suffice us, but must there be two 1 There will be two if
needed; there will be twenty if needed; there will be precisely
as many as are needed. The laws of nature will have themselves
fulfilled. That is a thing certain to me. P. 283.
37. Look around you. Your world-hosts are all in mutiny, in
confusion, destitution; on the eve of fiery wreck and madness !
They will not march farther for you, on the sixpence-a-day and
Supply-and-demand principle : they will not; nor ought they, nor
can they. Ye shall reduce them to order; begin reducing them.
To order, to just subordination; noble loyalty in return for noble
guidance. Their souls are driven nigh mad; let yours be sane
and ever saner. Not as a bewildered bewildering mob ; but as a
firm regimented mass, with real captains over them, will these
men march any more. All human interests, combined human
endeavours, and social growths in this world, have, at a certain
stage of their development, required organising : and work, the
grandest of human interests, does now require it.
God knows, the task will be hard: but no noble task was ever easy.
This task will wear away your lives, and the lives of your sons and
grandsons: but for what purpose, if tasks like this,


were lives given to men 1 Ye shall cease to count your thou-
sand-pound scalps, the noble of you shall cease ! Nay, the very
scalps, as I say, will not long be left if you count only these. Ye
shall cease wholly to be barbarous, vulturous Choctaws, and
become noble European nineteenth-century men. Ye shall know
that Mammon, in never such gigs and flunkey ? respectabilities,?
is not the alone God; that of himself he is but a Devil, and even
a Brute-God. P. 284.
38. On the present scheme and principle, Work cannot con-
tinue. Trades? Strikes, Trades? Unions, Chartisms; mutiny,
squalor, rage, and desperate revolt, growing ever more desperate,
will go on their way. As dark misery settles down on us, and
our refuges of lies fall in pieces one after one, the hearts of men,
now at last serious, will turn to refuges of truth. The eternal
stars shine out again, so soon as it is dark enough.
Begirt with desperate Trades? Unionism and Anai?chic Mutiny,
many an Industrial Law-ward, by-and-by, who has neglected to
make laws and keep them, will be heard saying to himself: ? Why
have I realised five hundred thousand pounds ] I rose early and
sat late, I toiled and moiled, and in the sweat of my brow and of
my soul I strove to gain this money, that I might become con-
spicuous, and have some honour among my fellow-creatures. I
wanted them to honour me, to love me. The money is here,
earned with my best life-blood; but the honour ? lam encircled
with squalor, with hunger, rage, and sooty desperation. Not
honoured, hardly even envied; only fools and the flunkey-species
so much as envy me. lam conspicuous, as a mark for curses and
brickbats. What good is it I My five hundred scalps hang here
in my wigwam: would to Heaven I had sought something else
than the scalps ! would to Heaven I had been a Christian Fighter,
not a Choctaw one ! To have ruled and fought not in a Mam-
monish but in a Godlike spirit; to have had the hearts of the
people bless me as a true ruler and captain of my people; to have
felt my own heart bless me, and that God above instead of Mammon
below was blessing me, this had been something. Out of my sight,
ye beggarly five hundred scalps of banker?s thousands: I will try
for something other, or account my life a tragical futility ! P- 299.
39. Some ? Chivalry of Labour,? some noble humanity and
practical divineness of labour, will yet be realised on this earth.
Or why willl why do we pray to heaven, without setting our own
shoulder to the wheel 1 The present, if it will have the future
accomplish, shall itself commence. Thou who propheciest, who
believest, begin thou to fulfil. Here or nowhere, now equally
as at any time! That outcast help-needing thing or person,
trampled down under vulgar feet or hoofs, no help ? possible? for
it, no prize offered for the saving of it? canst not thou save it, then,
without prize ? Put forth thy hand, in God's name / know that
? impossible," where truth and mercy and the everlasting voice oj
nature order, has no place in the brave man's dictionary. That
when all men have said ? Impossible,? and tumbled noisily else-
whither, and thou alone art left, then first thy time and possibility


have come. It is for thee now; do thou that, and ask no mail's
counsel , but thy own only and God's , P. 301.
40. But it is to yon, ye workers, who do already work, and are
as grown men, noble and honoui?able in a sort, that the whole
world calls for new wox'k and nobleness. Subdue mutiny, discord,
widespread despair, by manfulness, justice, mercy, and wisdom.
Chaos is dark, deep as hell; let light be, and there is instead, a green
flowery world. 0, it is great, and there is no other greatness. To
make some nook of God's creation a little fruitfuller, better, more
worthy of God ; to make some human hearts a little wiser, manfuller,
happier?more blessed, less accursed ! It is work for a God. Sooty
hell of mutiny and savagery and despair can, by man?s energy, be
made a kind of heaven; cleared of its soot, of its mutiny, of its
need to mutiny; the everlasting arch of heaven?s azure over-
spanning it too, and its cunning mechanisms and tall chimney-
steeples, as a bii?th of heaven ; God and all men looking on it well
pleased. P. 302.
