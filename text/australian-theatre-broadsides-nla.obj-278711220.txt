LAST 4 NIGHTS of the OPERA SEASON
The Farewell Performances of the
ROYAL COMIC OPERA CO.
Will be devoted to a Most Interesting Revival (for the First Time in Eight
Years) of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Charming Fairy Opera,
IOiANIHE,
Which will be presented with an almost Entirely New Cast.
In all the extensive repertoire of the Royal Comic Opera Company,
probably no work was received with more absolute pleasure than
«< lOL ANTHE. ” The Directors have for some years past received
a great number of applications from their patrons for a re-pro-
duction of Gilbert and Sullivan’s quaint and delightful conceit.
The personnel of the present Company being specially suited for
the purpose, they have decided to give seven representations as a
fitting termination to an Immensely Successful Season. Attention
is called to the distribution of characters.

Some of the tribes of India lave a
marriage cuslora which calls for the
presence of a cow and a calf at the
ceremony. The principals and the priest
drive a cow and calf into the water, and
there the bride and groom, as well as the
clergyman, clutch the cow’s tail, while
the officiating personage pours water upon
it from a glass vessel, and utters a
religious formula. The couple are now
united in wedlock ; and the priest, for his
part in the ceremony, claims the animals,
and also receives any sum in money which
the groom thinks is necessary to pro-
pitiate the idols.
The sale of the works of the author of
“ David Copperfield ” was last year four
times as large as it was in 1869, the year
before he died. Mr. Chapman, the head
of the firm of Chapman and Hall, says :
“ Since the ‘ Pickwick Papers ’ have been
out of copyright, no less than 11 London
publishers have brought out editions, and
in the face of tl at we have sold of
‘ Pickwick ’ alone 521,750 copies during
the last 21 years.”

The English railways were first largely
modelled upon the old stage-coach sys-
tem. The “coaches ” wore at the
ning fac-similes of the stage ones, and the
guards wore red coats, like their prede-
cessors. One line engaged a band to
play the train out of the station, and for
a time the “ fares ” were actually entered
on a way-bill.
Respect For the Law. —Mrs. M‘Bride

“ Grandpa, dear, we have come to wish
you many happy returns of the day ; and
mamma says, if you give us each half-a-

“ What is her ideal ? ” Vinnie—“ A man

Boys will be boys. A youth at Wagga Wagga
had his pocket full of gunpowder, and as he
was smoking a cigar “bumper” he saw his
mother coming, so he whipped the cigar into
his pocket. The old Hdy can’t find enough of
J ohany for the corona to earn his regular fee
on. She goes around the village now, warning
all little boys never to carry gunpowder in their
pockets, but to go regularly to Sunday School,
and never be without some of Watson’s Ginger-
bread Worm Nuts if they wish to be healthy
and happy, and not to be food for worms.

lung weakness became bronchitis
Finis Pills is, to him, a marvellous one. He
recently said to a reporter Some
time ago I sank into a low, feverish
state, perhaps the result of a neglected /
cold. I turned against my food, snd II (
could never sleep at night properly, V
though I dozed heavily in the day. I
got weaker every day and had to give up
work of any kind. I grew most aston-
ishingly thin and as pale as death. My
friends said I looked like a dead
trying to walk. At last the doctor
my lungs were affected. He said * ..ww
bronchitis, and that unless I got over my
weakness and debility, it would get
such a hold on me that I should never
. throw it off. But his medicines couldn
g*ve me the least appetite,and I continued fading away day by day. I was h
deed a hopeless case, and my chances of recovery seemed very remote. Then a
mend asked me to read an account of a cure which he pointed out to me in
ie caBe seemed even worse than mine, and yet Dr.
vv illiams’Pink Pills had saved that person’s life. I could hardly believe
it, but after satisfying myself as to the truth of th* paragraph, I sent for
? x , es the pills. As I told you before, their effect was wonderful, and
it didn t quite take the six boxes to put me on my feet again, entirely cared,
r rom the first day I started the pills I began to get better; they gave me
an appetite and enabled me to sleep, thus permitting nature a free hand to
tirow off the disease. My gratitude at my recovery is indeed great, and I
have pleasure in authorising the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. to publish my
remarks wherever they deem fit. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are truly
wonderful, and tVeyfpulled me through when I was in a very perilous state,

Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper

Thought He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe o On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way;
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.’
Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportorial description the following day
in the* chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”

When Henri Rochefort escaped from
New Caledonia the news of his lanoing at
Sydney was conveyed to Marshal
M’Mahon by D’Harcourt, who was
generally tupposed to be the real Pre-
sident of the French Republic. The
marshal, much concerned by this news,
said ; —“ This is very serious ;we must
telegraph at once to the United States
Government and see if extradition
' cannot be obtained. ’ The faithful
vicomte whispered to his master —“But,
Monsieur le Mareclal, Sydney is not in
the United States; it is in Australia.”
Whereupon the marshal, whose know-
ledge of geography had never been very
extensive, threw up his arms and
exclaimed, in admiration : “ That devil
of a Harcourt, he knows everything.” “gy
