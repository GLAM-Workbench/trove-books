? Once upon a time there lived in Bagdad Two Brothers, one of whom Was called
Cassim, and the other Ali Baba. Their father had left them moderate fortunes, which
they divided equally between them. It might be therefore, naturally conjectured that
their riches would be the same ; chance, however, ordered it otherwise.?? ?The Stoiy.

THE LEAbINQ FIRE OFFICE IN AUSTRALIA.
Commercial TUmon
Has u ranee Co., Ximiteb.
ESTABLISHED 1861.
Incorporated by Act of Parliament, 7 and 8 Vic., Cap. no.
Ibeab Ctflces:
19 & 20 CORNHILL, LONDON.
Capital Fully Subscribed
Capital Paid up
Total Invested Funds
Total Net Annual Income

�HE chief point to be considered when selecting the office with which to insure is
that of Security. The saving of a sixpence or a shilling per in your
Premium will be small satisfaction if, when a loss occurs, you find your honest
claim cut down or resisted altogether on technical grounds, as is too frequently done
by offices with small means and having no reputation to lose.
The Commercial Union is one of the Largest Offices in the world. Its
Annual Revenue considerably exceeds One Million sterling, and its Invested
Funds considerably exceed Three Millions sterling, of which nearly Half-a-
Million is invested in Australia, a sum far exceeding the entire assets of every
other local competitor. It has also acquired very valuable freeholds in Sydney and
Melbourne,
The Commercial Union?s reputation for fair and liberal dealing is so w r ell
known, that its business has increased with unparalleled rapidity,
not only in Europe and America, but also in Australia. Although the Australian
Branch has been in operation for only fourteen years, its local revenue now
exceeds that of any other office, English, Foreign, or Colonial.
The Commercial Union?s affairs in each colony of Australia are under the
control of Uocal Boards, consisting of men of the highest standing in the com-
mercial world, whose names furnish a further guarantee that its engagements will be
met promptly, honestly, and liberally.
The Commercial Union?s rates are as low as those of any other office. Every
information will be afforded to intending assurants, on application to the Resident
Manager, 413 Collins Street, Melbourne; or to the Agents in Country towns and
districts.

The* Forty *TWeves-
ACT I
SCENE I.?Th� Toadstool Swamp.
Opening Chorus.
Kindred spirits here assemble,
Making every mortal tremble?
We have power to move the world,
When our Chieftain?s flag?s unfurled.
By his side we bravely stand,
Each obeys his stern command;
Be it good, or be it ill,
We are e?er obedient still.
King Fungi. The world is full of rapine wrong and fraud,
Dishonesty walks fearlessly abroad,
For hideous sin a crazy time is this?
When man betrays his friend with Judas? kiss.
And we, in this, our dull sequested home,
Wild Cat. Amongst the mortals cannot freely roam.
Tet, trouble in the world is coming thickly ?
King. If we would help them, we must do it quickly.
So, for a time, we?ll leave our Mushroom Dell ;
On earth we?ll find much-room for doing well.
(Giant Toad enters)
Toad. Now, by the jewel of my beauteous eyfe,
Your good intentions fiercely I defy.
King. And who are you ?
Toad. I am the germ of vice.
King. I?m not surprised, you don?t look very nice.
Toad. I turn men?s hearts, and make them rob the poor,
Publish false balance-sheets, and even more !
Swindles in banks and mining, I inspire,
And fill men?s brains, at times, with murderous fire.
I keep the secret doorway, which receives
The plunder of the famous forty thieves.


King. You do? vile reptile, you may know
We?re ofE to earth, that band to overthrow ;
? We will betray the secret o� the door,
And all their plunder shall enrich the poor ;
We?ll get there first, and all your schemes non plus.
Come Mushrooms ! reptiles can?t Jcitchup to us.
Toad. You?ll get there first ? poor fools, you?ll thwart
me, eh ?
Virtue goes round, sin finds a nearer way.
(Music, Dance and exeunt .)
Scene changes.
SCENE 2.?Fairy Wood.
Ballet.
(Enter Florabella.)
Friend Gladiola of the Mushroom Dell
Has asked our aid, man?s wickedness to quell.
{Enter Fairy Policeman.)
F. P. My Queen upon our fair domain encroaches.
More trouble, for another foe approaches ?
The fearful, famous, naughty forty thieves
Disturb the silvery whisper of the leaves.
Flor. They must be banished, and by stringent measures,
Eos. They even now return with stolen treasures.
F. P. They shan?t pollute our peaceful forest glades,
And fill the woods with robberies and raids.
Inspector
F.P. Here! your Majesty awaiting orders
Flor. You must upset these serious disorders ?
These forty thieves.
F.P. I?ve got ?em on the list,
And Gladiola?s promised to assist
One Ali Baba.
Flor. What! can he frustrate them ?
F. P. With his unconscious aid I?ll obfuscate them.
The secret of their cavern he shall learn,
And so these robbers shall be robbed in turn.i
Flor. Be merciful, and do not go too far.
F.P. Be merciful!
Policemen always are,
We are the kindest lot of men alive,
On poor pay and good deeds alone we thrive.


Floe. And whilst we punish vice and actions sordid
We mustn?t leave fair virtue unrewarded.
My god-child, Morgiana, has for years
Reaped nothing for her goodness but sad tears.
Her lover, Ganem, must be helped, it?s plain ?
His labour?s capital ?but some maintain
Work without capital in � s. d.
Might just as well be left alone. I?ll see
(As soon as we have all the thieves upset)
That she and Ganem shall be happy yet.
Floe. The nations all have promised to assist
Our fairy band this forty to resist.
Music.
F.P. A martial strain! See, here the nations come,
With trumpet flourishes and beat of drum.
(Faiey Policeman announces )
{Enter Feance.)
Fe. I? m France, the soul of mirth and revelry,
Famed through the world for gallant chivalry.
{Enter Geemany.)
Gee. While other nations fall I proudly stand
United, steadfast, dear old fatherland.
(Enter Italy.)
It. Historic laurels to my land belong,
The fame of art and beauty, wine and sontr.
{Enter Austeta.)
Aus. Italy and Germany, in bond divine,
By links of brotherhood with me combine
{Enter Ameeica.)
Am. The flag of stars and stripes I love the best,
It floats out bravely o?er the distant west.
The land of progress ?no stagnation there ?
All nations come to our Chicago fair.
{Enter Afeica.)
Af. I?m coral stranded Africa, so dark,
Where Stanley, recently, had such a lark.
{Enter South Ameeica.)
S.A. I? m South America, a land of beauty rare,
Gay birds and flowers are mine beyond coirpare.
{Enter Beitannia.)
Beit. And I, the land of glorious renown,
Whose flag the nations never can pull down ;
That flag, that o?er a slave is ne?er unfurled,
Ruled by a woman, honored by the world.

(GRAND NATIONAL FEDERATION FINALE.)
SCENE 111. ?Ali Baba?s House.
(Cogia and Childeen discovered.)
Coo. I cannot keep expenses within compass,
And don?t those children just kick up a rumpus.
I cannot show a surplus ?which I feels
As keenly as my old friend Billy Shiels.
Why! every Bank I deal with?s sure to bust,
You really don?t know which is going fust,
I can?t get milk?we?ve sold our only cow?
The Stock Tax is so very heavy now.
I can?t get Tucker from the Crown Baker,
The Best I?m fit for?s Graves and undertaker.
It?s Beazley hard, a Dyer and so Young ;
Great Scott, the Duffy place is going bung !
Now then, you children, off you go to bed.
Eat Bot. Please mother, can we have a crust of bread P
Cog. You ill-bred boy to go and talk about it.
Children, in future ?
Ali. Yes.
Cog. You?ll do without it.
Eat Boy. Well, if you won?t give us what we like,
We?ll form a union and go out on strike. *
Cog. You?ll strike, eh ! and what shall Ibe doing ?
Come, off you go ?leok here, my temper?s brewing.
Where is that slipper?
I?ll take you down a peg.
You?ll find the slipper?s on the other leg.
Exeunt Childeen.
I?ve had a hard day?s wash ?you'll say that 1 don?t
look it?
I?ll hang the washing up to dry ?and hook it.


Ah ! when a blushing maiden I?d mashers of all kinds,
Until I married Ali?then came hard ?clothes lines.
One handkerchief ?I?m sorry I entered bonds of wed
lock,
He has no money and only has ?one sock.
Now he neglects me ?my feelings are quite hurt,
Between us now there rises?half a shirt;
My spirits still are light?they won?t be long
Like a caged cowfinch ?I?ll burst into song.
I?ve met some jolly folk and awful dodgers,
Since I have tried my hand at taking lodgers.
Song and exit.
Enter Ali Baba ?(With Piano).
It ain?t no good ?not one cent, can I borrow,
And rent day will be round again to-morrow ;
I?ve tried, but cannot raise another tanner,
Old Isaac won?t advance on my pianner.
It?s very ?ard ?the works ?ave all gone bung,
Like me, it?s very flat, and quite unstrung.
And then there?s Cogia ?always finding fault,
And taking too much drink containing malt.
My lot is what you can?t deny?s a sad ?en,
Then G-anem too?s turned out areg?lar bad ?en.
My only son ?I thought he?d win renown ?
Now he belongs to every push in town.
He?s struck upon a girl called Morgiana,
Who?s turned his turnip head with dancing, darn ?er
To crown it all, my donkey?s gone on strike,
Because I used a whip he didn?t like.
You may think this a rather queer rig out,
But all my other clothes are up the spout.
I?m blessed if I know how all this will end
Unless I find a rich?too trusting friend.
When I was flourishing I had too many ;
But now I?m broke, I?m blowed if I?ve got any.
There was a maid I hoped my friend to call,
But she was false, I met her at a ball.
Couplet Song and exit.
{Enter Cogia.)
. A nice look out, nothing again for dinner,
I?ll have it fried, no wonder 1 get thinner.
Our larder is like time, d?vou see the point ?
Because, as Hamlet says, it?s out of joint.
{Enter Ganem.)
Hallo, Ma! got anything to eat ?
I am so hungry, and I?m quite dead beat;
Have you seen Morgy, Ma ? she said she?d call.


Cot. Look here, my boy, I tell you once for all,
I won?t allow that servant girl in here.
You?re getting far too thick with her, my dear!
Ga. What if lam ? you?d find her hard to beat ;
And but for her, I?d not get much to eat.
Cot. Next time she calls, I mean to interview her.
Ga. (at door ) Well, here she is?Now ma, be civil to her.
Don?t put on side?We haven?t got a tanner.
(2b Morg .) Oh ! Come in dear. Mamma, here?s
Morgiana,
(Enter Mobgiaita.)
Moeg. I?ve just stole in.
Cog. That?s all you could steal here,
We are reduced, as you can see, my dear.
Moeg. Oh, Ganem, I have brought you such a treat.
Ga. Have you, my darling ? Then I?ll take it sweet.
(Kisses her.')
Moeg. ? It,? dear, is singular, and you?ve taken two.
Ga. And 3?4?5?6.
Moeg. Come, that?ll do.
Cog. This is enough to drive a mother wild,
To see her first-born son and fav?rite child
Kissing of a servant.
Ga. Look here, drop it mother,
Or I?ll be rude and tell you you?re another.
Cog. Hear the ungrateful boy ?right in my teeth
He throws my troubles ?I am not beneath
My household duties ?yet I can?t forget
That I?m a lady.
Ga. And so?s she ?you bet.
Cog. It?s true, to fetch and carry, I make shift.
Moeg. Then I?m the better off, I?ve got a lift.
Ga. She?s got a lift?that means, my dearest Ma,
That she?s as good as me, and you, and Pa.
Moeg. Ganem, I?ve brought you such a pretty dinner,
(Aside) And stole it too, as I?m a living sinner ;
Perhaps, dear, your mother, if I dared to ask it,
Would deign?
Ga. I know you mean the luncheon basket.
This basket, mother dear, you see contains
Half a cold fowl, ham, mustard, and two drains
Of fine old sherry, a colonial brand,
As good as foreign stuff, I understand.
Moeg. Excuse me, Madam, try a glass of sherbet.

Cou. My pride revolts ! well, well, I?ll try to curb it.
Ga, Where?s father ? eight o?clock he said would
See him at work.
Cog. My dear, he?s catching Edward.
Ga. That isn?t rhyme.
Cog. I know my son?it?s reason,
A rarity in Parliament this season.
(Donkey heard.)
Cou. But stay, I hear his voice, fill up my plate ?
I shall be sorry if he comes too late
To share our meal ?but if he comes too soon
He?ll overeat himself ; give me that spoon.
{Enter Alt Baba.)
Ali. What! Cogia here, and ?am I dreaming?eating!
Ga. A little dinner, Dad, of Morgy?s treating.
Ali. Let me eat too ?indeed, I tell no cram,
My breakfast was a treatise upon jam.
A treat is very nice once in a way.
Cou. But you?re too late, dear, try some other day.
Ali. The luncheon basket empty P
Cou, Yes dear, quite.
A lt. Were it a leather bag, then dine I might.
Oh, cursed lot.
Ga. Now, Daddy, don?t take on.
An. This is the third day without food I?ve gone.
Ga. No matter, come to work, there is no telling
What we may find as we the trees are felling.
Ali. I?m sick of work ?it?s just what I don?t like ;
I?m blessed if I don?t mean to go on strike.
Cog. I?ll strike you ?hurry up now, off you go.
Alt. I shan?t.
Cog. You shall.
Alt. Don?t hit me now, it?s low.
{Exit Alt and Ganem.)
Mono. I?m sorry you have had such heavy los'ses.
Cog. My dear, this comes of Ali backing bosses.
Why, everything we had to pawn has gone !
We?ll soon have nothing left to sit-a-pawn.
{Enter Ceeulo.)
Cebu. A writ!
Cog. All right, we really cannot pay.
Mopg. Could you not call again another day?
Cebu. I will withdraw, miss, if you will relent,
And to my suite give but your kind consent.


Moeg. My heart is steeled, though you would be its
stealer,
I list to no appeal, man, from a peeler.
Cog. He?s not so bad, he says his life is blighted ?
Cebu. I love her madly !
Cog. Girl, you should be delighted.
Cebu. The bailiffs are coming up my dear, decide;
Moeg. I?ll never be a low policeman?s bride.
To threaten women how brave you must be.
Cog. All right, you?ve done it, and you?ve done for me.
(Enter Bailiffs ?Enter Alt Baba.)
Ali. Hello ! Hello ! here?s pretty goings on !
Is this a house warming I?ve dropped in upon ?
Pray who are you, and who are you my hearty ?
Oh, I suppose you are the labour party.
Well, well, you may fill Berry and old Shiels with
fear,
But you can?t carry any of your games on here.
Alt. The bluff don?t seem to go, no more do they,
I think we?ll have to try another lay.
The force of Bagdad, though it?s quite efficient
In point of numbers, stands a bit deficient;
Behold it here complete, a force of three
To carry out great Bagdad?s writ decree.
I?ll make you shift! Ganem my boy?s without.
(Calls) Ganem, bring Edward and put them all to rout.
(Enter Ganem and Donkey.)
Cebu, What ! meet my men with organised resistance !
I call on every one to give assistance.
You?ll have to take yourself in charge old chap,
I?ll swear in each one of you a special trap.
Ga. What?s the row, father P
A li. Money.
q. a What, the bank rate riz ?
Ali. Look here, we?ve got no coin, we?ve lately done no biz.
I?ve tried to borrow, but can?t raise a loan,
I?m like New South Wales, my credit?s gone.
Ga, What does it all mean, Morgy P
Moegt. Why this limb
Did it because I wouldn?t marry him,
Ga. What! marry such a
Alk Don?t you use bad language.
They?ll take you off between then like a sangwich.
Come Edward, fight ?em, donkey of a thousand,
mine.


Cog. Not quite so good as that ?he?s only ass-in-nine.
Ceru. I?m wanted ! hark, the piercing cry of police?
Pall in, my men. (Aside.) Thanks, much, for this
release.
Finale (? Ding-a-ding.")
SCENE IV?Market Place at Bagdad.
Opening Chorus and Fat Boy?s Song.
(Enter Hassaeac, Ahmed, Mirza, Dot and Stabba.)
Hass. 1 think I?m well disguised! no one believes
That I?m a member of the Forty Thieves.
Or ?neath this homely merchant?s coat
Lives one who dearly loves to cut a throat.
Ha! ha! some day, before the sun has risen,
Each one will wake and find I?ve cut his wizzsn.
Song? Hassarac.
Ahmed. You?re awful noisy when no work is on.
Stabba. And when there?s any, Ahmed, you are gone.
Mur. You?ve hit him off, young Stabba, nicely.
Say ! is that so, Lieutenant Dot P
Dot. Pwecisely.
Hass. What do you say ? you sneaks who?ve crawled,
and toadied.
Ahmed. No quarrel here, with danger it is loaded.
See ! we?re observed ; I think we?d better march.
Must. The keystone of the Democratic Arch ?
The great Bill Winter?told me to beware;
That some dishonest folks would raid the fair.
Mirza. Now boys, beware of that bootmaker there,
He?s just put on a most suspicious air.
Hass. He wants a few more ?airs, he?s nearly bald,
He?s only got one stall ?and I?m four-stalled,
I would have shaved off every lock he had?
How do you do;? Quite well! lam so glad.
We know your mother, how is she ?
Must. Nicely.
Hass. I?m glad of that.
Mur. I?m very glad.
Dot. Pwecisely.
Hass. Your brother, too, I very well remember.
Must. He?s doing well now, he?s a labour member.


Hass. WeVe come to see your very jolly fair.
You make boots?say! could you make me a pair r
Just take my measure. (Bus.)
Oh ! I am so sorry.
Come, let me pick you up.
Must. You needn?t worry.
Ahmed. He didn?t mean it.
Stabba. 'Twas not done wisely.
Hass (, fiercly ). What do you mean ?
Stabba. Oh, nothing !
Hot. Pwecisely.
(j Enter G-anem, knocks against Hassarac.)
H ass. Look out! you fellow ! where are you going to?
Ga. Fellow ! I hurl the vile word back to you.
Hass. Look! don?t you answer in that cheeky tone!
(drawing.)
G-a. Gar?n now, take my tip, leave me alone.
Hass. I?ll have your life?a jacket! apes you are, sir.
(Ga. knocks him down )
Hass. There now, you?ve disarranged my poor-house
plaster.
Stabba. You will betray us if you go too far. Come
a wav.
Ahmed. You fool!
Mur. You?re mad !
Dot. Precisely.
Hass. Kali
(All exeunt .)
Ga. They look a jolly harum scarum lot;
Law!" what a lot of ugly mugs they?ve got.
Not one of them could captivate a lady?
It strikes me they are up to something shady.
(Song and exit.)
Stabba (entering). Ah ! Hassarac ! yo u?ve put the cap-
tain in an awful way.
Hass. Captain? he?s a pretty captain I must say.
Thinks more of togging up, and going on the mash
Than easing old gents of their superflous cash.
Smokes cigarettes ?his gloves are kid, you see;
Look at my gloves, there?s no kid about me.
His boots are three's, and made of patent leather,
Mine, Tyne-built steamers, meant to stand all
? y
VYCfttiicr*
He?s no use to us ?see that P a blind man can?
For a proper Captaiu now, I am your man.


Stabba. Eh ! what say, boys ?
Ahmed. Shall we give him the chuck ?
Mur Here he comes ; ask him, I .vish you luck.
Abd. {Enters.') Ah, my friends, to see you I?m
enchanted.
It?s clear, I?ve not arrived before I?m wanted.
Hassarac?s at his old games again, I see;
Would be your leader, boys, instead of me.
To quell this plot, it?s clear, I must be smart,
What did you say, talking just now apart ?
Hass. That ?er ?a ?your ?er ? arrival ?
Abd. That?s true, I?ll swear.
I am a rival ?yours ?I had him there.
Song.
{Enter Morgiana.)
Morg. It?s no use, I can?t get credit, well I never ?
But then, of course, it can?t go on for ever;
How the family are to live, I cannot see,
1 must fall back on ?
Abd. Yes, fall back on me.
Morg. A gentleman, really, I ivas not aware ?
Abd. Could you direct me to ?er ?anywhere P
Morg. Sorry, but I?ve never been there ; what?s here ?
Hass. lam another gentleman, my dear.
Abd. I wish I knew your name, sweet girl.
Morg. Morgiana.
Abd. Bliss!
Hass. Blisters !!
Morg. But, sir, Morgiauarally, I?m called Miss.
Abd. You can?t go past until I have a kiss.
Hass. Ah ! pretty one, come with us; do, my own-
Morg. Oh ! Ganem !! Ganem!!
{Enter Ganem.)
Ga. Go on with you ; let the girl alone.
Hass. Young man, I go, but not for fear of you!
We?ll meet again, and look out when we do !
(Hassarac and Thieves exeunt .)
Where have you been, dear?
Morg. Having such a lark
With a man who sells Australian men of mark.
1 made my mark on him, and tore his coat:
He looks as if he?d just been through a tote.
Ga. Come along, Morgy, let us have a spoon.


Morg. A spoon? what! here in daylight, just high
noon ?
A spoon ? why not a big soup ladle take ?
Ga. Well, that?s a most unladle-like remark to make.
(Duet and exit.')
{Enter All Baba and Cogia in Donkey Cart.)
Alt. Woa! Glenloath ! etc., etc.
{Examining Merchant's Wares.)
Ali. Will you trust me ?
Ist. Dealer. I think it would be rash.
Ali. P?r?aps so, but there?s no credit in paying cash.
To run a good account is far more clever.
Dealer. But, like the brook, yours would run on for
ever.
2nd. Do. We want to see your coin.
Ali. You shall {Bus.) to-morrow.
Ist. Dr. We?ve heard that tale before.
2nd Dr. Yes, to our sorrow.
Cog. Do you think Ali Baba cannot pay ?
Ist Dr. AVell, we?re not sure about it quite
Dealers. Good-day.
Cog. Look! Ali, look! there?s Ganem kissing Mor-
giana!
You really must check her familiar manner.
He?s at it still ?this mashing I?ll forbid?
Look !! did you ever ?
Ali. No, I never did.
She wouldn?t let me ?
Cog. The minx?there, I could whip her.
{Exit)
Ali. She?s got a temper like my little nipper.
Song?Alt? ?Our little nipper .?
{Enter Cog.)
Ali. Stopped?em, old girl?
Cog. I?m not an old girl.
Ali. Hey-dey !
Cog. I never was a gixd, I?ve always been a lady.
Ali. You have, my dear, your manners show it.
Cog. I can?t stand this now Ali?blow it.
Ali. I will.


Cog. Where are you going P
Alt. To get a drink.
Cog. Not q ui te-
You don?t leave here.
Ali. Think not ?
Cog. No!
Ali. Perhaps you?re righ t
Cog. Why don?t you work ? it?s no use selling wood !
That won?t keep us !
Ali. I?d get more if I could.
I?ve done my best to meet that blessed writ,
But don?t seem any nearer ?
Cog. Not a bit.
Ali. I?m in for another lecture I suppose.
Cog. Have you got the rent r
Alt. No ?only in my clothes.
Cog. Won?t G-anem work ?
Alp. No, he defies us both ;
Why ever didn?t G-anera back Glenloath ?
I?ll try my brother.
Ga. I would if I we\. K vou.
Here he comes.
(Enter Cassim.)
Cass. Ah ! Ali, how do ?
Alt. How do ?
Cass. Upon my word, its most humiliating,
One?s poor relations are so irritating.
Well, what d?you want ?
Alt. Sorry to trouble you, here !
But ?er ?could you ?er? lend me fourpence ?
Cass, I? no fear
Ali. I wish you would, I?ll pay you back to-morrow.
Cass You always say that when you want to borrow.
Get away home!
Cog I shan?t! pray who are you?
Cass. Excuse me if I just remark pooh ! pooh.!
Ali. Don?t you say pooh pooh to Mrs. Baba,
Its actionable.
Ga. (entering). Don?t you go too far, Pa.
Ali. Some years since I lent Cassim half-a-dollar.
Cog. Time was when he could only boast one collar.
Cass- It isn?t true.
Cog. You know it is.
Cass. ?Tis not.
You?re all a jealous good-for-nothing lot,
And you?re no lady.

? Shall your songs of praise be chanted
To the land that gave ye birth,
Whilst ye scorn the vine implanted
In your own good native earth ?
Let the juice of grapes exotic,
Cheer the world beyond the line ;
If your hearts be patriotic,
Warm them with Australian Wine !
A draught of the Wine that was raised on the soil,
From the fruit of the vine in the land where ye.toil;
To the gold in the mine, and the corn, and the oil,
We will drink in the Wine of Australia ! ?

Cog. Oh ! that?s very funny.
Alt. . You think you?re everyone now you?ve got money
You tell your friends you always had a heap,
I?ll let them know it?s from the big cup sweep.
You cad !
Cass. What! call me cad ! all right,
Come round our back yard if you want to fight!
{Enter Cebulo.)
Ceku. Hallo ! hallo ! what?s up ?
Ga. {knocks him down). You?re down.
Ceru. Help ! murder ! thieves ! I?ve been done brown
Alt. {mesmerist bus.) You?re all right now.
Ceru. You can?t be loitering here !
Ga. D?you want another, eh ?
Ceru. No jolly fear.
Alt. Gauem, that?s rude, the police are rather weak,
You mustn?t hurt them?this is the way to speak.
Look here ! you needn?t think because we?re broke
You?re going to talk to us like comming folk.
We may be shabby, but we are genteel,
And slights like that we very keenly feel.
Gta. That?s quite right, dad, don?t you be sat upon.
Alt. All right, my man, I?ll pardon you, be gone.
Ceru. Move on, I say.
Alt, Who are you talking to P
I haven?t sixpence, here?s an 1.0.TJ.
Just go and drink my health.
Ceru. I?ll run you in !
Alt. You?ll try, just let me know when you begin
(squaring up.)
I?ve given you a very handsome tip.
Ga. If you get my dad riled, he?ll give you jip.
Alt. Don?t try no funny business on with me,
?Cause I?m a gentleman ?ere you are ! see?
Ceru. Would you obstruct us when we do our'duty?
Ga. Don?t touch ray dad, or else I?ll spoil your beauty.
Alt. Look here, you?d better go and look for clues,
That?s all you seem to look for?barring boose.
You very seldom catch a man, it?s true,
But still, the police have always got a clue.
Their knowing heads are always wiggle wagging,
While burglars other people?s things are bagging.
And thieves are sticking people up, and scragging
With knives and things, their victims fiercely jag-
ging-


In risky duties, you are always flagging,
And mashing cooks, or harmless ueople nagging;
You let the villains go who most want lagging,
While honest folks you?re always bullyragging.
1 think of all you do, you?re best at magging
{panting for breath), and bragging.
Now you can speak, because I?ve finished gagging.
(Ali sinks exhausted, and Cerulo arrests him.)
(Re-enter Morgiatta.)
Ceru. By jove, for that I?ll take you straight in charge,
A man with so much gas must not be left at large
Alt. Hands off! or if you don?t you?ll rue the day,
I have a brother who?s an M.L.A.
Cerit. {releasing him.) I b:g your pardon, sir, forgive
my error.
Alt. {aside.) I thought that lie would fill the fool with
terror.
{Aloud.) All right, but don?t let this occur again,
Or else you?ll find you?ve boarded the wrong train.
Have another 1.0. U. ?
Ceru. Thanks.
Alt. Don?t mention it.
Don?t blue it all at once ! Now you can get.
Morg- That horrid Cassim, going on that way.
GtA- You shall not serve them, dear, another day
Cass- We wouldn?t take her back, you cheeky whelp.
Gta. Mother, let Morgy be your lady help P
Cog. That sounds genteel, I rather think I will.
Alt, Another mouth to feed, another bill.
Morg. A lady help ? well that?s a rise indeed,
The only rise 1 get; but to succeed
In getting near my Granem?s more to me,
Than the mere thought of the horrid � s. n-
Cog- Now, Morgiana, listen to your duties.
Alt. I hope you?re intellect, like mine, astute is.
Cog. You?ll rise betimes, then draw the water ?boil it.
And then assist me with my morning toilette.
Morg. A toil it will not be, ma?am, but a pleasure,
Do you use Pear?s Soap ?
Cog. Well, in a measure.
We don?t take breakfast.
Alt. We seldom dine.
Morg. Then shan?t I wait at table?
Alt, No ; in fine,
We?re too genteel for meals.

Morg. Then I?m afraid
At table I shall be a waiting maid.

Cog. Well, really, so have 11
Ceru. Why, that?s impossible when I?m close by !
But if you are, we?d best be off I think ;
We?ll catch the thieves, but first we?ll have a drink,

All. No !

I?ll tell you that we are the forty thieves-

Hass. If you would stop our exit, you shall die.

Let every hero seize his lovely maid. ( Bus .)

At our command is made to pay us duty.

ACT 11.
SCENE I.?Exterior of Cave.
(Opening Chorus of Woodland Fairies)
Come, fairies all, and work a magic spell;
Theives creep and crawl about our woodland dell.
Fierce bushrangers now infest the wood ?
Forty robbers ?none are any good.
Solo ?Fairy Queen.
We?ll upset their tricks and scheming,
When of foes they are not dreaming;
When the rosy wine is streaming,
Then their secret we?ll betray.
All the treasure they are hiding,
From their hands will soon be gliding,
To enrich the law abiding,
Who shall have them, fairies ? say.
Chorus. ?Fecit.
All the gold they harbour?We give to Ali Baba.
Full Chorus.
Ali Baba will be leading,
Badly money is he needing;
When the robbers are not heeding
We wdll bring him to the cave.
All their goods, he shall receive them,
Not a penny shall he leave them,
To despair the loss will grieve them,
Crushing every sorbid knave.
(Exeunt Fairies.)
{Enter Morgiana.)
Ganem?s out wood-cutting ?I feel alarms!
Rough oaks and elms will spoil his tender palms.
He used to take me out, altho? his mar
Declared I was beneath his station far.
Cogia?s the bos ?one sees that at a glance ?
If Ganem marries me, I?ll lead him such a dance,
Mor
(Dance and exit.)
{Enter Hassarac.)


Hass. Thwarted, spurned, trampled on through life I?ve
been!
Not that I mind it, if it hadn?t been rubbed in.
Now there?s the Captain, will his duty shirk,
Of course I am kept in to do his work ;
I do his bidding with a visage glum,
Merely remarking that a time will come.
If he discovers that I hate him so,
To somewhere {points down ) either he or I must go ;
There isn?t room for both upon the earth:
I?ve been an awful villain from my birth ;
When 1 was four I burned Chicago down,
Altho? the fact was really never known.
In all the bank and mining swindles here,
I?m at the bottom, though I have kept clear
Of Police ?so well I can disguise my face.
I hate my Captain, ought to have his plaoe?
But there?s no justice ?if I had my dues,
1 ?d a-had my portrait,weeks back, in the Police ?noose.?
(Song and exit.)
{Enter Ali Baba, Ganem, and Donkey.)
(Ali driving Donkey with a big sticlc.)
Ga. lam so tired, no further can I go.
(Donkey kicks Ali over.)
Ali. Here! steady, Edward.
Ga. What?s the matter P
Ali. Whoa!
Now then! get up, {lcicJcs donlcey) oh, it?s no use,
I never saw a donkey such a goose,
Ga. Poor Edward?s lame, and therefore calls a halt.
Ali. I think we?ve lost our way, I?m quite at fault.
Ga. I?m tired of walking, let?s sit down and rest.
Alt. I?m blowed if I?m not blown ?I give it best.
Ga. It?s no good giving in, leastways at present,
So cheer up, dear old dad, and let?s be pleasant;
We?d better get the firewood while we?re stopping.
Ali. Oh, burn the firewood,Pveuo strength for chopping;
Yet, I suppose, an effort I must make,
If I don?t chop, I?ll never earn a steak.
Ga. Well, take your axe, and show you?ve got some sense.
Ali. All right?but I?m afraid of ax-e-dents.
Oh, I?m down, right on my jocular vein.
Ga. Now, like the Melbourne streets, you?re up again.
My eye, it?s fine ! I wonder where we are ?
Here?s native roses and the Waratah.
Ali. We?ll sneak a few, I think ?there?s no one by?
We?ll have a finger in Dame Nature?s pie.
(Duet.)


Ali. I?ve had a reg?lar dog fancier?s lark,
I?ve been looking for?what?ll bark.
Ga. I s?pose you thought therewith to make a tanner,.
Ali. Ganem, I don?t like your flippant manner.
The place is full of snakes and eucalyptus.
Ga. A cure for influenza ?that was tipped us.
Pa, what?s the matter with Edward ? he won?t go.
Alt. He?s deaf, and waiting to hear if anyone says whoa.
The poor moke can?t get on, they?re such rough ways,
Whene?er he climbs a bank, hear how he brays:
? Ye banks and brays of bonnie .?
( DoNKEYyhZZs ? doon ? again.)
Ali. I?ll twist his tail.
We?re all right in the main ;
It?s no good, he won?t move.
Ga. Look, father, look !
What means that cloud of dust across the brook ?
Ali. So help me ?it?s a troop of mounted men.
Ga. They cross the brook and now come through the glen.
Ali. I?m off.
Ga. All right, dad, don?t alarm ye,
It?s only General Booth?s Salvation Army.
Alt. Now they dismount, those bags, look! full of plunder!
Ga. The famous forty thieves.
Ali. I wouldn?t wonder.
Ga. It?s certain death if you and I they see.
Alt. We?ll get ?like female suffrage?up a tree.
Edward, dear boy, if you feel in a funk,
Just pack yourself inside that hollow trunk.
(Enter Thieves.)
Abu. Steady boys, attention ! don?t think less o? me.
Lead on to sweet home comforts ?Open Sesame.
{Exit Thieves.)
Ali. There, now, they?ve all gone in?
Ga. Excepting one.
Alt. You watch my courage ! see me make him run !
Where?s my disguise? Oh, in the sack, of course.
Here ! Edward.
{Enter Donkey.)
He?ll think that I?m one of the force.
I?ll settle him ?then wait till they come out,
And stiffen all the lot without a doubt.
You keep a good look-out! if more appear,
Give me the office ?not that I should clear. {Exit Ga.)
Oh no, I?d rush ?I?d beat the record when I ran ;
Now, first, I will intimidate my man.
A policeman?s duty?s child?s play to me,
Because my brother-in-law?s a bobby, see ?

When this gets known, the female menial throng
Will try to mash me as I walk along.
Look here, young fellow, don?t stand there?move on.
Young fellow, are you deaf P why ain?t you gone P
You won?t move on ? Then lend us half-a-crown.
Look! if you get me riled, I?ll ?I?ll knock you down.
Speak ! will you ? I won?t have you loafing hear ?
This ain?t the Pitzroy Gardens ?so just clear.
Now ! once for all, will you move on?or shout ?
All right, young gentleman ?I?ll take it out.
Take that! don?t hit me back, my beauty :
I?ll nabb you for assaulting police on duty.
By jove ! he don?t show fight, that?s what I like ?
To punch a man who never goes on strike.
I got the best of that without a doubt ?
I?ll cook the others too, when they come out.
([Enter Ga.)
Ga. Are you there, father ? Thought you?d run away.
Alt. I run? Not likely, lad, I?ve won the day.
Ganem, you should be proud of your papa.
. I killed him ! there he is? so, there you are.
I?m sick of waiting for ?em to come out;
I burn and rage to put ?em all to rout.
Ga. Well let?s go in?such wealth .within our reach.
Ali. Take stolen goods ? On that I?ll make a speech.
Ga. Oh, bother speaking, this is time for action.
Ali. What was the word ? I can?t think?Oh! distraction.
Ga. Unless we think of it, how can we enter ?
Ali. I?m blowed if I know, but we?ll make a vent?er.
Open, open, senna tea ?no, that?s not it.
Ga. I think it?s ?
Ali. No it isn?t ? wait a bit!
O ?0 ?Open sausages! No! Wrong again.
Open sarsaparilla ! Oh, my brain.
Let?s see ?Open damm !!! That?s not it.
Ga. You?re losing all your manners.
Ali. Take a fit.
Open sardines ! Open oysters !! Open soda-water!!!
Oh, Ganem, can?t you think ?
Ga. No.
Alt- Well, you ought?er.
Come! Have a try ?just look at the distress ?o me.
Ga. That?s something like it, I know?Open, Open,
Sess-o-me.
(j �oth fall exhausted. Cave opens.)


Alt. That?s a division quite unlocked for.
GrA.' Yes.
Simple division that is. Tour address
On stolen goods must befpostponed.
Alt. My point I waive.
G-a. That?s right, then we?ll ransack the cave.
Ali. But stay one moment! if, my boy, we fail,
Our next address will be the Pentridge Gaol.
Ga. But, what an opening for a young man.
Alt. True.
You go in first, and I will follow you !
0-A. I knew we?d do it if we only tried.
Alt. Now, all we?ve got to do is walk inside.
(Change of scene.)
SCENE ll.?lnterior of Cave.
Opening Chorus and Song?Hassaeac.
(Thieves discovered.)
Add. Safe home once more, and glad to be, you bet;
Now for my slippers and a cigarette.
Hass. That is theseg?ret of our success.
Add. Success ! our books are in a fearful mess.
Add. Bring me some lemonade.
Hass. Nice taste you?ve got;
Spirits for me ?I like ?em strong and hot.
Por fiery drink, most marvellous my gift is ;
Por aqua fortis and for aqua fifties.
{All cheer). Hooray! hooray! they all hooray to
rights !
Shut up ! You?re not the hooray-bian nights.
Hass. Look here ! the time has come for me to speak:
AYe have been too good-natured and too weak ;
We?ve lived on borrowed money; now the times
Are just as bad here as in other climes ;
And forty mouths to feed, so much per day,
Six pounds a week each?why the thing don?t pay,
And to sum up, my boys?now don?t look cross ?
AYe?re carrying on the business at a loss.


Abd. This can?t go on. For some months past, alas!
I?ve hardly made my taxes, rent, and gas.
I don?t hlameyou?you?re splendid thieves, but then
You can?t make trade, no more than working men ;
Times are so bad, and we, o� course, must feel it;
The men who make a thing, and those who steal it.
Well! Hassarac, how have you done?
Hass. Not a line;
In Melbourne they are cutting things so fine.
Such heavy duties?so much competition?
That all the thieves are going to perdition.
We?ll stir them up though, soon.
Abd. Now, my dear sir, '
Your, words are empty, for there?s naught to stir.
There?s want of confidence.
Hass. I know the feeling ;
There?s under selling ?and there?s under stealing.
The times have changed ; a thief?s life once was splen
did,
And, even when it in a dungeon ended,
He?d gaily file his bars.
Abd. Away, ambition !
Hass. Your modern thief now files ?
All. What ?
Hass. * His petition.
Dot. I?m getting tired of this job, don-cher-know,
Eau-de-Cologne please.
Abd. Ai?en?t you well ?
Dot. Just so-so.
This walking takes the polish off my boots,
And spoiling all my captivating suits.
When I became a robber don-cher-know,
I thought that I should only have to go
And join swell clubs, pluck pigeons, sharp aflat,
Hun off with pretty girls and things like that;
If that was wanted ?I could do it well.
Hass. Ah ! Dot, you?re a perfect robber swell.
The Victoria cross of crime?l think we wear it;
And as we earned the plunder ?why, let?s share it.
What say you, boys ?
Miez. Yes, let them have their due.
Abd. Make your demands?l?ll see you all put through.
Dot. I only want this little beauty here,
If she with love my lonely hours will cheer.
Abd. We?ll ask the ladies?if they are content,
You have your captain?s free and full consent.


For ladies rule the hunt, as mankind knows;
They go for women?s rights ?and to the men propose.
Song.
Ann. Bring out the wine; to pass the time away
Our slaves shall cheer us with a bright display.
Hass. Bring out the slaves; we keep them to amuse,
And lately they have hardly earned their screws.
Hass. Captain, we?re robbed! some treasure has been
taken!
A thief is here ! Or I am much mistaken.
Abd. Ah ! these two lambs are always on the fleece.
Turn out your pockets !
Half-a-crown a piece.
Ahm. & Stabba. Captain, we swear !
Hass. You always do! I?ll dish you!
Down on these knees, you needy thieves?
Cassim. Atischu!
All, Why, what was that ?
Hass. Upon my word, that?s queer.
Some one is present who has no right here.
Ahm:. That bag!
Stabba. Alive!!
Miez. I saw it move this minute.
Hass. If it moved, stupid, there must be someone in it.
It is the man who stole our little savings.
Abb. Come out! no Larkins. {Drags Cassim out.)
All. Ha ! ha !
Cassim. Oh, good Havings !!
Mercy, good sirs ! indeed I only meant
To have a quiet look round.
Hass. Yarlet, repent
Your sins.
The vice of stealing can?t be pardoned here.
Prrre-Parrre to Crrroak ! Your end, my friend, is
near.
Cass. Half! all I have for freedom !
Abd. What ? no fear!
Half-and-half measures will not suit us here !
Into the outer cave, away, and slaughter him !
Hang him up first, then cut him down and quarter him.
(They talce Cassim off.)
(Enter Ali, G-a, and Donkey.)
Oa. Grood gracious ! what a lot of pretty things,
Sacks full of golden chains and jewelled rings.


Alt. It?s like a blooming pawn shop?pawn myjjword ;
Well this beats everything I?ve seen or heard.
Q-a. Oh, look here, Pa!
Ali. Oh, ain?t it perfect bliss ;
Gee-rusalem ! here, Edward, look at this.
Q-a. It ain?t to eat, you fool, although I know
It?s eighteen carrot! here, old boy, let go !
Ali. This is a bank, yet there are no cashiers.
Cash here?s in plenty, and it just appears
That it?s in order?nothing could be fairer
Than to draw a cheque in favor of the bearer.
Qa. Be quiet, Edward ?come on father ?mind
Let?s search the place and see what we can?find.
(Exeunt Alt, Qa. and Donket.)
RENO.
(Enter Moegiana.)
Moe,
l. What, nobody about? that?s very queer ;
I?m sure that I saw Qanem enter here
With Ali Baba and the Donkey who
Left the door open, so I came in too.
I thought when they went out they meant no good,
So followed them unnoticed through the wood.


Oil, dear, I "hope they?ve met with no mischance,
There?s gold and jewels everywhere I glance.
lam so frightened, what?s that! Oh, I shake with fear!
I?m sure that demons hold their revels here.
So beautiful ?it?s just like fairyland ;
For mortals such a palace is too grand.
{Noise.')
Oh dear, I?m lost! {on her fences.)
Oh, Mr. Bogie, please,
Your pardon I entreat upon my knees.
(Donkey noise.)
Good spirits, save me, I shall die with fright.
{Enter Alt, Ga. and Donkey.)
(Ali and Ga. groan again.)
My entrance here was accidental ?quite.
(Donkey noise.)
Oh, let me off this once, don?t let me plead in vain,
I promise not to come in here again.
I have done nothing wrong {groans). Oh, Bogie, don?t;
I won?t do it again, indeed, I won?t.
(Ganem and Ali laugh at her.)
(Moe. not seeing Donkey behind her.)
Oh, Ganem, I?m so thankful you are here;
I?m nearly dead with misery and fear.
A fearful dragon, just a moment since
Was going to bite your Morgy into mince.
I?m better now, for love, whate?er betide,
I fear no danger when you?re by my side.
(Donkey brays.)
(Moe. on her fences again.)
Oh, yes, I do, forgive the foolish boast;
Have mercy on us, kind good Mr. Ghost.
Ali. It ain?t a ghost ? it?s only Edward silly?
Ga. And he won?t hurt my Morgiana, will he ?
Moe. Well, I was just pretending ?for I knew
It was the donkey and the other two ?
You didn?t think that I was really frightened ?
Alt. It?s very natural the way you whitened.
Ga. My poor old Morgy ?was she trembling, then ?
The naughty ghost shan?t frighten her again.
Moe. I wasn?t frightened, sir !si told you so !


Q-a. Of course ; but you pretend so well, you know.
(Kiss.)
Alt. Here, don?t waist no more time in stupid kissing;
The chance of riches else we shall be missing.
Come, pile ?em on, and fill up all the sacks,
We?ll get bowled out, if we don?t soon make tracks.
Gta. Whoa ! Edward says he can?t stand any more.
Moeg. Well, there?s enough for one day ?wealth galore,
The bags are heavy.
Alt. Whoa! keep up your pecker;
You?re not the first ass that?s had charge of the
exchequer.
Mind ! steady, Edward, steady good old moke,
His back?s like this old bank ?it?s nearly broke.
Quaetette.
(Loud voice off.) So perish all who try our cave to
plunder ;
We?re down upon ?em like a clap of thunder.
(All panic stricken.)
(Tries to push Donkey along , Sfc.)
(Enter Hass.)
(Whistles. ?Enter Thieves.)
Hass. Seize them!
Comrades,we?re-robbed again!
Add. I?ll cut each robber?s throat.
Hass. Boss, you trusted too much to that labor vote,
I knew they?d squeeze you sooner or later.
Dot. .By Jove! it?s little Q-anem and his pater.
Eair Morgiana, too, 1 think I see.
Hass. Ha !ha ! my dear, you shall belong to me.
Moe. Oh no, she won?t. Young fellow, keep-your place,
Oa. Or else I?ll beautify your ugly face.
Alt. Blighted again, Hassy !
Abd. You three encroachers on our privacy.
Hass. Excuse me, boss, but I see more than three.
Alt. You have a bond, I think, each with the other:
No man of you shall recognise his brother.
We haven?t done you any mortal harm?
Our coming needn?t cause the least alarm.

ACT 111
SCENE I. ?Street and Courtyard.
(Enter Has., Abd. and Stabba disguised.)
Abb. To think those people had the nerve to go
And steal our secret; We?ll have no rest, I know.
Oh ! idiots, fools, the stupid dunderheaded dolts !
Our treasure is not safe now they can draw our bolts.
Hass. But we must work with hand and heart and brain,
To get the hard-earned plunder back again.
I?ve found the man who so much trouble gives,
And yet I can?t discover where he lives.
Stab. It?s somewhere hereabouts.
Hass. I?ll track it!
Abd. And once within the walls, I?ll sack it!
He must be slain !
Hass. What, gov?nor ! you mean blood-?
Abd. Of course I do, can?t Ibe understood ?
Hass. Of course you can ! but up to now, our story
Has only gory been in category.
Still, I?m not frightened, slaughter let it be,
I long to shed B-L-U double D.
Abd. My men are all concealed within the jars,
Hass. As comf?table as Melbourne railway cars.
I think they?ll get the stitch, they are so crammed ?
Preserve me, though, from being so real jammed.
Abd. A truce to foolery!
Hass. Oh ! with all my heart!
I?ll drop my jam if you won?t be so tart.
They?ve had some fun, and now just for variety,
We?ll bust ?em up like a building society.
Abd, A wait my signal?answer, every jar !
Are you prepared ?
Ist. ( Popping head up) We is.
2nd. ( Popping head up) We am.
3rd. {Popping head up) We are.
Abd. Down with you all, keep open eye and ear,
Hass. Here comes our man, I think we?d better clear.


Abd. We?ll watch and see which house the yarlet enters.
For in that house, o� course, our vengeance centres.
( Concerted .)
{Exit Abd., Hass., &c.)
(Enter Ali Baba.)
(Alt. and Cog. enter)
{Re-enter Abd., Hass,, &c.)
Abd. Good Ali Baba, I believe ?
Alt. The same.
Abd. Knew I was not mistaken in the name.
I am a merchant ?
Alt. Seeking, I infer,
Orders for wine ? *
Abd. Well, no ! you?re wrong, dear sir.
I?ll plead to you through this sweet maid divine ?
A gent, miss, in the ile and colour line,
Has heard of your Pa?s hospitality,
Cog. My pa ! Oh ! sir, come, no formality.
{Aside to Alt.) I told you I looked young ! see,
there you are !
Ali. I?m blessed if he don?t take me for her pa.
Abd. These forty jars of oil we want to store.
Hass. Excuse me, dear, I think we?ve met before.
Abd. Tour garden seemed so large? l thought perhaps
You could oblige us ?
Alt. Why ! of course, old chaps.
Coo. With pleasure.
It?s only for the night.
Alt. Long as you like, old fellow ?that?s all right.
Cog, {to Hass.) You bold, bad man.
Hass. Pay you! of course we shall.
{Aside) the giddy cat.
Ali. Glad to oblige a pal.
Abd. Thanks for your kindness.
Cog. Oh! it?s quite a pleasure.
Hass. In this fair creature you have got a treasure.
Ali. Oh ! not at all.
Cog. What?s that!
Ali. I mean, of course, my dear.
Abd. Good night!
Hass. Ta-ta, pet!
Ali. Good-day and good cheer.
{Exeunt Ali and Cog. into house)


Abd. Now that?s all settled, our success is sure,
You?d better make a chalk mark on the door. (Exit.)
(Enter Moegiana.)
Moe. A lady help ! no longer now must I
Polish up doorplate, handle and?oh my !
What means that chalk mark F it is my belief
That it?s the doings of some wicked thief.
But why our house alone P what is their game ?
Suppose I mark the other doors the same?
So now, if mischief?s meant, that will confuse it.
(Enter Ganbm.)
Ga. Oh ! Morgy darling, kiss me. You refuse it ?
Moe. Things are so changed; my sweetheart now is rich?
A gentleman.
Ga. And he?ll behave as sich.
Moe. But just look at the diff?rence in our stations.
Ga. Now Morgy ! I don?t like those observations.
The difference in my station, dear, will be
The best of comforts, both for you and me.
Moe. You still would wed me?
Ga. I should think so; rather
Despite the opposition of my father.
Moe. You?ve said that often, dear, but I?m afraid
That now you?re rich, a little serving maid
Will not content you.
Ga. This talk I cannot bear.
You?re a D serving maid.
Moe. Oh ! love, don?t swear.
Ga. I must, I will, I shall ?now I must leave you,
And swear inside, as swearing seems to grieve you.
(Exit into house.)
Moe. He?s very good, I?ll try to trust him more,
Still I can?t help wishing that he still was poor.
(Exit Moe.) (Enter Abd., Hass, and Dot.)
Hass. Here is the house.
Dot. I see you marked the door.
Abd. Don?t you fool me ! I?ve warned you sir, before !
Look ! every door is similarly figured !
Hass. Good gracious me! Je-rusalem! I?m jiggered !
Abd. Is this a joke ? if so, it?s badly done,
And you shall both pay dearly for your fun.
Just try again. (And exit as before.)
(Enter Ali. and Coo.)


Alt. Why somebody?s been chalking our door!
Beggars or thieves, I think I?ve queered their pitch.
?Twill puzzle them to find out which is which.
Cog. I have my doubts about those oily men.
We?re not at home mind, i� they call again.
Alt. Shove a bit of paper on the door, my dear !
Gone out for a minute, back again next year.
Cog. Why ! is that Cassim coming this way, Ali ?
Alt. Yes, dear, he?s coming up the bally alley.
Since his bad luck?when by the robbers nabbed,
When he was shot at, poisoned, hanged and stabbed,
Cut up in quarters, hung up in the cave ?
He?s quite a new man, knows how to behave.
{Enter Cassim.)
Alt. Ah ! bow do, Cassim ? how do F its very clear
We?re not too proud to know you ! have no fear.
Of course we?re swells, but all these alterations
Won?t make us cool toward our poor relations.
Cass. Ali! don?t try to put on side with me.
You?d best be civil, or I?ll let you see!
I?m very hurt!
Alt. Good gracious, man, shut up.
Turn off the tap.
Cass. Well, I do feel so cut up.
Alt. Cutup ? now look here, Cassim, I say, was it painful ?
Cass. Look here ! you needn?t treat me so disdainful.
There?s many lately who have worked your prank,
And grown rich through a green or swindling bank.
Alt. I ain?t forgotten, though you have no doubt,
You would?nt lend me fourpence, now I?ll pay you out.
Remember, I?m the rich relation now.
Fortune has changed.
Cog. Stop this ungenteel row.
Alt. What row ? what row ? such cheek I never heard !
You keep on talking, I?ve not said a word.
But I will say, and say it very plain:
We don?t want them to call on us again.
Cog. We can?t know everyone , you understand,
Now we?re the tip-top people in the land.
Cass. You?re snobs! so, snobbishly, of course, you act.
Alt. I can?t stand by while thus lam attacked.
Cass. You jelly-fish!
Alt. Don?t strike me, don?t!
Cog. Bor shame!
To fight before me! I?m alone to blame !
Forget now and forgive.


Ali. My head is in a whirl. '
{Enter Morgiana.)
Cog. Stop quarrelling ! now hush before the girl!
Mor. I?ve come to tell some news, so all keep calm.
Ali. I hope none of our treasure?s come to harm!
Mor. To-morrow I shall lay all care aside,
For I shall be my darling G-anem?s bride.
Cog. Marry my son ? nice goings on, I?m sure !
{Exit.)
Alt. It might have been the thing when we were poor.
{Exit.)
Cass. You have looked high, I must say, my young lady!
I never heard of anything so shady.
{Exit.)
Mor. They all look down on me ! yes, every one
Think?s I?m too humble for a rich man?s son ;
And yet my Ganem is so kind and true,
I wish he still was poor, indeed I do !
{Enter Fairy Queen.)
F.Q. Stay, pretty Morgiana, don?t despair!
You are my god-child, and it?s only fair
That I should help you, so a truce to grief,
In each of yonder jars there is a thief.
Hush ! do not start! they want to rob your master,
P?raps murder him and so complete disaster.
A dose of rough on rats will kill them straight,
And every thief deserves no better fate.
Mor. But if I fail ?
F.Q. You will not fail; now go !
And send the forty thieves to Jericho.
{Exit Fairy Queen.)
Mor. A dreadful task is this?it makes me quake ?
Yet I must do it for my G-anem?s sake ; .
It curds my blood so many to condemn,
Yet killing us, it seems, occurred to them.
To-morrow morn our wedding bells shall chime,
And I shall be so happy ?
Bobber. (In jar). Is it time?
Mor. How my heart beats, but I must answer
pleasantly ?
What shall I say ? I know ! not yet, but presently.
Mor. A man hid in the oil! oh ! I shall faint!
Like a sardine ?
Thief. Say, is it time ?

Uhc XEnumpb of Iboob, tbe
13-y ZES. 13.
SHE summers of his innocence in the garden at Glenferrie liad been gay with
bloom, so that his after-paths seemed more dreary by the contrast.
A small cottage, with two impudent-looking attic windows peering inquisi-
tively from their spectacles of jasmine and verbena climbers at the few passers-by
on the steep high-road, filled the centre of the gorgeous acre. In one corner
was what at one time had been a sumhier-house, now dilapidated and composed
more of creepers than wood, and suggestive of romance and earwigs. Seated in
the summer-house was a young girl, aged about 17 years. An open book lay dis-
regarded on her knees, for she was steeped in her usual daily languorous dream.
This girl is Amy Hood, sister of Hood, the Unstable. The father of these two
had handed his moral weakness to his son by way of a pre-natal legacy. Hood
the elder, when a fairly good-looking and wholly good-for-nothing profligate of 26
years, had married a pretty little woman who had been his mother?s companion.
The old lady lived at St. Kilda, andon her son?s marriage had presented him with the
rose-garden previously mentioned, and, what was more to the purpose, the cottage
built on it. The home of the newly married couple was situated at Glenferrie, a
suburb with an nnmistakeable out-of-town air, where, as the new Mrs. Hood put
it, ? Archie could rest his brain after business in that dreadful city.? Aichie was
supposed to be a hard worker in that much-adjectived ?city,? but, as a matter
of fact, his labours were confined to hazard, billiards, and bookmaking.
At her appointed time, the dowager, Mrs. Hood, died, leaving her property
unconditionally to her wayward son. But the cottage had been settled on the
ex-companion and her children for ever. Two of these hostages were given
them ?Archibald, now aged 12, and Amy, aged 6.
* * *
The gambler?s evil courses became, if it were possible, more confirmed than
ever. When his son was nineteen years old he realised his position. All his
mother?s property had gone?he was penniless. Suicide, he decided, was the
only possible escape, and to end his troubles, he resolved on very cowardly means,
considering that three innocent beings depended upon him for all. One evening
this man, aged by his own excesses, succumbed to an overdose of moi?phia. The
mild, inoffensive little wife was prostrated for a time by her husband s tragic
death. The son was too buoyant to be long affected by the occurrence ?his
fancies were temporarily tinged with a more serious colouring, and that was all.
But he failed to rise to' his responsibilities as the new ?man of the house,? much
in the same way that his father had earlier neglected those who were unfortunate
enough to place any dependence in him.
The resources of the Hoods at this time were composed in the ownership of
the little dwelling, and an annuity of �6O. The subject of this history secured a
clerkship in a metropolitan bank and for a few yearcs his diligence and aptitude
were untiring and seemingly inexhaustible. Promotion followed, and in the spring
of 188T, when Amy was nearly 17 years old, Archibald was appointed accountant
of the branch of the bank at Hawthorn.
That promotion ruined him. The inherent fondness of display that had
caused the father?s premature death began to evidence itself in the son. He
?doctored? the books of the bank to conceal his smaller defalcations, and when
the accounts became too involved for further manipulation, he seized all the notes
and gold he could and fled.
He entered the summer-house where Amy, half recumbent, was day-dreaming.
She noticed that he had his bank-bag with him, and it appeared bulky.
?Hallo, Arch,? she said, ?are you finished with cheques and discount for the
day ? ?


" Yes,? he answered ?it?s after four. I?m going to town, I have business at
the head-office. Tell the mater when she comes in not to wait dinner for me.
Good-bje, little girl.? He stooped and kissed her.
She watched him go out of the summer-house and through the richness of
bud and blossom that flung their sprays under his feet. He opened the gate and
passed through it, and the tall, irregular hedge shut him out from her sight.
* _ *
The news of the Unstable?s flight came like a lightning flash to his mother,
and almost struck her dead. But Amy remained to her, and the weak-framed,
faded little woman?stronger than any of the three moral infants who were leav
ing her one by one?lived on.
In August, 1884, Archibald was apprehended at Adelaide, and brought back
to Melbourne. The long unnecessary formalities of remanding him from one
court to another were over at last, his trial at the Sessions was proceeded with,
the jury found him guilty, and now the judge was to pass sentence.
? Property,? said that functionary, ? must be respected.? The prisoner had
spent .�6OOO of stolen money in debauchery and other extravagances. There
were no extenuating circumstances. The prisoner?s salary had been perfectly
sufficient for all reasonable wants, and his crime was aggravated by the manner
in which he had squandered the proceeds. He was sentenced so four years? im-
prisonment, with hard labour, the first week of the third, sixth, ninth, twelfth,
and fifteenth months to be spent in solitary confinement.
The poor woman on whom these two bolts ?the suicide of the father and the
criminality of the son?had fallen so heavily, was very ill. Amy had called in
Dr. Hemming, a recently diplomaed practitioner, who was very young, and just
as good-looking. This professional butterfly visited the cottage at Glenferrie
with two distinct results. The widow, though remaining hopelessly invalided,
was brought back from the very verge of the grave, and Amy Hood fell madly in
love with whom she considered was her mother?s saviour.
Hemming?s vanity was flattered by the girl?s avowed preference for him. He
dallied and imagined himself smitten with her charms, simulated ardor, and ?
wearied of her.
One autumn night, about 15 months after the Unstable began to expiate his
sin, Amy Hood crept guiltily our. of her mother?s house.
This third grief ended the widow?s life. The cottage was sold, and the little
money remaining after the debts and funeral expenses had been paid, was de-
posited in a Collins-street bank to the credit of the ?firm ? of Amy and Archibald
Hood. The senior partner of the firm was more likely to claim it than the
junior, but it was very improbable that it would ever be claimed at all. For all
that, advertisements prepaid for a period of four years appeared regularly in the
Melbourne and Sydney weeklies.
Dr. Hemming was forced to leave Glenferrie, owing to his practice leaving
him. The scandal consequent on Amy?s flight ruined him, and he also disappeared.
* *
Amy, on the night she left her mother?s house, had gone to Melbourne. Her
folly ended with the one false step she had taken in all the innocence of love.
She could never return, she felt, to the scene of her disgrace. Her child had,
fortunately, died before its mother?s affection had become very strong, and Amy
Hood, by means of heartbreaking labour, earned a precarious living in the
making up? of small articles of wear for a Flinders-lane soft goods house.
The sentence of Archibald Hood expired on the 10th June, 1889, and sundry
bad-conduct marks recorded against his name detained him in the gaol until the
last day of his servitude. On the date just mentioned, he was discharged from
the Stockade. The systematically healthy diet and labour of the prison had
improved his natually good constitution to one of iron?his muscles were sq
many bands and springs of steel. In short, the mistaken regime of the stockade
had converted the shivering felon, who had shed tears of shame and remorse,
and had prayed and cursed by turns in the dock of tae Central Criminal Court,
into a powerful desperado, who thought of nothing for his future support but the
spoliation of the law-abiding portion of the community He had just sufficient
shame left him to prevent him from seeing his mother and sister. He thought
of the ineffaceable wrong he had done them, and put the unpleasant memory
away from him impatiently.


He had been discharged from the gaol with all the property he had been rightly
possessed of at the time of his conviction, and this, he found, was composed of a
memorandum book, a pipe, a pouch half full of tobacco he had bought in Adelaide
just prior to his arrest, and �2 12s. in mixed money.
He walked to the railway station, boarded a train, and was soon afterwards
set down at Spencer-street. He stood outside the station' shivering in the
biting, winter breeze, and watched other people being bustled into cabs by
happy relatives and driven off in various directions. The sense of loneliness,
attendant on his new-found liberty was so oppressive, that he almost wished
himself in gaol again. There he had someone to speak to?here, there was noth-
ing more cheerful than the hard sounds of business and the harsh rattle of cabs.
A policeman told him to move on, and Archibald, who was beginning to feel sick
and giddy from the strange sights of the street, walked quickly down Bourke-
street and strolled aimlessly up and down in front of the theatres. At
near Eussell-street a hand fell on his shoulder and a squeaking voice said,
? Hello, are y?out ? ? The convict turned to the speaker, and saw a house-breaker
who had been liberated three months previously. The latest arrival from gaol
was almost happy at meeting this man who at least could, and would speak to
him.
So, linked arm in arm, they entered an hotel. Archibald ordered drinks, and
during their consumption, the news about town and the news at the Stockade
were interchanged, and the Unstable agreed to accompany his acquaintance to
a receiver?s house in Carlton, where a number of criminals lived in temporary
security. ? Dandy? Bone, the acquaintance of the ex-bank clerk, lived there,
and he was certain that ? any friend of his ? would be made welcome.
They left the hotel, and after a walk of about a mile reached a weather-beaten,
two-storied house in Bouverie-street. Dandy knocked at the door and the
?receiver,? a middle-aged Scotchman of very respectable appearance, opened to
them. Archibald was introduced, and his hand was shaken effusively, the
? fence ? remarking that he was ? verra verra glad tae see ony freend of Dendy?s ?
They entered the place and Dandy led the way to the upper flat of the building
and into a large room at the back furnished with the ordinary utensils of a
kitchen, a dining-table, a few chairs, and two single bedsteads. Seated on all
this various furniture was an heterogenous collection of males and females, to
whom Archibald was introduced by his guide, philosopher, and friend, the
garrulous Dandy, as ? a friend of mine that?s just done his time and got out.?
Then he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed his hands with childish
delight at the generous blaze. He had not enjoyed a fire for over four years
and a half, and he shivered at the memory of the dead winters he had passed
in that stone and iron hell the respectable uninitiated know as ?gaol.? The
last times he remembered sitting in front of a fire were on the evenings of the
winter prior to his accursed promotion to the Hawthorn branch of the bank?
when he sat on one side of the grate with bis mother opposite to him, listening
to Amy playing sweet old melodies, and languorous waltzes, seemingly sug-
gestive of perfume of the dead roses that had gilded and glorified the
departed summer. And this winter, possibly that very evening, the injured
women were sitting in the same old room thinking of him, while he was here in
the company of the most abandoned characters of Melbourne. He thought
over these things and sighed hopelessly.
The voice of Dandy, speaking in a very audible whisper, broke in on his memo-
ries. ? I tell yeh,? said Dandy, ? he?s hard to beat, he is. Why, that?s Hood,
what stood off the bank for 6000 quid.?
A man stepped out from the rest and smacked him familiarly on the shoulder.
? Look here, Hood,? he said, ? we?ve got a big thing on the tapvy (the rogue
affected French) and we want another man. Will you come in ??
? What is it F? queried Archibald, listlessly.
"It?s this. There?s to be a big spree and a dance at the Town Hall next
week. All the Toorak push will be there, and won?t get back till nearly daylight.
We propose to strike old Simpson?s house that night. You must know who
Simpson is.?,
Archibald did know Simpson?he had been chairman of the directing board
of the robbed bank. So the Unstable assented by a sigh.
? Well,? continued the man who affected French, ? after a dejuner here that
night we?ll go out there with a cart and loot the house. There?s only a few
servants and the coachman, and the other livery cove ?ull be driving old Simp..
and his missus to the ball. What d?yer say ?are you on ??


Hood was about to reply that he did not intend to try such big game at first,
and practically to decline having anything to do with the burglary, but the
adroit Dandy, divining his intention, placed that day?s Age in Archibald?s hand
with a remark to the effect that he hadn?t read many. papers lately.
Archibald glanced over the various headings listlessly, and at last fixed his
attention on an article descriptive of the ?sweating? in the local soft-goods
trade. He read the accounts of the oppression practised on starving seamstresses,
and finally came to a paragraph beginning ; ? Amy Hood, a seamstress, but
evidently superior to her present position, lives at 21 George-street, Carlton.
In conversation with our representative yesterday, she said: ?? And then
followed a story of the oppression and half starvation, to which an unequal society
dooms so many. Amy Hood had been too innocent to give herself a name of con-
venience, and so Archibald found his sister.
He called at the address that evening, and she told him of her own betrayal
and of her mother?s death. Before he came, she said, she had only wanted to die,
although she had been too frightened of death to attempt suicide. Now her
brother had returned, and he would lead a clean life, and they would be
happy again, if happiness had not absolutely deserted them; and he had promised
to reform, and to be at peace with the world, if it would let him, and even his
desire for revenge on Hemming was quenched. Amy told him she had just
finished a dress which must be delivered that night. She refused to allow him
to accompany her ; with some of her old coquetry she told him he would be in
the way, and so departed.
For over an hour the ex-bank clerk sat by the fire waiting Amy?s return.
She did not disappoint Death, who waited for her also.
But Hood, the Unstable, might watch for his sister till the day became gray
and wrinkled and old, and the darkness settled down, and the dawn broke agaiu,
but never more would her feet tread the paths that lead to the shedding of eternal
tears.
Archibald was awakened from his memories by a knocking on the door. He
heard somebody enquire ? if Amy Hood lived here,? and the answer of the lodg-
ing house keeper. And then steps sounded in the narrow passage, and there en-
tered a policeman. Some of Archibald?s old horror of the law returned to him,
although he had done no new wrong, and he was more frightened for his sister?s
sake. But his fears were unreasonable. Amy Hood could only be prosecuted
for living and she had discontinued committing that crime.
?You?re a relation of Amy Hood?s,? said the constable; ?she?s been run
over, and she died at the hospital half-an-hour ago.?
[The constable did not state what had run over her, and possibly it was a
Pantomime joke.?R.B.]
So for the second time Archibald Hood found his sister. Next day he re-
turned to the house of the receiver.
The inquest had been held, and the body of Amy Hood was part of earth.
Archibald did not know and did not trouble himself to discover the details of her
death. He heard the medical evidence and the verdict of the jury, but he did
not heed either.
His principal aim now was to find Hemming and destroy him. He never
thought of the consequences. The action had been decided on, and he said to
himself that neither God nor man should stay his hand. He claimed and re-
ceived the money deposited to his and his sister?s credit in the Federal Bank,
and after paying the funeral bills had still a comfortable sum remaining. He
made many purchases of small necessaries that once had been luxuries. One of
these necessaries was a revolver.
A few days after his sister?s death, the men living at the receiver?s house had
returned to the subject of raiding the house at Toorak, and Hood received them
with his unconditional consent to forming one of the party.
?I?m with you heart and soul,? he said. ? The respectable crowd didn?t treat my
family well when I was in trouble, and now I?ll pay them back all they gave.?
# _ *
Simpson?s house was looted successfully. Other ?plants? followed, and for
nearly six months the formidable Bouverie-street gang executed all their plans
safely and with great pecuniary benefit to themselves. The police found it im-


possible to trace stolen property farther than the receiver?s door-step. They
could safely say that it was disposed of in Bouverie-street, but they never dis-
covered anything dangerous either to the Scotchman or the ?mechanics,? who,
through this, considered themselves practically secure from arrest.
Archibald was now a cardinal in the knowledge of housebreaking, but his
? studies ? did not cause him to forget Hemming. He had searched the direc-
tories, but could not find the man he wanted. The doctor had vanished as
completely as if the earth had opened as a refuge.
But one day in the early part of December a ? scout ? brought in the
particulars of a new plant at East Melbourne. In directing them to the place he
said, ?It?s the corner after you pass Dr. Hemming?s place on the Victoria parade.?
That afternoon Archibald visited the East Melbourne side of the Parade.
There was his enemy?s house sure enough?an unpretentious residence with a
great wilderness of a garden and a brass plate bearing the inscription, ? Dr. Hy.
Hemming, Surgeon, ? on the door.
The convict determined to visit the house on the next night, and for the last
time, he thought. He told his ?pals? that he had a little business to do early in
the evening, but would return in time to accompany them on the incursion fixed
for that night. ? I?ll give you my word of honour,? he said, ? that I?ll be back
at ten o?clock,? adding with a miserable attempt at pleasantry, ?unless I?m dead.?
Accordingly, at about dusk, Archibald, having walked very quickly from Carlton,
stopped in front of Hemming?s residence. He opened the gate, and having crossed
the not inconsiderable strip of garden, stood on the low verandah. He moved
cautiously, so that he should not alarm the man whose life he had already disposed
of. He stopped in the shadow of the pepper trees, and thought of what would
occur. He would see Hemming sitting in the room and fire at his heart. He
knew the spot by sight?just under the left upper pocket in the vest. Then
Hemming would fall, and Archibald would have to make his escape, by the way
he had come.
Archibald moved to the window and met ?Disappointment. The window
was closed and masked with heavy curtains. But the strange visitor was pre-
pared for this and kindred difficulties. He took out of his pocket a small steel
instrument, and with it described a rough circle on the glass. Then he moistened
a circle of leather and fastened it to the window, tapped the pane with his
knuckles, and a small piece of glass fell into the curtains. Archibald held his
breath and crouched lower. He could feel that the occupant of the room was
looking at the place where he stood. But five minutes elapsed, and no sign was
made, and Hood noiselessly broke off the remaining fragments of the circle cut
on the window. As he did so, the sound of voices came to him. Hemming was
not alone then. Archibald pushed aside the curtain and looked into the room.
He saw his enemy lounging in an arm chair, drawn np to a pretty tea-table,
laden with home-made delicacies and sap-green tinted cresses and great, cool-
looking jugs of gaudy flowers. A little child was lying on his knees, and a
mighty handsome woman was talking to him brightly, and pouring out tea into
queer little cups, with blue and white maidens painted on the sides. Archibald
took in all these little details as the conviction forced itself into his mind that
Hemming was married. The Unstable ground his teeth together?his disgraced
sister should have occupied the place of this happy, smiling wife and mother.
He watched their happiness for some minutes. He saw how full of content and
the pride of life this respectable man, who had done a greater sin than he, cohid
be?forgetful of the girl he had driven to that awful deathin the streets. Archi-
bald Hood saw Henry Hemming playing with the child, heard Ins caressing tones
to the handsome mother, and, having noted all these things, turned almost sick
with rage. This was the statement of accounts : Archibald Hood offended
against the laws of lucre, and was shut up for four years ; Henry Hemming
seduced a love-blinded, romantic girl, and was primarily responsible for the
death of two women?his punishment was the respect of most men and all women,
and the possession of a devoted wife and child, and a place in the world daily
becoming more remunerative. This was bitterly ironical, thought the Unstable,
and to equalise matters he placed the polished barrel of the revolver in the circle
cut in the pane, and once, twice, thrice did he point the deadly tube at Hemming
through the embrasure in the window', and yet he did not fire. He showed his
principal trait?indecision?very strongly that night. At last he pulled himself
together, and again placed the revolver in position. But he stopped when his


finger was about to press the trigger. Something told him that the revolver was
pointed in the wrong direction, and by-and-bye he crept away from the window
and out of the garden. He gained the road, and walked rapidly away from the
scene of what he chose to call his failure. He had committed a crime by allow-
ing that man to live on in happiness, but then that great grey-eyed woman had
unnerved him, and the fellow was young and so on?again and again in every
key of excuses to himself.
WARNER?S ?SAFE? REMEDIES ARE A BLESSING TO
WOMEN.
Henry Hemming never knew that on that night death had breathed upon
him * and passed him by. If you visit the house, now untenanted, you

CURE.
will find a circular break, or rather, cutting, in the right-hand pane of the first
French window opening on to the eastern end of the verandah. No one knows
who cut that circle, but an astute constable, who has had the case in hand for
the last two years, has just directed suspicion to a local wit who is used to
defacing house property for a ? lark. ?? Also, Hemming, some days after
Hood's fruitless visit to the house, wrote to one of the daily papers complaining
of the wilful destruction of his property by larrikins.
WARNER?S ?SAFE? CURE, THE ONLY DIABETES SPECIFIC
Archibald walked on madly. He turned into Church-street, crossed the river
by the Studley Bridge, and wandered into the recesses of the wooded park. He
had failed in carrying out his purpose ?he had been guilty of a good action, and
he was shocked at his morality. He had undertaken the task of slaying this
man, and had allowed a mawkish pity to come between himself and a sacred
duty.
r DIABETES IS A DANGEROUS DISEASE, TREAT IT TO DAY.
And yet, although the unwritten creed of man?s honor told him that he should
have destroyed Hemming ashewoulda wild dog, the voice of the Unsleeping
Pity commended him for his victory over himself.
Well, he would make that victory complete. He had promised to join his friends
at ten o?clock that night unless he were dead, and why not the last ? He had
done enough crime?he had seen enough of that stone hell at Pentridge?his
hands were yet clean of blood, but clean they might not remain. He had given
his word, if alive, he would rob that night?he had covenanted to be a hunted
thief all his days. He saw that if he did reform, according to the canons of com-
mercial morality, that he might still be a thief, although a legalised one ; .but
such a life was not for him, and, anyhow, he could never again know happiness
nor peace.
So Hood, the Unstable, took his last look at the trees, and the tall grass, and
the placid river in front of him, and then at the moon rising calmly and
steadfastly over the iufant hills at his back, and, having seen all these things
sighed a little, raised the gleaming tube to his temple, and fired. Hb had
found nis Safe Cure, although Warner?s would have secured him a more
CONSCIOUS HAPPINESS WHILE RETAINING HIS LIFE. EVEN MORAL WEAKNESS
ARISES MORE FROM A DISEASED STATE OF THE LIVER THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
andif Archibald Hood had used Warner?s, the Great Curative of three
Continents, he might have lived an innocent existence and died
OF NOTHING BUT PEREMPTORY OLD AGE.

Bulletin.
? The Bulletin ? has the Largest and Most Universal Circulation.
The BULLETIN, which is the only paper sold by runners in the streets of everjr
Australasian capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers published South of the
Equator, and is the only Australasian publication which enjoys a popularity un-
hampered by the political boundaries that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin?s red cover is equally familiar to the bushman of the Far North,
the stockman of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres Straits, and the digger
in the New Zealand ranges. A paper which is at once the most popular city pub-
lication and the organ of the intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based. L.'
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin?s popularity is found in the un-
changeable fact?easity ascertainable from any postal official?that, of all journals
issued in Australasia, The Bulletin is the one most frequently remailed from one
reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Australian publications, is most fre-
quently quoted in England, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any other paper, because its vast mass
oforignal and specially-written reading matter is the brightest and test, its illustra-
tions the cleverest and most artistic, and its policy the boldest and most straight-
forward ever submitted to the Australian public.
