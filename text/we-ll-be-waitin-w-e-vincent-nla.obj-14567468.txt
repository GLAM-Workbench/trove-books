WITH
MURDOCH’S IN PARK ST. LTD.
COMPLIMENTS


We’ll be waitin’, we’ll be watchin’ for the news that’s cornin’ thro’
Of the Boys who hold the honor of our White Starred Flag-o’-Blue ;
For that sturdy troop of ’Stralians is our Regiment o’ Men,
That is fightin’ for an Empire, as a Cub of Leo’s Den.
We know that old traditions are treasured in the heart,
%
Of each unit of that little band as plays a soldier’s part ;
And we’ll be waitin’ and be watchin’ for the news that’s cornin’ thro’
Of how they helped the “ Old Flag,” with hearts to Britain true.
Our prayers will be for glory to this sturdy, valiant band,
Which bears the arms of ’Stralia for the honor of “ Our Land”;
And may the message flashin’ over ’midst the boomin’ o’ the Guns,
Tell the glory of the Empire, of Australia and her Sons.

WE’LL BE WAITIN’


We'll be waitin’, we’ll be watchin’ for the news that's cornin’ thro’
Of the Sea-Sons of “ Australia”; as she ploughs the waters blue ;
Who man our “ First-born” Battleship, with fullest pride o’ race,
Descended of the Heroes who made Empire’s Power and Place.
We know that old traditions stir the souls of Boys o’ Blue,
)
And when the Guns are rattlin’ their hearts are ringin’ true;
So we’ll be waitin’ and be watchin’ for the news that’s cornin’ thro’
Of how they did their duty for their White Starred Flag-o’-Blue.
Cur prayers will be “ God bless ’em,” those sturdy sailor chaps,
On whose heart is written “ Empire,” though “ Australia's” on
their caps,
And may the message wingin’ over, ’midst the boomin’ o’ the Guns,
Tell the splendor of our Flagship for the Empire and her Sons.
