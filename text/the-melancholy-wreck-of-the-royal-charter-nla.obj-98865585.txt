THE IELMCHOLY WRECK OF
TIE ROYAL CHARTER,
On her homeward bound passage from Melbourne to Liverpool, on the 25th
October, 1859 ; having on board 498 Passengers and Crew, of which
number 46 9 men, women, and children, met with a watery grave.
You landsmen and you seamen all,
I pray you lend an ear,
To a sad and dismal story,
I mean to let you hear.
Tis the wreck of the Royal Charter,
So appaling to relate,
On the 25th October,
She met a dreadful fate.
The Royal Charter steam-ship,
Was built of iron strong,
1 o Messrs. Gibb & Bright, of Liverpool,
The vessel did belong.
Commanded by Captain Taylor,
A seaman bold and brave,
He respected was by all on board,
While crossing o’er the wave.
On the 26th of August last,
From Melbourne she did sail,
With 498 souls on board,
With a sweet and pleasant gale.
To see their native homes once more,
Many hearts did leap with joy,
But, alas, four hundred and sixty-nine.
In their watery grave do lie.
On the 25th of October,
A dreadful stornj did rise,
The wind it blew a hurricane,
No star peeped through the skies,
Brave Captain Taylof done the best
That human skill could do,
To try and save the gallant ship,
The passengers and crew.
The ill-fated Royal Charter,
Against the rocks was dashed,
And lying broadside to the waves,
Was soon to pieces smashed.
The cries did rend the air,
While the waves and wind did roar,
But 400 and sixty-nine there sunk,
Alas, to rise no more.
On board of the Royal Charter was
John Lewis, a seaman bold—
His aged father on the beech
That night he did behold.
Oh, f ther, dearest father,
This young man he did cry,
Your only son he has come back,
This fatal night to die'.
Mr. Robert Bruce, from Greenock,
And Andrew Cowie of Girvan town,
With John Buchanan of Glasgow,
And Hugh Bethune, all were drowned.
Mr and Mrs Murray, from Edinburgh,
With their sons and daughters bright,
Were lost in the Royal Charter, °
On that most dreadful night.
O’er the cheeks of aged parents,
'I he tears are seen to flow,
While lovers and relations are,
In sorrow, griei, and woe ;
For the fate of those they held so dear,
While crossing o’er the deep,
Who were lost in the Royal Charter,
And now in death does sleep.
