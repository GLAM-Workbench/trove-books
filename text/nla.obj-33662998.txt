Report of Assistant Health Officer,
S.S. ? Ghmga.??Suspicious case.
There is a coloured man named Soani on board suffering from a vesicular eruption resembling varicella?
aet. 25. He presents good vaccination marks. He has been six weeks in Fiji, before which time he had
been, at Wellington and Tonga There is not, to the Captain?s knowledge, any case of small-pox there
(at any of these places). The vesicles are well formed, and in some places present well-marked umbilioation.
They are all in the vesicular stage. He is a servant of Sir Arthur Gordon, and has had rigors, head-ache,
and the other symptoms and signs of invasion of variola, excepting the back-ache. I withhold my positive
diagnosis until in consultation with another medical man ; meantime, I consider the case of sufficient gravity
to detain the ship (till further instructed) in Watson?s Bay. I have ordered the yellow flag to be raised,
and interdicted all communication with the vessel.

Sir, 26 August, 1882, 9-25 p.m.
I have the honor to report to you, for information of the Government, that after I had gone
alongside and examined two sailing-vessels at noon to-day, 1 followed. ? Gunga? s.s. to her moorings
at Quarantine Station, and whilst there superintending debarking of passengers and giving instructions
regarding their disposal in the cabin enclosure and the healthy ground, I received your telegram instructing
me to have patient suffering from small-pox put in ? Gunga? boat and towed to Rose Bay, to be conveyed
from thence to Little Bay for treatment. I was about to obey, when Sir Arthur Gordon and Major
Knollys represented that this man would in all probability die if sent away by himself. I then hesitated
till I received further instructions from you, having wired the representation, &c., referred to, and waited for
reply till 8 o?clock p.m., meantime making all arrangements for the comfort and accommodation of the
people. I then went on board ? Gunga? and again examined patient, with following result: ?Temperature,
102-4; pulse, 97 ; other symptoms and signs remaining as you saw this morning when we examined him
together. As I thought it better not to allow the patient to remain on board with several other persons, I
came to you to inquire what you desire in the case. Major Knollys has expressed a desire to be allowed
to remain with the patient wherever you decide to have him placed.

blankets, in which the patient was rolled, have been destroyed. Major Knollys came with the patient, and has been
provided with a room in my quarters.
The Health Officer?s notes on the condition of the patient after a personal visit and examination of him
on board the ?Gunga,? on the 26th August, 1882, at 11 a.m.
Notes of the case of His Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon?s Fijian servant, a passenger by s.s. ? Gunga.?
After headache, pains in the loins and down the legs, and rigors, an eruption of pimples appeared on the face and neck,
particularly the forehead. It is now general, but sparse on the trunk. On the wrists and on the shoulders somewhat
shotty and papular, but on the chest more vesicular. Vesicles on being punctured do not collapse without pressure, and
when pressed a somewhat glairy and opalescent liquid escapes. Eruption marked on the soft palate by five or six-- papular
spots, and the throat sore and red, apparently from the same cause. Temperature, 102'2 Pah. Pulse,
The patient has two well-marked vaccination scars.
In my opinion the case is one of small-pox, modified by previous vaccination.
26th August, 1882. C.K.M.
The Assistant Health Officer?s further Report on the case of the Patient.
Sir, Watson?s Bay, 28 August, 1882.
I have the honor to submit to you, for the information of the Government, an immediate provisional and
abridged report of a case of variola discreta, occurring on board s.s. ? Gunga,? which sailed from Fiji on 19th instant, and
entered Sydney Heads at 6'30 a.m. on 26th instant.
I reached alongside ?Gunga? of! Middle Head, and Captain C. Saunders, in reply to my usual question if all were
well en board, replied ?Yes, but there?s one man in the saloon with a little rash upon him.?
I at once proceeded to the saloon to examine the patient, whom I brought forward to the light, as it was then about
daybreak and the light in the cabin was not clear.
He is a coloured man, a native of Fiji, named Suani, of stout build, well formed and intelligent, his age 25, and he
is labouring under a febrile eruptive disease.
It is a uniform eruption in the vesicular stage, which somewhat resembles that variety of chicken-pock known as
varicella coni/ormis, but which taken in connection with extensive implication of the mucous membrane of the pharynx,
upon which I discovered several distinct and well-defined vesicles, and also in association with grave constitutional symp-
toms present, viz,, back-ache ( rachialgia ), vomiting, frontal head-ache, high temperature, rigors, furred tongue and foetid
breath, and his dull and stupid aspect, I have been led to the diagnosis of the case as one of variola discreta.
I cannot now enumerate all the more important diagnostic appearances which led me to decide as to the nature of
the case.
His temperature was, at the time of your examination, at 11 o?clock a.m., 102'2 Fah., and it was 102'4 when I
examined him the same evening.
He gives a distinct account of rigors, but now denies having vomited, and complains of sore throat (dysphagia) and
severe pain in the lumbar region.
Having had this patient in view for the space of one whole day, during which I made three minute and most cautious
examinations of him, I cannot hesitate to express my firm conviction that it is an unmistakable and manifest case of modified
small-pox.
This diagnosis I submit without fear of contradiction, notwithstanding assertions to the contrary made by
unprofessional and defective observers ; the difficulty of assigning a cause of contagion or infection, and the stated brevity
of the pre-eruptive period, or the time elapsing from the rigors, malaise, back-ache, &c., and the appearance of eruption
upon the face.
I have not the least hesitation in pronouncing upon the case, and am prepared to accept the full responsibility of
committing myself so positively.
I am pleased that, without my having expressed myself on the subject to you or made known to you ray opinion,
you yourself formed a similar diagnosis, in which I unreservedly acquiesce.
You have made known to the Government the measures we adopted for the strict quarantine of vessel ? Gunga?)
and passengers, and for the present I hope this brief report may suffice.
I have, since ?Gunga? anchored oil - North Head, visited the station at least twice daily.
I have, &e.,

The Assistant Health Officer to The Health Officer, Sydney,
Sir, On board barque ? Kenmore,? Port Jackson, 1 September, 1882, 12-10 p.m.
I have the honor to report immediately to you, for the information of the Government, that I
paid my accustomed morning visit to the Quarantine Station, North Head, about two hours since, and was
informed by Dr. Day, the medical officer in charge, that he had isolated two males (firemen of s.s. ? Gunga?)
in a house upon the healthy ground, as they had developed chicken-pocks. I accompanied Dr. Day to where
these men were located, and with his leave and in his presence examined them. They were both stript
naked.
I affirm unhesitatingly, and beg to emphasise such affirmation most positively, that there is not at
present any case of developed varicella at North Head Quarantine Station; that neither of the cases stated
is one of chicken-pock ; that neither man could be suffering from this disease yesterday, and this morning
present not the least symptom or sign or any anatomical evidence of the existence of such exanthem.
I challenge contradiction in this matter, and deem myself bound to repeat the statement that there
is not at present oiys case of chicken-pock on the Quarantine Station. The fact (if it were true) that two
fellow-passengers of the man Soani in s.s. ?Gunga,? developed chicken-pock at the same time that this
patient was labouring under an eruptive fever, supposed by many to be the same disease, would tend to
confirm the notion that Soani was suffering from chicken-pock also?a conclusion I am prepared to
satisfactorily disprove. It is for this reason I feel constrained to deny the statement that those
two men are suffering from chicken-pock To negative which assumption, it is only necessary for yourself or
another medical officer to personally examine with as little delay as possible the two men. I am, as you


may suppose, anxious to be able to remove an existing erroneous impression as to the non-variolous character
of the eruptive fever from which the Fijian at Little Bay is at present suffering, which impression would
be encouraged (though by no means made correct) if varicella broke out at North Head now.
1. One man named W. H. Barrett, aged about 25, presenting on left arm two well-defined vaccina-
tion cicatrices, complains that about four days ago he suffered from head-ache, nausea, vomiting, and back-
ache, but that this back-ache he has had ? on and off? for a long time, and attributes it to the nature of his
work on board ship (stoker). He has had no rigor or shivering fit, and all these subjective and objective
symptoms have disappeared. There is not a single spot of eruption upon his body, but over the femoral regions
are scattered rather thickly the evidences of acne punctata. These spots he declares to have been there
?always? (he means for a very long time). The well-known eruption of acne is present upon his forehead,
has not been increased lately, and but one ? pimple? which has suppurated and scabbed, could be considered
as at all suspicious, remembering this man?s contiguity to a small-pox patient. I believe, in the absence of
repeated examinations and the corroborative aid of clinical thermometric investigation, etc., that this man is
suffering from that variety of acne so usual in young male adults, and to be in part expected from his
employment as stoker. If I could have discovered one or two well-marked vesicles or pustules, I should be
inclined, from the constitutional symptoms, to regard the case as one of modified small-pox of mild type. It
most decidedly is not varicella.
2. David Cochrane, a low-sized muscular man, about 28, has not complained of any symptoms or sign
whatever, but there is a roseolar eruption of irregular sized and variously shaped spots engaging the
middle third of the anterior aspect of the thighs only. Both men state that they have been subject to these
eruptions for a long time. I have, <tc.,

Sir, Quarantine Station, North Head, 2 September, 1882.
In obedience to your instructions, I have the honor to report more fully upon the two firemen
of the ? Gunga,? whom I telegraphed to you as suffering from varicella, and had isolated.
On Wednesday, 6 p.m., I was requested to visit a fireman named William Barrett, aged twenty-
three, residing on the healthy ground.
The appearances were a few vesicular eruptions on the forehead ; no eruption appeared upon the
face, neck, or abdomen, but freely exhibited upon the anterior part of both thighs?with a few vesicular
eruptions. The constitutional symptoms were, two or three days after the eruption first appeared?slight
head-ache, vomited once, also complained of slight pain in lumbar region?tongue furred but moist.
For many reasons, notwithstanding the suspicious symptoms mentioned, I arrived at the conclusion
that it was a mild case of varicella. lam informed by those in whom I can place confidence, that many of
the symptoms he complained of were put on for the sake of leaving the ship and having a holiday. On
Thursday I administered a brisk purgative, which acted copiously, and on Thursday evening he stated that he
felt all right; on Friday morning there were only a few marks where the vesicles had burst, the eruption
on the thighs had almost disappeared, and he expressed himself as thoroughly well, and requested permission
to take exercise. This morning, Saturday, I visited him at 8 o?clock, and can report him as in good health.
The other fireman, David Cochrane, I first saw on Thursday evening; complained of not being well,
bowels constipated, with foul tongue ; had a peculiar eruption upon the anterior and upper third of both
thighs, having some resemblance to acne; from his statement he had had on several occasions a similar
eruption, attributable, he states, to the sudden variation of temperature to which he is exposed from his
occupation. lam informed that nearly all firemen suffer more or less in a similar manner.
Both patients at 8 o?clock this morning are perfectly well as regards health. I have nevertheless not
allowed them to leave the room or mix with the other residents on the ground.
I have, <fec.,
HENRY DAY.
Having carefully considered these reports, I am led to the conclusion that Barrett and Cochrane,
who are impressed with the idea that they are to bo immediately sent again to sea in the ? Gunga,? are
malingering, I cannot conceive it to be possible for an eruption of chicken-pox to come out upon the face,
pass through all its stages, and disappear in thirty-six hours, leaving not a trace behind. The chronic
eruption upon the thighs evidently bears no resemblance to chicken-pox.?C. K. M.

Sir, 4 September, 1882.
I have the honor to state that I this morning paid my accustomed visit to the Quarantine
Station, North Head, where I found everything proceeding satisfactorily.
I have to call your attention to the fact that the passengers of the fore-cabin complain of the quality
of provisions, especially the bread, which they state is too stale to eat. They also complain of want of
soap and an insufficient supply of tobacco. Mr. Hawkins wishes to know if he is to supply the deficiency,
keeping an account of course of the articles supplied from store, to be forwarded to you when required.
These people should have a plentiful supply of soap, and I told Hawkins to see that they did not need
cleansing materials whilst on the Station.
I have also to state that, on hearing that the five sheep which had been brought ashore from s.s.
? Gunga,? and which animals I had given instructions to have well washed with soap and water, could not
be caught and were straying about, I told Mr. Hawkins to have them secured by assistance of our staff
on the Station, and that they should be all killed and may be used for food, their skins to be burnt in the
usual manner. I think this a very necessary measure, as if those sheep got over to Manly or elsewhere
there would certainly be noise about it. Moreover they may be affected with scab or some other disease,
and infect flocks in the district. I hope my instructions in this matter will meet your approval.
I am trying to make up my books, so as to forward to you the back forms of Health Officer?s report

The Australasian Steam Navigation Co. to The Health Officer, Sydney.
Sir, Australasian Steam Navigation Company, Sydney, 5 September, 1882.
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you
transmit a report furnished by the Superintendent at the Quarantine Station, as to complaints made by the
fore-cabin passengers (ex ? Gunga?) in reference to provisions supplied to them. In reply, I beg to say that
fresh bread is sent down every alternate day, and we therefore fail to see how it can be too stale to eat.
With respect to the supply of tobacco, I beg to say that a quantity was sent down last week, and the
passengers were at liberty to obtain as much as they chose by paying for it, tobacco not being supplied
free to any passenger. With respect to soap, I have to say that a further supply will be sent down either
to-day or to-morrow. Trusting the foregoing explanation will prove satisfactory,?

Extract from Minutes of the Board of Health, at their meeting of 6th September,
1882.
A letter from Dr. W. McGregor (Chief Medical Officer of Fiji), of the 4th instant, making application to be
allowed to visit and examine the patient Soani (ex s.s. ? Gunga?), at the Coast Hospital, Little Bay, having
been read, it was resolved :
? The Board of Health having deliberated on Dr. W. McGregor?s letter requesting permission to visit
Soani supposed to be suffering from small-pox, recommend that his request be not granted.
When the ? Gunga? arrived from Fiji, the Board took into their most careful consideration
the reports of the Health Officer and Assistant Health Officer respecting the case of Soani,
and they found that the patient presented so many signs and symptoms pointing to modified
small-pox, that they deemed it their duty, in the interests of the population of New South
Wales, to recommend the Government to treat the case as one of small-pox ; nor do they see
reason to alter their already expressed opinion. The length of time that has elapsed renders
it, in the opinion of the Board, impossible for any medical man, however accomplished, at
this stage to establish a satisfactory differential diagnosis. They therefore fail to see that
any good result would arise from such a breach of the law as would be involved in granting
Dr. McGregor?s request.?
A letter from the Private Secretary to Sir Arthur Gordon, enclosing a memo, from His Excellency
which he desired to be read to the Board, was laid before the Board. This memo, urged upon the
Board the propriety?for reasons stated therein?of releasing the passengers quarantined ex ? Gunga? at
the expiry of twelve days from the first day of their seclusion. After deliberation it was resolved ;
? That as a matter of courtesy the memo, might be read, but that it could not be permitted to
influence the Board in its dealings with an important matter, which was above individual
considerations, and concerned the health of the whole community. The Board is unable to
recommend any shortening of the fixed term of quarantine.?
A letter from Dr. W. McGregor, of the 6th instant, enclosing sworn statements from Captain
Saunders and Mr. Hector Kidd, and a solemn declaration from His Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon having
been read, it was resolved?
? The Board recommend that Dr. W. McGregor?s letter of the 6th instant be acknowledged, and
that the writer be informed that the sworn statements enclosed therein, which appear to
reflect upon Dr. Beattie in his official capacity, be forwarded to that gentleman for
explanation.?
[Enclosures.']
Dr. William McGregor, C.M.G., Chief Medical Officer of Fiji, to The Colonial Secretary.
Sir, Australian Club, Sydney, 4 September, 1882.
You may perhaps be aware that the s.s. ?Gunga? on her last arrival from Fiji was put in quarantine on
account of an alleged case of small-pox on board that vessel ; and when I point out to you my connection with Fiji, the
serious results that may arise to that Colony in this and other Australasian porta in connection with the above case, and the
strong reasons that exist for doubting that the case is one of small-pox, I trust that you will pardon my addressing you on
the subject, and that you will grant me the request that I have the honour to make, that I may be permitted to visit and
examine the man said to suffer from small-pox.
2. For more than seven years I have been, and still am, chief medical officer for Fiji. I had proceeded as far as
Melbourne by the s.s. ? Rome ? on my way to England on leave of absence when I heard of this case of alleged small-pox
from Fiji, and I deemed it my duty to discontinue my voyage and return here, in order to ascertain whether the case is one
of small-pox or not, as on the former supposition my duty would be to return to Fiji as soon as possible.
3. In the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday last, it is stated in a paragraph that unquestionably reads as if based
on official authority, that there is no reason to doubt that the case is one of genuine small-pox. If that dogmatic statement
is allowed to go forth to the world without qualification or contradiction, it can hardly be supposed but that vessels coming
from Fiji to Sydney, and the regular steam traders from that Colony to New Zealand and Victoria, will be subjected with-
out fail to processes of disinfection, and probably to tedious quarantine, which will result in much loss to Fijian shippers of
perishable goods, and in great inconvenience and expense to passengers.
4. An impartial consideration of the following points will, I venture to think, be sufficient to show that there must
exist grave doubt that the case is one of small-pox.
(a.) For more than a year previous to proceeding last to Fiji, the patient, a man of the native race of that country,
named Soani, resided in New Zealand. About two months ago he went to Fiji in H.M.S. ? Miranda,? by way of Tonga,
and by the last voyage of the ?Gunga ? arrived here from that Colony. There had not been any case of small-pox on the
?Miranda,? at Tonga, nor at Fiji. But as Soani had been about six weeks in Fiji and the eruption on his skin appeared
about from four to six days after he left that country, it follows that if Soani suffers from small-pox he must have con-
tracted the disease in Fiji, where there has never, so far as is known, been small-pox ashore, and only some three or four
mild cases on board ship in quarantine more than three years ago.
(6.) Chicken-pox, a disease that in some respects often similates modified small-pox, is very common in Fiji. Soani
never before had chicken-pox, but the night before he left Levuka he slept with a man who was then covered by the
eruption of that disease.
(e.) The eruption on Soani was recognised by himself as that of chicken-pox; it was also identified by Major
Knollys, who has seen some thirty or forty cases of the disease among the armed native constabulary of Fiji when stationed
at such distance from a medical officer, that Major Knollys had himself to observe and treat all cases of sickness. lam
told on reliable authority that Dr. Beattie on examining Soani on his arrival in port here, said, that the case was one of
chicken-pox, and added that the ? Gunga ? would be alongside the wharf in less than three hours.
( d) Soani?s illness has run, as far as I can learn, the normal and ordinary course of a case of chicken-pox.
(e) I believe that the medical officer under whose care Soani now is has not pronounced the case to be one of small-
pox ; but has confined himself to saying that the eruption ? most resembles? modified small-pox.
5. As an experience of ten years duration has familiarised me with the appearances of cutaneous eruptions on
coloured people, and as I have seen and treated some hundreds of cases of chicken-pox in Fijians and other Polynesians, I
should, were I permitted to examine Soani, probably be able to satisfy myself whether the disease is small-pox or chicken-
pox ; and my opinion would probably have some influence with the Health Officers of Melbourne and Auckland, and
enable them, without attaching undue weight to the statement in the Sydney Morning Herald referred to above, to deter-
mine what steps should be taken with reference to steam vessels arriving from Fiji in those ports, if the expression of my
opinion could not induce the authorities here to reconsider the whole case, which must, now that its history has been
elicited and its course watched, present itself in a somewhat different light from that in which it was first dealt with.
6.


6. In requesting permission to visit Soani, I may state that I have been exposed to the contagion of small-pox
during a long extended epidemic in which I treated many patients without contracting the disease myself; and I was
recently successfully vaccinated.
7. In conclusion, I may state that had the case of Soani been regarded as a doubtful case instead of being publicly
stated to be an absolute case of small-pox, I should not then have occupied your time by this communication, as so long as
the case was regarded as doubtful, vessels arriving from Fiji in other Australasian ports would have been dealt with each on
its own merits, a result hardly to be looked for in the face of the absolute decision that appears to have been arrived at
here in the case of Soani, a decision that is tantamount to saying that there is small-pox in Fiji.

Chief Medical Officer, Fiji.

Sir Arthur Gordon?s Memo, enclosed in the above Letter.
I believe that all those now detained here fully recognize the utility and importance of quarantine and the necessity for
its rigid enforcement, if it be enforced at all.
We are not, therefore, at all disposed to question the propriety of our having been, in the first instance, placed in
quarantine, if even only a suspicion existed that our admission to pratique might be the means of introducing small-pox
to Sydney.
Bnt our prolonged detention gives rise to no little dissatisfaction for, on the one hand, we are unable to feel
convinced that the eruptive disorder which has appeared on Sir A. Gordon?s servant is indeed small-pox ; while, on the
other, we perceive that the restrictions to which we are subjected while vexatious and injurious in the highest degree to
the pecuniary and other interests of many of our party, are quite inadequate for protective purposes if protection be
required.
We cannot feel convinced that the illness (if it can be so called) of Sir A. Gordon?s servant is small-pox, for the
following reasons :
1. Small-pox doesnot exist in Fiji, where the patient had been for six weeksbefore embarking in the ?Gunga,? and
where he must have caught the disease, if suffering from it at all, there not having been time for its
developement on board the ?Gunga.? There is probably no country where quarantine is mere rigidly
enforced than in Fiji.
2. The patient did not suffer from the ordinary symptoms of small-pox?vomiting, vertigo, and pains in the back.
He has never vomited at all since leaving Fiji; he has had headache, but no giddiness, and the slight pain in
the side which he felt was easily accounted for.
3. The illness has been slight in character, and short in duration. He was slightly ailing on Thursday. The
spots appeared on Friday. A quarter of them had disappeared on Monday, and his general health, appetite,
&c., have never been seriously affected. On the morning on which the ?Gunga? was put in quarantine he
had done his usual work in brushing Sir A. Gordon?s clothes, waiting on him, &c.
4. Although up to the day the ? Gunga? was placed in quarantine he had daily handled the clothes of two of the
passengers, and played with the children on board, some of whom were unvaccinatcd, no person in the
station has as yet shown signs of even premonitory illness.
5. An eruptive disease presenting no little resemblance in its early stages to small-pox is endemic in Fiji.
6. This disease known as sui sui is essentially similar to chicken-pox.
7. Though the disease is very common in Fiji, the patient had not previously suffered from It.
8. The night before he left Fiji the patient slept in the house of a man whose brother, in the house at the time,
was then suffering from this disease.
9. The complaint was at once recognized by the patient himself and by many old residents in Fiji on board the
? Gunga ? as sui mi.
10. The patient?s prediction as to his speedy recovery has been verified.
11. The medical officer?s opinion that the case (if one of small-pox), would get ? worse and worse for some days?
has not been verified.
12. The disease has run through the normal course of a case of varicella or chicken-pox.
13. The Fijian disease in question was probably wholly new to the Medical Officers, and it is no reflection on
them that it should at first sight be taken for small-pox, for though most closely resembling chicken-pox, its
early symptoms have more than once been taken even by experienced medical men for those of variola.
14. It is admittedly difficult to distinguish at once at some stages between small-pox and chicken-pox, and the
one examination of the Health Officer was so cursory as to seem hardly to afford a conclusive test. How
uncertain indeed the symptoms must be may be judged from the fact that the Assistant Health Officer on
boarding the ?Gunga? wrote on the health report that they were those of ?a mild case of chicken-pox,?
and told the passengers that their detention would not last many hours.
On the second cause for dissatisfaction it would, without absolute necessity, be invidious to enlarge. We have no
desire to find fault but to obtain our own release, but we repeat that we are in a position to show that the quarantine here
enforced is not such as to ensure protection from small-pox to the City of Sydney.
We believe that it is usual for small-pox to pass into its eruptive stage about twelve days from the commencement
of the disease, and in some countries, as for instance New Zealand, that period is the limit of quarantine. Without dis-
puting the greater safety of a longer detention, we would venture to submit whether the case being we think it must be
admitted, one of doubt, if at the end of twelve days from our seclusion, no one of our whole company, amounting to
nearly a hundred persons and including unvaceinated children, shows any signs of even the premonitory symptoms of
small-pox (and up to the present time we are all in perfect health), we may have the benefit of the doubt, and be released
from a detention which is seriously affecting the interests and prospects of many of our number.
We may add that Dr. McGregor, C.M.6., the Chief Medical Officer of Fiji, who is intimately acquainted with the
Fijian disease in question, Is now in Sydney and would probably give valuable information as to its character.

Sir, Australian Club, Sydney, 6 September, 1882.
With reference to my letter of yesterday regarding the case of the Fijian native Soani, I have now the honor
to forward sworn affidavits made by Captain Saunders and Mr. Hector Kidd, and a solemn declaration by Sir Arthur
Gordon, which prove that the unprejudiced and independent opinion of Dr. Beattie was that Soani?s illness was chicken-
pox. A reference to Dr. Beattie?s written report on the third page of the Health Report, signed by Captain Saunders, will
give Dr. Beattie?s opinion in his own words.*
2. Dr. Beattie?s independent judgment on the case cannot but command the greatest respect, more especially so if he
was, as lam told he was, Physician to the Small-pox Hospital. Dr. Beattie?s own opinion, which was, I believe, formed
almost solely on the objective phenomena?presented by the patient, has been supported in the strongest manner by the
history of the case as subsequently elicited, and is in strict harmony with the course run by the disease.

I, Hector Kidd, make oath and say that, on Saturday, the twenty-sixth day of August last, I was a passenger on board the
screw steam-ship ? Gunga?; about 7 a.m. I went to the table in the saloon to write a telegram; the Assistant Health Officer,
Dr. Beattie, was sitting on the opposite side of the table, and Captain Saunders standing at his left side ; Dr. Beattie was
sitting exactly opposite me, writing something on a sheet of foolscap paper, and used the same ink bottle as myself ; when
he had done writing he read aloud to Captain Saunders what he had written; I heard what he read ; it was a report with
respect to the sickness of a native on board, on whose person an eruption had appeared, the symptoms of which were
described by Dr. B. as those of ?a mild case of chicken-pox? ; I remember these words particularly, as I was paying great
attention to what was read ; I afterwards asked Dr. Beattie how long we should be detained ; he repeatedly said that we
should be released so soon as he had communicated with the Health Office ; I overheard Dr. Beattie in conversation with
Captain Saunders at the saloon door; I heard him say that he was very sorry to detain us at all, but that it was of no
consequence as we should be alongside the wharf by ten or eleven o?clock.

I, Charles Edward Saunders, make oath and say that, on Saturday the twenty-sixth day of August last, I was in com-
mand of the screw steam-ship ? Gunga,? which that morning entered Sydney Harbour, and was about seven o?clock a.m.
boarded by the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie. Dr. Beattie filled up the answers to the questions in the Health
Report from my dictation, and I then signed it on the second page. Dr. Beattie then wrote on the third page a report of
his own, with respect to a case of slight sickness on board, of which I had informed him, and which he had inspected.
After he had finished writing, he read aloud to me what he had written. The report he read stated the symptoms of the
illness to be those of ? a mild case of chicken-pox,? but that he hesitated to give pratique to the vessel until the case had
been referred to superior authority. On leaving the saloon, I asked Dr. Beattie how long we were likely to be detained ?
He replied, only an hour or two, as the case was only one of chicken-pox, but that as he was only Assistant Health Officer, he
was unwilling himself to assume the responsibility of admitting us to pratique.

Taken - and sworn before me, this fifth day of September, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and

(1.5.) ARTHUR GORDON,
H.M. High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.
I, the Honorable Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon, G.C.M.G., do hereby solemnly declare that, on Saturday the twenty-
sixth day of August last, I was a passenger in the screw steamship ? ? Gunga?; we were boarded at the entrance of Sydney
Harbour by the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie ; soon afterwards I went into the saloon, Dr. Beattie was writing some-
thing at the table ; I saw that he was writing on the third page of a sheet of foolscap paper ; I left the saloon again, almost
immediately, after speaking to Major Knollys, who was in his cabin opening out of it. When Dr. Beattie came out of the
saloon he was introduced to me, and told me that my servant was apparently suffering from an attack of chicken-pox,
but that as he was not familiar with native patients, or the appearance of eruptive diseases on the skin of a native, he did
not like to take on himself the responsibility of admitting us to pratique, without reference to the Health Officer ; I was
Earticularly struck by one expression which he used, and of which I at once took mental note, to the effect that had the patient
een a white man, he would at once have admitted us to pratique, but that he had no experience of natives. He added
that he did not suppose our detention would exceed two or three hours, and 'would almost certainly terminate when his
report was considered, making light altogether of the apprehensions I expressed, that those not familiar with Fijian
eruptive diseases, might be led to take a more serious view of the case. After our arrival at the Quarantine Station on the
afternoon of the same day (after the case had been officially declared small-pox). Dr. Beattie informed me he thought it
probable we should be released the following day, or Monday; I replied ?If it in any way depends on you, pray let
it be to-morrow, as we shall then still be able to catch the ? Rome.?
I did not myself read Dr. Beattie?s report, but its contents were mentioned to me before he left the vessel; and on
my reminding him of its terms on Tuesday morning last, in the presence of Dr. Day and Captain Saunders, he fully
admitted that it was to the effect stated. ,

Sir, Sydney, 6 September, 1882.
I observe in the Sydney Morning Herald of this date that you last night informed Parliament,
in reference to an alleged case of small-pox that arrived recently in this Colony from Fiji, that ? The
Health Officer of Fiji, to whom the papers had been submitted, had stated that no other course was open
to the Government than to place the sufferer in quarantine.? In connection therewith, I have the honor
to inform you that it is true that I at one stage of the case expressed that opinion, founded on the data
then put before me, which left a doubt on my mind whether it was one of chicken-pox or small-pox. But
the paper that appears to be the most important in the whole case was not submitted to me, nor was its
purport communicated to me. The document to which I refer is the written report of Dr. Beattie,
containing his free and independent opinion of the illness in question which he pronounced to be a ? mild
case of chicken-pox,? an opinion that I share, based on all the circumstances of the case within my
knowledge.* I have, <tc.,

I have the honor, by direction of the Colonial Treasurer, to acknowledge receipt of your letter of-
the 6th instant, in which you confirm a statement made by Mr. Watson in the Legislative Assembly on the
sth instant, to the effect ?that the Health Officer at Fiji, to whom the papers had been submitted, had
stated that no other course was open to the Government than to place the sufferer (Soani) in quarantine.?
But you add, that ?at one stage of the case you expressed that opinion founded on the data then
put before you, which left a doubt on your mind whether it was one of chicken-pox or small-pox.? You
also say ? that the most important paper in the whole case was not submitted, nor its purport communicated
to you, the paper referred to being the written report of Dr. Beattie, containing his free and independent
opinion of the illness in question, which he pronounced to be a mild case of chicken-pox.?
* See this report on page 3.


I am to point out to you that a certified copy of Dr. Beattie?s official report, dated 26th ultimo, was
forwarded to you on the 7th instant, and in no part of that report is it stated that the case in question is a
?mild case of chicken-pox.? On the contrary, after reporting that the case resembles varicella, Dr. Beattie
proceeds to observe, ? that the patient had rigors, headache, and the other symptoms and signs of invasion
of variola , excepting the backache, Ac.?
With the later information thus supplied to you, and which was not in your possession at the time
of your writing the letter now under reply, Mr. Watson trusts that you will see fit to withdraw the limitation
which you seem desirous of attaching to your admission to the Health Officer, that the course taken by the
Government in placing Soani in quarantine was the correct one.

Dr. William McGregor, 0.M.G., Chief Medical Officer, Fiji, to The Colonial Treasurer.
Sir, , Australian Club, Sydney, 7 September, 1882.
In continuation of previous correspondence on the alleged illness of the Fijian, Soani, from
small-pox, I now do myself the honor to put before you another branch of his case, which is of great value
as evidence against the assertion that he suffered from small-pox. The evidence that I now have the honor
to advance gains in strength by the lapse of time, and for that reason was not brought forward in my first
letter on this subject.
2. Given an alleged case of a highly contagious disease in the midst of a large community, the spread
of the disease, unless intelligent precautions are taken to prevent its dissemination, is the natural order of
events. About fourteen days have now elapsed since the eruption appeared on Soani?s skin; and from
then until now, no other case of actual or presumptive small-pox has been reported either at the quarantine
station or in Sydney. The answer to this by one maintaining that Soani suffered from small-pox, or pro-
bably by any person that has not witnessed the course of the quarantine on this occasion, would be that
the spread of the disease was prevented by the precautions taken against- it.
3. It not infrequently happens that by those inexperienced in quarantine practice, quarantine is
supposed to consist in washing or smoking the decks and accessible parts of a ship, or in the detention of a
vessel?s crew and passengers ; but the detention of crew and passengers without isolation is not quarantine,
as it offers no protection against the transmission of disease, although it may help to lull a community into
false security.
4. In the present case, as my object is simply to show that had Soani suffered from small-pox the
disease would almost certainly have been spread, it is neither necessary nor desirable that I should analyse the
whole system of quarantine carried out on this occasion, for it will be sufficient for my purpose to give only
a few examples, showing what the general nature of the quarantine has been, and how far isolation, the
very essence of quarantine, has been lost sight of.
5. Soani was examined in the first instance by Dr. Beattie. At that time the eruption on his skin
was well developed. Dr. Beattie, immediately after his examination, proceeded to Sydney, probably to the
Health Office. But as Dr. Beattie?s free, unprejudiced, and independent opinion was undoubtedly that the
case was one of chicken-pox, it would be unfair to Dr. Beattie to say that on that occasion he violated
quarantine principles by examining Soani and then proceeding direct to a populous town to report to his
superior. Later, on the same day, Soani was visited and examined by Drs. Mackellar and Beattie, who
handled the patient, pricked the vesicles and felt the papules on his skin, Ac., Ac.; and a conclusion was
come to that he suffered from small-pox. '
After arriving at such a decision, only by disregarding the fundamental rule of quarantine, could
those gentlemen get out of quarantine themselves, for they were after their examination of Soani, presum-
ably a close one, more likely to carry away contagion than the cook and steward of the ? Gunga ? would
have been.
6. There were on board the ?Gunga ? a large number of people, upwards of 100 I believe. Among
these, Soani, up to the visits of the medical officers, had been mixing freely. Surely had any precautions
beyond mere detention been taken against the spread of the disease these people would have been vaccinated,
an omission that is the.more striking that, as it appears, there are unvaccinated children among the number
with whom Soani was in the habit of playing on board the ? Gunga.?
7. Probably owing to the disregard of quarantine requirements by those administering it, some of
those detained in quarantine show them equal disrespect. It is no secret that some of those detained at the
quarantine station have deliberately walked outside the quarantine boundaries to meet their friends, Ac.,
and


and that even the suburb of Manly Beach has been visited. But what else could be expected after the
open and much more faulty proceedings of the Health Officers themselves. Those detained in quarantine
saw the Assistant Health Officer land and visit themselves about a week ago, then proceed to town and return
again to the quarantine station in the same clothes, on the same day.
8. When visitors go to see their friends in quarantine they are allowed to approach positively within
a few inches of each other, at least as near as they would ordinarily approach were there no nominal line of
demarcation. At these meetings there is sometimes a policeman present, but very frequently no officer of
the quarantine.
9. Stores are taken from Sydney to the jetty used by those detained in quarantine and landed there,
and the vessel fetching them then returns to Sydney.
10. But without any other example of the laxity and inefficiency of this quarantine, the method
adopted for exchanging mail matter would alone at once prove these qualities to exist to a degree that is
almost incredible. Letters for those in quarantine are taken from Sydney and are, at the quarantine
boundary or in boats, passed direct from hand to hand from those not in to those supposed to be in quaran-
tine. The conveyance of mail matter from the Quarantine Station is, as might be expected, a more com-
plicated, but certainly not a safer proceeding. The letters, after being well cut about to allow the disinfect-
ing fumes to get inside the letter, are fumigated by an officer ashore at the quarantine station. They are
then tied by a piece of twine to a small stick, which is not fumigated, put in a skiff and brought alongside
the steam launch that is to fetch them to Sydney. Anived at that vessel, the officer in the skiff hands the
painter of his boat to an officer on the launch, and is thus held close to that vessel. The officer in the skiff
then lifts his mail by the stick and hands the whole package of stick twine and mail to the officer on the
launch. From this point proceedings are not uniform. Two days ago, a mail was brought off as above in
my presence. On that occasion the stick was about fifteen inches long, and the letters tied to it at a point
about four inches from one end. The officer in the launch detached the letters and twine and threw down
the stick among some small pieces of timber in the launch, along with which it was brought to Sydney.
Yesterday I saw two mails brought from quarantine. In the first instance the letters were attached to a
splinter about nine inches long. The launch officer broke off the two ends of the splinter, and threw them
overboard; but the middle third, with the piece of twine attached, he threw into the cabin of the launch,
by which it also was brought to town. The second mail consisted of only two or three letters, attached to
a twig about half an inch thick and about three and a half inches long, with a splintered end of about two
and a half inches more. The unbroken end served as a handle, and the letters were attached to the
splintered end in such a way that about three inches of twine intervened between the twig and the letters.
This mail?twig, twine, and letters?was handed on board the launch in the usual way, and this time the
whole of the twig was thrown overboard, and only the letters and twine brought to Sydney. Of course so
far as protection against disease is supplied by such a system, the letters, which are freely handled in
quarantine after being fumigated, are just as dangerous as the unsmoked stick, and people might nearly, if
not quite, as well go ashore to fetch their own letters.
11. The important point in Soani?s case, connected with the few facts I have- stated above, is that
under such circumstances no one appears to have got small-pox from him ; and there is therefore a strong
probability that Soani never had small-pox.
12. But apart altogether from Soani?s special case, these facts have an important practical bearing
of a general character which, however, I merely mention here. Suppose a case of undoubted dangerous
contagious disease to be put in quarantine at Sydney, can the owners of vessels sailing from this port to
other countries expect that a quarantine, conducted here on the lines I have only exemplified above, will
in any way save their vessel from being subjected to quarantine on arrival elsewhere 1
13. In conclusion let me state lest it should be said that I was morally bound, on the ground of
humanity, to draw attention sooner to the complete inadequacy of the quarantine, that before I was well
acquainted with the system pursued, I had formed the opinion that there was no small-pox to guard
against. I have <fec.,

Sir, The Treasury, New South Wales, Sydney, 8 September, 1882.
1 have the honor, by direction of the Colonial Treasurer, to acknowledge receipt of your letter
of the 7lh instant, which you state to be in continuation of previous correspondence on the alleged illness
of the Fijian ? Soani? from small-pox.
As this communication consists principally of allegations as to the presumed lax character of the
present quarantine restrictions at the North Head, and as it also contains special allegations against the
Health Officer and his Assistant, Mr. Watson has directed your communication to be referred to those
gentlemen for explanation and report.
I am, however, directed at once to take exception to that portion of your letter (paragraph 5) which
states that ?Dr. Beattie?s free, unprejudiced, and independent opinion was undoubtedly that the case (of
Soani) was one of chicken-pox.? Dr. Beattie?s opinion is to be found in his official report of date 26th
August last, a certified copy of which was sent you in Treasury letter No. M. 1355, of the 7th instant.
That report is headed ?S.S. 1 Gunga,? Suspicious Case.? It commences by stating ?there is a coloured
man bn board suffering from a vesicular eruption resembling varicella.? But he continues: ?The vesicles


are well formed, and in some places present well-marked umbilication; they are all in the vesicular stage.
He is a servant of Sir Arthur Gordon, and has had rigors, headache, and the other symptoms and signs of
invasion of variola, except the backache. I withhold my positive diagnosis until in consultation with
another medical man; meantime, I consider the case of sufficient gravity to detain the ship (till further
instructed) in Watson?s Bay. I have ordered the yellow flag to be raised, and interdicted all communication
with the vessel.?
In what way then has Dr. Beattie changed his original opinion, which, on the evidence of the quoted
document, certainly was not that the case ?was one of chicken-pox.?
It would, perhaps, be well to point out to you?for it is presumed that as a stranger in the Colony
you can scarcely be aware of the circumstances?that from June, 1881, to January, 1882, inclusive, small-pox
(for the first time in our history) was epidemic in and about Sydney, yet that under the Quarantine Laws
of the Colony, the dreaded disease just referred to was effectually stamped out?a case which, Mr. Watson
is informed, is without precedent in the recorded history of the disease.
With this experience of a system so severely tested and so successful in its results, any objections to
it must be founded upon a very firm basis to deprive it of its claims to the public confidence.

hours, as the case was, he believed, one of chicken-pox ; but he was not willing to take on himself the responsibility of at
once admitting us to pratique. , ,

about half-past two p.m. As we walked up the hill from the beach to our (Quarters I entered into conversation with Dr.
Beattie, who was walking up the hill alongside me, and who had previously informed me he was acquainted with my wife?s
family. I expressed my great vexation at our detention, as I knew Mrs. Nalder was in a delicate, in fact critical state
of health. He said I need be under no anxiety, as he thought it would be all right, and that we should, in all probability,
be released in a day or two. This was after the case had been formally declared to be one of small-pox.

ladder of the s.s. ?Gunga ? when the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie, was about to leave the steamer for the purpose
of reporting to the Principal Health Officer. ( , ,
During the time that he was waiting for his boat to come alongside I spoke to him and said, ?Doctor, if you are
going to keep us any time in quarantine, will you see that some newspapers are sent to ils, as we have now been three
weeks without news.? He replied, ?Oh, yes ! but you need not be under any apprehension, I have no doubt you will be
released directly.? .
While I cannot swear positively to the exact words he used, I can swear to his telling nie that he thought we would
be released directly, and he spoke so positively that he left no doubt ih my mind that we would be in Sydney before 12
o?clock. This impressed itself on my mind, more particularly as I wished to reach my office before 1 o?clock, and I knew
that at least one of our fellow-passengers was anxious to be in Sydney before the closing of the banks at 12 o?clock.

I have the honor, by direction of the Colonial Treasurer, to acknowledge receipt of your letter
of the, 7th instant, enclosing further sworn statements (three in number) in reference to some alleged
remarks made by the Assistant Health Officer to certain of the passengers of the ? Gunga,? on the occasion
of his official visit to that vessel on the morning of the 26th ultimo.
It surely must occur to you that the placing of the ? Gunga ? in quarantine and the detention of a
large number of persons?her passengers and crew?at the North Head, must be capable of justification by
the Government on other grounds than could be furnished by the casual utterances of the Assistant Health
Officer, and it must be held as equally true that whatever that officer may have said to any person or
persons, both he and the authorities are bound by the official reports of the responsible persons, and by
these only.
You are aware that the action of the Government was based upon the written official report of Dr.
Beattie, dated 26th ultimo (of which you have a copy), supported by the separate and independent
examination of the patient (Soani) by the Health Officer also on the 26th ultimo (whose notes you have
seen), and in the face of those facts it must be clear to you that no weight whatever can be attached to the
six affidavits which you have been good enough to supply, in reference to something Dr. Beattie is alleged
to have said to some of the passengers about the possible character of the disease and the duration of the
quarantine.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Eagar?s letter marked M-1,354 of yester-
day?s date. I have to thank you for your kindness in causing my letter of the 4th instant to be submitted
to the Board of Health.
2. I must, however, point out to you that both yourself and the Board of Health seem to mis-
apprehend my object in concerning myself with the case of Soani. The resolution of the Board would lead
one to infer that I took exception to Soani?s case being dealt with (as regards detention in quarantine) as if
he suffered from small-pox. The detention in quarantine in New South Wales of those arriving in that
Colony from elsewhere, does not per se affect the Chief Medical Officer of Fiji; but when a case of disease,
the nature of which is doubtful arises in this Colony from Fiji and is publicly, without reserve or qualifi-
cation, pronounced to be a case of small-pox, it is the duty of the Chief Medical Officer of Fiji to
endeavour to procure the correction of such statements or representations, by those responsible for them.
3. I cannot but infer from the resolution of the Board that, in the opinion of that body, the case is
a doubtful one of small-pox; and I have no doubt that, on the case put before the Board, its view is to that
extent correct; and its recommendation to maintain quarantine therefore justified; but in my opinion the
careful and guarded resolution of the Board does not justify nor harmonize with the statements I here enclose
and to which alone I take exception, from the Sydney Morning Herald of the 2nd and 6th instant.
4. I have already pointed out to you that the absolute nature of the statements is calculated
to injure materially Fijian shipping interests; their modification cannot prejudicially affect New South
Wales. I have put before you ample evidence to show that, to say the least, the case is a doubtful one of
small-pox, and I now ask, what I have no doubt your own sense of justice will readily concede, that the
enclosed statements be modified to that extent ?I ask for no modification of the quarantine?with the
same publicity as that with which they were made.
5. Two reasons are advanced by the Board why I should not see Soani.
(A.) That after the lapse of time, at this stage of the case, a satisfactory differential diagnosis
could not be established.
(B.) That granting my request would be a breach of the law.
With regard to the first, let me remind you that according to Dr. Mackellar?s report and opinion, Soani at
noon on the 26th August, was covered by the ? somewhat shotty? papules, and by the vesicles of small-pox;
and my application to be allowed to see Soani was delivered by myself on the morning of the sth instant.
I leave those who have had experience of small-pox, to say whether the eruption of that disease could have
disappeared in that time, although the eruption of chicken-pox would, after so many days, leave no trace,
save discoloration of the skin, and it might be a few scabs where the skin is thickest, which I understand
was the actual condition of Soani several days ago.
6. If I endeavoured to procure a breach of the law, I regret it; but if I did so, I did it in the ignorance
of experience teaching me that elsewhere the law makes provision for persons going into quarantine; and it
can hardly be that the Board supposed I expected to go into quarantine, examine Soani, and then come
straight back to Sydney, as I personally told Dr. Mackellar that I was, of course, prepared to remain in
quarantine twenty-one days if I examined Soani At the same time it may well be remarked that a law
which allowed Dr. Beattie after examining Soani on board the ? Gunga,? flying the yellow flag, to come
thence to town and fetch his colleague; which allowed them both to examine Soani on board the ?Gunga,?
and to return to town and to their other duties; which allowed Dr. Beattie about a week ago to land at
the Quarantine Station, and remain five or six hours among those detained there ; which allowed articles
to be brought from the Quaratine Station to Sydney without undergoing the process of smoking; and
which yet cannot allow me to visit Soani even on the condition of remaining in quarantine, is possessed of
very surprising elasticity of interpretation, and may very innocently be broken by a stranger.

{Enclosure.']
Sydney Morning Herald, 2 Sept., 1882.
Everything is progressing satisfactorily at the Quarantine Station, the luckless passengers of the ?Gunga? making them-
selves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances they have been placed in. The authorities have exerted them-
selves to make the enforced stay of those in quarantine as pleasant and as little irksome as it can be made, and have sent
to the station quoits, cricketing material, and quite a library of light literature?indeed from all accounts an invitation to
spend a few weeks in quarantine is far from being the least pleasant episode that might occur in a lifetime. Balls, concerts,
and dramatic entertainments fill up the evenings, and so contented do the passengers appear that in answer to a question
from the Health officer yesterday, if there was anything they desired to make them still more comfortable, the only require-
ment they could think of was ? more newspapers.? It has been wrongly stated that the captain and crew of the ? Gunga?
in quarantine had been permitted to join her. Such is not the case, but the vessel, having been thoroughly disinfected, a
new captain, Mr. T. A. Lake, and new crew were allowed to take possession of her, and yesterday she departed, for Levuka.
The patient, who there is no reason to doubt is suffering from a true case of smallpox, is progressing favourably to recovery.
Dr. Cay, the resident medical superintendent, attends to the health of those at the station, and every day the assistant
medical officer pays a visit there, and at occasional intervals the Health officer also visits the sanatorium.
Sydney Morning Herald, (! Sept., 1882.
Mr. Watson, in answer to Mr. Young, said that the Fijian servant of Sir Arthur Gordon was suffering from smallpox,
but the disease was modified by successful vaccination. The members of the Board of Health meet to-morrow to consider
how long it is intended to keep the ?Gunga? passengers in quarantine.

I am to inform you, in reply, that so much of your letter as it may he considered necessary to refer

responsible to the Government and possessing its confidence.
Nor can Mr. Watson consent to be bound by newspaper articles or paragraphs, with which the

statements for which he is not responsible.
Your intention of remaining in quarantine for a period of twenty-one days, had you been permitted to

Dr. William McGregor, C.M.G., Chief Medical Officer of Fiji, to The Colonial

Sir, Australian Club Sydney, 8 September, 1882,
1 have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Eagar?s letter of yesterday, marked M. 1,355, and
I have to thank you for the copy of Dr. Beattie?s report conveyed to me therein.
2. My attention has been invited ?to the marked difference between the actual contents and
significance of that document?as will be evident from its perusal?and its contents and significance as
sworn to by the gentlemen making those affidavits.?
3. If Mr. Eagar or yourself will peruse the document in question, I think you will find it no easy
matter to arrive at its ? actual significance?; for I confess that, although I may reasonably be credited with
some acquaintance with technical terminology, and be supposed to have some familiarity with professional
subjects, I am unable to formulate definitely the ? actual significance? of Dr. Beattie?s very remarkable
report. However, I willingly accept Dr. Beattie?s statements, that the eruption resembled that of chicken-
pox, and that the vesicles were in the vesicular stage.
4. If Dr. Beattie?s report shows anything it is that in his opinion it was a ?suspicious case?; and
had the public statements with reference to the case left it in that position I should not have begun this
correspondence. Biit Dr. Beattie?s report does not justify the positive statements that the case was one of
small-pox, that I had the honor in my letter of this morning to ask you to modify, a request that I doubt not

Sir, The Treasury, New South Wales, Sydney, 8 September, 1882.
I have the honor, by direction of the Colonial Treasurer, to acknowledge receipt of your letter
of to-day?s date, in answer to Treasury communication M. 1,355.
Mr. Watson regrets that you are unable to perceive any difference between the absolute and un-
qualified sworn statements of gentlemen who declare the contents of a document to be one thing, while
when the document itself is produced the contents are shown to be quite another thing. ' It is not stated in
Dr. Beattie?s report, as sworn by the gentlemen referred to, that the case of Soani is ? one of chicken-pox.?
It is stated in that report to be a ? suspicious case, resembling varicella,? but it is also stated that the patient
had ?rigors, headache, and the other symptoms and signs of invasion of variola except backache.?
The ? actual contents and significance ? of the report point therefore to small-pox, and not to
chicken-pox.
Mr. Watson observes that you are willing to accept so much of Dr. Beattie?s report as indicates a
resemblance of the disease ?to chicken-pox, and that the vesicles were in a vesicular stage.? But Mr.
Watson holds that you are bound to the whole document, and that in common fairness you must also accept
? the symptoms and signs of an invasion of small-pox.? You cannot choose from the report that which suits
your own argument, and neglect that which establishes and justifies the action of the Government.
With respect to the alleged ? reiterated verbal assurances of Dr. Beattie, that the case was one of
chicken-pox, and that the passengers would not be detained in quarantine,? I am to inform you that Dr.
Beattie has been called upon for an explanation, but whatever that may be it will not affect the question at
issue. I have, <tc.,
G. EAGAR.

The Health Officer to The Under-Secretary for Finance and Trade,
Sir, Sydney, 9 September, 1882.
I have the honor to report, for the information of the Colonial Treasurer, that I have oh
several occasions, since the s.s. ?Gunga? was placed in quarantine, given special permission to Lady Gordon
to visit the Quarantine waters, in order to hold verbal communication with' His Excellency the Honorable
Sir Arthur Gordon, who is at present one of the inmates of the Quarantine Station. On each occasion I
have given notice of the intended visit to the Superintendent, and directed him to observe from a respectful
distance that the Quarantine Regulations were complied with, namely, that the boat did not approach
within 20 feet. I gave this permission to Lady Gordon, through Mr.' Murray, Sir Arthur?s Private
Secretary, on the clear and expressed understanding that such interviews could only take place with my
consent, and in the presence of the Superintendent.
I regret to say that my injunction not to approach within 20 feet, which was communicated by
telegram to the Superintendent, and by him shown to Sir Arthur Gordon, has been disregarded, for I am
informed by the Government boatmen that ?on many occasions his boat has approached to within 2 feet of
the launch,? and that ? the boat in fact frequently touched the steamer.?
This morning Lady Gordon visited the Quarantine waters, in His Excellency the Governor?s launch
? Nea,? without having previously obtained my permission. Whether any further breach of the law took
place lam unable to say, as the Superintendent was away; therefore, I deemed it my duty, having in view
such gross infringement of the Quarantine Regulations, to repeat my directions to the police to detain any
person so offending in future. - I have, &c.,

Sir, Sydney, 9 September, 1882.
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Eagar?s letters, marked respectively 1,357,
1,358, 1,359, 1,360, and 1,368, and to these I will reply briefly collectively.
2. In that marked 1,357 Mr. Eagar is directed to take exception to my statement that Dr. Beattie?s
opinion of Soani?s case was that it was one of chicken-pox. My statement is based on the sworn testimony
of six witnesses, to whom Dr. Beattie expressed the opinion, direct or implied, that the case was one of
chicken-pox. I consider, in the absence of rebutting evidence much stronger than any produced so far, that
my statement was well founded.
3. In 1,359, my right to interfere in any way with the Quarantine laws and regulations is denied.
I never dreamed of interfering with them beyond reference to them in supporting the argument that
Soani?s illness should not, with the many elements of grave doubt surrounding it, be dogmatically set down
as a case of undoubted small-pox.
4. In 1,368 the difference between Dr. Beattie?s report and its nature as sworn to in the affidavits
forwarded is discussed. It must be remembered that Dr. Beattie read the report to those gentlemen, who,
I have no doubt, will be very willing to confront Dr. Beattie when they can have the original document
before them, to satisfy all parties.
5. No. 1,360 raises the question of the Government being justified in detaining the people from the
? Gunga? in quarantine. The question raised by me, I repeat, was not that of the detention of the people
in quarantine, but the question of the justification of certain absolute statements that Soani suffered from
small-pox. If the Government here are not sure that the disease is not small-pox, I should say the Govern-
ment is justified in maintaining quarantine ; but, unless the Government is sure that the case is certainly
small-pox, it would not be right for any Government officer to say absolutely that the case is one of small-
pox. I gather, however, from the communications under acknowledgment, that the statements I took
exception to are either inaccurately reported or are not on official authority, and therefore I have nothing
further to contend for.
6. As to what has been said as to the limitation of my admission to the Health Officer as to the
detention in quarantine, I may repeat that, in my opinion?which is only that of an individual and binding
on no other person?the case was one of chicken-pox. I have already said more than once that if there
was any doubt that the case might be small-pox, quarantine was justified?a question not raised by me.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this day?s date, drawing my
attention to the fact that Lady Gordon had visited the Quarantine Station on Saturday last without your
consent, and that you are informed it is her intention to go again to-day ? under similar conditions.?
2. With respect to the visit on Saturday, I have the honor to explain that my note requesting your
permission was written on the previous evening, and given by me to my servant for delivery early in the
morning. It is only now that I find it still to be in his possession undelivered. As I received no answer,
I took it for granted, as you have allowed me to do on previous occasions, that you had no objection to the
visit.
3. That.you were mistaken in supposing that Lady Gordon ?intended? to visit the Quarantine
Station to-day without your knowledge, will have been shown you by my letter asking the usual permission,
which must have reached you at an early hour this morning. A delay of a few moments, or a line asking
for explanation, would have shown you that the ? information,? on which you ground so hasty and unjust a
charge, was not to be relied on.
4. But for the terms which you have yourself used, I should have thought it unnecessary to assure
you that Lady Gordon has no desire, in the least particular, to ? infringe ? or ? disregard the law,? nor is it
possible for Lady Gordon to ?persist ?in an ?intention ? which she has never entertained. Lady Gordon has,
throughout the period of Sir Arthur Gordon?s quarantine, been careful to act scrupulously in accordance
with the instructions of the Health Officer. The threat of ? giving orders for the detention? of Lady
Gordon in quarantine, which you have thought fit to employ, is entirely uncalled for, and therefore, I regret

Sir, Sydney, 11 September, 1882.
I have the honor to return herewith Dr. McGregor?s letter of the 7th instant, bearing the
Honorable the Colonial Treasurer?s minute dated 9/9/82.
I have carefully read the communication, which severely criticises the manner in which our Quaran-
tine Regulations are carried out. I have more particularly noted that part (paragraph 5) referring to my
visit to the ? Gunga? in order to examine the patient supposed to be suffering from small-pox Dr.
McGregor did not know, nor in fact am I aware that he asked, whether I had taken any precaution to
prevent infection, but I beg to state, for your information, that after ? handling the patient I washed my
hands in water as hot as it could conveniently be borne, and that immediately on my arrival in Sydney I
proceeded to my disinfecting apparatus and subjected my clothing to the fumes of burning sulphur for.
some hours, thereby rendering it innocuous. Dr. McGregor?s idea that the surgeon who visits a patient
with the object of forming a diagnosis should be detained in quarantine, is absolutely impracticable, and
therefore absurd.
Paragraph 6, referring to the alleged neglect of vaccination, I have referred to Dr. Day, the Medical
Superintendent, for report, for on the morning of the 28th ultimo a supply of twelve tubes of pure vaccine,
was delivered at the Quarantine Station by Mr. Sager,. my clerk, and Dr. Day was instructed by me to
vaccinate all those who wished to have the operation performed.
Paragraph 8, referring to visitors going to see their friends in quarantine being allowed to approach
within a few inches, is a particularly unfortunate one for Dr. McGregor, as the only person who has been
permitted to have visitors is the Honorable Sir Arthur Gordon; and in order that he should clearly under-
stand the conditions under which it was permitted, I, on the 30th ultimo, sent a telegram informing Sergeant
Hawkins that the interviews were to take place only in his presence, and that Sir Arthur Gordon (who was
to be shown the telegram) was not to approach within 20 feet. As an exception to this rule, I may state
that I allowed an interview between His Excellency Lord Augustus Loftus and the Honorable Sir Arthur
Gordon at a much closer distance; and on another occasion I permitted a similar interview with His Excel-
lency Monsieur De La Barriere, the Governor of New Caledonia, but on these occasions I was present
myself, so that I am quite sure that the law was not infringed ; and the reason for permitting the interviews
to take place at so short a distance was because I thought it likely that the gentlemen referred to might
have business of a private or official nature which it would not be proper to allow the boatmen to overhear.
Regarding paragraph 10, I may state that all letters are thoroughly fumigated separately, then they
are tied in a bundle, together with a certificate that they have been subjected to that process, the bundle is
then tied to a stick and again fumigated, and in that condition put on board the launch for delivery in-
Sydney. A more thorough method of dealing with them I could not conceive.

Minute of Governor and Executive Council.
Minute Paper for the Executive Council.
Subject ;?Case of the steamship ?Gunga.?
No. 99. The Treasury, New South Wales, Sydney, 12 September, 1882.
Referring to Executive Minute of the 29th ultimo, under which the s.s. ? Gunga,? with her crew and
passengers, was placed in quarantine, on the report of the Health Officer, the Colonial Treasurer begs to
intimate to His Excellency the Governor and the Executive Council the further action taken in this matter.
In the first instance, the Fijian native, Soani, suffering from a supposed case of small-pox, was, by
order of the Health Officer, removed to the Coast Hospital at Little Bay, on the 27 th ultimo, for the pur-
pose of isolation and medical treatment.
It was next decided (also on the report of the Health Officer) thoroughly to fumigate the ? Gunga ?
and (her crew and passengers having previously been landed at the Quarantine Station) permit her to come
up to Sydney, where she accordingly arrived on the 28th ultimo.
On the same day a telegram was received from Dr. Lowers (Surgeon-in-charge, Little Bay Hospital),
supplying certain information as to the then present condition of the patient (Soani), which was submitted
to the Board of Health, and the Health Officer and his Assistant having handed in their respective reports
on the condition of the patient (when examined on the previous Saturday), the Board was of opinion that it
was their duty to recommend the Government to continue to deal with the case as one of small-pox.
The Colonial Treasurer requests the confirmation of His Excellency in Council for the action taken,
and further recommends (having regard to the agreement of opinion between the Health Officers and the
Health Board (to which body reference was made), that the crew and passengers of the ? Gunga,? and the
patient, Soani, be detained in quarantine until further report from the Health Officer.

In reply to your communication having date the 12th instant, wherein it is stated that an
allegation has been made by a person or persons detained on the Quarantine Station, ? that I have neglected
to use the means of protection by vaccinating them,? I have the honor to state that the allegation is at
variance with truth, for not only have I circulated amongst the inmates of Quarantine that it would be
desirable for all persons to be vaccinated, but that it would be better even to revaccinate, in order to test
whether the system was guarded by lymph. I was met on all hands, that everyone had been vaccinated
(with the exception of one, to whom I will presently allude), and all showed good testimony of early successful
vaccination. So desirous have I been to carry out your instructions that I invariably carried in my pocket
lymph, so as to avail myself of any opportunity which might present.
Immediately on receipt of lymph I went to the ladies and children?s cabin, intimating my instructions.
The ladies and all the children, save one, evidenced successful vaccination. In answer to my wish to operate
upon the infant not vaccinated, \ was met by the reply, ? That if vaccination were compulsory she would
submit 1 ? I was obliged to admit that it was not compulsory, and as small-pox was not in Quarantine, and
the child suffering from dentition, she would defer it until a more favourable opportunity presented.

a fourth man, named C. Gibson, who, I am informed, had been drinking, and, complaining of illness,
requested to be taken ashore, where he remains. Saw Police-constable Wallace and Superintendent
Hawkins.

Sir, Watson?s Bay, 13 September, 1882.
The telegram of Superintendent Hawkins reporting the detention of four men at North Head,
and asking your instructions, was handed to me at Circular Quay, at 6-15 p.m., on 12th inst.
I read your instructions written across Hawkins? communication, and immediately proceeded to
carry them out. I


I reached the Quarantine Station at 7 - 25 p.m. ; saw Constable Wallace, who stated that four men
(three of whom were residents of Manly) were detained for having entered the Quarantine waters, their boat
having been found about 100 feet from the jetty at Stone Beach; and that one of these men, who
complained of illness, and desired to be placed on shore, had left the boat and landed, whilst the other three
occupants, named respectively, C. S. Elton, C. Underwood, and H. Hughes, remained in the boat, and never
approached nearer shore or any of the people at the Station closer than 100 feet.
These gentlemen, themselves, as also Superintendent Hawkins, verify the statement of Constable
Wallace. Having therefore, quite satisfied myself that there had been no actual contact, and that the three
men in the boat might be set free without danger to the public health, I gave them pratique immediately,
and ordered the detention of the man Gibson, who had gone ashore of his own will and at his own request,
until the release of all those at present in quarantine.

Extract from the Minutes of the Board of Health, at then* meeting of
13th September, 1882.
A letter was read from Mr. F. P. Murray, Private Secretary to His Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon,
enclosing a communication, addressed by His Excellency to Mr. Murray, complaining of the terms of the
Board?s resolution of the 6th instant (copy of which had been transmitted to Sir Arthur), and requesting
that the communication so addressed to Mr. Murray might be laid before the Board. The Board, having
regard to the facts that Sir Arthur Gordon?s memo, of the sth instant was a document drawn up in His
Excellency?s handwriting, and initialled by him?that it did not bear the signature of any other passenger
detained in quarantine?that it was forwarded to the Board (see Mr. Murray?s note of 6th instant) by Sir
Arthur Gordon?s direction, and at his request read to the Board?could not, under these circumstances,
view it otherwise than as indicating a possible desire to interfere with the action of the Board by the
influence of a high name and position. The Board, however, are glad to find, from Sir Arthur Gordon?s
letter of explanation now before them, that he had no intention whatever that personal considerations should
prevail over those that affect the public welfare. They desire to place this statement on record, and direct a
copy of this minute to be forwarded to Sir Arthur Gordon. .
Telegrams (two in number) from the Acting Superintendent of the Quarantine Station, conveying
the desire of the passengers landed ex ? Gunga? to know the day of their possible release, having been
read, the Board deliberated, and unanimously resolved, ?? That the release of the crew and passengers
landed ex ? Gunga ? (presuming that no new case of infectious disease occur in the interim) might, with
safety to the public health, take place at the expiry of twenty-one clear days from the date of the removal
of Soani from the Quarantine Station to the Little Bay Hospital?say, computing from the 27th ultimo ;
and that the Health Officer, after seeing that the necessary cleansing process has taken place, be requested
to give notice to the Australasian Steam Navigation Company to provide a suitable steamer to convey the
people so about to be released to Sydney, at 8 a.m. on Sunday next, the 17th instant.?

His Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon to Mr. F. P. Murray, Private Secretary.
My dear Murray, Quarantine Station, Sydney, 11 September, 1882.
I have to thank you for sending on to me the resolution of the Board of Health, embodied in Mr. Eagar?s letter to
you of the 7th instant.
If by the phrase ?individual considerations? is meant, as I suppose is the case, considerations affecting the
convenience or interests of particular individuals, I entirely agree with the Board of Health that such considerations cannot
be taken into account in the determination of ?an important matter concerning the health of the whole community.? But
as the memorandum to which the resolution relates contains no reference whatever to such considerations, 1 am at a loss to
perceive the relevancy or point of the observation in question.
On hearing that the Board of Health was about to reassemble to consider whether the period originally fixed for our
detention should be maintained or reduced, I prepared, at the request of my fellow-passengers, a memorandum setting
forth the facts to which we desired the attention of the Board of Health to be drawn. I pointed out the antecedent
improbability of the case being one of small-pox, and the great antecedent probability of its being one of an eruptive
disease, endemic in Fiji, to the contagion of which the patient had been specially exposed. I urged that though the case
was one of so suspicious a nature as amply to justify our original detention, it was possible that, on a fuller investigation
of its details and history than was practicable during the brief and hurried examination on board the ?Gunga,? it might
turn out that in this, as has been the case in other instances, the symptoms might have been delusive ; and that this
probability was increased by the course taken by the illness itself, by the non-occurrence of any case of small-pox among
the numerous fellow-passengers of the patient and the occurrence of an eruptive disorder, certainly not small-pox and
closely resembling that which had appeared in the patient, on the person of one of those who had been in contact with
him ; and I expressed our unanimous hope that, in consideration of these circumstances, our period of quarantine might be
shortened, or that, at all events, a further investigation of the case might take place. I added what is, I believe, the
general conviction of those detained here, that, if infectious disease indeed existed among us, its spread could not bo
prevented by the quarantine now in force.
These are not ? personal considerations,? but considerations affecting the public question which the Board was
called together to decide, and I venture to conceive that any members of the community, but especially those to be affected
by the decision of the Board, are fully entitled to invite its attention to such points.
The enforcement of quarantine is often necessary, but, however requisite, it can never be enforced without the
infliction of some hardship and loss on those subjected to it. There can, therefore, be no doubt that, even in cases where
quarantine has been imposed on adequate grounds of suspicion, it should be relaxed if circumstances should subsequently
transpire which render the continuance of the precautions taken unnecessary; and that the fullest investigation should
always take place of any allegations tending to throw doubt on the necessity of restrictions which unless necessary are
arbitrary and unjust.
In the present case, the Board of Health was reassembled to consider whether any cause was shown for the modifi-
cation of its original decision, the maintenance of which, if not absolutely requisite, would, as I have just observed, be
harsh and oppressive. I cannot but suppose that the Board desired to receive all possible indications of the evidence
which might be obtained, and was prepared to consider dispassionately the arguments which might be urged in favour of
at least, a fuller investigation of the case.
To these objects the memorandum in question is wholly devoted, and I cannot permit it to bo dismissed from notice
as an appeal for the consideration of individual interests without expressing my grave dissent from the opinion of the
Board in that respect, and my regret that its members should have allowed themselves so to characterize a paper which is
in no respect open to such a description.
I shall bo obliged by your forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. Watson.
Yours, &c.,
ARTHUR GORDON.

Sir, Sydney, 22 September, 1882.
I have the honor to inform you that Major Knollys and the Fijian ?Soani,? who were on the 27th ultimo
removed from the s.s. ?Gunga? to the Little Bay Hospital, were yesterday released from quarantine, and discharged from
the institution. I have, &c.,

Sir, Coast Hospital and Sanitarium, Little Bay, 23 September, 1882.
' As I am unable to find any case-book for recording the clinical history of patients admitted to
the hospital, I forward a copy of the clinical notes taken by me while attending to the three patients who
have been here under my care. In doing so, I have deemed it advisable to adhere as strictly as possible to
the form in which I made the notes from time to time as the circumstances of each patient suggested them.
On these grounds I trust you will overlook the somewhat crude form of the following reports.
I have, &c.,
THOS. ROSS LEWERS,
Medical Superintendent.
Soani, said to be about 26 years of age ; born in Fiji; formerly a member of the Fijian Armed Constabulary j now a
domestic attendant of Sir A. Gordon.
The patient?s statements furnish the following history :?He was successfully vaccinated about six years ago. On
Wednesday, 23rd August, 1882, had some slight indications of malaise. During the night and next day he suffered from
head-ache, giddiness, lassitude, pains in loins and legs, sore throat, dysphagia, thirst, > anorexia, vomiting, protracted
rigors. On Friday morning some pimples appeared on the chin. Major Knollys informs me that on Friday afternoon, at
5 o?clock, the face was covered with papules. There is no reliable evidence concerning the body.
Saturday, 26 th inst., a.m. ?Dr. Beattie reported case as suspiciously like variola. Dr. Mackellar informs me that
about noon there was a general eruption, partly papular, partly vesicular, over the skin, and that the throat was affected ;
temperature over 102� F. ; pulse, 96.
Sunday, 27th August, 1882, 11 a.m. ?Admitted to Coast Hospital (�/c T.R.L.) at 10'30 ; temperature, 98"4 ; pulse,
62 ; eruption over face, scalp, neck, body, upper part of arms and thighs, small pustules or small scabs of fairly equal size,
not confluent; throat congested, red, with some small, bluish, livid-looking patches; no distinct papules; feels well;
appetite good; has two good vaccination marks.
27 th August, 1882, 8 p.m.? Pulse and temperature normal.
Monday, 28th August, 1882, a.m. ?Feels well; temperature, 98?6 F. ; pulse, 68; no new spots; about T ! 5 of the
spots has shed its scabs ; another -jL is still pustular ; the remaining eruption has well-formed scabs ; throat less congested.
28 th August, 1882, p.m. ?Temperature, 98'6; pulse, 74.
Tuesday, 29 th August, 1882, a.m. ?Sleeps well; temperature, 98'4 ; pulse, 62; about J spots have shed scabs.
Wednesday, 30th August, 1882, a.m. ?Nearly all scabs on face and head and half on body have fallen.
Thursday, 31 si August, 1882, a.m. ?Shedding of scabs continues.
Friday, Ist September, 1882, a.m. ?Almost all the scabs have fallen.
Monday, 4th September, 1882, a.m. ?About twenty scabs remain.
Wednesday, Gth September, 1882, a.m. ?About twelve scabs are left.
Friday, Bth September, 1882, a.m. ?Only five scabs remain.
Monday, 1 1th September, 1882, a. m. ?All scabs, except one on the back, have been shed, leaving small, pink cicatrices,
not depressed ; many of the scars have disappeared.
Wednesday, 13 th September, 1882, p.m. ?The last scab separated to-day.
Thursday, 21 st September, 1882, a.m. ?Discharged, cured.
T.R.L.
N.B.?The patient and Major Knollys persist in considering that the patient suffered from ? Sui Sui, ? a disorder
peculiar to Fijian natives. I was inclined at first to think the disease very rapid for variola ; but on further watching the
clinical history, could see no reason for considering the case anything but a normal one of variola, modified by a previous
successful vaccination.

The Assistant Health Officer, Watson?s Bay, to The Health Officer, Sydney.
Sir, Watson?s Bay, 26 September, 1882.
I have the honor to return herewith all the correspondence forwarded to me for perusal, and to
submit to you, for transmission to the Under-Secretary for Finance and Trade, the following explanation of
my conduct in relation to the steamship ? GUnga,? placed in quarantine on account of a case of small-pox
having been discovered on board.
The facts, as laid before you in my provisional report, dated 28 August, and read to the Health
Board, may be here briefly recapitulated.
On Saturday morning, 26 August last, I waited in my boat off Middle Head for entry of expected
vessel, ? Gunga,? between Sydney Heads. I reached alongside about 6.30 a.m., and Captain Saunders, in
reply to the accustomed preliminary inquiry if all were well on board, made answer ?yes.? When I got
on deck he informed me that one man, who was in the saloon, had a slight rash upon him. I proceeded
immediately to examine this patient, and found his case as follows;
Soani, a man of colour and native of Fiji, vaccinated five years ago; arm presenting at least one
distinct cicatrix; is twenty-five years of age ; a well-developed adult, of medium height. He understands
English imperfectly, but replies to questions addressed to him with tolerable intelligence.
He suffers from an eruptive febrile disease. The tongue is foul, the breath extremely foetid, secre-
tions vitiated, temperature pyrexial, pulse 100; aspect dull and stupid till roused, and the general constitu-
tional condition is indicative of severe febrile disturbance. The eruption is diffuse, uniform, and vesicular,
and somewhat resembles that variety described as varicella coniformis.
My inquiries, upon this my first examination of the patient, elicited from him the admissions that
he had vomited, had sickness of stomach, had suffered from bad frontal head-ache, had felt generally
unwell for a short time previously, and that he had experienced shiverings of cold (rigors) : I understood
him to deny that he had back-ache (rachialigia). He appeared to me at this time to be quite aware of the
desire?a very natural and excusable one?of those around him to make as light as possible of the case,
and I could hardly avoid surmising that the man might be the victim of a graver affection than he himself
knew, or than some of his follow-passengers had any suspicion of.
Having very carefully examined ? all hands ? on board, I returned to the saloon and there filled up
in the usual manner the form of ? Health Officer?s Report,? at the captain?s dictation, to. which this
gentleman appended his signature. I then filled the third blank page of the form with a statement of
Soani?s case, which I read aloud to the captain and in the hearing of others in the saloon, and to the terms
of which I believe the captain expressed his assent. This document has been placed in the custody of
the Under-Secretary for Finance and Trade, and I shall have occasion to refer to it further on.
Having


Having now ordered the yellow flag to be hoisted, and interdicted all communication with the vessel
until I should return in a few hours, I found myself besieged by anxious and hurried inquirers around, and
getting down the side of the vessel I immediately pulled to Sydney to consult with you.
You are aware that I washed and partially redressed in your study and, at your suggestion
awaited the assembly of the Board of Health, the members of which you informed mo, were to meet that
morning. After further interrogation by the medical members of the Board, it was arranged that the
Health Officer should accompany me, and that after our consultation we should decide as to the disposal
of the patient and of the vessel. We accordingly went in the launch ?Sol,? my boat in tow, and the
patient was examined on board ?Gunga? by us both at 11 o?clock a.m.
This examination you first made. It was conducted in the most painstaking manner and to my
mind you could not possibly adopt greater precautions against a hasty or erroneous diagnosis.
I believe I am correct in stating that up to this stage, you had heard no opinion from mo as to the
nature of the case, my report left it an open question, and had you pronounced it chicken-pock I might
then possibly have agreed with you.
I now made my second examination of Soani, and understood him to say he had not vomited. I
addressed to him this question repeatedly and received each time a negative reply. Major Knollys very
kindly afforded me every assistance as interpreter. There was now the clearest history of rigors, and
when requested, Soani placed my hand upon the lumbar region, thus localising definitely the seat of pain, and
putting beyond question the existence of back ache, although I failed satisfactorily to ascertain from him
precise information with regard to the sequence and period of accession of these phenomena.
On examining his throat we discovered unmistakable evidence of extensive implication of the
mucous tract, the eruption engaging the soft palate and back of pharynx, which were much inflamed ; his
pulse was 100, and his temperature as ascertained by your thermometer, 102-2 Fahrenheit. He complained
of ? sore throat? and difficulty of swallowing, and I observed he was hoarse and suffered from a short
cough. Upon our consulting, you shook your head, and said you were very sorry but you feared the vessel
must go into quarantine, and that you could not conscientiously do otherwise as you believed it was small-
pox. An opinion I had now no difficulty in expressing my full acquiescence in, and which, the more I
watched the case, grew firmer and firmer in my mind.
My conviction remains unshaken.
The vessel was then ordered into quarantine by you, and there came to anchor under my supervision.
I followed her in my boat. I saw the people go ashore, and endeavoured to dispose of them and arrange
for their accommodation in the manner which seemed to me best calculated to afford them least discomfort.
There was not, it will be remembered, any medical officer in charge of the people, and as this was the
first occasion of the kind in which Quarantine Superintendent Hawkins was called upon to act, and to
act promptly and without previous notice or preparation, I considered my presence and experience necessary
in the emergency. During my stay on the station a telegram arrived from you, stating that the patient
must be removed to Little Bay, and that you should wire to me the arrangements necessary for his
removal thither. Subsequently another communication was received through telephone, directing me to
? put the patient in a boat, and to let it be towed behind the launch to the jetty at Rose Bay, where,the
ambulance van would probably be waiting.?
I made this proposal known to Sir Arthur Gordon, who thereupon expressed his decided objection to
the carrying out of such a measure, and who, in conjunction with Major Knollys', protested that the removal
of the man Soani would, in all probability, cause the patient?s death.
The evening was advancing, it was growing chilly and beginning to rain, and in the face of such
representation, I wired to you asking permission to have him taken off the ? Gunga,? and placed in hospital
enclosure, or on board hulk ? Faraway.? After an interval I received in reply a further and absolute injunc-
tion not to fail in having Soani removed on the following morning at 6.30 a.m., sharp, as ? the ambulance
would be in waiting at jetty, Rose Bay, to convey him to the Small-pox Hospital, Little Bay.? I visited
Quarantine Station next morning before daylight, and going direct to the quarters occupied by Sir Arthur
Gordon, I informed him of the decision as to the removal of his servant, and His Excellency forthwith
indicted the following note to me, which you have already read :
Sir, ?Before you remove my Fijian servant .Soani from the Quarantine Station to the Small-pox Hospital at
Double Bay {sic), I wish to place before you the following considerations :
Natives have, for the most part, a great horror of what they call the house of death and the removal to a distant place,
especially if alone, is likely to produce in him that expectation of death from which a native when once he has made up his
mind to it, never recovers, whether there is anything really the matter with him or not.
I regret extremely that he cannot be allowed to occupy the hospital here, where he would still feel that he was not
far removed from his friends, and was, so to speak, still in sight of them. But I should even more regret that any inter-
ference should be exercised with regard to Major Knollys? charitable intention of going into hospital with him. To send a
Fijian native but imperfectly acquainted with English alone into a small-pox hospital is, I should say, equivalent to passing
sentence of death on him ; and the responsibility of the consequences must rest with those who direct the step when warned
of its too probable consequences. I have, &c.,
ARTHUR H. GORDON, H.C.
The above communication was placed on the table before me, and I sent one of the Quarantine boat-
men to have it properly fumigated before taking it away. Meantime Major Knollys, who had remained on
board ? Gunga? during the night with Soani, had got into one of that vessel?s small boats, and was about to
start in tow of the attendant launch with the patient and one of the ? Gunga? crew, when I approached
within speaking distance, ordered an additional blanket to be placed about Soani?s shoulders, and directed the
sailor to go back to his ship, as the Major had volunteered to accompany the sick man. Although my
instructions were not to allow Major Knollys to accompany Soani, I felt that under the circumstances it would
be injudicious to interfere with his intention, and remaining in attendance on the launch?the boat and its two
occupants behind in tow?wo proceeded to Rose Bay, where I saw Soani safely placed in invalid carriage,
and with Major Knollys and the driver (D. Davidson), start for the Coast Hospital.
I afterwards returned to the Quarantine Station, which I have visited at least once every day since
its occupation by the ? Gunga? passengers, and occasionally more frequently, as in case of drugs being
urgently called for, particular instructions required, or a decision necessary (as occurred more than once
during last fortnight of quarantine) in cases of persons detained for encroaching within Quarantine precincts.


It will be perceived that I had Soani under observation only for the space of one day (during which
I made three minute examinations of the case), after which date (Saturday, 26th ultimo) I had no contact
with him, and upon which date I was almost exclusively occupied upon the station at North Head.
I may now declare that upon this day I came in contact with no one unconnected with my work,
and that I twice changed my clothes and availed myself of Jive several occasions to wash myself, viz., thrice
on board ?Gunga,? once in your house, and twice at Watson?s Bay.
I certainly cannot pretend that these ablutions were as complete as I should have desired, but if they
were not all that were practically required, they were all that were available.
In further testimony of my efforts to avoid carrying infection to others, I may be allowed to advert
to the circumstance that on the morning I had been on board ? Gunga? two vessels happened to arrive
in Port Jackson, viz., the ?Princess Louise,? from Solomon Islands, and the ? Atalanta,? from San
Prancisco ; and that I did not board either, but summoning ? all hands? to the side, I conducted my investi-
gations from my own boat, and at a safe distance.
Since the Sunday morning upon which Soani was removed to Little Bay I do not believe I have
ever approached any inmate of the Quarantine Station, within range of infection, except upon one occasion,
namely, upon 28th August last, when, at the instance of Dr. Day, medical officer in charge, and under-
standing that this gentleman had forwarded a statement to you, the Health Officer at Sydney, to the effect
that he had diagnosed two cases of chicken-pock at North Head amongst the inmates of the ?healthy
ground,? I went to the house occupied by those men (named respectively William Bennett and David
Cochran), and saw at once that they had not chickcn-pcck, and reported to you accordingly for the informa-
tion of the Government.
I copy the following extract from this Report, dated Ist September, 1882 :
I was informed by Dr. Day that there were two cases of what he believed to be varicella among the male passen-
gers (2nd class) on the healthy ground. With Dr. Day?s permission I proceeded to the house where these men were, and
having stripped them naked, examined them carefully in Dr. Day?s presence.
I affirm, without any hesitation, and beg to emphasise my diagnosis in the most positive way, that neither man is
suffering from this disease, and that, in my opinion, they could not have been suffering from this disease yesterday and be
this morning quite free from each and every trace of its existence.
The fact of two fellow passengers of the man Soani having developed varicella at the same time would tend in some
degree at least to fortify the notion that the case at Little Bay is one of chicken-pock. I therefore deem myself bound to
make the statement I now submit, namely, that there is at present no case at North Head presenting any single symptom
or sign of varicella ; and furthermore, that the history furnished by both men, no less than the absence of all anatomical
signs of this exanthem, absolutely negative such assumption. I request you will at your earliest convenience, either your-
self see, or send a medical gentlemen to examine these persons, as I am most anxious to remove an impression apparently
becoming more prevalent at the station as to the non-variolcus character of the disease from which the Fijian at Little Bay
is suffering, and which impression would be of course encouraged if chicken-pock were to break out there.
To this explanation of my conduct asked for by the Honorable the Treasurer, and now most respect-
fully submitted, I beg to append the following subsidiary remarks :
I have before me the sworn declarations of His Excellency the Honorable Sir Arthur Hamilton
Gordon, G.C.M.G., Her Majesty?s High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, etc., etc., of Captain Saunders,
and of Messrs. Hector Kidd, William Henry Nalder, Carl Ludwig Sahl, and William Kopsori?six aver-
ments, which in the words of the Secretary of the Health Board, ? appear to reflect upon Dr. Beattie in his
official capacity.?
I have carefully read them, and forbear to make that comment upon these documents which their
collective verbal inaccuracies and testified irrelevancies would warrant. Excepting one, all these papers
appear beneath philosophic valuation as clear concise narratives of acted deeds and spoken words on a given
occasion?and let me say that the one excepted is most certainly not that of Sir Arthur Gordon ; and fur-
ther to say that the statement indited in His Excellency?s own hand, and sworn to by Captain Saunders,
cannot be dismissed, as being merely misleading in spirit or expression, but remains a typical example of
self-contradiction as absurd as it is alien to fact.
That which I am stated to have written at the saloon table is at hand ; and I challenge any one of
those six gratuitous deponents to place his finger upon the phrase here sworn to, as written by me describing
Soani?s case as a ? mild case of chicken-pock ? or ? a case of slight sickness.?
The more positive the utterance the more incorrect.
I decline to have fathered upon me language I never made use of, nor can I permit myself to be
stultified by asseverations however solemnly formulated with all the imposing dignity of sign, seal, and
delivery.
Sir Arthur has need to be less lavish of his inverted commas, and his negligence as to their import
can only be shielded at the expense of his inconsiderate resentment because of a grievance of his own
creation. It is strange that he or any of those other gentlemen could so seriously misconceive my functions
or fancy that I should remain so ignorant of them myself as to suppose I had difficulty in ? assuming the
responsibility? of admitting to pratique a vessel with a mild case of chicken-pock on board. Common sense
ought to have suggested the utter uselessness of an official whose action could be so hampered.
I stand impeached by those gentlemen of having written a statement which I never wrote, and the
invalidity of the plaint is only the more patent because of its assumption of accuracy.
May I enquire what defect of memory could it have been which prevented Captain Saunders and the
rest who swear they saw me write and heard me read my statement ? upon the third side of foolscap,? from
bearing in mind, with equal circumstantiality, the following words, ?I reserve my positive diagnosis until I
have the benefit of consultation with another medical man.? Surely I could not then have decided it was
?a slight case of sickness,? or ?a mild case of chicken-pock.? I admit that my opinion at first inclined in
this direction, and I accordingly frankly told those who enquired of me, without gauging the probability of
being subsequently brought to task. This may have been indiscreet, but it cannot be called disingenuous,
and the suspension of my judgment caused no ambiguity in my action. I did all I considered my duty.
My course was clear, and having no other interests to serve than those of conscientious obligation, I cannot
be supposed?as must be inferred from the terms of the affidavits?to have been coerced or biassed in my
opinion.
I unhesitatingly acquit those gentlemen who have been induced to make these declarations of
deliberate desire to injure me by garbling my statements and perverting my language, but I cannot refrain,
G5?G


as an officer whose official conduct has been impugned, to express my regret at an act of discourtesy and
unfairness. I hold Sir Arthur Gordon accountable. He should not so far have forgotten himself as to
lend the weight of his authority to a step which few unselfish persons will approve.
I was more than once made painfully aware of His Excellency?s ill-disguised spleen, and if one so
humble as myself dared criticise so distinguished a personage, perhaps I might presume to say that his conduct
upon all occasions of his intercourse with me at the Quarantine Station did not correspond in equanimity to
the general idea of what is expected in the exalted character of a ? High Commissioner,? either on land or sea.
I have now replied to Sir Arthur and those others, and could add much more did I not forbear to
assume myself an attitude of unfriendly criticism I have ventured to censure in them.
All I have said and done in relation to the ? Gunga ? I accept the whole responsibility of, and if any
misdemeanour has been committed I appeal to those disinterested to declare at whose door it lies, and
whence should come, in justice, an apologetic disclaimer.
Two letters of Dr. William McGregor, 0.M.G., and Chief Medical Officer of Fiji, addressed to the
Honorable the Colonial Treasurer and to the Honorable the Colonial Secretary, and bearing date 6th and
7th September, must not be passed in silence. The, high position and esteemed character of the writer
entitle any emanation from his pen to most respectful consideration. I cannot, however, now do more than
briefly advert to these epistles, hoping at an early and opportune occasion to be found prepared to reply in
detail to all he has so ably urged against my diagnosis of Soani?s case. With what success it shall remain
for those?the only competent arbiters (irrespective of the Colony they may belong to) my professional
brethren to decide.
Were I to attempt a lengthy review of each of the thirteen paragraphs of the last important letter
(September 7th) of Dr. McGregor, pronouncing Soani?s case to be chicken-pock, and condemning the manage-
ment of our Quarantine Station, I fear I should exceed the limits of official report. I cannot be held responsible
for the management of the Quarantine Station. Charges have been made on both sides, and denied ; the
North Head Station is at present in a transition stage with a partially new staff, and probably some of the
minute details animadverted upon were the result of inexperience, and are not likely to be repeated. At
the same time I am bound to state, in vindication of all concerned, that in my opinion the essential condi-
tions of quarantine were generally observed intact. It will be conceded that I have had the advantage of
some little experience in this matter, having been in charge of North Head and at Little Bay during the
late trying period, and the precautions adopted to prevent the spread of infection from these centres under
my immediate supervision having proved entirely successful.
I therefore do not consider myself addressed by Dr. M?Gregor as one ?inexperienced in quarantine,?
and whilst admitting the very excellent nature of his instructions in disinfecting, <fec. {vide paragraph 3), I
beg to say they are instructions with which I had been already familiar.
The Chief Medical Officer- at Fiji avers that ?it is neither necessary nor desirable that he should
analyse the whole system of quarantine carried out in connection with the ? Gunga? ? (paragraph 4). As I
quite agree with him here I feel sorry for his own consistency when he deems himself called upon to perform
the unnecessary and undesirable task of reproving the Health Officers for their ? faultyproceedings? (paragraph
7), enumerating ? examples of laxity and inefficiency? (paragraph 10), and ? drawing attention to the com-
plete inadequacy of the system pursued? in our quarantine arrangements (paragraph 13).
Respecting the specific charge made against me (paragraph 7) that ? those in quarantine saw the
Assistant Health Officer land and visit themselves about a week ago, then proceed to town, and return
again to the Quarantine Station in the same clothes on the same day,? I can only say that I did not do so,
and had I done so I could not have been seen from the Quarantine Station. Dr. McGregor has been misin-
formed, and the statement is erroneous throughout.
And now a word, in passing, as to Dr. McGregor?s views of Soani?s disease. I have purposely
avoided entering into controversy as to this case being one of chicken-pock or small-pox I can honestly
state I have endeavoured to give all the pros and cons most careful consideration; and I still hold?with a
dubious history and all the phenomena (objective and subjective) that I am aware of, I believe it is a case
of modified small-pox. As it is conceded the man suffered from one exanthem or the other, namely,
chicken-pock or small-pox, let us hear Dr. McGregor on the subject:?
? 2. Given an alleged case of a highly contagious disease, in the midst of a large community, the spread of the
disease, unless intelligent precautions are taken to prevent its dissemination, is the natural order of events.?
Surely this does not prove anything. It may be said in reply ; first, that the precautions adopted
in relation to the ? Gunga ? prevented the spread ; second, there are numerous cases on record (which Dr.
McGregor must remember) of solitary instances of small-pox occurring on board ship, in hospitals, and
private dwellings, in the midst of larger or smaller communities, and where precautions were or were not
observed ; only a day or two since I read of one such, namely, that of the second mate of the s.s. ? Garonne,?
on her homeward voyage ; and third, that assuming Dr. McGregor?s statement to be the correct one, and
Soani?s case to have been one of chicken-pock, a disease described by the best known writers as contagious
in a high degree, and which spreads both by means of the air and through the medium of formites, then
the dissemination of chicken-pock under identical conditions should be equally ?the natural order of
events.?
In law it may be a salutary precept to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt; in preventive
medicine were the patient to receive similar treatment, such practice would be fraught with the direst
mischief, and the most calamitous state of things must ensue.
On boarding the ?Gunga,? which arrived in port this morning, at 5-15 am., I found a note upon
the back of a bill of health written at Suva, by the Acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Bolton Glanvell
Oomey, to the following effect: ?
_ Varicella has been continuously epidemic in Suvu, Levuka, and other parts of the Colony for many years past.
Suva is never quite free from it, owing to the frequent arrival of new immigrant labourers from Melanesia. It is however
known to be occurring at present in several islands of the New Hebrides, Banks Islands, and Solomons.
I have had many hundreds of cases under observation, but have never known a fatal case. The eruption on a
coloured skin, especially if not very dark, becomes pustular after a few hours? duration and often scars. I have seen one
case of pitting in the face from it. The period of incubation is from twelve to sixteen days.
There are cases now in Suva. A case of measles occurred in Levuka on the 9th August last. It was isolated, and
assumed only a mild form. None have occurred since.
? There has never been a ease in Suva since 1876. No case of variola has ever occurred in this Colony.??B.G.C.,
16/9/82.


I have taken the liberty of italicising the part of this communication to which I wish to draw atten-
tion, and to say the eruption upon Soani?s skin has been stated by himself and others to have existed at the
time of my examination for sixteen hours (probably it had been there unnoticed for some time previously),
and that after this lapse of time it was not pustular, but, I repeat, vesicular and uniform. This fact you
can yourself corroborate, having examined the eruption and pricked the vesicles.
I find a record of cases presenting some very similar features to that of Soani reported in 1831 by
the late Dr. George Busby to the Inspector of Colonial Hospitals, Sydney. Dr. Busby was then, I believe,
upon the Civil Medical Staff of the Colony, and the cases he reports occurred amongst aboriginals in the
Bathurst district. He believed these cases to have been varicella, notwithstanding the existence of
extensive throat inflammation and constitutional disturbance, grave enough in some cases to cause death.
The too common occurrence of ? doctors differing,? has in no instance proved more frequent (either
in Europe or in the Colonies) than in deciding between mild cases of small-pox and severe cases of chicken-
pock. Opposite opinions claim each the support of high authorities and great names.
Fortunately, certitude of diagnosis is nowhere recognised as a pre-requisite to the enforcement of
quarantine provisions, and, so far as these provisions are believed to be inservient in excluding epidemics from
the community, it admits of no question that decisive and prompt action (in cases of even less dubious
character than that of Soani) deserves that aid and approval which it is pleasing to reflect have been
accorded in the case of the quarantine of the ? Gunga.?

Sir, Quarantine Station, North Head, 27 September, 1882.
I have the honor to report, for your information, that I have employed a considerable amount
of labour at this Station, in scrubbing and cleaning the houses in cabin enclosure lately occupied by the
? Gunga? cabin passengers, and I find that after more than an ordinary amount of labour expended upon
them, they are still in a state scarcely presentable for fresh occupation; it is therefore I think desirable
that they should undergo another course of cleansing.
Some of the rooms in these houses were left in a not to say slovenly, but filthy dirty condition, ?the
steward?s room in the house occupied by Sir A. Gordon and others was left in a dirty state, the verandah
outside being saturated with grease, in some instances ink has been spilt upon the pine tables, making it
very difficult indeed to give them anything like a. clean appearance ; a portion of the kitchen buildings
were also almost black with grease and dirt.
I have thought it desirable to furnish you with this report, in consequence of the extra amount of
labour which must needs be employed to fit the premises for further use.
I have, &c.,

Sir, 29 September, 1882.
I have the honor to report that the horsehair cushions used to sit and lie upon by the man
Soani, whilst on board s.s. ?Gunga,? were found by me, on the return of this vessel to Sydney, on 26th
instant, to have been retained in the saloon.
Captain Saunders told me, whilst ? Gunga? was in quarantine, that these cushions were burnt, in
obedience to my orders.
I find this is not the case, and I beg to say I do not consider the fumigation that these articles have
been subjected to by any means a sufficient precautionary measure against the spread of small-pox amongst
those on board ? Gunga,? and the persons with whom they may come in contact.
As the man Soani undoubtedly suffered from small-pox, in my opinion, it is only my duty to place
this statement on record. I am, &c.,

No. 144.
Petition from His Excellency Sir Artliur Gordon and Passengers, Officers, and
Members of the Crew of the s.s. ? Gunga.?
To His Excellency the Right Honorable Lord Augustus Loftus, G.C.8., of the Colony of New
South Wales, &c., &c., in Council.
May it please Your Excellency,?
The Petition of the undersigned Passengers, Officers, and Members of the Crew of the screw
steamship ? Gunga,? now in quarantine, humbly showeth, ?
2. That your Petitioners were, on Saturday, the twenty-sixth day of August last, placed in
quarantine, in consequence of the supposed appearance of a case of small-pox on board the said screw
steamship ? Gunga.?
3. That your Petitioners are fully alive to the utility and necessity of quarantine, and cheerfully
acquiesced in their temporary detention, under the belief that it was required for the protection of the Colony
of New South Wales from the introduction of a disease so formidable.
4. That your Petitioners cannot, however, consider that the further prolongation of their period of
quarantine is now requisite, although its imposition in the first instance may have been a wise precaution.
5.


5. That your Petitioners have arrived at the above conclusion, firstly, because they cannot bring
themselves to believe that adequate evidence exists to show the case which has led to the imposition of the
present quarantine to be really one of small-pox ; and secondly, because, if it were so, the quarantine in
force, although sufficiently irksome to your Petitioners and injurious to their interests, is not so enforced as
to effect its avowed objects.
6. That your Petitioners find it difficult to believe that the illness of the Pijian native, sent hence to
the hospital at Little Bay, is really small-pox, for the following reasons :
L No case of small-pox has ever yet occurred in Fiji, where a most rigid quarantine is main-
tained. When the ? Gunga? was last in Fiji, all vessels from Sydney were quarantined, in
consequence of a supposed case of small-pox at Sydney in July.
ii. Nevertheless, if the case be one of small-pox, it must' have commenced before the patient, who
had been for six weeks resident in Fiji, embarked at Suva,
hi. The course of the complaint appears unusually rapid for a case of small-pox. The patient was
quite well until the evening of Thursday the 24th August; he complained of feeling head-ache
and being generally unwell on Friday the 25th, and on inspection it appeared that an
eruption had broken out on his face and body. On Saturday the 26th this eruption was
pronounced by the Health Officer to be small-pox. On Sunday the 27th the patient was
very much better, and the eruption had already commenced to disappear. On Monday the
28th he was in most respects well. On Tuesday the 29th, a large part of the spots on his
person had vanished, and the remainder were going fast.
iv. There was an absence of many of the usual accompaniments of small-pox, such as vomiting,
pain in the back, vertigo, and some days of illness before the appearance of the eruption.
v. The eruption was recognised by the patient himself, by Major Knollys, and by other residents
of Fiji, as the common Fijian disease ? sui-sui,? and the patient?s own prediction that the
eruption would disappear in a few days has been fulfilled.
vi. This disease of ?sui-sui,? which has much apparent resemblance to small-pox (and has more
than once, in its early stages, been taken for it by experienced medical men), but which is in
fact a species of varicella, is endemic in Fiji.
vii. The patient has never previously had this disease of ? sui-sui.?
viii. The night before the patient left Levuka he slept at the house of a man whose brother, then
an inmate of the house, was at the time suffering from ? sui-sui.?
ix. The disease has run the normal course of a case of varicella.
x. One of the firemen of the ? Gunga,? who was in close communication with the patient, has
shown symptoms since being hero, which the Medical Superintendent, Dr. Day, has pro-
nounced to be decidedly those of varicella. He is now quite well.
xi. Not a single person of the large number?nearly 100?who were on board the ?Gunga? with
the patient has been attacked by small-pox, although many of them, including unvaccinated
children, were in communication with him, and although clothes daily handled by him have
been preserved and worn by one of those now in the enclosure.
xii. The patient was only seen once, and that for a very short time, by the Health Officer, Df.
Mackellar. That there is very great difficulty, in certain stages of the disease, in recognising
the difference between small-pox and chicken-pox, even by the most skilful practitioners, is
well known. That the symptoms were in this case not otherwise than ambiguous is shown
by various facts, viz. :
(a) The Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie, read aloud the note on the official Health Report
signed by the Captain of the ? Gunga,? to the effect that the symptoms were those of a ? mild
case of chicken-pox,? and assured Captain Saunders and some of your petitioners that in three
hours? time the ? Gunga? would be alongside the wharf : but that, as he had little experience
of natives, he did not like to take the responsibility of admitting the ship to pratique without
submitting the case to higher authority.
(I b ) Your petitioners have reason to believe that the resident medical officer at the small-pox hos-
pital does not regard the case to resemble any ordinary case of small-pox.
(c) The undoubted case of varicella at the Quarantine Station was at first considered by Dr. Beattie
to be small-pox..
7. Your petitioners do not consider that the quarantine has been so maintained as to render it
effective, because, ?
(i.) The Health Officer and Assistant Health Officer were in close contact with the patient and
passengers, but left the ? Gunga? without further precaution apparently than that of washing
their hands.
(ii.) Two of the crew of the Health Officer?s boat came on board the ? Gunga,? and entered into
conversation with the second officer.
(iii.) The Assistant Health Officer himself spent six hours consecutively on Saturday, the 26th
August, either on board the ? Gunga? or in the Quarantine Station, in the closest communi-
cation with the passengers, and especially with those who he was aware had been most
exposed to contagion if it existed, ?Sir A. Gordon and Major Knollys. On Sunday morning
he returned, in the same clothes, to the Quarantine Station, shook hands with Sir A. Gordon,
remained half-an-hour with him, and shook hands again at parting. He has several times
since been within the boundaries of the Station, and went to visit the patient suffering from
varicella, of whom mention has already been made. He still wears, outside the Station, the
same coat and white hat he wore when within the Quarantine limits.
(iv.) The mails from the ? Gunga? were sent up to Sydney without effective or sufficient fumiga-
tion, and the letters sent daily out of the Station were, until the last day or two, subjected
to a purification which has been merely formal.
(v.) The obvious precaution of vaccinating the children and adults among the passengers who are
unvaccinated, or have not been revaccinated since infancy, has not been taken.
(vi.) There is little or nothing to prevent those detained from communicating freely with visitors
from without, if so disposed, or even to prevent an excursion to Manly Beach.
8.


8. Your petitioners believe that in ordinary cases small-pox passes into its eruptive stage in about
twelve days, and that this stage is usually preceded by constitutional disturbance and illness. Your
petitioners have now passed twelve days in quarantine, and are all free, not only from any appearance of
eruption, but from any ailment or constitutional affection whatsoever.
9. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray your Excellency in Council that, taking into considera-
tion the grave doubt which, to say the least, must exist as to the nature of the case in question, they may
be relieved from a detention which is causing them most serious inconvenience, and in many cases, it is to
be feared, permanent loss and injury.
10. Your petitioners have some reason to believe that a fear has been expressed that, as one of those
detained in quarantine holds a high official position, the adoption of this course might be regarded by the
public as a concession to his influence.
11. Your petitioners most heartily agree that no unusual favour should be granted to them on
account of the presence among them of the officer in question, but they must at the same time deprecate
such a reason for the exercise of rigour which might not otherwise be deemed necessary.
12. Your petitioners are fully prepared to suffer personal inconvenience, if it be shown that it is
required for the benefit of the Colony, but they are reluctant to sacrifice their interests either to secure
official tranquillity or to satisfy those who may conceive their dignity diminished by the admission that a
mistake on their part (however pardonable and natural) is of possible occurrence.
13. Your petitioners, therefore, in face of the doubts reasonably cast upon the nature of the illness
of the Fijian native, supposed to have been attacked by small-pox, respectfully demur to being longer
detained on the dictum practically of two medical officers alone, whose inspection of the case was but of a
cursory nature, and one of whom has emphatically shown the difficulty of distinguishing between real
variola and varicella, by having expressed two different opinions at different times with respect to the case
in question, and who, in a case which has occured in this station, and which has been decidedly shown not
to be one of small-pox, was disposed to pronounce it that disorder.
14. What may have been the evidence on which the Board of Health has acted, and on the strength
of which they are detained, your petitioners are not aware. Those who heard and saw the examination of
the patient on board the ? Gunga??and it took place in the presence of nearly all the saloon passengers?
will not easily credit that its report alone will in the circumstances have been deemed sufficient. The
ailment from which the patient himself was firmly persuaded he was suffering has probably never been seen
by medical men who have not visited Fiji. The Chief Medical Officer of Fiji, who has had great experience
of it, is now in Sydney, but if the intelligence which has reached your petitioners be correct, he has not been
requested to furnish any information with respect to it, and his own application to be permitted to see the
patient has been refused.
15. Your petitioners therefore pray that, whether your Excellency in Council grants or does
not grant their first request, your Excellency will see fit to appoint a Commission to examine into all the
circumstances of the case, and the allegations of the present petition, and that your Excellency will appoint
such Commissioners, not from members of the Board of Health, who have already prejudged the case, but
from among independent and impartial persons, including medical men of repute from other Colonies.
16. Your petitioners append various documents in support of the different allegations made in the
course of their petition.

Copy of Affidavit.
I, Carl Ludwig Sahl, passenger per s.s. ? Gunga,? Fiji to Sydney, and at present at Quarantine Station, North Head,
make oath, and say: On Saturday morning, the twenty-sixth day of August, I was standing on the top of the companion
ladder of the s.s. ?Gunga,? when the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie, was about to leave the steamer for the purpose
of reporting to the Principal Health Officer. During the time that he was waiting for his boat to come alongside I spoke
to him and said, ? ? Doctor, if you are going to keep ns any time in quarantine will you see that some newspapers are sent
to us, as we have now been three weeks without news.? He replied, ?Oh yes; but you need not be under any apprehen-
sion, I have no doubt you will be released directly.? While I cannot swear positively to the exact words he used, I can
swear to his telling me that he thought we would be released directly, and he spoke so positively that he left no doubt in
my mind that we would be in Sydney before 12 o?clock. This impressed itself on my mind more particularly as I wished
to reach my office before 1 o?clock, and I knew that at least one of our fellow-passengers was anxious to be in Sydney
before the closing of the Banks at 12 o?clock.

I, Charles Edward Saunders, make oath and say : That on Saturday the twenty-sixth day of August last I was in
command of the screw steamship ? Gunga,? which that morning entered Sydney Harbour, and was about seven o?clock
a.m. boarded by the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie. Dr. Beattie filled up the answers to the questions on the
health report to my dictation, and I then signed it on the second page. Dr. Beattie then wrote on the third page a
report of his own, with respect to the case of slight sickness on board, of which I had informed him, and which he had
inspected. After he had finished writing, he read aloud to me what he had written. The report he read, stated the
symptoms of the illness to be those of ? a mild case of chicken-pox? : but that he hesitated to give pratique to the vessel
until the case had been referred to superior authority. On leaving the saloon, I asked Dr. Beattie how long we were likely
to be detained; he replied, only an hour or two, as the case was only one of chicken-pox, but that, as he was only
Assistant Health Officer, he was unwilling himself to assume the responsibility of admitting us to pratique.

Copy of Solemn Declaration.
I, the Honorable Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon, G.C.M.G., do solemnly declare that on Saturday, the twenty-sixth day of
August last, I was a passenger in the screw steam-ship ? Gunga.? We were boarded at the entrance of Sydney Harbour
by the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie. Soon after I went into the saloon, Dr. Beattie was writing something at the
table, I saw that he was writing something on the third page of a sheet of foolscap paper. I left the saloon again almost
immediately, after speaking to Major Knoflys, who was m his cabin opening out of it. When Dr. Beattie came out of the
saloon he was introduced to me, and told me that my servant was apparently suffering from an attack of chicken-pox, but
that, as he was not familiar with native patients, or the appearance oi eruptive deseases on the skin of natives, he did not
ike to take on himself the responsibility of admitting us to pratique without reference to the Health Officer. I was par-
ticularly struck by an expression which he used and of which I at once took mental note, to the effect that had the patient
been a white man, he would at once have admitted us to pratique, but that he had no experience of natives. He added that
he did not suppose our detention would extend two or three hours, and would almost certainly terminate when the report
was considered, making light altogether of the apprehensions I expressed that those not familiar with Fijian eruptive
diseases might be led to take a more serious view of the case. After our arrival at the Quarantine Station on the after-
noon of the same day, after the case had been officially declared small-pox, Dr. Beattie informed me he thought it probable
we should be released the following day or Monday, I replied, ?If it in any way depends on you, pray let it be to-morrow,
as we shall then still be able to catch the ? Rome.?
I did not myself read Dr. Beattie?s report, but its contents were mentioned to me before he left the vessel, and on
my reminding him of its terms, on Tuesday morning last, in the presence of Dr. Day and Captain Saunders, he fully
admitted that it was to the effect stated. ARTHUR GORDON,

I, William Kopsen, passenger per s.s. ? Gunga,? from Fiji to Sydney, and at present at Quarantine Station, make oath
and say: That on Saturday, the twenty-sixth day of August last, I was in the saloon of the s.s. ?Gunga,? when Dr.
Beattie, the Assistant Health Officer, entered it soon after 7 a.m. ; I saw him stand near the door of the saloon, talking to
Captain Saunders ; I overheard him say that we should be detained but a very short time in Quarantine, not more than a
few hours, as the case was, he believed, one of chicken-pox, but he was not willing to take upon himself the responsibility
of at once admitting us to pratique. W. KOPSEN.

belonging to the Health Officer?s boat was on board also, and entered into conversation with me about the fine state of the
bananas, looking down the ship?s hold at the time. In the morning when the Health Officer?s Assistant left the saloon one
of the passengers said we were only to be detained for two or three hours, as the doctor pronounced it a mild case of chicken-
pox. I also heard the third officer say that he saw some of the crew of the Health Officer?s boat on the poop.

I, Hector Kidd, make oath and say : That on Saturday, the twenty-sixth day of August last, I was a passenger on board
the steamship ? Gunga.? About 7a. m. I went to the table in the saloon to write a telegram. The Assistant Health
Officer, Dr. Beattie, was sitting on the opposite side of the table, and Captain Saunders standing on his left side;
Dr. Beattie was sitting exactly opposite to me writing something on a sheet of foolscap paper, and he used the same ink-
bottle as myself. When he had done writing, he read aloud to Captain Saunders what he had written. I heard what he
read. It was a report with respect to a sickness of a native on board, on whose person an eruption had appeared, the
symptoms of which were described by Dr. Beattie as those of a ?mild case of chicken-pox?; I remember these words
particularly, as I was paying great attention to what was read.
I afterwards asked Dr. Beattie how long we should be detained ; he repeatedly said we should be released as soon as
he had communicated with the Health Officer. I overheard Dr. Beattie in conversation with Captain Saunders at the
saloon door. I heard him say that he was very sorry to detain us at all, but that it was of no consequence, as we should
be alongside the wharf by ten or eleven o?clock.

passengers on board the screw steam-ship ?Gunga.? We were placed at the Quarantine Station at about 2'30 p.ra. As
wo walked up the hill from the beach to our quarters, I entered into conversation with Dr. Beattie, who was walking up
the hill alongside me, and who had previously informed me he was acquainted with my wife?s family. I expressed my
great vexation at our detention, as I knew Mrs. Nalder was in a delicate?in fact, critical?state of health. Ho said I
need be under no anxiety, as he thought it would be all right, and that we should in all probability be released in a day or
two. This was after the case had been formally declared to be one of small-pox.

Memorandum by Sir A. Gordon.
I have been asked to note some of the facts which have induced me in common with all my fellow passengers to form the
opinion that the quarantine here, is not enforced in such a manner, as to be of practical utility. The task is an invidious
one, and I should much prefer to confine myself to the strong expression of my conviction, based on no slight grounds, that
such is the case.
I will not publicly give information which might on the one hand expose generally deserving officials to blame or
dismissal, or might on the other hand render individuals among my fellow passengers liable to heavy fines or prolonged
imprisonment. I think, however, I may state, without risk of injuring any one, that I have myself seen two ladies and five
children separated from the gentlemen they came to visit only by a narrow nil of water. The party remained in this
contiguity the greater part of the day, making a fire and lunching on the spot. Ido not believe that any absolute breach
of the quarantine took place, but that it did not is due wholly to the honour of the parties, not to any supervision on their
proceedings.
I was myself introduced to the ladies, and heard, though I did not myself see, that another gentleman was meeting
his wife a little higher up the stream equally unwatched.
It is also within my own knowledge that one gentleman walked the greater part of the way to Manly to meet his
family, while another states, I believe with truth, that he has been at Manly himself. Other cases have been mentioned
to me, and the appended note from Mr. Harris of Tavuiui written at my request with respect to what occurred to him
yesterday, shows how easily the boundary may be innocently crossed, even without any desire to evade a vigilance, which
does not exist. To anyone who has such a desire its gratification would be easy.
But the repeated transgressions of the Assistant Health Officer, Dr. Beattie, are of themselves sufficient to rende
further attempts at isolation useless.
To say nothing of his first and second visits to the ? Gunga, ? from which he took letters and telegrams, he remained
the third time he came, either on board the ?Gunga ? or in this station for six hours in the closest communication with the
passengers and especially with myself and Major Knollys, although I had told him that from Soani s attendance on us,
and his handling of all our clothes up to that morning, we were the most likely of all persons to have caught the infection
if it existed. Having been accustomed to a very different system of quarantine, I confess it was with some astonishment
that I saw him leave us that night; but it was with still greater astonishment that I saw him next morning in the verandah
i fmy quarters, felt him shake hands with me, a ceremony which he repeated at parting, and engaged with him in a con-
versation of considerable length.
On the following day he again came into the quarantine ground and up the hill; but on this occasion he did not
enter our quarters or shake hands. He conversed with me, with one of the ladies among the passengers, with Dr. Day,
Captain Saunders, and two or three others. The same thing was repeated on Tuesday, when he again conversed with me,
Mr. Kidd, and others. Since that day he has not been inside the station, except once when he came into the quarters to
see the patient with symptoms of chicken-pox, which he was disposed to consider small-pox. He wears the same brown
coat and white hat outside the station which he has worn within it. If we are kept in quarantine, Dr. Beattie should
certainly be placed in it. He is at least as much a suspected person as any of our number.

Sir, Quarantine Station, September, 1882.
Yesterday afternoon as I was bathing in the creek near the boundary line, a man came along the beach from
Manly, and was very astonished when I told him to go back, as 1 was in quarantine. A short time afterwards two other
strangers came along from the same direction with the intention, I believe, of bathing in the creek. On my warning them
off as they were approaching, they said, ? Our boat then must be in quarantine.?

The Health Officer, Sydney, to The Under Secretary for Finance and Trade.
Sir, Sydney, 11 September, 1882.
Herewith I have the honor to return the petition from the inmates of the Quarantine Station
and the various documents attached.
I have carefully noted the arguments advanced by the petitioners (who are not medical men, and
therefore not competent to understand the subject) to prove that the disease from which the Fijian, Soani,
is suffering is not variola but a disease peculiar to Fiji, called ? sui sui,? which they say has ? much resem-
blance to small-pox? I desire to state in answer that I gave Dr. McGregor, the Chief Medical Officer of
Fiji, for whose opinion I have a most profound respect, an accurate account of the history, signs, and
symptoms of the case, and that he said that no course was open to me but to place the vessel in quarantine,
that he would have acted similarly himself. True, he afterwards said that the subsequent history of the
course taken by the disease should make mo modify my opinion ; but that I was unable to do, for I was
fully alive to the fact that small-pox in vaccinated persons often follows an abortive course; and I could see
nothing in this case which was incompatible with the view that this was one of the ? modified? cases.
The insinuation that I made only a cursory examination is disingenuous in the extreme. I made a
very careful examination, and was unwillingly led to the conclusion that the patient suffered from modified
small-pox
Regarding the request contained in the last paragraph of the petition, viz., that a commission shall
be appointed to inquire into the case, to be selected ? not from members of the Board of Health who
have already prejudged the case, but from among independent and impartial persons, including medical
men from other colonies,? I think that I need hardly give an opinion.
I have, Ac.,
CHARLES K. MAOKELLAR,
Health Officer.
Herewith is a letter from the Health Officer (82/10/114) to whom the petition and accompanying
papers have been referred. Under the consolidated opinions of the Health Officers and the Board of
Health, who are quite aware of all the facts of the case, the term of quarantine cannot, in my opinion, be
shortened. The request to appoint a Commission and inquire into the facts cannot be granted. Such a
course is without precedent, and the Government are quite satisfied with the reports of their responsible
officers.?J.W., 12/9/82. The Private Secretary.?G.E., 8.C., 12/9/82.

The Private Secretary iS desired by His Excellency the Governor to acknowledge the receipt on
Saturday, the 9th September, of a Petition (with the papers) addressed to the Governor by His Excellency
Sir Arthur Gordon, and passengers, officers, and members of the screw steamship ? Gunga,? now in
quarantine,?and in reply to inform them that His Excellency immediately forwarded it to the Colonial
Secretary. The Private Secretary is now instructed by His Excellency to enclose to Sir Arthur Gordon
and the Petitioners copy of a letter from the Health Officer, with a minute from the Colonial Treasurer, in
reply to the request submitted in the Petition.*

Sir Arthur Gordon to His Excellency the Governor.
My Lord, Quarantine Station, Sydney, 15 September, 1882.
I have the honor, on behalf of the passengers by the s.s. ? Gunga,? ns well as of the officers and
crew of that vessel, to acknowledge the receipt of an intimation, conveyed through your Excellency?s Private
Secretary, that the Colonial Government declines to comply with the prayer of our petition of the 7th
instant.
I regret to trouble your Excellency with any further correspondence on this subject, but the con-
tents of the communication in question make it impossible for me to avoid addressing some additional
remarks to your Excellency.
Of the two main questions raised by our petition, the most important, and that which most nearly
concerns the public interest, is the efficiency or the reverse of the present system of quarantine. That it is
the desire and the intention of the Government and of the medical authorities that it should afford adequate
protection to the community, admits of no question; and if it be in fact defective, it may safely be presumed
that this is owing to circumstances of which the Health Office is not cognisant, or over which it has no
control. The
* The ? letter ? and ? minute ? referred to, are the two preceding documents.


The points on which the quarantine in force during the period of our detention has appeared to
myself and my fellow-passengers to be open to improvement, are chiefly the following :
1. The want of sufficient precautions to secure respect for the boundaries of the Station, whether
from within or from without.
2. The imperfect disinfection of articles sent out of the Station.
3. The risk of contagion involved in the indiscreet action of the Assistant Health Officer.
4. The non-vaccination of unvaccinated persons in quarantine.
1. Until the Quarantine Station is enclosed by some species of fence, its boundaries will be often
passed in absolute ignorance that they have been so; while, unless those boundaries are patrolled, it will
never be very difficult to evade them. I have no doubt that the limits of the Station have been inadver-
tently crossed by many, if not most of us; and I have as little doubt that they have by some been delibera-
tely and wilfully transgressed. lam myself aware that at least three of our number have visited the
village of Manly; but it would be impossible to adduce actual proof of this, unless an assurance were
given that the parties concerned would not be criminally proceeded against. With such an assurance many
tongues would probably be unloosed.
2. During the last few days greater precautions have been observed with respect to the disinfection
of articles sent out of the Station, but during the earlier part of our stay I have been a frequent witness of
the wholly formal and unreal character of the operation.
3. Dr. Beattie?s repeated visits to the Station have been already mentioned in a memorandum
attached to our petition to your Excellency. How often Dr. Beattie may have been within the Quarantine
Ground since the date of that memorandum Ido not know. I passed close to him yesterday morning, as he
was standing outside the store within the Station. That his brown woollen overcoat and white hat would
not be the less active agents in the dissemination of infection, because worn by a member of the medical
profession, it is needless to observe.
4. On Friday last, after we had been detained all but a fortnight, a number of those persons who
had not been re-vaccinated since infancy underwent vaccination, but there is still an unvaccinated child in
the enclosure.
The question whether or no the case, on account of which quarantine was in this instance imposed,
was or was not small-pox, is one of far less interest to the public, and, now that the period of our detention
has so nearly terminated, is of little practical importance to ourselves; nevertheless there is one aspect of
this question also which, on public grounds, I venture to think merits some attention.
It admits, I think, of no doubt that the Health Officers only performed a plain duty in placing the
?Gunga? in quarantine. It is far better, in a matter of such grave importance, that the medical officers
should err, if they err at all, in a too rigid performance of their functions, than that they should, through
any laxity on their part, afford opportunity for the introduction into the Colony of so infectious and fatal
a disease as small-pox. It is far better that a small number of persons should be exposed to even unneces-
sary inconvenience, than that the community at large should be exposed to so terrible a danger.
For my own part, I can safely say, and I believe I only echo the sentiments of my fellow-passengers,
that I felt not the slightest reluctance to submit cheerfully to whatever amount of quarantine might be
deemed requisite; but at the same time it should not be forgotten that the only thing which justifies the
imposition of the harsh restrictions of quarantine is the supposition of their necessity, and that, consequently,
any allegation calculated to throw a doubt on that necessity is entitled to demand a hearing, and to receive
the most careful and dispassionate examination.
In the present case I am far from presuming to assert with confidence that the case was not one of
small-pox ; but it has been clearly shown that it was antecedently improbable that it should be so, no case
of small-pox having ever been known to occur in Fiji; while, on the other hand, it has been also shown to
be highly probable that a native of Fiji should be attacked by an eruptive disease endemic in that group?
a disease which Dr. M?Gregor (for whose opinion the Health Officer professes ? most profound respect ?)
says ? often simulates modified small-pox,? and to the contagion of which the patient in this case had been
specially exposed. It has been also shown that this probability is strengthened by the course of the
disease itself, by the absence of many of the usual symptoms of small-pox, and by the fact that while of the
very large number of persons exposed to the contagion not one has shown any symptoms of small-pox, an
eruptive disease has appeared on the person of one of those in close communication with the patient, which
admittedly is not variola, although at first presenting many suspicious symptoms of that disease.
To these facts may now be added the arrival of the s.s. ?Suva,? which left Fiji on the 3rd
instant, up to which date no single case had occurred there. If Soani?s illness therefore be small-pox, he
must have received the contagion from a source which has communicated it to no other person in Fiji,
while he himself has not communicated the infection to any of his fellow-passengers on board the
? Gunga??a coincidence extremely unlikely to occur.
On the other hand, it is answered that the Health Officer and Assistant Health Officer, on inspection
of the patient, pronounced him to be suffering from small-pox
Whichever view is taken of the case, the admission of circumstances in themselves improbable is
involved. If it be one of small-pox, the series of improbabilities above enumerated must be faced.
It is, no doubt, also improbable that experienced medical men should be mistaken in their
recognition of small-pox; but it admits of positive proof that already on a previous occasion the Fijian
eruption referred to has by competent medical authority been taken for small-pox; and as the Health
Officers of Sydney, I am confident, make no pretension to an infallibility which the ablest of their profession
would be the first to disclaim, it cannot be considered as absolutely impossible for such a mistake to be
again made, more especially when it is remembered that the medical officers in question had never seen a
case of the Fijian eruption referred to, and that their examination was necessarily short, and therefore less
satisfactory than had more ample opportunities of observation been afforded?such as have, for example,
been enjoyed by the medical attendant at Little Bay. I stood by during the progress of the examination,
and am confident that the questions put were imperfectly comprehended by the patient, and the answers
given were not much more clearly understood.
65 ?H What


What in these circumstances, and having regard to this balance of improbabilities, we have ventured
to ask is, that some further investigation should take place. What we are practically told, is that the disease
having been pronounced by the Health Officers on their first examination to be one of small-pox, no further
question or argument is admissible.
I cannot but consider that this course shows an inadequate apprehension of the fact that a detention,
which imposes serious, and in some cases irreparable, loss on those subjected to it, becomes an intolerable
grievance, if not absolutely required for public safety. If this be recognized, it follows, as of course, that
any allegations questioning that necessity should be carefully weighed and inquired into, and, if possible,
satisfactory proof afforded to those detained that they are not detained unjustly. The Health Officer
describes the petitioners as ?unable to understand the question,? because they do not happen to be medical
men.
Without discussing whether medical training is requisite to enable men to appreciate evidence even
of a technical character, or to perceive whether the isolation of the Quarantine Station is or is not maintained,
it may be enough to say that Dr. M?Gregor, for whose opinion the Health Officer professes so ?profound? a.
? respect,? perused and approved our petition before it was submitted to your Excellency ; and the reasons
which appear to the Health Officer to be not worthy even of notice, appeared to that very accomplished
physician to cast the greatest doubt, to say the least, on the nature of the disease.
1 append the copy of a letter from Dr. M?Gregor to the Colonial Secretary, which will show how
completely he is misrepresented, if it be attempted to deduce any expression of his belief in the case being
one of small-pox from his admission that, under the suspicious circumstances of the case, the quarantine of
the ? Gunga? was a perfectly proper measure, ?an admission which all detained here heartily reecho.
The point in this case, which involves a public interest, and to which I therefore desire to -call your
Excellency?s attention, is this:?Whether when quarantine has under suspicious circumstances been
imposed, its continuance is to depend solely on the original dictum of the Health Officer, and all subsequent
representations are to be at once set aside without examination, simply because they may seem to be at
variance with it, or whether representations made are to be listened to and considered ; Whether the requests
of the sanitary officials of other Colonies, deeply interested in the result, to be permitted to make themselves
acquainted with the details of the case, are to be complied with, or refused with a peremptoriness hardly
consistent with courtesy. Had it not been for the correspondence which has taken place, I should have
considered that the startling statement made by the Assistant Health Officer, ?in my presence and that of
others, ?to the effect that when an official opinion on the case had been once pronounced, no consideration
whatever, even if it were erroneous, would cause it to be retracted, ?was the careless utterance of a gentleman
not remarkable for exact accuracy of expression.
But it must be confessed that some colour has been given to this allegation by recent correspondence.
Indeed (were such a supposition possible), it would almost appear from the letter of Dr. Macgregor, of which
I append a copy, that no medical reason existed in the mind of the Health Officer against our earlier release;
and that our detention to the very latest period is rather intended as a punishment for our having dared to
criticise the arrangements of the Station and call in question the decision of the medical officers, than as a
necessary measure of protection to the public.
In the reply of the Health Officer to the petition, no notice whatever is taken of the allegations with
respect to the observance of quarantine. I cannot think that they are disposed of by a sneer at our want of
medical knowledge, or by an assurance that the Government is satisfied with its officers.
There may be some signatures attached to the petition which may not be well known to your
Excellency ; but I venture to hope that my own, and that of Mr. Sahl, even if they stood alone, would
afford a sufficient guarantee that the allegations to which they are attached are not made lightly, or with-
out a sense of the responsibility which falls on those making them. They may, indeed, be dismissed by
the Health Officers, and the Beard of Health without inquiry, as unworthy of consideration, but I must
confess to a doubt whether that view will be adopted by the community at large.
In conclusion, it affords me the greatest satisfaction to be able to assure your Excellency that the
arrangements made for the comfort and convenience of those detained in quarantine on the present occa-
sion deserve the highest commendation; and that beyond the deprivation of liberty, I and my fellow
passengers have not only no reason to complain, but have much cause to be grateful for the courtesy and
attention of the officials connected with the Station, and for the accommodation which has been afforded us.

[ Enclosure .]
Dr. McGregor to The Colonial Secretary.
Sir, Sydney, G September, 1882.
You may perhaps be aware that the s.s. ? Gunga,? on her last arrival here from Fiji, was put in quarantine on
account of an alleged case of small-pox on beard that vessel, and, when I point out to you my connection with Fiji, the
serious results that may arise to that cohny in this and other Australasian ports in connection with the above case, and the
strong reasons that exist for doubting that the case is one of small-pox, I trust that you will pardon my addressing you on
the subject, and that you will grant me the request I have the honor to make, that I maybe permitted to visit and examine
the patient said to suffer from small-pox.
? 2. For more than seven years I have been and still am, Chief Medical Officer of Fiji. I had proceeded as far as
Melbourne on the s.s. ?Rome,? on my way to England, on leave of absence, when I heard of this case of alleged small-pox
from Fiji, and I deemed it my duty to discontinue my voyage and return here in order to ascertain whether the case is one
of small-pox or not, as on the former supposition my duty would be to return to Fiji as soon as possible.
3. In the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday last it is stated, in a paragraph that unquestionably reads as if based
?on official authority, that there is no reason to doubt that the case is one of genuine small-pox. If that dogmatic state-
ment is allowed to go forth to the world without qualification or contradiction, it can hardly be supposed but that vessels
coming from Fiji to Sydney, and the regular steam traders from that colony to Victoria and New Zealand will be subjected
without fail to processes of disinfection, and probably to tedious quarantine, which will result in much loss to Fijian
shippers of perishable goods, and in great inconvenience and expense to passengers.
4.


4. An impartial consideration of the following points will, I venture to think, be deemed sufficient to show that
there must exist grave doubts that the case is one of small-pox.
[a.) For more than a year previous to proceeding last to Fiji the patient, a man of the native race of that country
named Soani, has resided in New .Zealand. About two months ago he went to Fiji in H.M.S. ? Miranda? by
way of Tonga, and by the'last voyage of the ?Gunga? arrived here from that Colony. There had not been
any case of small-pox on the ?Miranda? at Tonga, norat Fiji. But as Soani had been about six weeks in
Fiji, and the eruption on his skin appeared from about four to six days after he left that country, it follows
that if Soani suffers from small-pox he must have contracted the disease in Fiji, where there has never, so
far as is known, been small-pox ashore, and only some three or four mild cases on board ships in quarantine
more than three years ago.
(J.) Chicken-pox, adiseasethat in some respects often simulates modified small-pox, is very common in Fiji. Soani
never before had chicken-pox, but the night before he left Levuka he slept with a man who was then covered
by the eruption of that disease.
(c) The eruption on Soani was recognized by himself as that of chicken-pox; it was also identified by Major
Knollys, who has seen some thirty or forty cases of the disease among the Armed Native Constabulary of Fiji,
when stationed at such a distance from a medical officer that Major Knollys had himself to observe and treat
all cases of sickness. lam told on reliable authority that Dr. Beattie, on examining Soani on his arrival in
port here, said that the disease was chicken-pox, and added that the ? ? Gunga? would be alongside the wharf
in less than three hours.
{d.) Soani?s illness has run, as far as I can learn, the normal and ordinary course of a case of chicken-pox.
(e.) I believe that the medical officer, under whose care Soani now is, has not pronounced the case to be one of
small-pox, but has confined himself to saying that the eruption ? most resembles? modified small-pox.
5. As an experience of ten years duration has familiarized me with the appearances of cutaneous eruptions on coloured
people, and as I have seen and treated some hundreds of cases of chicken-pox in Fijians and other natives of Polynesia, I
should, were I permitted to examine Soani, probably be able to satisfy myself whether the disease is small-pox or chicken-
pox, and my opinion would probably have some influence with the Health Officers of Melbourne and Auckland, and enable
them to determine, without attaching undue weight to the statement made in the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday
last, referred to above, what steps should be taken with reference to steam-vessels arriving from Fiji in those ports, if the'
expression of my opinion could not induce the authorities here to reconsider the whole case, which must; now that its
history has been elicited, and its course watched, present itself in a somewhat different light from that in which it was first
dealt with.
G. In requesting permission to visit Soani, I may state that I have been exposed to the contagion of small-pox during
a long extended epidemic, in which I treated many patients without contracting the disease myself ; and I was recently
successfully vaccinated.
7. In conclusion, I may state that had the case of Soani been regarded as a doubtful case, instead of being publicly
stated to be an absolute case of small-pox, I should not have occupied your time by this communication, as, so long as the
case was regarded as doubtful, vessels arriving from Fiji in other Australasian ports would have been dealt with each on its
own merits, a result hardly to be looked for in the face of the absolute decision that appears to have been arrived at here in
the case of Soani, a decision that is tantamount to saying that there is small-pox in Fiji.
I have, &c.,
W. McGEEGOR,
Chief Medical Officer, Fiji*
Extract from letter from Dr. McGregor to Sir A. Gordon.
My dear Sir, Saturday morning, 2 September.
- Er. Mackellar has said that, as far as he is concerned, if nothing adverse turns up, you will be set at liberty on
Saturday or Sunday next, in time to join the ?Clyde? at Melbourne by going overland by special train.
So far, then, I have done all that I can hope to effect.
I told Dr. Mackellar I intended to go on Tuesday as far as Victoria. The principal considerations'that have brought
about this state of matters are : ?
(1.) The endemic nature of chicken-pox in Fiji.
(2.) The fact that Soani never had chicken-pox before.
(3.) That he slept the night before he left Levuka with a man covered with varicella eruptions.
(4.) That Soani?s disease has run the normal course of a case of varicella.
(5.) That there was no small-pox in Fiji in the ? Miranda,? nor in New Zealand.
(G.) That Soani was not in contact with the passengers to Fiji by the ?Gunga,? and bad not time to develop the
disease if caught on the ? Gunga.?
I do not suppose that Drs. Beattie and Mackellar will themselves directly admit that it was chicken-pox.
No. 147.
The Health Officer, Sydney, to The Under-Secretary for Pinance and Trade.
Sir, Health Office, Sydney, 2 October, 1882.
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter dated from the Quarantine Station, upon
the 15th September, bearing the signature of the Honorable Sir Arthur Gordon, G.C.M.G., and addressed
to His Excellency the Governor of New South Wales, and in explanation I desire to say, for the information
of the Honorable the Colonial Treasurer, ?
1. That the efficiency of the Quarantine has for some time past engaged my most earnest attention, and
that after searching inquiry I have been unable to satisfy myself that any such serious infringement of the law
as the visit of any of the quarantined people to the village of Manly took place during the period of detention
of the passengers and crew of the s.s. ? Gunga.? I must confess that one statement contained in Sir Arthur
Gordon?s letter fills me with astonishment. I will quote it at length :?? lam myself aware that at least
three of onr number have visited the village of Manly, but it would be impossible to adduce actual proof
of this unless an assurance be given that the parties concerned would not be criminally proceeded against.*
I presume that Sir Arthur Gordon means to say that he has heard a rumour to that effect, and not that
the occurrence actually took place with his own knowledge, for surely there could be no difficulty in
bringing the culprits to justice, if it is actually within the knowledge of a gentleman, who is himself a high
judicial functionary, that such a violation of the law of the land took place.
2. The question of the disinfection of letters, the only articles sent from the Quarantine Station, is dealt
with in my communication, dated 11th September, to which I have the honor to ? refer you, while
the statement that vaccination was neglected is shown to be inaccurate by the same letter and by
the report of Dr. Day, the Medical Superintendent, dated 13 September. At an early date I trust I shall
be able to lay before you an exhaustive report upon the whole subject of Quarantine, which will embody
some suggestions as to alterations necessary to be made at the Station at North Head, the establishment of
an auxiliary station at Broken Bay, which will also serve as a lazarette for the city of Newcastle, and the
formation of a code of regulations for the guidance of the officers of the department, which latter I consider
to be of paramount importance. (3.)


3. It is with some satisfaction that I note that Sir Arthur Gordon acknowledges that ?it admits
of no doubt that the Health Officers only performed a plain duty in placing the ? Gunga? in quarantine.
In this matter I quite agree with him. J also agree with Dr. McGregor ? that it was my duty ?tokeej
them there unless I could satisfy myself by the subsequent history that the case was not one of small-pox.?
But I totally disagree with the insinuation implied in Sir Arthur Gordon?s letter,-that I should bp able to
account for not only the source of contagion, but also for all the antecedent improbabilities of the case.
4. I wish to draw your attention to the following quotation from the report of Dr. Lewers, the
Medical Superintendent of the Small-pox Hospital:?? I was at first inclined to think that the disease was
very rapid for variola, but on further watching the clinical history I could see no reason for considering the
case anything but a normal one of variola modified by a previous successful vaccination.?
5. With regard to the extract from Dr. McGregor?s letter to Sir Arthur Gordon, I desire to observe
that it is of a somewhat misleading nature. I said that, so far as I was concerned, they might be released
after fourteen days, but that unless the Health Board recommended that the period of quarantine should
be shortened, it would be the usual twenty-one days. This I reiterated to Sir Arthur Gordon, in. the
presence of Dr. Beattie, Sergeant Hawkins, and others.
Dr. McGregor is not justified in assuming that his elaborate arguments, urging the possibility of the
case being one of Sui Sui, influenced me in this matter, as I repeatedly said that I named fourteen days as
the shortest possible period of quarantine, as it was the supposed limit of the incubatory stage of small-pox.
? 6. I beg to draw your attention to the singular want of accord in Dr. McGregor?s letter to the
Colonial Treasurer, dated September 8, and the extract from his letter to Sir Arthur Gordon, dated
September 2. In the former he says ? I must point out to you that both yourself and the Board of Health
seem to misapprehend my object in concerning myself with the case of Soani; the resolution of the Board
would lead one to infer that I took exception to Soani?s case being dealt with, as regards detention in
quarantine, as if he suffered from small-pox,? and further on ? I ask for no modification of the quarantine,?
while in his letter to Sir Arthur Gordon, of September 2, he says ? You will be set at liberty on Saturday
or Sunday next, in time to join the ? Clyde? at Melbourne, by going overland by special train. So far
then I have done all I can hope to effect.?
7. In conclusion, I desire to observe that, having in view Sir Arthur Gordon?s dictum that ?it admits
of no doubt that the Health Officer performed a plain duty in placing the vessel in quarantine,? I cannot
refrain from saying that his criticisms are of a somewhat captious nature, and singularly at variance with
the statement that he ? felt- not the slightest reluctance to submit cheerfully to whatever amount of
quarantine might be deemed requisite.?

Health Officer and Medical Adviser to the Government of Hew South Wales.
