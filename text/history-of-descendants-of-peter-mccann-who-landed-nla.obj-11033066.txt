HISTORY OF DESCENDANTS
OF
PETER Mc CANN
WHO LANDED IN AUSTRALIA IN 1799
AND
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
THE CEMENT INDUSTRY
AND ITS
DEVELOPMENT IN VICTORIA.




FOREW0RD.
During my Father, Peter McCann's lifetime I
assisted him in recording the experiences appertaining to his
Grandfather, Peter McCann 1799-1806, his Father Nicholas McCann
1803-1880, and himself 1828-1908 related in the following pages*
Most of it was v/ritten hy my Father personally and the remainder
hy me at his dictation* I regret that he was not able to
complete the events up to the time of his death. At his death
the document from which most of these events are recorded came
into my hands, and I have endeavoured to fill in the gap from
where he finished up to the time of his death. To do this I
have had to trust to my memory, with the help of other members
of the family o
Having set out the early records and added the
later History relating to the establishment of the Cement
Industry at Geelong, I feel it will be a matter for the younger
members of the different branches to continue the history in
the various sections of the family, and thus the complete story
of an old pioneering family will be continued and not be
forgotteno
W. B. McCANN,
1943*


PREFACE.
Although every man, to a very great extent, is the
architect of his own fortune, there are many things over which he can
have no control and for which he has no responsibility; such as, the
country of his birth, the character of his parentage, hereditary dis-
advantages, his early environment, and the neglect of his education.
What he can do is to make the best of the talents given him, and
strive to make the most of the circumstances in which his life is set*,
Man seems to be poised betvi/een the animal Kingdom and
the Heaven of the Angels, He may descend to the level of the animal
or he may rise to the heights of an Angel, To use another and more
terse simile, he may be born mud, yet die marble.
For my part, I had only one advantage with which to
begin life and that was a good physical hereditary - plenty of brawn
but little brain. My only apology for writing this record of my life
and experiences is as followss-
Just as man is always anxious to find the sources of
great rivers, the beginning of great fortunes, the founding of great
nations and cities, and Indeed, the origin of everything, so I feel
Impelled to write these few facts concerning my somewhat eventful life*
I feel that the story will at least be Interesting to the members of
my own family when I have passed away. As the facts of my life are
known only to me they would unless recorded, die with me.
In the writing of this record, I confess to being
actuated by a little vanity. Another reason is the fact that I am,
I believe, the oldest Victorian Colonist at the time of writing, and
having assisted, personally, and through my parents in laying the
foundation of this great Commonwealth, I do not wish to become totally
forgotten, I also want to make it plain that I have no desire to
!? Cry my own Wares”, but, merely to record a phase of early Victorian
history in which I played a part and which I think is sufficiently
interesting to be recorded.
HISTORIA.
As nearly as I can calculate* my Grandfather, Peter McCann
landed in Australia (then New Holland) in the year 1799; and I believe
my Grandmother came out in the same Ship*, He was a man of splendid
physique a
He was six feet three Inches in height, stout in
proportion, and vi/eighed sixteen stone. As my Grandmother would say,
he was as straight as his own ram-rod.
The Governor evidently realized that he had in him the
makings of a good colonist; as he selected him along with others, to
till and work a large area of land. Under the bounty system then
existing, ho was provided with implements, provisions, seed and cattle
until such time as he could make the land yield a reti^rn.


Whether any special affection had manifested itself between
my Grandparents up to this time, I am not in a position to say, hut it
seems fairly evident that their marriage synchronised with my Grand-
fathers first efforts as a colonist.
My Father described my Grandmother in terms of never-
ending praise. She v/as his beau-ideal of a wife and mother. It is
clearly evident that she was a frugal and industrious wife and an
affectionate mother. Because of the fact that my Grandmother had
been brought up to farm life and my Grandfather being a man possessed
of great physical strength, activity, and of a great capacity for
industry, together with the high price obtained for their produce,
they quickly began to prosper in life.
Their success, however, seems to have been short-lived,
for v/hen my Father could not have been more than three years old, my
Grandfather in crossing a narrow log bridge over a creek in high flood,
missed his footing and was drowned. By this sudden and unfortunate
accident my Grandmother was left a ?;idow with two little children,
my Father, Nicholas McCann being the eldest.
At this point of our family history an incident occurred
that made a great change in the later life of my Father and his family.
My Grandfather's closest friend seems to have been John Norris, a stone
mason who had opened a Monumental and Builders Yard in the Main Road
betv;een Parramatta and Sydney. Norris had become my Father's
Godfather, and as he had become sponsor for him, he must have adopted
my Father at a very early age. John Norris seems to have been a
splendid tradesman - sober. Industrious, methodical. He seems, too,
to have had the capacity for making money, and, at the same time, the
ability to take care of it - a principle not adopted by many in
those early days of colonization,
John Norris did not marry until late in life and then to a
lady of his own age. He had no family of his own and probably,
because of this his chief object in life was to make a man of young
Nicholas. Father was a mechanical genius, and in knowledge and
ability soon outstripped John Norris, So much so that the older man
would often say with groat pride, when referring to Father - l? I confess
I must give the boy best.”
At twenty years of age my Father Y/as six feet two inches in
height and weighed thirteen stone, and, to use his own phrase -
’’Without as much fat as would lubricate the eye of a needle”.
About this time my Father started business on his own
account. He tendered for a contract of considerable size, but the
proprietors objected, despite a guarantee by Mr, Norris for the
security of the account, because of Father's youth. This reflection
on my Father so hurt the pride of Mr. Norris that he at once offered to
place money to the amount of the contract in the local bank, as a
guarantee that the work would be completed according to specifications.

My Father married my Mother the following year. Her
maiden name was Catherine Johnstone and she was a Stepdaughter of
Mr, John Beal, who was Managing Clerk to the McArthur family. The
members of this family can rightly be called the founders of “The
Colony*', because of the large sums of money which they spent on the
purchase and introduction of pure bred stock, and in this way estab-
lished the great Australian Sheep Industry,
My Mother was a member of the Church of England and was
the leading singer in the Church Choir* It seems that in my Father’s
eyes these circumstances added greatly to her attractiveness and charm,
qualities which in my Father’s estimation at any rate, she possessed to
a very high degree. It is evident that my Mother possessed many
excellent qualities and her death created an aching void in my Father’s
life that he was never able to fill. Their marriage was a happy one
and from this happiness my Father drew the Inspiration which was
reflected in the energy. Industry, and ambitions which characterised
his life r s work.
He was an excellent tradesman, taking great pride in the
execution of his contracts: as a result of these qualifications, plus
the high prices ruling in those early times, my Father soon began to
Improve his position and to spread out to larger dimensions in trade.
Notwithstanding these favourable circumstances my Father always seemed
to be what people call an unfortunate man, I would like to say too,
that I personally do not believe in good or bad luck. Rather do I
believe that every man, by the blessing of God, is the architect of
his own future. Apparently, my Father though bejewelled with many
gifts, could not have been an all-round, strong character. To use a
nautical simile, “while carrying a vast amount of sail there seems to
have been a shortage in the proper amount of ballast.”
As I grew up I became my Father’s dearest friend and most
confidential companion. Being of a more thoughtful, subdued and quiet
turn of mind, I thought that my Father’s weak point was want of caution.
He too easily became over-elated with success. If he got what he
called al good slice of luck one day, he seemed to think that the next
day would bring him a continuance of fortune and much more abundantly.
But my Readers (if anyone should take the trouble to read
these rambling lines) will think I have got off the track and become
derailed as it were. So to return to the point at which I seemed to
fly off at a tangents my Father, flushed with his first success became
determined, to use his own parlance, to go in for “big licks”. He was
able to estimate the great prospective value of the splendid freestone
quarries on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, and was determined to
secure as much as possible of this valuable frontage, which has since
been a mine of wealth and ?/hich has supplied most valuable building
stone to all the States,
But others seem to have realized the value of this freestone
and disputed my Father’s claim. In the first case at law, my Father
obtained a favourable verdict, but, his disputant being the richer man.
3


took the case to a higher court, my Father lost the case. The cost
of the legal action seems to have taken a little more money than my
Father had to spare and, to use his own phrase, "broke his back".
He then began to look round to see what was the next best
thing to do in order to make another rise. About this time his
young companions, John Batman and John Griffith, (both being of the
same age) had removed to Tasmania, They sent back a glowing account
of that beautiful little Island, praising its climate and extolling
its fertility® The thought seemed to have occurred to my Father that
it would be better to make a new start in the new Colony, Accordingly,
he at once consulted with my Grandmother and Mr, Beal, who was his
confidential friend and my Mothers good Stepfather, After getting
their advice and help, my eldest Brother Charles McCann, myself and
younger Sister were left under the care of Mr, Beal until my Father
could prepare a home for us in Tasmania,
CHAPTER 2 .
A New Departure and a Dark Cloud.
My Father now, without further delay seems to have turned
all his belongings into cash. Taking such tools as he thought most
needful he proceeded to the f? Green Little Isle", in a small schooner,
trading between Sydney and Tasmania, under the command of Captain
Hassell,
As far as I can ascertain, we heard nothing from Father
for about six months, when to the great delight of my Mother she
received a letter from Captain Hassell to say that Father had made
arrangements with the Captain for our passage. My Grandmother
persuaded my Mother to allow my eldest Brother to stay with her, at
least for a time. My Mother, myself and my Sister set out on our
Journey to Tasmania straight away. Here I would like to make a
remark on the remarkable precocity and early memory of children, I
have concluded from my own childhood that they know far more than they
get credit for knowing, and that passing events make an impression on
them, before language comes to express it.
My own memory was so remarkably acute and I was so
sensitive to impressions that I find I can remember almost every
important event in my life’s history since I was two years old* I have
made this digression because I feared that without this explanation,
my readers would think I vms drawing on my imagination instead of my
memory, I give this assurance that I have the most vivid recollection
of all the events of which I am now about to write,
I could not have attained to more than my third birthday
when we embarked with Captain Hassell for Tasmania and yet perfectly
remember my Mother leading me along the plank which bridged the space
between the wharf and schooner’s deck, and looking down with fear at
the deep chasm below, and then running along the deck with delight.
There was scarcely an Incident of importance on that voyage that I do
4


not remember. But to return to the subject, my Mother with her two
little ones were fairly well domiciled on board the little ship of
100 tons or under, and were as comfortable as the. meagre accommodation
would permit. Much kindness and consideration was shown by Captain
Hassell. After about twelve days of tossing, like an albatross, on
the ocean, sometimes on the crest of the waves and at other times
down in the trough of the sea, when a great wall of water, seemingly
as high as the little vessel*s royal mast., would rise up before us,
we arrived safely at Georgetown, Tasmania. Here I might say again,
that I have the most vivid remembrance of my Father coming aboard and
taking us to our new home*
Father had prepared a very comfortable house for us - as
houses were in those days. Timber was abundant and good, and Father
was a very smart tradesman; his boast was, that he could do anything
in wood, stone, and iron that he had seen done.
Having arrived at our new home, I well remember seeing a
great number of firearms stacked in a frame. This indicated the fact
that the blacks were on the warpath. All around the walls were two
inch auger holes; large enough to permit the point of the musket,
which would be only one inch in diameter, to protrude, and, with
sufficient room for sighting. The kind of shooting sticks, as they
were called, then used in the colonies were the old flint and steel
type of musket that had, so it was said, recently won the Battle of
Waterloo. This type of musket had become obsolete and had been
superseded by the percussion-cap type. But the British Government
considered the old muskets sufficient for the protection of the
colonists; hence the arrival in Tasmania of these old-fashioned fire-
arms. They were powerful weapons in their day and fairly safe if kept
clean* They fired a heavy bullet and would carry a good distance, but
were not direct in aim. It was by using this old musket as a
murderous club, the butt end of which was strong enough, in capable
hands, of knocking down a bullock, that the Battle of Waterloo was won.
Either as gun or club these old muskets were much in demand, because
the Tasmanian Blacks were then at their very worst, and were very much
more bloodthirsty and much harder to conquer than were the natives of
the Mainland.
The whole Island was now under arms, and the Government had
been put to considerable expense by setting a cordon of armed men right
round the country*. This turned out to be a forlorn hope. The Blacks
had the power, almost, of making themselves invisible, and, as might
have been expected, they doubled back on their tracks with the result
that only a few old Gins were caught.
As already indicated the country was well armed. The hand
of the Black was against the White man, so the hand of every White man
was against every Black man. It was a case of the survival of the
fittest, the weakest going to the wall. These war like Blacks were
soon exiled or exterminated. Fortunately my Father had no need to
use his little garrison or fire even one of his guns. To such an
extent was this the case that although we constantly heard of the cruel
5


massacres of whole families of whites before our arrival, not once
during the five years that we remained in Tasmania had I an opportunity
of seeing one member of this unfortunate race.
When my Father arrived in Tasmania he seemed to catch on
at once. He saw that Lime was scarce and at once commenced to
prospect for a Limestone deposit. He discovered a splendid deposit
at TT/est Arm near Georgetown; bought a small craft and began to trade
the Lime to Launceston, There was also a deposit of Freestone of
considerable value on the same land. With that resourceful enterprise
which was his leading characteristic, he at once secured a Government
Grant of the land, taking in a large block with a frontage on the
foreshore.
The land was good and carried a large quantity of valuable-
timber for which that part of the country has always been celebrated.
Having now acquired the land, built the house and settled
the family therein, my Mother, to use her own words - "Once more felt
a burden taken off my shoulders and saw a bright spot ahead". My
Mother, too, seems to have been full of cheerfulness and hope, and
delighted with the bright prospects ahead.
But sorrow often treads swiftly on the heels of joy. The
darkest cloud of my Father’s life now began to rise before him. In
order to utilize his stone and lime my Father made a new start in the
building trade.
He contracted to build an Hotel for Mrs, Haimes - the
Mother of squatter Haimes, who subsequently and virtuously perpetuated
his name by building Alms Houses for the aged poor in Geelong. And
now, a small digression. After accumulating a fortune in the Western
District of Victoria, Peggy Haimes (which was the nickname given her)
was known as the oldest identity of Georgetown and was spoken of on
both sides of the straits as the affable Georgetown hostess. Of
course, she had a keen eye to what she supposed was the leading article.
In the performance of the contract, to which I have previously alluded,
my Father obtained a trustworthy man to manage, with the assistance of
my Mother, his affairs at West-Arm, while he made the journey across
from West-Arm in a whale boat « leaving on a Monday, and returning on
Saturday afternoon. On an ill-fated Monday morning in the year
1830, and in less than three months after my Mother arrived on the
Island, she drew my Father’s attention to a small pimple on her lip.
He prescribed some simple remedy, and said it would go away, and
returned to his work without the sad, coming event casting any shadow
before it. On the Wednesday following, word came to my Father
containing the sorrowful news that if he wished to see his wife alive,
he must hasten home with all speed. When he arrived he found my
Mother unconscious and after one short week she breathed her last.
The small pimple on her lip spread like wildfire. It developed into
erysipelas of a malignant type, which going to the brain soon
extinguished life.

CHAPTER 3.
The Rough and Tumble of Life.
I can remember the circumstances of Mother's death, as it
were yesterday a One dark morning, I was awakened by hearing my Father
crying bitterly, and, what was more remarkable, the dog had taken up
the lament, and was howling fearfully. My Father had been v/atching
by my Mother's bed all night and towards morning she seemed to doze off
into a sleep* My Father also fell into a sleep and waking in the grey
dawn found that my Mother was dead.
My Father's loss could only be felt by the heart that feels
its own bitterness, but it must have been a heavy blow to lose a
faithful wife and an affectionate mother to his children, and to be
left, in the wild wilderness of a new country, with two little children
and no one to take care of them.
After my Mother's funeral (her burying place being
Georgetown) my Father broke up his Home at Yifest-Arm, and provided for
us as well as he could. My Sister's case was the most pitiable, as
she was under eighteen months old, but God always tempers the wind to
the as was proved by the kindness of Mr, and Mrs. Hopkins
of Launceston, These good people had amassed a considerable fortune
and were anxious to adopt my Sister to which my Father consented, and
in this way my Sister was very affectionately and abundantly provided
for. But I will have something to say on this matter later on.
The little hardy urchin represented by the pronoun ,f I M had
a roving commission for the next twelve months. After that I was
sent to a country school and what a school it was, I have read of the
Irish Schoolmaster, the big Colleges, and Boarding Schools described in
the Works of Charles Dickens, but, facts are stranger than fiction, and
this school, taken as a whole, was the most antediluvian scholastic
establishment that has come within my knowledge and experience« With
that gift which has always enabled me to recall, my early reminiscences,
I vividly remember my first Introduction to my first and last boarding
school® Looking back on it all, I am amazed that parents could be
Induced to send their children to such a place of starvation and
neglect *
Our pedagogue had the name of being a splendid scholar«
Could he have retained sufficient ballast to have kept himself steady
he might have done well, but, he had become a slave to intemperance,
and, what was worse Mrs* Howard, his wife, had succumbed to the same
we akne s s *
My first recollection of my school life was that I had
travelled a long distance, and that having arrived late in the after-
noon, I was very hungry« Shortly after my arrival, the Bell rang for
Tea, for which I was quite ready®
It did not take long to discover that if we were under-
taught we were not over-fed. I remember that we were arranged along
a narrow extemnn-rl sod n-n*
7


backs. Every boy was given a number at which was placed his mug of
black tea, and a small cube of bread with butter - the size of each
cube varying according to the age of the boy, quite irrespective of
any difference in appetite. Although only a little fellow I had by
no means a small appetite, and was nearly as good a trencherman as
the best of them. Being hungry I had gulped down my small morsel
before I knew I had properly,commenced. Of course, I had been told
what the consequence would be were I, like Oliver Twist, to commit the
unpardonable sin of asking for more. As a result I went to bed
hungry and got up empty, hoping that the breakfast would be better.
My hopes, however, were not realized. Then came dinner, composed of
rough boiled meat with potatoes boiled in their skins and as much
boiled stinging nettles as one could eat c No condiment other than
salt, was provided.
The Nettles were considered by the Teacher to be the best
and most economical blood-purifier. Referring again to the absence
of condiments, I confess that these were not much needed in our case,
for hunger is always a good sauce. But if the commissariat depart-
ment of this establishment was bad, the hygienic side of it was worse,
I remember that I was given a bed to share with another boy who was
humorously called Black, Dick White. I should think that poor Dick
White was a half-caste for, he was nearly black though called White.
I remember, too, that my first Impression of Dick was that he was a
very bad bed-mate. He seemed to be scratching and kicking about all
night, about which I complained to him very much. But to my great
surprise, in a night or two, I had fallen into the habit myself. In
explaining this, I may say that in a very short time all the boys at
the school were doing the same thing and were all suffering with that
dirt disease called the "Itch"•
I do not think that I shall ever forget the remedy used,
or its mode of application, for this complaint. There was a large
kitchen attached to the schoolroom, where the cooking was done. In it
was built a chimney as large as a room, in which seats were arranged
on either side. Here a large fire was made - wood being no object.
At a given hour in the evening we all marched down in a group,
perfectly nude. We then stood around the fire place, or, rather kept
turning round like a leg of mutton on a roasting jack. Prior to this
we were smeared from head to foot with a mixture of Brimstone and Hogs-
lard - the unctuous matter running in streaks to our toes. We were
then well rubbed down and turned into bed, perfectly naked. As a
final act in this drama, we had to take a strong decoction of the
essence of stinging Nettles.
I draw attention to the fact that our Master prided himself
on being a great disciplinarian and did not fall to tell us what v/ould
be the consequence of any transgression or disobedience to his
commands - and I for one had good reason to believe that he was
faithful to his promises. On one occasion my friend Black, Dick White
was sitting on a slab-stone, which was in keeping with the delectable
furniture with which this respectable seminary was adorned. The Stone
had been used for chopping meat; and had become covered with short
splinters. For the want of something better to do, poor Dick began
8


to pick at these splinters and coining in contact with a sharp one ran
it up the inside of his thumb-nail* As a result of the pain he
suddenly cried out "Oh" and pulled such a comical face that I forgot
myself and burst out into a loud laugh* Suddenly I was startled by
the loud voice of the Teacher saying « 11 Walk up this way McCann 11 . I
went up in fear and trembling to take my first "Gruel". I pleaded
that I would never do it again* but found no prospect of the Teacher
foregoing his opportunity to cane me* though I pleaded eloquently
with tears*, "I f ll teach you” said he "to disturb the whole class
with that jackass laugh of yours”. "Hold out your hand sir"* he
said, with a voice like thunder clap. I screwed up my courage and
tried to do as I v/as told, but when I saw the split edge of a large
cane coming down with the hiss of a serpent, it goes without saying
that I involuntarily drew back my hand. But, of course, this action
on my part only called forth greater vengeance. Then came thunder
clap number two saying "How dare you disobey me, sir - "Hold out your
hand again". I made another effort at obedience, when down came the
cane again with the same old serpent hiss. I must have drawn my
hand back a little, for the ragged edge of the cane just caught me
on the fleshy part of the little finger, and laid it right open to
the bone « the scar remains to this day. The blood spouted out of
my finger like an open fountain, which gave my Teacher a great deal of
trouble to stop.
I cannot remember how long I remained in this purgatory,
but it must have been at least twelve months, and I may state here,
that had it not been for the kind-hearted charity of an old lady that
lived nearby, named Mrs. Dally, who was in the habit of sending us
big dampers as large as a moderately-sized grindstone, I think we
should have literally starved to death.
But to bring this dry story to an end; the day broke at
last and the shadows flew away. On a bright summer ? s morning, I
think the happiest day of my life, I well remember, that about nine
o ? clook in the morning and while we Y/ere all outside v/aiting
impatiently for breakfast - and so hungry that we could have eaten the
proverbial donkey and his hampers of greens - a man appeared on the
scene with a horse and light conveyance. Of course, it goes without
saying, that we were all eyes and ears to learn what this arrival
portended. We hoped that it v/ould mean a departure for some of us.
To my inexpressible delight the trap turned out to be one that my
Father had sent to bring me home. The man with the trap was a young
chap of twenty years of age named Charles Tresider. As we had very
little to do wo crowded around the trap with, as I said before, eyes,
ears and mouth open. Charley leaped out of the trap without a
moment T s delay and said "Which is Peter McCann". With joy that can
be imagined, I said - "Yes, here" and strode out from the crowd.
The kindhearted fellow took me up and with many kind caresses said -
"Peter, I have come to take you home to your Father. Charley then at
once sent in to the Master to say that he, Charley, had come to take
me away and to pay my School Fees. But the Master did not seem able
to pull himself together and his wife ansY/ered the door. When Charley
told her that he had brought the cash for my School Fees, or to speak
■more nnrrfint.lv. rmr
9


ing for some time and whloh amounted to a good sum, it seemed to put
suoh a smile on her face and produced such a display of kindness and
sympathy that it quite surprised me. She at once began to apologise
for the lateness of the breakfast. As well as I can remember she
said that the Servant had overslept herself. Of course, that servant
could only have been present in her imagination, and it would have
been better for us if the servant had been present in person*,
However, she protested that I could not go away without breakfast and
added s, he will be starved to death”. But Charley said that he could
not stay a moment as he had come away without his breakfast, and must
get back to Launceston to get another horse in order to get back to
Pingall that night. As her last act of kindness she brought out the
heel of a stale loaf for me and dismissed me with many caresses and
blessings. But when we got to the trap, the fun commenced, A lot
of hungry urchins surrounded me like a pack of wolves and fully a
dozen Voices said n Give us a bit Peter”. At their earnest request
I pinched off some bits rather grudgingly, when the good natured
Charley said !! Por God’s sake throw it to them Peter, and you shall
have a good breakfast when we get to Launceston, the performance of
whloh promise he carried out to my entire satisfaction. To my
unspeakable delight we arrived in Pingall that night in perfect safety„
After receiving the affectionate embraces of my Father, eating a good
supper, and getting into a good bed, I thought I was the happiest boy
in Tasmania<,
I may explain here, that my Father being a good tradesman,
and having done some work for the Henty Bros, in Launceston, and to
their great satisfaction, was recommended by them to the Hon* S. Heal
Talbot, who recently arrived in Tasmania and had settled in Pingall,
He had brought a large amount of Capital to invest in the Colony and
had also brought with him plans for the erection of a Homestead which
was to be built in the most modern English style on the estate he had
purchased. As a result of the recommendation from the Henty Bros,
my Father was given the contract of building the Homestead, On my
Father’s arrival on the Estate the first consideration was to obtain
suitable building stone. He soon discovered that the district
abounded in the very best type of Freestone, Under these favourable
circumstances my Father realised good prospects out of the contract.
On its completion we removed to St, Paul’s Plains on the South Esk,
Here, my Father again secured the contract for the erection of a
Homestead for Simon Lord, a young squatter from New South Wales.
While this work was proceeding my Father thought that it was time to
make another effort towards a more settled life, which had been any~
thing but settled since my Mother’s deaths To this end he began to
pay his addresses to the young lady who was afterwards to become my
Stepmother, It must be remembered that my Father was still a young
man of 33 years, having been born in New South Wales in 1803, The
young lady to whom I have referred was eleven years younger, being in
her tv/enty-second year. Her name was Catherine Nelson, and the
daughter of a Master Tailor, carrying on business in the City of
Edinburgh, of which City she was a native, and came from Scotland with
her eldest Sister « Mrs, James Lush, who is still living at Elmore in
Victoria at the time I am writing and who must be one of the oldest
Colonists, having arrived in Tasmania seventy years ago and who now
10


My future Stepmother was nursery Governess at Captain
Greis at the time of her engagement to my Father* The marriage was
deferred for a time and in the Interval the Government decided to
build a stone Bridge over the South Esk* My Father tendered for the
contract and was successful in securing it, but events proved him to
be unfortunate as a contractor, for, to use his own words, the fates
were against him, or rather the elements were against him, for, as
soon as he had got the abutments and piers above water level and, as
he thought, above danger level there came down an impetuous flood*
The South Esk being a very swift-flowing river the whole of the stone-
work was washed away* When the flood subsided my Father made another
attempt to place his buttresses and piers. But when he had the Y/ork
still further advanced than on the first occasion, another flood came
down and carried the structure away for the second time* My Father
then gave up the contract in despair, as the Government would advance
nothing beyond the conditions of the contract* He then compromised
with his creditors and gave up the contract and the little that he had*
As a result he found himself poorer but perhaps a wiser man than when
he arrived in Tasmania* Under these circumstances came the second
wife and the new Mother* I suppose it was on the principle that love
will find a way, for despite the untoward circumstances the marriage
was celebrated* For richer or poorer, for better or for worse, they
were lawfully Joined together at Campell on October 1836* Here, I
think it my duty to pay a small tribute of respect to the memory of my
Stepmother, as there does not appear to be a scrap of evidence to
prove her existence or to perpetuate her memory* She died in 1850,
and at the time of this writing has been dead 54 years*
Without revealing any family secrets I might say that she
was not, in every respect, my Father’s affinity* There was quite a
degree of incompatibility of disposition between them* Of course, it
would be Invidious, in my case, to offer an opinion as to who was most
at fault,, as comparisons are particularly odious when, as in my case,
one owes such a debt of gratitude to both* To describe my Stepmother,
in a few words; she was diminutive in stature, of very slight build,
delicate of constitution, very ready of tongue and pen and bright of
intellect* Morally she was virtuous, honest and truthful* In every
respect she was much above the general run of of those days, and
here I would like to say a word or two about Stepmothers in general and
my own in particular* As everyone knows the poor stepmother is never a
very welcome guest among stepchildren and is seldom if ever, made the
most of* Generally, they are more sinned against than sinning* To
please all parties she would have to be an .angel. For my own part I
confess that during the early days of her married life, I was not very
obedient to her. But as I grew and gained a little commonsense, lam
happy to know that I made her all the reparation that I could, I became
more thoughtful and kind and this consideration was reciprocated to the
day of her death* And now to bring this dull chapter to a close* I
now know human nature better and am not surprised at the attacks of
melancholy and depression v/hich used to come over her; and which
caused my Father so much expense and trouble, and which tended to
shorten his life. But when you come to think of it, it is not to be
wondered at that being, as she was, a woman brought up in an entirely
different environment, fairly well educated and surrounded, with the
11


pleasures and conveniences of a great City, that she succumbed at the
early age of 38 to the inconveniences, hardships, and privations of a
colonial pioneer's existence. She had a family of six children, and
here I hope that, should these linos over reach the eyes of my step-
brothers and sisters, they will not think that I have written of their
Mother with any want of affection.
CHAPTER 4.
Back to Australia
At this point my Tasmanian experience terminated* Notwith-
standing the fact that my Father could have done well in Tasmania, he
seems to have fallen into one of his unsettled moods* John Batman had
just returned from Port Phillip with the boast that he had bought half
of the Colony from the Natives. At this time Batman occupied a small
sheep station at Ben Lomond which was only a few miles away from where
we lived. On hearing of Batman 1 s return from Port Phillip my Father
went over to Ben Lomond to see him and was quite enamoured of Batman's
description of the new settlement which had been called Melbourne,
after the British Premier of the day.
I have the most distinct recollection of my Father telling
u.s of the immense suit of clothes that Batman had had made for Buckley,
the wild white man, and which he was to take back to Melbourne.
It was at first thought that arrangements would be made
for our return, with Batman, to Melbourne, but when it came to terms
my Father, did not agree. About the time that Batman, Falklner and
others began to occupy Melbourne, the Henty Bros, took possession of
Portland Bay and Griffith and Gonnoly took possession of Port Fairy.
My Father having heard that Griffith and Gonnoly were fitting out a
whaling party and had established a sheep station at the Port, at once
interviewed Mr. John Griffith, whom he had known in Sydney, with the
idea of getting a passage. It so happened that my Father was just
the person that Griffith and Gonnoly had been looking for, as Father
was not only a mason and bricklayer but a good carpenter and a fair
blacksmith* The difficulty now, was a passage for my Stepmother and
myself* A small schooner of seventy tons called the ‘'Thistle”, had
been fitted up for the journey across. On this small vessel were
packed fifty persons including the well-known John Mills and his wife,
and the Henty’s and Waters for Portland.
With provisions and the large number of passengers, the
little wooden, water-logged coffin had rather more on board than was
safe.
Mr, Griffith wisely realised that my Father would be more
contented in the now settlement were he able to take his family with
him, and offered him a free passage for himself, my Stepmother, and
myself, on the condition that Father yjould look after the__sJLQJ2e-S—and—■

on board the little craft. Included in the stores was a large
quantity of water, also, of rum. The offer was gladly accepted.
My Stepmother was domiciled in the little cabin with Mrs, Miles, The
little nine-year old had to take pot-luck and do the best that he
could.
Having made the arrangements complete, we got off with all
despatch. We embarked at the Launceston Wharf, it took us a
considerable time to get down the river as It is very rapid and
circuitous, in places. Sometimes, sailing and at others being towed
by the wlmling boat - there were no steam°*boats in those days - we
eventually arrived at the mouth of the river at Georgetown and steered
for the Australian Coast in the beginning of April, 1837,
Soon our troubles commenced* Little did we think on
losing sight of land that we were to be tossed about like a cork, for
six long weeks. As is often the case, a South-Westerly gale sprang
up and instead of sailing due North across the Straits, in the
direction of Melbourne, for three hundred miles, we were driven at
least two hundred miles to leeward with the difficulty of beating up
against the prevailing southwest winds. The Captain was thus
compelled to run the craft on to Western Port for shelter. At this
point a circumstance took place that was v/ithin a hair’s breath of
making another widow and orphan. Before my Father agreed to perform
the service of storekeeper and steward, he came up, on this particular
occasion, from the little cabin carrying some dishes. Ho had to step
up onto a seat that was lashed to the side of the rail, and when in
the act of doing this the vessel shipped a big sea, gave a violent
lurch which hurled him into the sea. Immediately there was a cry
"Man overboard”,
I remember running to the stern of the boat; from where
I saw the well-known head of my Father bob up like a cork, I saw too,
that he had at once turned on his back, so as to keep his face away
from the waves and towards the ship. Although he had heavy clothes
on. Including his boots, he seemed to be able to float breast high out
of the water. Fortunately, he was a most export and fearless swimmer
and was able to keep afloat until finally rescued and brought on to
the boat once more. As I grew up I became a good swimmer and could
have done three miles at a stretch. But I could never attain the
expertness or great speed of my Father,
Another thing, under a kind providence, assisted in
saving my Father’s life, we had on board some of the most expert
boatmen in Tasmania, and although they were packed into the little
craft like herrings in a tin, they, in less time than you could
believe to be possible, had one of the best whale-boats down and
manned. Anyone acquainted with these boats knows their wonderful
seaworthiness, but after admitting this, it did not seem possible that
these slightly built boats could have ’withstood the violence of such
a sea as-was running* Digressing for a moment; it was a boat of
this type in which Bass first crossed the wild Straits, The Captain
immediately brought his vessel to; and, to our delight, we began to
have a good hope that the small whale-boat would
13


to the violence of the waves, But, then came the crisis, I distinctly
saw the stern of the whale-boat approaching him, and when it came
within touch a wave struck the boat and it went right over the top of
my Father. We were now afraid that the keel had struck him and were
afraid that he would be stunned. But, here his cool courage seems to
have come to his help* Ho said, subsequently, that he saw the whale-
boat coming over him and shot down feet first. This must have been
the case, for, to our great delight he shot up near the stern of the
whale-boat, like a cork, and v/as at once pulled aboard by strong arms.
The boatmen lavished praises on Father, for his bravery, without making
any reference to the bravery of their own deed.
Poor Dad was now lifted aboard our vessel and covered with
plenty of blankets,, With a good drop of the indispensable, he went
to sleep and in an hour or two got up, looking very little the worse
for his experience.
We ran into Westernport that night. But as we had been
unable to lift the whale-boat on board again, we had to take it in tow,
and, as a result of the buffeting it got, was in very bad shape when
we got into Ports we had a young fellow on board who had
served his apprenticeship to boat-building in Sydney. This young man
went ashore at Westernport where he repaired the whale-boat * It was
said later that it was the fastest and safest whale-boat in Portland,
to which place she was being sent.
We stayed a week in Westernport, where we replenished our
supplies of Wood, Water and Bread which had become rather short. To
this end my Father suggested, to the Captain, that some men be sent
ashore with him, together with two or three bags of flour, and he
would then be able to send back a stock of bread by night time, which
he did o My Father, at once got a fire made, on the sand just above
high water mark, a chain long and five feet wide. The fire was kept
going until the white sand was hot and running like quicksilver. A
number of men was then put on to knead the dough, which, in turn was
flattened out to about two inches in thickness and thrown onto the hot
sand. After an hour, it all came out nicely baked and in the form of
large biscuits, or, as they are called in Australia, dampers. These
would keep for almost any length of time - the dough having been worked
stiff and very long.
The weather having moderated somewhat, the Captain was
anxious to get under way, but a delay was made because a number of the
younger men had gone ashore and had begun to lead a Robinson Crusoe
life. It was only with the greatest difficulty that the Captain
could get them on board. At last we got things fixed up and got under
way. After another weeks buffeting with the waves, we dropped anchor
to our great delight, in Port Fairy Bay, opposite Griffith Island,
after a voyage of six weeks and which should not have taken more than
six days.
14


CHAPTER 5.
Whaling Extraordinary.
We lost no time in getting off the little vessel, and
getting fixed up on Griffith Island. There was a number of reed
cabins already erected in preparation for the whalers. We availed
ourselves of these and found them comfortable, especially when compared
with what we had put up with during the previous six weeks.
The chief headsman, as he was called, was Mr* Alexander
Campbell, who at once hurried up my Father to get up the tripods as
soon as possible as the calving season had commenced and he knew that
the whales might be visiting the Port any day.
There was not a minute to be lost in getting the drying-
out furnaces in order and the large, ton butts, which were to contain
the oil, in readiness, and in trimming the boats, grinding the
harpoons and lancets.
A sharp look-out was kept from the highest point of
Griffith Island, two or three men being given the job. Each had a
large spy-glass fixed on a low swivel. These lookouts then lay flat
down and continued to scan the horizon, so that the boats might have
time to get out in the bay and be ready to give the whale a welcome
introduction# We had not long to wait before the great sea-monsters
began to put in an appearance. The well-known cry "There she spouts’ 1
rang through the little Island and everything was astir. Many days
had not passed before we had three whales at anchor at the same time,
and from now on the tripods and cutters were going nearly constantly
to the end of the Winter.
I cannot say from memory what was the amount of oil
shipped, but it must have been very large, and profitable to the
owners, as, at this time, the oil was worth £2O per ton. The average
weight of oil from each monster would not be less than seven tons.
This with the return from the whalebone would represent, an earning
from one whale, of about £145.
Our Chief Headsman novj found that a number of his boatmen
were not so efficient as they should be, and having discovered also,
that my Father was an expert boatman - having been brought up on the
Parramatta River - he persuaded my Father to take a hand at the
whaling. This my Father was not unwilling to do, as the season was
a good one, and the able-bodied men were getting payment on the basis
of 16 per cent on the value of the oil obtained during the season.
Mr. Campbell gave my Father his choice of the headsman,
and although my Father was very much attached to Mr. Campbell, he yet
had more faith in the coolness and skill of his own countryman,
Mr. T. Clark, He therefore, elected to join Mr# Clark*s boat.
Whether he was right or not, I don’t know, but as it turned out,
Mr. Campbell was the first to meet with a very melancholy and lament-
able accident. Having harpooned a whale, the great fish at once
sounded - that la went to tbn hn-htnm -
15


As the water was deep, a very large length of line was paid out*
This line was made of the very best European Rope and had a length of
one hundred fathoms. The whale must have gone down head first, but
no sooner had it struck the bottom, than it began to rise again and
as the line was slack the tub oarsman could not get the line in
quickly enough and was not able to give the warning that the whale
was up. The whale seems to have caught sight of the boat and made
one slash at it with its tail* It was done with the swiftness of
lightning and the unfortunate boat was knocked up some yards into the
air* Three men were sent to eternity in a moment, and the boat was
knocked into splinters. Fortunately, Mr* Campbell escaped without
any harm, and lived to become well-known in Williamstown as Captain
Campbell, Harbour Master. His daughter is Mrs* Martin, wife of
Mr. Martin, one of the oldest builders in Melbourne, and who, with
Mr. Peacock, built a portion of the Melbourne Pish Market,
I would like to say here that anyone who has once seen
one of these monstrous leviathans of the deep has seen a sight that
he is not likely to forget, To see the cutting and slashing of that
tremendous tail, which you would think, from its great size, could
only move very tardily, flashing about with almost lightning swiftness
is something never to bo forgotten* Small wonder that the whale
thrashes so alarmingly when it is remembered that the harpoon
penetrates a distance of eighteen to twenty four inches; that it is
barbed and held fast by a pov/erful rope.
Of course, to have any idea of so large a fish as a
w r hale, you must give up thinking of a sprat on a gridiron and quite
alter your idea of fish dimensions. You must contemplate a fish
sixty six feet long and with a diameter of fifteen feet; a tongue
weighing a ton, and, a tail fourteen feet over the flukes, so that
when the whale stands on its head, as the whalers call it, you can
see the great tail twenty feet high, curling about and feeling
around for something to strilee at in self-defence, when in a moment
it will come down on the water like a lightning flash*
From Sea to Land*
I shall never forget how delighted I was when the whale
fishing was over for the season as the lot that fell to me was a very
arduous one.
Perhaps it may be as well to describe how the blubber is
removed,. It is as follows The whale is towed alongside a
vessel that is anchored firmly,, A man walks along the back of the
whale and cuts strips fore and aft of the whale with a sharp boat
spall « the blubber by the way, is from ten to fourteen feet thick
and is very hard to cut* Next, he scarifies across so as to form
what he calls blanket pieces of about six feet square* The cutting
up process attracts fish without number, including sharks by the
thousands and up to twenty and twenty-five feet in length. The man
on the back of the whale then hooks the ship ! s tackle on the blanket
piece, by the corner* It is then lifted and released from the
16


fattoan, as it is called. The under portion, which is red, has the
appearance of coarse horse-flesh.. If the whole Whale could be
rendered down some of the best fish would produce tons of oil,
but when the blubber is removed and the head cut off for Whalebone,
the remainder of the carcase is allowed to drift out to sea or ashore,
as the wind might direct, where it would attract swarms of fish below
and flocks of birds on top.
The blanket pieces were removed as quickly as possible, if
not, the sharks would eat tons of it. The pieces were then towed
ashore where a gangway lead to the blubber shed. This is a large
room with the floor tightly corked. In this room were employed two
men and a boy whose work it was to keep the blubber up to the tripods.
The work of the first man was to tie up the blanket pieces in what
were called horse pieces? The dimensions of these were 9 inches by
the thickness of the blubber and about two feet long. The other man
had to mince pieces with a two handed knife into slices of about two
inches thick. The boy’s y/ork was to throw these heavy pieces of
blubber on to the top of the mincing horse, and to push them along as
they were sliced. This job fell to the lot of the poor little nipper
I call ,? l ir .
From four o’clock in the morning till seven o’clock at
night I had to follow this delectable occupation, ankle deep in oil.
With my clothes saturated with fish oil there was no possibility of my
skin cracking. But it is a happy thought that while sorrow sometimes
treads on the heels of joy, that joy often treads on the heels of
sorrow, and so this hardship, like many more, came to an end. But I
shall never forget how delighted I felt when the last piece of blubber
was cut up, casked ready for shipping and the furnaces were allowed
to go out. One woe was passed though another had to come*
The Squatting Era#
The Whale fishing was now over and the Spring weather had
commenced which ushered in what might he called the Squatting Era.
The Company began to send down sheep and cattle to the Port. My
Father commenced to build Homesteads suitable for Cattle Stations and
Sheep Stations on the Mainland. All the homesteads, up to this date,
had been erected on Griffith Island - large quantities of timber being
sent from Tasmania, My Father elected to build the Homesteads for
the Cattle Stations near the Port as there was no danger of the
dingoes attacking the cattle as the carcass of a whale was too much
of an attraction for the Native Dogs that swarmed around it in
hundreds. As many as two hundred could be seen down near the Port on
these occasions. The Australian Dingo is a half-breed, between the
Foz and the Wolf, possessing the cunning of the one and the
ferociousness of the other.
The Port, at the mouth of the River, turned out to be an
ideal place for a cattle station. The pastures were so rich and
abundant that I have seen the cattle so fat that they could hardly
walk. Milk and butter were in great abundance. On account of the

and succeeded in finding a beautiful tract of country on a clear
running Greek - a tributory of the Hopkins, ten miles from the Port*
I may remark here that this was a piece of Australian experience that
I value much, namely the opportunity of seeing this State, at least,
in its purely primitive oondlton.
When we crossed over from the Island and entered into the
vast forest of the Mainland, it seemed to extend to infinity and a
feeling of strange loneliness and sadness crept over one. It looked
a dead world and seemed as if it had been standing still for thousands
of years. The poor black men being few in number, and so near the
animal Kingdom In their habits, it was evident that they had made
little change in the great country in which they had lived for ages,
in fact, nothing could be seen but a small sapling that had been out
down with a stone tomahawk, and you might travel for days without
seeing any other indication of human existence. And yet, the
Australian bush is prolific and swarming with life# The Rivers were
full of fish and the Lakes alive with water-fowl, swans and geese*
The grass and scrub seemed equally alive with living creatures. The
scrub abounded with wallabies and the Plains were covered with
Kangaroos in droves of one thousand each; Possums were in almost
every tree* The birds were so tame and unafraid that they seemed
to stage a concert as a welcome on one's arrival, while the Laughing
Jackasses appeared to laugh derisively at one without fear of be?ng
reproved for their bad conduct. Vegetation was beautiful and super-
abundant and Mother Nature seemed to open her arms in Invitation -
beseeching one to accept of her numerous bounties, which up to this
time had not been put to any use.
My Father had been down at Port Fairy for about two years
with the Griffith Company during which time he had received no settle-
ment and, indeed, no money as the business was conducted in a very
slipshod manner in those early times and was more in the form of
barter than as cash transactions. In this way my Father had received
as much Slops as he required. The term "Slops" was a very appropriate
name for them. The only thing about them that was not "Slop" was
the price, and that was of the highest order* Another mistake was
that my Father had no agreement with the Company as to salary, John
Griffith promised my Father that if he went down to Port Fairy and
fixed up the concern successfully he would be well paid.
My Father now thought that he had got the whole concern
in working order after working almost day and night, and came to the
conclusion that it was time to settle up with the Company. To that
end he at once made a journey over to Tasmania to see Mr. Griffith
who was the Managing Director of the Company, My Father returned
without a shilling, completely dissatisfied and feeling that he had
been robbed right and left, and now seemed to be quite tired of the
Company. Better opportunities were opening up as a number of young
inexperienced men began to arrive with their flocks. These men had
no colonial experience, but had read Dr. Lang's books upon Australia
Felix, and had been sent out by their Fathers to try their luck at
fortune making in Australia. As they had no experience of Australia
18


the Hut. Among the best of them were two young men called Laughnan
and Linch who were anxious to get my Father's help* Laughnan was a
perfect gentleman, Linch had evidently been a wild boy and had been
sent out under the charge of the more prudent Laughnan, But both had
money* My Father accepted their offer and went into their service.
The first work was to select a suitable Sheep Station, and having
made observations from Tower Hill, possibly using the large telescopes
that I have referred to and which had been used in the whale-fishing.
The view disclosed in a north-easterly direction a piece of country
of large dimensions. My Father then took his bearings by his pocket
compass, intending to make a bee-line through the intervening forest.
He lost no time In getting hold of two pack-horses and in commencing
the journey. In about twenty miles he got into clearer country, but
it was not up to my Father's requirements. He was anxious to find
country with an abundant supply of fresh water, and so kept on in the
direct on to which he had set himself, hoping to strike the head of
some River or Creek running into the Sea between Port Fairy and Gape
Otway, and in this his judgment turned out to be correct. In con-
tinuing his North-Easterly direction for forty miles from the Port he
struck upon one of the most beautiful spots and one of the best
Station sites in the Western District, It turned out to be on what
was then called Muston's Greek, I do not know who Muston was, but
possibly he was Whitehead's overseer, as we soon discovered that
there ?;as anothe Squatter in occupation five miles further up the
Creek called "Whitehead”* Of course there was plenty of land and
my Father marked off seven square miles and twenty-five square miles
which was a nice allotment. The small flock that we took up did not
number more than a thousand. My Father was now anxious to get
possession for fear of someone jumping his claim. The return journey
was more difficult as a road had to be marked out by blazing the trees
along a route that a bullock dray could travel. My Father got back
as soon as possible. He packed up provisions and all necessary
requirements on the bullock dray and we commenced on return journey
without delay and managed to reach the Station on the third day.
Having done this, the first thing to be done was to build a substan-
tial house and to get hurdles made in which to camp the Sheep, But
we soon discovered that this rich spot was the abundant fishing and
favourite ground of men of a different colour. We found, as is
invariably the case, that these natives possessed a better physique
and greater strength and courage than that possessed by the aborigines
near the Sea and that they were quite different men to those of the
Port Fairy tribe. We could also see by the great number of bobbing
bridges along the large water holes and the large number of woven
fences erected across the shallow portions of the Creek, for the
purpose of erecting their nets, that the natives were numerous.
However, we saw nothing of the blacks for about a month, although we
were conscious of their near presence by the smoke from their fires.
And we knew, also, that they were watching us, but as I have said
before, these people have almost the power of making themselves
Invisible by their great skill in stealing upon everything. They
have a marvellous gift of sight and know the warning sound of every
Bird,
19


Before we had been a month on the Station the Dlacksklns
took it into their heads to pay us a friendly visit. One fine
morning we heard a great jabbering in the scrub behind the hut. As
soon as my Father heard them he jumped up and said "Take your guns,
boys, the"blackskins are upon us, but keep cool and don't fire a shot
till I tell you to, as they seem friendly and we will only shoot in
self-defenoeo" Of course our number was few compared with that of
the natives, as there were only my Father, myself, the bullock driver
and Mr, Linch, the young Squatter, while the blacks must have numbered
between fifty and one hundred. My Father now sallied out with his
small band considerably in the rear. He then grounded his arms and
with a broad smi.le beckoned a welcome to them. He had hardly done
so when a fine able-bodied black stepped from behind a tree, he
appeared to be the Chief of the Tribe, He was certainly about the
finest specimen of the Australian Balck I had ever met. He at once
gave his name to my Father as Balia, As soon as the Chief had met
my Father in peace, we found that we were surrounded with our dark
friends who seemed to step out from behind every tree. My Father
beckoned to those who were carrying their implements of war with them
to lay them down, my Father placing the butt of his gun on the ground
and keeping his hand on the muzzle« At the command of the Chief
they all made an advance. We soon found that the Chief was a better
class of Black than we had met down at the Port, He had evidently
travelled as this was the first time we heard the name Geelong
mentioned, or Jeelong, as he pronounced it. He must also have
travelled with the bullock drays as he was able to speak a consider*-
able amount of broken English and told us that a great number of men
had travelled to Geelong with Bulgarina and ¥i/hee lb arrow.
Of course he must have picked up the "Wheelbarrow" from
the English word and had used it to refer to the Bullock Drays, I
think that he had possibly come through from Geelong with some of the
Squatters as a guide and as these men, like all other men, do not
all come out of the same mould, so he was the most friendly and
apparently the most kindhearted of any Black I had ever met* His
Lubra also seemed to be about the finest of her race and appeared to
have the same kind disposition. But with regard to most of them
there seemed to be a savage disposition pictured on their hatchet like
faces. Of course, at their best, it would be a very unwise thing to
put any confidence in an Australian Black at that time. They now came
to the Hut which they seemed to be very much Interested in, examining
in every part the White man's Miami, The Chief seemed to have tastea
both Sugar and Flour, but the sugar he seemed mad after as among his
first words to my Father was "Yunggerlalla Picaninny Sugar," Of
course, all the provisions we had upon the Station would scarcely
have given these fellows food for a day. But my Father, after many
minutes thought brought out a small tin of sugar about half pound in
weight* He beckoned to the Chief to hold out his hand when my
Father poured about two ounces into the palm of the Chief's hand,
which he Instantaneously threw into his capacious mouth* He asked at
once for some for his Lubra, after making himself cocksure of what he
had received himself. My Father then began to pour a little Sugar
into the Lubra f s hand. All the time he was doing this she kept
saying "Wara ury Ury or Mori - more. Before my Father was av/are

20


My Father now gave a special command that we were not to "Tucker" the
Blacks any more* because we had already given more than we could sparer
Our position was too much like the Biblical one - a few loaves and a
few small fishes, and what we had would have been very small among so
many a Besides, as my Father said, if we gave the Black the taste
they would want the lot.. Any gratitude from an Australian Black
of those days would be on a par with the Pirates who, having been
given the Ship and Cargo, would kill you for the Longboat e He
further said that we could kill a sheep for them, but that it would
be a foolish thing to do to let them taste mutton* They 'would do
that soon enough* However,, when the Lubras turned out their baskets
we found that they had a fair supply of provisions with them - Possum,
Kangaroos, Bandicoot and a number of Snakes, which are really their
most savoury meat* They did not begin their cooking till night*
With these people it is either a long fast or a big feast© As the
morning drew on wo thought it would be a ”Geeso” - go avjay* But as
they began to collect stones and to make little fire-places for
cooking ue could see that they intended to stay all night© The little
fireplaces were built with rough stones about a foot square and about
a foot high. Each male had his own cooking place at vdiich he sat
with his Lubra, if he had one, sitting behind him© After the fire
was made and had burnt down a little, cooking was commenced by
throwing possum, bandicoot or bird upon the coals, often without
skinning and always without disembowelling* After giving the
possums or whatever it might be a turn over or two the carnival
commenced© The male eats first by eating the half burnt, half
cooked outside portion of the animal, using neither knife or fork
and v/ithout pepper and salt or any other condiment * It is not eating,
but rather gnawing the flesh off with his teeth* The cooking and
eating go on simultaneously* When one side of the animal had been
gnaY/ed off, the remainder is put on the fire for another grill* Then
the gna?/ing process is repeated until little is left but the bone*
Without turning his head, the man throve over his shoulder to his
unfortunate and waiting Lubra, at the same time saying ”Cugghella
Wagh" which means ”trhere is something to eat”* The remarkable part
was that all the little baking and roasting was done right in front
of the door of the Hut that we wore building which was completed all
but the chimney© However, my Father did not interfere with them©
They sat up very late, laughing and jabbering away*. At last they
seemed to quieten down and prepare for rest, which they did by
squatting down on the ground, taking care to place themselves windward
of the fire and covering themselves with their possum or kangarooskin
rug.
There was a very large Lightwood Tree just facing the Hut
and my Father said ® ”Peter, it will not do for us all to go inside
the hut so I shall sleep or rather watch outside under the tree* Will
you be afraid to stay ouslde”” I said "No, if you stay outside I will
stay with you*”
My Father was reconciled to this night in the open, but
was prepared for War as well as for Peace* He said, ”Peter, don’t bo
afraid* If anything happens there is nothing else to do but to
attack them* Of course, they are afraid of guns and of us* If they

tho other men what to do if anything happens# We had not been down
under the tree very long when we saw the shadow of something by the
light of the camp fire, which proved to be a black fellow# He or
another paid many visits of this kind during the night. However, the
night passed away without any harm# In the morning my Father was
anxious to give the Blacks their travelling tickets and, after they
got through their breakfast grill, my Father began to make the sign
Geezo which they accepted very kindly and apparently good naturedly.
But my Father said ,? We must prepare for the next visit# I fear that
they havo only come to spy us out !l , which proved only too true#
My Father seems to have had a good knowledge of the
Australian Blacks# In New South Wales he was appointed by the
Government to bring in the Australian Blacks of the murderous tribe of
the Five Islands, for which he received a grant of land at Bung Bung#
Hq thought so little of its value at the time that he did not take the
trouble to get it registered# Today it is of groat value 9 which
proves how little the early settlers knew of the great future of this
Country#
But to get back to our friends, the Blacks who had visited
us# They had taken note of everything that we had and had cast
greedy eyes on them, especially the knives, axes and guns# We found
too, that they were watching us continually# For instance, we had
cut down a tree near the House for splitting up into hurdles, during
the dinner, the black who had been apparently watching our every
movement sneaked along and stole the axes#
On another occasion, my Father was cutting some wattles,
not far from the house when without warning, a large kangaroo spear
landed and stuck in the ground at his foot. Had it not been for
his courage he would have lost his life# The moment he saw the
spear he seized his double barrelled gun and rushed in the direction
from which the spear had come.. At the same, time, he made the
loudest and most unearthly noises that he could# Holding the gun
in one hand and swinging the axe in the other, it was not long
before a blackfellow popped out from behind a tree, followed by
several more# My Father pursued them but took care that his first
step in the chase was in a direction which would put him between the
Blacks and the hut# Having achieved this he ran for the hut and
arrived safely*
The next visit they paid us was Just as it was getting
dark* While the Shepherd was getting his tea the dogs began to bark
and looking out we saw a black running across the hill on the other
side of the Creek* We at once gave pursuit but lost sight of him
immediately* When the shepherd went to his sleeping box he found
the Blacks had carried off his splendid double barrelled gun and his
blankets# Matters now began to get worse with regard to the natives
and they made an attack on the next Station, where the overseer was
speared through the throat and the bullock driver left for dead# My
Father now came to the conclusion that the whole thing was a forlorn
hope# Laughnan would not live on the Station and Linch had gone down
to the Porto My Father said that nothing could be done with the
Blacks, but to shoot them Indiscriminately and this I would not do
22


My Father resigned his position and took what he could get from Mr.
Laughnan. This about finished matters for poor Laughnan. He would
have made any arrangement with my Father who had made up his mind to
get back to the Building Trade and to get some position where he could
give me and my Stepbrother and my Stepsister some chance of education.
My Father accordingly made an arrangement with Mr, Laughnan to send
the wool-clip to Geelong and to bring hack provisions, and after a slow
journey, averaging ten miles a day we arrived in Geelong on the 4th May
1841, which is sixty-six years ago on this date, 4th May 1907, I may
say that Mr. Laughnan tried to carry on but finally had to give up, as
the Natives continually drove off his sheep. I do not know who is
now in occupation of the place. These and many other features
connected with the pioneering of this land, especially in the early
days, go to prove what a lot of windbagism there is in the Yarra-
Bankers and in their delectable orations, when they begin to denounce
the squatters.
THE BLACK AGE.
Before starting my reminiscences of dear old Geelong, in
which I have spent the last sixty-six years of my life, I would like
to say a few words about the Aboriginal Age and to make note of some of
the strange peculiarities of these peoples- I do not know whether or
not my readers will think I have drawn the standard of these poor
lowly sons and daughters of Nature too high or too low- But, if I
appear to put them on too high a pedestal it is because of my sympathy
which I have for them* But I must confess that after ten years
experience of their habits I have come to the conclusion that they have
got down as near the animal as it is possible for human beings to do.
But this descent of the human species is not apparently confined to
Australia, as we have read in the papers of the discovery of a Race in
darkest Africa, which has caused quite a controversy as to whether the
members of this Race are the lowest form of man or the highest of
monkey* However, in writing the history of this great country, our
acquaintance with which seems as if it were only yesterday, we must
content ourselves with conditions and circumstances as they apply here.
Nearly all that we know about the Black of Australia is his quick exit,
his penchant for wife-destruction, and the fact that he is deteriorat-
ing and succumbing to the evils of our so-called civilization, in much
the same way as the great trees of this country have fallen before the
axe of the White man. To it may be said ’’The place that once knew
him shall know him no more”. With regard to the history of the
Black, little can be said, for he has none; or if he has we know
nothing about it. Collectively, they have no knowledge of the time
of their occupancy of this land, nor how they arrived here. The
puzzling aspect of the Australian Blacks is the great difference that
exists between the numerous tribes. For instance, there is as much
difference between the habits and the ways of life between the
Tasmanian Aboriginals and their North Australian brothers as there is
between the Africans and Mongolians.
Just as the Australian Blacks have no knowledge of where
they came from so they have no knowledge of where they are going, as
they do not appear to have anything that could be called Religion.
23


They seem to have a fear of something that' Is evil, but, as far as I
could discover, they have no idea of Creative goodness o Certainly,
they have some vague idea of transmigration from their present
earthly state to some other.
Then it may be said that our Black man has no language,
or at best, a mere fragment of one* His vocabulary is not as
extensive as that used by an Australian child of six years 3 I have
known people who like myself have tried to learn the language but
the lack of words is a great obstacle, Nowadays, it is difficult
to keep them from using Pidgin English* As soon as a Black gets
hold of a word in English he will use it in every conversation.
Again his domestic habits are little removed from those
of the animal and are of the lowest degree. His wife is only some-*
thing to please his passion and to be a slavey to be prostituted at
his pleasure if the reward is sufficient, sold completely against
her will, or given away if she has become too old for his passion.
This is frequently the case, because of the fact that by reason of
the hard life that a Black’s wife has to live, she soon becomes old
and ugly* Also if the husband is a bad one, he has even less
affection for his children. If a child is sick or dies the father
consoles himself with the belief that the sickness or death is
brought about purposely because he had too many to provide for.
Another and mors extreme illustration of his lack of affection for
his children is evidenced by the Father’s willingness to take the
child by its heels and knock its head against a tree, H© will do
this with as little compunction as that shown in killing a Bandicoot*
The Mother stands by, weeping and ready to bury the poor little
unfortunate. To the Black woman’s honour it must be paid that she
is not without maternal affection. With the men it always seemed
to me a case of t? Dog n fatherhood.
The Infant picanniny has also a hard life. The Mother
has to breast feed her baby while dependent on her own efforts
towards securing the necessary food for her own bodily wants, and
for the maintenance of a sufficient milk supply, as this is the only
food the infant will get. Prom infancy, it is cradled in a grass
basket. The basket is well made and is designed to cradle a child’s
body, at the same time allowing the head to protrude. As soon as
the child can gnaw a piece of meat he is weaned, as soon as he can
fend for himself he is compelled to assist the other juvenile
members in providing food.
The Blacks method of revenge and punishmoit is very
arbitrary and quick and amounts to the taking of life for the
smallest offence, the innocent often being slain, with the guilty,
if they have the misfortune to belong to the same tribe*
Then comes their hereditary idleness. This seems to be
born in the Australian Black, and I fear that it will take generations
of severe training to purge it out of him. This antipathy to work
will be I should say the main cause of his eventual extermination.
24


The Black*s habit has been from time immemorial, to live
simply upon the bounty of Providence in the most literal sense# He
gives no thought to tomorrow. He ploughed not, neither did he save
a single seed; and yet the wise man in all his glory was not as
contented as one of these# But it is this that places the poor
Black in his position of abject poverty#
Before the advent of the White man the Black man had a
super abundance of food - the Kangaroo on almost every plain, the
Emu and Turkey in abundance. Opossum in every tree Wallaby in every
scrub. Pish in the sea and rivers; Swan, Duck, and Geese in hundreds
in Lakes and Lagoons, so that food was abundant and ready on every
hand#
But when, because of the White settlers, the hunting
grounds became overrun with cattle and sheep, and destroyed, he
became an idle mendicant, begging about the Towns, Villages and
Stations; only sober when unable to get intoxicating drink; when
tobacco was available his pipe was never out of his mouth#
Obviously his case was a very hard one and he presented
a problem difficult to solve# The coming of the White man was,
of course, largely responsible for the worsening of the Black*s
position# On the other hand, one can scarcely admit that it was
the will of Providence that so great and beautiful a land as
Australia should be lost to v/orld progress for all time# It would
not be in accordance with the evolutionary nature of things#
But whether the White man has returned sufficient
recompense to the Black for the thousands of Million Sterling that
has been taken from his land is open to question# Some of the
natives feel their loss very keenly, and consider that they have
been done a great wrong# I remember poor old Billy Gore, on a
State occasion, making a speech# He v/as the last of his tribe, and
he said "I am King of Barrabool; all this country belongs to me#
What for Whitefellow oomo here, takee our land, killie our Kangaroo,
*possum. Emu, every ting. But if we take one sheep belonga White
fellow he shootee down Blaokfellow”•
Then comes his lack of skill in every kind of Art and
Architecture. In Victoria the Black never understood the Art of
building the most simple kind of boat. His Mia-Mia, or apology
for a Hut, is nothing but a few sticks set up on end and covered
with a little grass plastered with mud#
MY ARRIVAL IN GEELONG.
I remember this occasion perfectly, for here I was to
find my resting place and safe anchorage for the remainder of my
life, and I do not think one ! s lot could be fixed in a more
beautiful spot, outside of Eden# When one thinks of its beautiful
climate and its sweet sunshine - being as it is in the moderate
temperature zone of Victoria, and possessing as it does the best
rainfall in Australia - one must indeed be grateful# Then there i«
25


its picturesque its splendid Bay surrounded by stately
mountains, with its calm, smooth surface and its gentle beach.
Then we must not forget the two beautiful Rivers that form their
junction, on the south-western boundary of the City and touching
the Bay within a mile and a half on the City side* These Rivers
give the impression that by their impetuosity, they would burst
through to the Baly, scaling along the south side of the City and
spreading along the Plains, and, in this way forming the lovely
Lakes of Connewarre and, finally, disgorging themselves into the
sea at Barwon Heads, tv/enty miles from the city*
On the 6th May 1841, a little over 66 years ago, I
arrived in Geelong about 8 o ? clock 0 It was dark and wintery* We
crossed Fyansford, jolting over the rough Ford, in a bullock dray
at an average speed of two and a half miles an hour* This seems
slow travelling, but it must be remembered that the Railway Whistle
had not yet oooeed in Australia* When we had passed Pyansford we
came to the Precipitous Heights of Pyansford Hill, which had never
been touched, I suppose, since the days of Adam® In the dark it
seemed to be almost perpendicular, but the whips were laid on heavily
and the poor, patient beasts of burden scratched and scraped, some-
times on their feet and sometimes on their knees, till finally, to
our delight we reached the summit. Our Bullock-driver, being an
old bushman and having made a previous journey to Geelong, had no
difficulty in making a bee-line for South Geelong* He said that he
must camp on the Barwon as he would not be able to get water in
Gorio, by the Bay,
When we got to the top of Newtown Hill, near to where
the Newtown Town Hall is built, we could see the welcome lights of
South Geelong, and soon distinguished the Public House Lamp - the
only Hotel in Geelong, as it was then called* For some reason,
it was called a Lambing-down Station by the Bushmen for the period*
Behind the Hotel even at this early date, was a Brewery where some
kind of drink was brewed and which was called Sheoak Hops* I
suppose it really was some kind of Beer*
We put up at the Hotel for the night, and I remember
that in the morning we all got up early to see what kind of a
World we had dropped into* My Father looked around to see if he
could get a house, but there was none unoccupied* Fortunately, we
had a splendid circular tent, well lined, and warmer than most of
the houses of those days* It was about sixteen feet in diameter
and when we erected a temporary chimney, and were able to have
plenty of fires because of the abundant wood available, we were
very comfortable*
My Father now began to look around to see what new
departure he could make in regard to employment* One thing a little
in his favour was that nothing had been used for permanent buildings
but stone. The unlined quarterlngs were sawn by hand at the saw-
pits| the palings were also hand split. My Father was a good
tradesman in stone, brick or wood, and quickly secured employ, .ent
with Messrs. Williams and Thomson, builders from Melbourne. Both
26


were Scotchmen, from Edinburgh and Glasgow, They had the contract
for building three stone buildings « the first erected in Geelong.
They we re the Look-up at South Geelong; the Watohhouse at the
corner of Moorabool and Corio Streets, in Corio as it was then
called; and Straughan’s Store at the corner of Moorabool Street and
Corio Terrace,,
In passing, I would like to point out that in the early
days a great deal of unfair criticism was made about the building
stone of Geelong, The soft clay bed portion was used and the
lamina was regarded as natural bed. There is a stone still
preserved in the Karduna Gardens, that was the lintel over the
front door of the South Geelong Lock-up dated 1841, It was cut by
my Father, and it is as well preserved as it was when out* It was
taken from the good beds. This is typical of the stone used in
all the buildings about Geelong, that was taken from the good beds.
It is a great pity that the Geelong stone, in so many instances,
was abused and badly treated. We have in the Geelong Harbour
Board Building some of the finest building stone in the World,
But as has frequently been the case, we have not learned to utilise
half the riches of our country, and the Government has not been
guiltless in this lack of appreciation, for it, too, did not see the
value of the stone that lay at its door. For instance, there is
the great bed of sandstone, five hundred feet in depth, that under-
lies the Barrabool Hills. These Quarries should have been opened
two hundred feet deeper. If our more economical stone, which
can be cut as cheaply as deal, had been used they could have been
made Imperishable at a very small expense. Pew people know that
two coats of boiled oil will almost indurate any Stone, Who would
think of erecting a house built of deal wood without putting oil
or pigment on it. But while you indurate Wood the induration is
only of a temporary nature and even then the centre will perish.
With indurated stone you have something that is Imperishable,
It is true that our State Government spent money on the
introduction of the Stawell Stone, but it was too distant, too hard,
and too expensive for commercial use. Another great drawback to
stone ornamentation is that machinery has never been able to
supercede handwork. The old Mallet and Chisel has gone chipping on
and in this country, where hours are short, wages high, and men take
their work leisurely, stone cutting becomes very expensive# In
consequence, it is more than likely that brick and cement, will
become the general building material in Australia - Australian
bricks are of good quality. The Colonial Cement is equal to any
in the World, and can be moulded and pressed into every variety of
ornamental shapes, or built as walls and tied with steel v;lres,
when it will become as hard as the common blue stone and as impervious
to damp# Tho surface can be made perfectly smooth and coloured
with any kind of cheap pigment, thus making an artificial stone that
will go on hardening and will exist, I think, as long as the sun
and moon endures#
But my readers, should I be blessed with any, will think
lam derailed again. I must, therefore, wander back and see if I
can pick up the track again which was leading me to dear old Geelongo
27


My Father at once got work on the South Geelong Watch-
house* at twelve shillings per day., This would seem to he good
wages* hut when you consider the price of provisions it meant little
more than a hand to mouth existence, But it was a start, and about
the first thing my Father did was to work the Lintel and to engrave
the year 1841 on it* And which, I am told still exists* The work
was small and soon completed* The next thing that the Government
required* after the Lock-up was a Police Court, and the contract was
let to Mr* W. Beacher* and was to ho erected in Yarra Street on the
west side right opposite to Rev* A, Law’s Church on the Hill* half
’way between Geelong and Corio which wore regarded as two separate
villages* The idea of course* was that the Courthouse would he
equal distance from both. This was really the first building
erected in Geelong that possessed any architectural features as it
was of a neat design and was executed in neatly-cut Freestone*
When Mr* Beacher came to Geelong he mot my Father and
finding in him the real f, Ss.mon Pure” for his purpose he at once
appointed him Foreman over the Works,, My Father completed the Job
in a very workmanlike manner, giving Mr* Beacher a good profit* and
the Inspector every satisfaction* Shortly after this work was
finished Geelong suffered its first great panic* and indeed so did
all Victoria* Every man that had a penny laid it out in land or
rather stocky Money became so scarce that no one could realise
upon their Stations* The consequence was that all work stopped for
the time being. Some of the Stations* that today are worth a
princely fortune* sold their sheep at one shilling and sixpence per
head* with all Improvements and lease given in. In Geelong every-
thing came to a dead standstill. You could not hear the blow of a
hammer even. Exchanges were made chiefly by barter. But* of
course* in Australia changes come and go by leaps and bounds, like
the kangaroo© Things soon began to look up a little| people
began to arrive in great numbers both from England and the other
Colonies* and* what was better* a large number of them brought a
good bit of capital. As a result* things in 1843 began to
revive in trade* wages still keeping very low. As evidence of this
I remember that some of the best Masons employed by my Father were
paid not more than four shillings per day* Provisions and clothes
were still very dear, I remember well the first contract that w©
got because I had just commenced to serve my time in the Mason’s
trade 0
This concludes the History of the Family from the time of
the arrival in 1799* of Peter McCann as recorded by his Grandson*
of the same name.
It continues until 1842 a year after he arrived in Geelong,
It is a matter of great regret that he was not able to continue the
story; as I am sure it would have been a very fine record of the early
history of Geelong where he lived until his death in 1908*
I have endeavoured in the following pages to record what I know
and what I have been told of his life between the years 1842 and 1908*
and have added my own story of the development of the Cement Industry
in Geelong up to the present time which he was instrumental in estab-
lishing., :
28


After his arrival in Geelong Nicholas McCann carried on
his calling as builder and stonemason and built some of the early
buildings including the first portion of the Geelong Jail, the first
portion of the old Geelong Hospital, the first portion of Christ
Church and during the Ballarat diggings in the fifties was
contractor for the St, Paul's Church, which Job was discontinued
owing to the men all leaving the Job to try their hand at the
Ballarat diggings; and it is stated that the work of construction
was idle for over twelve months, after which the work was continued
and completed. The Stone Peers and abutments for the old Barwon
Bridge at the south end of Moorabool Street were also built by
Nicholas McCann who had now taken in my Father, his son Peter as a
partner.
The Bridge was to have been used in the Crimean War;
but was not required owing to the hostilities ending before it
could be put into use; so that it was sent to Australia and part
of it erected at Geelong. It continued in use up to about the
year 1917 when it was replaced by the present structure owing to
it being too narrow to admit of the trams being put down. In
about the year 1850 my Grandfather Nicholas McCann decided to send
my Father Peter McCann to England to bring back my Aunt Annie, who
had been taken to England by the Hopkins family when Nicholas left
Tasmania some years previously.
During my Father's .visit to England he met Elizabeth
Begley my late Mother, at Grantham, married her and brought her back
to Australia, They arrived on "Black Thursday," which was when the
Western District of Victoria suffered one of the most devastating
bush fires which ever occurred in that State, The trip out was in
a Sailing Vessel and occupied 6 months*
After his return my Father Peter McCann continued with
his Father in the Building Industry as Contractors in Geelong,
He purchased land in Bellarine Street between Ryrie and Malop
Streets, which became very valuable as it was thought that Geelong
would become the metropolis of Victoria and this particular land
rose to a high price, but, as we now know this did not eventuate
owing to the bar of shallow water which stretched across Corio Bay
and would not allow the entrance of the large sea going vessels.
There is now a channel cut which admits the entrance of the large
vessels; and if this had been done in the early days, Geelong
might reasonably have been the metropolis of Victoria,
As building was booming in Geelong at this time and
there was a big demand for building stone my Grandfather and Father
lookdedfor a suitable Quarry to supply this need and eventually
opened up the Sandstone Quarries at the Barrabool hills near Ceres
about six miles from Geelong.
These Quarries are still in the Family, and afterv/ards
became the best known building stone in Victoria, It having been
used in the building of Scots Church, Collins Street, St. Paul's
Cathedral, Melbourne, Ormond College, Bendigo Cathedral, Father
Robinson's Church in Burke Road and numerous other buildings. TRp>
29


demand for this Stone grew so fast that my Father decided to move
to Ceres and discontinue Contracting, My Grandfather Nicholas
McCann moved to the Barrabool Hills with my Father where he died
in the year 1880 and was buried at the Highton Cemetery,
At a later date my Father took my eldest brother John
Nicholas McCann into partnership and traded under the name of
P. McCann & Son, They then extended their operations by opening
the Waurn Ponds Limestone Deposits on the Colac road about 9 miles
from Geelong, This deposit was extensively used as a building
stone throughout Victoria, They also put up lime kilns and burned
the waste material into a building and agricultural lime.
The Limestone deposits on the Moorabool River and
Batesford were also opened up (this being the deposit which later
on was to become of great value for the manufacture of cement) and
was used in the first place by my Father for the manufacture of
dripstone filters for purifying water and as stone dressing for
buildings in a number of churches and public buildings in Geelong
and elsewhere, and can be seen in a great number of buildings at
the present time, the stone being of a very soft texture and can
bo easily sawn with an ordinary wood saw, is of a very durable
character and hardens on exposure to the atmosphere, and although
the buildings referred to, in which it was used have now been in
existence for over eighty years the stone shows no sign of decay,
beyond the usual weatherings which appear on all Freestone,
The Batesford Quarry on the North side of the Moorabool
River v/as also opened by my Father, This stone was used in the
construction of the new Court House at the corner of Russell and
Latrobe Streets, Melbourne, but was found to bo a very expensive
stone to work, the granite from the Dog rocks nearby having become
mixo d with the Lime st one 9

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CEMENT INDUSTRY IN
VICTORIA.
Those who promoted the Industry have long slnoe passed,
but in the words of the poet -
?f We need not be missed if another succeed us
To reap down those fields which in Spring
we have sown;
He who ploughed and who sowed
Is not missed by the reaper.
He is only remembered by what he has done”.
In dealing with the establishment of the cement
industry in Victoria, it might be opportune to say something
regarding the origin of cement manufacture# It is over lOC years
since Smeaton, the Engineer who built the Eddystone Lighthouse,
found that to create a structure which would stand the ravages of
wind and wave a better cement than was at that time available was
required; this was the origin of the' manufacture of what came to
bo known later as Portland Cement,
It is therefore over one hundred years slnoe Portland
Cement was first Invented - over a hundred years in which concrete
became a necessity, not merely for an isolated British Lighthouse,
or for the narrow water ways which served before the railroads
could stretch their long lines across the country, but a necessity
for a thousand common uses#
The cement industry has grown from a small industry#
It has grown in solidarity and extent. Instead of a hundred
different specifications vjith varying characteristics we have now
attained one standard# Smeaton, White, Aspdin, Frost, Johnson,
Taylor were the pioneers of the Industry, each following his own
Inclination - those were days of individual effort# It was more
than three quarters of a century before the cement Industry learned
its first lesson of solidarity, of pulling together, and of
unification#
We no sooner achieve certain ambitions and think we
can rest on the fruits of our labour, than we find that we have
to undertake a further stage of the journey, and so it is when we
look back at the poor plodding Joseph Aspdin, who was fined by
the magistrate for stealing the rock dust off the roads of England
to make the first Portland Cement# We seem to have come a long
way to the mountain devouring machinery of the modern cement
Industry#
31


Now again after over one hundred years, the industry is
considering what new worlds it has to conquer. The individual
effort is again cropping out. New Cement necessities are being
studied.
The manufacture of Portland Cement was, and still is,
a great achievement, but the cement industry is too great to
regard its present product as final. Prom many sources comes
the thought that there is still a great deal to be done and that
we are but at a stage of the journey.
The new and greater uses of Cement of the future is a
necessity which urges on every Engineer and Cement Producer to meet
these great demands. To habitual users of concrete it is scarcely
necessary to say that concrete is - a compound of gravel, broken
rock or other materials bound together by cement. We also know
to common understanding, unless otherwise specially qualified, that
Portland Cement concrete is meant when concrete is mentioned*
The name Portland Cement was almost accidental - the
fact that Aspdinb early product bore a resemblance to Portland
Stone, which was largely in use in England at the time of nis
invention, was the reason this name was adopted| there is nothing
more in the name than that•
In H.C. Bradder f s book on the early development of
Industries in England, he states ff There was a great wave of
Industrialism started in the eighteenth century”. Men like Joseph
Aspdin the inventor of Portland Cement pressed forward with new
ideas and inventions that affected the whole world. The Mill-
wrights, the forerunners of the Engineers of to-day, were then the
designers and constructors, most of whom were self taught geniuses
who, by sheer constructive thinking solved the problems that came
before them,
John Aspdin was born in 1779 at Leeds, a town in
Yorkshire, Of his early days, little can be gathered, but it is
known that he served his time to become a bricklayer and plasterer,
a combined trade in those days. Oddly enough Smeaton ? s home was
also at Leeds, and he was living there while young Aspdin was
apprenticed to his trade | and there can be no doubt that Aspdin
was aware of the work that had made Smeaton famous, as it is known
that the latter employed a number of workmen about his laboratory
in which he tested materials for the Y/ork he supervised, such as
the building of the Eddystone Lighthouse. In those days gossip
between workmen carried the news of their trade all over England,
and as many of them could not read, this was their main opportunity
of acquiring knowledge of new methods of construction and materials.
H. C. Bradder goes on to say ”The germ of every
invention exists in work done before its fruition, and in the case
of Portland Cement it was John Smeaton who experimenting in 1756,
discovered with the help of a local chemist, that a proportion of
32


clay mixed with lime caused the pulverized burnt materials to
become hydraulic, and to set slowly under water. While this was
a valuable discovery he did not carry it far enough.
There was nothing further heard of this invention
until a paragraph appeared in the M Leeds Mercury” dated November
sth 1824 which stated M We hear that Joseph Aspdin, bricklayer of
this town has obtained a patent for a superior cement representing
”Portland Stone”.
At Wakefield he set up the first Portland Cement Works
upon a commercial scale, and his first difficulty was the grinding
of his raw material. There was only water power and wind mills
available to drive his millstones, so that the grinding was a long
and tedious taskj however, he worked his way out of the difficulty-
The difficulty of introducing his Cement to the building
trade was productive of more trouble, and the adoption of its use
was slow, as the competition of the old Roman Cement was difficult
to overcomeo Gradually the value of his invention became known,
and he had offers of assistance to establish Works elsewhere.
A proposal to erect Works near London was made, and a
Company was formed, and a Factory started near Gravesend in 1828,
His eldest son, who had grown up and had been connected with his
Father’s business for some years, being high spirited and impatient;
did not get on well with his partners and in 1854 he was Induced to
go to Germany to erect and control a Cement Works near Berlin,
Leaving these Works in good order, he started up a second,at
Hamburg, and a third at Lagerdorf, His difficulties gave him a
strenuous nine years and his health broke down, and his death
occurred at the early age of 49 years. He had been so unbusiness-
like that he died poor and had left nothing for the support of his
wife and family, who had to return to England poorer than they
left it.
The elder Aspdin carried on the Works in England after
his sons departure to Germany, then the inventor’s health failed
and he died at the ripe age of 76 years. He was buried in St.
John’s Church Yard, Wakefield, and upon his stone is inscribed the
following 2-
Sacred to the memory of the late Joseph Aspdin
of this town (Inventor of the Patent Portland
Cement) who departed this life on the 20th day
of March, 1855. Aged 76 years.
It will therefore, be gathered, that cement was first
Invented in England, and taken over to Germany, where the Germans
improved on the method of manufacture, but I am pleased to be able
to state that its origin occurred in Old England.

ESTABLISHMENT 0? CEMENT INDUSTRY IN VICTORIA,
In the year 1888 The Dryden Estate at Geelong was
subdivided and put up by Auction* The area which contained the
Lime Stone deposit being sold separately, had an area of 1200
acres*
My Father was the highest bidder at the auction sale,
but it was passed in and purchased by him privately after the sale*
Having used the Limestone for the manufacture of Dripstone Filters
and as a building stone, ha knew something of its extent and
quality* He continued his experiments to establish its suitability
for the manufacture of cement, and came to the conclusion that it
was satisfactory* He then got in contact with Richard Taylor who
had been connected with cement manufacture in England and New
Zealand, and made arrangements for him to look into the possibility
of the proposal*
After conducting very careful experiments Mr. Taylor
came to the conclusion that the limestone was highly suitable, but
experienced some difficulty in securing a shale in the district
which would be satisfactory for the then known method of manufacture
of cement, this being before Rotary Kilns and Tube Mills had come
into practical use*
After considerable research and experiments, what was
considered a most suitable material for the purpose was found on
the Moorabool River Plats at Pyansford, it being an alluvial
deposit of silicate of alumina deposited during flood time when the
river overflowed its banks. The silica being in very fine
particles it required very little grinding and suited the machinery
which was then in use, it being difficult to grind coarse silica
to required fineness*
It was really on account of the discovery of this
deposit that the Works were first established at Pyansford, but in
addition to this material being available on the spot, the slope
in the hill lent itself to the type of Kiln then in use.
In the year 1890 a Company was registered the first
Directors being Messrs. Peter McCann, John Holton, Robert Camlin,
William Radden, and Phillip Kemp, Thomas Peters, the whole of
these being well known master builders in Melbourne and Geelong*
Mr. Richard Taylor was appointed the first Manager and
Secretary of the Company and received instructions to proceed with
the erection of a plant capable of producing 300 tons of cement per
week*
A contract was let at b/~* per ton to P* McCann & Sons
for the supply of Limestone from the Dryden Estate and the opening
up of the Quarry was placed in the hands of my brother S.H.MoCann*
Huts were built on the river bank near the Quarry and
a stable to hold fifty horses was established*
34


The supply of stone at this time was a difficult
proposition, as there were no decent roads and the mud was up to
the axle of the drays.
At a later date a horse tram was put in which relieved
the position, but as this only covered half the distance the stone
had to be carted part of the way by horse drawn vehicles»
Six old type shaft kilns were installed and these were
erected on the side of the Pyansford Hill, the site having
particular economical advantages for this method of manufacture,
The raw milling was done on the top level and the burnt material
after passing through the kilns came out on the lower level where
the final grinding was done* The erection of these kilns and
the subsequent flues required entailed a large amount of excavation
and immense quantities of earth had to be removed.
The difference in elevation between the raw mills and
the finishing mills was approx, 80 feet. The kiln flues and
chimney which was placed on the hill about 100 feet above the raw
mills and about 80 feet above the Cement mills making a total of
about 180 feet to its foundation, was 150 feet high. This was
connected with kilns and the boiler house by means of a flue. This
arrangement, viz, having one chimney common to the whole of the six
kilns and boiler house, worked satisfactorily providing the plant
was kept in constant operation, but if it happened to be idle for
an extended length of time difficulty was often experienced in
getting rid of the damp gases, and explosions or blowbacks would
ocour o
The Kilns were of the type then used, being bottle
shaped. After the brickwork was completed the erection of the
building, consisting of wood and galvanised iron, was put in hand
and the machinery installed. This consisted on the raw side of
edge rollers weighing about 30 cwt, each, running in large cast iron
pans of a diameter of about 12 ft, necessary elevators and spiral
conveyors ; pug mill; brick making machine and the old type mill
stones originally used for flour.
The Limestone and Silt after having been dried was
fed into the edge rollers in the proportion of about three to one
and after having been ground was elevated to bins over the mill
stones and after having been further reduced to a sufficient
fineness in the mill stones was put through a pug mill and from
there through a brick making machine.
The bricks containing the correct mix were then dried,
after which they were placed in the kilns in alternate layers of
coke and cement bricks. After the kiln had been loaded it was
lighted at the bottom and as it burnt, further layers of coke and
cement bricks were put on at the top. This process went on until
the kiln was completely full to the top when the kiln was drawn
from the bottom* This process entailed a considerable amount of
Vionrl Ifl.hftnT' Q a V> n 1•? n Iro yi ViQ rl ~t~ r\ ho V> a -nrl -nn r>lrorl q -r>rl onir n 1 -i mV/a vi

that was insufficiently burnt placed on one side for further treat-
ment, The reburning of the underburnt clinker was troublesome as
it invariably disintegrated and dusted, thus damping the kiln down
and Interfering with the draft, so that rather than put this back
in the kilns it was found more economical to sell it as an hydraulic
lime and very good trade was eventually established. This material
was sold under the name of ”Hydro” and was largely used and
specified for foundation work.
The operation of the old type of Kiln was a risky
process owing mainly to the escape of fumes, which are well known
to be very dangerous, I have often known men to collapse from the
effect of fumes, treatment being similar to that used in cases of
drowning. The poisonous fumes would get so bad on occasions that
operations around the raw mill had to be suspended, and even when
this v/as not necessary the atmosphere would become charged to such
an extent as to cause violent headaches and sometimes vomiting.
Another portion of the works where the men suffered great privations
was during the operation of loading of the Kilns, The temperature
in which they had to work was so high that if an empty bag was put
against the brick work it would ignite. The above conditions in
addition to the dusty state of the works in which cement was
manufactured, in the nineties made the whole operation very
unpleasant for the workmen.
The machinery on the cement side consisted of jaw
crusher, ohillion mill with perforated bottom, elevators, etc,,
the final grinding being done in mill stones similar to those used
on the raw side#
The cement was elevated into bins from which it was
bagged by hand* The bags used were corn sacks, these being four
bushel bags instead of the three bushel standard bags now adopted
for corn* Each bag weighed about 90 lbs, being -two to the cask,
and were not sewn but tied with binder twine and one can imagine
what an unsightly package this made with more than eighteen inches
of loose sack hanging over at the mouth of the bag and a
comparatively small quantity of cement in the bottom of the large
sacks.
It cannot be said that the cement produced under the
method was equal to the cement produced today#
Owing to the coarse grinding and the light burning all
cement as produced was found to be blowing and therefore, it was
necessary to store same and take pat tests until it was found to be
sound, when the usual physical tests could be proceeded with.
Although the system was crude good cement v/as made and we have
numerous examples of cement made under this process still giving
satlsfaction*
At the time the Works were established imported Cement
was selling at 18/- per cask, but when the local works commenced
operations the price of the imported article was gradually reduced
until 12/« per naak of 378 lbs, uma
36


The Company at first constituted under Richard Taylor f s
management continued to operate intermittently until the year 1902
and up till then had not paid a dividend* By this time the rotary
kiln had come into use and the Directors decided to send Mr* Taylor
abroad to obtain information regarding the nevir process. After an
extensive tour Mr, Taylor returned to Australia and during his
sojourn he acquired the Australian rights for a Danish concrete pipe
known as "Weinberg" Pipe As far as I know this was the first
attempt at making concrete pipes in Australia, On Mr. Taylor f s
return he erected an experimental plant at the Works at Pyansford
and after a lot of pioneer work, he was successful in securing a
contract of considerable size with the Melbourne & Metropolitan
Board of Works,
After the contract was signed the Directors were
unable to come to terms with Mr, Taylor regarding the patent rights,
Mr, Taylor then left the Company and established a plant for making
concrete pipes at Port Melbourne, This Company at a later date
amalgamated with a concrete pipe Company which had in the meantime
been started by the late John Gibson. The pipe as first produced
was of low grade, having no reinforcements. It was pressed on end
in three feet lengths and had the ordinary spigot and faucet
connection, Mr, Taylor continued to retain his interest in the
manufacture of concrete pipes up to the time of his decease.
The cement undertaking up to this date proved sc
unprofitable that it was decided to put the Company into liquidation.
The plant was put up by auction but the only offer was
from a firm of Marine Dealers named Smart & Jewell v/ho proposed
selling the plant for scrap iron. My Father later purchased the
property and persuaded Messrs, Radden, Kemp and Peters, three of the
old Directors, to join him. This was in 1905 and I was appointed
Secretary and Manager, I restarted the Works on April Ist, 1905,
and have been closely associated with the Industry up to the present
t ime o
After restarting the Works we were again subjected to
very keen competition. During this period prices were the lowest
on record since starting cement manufacture in Australia, the
contract with the Melbourne City Council being at £2,14,0 per ton
delivered on the Job, Melbourne,
The first duty of 6d, per cwt. was placed on cement
under State Administration on July 29th 1892, and was increased to
l/« per cwt, on October 20th, 1892, This duty continued to apply
until 1902 e

Prior to Federation in 1902 the position regarding the
different States was as follows s-
After the first Commonwealth Tariff was passed in 1902
the duty was fixed at 9d. per owt, in all States, In 1908 it was
changed to l/- per cwt, General and 9d, United Kingdom, It was
later fixed at l/6d. General and l/- United Kingdom, In 1936 the
importation of cement under preferential Tariff was made free, and
under General v- per cwt. In both cases subject to adjustment in
the rate of exchange.
The Works were kept in operation from 1905 to 1910 by
the small Syndicate consisting of Messrs, Thos, Radden, Peter McCann,
Thomas Peter, Phillip Kemp and S. H. McCann with myself as Manager.
In 1908 my Father Peter McCann died. He was born in
Parramatta, New South Wales in 1828, arrived in Victoria in 1836.
Died at Geelong in 1908 at the age of 80 years. He continued to
take an active part in cement manufacture right tip to the day of his
death. He came to the Works on the Friday afternoon to sign
cheques and I got a ring on the Saturday morning notifying me that
he had passed away. He was pre-deceased by Thomas Peters who was
also a Director and whose shares we purchased.
We now found it very difficult to carry on profitably
with the old plant, which had become obsolete. The rotary kiln
system having become the recognised method of burning was more
economical than the old system. As with most pioneering concerns
we were having a hard struggle to exist, and as the new machinery
necessary to bring the plant up to date required a good deal of
capital, it was decided to look for additional capital,
A new Company was registered under the same name on
17th August 1911, The Directors of the new Company being Messrs,
T. J, Noske (Chairman), D. H, Dureau, Thos, James, W. C. Cone,
W. H. Nichterlein, S. H, McCann, myself Director and Manager and
P. L, Munster as Secretary,
The old Works were scrapped, and what was a modern
plant at that time installed, capital being expanded for the purpose.
With a capacity of 400 tons per week, the new plant commenced
operations on the ,! Dry Process'*.
With the installation of the new plant which Included
an aorial Rope-way to bring the raw material to the works from the
Quarry there was a marked improvement in the product manufactured,
for which there ma.s found to be a ready sale. It was therefore
38


decided to more than double the capacity of the Works,- With the new
unit it was decided to use the wet system, and a kiln of a larger
diameter and 40 ft* longer was installed and came into operation in
1914,
For some time we continued to run the old Kiln on the
dry process and had the unique experience of two kilns running side
by side, one on the "Wet” and the other on the ?f Dry Sf process. We
found that the nev/ Kiln running on the ,! Wet ,! process ensured a more
perfect mixing of the ingredients, and a guaranteed uniformity in
the cement, it also eliminated a considerable amount of dust owing
to which we were getting complaints, we therefore, decided to extend
our first Kiln an extra 40 ft, and convert it to the wet system.
The operation of the War Precautions Act, under the
terms of which the Importation of cement into Australia was
practically prohibited, gave a fillip to the industry during the
war years. Previous to this legislation the greater portion of
Australia's cement requirements Yi/as obtained from Great Britain
at a cost below that quoted by many of the local manufacturers,
A shortage of shipping also curtailed supplies from overseas.
As previously stated increased business arising from
the better quality of the product necessitated the duplication of
the plant in 1915, and six years later a further extension was made,
bringing the total capacity to 2500 tons per week.
The whole of the machinery for this unit' was manufactured
in Australia from drawings and plans produced by our own
Messrs, Ruwolt & Company being the contractors. The whole of the
work proved highly satisfactory and is a credit to Australian
workmanship.
In 1924 it was decided that the business had grown too
large to be successfully operated by a private Company, and in
January 1925 a public company, Australian Cement Ltd., was registered
in Victoria with a nominal capital of £1,500,000 in £1 shares.
The old Directorate and Management continued in control
with D 0 M, Bureau as Chairman, This Company took over as a going
concern The Australian Portland Cement Co. Pty, Ltd., the purchase
price being £750,000.
The company commenced operations with a paid up Capital
of £750,000 in £1 shares. The Directors then decided that I should
go abroad to enquire into modern methods regarding the manufacture
of cement, and of handling raw materia}.. As a result of my visit
the existing plant was extended, its capacity being increased to
4,000 tons per week. This quantity was in excess of the total
consumption of Victoria, this was in accordance with the policy
adopted by the Directors of keeping production well ahead of
demand.
39


As a result of my visit abroad, a plant capable of
producing an extra 75,000 tons per annum was purchased and consisted
of the latest type of coal grinding machinery, new type of kiln, with
cooler attache! to end of kiln tube mills, etc., and two Caterpillar
shovels manufactured by Ruston Horsnby, each capable of handling up
to 1500 tons of raw material per day#
The new plant was brought into operation in August 1926,
and the Company was then in a very strong position as regards
manufacture, the plant being one of the most modern in Australia#
The Company having had considerable difficulty in
having its product delivered to the Railway owing to the shocking
condition which the roads were allowed to get into, asked the
Railway Standing Committee to recommend the erection of a line from
Pyansford to North Geelong, this was granted in 19|6 and Bill passed,
Parliament sanctioning the construction of line at .a cost of £30,957.
In the past the chief concern had been to manufacture
sufficient cement to meet the demand, but the position was reversed
and difficulties were found in stimulating trade to meet an extra
demand o
In 1927 paper bags for holding cement were substituted
for Jute Bags, a. Company known as Bates (Australasia) Limited
having been started in Australia for the manufacture of these bags,
Australian Cement Ltd#, becoming shareholders to the extent of
£3750.
At this date demand for cement was increasing slowly
and the Company’s sales improved, with the result that production
rose from 140,764 tons in 1926 to 163,436 tons in 1927. However,
sales at the end of the year began to become more difficult owing
to large surplus production in New South Wales caused by extensions
to existing plants and new ones coming into operation. In 1928
the new Quarry was sufficiently developed to enable Limestone to be
delivered by Railway# A tunnel 3/4 of a mile long, concrete lined
with a height of 15 ft. and a width of 14 ft. had been put into the
floor of the Quarry on a grade, 1 in 34, to cheapen the cost of
limestone. The’ contract price for the tunnel was £60,000.
In 1928 shares in the National Portland Cement Co# Ltd.
of Tasmania were acquired, the terms of the acquisition being one
Australian Cement share for every ten preference shares in the
Tasmanian Co. and one share for every 50 ordinary shares# The
Works purchased were closed down and the plant dismantled#
In August 1929 negotiations with the Kandos Cement Co#
Ltd#, of New South Wales were finalised. It v/as agreed that the
two Companies should pool their interests in an operating Company,
with the object of eliminating wasteful competition and over
production# To carry this arrangement into operation, a new
Company, Australian Portland Cement Pty. Ltd#, was formed, in v/hlch
40


the above two Companies had equal share interests. This Company
was registered in Victoria on the 16th October, 1929 with an
authorised Capital of £5,000,000 in £1 shares.
Under the arrangement it was agreed that each contribut-
ing Company should have the same number of Directors, The Directors
appointsd were as follows:- Kandos P,P. Kneeshaw, R.M. McDonald,
and A, A, Stewart, Australian Cement Ltd,, T.J. Noske, D.H, Dureau
and W. B. McCann with R. W. Everett, Secretary. P.P. Kneeshaw was
appointed Managing Director and W. B. McCann was appointed Victorian
General Manager and Chairman of Directors#
Australian Cement Ltd, received £lOO,OOO in cash and
£1,000,000 fully paid up £1 shares, while cash was also paid for
stocks on hand at the date of the amalgamation (Ist December, 1929)
The Australian Cement Ltd, kept all its cash in hand, Government
Bonds and Securities, Cash Deposits in respect of contracts, book
and other debts, and some of its shares in other Companies,
Having described the process which existed in the
Pioneering days when manufacture was first started at Pyansford it
is interesting to look at the Works as they stand today.
The raw material used in the production of cement
consists of approximately 3 parts of limestone and to 1 part of
shale. These materials are obtained in the Quarry belonging to
the Company, who in this respect is fortunate in having both
materials in the one deposit. The Limestone itself consists of
consolidated mass of shells and corals which are overladen with
from 30 to 40 feet of clayey overburden. The process then consists
of stripping such an amount of overburden that the remainder,
together with the limestone in the face, gives approximately a
chemical mixture suited to the manufacture of cement.
The Quarry is worked to a depth of approximately 150 ft,
and in reality the floor of the Quarry is nearly 100 ft, below sea
level. This level is attained by means of a tunnel of a -grade 1 in
36 and a total length of 4,376 ft, with a height of 14 ft, and a
width of 14 ft. This concrete lined tunnel was at the time of
construction the longest in Victoria, The raw material (limestone)
is won by means of large steam shovels weighing about 84 tons and
using a 2-g- cubic yard dipper. The stripping of the overburden is
carried on by another similar steam shovel using a 1 cubic yard
dipper. The stripping shovel fills the waste overburden into a
rake of trucks, which are hauled by a 20-ton locomotive and sent to
dump.
The limestone, on the other hand, is hauled into the
Works by a large locomotive of the articulated type - similar to
those used in many parts of the world for main line mountain
railways. This locomotive is capable of hauling 100 tons useful
load or a total load of 160 tons up the grade of the tunnel and
into the Works, The floor of the Quarry which would, on account

41


circumstances, is maintained in a dry state by means of drainage
drives placed about 20 feet below the floor of the tunnel, and which
are actually pushed ahead of the working face in such a way that
the water from these parts is drawn to one central station, from
which it is pumped into the Moorabool River by means of an electric
pumping station, specially designed to be secure against all floods.
Samples of the raw material are taken as soon as the
trucks are loaded on the Quarry floor, and the grade of the stone
is ascertained and sent to the Works by telephone so that the grade
of stone is already known by the time the train actually arrives
there. The length of haul from the Quarry to the Works is
approximately 2i miles, the track being 3*6” gauge. On arrival at
the Works, the raw material is automatically tipped into a mammoth
crusher having a capacity of 250 tons per hour. The trucks are of
the sldo~tipplng variety, and the tipping device, electrically
operated, is so arranged that one side door is open and the truck
tipped to discharge its contents to a moving conveyor which feeds
the crusher. The material Itself is reduced in one milling to a
fineness that it will pass about an tr” mesh sieve, and from the
crusher is hoisted to the raw storage department by means of inclined
belt conveyor. The crushed stone delivered by this belt conveyor
is picked up as desired by an overhead grabbing crane, which both
distributes the stone into storage and maintains the mill bins at
the required level.
RAW MILLING,
Prom the mill storage bins the stone reaches the raw
mills by means of a set of table feeders, which regulate the feed
into the tube mills and as the work is conducted under the wet
process, water is added at the same time. The material is crushed
in tube mills, which are roughly 36 ft, long 6 ft, in diameter and
are loaded with approximately 36 tons of steel balls. During its
passage through the mill, the raw material is reduced to such a
fineness as not to give more than 5 per cent residue on the 180
mesh sieve»
Prom the raw mills the "slurry” is elevated into a
number of testing silos where after agitation its grade is determined,
and it is then passed by electric pumps into an adjusting silo, in
which its grade is brought to the required standard by the addition
of either high or low slurry. When the pre-determlned grade has
been ultimately reached, the material from the adjusting silo is
released into storage basins, of which there are three, each
containing about 2,000 tons of slurry. These basins are about 60 ft,
in diameter and 12 ft. deep, and segregation is prevented by means
of a stirring device supplemented as required by air agitation.
BURNING IN ROTARY KILNS.
The slurry is then pumped to one end of the rotary kiln,
which consists of a large steel cylinder 400 ft. long, 10 ft. in
42


travels down the kiln, mooting an ever-increasing temperature due
to the combustion by pulverised coal which is being blown in at the
opposite end. The material is then gradually brought to a
temperature of about 2*700°P., at about which temperature a chemical
reaction takes place between the limestone and the clayey materials,
forming silicates and aluminates of calcium. This vmite heat
material, which is known as clinker, is then carried off in a
mechanical cooler, and on its discharge from this is carried along
to a clinker storage. At the present time the Company operates
four rotary kilns at the Works, which with the power plant consume
approximately 70,000 tons of coal per annum.
CEMENT MILLING„
Prom the clinker storage the material is fed as required
to the Cement Mills, which are the tube mills similar in appearance
to the raw mills. The clinker, mixed with a small quantity of
gypsum, is fed into these mills* When properly pulverised it passes
out through a screen as a finished product, when it is conveyed
mechanically to cement storage silos. At each stage of manufacture
tests are constantly made (at least every hour) to ensure that the
material is completely up to standard.
This testing system proceeds day and night throughout
every day of the year without intermission, which enables the
Company to fully guarantee the product to comply with the require-
ments of the Australian Commonwealth Engineering Standard Specifica-
tion,
BAGGING OF CEMENT,
Cement is pumped by mechanical pumps to the bagging
silos, to which are attached the bagging machines* These bagging
machines automatically weigh the bags while filling them through a
valve specially incorporated therein, and as the bags fall from the
bagging machine the valve is automatically closed so that no cement
can escape from the bag. The majority of cement today is bagged
in multi-wall bags of 4 or 5 ply paper which contain approximately
94 lbs, of cement or 1 cubic foot. As the bags leave the bagging
machine, they are taken up by a conveyor which passes them to
transport, either road or rail, and so they leave the Factory and
pass into the consumers hands.
POWER PLANT.
The Works are equipped with a high-class power plant,
consisting of three coal fired boilers which generate steam for all
purposes including the driving of two 3,000 kilowatt turbo
alternators, which provide all the electric power required for the
conduct of the Works operations.
43


Since the Inception of manufacture of cement at Geelong
3,234,068 tons of Cement have been produced up to the end of the
year 1942 - equal to 77,617,632 paper bagss- which taken at an
average value of four pound per ton is equal to £12,936,272,
As practically the whole of this cement has been used
in Victoria, it gives some idea of the importance of the cement
industry to Australia, when it is considered that there are ten
works operating in other States of the Commonwealth, These
industries have been built up over the years by private enterprise,
and far seeing men, often in the face of disappointment and
discouragement, and at a later stage, with the savings of the people
who pooled their resources in the belief that they may recover it
at any time, by the sale of their share to others in the pool. The
thousands of small sums of capital collectively enable the promotion
of large organisations which are able to do far more than any
multiplicity of small concerns unco-ordinated could ever do#
Large business organisations are capable of giving the
community the benefits of mass production needed in War time, and
are equally necessary in peace time to reach the scale of out
put required to support the Standard of living#
