dfpatched with orders for his return, in confequence
of the Convention with Spain.

which is now reduced by deaths to fifty-four.
The Marines anxioully look for the eftablifbment

who yet are unable to retire from full pay.

Advices have been received in town from Madras,
by means of the Victoria, a Genoefe (hip, which men-

the Rajab-of Travanccre, fioirt the syth of December
3789, when he (formed-and'was repulfed, til)'the be-
ginning of May laft, when he began to make Inch
preparations and approaches, as indicated a renewal
of >he attack.
The Madras forces, to the number of 19,000 men,
tli a fine train of artillery, had then taken the field,
i f the purpofe of entering Tippoo?s country to the
Southward, while the fiombay army, with 10,000
JViahratta horle, were to attack the Weltern frontiers,
and the Bengal and Nizim troops were to make a di-
Vernon to the Northward. '
Tippoo, finding by what active affittance the Rajah
was to be fupported, had already begun to makefome
overtures for a peace, which, it was fuppofed, would
not be attended to, till the advance of our, army
might induce hmi to conclude one upon terms very
favourable to our ally.

lome predatory incurlions on the borders of PennfyJ-
vania, had Captured thirteen Americans on the Ohio,'
whom they were carrying into bondage; but as they
paired the fort of Detroit, they were liberated through
the interpoljtion of Major Smith, Commandant of
that poll, who very humanely took them into the gar-
nlo'n, and, after providing them with proper necef-
ianes, lent them home under guides.
Martinico, which has for a long time paft been the
prey of its internal quarrels, has now a hope of fpeedy
accommodation. Letters dated the 23d of October
announce, that propofals For an adjuftment of differ-

tnat the long diffentions which have debilitated that
colony, appear likely to come to a happy conclufion.
Whoever confiders the effeds that the diftWery has
produced, not only in this, but all countries where it

ot giving a note to Catherine, who is much furprifed
at his appearance, explanatory, of his deligns to at-

THAT well-frequented HOUSE, called the NEW INN
of PETERHEAD, as prefently poffeffed by Andrew

bout three quarters of an acre, well inclofcd and fronting

ing, races, and other public diverfions, added to the fitua-
tion of the inn, being the very next door to the baths, mi-
neral wells, and aflcmhly rooms, from which it often re-
ceives great convenience, and the only houfe in town fre-
quented by company, ftrangers, and the principal inhabi-
tants, make it a molt eligible opening for a perfon properly
qualified for the bufiuels, who may foon make a very gen-
teel fortune.
Mr Cheves?s only inducement to fell this inn is being far

ry clear, may he fecn in the hands of Alexander Elies wai-
