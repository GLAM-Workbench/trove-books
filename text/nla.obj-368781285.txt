Prelude—SOLEMN MELODY (Walford Davies)
HYMN
Jesu, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O My Saviour hide,
Till the storm of life be past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh receive my soul at last.
Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless Soul on Thee;
Leave, Ah! Leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me;
All my trust on Thee is stay’d;
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the Shadow of Thy wing.
Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,.
Heal the sick and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name;
I am all unrighteousness;
Vile and full of sin I am;
Thou art full of truth and grace.
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound
Make and keep me pure within:
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all Eternity. Amen.
SENTENCES
PSALM XC
Lord, Thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to
another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth
and the world were made: Thou art God from everlasting, and
world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again Thou sayest, Come
again, ye children of men.
For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday:
seeing that is past as a watch in the night.
As soon as Thou scatterest them, they are even as a sleep;
and fade away suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the
evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.
For we consume away in Thy displeasure: and are afraid
at Thy wrathful indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before Thee; and our secret sins
in the light of Thy countenance.
For when Thou art angry, all our days are gone: we bring
our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are three-score years and ten; and
though men be so strong, that they come to four-score years; yet
is their strength then but labour and sorrow; so soon passeth it
away, and we are gone.
But who regardeth the power of Thy wrath: for even there-
after as a man feareth, so is Thy displeasure.


So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our
hearts unto wisdom.
Turn Thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto
Thy servants.
O satisfy us with Thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we
rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that Thou hast plagued
us: and for the years wherein we have suffered adversity.
Show Thy servants Thy work: and their children Thy glory.
And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon us:
prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us, O prosper Thou
our handy-work.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy
Ghost.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world
without end. Amen.

D.Ph.,
HYMN
Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom
Lead Thou me on.
The night is dark, and I am far from home;
Lead Thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.
I was not ever thus, nor pray’d, but Thou
Shouldst lead me on;
I loved to choose and see my path; but now.
Lead Thou me on.
I loved the garish day, and spite of fears
Pride ruled my will; remember not past years.
So long Thy power hath blessed me, sure it still
Will lead me on.
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent till
The night is gone
And with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
Amen.
