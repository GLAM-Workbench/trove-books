Once, in a tiny home burrowed deeply into a mossy bank
close to a village church, there lived a Mother and Father
Mouse, whose names were Pip and Pepita, and their four young
mice, Violet, Emily, Agnes and Jonathan.
There were purple violets growing round the door, and a
tiny painted sign hung above bearing the name of “The Whiff
of Cheese.”
Everything had gone along very happily for twelve months
until one very cold, wet night, which caused a family of

green frogs to invade the tiny home. Pepita, the mother mouse,
was horrified to find a cold wet frog in each of her spotless little
beds and muddy foot marks over each white pillow. No matter
how much she shooed and scolded, the frogs refused to move.
They stayed seated in the little beds, with Pepita’s much'
prized patchwork quilts over their shoulders. So there was
nothing else for it but for the whole of the little mouse family
to turn out and look for a new home.
After searching for many weary hours, they found it to
be no easy task, as all the usual little mouse haunts were filled
with refugees from the bombed towns round about. Tired and
discouraged, Pepita gathered her children round her and went
to spend the night with her old friend, Mrs. Ticklewhiskers,
who lived under a haystack nearby, whilst the father mouse
continued his search for a home. Hearing the organ playing
in the village church, Pip crept carefully inside to rest awhile,
and seeing a cheerful fire burning in the vestry behind the
organ, he carefully tiptoed inside, and sitting inside the fender
warmed his tired little toes, before curling up for a snooze
inside an empty cigarette packet nearby.
When Pip woke up he did not want to leave the cosy
room, and thought how nice it would be if he could find a home

in it for his rapidly growing family. On seeing a large
cupboard behind the door he scampered up inside, and with
his black beady eyes and bewhiskered little nose, searching and
sniffing, started to explore. He found the cupboard very dusty
inside and, judging by the cobwebs hanging about, was sure it
had not been used for a very long time.
On the top shelf was a large ball of red knitting wool, a
reel of green cotton, and a very large, very old loaf of bread!
As soon as Pip saw the loaf, he knew that he had found their
new home. With . his heart wildly beating with joy, he
scampered to the floor and out of the door to tell his family of
his discovery.
On hearing the good news, they at once set out to 'The
Whiff of Cheese" and started to pack what possessions they
could carry away with them, and just as the sun had started
to rise, they set out for their new home.
Pepita carried her precious pink parasol, her rolling pm. a
basket filled with jars of her home made rose cup jam, and a
tin of lollies for the children.
Emily insisted on carrying the brown tea pot; she was very
fond of a cup of tea at any time, and meant to make sure of

the tea pot's safe arrival. Her sister Violet's eyes were red and
swollen with weeping at leaving her old home, but she bravely
helped her brother Jonathan to carry the best tea set' packed
into a large wicker basket. Agnes, the other sister, more often
called Aggie, was always a bit of a problem, and over fond of
decking herself with odds and ends of ribbons and lace. She
made sure that her vanity bag holding her powder puff and
necklaces would arrive safely, and with this carried on one arm
and holding a dish of fruit in the other, tripped along without
a care in the world.
On arriving at the church, Pip proudly escorted his family
to their new home inside the cupboard in the church, where
everyone set to work with a will, and nibbled and nibbled until
first a little doorway was made, then a room up, and a room
down in the old loaf of bread. Cosy beds were made from the
red kmtting wool, and the red cotton became a very good
kitchen table. The crumbs they had nibbled out were swept
up and carefully stored away for future use, with other
carefully gathered morsels and titbits of food.
How happily Pepita went round her little beds in the new
home, now proudly named “The Upper Crust," and tucked
each baby safely in before kissing them goodmight, and blowing

One Sunday morning she caused a great to do by popping her little

out the candle. Then, one very exciting day, Pepita had a
new baby. It was another little girl, making four of them,
but this baby was quite different from the others, as her coat
was of purest white and soft as satin.
During the days that had to pass before her baby opened
her eyes, Pepita would gaze with longing at the cherubs on the
stained glass windows of the church, and wish that her baby
would grow to be just as beautiful as they were.
Then, one lovely morning when Pepita was rocking the
tiny mouse in a walnut shell cot, lovingly decorated by Aggie,
she saw her open her eyes, and that they were a beautiful
forgeMnemot blue.
Pepita swooned w r ith surprise and joy, and when she
recovered, ran to fetch the rest of the family. Between them
a name was chosen for the baby, and as her eyes w’ere of a
heavenly blue and her coat as white and glistening as a snow
flake, it was to be Angel.
As the weeks passed by, however, it soon became very
plain to see that she was by no means an angel in her ways,
but a perfect imp of mischief.

The lady organist became very friendly with Angel and brought her
biscuits to nibble, so that she would keep off the keys as Angel found
that they tickled her feet.


One Sunday morning, she caused quite a commotion
amongst the congregation, by popping her bewhiskered little
nose up out of the collecting box, just as Mrs. Pollie Perkins
was putting in her contribution. With a shriek the startled
lady jumped on to the pew seat, and gased in horror at the
little white mouse, who sat on the edge of the collecting box
preening her silken whiskers, before scampering down and
away out of the door.
The lady organist became very friendly with Angel and
brought her biscuits to nibble, to keep her off the keyboard
whilst she was playing. Angel found the vibration of the music
tickled her feet, and would not miss a hymn unless she could
help it.
And then there was the font where the babies were
brought to be christened time and time again Angel had to
be dragged out of the Holy water where she loved to frisk, by
members of the family, just as the christening was about to
take place.
One never'to'bedorgotten Sunday afternoon, she was seen
to emerge from the Vicar's coat tail pocket nibbling one of his

extra strong peppermints. Angel must have found it a little
too strong, as it made her eyes water, and a long drink of water
from the vicar’s glass on the pulpit was the only thing she
could think of to cool her burning mouth.
With one eye on the Vicar, she daintily balanced her small
person on the rim of the glass, before dipping her whiskers
inside and taking a long drink. The Vicar is a very kind and
wise man, and he simply smiled and looked the other way.
Usually at Evensong, all of Pip and Pepita’s children are
snugly tucked into their little red woollen beds, but if Angel
is missing they know exactly where they will find her. When
the tall white candles on the altar are lit at dusk and glow like
golden stars, they form a great attraction for Angel, she has
a wildly exciting time sliding down the tallest candle, and not
until she burns her long pink tail can she be chased off to bed
by Pepita waving her rolling pin.
And now I think we will leave Pip and Pepita and their
family for the present, and wish them all many, many happy
days to come, and hope that nobody will chase them out of
their little loaf home in the vestry cupboard, and that Angel
will always be the bright little imp she now is.
