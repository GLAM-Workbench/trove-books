THE
Australian Cricket Team of 1893,

Henry V. L. Stanton of "The Sportsman."


The Australian Cricket Team of 1803.
(By HENRY V. L. STANTON.)
* Cfyf HK cricket visits from Australia beneficial to the game in thin
country? I’is 1 ’is the question frequently asked me. My conscientious
9 reply would partake somewhat of a Hibernian character. The
more recent trips have certainly interfered greatly with our usual
county programmes, and the difficulties in this resi>ect have been increased
rather than lessened as far as the present season is concerned ; yet present
inconvenience must not be considered without reference to past benefits.
Had it not been for the successes achieved by the earlier combinations from
the Land of the Golden Fleece, the game in this country would, perhaps,
never have received the fillip it did some fifteen years ago, when the doings
of Murdoch, Siiofforth and others, took Kngland players by surprise, and m
a few weeks —it might even be said days—caused the prowess of the Colonials
to be one of the leading topics of oonveisation, from the swellest club down
to the taproom of the village “ pub.” By means of these Australian visits
county olul« have been enabled to vastly improve their financial i>Oßitionp,
and it is not too much to assert that Surrey’s proud itositiou at the present
time is greatly due to these biennial tri|)e, as also the vast improvements
which have been effected in the matter of accommodation at the Oval.
Space will not allow of reference to the various tours since Dave Giegory’s
team arrived in England in the May of 1878—my present duty being to
furnish my readers with short biographies of the members of the present
combination, and a few useful stall tics. Hitherto these trips have taken
place in alternate years, and the eighth visit had been 1 projtcted for 1892.
Considerable opposition was, however, manifested in county circles, it being
felt that the |K>or displays of the last few combinations scarcely justified the
continuance of these visits at such short intervals, more csjiecially as a
difficulty was *■ x)>erienced in raising sides that could l>e termed representative
of cricketing Australia. The trip was )>ostponed, but at the meeting of
county secretaries at Lord’s in December, 1891, when the subject was mooted,
Mr. Alcock hinted that the team l>e invited for 1893—0 r rather that the pro-
moters would be glad to know if they would be welcome in that season.
Further opjKjsition, however, unex]H*ctwlly sprung up, Mr. W. H. C. Oates
on behalf of Notts, Lord Hawke for Yorkshire, and Mr. A. J. Webbe for
Middlesex objecting, and eventually amotion was unanimously carried inviting
a team for 1894. Circumstances alter cases, however, and duiing the winter
of 1891-2 Lord Sheffield’s eleven, the most ]>owerful that has ever visited
the Anti|x>des from this country, met with unex))ected reverses in two of the
three great test matches, viz., at Melbourne and Sydney, and the effect on
cricket in Australia was marvellous Interest in the game, which had flagged
considerably, revived in a marked manner, and the suggestion that the victors
should cross the seas for the English f*eason of 1893 was cordially received in
both the Colonies and the Mother Country. The formation of an Austra-
lasian Cricket C nmoil. too, altered the conditions under which the tri|» will
in future be made, and instead of partaking more or less of the character of


a private speculation, the patronage of that body was rendered imperative,
and the Council made itself responsible for the representative character of
tha team. For a long time it was doubtful whether George Giffen would be
induced to make the journey; statements and counter-statements were issued,
but at last his consent was obtained. Karly in January the selecting com-
mittee—G. Giffen, Lyons, Blackham, Bruce, Turner, and Bannerman—
chose seven others who were approved of by the Australasian Cricket Council,
with the suggestion that there should be a fourteenth man. This was acted
upon, and A. Coningham, of New South Wales, called u|)on to complete the
party, which, with Mr. Victor Cohen, of Sydney, as manager, left Australia
in the Orient s.s. Orizaba at the mid die of March. It was resolved that it
would be better not to enlist the services of Mr. W. L. Murdoch, who had
become identified with English cricket, and Blackham was accordingly elected
captain. With the exception of the famous left-handed batsman, H. Moses,
who once more declined to undertake the journey—announcing his early
retirement from the game —the combination is undoubtedly representative of
Australian cricket, though possibly Dr. J. K. Barrett, F. Iredale, and J. Reed-
man have claims worthy of consideration to rank in the first fourteen in the
Colonies. How the trip will compare in its results with those of its pre-
decessors Time alone can reveal. In emulating the doings of 1880 and 1882
no light task is self-im]X)sed, and if the results of the latter tour are in any
approached, the promoters should feel satisfied beyond reasonable expectation.
In the subsequent pages will be found short biographies of the team, the
accompanying ]>ortraits being from excellent photographs, kindly furnished
by Messrs. E. Hawkins & Co., of 32, Preston Street (late 108, King’s Road},
Brighton.


John McCarthy Blackham.
(VICTORIA) (CAPTAIN).
When, at the time of the final selection of the team in January it waa
decided not to utilise the services of W. L. Murdoch, who by his
residence in England, was scarcely to be regarded as an Australian pure
and simple, it became necessary to look elsewhere for a captain for the
eighth Australian team. The disadvantages of appointing one of the lead-
ing bowlers of a side to officiate as “ skipper ” are too patent, and Blackham
was selected for the post. A better choice could not have been made as the
amous Colonial wicket-keeper is a thorough judge of the game, and enjoys,
moreover, the unique position of having formed one of every combination
that haa visited ua from the land of the Golden Fleece. To find space for
anything like a detailed biography would be imjioasible; so familiar too is
Blackham to English cricketers, and the cricket going public of this countiy
that an ajxilogy is almost needed for the introduction of a brief outline.
He was born at Fitzroy, a suburb of Melbourne, on May 11, 1855, and stands

though it must be admitted that his style is n >t of the most correct descrip-
tion, and for the C triton ( Melbourne) he for some time rendered good
service with the bat. His claims, however, scarcely mot wi h proper
recognition, and at the invitation of Mr. J. Conway, the manager of the
first Australian trip to England, he joined the South Melbourne, with whom
he first acquired fame as a wicket-keei>er. In 1874 he represented Victoria
against New South Wales, and ainoe then has become the greatest wicket-
keeper which the world has ever ee-'ii, though even (our years later than the
date just mentioned, critics were divided in opinion as to whether Murdoch
was not his equal. To stand uptoSpotforth was no light task, yot Blackhain
not only did so but dispensed with a long-stop, and set a which
others have since followed. Every kind of ball whether on the off or leg side
is taken with app nrenbease, and closer to the wicket than by any of his contem-
poraries. Though thirty-eight years of age his agility is as great as ever,
and on the occasion of his last visit he was if anything in better form than on
the two previous occasions. In the few matches in which he has played but
not kept wicket he has proved that he is a brilliant field at mid-otf. As a
batsman he is possessed of plenty of pluck, and there is no more dangerous
man on the side to turn the scales after the cracks have been easily disposed
of. On an emergency he can also howl if required. His highest score in this
country is 98 against Warwickshire at Birmingham in 1888, but he has
beaten this in Inter-Colonial matches at home. During the first half of the
recent Australian season a whitlow prevented him from appearing, but in

Alerander C. Bannerman
(NEW SOUTH WASES).
With the exception of Blackham, Bannerman has been as frequent a visitor
to English shores as any Australian cricketer, the occasions uiion which hedid
not form one of the party being 1886 and 1800. “Stonewalling” as tha
cautious or “block, block, block ” style of cricket is termed may not be very
entertaining to watch, but there are many occasions when it is the correct
game, and the inclusion of a batsman who can play this style to petfeotion is
advisable, more especially on the variable wickets of England. “Alec”
Banner-man is a past master of the art of defence, free from the slightest
suspicion of nervousness, and |K>ssea»ing inexhAns'ahle patience. He was
born at Sydney on March 2lst, 1859, and is consequently no youngster, hav-
ing completed his thirty-fourth year. He served his apprenticeship with


junior teams until 1876, when he joined the Warwick clnb, one of the beet
in theoonital. His elder brother Charles was, about this period, in his best
form, while ‘‘Alec’s” very first apjrearnnoe on the Sydney Association
gwund resulted in a fine innings of IG9 not out. He accompanied hi*
brother to England with the pioneer team in 1878, the difference in the two
styles aa the pair opened the deb nee being most marked. With the excep-
tion, however, of 71 not out in the Orleans club match at Twickenham, he
■did not meet with great success in the eleven a-side fixtures. On bis return
kome ho represented his Colony, and when the second team was formed, was
one of the first selected for the trip. Though an accident kept him out of
the later matches, he secured nn average in the few eleven a-side games of 16,
while in all he obtained over 700 runs, and stood third on the list. In 1882
ho had improved to 22 per effort, and against I. Zingari, at Scarborough,
obtained 120 and was still not out In 1884 he was in tin quite so good form,

old steadiness during that di-astrous tour which ojreued so auspiciously, and
exhibited such a display of “in and out form” os Irordered almost on the
ridiculous. Since then he has has well maintained his place in the first
eleven of Australia, and played several good innings against Lord Sheffield’s

George Giffen
(SOUTH AUSTRALIA).
A cricket team from Australia without George Giffen is tantamount to a
combination visiting the Colonies from Kngland without W. G. Grace at a
period when that champion of champions was at his prime, for Giffen has been
for years, and still is, the best all-round player in Australia. To give even
an outline of his career is a matter of great difficulty in the limited space at
disposal, but happily his later achievements are us familiar to cricket
enthusiasts in this country as household words. With him away much of the
interest in the tour would have evajwrated, and it was with feelings of relief
after statements and counter-statements that he definitely resolved to form
one of the party, and set sail on the Orizaba , on this his fourth visit to the
mother country. Giffen first saw the light in Adelaide, March 27th, 1850,
and as far as club cricket is concerned certainly made his name in connection
with the Norwood C.C. of that city. His achievements, prior to his first
inclusion in a team for Kngland in 1882, had not been very great, though
there had been some talk of his forming one of Murdoch s combination in
1880. Prior to tins he played for South Australia against Lord Harris’s
team in the opening match of the tour, but at this time eighteen of the Colony
were tackled, and successfully too. Giffen wasa failure with the bat, “bagging
a brace,” but fairly successful with the ball. Against Shaw’s first team at
Adelaide in 1881-2 Giffen, by sterling cricket, made 95, the contest being
abandoned as a draw. He thereby gained his place in another heavy scoring
match, appearing but a few days later for Australia at Melbourne, whenhescored
30, and fielded well. His selection by Murdoch soon followed, and he duly
formed one of the strongest side which the Colonies have ever sent over.
From this point his doings are universally known. Put on to bowl in the
opening engagement at Oxford he captured seven wickets in the second
innings for 78 runs, and proved valuable all round throughout the tour. His
best batting score was 81 against Liver|x>ol and district, then almost a county
team. Before he visited us again he had made a marked advance with both
bat and ball, and his claim to be considered the premier cricketer of Australia
was no idle one. He iiad an average in 1884 of over 20, and against
Lancashire soured 113, while v. Kngland at Lord’s he was responsible for 63.
In bowling, though uncertain, he had several brilliant analyses. In 1886 he
was still better —heading the batting and bowling with one three-figure innings,
sending down most overs and taking most wickets, so that the disadvantage

the Colonies, though not very successful against Lord Sheffield’s team. He
is a clean hitter, possessing great driving jiowers, and is therefore especially
dangerous on fast wickets. He bowls medium pace, with plenty of break,
taking a long run and having a rather peculiar method of delivery, and is a
fine field. Nor has he confined his attention to cricket, having secured gre»

Charles Thomas Biass Turner
(NEW SOUTH WALES).
What SjxifTorth was to the earlier teams has the deserved It- popular New
South Welshman been to the later combinations, their mainstay in bowling,
and a name to conjure with. In addition to this, however, Turner excels in
other departments of the game, being a good hitter end an excellent field,
and a genial, unassuming companion withal. Born at Bathurst, on
November ]6, 1802, Turner has completed his 30th year. He was educated
at the local Grammar School, but it was not until well advanced in his
teens that he displayed any great ability at the summer game, when, during
the visit of Lord Harris and his team in 1878-9 he opposed the Kneli.-htpen
on behalf of the Bathurst 22, but without success. Two years later, howevtr,
against Shaw and Shrewsbury’s combination he achieved a remarkable per-
formance, taking all ten wickets in the second innings for 36 tuns. Abut
1883 he removed to Sydney, and apjieartd for New South Wales against
the Hon. Ivo Bligb's team. The occasion was disastrous, the Englishmen

gaining three figures. Murdoch and several others of his team were not
playing, and Turner** share was only 4 and 2 with the bat, while his capture
•of Vernon’s wicket cost his side 76 runs. He first appear'd in an Inter-
colonial in 1885, and since then has been a regular memlier of the N.S.W.
elevens. In 1886-7 he met with marked success against Shaw's team, in the
first match taking 6 for 20 and 7 for 34, and a month later 7 for 77. This
secured his introduction in the All Australia team, when he actually had
Harlow, Barnes, Gunn, Briggs, Flowers, and Scotton at a cost of 16 runs I
Tn the final match for his colony he captured 14 wickets for 69 runs, and in
the return Australia contest had 9 for 93. He was now acknowledged as the
best bowler in the Coh nies, and was naturally seheted to vinit England in
1888. With the lion share of the bowling. Turner and Ferris met with
marvellous success, on wickets, it is true, for the most part favruiing them,

captured 314 wickets, at a cost of little over 11 runs apiece ) In 1890,
though they could scarcely hope to rej>eat their phenomenal success, the
pair again did wondeifully well, and since that time Turner's reputation
nas suffered not a whit, though on the bard, fast * ickets of Australia it is
impossible to attain the figures credited to bowlers in our more versatile
•climate. Against Lord Sheffield's team he assisted not a little towards the
two defeats of the Englishmen in the test matches, while for his colony he
bowled well in the first fixtu»e, and scored 66 in the return Turner, though
standing only about 6ft. 9in., has wonderful command ovrr the ball, bowling
rather above medium pace, with a delightfully easy delivery, and a fine
off-break. He also bowls a “ yorker," which gets up in an astonishingly
rapid fashion from the pitch.

William Bruce
(VICTORIA).
Previous to the visit of the Melbourne Club team in 1886, much had been
tieard, and great expectations formed of the young Victorian, who, though
new to English grounds, was regard* d with the greatest promise in view of
his reputation in Australia. When the tour dewed in the autumn, however,
he had failed to greatly impress our bowlers with the idea that he was an
unusually diffi ult bat to get rid of, though on several occasions be had
played steiling cricket, while his left-handed deliveties—not unlike
Wootton's in style—had only si cured thirteen wi kets at the cost of nearly
fifty runs apnee. That this was not his true form has since amply demon-
strated in the colonies, where ho is in the very fbst flight of batsmen, and
general satisfaction is felt at his inclusion in the present combination —to the
regret maybe of English bowlers ere the programme < f th*- Colonials is
brought to a close. Bruce was born at South Varra, a suburb of Melbourne, in

form in 1881 gained him admission to the ranks of the premier club, and the
following season found him worthily introduced into the first eleven of the
M.C.C. On January 12th, 1884, playing on the Melbourne ground, he
scored 328 not out against Hotham, which until recently remained the record
individual score for Australia. It should be mentioned that following the
fashion in the colonies the game was played on two {Saturday afternoons,
his inning*, which was not against weak bowling, being characterised
by vigour, without recklessness, and good all-round play. About this
time he played in his first Inter-Colonial, but failed to come off, though
better success attended his efforts v. the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team. in
1884-5, during the presence of Shrewsbury and his comrades in the
Antipodes, Bruce (who, owing to the refusal of Murdoch’s 1884 team
to op|x>se the Englishmen, found several chances of taking ])art in repre-
sentative fixtures), rendered good service with* bat and ball, and his
displays with the willow during the following season gained him his place in
the 1880 combinatian for home—with what result has already been
mentioned. He was credited, however, with one of the five hundreds
scored during the tour, obtaining 100 v. Mr. C. I. Thornton’s XL, at
Chiswick Bark. After his return home professional duties kept him for a
while from devoting so much time to the game, but against Lord Sheffield’s
team and in the leading matches of the last two or three seasons he has played
at his very best. He stands about sft. 10in., and is most keen on the game.
T.hough he bats as well as bowls left-handed he is a much prettier batsman
than the majority of left-handed players, and is especially “sweet”
on off-drives. Ambidextrous, he is a smart field, and, in addition, a pretty
safe catch.

Alfred Comingbam
(NEW SOUTH WALES).
Born in South Melbourne in 1800, Coningham removed to Brisbane about
ten years ago. When first heard of in England in connection with Australian
cricket, this player was identified with Queensland, and for this Colony he
bowled with success against Shaw and Shrewsbury's team in December, 1887.
Transferring his residence to Sydney he took part in both encounters between
New South Wales and Victoria this season, in the second match, when
practically a substitute, playing a capital innings of 30, and capturing 4
wickets for IK), and 5 for 71) runs resjjectively. With the bat he is not a
scientific player, though he frequently score*, hitting with freedom. His
left-handed deliveries are unlike those of any other meml>er of the side, and
he has a fast ball with a break from leg. which is thought likely to damage
on English wickets, though he usually bowls medium pace with a break from
the off.


Walter Frank Giffen
(SOUTH AUSTRALIA).
Though one of the faces new to England, there was, some five yeais ago,
every expectation that the younger Giffen would visit us with the combina-
tion then in course of formation to undertake the tour of 1888. For certain
reasons neither he nor his brother made the journey, and in the present
instance there would also appear to have been critics ready to deny the
wisdom of his choice in preference to Keedman. Iredale, and other rising
players. Of this perhaps the results of the tour will afford the best verdict.
Like his elder brother, whom he greatly resembles, Walter Giffen was bom
in Adelaide, and is now in his thirtieth year, the exact date of bis birth being
September 10th, 1803. After a short association with a junior club, he joined
the Norwood, and qualifying first for the second eleven, steadily and
patiently worked his way into the first, and about ten years back established
himself in tue front rank of South Australian batsman. In the season
1883-4 be twice played against the team then being marshalled for home
under the captaincy of Murdoch, and when representing South Australia
against Victoria was credited with 20 and a faultless 80. Against English
sides he has been decidedly unfortunate, and though for South Australia he
made 42 not out against Lord Sheffield’s team, his four efforts with the bat
on behalf of All Australia did not yield a double figure aggregate. He is
rather of the steady order, though he can also hit, while there is no need for
anxiety when the ball travels to his portion of the field.
Barry Graham
(VICTORIA).
When the names of the prssent team were first announced by cable rather
earlier than exjiected - -about the middle of January—nut a few were puzzled
as to the identity of the “ Graham ” mentioned therein. Members of Lord
Sheffield’s team, however, remembered the smart fielding of a young
Melbourne player in the second match against Victoria when he came out as
a substitute, whiie in due course Colonial exchanges not only confirmed the
cable, but advanced good reasons for the choice. Born in Carlton, Melbourne,
on November 2i), 1870, and educated at Berwick Grammar School, he has for
several seasons been identified with the South Melbourne Club, and on
December 10 last, in a fixture against North Melbourne played a tine innings
of 202. Selected to represent Victoiia against New South Wales at Christ-
mas he scored 30 in creditable fashion, and then had the misfortune to hit
his wicket; but this he put in the shade a week later when, playing against
South Australia, he partnered Barrett at the fall of the fourth wicket of the
Victorian second venture, and stayed till the match had been won. His
e.asy style, confidence and finish evoked loud applause and “ Felix ”
{iraised him most highly. His selection to undertake the journey to Eng-
and followed in a fortnight, and that his previous shows had been no fluke
was shown by further contributions of 31) (run out) and G 5 (1 b w) from his bat
when Victoria and New South v\ales again met in Sydney at the end of
.January. In style he is not unlike Trott. He only stands sft. GAin M weigh-
ing DAst., but he makes up in vigour for what he lacks in stature/ He is also
a prominent football player.

Arthur Barwood Jarvis
(SOUTH AUSTRALIA).
No bigger mistake has been made in connection with the constitution of
the Australian teams to virit this country than was committed on the
occasion of the trip of 1890, when no relief wicket-keeper was brought, Bum,
who was selected for that post being discovered, when the ship had started
for England, to he altogether new to the duties. It was not likely that such a
terrible error would be repeated, and in once more obtaining the services of
A. H. Jarvis, Mr. Cohen has secured a “ keeper” second only to Blackham,
though on the present occasion the claims of Lewis were strenuously advocated
in some quarters. Thisisthefnurth occasion on which he ha« visited thiscounfcry,
his first appearance on English soil being in 1880. Born at Hindmarsh,
near Adelaide, on October 18th, 1800. Jarvis became identified with local
cricket at an early age. One of his first efforts of note was for Fifteen of
South Australia against Gregory’s 1878 team, prior to its leaving for
England. Good batting and wicket-keeping against the same side on its
return, and also by the team captained bv Lord Harris, led to his selection
to visit the Mother Country in 1880, and though he did nothing startling he
proved useful with bat and gloves. Steadily improving, be gained the
highest honours in Australia, and though the misfortune of being a
contemporary of such a marvel as Blackham naturally handicapped him, the
quarrel between the latter and the Victorian Association in 1884-3 led to
Jarvis representing All Australia with success behind the wickets. He was
selected as one of the Melbourne Club team in 1888, and met with a large
amount of success in that unlucky combination, having an average of 17 for
all matches, and being second to S. P. Jones in r* presentative contests with
27. Two seasons later, when he again vi-uited us he was most unfortunate
with the bat, but recently he has exhibited a return of his old form, and
played a useful innings of 06 (not out) for South Australia v. Victoria at the
opening of the present year. He has a free, dangerous style of batting, but
is rather too anxious after a while to score. On a hard ground there are few
plavers more likely to make runs, and score them at a rapid p*o% too. His
ability as a has already been highly spoken of. He is a
good-natured, happy-go-lucky fellow, rather unorthodox at speech-making.

In 1880 Jarvis stumjied 5 and caught 2; in 1886 stumped 8 and naught

John James Lyons.
(SOUTH AUSTRALIA.)
Thirty years ago—to be more exact on May 21, 1863 —this genial South
Australian first saw the light at Gawler, near Adelaide. From his earliest
days he has been closely associated with Walter Giffen, and with him played
first for the Park, and afterwards for the Norwoods, the leading cricket team
in the South Australian capital. In his first season with the latter (1882) he
secured an average of 23, and gradu dly increasing hia ex|>erience as a bats-
man, which he supplemented bv trying his hand with the leather, he in 1885
was selected to represent his colony aeain«t Victoria, scoring double figure#
on each occasion and a well-played 30 against Shaw’s team. A season later
fIBB6 C) he performed equally well, and in the November following against a
farther combination taken over by Alfred Shaw he made 27 and 43, and was

credited with six of the visitors' wickets for 98 runs. His club cricket for tbs
Norwoods and his displays against Mr, Vernon’s team led to his securing a
place in the 1888 oomoinatiun fur England, while he also represented
Australia, though in the fixtures against Shrewsbury's team —which was
(unfortunately for both) touring at the same time, he was singularly unfor-
tunate. Nor can it be said that his appearance with the ill-fated 1883 party
was a triumph. Given at the outset liitle show, he time after time failed to
register double figures and was left out for several engagements. With the
arrival of August he played his first creditable innings (32) at Hastings, and
against England at Manchester on a bowler's wicket was top scorer in a
couple of disappointing shows. The statistics for representative matches
found him second to “ Sammy ” Jones, but in all fixtures he was seventh, and
towards this a score of 84 at Hastings assisted materially; He had, how*
ever, giv«m evidence that he could play the game, and when he again visited
us in 1890, going in first with Dr. Barrett, he fared much better, though he
developed a style of fearlessness that bordered on the reckless. His best
achievements were at Lords, where at the Cricketers’ Fund benefit he only
lacked one run to secure the coveted “ century.” On several occasions he
met with undoubted success with the ball, his medium pace bowling with
high delivery causing considerable damage to English wickets in the fiist
innings of the test match at Lord’s. After his return home the tall, good-
natured South Australian proved of what he is cajiable by several splendid
batting displays—notably his 134 for Combined Australia against Lord
Sheffield's team at Sydney, and contributions of 104 and 145 in Inter-Colonial
matches. This last season he scored 124 against New South Wales, who had
the misfortune early to give him a second innings.

Robert W. McLcod
(VICTORIA).
Australia is not without her cricket brotherhoods, her Studds, Lytteltons,
and Walkers, and one of the chief of these is the McLeods, of whom the
subject of this sketch is the fourth. Robert McLeod, who is. like Walter
Giften and Graham, new to English cricket fields, is the son of a well-known
shi)>ping owner, and was born at Port Melbourne, on January 19ch, 1868, and
is then fore in his twenty-sixth year. When but fifteen years of age he
exhibited such form with the bat that he was credited with a score of 144 not
out, while he was equally successful with the ball. Joining the Port Mel-
bourne club he now became identified with cricket of a better class, and in
a match against South Melbourne, for which Trott, Walters, and others were
playing, secured 6 wickets for 12 runs on a batsman’s pitch. A little later he
transferred his services to the last-named club, but for a time, owing to ths
requirements of business, played but little. In 1889, however, when still
under age, hq had blossonv-d into an Inter-Colonial player, and did very well
with the ball against both New South Wales and South Australia. Throw-
ing in his lot with Melbourne, the stalwart young Victorian —he stands quite
an inch over 6ft.—sjieedily develojied into one of the la?st all-round players in
Australia, though fora time luck was apparently dead against him, and ha
just missed his place in more than one Inter-Colonial fixture, although ho had
a batting average of 50 for his club. Ab Christmas, in 1891, hesoored 87, and

took 6 wickets against New South Wales, and batted well for bis club against
Lord Sheffield’s team. This paved the way to a place in the All Australia
Eleven at Melbourne, in which he fully justified selection, and he captured
W. G. Grace, A. E. Stoddart, and Abel in five balls. In the other test
engagements of the Englishmen he did better with bat than ball, and wound
up the season with an average for the Melbourne club of nearly 90, thanks
to an aggregate of 029 for three successive attempts, one of which amounted
to 324. Last Christmas his bowling was very serviceable against New South
Wales, but in the encounter with South Australia, which followed, he was
content with 6 runs, and no wicket for 83. He bats left, but bowls right-
handed, his cricket being of the steady style, and his deliveries about medium
pace. He keeps a good length, varying his ball (which comes up fast from
the pitch without much change in his delivery, while as a field he is safe, if
not particularly dashmg.
(George Henry Steven Crott
(VICTORIA).
Until more recently known as “ Harry,” Trott has in the two tours in
which he has taken part in this country undeniably asserted his claim to
be reckoned a first-class cricketer. When hist he visited us, he had not
many months attained his majority, having been bom in Collingwood, a
suburb of Melbourne, on August 5, 1800. Every career has a beginning,
and the junior club in which Trott first displayed cricket ability was the
Capulets. So ra]>id, however, was his advancement that in 1884-5 he
transferred his services to the South Melbourne, where ho seedily attained
a jiosition in both batting and bowling second to none. Under these
circumstances it was scarcely likely that his claims would be overlooked by
the Victorian authorities, and for that colony against the Melbourne Club
team for England at the commencement of 1887 he scored IS (not out).
After being credited with 200 (not out) in a club game with Bt. Kilda, he
was chosen to play for Victoria against South Australia, when he made
54 not out, and took in all 7 wickets for 121 —a marvellous dilvt in Inter-
colonial cricket. In 1886-7, though Victoria were badly beaten by Shaw’s
third team he claimed four wickets { and a little later he apjieared against
the same combination as a substitute in the 1880 team, after its return home,
for George Giffon. When the next side was being got together, he was
one of those chosen, and his consistent excellence with the bat was one of
the features of the none - too • successful trip. His slow break did not
apparently puzzle our batsmen as expected, hut he made an admirable point,
and his form with the “willow” is pretty clearly indicated by the fact
that he secured third place with an average not far short of twenty, and
an aggregate of over twelve bundled runs. In 1890 his figures were very
similar, and his i*>sition identical, but he was not quite so consistent in
his run getting. Against Lord Sheffield’s team in the Colonies in 1801-2,
he was singularly disappointing, but this season returned to form.
Against New South Wales, at Melbourne, at Christmas, he played innings
of 63 and 70 (not out), contributing in no small degree to the success of the
Victorians, while he also reached double figures in his other two efforts
against that colony in the return, and South Australia, at Mell>ourne. It
cannot be claimed, however, that his “curly” bowling has recently worked
much havoc.

Hugh Crumble
(VICTORIA).
For years the name of Trumble has been associated with Victorian
cricket. Mr. J. \V. Trumble, an elder brother, formed one of the
Melbourne Club team to visit England in 1886, and since then a younger
scion of the house, the subject of the present sketch, has also formed one of
a combination for “ home ” —to wit in 1890. Mr. H. Trumble was born in
Melbourne on May 12, 1867, and displayed talent with both bat and ball
while at the Hawthorn Grammar School. On leaving he joined the
Melbourne Club, and, exhibiting excellent form, his achievements led to
higher honours. Against South Melbourne and Melbourne he was so deadly
that he played with his brother against Mr. Vernon’s team in 1887-8 in
several fixtures with but moderate success, though against New South Wales
he managed to secure seven wickets in the first innings for 56. In the
return, on a fast wicket, the Welshmen ran up a total of 576, and, like the
others, Trumble found his deliveries severely punished. It was in 1889-90
that he met with marked success, and his consistently good form had the
effect of bringing about his inclusion in the team for England at the
close of that season. It cannot be claimed, however, that he
covered himself with glory, as, though straight and bowling
a good length, his “resource” was not great—ana a trundler sadly
needs variety. He was not chosen in the first eleven of Australia
against Lord Sheffield’s team, but has since performed consistently well.
Like Turner his deliveries may be classed as rather above medium )>ace; he
has an off-break and a fast ball, which, on a queer wicket, sometimes proves
very deadly. He is not a great field, but can claim to be the giant of the
party, standing fully Oft. 3in. in his stockings.

Sydney Edward Gregory
(NEW SOUTH WALES).
The name of Gregory was one of the earliest connected with the visits
of Australian cricketers to the Mother Country, and the subject of this
sketch may at once be said to be the nephew of Dave Gregory, the captain
of the first Australian team, while his father, Ned, Curator of the Sydney
Association Ground, was in his day one of the best batsmen in the Colony.
Reared, as it were, in a cricket atmosphere from the very cradle, it is small
matter for surprise that young Sydney, who was bom on April 14, 1870, at
the great Australian city of that name, should have early displayed a liking
for the game in which, though still very young, he has attained such pro-
minence. About six years ago he played for a junior team, the Orientals,
and opposed Shaw and Lillywhite’s combination for the youngsters, his
feat of bowling Harnes’ middle stump somewhat atoning for his failure with
the bat. For a time he was content to make good scores in club cricket,

but consistent form in 1889-90 brought him to the fore, and in January of
the latter year he opposed Victoria, batting in good style for his 27. He
also did well against S »uth Australia and Queensland, and was selected
to till one of the vacancies which occurred at the last moment in the 1890
team for England. If his batting scarcely fulfilled exiiectati ns, his brilliant
fielding was the talk of everyone, and many an Englinh batsman found to
his cost that “the youngster at extra mid-off had lost him his wicket,” his
pick up being clean, and his return marvellously quick and accurate. His
height—less than five feet five inches—which is all the more striking when
compared with other members of the team, is against him, yet he bats with
considerable freedom, no lack of strokes, and plenty of confidence. The
strain of a long tour appeared in 1890, however, to be too much for him,
and his average fell gradually away. He can bowl a little, and is a very
unassuming little player, most popular with his comrades in the field.
