A Plea for the Study of
the Classics.
Inaugural Lecture
delivered before the
Classical Association of Victoria
22nd April, 1913,

The lecture is printed practically as delivered.
If apology be needed for its colloquial style, the
writer can only plead lack of sufficient leisure to
recast it in a more literary form.


H jpiea for tbe Stub? of tbe
Claoeko.
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel no small pride in appearing before
you to-night in the honourable position of
first President of The Classical Association of
Victoria. Yet I have serious misgivings that
I may have accepted too lightly an honour
which carries with it a grave responsibility.
On one point I must at the outset put myself
right with my audience. If I could have had
my way, the office of President would have
been far more worthily filled, and you cannot
possibly regret more than I that the Inaugural
Address is not being now delivered to you by
the most distinguished scholar in the com-
munity, one whose name is known and hon-
oured by classical students not only in Aus-
tralia but all the world over.
Our rules direct that the President open the
year?s proceedings with an address on our aims
and objects. By passing this rule you have,
with your eyes open, prescribed for yourselves
your lecturer, and for him his theme. My
task, then, at this our first meeting must be to
endeavour to justify the founding of the Asso-


ciation, and to vindicate the claim of classics
to recognition as an important instrument of
education.
The attacks on classical study in recent
years give much food for thought. The study
of the classics is on its trial as never before,
and the arguments against it have been pressed
home with great vigour. In the United King-
dom there are now only two Universities which
make Greek essential for the Arts degree. In
the Dominions the Universities one by one
have been abandoning it. Melbourne was one
of the last to hold the fort of Hellenism; but
by the end of this year, unless through some
special interposition of Providence, which I
fear I have not faith enough to expect, it will
be possible to obtain our Arts degree without
knowing the Greek alphabet. The youngest of
Australian, indeed of all Universities, the one-
year-old baby University of Perth, has al-
ready, young as she is, damned herself to ever-
lasting fame as the only University in the Em-
pire, if not in the world, that has no Classical
Chair. So, by the end of this fateful year
Adelaide will be the one University in the
Empire, outside England, which still demands
Greek for the Arts degree. She will then de-
serve better than ever the role that Mr. Foster
Fraser assigned her in historic words, still
rankling in the Melbourne breast. Perhaps all
do not realise how rapidly the study of Greek


has been decaying in English-speaking coun-
tries. One illustration may suffice. There are
in the United States more than ten thousand
secondary schools. In the vast majority of
these no provision whatever is now made for
the teaching of Greek, and in a single decade
the pupils in Greek have dropped below one
per cent. Turn where we may, the classical
position in education is seriously threatened;
and so, none too soon, have those who believe
that to drop classics from the curriculum of
our schools and Universities would be an
educational calamity, begun to band them-
selves together in Classical Guilds in various
parts of the world, for the purpose of vindi-
cating for the two ancient languages their
educational value. At the same time they are
setting themselves earnestly to study the ques-
tion whether classics, where still taught, are
being used so as to yield the best results in cul-
ture, and, if not, to examine the causes of
failure with a view to remove them.
Here in Australia we are following the
example of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
Each of these countries has had for some years
a flourishing Classical Association. The Eng-
lish one has a members? roll of a thousand,
containing many distinguished names. Among
its members are: ?Lords Milner and Cromer,
Lord Halsbury, Lord Curzon, the Rt. Hon.
James Bryce, and Sir Archibald Geikie. Mr.


Asquith was its President last year. Though
Melbourne has given a lead to the rest of the
Commonwealth in many intellectual move-
ments, yet in the cause of classical culture she
is only following in the wake of Sydney and
Adelaide. Let us not grudge our sisters the
honour of priority; but take care that our
Association, once started, shall not lag behind.
Beyond all doubt the principal, though not
the only, reason why the popularity of the
classics, especially of Greek, has waned, is to
be found in the enormously rapid progress of
the applied sciences, and in their close relation
with the work of life. Applied science, in
fact, means money, and often means money
early in life. No wonder that such studies are,
in a money-worshipping age, and especially in
communities devoted to commerce, the most
attractive of all studies. Greek makes no
direct, instantly understood, appeal to material
interests; and therefore by those who do not
recognize that the main purposes of education
in the truest sense is not to amass information,
to be turned to account in a trade or profes-
sion, but rather to cultivate mental and moral
power, Greek is likely to be neglected. True,
Greek and Latin are not the only subjects that
have suffered from the spirit of utilitarianism.
All subjects, especially the more difficult ones,
which cannot at the first glance show a face
value in � s. d., are sharing the same fate. The


higher mathematics and the higher depart-
ments of philosophy are perhaps even more
despised than classics by your man of push;
and yet it is just these, the most difficult,
and what the Gradgrinds call the most
?useless,? subjects, that supply the strongest
mental stimulus and furnish the community
with its best leaders and thinkers.
A liberal education is sharply distinguished
from one that is technical or professional. The
distinction is at least as old as Plato. In his
days, one went to the philosophers and artists
for a liberal education, to the sophists to be
trained for a profession. The aim of a liberal
education is to develop the mind and consci-
ence for their own sakes; the aim of a profes-
sional education is obvious. In most cases
both are necessary, but the liberal education
should come first. The essential qualities of a
liberal education have been well set forth by
the late Dr. James Adam, a fine scholar too
early lost to us.* In the first place, he shows
how a liberal education implies the power
of intellectual sympathy, the faculty of enter-
ing into another man?s thoughts, of appreciat-
ing his point of view, and recognizing the in-
herent necessity of his creed and conduct; in
the next place, how it involves the training of
character no less than intellect, or, more cor-
* See pp. 215 ff. in The Vitality of Platonism , <bc., of which I have
made free use.


rectly speaking, of the whole character
through the intellect. Let us examine how
far a classical training satisfies these two con-
ditions. ?The faculty of intellectual sym-
pathy,? says Dr. Adam, ?belongs only to the
man who is liberally educated. In dealing with
their fellow-men others are tyrants and perse-
cutors, he alone is tolerant. Nor is his intellec-
tual sympathy confined to his own age and
nation. He can enter into the thoughts and
feelings of other nations, and other times,
however remote, and can move among the
mighty minds of every generation, as if they
were his kindred.? How true this is.
Do we not feel that Mr. Gilbert Mur-
ray, or the late Professor Butcher, would
be as much at home with the men of
Euripides? day as with those of the twen-
tieth century? A classical education, then,
aims at an intense and vivid realization of the
feelings and thoughts of the peoples of Greece
and Rome, at an ideal reconstruction of Greek
and Roman antiquity. The further a boy goes
in his studies, the more will his imagination
be exercised by this task. The very remote-
ness of the age with which he is dealing, and
the unfamiliarity of the figures and scenes will
have the effect of widening his mental hori-
zon, and also begetting a humbling and whole-
some sense of the extent to which our vaunted
achievements are the results of our forerun-


ners? efforts. With the true scholar the soul
of the author he is reading passes into him,
and he lives in his author?s world.
This is what justifies spending so much
time on Greek and Latin composition.
Of course, if sympathy be lacking, every-
thing is lacking; but suppose that sympathy
is there, then the close study of Greek and
Latin style that prose and verse composition
involves, brings us nearer to the mind of the
ancient Greeks and Romans. So also the
minute study of Latin and Greek grammar is
to be defended for this reason, that it explains
to us the habits of mind and feeling of the
ancients. To neglect the force of one of those
delicate instruments of thought and feeling,
the Greek particles, may mean to miss the true
purport of some noble passage in Greek litera-
ture, and, so far, to fail in re-creating some
great phase of Greek life and thought. You
may remember that De Quincey airily dis-
missed the whole of the Greek particles with
the remark that they were ?all just exple-
tives?; but he ought to have been ashamed of
himself.
One main purpose, then, of classical educa-
tion is to effect by the study of literature, his-
tory, and archaeology, what it has been given
to Keats and a few others of the sons of men
to attain by genius. These are they who could
comprehend the soul of antiquity by gazing


on an Attic urn or reading an English verse
translation of Homer. Is there not in this
mental reconstruction of antiquity a training
of the faculty of intellectual sympathy as well
as of the imagination, far beyond anything
that all the natural and physical sciences and
all the modern languages can do for us ? Those
who have read the Seventh Book of the Repub-
lic may remember how Plato insists on the men-
tally stimulating effect of having two antago-
nistic ideas presented simultaneously. This
we are constantly gaining from the study of
Greek and Latin literature. The essentially
different attitude of mind from our own with
which the Greek and Roman viewed nature
and life, death and moral evil, suffering and
forgiveness of injuries, supplies the student
incessantly with some of the most interesting
and stimulating problems possible, while,
moreover, he is all the time being brought
into contact with the most perfect literary and
artistic forms. What equivalent to this can
be found in the study of French and Ger-
man, in which all the thoughts are as our
thoughts and all their ways as our ways, and
there is little or nothing that provokes us by
its contrast with our own mental attitude?
Where find a stronger contrast than exists
between the doctrine of original sin, which
pervades all modern and Christian literature,
and such an utterance as Pindar?s at the open-


ing of the Sixth Neraean Ode;?? One race
there is of men and one of gods; but we both
draw our breath from the one mother?? And
to be brought into close intimacy with Pagan
thought at its best, to look at the problems of
life and death and the moral law with the eyes
of a Plato, an Epictetus, a Marcus Aurelius,
a Seneca, men of whom it has been justly said
that they rose to the same heights of religious
heroism as the Catholic Saints of the Middle
Ages, is there any mental exercise more calcu-
lated to foster intellectual sympathy, to widen
our outlook on life, to engender a large-hearted
tolerance, a fellow-feeling with humanity of
whatever race, of whatever epoch ? The
contrasts between ourselves and the Greeks
and Romans in art, politics, and literary
standards, are no less stimulating studies.
Equally important is the effect of classical
study in disciplining the character and de-
veloping the moral sense.* From the point of
view of moral training the classical student
has no need to lower his colours to the student
of natural science. Sincerity and love of
truth are, or ought to be, promoted by the
study of the forces of nature, but with that
%} *
their moral training ends. The classical
student, on the other hand, is being constantly
brought into touch with the highest moral
ideals. No peoples ever bestowed more atten-
tion than the Greeks and their imitators, the
* Adam, op. cit. pp. 232 ff.


Romans, upon the investigation of right and
wrong, and nowhere, outside the Bible, are
such heroic characters presented and analysed.
Sir Archibald Geikie, President of the Royal
Society, himself a great man of science,
frankly recognizes the inadequacy of science
for training the moral side of a man?s nature.
?A training in science,? he says, ?admirable
as it is in so many ways, fails to supply those
humanizing influences which the older learn-
ing can so well impart.? For the moral
stimulus that comes from association with all
that is noblest and best in the literature of
the past the teaching of natural and physical
science has no proper equivalent. For classical
?education aims not only at realizing ancient
life; it also seeks to enter into the loftiest
moral ideals of the past. By keeping company
with the best and highest spirits belonging to
those two great nations of antiquity, we go
near to assimilating their virtues. The true
programme of humanism has always pointed
men to the treasured ideals of the past, in
order to inspire them to action in the present.
From the Greeks we gain the thirst for know-
ledge, the insatiable spirit of inquiry, the
passion for truth, the love of beauty. From
?consorting with the noblest Romans, whether
in history or literature, with such as Cato and
?Caesar, Virgil and Cicero, Boethius and Anto-
ninus, we imbibe inspirations of courage and
patience, obedience, and fidelitv.


Considerations like these will probably ap-
peal to such an audience as I am addressing.
But will they satisfy that hard-headed, cold-
blooded, matter-of-fact individual known as
?the man in the street,? that mysterious being
who has of late been exalted into a kind of
Final Court of Appeal upon everything? We
must win him, if possible, for he seems to
be getting every day a stronger grip of our
educational institutions. He, perhaps, will
not be content to be told that his son will
acquire ?intellectual sympathy? and ?moral
inspiration? from the study of the classics*
He may say, ?That sounds grand, but I want
something practical. I want my son to suc-
ceed in life.? Without making unworthy
concessions, let us try how far we can meet
his demands. L.et us close with the enemy.
Can we show that a classical training is fitted
to make one more efficient and successful,
whatever calling or profession he may follow ?
Can we show in this sense the utility of the
classics in school education? This is a mod�
of defence which, it seems to me, has not been
employed as much as it might have been, and
I think it worth developing.
No doubt the educational value of a subject
varies with the time of life, and there is
subject that, in the hands of an inspiring
teacher, may not be made a fruitful means of
training. But all subjects are not equally


valuable for mental gymnastics. The subjects
chosen for the earlier training of the pupil
should aim at cultivating concentration,
stimulating the imagination, encouraging re-
sourcefulness, and imparting the power of
expression with tongue and pen. That is, in
short, training for life, regardless of any par-
ticular profession or calling. The mere acqui-
sition of knowledge should not be regarded
as the prime purpose of school education. In
the words of Thring, the greatest of latter-day
schoolmasters, ?the trained mind is worth all
the knowledge in the w T orld.? None of us, I
hope, however strong our faith in our favourite
studies, would be so narrow as to ask that
Latin and Greek should completely dominate
the school curriculum, as they did once. None
of us would consider that our children were
receiving a proper schooling, if the curriculum
ignored physics and nature study, which make
the material world intelligible and interesting,
or mathematics, the best of studies for
quickening the reason, or history, civics, and
elementary economics, which explain the facts
of social life, the duties of citizenship, and the
meaning of patriotism; or modern languages,
the knowledge of which corrects provin-
cialism, unlocks great literatures, and facili-
tates social intercourse with foreigners. Nor
should we neglect the study of the English
language and literature, admitting to the


enjoyment of literary masterpieces, some un-
surpassed, and helping to impart a higher skill
in handling the instrument by which above all
others we make our influence felt in the world.
Still, allowing all this, we contend that Latin
and Greek have unanswerable claims to be
regarded as educational instruments of excep-
tional value. We contend that there is such
a thing as intellectual discipline, and that some
studies form a better mental gymnastic than
others. Such has been the belief of all the
greatest educators in ancient and modern times.
Yet to-day some actually maintain that such
belief is a delusion and that all subjects are
equally good for training the mind. Indeed,
there are people at large nowadays (dangerous
people; they ought to be locked up) who
positively think they are doing a service to
mankind by preventing boys and girls from
learning Greek and by turning them all on
to technical or professional subjects at once.
It must surely be conceded for Latin, that
it has special advantages in training in
scientific method, in cultivating habits of
observation and comparison, and very notably
in creating habits of accuracy. There is no
study which demands more intense concen-
tration than the analysis of Latin sentences.
Schoolmasters in America strongly testify that
the discipline and spirit of a school are much
better where the majority of the pupils are


studying Latin. The concentration and close-
ness of observation involved seem to have a
special effect in creating habits of self-control
in the pupils. All this is still more true of
Greek, The strange alphabet and accents
make further demands upon the powers of
observation, and the Greek tense-system, with
its subtle distinctions of meaning, is as fine
an instrument for the cultivation of clear
thinking and accuracy of distinction as could
be found in any science. Do not take my
word for this. You may think me a bigoted
classicist. I shall appeal almost wholly to
experts in science, who cannot be called pre-
judiced. Professor Ramsay, of Glasgow,
himself a renowned classical scholar, reports
a conversation with Bauer, then holding a
Chair of Chemistry at Vienna, He questioned
Professor Bauer, he said, as to the relative
capacities of students from the classical Gym-
nasien and the modern Realschulen. ?I pre-
sume,? I said, ?that your best chemical students
come from the Realschulen.? ?Not at all,?
he said, ?all my best students come from the
Gymnasien. The students from the Real-
schulen do best at first, but after three months?
work they are left behind by those from the
Gymnasien.? ?How is that?? I asked; ?are
not the students in the Realschulen specially
instructed in chemistry?? ?Yes,? he replied,
?but those from the Gymnasien have the best


trained minds. Give me a student,? he said,
?who has been taught his Latin grammar and
I will answer for his chemistry.? That seems
to me a very striking testimony.
Further, can any study be named that is
likely to cultivate in a higher degree than
classics the power of expression in our own
language? Latin is absolutely necessary, to
teach us the original meaning of our own
words; for seven-tenths of the words we use
in what we call English are drawn from the
Latin, and most of the words pouring into our
language in the enlargement of our technical
vocabulary come directly from either Latin or
Greek. There can surely be no question that
the power of exact expression needs careful
cultivation among those preparing for any
profession. But let us consider each profession
separately.
There are few professions having so little
to do directly with humanity as Engineering,
the most practical of all callings: one which
concerns itself w T ith the hardest facts, facts
as hard as iron and reinforced concrete. But
many of the leaders in this profession begin
to feel that the utilitarian spirit has gone too
far, and that the engineering student, if
trained merely in the science of his profession,
may prove very inefficient in the economic
world. Professor Sadler, who holds a Chair
of Engineering in one of the greatest of
17 3


modern American Universities,* insists on the
supreme value of classical studies for giving
the necessary preliminary training both in
exactness of thought and in power of expres-
sion. ?The niceties of translation,? he says,
?the importance of gender, number, and case,
the proper use of the moods and tenses, force
the mind to a certain definiteness which is
lacking in so many of the subjects ordinarily
taught. Besides, a very large amount of writ-
ing has to be done by an engineer, especially
a consulting engineer, and a clear and concise
English style, such as is best acquired by a
preliminary training in the humanities, would
be an immense boon to him.? There is at
least one American University of the very first
rank that has lately adopted Greek as one of
the entrance subjects to the Engineering de-
gree. Of course, the object of all University
entrance examinations ought to be to discover
whether the student has a moderately well-
trained mind, and Professor Sadler maintains
that one who has spent his time studying the
humanities before entering the University will
be better qualified for the special University
work afterwards, than if he had acquired a
smattering of a number of technical subjects.
If I may quote another American professor, a
professor in the same University, this time a
* Most of the quotations of American authorities are derived from
F. W. Kelsey?s Latin and Greek in American Education , which contains
a most valuable body of testimony in favour of classical study.


Professor of Sanitary Engineering, if you
please, you may be impressed with his opinion:
for he cannot be accused of any professional
bias in favour of the classics. This Professor,
Gardner Williams by name, declares that
there is nothing in which engineers to-day
are so lacking as in the ability to express their
thoughts, even their thoughts on Sanitary En-
gineering. Sanitary Engineering itself, it
seems, gives little help that way. Take, he
says, any senior class of engineers, and you
will find that 95 per cent, of those who have
not had a classical training will be ignorant
of the difference between ?affect? and ?effect.?
Yet the difference is essential, and especially
to the engineer. Professor Williams urges
the study of the classics on every engineer.
?With a retrospect of 20 years,? he writes, ?I
feel warranted in saying that I could better
have spared any other course I took in school
rather than Latin!?
What of classics for the medical profession,
the favourite profession in Australia? Not so
very long ago a knowledge of Greek and Latin
up to First Year standard was deemed a
valuable preparation for medicine. It was so
when I first knew Melbourne University.
Times are changed. Very few of our medical
students now know the Greek alphabet. In-
deed, I am not sure that it is not in some circles
thought a positive hindrance to have studied
19 8a


Greek. At least, so I infer from a story told
lately by a friend. He said that an ardent
young disciple of the healing art had, with
sparkling eyes, informed him that he had
?started? his medical course. ?Indeed,? said
my friend, much interested; ?and how far
have you gone?? And the youth replied, ?Oh,
not very far, I?ve dropped Greek!?
But there is reason to think that this ?drop-
ping? of Greek by medical students is a grave
mistake. Such is, I know, the belief of many
leaders in the profession. I could quote
several in Melbourne. I shall give you just one,
Dr. Stawell, an old classical pupil of my own.
He wrote to me very recently these words:?
?I look upon the learning of Greek as a most
valuable and important part of the general
education of every medical student. I feel
confident that such learning is of lasting value,
not only as an introduction to the special
education of medicine, but also as a training
for the intelligent grasp of actual medical
problems and medical work.? Dr. Stawell
thinks, however, that this work should be done
at school, although he took up Greek himself
as a subject of his University course.
But I must take jmu now to Mr. O?Malley?s
country once again, for I have to win over,
if I can, that practical person with whom I
am confronted, who is supposed to live in the
street, and your practical man has as great a


reverence as Mr. O?Malley himself for
American opinion. Dr. Vaughan is Dean
of the Medical Faculty in the University
of Michigan, which, it is generally ad-
mitted, stands in the very front rank of
American Universities. Well, Dr. Vaughan
has lately been insisting on the extreme
importance of classics for medical students.
The habit, he says, that in classical
study one acquires of close observation, of at-
tention to detail, of looking for fine distinctions
and shades of difference, and the alertness of
mind thus gained, will be of inestimable ser-
vice to the medical student both in the
laboratory and at the bedside. He goes on to
speak of the direct value of Greek and Latin
(?direct value? ?that is something for our
friend in the street), the direct value to the
medical student in helping him to grasp at
once the exact meaning of medical terms. At
least two years, he says, of work in Greek
ought to be demanded as a condition of en-
trance to any medical school. The Professor
of Surgery in the same University, a very dis-
tinguished man, Dr. de Kancrede, speaks yet
more strongly of the injury to medicine that
the abandonment of classical teaching for
medical students has brought about. Lack of
knowledge of the classical languages, he says,
proves a serious hindrance to the teaching of
medicine. Many medical men go through their


curriculum and through their professional life
not understanding the meaning of the technical
words they employ. Sir William Osier, rich
in both English and American experience,
whom no one out of Bedlam would call an
educational reactionary, in a recent article in
The Oxford Magazine , declared himself
strongly in favour of the retention of Greek
for degrees in Medicine. Osier?s own writings
teem with allusions to Greek and Latin litera-
ture. What would that brilliant book of his,
?Aequanimitas,? be, without its illustrations
from Plato, Lucian, and other Greeks?
Now let us go to Law ?for a brief space.
There is a general agreement that what is
most needed in legal education is the training
of the judgment; but that, scarcely inferior in
importance, is the faculty of expression. For
both purposes the study of the classics is
especially effective. Again I cross the At-
lantic, in quest of the most ?up-to-date?
ideas about legal training. One of the
leaders of the Chicago bar, Mr. M.
Starr, has lately published his opinion
that, compared with modern languages, mathe-
matics, natural science, applied science, history
and philosophy, the study of the classics sup-
plies a law student with far better training of
the faculties, both of judgment and expression.
The truth is, we cannot learn Latin and Greek
without learning English also, and he who is


a Latin grammarian is an English grammarian
without further study. That brilliant scholar,
Professor Mahatfy, whose racy English style
is familiar to many of you, once told me that
he never learnt English grammar, even as a
child, only Latin. Again, for a lawyer, ac-
curacy of interpretation is one of the highest
essentials, and a distinguished American ad-
vocate writes, that for training in the con-
struing of law nothing can surpass Latin and
Greek. It would be absurd to maintain that,
as a preparation for this sort of work, either
natural science or mathematics would have a
practical value in training, at all comparable
to that of Latin or Greek. Another leader at
the American bar, Mr. Lynden Evans, asserts
that, with very few exceptions, the lawyers in
the United States who have distinguished
themselves most in their profession, and have
been of the greatest use to the world, have,
to use his own expression, ?come through Latin
or Greek.? As the lawyer?s work so largely
consists in the preparation and interpretation
of legal documents, the greater his skill in the
use of language and in discovering fine shades
of meaning, the greater his effectiveness. Im-
perfect logic or ambiguity in a passage of
English often escapes notice, but is infallibly
betrayed by translating it into Latin, which
will not, so readily as English, tolerate illo-
gical arrangement or haziness of meaning.


From the Law to the Prophets.
To speak of the importance of Greek and
Latin as a practical preparation for the clerical
profession might seem superfluous, but that
we know that in many cases the Churches
have lowered their standard and admit to the
ministry in considerable numbers men who do
not know enough Latin to translate the Atha-
nasian Creed, or enough Greek to understand
common theological terms like Hypostasis, or
Theotokos or Kenosis. Yet one would sup-
pose it to be as difficult for a man to be a
theologian without classics as to be a doctor
without anatomy. Indeed, the latter-day re-
search of scholars is making Greek not of less
but of more importance in the study of
theology. Recent discoveries of inscriptions
and papyri reveal the fact that the Greek
of the New Testament is neither modi-
fied Attic Greek nor yet a special language
peculiar to the Deity, as was believed not very
long ago, but is simply the popular Greek of
the period, and that in truth there is no such
language and never was as the thing that some
ignorant people still call ??Biblical Greek.?
The discovery is strongly affecting New Testa-
ment studies.
As to Latin ?for Roman and Protes-
tant theologians alike a knowledge of it
is simply indispensable. In the case
of Roman Catholics, I suppose this is


an accepted truth; but it is equally certain
that a large part of the theology of the Re-
formation period is inaccessible to those
ignorant of Latin. More than that, there is
scarcely a scholarly English commentary on
the New Testament which does not demand a
knowledge of classics. The great German
theological works would be very poorly under-
stood by any one unable to translate the Greek
and Latin quotations which abound in them.
There seems to be good reason why Bishops
of the Church of England should enforce the
rubric which excludes from the Anglican
priesthood any one ignorant of Latin. The
intellectual demands made upon the clergy are
greater now than ever, and the increasing
culture of the laity requires a corresponding
rise in the educational status of their religious
teachers. Intelligent laymen, even if them-
selves ignorant of the classics, can recognise
the absurdity of a man attempting to deal in
any thorough way with a book of whose
language he is ignorant. Once I heard an
eloquent clergyman addressing a highly culti-
vated congregation, and dwelling on the beauty
and power of ??the writings of Socrates.?
I fear that his appeals to the reason and
conscience of his hearers fell rather flat on
the ears of those of them avlio knew that
such writings existed only in the preacher?s
imagination. I remember also a really gifted


evangelist, who visited Melbourne some years
since, losing at least some of his influence with
a University audience by quoting familiarly
from Ovid, and then adding, ?Ovid, you know,
lived between 200 and 300 years before
Christ.? And I once heard yet another noted
preacher addressing an educated Melbourne
audience on the blunders of the assailants of
Christianity and informing his hearers, who
were hanging on his lips, that Pliny had
written an account of the persecution of the
Christians in the reign of Tiberius! Poor man.
He had got him mixed up with Trajan.
A factor that will help in improving the
position of classical studies is the admission of
women to our Universities. The commercial
spirit in education is less active among Uni-
versity women than among the men. So I
believe that women will, in the near future,
do much to save Greek. A contributing cause
will be the growing interest of women in
theological studies. I was startled, almost
terrified, the other day to learn that there are
nearly 500 women-students now enrolled in the
Theological Colleges of America. Ido not
know whether some of you will be shocked,
if I say that this seems to show plainly that
it is but a question of time when women will
be admitted to the ranks of the clergy. How
the imagination reels at the thought of a
female Archbishop of Melbourne! But lam


digressing. The women-theologians interest
me at the present moment only as probable
students of Latin and Greek.
I have dealt now with each of what are
called the learned professions; but, apart from
professional training, think to how many do-
mains of knowledge the study of Latin and
Greek opens the way. A knowledge of classics
remains the essential passport to all research
in those important studies called humanistic.
There are some funny notions afloat about
classical scholars. One is that they have no-
sympathy with science, as if there was some
kind of natural antagonism between literary
and scientific tastes. Fantastic and absurd!
The methods of classical scholarship to-day are
essentially scientific. Classical Philology,
using the word in its widest sense, is a true
evolutionary science, and is adding something
every day to the sum of human knowledge. It
holds out a friendly hand to all the sciences.
I assure you solemnly there is no such creature
in the world to-day as the unscientific classical
scholar. He is only a fabulous monstei. Do
not be frightened of him. He is nowhere to
be found on earth now, not even in a museum,
any more than the British Unicorn or the
Australian Bunyip. All the different streams
of knowledge are tending to coalesce more and
more, and as has been fully recognised by the
giants of the scientific world, such as Lord


Kelvin, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Archibald
Oeikie, and others already named, the pro-
gress of classical scholarship is serving the
cause of all the sciences. For example, no
one can be a thorough anthropologist who is
not at least something of a classical scholar.
The best living British anthropologist, Fraser
of Cambridge, has published the best extant
edition of the Greek author, Pausanias. For
the study of comparative religion Latin and
Greek are indispensable. The student of his-
tory would be sadly to seek, if Thucydides,
Herodotus, and Polybius were to him sealed
books. TV ithout Latin and Greek the student
of comparative philology, at least Indo-Euro-
pean philology, would be all at sea.
For the serious student of English, Latin
and Greek are practically essential. That
majestic work, the Oxford English Dictionary,
now nearing completion, a work which has
done for English what has not been done for
any other language in the world, not even
German, is mainly the achievement of
classical scholars. The classical languages and
literatures are woven into the very tissue of
our national expression. Many of our greatest
writers were saturated with the classics, and
we must have at least some of their lore to
appreciate them aright. May we not say,
?Little he knows of English who only English
knows?? A very large part of Milton, Tenny-


son, Shelley, Browning, Swinburne, Matthew
Arnold, and Meredith would be lost on a
reader not versed in the classics. Tennyson
had Theocritus almost by heart, and echoes
of the Sicilian poet recur all through his
works. Gray w T as a finished scholar, and
wrote a commentary on that seldom-read
author, Strabo. Ben Jonson took his lovely
lyric, ?Drink to me only with thine eyes, ,T
literally from that out-of-the-way Greek
writer, Philostratus. What can be more Greek
in form than Spenser?s Prothalamion ? From
Marlowe to Morris, English poetry is steeped
in Greek influences. To come nearer home,
Adam Lindsay Gordon?s latest biographer tells
us that he knew? by heart ?prodigious quan-
tities of Horace, Virgil, Homer, and Ovid.?
The question of style cannot be properly
studied apart from the classics. It was by the
Greek and Latin writers that literary style
was carried to its highest perfection. The
felicity of form and finish that marked Roman
poetry made it the chief instrument in mould-
ing the literature of modern Europe. A
Greek essay, ?On the Sublime,? still remains
one of the very best manuals ever written on
the principles of style, and anticipates in a
remarkable way Matthew Arnold?s conclusion
that ?the test of great literature is the high
seriousness which comes from absolute sin-
cerity.? Of course, you have all noticed that


the name of practically every existing type
of literature, except satire, comes to us
straight from the Greek, whether it be tragedy
or comedy, lyric, epic, or didactic, ode, idyll,
elegy, or epigram. That is because the Greeks
created almost every form of literature, and
it is to their masterpieces and those of their
literary children, the Romans, that one must
resort who would see the greatest triumphs in
the artistic construction of words, as in a
Latin inscription or a Greek epigram, in a
dialogue of Plato or an ode of Sappho or
Simonides. Form, in which the Greek and
Roman writers so eminently excelled, must
not be lightly esteemed. It can malm writing
immortal. It is the antiseptic of literature.
Style can give richness and splendour even to
the obvious. It is safe to say that many lines
of Tennyson will live for ever, simply by
virtue of their perfect phrasing and melody,
and Tennyson was one of the most classically-
minded of English poets. His ?Ulysses? is
perhaps the noblest embodiment of the Hel-
lenic spirit to be found in modern literature.
Those lines of his could never have come from
a writer who was not saturated with Greek
poetry. In short, the Greeks possessed the
artistic sense, not only in sculpture and archi-
tecture, but also in language, the gift of crea-
tive and illuminating phrase, above every
nation that has ever been, or perhaps ever will


be, on earth, and this is one of the reasons that
Greece keeps the interest of mankind, and will
keep it while the world endures.
Turn from literature to economics. To the
student of social phenomena of the present day
how important is a first-hand knowledge of
the civilisations from which our own has
sprung! Turn to philosophy. Is it too much
to say that the germ of every great thought in
philosophy comes from Greece? That dis-
tinguished Australian, Gilbert Murray, in his
very latest book asserts that even in the 6th
Century before Christ the religion of Greece
had come very near indeed to monotheism. The
philosophies of England and Germany at the
present time are but the natural development
of Greek thought, and are hardly intelligible
without a reference to the Academy and the
Porch.
But I desire to be ?practical,? and I seem to
hear a voice from the Street:?? Philosophy is
not practical.? No more it is. There is no
money in it nor near it. I apologize; and turn
abruptly to the question:?What about a clas-
sical training as a preparation for the life of
action ? One of the delusions fostered by fifth-
rate scientists about classical scholars is that
they are all dreamers, unpractical, unfit for
the business of the work-a-day world. Do
people who talk in this way realize that
modern Germany is virtually the achievement


of classical scholars?* The schools of Prussia
were created by the same men who created the
army, and till the end of the 19th Century
classics completely dominated the Prussian
school curriculum. In the Indian Civil Ser-
vice, perhaps the noblest public service in the
world next to the British Navy and the Ger-
man Army, classical men greatly predominate.
It was an Oxford classical scholar who
founded, and still directs, the Workers? Edu-
cational Association, in which Dr. Barrett is
so keenly interested, and of which we are to
hear so much in a few weeks hence, when Mr,
Mansbridge arrives. It was from the
?dreamers of Oxford,? reared on classics and
idealism, that first proceeded the thought of
organised social service by Universities. The
first University Settlement was founded by
Oxford classicists. The idea has indeed been
caught up with zeal by Universities in America
and elsewhere; but it was from classical Ox-
ford that the first inspiration came. Mr.
Bryce, whom some of us heard with such
pleasure during his visit last year, is not an
unpractical dreamer. Hear some Avords that
he lately addressed to an American Univer-
sity:?? The longer I watch the currents now
affecting higher education, the more I lament
the diminished attention to-day given to clas-

of Classics in German Secondary Schools (1910).


sical studies. People seem to think that a
language no longer used in daily speech is a
dead language and has no value for the modern
world. But (he truth is that no language
which enshrines a great literature, through
which the thought of the past speaks to the
thinkers of the present, can ever die. A mas-
tery of the literature and history of the ancient
world makes every one fitter to excel than he
would have been without it; for it widens the
mental horizon, it sets standards unlike our
own, it sharpens the edge of critical discrimi-
nation, it suggests new lines of constructive
thought. It is useful to all. The man of affairs
gains like all others from whatever makes him
comprehend better the Avorld of men around
him, and discern better the changes that are
passing in it. It is a mistake to live so en-
tirely in the present as we are apt to do in
these days, for the power of broad thinking
suffers.? That is an impressive statement
from such a man; but it is supported by a
great volume of opinion from leading business
men, the very kings of their profession. You
have heard of Mr. Loeb. He is a merchant
prince of New York, a man of great wealth,
some of which he is spending in producing
a remarkable series of the classics (the texts
of which have been edited by the best critical
scholars of the day), with English translations
added. This is his opinion about Greek and


Latin in business. ?That a classical course,?
he writes, ?is a valuable training for business
life has always seemed to me self-evident. The
foolish attempt to keep abreast of the so-
called literature of the day, of its morbid
novels, and its prying, indelicate memoirs,
would be impossible, were the taste of our
youths and maidens formed by a study of
Greek and Latin literature. The applause
bestowed on the decadent drama, the vulgar
comedy, the immoral play, would soon turn to
hisses were the audience better acquainted
with the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles.?
Another prominent leader in the commercial
world of America, the head of the great firm
of W. and J. Sloane, of New York, testifies
as strongly. ?A classical education,? he says,
?is a large asset for any business man. His
equipment for his life work is that much
better, and will prove to be so in increasing
measure as he rises to positions of responsi-
bility and influence. A wider horizon means
greater ability to see through complex ques-
tions, to understand motives, to measure men.
I believe that the slow process of the transla-
tion of the classics, which, in my opinion,
should be compulsory for an Arts degree,
makes a good training for the boy who has
chosen a business career.? This trans-Atlantic
testimony is supported by what we hear from
England, that many of the great business


firms have grown recently much more alive to
the general efficiency, savoir faire , and know-
ledge of human nature, which a classical train-
ing promotes. This is shown by the growing
tendency to seek University men for the
principal positions in the conduct of com-
mercial affairs. A relative of mine, who lately
obtained an appointment in one of the largest
Manchester firms, doing an enormous business
with the East, found to his surprise, at his
interview with the principals of the firm, that
the last thing desired was a preliminary busi-
ness training. Satisfaction was actually ex-
pressed on learning that he knew no
bookkeeping, but was a good Greek scholar.
?Classics, yes; that is the kind of training we
like,? they said, and gave him the appointment.
It may surprise some business-men who rail
at Oxford and' Cambridge to hear that it is
a rule of this firm to appoint none but honour-
men from Oxford and Cambridge, and their
men must have obtained nothing lower than
second-class honours.
If we turn to public life, we find a great
body of testimony from statesmen and diplo-
mats in all civilised countries as to the benefit
of a classical training. Public speaking is one
of the first essentials of success in statecraft.
Xo doubt the greatest orators, like poets, are
born?not made; but there seems to be general
agreement among those who know political life


that the men of classical training are usually,
of course not always, the best public speakers.
That quality, which Gilbert Murray ascribed
to Professor Butcher as a speaker, ?a kind of
inevitable rightness,? is the quality which in
a general way should, and does, characterize
classical scholars. It is impossible to overstate
the importance of language in public life. Take
the case of our Referenda, where each side
has been allowed 2000 words in which to state
its case. How all-important that those who had
this task to do should be able to make the best
possible use of language; to employ the tersest,
most lucid and most pointed diction, to convey
their views. If you had to choose your writer,
do you not think you would go to one brought
up on Greek rather than on natural science?
It was a classical scholar (Canning) who,
composing an epitaph on Pitt, closed with the
great words, ?He died poor,? words worthy
of Tacitus at his best. It was a commercial
magnate, who probably had not so much as
heard whether there be any Tacitus, who
thought the expression wanting in dignity and
wished to substitute, ?He expired in indigent
circumstances.?
If I mention Mr. O?Malley again, you will
think he is a kind of obsession with me to-
night; but I must refer to him once more, for
I have a crow to pluck with him.


A few weeks ago, in a newspaper interview,
he delivered this oracle:??No man who has
been a master of the classics has ever played an
important part in the world?s history.? You
know that Mr. O?Malley sometimes says won-
derful things; but of all the O?Malleyisms with
which the world has been enriched, this is, in
Celia?s phrase, ?the most wonderful, wonderful,
and yet again wonderful.? No one here can
be so ignorant as not to know to how great
an extent English statesmen have been brought
up on the classics. Such names as Chatham
and Pitt, Canning and Macaulay, Derby and
Gladstone, Disraeli and Salisbury, Balfour and
Asquith, occur at once to everyone (except Mr.
O'Malley) as those of great public men nur-
tured on classical scholarship. The famous
statesmen of the 18th Century held that there
was no such - preparation for political life as
a classical training. They could quote the
classical poets more freely than we can the
English. And in our Australian politics many
cases of the success in public life of classical
scholars could be cited, such as Wentworth
and Robert Lowe, Childers and Higinbotham,
Wrixon and Irvine, and others whose presence
here to-night forbids me to name them.
I do not suggest that public speaking is the
whole duty of the statesman, or that this is
all that classics do for his training. Our late
Governor, Lord Sydenham, not a great speaker,


but one of the most practical of men, who has
left behind him in India a splendid record of
firm government and of service to educa-
tion, told me once that he thought nothing
equalled the classics as a general preliminary
training for public life. The great number of
classically trained men who have risen to
eminence in statecraft seems to suggest that,
apart even from facility of expression, classical
study has some special virtue of imparting
reasoning power and judgment in human
affairs.
We shall make a dangerous experiment in
education if we suffer Greek to be killed in
our schools. If she dies, I predict that she
will soon be followed to her grave by her Latin
sister. For what the armies of Philistia clamour
for now is practically the total abolition
of classical studies. But no country can
afford to neglect the gospel of truth and beauty
in life and art and literature that Greece has
given to mankind. Can we in Melbourne dare
to discard any study that sets artistic standards
and refines the taste? If we had had in mind
the Greek canons of beauty, we could never
have disgraced our city with such horrors as
the Eight Hours Monument, the Boer War
Memorial, our street fountains, and certain
statues which shall be nameless. There they
stand in their grim ugliness, debasing the
public taste as long as they endure. What


do you suppose an Athenian artisan of the age
of Pericles would have thought of them or of
our flag, or our postcard, or our kangaroo
stamp? As to this last, lam myself conscious
of a feeling of personal humiliation every time
I affix one. What would Pericles have felt
about it ? I think it would have killed him.
Nor yet can any nation afford to turn its
back upon the great past and ignore the teach-
ings of Greek and Roman history. The
Federal Attorney-General objected angrily the
other day to being referred back to Diocletian,
for what was Diocletian to him? What did
Diocletian know of the Labour Caucus? Yet
Greek and Roman history teem with lessons
precious and opportune for our times and for
this country ?the dangers of unbridled mob
rule, the futility of fixing prices by law, the
wrong that the refined and educated classes
commit, if they retire in disgust from public
life and abandon politics to the ignorant and
unworthy, the demoralising tendency of doles
and bonuses, the results of creating a vast army
of government servants, the folly of sacrificing
the rural population to the city proletariat,
and many other salutary warnings.
I cannot at the fag-end of a lecture, already
too long, anticipate and answer the many objec-
tions that any advocacy of the classics pro-
vokes nowadays. Nor can I consider in detail
the alternatives the enemy would offer. I am


tempted, however, to touch for a moment on
the question of modern languages, for this is
our opponents? trump-card. The assailants of
classical education would substitute for Latin
and Greek in our secondary schools a collo-
quial knowledge of modern languages. It is
strange that any intelligent teacher could be
found to maintain that this substitute would
have anything like the same educational value.
If such a view were sound, then, as it has been
said, the polyglot waiters in the Continental
hotels might be regarded as among the most
cultured of mankind. As a matter of fact,
there is very little educational training in ac-
quiring a language simply by ear. This was
clearly perceived by Helmholtz, one of the
greatest scientists of his age. He rightly
insisted that modern languages learned by
practice and imitation could not develop logical
thought, like the classical languages, with their
full system of inflections and their elaborate
methods of showing the grammatical relation
of the individual parts of a sentence to each
other and to the whole. It has been estimated
that there are five times as many mental pro-
cesses involved in translating Latin and Greek
into English as there are in translating a
modern language.
I have spoken mainly of the classics as sub-
jects of education, but the scope of our Associa-
tion is not purely scholastic. Our first


objective must be to preserve classics in our
school and University curricula; but our aims
are of the broadest. We seek, as our prospectus
says, to keep alive classical interests in general,
to emphasize the relationship of ancient with
modern life and thought, and to show in every
possible way that Greek and Latin are not
dead. We are not merely a company of edu-
cationists, much less are we a coterie of pe-
dants and dryasdusts, who mean to spend our
time grinding at grammar or ?settling hoti?s
business.? Neither are we blind idolaters of
the classics. We wish to deal with them on
familiar terms and to show how thoroughly
modern they are, because so thoroughly human.
We do not regard a Greek joke as too sacred
a thing to laugh at. We sympathize with
Mommsen, who, referring to his great History
of Rome, so rich in modern illustration, wrote:
??I wanted to bring down the ancients from
the fantastic pedestal on which some have
placed them, into the modern world.? So
we welcome to our ranks all who are in general
sympathy with classical studies, even though
they are not Latin or Greek scholars.
I should have liked also, had time permitted,
to discuss some of the proposed reforms in
classical teaching, especially those connected in
Germany with the name of Dr. Reinhardt, and
in England with that of Dr. Rouse; but I have
already tried your patience severely. I must


not sin further against the ?Sophrosyne,? the
moderation, which is one of the best elements
of the Greek spirit. My task was to justify
our meeting to-night. I do not know whether
I have succeeded. The future must decide
whether we have been wise in founding a
Classical Association in Victoria. May it fulfil
its mission worthily.
