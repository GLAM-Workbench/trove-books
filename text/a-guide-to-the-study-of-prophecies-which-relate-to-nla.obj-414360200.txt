INTRODUCTION.
12-to-
The references arranged in this tract were, in the first
place, drawn up for my own private use, without any idea
of publication.
But having found that the arrangement was of great ser-
vice to myself, and having been repeatedly requested by
different friends to give them a few hints as to the best
method of commencing the study of the Prophecies which
refer to these times, it has occurred to me that others may
derive some advantage from the assistance which this tract
has afforded to myself.
I have endeavoured to arrange the several passages ac-
cording to the views which I have myself adopted from the
study and comparison of the whole, and have subjoined a
a few observations, compiled from various sources. Let the
reader study and judge for himself, submitting his judgment,
not to my opinions, or to those of any mere human interpreter,
but to what he himself will find in a patient prayerful study
of the Bible, —“ comparing spiritual things with spiritual.”
The events to which unfulfilled prophecy refer, are cer-
tainly among “ the deep things of God.” They are intimately
connected both with those “ secret things,” which belong to
God alone, and with those which have been revealed, which
“ belong to us and to our children, for ever,” That these
prophecies are somewhat obscure none will deny. But that
it is our duty to study them, notwithstanding their obscurity,
is evident, I conceive, from the injunction of our Lord, “Search
the scriptures,” and from the assurance of his apostle, that “all
scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in
righteousness.” While St. Peter has declared that we shall


do well (for the confirmation of our faith in Christ,) “ to take
heed to the more sure word of prophecy, as to a light that
shineth in a dark place ” —the only light which can illumine
the darkness of futurity.
There are four things, it may be said, which are essential
to a profitable study of unfulfilled prophecy. These are, —
An experimental knowledge of man’s fallen and depraved
condition through sin. A simple and entire dependance
upon Christ, and desire for his glory. The rejection of all
prejudices and pre-conceived opinions, with an earnest desire
to know simply what saith the Lord. A continual habit of
prayer for the enlightening power of the Holy Ghost, the
divine author of prophecy.—ln short, the student must pos-
sess conviction of sin—faith in Christ —submission to His
word —and prayer for the teaching of his Spirit , and then
his studies will be truly profitable.
I trust that the selection of texts which is now published,
(which is a selection only,) may assist the enquirer, and ex-
cite him to the patient and persevering study of the word of
God. Let him take a Bible with marginal references, and
study the passages which I have arranged, adding whatever
others he can find under each particular head. Let him
carefully seek for the plain and simple meaning of each
passage. There are some passages which are figurative,
but they are few, and generally are expressly declared to be
such ; as, for instance, Isaiah, v. 1—6., which verse 7 ex-
plains. Figurative expressions are more common, but then
they are easily known; and no expression should be ex-
plained as a figure, unless a figure is very plainly intended.
As a rule, when language will admit a consistent literal inter-
pretation, that interpretation is, generally speaking, a correct
one.
I may refer to Isaiah, xxiv. 23 , as an instance. Although
the whole verse has been considered figurative, the only
figures really contained in it, are that “ the moon will be con-
founded, and the sun ashamed —because shame and con-


fusion are ideas not naturally connected with the heavenly
bodies. Yet, the idea conveyed by these figures is literal
enough, viz.—that the light of the sun and the moon will be
eclipsed by the more glorious light, (“ above the brightness of
the sun.”—Acts, xxvi. 13.) occasioned by the actual ( not
spiritual ) presence of the Lord of Hosts. Compare Lev.
xxi. 21, 23.
With regard to the marginal readings, it is well known
that they are of equal authority with the translation con-
tained in the text, and very often they are even more correct.
They should be carefully studied and compared with parallel
passages. A knowledge of the original languages of scrip-
ture is often of essential service in these investigations ; yet
where this cannot be had the marginal references will afford
to the student much assistance. As an instance, I may refer
to Micah, vii. B—l 3. The connection of the 13th verse with
the rest (which is otherwise obscure) is at once evident, when
the word notwithstanding is changed into the marginal read-
ing. The application of the whole passage to the restoration
of Israel after their dispersion and the desolation of their
land is then easily recognized.
A word more upon the practical advantages which may
be derived from this subject.
At a time like the present, when “ men’s hearts are failing
them for fear and for looking after those things which are
coming upon the earth,” it is the prophetical student’s high
privilege plainly to perceive a Father’s hand guiding and
overruling all things. It affords him the greatest encourage-
ment to discover that all things are but happening according
to God’s will, and working together to promote His gracious
purposes concerning his chosen people.
Moreover, the prophecies abound with invitations and
exhortations to us to study their contents. See Hos. xiv. 9.,
Lev. i. 3, and the great subject to which they refer—the
manifestation of Christ’s glory at his advent is spoken of
again and again for the warning, instruction, and encourage-


ment of believers, in almost every book of the New Testa-
ment, (See Section VIII.)
And lastly, with regard to our present position, I cannot
but notice that this study, under the Divine blessing, may be
instrumental in guarding us against those “ deceivers,” which
are to be the signs of the “ latter days,” Matt, xxiv, 24. While
Mormonism and Socialism are destroying their tens of thou-
sands ; Avhile Romanism, weak as it is at its centre, is active
and energetic amongst us, “beguiling unstable souls ;” and
while Unitarians* and other like opponents of the Redeemer’s
glory are seeking to spread their pernicious and unscriptural
doctrines on every side; while “ iniquity abounds and the love
of many waxes cold;” while drunkenness and an all-absorbing
love of filthy lucre are sapping the very foundations of reli-
gion and morality, and calling down God’s just anger upon
the nation ; while all this is the case, it will be refreshing and
instructive to turn away from such causes of disquietude, to
gaze with the eye of faith upon that glorious Advent. It will
* I trust that I shall be pardoned for taking this opportunity of noticing
a recent publication in Sydney, by a clergyman of the Unitarian persuasion.
I refer to a Sermon by the Rev. G. H. Stanley, preached at the Unitarian
Chapel, Sydney, Nov. 6th, 1853, The author argues inter alia , that because
God is called “ the Father,” 1 Cor, viii. 6., and Christ is called “ Lord,”
therefore Christ is not God, And yet. every biblical student well knows
that the term Father is applied to Christ himself, as in Isaiah, ix. 6, “ the
Mighty God, the everlasting Father ;” while St. Paul declares that Christ
is “overall, God, blessed for ever,” Rom. ix. 5, and St. John, “The
word was God,” John i. 1, and, “ This is the true God,” 1 John, v. 20.
It is, however, painful to notice that throughout this Sermon the Bible is
referred to, not as declaring the will of God with authority, but merely as
affording an occasional support to doctrines which have been borrowed from
other sources. Thus the whole of those passages in the epistle to the
Hebrews and elsewhere, which speak of Christ’s death as a sacrifice, are
passed over as “sacrificial expressions by which the death of Christ is
occasionally illustrated.” Thus also Atonement (by the aid of a witicism)
is made synonymous with Reconciliation. While, Gal. hi. 10—14 seems to
be alluded to apparently for the simple purpose of contradicting die com-
forting declaration that “ Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the
law, being made a curse for us,”


help to preserve the mind from being entangled by vain specu-
lations, and by the miserable cares and doubts and anxieties
and pleasures of a foolish and wicked world. And amid the
wars and rumours of wars, which reach us from every quar-
ter, amid the changing of governments, and the falling of
empires, it will indeed be cheering to look forward in faith
and hope to that “ kingdom which cannot be moved; ” and
to contemplate that which shortly will be seen by all, viz:
“ the Lord of Hosts reigning in Mount Zion, and in Jerusa-
lem, and before his ancients gloriously.”
May the Lord condescend to bless this my labour, that it
may promote the patient and study of His holy word,
and so contribute to the comfort and edification of His people,
for Jesus Christ’s sake, “ to whom be glory for ever. Amen.”


AN ARRANGEMENT
OF THE PROPHECIES WHICH REFER TO THE LATTER DAYS.
SECTION I.
The signs of the approaching termination of this Dispen-
sation :
(1.) The number of travellers, and the increased facilities
for quick communication between different countries.—
Dan. xii. 4; Isaiah, xl. 3 — 4; xlix. 11 ; Nahum, ii. 2 — 4;
Matt* xxiv. 27.
(2.) The increase of knowledge.—Dan. xii. 4.
(3-) The outpouring of the vials, Rev. xvi., as compared
with the history of Europe since the first French Revolution.
(4.) The preaching of the Gospel for a witness to all na-
tions.—Matt. xxiv. 14; Rom. x. 18; Col. i. 6— 23.
(5.) The termination of Prophetic periods—Dan. xii. 11,
12; Rev. xi. 2, 3 ; xii. 6—14 ; xiii. 5.
Observations. —The word, alwv, which is translated world ,
as in Matt. xiii. 39, and in many other places, more properly
means a “ dispensation .” Thus it is generally admitted that
in the place already quoted the reference is to the termination
of the Christian dispensation, as distinguished from the
Mosaic, the Patriarchal, and others which preceded, and not
to the end of the material world. The generally received
idea of the annihilation of the world at the day of judgment
is, I believe, quite opposed to many plain passages of Holy
Scripture. See particularly, Rev. v. 10. See also the whole
history of the Millennial kingdom. 2 Peter, iii. 10, and its
parallel passages may be compared with the 6th verse of the


same chapter. The earth “perished,” yet was not annihilated
by water. It may “ perish ” again by fire, and not be anni-
hilated, but only purified and fertilized by the process.
The “ signs ” above referred to are but a few out of many.
In No. 1, let the student notice the simplicity of the pro-
phetic descriptions. I cannot but consider Isaiah, xl. 8,4, to
be as perfect and comprehensive a description of a modern
railway, as two short verses could possibly be made to contain.
It is remarkable, also, that the expression in Daniel should
imply speed, and that in Nahum, speed by means of fire.
With regard to No. 4,1 will but remark that it is for a
witness to the nations, and not for their conversion that the
gospel is to be preached to them. (Compare Isaiah, xxiv. 13.)
The promise afforded by late events, of the opening of China
and Japan to the gospel, is truly wonderful. Thus, Christian
missionaries, by preaching Christ’s gospel for a witness to the
nations, as well as by gathering together his elect from among
the heathen, (compare John, x. 16. and xi. 52) are materially
preparing the way of the Lord.
I may add that the 6000th year since the creation of Adam
will probably terminate in 1864 or 1865. (See Clinton’s
Fasti Hellenici.) May not the Sabbatical millennary coin-
cide with the seventh ? (See Appendix A.)


SECTION 11.
The days of Tribulation immediately preceding the
Advent. —Dan. xii. 1.
There will be tribulations arising from :
(1.) False religions and systems off religion—
fa) False Christs. —Dent. xiii. 1; Matt. xxiv. 23, 24,
(b) Deceivers. —2 Peter, ii. 1 ; Rev. xiii. 13, 14, &c.
(c) Antichrists. — 1 John, ii. 18; iv. I—3; 2 John, vii.
(d) The Roman Apostacy.—2 Thess.ii. 3— 12; 1 Tim.
iv. I—3 ; Rev. xiii.; and xvii.
(2.) Increasing irreligion—
(e) Formalism. —2 Tim. hi. 5 ; Titus, i. 16.
(f) Faithlessness. —Luke, xviii. 8.
(g) Scoffing. —2 Peter iii. 3, 4.
(h) General Ungodliness. —2 Tim. iii. I—4 ; 2 Peter,
iii. 3 ; Jude, iv. 18.
(k) See also, Luke xvii. 26—30; also Matt. xii. 45 ;
xiii. 30; Luke, xix. 14.
(3.) Political commotions—
(m) Wars, fyc. —Dan. xii. 1; Matt. xxiv. 6,7, 29 ;
Luke, xxi. 10, 11, 25, 26.
, , , . /naAomTti e;cla-ri
(n) Ihe destruction offTurhey. —Rev. ix. 1—21; xvi. 12.
(o) The Russian Plague. —Dan. ix. 26, 27; xi. 36
45; Ezek. xxxviii. ; Rev. xvi. 21.
(p) The Tripartition of Papal Europe, and its subse-
quent erection into a single Empire. Compare
Rev. xvi. 19, and Dan. ii. 44, 45.
Observations. —With regard to the political disturbances
which Avill immediately precede the advent, and with which
the present aspect of affairs would appear to be connected, a
few observations may not be out of place. For many years,
i. e., since 1820, the Euphrates, the emblem of the Turkish, or
Ottoman empire, has been drying up, literally as well as figura-


lively, and tlie power, which once belonged to the successors of
Mahomet, has been gradually fading. These are matters of
history, (See Appendix B.)
Again, both Daniel and St. John speak of a great Northern
power as the instrument of many calamities, and Ezekiel
speaks of him as Gog, “ the chief prince of Meshech and
Tubal.” The translation of the margin (Ezek. xxxviii. 2, &c.)
is “ the Prince of the Chief,” while an examination of the
original Hebrew points out the remarkable translation, “ the
Prince of Bos, Meshech, and Tubal,” And as this
Prince is to come out “of the North parts,” (verse 15,) it
seems not improbable that the Czar, (as Prince of Russia,
Muscovy, and Tobolsk,) is the person intended.*
Again, the outpouring of the seventh vial will be ac-
companied by the tripartition of Europe,—or Papal Europe,
the ten kingdoms which have given their power to the beast.
Yet Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, seems
to require the re-construction of the whole image, or the sub-
jugation of the whole of Europe and a part of Asia under a
single head, in order that it may be destroyed by/ the stone
which was “ cut out without hands. v
This re-construction of the whole image will probably be
subsequent to its tripartition, amd be the occasion of the
“ great hail ”f spoken of in the description of the 7th vial.
It is as much beyond my province, as it is beyond my
power, to give a detailed account of prophetic history of this
war. Much may, however, be gathered by the student, from
a patient study and comparison of the prophecies above
referred to.
* See Bloomsbury Lent lectures for 1848, page 70, —where this criticism
is referred to. I mention this to show that this meaning of the passage has
not been suggested merely by the present position of Russia with respect
to the other European powers. I am also desirous of drawing the attention
of my readers to those admirable lectures, a series of which is published
every year.
t The frequency and violence of hail storms at Constantinople, as re-
marked upon by some travellers, and the great size of the hail sometimes
noticed there, give a peculiar propriety to this figure, if, (as seems pro-
bable,) the Ottoman empire is to be destroyed in this vial.


SECTION 111.
The Partial Return of the Jews.
(1.) Their return. —Isaiah, xxiv. I—2o ; xlix. 13—17; li.
I—2o ; Ezek. xxii. 19— 22 ; Zech. xii. 7.
(2.) Their temporal prosperity.—Ezek. xxxviii. 12 —13.
(3.) Anti-christ’s cupidity and his plots against them.—
Ezek. xxxviii. 8 —12; Dan. vii. 25.
Observations. —I have spoken above of the partial return
of the Jews to their own land. The passages quoted, and
many others, refer to their return in an unconverted state,
and before the advent. Having returned, they will suffer
many woes from the hostility of anti-christ, as we shall see
under the next Section; and having been delivered at the
advent the whole of the nation shall be gloriously and
miraculously restored to dwell in their own land.


SECTION IY.
The attack of Anti-christ and his host upon Jerusalem.
(1.) The attack.—lsaiah, xxiv.* 16-20. Jer. iv. 6 7 ; Ezek.
xxxviii. 14 — 16; Dan. ix. 26 — 27; Zech. xiii. B — 9, and xiv.
I — 2 ; Rev. xvi. 13 — 14.
(2.) The partial success of the attack,—Zech. xiii. 8;
xiv. 2 ; Luke, xxi. 22—24. See also, Joel, ii. I—l 7.
(3.) Israel’s humiliation, and cry for help.—Dent. xxx.
I—6 ; Jer. xxxi. 9, 18—20; 1. 4 ; Joel, ii. 16—17 ; Hos. i.
10, xi. 8 ; Zech. xii. 9—14.
(4.) The preaching of the witnesses. —Isaiah, xl. 1 — 11;
Joel, ii. 1 and 15 ; Mai. iii. 1., iv. 5 —6; Matt. xvii. 11 —12 ;
xxv. 6; Rev. xi. 6,
Observations. —It is generally believed that Isaiah, xl. 1,
et seq., and Mai. iv. 5—6, were fulfilled in the preaching of
John the Baptist. Our Lord said, “If ye will receive it (or
rather “ him”) this is Elias which was for to come.” Matt. xi.
14. He here gives the condition on the fulfilment of which
John’s mission was to be that of the expected Elijah. But
the Jews as a nation did not receive him. He did not “ turn
the hearts of the fathers to the children,” and so avert the
cause, (Mai. iv.,) neither did his preaching procure “ com-
fort” (Isaiah, xl.) for the nation of Israel. We may also
notice, that the prophecy in the Revelations (xi. 3.) was made
long after the death of the Baptist.
The object of the preaching of these witnesses will doubt-
less be, to direct the minds of the Jews, driven to their last
extremity, to look and cry for the appearance of their long
expected Messiah, to save them from that depth of calamity,
which is emphatically spoken of by the prophet as “ the time
fo Jacob’s trouble.”
The translation of this chapter in an axithorized version is rendered, some-
what obscure, by the ambiguous rendering of the word translated “ earth”
or “ land.” In the first verse it is translated “ the earth,” and in the 3rd,
“ the land. It occurs 16 times in this chapter, and may in each of these
places be translated “ land,” i. e., (he land of Israel.


SECTION y.
The Advent of MESSIAH.
(1.) The advent itself.—
(a.) Its suddenness. —Zech. xiv. 3—5; Mai. iii. 1 ;
Matt. xxiv. 42—51; Mark, xiii. 32— 37; Luke, xxi. 35;
I Cor. xv. 52 ; 1 Thess. iv. 16; 2 Peter, iii. 10 ; Rev. xxii, 20.
(b.) Its glory. —lsaiah, xxv. 6—lo ; Dan. vii. 9—lo ;
1 Thess. iv. 16—-IT; 2 Thess. i. 7 —10; Rev. xix. 11—16.
(2.) The attendants.—
(c.) The Angels. —2 Thess. i. 7.

changed without death—l Thess. iv. 16 — 17.; 1 Cor. xv.
51—52.; Rev. xx. 4—6; see also Isa. xxvi. 19; Job xix.
25—27; Matt. xxiv. 31.
(e.) The glory of the Saints with Christ. —Dan. xii.
3; Matt. xiii. 43 ; xix. 27—30 ; xxv. 34—40; 1 Thess. i. 10;
Rev- v. 10; xx. 4.
(3.) The place of the Advent. —
(f.) The place. —Zech. xiv. 4; Acts i. 11
(4.) Its effect upon Israel.
(g.) Deliverance . —Dent. xxx. 4—10; Dan. ii. 44 ;
Hos. ii. 18 — 20; Joel, ii. 18 — 32; Mic. iv. 11 — 13; Zech-
xiv. 10, 11.
(5.) Its effect upon the adversaries. —
(h.) Upon Antichrist. —Psalm, ii- I—s; xi. 6; xlvi. 9 ;
Ixviii. 1,2, 21—23; Isaiah, ix. 4,5; xxiv. 21, 22; xxx.
30—33 ; Dan. ix. 27; Mic. vii. 16, 17; Ezek. xxxviii. 14,
ad fin. ; xxxix. 1—22 ; Zech. xiv. 12—14; 2 Thes. i. 8; ii. 8 ;
Jude, 15 ; Rev- xviih 1—24; xix. 1,2, 17—21,
(A) Upon the ungodly , —Matt. xi. 21—24 ; xiii. 49,
50; xxiv. 48—51 ; xxv. 30, 41—46 ; &c.


(m.) Upon Satan. —lsaiah, xlix. £5 ; Luke, xi. 21, 22;
Rev. xx. 2.
Observations. —There is still an idea in the minds of many
that the Advent will be gradually introduced by the gradually
increasing righteousness of the world. In fact, that it will be
preceded by Millennium, and not followed by it. That idea,
however, among those students of prophecy, who accept the
literal interpretation of the words of inspiration, is, I think,
quickly giving place to the belief that the advent will be pre~
Millennial: that the Advent will introduce Millennium, and
not Millennium the Advent. To my own mind, Luke, xvii.
26 —30, is conclusive. The state of the world at the Advent is
there compared to that of the world before the deluge, and to
that of Sodom and Gomorrha previous to their overthrow—
a state, in both instances, of all hut universal apostacy-
Moreover, if Antichrist is to be destroyed by “ the brightness
of Messiah’s coming,” 2 Thess. ii. 8, and if Satan shall only
then be bound for a thousand years. Rev. xx. 2, 5, it follows
that these enemies of Christ’s glory will be in existence and
possessed of power at the very time of the Advent, And,
once more, if punishment is threatened against the nations
who disobey Christ’s laws after His coming, Zech. xiv. 5, 16
19, it follows that the nations of the world will exist after the
Advent, and therefore that the advent will be pre-millennial.
We may notice, also, in connection with this, that the cause
of true religion is not advancing in proportion to the advance
in the actual population of the world. Taking the generally
received calculation as our basis, which estimates the popula-
tion of the woxld at 1000 millions, and the number of pro-
fessing Christians at 250 millions, we see that even nominal
Christianity has made but very small progress, comparatively,
in 1800 years, a longer period than was allotted to previous
dispensations. Notwithstanding all the efforts of Missionary
societies during late years, the actual population of the world
is increasing in a greater proportion than the number of pro-
fessing Christians —so that the number of the latter, in pro-
portion, is actually decreasing . And if this is the case with


merely nominal Christians of every kind and name, what shall
we say of that far smaller number who worship God in spirit
and in truth ? If, therefore, we must wait for the advent of
Christ until the world is evangelised, we might well cry,
“Oh Lord, how long”! Compare Rev. vi. 9—ll, where
the time of the adversary’s power is spoken of as “a,
little season.” Compare 2 Peter iii. 9 ; Rev. xxii. 20.
“ Surely,” He said, “I come quickly; Amen. Even so, come
Lord Jesus.”

Observations. —Reference is frequently made above to Isaiah
ix. I—7. It is a passage of very great importance, but unfor-
tunately somewhat obscurely translated in our English ver-
sion. The following will, I think, be found to be a more close
translation, and to express more clearly the meaning of the
passage.
1. There shall not hereafter be darkness in the land which was distressed.
In the former time he debased
The land of Zabulon, and the land of Napthali;
But in the latter time he has made it glorious,
By the way of the sea, beyond Jordan,
Galilee of the nations.
2. The people that walked in darkness,
Have seen a great light;
They that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death
Upon them hath the light shined.
3. Thou hast multiplied the nation,
And increased joy to it ; (margin.)
They rejoice before thee as with the joy of harvest,
As men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
4. Bor the yoke of their burthen,
And the staff of their shoulder. —
The rod of their oppressor,
Thou hast broken, as in the day of Midian.
5, For the greaves of the armed warrior in the conflict,
And the garment roll ed in much blood,
Shall be for burning, even fuel for the fire.
6, For unto us a child is born,
Unto us a son is given ;
And the government shall be upon his shoulders ;
And his name shall be called Wonderful, Councillor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
7. Of the increase of his government and its peace there shall be no end,
Upon the throne of David, and upon his kindgom ;
To establish it, and to strengthen it, with justice and equity,
Henceforth and for ever ;
The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.
Thus the passage contains a promise, (1) that the land shall
be glorified hereafter, because it will receive (2) Christ “ the
Sun of Righteousness.” Then it declares the prosperity of


the land (3) and the destruction of the enemy (4,5.) Next
it speaks of the glorious attributes of Messiah, (6) which
though now denied by some, will then be manifested to all.
And lastly, it describes the nature of His kingdom, and its
eternal duration. I may also remark, that verse 4is exactly
parallel with Ezek. xxxviih 21; Zech. xiv. 13 ; and verse 5
with Ezek- xxxix. 9 ; Ps. xlvi. 9. I may further remark on
the 6 and 7 verses of this sublime prophecy—that the grand
effect of the Millennial kingdom and dominion of Christ will
be, to manifest that which is now so often professedly or else
practically denied, even “ His eternal power and Godhead.”
None will then deny him to be, el-gibbor, “ the mighty
God.”

Ixxxv. 12; Isa. xxx. 23—26; xxxv.; Iv. 12, 13;
Ezek. xxxiv. 27; xxxvi. 33—37.
Observations. —Ps* Ixvii. has been referred to, as specially
alluding to the Gentile world. As a slight criticism upon
one part of it will be equally true of a great number of pas-
sages in the Psalms and Prophets, I may be allowed to make
it in this place*
The word translated a people” in the 3,4, and 5 verses is
of the plural number. Both the singular and the plural
form are of very frequent occurrence ; and while the singu-
lar generally refers to the nation of Israel, the plural almost
invariably refers to the Gentile world, or Gentile nations.
Even single nations, if Gentile, are spoken of under the
plural form, as in Ps* cv* 20, where Pharaoh is called “ the
ruler of the peoples.” There is a remarkable instance of the


distinction observed between the use of these two forms in
Ps. xlvii. 9 :
The princes of the peoples are gathered together
A people of the God of Abraham.
While regarded as Gentile and heathen they are peoples
(plural), but they become a people (singular) when united to
the God of Abraham. See Bp. Horsley’s Commentary,
in loco.
There are two apparent exceptions to this rule. Micaiah
addresses the descendants of Abraham in the plural number.
Hearken, oh peoples 1 Kings, xxii. 28. To this ex-
pression the complete separation of the tribes into two king-
doms under two kings,then and there present, may probably
have compelled him. Joel, also, (Joel, ii. 6,) says that “the
faces of the peoples shall be pained” at the plague referred to.
Yet some of the surrounding countries may have been in-
cluded by the prophet in this prediction.
As it will point out many passages which refer to the Gen-
tile world, I shall add a list of those in the Psalms and in
Isaiah in which the plural form occurs.
Ps. vii. 8; ix. 11; xviii. 47 ; xxxiii. 10 ; xlv. 5, 17; xlvii.
1,3, 9 ; xlix. 1; Ivi. 7; Ivii. 9; Ixvi- 8; Ixvii- 3,4, 5 ; Ixviii.
30; Ixxvii. 14 ; Ixxxvii. 6 ; Ixxxix. 50 ; xcvi. 3,5, 7, 10, 13 ;
xcvii. 6; xcviii. 9; xcix. 1,2; cii. 22; cv. 1,20; cvi. 34;
cviii* 3.
Isaiah, ii. 3, 4 ; viii- 9; x. 13 ; xi. 10; xii. 4; xiv. 2, 6 ;
xvii. 12 ; xxiv. 13; xxv. 6,7; xxx. 28 ; xxxiii. 3, 12; xlix.
22 ; li. 5; Ivi. 7 ; Ixi. 9; Ixii. 10; Ixiii. 3, 6.
In Isaiah, Ixii. 10, both forms occur: “ prepare ye the way
for the people (Israel). .. .lift up a standard for the peoples
(the Gentiles).” The plural form occurs upwards of 150
times in the Old Testament, and I believe always (with the
exception of the two passages mentioned) may be referred to
Gentiles or Gentile nations.

Observations • I have, in the last section, referred merely
to the Epistles. The same passage may often be very properly
arranged under two or three different heads, but, for brevity’s
sake, I have not mentioned any passage more than once, un-
less for very special reasons. The list of texts, as well as of
subjects, may be much increased by careful study of the sacred
word.
May the Lord in mercy bless this attempt to assist His
people in the study of His word, —that my service “ may be
accepted of the saints,” and be instrumental in directing some
to the contemplation of His glorious coming and kingdom.
For, assuredly, “to them that look for Him , He will appear
the second time without sin unto salvation,”
“ When ye see these things begin to come to pass, then look
up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth
nigh.” —Luke xxi. 28.
“ He which testifieth of these things saith, surely I come
quickly. Amen.”
Even so, come, Lord Jesus.—Rev. xxii. 20.




APPENDIX.
APPENDIX A.
I have referred to the termination of the Prophetic Periods as a sign of
the latter days. The subject is deeply interesting, but necessarily, and
perhaps intentionally, somewhat obscure. The following brief notes may
assist the student in his enquiries^
The principal periods are the A and 1335 days of Daniel, xii; and
the 1260 days so often mentioned in the Revelations. The principle, that
by a prophetic day is meant a year in ordinary language, I willingly accept.
In the year 532, A.n., the Pandects of Justinian were issued, in which the
temporal power of the Pope was exalted and publicly acknowledged. If the
three periods be reckoned from this date—they will terminate as follows :
532 -I- 1260 1792, the French Revolution, the probable commence-
ment of the vials, Rev. xvi.
532 -I- 1290 = 1822, the sera of the revolt of the Greeks, the commence-
ment of the downfall of Turkey: the 6th vial.
532 -I- 1335 = 1867, the sera at which the 7th xnillennary of the history
of the human race will probably commence.
But another important sera in Church History is the year 606, when the
title Universal Bishop was granted to the Pope by Phocas. It is remark-
able also that at this very time, or within a few months, Mahommed began to
conceive the idea of founding a new sect. He now retired to his cave, and
a short time after, A.D, 609, began to preach his doctrines. Rev. ix. 1, 2.
If the year 606 be taken as a starting point, the 1260 years will terminate
in the year 1866, —a period to which on other data, the 1335 days of Daniel,
and the altogether independent calculations of Clinton’s Fasti Hellenic! have
already pointed.
APPENDIX B.
The following dates of events in the history of the followers of Mahommed
may be found of use to the student.
A.D, 607 Mahommed retires to his cave.
609 He preaches privately.
612 He preaches in public.
629 The Mahommedan armies attack Syria.
668 Constantinople beseiged the first time.
711 The Moors repulsed by Pelayo, after the battle of Xeres.
716-718 Constantinople beseiged the second time.
732 The Saracens defeated by Charles Martel.
750 The Abbassides supplant the Ommiades in the Caliphate.


7 55 One of the latter reigns in Spain, so that the Caliphate is
divided.
761 The Moors repulsed in Spain.
762 The city Medinat-al-Salem (the city of peace,) founded by the
Caliph Almanzor.
The termination of Rev. ix, I—ll. From, this date the Saracens but
little interfered with European affairs, Rev. ix. 12, until
Jan. 18, 1067, when Thogrul Beg marched from Bagdat. A long war
with Eastern Europe ensued, until at last (after 396 years 106 days, ReV.
ix. 15) Constantinople fell into the hands of the Saracens, May 29, 1453.
After the taking of Constantinople the Saracens continued their aggres-
sions with various success, until A.D. 1774, when the treaty dictated by
Prince Rumanzoff was signed, and “ the second woe passed” away. Rev.
xi. 14.
The 6th Yial appears to have commenced in A.D. 1820, at which time
the revolt of the Greeks commenced. Since that date, by revolts and insur-
rections, as among the Janisaries and in Albania; —by the loss of provinces,
as of Greece, Algeria, Egypt, and Syriaby desolating wars,—as those with
Russia and France and now with Russia again by plague and cholera,
Turkey, in the language of Chateaubriand, is perishing for want of Turks.
Late accounts estimate the Turks at only three millions; while the other
inhabitants of Turkey are reckoned at eighteen millions.
It is worthy of remark that many of the Turkish Moolahs are of opinion
that the religion of Mahommed is about to expire. One of the chief Syrian
Moolahs at Damascus, told the British Consul, Mr. Wood, a few months ago,
that “ he considered that Islamism had nearly run out its day.”
APPENDIX C.
A few general observations may be admitted here.
The Prophetic History of Europe does not exactly coincide with the
opinions of politicians. A smile of ridicule has therefore been excited
against a pamphlet* which has lately appeared on this subject, because the
writer is said to ignore the fact, that all Europe appears to be alive to the
importance of resisting the encroachments of Russia.
Doubtless it is for the present interest of Europe to restrain the power of
the great Northern Empire within certain bounds. Doubtless it is the desire
of politicians to do this. But can they accomplish their design ? they cannot ,
unless it be in accordance with the will of the Lord —the Author of Pro-
phecy. Therefore the question is not what will the nations attempt f but,
what hath the Lord spoken ?
* “ The Coming Struggle among the nations of the Earth.”


K.
n ‘
We have already seen Europe tumble to resist the impetuosity of one
man, who whs appointed to scourge her for her iniquities—unable until the
Lord permitted it. We may see it yet again.
The nations of Europe united may oppose formidable obstacles to the pride '
of the Czar. Eut what human power could oppose him if anything should
break the bond which now unites England and France ? That bond,
I imagine, consists of a very slender thread. It is written, “Associate
yourselves, oh ye people, yet ye shall be broken in pieces ; and give ear all • : J
ye of far countries, gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces ; ■ ( Jm
gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, J
and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for
God is with us.” Isa, viii. 9—lo.
And lastly, as regards England, honoured and exalted as it has been
above all the other nations of Europe, I have referred above (Section YI.)
to the work allotted to England. She will be a principal instrument in the
hands of Divine Providence in defending the Jewish nation, and restoring
it to the land of Israel, I believe, also, from a comparison of Rev. xi. 13
with Rev. xv. 2—4, and from the silence of prophecy in other parts respecting
her, that she will be spared the calamities, or many of them, which the rest
of Europe will suffer under the 7th Yial. Yet she will not, I fear, wholly
escape. She has erred deeply in the countenance and support she has given
directly and indirectly to the great Apostacy. Her protest against Romanism
has been strong at times, but marked of late by some awful inconsistencies,
I fear that the support of Maynooth College in Ireland, and of Romanism
itself, in her colonies, will not be unpunished. I fear that the convents and
monasteries, now becoming so numerous in England, will bring down wrath
upon her. I fear that the numerous perversions to Romanism from her
Church, and the awful Tractarianism, and the Romanizing teachers which
she has nourished in her bosom, will not be forgotten. At the present
moment, also, for mere political purposes, she is leagued with one of the
kingdoms of “ the beast,” in the vain work of supporting an Empire which
is doomed to destruction, because of its adherence to the religion of
Mahommed.
All this is independent of the profligacy, drunkenness, vice, and infidelity
which may be found within her.
“ Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord! Shall not my soul he
avenged on such a nation as this?”
Yet terrible and humiliating as may be the punishment of England, that
punishment will be but in measure. Some good thing is found in her,
thanks be to God, in her noble societies for disseminating the Gospel of
Christ—her Society for the Propagation of the Gospel—for Promoting
Christian Knowledge,—her Missionary Societies—her Jews Societies—her
Reformation Societies—and, above all, her Bible Society. Her lot will, there-
fore, through the mercy of God, differ from that of the other nations of
Europe, They will be punished by destruction—but she will be chastized
that she may be purified.


May she, therefore, have grace granted her, while yet there is time and
opportunity, to separate herself from the enemies of true religion and vital
Christianity, lest, having partaken of their guilt, she also suffer in their over-
throw. Individually and nationally, may she and her people hear and obey
the solemn admonition of that great Voice from heaven, which declared the
destruction of the mystic Babylon,—“ Come out op her, my people, that ye
be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. Por
her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniqui-
ties.”—Rev. xviii. 4, 5,
Reading and Wellbank, Printers, 12, Bridge Street, Sydney,
