FOREWORD
A very, very long time ago as long ago as you can
possibly imagine, for it was over two thousand years ago ?the
Greeks believed that the sun, moon and stars circled around the
earth.
They said that as each star moved it kept its own path or
"sphere?, which traced out a great circle in the centre of which
was our earth. The sphere farthest away had no star travelling
on it and was called the Crystal Sphere because it was made of
shining crystal. Many people believed that all the spheres were
crystal, and if you look up at the stars on a clear night and stare
very hard you will see why they might imagine this. There
seem to be so many stars that they make starry, crystal pathways
across the sky.
The Greeks thought that as the stars moved they made
most lovely music and on still nights the sound could be heard
faint and far away by those who listened.
Centuries and centuries passed and then, just four hundred
years ago, a man called Copernicus said that instead of the sun,
moon and stars moving around the earth, it was the earth,
moon and stars which moved around the sun .


birthday, when he was running to meet the postman, he fell
downstairs and hurt himself badly. He spent the rest of his
birthday and many weary days afterwards in bed. At first he
was too ill to want to play with his toys, but one afternoon he
was able to range his soldiers in battle array and make them go
to war again across the bedside table.
The battle made him tired, and he was glad to lie quietly
looking at the autumn sunshine which streamed through the
window. The soldiers still charged bravely across the table,
their swords glinting in the sun. The room and the garden
outside were very still, and David thought that faint and far
away he could hear music. He had often thought he could hear
music on a windless day, but he had never been quite sure, and
now he was too sleepy to listen. He shut his eyes and drowsed
in the warmth.
Some time later something ?it was not a noise?wakened
him, and he saw a strange little figure standing by his bed. At
first he thought he must be dreaming, but when he had stretched
his eyes and pinched himself, the figure was still there. It was a
little man, all dressed in silver, with long wings like a dragon
fly?s, folded close to his sides. Even his hair was silver and he
seemed quite old.
When David gazed at him in amazement, he gazed back,
and then smiled in a friendly way.
"Are you David?" he asked, and his voice was sweet and
clear, like the sound of two crystal glasses touched together.


DAVID MEETS SWIFTWINGS
David nodded, too surprised to speak
"Good,? said the little man, "I was afraid I might have
mistaken the house.?
They both went on looking at each other, and then the
little figure spoke impatiently.
"Well, well! Have you no welcome? I know I?m a very
rare happening, but I am real ?you mortals never believe your
eyes when you see a fairy ?here?s my hand to feel.?
David shook his firm little hand and stammered, "I?m very
glad to see you, but. . . but you came so suddenly that. . . that
you surprised me.?
"Of course??the fairy seemed quite satisfied. "My name
is Swiftwings, and I have come to take you to find the stairway


to Fairyland?if you will come with me.? "O yes, I will!?
David found his voice quickly. "Well, it?s not easily found, you
know,? said Swiftwings. "You see, there are many fairies
working on the Earth, but the real Fairyland is far away on the
Crystal Sphere that circles the Earth. I can return there easily,
but it is very hard for a mortal ?in fact, it is quite impossible
without my help,? he added proudly.
"But I can find it, if you help me?? David questioned
eagerly.
"Yes, but it is a long, difficult journey, for the stairway to
Fairyland is found on a moonbeam in the Antarctic snow. It is
a magic moonbeam, the very strongest the moon can lend us,
for we have to climb right past the moon. We call the moon-
beam the Escalator Beam, for the stairs move up it. Before you
find the stairway you will be tired and hungry and very cold.
Do you still want to come with me??
David did not hesitate. No matter how hard the journey
might be, he wanted to find Fairyland.
"Yes, oh yes I do!? he answered.
"Very well, then, we?ll set off at once.?
Swiftwings looked at him with his head on one side
"And I think you had better dress. You will need something
warmer than those pyjamas.?
David sprang out of bed, quite forgetting that he had once
felt very ill, and rushed for the cupboard where his clothes were
kept. "I left Jack on Lob?s Island,? the fairy said as David was


DAVID MEETS SWIFTWINGS
struggling with his clothes. "He is another boy the same age
as you are. He lives in Northern Queensland, miles away from
anywhere. I thought I should never stop flying; I?m glad you
only live in Melbourne. But you had both heard the fairy
music, so a messenger had to be sent to find you.?
"The fairy music ... ?? David questioned. "Yes ?you?ve
heard it sometimes, haven?t you?? "I thought I heard music
before you came, but I wasn?t sure,? said David slowly.
"That was the music of the spheres,? said Swiftwings.
"Only a very few mortals ever do hear it, and most of those are
children, but if a child once hears it, he has a chance of finding
Fairyland.?
"Do you think I shall really be able to find it?? asked David
anxiously.
"I?m not sure. The journey is very difficult, and some
children who have set out to find the stairway have lost heart on
the way and asked to return home, but if you really try you will
find it. I can only take one child at a time for the first part of
the journey. It is all so hard to manage, and I have to do it by
myself.? He sighed heavily and seemed very sorry for himself.
David did not know quite what to say, so he asked what
Lob?s Island was like.
Swiftwings smiled ?"It is a fairy island, but it would take
a long time to tell you about it, and you?ll see it soon enough.
Are you ready??
"Yes,? panted David, pulling on his coat.


"Now you must follow me, and always do as I do,? com-
manded Swiftwings. "Ferloppity is waiting in the street for
us. She will take us to the sea-shore.? "She is a seven-league
kangaroo,? he added, seeing David about to question him.
He turned and flew out over the window sill into the
garden, and David scrambled after him. They passed through
the gate into the street. There was a great grey kangaroo stand-
ing by the kerb. She was larger than any kangaroo he had ever
seen or heard of, yet there were numbers of people passing by,
and none of them seemed to see her!
Swiftwings flew up and climbed into Ferloppity?s pouch.
She reached down her forepaws and helped David in, and then
they were off in one tremendous bound. They soared up and
up, past the houses, past the telephone wires. David lost his
breath, and the wind was so strong that it brought tears to his
eyes. Still they went up and up, over the tallest trees. Then
they were far above the city, and the streets and houses looked
as if they were a picture taken from an aeroplane. Soon they
were moving in clear blue sky, with here and there a little
cloud. When David became used to the rising movement it
was very pleasant to look out over the edge of the pouch.
A little voice came from above his head "Please, could
one of you sit back a little? My passengers must always sit well
back, otherwise I cannot rise properly.? "Fm sorry, Ferloppity,?
said Swiftwings ?"David, come closer to me, and that will even
the balance.?


DAVID MEETS SWIFTWINGS
David moved back. Now he could not see the city, but far
off was the blueness of the sea.
''How long shall we be away?? he asked Swiftwings sud-
denly. He had been so excited that he had quite forgotten how
worried his mother would be when she found his empty bed.
''No one will know you have gone,? answered the fairy,
guessing his thoughts. ''We are in fairy time, which is any time
at all, or no time at all.?
Just then they were nearly thrown out of the pouch. Fer-
loppity was making queer, rumbling noises.
"Ferloppity,? said Swiftwings sternly, holding tightly to
the kangaroo?s soft fur, ''have you got hiccoughs again ??
"I . . . I . . . Fm afraid so,? answered Ferloppity in a very
small voice indeed. "Fm sorry... Hid! And they were nearly
thrown out again.
?Ferloppity , ? said Swiftwings, really worried, ''can?t you
hold your breath? Is this because you?ve been eating gum-tips
? 9
again?
"I?m trying to hold it,? said the kangaroo sadly. ''And I
haven?t been eating gum-tips, I. . . HIC //?
At this upheaval Swiftwings was bumped right out, and
only saved himself by clinging tightly to the edge of the pouch.
David helped him back, and they both crouched as far down as
they could.
''This is really too bad!? said the fairy very crossly. ''There


was the same trouble on my last journey with Jack. I asked her
to be very careful of her diet before this one, and just feel her!?
Poor Ferloppity?s tummy was bulging in and out, making
the queerest rumbling noises as she tried not to hiccough.
David and the fairy were both clinging hard to the pouch,
expecting to be bumped out again, but by great efforts Fer-
loppity managed not to have any more big hiccoughs. Swift-
wings settled himself more comfortably and smoothed his
wings, which had fallen out of their folds during the shaking.
"What is Jack like?? asked David, for he wanted to know
something of the boy who was to share part of this wonderful
adventure with him.
"He?s taller than you, and has red hair, and a lot of
freckles,? the fairy answered. "I should think you?d like him
very much. He knows you are coming to meet him on Lob?s
Island and is very excited about it. Now, look, we?re nearly
over the sea!?
David looked out again and gasped, for above them were
great masses of cotton-wool clouds, and below was the sea,
wrinkled by white waves.
"It is only the bay,? explained Swiftwings. "Presently we
shall be landing on the shore of the ocean.?
Even as he spoke Ferloppity seemed to halt in the air, and
they began to glide downwards. Some surprised seagulls flew
screeching around them. They fell below the clouds, then

below the tree-tops, and then the ground seemed to rush to
meet them as Ferloppity landed with a bump.
The kangaroo helped them both to the ground, though the
fairy did not need much help, for he flew the short distance
down. They had landed on a sandy beach where the great ocean
rollers came thundering in. A little further down, a tumbled
mass of jagged black rocks thrust out into the white foam.
"I am very sorry about the hiccoughs," said Ferloppity in
her funny little voice. "I am not as young as I once was, and I
have to be careful of what I eat, though I really can?t think what
caused them this time." She scratched her ear and frowned.


DAVID MEETS SWIFTWINGS
''Well, never mind now,? said Swiftwings, but try to be
more careful next time; though I really don t know when that
will be ?there are very few children as lucky as Jack and David.?
"That?s so,? said the kangaroo, "and I hope you have a
good journey, David, and find Fairyland.?
"Thank you,? said David. He stretched up his hand as far
as he could and Ferloppity stretched downwards, and they
shook hand and paw.
"Good-bye, Ferloppity,? said David, very sorry to leave the
big, gentle kangaroo. He ran over the sand after the fairy. As
he reached the first of the rocks he turned to look back, and saw
her still there watching. She waved a paw to him, and he waved
back, and that.was the last he saw of her.
As they began climbing out over the rocks towards the sea
Swiftwings gave David his hand to help him over the more
difficult parts, for, although he was smaller, he had a great
advantage in being able to fly a little when he slipped. It was
not long before they had clambered out to the end of the rocks,
and there David stood staring at what he saw.
A shining black body was curving in and out of the water,
and turning backwards and forwards by the side of the rocks in
a flurry of splashing.
It was a big fish, and looked rather like a black pig,
except that no pig could ever have been as graceful as he turned
and curved in and out of the water.


"That?s Popoff, the Porpoise," said Swiftwings. "He?s going
to take us down under the sea."
David was cold standing in the wind that swept across the
rocks; he was also quite wet, for the spray was flying off the
waves as they crashed in. He became afraid.
"But, won?t I drown?" he asked.
"Not while you?re with me," said Swiftwings, firmly.
"Fairies often travel underwater and can live there as easily as
they can on land, and while mortals are with them they can too;
so if you stay close to me you are quite safe."
Hoy, Popoff!" he shouted, cupping his hands to his
mouth so that his voice should carry above the noise of wind
and sea. "Over here!"
The porpoise plunged up to the rock where they were
standing.
I was nearly late," he puffed in a big, booming voice.
The tide s been against me." He swam on past the rock again.
"Now," said Swiftwings to David, "the next time he
swims past we?ll both jump on to his back. Hold my belt tightly
when you re on him, so that you won?t be swept off by the
water."
David looked at the broad, slippery black back. He decided
that it was going to be very difficult to ride a porpoise, but some-
how, if he was to find Fairyland, he had to do it. He waited
until Popoff turned and came past again. Swiftwings leapt
neatly on, and David shut his eyes and jumped. He was lucky,

The mermaids flitted between the tables
and talked
with their sisters."




DAVID MEETS SWIFTWINGS
for he landed squarely on the porpoise. He clung to him with
his knees while he clutched Swiftwing?s belt with both hands.
Popoff grunted twice as he felt each rider settle down, and
then swam backwards and forwards past the rocks a few times.
David became used to the strange movement, which was rather
like that of his old rocking-horse at home.
"Now, are you ready?" asked the fairy. "We are going to
dive. Hold tightly!"
He dug both little silver heels into Popoff?s sides


Under the Sea
Whoosh! Down they went. The green wall of water
nearly choked David, and almost tore him from the porpoise?s
back. He had no breath left and was gasping; a stream of
bubbles sped from his mouth back towards the surface. Still
they dived, and still he somehow managed to cling to Swift-
wing?s belt.
Down deeper. The pale green of the water was growing
darker. A cloud of small, silvery fishes flashed by.
Deeper still ?the force of the water was pushing him off
Popoff?s back, but he still clung to the fairy?s belt.
Then they were diving less steeply. Now David managed


UNDER THE SEA
to grip the porpoise?s back more firmly with his knees, and was
able to breathe again and even to look about.
In front of him Swiftwing?s silver hair floated upwards, and
his own head felt fight as his hair was swept back by the water
which pushed against them.
On their left was a high cliff, hung with strange sea
growths which floated out past them. David peered down
through the green twilight and saw the sea floor covered in a
waving field of sea grass. Popoff was swimming slowly now
and gliding just above the sea grass.
David stared about him at this queer, green under-water
world.
Over everything there lay a great silence, the shoals of
fishes glided by gaping and goggling at the porpoise with his
strange riders.
At home David had a big book with coloured pictures of
fishes; now he looked eagerly about, trying to see some of the
different kinds.
A yellow sea-snake looped out of the sea grass, looked at
them, and disappeared behind a weed-covered rock. David
suddenly straightened up ?he had seen a fish he knew. It was a
John Dory swimming by himself, opening and shutting his big
rubbery mouth, his queer elastic nose stretching in and out as
he caught the tiny sea animals which floated by. On each of his
sides was a dark mark which looked like a thumb and finger
print.


"It?s all right, he won?t harm you while I?m here,? said
Swiftwings.
David found his breath again, very thankful. He could
feel Popoff stiff between his knees nearly every sea-creature
fears the shark, the wolf of the seas.
They passed right under that great grey shadow. Looking
up, David saw a little fish glued to the white belly. He knew
that this must be a sucker fish which goes everywhere clinging
to the shark, and eats the scraps of food he leaves.
A shoal of pretty brown and yellow banded fish, their fins
like tiny sails, glided around the corner of a rock, saw the shadow
of the shark, wheeled, and darted away.
"Those Old Wives have had a fright!? Swiftwings smiled.
They had left the shark behind now, and had passed over the
field of sea-grass. The floor of the sea was sandy beneath them,
and ahead David saw a forest of dark sea-weed.
As they came to the first waving branches the porpoise
swam more and more slowly, until he was hardly moving
through the water. His two riders slipped from his back to
the smooth, hard sand.
David looked about him. It had become very dark and
cold, and there was a horrible smell. He did not like it at all,
and moved as close as he could to the fairy.
Popoff did not seem to mind the dark coldness. He grunted
and cleared his throat with a noise and commotion which stirred


UNDER THE SEA
the water about them, and sent a stream of bubbles upwards.
He began to complain, his voice booming in the silence.
"I told those angler fish to be on time, and there?s not a
glimmer of them ?not a glimmer! I don?t know what the fish
of to-day are coming to. You can never depend on them.
Never! I nearly broke my back swimming against the tide to
be on time for you, and here we are with not a sign of an angler
?not a sign!? He snorted in disgust, and swam angrily back-
wards and forwards.
He was about to become really angry when David saw a
glow of light coming from the darkness of the forest, and then
six ugly black fishes swam out between the thick branches of
sea-weed and swished past Popoff. The porpoise was so sur-
prised by the suddenness of their coming that he closed his
mouth with a gulp, and then shot up in the water till he was just
higher than they. He looked down at them angrily.
The angler fishes swam round and round David till he was
quite giddy, and each nibbled him very gently. They had big
mouths with curving teeth, and on top of their heads each had a
long feeler with a little globe of light on the end of it. They
took their places, three in front, and three behind him. As they
moved they made not the slightest sound, and seemed to take
no notice of the big porpoise.
''They will help us now,Popoff,? said Swiftwings, nodding
at the anglers. "Thank you very much for bringing us so far.?
Not at all, rumbled the porpoise. "Glad to help; very


glad. I hope you find Fairyland, David. I hope you do, but
you?ve a long way to go yet ?a very long way ?though you
may get there in time.? With this he turned suddenly in the
water, and shot away before David could answer.
Swiftwings was looking into the blackness of the forest and
frowning. The anglers had lightened the gloom a little, but it
was still frighteningly dark. He spoke seriously to David.
"Now, hold my belt, and don?t let go. Follow me, and
watch where you tread ?it?s very slippery; and remember, you
must not lose sight of me.?
David had been frightened by the forest before, but at this
warning he wanted to run away as fast as he could. Yet there
was really nowhere safe to go, so he took a deep breath and
clung hard to Swiftwing?s belt. Whatever happened, he must
find Fairyland.
The anglers had lit the darkness in a circle around them,
but outside this little circle it was quite black. With only the
faint light to guide them they stepped forward into the shadow
of the great branches of sea-weed. The darkness closed in, and
David clung tightly to Swiftwings, keeping his eyes fixed upon
the dirty sand beneath his feet. As the fairy had said, it was very
slippery, and here and there his feet sank to the ankles in grey
soft sea-weed and sand.
After they had gone a little way he dared to look about him,
and then at once wished he had not, for the forest was a truly
horrible place. The sea-weed had woven a roof above which


UNDER THE SEA
shut out all light; and though there was a narrow sandy track
where they were walking, on either side the darkness leant
towards them, and cold branches of sea-weed brushed against
David so that he wanted to run, and run, and run away from
them. Instead, he held tightly to the fairy, and walked quietly,
though his heart was bursting with fright.
Then he saw something more horrible. There were live
grey things moving slowly in and out between the rubbery
branches of sea-weed. Most of them were like the slaties that
scuttle out from under upturned stones, but none of these sea-


things scuttled ?they floated like jelly-fish, and always they
seemed to float closer to the pathway. They wanted to see and
touch the strange mortal creature and his fairy guide who had
invaded their dark world. Numbers of them were eyeless but
had long waving feelers which brushed over David and Swift-
wings, and moved away in fright when they felt such strange
shapes. Most horrible of all there were great octopuses slipping
through the branches, their shining eyes fixed upon the two
strangers.
Swiftwings whispered as he felt David?s start of terror:
"They are more frightened than you. You must try to show
you are not afraid, because if you frighten them any more they
will squirt their ink so that we shall not be able to see at all, and
then we shall be lost in the darkness.?
This sounded so awful that David managed to walk on,
even though his knees were shaking. The faithful anglers still
lit their path through the thick darkness by swimming above
their heads so that the light was thrown in a pale circle.
The forest seemed endless, and David became so tired that
his legs were stiff and sore; yet nothing would have persuaded
him to walk more slowly, or to rest even for a moment. There
were stones half hidden in the slippery sand of the path, and he
would have fallen more than once if the fairy had not helped
him.
When the eyeless creatures touched him it was almost more


UNDER THE SEA
than he could bear, but he knew he could not turn back; he
must go on to find the Escalator Beam.
Then, at last, through the thick trunks he saw light glim-
mering. At first he thought it must still be the light from the
anglers, but he looked upwards and saw that the two were
different. This new light had a warm pink glow, and the other
was only a faint candle beam.
All at once he forgot his fear and tiredness, for gliding
through the forest were two of the lovelist creatures he had ever
seen. He knew at once that they must be mermaids, for though
they had the bodies of women, they tapered to silvery fishes?
tails, with which they swam gracefully. They were pearly white
with stiff, pale green hair, and their eyes were a darker, glowing
green.
Welcome, David! they said together as they clasped his
hands. "We have been waiting for you." As they spoke each
waved good-bye to the anglers, who flicked their tails in salute
and swam away.
Swiftwings greeted the mermaids and told David their
names were Lyria and Volute. Lyria was the taller and more
talkative of the two. As he became used to their strange green
and white beauty, David easily learnt to tell them apart.
With their coming the forest did not seem to be such a
frightening place. Then, too, the light he had seen in the dis-
tance grew until he found they were almost out of the sea-weed.
At last they came to an open space in the centre of which was a


hill. There was an arched doorway in the hillside, and it was
from here that the warm light shone into the green darkness.
"We are going to see the Cavern of Coral, one of the homes
of the mermaids,? said Swiftwings. "The mermaids are a
friendly people, though sailors have often said unkind things
about them.? He smiled at Lyria and Volute, who laughed
back at him. Lyria explained to David.
"Sometimes sailors think we try to wreck their ships by
singing so sweetly that they forget to watch for rocks. They
are wrong, for no mermaid would do such a thing, though our
cousins, the sirens, have been known to misbehave in that way.
They are worthless creatures and have legs instead of tails. Of
course, if, by accident, a sailor should see one of us and try to
catch her, that is not our fault, for we always try to be invisible
when we are at the surface of the water. But as to bothering
about sailors, we are far too busy for that!? She frowned at
Swiftwings, but then smiled. David asked her what it was that
kept the mermaids so busy.
"That is what you are going to see in a moment,? she
answered.
"We mermaids show the shell-fish how to make all the
shells which you find washed up on the beach. Every little
shell-fish has to have a different shell for his house, and it is we
who draw the shell first to show him what his house is to be
like. The first drawing is kept by us, and what is called a
pink-print is made and given to the shell-fish, so that if he loses


UNDER THE SEA
it before he has finished his work he can be given another copy.
Some of them are very careless, and the Keeper of the Pink-
prints has a busy time.?
"Is there a new drawing for every shell, or is there only one
for the different kinds?? David asked.
"That all depends,? Lyria answered. "You will have
noticed some shells are so alike that you can hardly tell the
difference between them. Those have been built from the
same picture drawn by us, but there are others which, though
the same kind of shell-fish has built them, are unlike in some
small ways. When you see those shells you will know that
the shell-fish has asked for a new picture.?
They had been walking towards the doorway as they
talked, and now they stepped inside. David stopped, quite
speechless with surprise.


The Cavern of Coral
His fears of the forest forgotten, he gazed at the loveliness
of the great Cavern of Coral. The curvingwalls and roof were
of pale pink coral, smooth and shining, and placed around the
walls were long tables of coral, with little round stools beside
them. At each table sat a mermaid working busily at drawing
pictures on long strips of pink paper with coral pencils. More
mermaids flitted between the tables through the crystal clear
water and talked about their work with their sisters who were
busy drawing. The shining walls and ceiling of the long
cavern reflected the mermaids at work at their tables or swim-
ming from place to place, so that the lovely cavern seemed much
larger than it really was.
David noticed that there was a hole in the wall above each
table, and that in each was a mass of pink papers. Above every
hole was hung a different type of shell. He felt someone touch
his hand, and turned to see a shy little mermaid with rather


THE CAVERN OF CORAL
darker hair and eyes than Lyria and Volute. She smiled and
drew him towards an empty table.
'This is where I work," she said. "My name is Nerita."
She picked up an unfinished drawing to show him.
"That?s a Crow Shell!" David exclaimed at once.
"Yes" the little mermaid was pleased at his quickness.
Pulling down a few drawings and pink-prints from the
hole above her table, she showed David that although there
seemed to be very little difference between the prints of the
Crow Shells, sometimes there was more white splashed on the
glossy blackness of the shell, and sometimes the shapes were a
little different.
"There is Volute going on duty," said Nerita, as Volute
slipped past them and glided rather than swam to the other end
of the Cavern.
Swiftwings, who had been talking to Lyria, came up to
David.
"We shall follow her," he said. Leaving Nerita, David
followed him the length of the shining Cavern to where there
was a big important-looking desk made of deep pink coral
and placed facing a closed door in the paler pink wall. At
the desk was seated a tall mermaid carefully making notes in a
large book. She wore pale green spectacles, and her stiff green
hair was tightly pulled back and clasped by two pretty butterfly
shells. She looked over her spectacles at David and the fairy,


nodded, and smiled briefly while she held her pencil poised for
a moment over the book, and then went on with her work.
"She,? explained Swiftwings, a most unusual note of respect
in his voice, "is the Keeper of the Pink-prints.?
Volute was close by the big desk. The Keeper put down
her pencil, took off her spectacles, and nodded to Volute. The
mermaid glided forward and pulled open the sliding door in the
wall. At once David heard a jumble of strange noises. By
standing on his toes he could just see over the edge of the desk,
and there, crowded in the open doorway, were a number of
queer, grey, grub-like things. They were making sucking,
gurgling noises. At last out of the confusion he began to hear
voices and words.
"They are the shell-fish who have lost the pink-prints for
their shells,? Swiftwings explained.
The Keeper held up her hand for silence.
"In line, please,? she commanded; then, as the shell-fish
shuffled and slid into line, "First from the left!?
"Periwinkle,? explained the first shell-fish in a snuffling
voice. "A crab ate my pink-print.?
"Very well,? said the Keeper, "but try to keep away from
crabs next time.? She made a note in her book. "Next,
please!?
"Cowry,? grunted the next one. "A rock slipped on mine,
and I can?t pull it out.?
"That was very careless,? said the Keeper sternly. You

should not have been building anywhere near a loose rock.?
She made another note in her book. "Next, please!?
"Limpet,? came the answer in a very small voice.
The Keeper dropped her pencil, and stared in surprise at
the shell-fish
?Limpetl ??she gasped. "How in the name of the sea did
you come to lose your pink-print? It?s only happened once
before!?
The limpet looked very cross. "It was that anemone,? he
growled. He took it when I let go just for a moment.?
Well, well! ? The Keeper made another note in her
book. "We?ll give you another print, and you?ll soon be able
to finish your house.? The Keeper made a list of the prints the


shell-fish wanted, and then Volute, who had been waiting
quietly by the desk and making a list too, went off to the
different mermaids in the Cavern and took the pink-prints
from them. She came back, gave these to the shell-fish, then
pushed the door shut again; and then she went back to work
at her own table.
The Keeper got up from the desk, nodded to Swiftwings
and David, and glided off down the Cavern, where at each table
she looked at the work the mermaids were doing.

rabbits came back . .

THE CAVERN OF CORAL
"She has to see every new drawing for the shells," explained
the fairy. "She is looking at them now."
"Does she do it all by herself?" asked David, thinking of
the thousands of different shells.
"Yes," Swiftwings answered. "She does for this part of
the ocean, but there are other Caverns far away, and in every
one of them the oldest and cleverest mermaid is chosen as the
Keeper of the Pink-prints."
"Is the Escalator Beam very far away now?" asked David,
for in spite of the loveliness of the Cavern he was still eager to
find the way to Fairyland.
"It?s a good way off," Swiftwings smiled, "but there is
nothing more for you to see here, and Jack is waiting for us on
Lob?s Island."
"Oh, are we going there now?" David cried joyfully. He
had almost forgotten Jack while he had been seeing so many
exciting things, but he was very eager to reach the island and the
boy who was now to share his adventure.
"Yes, almost at once," Swiftwings smiled. "I expect Jack
is just as impatient as you are. As the mermaids are so busy, we
shan?t trouble them to say good-bye. Now shut your eyes
tightly, hold my belt, and count ten slowly. Slowly, mind!"
David had closed his eyelids so tightly that they were quite
wrinkled. He was holding the fairy?s belt, and as Swiftwings
said "Begin counting!" he began slowly . . . "One . . . two . ..
three ..." A great rushing noise surprised him so much that
c 31


he nearly opened them again, but he went on ?"Four... five...
six . . He was suddenly swept off his feet, and, still holding
Swiftwing?s belt, he rose up and up, faster and faster.
"Seven ... eight... nine ...? He counted breathlessly,
still soaring upwards.
"Ten!? He gasped, and landed with a bump. He opened
his eyes


Lob's Island
He was standing amongst some tall poplars; nearby was a
big oak tree, to the lowest branch of which Swiftwings flew.
There he sat looking up at a fat blackbird. The blackbird
winked at the fairy, then put his head on one side and looked at
David. He whistled, chuckled, and flew off through the trees.
"Where?s Jack?? asked David, looking about him, and
taking great gulps of the sunshine. He was quite glad to be in
the air again after travelling for so long through water. It was
a blue and gold day, with a little wind ruffling the tree-tops and
gently turning the leaves of the poplars so that they shone silver
in the sun. There was a smell of clean earth and sun-warmed
grass
I think you might be able to see him if you climb to the
top of this tree,? answered Swiftwings, swinging comfortably


on the bough of the oak tree. "He should be somewhere over
there." He pointed the way the blackbird had flown.
David was soon on the lowest branch of the tree, and as the
fairy watched with twinkling eyes he climbed higher and higher
until he could see beyond the other tree-tops.
In the distance was a queer little house in a space amongst
the trees. A brown and white cow was grazing nearby with
her calf close at her side. There were some white hens pecking
about the doorway, and a man was sitting on a log among the
hens with a boy beside him whose hair glinted red in the sun.
"Is he there?" called Swiftwings from below as he watched
David in the tree-top.
"Yes!" shouted David.
"All right! Climb down, and we?ll go to him." The fairy
had hardly finished speaking when David came sliding down.
"Here, be careful; not so fast!" he cried. "You 11 fall and
hurt yourself!"
Luckily David landed safely on the soft grass. He stood
waiting as the fairy unfolded his wings and glided down off his
low bough.
"There?s a man with Jack. Who is he?? asked David.
"He,? answered Swiftwings, smiling, "is Lob-iie-by-the-fire.
It?s his island."
"Lob .. . ? David was surprised. When Swiftwings had
spoken of the island he had thought it was just a name like
Kangaroo Island, or Christmas Island. Now he began to re-


LOB'S ISLAND
member hearing of Lob-lie-by-the-fire in fairy tales. As he was
about to ask a question, the fairy went on explaining.
"Lob once lived in the north of England, and he was a very
useful fairy. In the early mornings, while the farm labourers
slept, he often milked the cows, threshed the corn, and cut wood,
so that when the mortals awoke half their work was done for
them. The country people were very grateful to him, and
would leave bowls of cream in payment, and did not mind if he
lay by the fire during the night as he loved to do. In those
days he was the cheeriest, friendliest fairy you could wish to meet.
That was a long time ago.? Swiftwings shook his head sadly.
"Not many people believe in fairies now before Lob left
England he was most unhappy, because sometimes when he had
gone to the trouble of making himself visible the country folk
would look right through him, and never know he was there!
He was so unhappy that he moved to this fairy island where it
is always springtime and where he can be among the English
animals and trees that he loves. He looks after them and any
mortal child, like Jack, whom I leave here for a little while.?
"Did he come from the Crystal Sphere, too?? asked David.
"Oh no, no!? Swiftwings frowned at the idea of such a thing.
"He?s always been a rough country fellow what we call an
earth-bound fairy.?
Oh,? said David, and not being able to think of any other
answer, he walked in silence till they reached the little house.
Jack saw them as they came out of the trees and at once ran
C 2 5C


to them. He had more freckles than David had seen on any boy
before, and was very thin. He was breathless when he reached
them and seemed suddenly shy; then he smiled widely and said:
"Hullo, David; I thought you were never coming! I?ve
wanted to see you so much. I?m so glad you?re back, Swift-
wings; Lob is, too; he?s been hoping you would come soon so
that you could help him make a baby hare well again. It?s
broken its leg ?caught it in a forked stick. Come and see!? He
took David by the hand, and together they ran to where Lob sat
holding the little hare in his rough, hairy hands.
He was not at all like a fairy, for he was just a short, rough-
looking man who seemed to be brown all over. His coarse
clothes were the colour of the brownish grey tree trunks, and his
shaggy hair and kind eyes were brown, too. He glanced at
David and Jack as they raced towards him, scattering the hens,
but took no more notice of them and went on making soothing,
murmuring noises to the baby hare which lay across his knees.
At his feet its mother watched with big, sorrowful eyes.
When Swiftwings came up, Lob nodded to him and
pointed to the twisted leg of the little hare. "Just found him,?
he said, in a soft, slurred voice. "It?ll need splints.?
"Yes,? said the fairy, stroking the hare?s soft fur, and put-
ting his hand gently on its mother?s head. "Boys could find a
few smooth, short sticks,? went on Lob, still not looking up
at them.
Jack and David went off and looked for the sticks. They


LOB?S ISLAND
soon found three good ones and took them back to Lob and
Swiftwings. Lob had placed the little hare on the log and was
holding it there while Swiftwings looked at the broken leg.
Lob looked at the sticks, nodded, and took the two smoothest.
He pulled a bundle of long grasses from his pocket and laid
them beside the sticks. Then he nodded to Swiftwings. The
fairy straightened the leg, and Lob placed the two sticks as
splints, one on either side; then he bound them firmly to the
broken leg with some of the long grasses, and soothed the baby
hare, which was crying.
While the leg was being set the mother hare moved up and
down with frightened eyes. When it was done she rubbed her-
self against Lob?s rough old trousers and whispered, "Thank
you, oh, thank you both!?
"He?ll be right now,? said Lob.
The two hares went slowly away, the young one moving
stiffly on three legs.
Lob stepped in through the doorway of his little house.
David had been so interested in the mending of the little
hare?s leg that he had not looked about him. Now he noticed
the shape of the house for the first time.
It was the sawn-off trunk of what had once been an enor-
mous tree. Its little green door swung in two halves like a
stable door, and each half was hinged to the side of the tree with
leather. There were two windows with green shutters, and


from what was a hole in the roof, though he was not tall enough
to see, a thin line of blue smoke curled upwards in the clear air.
There were spring flowers growing in the grass about the
tree-house ?brave, golden daffodils, frail snowflakes, and bright
hyacinths. Under the trees was a mist of bluebells.
"You must be very hungry,? said Jack as David looked
about him. He found that he was hungry, very hungry.
"I think Lob has dinner ready,? said Swiftwings. "We?ll
go in.


LOB'S ISLAND
He swung open the closed lower half of the door and they
went in.
The house had only one round room, in the centre of which
was a wooden table with little green stools placed about. There
was a black pot hanging above the fire in a big, open fireplace,
and fitted neatly into spaces in the walls were three bunks, one
above the other. On each was a bright patchwork quilt. The
floor was made from slats of wood placed so they made an open
lattice work. This meant that all the dust and dirt fell through,
and there was no need to worry about sweeping. It was the
neatest, prettiest little house you could imagine. Lob was stand-
ing by the fire, stirring in the black pot with a long-handled
spoon. The smell from the pot made the boys sniff hard and
feel even hungrier.
"'Nearly ready,? said Lob. "Bring the plates!?
Jack picked up three wooden plates and spoons which were
warming by the side of the fire, and held them until Lob gave
them their dinner. They all sat down at the table and ate hun-
grily. It was a beautiful stew, unlike anything David had ever
tasted.
Swiftwings had disappeared, and Lob sat at the table gazing
through the open doorway into the distance. He took no notice
of the boys, and David began to wonder if this strange fairy had
forgotten they were there.
"Doesn?t Swiftwings want any dinner?? he asked, not


liking to break the silence, but afraid that the fairy would go
hungry, for there did not seem to be any stew left.
"No need,? Lob answered. David looked at Jack.
"Swiftwings told me he didn?t need to eat or sleep while
he was on the earth,? the boy explained. "He?s a fairy from
the Crystal Sphere, and so he can do almost anything. Where?s
he gone, Lob?? he asked.
"To look about. He?ll be back in time,? Lob answered.
"David, did you ride in Ferloppity?s pouch, and did Popoff
take you under the sea?? asked Jack.
"Yes, I did, and weren?t you frightened by the things in the
sea-weed forest?? answered David.
"Yes, I was, but I never knew before that the mermaids
drew the pictures of the shells before they were made did
?V 9
you?
"No. And I never knew mermaids had green hair, either.
Do you think Fairyland could possibly be lovelier than the
Cavern of Coral?? asked David.
"I know it must be ?lovelier than anything we?ve ever
dreamed,? said Jack, slowly. "It will be wonderful to climb up
past the stars. We must find the Escalator Beam, David, we
must! O, Lob, do tell us if it?s very far away now,? he pleaded.
Lob looked at both boys, the corners of his soft brown eyes
crinkling in a smile. He shook his head.
"I?ll be with the rabbits this afternoon. You?d better
come,? was all he said.


LOB'S ISLAND
Jack and David saw he would tell them no more, and Jack
looked quite cross for a moment. Then he brightened.
"The rabbits, David,? he explained. "Lob looks after the
baby ones while their mothers and fathers go out. They?re
lovely ?all brown and soft!?
"I?ll have to tell the pot what we want for tea,? said Lob.
"What would you like?? he asked David. "It?s a magic pot,?
Jack explained again. "It?ll cook whatever you like.?
David stared at the pot ?it looked like any other pot, and
did not seem to be a magic one. Then he thought hard. "I
think I?d like sausages,? he said, slowly. "Oh, I hoped you?d
say that!? Jack cried joyfully.
Lob grinned ?he looked as though he liked sausages, too.
Then he went over to the pot, and ordered "Sausages for
tea!?
The pot seemed to shake, and the chains which held it
above the fire clinked, but it said nothing, and Lob walked out
the door, followed by the boys.
The hens pecking about the door lifted their heads and
clucked together.
"Clother boy is David. Cluck, dud. Clocking for Cles-
calator Beam, cluck, cluck, cluck.? They went on pecking and
walked away from Lob and the boys.
The cow and her calf looked up too, and the cow chewed
slowly from side to side, while she switched her tail, but neither
of them said anything.

Lob walked silently ahead, and they made their way
through trees until they came to a sunny space where the grass
was humped here and there by the tunnels of a rabbit warren.
Lob walked to the largest hump and stamped on it. At once
there was a sound of scurrying beneath, and a rabbit?s head
popped out of one of the holes of the warren.
"I?ll mind them this afternoon,? said Lob to the rabbit
"Squeak!? The rabbit waggled its ears with delight and
disappeared.
There were more underground rustlings and scurryings,
and then a whole procession of rabbits came out. There were
numbers of grown-ups, with smooth, shining coats, and many
more baby ones fluffy and bright-eyed, their little white cotton
tails held up gaily. All of them, grown-ups and babies, sur-
rounded Lob, jostling and squeaking together, and some of


LOB'S ISLAND
them came to the boys, who picked up the littlest, softest ones
and cuddled them.
?Til stay till sundown," said Lob to the rabbits who frisked
about while the mothers whispered in the young ones? ears, tell-
ing them to mind their manners and be good while they were
left in Lob?s care. Then all the grown-up rabbits scampered
away through the trees, leaving the young ones playing and
tumbling around the legs of Lob and the boys.
It was warm in the sun, and some of the littlest ones were
soon tired and sleepy with their play. Lob and the boys carried
them over to the shade of a big oak tree, and there the boys lay
flat on their backs gazing up at the blue patches of the sky
through the young green leaves. The rabbits played over them,
or nestled sleepily against their sides.
In the still silence David was sure he could hear faint music
far away. It was so far away that he wondered if he were
dreaming. He looked at Jack and saw that he was listening,
too.
"Lob,?? whispered Jack, as David looked at him. "Is that
fairy music???
Lob smiled. "Yes, I wondered if you would hear it. It
was quite loud just then.??
Loud!?? said David, "But it was so far away I wasn?t sure if
I really heard it.??
"That is because you are a mortal,?? Lob answered. "Fairies
hear it all the time, but as I expect Swiftwings has told you, very


few mortals ever do hear it. That?s because they won?t learn to
listen.?? He shook his head. "Mortals are very foolish.??
David listened and listened as hard as he could, but the far-
away music became fainter and fainter. Then there was silence.
It was gone.
The baby rabbits moved closer to him, wrinkling their
little noses as they sniffed the warm grass.
"Do hares have burrows too??? he asked, thinking of the
little hare whose leg they had helped to mend.
"No,? said Lob, "they?re strange creatures. They live in
the open, and teach their young ones to hide amongst the
grasses. They?re hard to see when they?re against the same
colour as themselves, and that?s how they often escape danger.?
It was quite a long speech for Lob, and it seemed to start
him talking, for he began to tell the boys of the wild things of
the English countryside: hedgehogs and badgers, and the fierce
otters who live in the rivers; foxes who worry the farmer?s
chickens and love a fat duck or goose for their dinners; the little
red squirrels who chatter happily in the trees in autumn while
they gather nuts to keep for the winter.
He told them of the birds thrushes and blackbirds,
robins and chaffinches and how they nest and bring up their
families in the springtime, when the hawthorn hedges are white
against the blueness of May skies and the snowy drifts of apple
blossom begin to scatter their petals.
His soft voice was full of sadness, for although his island


LOB?S ISLAND
was very like England, he could not wander here as he had done
at home.
Then the boys drew closer, stirring the sleepy little rabbits,
for he began to tell them tales of the English fairies ?how Queen
Mab watched over the countryside, and how Puck played pranks
on mortals who did not believe in his existence. He made them
laugh when he told the way this merry fairy changed himself
into different animals so that he frightened the farmers, and how
when travellers were on the road at night he would pounce
and give them the fright of their lives but do them no harm.
Lob sighed. "But there are not many in England now who
have the eyes to see Puck, though he?s there yet.?
He stroked the four little rabbits who had managed to
creep into his lap, and the boys waited, hoping he would tell
them more stories. He went on, his voice soft and murmuring,
and now he told them of the little green men, the fairies of his
own North Country; and he smiled when he spoke of some of
his own adventures ?how, unseen, he had helped farmers gather
in their crops before the rain fell, and how, when he lay before
the fire at night, a dairymaid had found him and run screaming
to wake the house with the story that there was a great bear by
the fire.
He told them, too, of the crocks of fairy gold which have
sometimes been found by mortals, but which change to hand-
fuls of dead leaves over night.
There was a sleepy silence for a little while, and then Jack


asked, "What is Fairyland really like, Lob?? Lob smiled rather
sadly.
"I have never been there. lam an earth-bound fairy and
my work is here, but I have heard others speak of it often
enough.?
"Oh, please tell us about it,? urged David.
"Well,? said Lob, "it is the loveliest garden you could ever
imagine, with every flower you have ever seen on earth, and
many more that are not yet on earth. In one part of the garden
it is always springtime; in another it is warm summer; while red
and yellow leaves fall in the garden of autumn. But the part
you will see first is the Winter Garden, for it is the nearest to
the Escalator Beam.?
"But where are the fairies, and what do they do?? asked
Jack.
"They are all there working. Only the very best and
cleverest fairies live on the Crystal Sphere, and they only go there
after they have worked for hundreds and hundreds of years on
Earth....?
"But what do they do?? cried Jack, before he could finish
speaking. Lob smiled at the two eager faces.
"Why, what should they do but make new flowers and
trees, and find better ways for the birds to build their nests? The
fairies on earth learn to care for each flower, and how to paint
the leaves in autumn. In winter they outline each leaf with frost,
and in cold countries hang icicles on the trees. After many


LOB?S ISLAND
years the cleverest ones go to work in the gardens of the Crystal
Sphere. There they try to find new and better ways of doing
their work.?
"Oh!? gasped David. "My mother was given a new rose
once ?a goldy pink one. She said it was the first one like it
that had ever flowered. Did the fairies find the way to make
that in Fairyland??
"Of course they did,? said Lob. "The rose fairies are
always very busy, but the most wonderful person in Fairyland
is Fairy Mother.?
"Fairy Mother . . .?? the boys asked.
"Yes,? said Lob. "I suppose you have never seen her, but
she often visits the Earth, and when any children are frightened
or in pain she tries to help them. They may not know she is
there, but sometimes they are comforted.?
"What is she like?? asked David, wondering if perhaps
she had been very close to him when he had been ill.
"She is ... she is ... well, she is like no one or nothing else
but herself,? said Lob, slowly, seeking words.
"She is as old as the earth itself, and yet as young as the
dawn; calm as new fields of snow, and lovelier than moonlight.
Her hair is a cloud, and her eyes are starry, and she is clothed in
the blue mists of distance.?
He paused, and then went on
"She cares for all the fairies. I have only seen her twice.


The last time was when I left England years and years ago.
She is invisible when she visits the earth, and so the only chance
a mortal child has to see her is to visit Fairyland."
"Are we sure to see her, Lob, if we find Fairyland?" asked
David.
"Yes, surely," said Lob. "She lives in her Crystal Castle in
the Winter Garden. Its towers rise in the distance when you
reach the top of the Escalator Beam."
"O, Lob, do you think we shall find it, do you?" cried Jack.
But just then there was a scampering and a squeaking and
the older rabbits came back. Lob pushed the sleepy babies
from his knees and stood up stretching. The sun was low in
the sky and the shadows were lengthening. He looked towards
the sunset and seemed to forget the boys for a moment.
"Better milk now," he said.
The boys stood up too, and the young rabbits all began to
wake and run scampering to their parents, frisking around them,
their little white tails bobbing up and down.
The older rabbits crowded round Lob, rubbing themselves
against his trousers, and in their funny little voices they thanked
him for caring for their children. Lob tickled the ears of those
closest to him and then, followed by the boys, set off back to the
tree-house.
"Where?s Swiftwings?" asked David, for he missed the
fairy who had been his guard and guide until now.


LOB?S ISLAND
"He?ll be with you to-morrow morning," said Lob.
"You?ll be travelling again then."
"Where do we go next?" asked both boys together.
Lob smiled at their eagerness. "You?ll be going through
ice and snow. It?s the last part of the journey, and the hardest,
so you?ll have to sleep well to-night." "The end of the journey!
Oh, do we find the Escalator Beam then?" cried David.
"Yes, you will if the moonlight is clear enough, and if you
can struggle through the snow and cold," answered Lob. The
boys were filled with excitement surely, after coming so far,
they would find Fairyland now, no matter how hard the end of
the journey. They were too excited to walk, and ran ahead
until they reached the tree-house.
The brown and white cow and her calf were waiting by the
door, but the hens had disappeared. There was a little row of
white eggs which they had left lying neatly across the doorway.
Lob picked them up as he went in and, in a moment, came out
with a wooden bucket and one of the green stools. He sat
down and milked the cow while the boys looked on.
The little calf pushed against Jack and mooed, "Scratch
me." So Jack rubbed his hard head where one day the two
strong horns would grow. The cow chewed in silence until the
milking was done, then, followed by the calf, she made off into
a place among the trees where the trunks grew close together,
and the branches were twined into a roof overhead.
Lob picked up the bucket of milk and they all went inside.


The magic pot had not forgotten the sausages and they
were ready cooked, so they had them for tea, washed down with
fresh milk which they drank out of wooden cups.
It grew dark inside the tree-house, and David looked
about for a light, or a candle, but there seemed to be none.
"We go to bed now ?you can have the top bunk. I had
it before you came," said Jack.
David went over to the bunks and climbed to the top one,
using the other two as steps. Then he found that beneath the
patchwork quilt was a soft, creamy white pillow; when he felt it
he discovered that it was made of thistledown pressed together.
He looked more closely at the quilt, for he could smell a faint
and lovely fragrance of flowers, and he found that the whole
quilt was formed by flower petals. The petals of roses and prim-
roses, violets and bluebells, and every flower he had ever seen,
were all there sewn together with silvery cobweb.
He called excitedly to Jack, wondering if all the quilts were
the same. Jack climbed up beside him, and explained that Lob,
with his big rough fingers, had stitched the lovely quilts and the
soft pillows.
"They?re as warm as three blankets would be," said Jack.
Lob heard the voices and told the two boys to hurry and
go to sleep. He had curled up in his favourite place by the
fire. Jack went back to his own bunk, while David pulled the
scented quilt up to his chin and found that its warm softness
and the scent of the flowers made him sleepy almost at once.
"Good-night, Jack; good-night, Lob," he murmured, and


LOB?S ISLAND
was answered by sleepy grunts. His last waking sight was of
Lob-lie-by-the-fire, curled like a big dog in front of the fireplace.
The boys wakened early next morning and found Lob had
their breakfast of eggs and milk ready for them. While they
were having it Swiftwings came in, and at once they asked where
he had been all the day before. He smiled mysteriously, but
only shook his head in answer.
Jack and David hurried over their breakfast, eager for the
day?s adventure. As soon as they had finished, Swiftwings
hurried them outside, saying?
"You?ll have to say good-bye to Lob now; we must be
going.?
Lob was standing in the doorway. He smiled and shook
their hands, wishing them a good journey. The boys were
sorrowful at leaving him, and asked if they could come back
one day.
"Yes, of course you will,? he answered. "You will come
and visit me on your way home from Fairyland, but you must
find the Escalator Beam first.?
He waved good-bye as they followed Swiftwings, and they
waved back.
It was still early enough for the dew to be on every leaf and
cobweb. The slanting sunlight lit the crystal drops so that
every blade of grass glittered in the coolness of the morning.
The damp black earth smelt good to them as they brushed
through the trees.
Suddenly Swiftwings turned down a winding path. The


boys had not seen it before, though they had come the same way
with Lob when they went to mind the baby rabbits. Now it
stretched before them, disappearing through the darkness of the
straight tree trunks. A winding path always seems more excit-
ing than a straight one. As they looked ahead a little red fox
poked his head around the first bend, barked sharply, and
vanished. This was enough for the boys. They raced off down
the path past Swiftwings, but the little fox was gone when they
came to the place where he had been.
Swiftwings flew after them so fast that he seemed to pass
through the air like a flash of light.
"Don?t do that!? he said sternly, as he landed on the path
ahead of them. "You must stay close beside me all the
time if you want to find the Escalator Beam.? He smoothed
the folds of his wings and walked off ahead of them. He seemed
so angry that the boys were frightened and followed him
without a word. Their eyes were busy on either side of the
path. They did not see the little fox again, but they discovered
some fairy-rings. Sitting in the middle of one of them was a
big green frog, his yellowish sides moving in and out as he
breathed.
"Croak-day, David, croak-day, Jack,? he croaked. "Croak
luck to you both, and may you find the Coakescalator Beam.?
He hopped out of the ring, and back into the darkness of the
trees.
"Thank you,? said David and Jack, as they watched him


LOB'S ISLAND
hop slowly off; then, as Swiftwings turned around to see what
was delaying them, they hurried on.
"They all know who you are, and where you?re going,?
Swiftwings explained. "When any mortal children are lucky
enough to be taken to find the Escalator Beam, somehow or
other every fairy hears of it, and the birds and animals gossip
from one end of the world to the other.?
As if to mark his words, the voice of a thrush sounded
piercingly sweet from the topmost twig of a silver birch.
"A hap-hap-happy journey,? he trilled, his brown splotched
breast swelling with song and one bright eye cocked at them.
"Find the Moonbeam, find it, find it, find it,? called his
mate from a tree on the other side of the path as she held a twig
in her bill for the nest she was making.
"We will!? shouted David and Jack, their voices echoing
through the trees.
Before the path ended they were greeted by a rabbit
and a cheery robin, whose scarlet waistcoat flashed against the
darkness of the trees as he flew down to a branch, and stared at
them.
Soon there were fewer trees, and the air grew colder.
They heard the noise of the sea. Then it became so cold that
they turned their coat collars up to their ears. At last the
end of the path came in sight. It led down to a rocky beach
from which the wind was sweeping towards them.
"I?m afraid it?s going to be very cold,? said Swiftwings,
"and I can?t do anything about it until we find the Moonbeam.


I?m all right because I can?t feel the cold, but perhaps later, if I
spread my wings, it may help a little. Now, can either of you
see an ice-floe??
David and Jack looked around the dark blue water but
could see only the white waves, though such was the cold that
they were both thinking nothing smaller than an iceberg must
be near.
Swiftwings, who was looking another way, shouted sud-
denly, "There it is!? He set off down the beach, the boys
scrambling after him through the rocks, and there, sure enough,
was a big flat piece of ice, an ice-floe the size of a small boat,
with a mast in the middle and a big white sail flapping in the
icy wind.
"Jump on!? shouted Swiftwings above the noise of the
wind and crashing waves as he held the floe against the rocks.
The boys jumped and he came after them. The floe rocked
away from the shore. The wind caught the sail, and they were
soon moving before it through the waves.

They wheeled . . . and set off back the way they had come
their little black shadows travelling beside them

The End of the Journey
If the boys had been cold before, they were nearly frozen
now, for they were standing on ice, but Swiftwings stood
between them and the wind and spread his wings to shelter
them a little.
They were alone in an emptiness of wind and water, but
far ahead there was a misty whiteness and the fairy told them
that the white fields of snow lay there.
"It is winter now, in the Antarctic, and there is no daylight
?only a dim twilight in the middle of the day. We have to
travel a long way over the snow before we find the Escalator
Beam, but the penguin people will help us some of the way.?
"Will it be much colder?? asked Jack, his teeth chattering
and the tip of his nose purple. "A little,? smiled Swiftwings,
D CC


spreading his wings further out, "but when you?re walking and
running you won?t notice it so much.?
There seemed to be nothing living on the water, but high
above their heads sea-birds called as they glided on the wind.
David asked Swiftwings if there were more Caverns of
Coral beneath the water they were sailing on, but the fairy told
him it was too cold here for the mermaids.
The pale sunlight was fading fast and soon there was only
twilight, but the wind drove the floe-boat swiftly across the
water until the whiteness that they had just been able to see in


the distance shone clearly across the waves, and they could see it
was a great field of snow. There were other ice-floes about them,
and far off in the twilight a glittering whiteness which
Swiftwings pointed out and told them was an iceberg. Soon
the ice-fioes were so thickly scattered in the water that it was
difficult not to bump them, but Swiftwings pushed away those
that were too close, and at last they reached the borders of the
snow safely.
They all sprang off the floe on to the land, and though the
boys had thought it was impossible to be colder than they had
been before, they soon found they were mistaken, for the wind
came sweeping across the snow and seemed to pierce them with
arrows of cold. They stood shivering, and Jack, in a very small
voice which was almost snatched away by the wind, asked if they
had far to walk.
"No,? said Swiftwings. He looked at them for a moment
and then looked away, shading his eyes to stare into the dis-
tance. "From now on,? he said, "you must be more careful
than ever to stay as close to me as you can. There are Snow
Spirits here, wicked spirits, who will harm you if they can. If
you stay with me you are safe, because I am much more power-
ful than they are, but if you wander far from me they may carry
you away. If they capture you, they will hold you in the snow
until you are frozen.?
While he spoke David and Jack looked about them, afraid


they might see the wicked spirits, but there was nothing but
white emptiness as far as their eyes could see.
?'Listen!? said Swiftwings, as they looked, "can you hear
anything??
The boys listened, thinking they might hear the fairy music
again, but, instead, faintly on the wind they heard the tinkling
of little bells.
"It?s the Penguin Sled,? said Swiftwings. "The Penguins
will carry us over the snow to within reach of the Escalator
Beam. But only two of us can ride in the sled at one time, for
three would be too heavy. The other one has to walk behind,
and it?s a good thing, too, it will keep you warm.?
The tinkling grew louder, and soon in the fading light the
Penguin Sled came into sight over a little hill of snow. There
was a long line of twenty penguins harnessed two by two to a
little red sled, and they had tiny brass bells on their harness
which jingled and tinkled musically as the sled moved
forward. The penguins stopped by sitting back on their short
legs at a squawk of command from one of their leaders, and the
sled drew up in a whirl of snow. They stared at the two boys
with their beady little eyes, and at last the same one who had
given the squawk of command said to Swiftwings in a queer,
harsh voice?
"Three can?t ride in the sled ?we?re not dogs to pull such
a load!? He looked at them, shaking his head as he spoke.


''Don?t worry,? Swiftwings said. "David and Jack are
going to take it in turns to walk behind. It will keep them
warm. You did bring snow shoes, didn?t you??
"Yes,? squawked the leader, "they?re in the sled. That?s
all right then. We?d better set off at once. Climb in!?
He jerked his flipper back towards the sled with a move
ment which set all the little bells tinkling.
"Come on, Jack!? said Swiftwings. "David can walk first.
His nose looks bluer than yours, so I expect he must be colder.?
Jack and he stepped into the sled, and pulled the white, furry
rug which lay there up to their chins.
Swiftwings picked up a pair of snow-shoes from under the
rug and handed them to David. They looked just like tennis
rackets, except that they had straps to hold them on. They
were red like the sled, and the straps were hung with little bells
like those on the penguins? harness.
David strapped on the queer shoes, and found they helped


to keep his feet from sinking in the snow. The penguins were
still staring as if they found him a very funny sight. Then the
leader squawked at him,
"Mind you keep up with us!?
He jerked his flipper again, and the little black and white
birds drew themselves to attention like tiny soldiers. Then,
with a jerk, they waddled forward together, pulling the sled
behind them. Soon they were moving quite fast, and David,
unused to snow-shoes, found it hard to keep up with them, but,
as the fairy had said, it made him much warmer in fact, he
was quite hot.
The snow was frosty beneath his feet and his breath froze
on the air and blew back behind him. He seemed to have
walked for miles and miles before Swiftwings told the penguins
to stop, and Jack strapped on the shoes and took his place
behind the sled while he climbed in and pulled the furry rug
closely about him.
As they travelled David and Jack stared about them, but
saw no Snow Spirits, and Swiftwings told them that if there
was no wind they might not see them at all. When it was
windy and the snow blew about, the spirits were much bolder,
for then they could creep close, hidden from sight by the
whirling snow.
The sled travelled for hours over the snow. The orange-
yellow moon hung in the sky, while the only sign of the sun


was a red glow in the north. They soon found that having to
tramp behind the sled, even though it kept them from being
frozen, made them very, very tired.
The glow of the hidden sun faded and the twilight became
moonlight. Swiftwings stopped the penguins, and said they
would have to halt for the night. David stepped stiffly out of
the sled (it had been his turn to ride) and all the little birds
slipped off their harness, the bells ringing sharply.
"Now you have to work harder still,? said Swiftwings.
"We have to build a snow house.?
Jack and David were so tired they hardly heard what he
said. Once they would have been excited at building a house
with snow, but now they were too tired to care.
"Come on, you must, you know, if you are to sleep
warmly to-night and travel to-morrow. You mustn?t give up
now when you are so near the end of the journey,? urged Swift-
wings.
He began to build a wall of snow, and the penguins helped,
pressing the snow together with their flippers. The boys began
to help too, and after they had been working for a while they
did not feel so tired. The snow house soon began to take
shape.
Under Swiftwing?s guidance they built it round like a bee-
hive, and from the outer doorway they made a tunnel of snow so
that the cold wind could not blow inside. It was a dear little


house when it was built, and the boys almost forget how tired
they were as they saw what they had made.
"Now,? said Swiftwings, "we?ll all go inside to sleep. I?m
sorry we haven?t anything to eat, but I?m afraid that you?ll have
to do without food until we reach the Crystal Sphere.?
He went through the tunnel into the little house, and they
crawled after him, followed by the long line of penguins pulling
their sled behind them. They all settled down in the middle of
the little house. Already the boys felt much warmer in the
snowy shelter, and, in spite of the strangeness of it, soon
drowsed off into sleep. They slept soundly through the Ant-
arctic night, while Swiftwings watched over them.
They were awakened the next day by the squawking of the
penguins, and at once they both felt very, very hungry. They
stood up, rubbing the sleep from their eyes and shaking the
snow from off their clothes.
David crawled out through the tunnel first and stood up
outside looking about him. Just for a moment he had for-
gotten Swift wing?s warning about the Snow Spirits. As he
stood there in the stillness a little wind blew around the Snow
House, and then suddenly the snow was blown around him
higher and higher. Sharp hands caught him and he was
whirled away and away into the white distance.
Faintly he heard Jack?s frightened cry
"David, David! Oh, David!?


f^laeitS&jJitlltt k?&: ?i 1 -


He could not see, for the snow had blown into his eyes;
and he could not cry out, for he was whirling so fast that he was
breathless. The cold hands of the Snow Spirits held him
prisoner. Then, all at once, the whirling snow flakes fell to
the ground again and the wind died away. The Snow Spirits
pulled him into the snow and held him fast.
For the first time he was able to open his eyes. He was so
frightened that he kept them tightly shut for a moment, for he
thought the wicked Spirits would be horrible to see, but at last
he opened them slowly. The Spirits were crowded about him.
They were the strangest creatures, for they seemed to be made
of pieces of glass of all shapes and sizes. Some had bodies cut
in square shapes, and others were round or long and thin. David
could see the snow on the other side by looking through their
clear bodies. They pinched him with sharp fingers; some
grinned and danced with strange stiff movements of their arms
and legs. Four or five were holding him in the snow, and
others threw snow at him and laughed and laughed, and their
laughter was like the sound of breaking glass.
David had never been so frightened. In the Sea-weed
Forest he had at least had Swiftwings close by him, but now he
was quite alone, and he knew from the fairy?s warning that he
was in great danger. He began to cry, the sobs catching his
throat and choking him as he lay flat on the ground. The tears
froze on his eyelashes, so that they were glued to his cheeks and
he could not open his eyes. He began to feel strangely sleepy.


The cruel laughter of the Snow Spirits seemed farther and
farther away ... farther and farther . . .
He lay very still. There was no need now for the Spirits to
hold him. They laughed, joining hands and dancing around
him.
All at once a black and white and red whirlwind crashed
through the circle of dancing spirits. Some of them broke in
pieces and fell to the ground. The rest scattered in all direc-
tions. It was the Penguin Sled, and surely no penguins had
ever run so fast before.
Swiftwings had not been able to leave Jack and fly to David
for fear other Snow Spirits would carry him off too, so he had
had to follow David and the Spirits in the sled. He was just in
time. He touched David?s eyelashes gently and the frozen tears
melted away. He rubbed his hands and Jack rubbed his feet,
and slowly the warmth came back to them. David opened his
eyes. Swiftwings was frowning.
"I?m sorry, very, very sorry, Swiftwings,?? said David, his
lips still stiff with cold.
Swiftwings smiled. "I don?t think you?ll forget again,
he said. "Can you stand up now???
David tried and found that with Jack?s help he could. He
walked a few steps. Swiftwings nodded.
"You?ll be all right now. We must move on.?? He
turned to the Penguins. Now the danger was past, the penguins


were very cross indeed. They had had to run faster than they
had ever run before, and they were tired. They grumbled and
squawked, and flapped each other with their flippers with a
great jingling and tinkling of bells.
Swiftwings stamped his little silver foot in the snow. The
penguins stopped grumbling. They looked at him with their
heads on one side.
"We must find the Escalator Beam to-night, and you must
help us," said Swiftwings firmly. "Are you ready?"
"Yes!" squawked the leader, and there was no more
grumbling. David and Swiftwings stepped into the sled, and
they set off with Jack walking behind over the frosty snow.
Now that he was not so cold, David remembered that he
was very hungry, and Jack remembered too.
As the day went on they felt they were travelling in a dream,
and began to wonder if they would ever reach the Escalator
Beam. Even the penguins were quiet and did not squawk
noisily as they had the day before. The boys stumbled as they
walked, and it was only Swiftwings? quiet voice which steadied
them.
Slowly the red glow from the sun travelled around the sky
and faded, till the moon and stars were left alone to light the
white fields of snow. At a command from Swiftwings the
penguins halted. Jack and Swiftwings stepped from the sled,
and the penguins sank down wearily in the snow. They seemed
as tired as the boys.


"Thank you all very much,? said Swiftwings. 'Tm sorry
it has been such a long journey. I know you?ll all be very tired
before you reach the ocean again.?
David and Jack had flopped down in the snow too, but
they thanked the penguins, and the little birds straightened up
proudly with a brisk jingling of their harness.
"It has been a pleasure,? squawked the leader. "We hope
you can find the Escalator Beam safely now.?
"Yes, we do,? squawked all the others together.
"I think it should be easy,? said Swiftwings. "The wind
has fallen, and the moon will be clear from clouds. We shall
wait here. Good-bye, and thank you again.?
At the squawk of the leader the penguins jumped to atten-
tion, their bells tinkling sharply. Then they wheeled, their
tiredness forgotten, and set off back the way they had come,
their little black shadows travelling beside them.
"Good-bye, good-bye,? called the boys over the snow, as
the small black and white figures with their gay little sled dis-
appeared into the white, moonlit distance.
The two boys began to feel very lonely as well as tired and
hungry. In all that whiteness there was no one but the three
of them, and no shelter. The Snow Spirits seemed to have been
quite frightened away. They drew closer to Swiftwings for
comfort. He seemed to know what they were feeling, and set
them to work building a bank of snow which they could rest
against.


When they had done this they sat close together for
warmth. The boys were so tired that, even though the end of
their search was so near, they drowsed off into a light sleep.
Swiftwings had spread his wings to give them more
shelter. Now he waited, watching and listening, while the
moonlight brightened and the stars were pinned like diamonds
in the black velvet of the sky.
The boys slept on, but presently Swiftwings shook them
awake, and they rubbed their eyes to open them on the black
and silver world. The stars seemed so close that David put his
hand up to touch one, only to find he had clutched the empti-
ness of the frosty, clear air. Above them the moon sailed in the
sky, her beams silvering the snow.
"Listen!? whispered Swiftwings. "Listen!? The boys
listened. It was not tinkling sleigh bells they heard now, but
the music which all his life David had longed to hear; the music
he had almost heard many times when he was playing alone in
still, golden summer twilights, or watching the cold, starlit
blackness of winter nights when he looked out through an
uncurtained window.
The fairy music stole over the snow, magically clear, and
crystal; so lovely that it made his heart ache with its sadness, for
it told of all the sorrows of the world.
Yet, though the tears were wet on his cheeks, he knew that
he would never feel hungry, or tired, or afraid again. Slowly he
rose to his feet, and Jack stood by him silent with wonder. He


caught Jack?s hand and held it fast while they turned to look at
each other, speechless with happiness.
"You have found it, you lucky children," said Swiftwings,
softly. "The stairway to Fairyland is just behind you."
They turned, still slow with wonder, and there was a great
moonbeam with a moving crystal staircase on it. It was the
Escalator Beam.
The boys looked upwards, almost blinded by the light, and
saw that far up in the heavens the beam brightened so that the
whole sky was alight. The music sounded louder and louder as
Swiftwings led them forward to the moving staircase. As their
feet touched the first step they felt warmth and strength stealing
through them again, and they followed the fairy steadily step by
crystal step, the music of the spheres around them.
Higher and higher they climbed, and there was no wind,
only the still calmness of the moonlit air, and then David looked
down and found he was looking into his own little room, where
Swiftwings had come to him.
He thought he could almost see himself still lying ill in bed,
but he knew this could not be, for he felt the moving steps firm
beneath his feet, and he climbed on with Jack beside him.
He looked back again when they had gone ten more steps,
and now he could see the whole world beneath, the land and
sea clearly marked.
The music rose and rose, higher and higher, till it seemed
to shake the stars as they moved past. Then the light that had


looked so far away when they had first begun to climb was all
about them, glowing and warm. At last they reached the top
of the staircase, and Swiftwings took their hands. There in the
distance were the frosty towers of the Crystal Castle. They had
found Fairyland.
Holland & Stephenson Pty. Ltd., Meagher St., Sydney




It is a perilous adventure to find
fairyland, and before be set out,
Da\id was warned of the difficulties
and dangers. But the sweet, crystal
fairy' music had called him and he
wanted to find fairyland more than
anything else in the world, so he
began the journey.
There is delight as well as danger
on the way for, with the fairy,
Swiftwings, he rides in the pouch
of a seven-league kangaroo, and on
the back of Popoff, the friendly
porpoise. He meets the fishes who
live in Australian waters?the John
Dories, Old Wives, and little sea-
horses. He meets, too, the lovely
green-haired mermaids of the great
Cavern of Coral, and learns how
shells are made.
On the fairy island where Lob-lie-
by-the-fire lives, another boy, Jack,
joins him, and they begin the hard-
est part of the journey. At last, in
the Antarctic snow's they find the
Escalator Beam?the moonbeam on
which the moving crystal steps lead
to fairyland. They climb the
crystal stainvay and find the far-
away land where the music of the
spheres sings beyond the stars.
