t( Is Saul also among the prophets f ? ?1 Samuel x. 11.
The various doctrinal discussions and scientific investigations of
our day have led men to make inquiries as to the authority of the
Bible, and to search for the true principles of scriptural inter-
pretation. In modern times many questions of an important nature
have been asked on this subject, and various answers have been
given to them. Some well-meaning, indeed, but unreflecting
persons have complained that these points should be examined at al ,
and that the faith of the multitude in the divine origin and plenary
inspiration of the whole Bible should be in any way disturbed.
Those who have brought to the consideration of the matter their
most earnest thought, much study and learning, and who have
seated candidty and boldly their disagreement with some of the
popular views, have been charged with pride of reason and with
rejecting God?s word. But such charges are as devoid of truth as
of charity. The Biblical critics who have given up a belief in some
things connected with the Bible, formerly universally accepted by
Christians, have done so, because historical facts and scientific
truths have compelled them, as honest men, to reject them. They
felt themselves forced by astronomical and geological discoveries to
direct their attention to some grave and perplexing inquiries. ? The
character and composition of the Bible as a whole, the nature of its
contents ; its age, sources, and authors ; its natural and its super-
natural ; its historical, prophetic and spiritual element ; its relations
to other literature, and to the demonstrative and physical sciences;
its exposure to assaults upon its credibility and its means and
methods of defence ; ?all these large and perplexing themes present
themselves for treatment by the aid of such powers as belong to
the human mind under the guidance of a various and progressive
culture.? And when the subject is fully entered upon the meanings
of words in the ancient languages and even in our own, the import
of idioms, orientalisms, and figures of speech must be noticed, and
explained if possible. Above all is the great question of Inspiration,
i the meaning of the W?ord, the evidence of the thing. ]Now, there
are three courses open to those whose duty it is to search and
expound the Scriptures. They may themselves refuse to read or


listen to any statements at variance with the opinions of their
forefathers and their creeds, repeat the ancient set phrases, and
thus be ? blind leaders of the blind.? Others may give heed to the
results of critical and scientific inquiries, may make themselves
acquainted with those facts which contradict or seem to contradict
the popular views, and then exert all their ingenuity to force
certain statements in the Bible to agree with the ascertained
phenomena of science, or to endeavour to cast doubt on the
reliableness of those phenomena themselves. A third class consists
of those who believe that as all truth comes from God, investigation
of it in every one of its various branches, wherever practicable, is
not only a right but a duty. They lay their minds open for the
reception of truth, and they exert their intellectual faculties in the
search for it. They think that they are specially bound to do this
in theology, and receive the precept ? try the spirits whether they
are of God? as a religious obligation. "They refuse to deny any
proved thing, because it may clash with some of their pre-conceived
ideas, and prefer to alter their own views ; and to express
unpalatable notions and sentiments to others, rather than in
violation of truth, principle and conscience, to prophecy smooth
things and deceits for the sake of conciliating the unthinking, and
gaining the applause of prejudiced partisans. Such men, therefore,
study the Bible with all their intellectual vigor, as well as with
trustful hearts and reverential spirits. If they find that the
account of Creation in the book of Genesis is at variance with the
word of God written in the rocks, they conclude that a literal
description is not there given. If they find that the representations
of God?s character, His dealings with His creatures, and the moral
and spiritual motives presented to man are less elevated, impartial
and pure, in the Old Testament than in the New, they infer that
our Heavenly Father has ordained that religious ideas should be
progressive. If they read that ? sin entered into the world, and
death by sin,? and science assures them that physical death existed
ages belore the creation of man, they infer that an enlightened or
an inspired writer must have referred to moral death ; the
destruction of moral and spiritual life brought on by evil conduct;
and that to insist on attributing to man?s wickedness the intro-
duction into the world of the death of animals of all kinds, and on
maintaining that such an opinion is a cardinal doctrine of Scripture
is to charge the writers who make such assertions, with statements
contradicted by facts, the stubborn facts brought to light by the
experiments, the researches, and the patient inductions of the "most
studious, unprejudiced and able philosophers of our times.
Some may be over-awed by the denunciations which are levelled
against all free inquiry and bold speech on this subject, but how
many have been rendered sceptical, made distrustful of all religious
teaching, by the false and unreasonable representations concerning
the Bible, God only knows.

BISHOP COLENSO.


Now among? English people anything but the acceptance ot the
doctrine of the plenary inspiration of the Bible, and ol other
doctrines of a similar kind has been, until lately, regarded as not
only erroneous, but as irreverent and sinful. A most important
question has received from all parties less attention than it deseived.
What claims do we find the Bible or any part of it makes for itself,,
as to its authorship, origin, and authority ? What do its contents
teach us on these points ?
Dr. John William Colenso has directed his attention to this
matter, in relation to the Pentateuch, and has, by his writings,
greatly excited the religious world. Dr. Colenso has been
distinguished as a mathematician, and especially as an arithmetician.
His work on the Pentateuch is not his first theological publication,
nor the one in which he first shewed signs of being a free and
candid thinker. He published a commentary on the Epistle to the
Romans, before he entered upon an investigation of the Pentateuch.
And here he earnestly protests against the doctrine of the salvation
of only a few elect, and of the eternal misery of those who never heard
of the Gospel: and indeed.against the doctrine of eternal torments
altogether. He tells the anecdote of a heathen child, when
brought to believe in the Gospel, and to think that those who die
without believing it are everlastingly lost, asking with great
earnestness?Why did you not come and tell us before?? ?My
father,?she continues?died, and my mother died, and my brother
died without the Gospel.? Wiping her tears, she asks the
missionary ? Where do you think they have gone ?? He too weeps as
a man, but replies as an orthodox missionary speaking inhumanly
for God, ?where do you think they have gone ? She hesitates, and
then with deep emotion replies, ?I suppose they are gone down to
the dark place, the dark place. 0 why did you not tell us
before.? That was a sensitive heathen child. A fine heroic
heathen man asks the missionary who has expounded to him the
same narrow orthodoxies, ?Where, do you think my father is, and
then my mother, and my dear child, and all the ancestors of my
tribe ?? And receiving for an answer ?in the dark place, or in the
fiery place,? he retorts, ?Then I wish to go wherever they are, I
will not go to your heaven.?
These natural sentiments of the human heart thus expressed by
heathens had their due effect on the great manly head and heart of
Dr. Colenso; and so, in commenting on Romans viii., 19-23, ? Ihe
earnest longing of the creature (creation rather) is expecting the
revelations ot the sons ot God;? he says ?? From these passages
it appears plain that the expression is used for ? mankind, the
?whole human race,? ?humanity,? with especial reference to the
great mass of it, lying still in an unenlightened and degraded state,
but not excluding the few to whom the message of life had already
come. Thus then St. Paul here says?The earnest longing of
humanity is waiting for that day when the sons of God?the true-

hearted and faithful of every age and clime?those who, with the
light they had, whether with the starlight of nature only, or with
the brighter light as of a clouded noon, vouchsafed to the Jew, or
under the full, clear shining of the sun of righteousness, have,
imperfectly indeed, at the best, in every case, because of the weak-
ness of the flesh, yet with sincerity and with singleness of heart
and purpose, each according to his gift, ?persevered in well-doing?
?when these ? shall be revealed, shall he disclosed to the eves of
of all, shall he crowned with glory, honor, and immortality,?
and he called to enter into the joy of the Lord. The whole
of humanity is looking for this day, when every life of faith-
fulness on earth shall receive its reward, a reward not of debt but
of grace, when wickedness shall cease to triumph, and lives of
unrepented sin and wilful disobedience, of fraud, injustice, oppres-
sion, cruelty, impurity, shall have their just meed of retribution.
But this chastisement, after all, comes from a Father?s hand
upon those who may be wilful, prodigal, unruly, disobedient, but
yet are creatures whom He Himself has redeemed, for whom
Christ died. Can we say with these words of St. Paul before us
(Rom. v,, 21), that such chastisement, however severe, may not be
remedial, may not be be intended to work out ? the hope,? under
which the whole race has been ?subjected to vanity,? which ?hope,?
in the Apostle?s mind, is the justification of the eternal justice and
love in so subjecting it, when it had not deserved such a fate, nor
brought it about of its own accord by any act of its own ? Is
there not ground from this text, as well as others, for trusting that
in some way unknown to us the whole race shall indeed be made
to share this hope at last, and so be ? set free from the bondage of
corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of
God.??
Bishop Colenso tells us that he did not come to this conclusion
quickly. * I did believe?, he says ?in that dogma (the endlessness of
future punishments) at the time I wrote and printed those sermons
(alluding to some discourses printed by him before he became
celebrated) so far as that can be called belief.\ which, in fact, was no
more than acquiescence, in common, I imagine, with very many of
my brother clergy, in the ordinary statements of the subject, with-
out having ever deeply studied the question, probably with a
shrinking dread of examining it, and without having ever ventured
formally to write or preach a sermon upon the subject, and pursue
it in thought and word to all its consequences. There are many
who, as I did myself in those days, would assert the dogma as par 1 ;
of their creed, and now and then in a single sentence ot a sermon
utter a few words in accordance with it, but who have never
set themselves down to face the question, and deliver their own
souls upon it to their flocks fully and unreservedly. For my own
part I admit I acquiesced in it, seeing some reasons for assuming it
to be true, knowing that the mass of my clerical brethren assented to
6

it with myself, and contenting; myself with making; some reference
to it now and then in ray ministrations, without caring- to dwell
deliberately upon it, and considering- what might be urged against
it.
1 The controversy which arose about Mr, Maurice?s Essays and
my own little volume of sermons, brought the whole subject
closely before me. And for the last seven years I have carefully
studied it, with an earnest desire to know the truth of God upon
the matter, and with an humble prayer lor the guidance and
teaching of His Holy Spirit in search for it. I now declare that
I can no longer maintain or give utterance to the doctrine of the
endlessness of ? future punishment,? that I dare not dogmatise at all
on this matter ?that I can only lay my hand on my mou f h and leave
it in the hands of a righteous and merciful Judge. But I see that the
word ?eternal? does not mean ?endless.? And for such reasons as
the following I entertain the ?hidden hope? that there are remedial
processes when this life is ended, of which at present we know
nothing, but which the Lord, the Righteous Judge, will administer
as He in His wisdom shall see to be good.?
The reasons which Dr. Colenso has for rejecting this doctrine are
such as are familiar to those who attend the services of this Church.
There is nothing either new or remarkable in them; but there is
something new, remarkable, and instructive in a bishop bearing this
testimony against such a doctrine as that of eternal torment. He
does it, indeed, very mildly. He is a gentle man, and his position
would lead him to speak of a doctrine believed in by the majority of
his co-religionists (fellow-churchmen) with a reference to their
feelings. I confess that my feelings lead me to a very different
course. I regard the statement that a good and merciful God
could create myriads of rational beings, foreknowing and
Prearranging that they should be tortured in hell for ever, as one
blasphemously irreverent towards God?s character, utterly at variance
with the spirit of Christ?s teaching; and I hesitate not to say, that
any system of religion which would inculcate it, would, in my
estimation, stand self-condemned for its innate absurdity and
inconsistency. In short, no language I could use could overstate
my horror of such a doctrine !
Again, in his commentary on the Romans, Bishop Colenso points
out that it is not said that Christ died in our stead, but on our behalf.
These are his own words : ?? Once for all let it be stated distinctly,
there is not a single passage in the whole of the New Testament,
which supports the dogma of modern theology, that our Lord died
for our sins in the sense of dying instead of us, dying in our place,
or dying so as to bear the punishment or penalty of our sins. It is
often said that He died for us; He died for our sins; but the Greek
preposition, here rendered by ?for? (chap, v., 6,) never, in any single
instance, means in our stead, but ?on our behalf? as in this
passage.?

BISHOP COLENSO.


I have dwelt longer on these points than I otherwise should have
done, had I not known that many who have read Dr. Colenso?s
works on the Pentateuch may not have become acquainted with
the liberal, rational sentiments he expresses in his commentary on
Romans.
We come now to his most notorious publications. The way in
which he was brought to examine the authority of the Pentateuch,
the meaning of it, and the other questions?as to its authorship and
the like?is well known. While translating the story of the Flood,
he had some puzzling questions put to him by a simple-minded, but
intelligent native??one with the docility of a child, but the
reasoning powers of mature age ;? ?and on the orthodox view of
the Pentateuch, he could not answer them satisfactorily. What
then was he to do? Now, we all know what an uncandid, disin-
genuous man would have done under the circumstances?one who
puts himself in the attitude of an advocate for his creed, as a paid
barrister might do for his client. He would have quibbled, used all
the casuistry he was master of, and if all this failed, he would have
ended by denouncing the Zulu as an ignorant, thick-headed
heathen, without reason to perceive the force of an argument, or
grace to feel the power of divine truth. But Bishop Colenso says,
?My heart answered in the words of the prophet, ?Shall a man
speak lies in the name of the Lord He consequently set about a
critical examination of the Pentateuch, and the result has been a
wide departure from the popular views as to the authorship and
authority of the books. Now, let me say that in one lecture I
cannot pretend to go even into a cursory examination of all Dr,
Colenso?s arguments. He does not think that Moses is the author
of all the so-called ?books of Moses.? He thinks they are the
product or collections of a later age than that of the great lawgiver.
Now, all intelligent persons must agree with him that Moses did
not write the account of his own death, and if we merely suppose
that those are books about Moses, and not all by Moses, one difficulty
is got rid of. J
Dr. Colenso is a great arithmetician. He takes exception to the
numbers of people spoken of in Genesis, as Professor Norton and
Dean Milman did before him, and the outcry that is on this matter
made against Dr. Colenso, reminds one of the familiar proverb, ?one
man may steal a borse while another must not look through the
hedge.? In his history of the Jews, Dean Milman states that
?perhaps two-thirds of the difficulties and discrepancies which occur
in the Hebrew Scriptures, are found in passages which relate to
numbers ,? and says, ?lf we might suppose that a cipher has been
added in the total sura and throughout the several particulars, or if
we might include men, women, and children under the 600,000
(said to be fighting men, of the Israelites in the desert), the history
would gain in our opinion, both in clearness and consistency.? I
will place before you but one case in which Colenso finds fault with
8
BISHOP COLENSO.


a statement in the Pentateuch, in which numbers are involved, and
the way in which the ablest supporters of the old opinion reply to
him. In Lev. viii, I?4, it is thus written??And Jehovah spake
unto Moses, saying, gather thou all the congregation together at,
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Moses did as
Jehovah commanded. And the assembly was gathered unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation,? JNow Bishop Colenso shows
that according to the numbers given of the children of Israel, they
could not have obeyed this order, for that the ?congregation? would
have reached twenty miles, and could not have heard the law read
to them, according to the account. The answer given to this is
that probably all the children of Israel did not obey the summons;
or that ?elders,? or captains of hundreds and thousands, might have
been the commissioned representatives of the rest. Dr. Colenso
says even the cries of the babies in arms in an assembly ?as large as
the population of London would have drowned the voice of any
speaker.? But it is argued on the other hand, that perhaps there
were no infants there. The word ?all? it is urged, should be taken
in a limited sense. That is said in this case by men, who would
be very unwilling to admit any such limitation when there ate
phrases seeming to imply all power as belonging to Jesus Christ.
It is indeed a matter, of fact, that the word all is used popularly
very vaguely. ?All the world knows that, 1 eter the Heimit
precipitated all Europe on Asia,? says one historian, ? All London
flocked forth in a paroxysm of returning loyalty,? says another.
Thus Macaulay, speaking of the restoration of Charles 11., says,
?The journey to London was a continued triumph. The whole
ToadJrom Rochester was bordered by booths and tents, and looked
like an interminable fair, everywhere flags were flying, bells and
music sounding, wine and ale flowing in rivers to the health
of him whose return was the return of peace, of law, and of
freedom.?
We can accept this explanation that the language of the Penta-
teuch is loose and vague ; ?we can accept the explanation with
regard to geology and astronomy, that the writer or writers of the
Pentateuch did not know the results of late scientific investigations ;
that they believed the world was made in six literal days, or that
even they meant periods by the word days; that they supposed
the sun did literally stand still; and that they recorded what they
believed, ?that which they may have witnessed and explained to
the best of their ability themselves, or may have received from
earlier records or traditions; but we could not receive this as any
proper explanation whatever of these statements if we supposed
them to have been made by God himself; or all of them to have
been recorded under his miraculous guidance.
My own objections, indeed, utterly independent of numerical or
physical difficulties to the reception of the Pentateuch asaplenarily
inspired revelation of the will of God would be on moral grounds.
9
BISHOP COLENSO.


I have too much reverence for my Creator to believe for one
moment that he could act in the way which he is there sometimes
described as doing-.
We are not to suppose when we read, thus saith the Lord?that the
Almighty literally spoke to men; but that prophets gave utterance,
to what in their opinion was the mind of Deity. I quote the
following passage from Dr. Davidson?s Introduction to the Old
Testament:??What is meant by God speaking, ?God spake all these
words? (Exod. xx., 1). To understand the language of the Old
Testament aright, it is necessary to recollect that it contains
a revelation in the general sense of that word, or an
uncovering of truth, the development of that truth by mind under
the influence of God?s spirit. It is a record of the growth of
human intelligence in relation to the Deity?of the revelation made
by spirit to spirit. When, therefore, God is described as speaking
to man, He does so in the only way in which He who is a
spirit can speak to one encompassed with flesh and blood, not to the
outward organs of sensation, but to that intelligence which is
kindred to Himself, the great Fountain of Knowledge. Thus it is
not to be supposed that the Eternal Being spake the Decalogue
audibly in the air, in articulate sounds, simply because the writer
says, ?God spake all these words saying??(Ex. xx.). In like manner
when he appeared to the patriarchs, called to them, addressed them
by name, commanded them to do certain things; or when His
angel appeared, which is only a different expression for Himself;
we must resolve the thing into a strong manifestation of the spiritual
consciousness in man.?
And I would add that when man has ever enunciated any sen-
timent as divine which is at variance with the eternal principles of
justice, mercy, and tenderness, we may be sure that is not a true
representation of the Spirit of that God who is love, the God and
Father of Jesus Christ. It is only right to state that the more
?conservative of Unitarians object to much that Bishop Colenso has
written about the Pentateuch, while a large number think that on
the whole he is right. A great deal indeed of what he brings
forward in his second volume about the signs of different authorships
in the book of Genesis, and about the Jehovistic and Elohistic
?writers was taught to me as first principles and well established
facts in Bibical criticism, by the Rev. J. S. Porter more than twenty
years ago, in the Belfast College. Some of our more sensitive and
timid friends may feel that Bishop Colenso?s treatment of the
Pentateuch affects the truth of the words of Christ when he refers
to Moses. But they put a precise meaning on the sayings of Christ
that probably he himself never intended; and there is every reason to
believe that he used language according to the custom and idiom
of his contemporaries. Those who cannot see the authority of
Christ in the sublimity of his doctrine, the exalted nature of his
sentiment, the grandeur of his life; but are troubled about the
10

letter which killeth, while missing the spirit which giveth life should
pray for more faith; and each one of them may appropriately use
the language, ?Lord I believe, help Thou mine unbelief. It was
recently insinuated, if not directly stated, by a public lecturer in
this city that the adoption of Bishop Colenso?s views involves the
loss of all piety??the only piety of which we can conceive as
existing between man and God.? Now, how little faith is here
exhibited. The speaker thought he was standing in the
relation of a defender of belief against scepticism ; whereas
he showed that he was deficient in a perception of the glorious
truth that God never left himself without a witness in the
human mind, heart, conscience, and soul?in his heaven above the
earth on which we dwell?the great sea?and in the living word.,
the spirit, and character of Jesus Christ. The law may have been
a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, but the man who thinks, now
that we have Christ, that the highest piety cannot be gained
without ignoring the results of Biblical criticism, is stil yn e
schoolmaster. Christians are to learn their piety and morality from
Christ not from Moses. By taking reasonable views of the
Pentateuch, we lose nothing as to the principles of a true devotion
and morality, and we gain a great many advantages?let me state
some of them. I. We are freed from the fundamental false
principle on which all the popular theology is founded?the
semblance of authority for the federal headship of Adam, and
from the notion that all mankind fell with him in his fust
transgression, and so were curesd by their creator. Ji. We are
freed from the inducement to make the melancholy attempt to
reconcile the ideas of a primitive age, with the ascertained facts ot
modern science. 111. The ground is cut away from that modern
Sabbatarianism which so superstitiously interferes in some countries
with the comfort, convenience, rational recreation, and rational
piety of a day of rest. IV. We are saved from attributing to a
God of justice and love-one whose tender memos are over all
his works, who is no respecter of persons ?feelings and actions
which we should regard as atrocious in a human being.
It would be too much for me to say that I agree with everything
that Bishop Colenso has written, though I agiee with a great deal
of it; and if any one will compare his calm, devout, patient,
industrious, and truth-loving spirit, with the unfairness, the
uncharitableness, and rancour of his opponents, he must feel Ur.
Colenso?s superiority as a man and a Christian.
Be not led away by any vague and vulgar abuse you may
hear or read of this good man, and be assured that it is not in his
power or that of any other man to upset the truth of God; that it
is not in the pow r er of any of his opponents to prevent its progress.
