PROPOSAL,
FOR ERECTING A MONUMENT,
ON ESTON-NAB, IN CLEVELAND,
IN MEMORY OF THE CELEBRATED NAVIGATOR,
Capt James Cooke.
THE Interests of Navigation, and the Honor of the Country, being
Objects of great National Importance, a Society of Gentlemen, desirous of
promoting such useful and beneficial Ends, propose a Subscription for erecting a
Monument in Honor of the celebrated Navigator Capt. JAMES COOKE, on
Eston-nab, a Mountain of Cleveland, in the Vicinity of which he was born:—
no Mark of Public Distinction and Gratitude having yet been shewn to his Memory.
The Situation is extremely well calculated for this Purpose, as the proposed
Monument would form a CONSPICUOUS SEA-MARK; and also a Land-
mark, from a large Portion of the Counties of York and Durham.
Should this Proposal meet the Approbation of the Lords and Gentlemen of
those Counties, and of others who may be inclined to favor so interesting an
Undertaking, an Answer addressed to any of the Gentlemen, whose Names are
under-written, will promote a Measure, which has long been the Subject of
public Conversation, but which has never yet been attempted to be carried into
Execution.
