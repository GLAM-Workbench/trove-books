PERTH.
Dear Miss Cowan,
Vi’ith reference to your letter ofmthe 3^ ultimo, there
seems no doubt- from tne extract from trie Journal of Captain
Allouam that possession was taken of Western Australia in
1772, the latitude as observed being approximately that of
Three Springs, but the longitude of 109°" 9 indicated - if
referred to Greenwich - would place the position nearly 400
miles out in the Indian Ocean. I think however, at tne time
the observation was taken there was no international agreement
as to the use of Greenwich as the standard for longitude, and
the longitude shown was probably deduced from that of Paris.
This would be equivalent to approximately 111° east from
Greenwich.
2. Tne approximate longitude of the coast at latitude
290 south is 114° yy showing an error of about 3 21
equivalent to 13m 23s in time.
3. Allowing , for the error in the chronometer, which probably
had n6t been checked for many months and also the error" in the
local time observation, the difference of 13m 2'is can easily be
accounted for.
4. Ido not t think that the observed latitude would be guaranteed
correct to 1 North or South, so that any search made for the
bottle buried at the foot of a young tree, ! would have to extend
over a distance of two miles along the coast line.
5* At the first convenient opportunity, I will have a search
made to see if it would be possible to locate the tree and whatever
was buried near it.
I am returning the original extract and translation.
Yours sincerely,
John C. CarLm,
SURVEYOR GENERAL

OBJECTS <fc HI3TORY OF THE VOYAGE OF tUf. YVKU 1)E KERGUELEN AND
FKA&COIS ALS3NE DB SAINT AU.OUARN 1U THK AUSTRALIAN 3KAS,
COMPILED FROM INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE FRENCH MINISTRY OF
MARINE, PARIS, AND PROM RKCORD3 IN POSSESSION OP THE BIBLIQTHKqUK,
NATIONALE. PARIS.
in the ißth. century the belief was widespread in France,
a result of the voyage of M. de Gonneville, that there existed in
the Southern Seas a vast continent, of which the coastline exceeded
3,000 miles. This continent was regarded as distinct from New
Holland (Australia), the position of which had already been roughly
worked out on a well-known atlas of the period, the atlas of
d*Apres de *annevilette, published in 1775 from naval records of
an earlier date*
a. de iverguelen who was a Breton, and apparently persona grata
at the Court, obtained from the &ing, Louis XV, a mission to search
for this southern continent, and to take possession of it in the
name of set out from Lorient in the Bay of
Biscay on the vessel "Be Barrier" on Ist* A ay , 1771, with instruc-
tions from the Department of Marine for himself and for M* Poivre,
Governor of the He de France (Mauritius i whither he was to
proceed first of all*
Arriving at Mauritius on the 20th. August, he a<*fced the
Governor to fit out two "flutes* (ships of war from which some of
the guns had been removed, and which were generally used to carry
passengers for the India Companyj. The Governor set aside for
this purpose the "Fortune** and the "Gros Ventre". Kerguelen, in
charge of the expedition, took command of the "Fortune". St.
a naval officer, also a native of Brittany, but then


resident in Mauritius, took command of the •Gros Ventre
After a short expedition into the Bay of Bengal to reconnoitre
a new route to India, the two vessels finally left Mauritius for the
southern seas on 16th* January, 1772 with provisions for 7 months.
*>t • Kiiouara, who had been ill, seemed at th*t time to be much
recovered, although subsequently he seems to have been ill more or
less during the whole of the succeeding voyage, inasmuch as Kerguelen
sent one of hi* own officers, M. Boisguehenneuc aboard the **Gros
Ventre” to superintend the navigation*
Cn Thursday, 13th* February, 1772, land was sighted in Lat*49°
31* S., Long* JO* K. from the meridian of Paris* This land wa
afterwards called Kerguelen island by Capt. Cook, its position having
been fairly accurately recorded by Kerguelen. For a few days the
two parties explored the country, and apparently St. Allouam’s com-
plement, unknown at the time to Kerguelen, left a bottle on the in-
hospitable coast, enclosing a parchment, which testified to the fact
in Latin, that possession of the country had been taken in the name
of Louis XV of France, M. de Boynes being Minister of Marine, in
the year 1772. A later French party who were searching for the
*bros Ventre added the date 1773* which greatly puzzled Capt* Cook,
when at Christmas. 1776 he visited the island, and some of his crew
also discovered the bottle, affixed by wire to the rocks* Cook wrote
on the back of the document, also in Latin, to the effect that the
British ships *K«solution” and •Discovery'* had anchored there in
December, 1776.
To return to the initial discoverers, on the 17th, Peby • ,1772,
the boats were separated in a storm and unable to rejoin company*
Kerguelen, in the belief that the "Gros Ventre” had become a total


loss* set sail for Mauritius* which he reached $4 days after his
departure from it. On the sth. May he returned to France without
news of the "Gros Ventre”% He was later criticised for having aban-
doned his other vessel* particularly at Port Louis* although this was
one of the charges to which he had to reply at an enquiry in the
nature of a Court-Martial held in France*
st. Allouam and the "Gros Ventre" were not* however* lost as
Kerguelen thought* After having looked for the "Fortune" for some
dayB, fired guns and sent up rockets* St. Allouam, having a stock of
provisions* decided to sail east* in the belief that Kerguelen would
continue the task of discovering the southern continent sighted by
M* de Gonneville, sore especially as it was on his initiative that
the expedition had originally set out. Incidentally* St. Allouam*s
complement had been increased* for one of the "Fortune*s" boats
called the "Fly" had capsized* and its occupants* including one M.de
Rosily, had been picked up by the "Gros Ventre"* and thus took part
in the voyage to the Australian coast.
The "Gros Ventre"* sailing by the map of M. d"Apres de Mannevil-
ette already mentioned* sighted land on the 17th. March. According
to the map it was Cape Leeuwin. In hie personal diary* which is
distinct from the log of the "Gros Ventre", evidently written toy
another person* St. Allouam states:- “Sailing N.K. quarter £• till
2 a.m. when we sighted the coast of Mew Holland: the south-west part
quite close* by the light of the setting moon." He goes on to say
that as soon as the anchor was dropped the boats were set off* but
they came back without having been able to land* owing to the fact
that the high coastline set up such a backwash that they were almost
swamped. They saw no traces of inhabitants. The land was reddish


and burnt in places,- and on the summits of the hills were thick
timber and brushwood* They saw some caves which looked as if they
had been made by men, but they considered they must be natural form-
ations • The oaves these early navigators saw are still to be seen,
and they extend parallel with the coast from the Leeuwin to Ysllingup
some 20 miles south of Bueselton*
The "Gros Ventre" continued her voyage northwards along the
coast, and the diazy records that they caught a lot of fish, a kind
of 'pilchard, something of the type of sardines* ' They also caught a
huge shark weighing JOO-lbs*, which St. Allouam says is unlike any
he has seen elsewhere as regards the head and tail, but he considers
them to be no less dangerous, to judge from their teeth, four splendid
rows, two above and two below, broad and flat*
Several days of very bad weather were experienced, then on Sunday,
29th* March, 1772, which was fine, land was sighted at 4 p*m» and the
anchor dropped at 10 p.su The land was very arid, sandy and reddish,
with no trees, but a little brushwood* The coast appeared to be quite
safe, the breakers almost on the shore, and it was possible to coast
along* The next morning at 10 o'clock they thought they
some
smoke two or three leagues inland* It seemd very thick, and led them
to believe that the country was inhabited, although they saw no traces
of human beings along the coast*
€n Monday 30th. March, 1772, the vessel was taken to a new anchor*
age in a small bay, trouble being experienced in getting the anchor to
hold on the sandy bottom* the latitude by observation was 25°28*.
St* Allouam personally states:* "We sent our boat to take possession
of the land in the nane of France, and set up the arms* The officer
had instructions to go over the country for a distance of three or four


leagues. He reported that the locality was sandy and full of very
thick undergrowth, which tired them considerably. They found several
fur-bearing animals of a type unknown to them, especially one kind
about the size of a dog, and a sort of "Maquis." (A Maquie is a long-
tailed monkey found in Madagascar.)
A parallel account of the above, as taken from the offical log of
the "Sros Ventre" records:- "This morning we sent the land yawl to
skirt along the sandy shores from the B.W. to the G.K. At a cablets
length Inland we put down a bore and reached bottom at 29 to 2 88., a
fine gushing sand, and at 10 o f clock in the morning M. de St. Allouam
despatched the yawl under an officer to take notes of the country,
assisted by the crew of the yawl and nine soldiers, and their route
took them into a basin which lies 3.5. K.
They covered about three leagues across this country, without
finding a living soul; the land here is sandy, and covered with small
shrubs and similar plants, like those found at the Cape of Good Hope.
M. de Mingot on his return to the coast took possession of the
land to the H.lif, 4 H. from the ship, by hoisting the flag, the formal
act of taking possession being recorded in writing in the manner
customary in like cases, and being plaoed in n bottle which was buried
at the foot of a young tree, near to which we placed two six franc coins*
St. Allouam takes up the story,
March, 1772 "several pepole vent over
ing. The trees were found to be all
is all the more surprising, since we i
and says that on Tuesday,
the oountry all afternoon hunt-
burnt and reduced to ash* This
aw no trace of human beings*
Jtossibly the explanation is that the wood is dried by the sun and takes
fire when too dry; otherwise we can ot explain it. Birds are not
plentiful. Thpy found one or two about the size of a goose, but there
are a lot of birds of prey, gulls along the shore, crows, ducks and


cormorants, and a lot of small turtles in the sand. They brought
back two or three hundred. Consequently we sent the small boat
ashore during the night to try to get some, but without success.
Bo doubt they had finished laying their eggs. Yet the large
number of small ones seemed to promise a good haul. They saw a
large beast like a dog (Bote: this was probably a dingo) which
came prowling round the places where the turtles lay their eggs.
They had a shot at it but missed. As regards plants, we found
only a kind of thyme and some sage. At 7 p*m. the long boat
returned; we got it on board, and in the morning also shipped the
two cutters."
*he next day they anchored in 23 fathoms of water* The sand
was reddish grey with decayed shells. The log states that "at
6 o'clock in the evening the Capt* sent the land yawl under an
officer to bury a man named Massicot, an assistant gunner, who had
died of scurvy, and to fill in the time during the night to see if
it were possible to catch the turtles in the Great Basin, but he
did not produce any for our inspection."
The place where St. Ailouam too* possession has been definite-
ly identified as the Bay of Turtles, in the vicinity of Cape Inscrip-
tion, in the extreme north of Dirk lA artog Island, the moat westerly
point of Australia, only a very narrow channel spw separating the
island from the actual mainland. The original stake with the in-
scription of Birk Hartog, from whence the Cape derives its name, has
“been removed to Perth, and substitutes erected. At the present time
the country in the vicinity is bare of vegetation, practically all of
the timber having been cut out by visiting fishermen or by the light-
house keepers when Cape Inscription was an attended light; now it is
automatic.


From the observations it would seem that where they buried the
assistant gunner was on Bernier or lslands, which latter island
used as a reservation for sick natives in recent years.
On Wednesday Ist, April, 1772 at 7 a.m, they sounded 9 fathoms,
when all at once they found themselves on a sandbank in 3& fathoms.
The vessel, however, soon got off, and they entered a bay to look for
Dirk Hartog's river* On the 9*h, April they left what they called
Dirk Hartog's May, as it appeared as such on their charts, but it had
been previously discovered by Dampier, who had called it 3hark Bay,
and as such it is known today* The William Biver and Rosemary
island (Dampier Archipelago i were identified, and then the course was
set for Timor, which was reached on the 3rd, May* After a stay of
two months, **t, Ailouam then left for Batavia on the Ist. July, staying
there until the 11th, August, when he sailed on the final stage of his
journey. Returning to Mauritius on the 5 th. Sept,, he learned that
Kerguelen had gone back to France, His vessel was laid and he him-
self taken to hospital in a critical condition along with M, de Mingot*
The latter died a few days later*
k&illard Dumesse, who seems to have been the Apostolic Prefect in
Port Louis, states in a letter apparently written to the Church author-
ities in Fraode, as it is addressed Monseigneur, that on the 27th«
1772 he, the undrroigned, has given Church burial (sepulture ecclesias-
tique) to the body of M. Francois Alesne de Baint Ailouam, Lieut, of the
hing*a ship the *Gros Ventre*, who died the same day, fortified by the
sacraments, at the age of 35 years, the declaration being made in the
presence of Jsour witnesses.
But for this unfortuitous circumstance, there is every reason for
believing that the proclamation of taking possession of the continent


would have been followed up by the act of occupation, certainly
before the arrival of the first fleet sent out by the British in
1788*
m. de Hosily, who was on the H Cros Ventre” by chance.
having originally sailed on the "Fortune**, han also left a record
of his joumeyings after leaving the latter vessel. He afterwards
became an Admiral and Peer of France, and was a colleague of M.
Buache in the Hydrographic Department, Paris. M. Buache, whose
name was given to an island outside of Fremantle, renamed Garden
Island by Capt* « T aa. Stirling when he landed there in 1829, Is
thought to be the author of another account of the voyage of the
"Gros Ventre", compiled towards the end of the eighteenth century,
after the voyage of d’Hntrecastaux*
