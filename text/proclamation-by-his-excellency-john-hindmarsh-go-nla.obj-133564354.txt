Ilf announcing to the Colonists of His Majesty’s Province of South Australia, the establishment of the Government, I hereby cal*
apon them to conduct themselves on all occasions with order and quietness, duly to respect the laws, and by a course of industry and sobriety, by
the practice of sound morality, and a strict observance oi the Ordinances of Religion, to prove themselves worthy to be the Founders of a great
tad free Colony.
It is also, at this time especially, my duty to apprize the Colonists of my resolution, to take every lawful means for extending the same
protection to the NATIVE POPULATION as to the rest of His Majesty’s Subjects, and of my firm determination to punish with exemplary
severity, all acts of violence or injustice which may in any manner be practised or attempted against the Natives, who are 1o be considered as
much under the Safeguard of the law as the Colonists themselves, and equally entitled to (|.e privileges of British Subjects. I trust therefore, with
confidence to the exercise of moderation and forbearance by all Classes, in their intercourse with the Native Inhabitants, and that they will emit
svo opportunity of assisting me to fulfil His Majesty’s most gracious and benevolent intentions towards them, by promoting their advancement i»
aiviluaUon, and ultimately, under the biasing of Divine Providence, their conversion to the Christian Faith.
