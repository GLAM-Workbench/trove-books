HyJVIJM3 TO BE joUNQ BY THE [SCHOLAR.
Hymn 1.
1 The world looks very beautiful,
And full of joy to me;
The sun shines out in glory bright
On everything I see.
I know I shall be happy,
While in the world I stay,
For 1 will follow Jesus,
I’ll follow all the way.
Chorus —I’ll follow, follow, follow, follow,
Follow all the way.
2 I’m but a youthful pilgrim here,
My journey’s just begun ;
They tell me I shall sorrow meet
Before my journey’s done.
The world is full of sorrow
And suffering, they say ;
But I will follow Jesus,
And follow all the way.— Cho.
H I’l l en oiTThy youliitui pTTgfimage,
Whatever I may meet.
I’ll take it—joy and sorrow all—
And lay at Jesus’ feet.
He’ll comfort me in trouble,
He’ll wipe my tears away,
With joy I’ll follow Jesus,
And follow all the way. — Cho.
4 Then trials cannot weigh me down,
And pain I need not fear;
For when I’m close by Jesus’ side,
Grief cannot come too near.
Not even death can harm me,
When death I meet one day ;
To heaven I’ll follow Jesus,
And follow all the way.— Cho.
Hymn 2.
1 Hark! the herald angels say
“Christ the Lord is born to-day!”
Let the wond’ring earth reply,
“'Glory be to God on high !”
Oh, be joyful, all ye lands!
Let the mountains clap their hands;
Let the hills together sing,
Glory, glory to our King,
Glory to our Saviour King.
2 Lo! He comes! the Prince of Peace
Comes the prisoners to release;
O’er the regions veiled in night
He will pour celestial light.
Praise the Lord, ye isles afar!
See the bright and morning star!
Hail its lustre, while ye sing
Glory, glory, &c.
Hymn 3.
1 Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God !
He whose word can not be broken,
Form’d thee for his own abode.
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation’s walls surrounded,
Thou may’st smile at all thy foes.
2 See the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Still supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove.
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst t’ assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord the giver,
Never fails from age to age.
Round each habitation liov’ring.
~"Sec”'the sire ami cloud appear,
For a glory and a cov’ring,
Showing that the Lord is near.
He who gives us daily manna,
He who listens when we cry, '
Let Him hear the loud hosanna
Rising to His throne on high.
Hymn 4.
1 I LOVE to think of the heavenly land,
Where white rob’d angels are;
Where many a friend is gathered safe
From fear and toil and care.
There’ll be no parting,
There’ll be no parting there.
2 I love to think of the heavenly land,
Where my Redeemer reigns,
Where rapturous songs of triumph rise,
In endless, joyous strains. —Ref
3 I love to think of the heavenly land,
The saints' eternal home, [fade,
Where palms, and robes, and crowns ne’er
And sorrows cannot come. — Ref.
4 I love to think of the heavenly land,
The greetings we shall meet,
The harps—the songs for ever ours—
The walls—the golden street. — Ref.
5 I love to think of the heavenly land,
That promised land so fair,
Oh, how my raptured spirit longs
To be for ever there. — Ref.


Hymn 5.
1 Seek the Saviour! tho’ around thee
Drops a dark and dismal cloud,
Tho’ it feels so deep and heavy,
On a heart with sorrow bowed,
Seek Him quickly, time is passing,
Passing rapidly away;
Listen to the words that tell thee,
There is still a brighter day.
2 Seek the Saviour! though life’s tempest
May unfurl life’s chilling blast;
There is hope for thee, my brother,
Storms will not for ever last.
Do not deem thyself forsaken !
Never think that thou art lost:
Look! there comes a gleam of sunshine;
See what thy redemption cost.
3 Seek the Saviour! stand not grieving
O’er that darksome billow there;
Life’s a sea of stormy billows,
We must meet them everywhere;
Pass right through them, do not tarry,
Overcome the heaving tide,
There’s a sparkling gleam of sunshine
Waiting on the other side.
Hymn 6.
1 Oh, bliss of the purified ! bliss of the free!
I plunge in the crimson-tide opened for me!
O’er sin and imek j ;imreas exulting I stand.
And point to the print of the nails in His
hand.
Chorus —Oh, sing of His mighty love,
Mighty to save.
2 Oh, bliss of the purified ! Jesus is mine,
No longer in dread condemnation I pine,
In concious salvation I sing of His grace,
Who lifteth upon me the smiles of His face.
Cho. —Oh, sing of His, &c.
3 Oh, bliss of the purified! bliss of the pure-
No wound has the soul that His blood can-
not cure;
No sorrow-bowed head but may sweetly
find rest, —
No tears but may dry them on Jesus’ breast.
Cho. —Oh, sing of His, &c.
4 O Jesus the Crucified! thee will I sing !
My bl essed Redeemer! My God an dmy King!
My soul filled with rapture shall shout o’er
the grave,
And triumph in death in the Mighty to save.
Cho. —Oh, sing of .His, &c.
Hymn 7.
1 T ield not to temptation, for weakness is sin,
Bach vict’ry will help us some other to win;
Fight manfully onward, dark passions sub-
due,
Look ever to Jesus, He’ll carry you through.
Refrain —Ask the Saviour to help you,
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you,
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.
2 Shun evil companion s, bad language disdain,
God’s name bold in rev’rence, nor take it
in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest, kind-hearted
and true,
Look ever to Jesus, he’ll carry you through.
lief. —Ask the Saviour, &c.
3 To him tli at o’ercomcth, God giveth a crown,
Through faith we shall conquer, though
often cast down ;
He who is the Saviour, our strength will
renew.
Look ever to Jesus, he’ll carry you through.
lief. —Ask the Saviour, &c.
Hymn 8.
1 Listen ! the Master beseecheth,
Galling each one by his name ;
His voice to each loving heart reacheth,
Its cheerfullest service to claim.
Go where the vineyard demandeth
Vinedressers’ nurture and care;
Or go where the white harvest standeth,
The joy of the reaper to share.
Chorus —Then work, brothers, work! let us
slumber no longer,
For God’s call to labour grows stronger and
stronger;
The light of this life shall be darkened full
soon,
But the light of the better life resteth at noon.
Work for the good that Is nigh'Cst;
Dream not of greatness afar ;
That glory is ever the highest,
Which shines upon men as they are.
Work, though the world would defeat you;
Heed not its slander and scorn ;
Nor weary till angels shall greet y:u
With smiles through the gates of the morn.
Cho. —Then work, &c.
3 Offer thy life on the altar;
In the high purpose be strong;
And if tne fired spirit should falter,
Then sweeten thy labour with song.
What if the poor heart complaiueth?
Soon shall its wailing be o’er; .
For there, in the rest which remaineth,
It shall grieve and be weary no more.
Cho. —Then work, See.
Hymn 9.
1 We’re travelling home to heaven above,
Will you go, will you go, will you go ?
To sing the Saviours dying love,
Will you go, will you go, -will you go?
Millions have reached that blest abode,
Anointed kings and priests to God,
And millions more are on the road,
Will you go, will you go, will you go?
2 Ye weary, heavy-laden, come,
Will you go?
In that blest house there still is room,
Will you go?
The Lord is waiting to receive,
If thou wilt on him now believe,
Pie’ll give thy troubled conscience ease,
Come, believe.


3 The way to heaven is straight and plain,
Will you go ?
Repent, believe, be born again,
Will you go?
The Saviour cries aloud to thee,
“Take up thy cross and.follow me,
And thou shaft my salvation see,
. Come to me.”
4 Oh, could I hear some sinner say,
I will go;
I’ll start this moment, clear the way,
Let me go!
My old companions, fare you well,
I will not go with you to hell,
With Jesus Christ I mean to dwell,
Let me go!
Hymn 10.
1 This is not my place of resting,
Mine’s a city yet to come;
Onward to it I am hasting,
On to my eternal home.
Chorus —Nevermore, nevermore,
Nevermore be sad or weary ;
Nevermore, nevermore,
Nevermore to sin again.
2 In it all is light and glory,
O’er it shines a nightless day:
Every trace of sin’s sad story —
3 There the Lamb, our Shepherd, leads us,
By the streams of life along,
On the freshest pastures feeds us,
Turns our sighing into song.— Cho.
4 Soon we pass this dreary desert,
Soon we bid farewell to pain;
Nevermore be sad and weary,
Nevermore to sin again,— Clio.
Hymn 11.
1 Bright crowns there are laid up on high,
Which youthful brows may wear;
And there are palms of victory,
Which youthful hands may bear:
And here on earth are many feet
Straying in paths of sin,
That by God’s wondrous grace made meet,
His glory yet may win.
Chorus —Bright crowns there are,
Bright crowns laid up on high;
For you and me
There are palms of victory.
2 Brother, though thine may ever be
A lowly hidden way,
Faint not! “the Master calleth thee
He bids thee “work to-day.”
One deed of thine, one faithful word —
Perdhance a lifted prayer- -
May draw some wand’rer to the Lord,
His shelt’ring love to share. — Cho.
3 .And when, with soul-transporting bliss,
We come before His throne,
’Twill be an added happiness
To come not then alone;
And higher shall heaven’s echoes rise,
And harps shall sweeter ring,
Blending with children’s symphonies,
The praises of our King.— Cho.
Hymn 12.
1 There’s a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar,
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place there.
Cho.—ln the sweet by-aud-by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
2 We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more—
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.— Cho,
3 To our bountiful Father above
We will offer the tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our days.
Anthem.
Solo —Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ, the Royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle
See His banners go.
—'Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Duet —At the sign of triumph
Satan’s host doth flee ;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory.
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.— Cho.
Trio —Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod :
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope, in doctrine,
One in charity.— Cho.
Quartette —Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise,
And that cannot fail..— Cho.
All —Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng ;
Blend with ours your voices,
In the triumph-song—
Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King—
This through countless ages,
Men and angels sing.— Cho.
