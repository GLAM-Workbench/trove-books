OF THE
FINANCIAL PROBLEM S
INVOLVED IN THE
FEDERATION OF THE AUSTRALASIAN COLONIES.
TABLES ORIGINALLY PREPARED FOR THE TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT

BRIEF EXPLANATORY NOTE.
<*)3issjr/e>cfro
zr-srr
The following Tables relating to questions of Federal Finance are intended to afford aid in determining
what are the cardinal points of the problem, and by illustrations, based on the latest figures available at the
time of preparation, to indicate approximately what the effects may be as x'egards each federating State by
transfer of certain functions and responsibilities to a Central Federal Government.
For the purpose of giving more definite illustration, only the following points are provisionally
assumed :
1. That each Federal State shall relinquish and transfer the following Revenues, Functions,,
and Obligations :
(a) Customs and Excise. See Tables 11 ., VII.
{h) Post and Telegraphs. See Tables VI., VII.
(c) Defences. Sec Tables V, VII.
(d) Public Debts. See Tables 111. , IV.
2. That the Interest Burden on Debt of each Colony transferred shall be equitably determined,
as illustrated in methods shown hereafter in Tables 111., IV., V., and VIII.
3. That the Total Federal Expenditure be annually defrayed by taxes levied directly by a
Uniform Tariff at the. Ports in each Colony. See Table IX.
4. That differential Tariffs (the permanent dominant causes of the inequalities in the existing
Customs and Excise charges of separate Colonies) being abolished, allocation of amounts
levied generally or distribution of losses or surpluses be distributed on the basis of Population,
as in Table IX.
5. The assumption, control, and the ultimate consolidation of the existing State Debts by Federal
Government, while still preserving the principle of equitable distribution as regards the


amount transferred by each Colony, or which under agreed conditions might, in the future, be
occasioned by the respective developmental needs of any one of the federating States.
6. The abolition of Customs Duties as regards the interchange of the purely Home Products of the
several Federal States.
7. Uniformity of Excise Duties.
Double Aspect of Financial Results of Transfer as regards each Colony ,
The effect of the transfer of Functions, Revenues, &c., and the direct equitable levy of Federal Taxes
upon the Taxpayer, has a very important double aspect as regards each Colony; viz.—
1. The effect as regards each Local Treasury.
2. The effect as regards the General Taxpayers of each Colony.
It is obvious, so far as the General Taxpayer of each Colony is concerned, that the loss to Local
Treasury of Excise and Customs Revenue affords a corresponding gain or relief to the Local Taxpayer.
Thus (Table II.), while it is estimated that the Local Treasuries of the Five Federating Colonies lose
£5,536,185 (or £l 17s. per head of population) by relinquishing Customs and Excise Revenue, the Local
Taxpayers are relieved or gain a corresponding amount. Conversely, while the Local Taxpayer is debited
-directly with Federal Expenditure by means of Federal Duties to the extent of £7,019,346, or £2 ss. 7 d,
per head of population, the Local Treasuries are not directly affected by it.
Table YIII. therefore must be understood to be confined to the effects of transfer iipon Local
Treasuries solely. The effect of all influences upon the Colonies, as a whole, and their respective Tax-
payers, is broadly indicated in Table X. Both of these effects are contrasted together as follows :

There are many other points to consider which modify these general conclusions, hut which are better
considered separately. It is hoped that the illustrations given will be helpful in the final consideration of
this important aspect of Federation.
