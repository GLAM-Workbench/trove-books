there is no chance of getting another.
At Koniggratz I had only one cigar left
in ray pocket, which I carefully guarded t
during the whole of the battle as a miser
guards his treasure. I did not feci Justi-
fied in usingit. I painted in glowing colors
the happy hour when I should enjoy it
after the victory. But I had miscalculated
my chances. A poor dragoon lay help-
less, with both arms crushed, murmuring
for something to refresh him. I felt in
my pockets and found I had only gold,
which would be of no use to him. But
stay, I had still my cherished cigar. I
lighted it for him and placed it between
his teeth. You should have seen, the poor
fellow’s grateful smile. I never enjoyed
a cigar so much as the one I did not
smoke.”

St Vitus’ Daace Cured
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
A, LAD WHOSE SUFFERINGS WERE TERRIBLE TO WITNESS.
IRREFUTABLE TESTIMONY OF A MISSIONARY'S WIFE.
“ Lake Condah,
„_. ~ w . n . ~ . “ October 11th, 1897.
The Dr. Williams Medicine Co., Sydney.
“ Sms,—l have much pleasure in stating that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured a
bad case of St. Vitus’ Dance on our station.
“Willie Lovett, a lad 17 years of age, was attacked with the disease in question about
two and a-half years ago. He was prescribed for by several doctors, but grew steadily
worse. The whole of the right side, from the head down to the feet, was affected. He
could neither dress nor feed himself, and his limbs and face were constantly twitching
in a manner distressing to see, both night and day. He could get no proper rest. The
pockets of his suits were all torn down the right side owing to the involuntary convulsive
movements made by his hand when he put it into them. The last doctor who attended
him told his friends they would have to be very careful that the lad should not get a
fright, or be hastily spoken to, as if that happened he might fall down dead, his brain was
in such a bad state. Seeing accounts of several oases of cure of St. Vitus’ Dance in your
little nampblet which was sent to me, I wrote to Sydney for six boxes of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and the lad commenced taking them according to directions.
“ Rv the time he had taken three boxes be was so much improved as to be able tolfeed
himself, to wash and dress himself, and even to lace his own hoots, a thing he had not done
for a very long time before. When he finished the six boxes he was perfectly cured, and
looked quite a different boy.
“ For over four months he has been out in all sorts of weather rabbit-trapping with his
father, can nse his pen, and chop wood, carry heavy buckets of water, and, in fact, do
a n y kind of rough work. Just at present he is away from here working as a wool-picker
in a large shed in the Western District, where his father is engaged as a shearer.
“I give you this unsolicited testimony, not for the purpose of extending the sale of
Pink Pills, but in order that other sufferers from the same disease, of whom there are
doubtless manv in the colony, may, perhaps, try them, and receive similar benefit to what
this lad has got through their use.
“I am quite willing to reply to any enquiries as to the genuineness of this case, and
you are at liberty to make what use you please of my testimony.
“I am, Sirs, yours truly,
“M. STABLE.”
“To the'Dr.f'Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney,
“ Sirs, —I have asked Mrs. Stable, our Missionary’s wife, to nform you of the good
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have done our son, " Willie.’ Every word of what this lady has so
kindly written is perfectly true, and I can assure you I am thankful to God for curing my
hoy through their means, for we were afraid he would never get better, as all other
medicines seemed to give him no relief at all. He was suffering for over two years.
“ I am. Sirs, yours gratefully,
“(Mrs.) HANNAH LOVETT.'
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have a remarkable efficacy in curing diseases arising from an
impoverished condition of the blood, or an impairment of the nervous system, such as
rheumatism, neuralgia, partial paralysis, locomotor ataxia, nervous headache, nervous
prostration and the tired feeling arising therefrom. They are genuine only with the full
name, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and are sold in boxes encircling which is a
blue warning label. The outside wrapper is of white paper, and is printed in red ink.
Our repeated warnings may seem a trifle superfluous in the eyes of the reading public, but
they were never more needed than now, and the frequency with which they appear is
attributable to our desire to afford our customers every protection. Imitators are in every
corner of Australasia, and many vendors are endeavouring to pass off a hurtful substitute
as it means a larger profit to them, and the public would do well to avoid them, for they
would just as readily dispense mpure drugs. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable
from all leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place, Sydney
who will forward, post paid, on receipt of stamps or post order, one box for 2s 9d, or half
a dozen for 15s 3d.

Mirages.
There are few phenomena in nature so
striking as mirages, whether they take
the form of the palm groves seen across
a desert, as, for instance, in going through
the Suez Canal, or of portents in the sky
like that wonderful storm-blow figuring
in the three crosses of Calvary, which
forms the frontispiece of Mr. Whymper’s
“ Scrambles in the Alps.” A species of
mirage commonly seen across lakes in
fine weather is the Fata Morgana , whereby
diminutive cottages are magnified into
gorgeous fairy palaces, rocks become pin-
nacles, and so on. M. Delebeoque has
recently been making an examination into
the causes of this phenomenon, and has
communicated his researches to the
Academie des Sciences. He finds that if
the magnified object be scrutinised
through a telescope it resolves itself into
a number of separate superposed images
which cannot be distinguished by the eye.
Moreover, it may happen that only one
r oriion of the object is magnified at a
time; thus he has seen a boat with double
hull and normal sails suddenly transform
itself into a single hull with gigantic
spread of canvas. As many as five
images may be reflected at the same time.
The mirage also occasionally takes the
reverse form, of diminishing objects
looked at. It occurs most frequently
when the temperature of the air is higher
than that of the lake.

Physiologists in modern times con-
demn the ordinary bran of wheat
as Irritating and likely to inflame
the delicate intestines, and in this
fact lies the great value of
GRANUMA,
because its special manufacture is
devoted to rendering the bran por-
tion smooth, soluble and digestible,
retaining the natural phosphates
always attached to the outer shell
of wheat. Phosphates supply
vitality, teeth and brain.

The sale of Gilbby’s Dry Gin in New South
Wales five times exceeds that of any other

It enjoys the same popular call in the other col-

Gilbey’s Dry Gin is specially recommended by
doctors for kidney and allied maladies. Taken
with a dash of Angostura, or with Soda or Ginger
Beer, it is a most refreshing and wholesome
stimulant.

Why is the Negro Black ?
The pigmentation of the negro is a
question that has long vexed ethnologists.
One of the most curious theories yet
ventilated to account for it, however, is put
forward by Mr. A. H. Keane in “ Bthno-
logy ” (Cambridge Geographical Series),
that “it seems due to the stimulating
action of solar heat, combined with mois-
ture and an excess of vegetable food, yield-
ing more carbon than can be assimilated,
the character being thdh fixed by heredity.”

The “ gentleman farmer,” so called, has
to put up with many jokes at his expense
in print. In real life he is not often
treated to speeches as amusing as one
which recently came to our ears. Before
leaving his place for a winter visit to gayer
scenes, the “ farmer ” of the anecdote
called his Hibernian head man and said —
“ Flynn, I have to be away for a fortnight.
I hope everything will run smoothly on
the farm.” “ Oh,” said Flynn, heartily,
“ye don’t do a bit o’ harm, sir, when
you’re here ! ”

“ No. I will be candid with you. I went
in to get a drink. You see it was this
way. I had a counterfeit coin passed on
me.” “ Yes.” “And there are only two
places a man can get rid of a counterfeit
coin—a church and a public-house. And
of course I didn’t want to pass it on the
contribution box.” The Rev. Mr. W.—

Electric Lighting in Bolton.
The demand for electricity in Bolton
has grown rapidly since its introduction
by the Corporation ; and the recent
adoption of what is known as the Brighton
scale of charges promises to give such a
stimulus to the public demand that it has
been decided to spend an additional
£30,000 on the extension of the works
and plant. The revised scale places the
electric light within the means of the in-
dustrial classes, and before long it is
expected that many working men’s homes
in the town will be lighted by electricity
in place of gas.
