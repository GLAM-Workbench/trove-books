DISTURBANCES AT BALLAAEAT.
Ordered by the Council to be printed, 5th December, 1854.
CHAS. HOTHAM, Message No. 30.
Lieutenant Governor.
The Lieutenant Governor has the painful duty of informing the Legislative Council
that serious disturbances have occurred at Ballaarat.
Misguided men, assembled in armed bodies, under military leaders, have intimidated
and plundered the well affected, set the law at defiance, and fired on and killed some of
Her Majesty?s forces. Promptly to suppress this insurrection, the Lieutenant Governor,
with the advice of his Executive Council, has proclaimed Martial Law, confining its
execution to the district in which the outrages have been perpetrated.
The Lieutenant Governor is aware that the population of Ballaarat generally do not
participate in these seditious movements, and he has adopted a course by which the wishes
and interests of the well affected will, in his opinion, best be consulted.
On the support of the Legislative Council and the loyalty of the colonists he con-
fidently relies, and trusts that the measures to which he has had recourse will, under
Divine Providence, restore peace and tranquillity to the country.
He has availed himself of the earliest opportunity of placing the Council in full
possession of the steps he has felt it imperatively his duty to take, and will cause to be
laid before them copies of Despatches and Papers on the subject.

3rd December, 1854.
Sir
I have the honor to report for the information of the Major General the following details
relative to a collision that took place this morning between the troops under my command and the
Ballaai at rebels. - . ï¿½ , i i i ?u c*n
The Major General has already been made aware of the fact that a large number ot ill-
disposed persons have for some days been openly organizing, drilling, and equipping themselves
with the undisguised object of attacking Her Majesty?s Troops, and, if possible, or subverting the
Government. . . , c , . .
During the night of the 1st instant, frequent signals were observed passing trom tent to
tent around the Camp, and several shots were fired over the heads of the sentries, I therefore
considered it necessary on the following day to issue a public notice -
u That no light would be allowed in the neighbourhood after eight o clock, that no
? discharge of fire-arms would be permitted on any pretence, and that persons
? disobeying these orders would be fired at.?
This notice produced the desired effect.
B.? No. 30. a.


Early on the 2nd instant, information reached me that the rebels were forming an intrenched
camp at the Eureka Diggings, about a mile and a half from our Camp, with the avowed intention
of intercepting the Forces under the Major General?s command en route from Melbourne.
In the course of the afternoon, Mr. Commissioner Amos, in charge of the Eureka Station,
arrived here, and reported that an armed party of the rebels had marched up to his Camp, taken
him prisoner, and subsequently released him, but kept possession of his horse.
During the whole of that day, strong bodies of insurgents were parading the diggings in
every direction, many of them in sight of the Camp, robbing stores, collecting arms, and forcing
people to join their ranks.
I did not consider it prudent to attack them, as they were not collected in any one spot, and
the safety of the Camp would have been risked had a large portion of the force been withdrawn.
I determined, however, to attack their camp at daylight the next morning. For this
purpose the troops (detailed in the margin) were ordered to assemble at half-past two o?clock
A.M. At three o?clock I left with this force, handing over the charge of the Camp to Captain
Atkinson, of the 12th regiment, with the remainder of the troops and police.
Accompanying us were Mr. Commissioner Amos, who acted as guide, Messrs. Hackett,
P.M., and Webster, Civil Commissary, all magistrates.
In excellent order and with perfect silence the force arrived, in about half an hour, in
front of the intrenchment, andabout 300 yards from it, under cover of a rise of the ground. The
detachments of the 12th and 40th Regiments extended in skirmishing order, each having its
proper support.
Part of the mounted force of military and police moved towards the left of their position
to threaten its flank and rear, the remainder of the mounted force and the foot police were kept
in reserve ; we then advanced quietly towards the intrenchments where the revolutionary flag was
flying. At about 150 yards we were received by a rather sharp and well-directed fire from the
rebels, without word or challenge on their part. Then, and not till then, I ordered the bugle to
sound the ? commence firing.? For about ten minutes a heavy fire was kept up by the troops
advancing, which was replied to by the rebels. During this time I brought up the infantry sup-
ports and foot police. The intrenchment was then carried, and I ordered the firing to cease.
All persons found within the intrenchment were taken prisoners, and many of the fugitives were
intercepted by the cavalry.
I afterwards brought the infantry, and a portion of the mounted police, in charge of the
prisoners and wounded, to camp, directing the remainder of the cavalry to recover the Government
Camp at the Eureka, which was about 500 yards from the place where we then stood, and which
was reported to be in possession of the insurgents. They found that it had been occupied by them
during the night, and that it had subsequently been deserted; the whole force accordingly
returned to Camp.
The number of prisoners brought in was 125; a few of them, however, I ordered to be
released, as I was not satisfied they had been in the engagement, although they were in the
immediate neighbourhood. Several have been taken since on the charge of insurrection, which
makes the number now in custody 114.
The behaviour of the troops and police, both officers and men, in this skirmish was very
good, and whilst I hope the Major General will be pleased to convey to His Excellency my
appreciation of the conduct of the whole police force under my command, I feel it right particu-
larly to notice the extreme steadiness of the foot police under Captain Carter, who were brought
up with the supports to carry the intrenchment.
I am most desirous of acknowledging the great assistance I have received in this affair and
in all the arrangements connected with my command, from Captain Pasley, R.E., who was good
enough to act as my aide-de-camp on this occasion, and who joined the skirmishers in their
advance. Mr. Webster remained under fire the whole time, giving me the benefit of his services.
Mr. Hackett, the police magistrate, remained with the infantry, and Mr. Amos guided the cavalry
to their position.
I cannot omit from my Despatch the expression of my deep regret at the dangerous wound
received by Captain Wise of the 40th Regiment, who, remaining at his post after getting a slight
wound, fell on the inside of the intrenchment when conspicuously leading his company to the
attack. Lieut. Paul, 12th Regiment, also received a severe wound, but continued to do his duty
in the ranks.
The number of the killed and wounded on the side of the insurgents was great, but I have
no means of ascertaining it correctly; I have reason, however, to believe that there were not less
than thirty killed on the spot, and I know that many have since died of their wounds.
Amongst these and the persons in custody several leaders of the insurrection appear, two
of whom lie dangerously if not mortally wounded, in hotels near the spot.
The effect of this blow has been that the police now patrol in small bodies the length and
breadth of the Ballaarat Gold Fields without threats or insults. To such of the wounded as have
not been removed, I have sent medical assistance, and have caused the unclaimed dead to be taken
away and buried in the Cemetery.

LIST of Casualties incurred by the Force under the command of Captain J. W. Thomas

Camp, Ballaarat,
4th December, 1854.
Sir,
I have not felt it incumbent on me to report to you every day, nor do I consider it
necessary to enter into the details of the engagement which took place yesterday morning, which
are fully given in Captain Thomas?s report to the Major General, a copy of which you will no
doubt have received.
Gross misrepresentations, however, having been made with regard to this affair in some of
the public papers, I think it proper to state that I am able positively to affirm from my own
personal knowledge, that the insurgents fired upon us from their intrenchments, without warning
or challenge, before a single shot was fired either by the troops or the police.
ï¿½ For several days previously this Gold Field had been in a state of open and undisguised
rebellion.
The insurgents were constantly parading in large bodies under arms, and carrying on a
systematic search for arms, horses, saddles, provisions, &c., which they took away without
payment, giving, in some instances, receipts in the name of the ? Commander in Chief of the
Diggers under Arms.? All work was at an end, the rebel leaders having given notice to the
miners that any one working without special permission from them would be shot.
Since their camp was stormed the aspect of affairs has completely changed. Shortly after
the engagement I rode up (accompanied by Mr. Commissioner Amos) to the scene of action, to


ascertain whether there were any unclaimed dead or wounded. I found there a crowd of several
hundred persons, apparently unarmed, from some of whom I learned that there were about half a
dozen dead and three wounded insurgents still lying on the ground. I promised to send up
medical assistance, and to have the dead removed and buried, at which they appeared to be
gratified. #
On my return to Camp this was done, and the dead were buried at the Cemetery. Two
soldiers who were killed were also buried there. A large number of persons assembled to witness
the funerals, some of whom volunteered to assist in filling the soldiers? graves.
A feeling of relief appeared to pervade the whole population at finding themselves suddenly
released from the reign of terror which had been established by the insurgents. Both troops and
police have behaved remarkably well throughout the whole of these disturbances.
Although quiet and order have been to a great degree restored (the miners having mostly
resumed work, and many licenses having been issued to-day), the vigilance of the garrison has
not been relaxed, nor would it be safe to do so until the arrival of reinforcements shall have
rendered an attack on the Camp utterly and clearly hopeless.
In order that the authority of the Government may be completely and permanently
re-established, it will be necessary most vigorously to follow up the blow that has been struck, by
thoroughly rooting out and dispersing the remnant of the rebel party. The force that will be at
the disposal of the Major General will, I have no doubt, be amply sufficient for this purpose.
I have, &c.,
(Signed) G. PASLEY.

The Colonial Secretary.

Colonial Secretary?s Office,
Melbourne, 5th December, 1854.
Sir,
I am commanded by the Lieutenant Governor to inform you, that he has perused your
Despatch dated 8rd December, 1854, to the Chief Commissioner of Gold Fields.
Since the period when His Excellency deemed it necessary to strengthen tlm Military
Detachment up to the present moment, His Excellency has had every reason to be satisfied with
the conduct of the officers and men belonging to the Ballaarat Gold Field.
His Excellency considers that you exercised a sound and wise discretion in attacking the
insurgents, instead of waiting until they were the aggressors, for thereby you destroyed the
prestige which invariably attaches itself to the force which obliges its opponents to maintain its
position, whilst the resources of the country are at the disposal of the former.
His Excellency desires me to convey to all the officers and men, civil and military, his
thanks for their zeal and ability, and especially to Captain Thomas, the officer commanding, for
the disposition of his small force.
Until the arrival of the Major General the prisoners must be kept at Ballaarat. You will
of course take such measures as will preclude the possibility of their escape; evidence should be
taken against them for having seditiously and treasonably met and opposed Her Majesty s Forces;
and they should be committed to Melbourne to take their trial at such Sessions of the Supreme
Court as the Attorney General may appoint.
A Proclamation has issued directing Martial Law to be enforced, but this will not affect
prisoners who committed offences prior to the 6th December, nor supersede the administration of
justice, save so far as such administration may interfere with the execution of Martial Law. The
prisoners should be transmitted to Melbourne as soon as the Major General considers sufficient
force for their safe escort can be spared.
Although Martial Law has been declared, you are to use every exertion to apprehend all
the speakers who took part at the meeting when the licenses were burnt, to which effect similar
instructions have been sent to all the other Gold Fields, but the warrants must of course emanate
from you, and be despatched to Castlemaine, to be from thence forwarded as the Besident Com-
missioner may deem advisable.
The Lieutenant Governor, having expressed his satisfaction at the course which the
authorities have pursued, and the success they have obtained in upholding law and order, deems it
his duty to call the particular attention of all the authorities to the exercise of moderation and
forbearance ) for as it was incumbent upon him and them to support the law, so will the public
voice ultimately be heard according to the mode in which the subsequent proceedings are
conducted.
His Excellency firmly relies that the officers will continue to merit his good opinion, as
well as that of the people of the Colony.
This letter is, of course, to be communicated to the Major General commanding.
I have, &c.,
(Signed.) JOHN FOSTER.
The Resident Commissioner,
Ballaarat.

Sir,
In compliance with His Excellency?s instructions, I yesterday called your attention to the
necessity of enjoining upon all under your control the propriety of forbearance, caution, and
temper towards the mining population.
I am again to repeat to you that His Excellency desires that the utmost moderation be
shewn.
Instructions will be sent to you directing you how to act concerning the disposal of the
prisoners.

Sir,
I have the honor, by direction of the Major General, to inform you, for the information of
His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor, that the troops under his command, guns, &c., arrived
here at two o?clock p.m. to-day, having left Ballan at two o?clock this morning.
The men arrived in first rate order, and there was not the slightest expression of feeling
during our progress through the centre of the diggings.
Every thing here appears quiet
The Major General has of course had no time to form any opinions. He acknowledges
receipt, on his route this morning, of His Excellency?s Despatch, enclosing the Proclamation.
Captain Thomas reports an exchange of shots with some of the sentries last night, but
nothing of importance.
