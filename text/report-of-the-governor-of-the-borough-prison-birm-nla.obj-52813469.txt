OF THE
GOVERNOR OF THE BOROUGH PRISON,
BIRMINGHAM.




REPORT
OF THE
Godernor of the prison,
BIRMINGHAM,
TO THE
JUSTICES IN QUARTER SESSIONS,
18 th October, 1850.
PRINTED BY ORDER OE THE VISITING JUSTICES.
BIRMINGHAM:
PRINTED BY W. GREW & SON, HIGH-STREET.
1850.


Since this Eeport was directed to be printed some slight additions
have been made to it to make the information contained in it more
comprehensive.— A. M.


REPORT, &c.
Within the quarter recently expired 148 male
adults, 28 juveniles, 56 women, and 3 girls were re-
ceived; and 132 male adults, 37 juveniles, 51 women,
and 6 girls were discharged. The entire number in
the prison at the close of the quarter was 153 male
adults, 32 juveniles, 56 women, and 10 girls—total,
251. And the highest number within the quarter was
263 on the 17th and 18th of August.
In accompanying tables nearly all desirable details
regarding the whole will be found slated, and also the
character of the work imposed on them. From the
nature of circumstances it has not been possible to
make this always hard labour, but it has been earnestly
sought to make it continuous.
Among other occupations specified will be found
that of grinding wheat. This is effected by hand-
mills, each worked by one man at a time in his cell.
There are six of them in the prison, which abundantly
supply the flour, or rather wheaten meal, required for
the consumption of the prisoners. Nothing is added
to or taken from it. It makes a coarse hut sufficiently
palatable bread; and the six mills supply easily the ne-
cessary quantity of flour for an average of about 270
prisoners.
The hours during which the prisoners are employed
are from six o’clock in the morning till six o’clock at


night, the time allowed for meals, chapel, and in rota-
tion instruction, being deducted. These hours are too
short; but unless w’e had a larger supply of cellular
labour, to make them longer would impose exces-
sive fatigue on the officers.
The routine of the prison has been the same in this
as in previous quarters. Every prisoner, whether male
or female, adult or juvenile, on first entering is kept
forty-eight hours in strict separation without work;
and afterwards fourteen days, or in the case of ju-
veniles while •performing a task equivalent to this, also
in separation but with cellular labour furnished to
them. In the case of re-committals this term, or the
task used as a measure instead of it, is doubled; and
by the men thus allotted to cellular labour, and those
guilty of prison offences, the mills and hard labour
cranks are kept at work.
The management of the male adults and females is
nearly the same as in other prisons. But that of the
boys somewhat differs from this; and being peculiar
in several respects, it seems expedient to speak of it in
some detail.
Its leading features are the introduction of tasks,
instead of time, in allotting the stages of punishment,
—the further charging those subjected to it specifically
in labour for their maintenance, besides all they do
towards the performance of their tasks, —and the intro-
duction of a form of wages to facilitate the computa-
tions thus required.
The first stage with the boys is thus not measured,
as on the adult side, by time (fourteen days), but they
are required to earn 100 marks in it, over and above
all deducted for their food, and any fines that may be
imposed on them for misconduct during the interval.


Their employments are various, as netting, knitting,
plaiting sinnett for mats, mat-making, webbing, clean-
ing, and so forth ; for which the wages (in marks) are
fixed by a table. Within certain narrow limits they
are allowed to choose their own scale of diet, but they
can only expend half the number of marks that they
earn daily in this way, and as indulgence even within
this limit must be paid for, and thus contributes to
prolong their detention in this most irksome stage of
their progress, a strong stimulus is constantly applied
to them to exert themselves to earn marks—to restrain
their appetites, to economize them—and to behave well
not otherwise to forfeit them. And the same process
being continued through successive stages, in each of
which 100 marks must equally be earned in order to
acquire progressive advantages, the same virtues are
beiiig constantly exercised, and become gradually
habitual. The result in detail is necessarily various,
according to temper and abilities. Yet that, on the
whole, it has been remarkably beneficial will, I think,
appear certain from the following facts.
During the six months in which the system has been
in operation the mode of dieting according to exertion,
and not according to sentence, so far from having been
expensive, has caused a small economy, the value of
what the boys have actually had (£B7. 11s. Id.) being
£l. 12s. fid. less than what they were entitled to
by their sentences (£B9. 3s. fid.)—The stimulus to
exertion thus afforded has at the same time proved
so efficacious, that among the prison earnings for
the year the sum of £65. 12s. lOd. has been credited
to the Juvenile Department within the six months
in question beyond the cost of the materials used,
and irrespective of that of the necessary tools.—


Further, of the 48 boys discharged in the two first
quarters, before the plan was introduced, nine were
re-committed before their expiration, and seven more
were returned before the end of the immediately en-
suing one—making in all one in every three discharged;
—while in the two last quarters, daring which this
system has been in operation, of 94 boys discharged
only eight have as yet returned, (of whom one for
trial may yet be found not guilty*) being only one in
12-13—a difference for which it seems impossible to
account, but upon the principle of superior manage-
ment.—And lastly, as the tendency of a good system
of prison discipline should be to check first, as well as
renewed committals, in this particular also there are
striking facts to adduce. In the two months between
the opening of the Gaol, 19th Oct., and Ist Jan. last,
36 boys were committed—in the second quarter, 58 —
in the third, 52—and in the fourth, only 28. While
the number of hoys tried at the Recorder’s four first
Sessions within the year, was 14, 9, 10, and 14 re-
spectively; at the last Sessions it was only one; and
though four are now committed for the present Ses-
sions, even this is a great reduction from the previous
numbers.
I attribute this success, then, partly to the extreme
importance that I attach to the object of improving
the boys through their punishment, and partly to the
means that I employ to attain this. They hear so
much, of reform while in the prison, that gradually
it becomes an object with themselves. They begin to
think it both possible and desirable, better than per-
severance in. evil. Their habits of idleness being mean-
while interrupted, under the influence of strong selfish
* Eventually the bill against him was thrown <mt by the Gfrand Jury.


motives others of voluntary exertion are substituted
for them ; and the first disagreeableness of these being
overcome, they begin at length even to like them.
Their capabilities are thus also cultivated. I do not
teach any of them trades. I have not the means, nor
scarcely the desire, to do so ; but I put all of them in
succession to every different employment that I can
think of. I thus make them generally handy; and
while enlarging their minds, this gives them at the
same time confidence in their own powers of turning
to any thing. Their young ambition is thus awakened.
They begin to look upward instead of downward, their
emulation being excited to rise, rather than again fall.
Their influence on each other becomes thus beneficial,
instead of injurious; and it operates in a degree on
those not as yet committed as well as on themselves.
I have had some very pleasing individual proofs of
# this. I generally take the address of those who leave
me, and enquire about them afterwards; and the
father and step-mother of one boy, besides speaking in
the highest terms of his own improvement, have named
to my warder three others, his companions, whom he
has induced to leave the streets, and take to steady
labour. Another friend of his makes this number
five ; nor is his a solitary, though an extreme, instance
of similar conduct. I have two brothers placed with
one master, and both now giving entire satisfaction—
one of whom had been previously once, and the other
twice, re-committed. # I could cite others to the like
effect, and all specifically pledged to give good advice,
* I am sorry to say that since the above was written the eldest of
these boys has left both Ms brother and master. Though receiving Bs. a
week wages, ho left professedly to get more elsewhere. He is the one
who has been already twice in prison, and I now fear may come again,
though I may in tMs do him injustice.


as well as themselves exhibit good conduct. While,
lastly, the course pursued with the whole, though thus
beneficial to themselves, could not be pourtrayed by
them to others in a captivating light, even if they
wished to do so. To live on coarse brown bread and
water, unless they work for better, is a prospect which
an idle profligate hoy can never be persuaded to think
an advantageous one. It may result in his good; but
while yet unreclaimed, he will not appreciate this.
He will not desire to be put to any such school.
It may be said, however, that many of the effects
above specified have been produced by a favourable
state of trade and season; and it cannot be doubted
that by this other causes have been much aided. Yet
there has been no similar diminution in the committals
and re-committals of either adult males or females;
but, on the contrary, in the latter especially a steady
progressive increase. Thus, of men, the number of
committals in the four successive quarters in the year
has been 149, 147, 142, and 148 respectively, and of
re-committals 4,6, 9 and 13 respectively. Of women,
the number of committals has been 53, 55, 41 and 59
respectively, and of re-committals, in the first quarter
none, in the second 5, in the third 4, and in the last
11. And while 33 men and 11 women have come in
since the end of the quarter, only 2 boys have been
similarly sent—one, a helpless lad of 16, wanting a
hand, brought in for trial; the other, a child of 9 years
of age, brought up by his own parents for inveterate
habits of idleness and vagrancy. The cure is sharp
for so young an offender.

The present being the end not merely of a Quarter
but also of the first year since the gaol was opened, and
being further the period when a variety of statistical
returns are required for the information of Her
Majesty’s Government, some of the most important
are selected to be herewith annexed. And a few ob-
servations on them may increase their interest, though
being the first of their kind taken here, conclusions
drawn from them are necessarily vague and uncertain.
Their value will grow in proportion as they may be
persevered in.
1. —The number of married committed is not on the
whole above half the number of single; and among
the re-committals, only two men and two women have
been married out of the whole number throughout the
year. The inference is strong, that the married state
is a preservative against crime in all circumstances,
but especially so, when the loss and misery entailed on
families by punishment have been once experienced.
2. —Of boys committed, almost twice as many
have had parents living as have had none; and
the disproportion has been still greater among the re-
committals. May it not be inferred, that the early
responsibility cast on orphans is a more favourable
circumstance than the possession of idle, careless, or
ill-judging parents ? Very nearly the two least hope-
ful boys that have been discharged have each parents
living, the one unreasonably severe, the other carelessly
indulgent. And a third, now a transport, but, as I
think, still very hopeful, was allowed to grow wild in
the charge of servants, without other care taken of
him by his parents than to feed him.


3. Not quite a half of all the prisoners committed
have been born in Birmingham ; but the proportion is
much greater among the re-committals. The next
greatest number has been from the agricultural
counties in the neighbourhood, which, seem to supply
the greatest number in particular of women on the
town, 64 males and 28 females have come from
Ireland, of whom only one of each has been re-
committed. A very few have come from Scotland ;
and 8 male adults have been foreigners: but of
neither of these classes have any returned.
4. —I have found the state of education among all
low rather in quality than quantity. A great many
read and write imperfectly ; and I bare been much
struck also with the length of time that most seem to
liave passed at their respective schools, though with
little profit. Thus, of 177 males now in the prison, 9
have been from six to twelve years at school; 46 more
have been from three to six years; and 43 more from
one to three years. While, of 64 females, 32 have
been from one year up to six ; yet scarcely any write
what may he called a good hand, and their proficiency
in arithmetic only in very few cases exceeds the first
four Rules.
5 It is unnecessary to state that the amount of
their religious instruction is very low'. It is seldom in
any degree either comprehensive or intelligent, still
more rarely cateehismal, and never apparently practi-
cally applied. It is remarkable indeed, how much
both of the sentiments and phraseology of religion is
to be found among them, combined with the most utter
disregard and apparent insensibility to its precepts.


As an example, on the very day in which I write this
I have opened two letters, one from an ill-conducted
mother to a worse conducted son, bidding him be of
good cheer under his affliction, for that “ God has
promised to be a father to the fatherless, and a husband
to the widow,” —the other, from a husband just
brought in under a charge of aggravated theft, bidding
his wife “be of good comfort under his misfortune, for
it was God’s will, and must be done.’’ Nor are these
expressions, I am confident, used in mockery. They
are genuine enough while being actually used. But it
is to be feared from these and many similar examples,
that even when religion is taught to the lower classes,
it is generally addressed too much to their head and
too little to their conscience; it is expounded too much
as a species of knowledge, and too little as a guide of
conduct. We are probably all of us apt in like man-
ner to appropriate the promises of Scripture without
regard to the conditions on which alone they are held
out; and from what I have seen of prisoners, both here
and elsewhere, I believe that in their class this delu-
sion is carried to an extreme. Their consciences
become so seared by long addiction to their several
vices, and so reconciled to them by their being,
for the most part, their only means of support, that
they cease to look on them as bars to the Divine
favour at all, —in this, unfortunately, resembling many
better taught, who regard with equal indulgence their
own addiction to other familiar, and yet forbidden,
indulgences.
6.—1 here, however, insert a Table, slightly altered
from one laid before the late Committee of the House
of Commons on Prison Discipline, by Mr. Neison,


the distinguished actuary, who lias paid more attention
to criminal statistics than any man of the day.
Besides conveying much interesting information, not
otherwise generally known, it will enable me to point
out the peculiarities in the movement of crime during
the past year in Birmingham much more distinctly
than I could do without it to collate them with.
7. -This Table gives the age and sex of all criminals
who have been tried before assizes or quarter sessions,
or have been summarily convicted, or been re-com-
mitted to any gaol in England and Wales within the
nine years between 1839 and 1847 inclusive. It may
be relied on as strictly correct with regard to prisoners
tried before assizes and quarter sessions; but Magis-
trates’ Courts not being Courts of Record, account is
only taken of those convicted in them, and, conse-
quently, afterwards committed. A vast amount of
offence must thus escape unnoticed altogether, the
parties being discharged through deficient evidence, or
other cause. And of re-committals the record must
be scarcely less defective, many individuals not being
recognized through change of name, place, or other
circumstance.
8. —From this Table, then, it appears that the pro-
portion of female to male offence, tried before assizes
and quarter sessions during the nine years specified,
has been throughout the kingdom about I in 11£,
among the summarily convicted 1 in 3|, and taken
collectively, 1 in That at Birmingham has been
before the Sessions 1 in 2|, among the summarily con-
victed lin 4|, and taken collectively, lin 3|. There
is a singular want of agreement with each other in

these proportions, that of female crime tried at Sessions
having been here highest, whereas elsewhere it is
lowest; and the collective proportion may also seem
high. But when all circumstances are considered, this
last will not appear excessive, the proportion of female
crime being always larger in towns than in agricul-
tural districts.
9. —Among female re-committals, on the other hand,
the proportion is rather in favour of Birmingham. Thus,
the ratio throughout the kingdom has been over the
nine years as 1 in 2| ; while here it has been almost
lin 3. And this result, I cannot help flattering my-
self, has been, in part, owing to the efforts used by
members of my family, and some charitable friends,
to disperse and otherwise assist the more promising of
those discharged,
10. —lt next appears, from Mr. Nelson’s Table, that
the proportion of male juvenile to male adult offence
throughout the kingdom is, at assizes and sessions, as
Ito 7; in summary convictions, as Ito 6|; and in
re-committals, as Ito 6f. But here our experience of
Birmingham is very unfavourable indeed. Before the
sessions, the boys tried have been as lin 4f; in sum-
mary convictions, they have been as lin 3|; and in
re-committals, no fewer than 1 in If. Yet it will he
seen, from the Tables previously inserted, that this
excess is mainly due to the early period of the year.
Of the 24 boys who have been re-committed in all
only five were discharged within the last six months.
The remainder left the prison before the existing
system was established; and the boys now in the
prison (24) are only as 1 in 6 of the male adults
in it.


11. —The proportion of prisoners known here to
have been in other prisons before, is below what is
given in the Table for the average of the kingdom.
It is 178 out of 968, or not more than 1 in s§; while
Mr. iNeison considers it to be much understated gene-
rally as I in 3. But I have no confidence in any
specific numbers given on this head. Prisoners,
wherever they have an interest, will evade speaking
the truth in this matter; and circumstances have
occurred within the year to make me certain that, in
many instances, both males and females have been
previously in prison, who, when they came in, denied
it.
12. —ln glancing cursorily over this Table, it may
appear to some that the culminating point of crime,
the age when it is most prevalent, is shown by it to
be between 21 and 30, a great increase being then
seen in the value of the figures. But it must be
observed that tbe previous columns only embrace two
and three years each, while this embraces nine, and all
the following ones ten years. When severally divided
by 2,3, 9 and 10, corresponding to the number of
years included in them, the great excess will, in every
case, be found between 17 and 21 ; To make which
more evident 3 subjoin a Table showing the average
commitments annually in each period. *

13. —I have studied, with much care, the particulars
regarding the re-committals to our own prison ; and
have given a Table showing the first offences, and also
the first sentences of them all. But I cannot find any
general rule, or even striking coincidence, among
them. Offences of vagrancy, in a slight degree, pre-
dominate; hut there are more whose first sentence
was one, two, and three months, than for any shorter
period.
14. —The great number of re-committals that appears
in these Tables ought to be a subject of very anxious
consideration to the public. It is certain that even
thus they are greatly understated; and Mr. Nelson,
besides assenting generally to this conclusion, suggests
a proof of it at once curious, striking, and it may be
considered conclusive. Looking at the total num-
ber of trials, and subtracting the acknowledged re-
committals from them, he finds the balance so great,
of criminals supposed annually to enter the lists of
crime for the first time, that, taking the ordinary
chances of life and death among them, they will
amount, in forty years, to 1,473,840 males above the
age of twelve years, or a full fourth of the total male
population in England and Wales similarly circum-
stanced, who will have been at least once in prison
within that time under a criminal charge. And this
result he justly thinks so absurd that he uses it as
a demonstration that many more are re-committed
annually than are detected, or thus appear in any
Tables.
offence rises with advancing years; shewing, with the usually high propor-
tion of female re-committals, how much more difficult it is for women
to recover themselves than men, and how much more charitable agency
is required to assist them while yet there is hope.


16,- — A. great number of re-committals necessarily
demonstrates a great deficiency of reformatory agency
in tlie treatment to which prisoners are subjected when
first committed. But, besides this, it must greatly
increase the number of first offences, for individuals
■who come gradually to live by crime are always on
tie watch to induce others, unknown to the police, to
assist them, in their depredations ; and, further, it must
greatly deepen the character of the offences com-
mitted. Nemo repente turpissivms; and the searing
effect of a long sustained controversy with the law' in
reconciling to the most desperate extremities is only
too well known. There can thus be little doubt that
the gangs of burglars, and other violent depredators,
now becoming, unhappily, so daring and common,
mainly consist of discharged prisoners, and those who
habitually consort with them. And the recurrence of
their acts would be, probably, more checked by the
Introduction of really reformatory discipline into our
prisons, thereby catting off tbeir own supply, than by
any other apparently more direct precaution.
16.—The experience of the boys’ management
in Birmingham Prison has been short, and the ex-
periment in itself has been but imperfectly made.
The great principle of Task Sentences has, in particu-
lar, only been approached in the matter of diet, a low,
and even in some respects deteriorating stimulus, be-
cause it cultivates a desire for self-indulgence, even
while immediately stimulating self-denial, —it is like
encouraging children by sweetmeats, a well-known
means of only imperfectly attaining the object. Yet
so superior is any form of motive to mere obedience as
a stimulus, that it has been signally successful, and


no part of this result is so valuable or interesting as that
above detailed, showing that the reform of the boys in
the prison sensibly checked the flow of others towards it.
And if the lesson thus afforded is but duly improved,
it may eventually be productive of very important con-
sequences, by impressing on society that its selfish
interests are not less identified with the improvement
of its criminals than its Christian obligations,—that
really to check crime the true policy is to subordinate
every thing in the management of Prisons to the
moral and industrial reform of their existing inmates,
—that for such purpose we must furnish motives,
religious and other, for their guidance, and not merely
issue commands, —and that the special aim of those
immediately over them should be to try to gain,
direct, and, if possible, permanently elevate their wills,
and not merely temporarily constrain and exercise
their obedience. No principle of Prison Discipline
would be found at once so wise or so practical as
this. It is its absence that has caused so many past
failures. The forms of constraint, not without impor-
tance in their place, pass into insignificance beside
it. Good servants, but bad masters, they have a moral
value only in so far as they are subordinated to it.
