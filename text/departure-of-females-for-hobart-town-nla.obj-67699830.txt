HOUSE OF LORDS, Thursday, May 1.
Prayers were read to-day shortly after one, by which time
nearly forty peers were assembled, to go up with the Address
to the King, to'which the house had unanimously come the
preceding day.
The etiquette is, upon occasions of this nature, for the peers
who form the body presenting an Address to appear in the
House of Lords in the court dress which they wear when in
the presence of the King, so that the house this morning pre-
sented an unusually gay appearance, as all the peers present
who hold commissions in the army, navy, or yeomanry corps,
wore their respective uniforms; and those peers who are
members of the Privy Council, but who are not of the naval
or military professions, appeared in the Privy Council dress.
Some few, being neither the one nor the other, appeared in the
ordinary court dress. Several noble lords wore also the rib-
bons and collars of the Orders of which they are members.
It was remarked, by some of the oldest officers about the
house that on no occasion, on the assembling for the presenta-
tion of an Address, had they seen so many members of the
House of Lords collected to form the body about to present
the Address in question to his Majesty.
The following peers were the chief of those composing the
body :?The Lord Chancellor, Earl Grey, the Earl of Ripoa,
Viscount Melbourne, Lord Auckland, the Duke of Richmond,
the Marquis of Lansdowne (as Lord President), the Duke of
Norfolk (as Earl Marshal), the Duke of Wellington, the Duke
of Sutherland, Lord Plunkett (as Lord Chancellor of Ireland),
the Archbishop of York, the Archbishop of Cashel, the Bishop
of Hereford, the Bishop of Derry, the Duke of Gordon, Earl
Mulgrave, Earl Amherst, the Earl of Shaftesbury, the
Marquis of Westmeath, Lord Denbigh, the Marquis of Tho-
nioad, the Marquis of Headfort, the Earl of Coventry, the
Duke of Beaufort, the Earl of Limerick, the Earl of Leitrim,
the Earl of Charlemont, Lord Prudhoe, and the Earl o.
Rosslyn.
About a quarter past one the names of the peers who at-
' tended to go up with the address were called over by Mr.
Pulmand, the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod, in the order
of rank which they bear, commencing with the barons, and
closing with the Lord Chancellor. Their lordships quitted
the house in the order in which they were called; some of
them to whom the higher rank is given in the above pa-
ragraph having seats in that house only as barons.
They then proceeded to St. James?s, and the house was ad-
journed until five o?clock, when Lord WYNFORD presided
a short time, the Lord Chancellor not having then returned.
Lord MONTAGUE presented a petition for the protection
of the Established Church.
The Bishop of LINCOLN presented several petitions from
parishes in Leicestershire and Lincolnshire, for the better ob-
servance of the Sabbath.
The Archbishop of CANTERBURY, on presenting a si-
milar petition from the inhabitants of Lambeth, and another
place, alluded to the rejection of Sir Andrew Agnew?s bill, in
the Commons, on the preceding uighe. The most rev. prelate
said he was very anxious to see some measure upon the
subject carried, and no one could doubt that there was a ge-
neral call in the country for one; it might be said, indeed, in
reference to the opinions of the public, that the voice of the
people was the voice of God; and he trusted that a bill
would be introduced, and would receive the sanction of the
legislature.
Lord WYNFORD said that he had, about two months
back, given notice of a motion to bring in a bill upon the
subject, but on finding that one had been introduced else-
where, he thought it right not to proceed in the matter. The
object of his bill, however, was, as we understood, to abolish
Sunday trading. It went to that extent only.
The Bishop of DURHAM and the Bishop of EXETER?
the latter of whom expressed his concurrence in the senti-
ments which had fallen from the most rev. prelate, presented
several similar petitions from parishes in their dioceses.
COUWTY RATES.
The Marquis of SALISBL?RY rose to complain of a simi-
lar thing to that which had given rise to the complaint made
by liis noble friend near him (Lord Wharncliffe) on a former
evening, respecting the expenses to which a part of the county
of York had been put, by paying the expenses caused for
making out certain returns, relative to turnpike trusts, or-
dered by parliament. Now lie (the Marquis of Salisbury)
assured the noble viscount opposite that the complaint was
almost universal, and something out to be done to remove
the hardship. He knew of instances in the county of Hert-
ford where such was felt to be the case.
Viscount MELBOURNE was aware that complaints had
been made, and that it was a subject which deserved the se-
rious consideration of parliament.
Lord WHARNCLIFFE doubted whether the magistrates
had the power to order the payment for such returns out of
the county rates. (Hear.)

highly injurious to the merits of the University. Now if
religious instruction was to form no part of the education of
youth, if the divine doctrines, upon which our happiness here
and hereafter depended, were to be disregarded in institu-
tions of the nature alluded to, the consequences must be most
injurious. It was true that religion was a question between
man and his Maker, and it was equally true as respected a
nation. Then how important was it that ministers should
exercise all their influence to preserve religion in the country.
He felt that he was trespassing upon the time of their lord-
ships, or he would say much upon this topic. Education
ought to be based upon religious principles, and wherever it
was not it became a curse rather than a blessing. The sys-
tem of education for the last 20 years had been in this coun-
try to lose sight of religion rather than cherish it, from the
establishment of the Mechanics? Institute to the London Uni-
versity. Sucli a system as this must of necessity lead to scep-
ticism. He would maintain that the system of popular edu-
cation which had been so steadily pursued, through the agency
of certain individuals who had distinguished themselves in
this way for the last twenty years, from places denominated
Mechanics? Institutions to others denominated Universities,
was based upon no fixed religious principle, and had a direct
tendency thereby to promote scepticism and infidelity. The
noble earl concluded by moving that the petition be read.
The petition was then read, and ordered to L lie on the
table.
ANSWER TO THE ADDRESS.
The LORD CHANCELLOR acquainted the house that he
and their lordships, together with the other house, had this
day, pursuant to a resolution of their lordships and the other
house of parliament, proceeded to wait upon his Majesty with
the Address which they had agreed to upon the subject of
the Union of the Legislatures of Great Britain and Ireland,
and that his Majesty was graciously pleased to accept the
same: to which he had been pleased to return the following
answer ;
<� It is with great satisfaction I receive your Address,
stating your determination to maintain inviolate the Legis-
lative Union of the two countries, which, I perfectly agree
with you, is essential to the safety, peace, and integrity of
the British empire. I shall use the powers that are by law
intrusted to me to put down and repress all attempts, by
whomsoever made, to sever my dominions. I look back
with satisfaction to the salutary laws which have for a series
of years been passed to remedy the grievances which affected
my Irish subjects, and have resolved to continue to remove,
from time to time, all just causes of complaint.?
Earl GREY then moved that the Address of their Lord-
ships, together with his Majesty?s gracious Answer thereto,
should be printed in the usual way. The motion was agreed
to.
LIVERPOOL BRIBERY BILL.
The Earl of RADNOR rose to move the order of the day
for the second reading of the Liverpool Freemen Disfran-
chisement Bill. The noble lord said he moved it with the
understand the same course would be followed in this
instance, and the same privilege granted as to being heard by
counsel at the bar of that house, as had been conceded on the
representation of the noble and learned baron (Wynford) to
the electors of Warwick in the case of the bill for their dis-
franchisement.
The Earl of ELDON said he was glad to hear that the
same course was intended to be followed in the case of the
Liverpool freemen as had been granted in the case of the
freemen of Warwick, and that the parties who were sought
by this bill to be disfranchised should appear by their coun-
sel at the bar of the house. Had the house refused this highly
reasonable request on the part of either of the petitioners, it
would have been so gross a violation, or rather disregard of
their duty as a judicial body, that they might as well have
determined at once to fealk out of the house. The noble
earl then proceeded to examine the bill, which he said pro-
ceeded in 1834 to legislate upon a discovery that in the
case of an election at Liverpool in 1830 there had been com-
mitted by certain persons there acts of bribery or corruption.
Long ago as these acts had occurred, it was to be presumed
that they had not been found out till recently, or the bill
would have been concocted before 1834. Well, upon this
pretext this bill was brought into the House of Commons
tor disfranchising, not the persons who had been guilty of
the offence with which a part of the constituency had been
char ged, but the whole of the freemen of Liverpool, born or
unborn. If it went to disfranchise the guilty, the principle
would be understood, hut no one could consistently reconcile
to his conscience the disfranchisement by this bill of ail free-
men yet unborn, whose rights were not the less to be re-
spected because, as freemen, they were as yet inchoate free-
men. That such a bill as this was ever brought into parlia-
ment before he must utterly deny. He had heard Mr. Fox
say, when Lord Chief Justice Xvlansfield stated that the laws
in existence on the subject of bribery and corruption were
sufficient, in his estimation, to preserve the purity of the
House of Commons, if duly enforced, (C I cannot consent to
disfranchise men for corruption under these circumstances,
the Reform Bill, but he should recollect that those proceed-
ings had been commenced before the Reform Bill was brought
in. The first Liverpool Disfranchisement BUI was brought in
before the Reform Bill, and proceeded j/aci passu with that bill,
and at the time the Reform Bill was not considered to be a
remedy for the evils which the bill before their lordships was
proposed to be applied to. It was afterwards withdrawn, upon
the express understanding that it was to be renewed in the
following session. The bill under discussion was the bill thus
renewed. With respect to the expenses he should only observe
that the corporation of Liverpool was well able to bear them,
having at their disposal an income of 98,0001. per annum. If,
upon the examination of witnesses at the bar, it should ap-
pear to their lordships that the bill ought not to pass, they
would, of course, reject it; hut he hoped that they would not
reject it without hearing the evidence, uncramped by confin-
ing it to the last election.
Ihe Duke of RICHMOND said that their lordships would
be placed in great difficulty if theyconfined the examination to
what took place at the iastelcction ; for if there should then
appear to he grounds for disfranchising some of the freemen,
their lordships must proceed to do so, while great numbers,
who were still more guilty, would be suffered to escape. For
his own part, he should object to disfranchise a single indivi-
dual who was not proved to have been guilty of bribery. He
would not only punish the party bribed, but he would dis-
franchise the party bribing also, and show him up as an ex-
ample to ail others. (Hear, hear.) There was some excuse
to be found for the party accepting a bribe, for he was gene-
rally poor, and was tempted by having his rent or some other
debt to pay, and was apt not to think that very criminal
which he was asked to do by those whom he was in the habit
of looking up to; but there was no excuse whatever for the
individual who was base enough to tempt a man to an act
which was so contrary to law. Hestated these his opinions as
an individual peer, and not as a member of the government ?
for the bill before their lordships was not a government bill.'
He hoped his noble friend would pursue the course that
had been adopted on former occasions?to prove all that he
could prove to be guilty of bribery, and then to place their
names in the bill. He should, therefore, vote for the motion
of his noble friend. (Lord Radnor.)
Lord WYNFORD said he concurred in every word that
had fallen from the noble duke. He was not prepared hy
any means to throw out such a hill as the present; on the
contrary, their lordships would, he trusted, send it to a full
inquiry. (Hear, hear). This would be the true way of
doing away with the popular clamour, which would impute
to their lordships that they were the protectors of corrup-
tion. If a case of corruption could be made out he should
be amongst the very first to vote for transferring the fran-
chise. It was, therefore, distressing to him not to be able
to vote with his noble friend (Lord Wharncliffe). The
House of Commons had sent up that bill, in which they
stated that gross and notorious bribery and corruption had
been proved to have long prevailed at the election. He
would, then, ask their lordships if they would be acting
with a proper regard to their character, if) when such a
bill tame before them, they, would not inquire into the
allegations, or if they attempted to cripple such inquiry ?
They should have the fullest inquiry in the first in-
stance, and afterwards consider the length to which the evi-
dence would suffer their lordships to proceed. For his own
part he had not altered his opinion of the Reform Bill it
might have done some good, but he had never heard that it
was to operate as a statute of limitations. (Hear.) He
thought that after the examination of witnesses he should not
be able to agree to this bill, but he would agree to one that
would be more effectual. He thought that the name of the
party proved to have bribed a voter should be stuck upon a
board, as a warning to others how they interfered in corrupt-
ing the common people. He would also not only deprive
such a person of his franchise, hut he would prevent him ever
acquiring the franchise again in any part of the kingdom.
(Hear, hear.) There was one fact,?however, which would
induce him to go farther. Would any noble lord say that
the freemen only of Liverpool were corrupt ? Was it not in
proof that two or three hundred of the householders were
equally so ? And surely one measure of justice ought not t�
be dealt out to the freemen and another to the householders.
They should, therefore, go on to examine if there was
not enough to disqualify the lower class of householders,
who knew no other value for a vote than that for w'hich
it would sell. He always thought the qualification ?should
not he the same in all cases, and he had contended that,
in Liverpool the franchise should be higher than !oi. He
always thought it absurd to give votes to those who only
wanted to sell.
The Earl of WINCHILSEA concurred entirely with what
had fallen from the noble duke (Richmond), and should give
his support to the motion of the noble earl (Radnor) ; but
would not be understood as thereby pledging himself to sup-
port the bill.
The Marquis of SALISBURY suggested that they should

office. He was only anxious to provide that at future elec-
tions men should know that they elected members of parlia-
ment on the understanding that if they accepted office they
did so without affecting their seats. He admitted that this
would deprive the people of a valuable privilege. (Cheers.)
At the same time he must observe that great inconvenience
had arisen under the present system. (Hear, hear.) Look
to what had lately taken place. (Cheers.) He did not
hesitate to admit that the government had been subjected
to great inconvenience. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member,
however, was wrong in stating that Sir J. Hobhouse had
been unseated for accepting the office of Secretary for Ire-
land. It was on voluntarily resigning afterwards, and
again seeking the suffrages of his constituents, that he
was rejected. True, the Attorney General had lost his seat
in consequence of his change of office, and he (the Chancellor
of the Exchequer) was prepared to say, this was a great in-
convenience to government. One of the arguments strongly
urged by the opponents of the Reform Bill, he well remem-
bered, was the inconvenience which would result from the
change of ministerial offices ; and it had been then suggested
to them that they ought to introduce provisions for some
such arrangement as that contemplated by his hon. friend.
Now this might be right, or it might not be right, but from
circumstances it was quite impossible to think of it at the
time. Now, however, tiie question they had to consider was,
whether the inconvenience to the government, from the ab-
sence of the Attorney General, was sufficient to justify
them in agreeing to such a measure. (Here an honour-
able member observed, ? And in the absence of a Lord
of the Admiralty.?) He certainly could not say that the
absence of a junior Lord of the Admiralty was any
very serious evil, but certainly the fact of the Attor-
ney General not having a seat in the house was a great
inconvenience to the government, and, he might add, to the
public; and if, in the course of events, this inconvenience
should happen to increase?if many members of the govern-
ment were upon vacating their seats on changing office to be
excluded from the House of Commons, he considered that it
would be necessary for them to examine whether it would not
he better to make some change in the present law, rather
than so great an inconvenience should be suffered to con-
tinue. It might, perhaps, he thought that this was a
proposition on which a member of the government ought
not to come forward; he was only anxious to say, that
while he admitted the inconvenience to be great at pre-
sent, it should be proved to be very great before any such
step as that recommended by either of the hon, members
should be taken. (Cheers.) He was one of those who had
changed his opinion as to the expediency of members
of the government having seats in that house. There
was a period of his life when he would have excluded
members of administrations from the house altogether.
(Cheers and laughter.) He assured the house that he
had not altered his opinions in consequence ofattaining office.
(A laugh.) The tenure oi place was not to serve an object
of any great gratification. (Laughter.) Nor did he care if
anything should occur to-morrow which might have the
effect of depriving him of office. (So we understood the noble
lord.) He now considered that the effect of removing minis-
ters from the iiouse would be exceedingly mischievous in
diminishing their responsibility. They all knew that the
legal responsibility of a minister was not great, but the actual
responsibility was very considerable. Ministers were bound
to sit in that house, liable to all manner of attacks and accu-
sations ; and if they had not a good defence to offer, public
opinion would be against them, and their characters would
suffer. This, he maintained, was a great responsibility
and it would be much diminished unless ministers were
present to hear and reply to charges preferred against them.
Therefore it was he did not believe that a man could hold
his situation with any credit to himself or with credit to the
country unless he were allowed by his constituents to take his
place in that house. It had been contended, that although,
a man might be rejected by one constituency, he might
be returned by another, but he (the Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer) declared that in his opinion, unless the old con-
stituency would return their member on accepting office, no
remedy could be procured by an appeal to a foreign consti-
tuency ; and he certainly must submit that the inconvenience
they were now suffering might so extend that at a future time
the house might find it expedient to adopt some such propo-
sition as that recommended by his hon. friend.
Sir R. HERON said he was not arrogant enough to place
his own opinion in opposition to that of his friends, and there-
fore he would withdraw his motion.

member, regretted that lie could not defer his motion on the
subject. He. wished the commissioners of education to follow
up their plan on a more extensive scale than their present
limited means enabled them to do. In Ireland there were
not at present more than 1500 schools in active operation
for the education of the entire population. The propor-
tion of educated persons in other countries was most strik-
ing?the proportion in America was one in every four; in
Nor way and Sweden one in every seven; and in Germany
one in every nine; while in Ireland the proportion was at
this moment only one in every forty persons of the whole
population. To the want of education might, in his judg-
ment, be attributed much of the crime and many of the ca-
lamities which had made Ireland wretched and miserable.
The p opie, for want of education, became brutal, savage,
and more difficult of rule, control, and government. He
should, in order to remedy this great evil?this bane to the
happiness of the country?propose that not less than 3500
schools should be established, and that in every parish a
library should be opened for the improvement and benefit of
persons more advanced in life ; and to carry this object into
effect he should not ask for the aid of one shilling from the
British legislature, though he was aware it would require a
large sum of money. If, however, he could show that the
Irish Church Establishment, in the enjoyment of tithes, were
bound to keep up and maintain schools for the education
of the people in Ireland, the difficulty on the score of expense
was overcome. In proof of the position he maintained he
wouid refer to a statute still unrepealed passed in the 28th
year of Henry VIII., by which it was provided that every
clergyman on being inducted to a living was bound to take
an oath that he would maintain a school for the education of
the population of his parish. Now it appeared from returns
that had been laid before the house, that there were in Ire-
land no less than 744 parishes in which there were no
churches, and 150 benefices in which no service had been per-
formed for the last three years, and of these the revenues
would be more than sufficient for the education of the Irish
people. Such an appropriation, he contended, would not be
any contradiction of the original intent of the grant of this
property to the Protestant church. He, however, did not
purpose solely to apply to the revenues of the parishes and
benefices so circumstanced, but rather by the contribution of
an average sum of 201. per annum from each parish, the
contribution varying of course according to its extent and
consequent resources, he would raise an ample sum for
the purposes so much to be desired. The number of pa-
rishes in Ireland was about 2400, the payment annually by
which, of the sum he had mentioned, would raise a sura of
48,0001., and thereby make unnecessary the parliamentary
grant estimated at present at 44,5001. annually. Ot the
advantages of education in a country it was superfluous,
after the testimony of such distinguished individuals as Dr.
Chalmers, Bell, Lancaster, Dr. Doyle, and Lord Brougham,
for him to speak. The lion, member concluded by moving,
u That a select committee be appointed to devise means for
extending the present system of education in Ireland, by
establishing one or more national schools in every parish,
and a model or normal school in each province of that coun-
try, without any grant from parliament; and therein to
inquire whether, in the first place, sufficient funds may not
be derived from the ecclesiastical tithes in Ireland, ivithoiit
injury to religion, to provide for the education of the poor ;
and, secondly, whether such appropriation of a part of this
property would be in accordance with the ancient usage
accompanying its possession, and with several acts of the
legislature.?
Mr. RICHARDS, in seconding the motion, observed that
he attributed the non-attendance of members on the present
occasion to their confidence in the government carrying into
effect the terms of the address which had that day been car-
ried up to the throne?namely, that they entertained the be-
neficent intention to consent to any measure proposed for the
amelioration ofthe condition of the people of Ireland. He
concurred with the lion, member for Waterford in thinking
that a portion of the enormous wealth of the Irish church
establishment?an establishment kept up for the benefit of a
privileged aristocracy?might well be appropriated to the
education of the poorer classes of the country.
Mr. LITTLETON conceived that the appearance of the
house, in point of attendance of members, rather argued the
feeling of the majority, that the discussion of the subject of
the present motion was rather inexpedient, though he was
himself the last man who would say that the question of the
education of the community was unimportant. If there
was one subject more than another to which he had given his
most anxious attention, it was that of education, and there
had been no measure which during his career he had sup-
ported with so much zeal as the system of national education
introduced into Ireland by his right hon. friend the Secretary
for the Colonies. However strong his impressions in favour
of that system had been prior to his visiting Ireland, they
were still more increased since he had had the opportunity
of personally ascertaining the results which had followed its
adoption. In short, within the lapse of the very short pe-
riod since the measure had been in operation, no less than
143,000 children were now enjoying the benefits of a national
education. (Hear, hear.) This was, in point of fact, only
a preparative step towards a more extensive system, calculated
to be of paramount importance to society generally in Ire-
land. He should not trespass on the house, but it was evi-
dent what the feeling of Irish members was, from their ab-
sence ; but he shqjild move the previous question.
Mr. F. O?CONNOR observed, that the reason why some
Irish members were not present was, that they deemed it pre-
mature, there being a motion on the subject to-morrow; and
he (Mr. O?Connor) felt disposed to vote against it.
Mr. BAKRON, in reply, said he did not act or vote fr#m
factious motives on the merits of an individual, but from the
merits of a question. He should, however, with leave with-
draw his motion.
Colonel VKRNER moved for*copies of correspondence be-
tween the government in Ireland and the very rev. the Dean

Mr. VERNON SMITH moved that the house to-morrow
do resolve itself into a committee on thc Post-office Acts,
with a view to regulate the transmission of foreign newspapers
within this country, and to impose a rate upon the same.
Mr. HUME asked if there was any intention to bring in a
bill for the consolidation of the Post-office Acts.
Mr. V. SMITH replied that there was no intention this
session.

Mr. N. FITZSIMON rose to move for copies of corres-

MURDER OF RICHARD LANDER.
EXTRACT OF a LETTER FROM THE AGENT TO LLOYD?S j
AT FERNANDO PO, DATED FEB. 6, 1834.
You will be sorry to be informed of the death of Richard
Lander, who left this place some weeks since in the Craven
cutter, belonging to the Company, taking with him a long-
boat I let him have for the purpose. On his arrival at the
Nunn he left the cutter, and proceeded up the river in the
boat with about 4001. worth of goods, to join the iron steam-
boat, which he had sent up a few weeks before; she was to
proceed about 300 miles up to a small island which he had
purchased from the king, and where he had a factory. They
had proceeded about 100 miles up, the current being strong
against them, they were in good spirits, tracking the boat
along shore, when they were fired on from the bush;
three men were killed, and four wounded; Mr. Lander was
one of the latter. They had a canoe of their own, and at the
time they were fired on the boat was aground, and to save
themselves, they were obliged to leap into the canoe, and
make the best of their way; they were immediately followed
by five or six war canoes, full of men, keeping up a continued
fire for five hours, until it got dark, when they lost sight of
them: they arrived here on the 2Jth ult. Mr. Lander ex-
pired this morning; he wrote me a letter two days ago, re-
questing that I would take charge of the vessels and property
belonging to the African Inland Commercial Company, with
which I accordingly complied. The ball entered near
his hip, and worked down to the thick of the thigh. It was
a most malicious and treacherous attack. Mr. Lander told
me that there were Bonny, Brass, and Benin canoes; so
that from these circumstances I am of opinion that some of
the slavers, or other Europeans, have been the promoters of
this murderous affair. Colonel Nicolls has forwarded a
statement of the transaction to government, and if proper
steps are taken the whole must be brought to light. Mr.
Lander?s clothes and papers are all lost. I have had a great
deal of trouble with the expedition, and now it will be consi-
derably increased ; but the value of Fernando Po in all cases
of difficulty is incalculable, and I shall now communicate to
you a little information relating to this island and the slave
trade. On New Year?s-day at daylight there were four vessels
in sight, two brigs, and two small vessels, schooner rigged,
in company with one of the brigs; one of them anchored,
named the Renown, of Liverpool, M?Nabb master, belong-
ing to Sir John Tobin, three months?passage. Two hours
afterwards the other brig and two small schooners anchored ;
they turned out to be his Majesty?s brig Trinculo and two
slavers, captured off the Gaboons, belonging to Prince?s
Island ; 54 slaves and a crew of 15 men on board each. The
slavers were surveyed by the officers of his Majesty?s vessels
the Curlew, Griffin, and Trinculo, and condemned as unfit
to proceed to Sierra Leone. Capt. Warren, son of Admiral
Warren, wrote to Col. Nicolls, on service, requesting him
to allow the slaves to be landed here, which request was im-
mediately complied with. The- spectacle was horrible;
there were several children that must have been torn from
the breast, for when landed, it was found necessary to give
them in charge to the women to take care of; so much for
Prince?s Island, that nest for piratical slavers. If Colonel
Nicolls had three government steamers under his control he
M ould put down the slave traffic on the coast in six months,
by destroying their nests in the rivers. At present the go-
vernment vessels only cruise about and pick up a slaver
occasionally.
LAMENT OF AN IRISH PROTESTANT EMIGRANT
By Sara.
(From Fraser's Magazine for May.)
Land of my birth ! my home, my home?*
Land of my fathers? graves?
Land of my youth and earliest loves,
Soon, soon those dashing waves
Will lie ?twixt me and thee, loved land,
For I must leave thy shore ;
And, oh, my weary heart it says,
I shall return no more !
Each tall green tree, each little bird?
Nay, every flower I see,
May well, my own, my father land,
An envied object be
To one who knows that they may live
And die upon thy shore,
While he must leave his native land,
And shall return no more.
How oft upon a summer?s eve,
My daily labour done,
I?ve watched thy hills and smiling plains,
Lit by the parting sun ;
And thought if I might live and die
Upon my native shore,
In the same faith my fathers died,
That I would ask no more.
And now my weary heart would break
Ere ever I could roam,
Through the wild forests of the west
To seek another home ;
But, oh, my children, for your sakes
I leave my native shore,
E'en though my heart too truly says,
I shall return no more.
For wicked and ungodly men
Disturb my native land ;
The scoff, the sneer, the bitter word,
The sword, the flaming brand?
All these await one of my faith
On this my native shore;
My children, I must bear you hence,
Though 1 return no more.
Our rulers, too?those unto whom
We once looked as our stay?
Now they support our bitt?rest foes,
And turn from us away ;
No more in princes can we trust,
Since our loved native shore
Our very rulers drive us from?
And we return no more.
THE KING?S BANQUET TO THE OFFICERS OF THE
FIRST REGIMENT OF FOOT GUARDS.
His Majesty gave a grand dinner on Wednesday at St.
James?s Palace to the officers of the Ist or Grenadier Regi-
ment of Goot Guards. The officers came in full regimentals ;
upwards of 100 were present.
The dinner was served in the banqueting room at two
cross tables, one at each end, and two long tables. The
middles of the tables were most tastefully ornamented
with pieces of siHcr-gilt plate of various devices, alter-
nating with candelabra, with wine-coolers (modelled from
the celebrated Warwick vase) interspersed. The service of
silver plate had all the principal articles surmounted with
the lion and a crown. The room was brilliantly illuminated
with a very handsome ormolu chandelier in the middle, and
four other chandeliers with wax lights at the coiners. At
the end of the apartment was displayed the state colour pre-
sented to the regiment in 1832 by the King, having as a back-
ground the regimental colours of the three battalions of the
regiment, surmounted with the Royal standard.
A party of the Officers dined in the Portrait Gallery.
About eight o?clock his Majesty, who wore a military uni-
form, led the way, preceded by the Comptroller and the
Treasurer of the Household, and the Lord Steward, to the
banquet, followed by the Duke of Gordon, the Duke of Wel-
lington, the colonel of the regiment; Lord Hill, Sir J. Kempt;
Sir J. Woodford, the lieut.-col. of the regiment; Lord Sal-
toun; Cols. D?Oyly, Wynyard, Greenwood, Higginson,

Barnard, Ellison, Boldero, Clive, Thornton, and Douglas;

Jekyll, Bagot, Hudson, Ayres, Penieaze, Crawford, Aston,
Angerstein, and Stanley; Lieutenants H. Conroy,
Cadogan, Home Purvcs, Cartwright, Compton, Jod-
drell, Drummond, and Thornton ; Mr. Watson, Sur-
geon-major ; Messrs. Harrison and Huthwaite, Sur-
geons ; Dr. Wright, the Adjutant-General to the Forces ; the
Military Secretary to the Commander of the Forces, the
Quarter-Master General, the Principal Aide-de-Camp to the
King, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, the Clerk Marshall;

Lord Lovaine, the Master of the Household; Colonels
Bowater and Horace Seymour, Equerries to the King ; the
Hons. Colonel Lygon and Colonel Hill, Colonel Townshend,

As the King and his military guests passed to the banquet
the band of the regiment struck up a national air.

tion. (Continued cheers.)

n The Memorial Bordelais assures us, that France is about
jj ? to send an army into Spain, for the purpose of occupying,
;ira Warily, certain important towns in the north of that
her countl T, * n order to afford to the troops of the Queen, at pre-
sent forming the garrisons of such places as St. Sebastian,
Pampeluna, &c. an opportunity of attacking the Carlists.
This is to be called a ? quasi intervention.? But if
the Carlists shall attack and enter the cities and
* , towns in question?what then? Why then the French
,sea garrisons are to attack them. This then is an out and out
1 a intervention ; and it should be so announced from the begin-
? n " ning. I pay a good deal of attention to what the Memorial
iei Bordelais says?first, because Dr. Bowring is one of its Paris
v l0 . correspondents; 2d, because it is a ministerial print, and a
> 01 journal devoted to Louis Philip; and third, because Henri
ices Fonfrede, the best Orleanist writer in France, is one of its
ews editors. Very probably the Memorial has been chosen by
iave t j 1(J government to communicate this news to France and
� 80 Europe.
. c ! s The commission appointed to examine the projects of laws
?JV 1 demanding new votes of men and arms for 1834 and 1835,
tne is about to make its report. It has proposed to grant to
P�? Marshal Soult all the sums and men required for 1834, but
j only to vote the first half year?s allowances for 1835. The
commission says that, before July, 1835, the new parliament
au T will have abundant time to examine the necessities and wants
tea of the country after that period ; and that it is not disposed
1 at the present time to accord money and men to so large an
0 amount for the whole of next year, when u they may not be
tne required.? Marshal Soult is extremely dissatisfied with this
�i report, and a great effort is to be made to get the whole year's
ea " extra budget voted.
? a " It appears that the King of Prussia has refused to receive
? x ? General Goblet, who was sent to the Court of Berlin as
Envoy. The general has returned like a bad penny to King

a l We have received intelligence from Portugal by
It the Orestes, which sailed from Lisbon on the 22nd,
, t ? a, td from Oporto on the 23d. She brings a con-
ie- siderable quantity of news, of more or less imper-
ils tance- The occupation of Almeida by Gen. Rodil,
u- an d his proclamation of Donna Maria, is confirmed,
nd but we do not learn what effect it is likely to have
al on the general cause. In the north of Portugal, if
to we may trust the Pedraite reports, their cause is
prosperous, and they assure us that the province of
he Minho is theirs, and that the province of Tras os
id Montes will soon be in their hands,
s. We are, however, slow in giving implicit
r- credence to these reports, after the fate of L?er-
nardo Sa. Our readers will recollect the trium-
ie phant accounts which the Pedroite and stock-
jobbing papers gave of the victorious progress
of �f this general, who was annihilating the Mi-
y guelites. It is now ascertained that he was
completely routed at Beja, and driven into the
extreme south, from which he was too glad to
escape without a fragment of his army. The
I. functionaries at Lisbon have not ventured
I* to publish any particulars of this disastrous event,
[ s an d a s we know that they deceived us as to
the affairs of the south of Portugal, we are not un-
reasonably sceptical in suspecting them of doing
<1 the same in the north. No attempt has been made
on Santarem, where, we understand, the army of
y Dom Miguel is in good force and spirits. Accord-
hig to a correspondent of the Morning Post, he
possesses means of bringing 33,000 men into the
field, well armed, disciplined, and supplied.
Gen. Santa Martha has deserted from Dom Miguel,
is having tendered his submission to the Duke of
'* Terceira on the 12th. We can hardly think him any
r loss to the one party or gain to the other. Admiral
h Napier has been compelled to abandon the blockade
? of Figueras, and return to Lisbon. A general im-
pression prevails among the armies, and in the
" country, that arrangements are in progress for the
, termination of hostilities?it is indeed highly de-
sirable that the contest should be brought to an end
if possible.
In Lisbon the authorities are quarrelling among
r themselves, but agree of late in offering the most
1 marked insults to the British. They issued a decree
i on the 9th, annulling the treaty of 1810, and there-
by depriving us of all the advantages which our

opposed to them. The strength and confidence of Dom
Miguel are manifest in the maintenance of his position at
Santarem, where his army is well supplied; and in his
repeated rejection of the terms offered him to withdraw from
the country. In disciplining his troops he is indefati-
gable, and throughout Portugal even women and chil-
dren are ready to offer their aid in his behalf. Thus
supported, it is not likely that Pedro can succeed,
nor is it probable that Miguel will forego his claims, un-
less compelled by an overwhelming foreign force. It
is said, that a Spanish army has entered Portugal,
hut this is not credited by those who are acquaint-
ed with the temper of these troops, which is be-
lieved to be decidedly in favour of Don Carlos, who upon
showing himself to them would espouse his cause. If this
be true, instead of injuring Miguel, a Spanish army in Portu-
gal would enable him to take the field against Pedro, and
