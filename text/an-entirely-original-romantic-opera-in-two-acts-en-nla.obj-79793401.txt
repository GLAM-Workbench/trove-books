MARIETTE;
THE RULE OE THE FAIRIES
ACT I.
Scene. ?The island beach of Yubawonga , South Pacific.
Time 1788.
Enter Chorus of Fairies.
Floating through infinite space,
Pretty, coquettish, and bright,
Perfect in contour and grace,
Cloth?d in diaphanous plight;
Bath?d in a luminous glow,
Tender, prismatic, and rare,
We are all fairies, you know,
Spirits and sprites of the air.
Sweetly languid all day long,
Bevelling in wealth of time,
Chorus we in tuneful song,
Harmonise in mirthful rhyme;
Else we gaze in dreamy way
In our mirrors, thus and thus;
Contemplating rich display
Of the charms that blend in us.
So our golden hours have sped,
As a short and blissful trance,
Or elapsed with dainty tread
To the measure of the dance.
Don?t suppose we?re void of heart?
To our tastes we?re dutiful;
What we love is perfect Art,
And we woo the Beautiful.
Floating through infinite space,
Pretty, coquettish, and bright,
Perfect in contour and grace,
Cloth?d in diaphanous plight;
* ?IN 7 A


Bath?d in a luminous glow,
Tender, prismatic and rare,
We are all fairies, you know,
Spirits and sprites of the air.
Queen. As you have sung, no doubt you pass your time pleasantly enough
in Fairydom, trolling choruses and talking poetry, when you are not engaged
in dancing or posing for mutual admiration; but all this is not practical.
Divested of its intoxicating glamour and reduced to plain matter of fact, the
conclusion is forced upon me that you are exceedingly indolent young persons.
Fairies. Gracious!
Queen. Careful thought has led me to the conviction that those who are
idle in this active universe have no justification for existence. Consequently I
have determined on a complete social reform amongst my subjects. Henceforth
you shall have something to do. There are many wrongs which mortals
inflict upon their fellow men that are not punishable by law. We are taught
that they are punished by Providence; but that medium does not always act
swiftly, and thus much of the deterrent effect which would otherwise
attach to its retributive justice is lost. lam convinced that there is scope for
fairydom to play the part of Nemesis in such cases.
Fairies. Hear, Hear!
Queen. lam not sure, indeed, whether this is not the actual mission of our
race. Of course, it will not do to commence our administration on a large
scale. As an experiment, I have decided to inaugurate the system in this
island of Yubawonga. I therefore appoint you as a corps of supervisors to see
that where a wrong is done, if mortal justice does not pnnish the guilty party,
in default of immediate Divine retribution, fairy justice shall.
Fairies. Oh Queen ! Live for ever ! Your commands shall be obeyed.
{Enter Mariette , in male attire .)
Mariette. {Aside.) What! European ladies ? Can I believe my eyes ?
Where there are white women there must be white men. Perhaps they?ve
seen him. {Aloud.) Pardon me. Did any of you happen to meet my
lover?
Fairies. {Laughing.) Who is she ?
Mariette. He!? not she!
Queen. Can a man love a man ?
Mariette. Pm not a man. Permit me to explain. A year ago in
England I fell in love with a dashing young naval captain. Brave, true, and
distingue in appearance was he, with kind deep eyes that spake unutterable
affection. We became engaged.
Fairies. How nice!
Mariette. We were so happy together, but, like a pretty dream, our
ecstacies were very short. An aged libertine, who had been introduced to me,
determined he would marry me. When he proposed I indignantly refused him.
My father, however, took up his case; swore I should have him; and com-
pelled me to send my adorable naval captain away for ever.
Fairies. What a monster.
Mariette. My lover, in despair, went to Australia to take charge of a
colonizing expedition that was about to sail out of Port Jackson. Shortly
afterwards, rather than marry my proposed husband, I dressed in men?s


clothes, and joined a ship bound for Botany Bay, with the object of searching
for my lost intended, if necessary, all over the Southern Hemisphere. Off
this island the vessel was wrecked. I alone was washed ashore, as you see
me; and I repeat: Have you seen my lover?
Queen. (Sighing.) Alas! no. If he is all you have described him, per-
haps it?s better for our peace of mind we hav?n?t. (Fairies sigh.) Do you
really hope to meet him by making haphazard inquiries over half the world?
Mariette: Of course I do. Things are never so utterly unpromising that
we need to give up hope.
BALLAD. ? Mariette.
When with frequent failure cloy?d; feeling harass?d and annoy?d,
That success you?ve sought in vain ;
Ere accumulating care; ere the promptings of despair
Overwhelm the morbid brain ;
On forebodings turn your back; and to find the strength you lack,
To sustain you in your need,
Cast a meditative look into cheery Nature?s book,
And this message there you?ll read :
Wliere the song-bird?s liquid mirth
Fills the air with melody;
Where the sunbeams warm the earth,
And disport upon the sea?
Gentle Hope must ever be.
Hope, the light to Fortune?s goal;
Hope, that nerves the toiler?s arm;
Hope, the wounded spirit?s halm ;
Hope, the anchor of the soul;
Friend of all humanity.
In a fleeting moment?s space things will wear a brighter face,
Warm the doubting heart will glow;
Soon a sweet suffused relief will obliterate your grief,
Soon distracting care will go.
Nature whispers by-and-by: ?Fortune won?t be always shy,
She?ll caress you if she?s pressed;
Courage take, if your in love: softly coos the turtle dove
Promises of love possessed.?
Where the song-bird?s liquid mirth
Fills the air with melody;
Where the sunbeams warm the earth,
And disport upon the sea?
Gentle Hope, I welcome thee.
Hope, the light to Fortune?s goal;
Hope, that nerves the toiler?s arm;
Hope, the wounded spirit's balm;
Hope, the anchor of the soul;
Friend of all humanity.
Mariette. Ah! You happily situated people can never know what a
comfort to me that spark of hope is. Doubtless you have many friends and
loving spirits to watch over you.
Fairies. No; we are quite alone in the world,
Mariette. You?ve no husbands?
/ )


Fairies. Not even naval captains.
Marietxe. How inexpressibly sad!
Queen. We are, however, strong in our virginity. We can protect our-
selves; and whilst you remain in this territory we shall protect you.
Marietxe. Thanks!
Queen. Farewell! (Exit Fairies .)
Marietxe. Goodbye! They appear to be a sort of Girls? Friendly Society
Vigilance Committee: Well, it?s of no use for me to stay here: I must con-
tinue my search. {Exit.)
Enter Blacks , bearing umbrellas. They dance.
CHORUS.
On Yubawonga Island we
Have lived for ages;
The pearl and coral fishery
Our time engages.
And since the days of George the First?
The year the South Sea Bubble burst?
In piety we?ve been well versed
By learned sages.
We pay our taxes to the King
In loyal fashion?
His revenue?s a tidy thing
To cut a dash on.
We feel a pride?and so we ought?
In keeping up a brilliant court;
On all who set it?s pomp at nought
We wreak our passion.
We've given up polygamy
And minor vices;
By means of which Old Thingummy
His dupes entices.
We swim and leap in leisure hours,
Or, loitering round amongst the flow?rs,
As lovers we exert our pow?rs
In tender crises.
We?ve learn?d to be the best of friends
To one another;
That Black and % White alike descends
From Eve our mother.
And, furthermore, we?re made aware?
Though you?ve more clothes than we to air?
The Black?s regarded by the Fair
As man and brother.
From these few leading facts you?ll find,
As we?ve deducted,
Whilst hands are busy, here, the mind
Is well instructed.
We argue that?this being true ?


Ko gain to us could well ensue.
If this regime by order new
Were interrupted.
On Yubawonga Island we
Have lived for ages;
The pearl and coral fishery
Our time engages.
We?re such an independent lot,
So well content with what we?ve got,
That foreign rule we?d suffer not
For thrice our wages.
Snavel. By European governance we should get no benefit.
Gobble. Of course not. Look at our happy condition. We agree on
religious questions; we are strict teetotallers, and have no politics; whilst
our morals are regulated on a sliding scale. The conditions of white
society are far inferior.
Gulp. In dress we defy competition for graceful simplicity. There is
something so unobtrusive about our summer costumes, that they reveal to
the beholder a nameless charm.
Snavel. Think of the toilettes of our ladies, too, On state occasions, the
white belles consider it the acme of fashionable elegance to undress their
chests and shoulders. Our dames and damsels are much more dla mode.
They are clothed like a good entertainment: an entertainment which has
but one short interval, where the curtain?s down in the middle.
Gobble. Well may we ask: ? What can civilization teach us ??
Gulp. By the way, did you hear what became of our bishop?
Gobble. He quarrelled with the King, and left the island more than six
months ago. ( Enter Messenger.)
Messenger. Gentlemen ! His Majesty approaches,
{Music. Enter King Solomon with attendants. Natives salaam.)
King. Rise! our good subjects, and accept the morning?s greetings; we
have urgent business with you.
All. God save your Majesty.
King. A large ship, with all sails set, is bearing towards the harbor. We
know not whom it carries. If friends : what arrangements shall we make to
entertain them? If enemies: what on earth shall we do? By the advice of
your late bishop all our swords were turned into ploughshares, and our
spears into pruning hooks.
Gulp. Being friendly, they must take pot luck. Should they be inimical,
we must even use the peaceful implements you mentioned for protection;
and the millenium in Yubawonga must be post-dated.
All. Hear, hear!
Messenger. The strangers have landed, and are approaching.
King. There is no time now to arrange details. We must do the best
we can, and act according to circumstances.


{Music. Enter Captain Clive , Lieutenant , Marines , &c. Blacks group
around King.)
Captain Clive. ( Bowing , and raising hat.) Have I the honor of address-
ing the King of this island ?
King. You have!
C. C. In good health, I hope ?
King. Very good, I thank you.
C. C. Nice Weather !
King. Yes. (Blacks and Whites menace each other. King and C. G.
note this.)
C. C. I?m afraid we shall have a storm shortly.
King. It looks threatening. Do you know, whenever there is a dis-
turbance of that kind my people get most uncommonly hungry ? They?ll
eat anything. (Blacks open mouths and point down throats to White men.)
C. C. My men, at such times, kill everything they come across.
King. It is to be hoped that a tempest will be averted. Perhaps the
elements can square it up, somehow, amongst themselves.
C. C. Very likely. {To Whites) Order men !
King. (To Blacks) Shut your mouths, you idiots.
C. C. My card?? Charles Clive, R.N.? While lam about it I may as
well present the gentleman who procured me the pleasure of this visit.
Lieutenant ! Ask his lordship to step this way. {Enter Bishop).
King. By all that?s pious ! {Refuses Bishop's hand). Did I not order
you to vacate your diocese ?
Bishop. True. I?ve come to be reinstated.
King. You?ll never see the day when that takes place.
Bishop. I?ll stake my mitre to your crown that I do.
King. Confound your insolence. Guards, seize him ! {Blacks rush
forward).
C.C. Marines! present arms ! {They protect Bishop). His lordship is in
our especial charge. Don?t let us fall out about him, he?s hardly worth it.
Refer this matter to arbitration at a later date, and for the present, join us
in?a quiet pipe.
King. As you propose it, I don?t object. It?s certainly a sensible course
to pursue. {Steward hands around pipes).
C. C. Dispose of his lordship somehow. {Lieutenant points to tr?e, and
prodding Bishop with his sword, makes him climh it). The Bishop is
enthroned.
King. The church is watching over us, {All sit).
Lieutenant. What is your company?s particular fancy? We have
brandy, whisky, old Jamaica, and old Tom.
King. No intoxicants, thank you. A little toast and water would suit us
very well.
Lieutenant. With a ? fly ?init ?
King. If it doesn?t ? fly ?? to the head. Is this tobacco ?


C. C. (Aside.). It?s opium. (Aloud.) Yes, it?s a new kind. First rate
stuff you?ll discover. Our men will show your people how to use it. (Whites
assist Blacks.) Are you ready. Here?s success to all of us, and good health.
(All stand and drink.)
SOLO.? King Solomon.
Our acquaintance is certainly brief,
And our friendship but newly cemented ;
Yet your manly address
Wins our hearts we confess,
In a manner most unprecedented ;
So we?ll smoke the Virginian leaf.
To your health, if your humour it pleases,
We will quaff lemonade,
Whilst it?s hot in the shade,
Or we?ll toast you in broth when it freezes.
Chorus Blacks. Each son of Yubawonga land
Now proffers you a welcome hand ;
You won?t refuse to take it,
But if, perchance, you mean us well,
You?ll warmly grasp it for a spell,
And vigorously shake it.
Bishop. Oh, Glory ! Here?s a jolly sell!
Whites (Shaking hands). ?We?ll warmly grasp it for a spell
And vigorously shake it.
SOLO.? Captain Clive.
Whilst such sentiments tenant your breasts,
We conceive that no bone of contention
Will appear on the plate,
When at length we relate
Our designs to this sable convention ;
Still, the commonest prudence suggests
We should guard against angry caprices ;
Lest, mayhap, in a huff
The long clays which we puff,
Pipes of peace should but prove pipes in pieces.
Chorus Whites. Although we?ve weapons near at hand,
Our love we hope you?ll understand
Is no profession hollow.
Here?s ? Banishment to ev?ry frown,
And grace to gulp all discord down
In one prodigious swallow.? (They drink again.)'
Bishop. Oh ! Don?t 1 wish they?d let me down.
Blacks. Observe ! We gulp all discord down,
In one prodigious swallow. (They drink again.)
Whites. Resume your seats, sirs, at your ease.
Blacks. Yes, we?ll sit. (All sit.)
Whites. And puff and chatter as you please.
Blacks. Puff and spit.
Whites. (Aside.) We?ll smoke them out like honey bees. (All smoke.)
C. C. (Putting down pipes and sighing.) Ah me ! Oh my poor heart.


King. What ails you my friend. Have you got a pain ?
C. C. Alas, Your Majesty ! I have a sorrow.
King. One so young, so handsome as you, would seem no fit subject for
brooding despondency. Your spirits should be too elastic to be blighted
by unhappy thoughts.
C. C. Trust me. The fairest and gayest have their troubles.
King. Tell me the cause of your disquietude.
SONG.? Captain Clive.
Conceive you a gallant just out of his teens,
With plenty of learning, and plenty of means,
Engaged to a lady of beauty and wit ;
For parents caprices not caring a bit.
Think of a butterfly
Loved by a bee ;
Such was the cut of my
Case to a ? T.?
Imagine the fair one with sorrowful heart,
Obliged by papa from her lover to part;
Two spirits more troubled you never beheld?
An idyll was ruined, a poem dispell?d.
All in a flutter, I
Took to the sea ;
Such was the cut of my
Case to a ? T.?
She said as she bade me her final adieu.
? Whoever may wed me, I?ll love none but you ; ?
But spite of that comfort, I cannot digest
The thought that she bows to another?s behest,
Words fail to utter my
Feelings in re ;
Such is the cut of ray
Case to a ? T.?
King. ( Dozing .)
I grant you?ve cause for anguish deep. (Falls
asleep.)
Blacks. {Dosing.)
We join in your deploring. (Fall asleep.)
Whites ( Derisively .) In intervals of snoring.
Bishop. I?m blowed if they?re n
I?m blowed if they?re not fast asleep.
C.C. A truce to sorrow. Sailors! fix up the scaffolding.
Sailors. Aye, aye, sir!
C.C. Bishop ! come down. (He descends.) Stand over there. Look meek
and cheerful, like a saint in a stained glass window, till you?re wanted.
Lieutenant. Clear these bottles away. Tie each rope? so ; and put a noose
around each black gentleman?s neck. (They do so.) Bring forward the
cannon, and hoist the standard here. (They do so.)


C.C. All ready! Each sailor will take charge of a rope. Now! (C.C.
signals; cannon fires ; band plays ?Rule Britannia." Blacks awake and sit
up , unable to understand their position. Whites cheer when music ceases.')
King. What?s all this about? ( Observes Bishop.) Have I and this
estimable court fallen asleep over one of your interminable sermons? ( Bishop
laughs. King feels rope.) Ha! what?s this ?
Blacks. ( Feeling ropes.) Oh!
C.C. Our Most Christian Sovereign, King George the Third, Defender of
the Faith, and all that sort of thing ?but particularly Defender of the Faith?
has become aware that the court of Yubawonga is at variance with the bishop
of this diocese. In fact, that prelate has, by the machinations of the said
court, been expelled from his see. Having been appealed to that he might
insist on his lordship being reinstated, His Britannic Majesty, as head of the
Church to which your people belong, has commissioned me, his humble
servant, not only to see that the bishop is restored to his position, honours,
and emoluments, but to place his person under military protection. In order
that the presence of British soldiery in this island may not be required from
too light a cause, I am also directed to annex your kingdom.
Blacks. That you shall never do ! ( They start to feet , but are pulled back
by ropes.)
C.C. (politely.) Don?t rise, gentlemen ! there is no occasion for alarm.
The annexation will only take place with your King?s full permission, and by
deed under his hand.
?King. lam nearly choking with hemp and indignation.
C.C. ( handing document.) Now, Bishop : read that parchment.
Bishop. I, King Solomon, do hereby acknowledge the suzerainty of His
Majesty King George the Third of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, and
hereafter hold my kingdom of Yubawonga and its fisheries at his sovereign
pleasure, administering law under his approval.
C.C. I understand your Majesty will sign that ?
King. Never! (Sailors haul on ropes; Blacks strangle.)
C.C. My men have quite a passion for gymnastics.
Lieut. His Majesty would like to offer a few remarks. (King falls.)
C.C. Get a glass of water, and loosen his cravat. Easy, men!
King {recovering). Here; give me pen and ink. I sign. (Bishop hands
materials.) Remember, fellow, I was black in the face before I did it.
(Signs.)
Bishop. Yes, you kept your complexion.
C.C. Two witnesses, please : one on each side. (Blacks and Whites sign.)
Now, men ! release these gentlemen. (They do so.)
CHORD S.? Blacks. (Indignantly.)
Brothers, must we
Bend now the knee
To every detestable pallid-lace ?
Have we to bear
Breathing the air
That?s drawn by a hated controlling race ?


Spurn we the black
Showing such lack
Of all the proud feelings that brave men keep ;
Scorn we the white,
Fearing to fight,
Who turns on a friend when he?s fast asleep.
Unarm?d and helpless we deride you,
Potent though ye be ;
Hoping all evil may betide you,
Now we turn and flee.
[Exeunt.
C.C. They?re spirited fellows, and must be watched
Lieut. We did the business neatly. It was not straightforward; but
anything is better than bloodshed.
All. Hear, hear!
BALLAD.? Lieutenant.
The path to glory in old Roman days
Was. like the route to life seraphic,
And other up:hill, rough and weary ways,
Not traversed much by common traffic.
Bold was the wight who on that risky road,
To gain an end would be advancing ;
With sword in hand, ?mid lurking death he strode?
The prize was scarcely worth the chancing.
Now? all has changed ; and he whose soul aspires,
By fame, to fire the rolling ocean,
May consummate his laudable desires
Through peaceful walks to high promotion.
No statesman risks a fight, his aim to reach,
Whilst subtle tact can save a foray ;
By craft, intrigue, and diplomatic speech
Men, now-a-days, go courting glory.
C.C. Hallo! what have we here? ( Enter Blacks in absurd travelling
costume .)
Whites. Must be a pic-nic party.
The King and Blacks {leaving hands). Good-bye. Tra-la-la!
Lieut. Where is your Majesty going?
King. To set up house-keeping on another island. We?re not going to
stay here to be civilized, nor alcoholized, nor Mormonised. You can annex
Yubawonga, but you sha?n?t annex its people.
C.C. {aside.) To garrison a deserted island will be too dull altogether.
{Aloud.) Your Majesty, this is absurd; you shall not go.
King. My dear sir, you have made us British subjects. It is a privilege
enjoyed by all who belong to that category to go whithersoever they will,
without hindrance. We intend to exercise our rights, and we, therefore, wish
you a very good-day.
Blacks, Once more, farewell! ( Exeunt , leaving Whites in dismay.)
Bishop. Checkmate!
Lieut. In one move. {Enter three black widows.)
First W. Men !


Second W. White men !
All Three. Oh, how strange! ( They group together , and try to look
fascinating.')
Lieut. The three Graces in black marble. Dis-graces, I mean.
{Bishop comes absently forward. On seeing Widows , hides behind a tree.)
C.C. Ahem ! Pardon me, have you lost your way ?
Widows {giggling stupidly). Yes.
Lieut. Who are you ? Where do you live ?
Third W. Gentlemen, ours is a painful history. We are sisters, and were
all born in one litter. When bright and well-developed maids of seventeen,
we were married, in the neighbouring island of Unsrerraug, to a triad of
brothers. For a whole week did they revel in our society, but on the
Saturday night following our union, finding, no doubt, that their happiness
was too much for them, they unanimously partook of strychnine, and turned
up their toes. {Widows sigh; Whites weepf) We mourned for months?long
months.
First and Second W. Two months !
Third W. Don?t interrupt me ; it?s rude. Then a parson fellow came
around to comfort us, A smooth spoken chap he was, and well up in his
profession?Bishop of Yubawonga.
GO. Ah!
Third W. He offered us sweet sympathy, and we took to him like flies
around a treacle-pot. But, alas !he was faithless?he deceived us. {Bishop
peeps in horror from behind tree. Widows weep.)
Lieut. The dev
C.C. Bear up, ladies; tell us the rest.
Third W. UnknoVvn to the others, he persuaded each of us to be engaged
to him. But we afterwards compared notes, and then he hurriedly left the
island. We came hither in search of him, but we find that all the blacks
have gone.
C.C. What do you intend to do now ? {Widows consult.)
Widows. We hardly know ; we feel we ought to be under some pro-
tection.
C.C. True.
Widows. Male protection?a husband?s protection. ( Enthusiastically ,
and kneeling to C.C. and party.) It?s leap year, you know. (Whites look
astonished ; widows rise to feet and sing.)
Lithe and frisky, hale and strong,
Three black widows here you see ;
Lonely we have not been long,
Yet longer than we wish?d to be.
First W. If you care to ask us why
Second W. We neglect to sob and sigh,
Third W. Or appropriately cry ;
Together. In accord we make reply?
Since we?ve lost our husbands tender,
We each seek a new defender.
Tall, and masculine in gender.


C.C. Upon my word, you take me quite by surprise. {Hesitatingly.) I
feel deeply honoured, but I?ve made a vow which precludes me from marrying
you. I shall esteem you as?no, not sisters ; that would be a reflection. It
cannot be.
Widows. We?re amiable, domesticated, fond of children, and play the
piano. In fact, we can furnish all the accomplishments appearing in the
average matrimonial advertisement. ( They appeal to Lieutenant.)
Lieut. I have a preference for blonde beauties. What do you say, my
men ?
Soldiers, Sailors, &c. ( bashfully bowing and lifting hats). If you please
we?re all engaged. ( They giggle , and nudge each other.)
Widows. Alas ! alas ! By all we are rejected.
C.C. But, ladies, I will see that right is done,
Widow's. You will ? Oh, joy ! For hope so unexpected ;
We?re happy as a baby with a bun.
C.C. Come forth, good Bishop, come; nor longer hide you.
Bishop Captain, I come, with conscience clear. [He advances .)
Lieut. The Fates are strong, my lord; ?tis they who guide you
To meet with your fiancees here.
Soldiers, &c. The Fates are strong, my lord; ?tis they who guide you

pointing )
Bishop. I?ve heard the charge these perjured women make,
{ln centre tvith dignity.) Design?d to wreck my manly credit.
C.C. What say you, then ?
Bishop. As man to men,
It?s false: but females having said it,
I s?pose I?d better call it a mistake.
Widows. We vow it?s true.
Bishop. The deuce, you do ?
{Losing temper.) Then I reply,
You tell a lie.
Soldiers, &c. Oh, fie ! Oh, fie! "Oh, fie !
C.C. It?s three to one, Bishop. The preponderance of testimony is against
you. My decision is that you marry them all at once.
Bishop. Never! ! !
C.C. What mean you, sir? If you persist in your refusal, your punish-
ment shall be to be conveyed to yonder island, where your late departed flock
have pitched their tents. They?ll offer you a warm reception. {Makes sign
of cutting his throat.)
Bishop {desperately). Then my course is clear. ( Draws pistol.) Stand
back, all of you! ( Retreats to hack of stage.) For some months past, I?ve led
a life no well-bred dog would care to lead. Driven here and there and every-
where ; the shuttlecock of fortune, and much belaboured by the battledore.
Now, forsooth, I have the choice to marry three old crones, who fail to com-
prehend what virtue lies in truth, and have a most extravagant hymeneal
craving; or else I may submit myself to risk of murder. What am I ??A


poor shepherd, whose black merino lambs have gone astray, and love him
not; whose fold?s invaded by strange rams of paler hue that make of him a butt \
whose peace has gone ; who longs for nought but rest. (Wildly.) Death is
welcome to me; I will take my life! (Flourishes pistol, and advances.
Whites stand aghast.)
SONG. ?Bishop.
No matter how piously-minded he be,
Pray remember, as far as you can,
The head of the highest episcopal see
Is unluckily only a man.
When wrong?d by the malice of treacherous foes.
He?s a victim of cavil and care ;
Don?t wonder, my friends, if he desperate grows,
And despatches himself in despair?despair,
Despatches himself in despair.
Chorus.
No hasty suicidal cleric would think
Of inhaling a poisonous fume;
Respect for his cloth would induce him to shrink
From the choice of a watery tomb.
For a decorous end to the pistol I fly?
It is more efficacious by far?
And hurries one off to the ? sweet bye-and-bye,?
With a proper amount of eclat ? eclat ,
A proper amount of eclat.
Chorus.
Oh, wretched reflection, the depth of my fall
Off the lofty Parnassus of grace ;
The thought of my precepts in future will call
From the sceptics a comic grimace.
But one satisfaction a martyr may take
?Ere he?s rudely consigned to the hearse,
In terms that will make all his enemies quake:
He can rip out a good hearty curse?a curse,
Can rip out a good hearty curse.
Chorus.
Attend to me, all of you, and hear my last will and testament. King
Solomon shall end his days in peace whither he has gone, but an after
punishment shall overtake him for his cruelty He quarrelled with me and
sent me into exile without cause; I squared the account by obtaining
forcible reinstatement, but now he has employed these three women to take
away my good name. For that villany, I curse him, and predict that years
after his demise his spirit shall haunt the earth ; nor shall it rest until a
strange event shall have' occurred.
Whites. We pray you, represent
What is that ?strange event,?
Bishop. Whatever that so ? strange event ? may be,
It?s nature will not be disclosed by me.
As for you, having reviled and unjustly treated me, I bid you never leave
this island during the term of your natural lives. (Dismay of soldiers, etc.)
Don?t mind him, lads. It?s but a joke he means ;
He knows that he?s addressing the marines.


Bishop. ( Furiously ) Tho? I never spoke in an equivoke,
Yet you say I joke when about to croak ;
I will let you know
That it is not so.
1 may tell you, ere you marry,
For one hundred years you'll tarry,
Or you never will be benedict at all.
And upon those shameless ladies,
To whom widowhood is Hades,
Just the same unwelcome fortune shall befall.
Widows. Oh !
C. C. What sign shall we have that all this bombastic nonsense is
coming true?
Bishop. This sign. When I shoot myself yonder ship of yours shall
blow sky high. So ! (Shoots himself , explosion, red fire, etc.)
Soldiers, etc. My word!ï¿½ There she goes. He was right after all.
(They rush to back , looking at ship.)
Enter Marietta.
Mariette. That must have been an explosion ! What?s this? (Observes
Bishop's body.) Gracious ! He?s murdered ! (Screams and faints. Lieu-
tenant rushes forward and catches her.)
Soldiers, etc. (Startled.) Hallo !
C. C. Order men! Corporal. See that the body is decently buried, and
make such investigation concerning the ship as you can. (They raise
Bishop and exeunt.)
Lieutenant. A woman ! I can tell by the feel of her.
C.C. She?s white, and she?s pretty.
Mariette. (Recovering.) Thank you ! lam better now. (Sees C.C. and
starts violently. To Lieutenant.) Tell me ! He didn?t kill the man, did he ?
Lieut. No ! nor did I.
Mariette. I don?t mind about you.
C. C. The fact is, it?s a case of suicide ; but why are you so anxious
that I should not have killed him ?
Mariette. 1 could never marry a murderer. Don?t you know me ?
C.C. What! Mariette? (They embrace.)
Lieut. (Retiring back.) This place must be enchanted.
C. C. To see you is the very height of joy
To see you is the very height of joy,
To kiss you is ecstacy unbounded.
Mariette. Oh Charley! It is bliss without alloy,
Thus, in loving arms to be surrounded
C. C. (Disengaging) Hold, Madam ! I forgot. Are you not married ?
Widows. Married !! ! Fancy!
Lieut. (To widows) Get along with you ! (Exeunt widows.)
Mariette. No ! lam not married. I will tell you all about it.
C. C. Thank Heaven ! The fact that you?re single is enough for me at
present. You can tell me all about it another time. 1 am too jubilant to
bother with explanations.


Mariette, Then you still love me ?
C. C. With all my heart. Do you reciprocate the sentiment ?
Mariette. A little. ( They embrace again and kiss. Lieut, whistles and
prepares to leave).
C. C, Don?t go, Lieutenant. We don?t mind you !
Lieut. Oh ! Allow me to offer my congratulations. [He shakes hands
with them.) lam a confirmed bachelor, I never could see why a fellow
should be expected to support another man?s sister ; but I take a scientific
interest in love affairs generally, and, in your case, it even amounts to a
friendly sympathy.
C. 0. Thanks ! You?re a justice of the peace, I believe ?
Lieut. Yes !
C. C. You possess a book of ? Common Prayer? ?
Lieut. The remains of one.
C, C. Then, would you, my dear fellow, be so good as to ascertain whether
the marriage ceremony is still intact in its pages ?
Lieut. Certainly.
C. C. If so, bring hither the book and the ship?s company.
Lieut. With pleasure. [Exit.)
Mariette. Oh Charley !
C. C. I think it is better that we should be united at once.
Mariette. It?s very short notice. This dress of mine is scarcely in
character for a bride. My appearance is sure to be perplexing to the sailors.
They will be struck with the novelty of two gentlemen getting married.
C. C. My people are fellows of sterling principles. They would never
judge a man by the coat he wears. At any rate, if I?m satisfied, it surely
doesn?t matter to the witnesses whom I marry ? Ah ! Say you will be mine
Mariette. Forever! [They embrace again.)
DUET.
Captain Clive. When lovers find
That beauty?s kind,
And time and chance both favour ;
Bad luck, I say,
To such as they
Who feel disposed to waver.
For I conclude,
If promptitude
In business well displayed is ;
Swift and direct
In it?s effect,
It ought to please the ladies.
Mariette and C. C. So, let us dance and be jolly,
Making the most of the hour ;
What if our hopes prove but folly,
What if our sweets leave a sour ?
Pleasant it is to be dreaming?
Once in a way for a time ;
Sunlight is everywhere beaming,
Life is all music and rhyme.


Mariette. All may be quite
As you recite,
I?m willing to believe you.
You seem to pine
To make me thine,
For husband I receive you ;
And if, perchance,
My ignorance
Of what this step?s entailing,
Should lead me wrong,
I?ll hold my tongue
From murmers unavailing.
Mariette and C. 0. So, let us dance and be jolly, etc.,
(Enter Lieutenant and Ship's Company.)
Chords Though the sound of wedding bells,
Lieut, and Company Gladdens not this great occasion ;
Ev?ry manly bosom swells,
With a joyous agitation.
We will lend what help we may,
In a manner most suggestive ;
To surround this happy day,
With a halo gay and festive.
C. C. You have found the book ?
Lieut. Yes! The ceremony is all there, except some remarks which set
forth the reason why marriage is ordained.
C. C. If only that part is missing, it?s all right. I know all about it.
Lieut. Then you can explain that phase of the matter to the lady at your
leisure.
C. C. Lieutenant! You may proceed. ( All group around (7.(7., M. and
Lieut.)
Enter Fairies.
Chorus.
Winging,
Springing,
Swift as thought and free as air ;
Clinging,
Singing,
Here and there and everywhere ;
Seeing all goes right and fair.
We have not much time to spare.
Sailors, White bridesmaids! Yubawonga is a better place than we
imagined.
Fairies ( curtseying ). You are mistaken in us, gentlemen.
Lieut. They?re right, my men. You never know when you have the
women.
Queen (stepping between C.C. and Mariette). We have come to forbid
this marriage.
C.C. What just cause or impediment have you to urge ?
Queen. Must we remind you of the Bishop?s curse ?


Lieut. My dear ladies, we don?t care about that. ( All laugh heartily.
Fairies look angry.)
Queen. Then allow me to tell you we are fairies. As such, we have chosen to
become the executrices of the Bishop?s will. In addition to enforcing its pro-
visions we also propose to punish you for your wrongful annexation of this
island. We command you to stay these proceedings.
Mariette. Are you not the persons who promised to be my friends, and
to watch over me ?
Queen. We cannot interfere with the course of justice.
C.C. Look here, madam; it may be bad taste to admit it, but I?m in a
hurry bridegrooms generally are. If you like to stand by and be pleasant
during this ceremony, we shall be glad to have your assistance. If you don?t,
I am bound to inform you that the marriage will take place all the same, and
order will be enforced.
Queen. What? You presume to threaten us?
C.C. It?s all according to the way you take it. Lieutenant, commence!
Queen. No man shall stir a limb, and power of speech shall leave you all!
(.4 ll remain standing in curious attitudes , unable to move or speak. Fairies
laugh.) Now, gentlemen, when you get tired of your constrained positions, I
give you leave to signify the same by opening your mouths and nodding your
heads three times, in unanimity. ( they all do so.)
C.C. ( sighing , and straightening his limbs). I see there?s much in what you
say ; and so, perforce, this wedding stands postponed.
Mariette. Till when?
Queen. This day one hundred years. (Mariette faints.)
Lieut. Are we to understand that what the Bishop said is coming true?
Fairies. Precisely!
Sailors, &c. That we must never leave this island ?
Fairies. Yes, your fate is to stay
On this island for aye;
You shall not get away
For the rest of your years.
No more the seas over
You?ll play the bold rover,
And plunder in clover,
My brave buccaneers.
{Men whistle softly. Mariette recovers.)
C.C. Happy thought! You see this star ? ( Points to breast.)
Queen. I do, indeed.
C.C. You know the gifts which it confers?
Queen. It gives to him who owns it the right to make one wish, which
shall be granted him. That wish may not affect the fairy ban you suffer
under, and its kind force can be applied to you alone.
C.C. What a sad restriction. My men, accept my deep regrets. Lieu-
tenant, I m sorry for you. Now hear me, Mariette. You?ie pretty, sweet, and
lovable: the sort of girl one longs to meet, and grieves to part with. A cent?ry
hence there?ll be a difference in you. The ?sere and yellow leaf? will then
epitomise your catalogue of beauties. Whatever I may be, I doubt not I
shall love youthen, if you exist; but hearts?like all things else?are mutable;
a hundred years? engagement?s rather long, and so I think it only fair to
loose you from your troth.


Mariette. Oh, Charlie!
C.C. In doing so, I?ll take my wish. Then, having wished, I?ll hand this
star to you. By that bequest you?ll also be entitled to a wish, which, likewise,
will come true. I will not venture to suggest the favour you should ask?l
leave it to yourself; so suit your iancy. Lieutenant?your hand ! Good-bye,
old friend. My love!?a last, long kiss. ( Embraces Mariette.)
Fairies ( refreshed ). Ugh ! ( Sailors wipe mouths , and ogle fairies.)
C.C. ( talcing star). Now, good fairies, as I cannot wed for yet one hundred
years, T wish to feel at that far date as young and fresh as now, to look as
youthful, and to think as well. Till then, I pr?ythee let me sleep, and when
I wake, oh, let me ope my eyes in Australasia. (Hands star to Mariette , and
falls asleep. Mariette kisses star , and kneels at C.C.?s side, weeping.)
Queen. Now, my dear, don?t give up hope; we?ll take care of you'
Gentlemen, concerning your cases, we would like you to understand that
whilst discharging the unpleasant duties of executrices, we have no ill-feeling
towards you.
Lieut. Thanks. Are you and your lady friends staying here for any
length of time?
Fairies. We live here! (Sailors, &c., throw up hats in joy.)
Lieut. Our service to you, madame. (Bows to Queen.)
Sailors, &c. We shall all take an early opportunity of leaving our cards-
(They also how. Fairies curtsey.)
Lieut. Corporal! our captain must be carried away and comfortably
housed; his snooze is likely to be a long one. Don?t let him lie on his back,
or he may have bad dreams. See that two attendants are always at his side to
keep off the mosquitoes, and that his shaving water?s ready when he wakes.
(Corporal salutes , and soldiers proceed to put C.C. on litter.)
CHORUS.
Men.
We litle thought, when lately sent
To Yubawonga?s sultry land,
We went to life-long banishment
At any fairy maid?s command.
Yet, here or home; where?er we be,
We follow the chivalric way
Of showing proper gallantry,
By doing what the ladies say.
Fairies. Though you?re but men of mortal race,
You gain upon our hearts apace.
Men.
But now the blacks have left the isle;
Must you and we alone remain
In bachelor and spinster style?
Oh, gentle fairies ! please explain.
W e?re not so good that we should pose
As Josephs in society;
And we consider there are those
Who?d question its propriety.
Fairies. We never thought of that before ;
Our credit we must not ignore.


Corporal. Lieutenant! All is ready.
Lieutenant.
We?ll follow you
In slow progression,
By two and two?
A long procession.
Perhaps inaddme,
Who smiles so brightly,
Will grace the arm
I curve politely,
(Offers arm to Queen.
Sailors, &c. (tofairies). I pray you, pretty maid
All courtships must begin?
To join in our parade,
By hooking on my fin. (Fairies take Sailors' arms.)
Lieut. March ! ( All march.)
Men (to march time)
Thus, as we go,
With girls in tow,
Following at ease near our sleeping captain ;
Each happy beau
Just feels, you know,
Much inclined to squeeze what his heart?s enrapt in.
We think each fay
Ought now to say
How she views the point that we lately stated :
Whether we may
Discreetly stay
And live out of joint, or be conjugated,
Fairies.
Good gentlemen, such nice considerations
We cannot hastily decide ;
We?ll settle on our subsequent relations
By this day week, at eventide.
But as you go,
With us in tow,
And nought is amiss with your handsome captain ;
Each happy beau?
For once, yon know,
May venture to kiss what his heart?s enrapt in.
Men.
Each happy beau
Will not be slow
In stooping to kiss what his heart?s enrapt in.
(They kiss , and march off.)

ACT 11.
Scene. ?An Australian woodland glade. Watercourse in mid distance. Tovm
of WardourvUle in perspective to left; ranges to right.
Time 1888.
Rustic Youths and Girls discovered.
BALLET.
Augustus. Are they not lovely?
Youths. They are indeed. (All sigh.)
Augustus. Such rich complexions!
Youths. Yes. (They sigh again.)
Adolphus. Hand-painted! {Girls start.)
Linda. If we have an especial merit upon which we pride ourselves, it is
that we are by no means artificial. Whatever charms we have are those which
Nature gave us.
Adolphus. You never even powder yourselves. Boys! extend your
fingers and see. ( Youths advance pointing. Girls retreat to centre of stage,
and hide behind fans.)
Girls. Forbear! You nasty things ! (Youths retire , throwing kisses.)
Rose. Every manly cheek should blush for shame.
Adolphus. Manly cheek is of a character most unblushing.
Youths. It was only fun.
Linda (pointing to Adolphus). If you remove that individual from our
presence we will forgive you. {Men hustle Adolphus off the stage.)
Augustus ,( shyly). We made up our minds to take a very decisive step
this morning.
Girls. Yes!
Augustus. But, under the circumstances, we hesitate so.
Girls. It is the privilege of beauty to command.
Youths {kneeling). Then we ask you to become our wives; for we lovo
you deeply.
SONG. ?Augustus.
The frosts of winter now are over,
The days are growing warm and bright;
The buttercups and early clover
Bedeck the landscape left and right.
Reflective cattle lightly browsing,


And thoughtful birds just now devote
Much time to wooing and espousing
The female friends on whom they dote ;
Each festive cat that goes a-mousing,
Sings tender songs of love, by rote.
Chorus.?Youths. Pretty ladies! don?t decline
Joy, the greatest yet invented ;
Say, to wed us you?ve consented ;
Take our hearts and give us thine.
In our persons is presented
Ev?ry charm that?s masculine.
The very game are seeking cover;
Whilst busy ants and kindred pests
Respectively select a lover,
AntQiiov to building nests.
In short, the animal creation,
Likewise each vegetable thing,
Conceives a vernal aspiration
That?s quite concomitant with Spring.
And so, in humble admiration,
Lo! at your feet we beg to sing?
Chorus. ? Youths. Pretty ladies! don't decline
Joy, the greatest yet invented;
Say, to wed us you?ve consented :
Take our hearts and give us thine.
In our persons is presented
Ev?ry charm that?s masculine.
Girls.
And it we say you ?No??
Youths (rising in Oh !
dismay ). If you should tell us ?No,?
That it?s in fact ? No go !?
To strangle wounded pride.
We?d straight hand in our cheques,
By stretching of our necks ;
As victims of the sex
Committing suicide.
Blanche. We hardly know what love Is.
Augustus, It manifests itself in yearnings of a nature too complicated to
explain.
Rose. Is it possible?
Linda. We have experienced feelings of that description towards comely
persons of the other sex, who seem similarly affected towards us.
Youths. Your affections are engaged I Perdition !
Augustus ( desperately ). We will kill ourselves.
Linda. Ah ! That?s why you spoke about perdition : you?re going there.
Youths. No. We will live to be the downfall of the other fellows.
Girls. Indeed! {They laugh.)


Enter Jack the Bellman, ringing.
Jack. Take notice ! His Excellency the Governor, by the advice of the
Executive Council, authorises a reward of ï¿½5OO to be offered for information
which will lead to the arrest and conviction of the men who broke into the
bank and Government offices at Wardourville, and did there, by force of
arms, possess themselves of property to which by right they were not entitled.
Augustus. Tell us the details.
Jack. About noon yesterday several persons in masks entered the premises
described, simultaneously. They presented pistols in the orthodox manner at
the heads of all and sundry, plundered both places of what they wanted, and
stowed what is professionally called the ?swag? into a covered vehicle, which
was waiting outside, and to which four horses were attached. They then
drove away into the bush.
Girls. How dashing!
Youths. Pretty cool.
Augustus. Much money taken ?
Jack. None.
Blanche. Then they made off with the deeds or records?
Jack. No.
Algernon. Surely they didn?t take the furniture?
Jack. No; they didn?t take that.
Augustus. Then, in the name of goodness, what did they take?
Jack. The curled darlings of the Civil service and the golden youth of the
bank; their cuffs and collars; their nickel-headed canes; their cheap sac
suits and bad cigars.
Rose. Oh, Ichabod!
Blanche ( hysterically ). The glory has departed from Wardourville.
(Girls fall fainting into Youths' arms. Exit Jack , ringing hell.)
Youths. We know now to whom they are engaged.
Algernon. Three cheers for the bushrangers, and may their plunder
never be recovered.
Youths {depositing Girls on ground). Hip! hip! hurrah! {Girls re-
cover and rise to feet in disgust.)
Chorus. ? Girls. If in deep secretive parts
Of our timid little hearts
Oft? perplex?d and undecided?
Love, of late, for you abided ;
Now, without the least regret,
We announce those parts ?to let.?
Augustus. This is hard.
Blanche. You deserve it. You dump?d us down like so many bales of
wool.
Linda. We feel such treatment to be very lowering, and we resent it.
Youths. But, ladies ! consider the position. You can have no claim upon
us for maintenance. Being engaged elsewhere, you know, you should go
elsewhere tor support.


Girls. Shoo ! You disagreeable things !
Rose. We beg to intimate that this interview is concluded.
.Chords Youths.?
When gentlemen join in the amorous strife
Of winning a wife?
The practice is rife?
They deem it the pleasantest iisness in life,
If successful;
But those whose sweet speeches meet frigid replies,
Think contrariwise.
We cannot disguise,
To us, the disasters that hourly arise
Are distressful.
(They bow, and exeunt.')
Blanche. Look! there is Mariette. She is coming this way. Isn?t she
a pretty girl.
Rose. Girl; She looked the same age when my mother was going to
school, and for goodness knows how long before.
Linda. A woman, my dear, is only as old as she looks; Mariette, there-
fore, is entitled to call herself a girl.
Blanche. Whatever she may be, she is a useful member of society. Time
out of mind has she spent her small income on relieving the distressed, and
her leisure in promoting the love affairs of the neigbourhood.
Rose. Hush ! Here she is, clad in one of her indestructible old-fashioned
dresses. It dates back to the times when there were no European ladies in
these colonies, and when it was quite the mode for men to wear bangles.
(Enter Mariette.)
Girls. Ah, Mariette! How are you P
Mariette. Pleased to see you all, but indifferent in spirits. Ever since I
had the measles some time ago my memory has failed, and it?s loss is a never
ceasing source of trouble to me.
Girls. Indeed ?
Mariette. Yes; they say I?m as old as Methuselah, but all my past life
is a blank previous to last year.
Linda. How sad !
Mariette. My chagrin at the loss of this faculty is rendered infinitely more
poignant through an adventure which I have had lately. It moved my heart
with emotions that I thought were long dead within me; and it seemed to
relate to former days in some way which I cannot divine.
Blanche. How delightful! Oh, who is he?
Mariette. I said an adventure; not a ? he.?
Linda. Whoever heard of an adventure without a ? he.?
Rose. Or a misadventure?
Blanche. Tell us all about it.


Mariette. I bad wandered away into the ranges one morning, and feeling
tired, lay down under a gum tree and went to sleep. In a dream I saw a
fairy. She came to my side, and said that, before long, I should meet with a
rich lover, who would marry me. He would be over a hundred years old, but
would look under thirty. His name she would not tell, but she said he would
wear a tie-wig, lapelled coat, knee breeches, and low shoes with large buckles.
Only one clue would she give me to establish his identity, namely, that his
name is mentioned in history. She then disappeared and I awoke.
Linda. So Blanche was right; there is a man in the case.
Mariette. I havn?t seen him yet.
Rose. I don?t like to seem absurdly sceptical, but perhaps you never will.
Blanche. No one believes in fairies, now-a-days
Mariette. I beg your pardcn? l do. History has lately received my
careful attention. 1 have been trying to decide on which of the many names
therein belongs to my promised lover. I have also dipped a litttle into
Darwin?s ? Theory of Evolution,? to ascertain whether, by any natural law, a
young gentleman may be made out of an old one.
Linda. Try the Origin of Species,? by the same author.
Mariette. It shall he my cheerful study.
Blanche. Hav?n?t Hume, Smollett, Froude, Macaulay, and the rest of them
enlightened you in any way?
Mariette. They certainly allude to one who strikes my attention with
peculiar interest.
Linda. Who is he?
Mariette. Being doubtful, I don?t feel free to mention him. A girl has
no business to take liberties with the name of any gentleman when she is not
sure that he has intentions towards her. One ought to be specially careful not
to compromise distinguished historical personages.
Rose. We appreciate your delicacy. Many celebrities of the past are re-
corded to have been so shockingly immoral during their lives that the impu-
tation of post mortem gallantry, except it be conducted on the strictest
principles, might be fatal to their chances of salvation.
Linda. You can, however, tell us the initial of his surname.
Mariette. I think it?s C. He?s a captain of some sort, I believe. I must
leave you now?. Good-bye, ladies ? {Exit. Girls hurst out laughing ,)
Blanche.
There is many a queer romance
That you and I have heard,
But this, for mad extravagance,
Is much the most absurd.
Chorus.
Oh ! with laughter ive are bursting,
For the sequel we are thirsting.
Our Mariette,
Dame Fortune?s pet,
Her cap has set,
A swain to get.
Through hist?ry book
Her fancy?s took :
She?s badly shook
On Captain Cook ! (Exeunt laughing ,y


(Enter Youths dressed in military costumes , led by Augustus as captain )
Algernon. What extraordinary things men will do for love. Here are we r
the most inoffensive citizens in this peaceful country, launched in the hazar-
dous pursuit of hunting bushrangers, in order to regain the favour of the
ladies to whom we have lost our hearts.
Augustus. It is a novel experiment. There is something ridiculous in
the very audacity ot seeking a woman?s affection by trying to rescue her
intended from destruction. Really, I enjoy the joke.
Algernon. The actual rescue is not to take place, I apprehend ; that
would be beyond a joke. We are not going to risk our lives to save our
rivals, and, having saved them, to expose ourselves to the further risk of being
? cut out.?
Youths. Hardly!
Augustus. I perfectly agree with you. If we meet the bushrangers we
will tell them how to evade capture ; but we will take the credit of doing our
utmost to discover them. In the meanwhile, we will pose as military swells.
SONG.? Augustus.
Spectator impartial
Observe, we desire,
Our bearing how martial;
Our glances of fire.
Through skillful financing,
And glibly romancing,
We?ve managed these elegant clothes to acquire ;
We?d like you to look at their cut and admire.
Chorus. Yes ; upon us cast your eye ;
We?re the flower of our nation?
To protect the population
We?re prepared to do or die.
But for any other cry,
At the Governor?s dictation,
We, on no consideration,
Would attempt to hurt a fly.
The old serenaders,
To lutes with three strings,
Did sing of Crusaders,
Amongst other things,
Who rescued great ladies
From Saracen cadis.
And massacred flame-splitting dragons with wings ;
A lyrical air to the warrior clings.
Chorus. Yes ; upon us, etc.
No minstrels extol us
On valour?s pretence;
Because we patrol thus
For humdrum defence.
Yet. those who would plunder
Our country ?by thunder !
Like them, must not discount our courage immense !
Unless with their lives they are fain to dispense.
Chorus. Yes; upon us, etc.


Algernon. These uniforms, admirably as they fit us, are not quite as
good as new. The buttons are terribly scratched.
Augustus. Honourable marks of active service, my dear fellow That
garment belonged to an officer who is celebrated as having effected the most
masterly retreat in the Soudan war.
Algernon. Indeed !
Augustus. Yes; he saw an Arab looking towards him from the outside
of a zareba, so he dropped to the ground and wriggled on his stomach to a
more secure locality. It was a flinty place, and during the operation he
grazed the fastenings of his coat.
Youths. And the Arab ?
Augustus. Oh ! the Arab ! He was unarmed and blind ?
Algernon. Intrepid fellow!
Augustus, Hush ! I hear some one coming. Can it be the bushrangers?
Youths (terror-stricken'). What?
Algernon. Let us imitate the brave commander! ( Exeunt on their hands
and knees.)
Enter Mariette, -followed by Adolphus.
Mariette. I thought I heard a rustling in the grass. This is a dreadful
place for snakes.
Adolphus ( stumbling over prostrate soldier). Yes ; there is a red variety
about here which, they say, is peculiarly dangerous. If you get one of them
about your legs I wouldn?t answer for the consequences.
Mariette (sitting on log , and producing book ), I will rest here awhile.
Adolphus. Excuse rne a moment; I have an appointment. (Exit.)
Enter Jack in regimentals. He does not see Mariette ,
BALLAD. ? Jack.
? Ding-Dong Bell ?
Is a nursery rhyme ;
Oft I?ve heard it when a child.
Truth to tell,
In that rosy time
It"to slumber me beguiled.
Soft the sound,
In love begot,
Linger?d round
My infant cot;
She who sang it seemed to spell
Benisons in ? Ding-Dong Bell.?
? Ding-Dong Bell ??
Has a doleful chime
To more experienced ears;
Parallel
With a sinful prime
It ranges one?s early years.


Hence it?s tone?
Or high or low
Breathes a groan
For long ago.
Every crime and purpose fell
Stands arraign?d by ?Ding-Dong Bell.?
Ah, me ! It?s no use moralising when work has to be done. A military
bell-man is somewhat of a rarity, but an institution of the kind is very apropos \
for all soldiers are fte^licose.
Mariette. Yes ; ante helium.
Jack. Beelzebub! You gave me quite a start.
Mariette. I?m sorry.
Jack. What brings you here? Don?t you know it?s dangerous in the bush
now the outlaws are about ?
Mariette {jokingly). Why, I sought to see you, of course.
Jack. ?I came; I saw ; I conquered.? Fancy ! at my age.
Mariette {aside). The old stupid thinks lam in love with him.
Jack {aside), I?m blowed if I don?t make up to her. {He advances ami-
ably, hut hearing footstejjs, stops.) No; there?s someone coming.
{Enter Adolphus and Melissa arm in arm.)
Melissa. Will you always love me thus ?
Adolphus. 1 swear it.
Jacr. Sir ! You mustn?t swear before ladies.
Adolphus. What do you mean ? you meddling old eavesdropper!
Jack. Be respectful, sir! or I will court martial you. It is for young
fellows of your sort, who perform no better service to the country than to make
eyes and protestations to its female denizens, that this proclamation has been
specially framed. ( Unfolds poster.)
Adolphus {indignantly). For two pins I?d kick him.
Jack. Now, listen! His Excellency the Governor, by advice of the
Executive Council, having further considered the circumstances attending the
recent bushranging outrage, commands that in this Crown colony, pending
the capture of the freebooters, there shall be no more marriages solemnized.
Mariette. You don?t mean it?
Adolphus. Can there be anything in common between matrimony and
bushranging ?
Jack. It is argued that the desire to remove this embargo will induce the
single men more ardently to devote their energies to catching the miscreants.
Adolphus. 1 see.
Jack. r I hat is not all. Winning a lady?s heart, with the view to future
marriage, is now declared to be a felony. So, young man, take warning ; be
careful.
Adolphus. In that case, standing within three yards of a lady, ogling her
as you were lately ogling Mariette, is being in a public place with intent to
commit a felony. That is also an indictable offence, and I shan?t forget it.
{Mariette shudders.)
Jack. I think I?ll go. {Exit in discomfiture.)
{Adolphus turns to Melissa. Mariette crosses stage.)


Mariette.
This emphatic,
Emblematic
Token of affection true,
No erratic,
Operatic,
Moonstruck lover sends to you.
He who writes this billet-doux
Claims to know a thing or two.
For a pretty wife he?s yearning,
Versed in all domestic learning,
Music, Art, and mangle-turning :
1
Please arrange an interview.
Tra-la-la! Comprenez-vous ?
Tutti.
For a pretty, &c.
And he wants an Interview.
Adolphus.
Some phlegmatic,
Non-ecstatic
Quaker, Turk, or German Jew,
Or fanatic
Asiatic
He may be who so doth sue.
So, young lady, entre nous ;
Learn his grade and prospects too ;
Make him tell you all he?s earning.
Be discreet and eke discerning,
Ere?all other suitors spurning?
You shall wed you don?t know who.
Tra-la-la ! Comprenez-vous ?
Mariette. A cloth-oï¿½-gold rose, I declare. Who can have planted it in
the bush ? I?ll pluck it.
Adolphus. Then promise me that our union shall take place when they
are caught?
Melissa. Yes ; I promise that.
Adolphus ( embracing her). I will capture the bushrangers, dead or alive
Melissa. And we will start housekeeping on the ï¿½5OO reward.
Mariettb ( plucking rose). Oh !
Adol. and Mel. What?s the matter ?
Mariette. I have found in this flower a note addressed to me in a man?s
handwriting, signed ?C. C.? The sender wants me to meet him by appoint-
ment, Can it be my future husband of whom the fairy spoke ?
Adol. and Mel. Let?s have a look at it ?
Mariette. One should never show one?s love-letters. I will tell you what
it contains. ( Produces letter.)
TRlO. ?Mariette, \dolphus, and Melissa.


Adol. and Mel. ( Make him tell you, \ ?
Mariette. (He shall tell me, \ &c ?

Melissa.
This chromatic,
Aromatic
Rose, mayhap, at one time grew
In an attic
Trans-aquatic
Of the slums of Timbuctoo ;
Where they?ve somehow heard of you.
Blackamoors you should eschew.
Though with fervid love he?s burning,
Hesitate not in returning
This sweet plant and note concerning
His connbial menu.
Tra-la-la! Comprenez-vous f
Melissa.
Though with fervid, &c.
Make him tell, &c.
Adolphus.
Mariette.
For a pretty, &c.
Mariette. Your advice does not sound quite friendly.
Adolphus. It is well intended.
Melissa. To make appointments with strange men is not prudent.
Enter Captain Clive from behind tree. They start in surprise.
C.C. If the lady r has no objection, lam perfectly agreeable that friends
should be present at the interview. {To Adol.) Don?t be nervous; I?m
alive. Ah, Mariette ! may I salute you ? {Advances to hiss her.)
Mariette. Sir! ( Withdrawing.) lam unused to such treatment.
CO. I beg your pardon. Doubtless, it is a little shocking at first, when
one has been so long out of practice ; but, really, after the lapse of a century,
it surely must be ?half-past kissing time, and time to kiss again.?
Mariette {aside). He seems familiar, but I don?t know him. Oh, my
memory ! how you?ve played me false. {She taps her head.)
BALLAD.? Captain Clive.
?Tis well, they say, to seek a bride
When one has reach?d that cautious stage
Where young ideals are set aside
By wiser choice in middle age;
When man may judge with clearer sight?
Tho? still his heart throbs warm and young?
And learns to know his mind aright,
Yet hastens not to use his tongue,


Oh, grant the date
May never come
When all must mate
By rule of thumb.
Till those who?ve giv?n the plan a trial
Shall advocate such self-denial.
If maids were but as fond and free
To those who?ve come to manhood?s prime
As women kind were wont to be
In buoyant youth?s light-hearted time,
The well-matured and sober?d swain
Would be with Fortune hand and glove;
But while such doubts as these remain,
Give me the joys ol early love,
When eyes can speak
Of happiness,
And rosy cheek
A hope confess;
When thought is void of sordid leaven ;
When life on earth?s akin to heaven.
Melissa (to Adol.). Who is this extraordinary personage ?
Adol. I don?t know. Looks as though he?d strayed away from a fancy
dress ball.
C.C. (to Mar.). Introduce me, kindly, to these curiously attired friends of
yours.
Mak. Are you ?C.C. ??
C.C. Yes, I?m Captain Clive.
Mar. (aside). Good gracious! Then Macaulay was right after all.
C.C. Considering I was engaged to you once, I think you might have
known it.
Mab. If that is so, I have quite forgotten the circumstance.
C.C. Oh, the faithlessness of women !
Mar. Melissa ! Adolphus ! ?Captain Clive : the gentleman who wrote me
the letter. (Both sides how. Mariette and C.C. converse.)
Adol. Let us go; we?re not needed. (Exit arm in arm.)
C.C. So you cannot remember anything about your former life ?
Mar. Not an incident.
C.C. Well?the fates are very hard upon me. This is an obstacle which I
had not counted upon. Hallo !
(Enter Girls , with hooks and luncheon baskets. They do not see C.C. and
Mariette. They dance and sit.
Chorus. ?Girls. We delight in the beautiful glades
Of the forest to join in a ramble,
And to dance in arboreal shades,
Where wallabies frolic and gambol;


Or to lounge on the banks of a brook,
?Neath the boughs of a silvery wattle,
Killing time with a yellow-back?d book,
Plus a biscuit, some cheese, and a bottle.
A bottle?A bottle !
(They flourish bottles , and put them to their lips.)
Linda. Hush! {Girls hide bottles in their shirts.)
Rose. Look!
Girls ( catching sight of C.C. and Mariette). Oh !
Blanche. Captain Cook after all. A glorious resurrection!
Linda. No ! Some one is masquerading to deceive us. ( Girls rise to
feet.)
Rose (advancing timidly) Excuse me young man, are you Captain
Cook ?
C.C. Do you know him ?
Rose. He was to marry a friend of ours. We were to be bridesmaids.
C.C. You?re rather late ; he?s married.
Girls (amazed). What ! You and Mariette are married ?
C.C. No ; Captain Cook?s married. He is also dead?for that matter?
more than 100 years ago. As acquaintances of his I must congratulate you
on your very youthful appearance. ( Girls look shocked.) I?m no chicken
myself, but for really well-preserved articles in?forgive the expression?
animated mummies, you bear the palm.
Girls ( indignantly). That is too bad.
Maribtie. You deserved it for being so inquisitive. ( Enter Jack un-
observed.) This gentleman is Captain Clive, and he aspires to become ray
husband. {C.C. and Girls bow.)
Jack {furiously). He does ! does he? This is, then, my rival. .Re-
venge ! {Exit,)
Linda. Truly, Cupid gives us strange surprises.
Rose. He does, indeed !
BALLAD.? Mariette.
Say not the story of Love is old,
Though the traits of his art are widely read ;
For ne?er was his tale so fully told
That nothing remain?d which had not been said.
If each of his plots ends much the same,
Their incidents vary, and that alone
Saves the narration from growing tame,
And gives him an interest all his own.
Under the yoke of the tender spell
That?s wrought by the passage of Cupid?s dart,
Where are the lovers who cannot tell
What?s welcome and fresh to a kindred heart ?
?Mid northern snows or in tropic blaze?
When the wedding?s pass?d with the afternoon?
Comes not the rare bewildering daze
Of a novel joy in the honeymoon ?


Ever in honour oï¿½ Love I?ll sing,
Who?s always the patron of maidens been ;
Whose arts and smarts and prospective ring,
Though old as the hills, are as fresh and green.
The wind which over the garden blows
Bears a perfumed message of hope lor me,
Saying that Love?s like a fragrant rose
Which blossoms and blooms perenially.
C.C. That?s comforting, anyhow. I enclosed my letter in a rose.
(Enter Jack, with Soldiers under Augustus.')
Jack ( pointing to C.C. and Mariette). In the Queen?s name, I call upon
you to arrest these two persons for conspiracy with intent to marry, in
defiance of the existing law.
Augustus ( advancing to C.C. and Mariette). You are our prisoners.
C.C. Surely, in such a place as this, where there seems to be a large and
increasing population, marriage is not immoral ? What a country !
Jack. I also require you to attach these young ladses as aiders and
abettors.
Youths. Faith ! we?re attached to them already.
Augustus. Ladies ! you?re ours. By the by, Crier: having brought
about this happy state of affairs, kindly add to the obligation by introducing
me to the male delinquent.
Mariette. Tell that odious man to leave us. I'll introduce you !
Augustus. Certainly. ( Waving hand.) Good-bye, Crier! {Jack looks
indignant.)
Youths. Ta, ta, Crier ! {Exit Jack shaking fist.)
Mariette. Gentlemen!? Captain Clive, R.N.! Captain Clive!? the
Wardourville Invincibles! {C.C. and Youths how.)
Augustus. What service ?
C.C. That of His Majesty King George.
Augustus, Ah ! King George of Tonga ?
C.C. {proudly). King George the Third of Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, sir!
Augustus {staggered). Oh!?Yes!?l see. On the retired list! {To
Girls.) Well, my dears, the law has made us your temporary guardians.
Is there still no hope of securing a permanent billet in that capacity!
Goodness ? {Girls kneel at feet of Youths.)
Youths. Ob, really!
Chorus. ? Girls. Through the forest lands around
Let no echo rude resound ;
Ye breezes pause above.
In a quietude profound
May the Universe be bound,
While Beauty pleads with Love.


Chorus.?Youths. Nay, gentle ladies, pr?ythee rise,
Nor lowly linger at our feet;
Yon slight the charms we idolise?
Rise, gentle ladies, we entreat.
{Girls stand. They hold Soldiers by arms , and gaze into faces.)
Girls. We conjure you to let bye-gones be bye-gones. Think no more
of our treatment to you this morning : we?re not engaged.
Youths. Not engaged ?
Linda. No; we never were. The idea you formed on that subject was
a misconception.
SONG.? Blanche.
?Mongst the male up-country ? push ?
Fashion's votaries are few ;
Busy toilers in the bush
Can?t be always on review.
Hence, for ?walking-sticks? and ? sparks,?
Takes the raa?den in distress
Bank and Civil Service clerks?
Brummels of the wilderness.
Gtrls,
Youths,
Do you wonder that it?s so ?
Do we wonder? Oh dear, no !
Though with clerks we congregate,
It?s a mere aesthetic whim ;
She who takes a clerk to mate
Often needs to work for him.
We, who cannot keep a clerk,
Food and dress, and honeydew,
Seek a matrimonial ark
With companions such as you.
Girls.
Youths
Do you wonder that it?s so ?
Do we wonder ? Oh dear, no !
Linda. The long and short of it is, when it comes to husbands, ws prefer
the deserving and useful to the purely ornamental.
Augustus. Then you do love us, after all ?
Chorus.?Girls.
Yes ! our hearts are in commotion,
With an amorous devotion ;
Will you please to have us, pray ?
For, beneath your ardent glances
All our former flames and fancies
From our favor fall away.
(They droop on Youths shoulders.)


FULL CHORUS.? GirIs and Youths.
As flowers to the summer sun,
In dewy fragrance, one by one,
Their dainty petals spread;
As children to their mothers run,
Before the day has well begun,
For drink and daily bread ;
As tiny creeks to rivers grow,
And onward to the ocean flow
With rushing ecstacy :
So maidens to their lovers go,
To talk in whispers sweet and low,
To kiss and blush and sigh.
( They sigh and kiss.)
C.C. Oh, encore I Very pretty! Mariette! you try it!
Mabiette. Not yet. My memory, you know. ( She curtsies.)
C.C. Gentlemen, excuse me interrupting ? I see the Town Crier coming
this way. If you remain in that position he?ll ask you to arrest yourselves
on suspicion of the same offence as we have committed. That would be a
painfully complicated proceeding, and should be avoided.
Augustus. Unlimber! Attention! [Youths release Girls.)
{Enter Jack , in haste.)
Jack. Such news, captain ! The bushrangers are captured.
All. Nonsense !
Jack. It?s a fact. Here they are !
{Music. Enter King Solomon and Three Widows , much aged , followed hy
Adolphus presenting pistol at them.)
Adolphus. Halt! [He hows all round.) Your crusade is ended; behold
the culprits!
Augustus. What! These scare-crows ?
Adolphus. lam not responsible for their personal appearance, but they
are the outlaws. Ho, there ! Come this way.
(Enter three woe-hegone men in shirts and trousers.)
Adolphus. These are the unfortunate victims of the outrage. Not so
clean, you see, as the principals. In handing the lot over to you, understand
I claim the Government reward of ï¿½3OO.
Melissa ( entering and embracing Adolphus). We will never part.
Augustus. The outlaws being in custody, the law against engagements
and matrimony is repealed. Therefore, ladies, Mariette and Captain Clive,
you are free.
All. Hear, hear!
Mariette [to C.C.). I will not marry you until you prove to me that you
are the person whom you claim to be : the husband of whom the fairy told
me.


Rose. As friends of this lady, we also require proof.
C.C. Very good; I accept the position. (To Mariette.) What is this
star around your neck ?
Mariette. An old ornament of mine. I forget how I came by it.
C.C. Hold that in your hand. Wish for your memory to be restored, and
for proof to be furnished of ray identity.
Mariette. I wish that both these things may happen. (Startled.) Why,
I know you now. You?re my long-lost lover of a century ago, and you?re
true to me still.
C.C. Though one hundred years have passed, I love you one hundredfold
more intensely.
Youths. The real ? Sir Roger,? after all.
Mariette. How well you look !
C.C. And you ; you?re as handsome as ever. [(They embrace.) Do you
think you?ll be happy with me.
Mariette, I?ll try.
DUET.? Captain Clive and Mariette.
In other times, when Cupid roam?d apart
From bosoms where he pleaseth now to stay,
By thought, with deft imaginative art,
All fondly drew their future fiancees.
Each maiden dreamt, perchance, a prince to wed,
A courtly knight, or paragon of style ;
Bach comely youth, in fancy, languished,
A favor?d consort ?neath a queenly smile.
C.C. f Oh, lovely girl, so sweet, so unaffected !
Mar. \ Oh, tender swain, whose suit has been accepted !
C.C. f Oh, gentle one, new pledged to be a bride !
Mar. I Oh, would-be husband, pr?ythee now decide !

Mariette. The realm of bliss, where fact and fancy dwell
In wedded yoke, in truth, is but a dream
Which after years discover and dispel;
Here like mates like, and order reigns supreme.
Our duty is, in ev?ry married phase
Of life, to seek assistance from above
To make our faults enhance our winsome ways,
And bind us faster in the thongs of love.
Mar. V Oh, blest the man who?s served with proper zeal !
C.C. | Oh, blest the bride whose husband?s good and leal!

C.C. I Oh, happy twain whose love is made to wear t

Mar. | p or morta i nee( ] s they?ll prove a perfect pair.


Augustus. The Wardourville Invincibles will now form a court martial,
with comprehensive and summary powers. Prisoners ! step forward.
Algernon. Guilty or not guilty ?
King S. Guilty !
Algernon. Have you any statement to make ?
King S. Yes. I would like to explain that, notwithstanding my sub-
stantial appearance, I am in reality the ghost of a king once mighty in the
Paciiic.
C.G. Good heavens! It?s King Solomon !
Jack. Silence in court!
Algernon. Prisoner ! Do you wish to plead insanity ?
King S. No. I only want to speak the truth.
Algernon. Then don?t ask this honorable court to believe that you?re a
phantom !
C.C. It?s true !
Augustus. We?ll reserve the point.
King S. A century ago, a bishop of my church invoked a curse upon me.
It was, that after death my ghost should walk the earth until some strange
event should occur, the nature of which was not explained. When that
happens I may rest in peace. For many years I tramped alone about the
wild Australian bush as wretched as the traditional bandacout. At length,
desperate with the misery of my existence, I resolved to commit a crime of
some sort to get a rest in gaol. I therefore kidnapped these young clerks.
These women had nothing to do with it; I met them afterwards. They also
are relicts of olden days, and suffer under a bishop?s curse; but they are
mortal, and have mortal cravings.
Algernon. Have you anything to say ?
Chorus.?Widows. We have but one plea to render,
Since we?ve lost our husbands tender
We each seek a new defender,
Tall, and masculine in gender.
Augustus. And this means ?
Widows. We want to get married
Girls. Good gracious !
Adolphus. When I took them in charge, Ihey actually wanted to marry
me. (Melissa embraces him.)
{Enter Messenger. He hands note to Augustus .)
Augustus. Ha! This is from the Executive Council. It states that since
the WardourviUe outrage, extensive deficiencies have been found in the
accounts of all the clerks employed in the banks and Government offices.
Only three were actually kidnapped ; the others, fearing discovery of their
embezzlements, took to flight, and allowed people to imagine they had been
stolen away. The Council holds that had the bushrangers not abducted the
clerks before the court, the frauds would have remained undiscovered. On
that account the outlaws are pardoned.
All. Hurrah !


King S. ( disconsolately ). A lonely old ghost once again.
Algernon. Nonsense, man. Go on a starring tour to Great Britain, like
the late Cetewayo, You?ll be lionised.
Widows. Is there any market for us in England ?
Algernon. I?m afraid not.
Widows. Then we must go on the parish.
Augustus. Not exactly. {To Jack.) Bring forward the clerks ! The
crime of embezzlement being a very serious thing, this court intends to inflict
upon you an exemplary punishment. Our order is that you marry these
women, at once, and that by this decree, de facto , you are married. (Each
widow appropriates one clerk. Thunder and red fire.)
SONG.? King Solomon ( tragically).
In those few words that you have spoken
The Bishop?s curse has spent its force ;
The spell that held me here is broken?
I quit the earth without remorse.
And, going hence, no doubts dismay me
Of what my future state shall be;
For all the sins the saints can blame me
I?ve paid an earthly penalty.
Full Chorus.
He professes,
He possesses
The requisite authority
To join ? the great majority
For through these women being mated
The Bishop?s curse is dissipated?
He?s much to be congratulated.
King S. {sinking through trap). Good-bye! good-bye for evermore !
C C. Farewell, old fellow ! Au revoir !
Chorus. By Jove ! he?s going through the floor,
{King Solomon vanishes.)
Augustus {pointing to Clerks and Widows). See these people safely on
their honeymoon, Crier! and then?oh! go and drown yourself! {ExitJack r
Clerks , and Widows.)
C.C. Has this court similar matrimonial powers in regard to us ?
Augustus. Not as a court, but as deputy-registrar, lam able to celebrate
any number of marriages by mutual consent. When you are all ready, please
mention it. (All confer.)
{Enter Fairies.)
Winging
Springing,
Swift as thought and free as air;
Clinging,
Singing,
Here and there and ev?rywhere,
Seeing all goes right and fair
We have not much time to spare.


Youths and Girls (startled). Oh !
C.C. These are the only witnesses that were wanting to prove that lam
what 1 profess to be.
All. After this we?ll believe anything.
C.C. (to Fairies). You have no objections on this occasion, I hope.
Queen. None. To-day we come as friends to congratulate all of you, and
to offer our services in the not very remote future as fairy god-mothers.
CC. Then we musn?t keep the ladies waiting.
Augustus. Gentlemen ! take your partners; for life. (They do so.)
Mariette (to Fairies). Havn?t you anyone to marry?
Queen. No. We are widows, and shall never seek for second husbands
On Yubawonga Island, in the Pacific, we have each erected a marble monu-
ment, partly in memory of our departed helpmates, the Lieutenant and
members of Captain Clive?s expedition of 1788, and partly as an everlasting
memento of the fatal mistake we made when we presumed to forestall Divine
vengeance, by punishing offences which human law and society failed to
punish. The futility of our effort is shown by the fact that it has taken 100
years to avenge the first misdeed of the kind that came under our notice. As
it is plain that?if each case is to take a century to settle?even fairydom
cannot cope with the unpunished wickedness of the world, we have resolved
to give up the experiment and revert to our former state.
Chorus. ? Fairies. Sweetly languid all day long,
Revelling in wealth of time,
Chorus we in tuneful song,
Harmonize in mirthful rhyme.
Else we gaze in dreamy way
In our mirrors, thus and thus,
Contemplating rich display
Of the charms that blend in us.
Tutti.
Floating through infinite space,
Pretty, coquettish, and bright,
Perfect in contour and grace,
Cloth?d in diaphanous plight ;
Bath?d in a luminous glow,
Tender, prismatic, and rare,
We 1
They j are a i r^es i you know,
Spirits and sprites of the air.
