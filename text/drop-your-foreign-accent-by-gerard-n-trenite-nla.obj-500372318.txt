PREFACE
Another book on English sounds? Where is the studious
Oliver, asking for some more? Indeed, the production of
a new one can only be justified by its being a novel one.
A glance at the following pages may suffice to show the
writer’s attempt to supply a novelty. This is not a guide.
It is an exercise-book. It is less like a drill-master, who
teaches you how to perform your feats, than like a set of
gymnastic apparatus on which you have to perform them
yourself —vocal gymnastics. I have indeed' given a few
indispensable directions, sufficient, I think, for those who
do not want any exhaustive, scientific treatment of the
subject, but the very essence of this book lies in the
exercises. If these pages could speak, they would not say
“learn!” but “do!”
The importance of a pronunciation free from foreign
accent should not be underrated. Your most distinguished
speaker, wonderful though his fluency may be, correct his
grammar and admirable his choice of words, is the awk-
ward man as long as he has not dropped his foreign
accent. He either irritates, or makes himself the butt of
the company, nay, he is as often as not misunderstood
and does not know why.
He irritates. There is a distinct element of courtesy in
the foreigner’s correct pronunciation—the thought: I have
deemed it worth my while to grapple with the difficulties
of your language, till I have overcome them. This pleases
as much as slovenly pronunciation displeases. It is an
open letter of recommendation, like a clear handwriting,
a neat dress or a handsome face.


He is misunderstood and does not know the cause. For
his faults may be ever so slight. A scarcely audible buzz
omitted where it should be heard, uttered where it should
not be, may render his most beautiful phrases unintelli-
gible. He means had and says hat —his pungent remark
is lost upon his hearer. His placing of the tongue tip a
fraction of an inch too far back may have a similarly
disastrous effect. He wants to talk of something and his
hearer is convinced that he is speaking of a few persons
who are chanting. He wishes to intimate that he has
concealed the poor fugitive and says, on the contrary,
that he has given him a sound thrashing (p. 18). “What
do you think of her age?” asked, or rather tried to ask
a charming foreign young lady, when the guest had left.
“Quite right,” answered the English hostess, “she does
not drop it” (p. 24). Thus you must not be surprised,
Madame, when, following the directions of the shopwalker
at your request for metal finger-caps, you arrive at the
department of musical instruments (p. 50), not to mention
the shower of abuse you may expect when you meant to
inquire after a wine-merchant’s cellar (p. 90).
On the other hand, if you have not practised the nice
distinctions of sounds yourself and consequently do not
hear them in others, you may fail to understand the
person who observes them. If, young man, the kind lady
at the head of the table asks you: “Is your celery as
you like it?” you may perhaps mutter something about
its being quite unsatisfactory, referring to your “screw,”
simply because you hear no difference in the sounds of
man and men (p. 61).
When you have solved these problems, you will not
hesitate to admit the necessity of “vocal gymnastics.”


In Appendix 111 I offer the reader a small collection of
phonetical paradoxes. I gave it the form of a “poem,”
so that rhyme and rhythm might have a soothing effect
on the bewildered learner, and lead him into the right
path, the former in many cases indicating sound, the
latter stress. Thus even—Stephen (p. 117), senator —
spectator (p. 112).
The last line contains an advice; my advice is—don’t
take it.

DIRECTIONS
I. Do your exercises in a standing position, upright, with
head proudly held, chest forward, your book lying on a
tall music-stand in front of you. Sitting at a table with
bent head and compressed lungs, you lose the thorough
command of your speech-organs.
2. Control your breathing. Fill your lungs down to the
bottom. Do not let any breath escape uselessly, that is,
do not puff out air-stream without speech-sound.
3. Speak in a loud, clear voice. This does not mean
screaming or straining, which should be carefully avoided.
Keep your natural note, but send the air straight and
boldly through your mouth.
4. Exaggerate. Form your sounds so distinctly as
would make you ridiculous in society. In rapid colloquial
conversation you are bound to tone down your extrava-
gant sounds and the result will be clearness and dis-
tinction.
5. Use your hand-glass freely, when necessary. E.g.
practising th (p. 55), watch your mouth, and see if the
tongue tip is plainly visible between the teeth. Smith’s
thrift; Smi —out with it, and back again for the s, quickly
out again for the th of thrift. Watch your lips pronouncing
English sh, French ch and German sch. In sh see that
they are left in their natural position, flat; in ch and sch
you observe some rounding of the lips, protruding
(pouting). See the difference in shoe, chou and Schuh.
6. Separate diphthongs. E.g. ou, a compound of ah
and 00. First pronounce the parts with a little pause
between them: ah . . . oot, next say ahoo, without a


pause, but still as a distinct “two-sound,” and finally
melted together into one sound as it were.
7. Learn some rhymes by heart. If I caused the blood
in my poetic vein to flow rather profusely, it was not
the Muse who prompted me, but my experience as a
teacher. Firstly, rhythm and rhyme may act as fly-
wheels, strengthening and equalising the movement of
the vocal organs. Secondly, the poetical form will enable
you to do an exercise without your book, by memory.
Now, having chosen those which contain your special
stumbling-blocks, you may conveniently practise them
during a lonely walk, sitting all by yourself in a railway
carriage, etc.
A general remark to wind up with. When you have
really dropped your foreign or other objectionable accent,
don’t be too correct in “undress” conversation. I won’t
blame you very much for saying once in a while collo-
quially ast, lechuno, choosdy, neycher, eysher, meaning
asked, let you know, Tuesday, nature, Asia. “What with
teacher, creature and heat you the Superman will have
more rimes to Nietzsche than he will really want,” says
Bridges in his most amusing Tract. Why, my young dandy,
I will even forgive your making sure sound like the sur-
name of G. 8., but if you say somesing, goot, dot or fery
veil —I’ll beecher!


DROP YOUR FOREIGN ACCENT
CHAPTER I
VOICED AND VOICELESS CONSONANTS
(If necessary, study Chapter III first)
The first stumbling-block is the pronunciation of final
voiced consonants, b, d, v, z, g. They are called voiced
from the “murmur” which is heard, even when they are
whispered; the letters p, t, f s, ch, k, formed in the same
place, in the same manner, produce no “voice” in the
phonetical sense of the word. Whisper, loud, as in a stage
“aside,” s — z, s — z, several times, and you will hear the
difference; what is more, you will feel it by placing your
finger on your Adam’s apple: when whispering z, etc.,
you will feel the vibration of the vocal chords. Do the
same with the other pairs. Now say:

Grace. Mrs. Ross has got si# pens of sixpence. His nice

This house and these houses. John’s horse prances and
loses his hoofs. Crusoe misses his horses and his glasses.
I lose the use of loose u’s. The deuce of clubs and the ace
of diamonds. The vice of lies is worse; he errs. The cries
of mice pierce my ears crosswise. Bert’s words of peace
appease the serf’s nerves. Ass’s head.

The following exercise is an optical deception: final made
into initial to facilitate voiced pronunciation. Instead of
find out you are tempted to say fint out, but you have no
trouble in saying fine doubt. Read find out as if it were
written fin dout. This is easy enough. Thus, to please the
ear, lead your mouth by the nose!

{He died of old age on the third of August.) I playe dinstea

A frien din nee di za frien dindee di think. [A friend in

Frightene dan alaraie di calle dalfre dan dwilliam.

Woul dyou be kin denough to sen dus some goo dol dwine?
[Would you he kind enough to send us some good old wine?)
Wa zit ma din Englan dor wa zit ma din Germany? {Was
it made in England or was it made in Germany?)
In this exercise you must keep the murmur sounding like
a continuous bass note. Do you know the “Dance of Sylphs”
in Berlioz’s Faust ? The low dof the ’cellos, ninety bars at
a stretch? Well, then, set the fly-wheel going!
27. Bad, odd lords, kind, good, sad wives
Lose in waves of ponds hard lives.
Leaves of daisies, buds of posies,
Words of Lizzy’s, friends of Rose’s,
Powdered heads, weird wizards’ eyes,
Mob-mind leads renowned allies.
Bob heaved gladly, nodded sadly.

Fred reads loud of Bob’s red cabs,
Cubs, wolves, lobsters, cods, toads, crabs.
Bradford rides round Leeds towards Sydney,

Midnight goodwives, Forbes abhorred.

Lads in booths with carved knives lauded.

And got into a gig,
Her legs in rugs and rags,

Now in the grassy ground
Her gloomy grave is dug.
Guy’s fags bagged his big mugs,
And eggs, with base intrigue,
The smugglers tugged his brigs,
And gagged the pig-legged league.

This letter represents three sounds 1
{a) Clear, after breath consonants, clip (symbol 1).
(b) Semi-dark, initial or between vowels, like, willing
(symbol I) .
[c] Dark, final or before voiced consonants, mil, building
(symbol 1).
Place the tip of the tongue against the upper gums
and raise the front for clear 1, the back for dark 1. Let
the breath escape at one or at both sides. (Lateral con-
sonant) .

CHAPTER III
S
Do you pronounce the s clearly ? There is a common defect,
called “lisping.” It consists in pushing the tongue tip too


far forward in forming the sibilant The result is a sound
which is very much like th. for s the tongue should
form a shallow little channel, the point being lifted up so
as nearly to touch the hard palate —not the teeth. Direct the
breath straight, hiss sharply and don’t allow any breath
to spread:
56. Yesss, thisss, nurssse, houssse, loossse, ceassse,
horssse, assside, alssso, the ussse, the excussse, pro-
missse, cassse, massson, disssappear, disssobedient,
desssolate, comparissson, crusssade, curiosssity, gene-
rosssity, ussselesssnesss.
57. Asks, discs, desks, tusks, gasps, wasps, lisps,
nests, waists, lists, ghosts, feasts, masts, basks, casks,
flasks, masks, tasks, risks, obelisks, husks, rusks,
asps, clasps, grasps, suggests, chests, jests, pests,
rests, crests, forests, tests, protests, guests, requests,
methodists, materialists, antagonists, wrists, assists,
dramatists, artists, exists, posts, trusts, thrusts,
coasts, joists, wastes, roasts, lasts.
58. Sincere sorrow, a sarcastic smile, salicylic acid, a son
of the soil, a snail’s pace, a severe sentence, a serial story,
the senior service, the smart set, the seven sages, Somer-
set House.
59. A sop to Cerberus. Simson seeks the sunny side.
Skilful skaters skim the ice. For conscience’ sake Sam
sold the sad stuff at a sacrifice. The self-satisfied censor
saw the stars. Sapped by excess Solomon sipped a Scotch
and soda. Sally made a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.
Sweat and be saved, says a statesman.


Another mistake is the substitution of sh for s before
p and t, which is usual in German, schpott, schteht.
Foreigners, especially Germans, often find great difficulty
in forming this sound correctly, saying shpot, shtate.
What with this and a voiceless d truthful Hans or
Gretchen may be wont to call a spade a schpate!
The best way to overcome it seems first to insert an
intermediate sound, and then to repeat the word, dropping
the intermediate: se-pot, spot, se-tate, state .
60. Support sport
supper spur
supply splice
sepoy spoil
separate spirit
Saturn stem
setter stir
sitting sting
suppose spoke
settee steam
61. Shakespeare. She stoops. Shaving-stick. Short story.
I shall stop. Slipshod. Shop-steward.
¥
62. Spick and span. Stop at Springfield Station. Stand
still, sturdy stranger. The stiff, stupid, stingy spinster
spoke spitefully. Spare the stick and spoil the student.
63. Strong, stout, stalwart starter, stay;
Spurn a starving, splotchy stray.
Stepping, straining,
Stumbling, spraining,
Spare my splendid stones, stop staining,
Sparsit split my sparkling spray.
Read each of these exercises at least three times aloud;
very slowly at first, then in the ordinary tempo of collo


quial speech, and finally as fast as you can manage without
stumbling.
64. Sound your s’s crisply, hiss ’em,
Fix lax muscles, fast but lissom,
S is voiceless: uselessness,
Cease from lisping —s is s!
65. Simson Smibe, the staunchest scribe,
Versed in artists’ jests and jibe,
Scribbles, for this simple reason:
It’s just now the silly season.
66. Sesame, Sesame,
Studding-sails soil some Saxon sea.
Slashed sleeve, store-room; smash Smike’s jorum.
Snooker, sneer at snip-snap-snorum.

Gasps and grasps amidst casks, *
Amidst masts for vast flasks.
Sag to south-side, hist! Sam seems a soaker.

CHAPTER IV
SH
Sh does not sound like French ch or German sch, formed
by a broad stream of breath passing between the teeth
over a rather deep channel made by the tongue, through
rounded lips. In sh the channel is shallow, and the lips are
not rounded (protruding, pouting), but flat, in their natural
position, so that sh approaches s. Compare E. shoe, F.
chou and G. Schuh. This sound, voiced: zh, only occurs in
the middle of English words, like leisure and in loan
words, like rouge. Observe that E. zh is not the same as
F. j, and compare, apart from other differences in the
sounds of these words: F. ai-je —E. azure, F. les jeux —
E. leisure.

CHAPTER V
R
The r is only pronounced as a consonant before a vowel:
red, for all. When no vowel follows, it is either silent:
art, or vocalized: more. That is, it dulls down to a mere
voice-murmur, the sound you utter when hesitating in


your speech: "This man . . . er . . . what’s his name . . .
er . . . etc. 1
In Scotland the r is always pronounced.
Silent and vocalized r
76. Err, sir, fur, her, stir, were, purr, myrrh. Figure,
pleasure, measure, signature, lecture, culture, adventure,
torture, pasture, gesture, mixture, nature.
77. Her nurse deserves her earnings for her work. The
first girl hurt her nerves. Burns’s early works were the
worst in the world. Turner burnt the fern. Learn words of
mercy, stern Sir Herbert Gurney.
78. Bertie heard her hurdy-gurdy.
The thirty-first he learned or heard;
Sir, he blurted, hurt and wordy.
Curly work-girls turned and stirred.
Sturdy, murdered churls were burly,
Curse the earth, Gurth, serve the world.
Wordsworth errs, sir, hers were surly.
Dirty curs, her nurse unfurled.
This sound is represented in various ways, ar, er, ir, etc.
79. Beggar, collar; September, fender; sir, elixir;
Cheshire, Devonshire; sailor, tailor; augur, murmur;
pleasure, future; labour, honour; centre, acre; martyr,
zephyr; perturber.
1 This sign, er, for the hesitating sound, clearly shows that the r
followed by no vowel, may be written, but must not be pro-
nounced. Whoever, hesitating in his speech, would dream of
uttering the consonant r ?


It sometimes almost sounds like ah ;
“ There was an old man of Columbia,
Who was thirsty and called out for some beer.”
Lear, A Book of Nonsense
“ Couldst thou wish for lineage higher
Than twin sister of Thalia?”
Keats
This, however, is the speech of a swell, and should be
avoided in actual conversation. But in the following
exercises you must play the dandy and make the r sound
like ah, as a stepping-stone to the right pronunciation.
80. My dear Peer, fear clear beer.
Wire, tyre, fire higher, liar, (lyre).
Sour, hour, shower, cower.
Dare, care, fair pair, where were their squares?
Bx. Higher spire, dire fire,
I admire your desire
To expire with Sophia,
Shyer friar, in the choir.
You perspire, squire, Sire,
Wire, slyer liar; tyres.
It transpires that Uriah
Hired, tired, drier quires.
82. You’re seedy, my ducky. Look here,
I just got a splendid idea:
You order some beer —
The true panacea,
And your troubles will soon disappear.


The e of -ed (Past Participle) is only pronounced after t
or d: petted {-id), nodded, but guessed {-t), skilled (-d), and
the following pairs form perfect rhymes:
83. Tact—lacked, best—guessed, least—ceased, taste
—based, soft —coughed, worst —nursed, shaft —laughed,
last —passed, stand—planned, second —beckoned, heard—
stirred, dullard —coloured.
In the following words the three letters preceding the
final d sound like one long murmur:
84. He staggered back, stammered, shuddered, scam-
pered off, covered with a battered hat, and in a checkered
suit. He shivered and entered, sheltered by the porch.
A powdered, well-mannered, good-humoured, good-
natured servant ushered him in, lowered the blinds,
offered him an upholstered chair, ordered him to be
catered for and disappeared. He was captured, collared,
injured, dishonoured belaboured, tortured, quartered,
murdered, interred.
Silent or Vocalized r
85. It is your turn. There were the largest churches of
Ireland. Summer has disappeared earlier this year. Four
storm-wom Worcestershire porters or warders. The Earl
of Harcourt was hardly ashore, when he ordered a motor-
car. Their sisters care for more furniture. Oxford boarders
wear their mortar-boards. Forlorn, uncared-for girl, for-
bear. The darker part of the Northern hemisphere. Four
score years older. The other forty works of the third floor
were water-colours; there were neither worse nor better


pictures. The figures of our first artist are measured by
measures of another, far finer, deeper nature.
86. In our parlour near your fires
Bertha heard her father snore;
Arthur Wardour’s punctured tyres
Were there scattered on the floor.
Four yards farther than her father
Poured her mother gingerbeer.
You’re not thirsty? Search the larder,
Covered jars are stored there, dear.
Poor, fair girl, you’re nearly starving.
There were hardly any more.
It’s hard work, sir, ironing, carving,
Near your yard, before your door.
87. Poor Lenore tore her hair, her fair hair,
For her warm heart was sore, with despair.
With a dire desire
A fierce, burning fire,
To murder herself then and there.
88. There were four sisters of Birmingham,
There’s a wonderful yam, dear, concerning’m:
Forty dollars a year
They earned, as I hear,
Merely searching tom papers, and burning ’em.
89. Your fervour, fair girl, dear Sophia,
Your splendour, your mirth, I admire,
But once in Moldavia,
You’ll change your behaviour
And turn an inordinate liar.


Consonantal r
Before a vowel r is a consonant, formed by the tongue tip
and the hard palate. Standard English has no uvular
(throat) r, which is rather like the ch in German ach, and
Scotch loch. If your natural r is this scraping sound, it
should be eradicated mercilessly. It is strictly forbidden.
Is not the rather common substitution of w, e.g. vewy for
very, due to carelessness or affectation, an indication of the
place where the r is produced, the front? This mispronuncia-
tion could never be the lot of a uvular, a back-letter.
Uvular r is common in German, Dutch and Parisian
French; not in Southern French, where, owing to the
influence of the Italian, the r is generally trilled. This
rolled r is also used in Central French by actors and singers,
being more sonorous, harmonious and less fatiguing for
the throat. But in Southern English it is “taboo.” Unless
you succeed in throwing it off, your pronunciation is bad,
however correct the rest of your sounds may be. I have
often heard it said by throat-r sufferers, for sufferers they
are, that they are totally unable to produce a front-r.
They err. Their organs of speech are not different from
those of the Southern Englishman. Patience and persever-
ance! Labour conquers everything. The most convenient
stepping-stone is the d. Say fd-fd-fd, etc,, at least twenty
times, with increasing speed to the veriest ratatat, and
the result will be a sound, hardly discernible from a trilled
r. Perform this rattle-snake trick several times over.
Next do the following exercises;
90. Bedick, bdick {brick); kedy, kdy {cry); dedeam,
ddeam {dream); fedee, fdee {free); gedeat, gdeat {great) ;


pedice, pdice {price)', tedee, tdee (tree); steding, stding
(string); shediek, shdiek (shriek).
91. Pdeach, gdeat pdeacher, pdaise, Cdeation,
Ddeam, pdoud, cdown pdince, fdee fdom gdief,
Pdactise pdetty pdonunciation,
Bding bdight pdose, Bdown, stdong, fdesh, bdief.
92. Preach, great preacher, praise Creation,
Dream, proud crown prince, free from grief,
Practise pretty pronunciation,
Bring bright prose, Brown, strong, fresh, brief.
93. Treacle trickled from Frank’s apron,
Trim prim Granny tried to dry,
Frank broke strong, green, criss-cross tree trunks,
Crush crisp crumbs, friend Frank, fret, fry!
94. Scramble, scrape, scrawl, screw, scripture, scroll,
scrub. Sprain, spray, spread, spring, spree, sprite, sprout,
spruce.
Strap, straw, streak, stream, stress, stretch, strict,
string, strip, stroke, strop, strut, stride. A strong, strag-
gling stranger strolled in the straw-strown streets and
struck straight into the Strand.
Now your r is in its right place, the front. But your
troubles are not yet at an end. For the English r is not
trilled, not rolled. It is “fricative,” that is, produced by
the friction or rustling of the breath, a weak, almost
vocalic squeeze (called in German Reihungsget ausch), and


after t and d it is distinctly buzzed, so that train almost
sounds like chain. Pronounce the following pairs first
perfectly alike, then with the slightest difference, only so
much that there can be no doubt which word you meant
to say. Say train, but think of chain.
95. Chain —train, chance —trance, chap —trap, cheat —
treat, chip—trip, chase —trace, chick —trick, chill —trill,
chuck —truck, chew —true, cheese —trees, chess —tress,
choose —trews.
More difficult still for the throaty ones is the initial
tongue tip r. A practical ass’s bridge (no offence!) is
h-d, which should gradually pass on to the fricative
sound of the r.
96. h-dat [rat), h-ding {ring), h-dose {rose), h-doof
{roof), h-doyal {royal), h-dipe {ripe), h-dun {run), h-dound
{round), h-diff-h-daff {riff-raff).
97. Room, read, write, ruler, wrong, rust, raven,
rock, rough-rider, right, ready, rest, real, Russia. Rise
refreshed. Rose. Roll, restless, rippling river round
romantic rocks, round ruins. Royal Richard, reigning
regent, rarely rode round Rotten Row. Ronald Wright
read Russian random rhymes.
98. Reckless Ralph, riotous ringleader, rushed, running
rapidly, and reached Ryde. Ronald readily remembered
reading and re-reading rhymed railroad romances,
ridiculous rubbish. Ruth really wrote rather readable


reviews regarding recent religious recitals and races.
Rightly or wrongly, refuse rare red roses; rather receive
ripe raisins. Rural Robert recommenced rearing radishes,
roots, rice, rye and rhubarb. Roger’s roaring rival
Reynold, rude, rich ruffian, rascal, rogue, returned,
rambling, roving, roaming, robbing rubber rules, rotten
ropes and rusty razors, wrestling wringing wretched
Rachel’s ruddy wrist.
r—r
99. Horror and terror. Bear our errors. Harry ran
before Eric. Wear our earrings. Drearier or airier
rumours. Mary rear a rabbit. Carry read a very rare
romance. Roar, rare rearer, roar! There arose a very
rare error in it. Here are our orreries.
100. Secretary, prerogative, laboratory, deteriorate,
irretrievable, structural, temporarily, preliminarily,
extraordinarily.
101. Hear a roarer, rarer, rearer,
Hear a roarer or our roars,
There are airier or nearer,
Dearer orreries or oars.
I—r1 —r
102. Already, jewellery, bell-rope, cavalry, grill-room,
bulrushes, cattle-ranch, wheelwright, railroad, tool-rack,
ball-room, rifle-range, mill-round. An able rural ruler.
Royal regent. Gentle rain. Gable roof. Funeral rites.
You’ll run a real risk, Coleridge. All right, I will recall
revelries, little rogue!


m—r
103. Home-rule, ram-rod, primrose, shamrock, bot-
tomry, tramrails, comrade, steam-roller. Some rest, get
them ready, same room, fame rises, tame raven. Come
rack, come rope!
n—r
104. Enraged, inroad, unrest, unripe, unroll, sunrise,
kitchen-range, yeomanry. I can ride, thin ropes, in
writing, sudden rush. Henry Monroe, John Ruskin,
German Rhine, Rotten Row.
s—r
105. Miss Ruth, guess Rose, moss-wreath, Prince-
Regent, Viceroy, worse rhyme, glass roof, class room,
brass rod, horse-race. That’s right, but it’s wrong to
chase rabbits, Robert.
z—r
106. Prize-running was rare, as Rose was rich. Mrs.
Ross in Disraeli’s Rolls Royce. John’s rival, whose
romance James read, is wrong. Rise, royal Son of Israel,
in Ezra’s wrath.
sh —r
107. Shriek, shrub, shrine, shrill. Crush roses. Eat
shrimps and mush-rooms, bushranger! The English
reader gives French roots. Blush Ronald, shrink from
foolish rubbish, Wright. Shrive, shrivelled, shrewd,

delirious, various, general, funeral, honourable, caterer,

b —r, c —r, d—r, etc.
112. Brush brass bracelets, brave, bright Browning,
Crystal cross, cracked, crockery, crows;
Drowsy drudge drops dreaming, drowning,
Free, frank friends from France fret frowning,
Grinning groom, grey griffon grows.
Precious presents, prepaid price, pray,
Strong, strict stranger, strike, stroke, stroll, stray.
Tree-trunks, train-track, treasure trove.
Thrive, three throats through thrift thrice throttling,
Round rough ragged rocks run, rove.


113. Round gray prisons green grass grows,
Freddy threw three grains of gravel,
Screaming, shrieking, screeching crows
Frightened from green graveyards travel.
This exercise ought to sound like the beat of a drum;
accompany it by a devil's tattoo on the table with your
pencil.
114. Thrum, thrum, thrum, thrum,
Bring a bright, brass brooch,
Hear a roarer or approach.

115. Wherever a river ran over a rock
Recover, oh rower, our oar or our block.
Moreover we never are nearer our aim,
Then where there are readers who roar at our
name
For I rightly remember a drearier air.

wondering true.
Go to nunnery for a century; flavorous beer in brewery
brew.
Sugary, celery, savoury chicory robs from scullery
Modereen Rue,
Tawdry frippery, mockery, quackery Thackeray’s bride
from lottery drew.
CHAPTER VI
TH
The pronunciation of th offers no difficulty. Place your
tongue tip between the teeth and say t {d). Everybody can
do it. What then is the explanation of so many foreigners'


neglect of this most characteristic of English sounds?
Laziness. “This it is, and nothing more.” They do not
realize how objectionable a fault it is to substitute d, s, z,
etc., a fault which betrays their foreign origin at the first
few sentences they utter. If once you are convinced, gentle
reader, that it is the gravest sin you can commit in English
pronunciation, you will never again be guilty of such a
phonetical crime. It requires indeed a supple tongue, and
yours is a bit stiff perchance. Well then, make it supple
by the following exercises. When you feel yourself quite
strong, you may form this sound by putting the tongue
tip against the back of the upper teeth, but beginners
must not think of this. 1 Now take your hand-glass, and
start, with a will!

He read thus. Send those books. Could they? Would that?
He stood there more awed than ever.
th —d
158. Bathed, breathed, sheathed, wreathed, bequeathed,
writhed, loathed, clothed, betrothed, soothed, smoothed,
mouthed.
Repetition
159. A thrilling, enthralling myth without rhythm.
In Elisabeth’s youth, in the fifth month after Ruth’s
birth and before the thin, sympathetic unhealthy Edith’s
death, Martha, Cynthia, Bertha, Ethel and Kathleen
Firth were gathered together near a heather-covered
heath. They thought they saw their thrifty mother,


enthusiastically thrashing the writhing Arthur Lowfher,
Tabitha Smith and Timothy Thorpe, in their swathing-
clothes, with three thick thongs and thistles from the
hearth, through the dearth of the withering wreaths on
earth. Their thirsty, worthless, athletic, lethargic father,
throwing down scythes, snaths, and everything thread and
thrum to smithereens on the threshing-floor, as lithe as a
panther, as thin as a lath, went forthwith stealthily and
breathlessly thither and, without mirth, thumped them
thuddingly. Then he thrust three teeth down their diph-
theritic throats. At length, in his wrath, with an oath
and a threat, after the theft of thirteen thimbles, a thin
thread, and three thousand and thirty thermometers from
a wealthy, thriving cathedral and theatre builder, the
heathenish thug methodically smothered the still breathing
youths. Rather a bother, I think.
But then, both the slothful youths were bathing in their
father’s bathing suits, either at the baths of Perth, Ports-
mouth or Southampton (at 333, Threadneedle street —a
thronged thoroughfare), or in the Firth of Forth. Neither
of the youths, though writhing, thought anything of this.
Neither did their father. Quoth he blithely:
“By the throbbing of my thumbs —something filthy this
way comes!” as Macbeth hath it, or rather hath it not.
This ruthless thwacking and thumping was done on both
sides of a footpath with thickets full of thrushes, and
feathery hyacinths underneath the undergrowth on both
sides.
Both the rather unworthy mother, and the loathsome,
uncouth father were heathens, and therefore without faith
or truth. Shouldn’t they both of them spend three thought-
*
ful months in the throes of thraldom?


160. Strengthen thou then those brethren, brother Seth,
with the pithy thoughts of truth, strength, faith, health,
wealth, mirth and filth, as though the withered thorns and
the scythe of death threatened them!
And so forth. . . .
161. There were three brothers of Leith,
One upon the earth, two underneath,
For did not they smother
With bath-cloths each other,
For the theft of a scythe and a sheath!
162. There were thirteen fathers of Perth,
And this is, Ruth, what they were worth:
Thirty thousand, together;
Though in thundery weather
They thrust all their wealth in the earth.
163. A ruthless and heathenish youth.
Thoughtless, thin, swarthy, rather uncouth,
Though he thrice took the path
Through a thicket to Bath,
Still to no other man breathed the truth.
164. Arthur thought of the pithiest myth,
This is of this myth, Smith, the pith:
That a thief was the brother,
An author the mother
Of Edith and Dorothy Smith.
165. The faithless thieves lithely went thither
Where thistles and hyacinths wither,


Though through thick and through thin,
With their kith and their kin,
Their father came thwacking them hither.
th and r
166. Leathery brushes, feathery thrushes,
Withering grass and gathering clouds,
Tethering strings and smothering crowds.
The brother is gathering withering hay,
The mother is crying, the father is trying
To further a bother at Fofheringay.
Of Southern cross are in wondering awe
Friend Leatheringcourt or a mother-in-law.
Anstruther is crying, another is frying,
And hither and thither Miss Smifhers is prying,
A sister or rather a brother is trying
To smother a father who’s running around,
And smoother are neither, but farther are either
The worthier earl or his hound.
Strike, smith, in thy smithy, strong, swarthy
smith, prithee,
With strength, brawny smith, strike with strong
strokes thy stithy,
Where uproar or clamour is drowned.
You lather each other; now tether, oh mother,
The gray to the heathery ground.
167. Strew thrones, throw wreaths, strive, thriving
youths,
Three smooth roads run through thistles.
In reading trust those thrilling truths,
As the thrush from shrill throat whistles.


Blush, Thring! Those thoughts of theories throng;
Brave Tristram, bear our error.
Such loathsome themes are rather wrong,
Shrink, friend, from death’s great terror.
Thus brush Ruth’s teeth and wash Seth’s mouth,
Fresh breath smells fresh like breezes.
Although three streams rush through the South,
Where it neither thaws nor freezes.
168. Three strangers ran through Portsmouth Street,
With bridles, throat-straps, traces.
Try Griffith’s fruitcreams, regular treat,
The Firth of Forth breeze braces.
Throw screws through bathrooms, read Macbeth,
Bring brass things, rub this stirrup,
String six thick threads round rose trees, Seth,
In spring green crickets chirrup.
Cross bridges shrewdly, throttling throats,
Shrive, heathenish, ruthless brothers,
Strike, father, thirty thousand groats,
For a rare, red rose rob others.
169. Thrifty brethren from Shropshire, friends, thrive,
Thrice with threats Auth to frighten they strive;
Through Ruth’s shrieks they grow red,
Shrinking, three shrouds they shred,
Strike these brethren, strong, shrewd Auth; then
shrive.


CHAPTER VII
THE A OF “MAN”
Mark the difference between the a of tan and the e of
ten , The latter is closer and approaches the i of tin. It
is vulgar to say selary instead of salary. Note Jack Ketch
(hangman), -ed, -es and -et have a distinct f-sound. Given —
Heaven, merit — spirit, roses —posies are allowable rhymes.
170. Ten tan

171. Tempest. Pall Mall. Pleasure, leisure. The bell-
wether went ahead. Sell eleven bedsteads. Friend Fred
then sent several lead pencils.
Learn the following short story by heart; it contains
nearly all words in which ea has this sound.
172. The deaf, sweating, zealous, treacherous zealot
meant dealt, dreamt, leant, leapt and threatened the
cleanly seamstress with a heavy weapon, treading her


breast, when she was endeavouring to cleanse a thread
with leaven, spreading death.
173. Seven pleasant gentlemen, clever and content,
Went together steadily to a settlement of Kent.
Then they sent ten well-dressed men with heavy
chests ahead,
Every penniless friend they met ate catsup, as they
said.
Lend a penny, I’ve not any, yes, you’ve many, I bet it,
Yet I guess Bess never betted, then I’ll let you get it.
Freddy spread a net in Delhi, present at a wedding,
Eleanor read letters sent from Edinburgh to Reading.
a
174. Mad-cap, ash-pan, ankle-jack, sand-bag. Thrash and
clap-trap. That man hangs a cap and a battered hat on a
ramshackle hat-rack. The fat of the land. Sam lack-land.
Catch-as-catch-can. A bad handicap. A black and tan stag.
A flash in the pan. As a matter of fact the cab rattled. A
sprat to catch a mackerel.
175. To the band-stand ran the man.
Angrily he sprang and ran,
With his hat in his hand
He ran to the strand.
Swam back from the sand,
When the smack was manned
By Captain Grand.
What’s the matter, said the latter,
Man, you’re as mad as a hatter.
Pack the plaid and hat and bags,
Wrap them flat in tattered rags.


Fanny stammered Esperanto,
Strapped and smashed a black portmanteau.

black-leg, addle-headed.
Gas jet, bad temper, clammy sweat, black death.
Land’s end. Hampstead. Jack-Ketch.
178. Lend a hand and pet the cat,
Send the sand and let the flat.
A kettle of metal they rattle and clatter,
And settle with mettle the battle and matter.
179. He said he was sad,
That the bed was so bad,
When we met on a mat in the passage.
And the lather you get on the leather is fat,
I was glad that he fled with the message.
180. That neck of Jack’s pet cat is fat.
Jet black specks on her back has that cat.
Jack’s left hand gets wet,
When he’s patting his pet,
Clever Jack should know better than that-.
181. Tell where Albert gets his hats,
Fetch the net, Pet, catch the rats.


Tremble, gamble, ramble, temple.
Anger, wax and vex, then trample.
Frank sprang madly in the camp.
Get your bat and sell the stamp.
Men, this man has shackles, fetters,
Then the latter read the letters.

Spaniels leapt on speckled leopards.

Geoffrey jaggered, kennels, channels,
Annal and antennal flannels.
Bend your neck, fresh messenger,
Stand you back, rash passenger.
Candour, splendour, Janet’s jennet,
Panic, hygienic, sennet.
A thrashing on the scalp is a quite refreshing help.
Pat is threshing damp hemp and lashing the whelp.
The edge of Madge’s glass is bevelled,
And wealthy bankers in pleasure revelled,
When clever clans were travelling,
Tangled threads unravelling.
Don’t swagger, bad beggar,
I’ll get my dagger, and back you stagger.
Then stretch your legs and catch ten bags,
Wet gnats there are in plenty.
But ants in tents are scanty
And my friend has twenty eggs.
The heavy, lacquered, chequered valves then cracked
and bent themselves,
When savages sat sweating, chatting, fretting on black
shelves.


CHAPTER VIII
THE A OF “MARY”
This vowel has the sound of I in French mere , not of
e in German mehr.
French English
182. air air
Caire care
terre tear
faire fair
mere mayor
d’air dare
verre where
pere pair
183. Heir, spare, rare, mayors,

With their canary.

Take care, forbearing.
184. Chary Mary, airy fairy, their canary dared to tear.
There librarians, fair Bavarians, Unitarians,
Bear fair Marian to their lair, bear in air.
Foreign Accent
E


Share their pears on stairs in Erin,
Where square bears their snares were tearing,
Ere bare, fair-haired mayors were there.
CHAPTER IX
THE A OF “FATE”
This is a compound of the e of fen and the i of it, repre-
sented in phonetic script by ei. A common fault is to
sound the initial part as the a of far, saying, e.g., lidy
instead of lady.
Say fen — it, separately, dropping the n.
Then insert between the two parts the glide y (of yes):
fe-y-it.
Next damp the tone of the last element to a ‘Vanish,”
saying: fe-y-[i) t.
This is the right pronunciation of fate.

away. Lady Day; brazen-faced, safety-razor, scape-grace;

Gabriel, David, Jacob, Nathan, Sabaoth, Satan. Asia,
Latium, Thrace, Damon, Thales, Trajan, Plato.


iSy- Baby is afraid of apes. May James stay away?
Obey, craven slave. The daily papers state the decay of
trade shakes great nations. They gave Lady Amy fragrant
daisies, dahlias and acacias. May Braithwaite came late
at Avondale. A lady’s maid is named an abigail. Help
angels, make assay! is an exclamation in a famous play
by Shakespeare.
188. Be veracious, don’t parade,
Bravely call a spade a spade,
Face your failures, say your say,
Make your tale yea, yea —nay, nay.
189. Kate, make haste, plain cakes for sale,
Taste some grapes, the cake is stale,
Fagin wails on rainy days.
Bathing, racing, favourite plays
Change great stranger’s famous name.
Patron saint gave shame or fame.
Chase the scapegrace, graceful ladies,
Nathan came away from Cadiz.
Taste the dainty pastry, Ralph,
Play the bass, and paint the safe,
Take a train with patent brakes,
Shake the cradle, wake the sheiks.
Abel slain by Cain for wages!
Halfpence, gaols, veils, ladles, gauges.
190. May, a lady's maid, straight from Marseilles,
Takes a place in the mail train to Wales.
May’s gazes are scathing,
May hates swathing, bathing,
And sailing, and playing plain scales.


191. Mabel, maiden, pale-faced, radiant, grave,
Gave a veil, lathe and lace to her slave.
Nay, in vain, I’m afraid,
Yea, the brazen-faced maid
Made eight skeins of the veil Mabel gave.
192. A stranger in danger is staying
At Yale for the sake of his playing.
Again and again
His breaking a chain
Makes him take to champagne and crocheting.
CHAPTER X
THE I OF “FIGHT”
This is a compound of the a of far and the i of it, repre-
sented in phonetic symbols by ai. A common fault is to
sound the first element as the 0 of or, e.g. Oi loike (I like)
—a dreadful vulgarism which should be eradicated.
Say far —it separately, dropping the r.
Then join the two parts by means of the glide y of
yes : fa-y-it. Next diminish the sound of the last element;
deaden it as it were to a mere "vanish,” saying: fa-y{i)t.
This is the sound of fight.
193. Boy by
toy tie
voice vice
coin kine
boil bile
foil file
toil tile
point pint
troy try
quoit kite
alloy ally
devoid divide


194* White mice, spiders, vipers. Indictment, lichen, ay,

Levi, Messiah, Paradise, Zion, Zacharia, Dionysus,
Hyperion, Midas, Niobe, Quirites. Alibi, abaci, genii,
viva voce, scilicet, bona fide.
196. Strike the iron. Bide thy time. Out of sight, out of
mind. The bright lime-light tries my eyes. My wife rides
a bicycle, Giles’s a tricycle. Is it wise, Maria, to buy rye
while the price is rising? The writing liar bribed the
mighty knight of the shire. Five tired Irish miners dined
on fried snipe. I finally decided to beguile the time by
memorizing ninety lines of Wilde’s finest rhymes.
197. I was in the prime of life
Childish for my time of life,
Idling, trifling, shy, untidy,
And I called a lady “lidy.”
198. Mind my swine and bind my kine,
Tie them tight with binding-twine,
Sigh when chiding,
Cry when hiding,
Drive to Clive’s by five to five,
Wildly fly, arrive alive.


199* High and mighty, high and dry,
Isaac pipes a lullaby,
Self-reliant, self-admiring
Isaac blithely fifes, untiring,
Tries and spites the tuneful Nine,
He invites me, I decline.
200. Tiny Simon likes flying a kite
Of a night in the Island of Wight,
Rise higher, ay, higher
Than wire and spire!
Simon cries, when it flies, with delight.
201. Blind Silas is pining and sighing,
His wife’s eyes are right. She is crying
And trying to hide
That the light is denied
To the blind one whose life is quite trying.
202. Lie silent awhile by my side.
The sky is so high and so wide;
The twilight is nigh,
I espy in thine eye'
Thy uprightness, thy might and thy pride.

high, main line, trial paper; apron file, maiden assize.
Vibrate, isolate, annihilate, hibernate, plagiarize, laicize,
gyrate, hydrate.
205. Stay awhile. Fine paste of pie was baked. Grace
Price has a nice face. I paid the fine within five days. Mind
Gray’s wise sayings. Why be ashamed of slight mistakes?
Try again. In ’B9 hay prices were higher than in later times.
A stitch in time saves nine.
206. I sailed on a delightful lake,
The waves were wild, they made me shake,
I vainly sought an islet.


But James, my mate, quite wide-awake.
Divined, by grace, what line to take.
And saved my life for kindness’ sake,
Behaving like a pilot.
I praised him in a lively strain,
Regaling him with dry champagne,
But James, my mate, surprised me.
For, yea, he smiled, and smiled again.
Then basely wiped me with a cane,
And striking me with might and main,
He gravely criticised me.
207. My baker was riding to Yale,
His jade was deprived of its tail,
And his trying to slay
With his pipe, made of clay,
Biting flies —was of little avail.

209. Pray, dot your i’s, boys. I’ll buy oilcakes, cried
Mabel noisily. I rejoice at Jane’s sublime aim of life. My
wife gave a toy to that nice, lame boy. Maria came by train
to Croydon at the appointed time. Take the main line to


avoid delay and to save time, and join us at Ryde Station
in the Isle of Wight. I raised my voice and made a frightful
noise. The lady wiped her moist eyes.
210. Lie and loiter, lighter, later,
Idle, base, recoiling traitor!
Joy is vain, and twice the same
Tries the brains and spoils the game.
211. Stay, cried Roy,
Take my boy!
Sprightly pointing at the raiders,
Roy exclaimed; Abide invaders!
Join them, neither shake nor shj^,
Rise, bright boy, and say good-bye.
212. One day I dined
In joyful mind
At Lloyd’s. The pie was basted,
And though my knife was stained and soiled,
The cider stale, the whiting spoiled,
The choicest wines I tasted;
And as my steak was nicely broiled,
The dainty whitebaits spiced and oiled,
My fiver was not wasted.
213. Once a tailor who toiled in the night
Was assailed by a boisterous fright.
He was greatly annoyed,
For his life he enjoyed
If not fatally foiled in a fight.


oi, i and a in poetical or archaic words
214. Bestride thy gray
In moist array,
Engage in broil and strife and fray.
Upbraiding sire,
Why chide in ire
Thy hoyden dame in toy attire?
Spy, joyous swain,
Coy maidens twain,
Whilst laving in the briny main.
CHAPTER XII
THE A OF “FATHER”
This vowel is like the Italian a of padre and the German of
Vater, not far distant from the French d in pdte.
215. Sample. Example. Giraffe. France. Garage.
Pyjamas. Farm-yard. Card-sharper. Koran. Sonata. Alex-
ander. Farquhar. Clerk. Serjeant. Berkeley. Berkshire.
Derby. Hertford. Glasgow. Guiana. Chicago. Java. Marble
Arch. Arts and crafts. Ask a draft. A hearty laugh. A glass
jar. Star and Garter. France’s last chance. Alas, Charley’s
aunt masks her hard heart. I can’t start in the dark. I
shan’t. I’d rather pass the mark. Barker’s remark alarmed
Master Carton. Amen.
216. Hark! hard masters, starving clerks,
Dancing, laughing, carve half larks.


Father, darling, ask Mark's pardon.
Paths in Martha’s Derby garden.
Calves in carts; are sparkling stars
Rather farther, mar the tars.
Quaff a glass with staunch commanders,
Dance, apache, in bars of Flanders,
Cast the last nasty cards,
March past larger masts and yards,
Asking vases, scarfs, cigars,
Branches, plants and brass guitars.
Tardy cars and marvellous casks,
Part and parcel, lasting tasks.
CHAPTER XIII
THE A OF “SAW”
This sound is like the 0 of sore without its final murmur.
It is heard in:
217. Law, all, water, morning, glory, more, door, broad,
ought, Magdalen (in, “Magdalen College,” Oxford and
Cambridge), sport, horse, towards, pour, saunter, Esau,
Salisbury, Bengal, Arkansas.
Pronounce the following pairs:
218. awe —oar

caught—court
caws —cores
maw —more

gnaw—nor
pshaw—shore


219. The portly porter
Had but one daughter
For her he sawed
A sort of board.
His son lived shorter.
He died in water.
Lord Harcourt bought
Some good old port,
He bought a storeful,
Was not it awful?
And while he talked
It was uncorked.
And though his walk
Was rather short,
A silver fork
Was promptly bought.
220. I saw the caw
Before the door
One morning;
It soared
And cawed —
You’re yawning!
And with his sword
The portly lord,
Not overawed,
The cord had sawed,
While lions roared.
The fawn
Was born,
Miss Maud
Was bored,
Of course:
The sauce
Was poured
Among the corn,
Before the lawn.
Put on the floor
The hat of straw
Which you have worn
From early dawn.
After a pause
He left his oars
And went ashore
In fear and awe,
And, lost in thought,
He took some port.
Before
The caw
Had cawed
Above the ford,
And what is more,
Against the law.
Sir Walter Raleigh
Was tried so sorely,
And turning towards us
The former lauds us.
A shortened not unlike the o of not, is represented


by a after w,wh and qu: wasp, what, quarrel. The following
pairs are allowable rhymes:
221. Warren —foreign, swans —bronze, warn-—thorn,
squash —bosh, wallow —hollow, quarry—sorry, swamp—
pomp, war —nor, want —font.
CHAPTER XIV
THE E OF “ME”
This is a diphthong, the elements of which (i-i) should be
distinctly heard. It is akin to German ie of Lied, only
longer.
222. He feels the breeze, he sees these bees,
And kneels with ease beneath three trees.
Leave me! The sea is three feet deep,
The seething deep sea teems with eels,
Beneath these seas free dreams she feels,
We meet thee screaming, see thee weep.
223.
She leaves the needle, leaps and flees to Stephen,
Chagrin she feels, and screams: sixteen seems even!
Police of Rheims need freedom’s glee. Steal clean valises,
Ye sneaking thieves! eat meal, cream, beans, these eels
and sweet peas.
Each peach she sees, a piece of green cheese.
She really seems to read three magazines when she
pleases.
Grief’s brief relief! seize these green leaves of trees,
squeeze.


Learn this short story by heart. It contains nearly all
words in which i has this sound.
224. It was a unique caprice of the czarina, when
fatigued with intrigue, scarlatina, mosquitoes and chagrin,
to pique the police, in an automobile, an antique machine,
with vaseline in a valise in the ravine, playing a pibroch
on the concertina, eating a tangerine (mandarin) and a
sardine, as you read in the Marine’s magazine.
CHAPTER XV
THE I OF “IN”
This sound is not far from the e of me , but it is a monoph-
thong, very short. Pronounce it as crisply as possible.
It is very like the German i of Sinn.
225. This is Prism’s pin. Miss Prism is sitting, in the
window sill, busily knitting. Six thick thistle-sticks. Kit is
quickly winning innings in this list. Isn’t this mist thick?
It is, skin-flint, lick-spittle. Will-o’-the-wisp. Bring the
wings of a finch, the skin of a pig, the gills of the ink-fish
in a silver dish, women, everything within an inch of the
kitchen. Sit still, Swiss tinsmith, whispering, whistling
indistinctly. Invincible Prince, fit little Cinderella’s slipper
on. Fill this tin with Britain’s crispest biscuits.
226. Pretty, women, threepence, fivepence, groats,
England, English, Theobald, Teignmouth.


227. Glimpses of Greenwich,
A trim English village,
Jim, listen a minute,
This building is in it.
It’s prettily written
In Islington, Britain.
228. Is simplicity sin? And frigidity, timidity, indignity,
incivility, invincibility, inimitability, indivisibility, irre-
sistibility?
229. To the midship rigging clinging
Pink winged finches sing,
With swift skipping quickly bringing,
—Winter’s finished —spring.
Stingy Billy clicks his fingers,
Picking pips with skill,
In his fingers shilling lingers,
Still he drinks his fill.
Willy whips the kicking filly,
Thinks of missing links.
Pinching little wrists is silly,
Fill with pitch rifts, chinks.
Filthy insect sits in thicket,
Wring its stings, Dick, quick, quick, kick it.
230. This, Miss Smith, is the wittiest thing
Which Miss Griffith will wittily sing.
And we listening sit
In the midst, when the pit
With Miss Griffith’s shrill singing will ring.


231. Mrs. Dickens’s mittens will shrink.
Still this frill will still fit, Sis, I think.
Pickled milk is then spilt
In her silk trimmed with gilt,
In the kitchen the sinner will sink.
232. Mr. Kipling is clipping a ticket,
Mr. Pickwick is mimicking cricket.
If he quickly begins.
In a minute he wins
With his grinning and kicking the wicket.
233. Little fiddler is wicked and bitter,
When finches hiss, whistle and twitter.
At the twiddling rich things
In his glittering rings
With dimpled chins twin sisters titter.
CHAPTER XVI
THE ENDING -Y
This sound is intermediate between the e of ten, and the
i of tin, Willy. First say Weelih, then shorten the first
sound, but let the difference between i and y be distinctly
heard, the latter being the shorter. Note that -ay of
Sunday , etc., has this sound.
234. Silly Willy
Felt so chilly
Willy-nilly.
Silly Billy
Sings so shrilly.
Busy Lizzy,


Ground is hilly,
Whinny, filly!
Filly’s frisky,
Isn’t it risky?
Sip this whisky,
Tricky Gypsy,
Little tipsy,
Fickle kiddy.
Are you giddy?
Pick a lily.
Piccadilly,
In this city,
What a pity!
Pretty Kitty,
You’re so witty.
Sing your witty, gritty ditty.
Mrs. Grundy comes on Sunday,
Not on Monday.
CHAPTER XVII
THE O OF “NOT”
The tongue is drawn back and lies low. The sound is
unknown in French and in German. It is more like the
a of G. Falke than like the o of Volk. The same sound,
produced by the beat of a clock, is represented in English
by lock, in German by tack.
235. Bronze, not, frog, proxy, monster, pocket, stock-
jobber, jog-trot, Gloucester.
236. Beyond the rocks. Chock-a-block. Scot and lot.
The cock stops on top of the cottage. Poll got dolls from
Tom. Tock-tock, says the clock. Ronald got a lot of
blots on his smock frock.
237. Sausage, cauliflower, ya(ch)t, laurel.
Foreign Accent
F


238. Drop the block and lock the box,
Rob a stock and stop the clocks.
Rotten are the tops of pods.
Snobs are shocked, but what’s the odds?
Polly’s frock got on the top,
Oddly nods the snobbish fop.
Not a fox the Scotchman shot,
Chop a lobster in the pot.
Johnny Fox got fond of hock.
Knock the doctor off the rock.
Stop the dogs and hogs, sot, follow,
Hop in copse beyond the hollow.
Especially before m, ng and n the o-sound is very much
like the a-sound of G. matt.
239. Strong Tom came along from Hongkong,
He romped with some pomp to a song,
A don with a prong,
Struck a gong in a throng,
But the song was too long, and all wrong.
CHAPTER XVIII
THE O OF “GO”
This diphthong is a compound of the pure o-vowel and
the 00 of good. In vulgar pronunciation the first element
is often heard as the ah of father.


240. Don’t throw those stones. The coaxing Pole sold
soap. Poke the smouldering glowing coals: so cosy is
Jones’s home. Toes over the sole. So, so! Polo in Soho,
Ho(l)bom and Gro(s)venor postponed. Tow the boat to
Dover. Ho(l)mes. Forecastle (focsl). Stow old oak poles
in the hold. Sowed oats won’t grow, if you don’t hoe and
mow. Crusoe roasted bloaters on a smoking stove. The
old fo(l)k at home, Lo! Behold Job’s holy abode.
241. The soldier roams, though low are moats,
And goes for does and roes and goats.
He knows no bold, no boasting notes,
Only spoke low and slowly,
By roving ghosts is told of home,
Of cosy home, though Poe must roam
And rove; oh! Rose’s brooch and comb,
And moulds of roly-poly!
How cold it grows, it blows and snows,
He groans and rolls on a stone,
Unfolds his clothes, and moaning throws
On his throat and his nose, and his frozen toes,
Some stolen Eau de Cologne.
242. Over bolsters boatswains choke,
Row those boats in rolling motion,
Roasting clover, dough and yo(l)k,
Close to the coast of the foaming ocean.
243. Joe hopes to go over to Rome.
So Joe Jones, old slow-coach, goes home.
Noble Rose sews Joe’s clothes,
Sews those stoles, sews mauve bows,
So Joe goes—lo! beholds Rome’s old dome.


CHAPTER XIX
THE U OF “BUT”
This is the shortened ah of father .
244. My youngest son
Doesn’t love one bun.
But does love mustard.
Nuts, plums and custard,
Ducks, plovers, doves,
And Russian gloves.
Rum customers come,
Some humbugs hum.
One’s tongue isn’t dumb.
Stuck-up Miss Bumble,
Does Douglas grumble,
When, struck, you stumble?
It’s fun to tumble.
One must not touch
The Dutch too much,
They’re struggling, troubling,
Their money doubling.
Blood and thunder,
Thud and blunder.
The southern sun
Had just begun.
In Southwark, Southwell,
Where puppies cuddle.
A sudden thud,
A flood of blood.


Thus gushing comes
From Rudyafd’s thumbs.
Some one, a plumber,
A rough newcomer,
A Prussian drummer.
Cuts musty crumbs,
For twopence hums,
Scrubs dull tubs, funnels,
Pumps, rowlocks, gunwales.
Punning Punch and funny Puck,
Nutty brothers, run amuck.
Cut, buttercups, dunce, v
Rush, numbskull, but once,
Thus pluck honey-suckle,
Shun tuft-hunters, chuckle,
Brush rubbing a scuttle,
Just, trusty and subtle,
As snug as a bug in a rug.
Just tug some luggage,
Up, up, to Dulwich.
Shut up in dungeon,
In bustling London.
Rough and tough
And up-to-snuff.
A dusty ’bus, bucket,
Buck up, sluggard, chuck it!
Munching buns, unjust but comely,
Blushing runs Augusta Cholmondeley.


CHAPTER XX
THE U OF “PUT” AND THAT OF “TUNE”
Only the second is a diphthong, twice as long as the other.
For both keep your lips flat, never round them.
(a) Short
245. Bwsh, bwshel, bulwark, bullion, bwllet, bulletin,
bwlrush, pwlpit, bwffet, cushion, pwlley, pwllet, swgar. Wood,
neighbourhood, look, brook, soot, broom, mushroom, bosom.
246. Worcester, Woolwich, Wolseley, Boleyn, Boling-
broke, Bwlwer, Bwddha, Fwlton, Filler, Fwlham, Pwllman.
247. Good bwtcher, a wolf took the bwll,
Cook, woman, a pwdding, and pwll.
By hook or by crook
In a nook with a book,
Pwt worsted in cushions and wool.
[h) Long
248. Do, whose, tomb, cartoon, shoe, you, route, use,
scruple, rebuke, suit, juice, attitude, feud, deuce, dew,
view, manoeuvre, in lieu of. Food, tool, goose, shoot.
249. Munich, Hughes, Eugene, Zeus, Le Queux;
Brougham, Colquhoun, Cowper, Buchanan, Ilfracombe.
250. Moved by gloom the brute grew frugal,
Stupid pupils blew the bugle,


Wounded, bruised and brooding youth,
Do you truly prove the truth?
Tutors, soothed by music’s beauty,
Fool mute dukes, and do your duty.
Schooner, cruiser, new canoe,
Soon it’s two to two. Adieu.
(c) Short and long alternately
251. Should you prove, my good youth, if you cowld,
The use of a stool in a hood?
Of a rook on a roof,
Or a mule’s foot with hoof ?
Good duke, once in a blue moon you wowld.
252. The fool stood aloof in his boots,
Shook the soup, pwt some swgar on roots,
Took the book to the school,
Polled a cube and a rule
Through the room Ml of tunes of two flutes.
CHAPTER XXI
THE OU OF “OUT”
This is a compound of the a of father (shortened) and the
u of put.
253. A sow with its snout out of the cowhouse, gave a
loud sound. I can’t allow a cow outside the cowhouse,
shouted Brown, ploughing the ground in the cloudy


mountains. Scouts and touts in blouses and trousers in our
down-town house, south of Cowes.
254. A mouse in the outhouse! shouted Mrs. Lowther
with pouting mouth. How the bounding hounds howl and
growl at the owls in the round tower! The renowned clown
in his blouse and gown came down to our town for a thousand
crowns bowing with profound bows before the astounded
crowd of giaours. I found out that grouse and other fowl
are drowned, but how about trout? What’s the row about,
now, proud Macleod?
255. Loud, out of Brown’s house came a sound.
Where flowers sprout out of the ground:
The man about town,
Stout, powdered proud Brown,
Shouted out that our cow had been drowned.
CHAPTER XXII
W
The lips and the tongue have the same position as in u of
tune ; the lips are rounded. This sound is heard in French
oui, hois, etc. Neglecting the w-sound we utter the conson-
ant v instead of w, which is a well-known vulgarism. You
remember Sam Weller’s father saying: “Mrs. Veller
passed a good night,’’ and “The last vun.’’ In Standard
English wh and w sound alike, except in case of emphasis.
Wh then has the sound h-w, e.g. in the exclamation
“What!" In Scottish the distinction is preserved.


256. Wave, week, wick. Quake, queen, quib. Swain,
sweep, swine. Squat, squeeze, squire. Twine, tweed,
twist. Once, twice, anguish.
257. War-worn, wide-awake, ware-wire, watch-word,
wax-work, worm-wood, well-wisher, were-wolf, whirl-
wind, wig-wam.
258. Wells, Walker, Wakefield, Wallace, Washington,
Wilson, Webster, Walt Whitman, Wapping, Worcester,
Winnipeg, Wordsworth, Wedgewood.
259. We wondered where William went while we were
away. What war was won when Wolfram was wend-
ing his way westward? Withdraw, wonderful widow-
bewitched, whisking away like will-o’-wisps in windy
weather. Beware of wooden dwellings with white-washed
walls. What with weariness, what with the warmth the
queen swooned. We were well acquainted with the
Swedish language. Once twenty Swiss woodmen swam
in the swashing water. Where there is a will, there is a
way. The weakest went to the wall. How much wood
would the woodchuck chuck, if the woodchuck would
chuck wood?
260. What wayward, wilful, wily ward,
With worldly women wildly squandering,
Will walk in wood or waste or sward,
When wondrous wizard’s wives are wandering?
Woe worth a wicked world of swells!
Why would weird witches whisper waking,
When woodbines wither, water wells.
While widowed warriors wassail, quaking?


261. Squinting sweetheart, swift and swindling,
Swear quite quickly where you were,
When wan, wizened dwarfs were dwindling;
Quaintly questioned, will you swear?
262. Swim away with a will.
Win a quid with a quill,
While a well-wisher watches a wick;
Wear, o widow, wear weeds
At a wedding of Swedes,
But beware of the wolf, and be quick!
CHAPTER XXIII
F—V, S— Z
These consonants, even when initial, are not always dis-
tinguished clearly enough. Avoid this mistake.
263. few view

Fickle vicars, various /airies.

Vaughan’s young /awn is very merry,
Fie! count, viscount, five fine vines.
Vaughan /alls in this very fe rry.
With his /ather’s vase and lines.
Especially before y or w careless speakers are inclined to
voice the /, to pronounce it like v. Don’t —except in
nephew.
267. If we do. Doff your hat. A half year. A stij/
wind. A dea/ youth. The whar/ yard. A gruff welcome.
The mastijf yelped. His life was sad. A safe way. 1/ you
langh, youngster, I’ll cuff you.
The same mistake is often made in s before y. Here is
a mixed exercise:
268. Yes, yes, Miss White, guess well,
Grace Young, rough work, safe warning.
Nice yacht, o/ - York, gru^yell,
If you this once will tell,
Place William there, cease yawning.


CHAPTER XXIV
K, T, P
These letters are always followed by a slight puff of
breath: k-h-ing, k-h-ome, k-h-ey (king, come, key), t-h-en,
t-h-ake, t-h-urf (ten, take, turf), p-h-ain, p-h-ost, p-h-ut
(pain, post, put).
269. Tick-tock, says the kitchen time-piece. Take a cup
of coffee and a piece of pop-corn. Topsy passed the
tennis-court. Pete can tell. Tiny kittens purr. Come, put
the time-table and a pack of cards on the card-table. Gut
ten peaches and a pumpkin. Catch the cable-car. Purchase
Pope’s poems. Take two tickets for the tube to Tottenham
Court Park. A taxi, page!
270. Kitty took a cup of coffee,
A comic tale is told.
Tiny Tim is keen on toffee,
For Tommy caught a cold.
Take to Popocatepetl
Curry-comb and patty kettle;
Peelers pussyfoot, cook a pie,
Tops and petticoats, kick and tie.
271. Captain Cuttle, talk to tip-top skipper.
Cocks were cackling, kitchen timepiece ticked.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pepper,
Where’s the peck of pepper Peter picked?


CHAPTER XXV
-LF, -LK, -LP
A not uncommon mistake is the insertion of a murmured
sound between these letters. Avoid saying selluf instead
of self. Make it brisk, short, monosyllabic.
272. Self, shelf, gulf, twelfth, silk, film, bulb, scalp, alp,
alb, palp, ilk, pelf, kelp, whelk, magilp.
273. Twelve elks, twelve wolves gulp milk on shelves,
Revolve silk valves, help, help yourselves.
The twelfth whelp yelps; resolve to sulk,
Delve, salve, dissolve of pulp the bulk.
Quilp skulks, Quilp yelps, Quilp overwhelms,
Quilp’s qualms, Quilp bilks; bulbs, helms, hulks,
* realms.
CHAPTER XXVI
SILENT VOWELS
In unstressed endings a weak vowel between strong
consonants is often overwhelmed by them so as to be
silenced. Thus disyllables actually become monosyllables:
Heav’n, ev’n, as appears from the rhythm in such lines as:
“O luxury, thou cursed by Heaven’s decree.”
Goldsmith


“Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air”
Wordsworth
It requires some practice to bring the two consonants
close together.
274. Fatl (fatal), flanl (flannel), finl (final), nasi (nasal),
rascl (rascal), travl (travel), mortis (mortals), chapls
(chapels), weasls (weasels), beautifl (beautiful), dreadfl
(dreadful), difficlt (difficult).
275. Mutn (mutton), beatn (beaten), fain (fallen), prisn
(prison), seasn (season), masn (mason), reckn (reckon),
takn (taken), dragn (dragon), ofn (often, orphan), heavn
(heaven), weapn (weapon), opn (open), cousn (cousin),
dozn (dozen).
276. Gardns (gardens), certnly (certainly), pheasnts
(pheasants), importnt (important), sudnly (suddenly),
masnry (masonry), hapnd (happened), husbnds (hus-
bands ).
277. Couldnt, wouldnt, shouldnt, didnt, neednt,
hadnt.
278. Britn (Britain), Brightn (Brighton), Arnld
(Arnold), Washingtn (Washington), Newtn (Newton),
Linen (Lincoln), Littlingtn (Littlington), Wimbldn
(Wimbledon), Englnd (England).
On the other hand the two syllables in words like quiet,
idea, are not seldom reduced to one. Avoid this and let


there be an audible difference between quite and quiet,
rune and ruin.
279. Qui-et, ru-in, Bru-in, ide-a, po-em, funni-est,
twenti-eth, thirti-eth, forti-eth, go-eth, satisfi-eth, la-ity,
intu-itively.
Read very slowly and rhythmically:
280. “He had no ide-a to find you; wereyow in?”
“I was, on the thirti-eth; thinking of ru-in,
And not in the happi-est mood, but quite qui-et,
My hearth was a po-em, and pussy sat by it.”
CHAPTER XXVII

(suthl), Ruthwell (locally: rivet), Southwark ( suthek ),
Milngavie ( mllgi), Chisholm [chlsm).
CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DROPPING OF THE H
A very common blunder in cockney speech is the dropping
of the h’s. It might rather be called “shifting,” as the


dropped letter is generally picked up, and attached to
another word beginning with a vowel, to make good the
loss: “Hi ’ave.” Thus, on hearing your unphonetical guide
mention the state-room of an ancient castle, you may
after a while get aware that he is referring to your portable
wrapper! But, simple as the process may seem, a mere
exhalation, many people have some trouble in producing
the letter, especially the French. This is due to the fact
that in French it is never pronounced. The so-called
aspirate h only denotes that there must be no “liaison,”
I’homme, but le Hollandais. Now in English, in slow and
deliberate speech initial h is never silent, except in heir,
hour and honest. In the following exercises all h’ s must be
sounded.
284. Ail —hail, am —ham, arbour —harbour, air—hare,
arm —harm, arrow —harrow, art —heart, aye —hey, eel —
heal, ear —hear, edge —hedge, I —high, oaks—hoax, owl —
howl, earl —hurl. Old hall —hold-all.
285. Hale and hearty, hard-hearted, haphazard, hot-
house, hollyhock, hare and hounds, head and heels,
hum and haw, hard of hearing, High Holbom, Herne
Hill, Hampstead Heath, the Holy of the Holies.
286. Hit it hard with heavy hammers, Henry. Hi, hold!
Hush, hush! Harold has a headache, Heaven help him!
Humphry hid a horrible hornet in the hollow of his hand.
287. Hapless Helen hung her head,
Hughes had heard her husband hollo
To the hounds and hawks she bred.
Hover high and higher, swallow.
Foreign Accent
G


It must be added, however, that in rapid speech and
ordinary conversation Standard English allows the drop-
ping of the h of certain words, when they occur in an
unstressed position, e.g.; I gave ’im a book, but I gave the
hook to him, not to her.
CHAPTER XXIX
THE DROPPING OF THE G
Careless people sometimes drop their g’s, saying nothin,
doin, instead of nothing, doing; or rather they change ng
into n, for ng has not the w-sound. “What are you talkin
about? Where are you goin> Barkis is willin’ ’ There is a
famous pun on this vulgarism: What is the richest country?
Ireland, because its capital is always Dublin (doubling).
But as king, sing, ring, etc., are never pronounced as kin,
sin, rin, etc., the following exercise may teach those
careless people to drop their dropping.
288. O speaking, walking King,
With strength increasing sing,
Stop staring, wearing rings,
For nothing smoothing things.
The shilling lingers, he laughing fingers
The missing link.
O singeing Jingo, in puzzling lingo
Hissing sink,
And scoring innings, beginning winnings,
Sinning shrink


From beating tinkers and breathing thinkers.
This morning English, this evening ink.
The king of birds high singing swings
In hovering rings on growing wings.
CHAPTER XXX
DICTATIONS
The use of these dictations is obvious; both reader and
writer may learn by them. Number the sentences. When
finished, examine the writing. Which is responsible for
mistakes?
289. Fours, thighs, lad, bass, grows, seethe. 2. Fourth,
size, led, bathe, gross, seethes. 3. Force, scythe, let, bays,
growth, seas. 4. Fourths, scythes, lit, bathes, growths,
cease.
290. The wizard leaves. 2. The withered leaves. 3. His
houses closed. 4. His house is closed. 5. Disappearance*
6. This appearance. 7, I send a cap. 8. I sent a cab.

hind us. 8. We wrote home with the man behind us. 9. We

12. Choose, Jews, choking, juice. 13. Choose, juice, joking
Jews. 14. Jews choose choking juice.
CHAPTER XXXI
RECAPITULATORY EXERCISES
These exercises full of jaw-breakers and tongue-twisters
should be done as the musician does his "Etudes,” first
very slowly {adagio) , then in the time of ordinary conversa-
tion {allegro), and the third time as quick as you can
manage to rattle them off without stumbling {presto ).
292. Rests, lasts, thirsts. Probably. Unusual. Sponges.
Ghost stories. Neuralgia. Its charms. Jilt, chilled. Beasts,
masts, last things. Each changed. Searched, attached,
fixed, bleached, stretched, switched. English sailors.
Welsh slang. Strengthened and refreshed, I arranged the
jingling chains. The States-General suggested a rather
strange stratagem. John should cherish just such wishes.
Chance changed Jane’s chains. Jews choose juice. Poorer
rather than richer. She says she shall sell seashells. He
thrusts his fists against those posts. He sends his best
respects to you. A string is a thick thread, and a thread
is a thin string. This gentleman strings Slazenger’s tennis
rackets, and has them restrung at Booth’s. Throw straw
through thatched roofs, Algernon. Three pieces of cheap
Cheshire cheese. Scotch students’ songs. Elisabeth’s


vicissitudes. Wash things up thoroughly, Edith, and then
use this dish-cloth. Change for Fenchurch Street Station
and Portsmouth Junction. Ethel Wrigglesworth's wrath
struck me.
293. I'm afraid I’ve to apologize, I’m very sorry I’m late.
I’m right for Threadneedle Street and the Exchange, am
I not? Just put textbooks in desks, now. They seem to
enjoy themselves immensely. What’s your chief object in
life, I sh’d like to know. Are these attitudes and gestures
those of a gentleman? Each child shows some sure signs
of its future position. Her inimitable and matchless
rendering of the piece is beyond description. Watch the
distinguished youth’s progress, George. The States-General
used to jump to conclusions. In the revolutionary war the
English established numerous new settlements. A passage
in the Apology of the Prince of Orange shows he was
largely remunerated. Just think, Charles, of the jolly time
James and Arthur used to have together with Richard
and George Smith’s brother-in-law. What’s the use of
using such sweet words? The scorching June sun shone
on hyacinths, honeysuckle and nasturtium. There, that
dusky spot beneath thee, that is England; there she lies.
294. Jane said she should see such thoroughly changed
churches, John. With furious gesticulations he showed his
uncontrollable wrath to these three fugitives. They con-
stantly changed seats in confusion, and involuntarily
blushed from sheer bashfulness and childishness. Should
you have imagined that John should ever have given so
much thought to his wretched wife’s inferior position?
In a paroxysm of rage the mischievous German major


general snatched up a cudgel and three two-edged knives.
Such abridgements are absolutely necessary to study the
difficulties of the Swedish language and other subjects.
After registering those contradictory messages, he suddenly
shut his desk with a loud crash and rushed upstairs to
refresh himself with some gingerbeer. The present genera-
tion shows a creditable amount of seriousness and sound
judgment. Without changing his attitude the unscrupulous
elocutionist apologetically uttered the most objectionable
ejaculations, in the archduchess’s presence. Nothing but
death shall henceforth sever them.
295. A disreputable-looking village cur of a nondescript
breed reminded us of the approaching danger and produced
a considerable perturbation and agitation of mind. The
eut-throat’s thriftiness was most unsatisfactorily explained.
In the greatest confusion he suddenly changed the subject
and at length managed to give me a chance of escaping
through a door which happened to stand ajar. The four
other constables were attentively searching this well-
proportioned but insufficiently furnished appartment.
With unchangeable imperturbability the duchess threat-
ened the rather too communicative magistrates to deliver
them up to the justice. They enthusiastically abolished
slavery, which was unfortunately ascribed to such absurd
motives as exaggerated religious fear of an unknown
futurity. The adroit ventriloquists managed to cure their
contemporaries, a dignitary, and a supernumerary, of
rheumatism by means of electromechanism.
296. Let such teach others who themselves excel. The
lines, though touched but faintly, are drawn right. It’s thus


the mercury of man is fixed, strong grows the virtue with
his nature mixed. He knew of wits an undistinguished race,
who first his judgments asked and then a place. Here dukes
and butchers joined to wreathe Ruth’s crown. Strange
graces still, and stranger flights she has. Now conscience
chills her, and now passion burns, and atheism and religion
take their turns. Whoever feels such passion in its strength,
must live within the very light and air of courteous usages,
refined by art. It was our occupation to observe such objects
as the waves had tossed ashore: feather, or leaf, or weed,
or withered bough, each on each other heaped, along the
line Of the dry wreck. How shall I trace the change, how
bear to tell that he broke faith with those whom he had
laid in earth’s dark chambers with a Christian’s hope.
The faithful harp shall praise thee. Death, that hath
sucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.
297. Notwithstanding his antagonist’s energetic objection
and contrary disposition, he continued studying arithmetic,
geography, psychology and state institutions conscienti-
ously and judiciously. These precious cabbages and other
delicious vegetables with suspicious looking greenish leaves
are exceptionally nutritious, unless they may prove
*
injurious to one’s health through verdigris. The exasper-
ating stinginess of the church authorities, who indiscrimin-
ately chose to avail themselves of the questionable position
of their unscrupulous chief, was just unaccountable to a
man of such cheerful disposition as Arthur Jones’s brother.
The incorrigibleness of the Russian legislative body as to
the inaccessibility of their secret assemblies was figuratively
speaking a psychological puzzle which required all the


judge's ingenuity to account for. Richard Smith’s mother-
in-law had fortunately read and re-read something regard-
ing the brave soldiers’ deaths.
298. One should not judge of such things, disapproving
indiscriminately of the stranger’s peculiarities. The
inevitable consequences of the miserable youth's extrava-
»
gance were set forth with indisputable indefatigability.
The indistinctness of Charles's proposition strangely
contrasted with the perspicuity and persuasiveness of
Ruth’s words. Seeing how indiscriminately misery and
wealth were distributed, the moralists had no trouble
in finding the strongest arguments for a future state. Mr.
Bernard Girth discovered that the cupboard was damp
and empty, and immediately ordered the doors of the
larder to be forced by the policemen. With unmistakable
gestures of astonishment and disgust, they saw the
unfortunate youth's body hanging perpendicularly from
the thatched roof of the village smithy. Without any
magnanimity to his allies, and superstitiously voracious, he
deliberately committed the most despicable act on record,
as we learn from innumerable elucidatory ethnological
notes.
299. Strengthened and refreshed John Booth’s friend
Chuckling joins those jingling chains,
Ruth’s neuralgia’s worse through reading
Smith's three toasts in Swedish trains.
This distinguished youth’s great progress
Changed Prince George’s genial thoughts.
Strange ventriloquists, elocutionists,
Rough Welsh sailors grudged in ports.


Roaring brethren’s charming gestures,
Heathenish Judith’s mirth, wrath, truth
Wordsworth snatched three dirty trees or
Thirty-three trees, thriving youth.

cause of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel;
cause for he hath glorified thee. —My thoughts are not thy
thoughts, neither are my ways thy ways, saith the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my
ways higher than thy ways, and my thoughts, than thy
thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from
heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth
and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed
to the sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my word be
that goeth forth out of my mouth. —He that speaketh
truth sheweth forth righteousness. He that keepeth his
mouth, keepeth his life. The soul of the sluggard desireth,
and hath nothing. He that spareth his rod hateth his son,
but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. A wrathful
man stirreth up strife, but he that is slow to anger,
appeaseth strife. A wise son maketh a glad father, but a
foolish man despiseth his mother. And he humbled thee,
and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna,
which thou knowest not, neither did thy fathers know;
that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of the Lord doth man live. Thou shalt consider
in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son, so the
Lord thy God chasteneth thee. He that wasteth his
father and chaseth his mother, causeth shame and
bringeth reproach. The Bible


301. He does not know that sickening thirst
That sands one’s throat, before
The hangman with his gardener’s gloves
Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
That the throat may thirst no more.
Wilde
302. Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view,
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
Thine outward thus with outward praise is crowned;
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
In other accents do this praise confound,
By seeing farther than the eye has shown.
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were
kind,
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.
Shakespeare
303. Hear the sledges with the bells —
Silver bells,
What a world of merriment their me/ody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle
In the icy air of night!
While the stars that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline de/ight:


Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme
To the tintinnabu/ation that so musicaZ/y swells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells —
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Poe
304. Methought I saw my late espoused saint
Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,
Whom Jove s great son to her glad husband gave,
Rescued from Death by force, though pale and
faint.
Mine, as whom washed from spot of child-bed taint
Purification in the Old Law did save,
And such as yet once more I trust to have
Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,
Came vested all in white, pure as her mind.
Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight
Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined
So clear as in no face with more delight.
But, oh! as to embrace me she inclined,
I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.
Milton


APPENDIX II
REMARKABLE RHYMES
I am afraid that stern phoneticians will frown at some
of these rhymes, but the question is not how a word
should be pronounced, but how it is pronounced. Now
the fact is that many educated people do say the following
words as indicated by the rhyme, in rapid conversation.
It may teach the learner to catch some words which other-
wise might have escaped him.
Vigour—bigger
ocean —motion
exhaust —crossed
yacht —shot
coxswain—oxen
colonel —journal
mayoress—heiress
scourger—ordure
orchard —tortured
archer —departure
forger—ordure
cupboard—blubbered
courteous —purchase
Thalia —higher
choir —via
yours—saws
surely —Raleigh
toward —poured—sawed
nauseous —tortious—
cautious
torpor —warper —pauper
foreign—florin—warren


APPENDIX III
THE CHAOS
Dearest creature in Creation,
Studying English pronunciation,
I will teach you in my verse
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.
It will keep you, Susy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;
Tear in eye your dress you’ll tear,
Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer,
Pray, console your loving poet,
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it!
Just compare heart, beard and heard.
Dies and diet, lord and word,
Sword and sward, retain and Britain,
(Mind the latter, how it’s written);
Made has not the sound of bade ;
Say, said, pay, paid, laid but plaid.
Now I surely will not plague you
With such words as vague and ague.
But be careful how you speak,
Say gush, bush, steak, streak, break, bleak ,
Previous, precious, fuchsia, via,
Recipe, pipe, studding-sail, choir;
Woven, oven, how and low.
Script, receipt, shoe, poem, toe,
Hear me say, devoid of trickery:
Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore,
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles.
Exiles, similes, reviles,


Wholly, holly, signal, signing,
Same, examining, but mining,
Scholar, vicar and cigar.
Solar, mica, war and far.
From “desire”: desirable —admirable from “admire”;
Lumber, plumber, bier but brier,
Topsham, brougham, renown but known,
Knowledge, done, lone, gone, none, tone,
One, anemone, Balmoral,
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel,
Gertrude, German, wind and mind;
Scene, Melpomene, mankind,
Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather,
Reading, Reading, heathen, heather.
This phonetic labyrinth
Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, ninth, plinth.
Billet does not end like ballet.
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
Blood and flood are not like food,
Nor is mould like should and would.
Banquet is not nearly parquet,
Which exactly rhymes with khaki.
Discount, viscount, load and broad,
Toward, to forward, to reward.
Ricocheted and croqueting, croquet ?
Right! Your pronunciation’s 0.K.;
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
Friend and fiend, alive and live.
Is your r correct in higher ?
Keats asserts it rhymes Thalia;
Hugh but hug and hood but hoot,
Buoyant, minute but minute.


Do you know the Book of Joshua ?
Are you fond of it ? Of course you are.
Would it tally with my rhyme
If I mentioned paradigm ?
Twopence, threepence, tease are easy,
But cease, greasy, grease and greasy ?
Venice, nice, valise, revise,
Rabies but lullabies.
Would you like some more? You’ll have it:
David, affidavit, davit,
Calico but caliph. Sheik
Has the sound of Czech or ache.
Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.
We say hallowed but allowed.
People, leopard, towed but vowed.
Mark the difference, moreover,
Between mover, plover, Dover,
Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
Chalice but police and lice.
Camel, constable, unstable,
Principle, disciple, label,
Petal, penal and canal,
Wait, surmise, plait, promise, pal,
Suit, suite, ruin. Circuit, conduit
Rhyme with “shirk it” and “beyond it,”
But it is not hard to tell,
Why it’s pall, mall but Pall Mall.
Muscle, muscular, gaol, iron,
Timber, climber, bullion, lion,
Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
Senator, spectator, mayor.


Foreign Accent
Ivy, privy, famous. Clamour
Has the a of drachm and “hammer,”
Pussy, hussy and possess,
Desert but desert, address.
Golf, wolf, countenance ; lieutenants
Hoist, in lieu of flags, left pennants.
Courier, courtier, tomb, bomb, comb,
Cow but Cowfer, some and home.
Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
Neither does devour with clangour.
Soul but foul and gaunt but aunt ;
Font, front, wont, want, grand, and, grant
Arsenic, specific, scenic,
Relic, rhetoric, hygienic,
Gooseberry, goose, and close but close,
Paradise, rise, rose and dose.
Say inveigh, neigh but inveigle,
Make the latter rhyme with eagle,
Mind! Meandering but mean,
Serpentine and magazine.
And I bet you, dear, a penny,
You say mani{-iold) like many,
Which is wrong. Say rapier, pier,
Tier (one who ties) but tier.
Arch archangel ! Pray, does erring
Rhyme with herring, or with stirring ?
Prison, bison, treasure-trove,
Treason, hover, cover, cove.
Perseverance, severance. Ribald
Rhymes (but piebald doesn’t) with nibbled.
Phaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw,
Lien, phthisic, shone, bone, pshaw.


Don’t be down, my own, but rough it,
And distinguish buffet — buffet ;
Brood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, stool,
Worcester, Boleyn, foul and ghoul.
With an accent pure and sterling,
You say year, but some say yearling ;
Evil, devil, mezzotint,
Mind the zl (A gentle hint.)
Now you need not pay attention
To such sounds as I don’t mention.
Sounds like pores, pause, pours and paws,
Rhyming with the pronoun yours ;
Nor are proper names included,
Though I often heard, as you did,
Funny rhymes to unicorn,
Yes, you know them: Vaughan and Strachan.
No, my maiden, fair and comely,
I don’t want to speak of Cholmondeley,
No. Yet Froude, compared with proud,
Is no better than Macleod.
But mind trivial and vial,
Tripod, menial, denial,
Troll and trolley, realm and ream,
Schedule, mischief, schism and scheme.
Argil, gill, Argyle, gill. Surely
May be made to rhyme with Raleigh,
But you surely must not say:
Piquet rhymes with sobriquet.
Had this invalid invalid,
Worthless documents ? How pallid,
How uncouth he, couchant, looked,
When for Portsmouth I had booked!


Zeus, Thebes, Thales, Aphrodite,
Paramour enamoured, flighty!
Episodes, antipodes,
Acquiesce and obsequies.
Pious, impious, limb, climb, comely,
Worsted, worsted, crumbly, dumbly,
Conquer, conquest, breathed, breathed, fan,
Wan, Sedan and artisan.
The th will surely trouble you
More than r, ch or w,
May then these phonetic gems:
Thomas, thyme, Theresa, Thames,
Thomson, Chatham, Waltham, Streatham,
—There are more, but I forget ’em —
Wait! I’ve got it: Anthony,
Lighten your anxiety.
The archaic word albeit
Does not rhyme with eight—you see it;
With and forthwith : one has voice,
One has not; you make your choice.
Shoes, goes, does. 1 Now first say: finger;
Then say: singer, ginger, linger.
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze and gauge,
Marriage, foliage, mirage, age.
Hero, heron, query, very,
Parry, tarry, fury, bury,
Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth,
Job, Job, blossom, bosom, oath.
Faugh, oppugnant, keen oppugners,
Bowing, bowing banjo-tuners!
1 No, you are wrong. This is the plural of doe ,


Yachts you know. But noes, canoes,
Puisne truism, use, to use ?
Though the difference seems little,
We say actual, but victual,
Seat, sweat, chaste, caste, Leigh, eight, height,
Put, nut, granite and unite.
Reefer does not rhyme with deafer,
Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
Dull, hull, Geoffrey, George, ate, late,
Hint, pint, senate but sedate,
Gaelic, Arabic, pacific,
Science, conscience, scientific,
Tour but our and succour, four,
Gas, alas and Arkansas.
Sea, idea, guinea, area,
Psalm, Maria but malaria.
Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean,
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.
Compare alien with Italian,
Dandelion with battalion,
Rally with ally; yea, ye,
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, key, quay.
Say aver, but ever, fever,
Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.
Never guess—it is not safe;
We say calves, valves, half, but Ralph.
Starry, granary, canary.
Crevice but device and eyrie,
Face but preface, but grimace,
Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass,
Bass, large, target, gin, give, verging,
Ought, oust, joust and scour but scourging,


Ear but earn, and wear and tear
Do not rhyme with “here,” but “ere.”
Seven is right, but so is even,
Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen,
Monkey, donkey, clerk and jerk,
Asp, grasp, wasp, demesne, cork, work.
A of valour, vapid, vapour,
S of news (compare news-paper),
G of gibbet, gibbon, gist,
I of antichrist and grist
Differ, like diverse and divers,
Rivers, strivers, shivers, fivers,
Once but nonce, toll, doll but roll,
Polish, Polish, poll and poll.
Pronunciation —think of psyche ! —
Is a paling, stout and spikey;
Won’t it make you lose your wits,
Writing “groats” and saying groats'?
It’s a dark abyss or tunnel.
Strewn with stones, like rowlock, gunwale,
Islington and Isle of Wight,
Housewife, verdict and indict.
Don’t you think so, reader, rather,
Saying lather, bather, father ?
Finally: which rhymes with “enough,”
Though, through, plough, cough, hough, or tough ?
Hiccough has the sound of “sup” . . .
My advice is—give it up!

A Year in England
for Foreign Students
for Indian Students
for Japanese Students
by WILFRID THORLEY
Cr. B vo. Illustrated . 25. 6 d.
These books are designed to teach the foreigner in his own home as much
of our English life and language as he might learn were he to spend a
year among us. The student is shown characteristic scenes in London
and other cities, and is given a glimpse of our customs and laws.
“To learn about a country while one learns its language is useful in
more than one sense; it makes the teaching ‘live/ and it teaches the
vocabulary of daily life.” — Times Educational Supplement
Elocution for Teachers and Students
Cv. B vo. by ROSE I. PATRY 4*- 6 d.
A book that should be of real practical use to teachers of elocution, as
it contains a number of exercises for speech training and for the correc-
tion of numerous defects in the voice.
