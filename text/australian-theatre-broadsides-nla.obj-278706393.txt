Little Bobby : “ Papa, what’s a sani-
tarium ? ”
Mr. Hadaliver : “ It’s a place where,
after you’ve been there a week, you wish
you were dead; and after you’ve been
there a month, y«n think you never were
alive before.”
“They say that Mr. Snickers is a
professional humorist, but I have never
heard him make a joke in conversation,”
said Mrs Mcßride. “Oh, it’s against
his ideas of propriety to talk shop,” replied
Mr. Mcßride.
Burkley: “ Why is it a woman can
never keep a secret P ”
Henpeck: “Butshe can. I have never
suoceede i in getting my wife to tell me
where she hides our pocket hook, and
I’ve been trying for fifteen years.”
Beauty unadorned may be most adorned j
but, fortunately for the milliner and the
dressmaker, it doesn’t think so.
O’Plaherty: “Is your son working
now, Pat ? ”
Pat; “ Shuro an’ he’s got a job in a
powder mill, with good prospects uv
gittin’ a rise.”
“ This is the seventh time you’ve been
before me,” said the magistrate. “Yes,”
replied the culprit; “it's strange how
some men hold on to office.”
The Ruling Passion. —Editor’s Wife—
Oh, John, baby has swallowed a hut-
son!” Editor—“ Well, let’s hope it
won’t hurt the poor little ohap, but should
it happen to kill him, what a splendid
alliterative headline it will make!—“A
Baby Bolts a Button and Becomes
Breathless ’!” Editor’s Wife—“ Oh, yon
brute!”
Priscilla: “Jack is the oddest fellow. He took me
driving yesterday, and when we were seven miles from home
he said if I wouldn’t promise to marry him he’d make me get
out and walk back.”
Penelope : “ Did you walk back ?”
Priscilla; “No, indeed; but the horse did.”
A gentleman tells of the loss of a steamer through the
carelessness of the captain, who stood upon the pilot-house.
A rock appeared ahead; in trepidation he rang two bells,
one to “go ahead ” and one to “go astern.” The engineer
obeyed both bells, and the boat parted in the middle.
“ What makes you limp so ? Shoes too small 7 ”
“ No ; feet too large.”
“ I’m a reader of your paper,” said the man whose head
was bowed down by reason of a boil on the back of hit
neck, a “ I came m to make a request.”
“ Well,” replied the editor, “ what can I do for you ? ”
“ I want to know if you can’t stick your posters a little
ower down, until I get over this trouble of mine.”
At a public gathering lately one of the gentlemen present
was called upon for a speech, and this is how he responded:
“'Gentlemen and women—l ain’t no speeches. Mor*n
twenty year back 1 came here a poor idiot boy, and now

A minister’s little daughter and two
little boys, the sons of commercial travel-
lers, were talking about their respective
fathers, and what they did. One little boy
said:—“ My papa sells shoes.” The other
said—“ Mine sells paper,” and turning to
the little girl, “ What does your papa sell?”
For a moment the child hesitated, but, not
to be outdone by boys, she replied with a
grand air—“ My papa sells talk.”

The“ Prompter who loses the place.
Norah had been told to say at the front
door that her mistress was not at home
when certain callers appeared upon the
scene. It evidently went much against
the grain for her to make herself respon-
sible for even so small a white lie, but she
promised to do so, and, with certain modi-
fications, she kept her word. “Is Mrs.
Blank at home?” queried the caller.
For this wan toime, Mrs. Smithers, she
ain’t! ” said the maid, “ but Hivin help
her if ye* ashk me again! I’ll not loi
twoice for annybody livin’, upon me sowl! ”
There were altogther about three Hun-
dred distinct epidemics of influmza in
Europe between 1510, when the disease
was first noted at Malia, and 1850. In
1729 the whole of Europe suffered severely.
According to statistics published by Che
Novoe Vremya, the disease caused 908
deaths in London in one week, and in
Vienna sixty thousand persons were af-
fected. In 1737 and 1743 there were
further outbreaks, and the deaths in one
week in London amounted to one thous-
and. In 1775 domestic animals were
first attacked by it. In 1782 forty thous-
and persons fell ill of it in St. Petersburg
in twenty four hours. In St. Petersburg
quinine is now served out daily to the
troops, mixed with vodka.

A WORD TO
YOUNG WIVES,
Be Wise and remember the
aphorism that ' The road to a
man’s heart lies through his
stomach.’ Therefore do not
imperil your husband’s affec-
tion by upsetting his diges-
tion, when by reading the
marginal verse aad profiting
by Mary’s experience, you can
ensure his undying devotion.
DR. WAUGH’S Baking Powder

Woods' Australian Diaries for 1902 r«.
Two East-enders were discussing the war new*.
** I say, Bill, who’s this ’ere Warren ? ”
“ Why,” said the other, “he was a copper once. Charlie
Warren, don’t you remember ? ”
The other reflected for a moment, then he said, medita-
tively ;
“He never copped me. Which was his beat ? ”
“Were you really happier before you became civilised ?"
asked the white man.
“ Well,” answered the Pacific Islander, “ I must say I
didn’t have all this worry about whether my trousers were
getting baggy at the knee.”
A MISNOMER.
Mosb —“Lookheah, Abe Johnsing! I’s tired ob yo’r callin’ me
‘ shorty,’ I’s jes’ as tall as yo’ am, only mah tallness am concealed in

Barometer Evangelista Torricella,
invented, 1643.
Battery—Electric; about 1745; claimed
for Kleist Cun sens, and Professor Mus-
ohenbrook, of Leyden.
Bayonets—lnvented at Bayonne, 1670;
used in England, 1693, fixed in gun
with wooden handles; socket bayonet

me, but I heard you tell the gentleman
who just left you that you would wash
your hands of the whole affair.”

The Parisians have a new insurance
scheme. Riders in cabs can, by placing
a son in the slot of a little machine in the
oab, obtain a certificate of insurance. Of
course, the insurance only holds good
whilst the assured is in the cab.
Mary’s Trials and Triumph.
Shame on you, George,’ thus spoke his spouse,
And sad tears with her voice were blended ;
* This is the way you keep your vows,
And thus your vaunted love has ended.
‘ Scarcely a year has passed away
Since these your vows of love were spoken,
Bat vows and promises, they say,
Are made, like piecrust, to be broken.
‘ Now not one word of love you give,
No smiles, no kisses, or caresses ;
And every weary day I live
Your coldness my poor heart oppresses.’
* Mary,’ said George, ‘ you need not scold ;
Stay your reproaches for a season.
I may, perhaps, be cross and cold,
But, wife, I have sufficient reason.
' How do yon think that I, whom you
With your vile cookery are killing,
Can smile and kiss, and bill and coo,
When pain through every nerve is thrilling!
* Look at the pastry, cakes and bread
You place upon this breakfast table ;
Say, to digest such lumps of lead
Is any human stomach able !
* You quote a proverb to me, but
About your piecrust ’twas not spoken,
Yours might with axe or saw be cut,
But could not, like a vow, be broken.
‘Now, mark this, Mary, if love’s flame
Has vanished like a bursted bubble,
Yours is the fault, you are to blame ;
Your cookery has caused the trouble.’
‘Oh, George,’ sail Mary, ‘say not so,’
And here her voice began to soften,
‘ls mine the fault? Well, well, you know
I have tried hard, I have tried often.
‘ To make light cakes and bread and paste,
But trying always ends in failing,
Constant disaster, loss and waste
Prove all my efforts unavailing.’
‘ The fault is yours, and yours alone,’
Said George, and here his voice grew louder,
‘ Nor can I such a fault condone,
You will not use WAUQH'S BAKING
POWDER .’
‘ I’ll try it George ; I will, indeed,
Lest constant broils our hearts should sever.
She tried it, praying to succeed ;
Success at once crowned her endeavour.
No trouble now with cakes or bread,
No fear the pastry is not rising,
No longer sodden lumps of leads,
But viands light and appertising.
And no dark cloud of storm and strife
Now rises o’er the breakfast table.
Mary, a fond, a happy wife,
To cook to George’s taste is able.
And George, so all his neighbours say,
Of his dear wife grows daily prouder ;
While both for ever bless the day
When first she used WAUGH’S BAKING
POWDER.
