Curly Top and the
North Wind
By
ANNE RANDALL
Drawings by
JOYCE JANES


CURLY TOP was a little boy, six years of age. He
was a nice boy, but he had some bad habits.
Very often he forgot his books, cap or jumper,
left them at school or out in the garden, which worried
his mother. He just did not seem to care. He was
often rude to older people and sometimes said
naughty words that he heard at school. This was a
pity, for he could be a sweet little fellow until he got
what his Mummy called ?a black monkey on his back.?
When this happened. Oh dear! he just played up,
made Mummy sad and upset the whole house.
One day Curly Top?s Mother allowed him to take
her rug out on to the lawn. ?When you come in,? said
Mummy, ?shake the rug and bring it back.? ?I won?t,?
muttered Curly Top to himself which was very
cheeky of him. But as we have told you, he was some-
times a very rude little boy.
Curly Top went out with rather a sulky face,
spread the rug out in the sun and sat down to look at
is picture books.
began to blow. At first it was soft, but, after a while
it got stronger, and the bits of dead grass got caught up and whirled
high. Curly Top blinked sleepily at them. Suddenly he, too, was caught
up by the North Wind, and up and up he went until he gasped for
breath. ?Ha, Ha!? said the Wind in his ear. ?So you are Curly Top, the
bad boy. It?s time that you had a lesson, my lad.?
Curly Top wanted to say something, but he
couldn?t seem to get his breath, and he seemed to be
going so terribly fast and high that even the trees
looked like dots away down below. He only knew that
he wanted Mummy.
The North Wind spoke again, but not to
him, and he could see nothing but sky and
clouds.
?Hullo, West Wind,? it said. ?Just see
what I picked up from a rug on the lawn.
It is a very naughty, cheeky little boy. He
won?t do what he is told, is rude to older
people and leaves his cap, books and
jumper behind him when school is out.
Here you are, catch him.
want to be bothered with
him.? Suddenly he went
through the air quicker


than ever and was caught by something he still could not / I
see. It was the West Wind. ?Oh! What a shame,? she / /
said. ?He has curly hair and blue eyes, and a nice little / /
face, and you say he is so naughty. All good boys have /
nice manners. I don?t think I want him either, so catch, / /
And there he was flying through the air again, loved / /
by no one and wanted by no one. How awful. He gave / j
a big gasp just as the North Wind caught him. / j
?I do not want this boy,? he complained. ?If he loved J
his mother and father he would not be rude to them, and A /
a cheeky boy is never liked anywhere. People do not like / /
him when he is small, and they dislike him even more \ /
when he grows up, so take him back. Here, I?m tossing \
Again he was gasping in fright and sailing through \ . V\
the air, and once more the West Wind caught him. ?I am \\ \ \
a shifting wind,? she said, ?and any moment I may move \
on, for I cool the air after you have heated it. I do not A\
want a cheeky boy, so if you throw him away I do not see / j


who is going to catch him. I have my work to
do, and carrying bad little boys is not part of
that work.?
?I know that,? said the North Wind with a
flourish of leaves and twigs. (How they
whirled. You?ve seen a whirligig of leaves,
twigs and pieces of paper, haven?t you, when
the wind takes them up and just whirls them?
Faster and faster they go, and higher and higher until the wind gets
tired and then they all flutter to earth.)
Curly Top could see them now, and it made him quite giddy to look.
He wondered what would happen to him if the North Wind suddenly
got tired. He would have so far to fall, and what a dreadful lot of
bruises he would have.
?Someone has to teach this child a lesson,? said the North Wind.
?Yesterday he left his cap at school, and the day before it was his coat,
and before that it was his bag.?
?He was rude to the girl in the
sweet shop, and he went into another
person?s garden and pulled up some
flowers. This sort of thing cannot
go on.?
?I don?t like that at all,? said
the West Wind, ?I am a gentle
thing, mostly, and even when I am
commanded I don?t like being
rough. You can?t give this naughty
boy to me. I won?t have him.? The
North Wind gave such a big sigh
that Curly Top was blown far up.
Three birds began to circle round
him. ?Who have you there?? they


asked the North Wind, ?and why is he
Tv ere with us?? ?I took him from down
PiT below to teach him a lesson, but now I
can?t get rid of him. The West Wind
0\\rT ' refused to have him, and I do not want
*STY /% him. Will y� u take him?? said the
North Wind. ?He has to learn how to
behave. His school things are left
behind him, and he is very rude and
m. untidy. He COULD be a NICE child,
' but I haven?t any time to teach him.
I?m due elsewhere.?
?? ?You should have left him where he
was then,? said a large black bird
should put their work
on to others. We, too, have plenty to do.? Curly Top [mm
felt so sad he wanted to cry, but the tears just stung [ J1|P
his eyes and wouldn?t come out. No one wanted him.
If only he could get back to Mummy!
?We had better take him,? said one of the other
birds. ?He can come with us to the bird?s party to-
night, and then we may find someone who wants him.?
The North Wind whistled and said, ?Well, catch
him, for I am going to toss him over now. I wish I had
left him far down below. I did think the West Wind ijSjB
would help, but she won?t do anything for naughty H
boys, and I can?t take him over the world with me.?
Then he tossed Curly Top and the first bird let him slip. 11
Down, down he was falling fast, and he could hardly u
breathe at all. Then a bird must have dropped swiftly
and caught him, for he stopped falling, and the next flfcr
he knew he was in a lovely garden. A black crow in
spectacles and a black tailed coat came up to him.
?Come this way,? said the crow in his harsh voice. He
led the way to a gate with roses growing all over it.


their wings. ?If he touches us we will lose
all our beauty,? cried a lovely golden and
green Butterfly. ?He is a naughty boy.
Even the North Wind won?t take him back.
We dare not, Mr. Owl.? And they flew off.
Only a beautiful, blue Butterfly hung back,
and came close to Curly Top. ?Do learn to
be good,? she whispered, and hurried after
the others.
Black Crow. ?This,? the Crow replied,
?is a naughty boy named Curly Top.
The North Wind tossed him over and
said he had to be taught a lesson.?
The Owl shook his head. ?Tell me
more,? he said.
?Make Curly Top tell you,? said the
Crow with a nasty laugh, and he flew
away. The Owl tapped his paper
angrily. Then he looked at Curly Top.
He had very large, round eyes, and a
round face.
?Well!? he said, ?What is all the fuss over? I?ve just
got up after sleeping all day, so don?t waste my time.?
Curly Top twisted his fingers together, and looked
wistfully at the Owl. ?No one wants me ?cos they say I?m
naughty,? he said slowly. ?And are you?? asked the Owl.
?What have you been doing? Speak up, quickly.? He tap-
ped the paper with his claw, and Curly Top could see he was
getting cross again.
?I leave my things behind at school,? said Curly Top.
?I forget them, and I?l?sometimes I am rude to big
people and say naughty things.? The Owl looked steadily
at him. ?Ha,? he said, ?so you know just why you are
naughty. That makes it worse, for you should have tried
to be good. Come and look through this rose gate. Curly
looked through, and WHAT DO you think he
saw? A lovely flower-filled garden, with large,
bright Butterflies flying about it. The Owl
gave a call and they came over the high fence.
?Take this little boy back to his home,? he said. A
?I don?t want him in the land of Tidiness.? A
The big Butterflies dipped close to Curly
Top, and he could see the wonderful colours of


The Owl looked at him. ?I don?t know what is to be done with you,?
he said. ?That is the worst part of being a bad child ?no one wants
you. ITI go and look for the North Wind.?
He flew away, and Curly Top began to sob. He cried so bitterly that
his tears ran in a stream down his cheeks and on to the ground. They
made a wet patch, and up sprang a large mushroom. ?Good gracious,?
said the Mushroom, ?I thought it was rain, and it?s your tears, Curly
Top. Do sit on my roof?it makes quite a nice seat?and tell me all your
troubles.? ?No one wants me,? said Curly Top, ?and Mr. Owl has gone
for the North Wind. I don?t like the North Wind. He took me from my
home.? ?Do stop crying or you will wash me
away,? said the Mushroom. ?I will see what
I can do, although we are not supposed to
help the naughty ones.? He called out and
the Blue Butterfly came fluttering down. She
looked at Curly Top sitting on the roof of the
Mushroom.
?Get Curly Top into the garden,? said the
Mushroom, speaking very fast. ?The South
Wind might help to send him home.?
The Blue Butterfly dropped a silken lad-
der right in front of Curly Top. ?Jump on,?
she said, ?and I?ll see if I can get you through
the gate.?
Curly Top stepped on to the ladder, and
away they went. Alas, the gate shut before
they got there. The flowers had little round
faces, all of different colours. They looked
so sweet, but very much afraid.
?Go away,? they all cried together. ?You
have Curly Top, the naughty boy, and he
pulls up plants. You can?t come in the
Beautiful Garden. The North Wind would
blow hot and fierce and destroy us. Go
away.?
?Oh dear!? said the Butterfly, sadly. ?I
don?t know what I can do about you. If only
you had been kind to little plants
the flower fairies would have let us
in. Once in, we should soon have
found a way to get you home. We
MUST do something before the
North Wind comes again.? Blue
Butterfly was very distressed.

?What is going to happen to me,? cried Curly Top. ?Mummy will be
looking for me,? and he began to sob bitterly.
Suddenly a golden light spread itself round them, and Curly Top
stopped crying and looked about him. There ?RIGHT in front of him
?coming up over the garden wall, were two golden roses. They were
on one Stalk, and the loveliest things he had ever seen. He laughed
through his tears, and held out his hands. The big Rose shook back
and forth.
?No human hands touch us,? she said in a soft, golden voice. ?We
have come to try to help you to get free of your naughty ways. This is
the only way in which you may find your way home again. So, listen
well to me, and dry your tears, little Curly Top. If you make up your
mind to be a better boy, the fairies will help you, I know.? Curly Top
dried his tears on his blue hanky, and looked up at the Golden Rose.
?I didn?t know Roses could speak,? he said. The Rose seemed to
smile at him, for its petals were like a face, and very beautiful at that.

?You are close to the Enchanted Garden,?
she said, ?and it is full of Magic. The
most wonderful things can happen here,
but everyone has to be tested to see
whether they are good or bad. I have
magic, but if I use my magic wrongly I
lose it, and that is why I cannot send you
back yet. Now, listen very carefully,
Curly Top, and think before you speak.
Beside me is a lovely bud. That bud is


like a child. It unfolds leaf by leaf, growing more
beautiful with each opening. You are like that bud,
dear, and every kind action is like the unfolding of a
leaf.? She pointed with a green stalk, and sure enough
another leaf had opened.
?If you are honest you never steal. If you are
truthful you never tell a lie. See, another leaf unfurls,
and the beauty of this opening bud is like a good
child?s face. If you are tidy you put things away
after you, and if you are thoughtful you take charge
of your own things and put them in their right place.
If you are gentle you have no desire to be rude, neither
do you hit smaller boys. If you love pretty
flowers you do not destroy plants, because
those plants grow into flowers. See, Curly
Top, our bud has grown up. All its petals
are unfurled. What do you think of it??
Curly Top gave a big sigh. ?I?d like it against
my face,? he said softly.
Then the Rose leant right across, and it brushed his little face, iust
like a thistledown kiss.
He laughed and closed his eyes. ?That is nice. I like it,? he said.
When he opened his eyes the Roses had vanished, and instead of the
high, walled-in garden he was in a small one. There were flower beds
full of young plants, and the paths were flagged with white stones.
Curly Top began to walk along the path. He bent to pull the plants
out, but a nettle leant over and stung him on the finger. Then he began
to think. Yes, it was wrong to pull them out for nothing.
The sun came out very strong, and he felt rather hot so he took off
his jumper
and put it on
the path. So
many beds
and paths.
Then suddenly the
North Wind began to
blow and after a while
Curly Top felt a little
cold. He realised that
he had left his jumper
behind him. He turned
and ran back along the
path, looking here and


there and everywhere, but no jumper could he find.
Then, hopping along the path came a huge green
Grasshopper, and, on his back was Curly Top s
jumper.
?Hey!? cried Curly Top,
?you have my jumper on.
Please give it to me.? ?Ha,
Ha!? said the Grasshopper,
?You catch me first. Why
don?t you look after your
things. You are a bad boy, and
the North Wind will be after
you.? Away he went, and
Curly Top after him. But
though he ran his hardest he
could not catch the Grass-
hopper. So he stopped and
a bad state for the want of water.
' looked about him. The plants were in a bad state for the want of water.
Curly Top began to look for a tap. At last he found one. There was a
watering can right under it, so
Curly Top began to water the
plants. Their little heads began to
come up as soon as they had had a C y
drink of the cool water. Then a j/ o
frog popped out. ?Did I see you f
chasing someone?? he asked in a VL,
croaky voice. So Curly Top told him \
about leaving his jumper behind
and the Grasshopper stealing it.
The Frog put his head on one side
and looked very thoughtful. ?You
were good to water the plants,? he
said, ?so I shall try to help you. That
Grasshopper causes a lot of trouble
about here. Jump on my back,
Curly Top, and we will be after
him.?
Away they went, hop, hopping
along at a great pace. Curly Top
laughed and clung tight to the
wrinkles about the frog?s neck.
They soon came up with the
Grasshopper. There he sat, up in


/
the bamboo clump, and he was rub-
bing his hands with glee, and
smiling so widely. He looked round
when he heard the thump, thump of
the Frog along the path, and got
such a fright that he began spinning
round the bamboo shoot. He went
so fast that the jumper flew off and
down, right to Curly Top. When
V
v
they looked the Grasshopper had dis-
appeared, and the Frog laughed so heartily
that Curly Top fell off his back, and only just
missed the edge of a pool. Then he heard a
big splash. The Frog was nowhere to be seen, but
there were ripples on the water in the fountain.
| Curly Top stood and looked sadly about him. He felt
lonely now that the Frog had left him, and the wind had
turned cold. Then he saw the Blue Butterfly flitting towards
him. She dropped a ladder for him and said, ?You are still in
Magic Land, Curly Top, but you are not safe yet. Remember
what the Golden Rose told you. If you do wrong the magic will
forsake you. Come, step on, and we must see about a coat for
you.?
Curly Top looked into the fountain. ?Good-bye, Mr. Frog,?
he called. ?I like you, and thanks for getting back my jumper.?
From the bottom of the round, fountain tank came a sound like
?Four bob, four bob.?
Curly Top stepped on the ladder and the Butterfly rose
swiftly into the air. They came down like a plane and in a green
paddock where sheep were feeding.
?Where is the spinning wheel and all the
spinners?? cried the Butterfly. ?This boy needs
a coat very badly.? What a fuss there was. A
flock of birds pulled wool from the sheep and
rushed it to the spinners. Some white hens,
quite a dozen, rushed up, and, putting on their
glasses, they began to knit at a great rate.
Then they slipped the coat on Curly Top,
and he looked very sweet and
fluffy in it. He played about
with the lambs and got so hot he


tossed his coat off. A big sheep
with a black nose came up to
him. ?Do you like mushrooms,
Curly Top?? ?Yes, yes, yes!?
cried Curly Top excitedly. ?I?ll
take some home to Mummy.?
?Jump on my
back,? said the
Sheep, and soon
they were canter-
ing across the paddock. Up over the bridge they went, and into a mossy
dell, which was dotted with mushrooms. Curly Top ran to them, and
picked one. It just went to dust in his hand. So did each one as he
picked it. He remembered then. ?My coat, my coat!? he cried. He
looked for the sheep, but it had gone and so had the bridge when he
came to cross it. He cried and called to the sheep, but there was no
answer. He had forgotten again. Always forgetting things?that was
his worst fault. Then he saw the Blue Butterfly, and called out to her,
?Help me, please. I must get my coat. I must go back.? ?Well done,
you shall go back,? she said. ?Step on.? And away they went.
His coat was gone. Birds were chattering up in the tree, fighting
over his coat, for they wanted to make a nest out of it. Curly Top felt
cross with them, and was about to call out rude things, but the Butter-
fly brushed his cheek with her wings, and he remembered again. Little
boys must NOT be cheeky. All the anger went out of him, and he sud-
denly laughed up at them. ?You can have it for your nests. I don?t
mind,? he said. ?But perhaps lam naughty for forgetting it. I DID
come back, though, didn?t I?? And the
birds all called out, ?Yes, yes. Here is
your coat, Curly Top.? They dropped it
down to him, and he put it on once more.
He looked up to speak to them, but they
were gone. Not a
twitter to be heard.
He was all alone,
and he felt sud-
denly lonely. Why
did people disap-
pear like this, he


wondered? He didn?t remem-

was a great rustling in the grasses
and rushes, and out came numbers of mice.
Curly Top could hear the water
running over stones.
a little boat. Please make
n it quickly,? he said. What a rush and
J bustle as they pulled up rushes and began
Wm to weave a boat for Curly Top! Such a
lovely, green boat ft was, with oars, and a
m c JT \ seat for him to sit on.
IBS The big mouse walked about giving
M orders, and when it was made they put it in
the water and held it while Curly Top got
k \ V / i in. ?Row until you see the garden wall
/ i with the roses:it. Call out,
mHL illr>p|ll and w iU be well,? said the Mouse.
?Thank you,? said Curly Top. He looked
around, but they had all disappeared, so


he rowed his little boat down
the creek until he came to
the wall, and saw the roses
over it. He called out and
the next moment he was
in the garden among the
flowers.
He turned to look for his
boat, but it was nowhere to
be seen, and the little river,
too, had gone. He wandered
along the path feeling very
sad, and longing for his
Mummy. How he wished he
had been a good boy!
Then he saw the foun-
tain and the watering can,
and he smiled and ran
forward. Soon he was busy
watering all the flowers.
How they thanked him.
?Now my petals can open,?
said the Rose Bush, ?and
every one will be a beautiful thought for you, because you have been
kind to me. You may have just one wish, Curly Top.? Curly Top looked
up wistfully. ?I wish for my Mummy, because I love her, and I?m
lonely,? he said. ?That, really,? said the Rose, ?is a very big wish. You
see, you are here as a punishment for being naughty. I will do my best
for you and see what can be done.? Curly Top looked up with a smile,
but the Rose had disappeared. So had all the other flowers, and Curly
Top ran fast along the path, for he was getting frightened.
Then he heard hoof beats coming at a great pace, and he stool still,
panting from his run.
Around the bend of the path came a white donkey and on its back
was a golden saddle with flying stirrups. It stopped with a loud bray.
Curly Top jumped with fright. ?Don?t be afraid,? said the Donkey.
?Oh dear, lam out of breath. I?ll sit down right here and you can get
on my back, and we will have a nice little talk. Tell me what you have
been doing to get here.? So, sitting on the golden saddle, Curly Top
told the White Donkey all about his adventures. ?I want to go home,?
he said, stroking the soft, white ears. ?Do help me. I?ll be a good boy.?
?I can try, but it won?t be easy. It was the Frog that sent me to you,
and he is a nice fellow. Our trouble will be with the North Wind. He
is a very disagreeable fellow who enjoys punishing little people. He is


A the only one who can take you back, and if he thinks \J[ Ss >S s -o{/
/ we are looking for him ? well ? he won?t come our
/ way. Now hang on, and away we go.?
\ / Curly Top slid his feet into the stirrups, and Xv \/
\ / off they galloped. He loved it, and waved the golden \J \
\ / reins. The Donkey raced along at a great speed. N \
W I The pulled up under a willow tree. Its long fingers \ \ \l jV \
Y / swept the grass. Then a whisper reached them. \ \ \1 \1
A / ?The North Wind will come this way soon. The \ \ \K ]

/ Curly Top jumped off and sat on the shelf of rock. I \
I ?What a nice little cave,? he said, but the Donkey y

/y / / So Curly Top sat still and waited, and soon he /V 1

the North Wind. ?He was sent to be punished and mi'ml
\ he will be.? ?Oh, please,? said the Willow, ?just jfe 1/
\ \ give him another chance. He is very small.? Jjf?
\ \ ?Nonsense,? cried the North Wind crossly. ?A boy / p I h

\ ?Well,? said the West Wind cheerfully, ?I know V Sr r

Then Curly Top remembered what the nice ( \ \

whistle. They began to drop lower, swirling rM \ > / ,
like an eddy of leaves which made Curly Top
The next thing he knew he was lying on his �J(jSSl i

echoed the South Wind. ?I?ll make a bargain with you, North Wind. If you will
take Curly Top back to his mother, we will all help you to find the orchards. We can?t
go with you because each of us has his own way to blow, but we will tell you where
they are.? ?That is so, that is so,? echoed the East and West Winds together. The
North Wind made eddies of the dead leaves as he thought this out. Curly Top listened
anxiously, afraid that the North Wind would not take him. ?You tell me where the
orchards are and I will take Curly Top after,? he said slyly. The Winds rustled the
tree with great strength. ?No,? they said. ?You must take Curly Top first.? ?Shall
we take him with us then?? he asked. Again they shook the leaves of the Willow and
said, ?No. No. Do it our way, or we are going away.? The North Wind was cross.
?Oh, very well,? he said harshly. ?Where is this boy??
?Come out, Curly Top,? whispered the Willow. Curly Top came out, and the South
Wind brushed his cheek. ?You have done well, little man,? she whispered. ?See I
am putting this whistle around your neck. If you think things are not going well, just
blow hard, and I will help you, for the North Wind is in a bad mood to-day. Anything
can happen.? Before Curly Top could answer he was whipped up and lifted high
among the clouds. How fast they went like a bird. ?Ha, Ha,? cried Wind.
