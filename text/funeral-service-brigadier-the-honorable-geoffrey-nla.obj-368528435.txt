I am the resurrection and the life, saith the
Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he livei and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die. —St. John xi, 25, 26.
I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he
shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And
though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet
in my flesh shall I see God : whom I shall see for
myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.
—Job xix, 25, 26, 27.
We brought nothing into this world, and it
is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
Name of the Lord. —I Tim. vi, 7; Job i, 21,
Music by William Croft.
PsALM 90. Domine, refugiwn.
LORD, thou hast been our refuge: from one
generation to another.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever
the earth and the world were made: thou art God
from everlasting, and world without end.
3 Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou
sayest; Come again, ye children of men;


4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as
yesterday : seeing that is past as a watch in the night.
5 As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as
a sleep : and fade away suddenly like the grass.
6 In the morning it is green, and groweth up :
but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and
withered.
7 For we consume away in thy displeasure; and
are afraid at thy wrathful indignation.
8 Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee : and our
secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
9 For when thou art angry all our days are gone:
we bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that
is told.
10 The days of our age are threescore years and
ten; and though men be so strong that they come to
fourscore years: yet is their strength then but labour
and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are
gone.
11 But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for
even thereafter as a man feareth, so is thy displeasure.
12 So teach. us to number our days : that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom.
13 Turn thee again 0 Lord, at the last: and be
gracious unto thy servants.
14 0 satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon : so
shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
15 Comfort us again now after the time that thou
hast plagued us : and for the years wherein we have
suffered adversity.
16 Shew thy servants thy work: and their children
thy glory.
17 And the glorious Majesty of the Lord our
God be upon us: prosper thou the work of our
hands upon us, 0 prosper thou our handy-work.


Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to
the Holy Ghost ;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be : world without end. Amen.
Lesson—l Cor. XV.. y 35.
Anthem (Congregation will sit).
Here on earth have we no continuing place,
howbeit, we seek one to come.
Lo, I unfold unto you a mystery; we shall not
all sleep when He cometh, but we shall all be
changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the sound of the trumpet: for the trumpet shall
sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we all shall be changed.
Then what of old was written, the same shall
be brought to pass: for death shall be swallowed in
victory: ~
Grave, where is thy triumph? Death, 0 where
is thy sting?
Brahms.

Jesu, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy Bosom fly,
While the gathering waters roll,
While the tempest still is high:
Hide me, 0 my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past ;
Safe into the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last.
Other refuge have I none ;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee ;
Leave, ah ! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stay’d,
All my help from Thee I bring ;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,-.
Grace to cleanse from every sin ;
Let the healing streams abound ;
Make and keep me pure within ;’
Thou of Life the Fountain art; .
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity. Amen.
