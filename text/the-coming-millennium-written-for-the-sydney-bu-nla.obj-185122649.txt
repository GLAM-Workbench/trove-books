THE COMING MILLENNIUM
Written for the “ Sydney Bulletin " by " IRONBARK,”
and re-printed with amendments by the Author. :: ::
There’s a sort o’ rumour hummia*
Through the boomin’ of the guns
That the great Millennium’s cornin’
To regenerate the Huns.
There’s forecastin’ and foretellin’
Of a universal peace,
When all bay’nettin’ and shellin’
And explosiveness will cease.
All mankind will love their neighbours,
And their neighbours’ wives, while Huns
Will be makin’ picks and mattocks
From the metal of their guns,
And the Turks, with tears of penitence
A-runnnin’ down their cheeks,
(With the Bulgars) will be sobbin’
Oh the bosoms of the Greeks.
Then, I most forgot to mention,
We shall cease to fight like brutes
That a sort of Hague Convention,
Which will settle all disputes.
Will be formed among the nations
(When they’ve got the time to spare
From their war-like occupations)
With the Kaiser in the chair.
Kaiser Bill will swop his sabre
For a length of garden hose ;
Do a stunt of honest labor—
Say, plant cabbages in rows ;
While in some suburban garden,
Catchin’ snails and sowin’ seeds;
He’ll forget he’s Hohenzollern,
While he’s busy hoein weeds.
Crown Prince Willie, who was giddy—
Chased the “ tarts,” and played the fool—
Will instruct the London kiddy
In an East-end Sunday School.
While Von Tirpitz, with a bosom
Full of love instead of hate,
In a Non-conformist chapel
Will be handin’ round the plate.
It’s a most attractive vision,
And we can, without a doubt,
In our mind, with great precision,
See the scheme a workin’ out.
We can see the lion lyin’
Calm, a lickin’ of his hide,
Most benevolently sighin’—
With a lamb or two inside.
But, from what we know of Proosians,
We’d suggest it would be wise
If the British and the Roosians,
And each one of the Allies,
While a lookin’ sweet as candy,
Kept his faculties alert,
And a few explosives handy
In the bosom of his shirt.
Don’t forget the German Eagle
Is a bird of war and strife—
Not a dove of peace—though regal—
And remember, on yer life,
You should most mistrust that chicken,
And beware his beak and claws,
When an olive branch is slickin'
In his bloo.d-beslavered jaws.
Mind, we’re nuts upon Millenniums,
’Cos we hate all kinds of strife,
And we’d love to love our neighbour,
And especially his wife,
But our strong belief increases,
That, if Germans you’re to trust,
Not to break a peace in pieces,
YOU MUST DONKEY-LICK ’EM FUST !
—IRONBARK.
