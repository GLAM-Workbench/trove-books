The Haunted Grange
A True Ghost Story
(By ALFRED J. TAYLOR)
“Are you a believer in ghosts?” This
is a question that is usually answered
with a sneer of incredulity. And yet it
is not unscientific to believe in the ap-
pearances that go by the name of
“Ghosts.” This will be realised if we
get to understand thoroughly the fol-
lowing facts:
Everything that is tangible to us is
built up of particles, that are not
visible to us, and which are not touch-
ing each other. Each particle is sur-
rounded by an invisible medium much
finer than the finest gas that we know
of, and each of these particles may be
made to swing rapidly, or vibrate,
when anything disturbs the medium iu
which it is bathed.
Now, light itself is caused by the
rapid vibrations of this medium set up
by the disturbance of the particles of
the source from which they may
emanate. These vibrations, striking
upon an object more dense than them-
selves, more often than not rebound,
and may make an impression upon
some other object, the particles of
which are, in their turn, set in motion.
If that object should be the brain, the
disturbance is accompanied Dy a sen-
sation, and that sensation may take
the form of a color, or tjje form of the
object from which it has rebounded.
We see each other, for example, be
cause light vibrations beating upon us
rebound and create in the brain of an-
other the impression of the form they
have rebounded from. This is how we
get to realise the presence of each
other. In other words, this is how we
get to see (or feel) the presence of
each other.
It is quite certain that vibrations are
beating upon us from sourceg that we
are unconscious of, because we cannot
feel (and, therefore, do not see) them.
But we know of them because of the
chemical effects they produce—as
upon a photographic plate, for in-
stance.
Now, it may be that it is because of
the dullness of our nerve-responsive-
ness that many of us fail to feel vibra-
tions that are beating back from pre-
sences that are made visible to others
q{ finer (and. therefore, more sensi-
tive) nervous organisations than we
are possessed of; in which case
the latter may really see things
that we do not see. Therefore,
if anyone tells me that he has
seen a “spirit” or “ghost” I do
not ridicule him, because I know that
it is quite within the range of possi-
bility that he may be able to see
things that it is impossible for me to
see—for the reasons I nave mentioned.
But this is only the scientific side of
the question.. Let me get on to ray

in which I had become deeply interest-
ed. Gradually the soothing sounds of

From this sleep I was rudely
awakened by an angry bark from the
dog and the unmistakable slamming
together of the big gates, which I had
seen fastened securely with the rusty
iron chain and padlock.


When I was quite a lad, living In
the district of , in Tasmania, 1
had an experience which I am not
likely to forget.
Situated on the banks of a very
pretty rivulet which runs through the
township was an old house, which was
known as “The Haunted Grange,” and
which, on account of the uncanny
things that had been said about it, had
remained uninhabited for some years.
Moss had grown upon the chimney-
stacks, and parts of the walls were
green with fungi and damp mould.
The grounds were overgrown with
brambles and briars, and the timbers
were without paint or protection of
any kind from the effects of sunshine
or rain. The fence, an old iron one,
was rusty and neglected, but still
standing upon a stone foundation. The
large gates were fastened with a rusty
chain and padlock, and the rank
grasses and weeds had grown round
the bottom of them, rendering it im-
possible to open them, even if the
chain and lock had not been there to
hold them together.
I was always fond of trying to solve
mysteries of any kind, and one day it
entered into my mind to obtain some
solution of the mystery surrounding
the weird legends,about “The Haunted
Grange.” <
I took with me a small bnsket con-
taining food, —for I had made up. my
mind to remain all night, if necessary
—an interesting book, a. miniature rifle
(for what purpose I hardly realised),
and for company a large dog of the
staghound breed, with coarse grey hair
almost like bristles,
With some difficulty I managed to
get myself and the dog inside the en-
closure, and at once proceeded to make
an entrance to the Grange by the hack
door. This had slightly fallen at oin*
side, and I had some difficulty in forc-
ing my way in, the door 'serapln*,
heavily upon the floor as I pushed it
open.
Closing it carefully after me, I found
myself in a long passage, which led
me in the end, to another door opening
into a large room on the left hand side
of this passage.
This room, like the passage, had the
heavy, damp smell that characterises
all houses that have been closed up
for a long time. Near an open fire-
place stood a large deal table, and
there was one chair near it. The fur-
niture and the floor were covered with
dust, and had evidently not been
touched for some years.
T, swept some of this from the seat
and table, upon which I placed my rifle
and. refreshments, and then sat down
and looked around me. I had closed
the door, and I noticed that in one of
its panels there was a knot, and it
struck me that it was just about the
spot where a body would be if any-
one attempted to tamper with the lock
and open the door. Mechanically I
levelled the rifle at it, and mentally I
resolved that if any kind of trickery
were tried later on I would fire at this
spot, come what might happen.
My attention was next drawn to the
uneasy motions of the dog. It did not
seem to be able to find a resting place.
It moved about from spot to spot,
whining impatiently, and examining
every corner of the room with a look
something akin to fear upon its face.
At last it came to me, and placing
its muzzle upon my knees, looked up
into my face and made a piteous
whine, as if to say, “Come away from
this. I do not like it.” But meeting
with no response, it settled down at
my feet, and I turned to my book.
Outside it had commenced to rain,
and one could hear the dull murmur
of the swelling brook. A belated mope-
hawk settling upon the chimney-
stack. gave forth its boding cry
And then darkness settled round the
Grange. The old timbers of the house
gave forth complainings, and one could
hear noises that only seem to come to
one in the night-time.
After partaking of slight refresh-
ment, I turned once more to my book,
in which I had become deeply interest-
ed. Gradually the soothing sounds of
the falling rain and the rising stream
had the hypnotising effect of sending
me to sleep.
From this sleep I was rudely
awakened by an angry bark from the
dog and the unmistakable slamming
together of the big gates, which I had
seen fastened securely with the rusty
iron chain and padlock.


I rubbed my eyes and looked at my
watch. It was a minute past midnight,
so I must have slept for upwards of
an hour. As I returned my watch to
its pocket I heard another sound. It
was 'the sound of the back door being
pushed open, and making the same
scraping sound that it had made when
I entered, Then there followed the
tap-tap of footsteps coming up the
passage towards the room in which I
was sitting. Not the sound of foot-
steps covered with leather boots, not
even the sound of footsteps covered
with flesh. But the sharp, staccato
taps of something that seemed hard
and dry. Tap-tap, tap-tap, they struck
the floor with no uncertain sound. In-
voluntarily I lifted the gun from the
table and levelled it at the knot in
the panel, and as I saw the latch of
the door lift, just as involuntarily I
pulled the trigger. The knot disap-
peared.
And then I knew that something was
looking at me through the hole that 1
had made in the door.
'Rushing forward excitedly I braced
myself against the door, determined
that nothing human should force it
open. But the door was pushed open,
and I was swept back as if I had been
only a child.
Nothing entered; but I felt an icy
cold blast sweep across my face, as
something swept by me into the room.
On turning, my eyes caught sight of
the dog. Standing, facing me, with the
hair on its hide literally bristling, its

eyes almost resting upon its cheek-
bones, the moisture dropping from its
slavering mouth, and the most awful
look of terror upon its face it stood,
or, rather, rocked slowly upon its ex-
tended legs, and then suddenly, with
an agonising whine, rolled over—and I
could see that it was dead.
Then the same cold blast swept once
more across my face and the door fell
to again.
Outside in the passage there at once
commenced the sound of a scuffling, as
if the something that had left the room
was struggling with what had been the
dog. At first it seemed as if the dog,
or what had been the dog, was getting
the best of it; then I knew that the
something which had frightened it to
death was uppermost, and that the
dog was being slowly strangled.
After an interval there was a sudden
silence, broken by the sound of those
weird tap-taps, as of something walk-
ing down the passage. I opened the
door and looked out. There were no
wet marks on the boards, but I heard
the scraping of the back door as it
was opened and shut.
Then, just as I felt as if my brain
was on the point of bursting, I again
heard the slam of the great iron gates,
which I knew it was impossible for
human hands to open.
A feeling or unconsciousness was
stealing over me, when, with a hoarse
cry for help,—l awoke, and found that
I had nearly strangled myself with a
corner of the sheet.
