A doctor is a useful man.
Who does us all the good he can.
But DR. WAUGH now takes the cake,
With housewives who can cook and bake.
Would you know the reason why
DR. WAUGH is voted best ?
Then just his BAKING POWDER buy,

Talmage go in, ana they presently fell into
an argument. Finally Ingersoll said : “Then
you would like to live in a place, Brother
Talmage, where every one had to be good by
law?’’ “Certainly,” said Talmage, “You
would like to live where every one had to go
to church regularly every Sunday ? “Yes,
that would suit me.” “Where no man
could get a drink and swearing was not per-
mitted ?’* “Yes, that‘s the place for me.”
“And where every man would have to keep
regular hours ?” “That would be heaven on

Sometimes it ia a pleasure to, answer
questions, even if the questioner may put
them in an unpleasant way : “What do you
do for a living?” asked a lawyer, frowning
horribly at a hatchet-faced young man who
was undergoing cross-examination. “I, sir,”
answered the witness, hastily diving into his
eide-pocket, “am the agent for Dr. Korker’a

Mascagni has had a signal honor paid to
him by the German Emperor. He has de-
cided to have every year in Berlin a series
of concerts, directed bv the most celebrated
“ batons” in the world. The concerts will
begin in 1900, and among those chosen for
the first series is Mascagni. The Italian
composer’s hymn in honour of Admiral
Dewey and the victories of the American
nation, when performed at Pesaro for the
first time in the presence of two thousand
people, was declared to be oae of the best
things he has written.

Eloquent Words from a Wife who
Rescued Her Husband from a
Terrible Habit.
Secretly Gave Him a Remedy in His
Coffee, and He now Rejoices with Her.
Who can doubt that there is a cure
for Drunkenness when wfe have such an
eloquent and emphatic statement from
Mrs. Katie Lynch. She says:—“My
husband was a hard drinker. There
was never a doubt in my mind hut what
liquor had so worked upon his nerves as
to actually control his appetite. Like
most men who drink he was kind and
generous when sober, hut the rum
demon usually had the better of him,
and his wife had to suffer. One day I
concluded to try a remedy called
Eucrasy, which it was said would cure
the liquor habit secretly. So I mixed
some of it with Mr. Lynch’s food for a
few days, and put a little in his coffee.
I could scarely conceal my agitation lest
he should suspect me, for he had sud-
denly taken a dislike to liquor, said he
despised the stuff, and was the most
remarkably changed man you ever saw.
I kept bravely at it, determined to not
waver in my attempt to cure him, and I
soon found out that my mission was a
complete success, and that Eucrasy had
wrought almost a miracle for me. I
want other women to profit by my
example. ” ,
“Send your name and address to Mr
E. H. Norton, Manager, The Eucrasy

Mr. W. WEBBER. March 25th, 1896.
Dear Sir, During the first attack of my illness I was under medical treatment for about three
months. I then had a relapse, and was worse than in the former stage of my troubles. In this
state I was advised to try “Vitadatio,” which I was assured would drive my complaint out of
the system. lam now pleased to state that lam thoroughly restored to perfect health, as the
result of using two large bottles of “Vitadatio” and applying externally one bottle of Indian
Oil of Cream. (Signed) BENJ. TURNER.
READ THIS, AND THEN ACT QUICKLY.
Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in testifying to the merits of your “Vitadatio.” I was
suffering for some considerable time with lung and liver troubles, also rheumatism in my feet,
and was attended by two doctors without any good effect. I was recommended to try your
• “Vitadatio.” and after taking six large bottles am pleased to say that I am restored to perfect
health. You are at liberty to make what use you wish of this in the interests of fellow-
Buflferers. GEORGE POWLEY.

WORDS OF COMFORT FROM A WIDE-AWAKE MAN.
Launceston, Tasmania, 23/2/99.
MR. MORRIS, the Much-Travelled Agent, gives his opinion of Webber’s “Vitadatio” as
under—and at the same time hands us his photograph that there may be no mistake as to the
Gentlemen referred to. He says :—‘‘lt was while we were playing in Melbourne I first heard
of “ Vitadatio” through Mr. Palmer, the Agent, who assured mo he had been cured of Hydatis 1
and Bright’s disease of the kidneys of 14 years’ standing by the use of this great remedy. I
had been a great sufferer with Kidney and Liver Troubles, which gave me great inconvenience
in my calling, and tried very many medicines to effect a cure, but all were to of avail. I then
went in for a course of “Vitadatio” —and with such good results—it having cured me completely—
and I am again in splendid condition ; all the ill effects of my trouble have disappeared ; and
moreover, I cannot keep quiet on the subject. I gave “Vitadatio” my strongest recommend-
ation to all who complain of being any way ‘off.’ lam told that as a blood purifier “Vitadatio”
has no known equal, and I quite believe it.
Yours gratefully,
Agent Fitz'Gerald Bros.’ Huge Combined Shows. fJ. MORRIS
•‘HEALTH IS MORE THAN WEALTH.”—Mr. Morris is now in this colony. Write
and teat for yourself whether Vitadatio is what I claim for it.—S. A. PALMER.

To Mr. S. A. Palmer !sth July, 1898.
Dear Sir, —It is with much pleasure that I add my testimonial to the many others you have
received about your wonderful herbal remedy, “Vitadatio.” For nearly two years I have suf-
fered with an ERUPTION OF THE SKIN, and I have tried all sorts of medicines, without
avail. After much persuasion I resolved to try a course of your “Vitadatio,” and lam thankful
that I ever did so, tor the result has been beyond my expectations. My friends cannot fail to
notice the change that has taken place in my skin. Hoping that others may benefit by this.
