COLOUR
IN THE HOME
WE are all subject to the influence of environ-
ment, and if the sphere of our daily work can
be made attractive and congenial, such work
will undoubtedly be better done and in a happier
mood. No one realises this more than the house-
wife, and all modern architects are awake, to the
necessity of getting away from the dull and unin-
teresting dwelling, particularly that part in which the
housewife is compelled to spend so large a proportion
of her time, viz., the kitchen.
To help on the good work of brightening life, a
demand has arisen for “ colours ” as against the old
drab and white..
The colour scheme should be restful and pleasing to
the sense of artistic beauty, and the dullness of the
old-time kitchen avoided. To bring the kitchen into
line with the modern idea and combining decoration
with efficiency, Metters Limited now present their
famous “ Early Kooka ” Series of Gas Stoves in
various colour combinations in “Mottled Enamel’’ and
“All Porcelain Enamel” Finishes. These colours have
been carefully selected, and are of the correct depth
of tone to blend with any decorative scheme.
In order to appreciate the attractiveness and utility
of these new lines, we invite you to call and inspect
the display at our Showrooms, 154-8 Elizabeth Street,
Sydney, where , fully equipped up-to-date kitchens are
installed, illustrating how character and good taste
can be combined at a very reasonable cost.

NEW COLOURED MOTTLED ENAMEL
FINISHES
In delicate shades of Blue, Green, Brown and Grey.
No. 27 “EARLY KOOKA” IN BLUE MOTTLED ENAMEL.
Illustration shows the new coloured mottled enamel finish which
can be supplied on any of our Gas Cookers. It has a pleasing effect
that will tone with any surroundings. It will not chip or craze with
the heat, and is practically everlasting. A rub with a damp cloth keeps
spotlessly clean. 1
When ordering distinctly state colour required.
EFFICIENT INSULATION
Metters’ Gas Cookers have very heavily insulated Ovens, including
Doors and top of Oven. Particular attention has been given to this
very important feature, to ensure that the special Silicate packing is
well bedded, so that no empty spaces will develop when the stove is
placed in service. Your attention is specially drawn to the thickness
of this insulation, which is one of the main reasons for the wonderful
cooking properties of METTERS’ GAS COOKERS.

CUT AWAY VIEW OF THE
“RETAINED HEAT” OVEN
PATENTED No. 11348/28.
FITTED TO ALL “EARLY KOOKA” RANGES.
Our ‘'Retained Heat” Paten-
ted Gas Oven embodies an
entirely new principle in its
operation, . and is different
from all other ovens fitted
to gas stoves. There is no
baching up of the products
of combustion, the fumes
travelling- their natural course,
ascending' all the time.
Stove cut away to show construction of
Retained Heat Oven.
They are given a longer distance to travel, and pass between baffle plates,
which absorb the heat that would otherwise go up the flue pipe, and transfers it to
the oven top, which acts as a deflector plate and radiates the heat back into the
oven. As well as the above process taking place, the heated air is retarded in its
progress through the oven; therefore, doing its full amount of work before reaching
the outlet.
METTERS’ RETAINED HEAT OVEN, in conjunction with their
already famous “ EFFICIENCY BOILING BURNERS, make a
most economical Gas Stove, reducing gas consumption to the
absolute minimum.

The correct method of cooking food is to pre-heat the oven to a certain tem-

attained, place food in oven and lower the temperature to the required degree to
thoroughly cook the food right through without burning.
The Oven Heat Controller automatically maintains this desired heat without

This Oven is similar in all
respects to the Oven of
“Triumph” Range on Page

tion is necessary.
