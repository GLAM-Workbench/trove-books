NOTICE.
It may excite surprise in this division of the world that a
writer, whose life for upwards of a quarter of a century
lias been devoted entirely to secular pursuits, and the
stormiest scenes of politics, should now, for a moment,
devote himself to tranquil religions th�mes; but it is
matter of notoriety in the Northern Hemisphere, in the
West as well as the East, that having?merely for writing
a few verses (construed as libellons) of the publication of
which lie was wholly innocent, on a Scottish Baronet,
who chanced to be a grand-nephew of the late Duke of
Wellington as well as the pr�sent author?s by marriage?
being sentenced to the atrocious punishment of two
years? imprisonment with hard labor, and silent or soli-
tary confinement, he had, during the whole of that long
interval, little other means of mental employment than
a Metrical Version of the Scriptures. About a third of
the Old Testament books, as well as the New, were thus
translated by him ; and these, with a few other volumes
enumerated in the appeuded advertisement, he is now
ready to publish here, should the inhabitants of the Aus-
tralian colonies feel inclined to encourage such literary
enterprise.
Were it not for the sanctity of the subject he might be
disposed to gratify natural public curiosity, by explaining
that he was subjected to this unprecedented punish-
ment, mainly through the perjury of a renegade Jew,
named, ? The Kight Honorable Benjamin Disraeli t ?whose
contempt for truth is proverbial in the new world not
less than in the old, and who attempted to swear the
honor ot a gallant East Indian officer, Colonel Eathborne,
and more recently the safety of the illustrious Italian
patriot Mazzini, as lie swore two years of the life of the
pr�sent writer away ; and that lie was in the instance of


The author enabled to do this with en tire impunity,
inasmuch as the writer was obnoxious to the existing
Government of England, for having, as a member of the
Queen?s household, in the melancholy affair of Lady Flora
Hastings, refused to assist in hurrying to the grave a
lady who had no protection but her innocence. Ail
ttufse matters will necessarily be one day developed,
though they cannot be further alluded to now, than only
to remark that their perpetrators revel in pr�sent impu-
nity ; although, as the late Prince Metternich remarked,
that ? the British Aristocracy haveyetan accountto settle
with the People of England,? it may be inferred that
such conduct will accelerate the approach of the reckon-
ing-day. *
* Lest it should be surmised that the writer is indnlging in undue
asperity, he subjoins two extracts ?one from a Melbourne journal,
the Argus, another from a speech of the great Irish orator, O?Connell,
whom this Apostate, after attempting to enter Parliament as a
radical ? or republican member under his auspices, also deceived,
and afterwards vituperated, as he has deceived and vituperated every
manwhoevertrusted bim?in proof that the Political Hermaphrodite?s
baseness �s known in this distant r�gion, as it was known in Europe
thirty -five years ago.
? The famous revolutionary epic of Mr, Benjamin Disraeli?s youth-
ful and radical �ge has,? says the Argus, ? shared the fashionable
honours of the day, in a republication. Readers unacquainted with
that work will, however, hardly be able to gather a full notion of the
original effort of the Conservative statesman?s revolutionary muse,
for Mr. Disraeli has made not a few of what he calls ? purely literary
corrections,? but which the London Review magnifies into substantial
alt�rations, justifying the charge of dishonesty by illustrations. In
1864 he writes?
* Hallowed be
The regicidal Steel that shall redeem
A nation?s woe ? ??
On which the Review remarks :? * Instead of the sentence above
quoted, hallowing the regicidal Steel which simply redeems a nation?s
woe, that passage of the original poem ran thus :
? And hlessed be the hand that dares to wave
The regicidal Steel that shall redeem
A nation?s sorrow with a tyrant?s hlood.?
This cannot be understood of the judicial ex�cution of a criminal
king, There is another passage which Mr. Disraeli has chosen to
alter in the pr�sent �dition, whilst he d�clar�s that his corrections


The author may add, that such a version of the Scrip-
ture as that specimen he now pr�sents?and he will
engage to compl�t� the whole in two years, if consistent
with the public desire?might supersede a desideratum
or g�n�ral wish which has long existed extensively for a
new translation of the Bible. In the existing version of
tins, many passages occur which are deemed objectionable
by Protestants, as well as Catholics ; but they cannot be
rendered in modem language without being made still
more offensive, nor omitted without incurring the charge
of ? mutilating the Scriptures.? In a poetical version,
are 'purely literary,? and that they do not affect the evidence regarding
his former advocacy of political assassination, In the original poem
he said, when speaking of Rome?
? The boM Brutus but propelled tbe blow
Her own and nature?s laws alike approved.?
Yery good ; that was what Mr. Disraeli wrote in 1834. In 18C4, Mr.
Disraeli has changed it into this?still speaking of Rome?
? Tbe blow bold Brutus struok, ber fate.?
And these, he assures us, are ? purely literary corrections.? ? ?
Daniel O?Counell is?and justly?far more severe on the regicidal
hypocrite.
?At Taunton ? he says, in the course of a public speech, ? this
miscreant had the audacity to style me an incendiary, Why, I was
a greater incendiary in 1831 than I am at pr�sent, if ever I were
one?(laughter)?and if I am, he is doubly so for having employed
me. (Cheers and laughter.) Then he calls me a traiter. My answer
to that is?he is a liar. (Cheers.) He is a liar in actions and in words.
His life is a living lie. He is a disgr�ce to his species. What state
of society must that be that can tolerate such a cr�ature?having
the audacity to corne forward with one set of principles at one time,
and obtain political assistance by reason of those principles, and at
another to profess diametrically the reverse ? His life, I say again,
is a living lie. He is the most degraded of his species andTdnd ; and
England is degraded in tolerating, or having upon the face of her
society, a miscreant of his abominable, foui, and atrocious nature.
(Cheers.) My language is harsh, and I owe an apology for it, but I
will tell you why I owe that apology. It is for this reason, that if
there be harsher words in the British language, I should use them,
because it is the harshest of ail terms that would be descriptive of a
wretch of this species. (Cheers and laughter.) He is just the fellow


however, they might be modified by what is termed tbe
? license ? allowed to verse ; and tbe author points to
those parts of the ? Sermon on tbe Mount, alluding to
infringements of tbe seventh commandment as evidence
of tbe mode in which he purposes to accomplish this. A
few shorter passages, from tbe Old Testament as well as
the New, are added as proof of the manner in which the
whole will be accomplished.
The author will only in conclusion State that he shall
by no means regret the brutal imprisonment and homi-
for the Conservative Club. I suppose if Sir Robert Peel had been
out of tbe way wben he was called upon to take office, this fellow
would h�ve undertaken to supply his place. He bas falsehood enough,
depravity enough, and selfishness enough to become the fitting leader
of the Conservatives. He is Conservatism personified. His name
shows him by descent a Jew. His father became a couvert. He is
better for that in this world ; I hope, of course, he will be the better
for it in the next. There is a habit of underrating that great and
oppressed nation?the Jews. They are cruelly persecutedby persons
calling themselves Christians ; but no person ever yet was a. Christian
who persecuted. The cruellest pers�cution they suffer is upon their
character, by the foui names which their calumniators bestowed
upon them before they carried their atrocities into effect. They feel
the pers�cution of calumny severer upon them than the pers�cution
of actual force, and the tyranny of actual torture. I h�ve the happi-
ness to be acquaiuted with sonie Jewish familles in Londou, and
amongst them more accomplished ladies, or more humane, cordial,
high-minded, or better-educated gentlemen, (sic,) I h�ve never met.
(Hear, hear.) It will not be supposed, therefore, when I speak of
Disraeli as the descendant of a Jew, that I mean to tarnish him on
that account. They were once the chosen people of God. There
were miscreants amongst them, also, and it must h�ve certainly been
from one of those that Disraeli descended. (Roars of laughter.)
He possesses just the qualities of the impudent thief who died upon
the cross, whose name, I verily believe, must bave been Disraeli.
(Roars of laughter.) For aught I know, the pr�sent Disraeli is des-
cended from him ; and with the impression that he is, I now forgive
the heir-at-law of the blasphemous thief who died upon the cross.?
(Loud cheers, mingled with laughter.) ??? Disraeli, the Author, Orator,
and Statesman,? by John Mill, Darton and Hodge, Loudon, 1864.
The author will merely add, that this miscreant expects shortly
again to enter upon power. If he do so, half the British Colonies
will probably rise in r�bellion.


cidal tortures to which he was subjected, if he be thus
instrumental in tbe further extension of a Book which,
though virtually denounced by the Lord Chancelier of
England as uninspired, must be admitted, even by such
scoffers as the House of Lords, and especially the Bishop
of London, thus proved themselves to be, to contain so
much of human wisdom, and so little of human folly.
Melbourne, August, 1864.




A METRICAL VERSION
OF THE
SERMON ON THE MOUNT
St. Matthew, Chapteh V.
Then J�sus, opening his mouth, to them said ?
Blessed are those tliat are poor,
For abundance in heaven shall round them be spread
And it shall for ever endure.
Blessed are they who now sorrow and mourn,
For they shall at last be consol?d ;
Blessed are those who are meek, though forlorn,
For they here dominion shall hold.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
For the great cause that ?s upright ;
Blessed are those who show mercy first,
For mercy on them shall alight.
Blessed are those who pure are in heart,
For they the Lord God shall see ;
Blessed are those who from peace ne?er d�part,
For they His children shall be.
Blessed are those whom men now pursue,
And harrass for righteousness? sake ;
For the kingdom of heaven their strength shall renew ;
Of its blessings and glory they shall partake.


Blessed are ye when men you revile,
And pers�cute too for My sake ;
Wlien they say you are evil, when tliey say you are vile
The Almighty on high will not you forsake.
Rejoice?let your hearts then leap for joy,
A rich reward to you shall be given ;
For so did the wicked the prophets annoy,
And you shall be rewarded in heaven.
You are the savour and sait of the earth ;
If that sait or savour he lost,
How shall its vigour receive again birth ?
Shall it not be contemptuously toss?d
Under the feet, from the presence of men,
Ne ver to show that vigour again ?
You are the light exalted on high :
A city which rears its head to the sky
Cannot be hid ; when built on a hill,
Proudly its turrets it raises up still.
When a candie is lit ?mid the darkness of night,
Men do not then extinguish its light
By placing a bushel or shade on the wall,
But provide that its brightness be seen shall by ail.
Then let your light so shine before men,
That they may witness its splendour again ;
And that thanks from the heart by them may be given
To our Omnipotent Father in heaven.
Think not that I am corne to destroy
The law or the prophets, or with vain thoughts annoy
Those that are here ; I am corne to fulfil
My Father?s behests and accomplish His will.


For verily I say now unto you,
Till chaos again its reign shall renew,
Till heaven and earth shall both pass away,
Not a tittle shall pass of what I now say :
AU shall be donc ; whoever shall break
The smallest commandment that I now make,
Or what I h�ve taught, what I bave proclaimed,
Shall least in the kingdom of heaven be named.
But whoso shall teach, or do what I do,
On bis head I will pour ont hlessings anew ;
And lie shall in heaven hail?d be as great,
When on earth he lias accomplished bis fate.
For I say unto you, that unless ye surpass
The righteousness Scribes and Pharisees show
To the kingdom of heaven you never shall pass,
But on earth and in hell shall be laid low.
Of old it was said, ? Thou shalt not kiU,
For that is a breach of our great Father?s will ;
Whoso shall kiU shall before men be led,
And death will then imperil bis head.?
But I say to you, Whoever lias ire
Against bis brother ?s in danger of tire ;
Whoe?er without cause shall bis brother detest
Shall not in safety from danger now rest.
Whoever shall say to him ? racca ? again
For tins shall be cited to answer to men ;
And whoe?er that he?s ? fool ? a brother shall tell
In p�ril shall be of the tierce fi�mes of hell.
If thou to the altar bringest thy gift,
And remember thy brother is angry with thee,


Do not from it yonr offering uplift
Until with him you reconciled be :
Then corne and offer your gift to the Lord,
And pleasure to Him it thus will afford.
Agr�� witli thine enemy while in the way,
Lest with force o?erwhelming lie thee waylay,
And cause thee before a judge to be led,
Who disasters anew shall heap on thy head ;
And force thee in prison straightway to be cast,
Whence, I tell you, that till the last
Farthing that?s due to thy foe thou shalt pay
Thou shalt not h�ve leave to pass more away.
You h�ve heard, and of old your fathers said it,
? Thou shalt not in act adultery commit ; ?
But, I tell you, whoever shall look
On woman with lewdness, God will not brook ;
But will reckon that man adult�rer in heart,
And from His wrath lie shall not d�part.
If thy right eye offend thee, do thou pluck it out,
And far from thy presence cast it without ;
For ?tis better that one of thy organs expire
Than that ail be consigned to hell?s burning lire.
If thy right hand offend thee, then eut it of�,
From that which is left thou?lt h�ve service enough
That one member perish?is it not well,
Kather than ail be yielded to hell ?
It is said, ? Whoe?er his wife puts away,
Let him give lier a bill, that aloof she may stay ; ?
But I say, whoe?er from lier shall part
Without cause, already hath sinned in his heart :


And sinning, lie causetli her also to sin,
For tlms it is that evils begin ;
And he who weds lier that is put away
From the precept of God alike goes astray.
Again, ye bave heard it was said of old,
? Thon slialt not thyself forswear,
But submissive to God thy lips thou slialt hold,
And in ail to Him reverence bear : ?
But I say to you, swear not at ail ;
Neither by heaven, for God?s throne it is ;
Nor by earth, for His footsteps on it now fall;
Nor by Sion, for His city ?tis ;
He is its King ; nor swear by thy head,
Because not a liair canst thou make
Of ail that there in profusion are spread,
A dark or light hue to take.
Let your oath be ?yea, yea,? or as may be, ? nay,nay,?
For whatsoe?er more is, is evil;
False oaths from God do not find their way,
They emanate but from the devil.
You likewise h�ve heard that it hath been said,
? A tooth for a tooth, and an eye for an eye ; ?
But I say, when smote on one side of the head,
To be smote on the other also, draw nigh.
If any man shall pursue you at law,
And your coat away take from you,
Do you of that man and his law stand in awe,
And your cloak let him h�ve too.
If a man shall a mile compel you to go,
Do not forget to go twain ;


Give or lend to tlie poor, the needy, and low,
And ask not from them again. .
You h�ve heard it is said, ? Thy neighbour love,
Thine enemies thon shalt detest ; ?
But I say, in His naine who reigneth above,
Let not sucb evil enter your breast.
Your enemies love, bless tbem tbat curse you,
Do good to them who you h�te ;
Pray for those who reproaches renew,
And to do you evil await :
Tbat ye may be the cbildren of God,
Of Him who reigns in the skies,
Of Him who in heaven batb His abode,
And guardetb alike the simple and wise :
Of Him who causetb the sun and the rain
To rise and to fall on the just and unjust ;
On Him who bas ruled and will rule tbem again,
Let the good and the evil alike put their trust.
For if ye love tbem tbat only love you,
Wbat reward can ye daim ?
Do not sinners also their love tbus renew ?
Do not publicans too do the same ?
If ye only your brethren salute,
Wbat do ye tbat others don?t do ?
Wby from sucb deeds expect to reap fruit,
Do not sinners do tbem so too ?
But be ye perfect, and perfect remain,
While on eartb it is your lot to endure ;
Be ye pure, and your pureness retain,
As your Fatber in heaven is perfect and pure.


S�. Matthew, Chapter VI.
Let not jour alms be seen before men,
Tliat they thus may redound to your profit again ;
Otherwise yon sball bave no reward
From your Father in lieaven, who o?er them keeps gnard.
When you the wants of the poor would relieve,
Do not, as tbe hypocrites do,
Your alms so bestow tliat you may re�oive
Fraises from men heaped upon you :
Against such parade be on your guard,
For truly, I say, it sball bave its reward.
But, when you give alms, let not your left band
Know wbat is doue by your rigbt ;
Your Fatber in lieaven will tbis understand,
And you sball find gr�ce in His sigbt :
An open reward He will tben heap upon
Your head, for wbat you in secret bave done.
Wben you pray, do not, as hypocrites, pray
In tbe streets, tliat tbey by men may be seen ;
Do not your prayers in synagogues say,
Let a wide diff�rence be you between :
Against sucb parade be on your guard,
For truly, I say, it sball bave its reward.
Do ye, wben ye pray, to your own cbamber go,
And, wben fast sbut is tbe door,
Cause your Fatber in secret your wisbes to know,
And He will give beed to you more


Than if you in public had openly prayed,
Or your vows, in presence of men, to Him paid.
And, when you pray, repeat not in vain,
As heathens do, when their wants they express,
For they think they?ll be heard if they loudly complain,
And thus before men proclaim their distress :
Be not like them ; for your Father takes heed,
Before you ask Him, of what you h�ve need : [high]
Let this be your prayer, when you raise your thoughts
To the Great Being who reigns in the sky :
? To Thee, our Father who rulest in heaven,
Eternal praise and glory be given ;
May Thy kingdom corne, may we find it at home,
May we find it abroad, and wherever we roam :
? May Thy will by mankind be done upon earth,
As it is in those r�gions where angels h�ve birth ;
Give us each day ad�quate food,
And let Thy blessings to us be renewed :
? Forgive us our debts, as we those forgive
With whom, as foes, it is our lot to live ;
And let not temptation around us be spread,
But ward of� the evil that threatens our head :
For Thine are the kingdom, the glory, and pow?r,
For ever and ever, till time?s dying hour.?
For if ye to men the evils forgive
Which they h�ve done unto you,
In peace with your Father in heaven you?ll live,
And He will you pardon anew.
But if to forgive those sins you refuse
Which mankind to you h�ve done,


How much more will He, whose love you* abuse
By the evil career you bave run ?
Moreover, when to fast you?re inclin?d,
Be not, as hypocrites, sad,
And disfigure your faces, men to remind
That some dire woe you bave had :
Against such bypocrisy be on your guard,
For again I say it sball bave its reward.
Do ye, wben you fast, put oil on your bead,
And to men appear not to fast ;
Wash your face, and God around you will shed
Joy whicb always sball last :
j�eeing in secret, your fervour Hell see,
And openly you rewarded sball be.
Lay not your treasures up upon earth,
Wbere moth and rust will destroy ;
Wbere men wbo are tbieves, or evil from birtb,
Can break through, steal, and annoy :
But lay for yourselves up treasures in heaven,
Wbere ail you desire by God sball be given ;
Wbere neitber moth nor rust can corrupt,
Nor tbieves approacb with footsteps abrupt ;
For, wbere is your treasure, your beart too will be,
And you from its cares will never be free.
The ligbt of the body dwells in tbe eye ;
And, if tbis be pure, ail you see in the sky,
Or around you, will be refulgent witb ligjit ;
If impure, you?ll be plunged in the darkness of nigbt :
And wben abysmal darkness you see,
How great and profound tbat darkness will be !


No man on eartli two masters can serve,
For one lie will h�te, the other he?ll love ;
The one may be prudent, the other unwise,
The one lie may value, the other despise :
For Mammon, therefore, you cannot reserve
Your love, and for Him who reigneth ahove.
Therefore I say now, and d�clar�,
Do not for life retain any care ;
Of tliings that are carnal heed hot ; nor think
What ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink :
Neither for body raiment provide,
But in the faith of the Lord God abide :
Is not life more than raiment, the body than food ?
Then trust in the Lord amid evil and good.
The fowls of the air?how hrightly they go !
They reap not, they plant not, they hoard not, nor sow ;
Yet your Father ahove feeds them as they stray;
And are you not more precious than they ?
Which of you, though lie long calculate,
Can a cubit or span add to bis height ?
Why think of raiment ? the lilies survey ;
And are you not much better than they ?
They toil not, they spin not, yet grow in the field,
And still beauty show, still beauty yield ;
And I tell you that Solomon, ?mid ail his power,
Was not so resplendent as that humble flower.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass,
Which to-day is, to-morrow is not ;
Why will He not His goodness amass
Around you, though small faith you h�ve got ?


Tlierefore say not, ? What shall we eat,
Or liow shall we drink, or our raiment compl�t� ?
For after these things the Gentiles aspire,
And they thus the Lord aronse in His ire :
Your Father knoweth ail you can need,
And He of your wants will not fail to take heed.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God,
And the righteousness there that hath its abode ;
And ail these things shall be added to you :
He will guide, He will guard, He will cherish you too.
Take no thought what a day may bring forth,
What it may yield, or what it be worth ;
Heed not to-morrow : mind but to-day ;
Sufficient ?s the evil that ?s found in its way.
St. Matthew, Chapter VII.
Condemn not, lest by men ye?re condemned ;
Let not justice by you be contemned :
For, whatever judgement to others ye mete,?
You from your Heavenly Father shall meet.
Why wilt thou see in thy brother?s eye
A mote, and heed not thine own,
Where a beam may be seen, obscuring the sky
Till vision from thee completely bas flown ?


And wliy wilt tliou to tliat brother say,
? Let me pluck the mote from tliine eye : ?
Why tliy conceit not rather allay,
By pulling the beam there standing bigh ?
Hypocrite ! first cast ont the beam
Winch must thy vision obscure ;
And the light on thine own may then chance to gleam,
So that thou may?st remove it secure.
Give not that which is holy to dogs,
Neither your pearls cast before hogs ;
Lest, turning, they trample you under their feet,
And rend you for the kindness they meet.
Ask, and what you ask shall be given ;
Seek, and you will get it from heaven :
Knock, and the door to you shall be ope?d ;
It is not in vain you h�ve worked or h�ve hoped.
Where is the man whose son asking bread,
A stone would attempt to give him instead ?
Or, asking a fish, that he may live,
Where is he who a serpent would give ?
If ye then, being evil, know how to give
Gifts to your children, or their wants relieve,
How much more shall He who reigneth above
Give good things to those who ask Him in love ?
W T hatsoe?er you would h�ve men do to you,
Do ye even so unto men ;
For such is the law, and the old prophets too
H�ve proclaimed it again and again.
Enter ye at the g�te winch is strait,
For wide is the g�te and broad is the way


Of those who on destruction await,
And many are they that there go astray.
But strait is the g�te, and narrow the way,
That leadeth to life ; and few there will lay
Their head or their steps, when heaven they?d find :
Let those who hear me bear this in mind.
Beware of false prophets, and those who raay corne
Clad in sheep?s clothes to entice you from home ;
For ravenous wolves they inwardly are,
Though outwardly mild and meek they appear :
By their fruits ye shall know them ; men do not gather
Figs from a thistle, or grapes from a thorn ;
Good fruit and evil can not grow together,
And good fruit can not by a had tree be borne.
A good tree cannot bad fruit produce,
And a bad yieldeth what you should refuse :
Every bad tree must be eut down,
Splintered, and then into lire thrown
By their fruits ye shall know them ail, everywhere :
Not to ail who to me may d�clar�
Their zeal, or ? Lord ? cry, shall it be given
To enter my Father?s kingdom of heaven :
But he who the will of my Father shall do
Shall there find my love burning anew.
In that day, many to me will exclaim,
? Lord, h�ve we not prophesied in Thy naine ?
H�ve we not by Thee devils out cast ?
H�ve we not doue what, as wonders, will last ? ?
But unheeded, I tell you, they ail shall remain :
I will not workers of evil retain ;


? Quit me,? l?il say, ? from me d�part ;
Ye?re strangers to me, but I know your heart.?
Whoso shall hear these sayings of mine,
And also to do them liis heart shall incline,
l?il compare to a wise man who built on a rock
A house that should stand the tempest?s fierce shock
And the rains came, and the winds blew,
The floods too descended with fury anew ;
And ail on it beat ; but it stood well the shock,
For it was firmly based on a rock.
Who heareth my words and doeth them not,
Or who, when he?s heard, them hath forgot,
111 compare to that foolish man in the land
Who attempted to found his house upon sand :
The torrents descended, the floods fiercely came
And ail might then his folly proclaim :
For, so soon as the tempest blew on the wall,
His house straightway fell, and great was its fall.
THE ISRAELITES? SONO. *
Now will I raise my voice to the Lord,
For glorious in triumph lias been His sword ;
Triumphant and glorious, powerful is He,
The horse and his rider are cast in the sea.
The Lord is our strength, and the source of our song;
He is our safety ; our days He ?ll prolong :
He is our God ; we will raise Him a house ;
The God of our sires, who our praise shall arouse.
Exodus, Chapter xv., Verse I?2o.


The Lord is His name, a warrior is lie ;
The chariots of Pharaoh are cast in the sea ;
His hosts and his captains are hoth overthrown,
To the depths of the sea by Him they?re cast down.
The depths h�ve them covered ; they sank as a stone ;
Glorious in power is our God alone :
His foes h�ve heen dashed down by His hand,
The strength of His arm none can withstand :
By its strength His foes struck down He hath ;
Like stubble, they?ve heen consumed by His wrath :
The blast of His nostrils made water leap,
And the flobds of the sea arise in the deep.
His enemy exclaimed, ? I will pursue,
With my swift-flying chariots 111 capture you ;
My lust shall be sated; the spoils l?il divide,
By the strength of my sword you shall ail be destroyed.?
But He smote them with the blast of His wind,
And not one of ail was then left behind :
The sea dashed upon them ; beneath it they sleep ;
Engulphed there, they sank like lead in the deep.
Who is like Thee, the nations among,
Are other gods so resplendent in song ?
Who, like Thee, is holy and fearful in praise,
Who, like Thee, in power great works can raise ?
Thou stretched?st Thy right hand, and waves swallowed
Who vauntingly threatened on us to fall ; [ail
Thou led?st forth the people whom Thou hast redeemed,
And Thou hast them guided as good to Thee seemed.


To Thy house hast Thon hronght them ; the nations
Of Thy holy name, and stand too in fear ; [shall hear
Sorrow on Palestine?s sons shall seize hold,
And the Edomite dukes shall tremble, thongh hold.
The great men of Moah shall quake too with fear,
The people of Canaan shall ail disappear ;
Fear and dismay upon them shall fall,
Beneath Thy arm sink shall they ail.
Let them remain, still as a stone,
Till Thy people pass in safety alone ?
That people who by Thee h�ve been bought?
That people who here by Thee h�ve been brought
That people whom Thon shalt lead on, and plant
In the midst of the mountains, where they shall not want
To that place which for them Thon hast design?d,
To that place which holy is made by Thy mind.
For ever and ever the Lord God shall reign,
Who the horses of Pharaoh o?erthrew on the plain ;
Who sank his chariots too in the sea :
A mighty, puissant, Lord God is He :
For the children of Isra�l stood on the sand,
And safely beheld Him Pharaoh thus strand ;
In the midst of the land they stood safe and free,
While the forces of Egypt sank in the sea.


JEPHTHA?S VOW. *
The spirit of God on Jephtha then came,
As over Gilead he strode ;
Determined there to establish his fam�,
And the Ammonites smite with his rod.
And he said, in a vow offered up to the Lord,
? If Thon wilt cause, without fail,
The children of Ammon to yield to my sword,
And that I shall o?er them prevail,
Then it shall be, whoever me meets
First, when to my house I return,
Whoever first as victor me greets,
On Thy altar I vow I will burn.?
So Jephtha passed to the Ammonite land,
Their forces in battle to fight ;
And the Lord delivered them into his hand,
And caused him their armies to smite.
Twenty cities by him were laid waste,
And he slew ail he found on the plain ;
And this, having done, the warrior in haste
Eeturned homeward again.
But as he approached his house at Mizpay,
His only daughter came out
To meet him with songs and joy by the way,
And in rapture she caroled about.
� Judges, Chapter xi., Verse 29?40.


Slie was liis dear and sole beloved cbild,
Besides lier, he others had none ;
And, when lie beheld lier, with grief lie grew wild,
To think tbat bis pleasure for ever had flown.
Rending bis clothes, he cried ont, ? Alas !
My daugbter, why comest thon now ?
For from wbat I bave said I cannot pass,
As to tbe Lord l?ve recorded my vow.?
His daugbter, wben told, said, ? Father if thon
Tbus bave pledged tbyself to tbe Lord ;
Do as thon hast said in tby vow,
Tbough I myself should fall by tby sword ;
And as by His favour thon hast prevailed
Over tbe Ammonite land,
Let me too by tby brand be assailed,
Let me also fall by tby hand ;
Yet give me two brief montbs to go up
And on tbe mountains wander alone ;
And tben to tbe last 111 drink of tbe cup,
When those two montbs bave over me gone.?
Jepbtba said, ? Go ; ? and he sent ber away,
And for two montbs sbe wandered o?er
Mountain and glade, but during ber stay
Never ber fate was beard to d�plor�.
And when tbat period o?er ber bad flowed,
Tbe virgin to ber father returned,
Wbo sacrificed ber as be bad vowed,
Her body on tbe altar being burned.


The daughters of Isra�l in grief forth then went,
The virgin?s fate to d�plor� ;
And, four days a year, still londly lament
That Jephtha?s daughter now is no more.
THE MATRON?S SONO. *
The Lord in His mercy hath looked down on me,
He has given me proof of His gr�ce ;
A reproach among men no longer l?il be,
His love will the stigma efface.
Hail, Mary, now ! Hail, Mary, hail !
Blessed art thon upon earth ;
Blessed art thon among ail who travail,
And He who from thee shall draw birth !
Blessed art thon beyond ail below,
Blessed?s the fruit of thy womb :
Blessings from thee on manldnd shall flow ;
He them shall save from their doom.
How is it now that you to me corne,
You, the source of my Lord ?
I know it ?I feel that my joy you?ve become,
For, soon as I heard thy lov?d word ?
Soon as thy sweet voice fell on my ear,
The infant leapt in my womb :
With joy he again leaps, now you are here
To bless and to beam o?er my home.
* St. Luke, Chapter i., Verses 25, 40?45.


For blessed is she who humbly believes
The words tbat are told lier from lieaven :
Blessed is she who with faith re�oives
The promise its angel lias given.
THE YIEGIN?S SONG.*
Then Mary exclaimed ; Oh, great is the Lord !
My so�l extolleth His name :
My mind is ravish?d with joy by His Word ;
My Saviour puts me in flame,
Because He lias kindly looked on my lot,
My lot so poor and oppress?d :
But henceforth, forever, on earth there is not
A nation but shall call me Bless?d.
For the Lord God on high lias done much for me,
And Holy is named by us here :
From �ge unto �ge His mercy shall be
Extended to those who Him fear.
He shown lias the force that exists in His arm,
And dispersed the designs of the proud ;
The mighty has struck from their thrones in alarm,
And the humble raised from the crowd ;
With His bounty hath nourished the breasts of the poor,
And the rich sent empty away :
On Isra�l He now ail blessings will pour,
And in pity its griefs will allay.
* St. Luke, Chapter i., Verses 46?55.


Tlien praised be the Lord, who to Abram bas shown
This resplendent proof of His love ;
Nor to Abram and his descendants alone,
But to ail who revere Him above.
THE MISSION. *
I corne, I corne in the naine of the Lord,
I h�ve corne, I h�ve corne as a tierce flashing sword,
I am corne to.scatter fi�mes upon earth,
And to disasters dire to give birth.
I h�ve corne to baptize you with wrath and with tire ;
What woe shall I tind when l?ve had my desire !
Do ye think that on earth I h�ve corne to give peace ?
No ! discord with me never shall cease.
I h�ve corne to raise tierce strife in each house,
And the tiercest of passions in men to arouse ;
In each house I will raise two against three,
And three against two wherever they be.
ni raise up the sire in strife with the son,
And the son with the sire, ere his race shall be run ;
The daughter l?il arm against her sire?s wife,
And the mother make seek her own daughter?s life.
The step-dame l?il raise against daughter-in-law,
And she of the other shall stand too in awe ;
111 scatter around h�te, vengeance, and woe,
And death to mankind, wherever I go.
? St. Luke, Chapter xii., Verse 49?53.

some time ago, but the whole materials for which were seized during
his incarc�ration, and either scattered to the winds, or reserved to be
afterwards palmed upon the public by Mr. Benjamin Disraeli as his
own, with the same effrontery as he plundered Thiers, and plagiarised
Macaulay.
OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
On MR. JOBSON?S ? HISTORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION,? &c.
FIRST EDITION.
? Nothing can be more imposing than the pictures he pr�sents of
The gigantic scenes of the period.?? Athen?um, 1841.
? Strong, striking, and impressive, the narrative of the fearful events
of this fearful era is equally vivid and dazzling.?? Literary Gazette.


&li&erttssemcnt.
SECOND EDITION.
? Exhibiting a capacity for bistorical composition possessed by very
few writers of the pr�sent day ; a style stately, glowing, and impres-
sive ; views enlarged ; and language remarkable for str�pgth and
harmony.?? Morning Chronicle , January 19tb, 1847.
? The author is evidently quite master of his subject, and his style
of writing is at once vigorous, comprehensive, and graphie.? West-
minster Review, July, 1847.
FRENCH AND AMERICAN NOTICES.
? England has produced nothing like this siuce the days of Gibbon.
It combines the profundity of Guizot with the animation of Thiers.??
.De Lammenais.
? Jobson is a man of universal genius. As Mignet eloquentty
remarks, he speaks of men with the sense of Machiavel, and of matters
with the wit of Voltaire.?? Armand Carrel.
?Jobson?s information is astonishing. He knows the history of
France better than any living Frenchman, and is more familiar with
that of the early church than the Archbishop of Paris.?? Caussidierre,
?As secretary of the Institute, I h�ve to acknowledge your great
undertaking. As -a friend now of many years? standing, I congratu-
late you on your noble achievement.?? Arago.
? Our columns are, for a third day in succession, enriched by a
sparkling contribution from Mr. Jobson. His fecundity is remarkable,
and the style of his French is no less strikiug, reminding us of that of
Rabelais and the best days of Louis Quatorze.? ? Courrier des Etats Unis,
? We notice with pleasure the arrivai of such a man upon our shores.
He is one of those of whom this country has need, and who leaves his
mark wherever he appears.?? L?Avenir.
? An �l�gant classical scholar,and almost an ? iniprovisatore? in fully
half-a-dozen of modem languages ; a splendid speaker, and historian of
the highest order, Jobson really astonishes us, for he is also profound
in science, and not less prompt with his pistol than his pen.?? L?Etoile.
? We h�ve to-day been favoured with a new volume of Mr. Jobson?s
well known work ; but a book already in its fourth �dition requires no
eulogy from us.?? New York Express.
? We h�ve yet had no such writer in America. He rivais Alison or
Macaulay in the brilliancy of his style, and surpasses them in the im-
partiality of his opinions.?? Hon. Pierre Soul�, American Senator,
Republican Review.
?Jobson?s Poetry is perfect, and teems with ideas wholly new. Eveu
on Washington and the American Eagle he says :
? Our Eagle, young, with eyehalls dim,
Though proud, yet droops his crest to him,
While boldly soaring to the sun,
Round the halo of Washington;
That sun, which, since his race began,
Has ne?er looked down on such a man ;
That sun, which, till his race is o?er,
Will never see such hero more.? ?
?General Webb, New York Courier and Enquirer.
? The manner in which Jobson has been attacked by the vile portion
of the Australian press is simply infamous. We h�ve known him l?or
years, and so far from being an ? American ruffian,? can vouch that he
is a most urbane and highly accomplished Scottish gentleman.??
Colonel Smith, New York Courier.
