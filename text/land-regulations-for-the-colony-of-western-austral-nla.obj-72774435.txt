No. 186.?C.5.0.
Colonial Secretary?s Office,
Perth, 30th October, 1878.
DOUBTS having arisen as to the interpretation to he put upon
Section 72 of the New Land Regulations, fixing the fees to be
paid for Licenses to cut down and remove timber on Crown Lands,
His Excellency the Governor is pleased to notify that the con-
struction to be placed upon this section is as follows:
Persons engaged in cutting down trees to be used or exported as
piles or baulks, will be required to take out a license for the
purpose, for which they will have to pay <ï¿½3 each, or ï¿½5 the pair
per month; but they will not be required to take out a further
license for the persons employed in reomving the same during the
currency of their licenses.
Persons engaged in cutting down trees in any shape, so long as
the same are cut and removed simply and bond fide for the purpose
of being split or sawn up, and not for use or shipment as piles or
baulks, will have to take out a license for such cutting down, for
which they will have to pay 5 shillings per month each; and all
persons engaged in the removal of such timber, will have to take
out a similar license before they can assist in its removal.
It is further to be understood that persons holding a five shilling
license may cut down a tree and remove it as a log or baulk to
their saw pit; and a company or person having saw mills at a
distance from the place where the trees are to be found, may, on
taking out a five shilling license for every person engaged in
cutting down or removing such trees, lawfully cut down and
remove them in baulk or as logs to their saw mills, so long as they
do this solely for the purpose of splitting or sawing them up, and
not for the purpose of using or exporting them as piles or baulks.
His Excellency?s Command,
ROGER TUCKED- GOLDSWORTHY,
Colonial Secretary.
