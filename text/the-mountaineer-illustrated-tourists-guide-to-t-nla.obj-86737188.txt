SUGGESTED TRIPS.
If the tourist has a vehicle at command, a
visit may be made to the sights either on the
northern or southern sides in a day.
A flying visit can be made to the principal
sights on both sides in a day.
Pedestrians should take two days at least
for the sights on either side, though a day
may be pleasantly spent at almost any one
of them. . .
A feature of Dante's Glen is a visit by
night, when glow-worms are abundant.
A road from the bottom of Dante's Lien,
after winding around the creek, branches
into two at the bottom, one path leading
to Echo Point.
The track is now completed from the
Federal Fall to the Cataract, making a de-
lightful trip, including Adelina, Junction,
and Federal Falls, and The Cataract.
An average pedestrian can easily walk to
the Hazelbrook Terrace Falls from Lawson,
and return, either by way of Tne Cataract
or Hazelbrook.

SIGHTS.
WENTWORTH FALLS is the name not only
of the highest falls in Australia (900 feet),
but also of the district surrounding and me
village between them and the railway sta-
tion. In this district and within a two-mile
radius of the station there are one hundred
and eighteen (118) waterfaJls—a number un-
equalled in any part of the world. Good
tracks are made, so that visitors can com-
fortably view about half of these; but the
others are as yet only to be seen by good
climbers in charge of reliable guides.
The WENTWORTH FALLS are among the
leading sights of the Mountains. They are
unique broken falls, discharging their water
into a gap of unsurpassed beauty, which is
presented to the admiring gaze at every
turn of the miles of tracks that wind around
Prince Regent’s Glen. 1J miles from station
on the southern side. Cross the bridge,
which is about 200 yards from the station,
and follow the road which branches, almost
at right angles, to the left, and leads to the
head of the Falls.

rock. Just above Wentworth Fall. Take
the path to the left after entering the Re-
serve gate, and follow on past the shelter
shed.
KING’S TABLELAND. —A peninsular of
land running out in the Jamieson Valley,
which, owing to its unique position, is re-
markable in many respects. The cliff’ edge,
facing Prince Regent’s Glen, is threaded with
paths, which give lovely panoramic views of
a never-ending variety. Follow on past Roc-
ket Point.
The VALLEY OF WATERS (late The
Gorge).—A gap containing no less than 20
waterfalls in the descent of over 1800 feet to
the valley. It is one of the most beautiful
of the Mountain scenes One and a half

road to the Falls at Fletcher-street (where a
board is met with one mile from the
station, and this leads to the head
of the Valley. It may also be reached

NATIONAL PASS.—A new pass discovered
and recently opened, from the Valley of the
Waters, branching- to the left just below
the Lodore Falls, to the Centre Basin, be-
tween the upper and lower main Wentworth
Falls, thence up the cliffs near Rocket Point,
by the Grand Stairway, to the top of the
main falls. The distance is about li miles,
but, as there are no ladders or heavy grades,
it seems less than that distance on most
Mountain tracks. A very easy round trip,
including the Valley of Waters, Went-
worth Falls, Queen’s Cascade, Weeping Rock,
etc. This new path passes behind a number
of waterfalls from 200 to 400 feet high, past
several beautiful amphitheatres, and for the
whole of the length presents magnificent
views of valley and cliff. The Centre Basin
contains a number of cascades and water*
falls, besides camping room for thousands of
visitors. From this new track a variety of
views of Rocket Point—looo feet of sheei
cliff, the highest in Australia—is obtained
The Pass is securely fenced and wire-nettec
in all dangerous places, and the Grand Stair-
way is also provided with steel wire rope for
handrails.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF INTEREST. —The
Rest House. Tea Rooms, Empress Fall, Sylvia
Falls, Lodore Falls. Britanica Fall, Vera
Fall, The Forest (1840 feet below).

looking the beautiful Valley of Waters Gap
and the Valley of Wentworth.

LILIAN’S GLEN.—A most attractive and in-
teresting glen, with surrounding views well
worth a visit. Take the track tnat 1* ads to
the right immediately after descending into
The Valley of Waters, ana a splendid view
of the Glen will be obtained from the bridge.
ASMODEUS POOLS.—A little distance up
the Glen from the bridge are several beau-
tiful basins of water named as above. (Note
—The track is on the eastern side of the
creek.)
GLADSTONE PASS—A striking narrow de-
file of rare beauty that leads down into the
valley. Cross Lilian’s Glen Bridge, and fol-
low the bush track till the foundations of
some old mining plant are met with.
INSPIRATION POINT—One of the finest
look-out points running out into the Jamie-
son Valley. The track crosses to the left,
just below the top of Gladstone Pass. Be-
tween the two headlands of this po l ‘nt is one
of the most interesting passes on the Moun-
tains—Roberts’ Pass—only a few f« et wide,
yet containing a well-graded track connect-
ing with paths, and making a capital round
trip, giving, perhaps, the greatest variety
of scenery in the district, and including the
Pinnacle Rocks, the highest sheer cliffs (ex-
cept Rocket Point) in Australia. The track
leads up the hill on the western side of
Lilian’s Glen Creek from the bridge. Keep
the left-hand turnings all the way until the
Valley of Waters is reached as tho second
coal mine. This pass gives some of the best
cliff views in the district.

BREAKFAST POINT. —A fine vantage-point,
giving a magnificent view of Jamieson Val-
ley, midway between Den Fenella and Lyre
Bird’s Nest; reached either from Went-
worth Falls or Valley of Waters main
tracks, or by track along eastern fence of
Glen Lodge in Fletcher-street.
WATER NYMPH’S DELL.—A cool, shady,
ferny dell, with several nice waterfalls.
Turn to left after leaving station, and walk
along main road for a quarter of a mile
east, cross the line at the gates, and follow
along inside railway fence till a board la
met with indicating a clearly-defined path
which leads to the Dell. By taking the
track to the left on entering the Dell, the
most interesting views are obtained as the
track leads behind the various waterfalls,
which, when coloured by the sun’s rays at
midday, offer most charming contrasts to
the dark and sombre cave rocks. The re-
turn should be made down the meek until
path turns to the right upward.
WOODCUTTERS' GLEN., SAPHO'S LEAP,
THE UPPER VALLEY OF WATERS, and
several Other gullies are rich in ferns,
mosses, and waterfalls, but should not be
attempted without a competent guide
PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS.—In a central
position, about half a mile from the station,
are swimming baths, with a stream of beau-
tiful Mountain spring water constantly flow-
ing through them. Free to visitors. Ladies’
hours arranged.

SUGGESTED TRIPS.
Wentworth Falls offers a number and a
variety of trips. The Falls and Valley of
Waters properly require at least a day each.
By being driven to the Falls the tourists
could start from the Weeping Bock, follow
around the mile of tracks to Den Fenella,
and thence across to the Valley of Waters,
and meet vehicles there.
A full day should be taken to do the
round trip through the Valley of Waters via
the Centre Basin to Rocket Point, now tne
track is opened, but it can be done in half a
day if pressed for time.
A good pedestrian can walk from the Falls
via the Valley of Waters, Lilian’s Glen. In-
spiration Point, Gladstone Pass, to Sublime
Point, and thence to Leura via the Golf
Links, and thence to Katoomba; but it is
a good walk.
Water Nymph’s Dell, on other side of the
line, is easily visited.
SUNSET BOCK, KING’S TABLELAND, 4
miles, gives a magnificent view of the Jamie-
son Valley.

keep to the left of the old engine bank at
Gladstone Pass. A track which is, however,
not very distinct, leads to the Lilian’s Bridge,
from which a well-defined track leads to tne
Valley of Waters.
SUGGESTED TRBPS.
A flying visit to the principal sights around
the Leura Park Estate-Gordon Falls, Fairy
and Arcadia Glens, the Rock Outlooks, etc.—
could be made in one day, but they require
several days to do them properly.
A day should be taken for Sublime Point
if one intends to walk, but visitors can be
driven almost to that particularly fine point.
The trip for Leura Falls snould occupy a
day at least, although many days could ad-
vantageously be spent there without exhaust-
ing all its beauties.
All the trips under Katoomba heading ap-
ply almost the same to I.eura, especially
if one has a vehicle at command.
Gladstone Pass, Inspiration Point, and
Valley of Waters are within easy walking
distance, and vehicles can drive to Glad-
stone Pass. A day should be taken for
this trip.

SIGHTS.
LEURA FALLS.—A very deservedly popular
resort containing three beautiful and strik-
ing falls (especially the First Fall), besides
other pretty falls, and innumerable cascades,
ferny nooks and delis, etc. Leura Gap con-
tains two distinct descents, which meet near
the bottom, and lead out into the luxuriant
forest of the Jamieson Valley. Go down
Katoomba-street to Waratah-street, turn to
the left and take first street to the right
(Lurline-street). Merriwa-street is the first
street again to the left, and leads to the
shelter shed at the top of the Falls. (See
map.) One mile from railway station.
The tracks and points of interest are the
same as those described in the Leura section.
LEURA CASCADES (Upper and Lower).—
Some of the finest cascades that are to be
met with. Just above the head of Leura

streets. (See map.) One mile from station.
Splendid view of Jamieson Valley, Euined

spires rising up from the Jamieson Valley for
some hundreds of feet near the cliff edge.
(Best view from Echo Point.)
BANKSIA PAEK.—A reserve which over-
looks the fine Leura Gap, and gives some
good views of the Jamieson Valley. No pro-
per track is yet made to it, but the trustees
are arranging to have this done shortly.
KATOOMBA FALLS.—One of the most
beautiful resorts on the Mountains, with an
inexhaustible variety of scenes. There are
two fails of great depth with beautiful sil-
very cascades in the centre, and at the foot
of the second fall—the centre cascades from
the soft-flowing gossamer appearance are
often called the Bridal Veil. At this old
and popular sight over 1000 feet of cliff face
with the two falls and cascades are pre-
sented to the admiring gaze. The expanse
of rugged walls and the glorious panorama
of valley and distant cliffs with fern and
foliage are exceedingly beautiful. Distance,
U miles from the station. There are three
tracks to the Falls (see map), but the best is
either the vehicular road via Katoomba-
street, or the footpath via Cascade-street.

about 200 feet deep on one side and 600 or
700 on the other, and about 100 feet across
on the top.
UPPER CASCADES—A very pretty cascade

worthy of a name. Take rustic bridge across
the stream some distance above the Falls.

sal mountain standing out boldly before the
visitor at any point from the Narrow Neck

THE FEDERAL PASS.—This is a magnifi-
cent track, connecting Leura and Katoomba
Falls by way of the Valley. Besides forming
a connecting track between the two Falls,
it opens up a literal fern forest, and gives
tourists a walk beneath the stupendous
beetling crags that form the walls of the
mighty valley. The patfi leads right under-
neath the Three Sisters, and forms a walk
by means of which tourists may enjoy both
waterfall and valley scenery in one trip. The
Pass is miles in extent, from the bottom
of one Fall to the other, but tourists are re-
commended to start from Leura Falls, so as
to have to negotiate the smailer number of
steps at the end of the journey.

THE NARROW NECK.—A remarkable pe-
ninsular of land running from the main
ridge towards the Cox's River, for a distance
of 8 miles, and narrowing in places to the
width of a few chains. It begins about two
miles from the station. Go down Park-street

the right along Waratah-street to Cascade-
street to Neale-street; down Neale-street,
turning to the right in front of “Falls” Ho-

the tree is slightly inaccurate. It was doubt-
less marked by the explorers, Blaxland, Went-
worth, and Lawson, but they reached Mount
victoria and descended into the valley in
1813.
NELLY’S GLEN.—A romantic cleft in the
walls of the Megalong Valley, where a good
zig-zag path for saddle or foot is made into
the valley. It contains almost every variety
of Mountain scenery, the bold rugged rocks
being especially fine. The descend begins
about one and a half miles westward from
the station. The track diverges to the left
over rising ground some 20 yards short of
the Explorers’ Tree. (See map.) The track
leads right on to the Jenolan Caves amidst
the grandest scenery to be met with any-
where in the world. The Bride’s Veil is a
very pretty fall, and the cave behind it is
a large and remarkable one. In tlie Glen
are many points of beauty, and swimming,
shooting, and fishing are to be had a little
distance from the foot.
BONNIE BOON.—A nice gully making a
short cut to Nelly’s Glen, but the track is
now somewhat out of repair. The track
runs off the main road just past cottage
“Hillcrest.”
PXJLPiT HILL—A rise near the Explorers’
Tree. A point more of historic than sylvan
interest. It received 'its name from a rock
that bore a remarkable resemblance to a
preacher in a pulpit. It was broken up by
the road-makers.
OLD CEMETERY.—Near Pulpit Hill. An

tiers of this portion of the Blue Mountains
found their last resting-place.

MINNI-HA-HA FALLS.—A really lovely fall
on the north side of the line, about 2§ miles
from the station, with a splendid basin of
water, which is very deep, and several un-
successful attempts nave been made to bot-
tom it. The stream runs over rocky terraces
for some distance, and then forms some
pretty cascades in a cup-shapea hollow above
the head of the fall. The track leads to the
left down the lane between the Coffee Palace
and new Masonic Temple, opposite the Police
Station. (See map.)
SUGGESTED TRIPS.
For the convenience of visitors, the editor
suggests the following trips, but it must be
remembered they are “suggestions’* only;—
Katoomba and Leura Falls or Echo. Point
may easily be reached on foot from either
Katoomba station (see map), or vehicles are
always plying at very reasonable charges.
For a single trip to Leura Falls we recom-
mend the following as the best:—Go down
the Fern Bower track (No. 3) and return via
No. 2 track to the bottom of the First Pall,
thence by the new track to Gertrude's Out-
look and the top of the Falls and Leura Cas-
cades to the Meeting of the Waters;, and
return to the shelter shed and the Railed
Point.
A day at least should be spent at Leura
Falls, or every day for a week can be passed
there without exhausting its beauties.
From the Leura Cascades a path leads east
to the beautiful sights of the Leura district.

A day can be pleasantly spent at the Ka
toomba Falls. In fact, several days, if one
has the time at their disposal.
By means of the Federal Pass, tourists
may go by way of the Valley amid glorious
scenery from Leura to Katoomba Falls, thus
enabling a fairly good walher to see both
these magnificent sights at one trip in half
a day. But a full day is recommended. The
Pass may be “done” from either Leura or
Katoomba end, but the former is the more
advisable route.
The Narrow Neck affords delightful walks
between the two great vaneys up to 8 miles,
but vehicles may be driven for the first two
miles.
To Nelly’s Glen is a nice drive or walK.
The zig-zag path to the bottom has to be
negotiated on foot or saauie.
This Glen may also be reached by the Bon-
nie Boon track, but the path is not so good.
A day can be pleasantly spent amid the
varied beauties of the fascinating Nelly’s

GOVETT’S LEAP.—One of the most re-
markable and fascinating chasms on the
Blue Mountains, which possesses some of the
finest scenery in the world. It is a roman-
tic gap in the deep, narrow, and fertile

The waterfall, named about 1830 after Mr.
Surveyor Govctt, has a clear drop of 520
feet. A fine look-out point is provided at
Breakfast Rock, to which the pathway at
the termination of the above road leads.
From Breakfast Rock a path leads down

You can safely advise your friends to consult
Dentist Alfred Seller, at Katoomba
tourist to Evans’ Look-out; this takes one
through Rodriguez Pass. By turning to
left just before reaching bottom of Govett’s
Leap Fall, the track leads to a beautiful
fertile spot known as “The Jangle,” and also
to bottom of Horseshoe Palls.
It is estimated that around the Leap the
tops of the cliffs are in places 3000 feet above
sea level, and the perpendicular cliffs 700
and 800 feet) the highest known in the
world.
HORSE SHOE FALLS.—A pretty fall to
the left of the shelter shed.
POPE’S GLEN.—A sylvan glen a little to
the left of Govett’s Leap road, at the head
of Horseshoe Falls.
PULPIT ROCK.—A striking column of rock
immediately opposite Breakfast Rock.
GOVETT’S WALK.—A delightful walk to
Govett’s Leap. The track commences oppo-
site the railway station at bottom of Gar-
diner-street, and, following the meandering
creek through a pleasant valley, termin-

ley by turning off this track toward the
Valley.
POETEE’S PASS.—A romantic defile on
one of the bold headlands on the western
side of the station. The scenery around
is grand and rugged, and when the Pass
receives the attention it deserves, it will
become a popular resort. Distance, 1J miles.
Take Bathurst-road towards Mount Victoria
to new overbridge, cross railway, and
thence follow track as directed by finger-
boards. The Pass leads into the Kanimbla

Beauchamp Falls
Rodriguez Pass, Blackheath


Artificial Teetk, Perfect Fit with Natural Appear,
ance. Seller, Katoomba.
Waterfalls are met with in scores and cas-
cades in hundreds, and the tourilt pierces
right down 2000 feet in the depths of the
romantic Grose Valley, with its wealth of
ferns and other wonderful beauties. It is
named after Mr. Rodriguez, through whose
efforts it was made. Tourists may go down
either Govett’s Leap or Evans’ Look-out, the
routes and distances for which are previous-
ly given. The principal sights along the
Pass, starting from Govett’s Leap Look-out,
are
Underneath the Fall.
Trinity Falls; The Junction; The River
Bed Rest; Campbell Fall; John Harris Fall;
Bettington Fall; Pope Fall; Beauchamp Fall;
The Fernery; Blackwall Glen, including Eden-
derry Falls and Pool (which is 70 feet across);
Lilian Cascades; and Hilary Falls. To reach
Blackwall Glen, leave Rodriguez Pass track
where marked “Blackwall Junction.”
GRAND CANYON.—Undoubtedly one of the
most magnificent sights on the Mountains
recently opened up. The track commences
at Wall’s Cave, and follows the stream, con-
necting with Rodriguez Pass at the Fernery.
The track is about miles long, and em-
braces varied scenery, with beauty spots
right throughout the full length. In one
part the track emerges from a tunnel, and
follows the sides of the gully, the stream
rushing through a narrow ravine some 50
to 100 feet below. The Grand Canyon may
also be reached via Neate’s Glen, at the
bottom of which turn to the left. The
most popular way is to go to Evans’ Look-
out, turn to the right into Rodriguez Pass,

The turn-off from Bathurst-road is the same
as for Wall’s Caves. Distance, 2| miles.
SHIPLEY.—This is a peninsular running
out into the Kanimbla Valley, and furnishes
a never-ending variety of scenes of Moun-
tain beauties of almost every description.
From 3 to 4 miles from station. The road
turns off to the right from the Blackheath
and Megalong road near the top of Black-
heath Glen. (Sqe map.)
SUGGESTED TRIPS.
Govett’s Leap is a sight no tourist should
miss. Visitors may be driven to the Look-
out and back in a very short time. But
to drink in the full majesty and grandeur
is impossible, even if time is unlimited.
Picnic requirements are on the spot, and
rambles may be enjoyed according to the
time at the tourists’ disposal.
A pleasant walk to the Leap is by way of
Govett’s Walk.
One of the grandest trips on the .blue
Mountains is a visit to the magnificent
Grose Valley, fertile to a semi-tropical de-
gree. Easily reached by means of the new
track down the cliffs to the bottom of
Govett’s Leap.
The Grand Canyon demands a full day to
“do” it thoroughly. Drive to the turn-off
to go to Wall’s Caves, and meet the vehicle
at Evans’ Look-out. jx really good day’s
outing.
Porter’s Pass may be easily reached on
foot.
Wall’s Cave.—Either drive or walk, accord-
ing to time and inclination. This ana


Children’s Teeth carefully attended at Sellers’
Surgery, Katoomha
Neate’s Glen may easily be seen in an after-
noon.
There Is now a good road to Evans' Look-
out via The Avenue. (See map.)
Neate's Glen is an ideal picnic place,
where half a day or a day can be pleasant-
ly spent.
Govett's Leap, Eodriguez Pass, and Evans’
Look-out may be done in one day, but un-
less visitors are fairly good walkers, they
are advised to take a vehicle one or both
ways at tne top.
If tourists are not equal to the round trip,
Evans’ Look-out, The Fernery, and Beau-
champ Falls should be visited.
To Hat Hill and Perry’s LooKdown is a
splendid drive or cycle spin.
By means of the Blackheath and Megalong
road tourists may drive down into the Val-
ley. A day may be pleasantly spent in the
Glen itself, which contains many beautiful
spots for picnicers, though some of its na-
tural beauty has been ruthlessly destroyed.

angles to the right is taken. A new road
has been made right to the Falls, and makes
a lovely drive.
VIEW OP THE GROSE—The Grose is one
of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring Val-

THE GREAT ZIG-ZAG
The illustration on the opposite page gives
a faint idea of the wonderful work which is
said to rank among the best triumphs of
railway construction, and cost the State
nearly half a million.
Is a marvel of engineering skill, negotiat-
ing the Blue Mountain Range to allow the
“iron horse" to speed its way to the “Fer-
tile Plains of the West.”
From the cliffs overhead to the plain below
is 700 feet, and the actual depth from the
top line to the bottom descent is 500 feet,
accomplished by a triple zig-zag road by
cuttings in the solid rock, three aqueducts,
and a tunnel.
The length of the midale road is 69 chains,
the grade lin 33. The other grades are 1 in
42 and 1 in 60.
In the execution of these works two gigan-
tic masses of rock—one estimated to contain
40,000 and the other 45 j tons —were blasted.
These blasts took 3J and 3| tons of powder,
respectively.
It is estimated that the Zig-Zag will be
done away with in a lew years, as the rail-
way traffic has grown to such an extent as
to demand a quicker route. The line may,
however, still be used for tourist traffic.

JENOLAN CAVES.
HOW 70 REACH THEM AND COST.
Situated in the very heart of the wonder-
ful Blue Mountains, aie among the most
beautiful in the world.
The lime-stone at the Oaves was formed
under the sea by coral polyp, and is, at the
present time, an organic rock, being com-
posed of corals, shells, and crinoids, or sea
lilies as they are called. They have been
formed into one hard mass through up-
heaval. Then began the formation of the
underground passages. These are caused by
water containing carbonic acid gas from or-
ganic matter percolating through the fis-
sures from a higher level and finding its
way out at a lower level. In its passage it
releases the carbonic acid gas, and the lime
is carried off in solution, and in course of
time these underground streams open out
new courses and leave the old ones dry and
ready for the stalagmite and stalactite beau-
ties to be formed.
It is impossible to estimate the age of the
stalactites and stalagmites. One of the best
authorities says that under the most favor-
able conditions they would grow a sixteenth
of an inch in a year, or four or five feet in
a thousand years.

POINTS AND WARNINGS.
Guides are employed by the Government,
and no person is allowed to enter unless ac-
companied by a guide.
The principal Caves are lit up with elec-
tricity, and the guides are provided with a
magnesium light for the assistance of
visitors.
Most of the principal Caves may be visited
in one’s ordinary clothes, but if you mean
to do any extensive exploration be sure to
take your oldest and shabbiest clothes and
stout boots. A soft hat is indispensable.
Only one Cave can be seen at each inspec-
tion, as the Eight Imperial Cave. Left Im-
perial Cave, Lucas, Nettle, Elder, and Ju-
bilee Caves require from two to three hours.
Visitors desirous of inspecting the River
Cave must first inspect the Lucas Cave; and


Teeth Extracted Absolutely Painless, consult
Dentist Seller, Katoomba.
those who wish to see the Jubilee Cave must
have inspected the Eight Imperial.
In the summer or holiday season it is ad-
visable to order rooms by letter or telegram
in advance.
Intoxicating liquors are not kept at the
Caves. Those whose health is likely to suffer
by a few days’ abstinence should therefore
take their own supplies.
Shooting or trapping on the Caves Eeserve
is strictly prohibited.
A Camping Ground, with poles for tents,
is now specially provided. The location is
up the gully from the Caves House, and is
indicated by notice-boards.
A place is also provided for paddocking
horses.
ROUTE FROM MOUNT VICTORIA.
From Mount Victoria the road is very pic-
turesque, and it is a drive or cyclists’ trip,
such varied panorama that its memory
is never effaced from the mind. It is one
of the best-made and maintained roads in
the State.
From the town the Eathurst-road is used,
and the main Blue Mountain Eidge is left
via the Mount Victoria Pass, which is one
of the sights of the Mountains. The locality
is wild and rugged, and the road winds
down, safe and secure, by fairly easy grades
amid mighty walls of rock thousands of feet
high. It is one of the most romantic yet
securely-made roads to be met with in the
States.


Teeth Filled with Gold, Platinum, &c., at Moderate
Fees at Seller’s, Katoomba.
On the flat the road runs through Little
Hartley and Hartley—places with their
quaint old houses associated with the ' old
days.”
At the Eiver Lett, just beyond Hartley,
the Bathurst-road is left about 8 or 9 miles
from Mount Victoria, and shortly afterwards
the Hiver Cox is crossed at Glenroy Bridge.
Mile after mile of bush then follows, with
settlers' clearings at intervals.
About 19 miles out are Half-way Houses
for the convenience of passengers and tour-
ists.
Beyond the Half-way Houses again are
miles and miles of scrub, and for seven or
eight miles the grade is somewhat heavy.
The highest point on the road is Bindo
Pinch, Mount Bindo being the highest point
on the Blue Mountains. 4460 feet above sea
level.
The last five miles wind down hills of im-
mense height, and many of the curves are
so sharp that notices are put up, reminding
cyclists to go slowly; but the road is a good
one. and it is an easy journey down to the
Grand Arch, and through it to Caves House.
ROUTE FROM KATOOMBA OR
BLACKHEATH.
This, the shortest route to the Caves, is
a bridle track only, and in parts somewhat
rough. It begins at Nelly’s Glen, Katoomba,
or the Blackheath and Megalong road. The
distance is 33 miles from Katoomba, and 34
miles from Blackheath.


Nitrons Oxide Gas Administered Daily
Dentist Alfred Seller, Katoomba
The road is a Government one, and from
Katoomba mile-pegs are now placed all along
—beginning from the Bathurst-road. Though
not well-formed, the road is nearly all the
way clearly defined, and conspicuously
“blazed” with big bell “blazes,” and there
are several settlers along the track.
The first gate is met just past the Mega-
long Creek, 1870 feet above sea level, near
the four-mile post, and the road runs be-
tween two fences for some distance.
Between the 7 and 8 mile posts, there is
what is called a “short track” to the right,
but tourists are advised to keep to the
“blazed” load.
The road is, from here, Quite easy to the
River Cox, which is crossed just past the
11-mile peg by a log across the stream be-
tween Dyson’s and “Billy” Lynch’s places,
and begins on the other side about 5 chains
higher up. The height here is 940 feet above
sea level.
Near the 13-mile post a panoramic view of
the Mountain townships can be obtained.
Between the 14 and 15 nuie posts the Little
River is crossed at a height of 1830 feet above
sea level, and the ascent of the Black Range
commences. This is 3200 feet above sea level,
and the arduous climb ends just past the
17-mile peg. An old cart track is followed
for some 4 or 5 miles along the top of the
range, which is level, and past the 22-mile
peg a turn to the left brings the tourist on
to the main road from Mount Victoria at
3980 feet above sea level.


Dentist Alfred teller visits Blackheath every
Thursday.
Water can be obtained along the Black
Range in a gully to the left, near the 19-
mile peg.

WINTER ON THE MOUNTAINS.
Those who simply visit the Mountains to
escape the humid heat of Sydney in tne
summer—though charmed with the beauty of
deep ravine and mighty headland, of glorious
waterfall and bold escarpment-have no idea
of the transcendent beauty in which these
sights are clothed when
“Winter’s snowy pinions
Shake the white down in the air.”
The crispness of the air makes every fibre of
the body pulsate and vibrate again with a,
fulness of life that must be felt to be real-
ised. It makes the old feel young and the
young beside themselves in an ecstacy of joy.
All sense of languor is lost; the step is
buoyant and elastic, and life really seems
worth living.
The rich azure blue in which the whole
landscape is bathed is bewitching. The purity
of the air seems to annihilate space and
makes miles appear but feet only. Then can
the glories of the Mountains be seen at their
very best. The veriest details of huge battle-
ments miles away can be plainly traced, and
the distant hills appear but —a stone’s throw.
Snow! Beautiful snow! Snow on the Moun-
tains is among the glorious sights and ex-
periences that are afforded in such prolifi-
cacy. All is bright and pure, sparkling and
crystalline. The sight is a never-to-be-forgot-
ten one. Deep down in the abysses, every-
where in the range of vision—far more than
ordinarily extensive—white glistening snow—
an emblem of gentleness and purity. Sunny
Australia furnishes few such sights, and
here it is, a couple of hours’ ride from Syd-
ney. Oh! the thrilling delight of snowball-
ing! It fires one with

POINTS AND WARNINGS.
boots y ° U * ntenc * to walk at all. wear stout
Wear flannels; though the davs mav he
warm, the nights are cool.
Between May and October prepare for cold
weather.
Hotel and boarding-house charges are much
the same as in town.
In the summer or holiday seasons it is
advisable to order rooms by letter or tele-
gram in advance.
Families intending to spend a lengthy holi-
day on the Mountains can economise by ar-
ranging with hotel or boarding-house keepers
or taking furnished cotages.
In addition to the passenger trains, tour-
ists can travel between Mountain stations by
goods train at frequent intervals. The ap-
proximate time of departure of these trains
(some of which run regularly) can be ascer-
tained from the stationmasters.
Most of the sights are within an easy walK
or drive of one or the other Mountain centres.
To forestall disappointment in those who
have heard the Mountain cascades compare'?!
in height with the cascades of the Ola vVorld
it may be as well to mention that the mar-


Children’s Teeth Carefully Attended at Seller’s
ye! of the Mountain cascades lies—not in
the volume of the fall—but in the depth of
its descent. The Mountain streams are too
numerous, too rapid, and too swift to hold
(except immediately after heavy storms) any
great volume of water. It is not, therefore
the size of the torrents, but the bewildering
depth of their plunge, and the colossal size
and wondrous charm of their surroundings
which earn from all who see them the ready
tribute of wonder and praise.
In descending and ascending the charming
Mountain gullies and heights, it should be
accomplished, especially by those unaccus-
tomed to it—in short stages, and with fre-
quent rests. For this purpose the Mountain
Trusts have provided seats at frequent inter-
vals. It is folly to spoil a trip by wearying
oneself.
Do not interfere or destroy any of the
Mountain beauties. Great trouble is taken
to provide advantages for visitors, and there
is a heavy penalty for offenders.
WHY THE MOUNTAINS ARE
HEALTHFUL.
The following are extracts from a chapter
on “Mountain Air” in Dr. Phillip Muskett's
excellent work, “The Feeaing and Manage-
ment of Australian Infants,” inserted by per-
mission from the publishers, Messrs. Eyre
and Spottiswoode, London and Sydney:—
“Air lessens in density as we ascend, and
the pressure of the atmosphere Keeps dimin-
ishing with the altitude attained. Hence
Mountain air is more rarefied than ordinary
air. It is perfectly pure also, and free from
all atmospheric dust and micro-organisms.


“Mountain air contains a relatively large
amount of ozone. Ozone itself being one of
the most powerful disinfectants known, it
follows that it is a great purifier of the air
—and, further, ozonised air is healtny and
stimulating.
“The dryness of the Mountain air allows
the sun’s rays to pass through without ab-
sorbing them, and, consequently, a person
may receive the full glow of the sun, al-
though the air surrounding him may be
absolutely cold. This peculiar penetration
of the sun’s rays through Mountain air is
known as diathermancy.
“The violet and ultra-violet rays of Moun-
tain sunlight act chemically upon the blood,
and improve its quality by increasing tne
haemoglobin—that chrystalizable body, which
forms so large a portion of the red cor-
puscles of the blood.
“With most people Mountain air acts as a
general tonic, and promotes the appetite.
Not only do they eat well, but usually sleep
well too. Indeed, it generally acts especially
on literary and professional men as a so-
porific. The rest, too, is very much more
refreshing than that obtained at lower
levels—six hours’ sleep being as good as
eight hours’ elsewhere.
“Mountain air has, further, the remarkable
property of promoting metabolism—that is to
say, it hastens the various changes which
are continually taking place throughout tne
system. In this way it replaces the worn-
out tissues with new material.”
The doctor pertinently points out the ad-
vantages of the Mountains are gained—not
like doses of medicine—but every bour of tne
twenty-four.

TO MOUNTAIN VANDALS.
When I find names marked on sundry roads
and passes,
Then I know the world possesses human
asses;
And then I know that God has sent his
creatures tools
Which are oft misused in shaping names of
fools.
Vain, poor mortal he who thus inscribes his
name,
And, without brains, presumes to hack his
way to fame.
—H. Peckmarl.

fiotel Alexandra, Ecura.
RIGHT in the very centre of the most
varied and beautiful scenery of the
far-famed Blue Mountains stands the
Hotel Alexandra. The bar and its rooms
are at the back of the visitors’ quarters, and
face the main trunk road from Sydney to
Bathurst, so that the visitors’ and reception
rooms are practically detached ; and from
the ample verandahs on the southern side,
a magnificent panorama of cliff and forest,
and deep ravine, meets the gaze of the
visitor, and discloses at every point a won-
drous landscape of varied beauty In fact,
the situation is so central as to be unique,
and the management, under the copious
and wise experience of Mr. and Mrs. Bloome,
leaves nothing to be desired. A constant
visitor writes thus: —“The servants are
exceptionally well fraim d and efficient, and
there is never an evidence of anything but
the most kindly feeling between them and
the management. The menu and cookery
are up-to-date, and the catering first-class,
equal to that of any metropolitan hotel.
All the comforts of a heme are provided—
hot and cold water baths, fish and fruit in
their season, and in fact nothing is wanting
to ensure the comfort of visitors.”
