AN APPRECIATION.
BY CH. F. WINZER.
(Chief Inspector of Art. Department of Education, Ceylon.)
IF ever Ceylon reaches the point when a history of its modern
Art comes to be written, the work of W. W. Beling, produced
in a period in which Art was a negligible factor in the intel-
lectual life of the Island, shall stand as a portent that Art when
approached with sincerity develops in the most unfavourable
circumstances.
To Beling Art was an escape —a haven of rest from his official
duties. His mind remained alive to the beauties of nature and his
eyes sensitive to colour, in spite of the deadening routine of his
daily work.
He lives and shall live through his hours of rest and leisure,
during which he expressed on canvas and paper his love of the
light and movement of nature —the silent enchantment of the
jungle at noon or in the abrupt twilight of the tropics—the rush of
waves towards the coast-the melancholy of old buildings seen
against the western glow. Beling did not seek immediate success
or a newspaper fame: his work was not caught up in the tide of
modern commercialism —it remains a living witness, that Art, the
flower of life, can flourish in the midst of daily toil, bringing its
own reward.
