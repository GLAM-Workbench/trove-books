THE
ADVENTUROUS KOALAS
Katie Koala sat on a log, thinking
deeply. At last she jumped up and
ran through the trees to find her
best friend, Jimmy. She found him,
playing by the stream.
“Oh, Jimmy/’ she called. “I have
such a good idea.”
“What is it?” Jimmy cried
eagerly, looking up from his toy
boats.
“Well,” Katie paused, but only
to arouse her young friend’s curiosity.
“Yes, yes. What is it, Katie?”
Jimmy was impatient.
“I am going, and you are coming,
too, to find the fairies. I’d love to see
a fairies’ ball.”


“o—oh, fairies,” Jimmy was dis-
appointed. “Katie, I—l don’t want
to go.”
“You must,” Katie seemed firm.
“Think of the fun we could have on
the way. Why, I don’t even know
where the fairies live. It would be
such an adventure.”
Jimmy looked a little more inter-
ested. “I suppose so,” he remarked
slowly.
“Of course it would. The fairies
might even grant us a wish.”
Jimmy’s interest was caught at
last. “Yes, yes. Why,” he jumped
up in excitement, “we could go down
the stream on a raft. Pretend we
were pirates even. Katie, it will be
fun.”
“You must ask your Uncle Carl
Koala for a loan of his raft.”


Katie Koala finds Jimmy playing by the
stream with his toy boat.


“All right,” said Jimmy. “But I
don’t think he will.”
But, strangely enough, Uncle Carl
hadn’t minded at all. Jimmy was
his favourite nephew, and he found
it difficult to refuse him anything,
even his prized raft.
Next day, Katie and Jimmy said
good-bye to their parents, who had
reluctantly given their permission
for the adventure. “But,” as
Father Koala had said, “you can’t
make babies of them all their lives,
and I am a wee bit proud of them
wanting to go adventuring. It shows
they’ve got spirit.”
They piled their luggage aboard
the raft, and jumped on. Jimmy
pushed off with the oar, and the
great adventure had started.


They piled their luggage on the raft. Their
great adventure had begun.


“What ho/’ Jimmy sang. “We are
pirates gay.”
“With cutlass and sword, and
treasure hoard,” Katie took up the
song.
“We sail on our merry way,”
Jimmy finished with a laugh
How those two bears enjoyed
themselves on the first part of their
journey. As they passed towns on
the banks of the stream, they called
and waved to their friends. But
soon they were passing through
strange country. Neither had been
very far before, so they were happy
in the thought of being explorers.
One town was very large, and
Jimmy's voice was filled with awe
when he said —
“That town there is the biggest

in all the bush. My Uncle Carl told
me about it.”
“Do let’s stop here and see what
it is like.” Katie begged.
Jimmy looked doubtful. “Should
we?” he asked.
“Yes, I think so, it is such an
important place,” said Katie.
So they tied the raft up at the
wharf and jumped ashore. What a
morning they had!
“Why” Katie gasped in amaze-
ment, “there are six shops just on
this side of the street, and four on
the other side. What do they want
with all those shops?” Katie was
only used to one or two shops in the
whole village, so her surprise was
great.


They tied up the raft at the wharf and
jumped ashore.


“I counted seven others coming
along/’ said Jimmy.
They were so mystified that they
asked a passing kangaroo what all
the shops were for.
The kangaroo, however, laughed
scornfully. “You must be queer,”
he said. “Fancy not knowing what
shops are for!”
The bears were annoyed. Katie
was looking in the windows. “They
sell boys’ clothing in this one,” she
said.
“And girls’ in this one,” Jimmy
said, puzzled.
“And hats in this one.”
“And vegetables in this one,”
Jimmy gasped.
“Why don’t they put them all in


“Fancy not knowing what shops are for,”
said the kangaroo scornfully.


one shop?” Katie asked, but Jimmy
shook his head.
“I don’t know. I’ll ask Uncle Carl
when I see him again.”
They wandered back to the
stream, which had widened con-
siderably since they had passed Gum
Town. Jimmy pushed off again, and
they floated away from the town.
Soon Katie noticed the towns and
villages were few and far between.
The bushes and trees grew thickly
down to the water’s edge. There
were no birds singing, no animals
talking. The sun hardly penetrated
through the thick foliage.
Katie murmured, “I’m a bit afraid
of this part here.”
“Pooh,” Jimmy answered, but he
really was afraid, too.


Suddenly, as they rounded the bend, they
saw a big black boat coming towards them.


Suddenly, as they rounded a bend,
they saw a black boat with black
sails coming towards them.
“Katie,” Jimmy screamed, “it’s
the river pirates.”
He turned and paddled back up
the stream.
Katie looked scared. “What are
they?”
“They are cruel, mean beasts. All
the rogues of the bush,” Jimmy
gasped.
“They’re getting nearer,” Katie
squealed, “Hurry.”
Jimmy pulled with all his strength
on the oar, but they were going
against the stream.
“Row over to the bank. Quickly,”
Katie cried.


A rough voice roared, “Jake tie the raft
on the back and bring the kids up.”


Jimmy turned, but even in trying
to reach the bank, the raft went
downstream for a little way.
The pirates were nearly up to the
raft now. It was only a matter of
time. Then to the bears’ dismay, the
raft caught in a sandbank, and they
couldn’t move it.
“It’s no use,” said Jimmy.
Katie began to cry, and Jimmy
sniffed dismally.
The black boat came alongside,
and a rough voice roared: “Jake, tie
the raft on the back and bring the
kids up.”
“Aye, aye, Captain,”
The bears were brought on board
the pirate craft, their faces full of
terror.


;.; £ V
They were brought before the Captain, who
was a big wallaby.


The captain, a big wallaby, strode
forward.
“Tie ’em up.”
“Aye, aye, sir,” one of the men
said, and commenced his task.
“Put ’em in the prisoners’ cabin.”
Katie and Jimmy were led away.
They found themselves in a small,
dark cabin, with only one porthole.
After a while, Jimmy looked out.
“They have turned the boat,” he
said. “We are still going down-
stream.”
A few days passed, and Katie
and Jimmy were very scared of the
brutal captain. He made them
scrub the deck, wash dishes, make
beds and tidy up. Jimmy had one
whipping because he broke a cup.


Katie finds the treasure map in the Captain’s
cabin.


One day, as Katie was in the
Captain’s cabin, making his bed,
she noticed a map lying on the
floor. After examining it, she saw
it was a map of some hidden
treasure. She put it in her pocket
and ran to tell Jimmy. They then
hid it in their cabin. When the
Captain found out his loss he was
furious. He had everyone searched,
and every nook and corner of the
ship. But he did not find the map.
Jimmy had put it in his mattress.
The cruel Captain was in a rage for
days. He whipped his two prisoners
as well as his men.
Several nights after the map had
disappeared, Katie was looking out
of the porthole. She had not looked
out before, and neither had Jimmy
since the first night.


Looking out of the porthole, Katie sees a
small boat.


Imagine her delight when she saw
a small boat directly below. She
called Jimmy.
“Let’s try to escape,” he said
So, very carefully, they climbed
through the porthole and into the
boat. With all possible speed they
rowed to the bank, and at last
reached it safely.
“I think,” Jimmy said slowly, “it
would be a good idea if we sank
the boat.”
“Yes,” agreed Katie, “the pirates
would not know what had happened
to us then.”
So they made a hole in the rowing
boat and then left it to sink.
They ran as hard as they could,
away from the river and the pirates.


-
They safely reached the shore.


At last Katie stopped, too tired to
run any further. She sat down,
Jimmy beside her, both thoroughly
exhausted.
It was nearly morning, and the
sky was faintly dappled with pink.
Behind their resting place, they
could see some mountains, which
appeared to form a large circle. In
front and around them was dense
bushland.
“We must have come miles/’
Jimmy said.
Katie yawned. “I don’t care. I’m
going to sleep,” and she curled up
and closed her eyes. Jimmy fixed
himself a bed of leaves, and soon
he, too, was fast asleep.
Hours later they awoke, feeling
quite refreshed, and decided to

climb the mountain. Katie paused
when the summit was nearly
reached, and looked out over the
way they had come. Far away, she
saw the river, a silver, curving l
ribbon in the distance. Between it
and the mountain lay a vast stretch
of trees and bushes.
“We are safe at last,” Katie said,
as they continued up the mountain.
They had gained the top, and
stared in amazement.
“Fairyland,” they both gasped.
“We’ve found it.”
Down towards the glittering city
they raced. At one end of the
valley was a golden castle, with a
long path leading up to it. There
was a large lake at the other end,
with tiny golden boats moored at
one side. Tiny houses, all gleaming

in the sun, clustered about the
centre of the valley. A tangle of
flowers and ferns lined the outer
edge of the valley. Near the lake
stretched a patch of vivid green
grass. One part of it was covered
with toadstool seats before a flat
rock.
Katie thought it must be a stage.
Her headlong flight was stopped
very soon, however. The mountain
ended half-way down in a sheer
cliff. It was impossible to descend,
even adventurous Jimmy knew that.
Katie just sat down and cried.
“There must be a secret entrance/’
she sobbed, “and now we can’t go in.”
Just then, Jimmy noticed a large
rock moving in a most mysterious
way. Even as he watched, the rock
moved to one side, revealing an

entrance. Two fairies came up, and
after closing the entrance, they
disappeared into the bush.
At once the bears ran forward
and pushed aside the boulder. A
flight of steps went down some
distance, but they could not see
where it ended.
“Come on/’ Katie said, tears for-
gotten in her excitement. Down
they went, down, down. It was so
dark they could hardly see. Sud-
denly, Katie slipped on a step and
rolled over and over. The steps had
ended, and a path led on into the
darkness. They hurried on. The
way seemed lighter, and as they
turned a corner they saw the
entrance.
“Hurray,” cried Katie and Jimmy

together, as they ran out into the
sunshine. “How beautiful it is.”
They ran to and fro, exploring.
Soon a bunch of fairies espied the
bears and ran forward to greet
them with exclamations of surprise.
“How did you get here?”
“Who told you the secret of the
passage?”
“What are your names?”
“Where did you come from?”
Katie and Jimmy were bewildered
by the questions hurled at them,
and tried to answer them all in
turn, and everyone became very
friendly.
“We’re having a grand ball
to-night,” suddenly one of the fairies
said, “would you like to come?”


By the sides of the great path, elves in
scarlet suits stood on guard.


“Yes, yes,” cried Katie. “Could
we meet the Queen?”
“I think you may,” smiled the
fairy.
So they were taken along to the
beautiful palace. By the sides of
the great path, elves in scarlet suits
stood on guard. At the top of the
broad steps that led to the door,
two guards dressed in blue stood,
with swords by their side. It all

children.
The Queen was very pleased to
see them. She laughed and talked
all through the meal they had with
her. “Just like a real person,”
Jimmy said later.
“I will see you at the ball to-night,”
the Queen said, as they were leaving.
“In the meantime, you could be

exploring my land.” She smiled as
she said, “Good-bye for the present .”
Katie and Jimmy hurried away in
great glee.
“Let’s go to the lake,” Jimmy said.
Arriving at the lake, they found
a pixie boatman, who offered to
take them for a row. They joyfully
accepted, and spent a pleasant hour
on the water. After this they
explored the valley, sometimes walk-
ing, sometimes riding in one of the
fairy coaches, once, even flying on
the big birdplane. Later, they had
tea in a pretty shop and had the
most delicious things.
Dusk was falling when they made
their way to the ball ground near
the river. The fairies were sitting
on the toadstools, and the Locust
Band was tuning up on the rock

stage. The trees were hung with
brilliant lanterns, while in one corner
a few fairies were preparing supper.
A special toadstool was lit by a
large blue lantern. This was for the
Queen, who always sat there at the
balls. Soon she arrived, and the
band began to play. The lawn was
crowded with dancers, and the scene
was beautiful. Katie and Jimmy
danced with the rest, and they did
enjoy themselves. After supper,
the Queen called for Katie and
Jimmy and said:
“Whenever we have visitors in
Fairyland, we grant them a wish
before they leave. What would you
like to wish for?”
Katie and Jimmy thought for a
moment.


With the treasure on their cars, they
journeyed homeward again.


“A car/’ said Jimmy.
“A car,” repeated Katie, who
wanted everything the same as her
friend.
“Well,” the Queen smiled, “when
you reach the highway by the Three
Rocks, you will find your cars.”
Then a band of elves escorted the
bears to the secret entrance.
“Good-bye,” called the bears, “and
thank you.”
“Good-bye,” replied the elves,
waving their hands.
Jimmy pulled the treasure map
out of his pocket. It was a few days
later, and the bears had been
tramping through the bush all this
time.


siS
They arrive home with the treasure.


“I had forgotten this,” he said, as
he studied it closely. “Why,” he
exclaimed after a few minutes, the
treasure is hidden by the Three
Rocks.”
“Let us hurry then,” Katie said.
“Our cars will be there, too.”
But a week went by before the
Three Rocks were reached. And
still another week passed before
they found the treasure. It was in
two big leather bags, which Katie
and Jimmy tied to the backs of
their cars. Katie’s car was blue,
and Jimmy’s red. They thought
this was strange, for blue and red
were their favourite colours. Then
they journeyed homeward once
more. Soon, Gum Town was
reached and left behind as they


sped on through the bush. Then,
late one afternoon, the bears drove
into their own village. How excited
their friends and relations were
when they arrived.
Of course, Katie and Jimmy gave
the money to their parents, who
became the richest families for
miles around. The bears learned that
the pirates’ boat had sunk and
the pirates had been drowned. They
jumped for joy when they heard
this, because they could no longer
hurt anyone else.
So ends the story of Katie and
Jimmy. They lived well and happily
in their own village, but though
they often planned it, they never did
go adventuring again.
