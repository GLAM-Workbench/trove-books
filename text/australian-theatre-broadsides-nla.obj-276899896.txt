CAST OP CHARACTERS.
Not cast of characters, for most of them are’more original than the originals ever dared dream of being.
Evangeline, the heroine . (Victim of an enduring affection that very nearly proves her ruin)
... ... Miss Fannie Liddiard
Eulalie, her confidante. {Confidently hoping for Woman’s rights) ... ... Miss Agnes Paul

aquaintance) ... ... ... ... ... ... Miss Ray Talbot

Le Blanc the notary, (Although not ary coroner, in quest of some body, and led to
believe there’s a great deal in a name) ... ... Mr. John Gourlay

rate him as good in-voice, * ... ... Miss Virginia Earl
Felician, Eulalie’s sweetheart. (A dashing young lover) ... ... ... Miss Eileen Karl
The Lone Fisherman, a mystery, ... ... ... ... Mr. Joseph Harris

by his daughter, Eva) ... ... ... ... Mr. Henry Hodson

Don’t flatter yourself that there are omissions in the cast of characters. If it were desired to fill up the programme
with aristocratic names of persons who act as peasants, soldiers, villagers, fishermen, Indians, Savages, etc., etc., etc,,
who drink nothing with gusto, out of pasteboard goblets, and who thrust gilt-headed spears into one another’s
backs while marching out of time,—this could be done ; but they are too numerous to mention, and [in the choruses]
will speak for themselves.
THE LIVELY WHALES.— THE HEIFEiTdANCE.- THeTgRAND TRUNK’IttNALE.-THE
DIAMOND FIELDS-THE DESCENT OF THE BALLOON - THE GRAND MARCH OF
AMAZONS (The most absolutely Unique and Superb Costumes ever Designed).
And the World-Wide Identity, "THE LONE FISHERMAN.”
The Composer, MR. EDWARD E. RICE , will conduct the Orchestra.
The Mechanism by Mr. B. Cahill and Assistants I The Lime Light Effects by Mr. Baker and Assts-
-Ihe Properties by ... Mr. Hewitt and ~ | The Military Uniforms by Lincoln, Stuart and Co-
The Costumes for this production excel in COST, NOVELTY, BEAUTY and Harmony of colour
any ever witnessed in Australia.

Girls get their dues like other people.

than the beautiful girl gets for her
beauty.

My dear Sir,—lf my testimony to the value of your

severely for a long time past—indeed to such an extent
that my means of livelihood have often been jeopardised.

paralysis, I think the doctor calls it of the optic nerve)
and. severe inflammation of the second coating. About 6
weeks ago I had a very bad attack. One eye was so
a nd so exceedingly painful that I could
not bear the faintest light, or even obtain rest in the
daric. 1 tried all manner of nostrums without benefit till
m ®. a bottle of the Lotion, which I used according

V? less than twenty-four hours all pain had
Beforethreedays’ use the eye was completely
recovered, the mflamation subsided, and the sight was, if
anything, stronger than previously. Those persons with
whom 1 was stopping at the time were quite surprised at
the cure, which they regarded as little short of miracu-
lous, toi, indeed, I was in a most pitiable condition. At
Fnflnnlm whenever I feel the slightest symptoms of
inflammation, I apply the Lotion freely, and the effect is
always the same. Partly in gratitude to you, and partly
m the interests of others similarly afflicted, I send you

it be distinctly understood tha
t his is no scheme of quackery to draw
money out of the afflicted, nor is it any
sort of a patent medicine humbug, since
there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Not-
withstanding this fact, it takes directly
hold of the worst cases of constipation,
dyspepsia, liver complaints, headaches,
heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the
kidneys, including fevers and inflam-
mation of the lungs, and of other
internal organs —not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by
radically neutralising and removing
their causes, thus alloioing nature her-
self to do her work unimpeded .
We now simply repeat that the new
treatment acts so radically and funda-
mentally upon the vital circulation
without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a
form of disease that flesh is heir to,
which will not be affected favourably
to the patient by an intelligent use of
this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are
obliged to require a “ Pledge of Honor ”

or reveal its contents outside of their
own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which
our just rights in the discovery can be
maintained. Doctors, of course, who
purchase the pamphlet are not debarred
from uping the treatment in their prac-
tice, providing they do not show the
book, or make known to anyone the
rationale of the treatment

NEWS!!
NO MORE MEDICINE. NO DOCTORS’ BILLS.
Sickness cured, Health preserved, and Life prolonged by Dr. A. Wilford
Hall’s great Hygienic discovery.
The treatment disclosed is unfolded in the “ Health-Pamphlet,”—a condensed prescription of 48
pages. To read and study this pamphlet is to gain a fund of physiological, pathological, and
therapeutical knowledge that a hundred times the cost of the pamphlet would not purchase from its
owner, could it be given hack and blotted from his memory.

DR. R. P. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was
the first M.D. to whom we revealed the
new treatment—more than 20 years ago.
In writing to a friend, about a year ago,
he gives the following :
*****“ Nearly twenty years ago
in this city Dr. A. Wilford Hall gave
me privately a detailed history of a
hygienic treatment he had discovered
and adopted some twenty years before,
and which he had practised continuously
upon himself up to that time. The
history included an account of the
failure of his health, the reasonings
and conclusions which led him to adopt
the treatment, his rapid restoration to
health, &c. From the time of his first
mention of it to me I have been
entirely satisfied that it saved him from
a lingering consumption and death;
and that in the years following, as I
have evidence to satisfy me, its con-
tinued practice has so affected the
nutrient and eliminating functions as
to give to his physical structure a
greater degree of solidity, or, in other
words, a higher specific gravity than
that possessed by any other man living.
I learn that he has persistently con-
tinued the treatment to the present
time —forty years in all—and that his
present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the
“ bloom of youth,” though he is nearly
seventy years of age. The tests I have
made of the treatment upon myself and
in my practice in the twenty years past,
have convinced me that great practical
benefit may be derived by members of
the medical profession and others from
a careful study of the rationale of the
treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall,
the details of which he proposes to give
in his forthcoming book. A debt of
gratitude will surely be due him for
whatever scientific advances he may
be able to unfold in the line of assisting
nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.
R. F. STEYENS, M.D.”

it knobm that /or the purpose of obtaining from Dr. A. Wilford Hall the know-
ledge of his hygienic discovery, and for his treatment of health and longevity, with the pamphlet un-
folding the same, I hereby pledge my word and honor not to show the pamphlet nor reveal its contents
to anyone, nor allow it to be seen by any person ; nor will I use the treatment with any others except
the members of my own family, from each of whom a promise shall be exacted not to reveal the
treatment to others.
This pledge does not debar the physician who may purchase the pamphlet from using the
treatment with his patients, provided, however, he does not show the pamphlet nor reveal to them
the rationale of the treatment.

An Irish gentleman having a small
picture-room, several persons desired to
see it at the same time. “ Faith, gentle-
men,” said he, “ if you all go in, it will
not hold you.”
Emphasis.—The force of emphasis in
giving meaning to a sentence is well
illustrated by a brief colloquy we over-
heard between two persons, the other
day. “Do you imagine me a scoundrel,
sir ?” demanded one indignantly.—“ No,’
was the reply, “ I do not imagine you to
be one.”
A Question and Answer. —Question :
If twenty-seven inches of snow gives
three of water, how much milk will a cow
give when fed on rutabaga turnips ?
Answer : Multiply the flakes of snow by
the hairs in the cow’s tail; then divide
the product by a turnip , add a pound of
chalk, and the sum will be the answer.
“You shouldn’t be glutinous, Isaac,”
said Mrs. Partington, as with an anxious
expression she marked a strong convul-
sive effort that young gentleman was
making to bolt the last quarter of a
mince pie. “You shouldn’t be so
glutinous, dear. You must be careful,
or you will get something in your elemen-
tary canal or sarcophagus one of these
days, that will kill you, Isaac.”
