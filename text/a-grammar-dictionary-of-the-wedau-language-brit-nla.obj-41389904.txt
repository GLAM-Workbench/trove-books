PREFACE.
An edition of the Wedau Dictionary was printed four years
ago; but the Grammar used until now has been copied out by
hand as required. For this edition the Dictionary has been
revised and enlarged, and the Grammar has been entirely
re-written. Neither is supposed to be complete. But they are
as complete and correct as it has been possible to make them, and
it may be a long time before circumstances allow’ of my giving
much more study to them. After all, no Grammar is intended
to supersede the study of the language at first hand, from the lips
of those to whom it is their mother tongue. Rules are useful, so
long as they yield to experience. But a living language must be
learnt from living lips. With this proviso, this book should be
useful to those who desire to learn the Wedau language.
The people, to whom this is the native tongue, are those who
live on the shores of Bartle Bay, on the North-East coast of British
New Guinea. There are three villages: Wedau, Wamira, and
Divari. There are variations in the vocabulary, even in these
villages; some are noted in the following pages; they are most
likely due to the system by which a word drops out of use if it
resembles the name of a deceased friend. The dialect spoken to
the east of Cape Frere is slightly [different, and from village to
village it gradually merges into the Taupotan dialect. On the
other hand, the dialects spoken by the hill tribes at the back of
Bartle Bay, and along the coast range to the West, are very
distinct, as is also the Boianai language, spoken twelve miles along
the coast. But Wedau is spoken by many in all these villages,
who use their own language with their own people, and it is
understood by many who do not speak it.


Philologists will notice that this falls very decidedly into the
group of Melanesian dialects. The terminal Possessive to nouns
of a certain class, and the verbal particles indicative of tense and
mood, are striking characteristics of this group ; so are also the
verbal particles, causative and other, which modify the meaning
of the root. So far as our present knowledge extends, these
marks are found along the North-East Coast as far as the Bight
of Collingwood Bay, though not necessarily in all the intervening
dialects. It is thus an easy dialect for other natives within that
extent of coast line to learn, when once they are associated with
those who speak it. And having been learnt thoroughly by a
foreigner, on his arrival in New Guinea, the knowledge of it should
be of great assistance in his acquiring any other dialect of the
group in any place in which he may subsequently find himself.
I have to acknowledge the receipt of much help from my
fellow missionaries, and from the study of other Island Grammars
which have been printed, and also from those who have read over
my proof sheets, and given me many valuable suggestions.

GRAMMAR.
THE ALPHABET.
V OWELS : a, e, i, o, u.
These have the Continental sound.
A, is long; as in dmd, armlet,
short; as in a'tndna, father,
very short; as in kdmkam, fowl.
E, I, U are long or short.
0, is long; as in tom, sugar cane,
short; as in pompom, all day.
sounded like or, long; as in olaga, watch house.
short; as in odam, tinder.
Whenever two vowels come together, the proper force of each
is given; e.g., au is pronounced like the English ow in cow.
Consonants ; h, d, g, k, I, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w.
These are named as follows : Hi, Di, Gi, Ke, La, Mo, Nu, Pi,
Qa, 80, Sa, Ti, Vi, Wo.
D before i, is pronounced like ds or j. The j sound occurs
before no other vowel.
G has two sounds—the ordinary hard g, and the Melanesian, or
guttural, g. This is similar to the pronunciation in modern
Greek of the letter “gamma” before “a” or “o,” When possible,
this second g is distinguished by being printed in italics, or by
being written with two dots over it. In this Grammar, where
the native words are in italics, this g is printed in Roman type.
L, to be pronounced properly, requires the tongue to be brought
between the lips.
Q requires no u after it.
S is not used in native words, except as a call, “ S,” and in words
derived from this, e.g., visimna.
T before i is pronounced ts.
Gw is treated as if it were a single consonant.
M is the only consonant which can end a syllable.
ACCENT.
The accent is generally on the penultimate, as maiteni.
Sometimes it is on the ante-penultimate, as awdrina.
Sometimes it is on the final diphthong, as ravidi.
In long words, more accents than one are required.
5


THE ARTICLE.
There is no indefinite article.
The definite article, or distinguishing adjective, is expressed by
the termination na to the noun. It is required ;
1. In consecutive sentences, referring to a preceding noun—
Ravana, the person spoken of.
2. In relative sentences —
Ravana e nene lana, the man who came.
Ravana u inainanaia, the man whom you saw.
The plural of ravana is ravai, but in all other words other than
the names of people, the simple form, without any termination,
is used in the plural.
THE NOUN.
A — The simple root may be a noun ;
Bada, master.
Two or more roots may be compounded;
Ini-viara, pain.
The verbal form may also be used in a substantival sense;
Aiai i vunua 1 who was the murderer 1
This is, properly, the verb in its intransitive form.
But, sometimes, this form may take a Preposition :
Au i big a, in the evening.
B— Substantives are formed from verbal roots, as follows ;
I.—Expressive of Person.
1. By prefixing tau to the intransitive stem.
Taunola, labourer, agent.
These nouns are unchangeable in number and person
2. By prefixing tau and adding na to the transitive verb
with its terminal object.
Taumaenina, resident.
Mara Taumaenina , the dweller in the Heavens.
Taunoleina, constructor.
These are unchangeable in number and person.
3. By reduplicating, and adding na to the intransitive
stem.
Maemaena, a fixture, permanency.
Morumoruna, liar.
This termination changes according to the person and
number.
Morumorum, you are a liar.
6
Grammar.


ll.—Expressive of Instrument, Place or Abstract Ideas.
1. By prefixing ami to the stem.
Anipeu, stumbling block.
Aniba, surprise.
Anilawana, means of safety, life.
Anivomairi, insurrection.
2. By prefixing ani and adding na to the stem.
Anihana, cause of surprise.
Anilawanana, salvation.
Anivomairina, resurrection.
3. By adding na to the stem.
Rauwelarina, temptation.
C —An important group of nouns are those of close possession or
relationship, which take the personal possessive pronoun
suffixed.
Alou, my mother.
Alom, thy mother.
Alona, his mother.
Aloai, our mother (exclusive); i.e., not your mother.
Alota, our mother (inclusive); i.e., your mother and mine.
Alotni, your mother.
Aloi, their mother.
Many nouns take these terminal possessives or not, according
to the sense in which they are used.
Kolau, my head.
Au kola, the head which I own.
Au tawara, my feather ornaments.
Kiu fawarana, the bird’s feathers.
In compound nouns the possessive is placed only at the end of
the last noun.
Ura gigiu, my fingers.
Many nouns of relationship cannot be used without the terminal
possessive.
An irregular noun is G arinei.
Gariuei, my property.
G arimei, thy property.
G arinei, his property.
G arielai, our property (exclusive).
G aritaiei, our property (inclusive).
G arimiei, your property.
Gariei, their property.


NUMBER.
Most nouns denoting persons, other than those formed from
verbal roots, form their plural by reduplication.
Alona, his mother; alolona, his mothers.
Novuna, his sister ; novunovuna, his sisters.
Bada, master: babada, masters.
Wavine, woman, makes its plural Waivine, women.
In some cases, different words are used.
Tevera, child, younger brother or sister;
Roaroa, children, younger brothers or sisters.
Oroto, man; nelara, men.
The number in all other words must be understood from the
context.
RENDER.
Nouns have no generic inflections. In speaking of people, some
words are common, e.g., rava; at other times different words are
used.
Oroto, a man; wavine, a woman.
Koko, a boy; kukuma, a woman.
It is advisable not to use the word Koko.
For other animals and for certain trees, the adjectives orotona,
wavinena, are used when required.
CASE.
Genitive and Dative. —Nouns of close possession take the
terminal possessive in the principal word, which follows the
qualifying word.
Numa aina, the wood of the house.
Ai Humana, the wood house.
The preposition au, when required, must immediately precede
the principal noun
Numa au aina, in the wood of the house.
Otherwise, the ordinary possessive pronoun is used.
Alou ana lam, my mother’s food, or, food for my
mother.
Ablative. —The sense of by, with, or from is expressed by the
suffix ei.
Waei, by boat.
Tepanei, by the upper path.
Dimdimei, in the foreigners’ way.
Tamatei, from the hills.


Vocative.— The vocative is sometimes expressed by 0 after the
name. More often the simple name is sufficient.
When nouns of close possession or relationship are modified by
adverbs, the terminal possessive is carried on to the end of the
adverb.
Tura kauau, my true friend.
Amaoiu, my real father.
Names of plants reduplicated, denote the wild varieties.
Akoakova, the wild banana.
THE ADJECTIVE.
Adjectives are formed from the verb root by adding na to the
root, with or without some alteration in the root, e.g. :
I tupo, it is short. Tupona, short.
I manawa, it is long. Manamanaina, long.
I maga, there are many. Magamagauna, many.
Adjectives are also formed from nouns, verbs and adjectives, by
prefixing ana and adding na.
Tupo, (see above). Anatupona, short.
Boruma, brightness. Anahorumana, glorious.
Mogu, to be in mourning. Anamoguna, in mourning.
The Adjective follows the word it qualifies, and agrees with it
in number and person, taking the same pronominal suffixes.
Rava gaegaena, a big man.
Rava gaegaei, some big men.
Taumi roaroa aburumi, you little ones.
Alou keikeina, my little mother, i.e., my mother’s
younger sister.
When the Preposition au is required, it immediately precedes
the adjective, thus following the noun.
Numa au ahwruna, into the small house.
When two nouns occur without any inflection, the former is
qualified by the latter adjectivally.
Numa doa, a house on the ground.
Adjectival Prefixes modify the sense of the word.
Maga, (see above). Vomagauna, a small number.
I poi, it is dried up. Poina, dried up.
G oupoipoina, faded.
There is no comparison of adjectives, e.g. :
Aburuna, small, is used to mean the smaller of the two.
Gaegaena, large, will mean the larger of the two.

i, Him, her, or to him, to her.
ai, lai, Us, to us (exclusive).
ta, Us, to us (inclusive).
mi, You, to you.
i, Their.
If the verb root ends in e, the objectival suffix of the first plural
exclusive is lai ; otherwise, it is ai.
I verelai, he gave to us.
Examples of the use of these will be found under the verbs.
It must be distinctly understood that these subjectival and
objectival pronominal forms are never used apart from their verb,
and that the finite verb is never used without the former, and the
transitive verb is never used without the latter, in the number
and person required.
IY.—The Terminal Possessives to nouns of close possession
or relationship are :
u, My.
m. Thy.
na, His, her, its.
ai, iai, lai, Our (exclusive).
ta. Our (inclusive).
mi, Your.
i, Their.
If the substantival root ends in a, the terminal possessive is iai.
If the root ends in e, the terminal possessive is lai.
Amaiai, our Father.
Aelai, our legs.
Examples of these will be found under the nouns.
V.—Demonstrative Pronouns.

These words require a terminal na (i in the plural), to their
nouns when expressed.

Ablatival forms :
Weiei, By this.
Lamnei, By that.


VI. —lnterrogative Pronouns.
Aiai? Who?
Aiatam ? Who? 2nd Person : Who art thou ?
One word is apparently a compound interrogative :
Aiavoi 1 What tribe !

follows :
Aiwaiu ? What part of me ?
Aiwaim ? What part of thee ?
Aiwaina ? What of it ?
Metauna ? Which one of two or more ?
Metauwi ? Which ones of several ?
Compare the Negative forms :

Ega biaga, None.
(The word biaga means, How many ?)
VII. Substitutive Pronouns.
Nam, So and so.
Niame, Such and such a thing.
THE VERB.
The points to notice about the verb are: —
1. The Subjectival Prefix, in the finite verb.
2. The Ohjectival Suffix, in the transitive verb.
3. The two Particles na and ta.
4. The use of Reduplication, and the method of forming the
Relative.
5. The method of compounding verbs with other verbs, and
with adverbs,
6. Verbal Prefixes.
I.— Subjectival Prefixes.
These have been given under the pronouns.
The Imperative Singular Prefix is Ma.
The form with Ma is used instead of the 2nd Singular Future.
The 2nd Plural Future is used for the Imperative Plural.


11. Suffixes.
These have been given under the pronouns.
The object may be direct or indirect. The indirect (personal)
object may be used with verbs which ordinarily take a direct
object, by changing the terminal vowel of the verbal root, e.g. :
Ma votikai, tear it.
Ma votikeu, tear it for me.
Nawala i tonai, he speared a wallaby.
Aiera au doa i tonei, he thrust the spear into the
ground.
N.B.—Sometimes even when the object is expressed, and often
when it is not, the verb retains its intransitive form.
Piramatu i lauluana, they were catching whitebait.
111. —The Particles.
The particles come between the subjectival prefix and the finite
verb.
ms, indicates future time.
to, indicates suggestion or possibility, and is required with a
negative in present or past time.
IV. —Reduplication.
Reduplication is of one or two syllables. It implies continuous
or repeated action, and thus is used to express the Present Tense.
But the same form is used in past and future time, and even with
to, when the sense is required of a action done repeatedly, or of
the continuance of a state, but it is not used when the verb has
an adjectival sense, e.g. :
A matamatave, I am lying down, but
A matamatave da i nei, I was lying down when he
came.
A ta matamatave da i ta nei, if I were always to be lying
down when he came.
On the other hand :
I biga, it is soft.
I oira, it is slippery, &c.
The verb in the Relative sentence is also reduplicated. It also
changes its termination, as follows :
Transitive verbs change the 3rd Person Objectival suffix to ia.
Intransitive verbs suffix lana.
Kalo tevera a verevereia, the toy which I gave the child.
Dobuna a mamae lana, the country in which I lived.


V. —Compounds.
Two verbs may be compounded by juxtaposition. They are
then treated as one verb, preceded by the Subjectival Prefix, and
particle as required ; only one Reduplication is required ; and the
Objectival Suffix comes at the end of the compound verb. The
same rule applies when an adverb modifies a verb.
In Composition, Intransitive verbs, except those in ni, remain
unchanged.
I tou mara, he cried all night.
Transitive verbs whose third singular is in ei, change ei to ana.
I riwei, he told him.
I riwana girigiriei, he told him repeatedly.
Those in ni, gi, change i to a : those in ni, oi, and many in ni,
drop the i.
I taini, he pulled it.
I taina tuini, he pulled it in two.
I fund, he covered it up.
I puru kauei, he covered it up thoroughly.
Exceptions— Bahani, Mairi, remain unchanged.
VT.— Verbal Prefixes.
These are; — Ai, Am,, An, Go, Ha'll, Ravi, Tn, Tape, Tavi,
Tu, Tupa, Vi, Viai, Viam, Vo, Vovai, Warm.
Some of these are adverbial in sense.
Ai, first.
Aigeta, to come hither.
Au, hither.
Augetai, to come hither.
Tu, with a poking motion, or with the foot.
Tugwadai, to trample on, to crush,
Tupa, poking a hole in.
Tupatawanei, to open a box.
Vo, with the hands.
Vogarai, to dig with the hands.
Vo also modifies the meaning of the root;
Vomairi, to stand up.
Vohagihagi, stiff.


Some are conditional in sense.
Rau,
Raukarei, to commence, set oneself to work.
Rau has also a Passive signification,
Rauqatuei, to be invited.
Ravi, Ta, Tape, of touching,
Tapotai, to close.
Tapekaririei, to push.
Some are causative, and make an intransitive verb transitive,
Vi,
Vinolei, to cause to work.
Vikarei, to make a commencement at.
Vi, before a noun, signifies to become,
Vibada, to become a chief, to take authority
upon oneself.
Vi can thus be used before a phrase,
A na vi-mai-Wedau, I shall become a Wedauan.
Vi, with reduplication of the root, signifies : to make a game
of, to do repeatedly,
Vivoevoe, to paddle about,
Vinolanola, to announce.
Vi is also used with the termination, lana, or ana,
Vinelana, to go.
Vitouana, to lament
Vi and Vo, with reduplicated roots, may be transitive or intran-
sitive. Sometimes the latter part of the root is reduplicated. If
the root ends in a, intransitively, the first a becomes e when, by
the verb becoming transitive, the second a becomes ei; e.g.,
Vinolanola, to make an announcement, becomes Vi-
nolenolei, to announce to.
Votelatela, to be obedient, becomes Voteletelei, to obey.
Viai,
Viaigeboi, to break to shreds.
Viam, to do repeatedly.
Viamparipari, to go about hitting people.
Vovai,
Vovaididimani, to straighten.


A Passive prefix is Wana. This is only used with verbs of
breaking,
Wanohauni, to be pierced.
In Reduplication the first two letters only are repeated, except
with Tupa, Wana, Tavi, Tape.
The Paradigm of the Intransitive Verb is as follows;
Peu, to fall.
Verbal Nouns: Peu, Peuna.
Past Time.
A peu, I fell.
U peu, Thou fellest.
I peu, He, she, it fell.
A peu, We (exclusive of the person

fell.
0 peu, Ye fell.
1 peu. They fell.

Dobuna a peupeu lana, The place where I fell.
U peupeu lana, When or where thou fellest.
I peupeu lana, When or where he fell, or, the man
who fell.
E peupeu lana, As he was falling.
For such Relative sentences in the Future time, the Future
Tense as above is used, with a co-ordinate conjunction.
Imperative.
Ma peu, Fall, or thou wilt fall.
0 na peu, Fall ye, or ye will fall.
In the Transitive Verb, the object is added as a suffix.
U vereu. Thou gavest to me.
A verem, I gave to thee.
A verei, I. gave to him.
U verei, Thou gavest to him.
1 vereu, He gave to me.
I verem, He gave to thee.
I verei, He gave to him.
and so on through the other tenses.
The Relative of the Transitive Verb is as follows: —
A vereverem, Which I gave to thee, or When I
gave to thee.
A verevereia, Which I gave to him or them, or
when I gave to him or them.
(fee., <fec., &c.
Reflexive Verbs are those which take the Objectival Suffix of
the same Person as the Subjectival Prefix,
A araramaniu, I understand.
A verb becomes reflexive in signification by the addition of the
adverb, melei,
I ruta melei. He shot himself.
A verb takes a Reciprocal signification by the addition of the
adverb, viviri,
I inana viviri, They looked at each other.


The Negative Adverb takes ta in the Present and Past.
Ega a ta peu, I did not fall.
Ega noka ita mae, He is not there, or was not there.
Defective Verbs.
A pamina, I thought.
U pamina, Thou thoughtest.
&c. &c.
This is only used in Past Time.
A pa, I said.
U pa, Thou saidst.
Ma pa, Say.
A na pa, I shall say.
&c. &c.
This is not used in Present Time. It is generally enclitic,
following verbs of speech.
THE ADVERB.
Adverbs are of two kinds :
I. Those which stand independently.
11. Those which modify verbs, nouns, adverbs and adjec-
tives terminally.
The method of adding the terminal adverb to the verb, and of
transferring the objectival suffix to the end of the adverb has
already been shown. Similarly, adverbs modifying nouns require
the terminal Possessive to be transferred to the end of the adverb.
Amct-oi-u, my real father.
Adverbs of Place.
Weka, here.
Wekei, hence.
Noka, there.
Nokei, thence.
Nore, there, at a distance.
Kampa, there.
Ananoi, there.
Mepa ? where ?
Terminal adverb; —
ai, hither.
This does not require the Objectival Suffix to be transferred.
Ma riweiai, tell him to come hither.
Some Adverbs of Place are nouns with the Preposition au,
Au tano, outside.
Au aidamo, above.


Adverbs op Time.
Marina , now,
Amadodo, today.
Pom, yesterday.
Pomota, some time ago.
Borova, formerly.
Wariaga a long time ago.
Melanai 1 when 1
Memarana ? on what day '!
Muriai, afterwards.
Amapo, by and bye.
Maranai, when (in relative sentences).
Terminal adverbs:
me, memei, melei, again.
nonoa, for ever.
nonoei, beforehand.
mara, all night.
pompom, all day.
guhai, for a short time.
pora, for a long time.
Adverbs op Manner.
Nanare, Wenanare, thus.
Menanare ? how 1
Aiwaiei ? by what means ?
Anina, enough, really, truly, yes.
Avena, forbidden.
Terminal adverbs.
kaua, with suffix kauei, thoroughly.
pai, with suffix paiei, completely.
gaga, with suffix gagalei, extremely.
ava, with suffix avei, in vain.
hoaboa, with suffix hoai, badly.
guratana, with suffix guratei, vigorously.
labalababa, with prefix labalababei, ordinarily.
legal, completely.
vorovei, to an end.
lavalava, in case.
ota, ordinarily.
oi, really.
Adverb expressing doubt, in answer to a question.
Tiate, I don’t know.


Negative Adverbs.
Ega, no, not (followed by the verbal
particle ta).
Ega teni, certainly not.
Ega mepa, nowhere.
Ega melanai, never.
Ega aiwaiei, in no way.
Note. —lf a question is asked in the negative, the response
answers the question as asked rather than the idea in the mind
of the speaker, e.g., Turam ega uta ravi ho 1 Surely you did not
hit your friend 1 The answer is : Anina; tauna ega ata ravi.
Yes, I did not hit him, or Ega, turau a ravi, No; I really did
hit my friend.
THE PREPOSITION.
There are only three prepositions :
1. Awarina, in company with.
This takes the terminal Personal Pronoun in agreement with
its governed noun expressed or understood.
Awariu, with me.
Awarim, with thee,
Awarina, with him.
Awariai, with us (exclusive).

when that is expressed : it must be so expressed if in the Third
Person.

This is also partially declined.

The difference of signification depends on the point of view.

this Prepositional phrase follows its governed noun.

THE CONJUNCTION.
1. Ma, Da, and.
Da is used for a closer connection than Ma. As there are no
dependent sentences, all verbs must be joined by the copulative.
The co-ordinate sentences are placed in order of time.
A riwei da i nei, I told him to come.
A qatuem da u nei, you came because I called you.
In a long list of words joined by conjunctions, the Conjunction
follows each word, including the last on the list, and is itself
followed by the word nanare.
2. 80, or.
This also follows each of the alternative words in a list.
In Conditional sentences the Conjunction is ma or da, and both
verbs take the same tense.
A ta riwem da u ta nei, if I told you, you would come.
Ega ana nae ma ana irage, I shall die if I don’t go.
The Adversative is Ega da, but even if. This is also used as
an Adversative between two nouns.
Ega da tau, ega da tarn, if not I, then you.
3. Mote, Dote, Wate.
INTERJECTIONS.
Aio ! Ame ! Expressing surprise or distress. These take the
accent on the ultimate.
Mho ! Expressing satisfaction.


ORDER OF WORDS.
The order of words in a simple sentence is,
Subject, direct object, indirect object, verb,
But the order is changed for emphasis.
There being no distinction of case, and the order changing for
emphasis, the sentence is sometimes ambiguous.
Bada laraga i tonai, the chief killed a young man ; or, it
was a chief that the young man
killed.
The Interrogative comes last, or immediately before the verb,
Nam mepa 1 where is so and so 1
Turam aiwai u verei, what did you give your friend 1
The following is peculiar :
Davida Solomona natuna, Solomon was the son of David.
