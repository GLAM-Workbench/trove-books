SKETCHED ON WADE HALF TONE BOARD No. 658. ORIGINAL DRAWING 9 INS. WIDE REPRODUCED AS SINGLE SHOT LINE ETCHING.


WADE HALF-TONE BOARDS
THERE are scraper boards and scraper boards! —there
always have been scraper boards, ever since Adver-
tising was an infant! —but never has there been a
scraper board with a moulded HALF-TONE surface.
Untrammelled by precedent, limitless in potentiality, Wade
Series of Half-Tone Boards is, unquestionably, the most
advanced contribution to the Advertising and Graphic Arts
fields!
Wade Half-Tone Boards are entirely new! Distinctly
different —Revolutionary! They enable you to produce
original and beautiful illustrations endowed with new
Half-Tone and novelty effects of a quality and technique
far exceeding in brilliance anything that has ever been
obtained by the old wash-drawing method —that can, in
fact, be obtained in no other way at all!
EASY TO WORK WITH!
Artists sketch on Wade Half-Tone Boards just as they
would on any drawing paper, but the vital part about
Wade Half-Tone Board is that highlights, light tones, dark
tones, lines and solid blacks go right down on the original
drawing!—in the exact strength in which they are wanted!
There is no guess-work!—no uncertainty!—Artists can be
confident that the exact strength of every ingredient will
be just the same when reproduced.
COMBINATION LINE AND HIGH-
LIGHT HALF-TONE EFFECTS AT
OtJmaty gf-Lne C-tcltuttj dvzls !
Highlight Half-Tone effects —even combination Line and
Highlight Half-Tone effects —all can now be worked into
the one drawing—and reproduced as a single shot line
etching! No expensive Half-Tone Highlights!—No costly
combinations! —No extravagant stipplings!
Throughout this Book are dramatic examples of the super
quality of the illustrations that can be obtained on Wade
Half-Tone Boards. They have "Life" and "Class"! They
are distinctive! Rich in technique! Modern! Eye-
appealing! Sales-appealing! They possess all the
qualities of combination line and highlight half-tones. Yet
they are all straight out single line etchings, costing much
less than Half-Tone and Stipple engravings! SAVINGS
MOUNT AS HIGH AS 50% —and in some cases, even more.
Wade Half-Tone Boards retain their pure photographic
whiteness in all climatic conditions. They never "yellow"
or discolor, and bend them how you will, they never crack
or lose their perfection of "surface". Wade Half-Tone
Boards, comprising eleven distinctly different surfaces, are
packed separately in glassine envelope with full
instructions how to use!
IT'S THE RESULT THAT COUNTS—USE WADE HALF-TONE BOARDS

WADE HALF-TONE BOARDS
are recommended by leading artists as the
simplest method to obtain perfect Half-Tone
and Line effects. To obtain best results, use
a Swan Photo Spotting Pencil No. 2 on all
Wade Half-Tone Boards except Nos. 32 and
45. Dust all work lightly with cotton wool
while in progress! This is important! For
Wade Half-Tone Boards Nos. 32 and 45 a
Staedtler Glassochrom (Extra) is recom-
mended! DO NOT dust work when using
the last-named pencil.

TO OBTAIN BEST RESULTS
WADE HALF-TONE BOARDS
These instructions should be carefully followed and practised, and it would be
helpful to study each specimen illustration with its corresponding printed pattern.
1. Prepare all work on tracing paper first, then trace down,
thus avoiding unnecessary pencilling and rubbing out on
actual board. Ink in according to usual practice, either with
pen or brush. Even on the coarsest texture board, clean lines
can be easily achieved —note the lines in illustrations.
2. When reverse effects are necessary—as shown in printed
pattern of board accompanying each illustration —make certain
that ink or lamp black is thoroughly dry before scraping.
3. It is MOST IMPORTANT to use the correct pencil specified
—SWAN No. I PHOTO SPOTTING PENCIL! And because this
pencil is composed of carbon compound, it is necessary to
dust all work, while in progress, with cotton wool to remove
all surplus carbon deposit from between dots and lines. Do
not have the point of the pencil too sharp—note illustration —•
just sufficiently blunt to ride on the top of the card pattern.
4. Wade Half-Tone Boards, Nos. 45 and 32,
have been manufactured especially so that
perfect gradations and mouldings can be
achieved (see illustrations pages 13, 14, 15
and 18). On these two boards—and these only
—a Staedtler Glassochrom (Extra) is recom-
mended, because of its extreme density and
softness. This pencil is composed of a grease
compound. So DO NOT DUST, and do not
use this pencil on any other board.
5, Nos. 658 and 308 have one printed line surface with three
latent images: (a) the invisible line which appears when
pencil is applied, (b) the invisible dot which appears when
printed line is scraped, (c) the invisible line which appears
when inked in then scraped. (Note the illustrations on pages
1,3, 8,9, 10, 11, 12 and 24). These boards would appear to
confuse the vision when the artist first commences to work on
♦hem, but this effect soon disappears. It is an eye exercise
rather than a fatigue, giving results and effects no other known
orocess can give. They are fascinating and a delight to work.
Paint out large areas rather than scrape them. Results obtain-
able on these boards are truly astounding.
S. No matter what the medium is in which your illustration
is to appear, the one main essential is reproductive qualities!
Wade Half-Tone Boards guarantee good results. Care, clean-
liness, density of dots and lines are main factors. Imperfect
dots will not reproduce. With very little practice one becomes
quickly proficient in the use of Wade Half-Tone
Board, and is able to produce new, modern effects ,
with speed, economy, clarity of reproduction and
above all, "the result that counts."
THE PENCIL should be sharpened so that
it rides easily on the top of the pattern.
THE SCRAPER— Use a Wade Half-Tone
Scraper, obtainable at all Artist Suppliers.
