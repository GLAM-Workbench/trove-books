THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY* SERVICE, LEICHHARDT.
To the Citizens of Leichhardt.—
The National Emergency Service has been inaugurated in this
Municipality not in the belief that an Air Attack is expected, but we
cannot ignore the fact, nor take the risk of such an attack without
being prepared.
Now is the time, while we have peace, to organise such a service
to minimise the consequence of any such attack however remote it
may be.
This organisation, trained as it is for the above service, would
also be an asset to the State in combating any National disaster.
All the members of this organisation give their service voluntarily.
There are no paid positions. 1 ask you one and all to give this organisa-
tion all the support that is within your power.
When a Warden calls for information please receive him with
courtesy as the information he seeks will be compiled for your safety.
If an air attack should ever occur I ask you to assist your Warden
by carrying out his instructions. He has been trained to deal with any
emergency that may arise from such a raid. He will instruct you what
to do and where to go.
1 am appealing to every man and woman in the Municipality to
join up with the service and make it 100% efficient.
Classes in First Aid and Air Raid Precautions are held in the Town
Hall every Wednesday evening at 8 p.m.
We are fortunate in this Municipality in having as residents one of
the best equipped instructors in Air Raid Precaution work.

Our instructors in First Aid are men and women who have been
trained under the St. John Ambulance Association and their qualifica-
tions are very high.
There are other classes such as Home Nursing, Mechanics, Car
Driving, etc. These classes do not deal directly with the above service,
but will assist in making Leichhardt well equipped in the case of
emergency.
DETAILS OF ORGANISATION.
This booklet has been prepared so that the residents of Leichhardt
will have some knowledge of the arrangements made for their protec-
tion in the event of any national emergency. PLEASE DO NOT
DESTROY IT BUT KEEP IN A SAFE PLACE FOR READY
REFERENCE.
A complete voluntary scheme for your protection has been organ-
ised, of whom the following is an outline.
A Chief Warden has been appointed by the Minister in charge of
the National Emergency Services, to direct the N.E.S. in this
Municipality.
The Chief Warden has subdivided the Municipality into 9
Divisions and in charge of each he has placed a Senior Warden who
will be responsible for the Wardens’ Services in his Division.
Each Division has been again , subdivided into a number of Sectors,
each Sector being in charge of one or more Wardens, whose Wardens
Post will be respectively the home of the first Warden appointed to each
Sector. Each Wardens’ Post will have a telephone so that any of the
residents may readily get in touch with their Warden.
A map of the Municipality showing the Divisions and Sectors may
be inspected at the Town Hall, Leichhardt.

YOUR DUTY DURING AN AIR RAID.
The people of Leichhaidt can Kelp themselves and save life by
carrying out the following advice:
(1) Keep cool—do not lose your head. Remember, panic-
stricken people may do great damage and cause loss of life.
(2) When an air raid warning is given seek shelter if you are
outside; if in a building remain there.
(3) If driving a vehicle pull m to the left side of the street and
stop. Streets should be kept clear to allow free movement
of Ambulance, Fire Brigade, and other vehicles connected
with the National Emergency Services. If a raid occurs at
night, switch off headlights and tail-lights.
(4) Obey the instructions of the \I/ardens.
(5) Remain indoors until the “all clear signal is given.
(6) Do not attempt to telephone the Ambulance, Fire Brigade, or
Hospital during a raid. If any of these services are required,
the Warden of the Sector will call them.
WAR GASES.
Gases used for war purposes are classified as follows: (a) Tear
gases; (b) nose irritant or sneezing gases: (c) lung-irritant gases, (d)
blister gases.
Note, The respirator or gas mask if worn provides protection
against all these gases.
TEAR GASES.
Cause intense weeping. Not really dangerous. These gases
frighten people they imagine they will go blind, but the effects soon
pass off.

First Aid. —Wash your eyes with a saline, one teaspoonful of
rommon salt to a pint of water.
NOSE OR SNEEZING GASES.
Cause sneezing, pain in teeth and gums, burning sensation in
chest, pains in stomach, intense depression of spirits. Generally recover
in 48 hours. No fatal cases known.
First Aid. —Rest, fresh air. Nasal douching with 1 ounce of
sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to one pint of warm water.
LUNG IRRITANTS.
Chlorine of phosgene main lung gases. Not likely to be used
against civilians. Chlorine a greenish yellow gas with a pungent
Irritating odor. Phosgene smells like musty hay.
First Aid. —Do not allow patients to walk on any account. Avoid
shock. Remove patients on a stretcher. These cases require medical
treatment.
BLISTER GASES.
Two known kinds: Mustard gas and lewisite. Mustard gas is
more likely to be used than Lewisite. Mustard gas is a yellowish oily
liquid which smells like onions or garlic, or horseradish. It vaporises
at ordinary temperatures, and both liquid and vapor are dangerous.
It is absorbed by fats, oils, tar, rubber, and in fact, almost everything
except highly glazed surfaces and metals. The Jiquid may give off
vapor for periods up to three weeks. It attacks the eyes, nose and
throat, digestive system and skin.
First Aid. (I ) Eyes become sore and gritty, may swell, give off
mattery discharge. Wash eyes with warm water, a salt solution, or a
solution of sodium bicarbonate (one teaspoonful to pint of water;
smear a little vaseline over edge of eyelide. DO NOT RUB EYES, DO
NOT BANDAGE.
.... (2) Breathing Passages. —Nose may discharge: throat becomes
sore and dry a hard, dry cough. Those cases should be dealt with by a
medical man. If the case is not a serious one, a nasal douche, using
a salt solution, may be used, or an inhalant made by adding a tea-
spoonful of a mixture of menthol (10 grains) in one ounce of Friar’s
balsam to a pint of boiling water.
Digestive System. —Pains in the stomach and vomiting may occur.
Can be relieved temporarily by draughts of warm bicarbonate of soda
solution (10 grains to a pint of water). These cases should receive
medical treatment.

whole body to enjoy the most beneficial form of complete rest. Re-
member that the rest of your days depends on the rest of your nights.

Skin.—Skin becomes itchy and reddens—in about eight hours it
blisters. Moist areas most affected. If the skin is attacked by vapor,
v/ash the skin with soap and hot water at once. If the skin has been
attacked by liquid mustard gas bleach ointment (two parts bleaching
powder and one part of white vaseline) should be rubbed into the skin
affected and washed off within two minutes. If a paste of bleaching
powder and water (bleaching powder and enough water to make a
paste) can be made available within five minutes the part of the body
should be treated with it, and the paste washed off within two minutes.
In case of Either of above treatments, contaminated persons should be
washed with hot water and soap as quickly as possible.
The First Aid Posts will be equipped to deal with gas casualties,
but the above notes have been written in case you may find it neces-
sary to carry out treatment yourself.
DECONTAMINATION.
AS APPLICABLE TO PERSISTENT BLISTER GASES.
Decontamination is the process by which gases are removed or
rendered harmless, and the following advice in this connection is
mainly intended for the guidance of the householder.
Various factors affect the choice of method, and consideration
must be given to the type of material, extent of contamination, the
degree of danger, the importance of the article, and the material and
facilities available for their treatment.
The methods may be summarised as: Removal of gases, sealing,
destruction of gases, weathering.
REMOVAL.
Removal may be effected by HOSING, care being taken to see
that liquid gas is not splashed by a strong force of water. This method
is only applicable on surfaces that do not absorb quickly, and should
be carried out within five minutes of contamination.
Swabs soaked in SOLVENTS, such as kerosene, petrol, or methy-
lated spirit may be used to remove liquid gas from articles which gas

THE ALBERT PALAIS
"FOR GREAT DANCE ENTERTAINMENT
AT COMMON-SENSE ADMISSION PRICES”
Leichhardt is indeed fortunate to
possess within its boundaries such an
outstanding entertainment organisa-
tion as the ALBERT PALAIS, known
throughout the length and breadth
of Australia as one of it’s
greatest and most popular
dance places. The huge crowds
that throng the Albert Palais
every week from all parts of
Sydney are a great tri-
bute not only to the
Albert Palais itself, but
also to the far-sighted
and progressive policy
under which it is con-
ducted. The policy
of "Great Dance En-
tertainment at Com-
mon Sense Admission
Prices” is one that
must appeal to
everybody, and,
certainly, it is one
that caters for all
sections of the

will not penetrate, or where the penetration would be comparatively
slow, such as polished furniture in good condition.
A further removal process is that of MOPPING. Use rags, cotton
waste, sawdust, earth, etc., and remove to a suitable sealed receptacle.
DESTRUCTION.
BOILING: Clothing and materials, which can normally be boiled,
if affected with liquid gas, can be decontaminated by this means. Boil
in plain water for about one hour.
BURNING: Badly damaged woodwork and materials, which could
not be decontaminated, would have to be destroyed by burning.
In both the boiling and burning process extreme care would need
Lo be exercised, as the steam, fumes, vapour and smoke arising from
these operations would be a source of danger to those in the vicinity.
HOW TO DEAL WITH INCENDIARY BOMBS.
Prompt action to control the spread of fire. Sand can be thrown
on, and around the bomb, and on the floor. The bomb will then expand
most of its energy in heating the sand. If you wish to remove the
bomb, place sand upon the shovel, and with long handled scoop or
rake draw the burning bomb onto the shovel. Place in bucket of sand,
remove to safe place, back yard or somebody else’s garden.
Water can be used to extinguish subsidiary fires caused by the
bomb.
As bombs will burn through ordinary wooden floors, and drop
below it is advisable to have someone in attendance to clear away all
burnable material and be ready to deal with the bomb when it drops

PROTECTION AGAINST HIGH EXPLOSIVES.
In any enemy attack upon Australia, High Explosive Bombs 01
Shells will be used. These are the greatest source ol possible danger
and protection against their effects is not as easy as that for - fire or gas
bombs. As pointed out some buildings offer better protection than
others, so choose a room, if possible, in the centre of a building or
passage way protected by at least one inside and one outside wall. If
the outer wall is damaged the inner wall will probably remain intact.
Ordinary cavity brick walls offer good protection against splinters from
bombs or shells, but offer very little protection against the blast effect
of High Explosive. A standard 5001 b. bomb will destroy an 18 in.
brick wall 50 feet away. Protection against direct hits is a practical
impossibility. Small trenches deep enough for 18in. covering over the
head are ideal protection against anything but direct hits providing they
are far enough away to be clear of collapsing walls or falling bricks.
We advise trenches.
EXTRACT FROM A.R.P.
Thus, as a direct result of sheer neglect and total failure to take
any precautions, loved ones are injured for life, the persons responsible
suffer a life long sense of shame and self reproach, but if the persons
responsible have taken such precautions as are reasonably within their
power, then, even if accidents do happen they have nothing with which
to reproach themselves. In the meantime they will be comforted by the
knowledge that they have contributed to National security, and have
faithfully done their bit.
