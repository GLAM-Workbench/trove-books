HOMO BREAD
PURITY
Public Analyst's Laboratory,
Technical College, Broken Hill
22nd March, 1911
I have analysed samples of the "'Homo'' Bread, and find to
be of very superior quality, both for nutrive value and digestive
properties. It is sweet, tasty, light and soluble, and the crust is
highly dextrinised It has excellent keeping qualities, is remark-
ably free from injurious bacterial growths of "all kinds, and can n
be recommended for those whose digestive organs are impaired. 9
It is the finest example of the breadmaker's art that has come under C
my notice. d

PAINT UP!
Now is the Time
But Use
A man we know, whose house needed painting three years
ago, postponed the matter on the plea that painting was too
expensive. Then , 20/- would have paid for the necessary
Paint. Now , he has to spend several times that amount
replacing decayed woodwork. He could not defy the
elements - " United " Paint does. If you are a house owner,
you cannot defy sun and rain without losing money.
Unless Your Property is Protected
with Paint it will Surely Decay.
" United " Paint is made in South Australia of pure weather-
resisting ingredients that you can thoroughly rely upon.
The timely use of " United " Paint will save you money.
