Gentlemen,
The perusal of the pages of history teaches us that during
many ages, from the time of Ninus the reputed founder of
the great Assyrian Monarchy, to the present, a Martial
spirit has pervaded the human race, and as Potentates good
or bad attained power, this spirit became under their rule
either a blessing or curse to mankind.
Military power has been used in all ages of the world’s
history for aggressive or defensive purposes, when employed
for purposes of aggression it always recoils sooner or later on
the power using it. When used in self defence, it then
becomes a legitimate mode of utilising this latent human
force. As the chief and absolute right of a people, the most
essential on which all other hinges, is that of self-preservation.
History further teaches us that while some warlike nations
under one rule of eminent Military genius, attained by slow-
progressive steps the dignity of great Empires—others by a
species of resistless force attained their Meridian splendour
by rapid strides overcoming all obstacles, like the Avalanche
once set free rends and crushes all that bars its path, or
•stands in the way of its progress. The Assyrian and Baby-
lonian are types of the first class, the Macedonian Empire
under Alexander, and Republican Imperial Rome are types
of the latter class of Empires. Leaving for a moment ancient
history, we find Rome, great mighty Rome under its pagan
and Christian type—the one great link connecting the present
with the past, existing still—but shorn of its Imperial
splendour, telling by its ruins the story of its wondrous rise
and greater fall, while the capitals of its more ancient
compeers are searched for by a Layard and his attendant
Arabs, amid the sand covered mounds of Birs Nomrond and
Belus, and the Sculptures of Nineveh and the winged human
head Bulls of the Assyrian Palaces are all that is left to tell
the glory and grandeur of their early Kings.
And without attempting to recapitulate the story of the
wars during the twenty centuries before the Christian era, with
their successes or reverses—all appears to end alike, each


nation after playing its little part on this world’s stage and
its destined work done, like the brilliant serolite in its path
thro’ space, leaving its faint evanescent train of light, but
bursting, passes at once into darkness for ever. There is no
finality therefore in this mundane state, Nations like the
human race, grow from infancy to manhood, then to old age
and decrepitude, and so pass away.
Further, we find events happening, and men rising to
power when least expected (such as Mahomet), who leave
their impress not only in the nation from which they
sprung, but for all time—this false Prophet, the setter up of
faith and propaganda which became a scourge and terror to
Christendom—so much so that Popes (notably Pius the II.),
Kings and Princes and people joined in one common crusade
for its overthrow, and recovery of the Holy places, without
success—and this power having gained possession of the
fairest portion of Europe, and Constantinople, with its
accummulated wealth of ages, and resplendent with the
monuments of Grecian and Roman Art, remains an example
of what a powerful Military system carried to an extreme by
a nation of sanguinary temperament when tainted by sensu-
ality and luxury, may sink to. This power great in numbers
and actuated by intense fanaticism—but not with the
strength of its youth, is now tottering to its fall—the hand-
writing on the wall has appeared, and Mahommedanism as a
power in Europe will be a thing of the past, a few years may
elapse and tens of thousands will fall before that consum-
mation takes place. The sudden rise and rapid fall of
the great Napoleon, and the miseries entailed on France and
all Europe by his ambition are matters within the personal
knowledge of many now living.
We also find that during periods of apparent repose, the
world suddenly startled up by the throes of revolution and
thunders of war; the years 1789 and 1830 are instances, and
again in 1848, when every nation in Europe became a focus
of rebellion, and every throne but the British tottered or fell,
and then in three short years, in 1851, the nations of Europe
assemble in harmonious concord, to witness at the great
Exhibition the marvels of human ingenuity, science and art
k—such the strange mutability of the human mind. At that


time one idea alone seemed to pervade the minds not only of
the great philanthropists, but the Press of the day, that as
the world became more and more enlightened, and the free
interchange of commodities between nations became more a-
necessity of every-day life, the possibilities of war would
become more and more remote, in fact, the Exhibition “ was
looked upon as the advent of the Millenium” when “ swords
“should be turned into plough shares, and spears into
“ pruning hooks. Nations should not rise against nation,
u neither should they learn war any more.” How rudely
this fond dream was dispelled, let the Crimean Campaign,
the Indian Mutiny, the Taeping Rebellion in China, the
civil War in America, the Austrian and Prench War,
the Prussian and Austrian, and the great Eranco-Prussian
Campaign, with a number of others in rapid succession say.
And still after the hundreds of millions of money wasted,
and the hecatombe of lives lost, during these 25 years, the
rulers of Europe again stand prepared with millions of men
under arms, apparently only too ready to launch them at
each other in bloody conflict, to attain a supremacy, or recover
supremacy lost.
And what are the lessons we should learn from these few
historical facts—that men of an aspiring temperament wish
for, and love power—and that given certain conditions, the
shedding of blood, or the misery of their fellow creatures, will
weigh but as the small dust in the balance in influencing or
retarding their efforts to reach the pinnacle of power. This
we note on a small scale as a constant occurrence in the Isles
of these Southern Seas, where warlike tribes prey on or
subjugate their weaker and moie peaceful fellows. We
further learn that where Empires, Kingdoms or Nationalities
are concerned—no matter how powerful they may become,
or whether their growth be slow or rapid—they possess
within themselves, from the very nature of their constituent
parts (like the human body) the elements of decay, and
disintegration. Great Britain the Empire now on which the
sun never sets—great, powerful, and free, ruled by equity,
justice and truth, the triple cord that alone binds an incongru-
ous mass of people, and nations, and tongues together, that
has existed as a power in Europe since the Norman conquest.


this England that has been subjugating by slow process
India, since Clive’s victory at Plassey, now nearly a century
and a half ago, and has within the last few years culminated
the height of its powers, but having attained that, what
more is left for her to do. When. the nations of Europe were
evenly balanced, and it was desirable to maintain the balance
of power, when England threw her sword into the scale, the
Question was then settled, but we have cause to fear it is not
so now, England still possesses all the elements of a great
nation—an unrivalled commerce—wealth untold—for defen-
sive purposes her fleet superior still to all that floats the seas,
her trained soldiery sufficient for all her home needs—she
Cannot however increase her strength—her power lies within
the seas that laves her shores.
Let us cast our thoughts back a few short years and we
find England in the Crimea, bolstering up this vile Turkish
despotism, (a disgrace to Europe), and then, without a single
hostile ship floating the sea to interfere with her Navy or
Mercantile Marine—nothing to arrest the traffic between
English Ports, and the base of operations at Balaclava in the
Black Sea, by mismanagement and redtapeism the English
troops before Sebastopol were literally perishing in cold,
want, and wretchedness, and only for the generous private
liberality of the people of England, few of the unfortunate
troops serving in the trenches would have survived the
winter of 1854, and as it was, an effective force of even
20,000 men could scarcely be maintained, though the Queen’s
guards and every available soldier was sent to the seat of
war.
And is this the England we are to expect aid from in the
coming struggle of the nations. These are the men of
England, who fought at Cressy and Agincourt, that held the
lines of Torres Yedras, and conquered, thanks to the
Prussians, at Waterloo—but the rulers, how lacking in the
masterly qualifications for holding the helm of State at this
crisis, as there can be no doubt but for the prompt
action of the liberal party in Great Britian, and the
beneficent operation of Abdul Aziz’s scissors, Lord Derby,
and the late Premier, would have plunged England into war
before this. Now, if the action of English Statesmen con-


cemed England alone, we might while regretting, permit a
foolish act to pass unquestioned,—hut plunging England into
war necessarily involves us in war also—one in which we
can have no possible concern—save the misery and trouble
it will entail on us—we are expected I suppose, as a part of
the Empire, some time or other to suffer in person and
pocket-—and there is no help for it—but it seems hard for it
to be so, when we have no voice in the matter, and any
representations we might feel disposed to make would meet
with but scant courtesy from Statesmen whose inclinations
ran counter to our wishes.
It must be apparent therefore, to every thinking man,
that Europe of to-day, is merely a seething Volcano, ready
with the slightest rent, or extra bubble, to allow the lava to
escape, and all Europe will be ablaze. And should England
be drawn into an offensive conflict outside her own little
Isle, she may amid the crash of the armed host of the great
powers, receive a crushing reverse, that would be felt in
every extremity of her vast dominions. Is such an event
impossible or improbable 1 I hope never to see the day, but
if the day should come, then the elements of weakness will
rear their hydra heads. Is the scotched snake of Indian dis-
affection dead—and if England does not support the sublime
Porte, may not her sixty millions of Mahommedans join
forces with other disaffected subjects in India. Has the
Poland of England undergone her twenty-four hours
baptismal submersion. Will the Irish not then require the
thirty thousand troops, and the twelve thousand armed
constablulary, that they now require to teach law and order
to the excitable celt. Will the million of Irishmen now in
America, who wept when they left their native land, with all
its wretchedness, and cursed the power they were taught to
believe caused all its woes, come forward and assist England
in the day of her need, and if the commerce of the Canadian
dominion, and the Australian group should be interrupted,
and their shores threatened with hostile attack—one result
and one only may be expected. These elements of trouble
and weakness will crop up, and bring forth fruit, and the
great dependencies of the British Crown will have to seek
their safety as Independent States. Not like rats deserting


tlie sinking ship—but as men with danger ahead looks it
boldly in the face, and seeks the best, perhaps the only means
to extricate themselves from it. And indeed I believe this
very contingency was forseen, and in view of the Imperial
authorities, when they handed ovei to Colonial Legislatures
the power of the purse strings, and removed the last British
soldiers from our shores, the act in effect said you are no
longer children to be kept in leading strings. You aspire to
govern yourselves without Imperial control—do so—raise
your revenues how you like, spend them how you like, do
not infringe Her Majesty’s prerogative, and prepare your-
selves to meet all contingencies that may arise, without
asking aid or protection from the overtaxed people of Great
Britian.
What should have followed this proceeding of the Imperial
Authorities, “ Yattel ” says a nation ought to put itself in such
a state as to be able not only to repel, but humble an adversary.
This is an important duty which the care of its self-preservation
imposes upon the State and its rulers. Have our rulers acted
on the principle laid down by this great authority, let the
present state of our Australian defences answer the question.
Then why is this so, surely if time could be found for inter-
colonial conference on Mail routes, and subsidies on
Telegraph communications, and fiscal questions, time might
have been found to enter on the far more important question
of self defence, by federation.
The idea is not so strange to our Australian Legislators,
that unity is strength, and that for defensive purposes united
action above all other things is essential, and this we know
can only be obtained by conference in the first instance.
Who has not read the story of the bundle of sticks, select
one and how easily it may be broken, but how difficult to
break or injure the bundle, when once firmly knit together.
A most important point is gained too, by federation, it places
it out of the power of the Joseph Hume’s of Australian
Legislatures to interfere with the question, when once
approved of by the Parliaments of Australia, the duty can
neither be ignored or shirked, and party action on defence
questions will cease.
It appears so far, the various Governments have paid some


little attention to tlie question, in providing for the protection
of the various capitals, but this surely is taking a very
narrow view of the matter, in omitting to provide for the
defence of all Coast towns, say in the Illawarra or Newcastle
or North Coast Line, surely an insult an outrage on our
fellow Colonists in these parts would be an outrage felt from
end to end of Australia, and were such to take place—the
Government permitting it—by not providing for its preven-
tion, would be placed in rather a delicate position before the
world. No defence is worthy the name unless thorough and
complete, and an independent State, (which we assume to be
less the figment of power reserved by Her Majesty), which
is not in a position or condition to repel aggression against
its territory, or against the person or property of its inhabit-
ants, is unequal to the object of its institution. Great Britian
would no doubt defend her Colonies to the last shilling, and
to the last man were she able, but England practically
acknowledges her inability under all circumstances to do so,
by withdrawing her troops. The duty therefore devolves on
us, and I submit that when the safety of the State is at
stake, our precautions and foresight cannot be carried too
far.
I commend to the persual of all Volunteers, the letter of
congratulation from the oldest and greatest living Emperor,
William of Prussia, to the greatest Republican General,
President Grant, on the centenary of the proclamation of
American independence. The letter appears in the Septem-
ber Mail, and says, “It has been given you to celebrate the
“ hundredth Anniversary of the day when the great nation
“ over which you preside took rank among independent
“ States. The institution organized by the founders of the
“ Union, who wisely consulted the lessons oj history , with
“ regard to the formation of States have developed beyond
“ all expectation,”
This, coming from one who saw his fatherland overan by
the soldiery of the first French Empire—her bravest sons
slain by tens of thousands; her noblest daughters left
weeping in the dust ; Prussia left rent and bleeding, and its
treasures of science and art carried away by the conquerer of
Jena and Austerlitz, to adorn the French Capital. William


of Prussia saw all tins, and also saw his crushed, ruined
fatherland rise little by little from its abasement, till it once
more took rank among the powers of Europe, and finally at
Waterloo assisted to hurl the great Napoleon from his
throne.
This same William saw America grow from an infant
state to its present gigantic stature, and he therefore, an eye
witness of these great events of the past sixty years, may
well say the founders of American independence wisely con-
sulted the lessons of history. Now, what are the lessons of
history which the Emperor refers to as applicable to the
foundation of an independent State : first and foremost to
place the State in a position to secure its independence, by
organizing a proper force for its defence. What did the
Fathers of American independence ? they like us Australians
sprung from the same old stock; they learnt their historical
lessons from the same books, and finding among the musty
records of English history that Alfred the Great, one of its
earliest Kings and ablest warriors—that he, to repel the
invasions of the Danes, had to establish a Militia in pure
self defence—this system enabled that King without drawing
men from their proper avocations, to repel nearly every
invasion of his Danish foes, and defeat them in nearly sixty
battles. This Militia system established one thousand
years ago, is still in force in Great Britian, and the
American’s first step after their declaration of independence,
was to follow the example set them by Alfred the Great, for
in their Constitution Act the fifteenth clause recites that “ a
“ well regulated Militia being necessary for the security of
“ a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
“ shall not be infringed.” And the sixteenth clause goes on
to recite, “ That it is the duty of a Government to provide
“ for organizing armies, and disciplining Militia, to suppress
“ insurrections and repel invasions, and by this potent means
“ secure the blessings of liberty for us and our posterity.”
This was law in America while the ragged, shoeless, revolu-
tionists, were contending successfully against the trained
soldiery of England, and America then numerically was not
greater than the Australia’s of to-day, with not a tithe of
the wealth or trade, and mark the result within our own


experience, has not America for nearly four years from the
firing of the first shot at Sumter to the final capitulation at
Richmond, been enabled by its Militia system to carry on
one of the greatest conflicts of modern times, and bring it to
a successful issue, and does not this war bear out the lessons
taught in the war of independence. That raw levies are
capable of great things, when commanded by soldiers such as
Lee and Grant.
In twelve short years the hundredth Anniversary of
the foundation of this Colony will be held in Sydney,
whether even in that short time it will be kept up as a
dependency of Great Britian, or the inauguration of an
independent State of a great Southern confederacy, time
alone will shew. Those who have carefully watched the
changes on the Map of Europe, during the past twenty-five
years, will not feel at all surprised at the greater changes
possible in the ensuing twenty-five years, and while noting
these changes—the wars with their many startling incidents,
no doubt it has appeared to us Australians, dwelling in our
semi-arcadian state of peace and quietude, that we were
residents of some charmed zone, altogether beyond the dread-
ful calamities and atrocities befalling our fellow creatures,
and which to us were merely subjects for reading at the
breakfast table, or converse in the streets, and this no doubt
lulled us into a false—let us hope not a fatal repose. These
dreadful events have happened to others over and over again,
and pray why should we who possess so fair and rich a field
for the spoiler hope to escape, the curse of war that has
always brought ruin and desolation on the fairest portions of
God's earth, and perhaps our pleasant day dream, sooner far
than we expect—(let us hope we may be prepared), may be
rudely dispelled by the reverberations of the war storm at
our doors.
The Turkish question has opened the ball, whether we are
involved by that sooner or later is not to the purpose, the
Statesmen of Europe can only see the war cloud gathering all
round the horizon, but from which quarter it will first burst
they even do not know, Russia, evidently having purchased
dearly her experience in the Crimea, is determined to act
with tact and forethought, to place her adversaries in the
wrong.


Let us therefore not trust to the willingness of England to
aid us, she may require every man for her own defence. Let
us not look for, nor expect forbearance from England’s
enemies, all experience shews the tendency of Military
powers in war to abuse and carry successes into excesses.
As there seems but little enthusiasm on the question of
self-defence, it may be asked, is the place worth defending,
or going to the expense of the various works required—let
us see what says the Herald of September 30th, 1876.
The population of New South Wales ... 632,000
Deposits in Government Savings Bank £1,649,171
Deposits in private Banks ... £13,350,891
Cash balance to the credit of the
Government ... ... £2,983,296
This as the Herald says “ divided over our limited popula-
“ tion, gives an amount per head such as no community that
“we know can boast of.” Do we, looking at those figures
alone, realise our responsibility, by voting £50,000 for
purposes defensive. I doubt very much the liberality, and
question the sufficiency of the amount. Compare for a
moment the over-taxed population of Great Britian with our
fortunate selves.
The expenses for army and naval purposes in Britian will
reach about £26,000,000, the interest of the National debt
contracted in maintaining the equilibrium of power, (which
any day now may kick the beam the wrong side) will
amount to about £24,000,000. (I am only writing from
memory.) This, for warlike purposes alone will amount to
about £1 15s. per head of the population of the Mother
Country, we are taxed at less than two shillings per head
to make up the £50,000, voted for our defensive purposes.
Now history repeats itself not only in the records of
nations, but also, if it could be traced, in the lives of
individuals. We know from personal dearly bought
experience, that neglecting the poor little waifs of the
streets, compels them to grow up the arabs of the City, and
that entails expenses for gaols, asylums, and police ; this, if
not cheerfully, yet has to be patiently borne. We know
experimentally the loss and injury to person and property
these Arabs of the City cause, and have not the Govern-


ments of the day awakened to this fact, and by the erection
of forts in the shape of schools, and established an army in
the form of masters and teachers, at an expense of £250,000,
endeavoured to suppress and repel this great evil of ignorance
and vice. Now, because these facts are patent to us—we
see the incidents daily with our own eyes, and therefore
cheerfully bear the expense. But the lessons of history are
quite as unerring as these facts which we observe for our-
selves. But simply because war and its attendent horrors,
and all its train of evils have not yet run riot and inflicted
its curse upon us, we cannot imagine it to be so bad as
represented. We will hear things, atrocities committed by
Turks and Russians, and perhaps Christians (so called) that
will make our blood curdle, and still we will not prepare our
defences, the cost would be so great. Oh, should this scourge
once alight on us unprepared—the execrations of our
■colonists would ring while life lasted, in the ears of those
whose guilty supineness allowed it to take place.
Now let us leave history, and all connected with it, and
apply ourselves to our more immediate concerns, and in
doing so we will view the question of defence under its
different aspects, and will place the Colony generally as a
body to be defended. The City or capital the heart, the
coast towns in the Illawarra and south coast districts as the
right arm, the City of Newcastle and towns north coast aa
the left arm.
The harbour of Port Jackson has few equals as a commer-
cial port, and fewer still possessing so many natural facilities
Tor defensive purposes, skilled labor and money
that is required to render the harbour impregnable. Works
purposes have been in progress for some time
past, and so far have been constructed in a scientific fand
thorough manner, but for immediate defence are all but
useless; for instance, the batteries at South Head are fall
open and exposed to any ordinary boat attack, which could
be effected wholly under cover, from Camp Cove. The
batteries at Middle Head, Obelisk Bay, and George’s Head,
are just in the same position, but this triple battery is the
key of the harbour, and all works carried out in any part of
the harbour, are perfectly useless while this triple battery Js


left open and exposed to attack in its rear and front.
Tlie formation of the ground at this place and South Head is
such as to necessitate the work being carried out in a most
thorough manner, but once completed, would last for ages.
1000 men might be advantageously employed on these
works, which sooner or later must be attended to.
Entrenched lines and covered ways are immediate necessaries
for the triple battery at least.
Now all this, while plainly shewing our defenceless state,,
still in a manner proves that it is perfectly possible to guard
the City against attack from sea. But with all our pre-
cautions in front, of what avail are they, while an enemy
can march in at the rear from Botany Bay on the south, or
Broken Bay on the north. I may here say a word about our
land defences. Nothing could be easier for an attacking
force, than to land at Botany under cover of the ship s guns
or gun boats; the advance of a land force from the Bay to the
City if properly prepared, would probably be successtul,
though every foot of the ground would have to be fought
for Some might think this the easiest side to attack, on the
contrary, I think an attack from Broken Bay would be most
fatal to us—landing at Pitt Water, advancmg along the
Pitt Water road to Balgowlah, thence across Middle
Harbour at the spit, attacking with an overwhelming force
the batteries at Middle Head, Obelisk Bay, and George s.
Head, bayonetting or driving our artillerymen into the
harbour. The possession gives them at once command ot
the harbour, the position at Watson’s Bay would no longer
be tenable, the harbour would be open to the entry of a
hostile fleet; boats under cover of the ships guns and
batteries could drag for torpedoes so as to clear a channel,
find 'out and cut all wire communication with shore ends,
and thus place the city at the mercy, not alone of a land
force, but under the guns of the fleet. But we must here
again enlarge our field of vision—we have no right to think
Sat providing a kind of a force to meet one particular
attack is all that is requisite, we require a force to meet an
attack made simultaneously on all points, any force not
sufficient to meet an emergency of that kind is not equal to
our requirements. It is just as well to call attention as,.


plainly as words will allow to our actual position, so tlxat if
there is a desire, it may be remedied.
We now arrive at the question of land defence, and what
it should consist of—it is simply a Military Force, classified
under the head of
Ist. The Permanent.
2nd. A Militia.
3rd. The Volunteers.
The Permanent consisting of men voluntarily enlisting for
a fixed term.
The Militia—free men resident in Now South Wales who
shall be publicly ballotted for, and who shall serve in the
Militia a certain fixed term. Volunteers—free men resi-
dent of New South Wales who shall voluntarily enrol them-
selves into a Defence Corps—the particular branch they
shall elect to serve in. No Volunteer shall be liable for
service in the Militia.
The pay and allowances of each Force shall be fixed by
law.
Volunteers shall be paid for each drill or field day
attended under the head of allowances, and shall receive
quarterly a further fixed sum contingent on their attending
the proper number of drills and field days.
Every Volunteer should be liberally compensated for his
labour and loss of time in qualifiying himself for the
Defence Force.
Volunteers should join for a fixed term named by them-
selves, but should be enabled to resign on sufficient cause
(shown to the satisfaction of a board,) i.e., leaving the colony,
or proceeding inland to work at a trade or occupation, no
Volunteer should be trammelled in his endeavour to gam
his living.
One prime essential, neither last nor least, to make a
force effective, is at once and for ever to adopt the Mutiny
Act. Every man on taking arms must learn that obedience
is the first duty of a soldier. A man must know that he
who won’t obey is not fit to command, therefore the obedience
to authority at drill, parade, or camp, must be unquestion-
ing and thorough, and with the Mutiny Act this can be
enforced, and if we are to have a Defence Force, must be.


It is all very well for Jack to be as good as bis master.
Jack can be so, when be is not under arms ; but when once
under arms be must surrender bis individuality and become
a simple part of the great Military Machine which builds
up and casts down Empires—and just as the obedience to
lawful commands is most perfect—so this machine becomes
most powerful.
Having now endeavoured in a rough, though perhaps,
disjointed manner, to sketch an outline of the ground
required to be covered by a Defence Force.
1.E., the Harbour—Botany Bay and Broken Bay, and
also show what the force should consist of:—lst. The
Permanent. 2nd. The Militia. 3rd. The Volunteers,
Let us now divide our forces into a first and second
defence line.
The first line to consist of the Permanent and Militia
Forces, which on the declaration of war should at once
enrol for service, man the batteries and take the field.
The second line or reserve consisting wholly of Volun-
teers, should not be called out till the enemy appeared
or were signalled on the coast.
We will now endeavour to estimate the lowest number
possible of men required to give even the appearance of a
force able to defend us.

Having now so far settled (to our own satisfaction) the
numbers of the force, let us further endeavour to ascertain
the necessary constituents for making it effective for the end
to be obtained; and first we find that for all purposes,
offensive and defensive, the most powerful arm for the field,
is artillery; this well horsed, well handled, moving with
rapidity, and firing with precision, shrapnell or case, com-
manding, without shifting its position by the mere move-
ment of its trail, an extensive range of country, firing on
advancing columns, right or left, front or flank, the success
of our tactical operations in the field will depend greatly on
the number and efficiency of our field batteries. No arm of
the service possess, if well horsed, the mobility the field
artillery does. One battery can support another, and can
check, if it cannot crush, infantry when unsupported. If
troops are disorganized it can at once, by taking up positions
in support, restore confidence and give time to reform.
Therefore too much attention cannot be given to this
branch of the service. Horses should be permanently
attached to one battery, and in future no gun should appear
on the field, even on a field day, (to be dragged about by the
troops) unless properly horsed.
If a Militia Force should be raised the smartest men
should be selected for the artillery, men of small stature
selected for drivers.
The proportion of artillery to the whole force must be left
to the judgment of the Colonel commanding the Artillery.
The Artillery for harbour defence should receive an un-
limited amount of gun drill and shot practice.
The Volunteer Rifles Corps should all be formed up to
the full strength of 1000 per regiment.


As the principle of a Militia Force may be new to many,
I may here insert a word about it. It is based on the
principle that all free men are liable to, and bound to come
forward in the common defence of the country, and as it is
not requisite that every man should come forward at once,
some being willing from patriotic motives to do so, while
others from carelessness or indisposition would not come
forward at all, and as it is not desirable to cast the whole
burden of defence on the few willing men, it is necessary,,
therefore, to pass a Militia Act, which provides that all free
men, between certain ages, shall come forward and be
balloted for, so that chance elects a small number from the
greater, who are compelled to serve for a certain fixed term
in their country’s defence.
But the colonies of Australia being so sparsely populated,
and as it would not be advisable to interfere with men resi-
dent in the interior, the question arises how are they to be
reached in an equitable manner, so as to do justice to men
resident on the coast line who are compelled to enforced
service. Would it be possible to divide the colony into
Militia and Non-Militia districts. Militia districts consisting
of all populous cities and towns, where numbers reside and
could easily be brought under the operation of the drill
instructor.
The Non-Militia districts should be all beyond the opera-
tion of the Militia Act, and as persons would not be drawn
from these districts for enforced service, should they pay for
that exemption by a speical tax. Now, whether a special
tax or any tax would be advisable and equitable, or whether
it would be practicable, is a point for legislators to decide.
Bear in mind the point is, if men on the coast are compelled
to fight, might their fellow colonists in the interior who will
not be asked to do so, be called on to pay something for
their exemption,
I will just refer to what history says on the subject, and
start with this axiom— That it is proper and necessary that
all States should take from the power, strength, and wealth of
a nation that which is absolutely necessary for its support,
maintenance, and protection, and it is the duty of the State in
imposing taxes to impose them equally; the end to be
obtained being the protection of life and property.


Then I submit taxes are not imposed equally if the
defenders of a nation are taxed exactly in the same propor-
tion as those who are exempt from defence, such exemption
enabling the person exempt to prosecute and enjoy their
labour which creates wealth, which all those called on for
enforced service are in a measure debarred from enjoying.
The first land tax imposed was by William the Norman,
ostensibly to prepare against an attack of the Danes; with
various alterations it existed to the time of the Common-
wealth, when it is recorded as realising £840,000 in Eng-
land, £144,000 in Scotland, and £216,000 in Ireland.
Under William the Third as it was impossible to depend on
the collection of taxes, recourse was had to a land tax, which
we find from 4th William and Mary, chap. 1., was assessed
at one shilling and fourpence in the pound. This realised
£1,922,712. It would be interesting to know how much a
tax of one penny per acre on all freehold land would realise
in the exempt Militia district of Australia. I merely give
it as a hint.
I now do myself the honor of explaining to the officers,
non-commissioned officers, and men of the Australian Volun-
teer Corps, my reason for addressing this letter to them, it
is simply this—l admire the patriotism and zeal evinced
by them in the cause of our National Defence. The act of
a number of men voluntarily standing forward boldly, aye,
nobly to defend the hearths and homes of the people of
Australia, merits the esteem and sincere gratitude of every
right thinking man ; and it will be on record as an historical
fact that Australians after England had given up the task of
their Defence, voluntarily banded themselves together to
secure it, thus setting an example of what Britons will do
in cases of emergency; and that as Australians they were
worthy scions of the stock from whence they sprung. I
claim to have an intense sympathy for the Volunteer Move-
ment, and having carefully noted from its formation to the
present time, I arrive at the conclusion that the spirit of
isolation and localization of our present system is prejudicial
and not calculated to attain the end we all have in view.
Just fancy for a moment England adopting our system,
the Volunteers of Middlesex defending London, the Volun-


Men.

teers of Devonshire defending Plymouth, the Volunteers of
Lancashire defending Liverpool, each willing to fight its own
battle on its own ground; but how long pray would England
stand against an invader if a suicidal policy such as this was
adopted 1 And is not this precisely the course we are follow-
ing now 1 Every Volunteer will at once see the force of the
comparison. Well, G-entlemen, this is where I wish to
see you bring your power to bear, I desire to see Volun-
teers discuss this matter among friends and comrades in arms,
it is a matter that concerns the Colonies collectively but
Volunteers individually, because it is casting a burden on
the Force which ought not to bear it. Why should not the
four Governments, of Queensland and South Australia, New
South Wales and Victoria, appoint their representatives and
have a conference on the subject of Federation for Defensive
purposes; the more the subject is ventilated the greater the
apparent necessity for it will become.
The matter seems simple enough when understood. The
Agreement to be for each Colony to provide a Defence Force,
no matter of what kind, so long as it is an organized effective
Force, such force to be founded on the basis of population of
the respective Colonies, say 2 per cent., that would provide
all round numbers.
In the event of a War, each Colony to call out its first'line
of Defence, say one half of the Effective Force of the Colony.
One clause of the compact should be that all Railways be
pressed to completion with all possible speed, to connect
with the adjoining Colonies at their respective boundaries.
Now note how this would work in the event of a hostile
fleet appearing before Port Philip, to attack Melbourne.
The news would at once be flashed to the neighbouring
Colonies and assistance called for, the first Defence line of


New South Wales, say ... ... ... 6,000 men
would be at once hurried to Melbourne by
rail
South Australia would despatch her ... ... 2,000 „
Queensland her ... 2,000 „
bo that Victoria would have ... ... ... 10,000
effective men to add to her own ... ... 16,000 „
which would really form a pretty fair Force for
Defensive purposes. The same course would
be followed if the attack was made on Port
Jackson, as soon as the news was flashed
to the neighbouring Colonies,
Victoria would send her ... ... ... 8,000 „
South Australia her ... ... ... 2,000 „
and Queensland her ... ... ... ... 2,000 „
by rail to Sydney or Newcastle. These ... 12,000 „
effectives with our own ... ... ... 12,000 , T .
would form a fair Force to take the field with. A similar
course would be followed towards the smaller colonies.
Now if we go a little further and consider it our duty not
only to protect the Capitals, but also the Coast towns from
attack, for I contend we have no justification or excuse to
leave our lengthened Coast-line and our Intercolonial
Commerce to the tender mercies of an Alabama or
Shenandoah. While this can be secured by each Colony (also
under terms of a Federal compact), providing according to its
population a first-class sea-going Ironclad Ram. Victoria and
New South Wales providing one each carrying four 30-ton
guns, while Queensland and South Australia should furnish
one each carrying two 18-ton guns. With these I believe
Australia would be able to sweep the Coast of all privateers,
and probably would give a good account of any hostile fleet
sent to these waters, and would be far more efiective
than any British ships of war ever likely to be sent to these
seas in commission. But I discard altogether the idea that
England will keep her ships and brave tars in the Southern
Ocean while there are hard knocks to be given and taken in
the Mediteranean, and when that day comes it will be too
late to think of ironclad ships or even bad substitutes for them.


Then another most important, in fact, a vital want has to
be provided for. I mean a powder factory for the Govern-
ments of Australia. This should be a federal matter also.
Why on earth should we depend on our supply of powder
from home? which, if we run short of, all our other
defensive measures are completely useless. This seems a
short-sighted policy, for an accident might scatter to the
winds in an instant all our stores, and were communications
cut off or suspended, or our vessels bringing powder inter-
cepted during war time, I fear we would find ourselves in
a fix.
Then let the Governments establish a factory anywhere,
in any colony—in the Blue Mountains where a soul could
not be harmed for fifty miles—but let us have one for Aus-
tralia, it would be establishing a new industry (manufactur-
ing powder), and a second one in making cartridges. Get
the best workmen from England to start the factory. A
market at hand would be found for New Zealand sulphur,
and our artillerymen, from Bert' tO MoiktOk Bay,’
could be supplied with Australian gunpowder, and they and
the riflemen could blaze away and make themselves pro-
ficient in the use of their respective arms, which can never
be done unless by plenty of practice. I fancy the powder
would be better, and there would not be such a stint as at
present. Federation for defence would also place one
description of arm only in the hands of our riflemen. I
fear there are too many kinds at present, from which diffi-
culties may crop out hereafter.
Having I trust made out to the comprehension of every
thinking man the absolute necessity of Federation for
Defensive purposes—should the members of Volunteer Corps
concur with my views, not necessarily in detail, I conceive it
would be quite competent for them as citizens to form cor-
responding committees, and if all Volunteers in the several
Colonies were pretty unanimous, they might then represent
their views jointly to their respective Governments. Ido not
think under present circumstances any but the four mention-
ed should federate—(this is, however, an open question).
Did a Government know the opinion of their Military Force
on a question of this kind, it would strengthen their hands


in dealing with it. I have not consulted one person on the*
matter, and until the Volunteers are in possession of this
letter no one will know such a measure has been proposed.
I have but little more to add; it is a subject deserving a
better advocate than myself, still I feel it will commend itself
to the judgment of all Volunteers. Federation for defence is
all important, not only from the increased power it provides
each colony by co-operation, but also that it places the
defence question, when once dealt with by the different
Legislatures, beyond party warfare, it is no longer the shuttle-
cock of politicians, as the pact must be adhered to and
carried out in its integrity. It may also be beneficial in
introducing the small end of the wedge for the ultimate
federation of the Australian group, for we cannot imagine
brothers who unite to fight a common enemy huckstering
over petty border questions, which cause annoyance and ill-
feeling with scarcely any corresponding benefit. The rail and
iron horse that will soon enable us to breakfast in Sydney
and sleep in the capital of a neighbouring colony, will help
to expedite matters; therefore let us look out, and beyond
our present petty policy of isolation; it is injudicious, and
may prove dangerous.
I believe if the Volunteers once move in this matter and
interest the public in it, the good sound common sense of
our Australian Statesmen, though slack hitherto on this
question, when once roused to action will be found equal to
the emergency, and solve the Australian Problem of the day,,
by adopting Federal action in Defence of Australia.

Your very obedient servant,
