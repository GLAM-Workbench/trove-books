FREE TRADE?WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE IN
A NEW COUNTRY
[Reprinted from
The Leader, 15th April,
1871, by the Land Reform League.]
The discussions on free trade and pro-
tection have reached such an advanced
stage here, that, while looking almost
solely to results, there is no little danger
of first principles being lost sight of. Let
us then retrace our steps for a moment,
and see what free trade really means and
what it might have been with our ne-
glected opportunities. Why are we not
all free traders 1 Simply because, although
true in the abstract the principles on
which it is based can only be operative
under certain circumstances, or, in other
words, there can be no genuine or consis-
tent free trade in any country which
raises a revenue by indirect taxation-
And as all civilised governments do so now,
although free trade opinions are fast making
way there in such directions as are calcu-
lated to promote her manufacturing inte-
there can be nothing more than partial
free-trade under any of them. England
is very falsely called a free trade country,
rests, and to widen up the markets for their
products. How can there be free-trade
truly and actually, when some fifty mil-
lions of revenue are raised each year by
customs, excise, stamp, and such other
duties. But to see what free trade fully
means, it is necessary to understand
clearly on what basis the chrematistic
science rests. The teaching of political
economists has been sadly wasted or mis-
applied. How many thousands read the
Wealth of Nations, without finding out
or remembering that ? the universal
agent in the creation of wealth is labor.?
On this one axiom the whole superstruc-
ture is raised, and by thus laying bare
the foundation of the science Adam
Smith demolished the previously very
prevalent mercantile theory, ? that com-
merce makes wealth.? So it did for the few
cities and trading republics of olden times.
With little or no land belonging to them,
they built or bought ships to trade in the
produce of other territories, and many of
them thus became very wealthy. Seeing
the result in these trading communities
it was natural enough to believe that com-
merce was the most profitable occupation
a people could have, besides being that best
calculated to promote the spread of civili-
sation by its accompanying benefits, until
the clear-headed Scotchman looked be-
neath the surface and explained how com-
merce was only the collecting together of
things raised in the first instance from
laud by labor, and that land was therefore
the source of all wealth, and labo'r the pro-
ducer of it. In modern times manufactur-
ing industry has become a fertile source of
wealth, in consequence of the vast increase
of mechanical power, but the raw material
must first be raised from the laud. Adam
Smith was not by any means the first to
discover this truth, but he first founded
upon it a complete and harmonious sys-
tem, and since his day they who advocate
the fostering of commerce as the summum
bonum, more especially in a new country
(where Nature has supplied such a super-
abundance of raw material in proportion
to the labor power able to avail itself
thereof) must have read Adam Smith to
but little advantage.
annual charge would have been very low.
There are said to be about 40,000,000 of
acres of available laud in the colony,
which, at an average of Is. 6d. per acre
per annum, would have afforded a
revenue of 3,000,000 Z. But as the ex-
ceptional value of town and suburban
allotments is so high, the rates on country
land might have been reduced to about Is.
an acre for the best agricultural land in
small blocks, running downward to a half-
penny an acre for large tracts of poor graz-
ing land. Then, a revenue having been
so provided for, all other kinds of taxa-
tion might have been done away with
by degrees, the cost of government being
much reduced at the same time by the
saving in the collection of one tax
rather than many. And without cus-
toms, or excise, and a permanently low
rent on land, there would have been a
free country and a free port, with one
payment towards the expenses of Go-
vernment, for the benefit of all, instead
of double taxation as now; taxes for
purposes of revenue, and a tax on bread
for the benefit of the owner of the land
in fee simple, the last being far the
highest of the two. With 6d. or Is. an
acre to pay for laud, instead of the 10s.
extorted by owners at present, and tea
and sugar, as well as every other article
of use or luxury, duty free, the farmers
and stockowners would have been able
with profit to themselves to grow food
exceedingly cheap; and the manufac-
turer, with food so reasonable in price,
and tools and machinery, as well as any
raw material he might want, im-
ported free, would have been enabled
to compete successfully against the
products of England or any other heavily
taxed country. With such a state of free-
dom in land there would have been full
employment for all, and as a free port,
backed up by a country so richly endowed
as ours is by nature, and as productive as
a fully employed population, rapidly in-
creasing from without, could make it,
Melbourne would have soon attracted to
herself and retained the lion?s share of
the commerce of the Australias. If such
be the aim of the advocates of free trade
here now, let them avow their objects and
show how these are to be attained. But,
judging them by their acts and deeds,
their sayings and writings, they are
incapable of understanding the true
spirit of the doctrine they preach. The
sort of free trade of which we have had
experience so long is answerable for lock-
ing up the land in the first place, and for
continually draining from the country
the capital which should have been
allowed to accumulate for the employ-
ment of labor, until we had at last a host
of idle consumers of the wealth they
should have been rapidly adding to. Such
was the effect of the mongrel free trade
to which we were treated so long, and a
return to first principles will show wUy
it could have had no other result.
Remembering, then, that land is the j
source of all wealth, and labor the produce
of it, free trade ought to mean a great deal
more than the mere removal of customs
duties, in order that ships may pass freely
between the ports of different countries,
exchanging the products of each. It ought
to mean, in the first place, free access of labor
to the land, wifh perfect freedom for the
laborer or employer to do what he likes
with the produce in the way of exchang- t
ing or of converting it into other forms,
and paying as little as possible (consistent |
with the rights of property and the de-
mands of citizenship) for permission to
use the land. Then it should mean
abundance of raw material, at a cheap rate
for the manufacturer, great or small, to i
exercise his ingenuity upon, without let or
hindrance from government official or |
tax gatherer. Lastly, free trade should
mean wide markets for the disposal of the I
things produced, with the greatest pos-
sible facilities for iuterchange. In the
common acceptation of the term, this is
considered to be the prime or only object,
but the spirit of free trade, as the best !
means of developing the wealth and
resources of a country, embraces a much '
wider range of objects, and has far more
extended views, however we may trans-
pose them.
This extended idea of the true objects
of free trade will, perhaps, be best eluci-
dated by showing what might have been
done for us, had our early legislators been
men capable of knowing that ?the principal
object of political science is to secure a
certain fund of subsistence for all the in-
habitants of a country, and to obviate
every circumstance which may render this 1
precarious,? or, in other words, tï¿½ ensure
constant and profitable employment
for the entire labor power in
the community. Both these objects
might have been secured by understanding
the opportunity which the possession of a
great public estate .afforded us. This
might have been made to pay all the ex-
penses of Government by the imposition
of a small tax, if sold, or rent if the fee-
simple was retatned by the public, as it
should have been according to the best
authorities. There is a prejudice in favor
of individual possession of the fee-simple
of land, but this is a mistake, unless
the owner wants to convert it into
a monopoly, to the injury of others, or
buys on speculation with the view of
selling again at a profit. If the fee-sim-
ple was not sold, the right to everything
put upon the land or raised from it could
have been secured to the occupant so long
as he contributed his due share towards the
expenses of government, and the transfer
of his interest could have been effected with-
out the least trouble or expense as to title.
But whether called a tax or a rent, the
