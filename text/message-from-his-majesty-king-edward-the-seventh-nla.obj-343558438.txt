To my People Beyond the Seas.
THE countless messages of loyal sympathy which I have received
from every part of my Dominions over the Seas testify to the
universal grief in which the whole Empire now mourns the loss of
my beloved Mother. In the welfare and prosperity of Her subjects
throughout Greater Britain the Queen ever evinced a heartfelt
interest. She saw with thankfulness the steady progress which,
under a wide extension of self-government, they had made during
Her Reign. She warmly appreciated their unfailing loyalty to
Her Throne and Person, and was proud to think of those who had
so nobly fought and died for the Empire’s cause in South Africa.
I have already declared that it will be my constant endeavour to
follow the great example which has been bequeathed me. In these
endeavours I shall have a confident trust in the devotion and
sympathy of the People and of their several Representative
Assemblies throughout my vast Colonial Dominions. With such
loyal support I will, with God’s blessing, solemnly work for the
promotion of the common welfare and security of the Great
Empire over which I have now been called to reign.
