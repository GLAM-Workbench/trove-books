PARTING WORDS
A YOUNG FEMALE EMIGRANT.
CHAPTER I.
The following pages may probably find you on
ship-board. They are addressed to you with a
sincere and earnest desire for your welfare; and
with the hope that, during the leisure of your
voyage, you may, with seriousness and delibera-
tion, weigh such of the counsels they contain
as may be suited to your circumstances and
prospects.
Whatever those circumstances are, or whatever
may have been the history of your past life, your
present position —that of an emigrant to a distant
land—is one calling for sympathy and encourage-
ment.
Perhaps you are leaving the home of your
childhood far behind. Horae : the word calls up


a multitude of thoughts, and presents to your
mind vivid pictures of the past. You see even
now, in imagination, the house in which you lived,
the chamber in which you slept, the room in
which, day after day, for many years, you met,
it may be, parents and brothers and sisters : you
recal scenes —some of pleasure, and some of sor-
row —which, years ago, you witnessed there, and
in which, as a child, you bore a part.
Perhaps this home of yours was in a country
place; and you can remember the garden in
which you played, the banks and copses where you
gathered wild flowers, the village green with its
merry sports, the old church, and its graveyard,
filled with grassy mounds. It may be that a
parent or a friend, a brother or a sister, rests there
in that sleep which shall know no awakening until
the resurrection morning, when “ the trumpet
shall sound, and the dead shall be raised.” These,
probably, are some of your recollections connected
with the home which it is doubtful if you will
ever see again.
Or, your home may Save been in the busy city ;
and memory brings before you sights and sounds
which pleased your childhood —the gay shops,
the market, the coaches rattling by, the bugle of


the coach-guard, the city church bells on Sunday
morning, the street music on all other days:
without an effort of thought, these, and a hundred
things besides with which your early history is
closely connected, are brought before you when
you think of your childhood’s home.
Your home may have been but poor; there
few luxuries were to be enjoyed, and many dis-
comforts to be borne; but it was there that you
first knew a parent’s love; and the sorrows in
which you then shared a part are softened down,
and now seem but trifling compared with the
pleasures of a childhood which will never return.
Or, it may have been a home of many enjoy-
ments and few troubles; you had nearly all that
your young heart wished for ; and now the re-
membrance of that home and its pleasures casts a
deep gloom over your present condition.
It may be you are one of a family of emigrants ;
parents, brothers, sisters, still surrounding you.
Or, you are accompanied by friends and acquaint-
ances, under whose guidance and protection you
are venturing on this new and important step
in life.
But, perhaps, you are solitary. You look
around you, and every face is strange. Every


friend whom you have hitherto known, is left
behind. You have said farewell to some, at least,
who love you, and whom you love. Let us listen
to the strains from yonder cottage. Ah, you
know the cottage well, and the voices that may
now be saying something like this:—
“ There are a thousand pleasant sounds
Around our cottage still,
The torrent that before it hounds,
The breeze upon the hill;
The murmuring of the wood-dove’s sigh;
The swallow in the eaves;
And the wind that sweeps a melody
In passing from the leaves;
And the pattering of the early rain,
The opening flowers to wet —
But they want our sister’s voice again,
To make them sweeter yet.”
You are that sister ; but the voices you may
never hear again.
Your former life has, perhaps, been chequered
with many trials. You have not lived long in the
world; but long enough to have witnessed the
fading away of many bright hopes, or to have felt
the truth of the declaration—“ Hope deferred
maketh the heart sick.” The time has been when
all around you was smiling, and you looked for-
ward to future comfort and prosperity as matters


of course ; but a sudden stroke of Providence, or
a series of disappointments, broke up a bappy
family, and launched you into a sea of care and
privation. Or, it may bd your whole life has
been one continual struggle against poverty, from
which you have, hitherto, found no way of escape.
You have dragged wearily through years of
domestic service, or you have earned a scanty
subsistence in some of those forms of female
industry which are called light work; but which
you have found far otherwise.
It may be that the tears you shed at the remem-
brance of the past are an orphan’s tears. Your
home was desolated, and your prospects were
blighted by the death of your earthly protectors;
and you have none left, in the land of your birth,
to care for you ; and therefore it is that you are
seeking a home beyond the seas.
But whatever may be your particular care,
uncertainty respecting the future sometimes chills
your spirits. You are going to a country far
away, of which you can know but little, and
where you will probably meet with none but
strangers. You have heard good reports of that
land, and have been told of many who arrived
there as strangers, and have found it to be a


pleasant land: they have prospered. You hope
it may be so with you ; but you cannot be sure.
But shall you ever reach that land ? It is a
long voyage that you have undertaken, and there
as no more certainty of life on ship-board than on
land, while there are dangers peculiar to a voyage
by sea, such as storms and wreck. It is not, how-
ever to excite your fears, or to deepen the gloom
which may depress your spirits as your native land
fades from sight, that these parting words of warn-
ing are written ; but rather to offer some sugges-
tions by which your happiness may be promoted ;
and to remind you of One who is able to pre-
serve you from, or support you amidst the dangers
you fear, and to bless you in your future course.
It may be, however, that the writer has not
correctly imagined your present feelings. You,
perhaps, have no regret on leaving your native
land —no fond remembrances of home and friends
to call for a sigh or a tear. Your farewell has
been a joyous one ; you have been but too glad to
escape from trouble and sorrow; and your
anticipations are bright and glowing. Others
around you may be weeping; but you are light-
hearted and mirthful.
It may be so ; but, nevertheless, this is surely


a fit time for consideration ; and you are affec-
tionately entreated, not indeed to be gloomy, but
to be thoughtful.
Whatever may have been your past history,
one thing is certain—you have not spent that
portion of your life unheeded by God. He first
gave you your being, preserved you in infancy
and childhood, and has delivered you from many
dangers. If your lot in life has hitherto been
a hard one, it has not been without many merciful
alleviations ; and if you have suffered, it is fit that
you should consider how far those sufferings have
been the result of your own sin and imprudence;
and that you should penitently remember that the
blessings you have been permitted to enjoy, were
altogether undeserved.
If new and brighter prospects are opened before
you in a distant country —and that there are may
be supposed, or you would not have become an
emigrant—it is God who, in his good providence,
has done this for you ; and will not this con-
sideration raise your gratitude to Him, who is not
only your Creator and Preserver, but your
bountiful Benefactor ?
And he still watches over you: his eye is
in every place. Read the 139th Psalm, and


adopt the language for your own : you may truly
do so :—“ Whither shall I go from thy Spirit ?
or whither shall I flee from thy presence ? If
I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make
my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take
the wings of the morning, and divell in the utter-
most parts of the sea ; even there shall thy hand
lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If
I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even
the night shall be light about me. Yea, the
darkness hideth not from thee; but the night
shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are
both alike to thee.”
“ Above—below—where’er I gaze,
Thy guiding finger, Lord, I view,
Traced in the midnight planet’s blaze,
Or glistening in the morning dew;
Whate’er is beautiful or fair,
Is but thine own reflection there.
I hear thee in the stormy wind
That turns the ocean wave to foam,
Nor less thy wondrous power I find,
When summer airs around me roam;
The tempest and the calm declare
Thyself,—for thou art everywhere.”
Yes —“ God is everywhere.” Does this thought
make you uncomfortable? Do you wish you
could go somewhere (anywhere) that you might


escape his ever-watchful eye—that eye which
“ never slumbers nor sleeps ?” Ah ! there are
indeed some whose thoughts towards God are,
“ Depart from us; for we desire not a knowledge
of thy ways.” Sad thoughts these; but surely
not yours? Certainly not yours if you have
learned to think of God as your Friend.
God is the everlasting and unchanging Friend
of all who have truly repented of sin, and fled to
him for mercy through the Lord Jesus Christ.
All need to do this, for all have sinned, and thus
shut themselves out of God’s favour; and to
unrepenting sinners the Just and Holy One is like
“ a consuming fire this is why they do not like
to think of him. But when wo see and feel our
misery and danger through sin, and are led, by
God’s good Spirit, to Jesus Christ, as the great
and mighty and loving Saviour of the lost, —then
God reveals himself to us as our Friend, puts his
love and fear into our hearts, enables us to trust
ourselves to his guidance, and to rejoice in his
salvation. And this is needful for all who would
reach heaven at last, and be preserved in the way
thither from sorrow and fear: and who would
not? Very needful is it for you —entering as


you are upon an untried course of life—to put
your trust in One who is able to keep you in all
your ways.
Think of this, dear friend ; and if you know in
your heart that you have never sought God’s
friendship in his own appointed way, seek it
now: listen to the kind invitations of his mercy ;
do not any longer delay; let past carelessness and
indifference suffice; think of his kindness and
long-suffering towards you all the while you have
been provoking him by your sins ; hear him say-
ing to you in his word—“Be ye reconciled.”
“ Now is the accepted time; now is the day of
salvation.”
If you have, in your soul, the happy knowledge
that God is your Friend, through his dear Son
Jesus Christ, you may well proceed on your
voyage with cheerful and simple reliance on Him
who has said, “ I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee:” “When thou passest through the waters,
I will be with theewith a loving, child-like
confidence that, though you may have left behind
you home and country, and every earthly friend,
“ this God will be your God for ever and ever ; he
will be your guide even unto death ;” and with the


utmost certainty that your past sorrows, as well as
whatever trials you may yet have to pass through,
so long as you keep close to your heavenly i riend,
and do not wilfully disregard his kind and gracious
guidance, will be seen at last to have been “ bless-
ings in disguise.”


CHAPTER 11.
What shall you do when the voyage is over?
It is sometimes difficult to answer a plain ques-
tion ; and it may not be easy for you to answer
this. Certainly, you cannot tell w r hat may happen,
even before the voyage is over, nor what prospects
may open before you when you have arrived at
the new country. What you will do then must
depend on circumstances which you can neither
foresee nor control.
This is quite true; but yet it is the part of
wisdom and prudence to do nothing without an
object; and it may be supposed that every young
female emigrant has some idea, more or less dis-
tinct, of what her future course may be, after
arriving at her destination ; and some intentions
too, which she will probably put in practice.
It is to be feared, however, that some young
people emigrate with very confused notions of
what probably lies before them, and with some


secretly cherished hopes some bright little
romance —very much at variance with the every
day scenes by which they will be surrounded, and
the every day duties they will have to perform,
in their homes beyond the sea.
Now, the writer has no wish to disturb any
pleasant anticipations you, young reader, may
have formed, so they be but tolerably well
founded: much less would any true friend at-
tempt or desire to fill your mind with gloomy
apprehensions concerning the future. Neverthe-
less, it may be prudent to review your expecta-
tions, and examine a little on what foundation
they rest.
You hope to find employment. Whatever else
you or any young person in your circumstances
may imagine, or wish, or dwell upon in her secret
thoughts, this was the one thing proposed to you
by those who assisted or advised you to emigrate,
or which you proposed to yourself, if you have
proceeded thus far in your course without assist-
ance—we will not say without advice, for we
can scarcely suppose that a young and inexperi-
enced female would take so serious a step as that
of emigration, unadvisedly. Even if you are
accompanied by members of your own family,


you look to find employment fur yourself when
you reach the land towards which you are bound ;
and if you are a solitary emigrant, it will be the
first thing for you to seek. You are aware of
this, and have, perhaps, such recommendations,
or have taken your passage under such circum-
stances, as will almost insure your favourable
introduction to those who may have the means
of employing you. This is so far well, for a
want of prudent forethought in this particular
has before now brought great distress upon
young women who have rashly emigrated to the
Australian and other colonies, with the mistaken
idea that they would have nothing to do, on their
arrival at port, but to step on shore, and find at
once a home without either trouble or anxiety,
and without any inquiries being made as to their
character, or even their fitness for what they
might choose to undertake. But you may rest
assured that respectable employers, in other parts
of the world, are as cautious as those in our own
country, and, as circumstances will permit, con-
cerning whom they employ.
And here we may say a word or two about
employment for females in Australia, whither so
many young women have lately been encouraged


to emigrate ; some of whom, it is to be feared,
have been very much disappointed in finding the
new country so very like the old one in some
particulars in which they expected to find it
widely different. They have found, for instance,
that “ women’s work ” is women’s work all the
world over, —that there is as little variety in
female employment in Australia as at home, —
that a practical knowledge of the useful arts of
domestic life is more valued than an acquaintance
with those which are only ornamental, —and that
even among those useful services for which female
assistance is required, the rough and homely are
more in request and better remunerated than the
refined and delicate.
Thus, for instance, in all the Australian
colonies there are plenty of openings in domestic
service, for housemaids, maids-of-all-work, cooks,
dairymaids, laundresses, and nursery-maids, who
are paid higher wages than can generally be
obtained in England. But there are not many
openings for governesses, milliners, dressmakers,
or any other description of needle-women ; and
their remuneration, when employed, is not very
encouraging. “ Hence,” we are told, u dis-
tressed needle-women, transplanted to better their
condition, frequently continue distressed needle-


women to the end,’* because “ experience shows
that the vanity of following a light and genteel
business in preference to robust employment,
prevails as much in Australia as in England.”
“By all means,” says the same writer, “ let
our distressed countrywomen share in the good
fortune of their Australian sisterhood ; but to
attain this they must not shrink from the wash-
tub, the scrubbing brush, and the broom. In
commercial phrase, cooks, housemaids, nursery-
maids, dairymaids, housekeepers, and servants-of-
all-work, are in brisk demand; milliners and
dress-makers are a drug in the market.”*
It is well to be forewarned; and should these
plain statements rather rudely demolish or disturb
any dream of future gentility which any young
reader may have cherished in her secret mind, it
is better for her to be undeceived now than at a
later period; and let her remember, with thank-
fulness, that hard, rough w'ork is not destructive
of happiness, while in the country whither she is
going she will be held truly respectable just in
proportion as she cheerfully and heartily performs
the useful duties of every day domestic life.
It is painful to think, however, how many
young people have left their native country
* Eclectic Review.


as emigrants, while almost entirely unfit for
domestic service,—many who had never been
engaged in household employment at all; some
who; from different causes, had never been able
to retain a respectable situation at home; and
others who, looking for something they have con-
sidered higher, have disdained to take situations
they might have filled with credit to themselves
and comfort to their employers, and have aspired
to occupations of which they were almost utterly
ignorant. Some time since, the writer saw a
letter from a respectable settler in one of the
large towns in Australia, in which these errors
and their melancholy consequences were very
feelingly deplored. We have not access to the
letter, and therefore cannot quote it; but it was
something to this effect:—
Hundreds of young women are landed in this
country who ought never to have left England.
We have housemaids offering their services who
never, probably, made a bed or swept a room ;
cooks who do not know how to make a pudding
or roast a joint of meat; maids-of-all-work who
have to be taught the simplest operations before
they can perform them ; nursemaids who are apt
at teaching our children only those tilings of


which it is blissful to be ignorant; and laun-
dresses who do not know how to get up a shirt or
starch a collar. All these seem at first coming
to think they have employers in their power;
they expect to receive very high wages, are
independent and saucy, will not bear to be
reproved, nor submit to be instructed. It is the
same with many young women who aspire to
higher situations—professing, for instance, to be
governesses, and themselves as ignorant as the
children they undertake to teach. It seems as if
it were thought in England that anything is good
enough to send to Australia : but these poor girls
soon find out their mistake: they leave place
after place, and sink from one degree of wretched-
ness to another, till they fall a prey to seduction
and are ruined.
The same person goes on to speak of the
numbers of poor outcasts who wander in the
streets of the Australian towns subsisting on the
wages of iniquity; and regrets that greater pre-
cautions should not be taken by those benevolent
persons in England—or rather, in the United
Kingdom—who interest themselves in assisting
single young women to emigrate.
There is no reason to doubt that these state-


merits and complaints were well founded. The
writer has known an instance in which a young
woman was about to be shipped off to Sydney
because she was such a trouble to her friends at
home, they did not know what to do with her.
Her moral character was questionable, her temper
and habits disagreeable, and her qualifications
as a servant were of the lowest order, while,
apparently, she was incapable of much improve-
ment in this respect. From some cause or other,
the intention was set aside: it was not however
any difficulty with regard to sending her that put
a stop to it; but, we believe, a repugnance in the
girl herself to being transported, as she miglit
have termed it. But others, of similar character,
and under similar circumstances, have been
advised and encouraged and assisted to emigrate,
with what success, let the communication
referred to witness. Now, we have reason to
believe, a greater degree of care and caution is
exercised by those who are most anxious to pro-
mote female emigration ; and it is requested that
the young female emigrant to whom this book is
addressed, will not think that any personal reflec-
tion upon herself is intended by these details, but
that they are given to show that the same moral


qualities and practical qualifications which are
needed to make a valuable member of society at
home, are precisely those which are required
elsewhere.
And now, let the question be repeated—What
shall you do when the voyage is over? It will
be well for you, if you have not hitherto thought
much about it, to reflect a little upon your real
capabilities, and think how far you were fit,
before you left home, to enter upon any parti-
cular employment or kind of service. Whatever
you have learned in England, or wherever your
home may have been, you will be able to practise
in New South Wales, or anywhere else; d
whatever ignorance or inaptitude may have
characterized you at home will not be removed
by the mere fact of your having crossed the ocean.
It will not be wise in you, when you reach your
destination, to make pretensions to knowledge
which you do not possess; neither will it be
honest.
Especially, be cautioned—and take the caution
in good part—against seeking to “ better your con-
dition,’’ as you may suppose, by looking out for
a “light and genteel occupation.” In every
aspect of the case, this is likely to end in severe


disappointment. Even if you have some know-
ledge or acquirements which many other young
women do not possess, be advised not to lay much
stress, nor depend much upon them ; but be satis-
fied with employment which will call forth your
active energies, leaving it to time and favourable
circumstances to prove the higher qualifications
by which you may be distinguished. Better be
well employed, well fed, and well paid in a kitchen
as a servant-of-all-work, than be striving in vain
for subsistence as a needlewoman. And, though
you may have a knowledge of a dozen different
branches of polite education, it will be better to
be respected as a useful nursemaid, than to be
commiserated as a poor, distressed, unemployed
governess. Of course, if one young person can do
nothing else but make dresses and caps, and
another nothing else but teach French and music,
with kindred accomplishments, they must turn
these capabilities to account in the best way they
can ; but it is to be hoped that such as these are not
encouraged to emigrate to a country where they
would be so entirely useless. We are quite sure,
however, that young persons are not necessarily
ignorant of domestic duties because they are ac-
quainted with other branches of female education ;


and also that a well trained and well educated
young woman, though she may not have had much
previous practice in household work, may turn to
it at any time if she will only heartily give her
mind to it: it is the altogether ignorant of whom
such complaints as we have referred to have been
made. We say again, then, most earnestly to our
young readers, set your minds at once—though
to do so should break a dozen glittering bubbles
of fancy—to cast away all notions about u genteel
occupations,” which would interfere with your
useful and industrious, profitable and honourable
employment in domestic service.
The writer does not wish to call up a blush by
rudely drawing away the veil that hides your
secret thoughts ; but it may be hinted that, pro-
bably, you are indulging the expectation of some-
thing beyond interested service for others. Your
imagination occasionally sketches a pleasant home
and its accompaniments, of which you may possibly
be the mistress. We shall venture a few words
on this subject in another chapter; and we only
hint at it here to show what qualifications are
looked for, not only in the servants, but in the
wives of settlers ; and though the following pas-
sages are written in relation to the Australian


colonies, they are applicable—so far as qualifica-
tions are concerned—to every emigrant country.
“ Another class of persons much wanted in
Australia is that of females. If taken out under
parental protection, or under the auspices of the
London committees for the purpose of female
emigration, too many can scarcely be sent. Much
will, however, depend upon themselves. Aus-
tralian settlers are, generally, well to do in the
world, and have, so far, the means of offering
desirable homes; but they have discrimination
as to what is wanted to make a home desirable.
Industrious young women, even though with
little pretensions to beauty, would not be long in
finding such homes; but fine ladies, possessing
nothing beyond the trashy accomplishments which
in England are thought so much of, would not
only not succeed in forming favoui’able alliances,
but would run great risk of the lowest social
degradation Young women who con-
template emigrating should remember that the
settlers require industrious, domestic wives, and
that they are sufficiently acute not to take any
other. The success of such has been very great;
and, unhappily, the degradation of females of an
opposite character has been very great also


Useless [would-be] fine ladies are completely
out of place in Australia; they are not likely to
marry: the number already in the colony for
educational purposes is overdone ; they will not
condescend to become servants ; and they cannot
get back to England. Reduced to a penniless
condition, many have been driven to the necessity
of offering what little service they have it in their
power to give, for their food and shelter.
But to the introduction of industrious, unpretending
girls, whether as wives or servants, there need
be scarcely any limit. The step is, however, a
serious one, and cannot be recalled : once made, it
must result in great good or great evil—there is
nothing intermediate. The home, whenever
found, will be a plentiful one, but it will be an
industrious one. Indeed, without constant occu-
pation, the life of a woman in the Australian bush
would be insupportable. Shut out from the world,
without other amusement than that arising from
her duty to home, industry becomes to her a
necessary of life Not that she would
run any risk of wanting such comforts of life as
are attainable; bushmen are proverbially kind-
hearted, and nothing would be wanting on their
part to comply with a wife’s wishes, as far as they


could be complied with ; but a want of many
social comforts must be expected, till society
should draw nearer to them, or they to society.”*
We shall not dispute with the writer of the
above whether “ trashy accomplishments ” are so
much more highly esteemed in England than they
are in Australia, though we venture to think they
are not, except among the ignorant and foolish
and vain. But letting that opinion go for what
it is worth, there is much in the foregoing extract
for the young female emigrant to reflect on. It
is not given for the purpose of directing your
thoughts towards matrimony, nor to prompt you
to put on a show of homely, industrious qualities,
by which to gain admiration, or even employment.
But it is given that you may see and feel the ne-
cessity of cheerfully and determinately abandoning
the thought—if you have had such a thought—of
making much of what, in your new country, will
be called “ trashy accomplishments,” and as
cheerfully and determinately, and in honest up-
rightness of intention, cultivating and improving
yourself, by all the means in your power, in those
domestic attainments which—in Australia at any
rate —are so highly and so justly prized.
* G. B. Earp, in “ The Gold Colonies of Australia.”


CHAPTER 111.
The voyage is yet before you ; —how will you
employ your time while it lasts ?
This is another of those questions, you will
perhaps say, which is easier asked than answered.
A life at sea is so strange to you, that until you
have made some trial of it, and the novelty has
worn away, you will not be able to settle down to
regular employment; nor can you, indeed, imagine
that this will be required of you, or even practi-
cable. Permit the writer, then, without entering
very minutely into particulars, to offer a few
suggestions which may be useful to you.
It is presumed that you form one of a rather
numerous company of unmarried females—mostly
young, and therefore inexperienced. You occupy
a separate part of the ship, and are, to a certain
extent, under the control of one who is termed
the matron. From her you will receive direc-
tions, so far as daily occupation is concerned ;it


will be her duty, also, to keep a watch over your
general conduct; and you will be entitled to look
to her, in any difficulty, for advice and assistance.
If, then, you would pass through the voyage
either creditably or comfortably, it is of the utmost
importance for you to be obedient and respectful
towards the matron. We fear that some young
women of high spirit, as it is termed, might rather
demur at this advice, and say that they did not
expect to have a mistress on board ship; but, if
the matron behaves properly to them, they will
behave properly to her. A great deal of mischief
results from this sort of feeling, and often an
emigrant voyage has been made disagreeable
throughout, by the suspicion and jealousy and
irritation it creates. The young woman starts
upon the voyage with the false idea that the
matron is placed over her as a spy, and looks
upon her rather as an enemy than a friend; she
whispers her opinion to others, and the discontent
spreads ; obedience is unwillingly rendered, petty
annoyances are practised ; and it needs all the
wisdom and forbearance the matron can exercise
to subdue the evil, or keep it within bounds.
Sometimes, it may be, the matron is somewhat
impatient in spirit too; and then, though she


have right on her side, her position is a very
painful one : irritation is met with irritation, until,
at length, the commander of the ship is compelled
to interfere, with his superior and sometimes
harsh authority, to quell the disorder; and all
parties are heartily tired of each other, and of the
voyage before it is half over.
To avoid such sad consequences as these, we
entreat you to bear in mind that the authority
exercised by the matron is alike essential to
proper order in the ship, and to your own in-
dividual comfort. Indeed, there must be autho*
rity somewhere ; and, on all accounts, it is desir-
able that it should be placed in the hands of one
of your own sex. So far, then, from being in-
clined to rebel, every right-minded and thoughtful
young person will be ready to yield willingly and
even thankfully to the arrangements made for her
own benefit. You may rest satisfied that some
care has been taken to place over you one whose
age and character entitle her to your respect, and
whose experience fits her to be your counsellor.
Instead, therefore, of being impatient of control,
and combining with others, as some thoughtlessly
may do, to render her duty both difficult and un-
pleasant, it will be your wise and proper course


to listen to her suggestions and lighten her burden
of responsibility by cheerful compliance with her
requirements.
There is nothing, perhaps, that will more check
any disposition to discontent with the arrange-
ments to which you are required to submit, than
regular and constant employment. There are
other advantages, also, which it will bring. It
will be beneficial to your bodily health—prevent
your mind from dwelling too much upon the
recent separation which you have had to sustain,
and prepare you, or rather keep you in a state
of preparation for active duties when the voyage
is over. We may add, also, that it will assist
powerfully in preserving you from many tempta-
tions to evil which might otherwise assail you,
while the voyage lasts.
What those regular employments should be,
may safely be left, we think, to the direction of
your friend, the matron; they must depend, in
part, upon your own character and acquirements.
You will find, however, that some duties will be
required of you as passengers. You will have to
keep your own berth, and to assist in keeping
your apartment both clean and neat; to take your
share in attending to the sick, if there are any in


your part of the ship, in washing up eating and
drinking vessels, and in preparing tables for
meals. There will also be washing days, ana
you will have to wash your own clothes. But
these duties will take up but a small part of your
time. Probably, you will be provided with
needlework; and this will be your afternoon
employment. Besides this, you will have many
opportunities for reading and writing: and if, in
your earlier life, from any cause, your education
in these acquirements has been neglected, you
will be thankful, we trust, for the leisure of the
voyage, which may be turned to such good ac-
count, and for the arrangements which no doubt
will be made for instruction and mutual improve-
ment. Neither will you neglect proper exercise
—such as may be conveniently taken on deck ;
but we earnestly advise you to pay a strict and con-
scientious regard to the injunctions and regulations
of the matron in this particular. Unless you are
sick, you will be required to rise early : your hour
for retiring to rest will be fixed for you; and no
wise and prudent young person will attempt, or
even wish, to break through these necessary rules.
There will, most likely, be some, and perhaps
many days when regular employment must be set


aside—individually in case of sickness, and gene-
rally in rough and stormy weather: but, apart
from these hindrances, there is no reason why a
young woman on board an emigrant ship should
not be as fully and industriously occupied as she
would be on land; and we are quite sure her
happiness will be promoted just in proportion as
she is thus occupied.
u Be kindly affectioned one toward another,”
is a Scripture exhortation which you will do well
continually to keep in mind. Among those of
your fellow passengers with whom you will have to
associate during the voyage, will be all sorts, or,
at least, many sorts, of tempers ; and unless there
is much forbearance exercised by some, there
will probably be a great deal of confusion, and
perhaps constant bickerings and quarrellings.
Avoid every cause of dispute, then ; and make up
your mind rather to endure wrong than to make
yourself and all around you. uncomfortable by
asserting your rights, at all hazards and in a per-
emptory manner.
Be considerate and helpful, also, to those around
you. Do not grudgq a little trouble in waiting
on a sickly companion, or in teaching one who is
ignorant. Every exertion of this sort that you


make will be useful in keeping your mind in an
active and healthy state, and in obtaining for you
a good report when the voyage is over. If you
have friends among the married passengers, you
will, as a matter of course, devote much of your
time and helpfulness in their service—as much, at
any rate, as they require. And if you have not,
it will be strange if you cannot, in one way or
other, assist some overburdened mother of a family
who does not know what to do, or how to get
through one day after another with her multiplied
cares, in nursing or needle work, or minding or
amusing her children.
While giving free scope, however, to kindliness
and helpfulness to all around you, be guarded in
your communications. It is not necessary for
you to open your mind, or disclose your circum-
stances, or narrate every event in your past life,
indiscriminately to every fellow passenger; and
you will act wisely in maintaining a proper re-
serve on these matters. It is a mistake which
many young people fall into, to suppose that
every body must feel as much interested as they
do, in what only, or principally concerns them-
selves. And they are sometimes led on by their
feelings, or by vanity, or by a wish for sympathy,


to speak freely where silence would be both more
becoming and more prudent. At other times, a
love of display leads to frivolity and “ foolish
talking and jesting,” which we are told, on the
highest authority, are “ not convenient.” Be
advised, then, to bear this in mind; and while
careful yourself not to overstep the bounds of
propriety, be careful, too, not to encourage in
other young women around you anything like
gossiping and tattling, by appearing to be inte-
rested and amused by such conversation.
Above and beyond all, “ let no corrupt com-
munication proceed out of your mouth,” and
determine resolutely not to listen to such. There
is danger sometimes, where a number of young
women of various habits are brought together and
live in freedom of intercourse with each other—
even though the principles and character of each
may be what is called “ good ” —yes, there is a
danger of improper, unbecoming speech, w r hich
ought to crimson the check of the hearer with the
blush of offended modesty. Thoughtlessly uttered
it may be at first ; but, unchecked and unreproved,
such communications are apt to be repeated till
purity of thought is contaminated, and perhaps
virtue undermined, “ Avoid,” dear young reader,


“ the very appearance of evil ” in this, as in every
other particular. You cannot tell where the end
will be if once you can listen complacently to
those “ evil communications ” which “ corrupt
good manners,” and tend towards the downward
paths of vice. Constant occupation will do much
to check this kind of communing; and the eye
and ear of the matron will be on the alert to
interpose an additional check ; but much will de-
pend on yourself—your own prayerful watchful-
ness—and your constant remembrance that the
eye of God is upon you, his.presence always sur-
rounding you ; that he hears not only the words
you speak, but penetrates the most secret thoughts
of your soul.
If it be so desirable for you, on all accounts, to
be guarded in your intercourse with other young
women, it is, at least, equally necessary for you
to hold yourself in severe restraint in word,
thought, and action, towards the other portion of
your fellow passengers; u keeping your heart
with all diligence.” It will be impossible, and
perhaps undesirable, for you to avoid all inter-
course with other passengers on board ; but it is
of the highest importance that you beware of
giving any kind of encouragement to any among


them to behave towards you with familiarity or
disrespect. Do nothing, we pray you, to attract
the attention of the young unmarried men, whom
you may perhaps see daily on deck; nor encourage
them, or any one of them, to think that you are
ready to form a matrimonial engagement, should
the opportunity fall in your way. In fact, you
ought not to be ready to do this. They must be
very peculiar circumstances, indeed, which would
justify a young woman on board an emigrant vessel
in forming such an engagement with one to whom
she was previously unknown. And though a very
few instances might be mentioned in which such
hasty and hazardous proceedings have turned out
more favourably than ought to have been expected,
the greater number of such cases have been
fraught with disaster or ruin, and given ground-
work enough for bitter repentance. We trust we
need not say more than this to incite in you that
circumspection which is due equally to your own
character and to those under whose protection you
are at present placed; but the magnitude of the
evil is such, and the temptation to some young
persons so strong, and the consequences of indis-
cretion so fatal to future happiness, temporal and
eternal, that a few more words must be added.


It is stated by one who has several times crossed
the ocean in emigrant ships, that none but those
who have made long voyages can imagine “ how
soon flirtations commence,” and how often young
women are beguiled by promises made only to be
broken. In the large and promiscuous company
of an emigrant ship, while there are many persons
of high and conscientious principle, there are
generally some who are unprincipled and reckless
of consequences. To amuse the tedium of the
voyage, and sometimes with a baser design than
this, such will endeavour by all means to gain the
attention of the young female passengers, profess
attachment, lead one and another into indiscretion,
excite their hopes, and gain their affections, and
then, when the voyage is over, leave them to their
fate. It is too well known that in Sydney and
other of the Australian ports and large towns,
there are, as at home, numbers of wretched women
subsisting on the wages of iniquity. “ I grieve
to say,” is the language of the witness just re-
ferred to, “ that, in consequence of the idleness
which used to prevail on board emigrant ships, the
young women too often arrived in the colonies
with tarnished characters ; and many, once young
and hopeful, are now amongst the most degraded


females.” Better arrangements have done much
to remove this sad drawback to female emigration ;
but enough yet remains to awaken the anxieties
of every one who has the female emigrant’s welfare
at heart, lest, while thinking herself secure in her
own strength, she too should fall.
In her own strength! And is it in your
own strength that you have set out on this long,
long voyage, and are braving so many dangers,
and are looking for future success? Are your
hopes and intentions founded on what, in your
own strength, you shall be able to accomplish p
Are your fears and anxieties lulled to rest by
reflections on your own strength—strength of
body, of mind, of purpose, of virtue, of endurance
and patience, of industry and perseverance ? Ah
no ! do you not rather feel how weak you are,
and helpless, and ignorant, and sinful ? And will
you not cling to Him who, in his word, engages
to give power to the faint, and strength to the
feeble, even to all who wait on him ?
In order that you may be thus Divinely
strengthened and guided, be concerned that a day
does not pass away unimproved by the perusal of
the Scriptures, and by earnest supplication to Him
who alone is able to keep you from falling. What-


ever be your regular employments besides, let
them all be sanctified by the word of God, and by
prayer. And if, unhappily, you have hitherto
thought but little of God and his grace, and the
way of access to him through the Lord Jesus
Christ; if until now you have neglected the
unerring guidance, rejected the omnipotent arm,
and set at naught the proffered counsel of the all-
wise God and Saviour, be persuaded now, with
confidence and love, to seek him while he may be
found, to call upon him while he is near.


CHAPTER IV.
Snares and dangers meet us on all sides in this
ivorld of sin and temptation, and young women,
n common with others, are exposed to them in
3very situation in life. The vigilance of parents
md the sanctity of home are not complete safe-
guards ; and on the day of leaving these imperfect
protections, snares are multiplied and dangers
ncrease. Every town abounds with them, and
the village servant-girl is no more exempt from
them than her sister in the populous city. If you
have been kept from all evil on board the emigrant
ship, you will still need “the wisdom which
cometh from above,” and which we are encouraged
to ask of God, with the promise that, asking in
faith, we shall receive it.
The writer would not, however, be understood
to mean that snares and dangers of any peculiar
kind, or in any augmented degree, will beset you
on your arrival at your future home. At one time,


indeed, this might have been said, so that it was a
step of extreme hazard for a young woman, un-
protected by friends or relations, to seek a home
by emigration ; but the case is now greatly altered
by judicious and kind arrangements which place
her at once under efficient protection. In the
neighbourhood of the Australian ports are esta-
blishments provided expressly for the reception of
young female emigrants, in which they are sup-
ported and allowed to remain, under the charge of
a matron, until engaged by persons of known re-
spectability ; or if their services are sought before
they leave the vessel, an emigration officer super-
intends every bargain between the employer and
the employed, and, where needful, warns the
inexperienced emigrant against any particular
engagement which might expose her to peril.
Thus, a young woman seeking service in Australia
is more efficiently protected against the evil
designing than she would have been at home.
Let it be remembered, however, that the con-
duct of every young woman is carefully observed
during the voyage, and as carefully made the
subject of inquiry before her services are engaged ;
and many a young emigrant has on this account
had cause to look back with painful but unavail-


ing regret on the perverseness and levity of the
past, now imprinting a forbidding mark on her
character, and casting an early cloud over her
future prospects.
Apart from such cases as these, there is no
difficulty, nor much delay, in procuring honour-
able and well paid employment; and leaving
you, young reader, to commence your course
under the kindly direction referred to, we offer
a few last “ parting words.”
In whatever situation you may be placed,
remember that the same general course of con-
duct which, you know, would have been necessary
at home to preserve respectability of character,
and attain the good will of employers, and to con-
duce to future advancement, must be pursued,
wherever you are, to bring about the same results.
Remember too, that the plain and express com-
mands of God will be as binding upon you in one
part of the world as in another. It was as much
for Australia and New Zealand and America, as
for England, or Scotland, or Ireland—as much
for countries where servants are comparatively
scarce, as for those where they are plentiful, that
such exhortations as these were written in the Holy
Scriptures;—“ Exhort servants to be obedient


unto their own masters, and to please them well in
all tilings; not answering again ; not purloining,
but showing all good fidelity.’’—“ Servants, obey
in all things your masters; not with eyeservice, as
menpleasers ; but in singleness of heart, fearing
God.”
Be economical, also. If you should enter into
domestic service in one of the towns of your new
country, there will be, as there are at home, many
temptations for you to squander what you receive
as fast as you can earn it. If you yield to these
temptations, the comparatively high wages you
may receive will do you little good. We know
that this caution is not unnecessary, inasmuch as
many industrious young persons in your circum-
stances, finding themselves so much better off
than they ever expected to be at home, suddenly
become ambitious to appear to the best advan-
tage, as they mistakenly suppose, and spend their
ample wages in expensive garments and personal
ornaments. This is, to say the best of it, exceed-
ingly unwise; and we strongly recommend you
to enter upon your engagements, whatever they
may be, with a determination to be frugal. The
money you may save in the course of a few years’
domestic service will be of considerable advan-


tage to you at some future time. There are
savings’ banks in Australia, as in England.
Probably your first home, as well as succeeding
ones, may be far up the country. In this case,
you will be in danger of longing for more society,
and of giving way to regretful thoughts of your
old home and the friends you have left behind
you there. If you would be happy you must
strive against these feelings, by keeping your
body and mind fully employed in your present
duties. Not, however, that you should forget
that home and those friends. Wherever you are,
we trust you will bear them in mind lovingly and
effectually. Especially if you have parents, or
brothers or sisters in the old country, whom you
left struggling with difficulties, you should not be
satisfied with your own advancing prosperity,
until they have shared in it with you. You will
find that there are ways of sending even small
sums of money, easily and safely, to your native
land; and what you can spare, from time to
time, without the sacrifice of a single comfort,
may be the means of yielding many a comfort to
a beloved parent. There have been instances in
which a kind daughter has saved, and sent home
sufficient money to pay the passage of her father
e 2


and mother, or of a single surviving parent, to
the land in which God, in his providence, has
dealt bountifully with her. This may never be
in your power, or the circumstances of your
friends at home may not be such as to need your
pecuniary help ; but, at all events, keep up with
them as frequent a correspondence as you can.
A letter from a child, or a sister abroad—none
can tell how welcome it is, and how highly prized,
but those who have received one.
And now with regard to the other subject,
respecting which you may have some thoughts in
reserve. Many foolish things have, as the writer
believes, been written and spoken about the
facility for getting husbands in Australia; as
though a young woman would have nothing to do
but to step on shore and make choice of a future
partner, and as though young men in that country
were so desperately placed as to be but too glad
to rush to an emigrant ship, scramble up its
sides, and take the first unengaged young woman
he might meet with, as a wife. Such representa-
tions as these are extremely mischievous, and
they have but very slight foundation in fact.
Still it is true that, because the Australian
colonics are generally prosperous, and for other


reasons, there is greater probability than at home
of young women of good character and industrious
habits obtaining a plentiful and so far a comfort-
able home by marriage. Thus it is not unlikely
that, before many years have passed away, you
may have become the wife of an Australian
settler, and the mistress of an Australian home.
But be warned of entering into an engagement
of this nature hastily or thoughtlessly. Be fully
aware that there needs as much precaution in this
particular, in the land to which you are going, as in
that which you have left behind; and let no prospect
of future prosperity, no false ambition to be other
than you are, and no uneasy desire for change,
tempt you to become the wife of a man whose
character and habits you cannot, in your con-
science, approve. Be assured that, all over
the world, marriage is one of the most serious
affairs of human life, and one therefore that needs
the most deliberate caution.
And in order that in this, and in all your
future course, you may be preserved from all evil,
and not only be happy in yourself, but be made
the source of happiness to others, how earnestly
should you seek the blessing of Divine grace and
guidance—the help and sanctifying influences of
