OWSER our hero was only a pup. He really was
not very high; was wayward and wild, he’d not
quite grown up; was black-patched across his
left eye. His body was white, his heart full of
fight. His tail had been lost at his birth. He had
in his eye a dare-devil light and his shape was the
cause of much mirth.
His kennel was placed alongside a lake into which
he’d spring day by day. He’d swim for a while,
then come out and shake, a prelude to frolic and
play. Now, Towser was never allowed inside of
the house, to his great disgust. He never forgot
that once when he’d tried, how quickly outside
he’d been thrust.

IS worries were naught; he ne’er had a care,
’cept cook in the kitchen, so grim. Her he
respected, knew when to beware. A keen eye
she’d always on him. All pups, as you know,
have mischievous ways, and Towser was not
unlike these. You’ll find that with ease, they can
pass their days in doing the things that displease.
’Twas not at all fair, as Towser will tell, inside
there resided a dog, who simply reclined on
cushions so swell and slept all the day like a log.
’Twas one of those dogs which ladies adore. It
had a warm bath twice a week. ’Twas pampered
and spoilt and was a real bore. To Towser ’twas
naught but a freak.

HEY called it “darling,” and “pet,” and “love,”
and ever its praises were sung. It broke Towser’s
heart when, oft from above, they’d call to him,
“Beat it you mong.” And in his dog mind dire
vengeance he vowed. He said, “This dog’s neck
I shall wring. If e’er the chance comes, I swear
it aloud, I’ll murder the poor useless thing.”
It happened one day that Fido did stray outside
into Towser’s domain. At last it had come, the
chance to repay all the slurs, again and again.
Loud howls rent the air and screams of great pain
as Towser’s teeth sank in his neck. A half
strangled dog just struggled in vain, and out of
the fray came a wreck.

O Towser was whipped—he felt very sore —
and chained for the whole of a week. He said,
“Though I’m tied, I’ve evened my score, ’twas
worth it, the poor yellow streak. He oft found
it fun to tease master’s cat. In fact he would ne’er
miss the chance of pulling her tail and giving
back chat to puss about whom he would prance.
A most happy day was Monday to him, ’mongst
washing spread out on the line. He’d hang by his
teeth and o’er the ground skim, and swing to and
fro —it was fine. The garden had spots that to him
looked good for planting old bones that he found.
In order to hide all kinds of his food he loved to
dig deep underground.

'NE day he was caught, yes, right in the act.
He’d just placed a bone in a hole. The air
resounded with yelps, it’s a fact, and then to his
kennel he stole. To Towser there came joys of
life each day, excitements that small dogs adore.
And there was never a day passed away which
he e’er had cause to deplore.
And now, I regret the tale must be told, his mistress
had left wide the door of her nice clean house, so
Towser grew bold, stepped in and put mud on the
floor. He strolled at his leisure from room to room,
bespoiling the lovely old home. He smelt it, and
sniffed, and peered in the gloom, continued to
sniff and to roam.

OW Towser was sure that no one was in, not
even poor Fido his foe. He started to bark and
make such a din, and then jumped, and raced to
and fro. And then he grew tired. Now Towser
had spied on a chair, a nice downy heap. He
sprang on this pile, and lay on his side and very
soon fell fast asleep.
“Oh, what a bad dog,” came loud to his ear. He
found himself lifted up by... the scruff of his neck.
He felt rather queer but resigned himself with
a sigh. Poor Towser tried hard, so hard to be
good. Would ne’er any luck come his way? He
wished he could live as a small dog should, be a
good little dog each day.

.E thought, “It is hard for me to be good, yet
where is the harm that I’ve done. I’ve always
tried as much as I could to behave, and bad ways
to shun. Now why can’t a dog dig holes in the
ground in order to bury his bones? And why
can’t he trounce that Fido, the hound who is
nothing but grunts and groans?”
“And what is so strange, he’s always inside, and
yet I am not allowed there. If he would come out
I’d tattoo his hide, but I’m sure he never would
dare.” He repeated each day this vain monologue,
found cheer in his thousands of fleas. They kept
him from “brooding on being a dog,” and all his
small troubles helped ease.

W''!
OON after he’d made his dreadful mistake, when
he’d fallen asleep inside, the son of the house
fell into the lake, and no one was standing beside.
Towser, at once, to his rescue did run, and
springing far into the pond, in his teeth grabbed
the coat of his master’s son and dragged him to
safety, beyond.
When master was told of Towser’s brave deed,
“A fat juicy bone every day,” without more
ado he warmly decreed, “Shall be his for ever and
aye.” And Towser, pleased, said, “I’ll atone, I’d
sooner be good than be bad. A life of great ease,
a nice juicy bone, are more than most dogs
have had.”
