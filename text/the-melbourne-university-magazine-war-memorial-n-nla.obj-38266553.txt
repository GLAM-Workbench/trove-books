Foreword
1 his volume is the result of co-operation between the
graduates and undergraduates of the University. The de-
cision to publish it was made at a conference between the
Students’ Representative Council and delegates from the
Melbourne University Association. Members of the associa-
tion have been unflagging in tHelr zeal, and have given the
financial guarantee, without which the work could not have
been attempted. The actual task of compilation has been
performed by the magazine staff for the year 1919.
The volume has three main divisions. The first comprises
the official Roll of Honour, revised by Mr. E. D. Ulrich.
The second consists of photographs and brief accounts of the
fallen. In the third division, an attempt has been made to
record the many phases of war experience, and to summarise
the peculiar service rendered by the University. Special
thanks are due to Captain C. E. W. Bean for his articles on
the generals who came from our University. Apart from
these articles, the whole production is the work of past or
present students of the University.
The task has been very great. The undergraduates who
have been engaged on the work soon realised the enormous
difficulties standing in the way of the compilation of an ex-
haustive record. Voluntary work “after hours’’ can do
much, but there is still more to be done, and it is to be ex-
pected that the University will devote time and money to the
completion of this record, building on the foundations that
have already been laid. Meanwhile, it is well to remember
that this Memorial is due to the spontaneous action of
students, past and present; that it is the result of their
labour, undertaken willingly; and that it is therefore inspired
by a feeling of comradeship for those who fought, and those
who gave their lives.

Lieutenant=General Sir John Monash.
BY C. E. W. BEAN.
WHEN the formation of the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade was begun,
very shortly after that of the Ist Australian Division, Colonel
Monash, who had been acting as Censor, was appointed to command
it. He arrived in Egypt with the 4th Brigade at the end of January,
1915. The 4th Brigade was incorporated with the New Zealand Brigade
and two mounted brigades into the New Zealand and Australian Division;
and it was as one of the Brigadiers of that Division that Colonel Monash sailed
for Lemnos and Gallipoli.
It was towards dusk on the day of the Landing that the 4th Brigade
began to land, and on April 25th and 26th it was mostly pushed up to the
position which till the day of the evacuation was the key of the Anzac
position —the head of the main gully up which nearly the whole of our com-
munications ran. At the head'of the two forks of that valley the 4th Brigade
established itself on the first evening as the troops who had landed earlier
fell gradually back; and there, until the end of May, this great brigade
remained. Pope’s Hill, Quinn’s Post, and Courtney’s Post all took their
names from oflicers of the 4th Brigade; and the left fork of the all-important
gully will carry for all time the name of Monash Valley.
The fighting during this first month at Quinn’s Post was more con-
tinuous than at any point on the whole Peninsula, and the strain on the
commander at the little headquarters, well in sight of every Turkish sniper In
that fatal valley, was very great. But the brigade was withdrawn at the begin-
ning of June, and when the great night attack which constituted the second
offensive at Anzac was launched in August, the 4th Brigade led out as the
extreme left-hand column, with its objective on the great hill generally known
as 971. In the planning of the details of this march and the attack by which
it w T as followed, the brigadier showed for the first time, so far as most of
those who watched with great interest his career were concerned, the wonder-
ful care in preparation and lucidity in exposition which marked his handling
of the great operations w'hich three years later helped to close the war.
When, through a chance which could not have been foreseen, the night
march of the 4th Brigade was held up in the small hours at a time of extreme
crisis, Colonel Monash went to the head of the column, and on the spot
came to the decision as to the route which brought the brigade out, in the
growing light, at the head of Australia Valley in the tangled foothills of the
great hill, where the advance ended.
Gen. Monash’s brigade, after the evacuation, was allotted to the 4th
Australian Division, and came with It to Europe very shortly before the Ist
Anzac Corps moved down to the battle of the Somme. At this time the
battalions of the 3rd Australian Division were just arriving in England, and
Gen. Monash w’as sent to England to command and train the new division.
That remarkable division was his child, and to the end of the war it bore
in the clearest fashion the impress of his work. The scheme of its training
was extraordinarily interesting, and the value attached by the War Council
to the division is shown by the fact that arms were issued to it far before its
time, and the most complete equipment ever, till then, allotted to a division


in England. It came over to France towards the end of 1916, where Gen.
Monash took over the command from Gen. Franks at Armentieres. Ihe
division joined the New Zealand Division in the and Anzac Corps. With the
New Zealanders and the 4th Australian Division beside it it was launched
into the Battle of Messines on June 7th, 1917- In the working out of the
details of that battle, the general again exhibited that extreme care through
all the intricate details of organisation which always greatly impressed the
Higher Command, and gave confidence to the men. ihose who worked under
Gen. Monash always knew that the bombs would arrive in time; that the
hot meals would reach them at the right hour; that the supply of barbed wire
would be greater than they were likely to need; that nothing would fail
them which careful forethought could provide—at the exact time and place.
Gen. Monash fought his division in the and Anzac Corps through the
great battles before Paschendaele; and immediately afterwards, it for the first
time joined all its sister divisions of the A.I.F. and formed with them the
Australian Corps under command of Gen. Birdwood. In the winter, in the
line near Messines, it took its turn in and out of the line with them. During the
absence of Gen. Birdwood and Gen. Walker (Ist Division), at one period, Gen.
Monash commanded the Australian Corps. When the Germans broke through
the sth Army in the spring the 3rd Division happned to be in rest. It was
hurried south at all speed; and on March 26th its leading units began to
debouch in front of the enemy in the triangle between the Somme and the
Ancre, a few miles east of Amiens. It stopped the German advance upon its
front along the line which Gen. Monash had been instructed to take up;
and from that day onwards, along with its sister divisions, it began to eat
into the German line with that corroding process which culminated a few
months later in the stroke which made the climax of the war.
At the end of May, Gen. Birdwood was given command of the sth Army,
and Gen. Monash was appointed in his place to the command of the Aus-
tralian Corps, with the rank of Lieut.-General. His Chief of Staff, who
succeeded Gen. White, was Brig.-Gen. T. A. Blaney. A month later the new
commander attempted his first operation in the attack on the village of Hamel,
which had been in German hands since the beginning of April. This attack
was planned with the same care as Messines. It was a big battle in minia-
ture. It involved an experiment with tanks. It was a complete success. It
became a model attack, printed in pamphlet form for the rest of the army
to study. And when on August Bth the Australian and Canadian Corps, with
British and French on their flanks, were launched side by side in the offensive
which set the limit to the war, the system used at Hamel was made the
model of the great operation.
That day was probably Gen. Monash’s greatest success; but it was fol-
lowed up by blow upon blow of immense effect—Bray, Proyart, Barleux,
Mont St. Quentin and Peronne, the Hindenburg Outpost Line, and finally
the breaking of the Hindenburg Line near Bellicourt—all of them battles
which the greatest commanders in history might be proud to blazon on
their banners. In every one of these the same careful planning of detail,
the same lucidity of exposition which marked the arrangements for the 4th
Brigade in the night attack at Anzac and the plans for the battle of Messines
were obvious to everyone engaged. When the war closed, and Lieut.-Gen.


Sir John Monash went from the fighting in France to take over the direction
of demobilisation in England, he brought with him a reputation for capacity
in the organisation of warfare such as scarcely any other corps commander
achieved.
John Monash.
BY J.B.
WHEN the writer had not been long at the University he made the
acquaintance of an Arts student, a dark youth, who always carried
a sturdy walking-stick, and was of a somewhat enterprising and
energetic character. Though in different schools, similar tastes brought us
much together, and started a friendship that has lasted for over thirty years.
The dark youth was John Monash, and he soon made his presence felt at
the University. He was to the front in all movements, and his strenuous —
almost aggressive—personality, if it did not make enemies, at least caused
some unpopularity and jealousy. However, even those who criticised most
freely were themselves eager to push him into any position requiring initiative
and energy. The writer, in his long experience, found him the staunchest,
most reliable, and generous of friends, and as years passed, developed a
higher appreciation of his other qualities. He did a distinguished Arts
course. Finding the practical application of this course limited in extent,
he commenced an Engineering course. Before this was completed, however,
financial reasons compelled him to obtain employment. In those days exhibi-
tions and scholarships were not as plentiful and easily earned as now. The
writer obtained him this employment with the engineering firm that employed
himself—a firm with the most extensive workshops in the States, with
numerous quarries, saw mills, etc., owning quite a fleet of vessels for carry-
ing timber, etc., from other States, employing several thousand men, and
having numerous railway, bridge and other contracts. For instance, it was
building the Queen’s Bridge, the Falls Railway, Princes and the Burnley
Bridge, and widening the Victoria-street Bridge at the same time. In the
same employment were Mr, George Higgins, Mr. W. R. Rennick, Mr. S.
R. Dawson, and other distinguished University engineers. John Monash dis-
tinguished himself here; he was extremely thorough in his work, and willingly
undertook any duty. It was sufficient for him to be told to do a thing.
Even if he had never heard of it before he would find a way to do it, and
do it better than those who had long experience at it. He left here to act
as engineer for the firm of contractors building the Outer Circle line, and
carried out the work with great success. While at this work he completed his
Engineering course, coming out top of the Final Honours, and winning the
Final Scholarship. This he did without attending lectures and on notes bor-
rowed from the writer. In lending them I remarked that I hoped he would
s*


be able to make some use of them, as I could not make head or tail of them
myself. He was quite indignant with me when returning them, and said that
he found them perfectly good notes. After this he did a large variety o
engineering work. In one case where he and his then partner (Mr. Ander-
son) had built an aerial ropeway for a mining company, over which there
was a dispute, 1 was called in to give expert evidence. I was then struck
with the very thorough way in which he had prepared the case, anticipating
every possible move of his adversaries. About this time he earned a great
reputation for conducting arbitration cases, of which there were a greai
many being fought. In order to be thoroughly equipped for this work, he
did the Law course in his leisure, and obtained his LL.B. degree. In all
this time his principal hobby was his military work. While at the University
he was an enthusiastic member of the University Rifles, and made some
invention in connection with artillery that was generally adopted. Not that
this was his only hobby; among other things, he was a pianist of great
ability, and his literary work was of a high order. When the ‘ University
Review” was first established, he was appointed one of the editors (the others
being Judge Woinarski, Messrs. D. Wright and O’Hara Wood), and as
far as I can recollect he and Judge Woinarski did practically all the work.
A few years ago I attended a public function at which several men of repute
as public speakers took part, and I found his address greatly superior to
any of the others. What he had to say was more worth saying than anything
the others had to tell us, and it was much better said. Before the war he had
been appointed Chief Intelligence Officer, and early in the war Chief Censor,
but he seized the first opportunity to get to the front. When he informed me
with great delight of his appointment, I said that I hoped the war would be
over before he got there. He replied, ‘‘Don’t say that, after all our prepara-
tion we’d like to have a look in.” In writing since, I reminded him of that,
and asked if he had had a sufficient ‘‘look in” yet. As' he has not told me, I
suppose he has not.
Major=General Sir J. W. McCay.
BY C. E. W. BEAN.
WHEN the ist Australian Division was formed by Gen. Bridges he
chose for one of the commanders of his three infantry brigades
Col. J. W r . McCay, who had long been an officer in the militia, and
who had also been Minister for Defence. Col. McCay, being a Victorian,
commanded the 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade which went from Victoria.
He was in charge of the training of his brigade, and the manner in which
this training was planned and carried out was the first proof of a certain
brilliance which marked his instructional work both in Egypt and in England.
While the Ist Division was still at Mena the Turkish threat to the Suez Canal
caused a demand for reinforcements to be sent thither, and it was the 2nd


Brigade, under Col. McCay, which was the first amongst the Australian
infantry to enter the trenches in this war. The fight had, however, fizzled
out, and the Turks were withdrawing across the desert of Sinai undisturbed.
At the landing Gen. McCay’s brigade was the second to go ashore, and
the contingencies of that fierce fight threw it in upon the southern flank of
the Anzac position, where it fought bitterly for several days. Gen. McCay’s
headquarters was in a very uncomfortable washaway, raked by shrapnel, on
what afterwards came to be called McCay’s Hill.
A little more than a week after the landing, when Sir lan Hamilton had
decided that no further progress was to be made at Anzac and all efforts con-
centrated at Helles, Col. McCay’s Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry
Brigade were sent down from Anzac to reinforce the British and breach at
the toe of the Peninsula in a determined attack towards Achi Baba. It was
here, on May Bth, 1915, that Col. McCay received at about 5 in the afternoon
the order that his brigade was to be advancing to the attack in the line with the
New Zealanders, the British, and the French at 5.30. There was scarcely
time to get out the order to the troops. But the thing was accomplished.
B y 5-3°. or very little after, the first lines of the brigade were crossing the
“Tommies’ Trench,” which was the front line of the previous day. Ihe lines
went out into a hellish fire. It looked as though those who had gone ahead
into that storm could scarcely be expected to hold, and accordingly Gen.
McCay led the supports from the Tommies’ trench and placed his head-
quarters up in the front with the attacking line, in such a position as
perhaps no brigade headquarters in this war ever afterwards occupied. From
there he went round the line from left to right. Every member of his staff
was hit; but by some miracle he managed to survive till about 11 p.m.,
when he was badly wounded through the leg.
On his return from Egypt, before the leg had really mended itself, he
took up the command of his brigade in the sector opposite Johnstone’s Jolly.
The 2nd Division was then about to be formed in Egypt, and Col. McCay had
actually been picked for the command of it, when the bone of his leg, which
had never healed, snapped at a steep point in the trenches, and he was
invalided to Australia. He became Inspector-General, but was soon sent to
the front again to assume command of the sth Australian Division, which he
formed and trained in Egypt.
Gen. McCay had no sooner arrived with his division in France than it
was plunged into the deadly field of Fromelles. The division succeeded to
a degree which, looking back on the overwhelming difficulties of the task, its
postponement, and the certain foreknowledge of it by the enemy, seems
beyond everything that could have been expected. Fromelles left the divi-
sion faint with losses. After its gradual recovery of its first strength, it was
sent to join the Ist Anzac Corps in the midst of the Somme winter. Gen.
McCay was in charge of the first operations near Flers in November, the
troops being mainly those of the 2nd Division. The weather conditions made
these attacks quite impossible; and the stress of that winter told upon the
General also. After living it out for several months he was sent to take over
the command of the Australian troops training in England. Here the outstand-
ing ability in the instruction of troops which had been noticed in the training
of the 2nd Brigade in Egypt again marked his work, and he remained in
this position until the end of the war.


Brigadier=General Elliott.
BY C. E. W. BEAN.
COL. ELLIOTT was one of those original battalion commanders of the ist
Australian Division whose personal bravery was well known and
tested before ever they came on to a battlefield in this war. From
the day of the Landing, when he climbed over the foot of Shrapnel Gully and
up on to the heights of McCay’s Hill with the 7th Battalion, he was never
to be restrained from rushing like a bull into a fight wherever fighting was.
He believed, like Stonewall Jackson, that the personal intervention in a
battle of the commanding officer at a decisive moment might be trusted to
swing over the balance of success. As one of the most enthusiastic of our
militia soldiers, he had fed and grown up on the histories of old wars; and
more, peihaps, than any brigade commander in the A.I.F. he kept those old
battles consciously before him. He returned from convalescence in time to
take his battalion into the slaughterhouse of the “Pine,” where he amused
himself, as things settled down, by sniping in person at surprised lurks m
the comfortable positions which they did not realise that we now overlooked.
On the transfer of the force to Egypt he was appointed to the command
which he made his own to a greater degree than perhaps any other commander
that of the 15th (Victorian) Brigade. He commanded that brigade m the
murderous attempt upon the Sugar Loaf Salient at Fromelles. He worked
it almost to the bone in the very worst of the Somme winter. He pushed out
into the green country beyond Bapaume as an advance guard, with cavalry,
foot and guns complete—an expedition dimly reminiscent of his dearly loved
South Africa; he held it somehow through the appalling shellfire and con-
fusion of the German attack of September 25th at Polygon Wood, and
launched the reinforced remnants in a successful attack next day; he was
straining at the leash like a greyhound throughout a whole day for leave to
counterattack the Germans in Villers Brettonneux on April 24th of last
year until leave finally came, and the famous attack was launched and swiftly
succeeded. By his personal force of character rather than by any other
means he managed to keep his battalions, hopelessly attempting to cross the
Somme by footbridge, until a surprise movement in a very different direction
won the key to Peronne. He tried his battalions as few other commanders
did in fight and in fatigue, and from first to last he managed to keep their
real affection and their respect in a degree to which few even aspired. When
the regard which is now borne by men of the A.I.F. becomes the heritage
of the children of Australia, the honoured and well-loved name of “Pompey
Elliott”—for all his headstrong impetuosity—cannot help but become a house-
hold word.


Brigadier=General McNicoll.
BY C. E. W. BEAN.
MAJ. McNICOLL sailed from Australia as a major of the 7th Battalion,
On the departure of Col. Semmens, of the 6th Battalion, from Mena,
owing to iil-health, Maj. McNicoll was promoted to the command
of the 6th. He landed with it in Gallipoli, and in the early fighting he
became the recognised commander of a section of the line corresponding
roughly to that held by the 6th and 7th Battalions, and supervised in the front
line by Maj. Bennett. Col. McNicoll’s work, which amounted almost to that
of a briagde headquarters, was carried on from a point near Brown’s Dip.
When the 2nd Brigade went to Belles, Col. McNicoll, on leading his
men over, was hit just as the line crossed the “Tommies Trench.” The hurt
was not serious. He jumped up again and blew his whistle, and led the line
over into a hailstorm of bullets until about 250 yards across the heath, where
he fell very seriously wounded. The bullet seemed to have become involved
in the thigh bone near the joint, and for many months it was uncertain
whether he would ever make a recovery except that of a crippled man. An
operation fortunately restored him the use of his leg; and though it remains
stiff to this day, he was able to take the command' of the 10th (Victorian)
Brigade of the 3rd Division when this was raised in Australia. This brigade
he commanded almost to the end of the war. In spite of the lameness caused
by his wound he both walked and rode almost as well as an unwounded man.
He fought his brigade through the trench raids in the winter of 1916-17, and
through the battle of Messines. At Paschendaele it was faced with the
heaviest mud and the most insurmountable difficulties of ground in which
an Australian unit ever fought, with the possible exceptions of the conditions
which existed at Tiers. The 10th Brigade was famous for its raids, and
those carried out in the winter of 1917-1918 were the most important in
which Australians ever engaged. In the spring the brigade was one of the
first to stem the advance of the Germans when they broke through the
British line near the Somme. Gen. McNicoll commanded it in the great
counter offensive of August Blh and in the advance which followed. During
the period of Demobilisation he became Inspector of Education in the system
which occupied the months between the signing of the armistice and the
return of the troops.
Brigadier=General W. Grant.
AFTER graduating B.C.E. of this University in 1893, William Grant was
for two years employed on railway construction work in New South
Wales. Since then he has been engaged in pastoral pursuits on the
Darling Downs in Queensland.
His military career dates from Ist February, 1901, when he joined the
Light Horse. Since that date he has served continuously. For four years


prior to the outbreak of war he was in command of the Darling Downs Light
Horse regiment. When the war commenced he was appointed to the com-
mand of the nth Light Horse Regiment (A.1.F.), and landed with his unit
on Gallipoli. The regiment was split up for six months, during which time
he held the temporary command of the 9th A.L.H. Regiment. When the
A.I.F. returned to Egypt after the withdrawal, the nth A.L.H. Regiment
was re-formed, and he resumed command.
Pqj- work in connection with the Romani operations he was men-
tioned in despatches, and afterwards received the D.S.O. His performances in
connection with raids on Maghdaba and Nikhl, in the Sinai peninsula, were
most notable, and his conduct in the second battle of Gaza earned him
another mention in despatches. .
On August 13th, 1917, he was promoted Brigadier-General, with the
command of the 3rd A.L.H. Brigade. A month later he was transferred to
the 4th A.L.H. Brigade, and he held command of this until demobilised.
He was awarded a Bar to the D.S.O. by General Allenby on the field for
the capture of Beersheba, while for services rendered in the operations result-
ing in the fall of Jerusalem, the Sultan of Egypt conferred on him the Order
of the Nile. On June 3rd, 1918, he was promoted Brevet-Colonel in the
Australian Military Forces for distinguished services in the field.
For his services in the final campaign, which included the capture of
Damascus, he was awarded the C.M.G.
Captain Frank H. MacNamara, V.C.
CAPTAIN MacNAMARA gained his Victoria Cross in Palestine, and
was wounded at Gaza in April, 1917. Though bleeding from a severe
wound, he descended in his aeroplane to help a pilot whose machine
had been shot down behind the enemy’s lines. This was in the face of very
heavy rifle fire and the approach of hostile cavalry. Captain Rutherford
the pilot who had been brought down—climbed into MacNamara’s aeroplane,
but the machine swung round with the extra weight and was damaged.
Under constant heavy fire, the two ignited the machine. They then suc-
ceded in starting the engine in Rutherford’s machine, which was fortunately
double-seated, and MacNamara flew to an aerodrome 70 miles distant. Before
enlisting, Capt. MacNamara was a lieutenant in the 4th Infantry Regiment,
Brighton Rifles. Since returning, he has been instructing at Point Cook in
aviation.


Open Covenants Openly Arrived At.
BY J. G. LATHAM.
MOST Secret,” “Secret,” “Confidential,” “For Official Use Only”—
these were the words upon the left-hand top corner of most of the
documents with which the British Empire Delegation worked in
Paris. So far was the impulse to secrecy carried that even propaganda
material published for broadcast distribution by foreign delegations was some-
times circulated with the word “Secret” stamped across it. “Open coven-
ants openly arrived at” is more than a good platform phrase. The prin-
ciple which it expresses makes a natural appeal to the modern mind. Open
diplomacy, the democracies of the world agree, is desirable so far as possible
.—but even with democracies it is frequently the other fellow’s diplomacy
that it is desired to open up. In practice, it was found impossible to admit
the peoples of the world into the council chambers of the nations. “Mouth
shut, eyes and ears open,” was the rule at Paris. “Mouth shut” must still
be the rule for those who were entrusted with the duty of working there.
It is therefore impossible for me to relate any of the real secrets of the Peace
Conference with which I happen to be acquainted. Doubtless Mr. William
le Queux is already occupied with the fascinating task of providing diplo-
matic secrets for public consumption. It would be unreasonable to hope to
compete with such revelations, and I must therefore confine myself to less
intriguing details.
It is common to hear severe criticism of the secrecy of the proceedings.
The severity of the criticism, however, often varies inversely with the sense
of responsibility of the critic. Most of this criticism has appeared in the
press—and one function of the press is to fathom secrets for the purpose of
revealing them to an expectant public. It natural that the press should
be annoyed when, after the announcement of “open covenants opely arrived
at,” it was found that the press of the world was not to be admitted to the
inner discussions of the Allies. After a stern struggle, the press secured
admission to the meetings of the Peace Conference, with the not unexpected
result that important discussions were driven out of the Peace Conference
into secret councils, while the Conference itself was confined, as a rule, to
the duty of ratifying decisions which had been carefully prearranged. At a
later stage the press itself, although always restive, recognised the distinc-
tion which is illustrated between open debates in Parliament and private dis-
cussions in Cabinet. It was seen that this distinction is based upon real
necessities wffiich could not be ignored if there were to be any real chance
of the Allied Powers arriving at agreement amongst themselves.
The Allied and Neutral press had sent their ablest men to the Conference,
and when they failed to discover what was in fact being done, they either
guessed at it—sometimes most acutely—or filled their columns by reviling
the Conference for doing nothing. It was occasionally rather amusing to
know the facts, and to read an account of those facts in the press. But in
most cases the press was represented by men of great skill and ability, many
9


of whom made useful contributions to the discussions of subjects in which
they were specialists.
Each delegation adopted special measures for giving Information to its
own press. At the head of the Press Section working in liaison with the
Foreign Office was Sir George Riddell, president of the Newspaper Proprie-
tors’ Association, and one of the most popular men at the Conference. A
close friend and constant associate of Mr. Lloyd George, he was in a posi-
tion to know everything. Knowing everything, it was his difficult duty
daily to face a gathering of pressmen greedy for news, and to tell them
what it was deemed proper for them to know, and to try to satisfy their pro-
fessional voracity. Complete success in this task was manifestly impossible,
and it is therefore no mean compliment to Sir George Riddell to say that
he is still the friend of the leading statesmen of England, and still the leader
and friend of the journalists of Great Britain.
Many otherwise unintelligible circumstances connected with the Peace
Conference can be explained by the party politics of particular countries. In
the case of each of the five Great Powers, this was often apparent. Presi-
dent Wilson’s efforts to “make the world safe for the Democratic Party,”
enraged the Republicans up to and beyond the speechless stage. M. Clemen-
ceau, who was a real and not merely a titular President, did not escape
similar troubles. It is sufficient to say that Paris has, or had during the
Conference, no less than 43 daily newspapers, each of which had some man
on its staff who was capable of determining all the questions of peace
rapidly, effectively, wisely, and without party bias. The French press fre-
quently “got into a state,” as one lady might say of another; politics In
France are nothing if not vivid, and Clemenceau had many difficulties of
his own. The representatives of Italy and Japan were similarly bound to
take account of the daily trend of public opinion in their own countries.
It is obviously dangerous to comment upon so august and powerful an
institution as we are in duty bound to believe the British press to be —but
no observer could fail to be impressed by the fact that the British charac-
teristic of self-depreciation, in the form of depreciation of the national repre-
sentatives, was frequently exemplified during the Conference. British news-
papers were to be found leading the chorus of abuse of their own representa-
tives—particularly of Mr. Lloyd George. A not inconsiderable section of
the British press was prepared to credit almost any' assertion made by an
interested foreigner if it could be used to injure the British Prime Minister.
The aims, motives and methods of «he British representatives were daily
disparaged. The war being over, it was apparently thought proper to
resort to their old motto, “Acrimony as usual.” It is not suggested that
Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Balfour and their associates were beyond or above
criticism, or that discussion on great world questions is to be stifled, but it
is impossible not to hold the opinion that the spirit of the criticism emanating
from certain British quarters was a most serious handicap to British interests.
It is commonly assumed that President Wilson sacrificed his principle of
“open covenants,” that he was overborne by the bad old traditions of schem-
ing European statesmen. It is only fair to remember, however, that in
one sense the covenants of the Peace Treaty were openly arrived at. The
negotiations with the Germans, which were all in writing, were promptly


made available to the press, and therefore the process of arriving at covenants
between the parties was open in the fullest sense. Few people seriously
maintain that preliminary discussions within the circle of the Allies on the
one hand, or within the German Delegation on the other hand, to determine
the attitude to be adopted in relation to the proposed covenants, should
have been open to the press. It is not irrelevant to remark that the Germans,
equally with the Allies, were bound by President Wilson’s Fourteen Points
and speeches, and that any degree of publicity which might justly have been
demanded for the process whereby the Allied representatives made up their
minds on the problems of Peace, might, with equal justification, have been
required from the Germans. It is indeed by no means an insignificant
advance towards open diplomacy that the whole world knows the process
of bargaining with the enemy. The Peace Treaty, in its original form, is
available to all—-so also are the German Notes, the Allied replies, and the final
decisions. It is therefore a mistake to suppose that the principle of open
The thirst of public men for publicity is a characteristic which does not
disappear when a man is made into a plenipotentiary. But, on the whole, the
members of the various Delegations faithfully observed the obligation not
to use onfidential matter for the purposes of personal or political propaganda.
On some occasions it was clear that confidential information had been given
away in order to serve a particular purpose, but these occasions were rare,
and experience showed that a breach of trust of this character only discredited
the individual who had been guilty of it.
The system adopted in the staff of the British Empire Delegation for
preserving the secrecy of documents and excluding eavesdroppers was very
complete. The residential and official hotels which the Delegation occupied
were guarded by security officers from Scotland Yard, who challenged all
persons not in possession of an official pass. These passes bore the photo-
graph, signature, and official description of the holder. The British telephone
system was self-contained. Special arrangements were made to carry letters
twice a day to London without the use of the local post office. Urgent letters
could be sent by the British Air Service. The distribution of documents was
most carefully controlled. A receipt slip was attached to the external envelope
which covered the documents in a sealed inner envelope. This slip had
to be signed by the addressee before the marine whose duty it was to deliver
documents would hand them over. When the Cabinet met, the doors and
approaches were carefully guarded, and on some occasions, when the meeting
was held in a room on the ground floor of the Hotel Majestic, special pre-
cautions were adopted in the neighbouring street.
Mr. Lloyd George occupied a house in the Rue Nitot. President Wilson
lived in a house in the Rue des Etats-Unis, within a few yards of the Rue
Nitot. At Mr, Lloyd-George’s house there were a couple of unobtrusive men
from Scotland Yard. President Wilson’s establishment was guarded by gen-
darmes and American soldiers. The whole of one side of the Place was
forbidden to the public—persons were not allowed to walk past the house
on the footpath, or to drive along the road, unless they had the necessary
authority. This degree of state is explained by the fact that President Wilson
was the only actual head of a State attending the Conference. Other pleni-
potentiaries were Ministers of State of their respective countries, and thus
9a


were not entitled to, and did not receive, as in the case of President Wilson,
the honours due to a monarch. The distinction between the President• and tl e
other plenipotentiaries is emphasised by the phraseology used m the 1 rcaty
of Peace In the case of the British Empire, the party to the Treaty is H.s
Maiestv the King “by the Right Honourable David Lloyd-George, M.P.,
fnd others In the ca'se of France, the party to the Treaty is the Presiden
nf the French Republic “by” certain named Ministers. But in the case of
the United States of America the party is “The President of the
of America, by the Honourable Woodrow Wilson, President of^
States acting in his own name and by his own proper authority.
It may be remarked that the American Delegation was as careful as any
other to keep its own secrets. The Hotel Crellon, the American Delegation
headquarters, was as carefully guarded as the Hotel Majestic, the Hote
Astoria or the Hotel La Perouse, which belonged to the British Delegation.
It is safe to say that actual experience of practical diplomacy shows
that open diplomacy in the full sense is impossible. It may be t lf ®
Golden Age ever returns the leaders of nations will be able to lay all their
cards on the table-if, indeed, cards will exist in the de " untd
international conditions have become stable it is useless to think of any such
prwedure-resuit q{ Confer ence, apart from the actual makmg
of Peace with Germany, is the establishment of the League:of
the League of Nations is, as it ought to be, strongly supported by the demo-
cracies of the world, a practical step in the direction of open diplomacy will
have been taken. The League is to act not only as the headquarters of many
international bodies, but also as a clearing house for the nations on inter-
national affairs. If the officers of the League succeed in translating the idea s
of its founders into fact, they will provide well-digested and easily accessible
information upon which the peoples of the world will be able toj form intelli-
gent judgments upon the many issues of international politics. If the League
confines its operations to emergency action for the purpose of preventing
threatened war it will fail in one of its principal functions.
The League, to achieve the end and aim of its being, must always be
in action in order to provide reliable material upon which those responsible
for foreign affairs may draw. This department of the functions of the League
has been most fully developed in relation to the Labour Covenant wffiich
makes provision for the collection and publication of information on Labour
questions throughout the world. , . , . .
Many international disputes- -and any international difference of opinion
is a potential cause of war—are due to faulty information or to a miscon-
ception of the nature and aims of the policy of foreign states. It will be one
of the duties of the League of Nations to minimise such opportunities ot mis-
understanding. Many of those who were present at the Peace Conference in
the British and American Delegations realised this fact very clearly, and steps
are being taken to organise the study of foreign affairs in the British Umpire
and the United States for the purpose of assisting the League of Nations in
this work. . , ...
After every allowance is made for the necessity of secrecy in certain
cases, it remains true that a modern democracy cannot be expected to sup


port its leaders unless it understands the policy to which they are committing
the country. This is emphatically the case in Australia. It is necesary for
Australians to understand not only their own foreign policy but also the
foreign policies of other nations, and it is the duty of our leaders to take
steps not only to organise efficient machinery for dealing with international
questions, but also to provide the people (so far as is consistent with the public
safety) with the information which is necessary to enable them to form an
intelligent opinion.
The revolt which is apparent throughout Australia against unnecessary
governmental secrecy is an encouraging sign, and it is to be hoped that, with
due limitations and precautions, full recognition will be given to the right
of the people to know and understand the principles upon which their affairs
are being conducted.
One of the greatest needs of the day in Australia is an appreciation of
the extent to which the Australian is unavoidably concerned with foreign
problems, and a realisation of the necessity for the intelligent support of an
informed democracy in order to make a policy wise and effective.
Their Peace.
Now peace has come, but they that fell
Know only that they sought it well.
They cannot know that peace has come !
How did it come? Like dawn, like night?
Like one bird singing for the light?
Surely they knew that peace would come !
How did it come? On silent feet,
Across the grass that dew made sweet?
They could not hear the stillness come.
O, still joy after changing years !
Fathers and sons bring home their spears
(But they know not that peace has come).
“Peace !” we have said, yet held our breath.
“A moment free from lowering death !”
They know not such faint peace has come.
Joy in our hearts, yet bitter dread,
Lest vainly, vainlv life was shed.
For they must know that peace has come.
Let us make haste and let us build
Great worlds with strength and wonder filled,
Then shall they know tneir peace has come.

The Australians’ Part In the Thecking of the Great
German Offensive of 1918.
BY CAPT. J. D. ROGERS.
THE accompanying sketch is of great historic interest, as it shows the
most extreme westerly point reached by the Germans on the Amiens
sector in their last supreme effort to break the Allies’ line on the
Western Front, and the part played by the Australian Corps, in checking that
effort.
iXhe whole of the available forces of the enemy were thrown in at what
was considered the critical point in the whole line —the junction of the British
and the French —and in a few weeks the whole of the Somme country, which
had been taken by us at such bitter cost during the Summer of 1916 and that
most cruel of all winters that followed, was lost. Many miles ol country in
addition were captured by the Germans with very little loss. Villers-
Bretonneux was taken, and from its commanding position the enemy over-
looked the whole of the Somme Valley to the West, including Amiens and
that important north and south line of communication, the Amiens-Paris rail-
way.
Never since the early days of the war had the enemy been so near
success —a success to which he was much nearer than he knew, for our line
was practically broken.
The whole five divisions of the Australian Corps had spent a strenuous
winter on the Messines-W'ytschaete front, and as soon as it could be done
they were relieved from the line, and despatched by strategic train to the
Somme. The 3rd and 4th Divisions were the first to arrive, and so critical
was the situation, and so doubtful the exact whereabouts of the enemy that
covering parties were necessary to cover their detrainment. Orders were then
received for them to advance eastward until they gained touch with the
enemy,. Isolated parties of the enemy were driven backhand a line made
corresponding very nearly to the most westerly red dotted line on the sketch.
The 2nd and sth Divisions were close behind, and were soon in the fight-
ing. In those first few days the 3rd Division drove the enemy back about a
mile near Vaire, and the sth Division advanced a similar distance near Meri-
court. In spite of heavy counter attacks by the enemy the line was held. For
the first time since its beginning the German rush had been appreciably
checked, and we were able to get a rough idea of what enemy forces were
opposing us and where their strength lay.
This check also enabled the British and French to collect their tired
divisions, and so arrange their forces as to checkmate further attacks which
might be expected from the enemy. But before he was able to move, that
attack, which was probably one of the most decisive of the whole war, was
launched by US —the Villers-Bretonneux attack.
Carried out by the 15th Brigade of the sth Division, in conjunction with
the 13th Brigade of the 4th Division, and taking place by night in practically
un-reconnoitred country, this attack was probably unequalled in brilliance in
the whole war.






By morning, on the 25th April, Villers-Bretonneux and the surrounding
high country was ours. In spite of many very severe and reckless counter
attacks, the ground was held.
Perhaps no battle ever had such a moral effect on the whole of the British
Army. Whereas all thoughts had been for some time on merely stemming
the onrush of the enemy, Headquarters began gradually to see that the dark
time was perhaps over, and we could again think of attacking.
Ihe Ist Australian Division, it will be remembered, was the last to be
relieved from the Northern Sector, and no sooner had it arrived at Amiens
than the Germans broke through just south of the sector it had left, and
within a few days were within striking distance of Hazebrouck and the
Northern Lines of Communication. Ihe Ist Division was at once sent back,
and arrived just in time to help to a very great extent to check the enemy’s
advance. Its work there in the vicinity of Meteren, Merris and Strazeele is
a story to itself, and was equal in initiative and daring to that of the other
four divisions on the Somme Front.
Down South, in the meanwhile, all four divisions were continually
harassing the enemy, with raids and advances by day and by night, as often
as not without any artillery co-operation, effecting what were known as
silent penetrations.” Ihe effect these had on the enemy is shown rather
well in an extract seen in a captured German Intelligence report, which ran
something as follows :
“Opposite us are the Australians, rough, strong men from the bush,
skilled in woodcraft—men who take cover in the long grass, and who steal on
our advanced posts in the night. Woe betide any of our groups who are not
continually on the alert.”
On the 4th July the now historic battle of Hamel was fought, the battle
in which Americans first fought side by side with Australians—and this on
their “Day of Independence.” This battle, a set-piece attack, with all
arms co-operating—Artillery, Tanks, Flying Corps, etc.—was one of the
most successful of the comparatively small battles of the war. It was carried
out under the orders of our 4th Division, and was the first British attack
in which both Tanks and a “creeping barrage” were used to “see the Infantry
through.” It was the Tanks’ great day, and after the battle neither the
“Tank” men nor our “diggers” could say enough about the other. All the
objectives were taken, and our losses were even less than the number of
prisoners captured.
By now, all along the line, both British and French were again thinking
of attacking, and preparations were soon on the way for those vast attacks
which were launched from August onwards, and which finally broke the
German line.
A rather high compliment was paid to the Australian Corps during most
of this time, as on both the Northern and the Southern fronts a division of
ours fought alongside the French as the “division de liason.”


With the Infantry
BY W. H. DOWNING.
AS the dying light filters wearily through the grey tapestries in the west, a
string of men, swearing, stumbling, encumbered with a score of articles
of wood, of canvas and iron, filed along the duckboards. Across a
waste of slush-filled shell-holes that wooden causeway zig-zags among bat-
teries of artillery, over waterlogged trenches in every hundred yards, leading
from life to death, from the rural peace of the Flemish countryside to the
horror, the agony, the frigid desolation of the Line.
Shells crash, and everywhere fragments of iron burr through the faint
breezes of evening. Far away, jets of mud splash into the air, clouds of black
or white smoke slowly drift, and a rapid succession of booms comes through
the interstices of continual sound; near at hand are frightful crashes, red-
hot laminae of flying metal, searing flames. In the winking of an eye a
man is transformed from the glory of his youth into a red and screaming
horror, or an obscene mass steaming on the duckboards, or is flung inert
into the water. A new Golgotha is in every shell-hole by the way; mangled
bodies, half sunk in mud, arc on either hand. Field guns and howitzers,
nine-point-two’s and eighteen-pounders thunder from the rear, or on the
nearer hillsides slam salvos of shells at a distant enemy, stabbing the twilight
with javelins of flame, shattering on the tympanum with sharp metallic
detonations. Day dies in a blackness more than physical—a night of despon-
dency and of weariness. In front is the saffron flicker of the German guns,
outlining the hills in each recurring instant. Behind is the nearer lightning
of our own as the Infantry goes “In.”
Whether straining their eyes throughout the interminable night, watching
for enemies moving across the tragic waves of sodden and tumbled earth in
No Man’s Land; or in the weary and terrible hour of “Stand-to” at dusk
and before dawn, when the mind rides a waking nightmare, bound as Mazeppa
rode; or in the portentous moment of Zero Time, when the wide lands behind
burst into gigantic flames, and the senses are stunned, and the earth rocks
with the frightful hammering of thousands of guns, and the waves of men
swarm over the parapet and follow a barrage that flogs the tortured soil,
covering all with palls of battle-smoke —a moving wall of fire, through which
enemy bullets sing and swish in clusters in the air; or in the chancy, silent,
cold-blooded work of patrolling the front by night—there was no release
from the continued horror, the strain—no release but death or wounds. And
ever the tale of casualties increased like sand in an hour-glass, heaping higher
and higher with every second, every grain a life. > >
Hunger and vermin, bitterly cold nights, disease, hard and unremitting
manual labour under continuous fire, thirst at noonday, weary vigils, made
up the life in the Line. There, the roar and crash of shells, the chatter of
machine-guns, the frightful boom of minenwerfers filled the wastes with
sound; and there was no sound that did not mean death.


1 he hea\ iest burden was not the big battles, but the continual going to
and from the Line, for the first, or (as some did) for the fortieth time, always
with a greater weariness, a greater strain on the nerves, a greater mathe-
matical probability of doom.
And when at length they came “out” for a few days to recruit their
Strength for further efforts, battalions had been reduced from six hundred to
five hundred—or one hundred, or less. This is a strength state of a typical
infantry company at Ypres in 1917; —
2 5~ 2 &191 1 7- — x 34 —39 killed, 74 wounded = 21.
4"// IC Vi7* 69 (including 48 reinforcements and casuals taken on strength
since 29/9/17)—n killed, 28 wounded = 30.
12ml Sl io/i7- —S2 (including 22 casuals)—B killed, 15 wounded = 29.
And so it went on, year in and year out. sometimes at a less, sometimes
at a greater rate. And the men came out of this hell, worn, haggard, filthy
and bearded, hysterical, famished, staggering with fatigue. And ever and
ever the iron wheel of days turned in its intolerable round.
It is no disparagement of any other arm to say that the infantry bore
the burden of the war in France. Whilst others, in the technical' units,
opposed machines 1o machines, thq work of the infantrymen was to fight
the unequal battle of flesh against steel. They bore an enormously heavier
proportion of casualties than any other arm; endured by far the greatest
hardships, the most intolerable privations; received the smallest ratio of
benefits—the least leave, the scantiest rations; they were exposed to all the
dangers of all the iest (with two minor exceptions) and to many others
peculiar to themselves.
The Landing in Gallipoli, although not so bloody or so successful as many
engagements in France, fires the imagination more than any other. Its oualitv
was intensely dramatic. An Australian force (“probably passable guerillas”)
was for the first time engaged in an independent operation. A nebula was
concentrated into a new star.
There followed the sacrifice of the 2nd Brigade at Cape Helles, the bloody
defeat of the Turkish attack on May 19th, and again on June 29th; the fight-
ing around German Officers’ Trench and Quinn’s Post.
.°n the 6th of August began the battle of Lone Pine—one of the most
horrible battles of all time. One cannot in this place describe in full the des-
perate rushes over deadly yards of bullet-swept hillsides, by men weak with
dysentery and thirst; the burning of the wounded on Chocolate hill, when the
scrub caught fire; or the deadly fights in the darkness of the covered Turkish
trenches, against odds of three to one. On August the Bth took place the
“sacrifice stunt” of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. The fighting continued
both here and at Suvla, until the end of the month. The sth Brigade landed
just in time to take part in the last important fight on the Peninsula. It was
followed in September by the remainder of the 2nd Division.
In December the A.I.F. returned to Egypt. The original Ist, 2nd, 3rd
and 4th Brigades were each split in two, and formed the 14th, 15th, 13th and
12th Brigades respectively, and new Brigades of the same denominating
numbers. Ihe 4th, 12th and 13th were formed into the new 4th Division; the
1 4th, 15th and newly arrived Bth Brigade constituted the sth Division. The
10


2nd Division, the youngest then on active service, remained intact. Mean-
while the 3rd Division was forming in Australia.
These four divisions were sent to hold the Suez Canal zone against a
threatened Turkish offensive, and there underwent considerable privations.
In March the Ist Division was sent to France. By June all but the Light
Horse had left Egypt for ever. The Ist, 2nd and 4th Divisions at different
times, held quiet sections between Pleurbaix and Ypres. In July the
Division went in the line at Fleurbaix. Ihe other three marched south.
On July the 19th occurred the most hideous catastrophe have
ever known, when" 12,000 of the infantry of the sth Division were sent “over
the bags” and 10,000 were in the one summer evening wounded or killed.
A fortnight later the other three divisions went into the charnel-house of
Pozieres. Here an equally heavy smash was averted only by the brilliant and
timely use of the reserves. The terrible fighting of Mouquet Farm followed
immediately after. In these three battles the infantry in France suffered
32,000 casualties out of 50,000 men.
In September, after sixty days’ continuously in the Line, the remnants
of the sth Division were sent to the Somme. 1 hen began the awful Somme
winter” of 1916, the worst winter campaign in history, with the possible
exception of the Russian campaign of Napoleon. For days at a time the
men were waist-deep In frigid mud —mud in which the legs were held as in a
vice. It took 30 hours to struggle five miles from the Line at Flers to the
camps at Montauban, going all the time. The shelling was unusually heavy.
It was under these conditions that the very bloody attack on the Butte de
Warlencourt took place.
The mud phase continued Into January, 1917. Trench feet (which often
made necessary the amputation of both legs) caused greater ravages even
than the dysentery of the Peninsula. Each division in turn went through the
privations of that awful period.
When it froze the conditions slightly improved. It was nevertheless the
severest winter in France for forty years. The thermometer dropped to 29
degrees of frost, and frost-bite took the place of trench-feet. Men went into
the Line without blankets, and sometimes without greatcoats. There were
ghastly little fights—Stormy Trench, Bayonet Trench, Gendecourt. Under
our ceaseless pressure the enemy was pushed almost to the walls of Bapaume.
Then on St. Patrick’s Day the 2nd and sth Divisions hurled the Germans
from that stronghold, and harried them to the Hindenburg Line.
There was a period of open fighting—the storming of villages here and
there, the capture of Morchies, the first abortive attack by a weak detach-
ment on Lagnicourt, the epic fighting at Beaumetz, where a force of xooo
picked Prussian Guardsmen was annihilated by 300 weary Australians. Then
came the advance from Lagnicourt, followed by the attack upon the Ist
Division at that place, when the Germans, having been repulsed after pene-
trating our lines, were caught between our trench and their own barbed wire,
and the Australians sprayed them with bullets as they ran screaming up and
down the front, until the heaps of German bodies had ceased to writhe and
2000 of the enemy lay dead.
And now commenced the hideous carnage of Bullecourt. First, six
battalions of the 4th Division, accompanied by twelve tanks, but unsupported


by artillery, attacked in broad daylight the virgin Hindenburg Line. Under
a hellish enemy barrage, which destroyed the tanks, on which their chances
depended, and under a heavy concentration of machine-gun fire, infantry
climbed and threaded through the deep thickets of barbed wire, cut a passage
through the German lines, and penetrated to a depth of 2000 yards. The
devoted battalions were then surrounded by masses of the enemy, and with
the exception of a few hundreds captured after all their ammunition had
been expended, were massacred.
The Huns hit back. The 2nd Division withstood eighteen heavy attacks
in a day. The 6th Brigade was surrounded, and the men fought back to
back until the enemy was forced to withdraw. The men of the 54th Battalion,
having been reduced in nine successive onslaughts to 300 men, including
wounded, and after firing every round of ammunition, rose and charged and
routed ten times their number. There was a violent and continuous barrage,
night and day. The slaughter continued for five weeks.
The 4th Division went north, and in company with the New Zealanders
and the 3rd Division, which had arrived from England at the end of 19x6,
and had up till this time occupied quiet sectors, captured the Messines Ridge.
In September the Australians went to Ypres, and became involved in a
series of terrific battles for the ridges —Glencorse Wood (September 20th),
Polygon Wood (September 26th), Broodseinde Ridge (October 4th), and Pass-
chendaele (October 10th).
Throughout the remainder of the winter there was continuous fighting
at Messines, in the form of nightly raids on a large scale. In March, the sth
British Army broke, and the Australian Divisions were sent by forced marches
to the Somme. Hardly had they left the North when the enemy burst the
line behind them. The Ist Division was turned back, and encountered the
enemy in the forests of Nieppe. Around Merris and Meteren these few Aus-
tralians did what the “Old Contemptibles” had done at Ypres in October,
1914. There was Homeric fighting against very heavy odds for four months, in
which our men astonished both the Allies and the enemy by their daring, their
wonderful initiative, and their invariable success.
In those dark hours not a single Australian yielded an inch. While every
one else was either retreating or with difficulty holding fast, the Australians,
in the middle of the storm, actually advanced.
On the Somme the other divisions had stopped the Huns and saved the
day. A line was formed on March 27th. On April 4th a violent attack was
launched on the sth Division at Villers-Bretonneux. It failed. On April sth
the 12th and 13th Brigades were attacked at Demancourt by innumerable
waves; were at length surrounded, and fought back to back until their
assailants were exterminated. Then new waves rolled over the hillsides, and
the enemy brought field guns to the hedges five hundred yards from our men,
and smothered their line with shells. The few men that remained repulsed
these further attacks, counter-attacked, and drove the enemy for half a mile.
There was hard fighting all along the line for four weeks. On April
24th an English garrison was exterminated on the vital hill of Villers-Breton-
neux under a heavy attack. If the Germans had been permitted to make a
further advance the war would have been lost. At one o’clock in the morning
of 25th April 3000 men of the 15th and 13th Brigades attacked without artil-
10*


lery support 30,000 Germans in strong positions, fortified by entanglements.
In the wild bayonet charge 6000 Germans were killed and 1000 captured. The
town was retaken, and Amiens saved. This feat is without parallel since
Gideon.
We conducted forays and minor attacks at Morlancourt and Ville-sur-
Ancre. On July 4th brigades from all four divisions captured the heights
at Hamel. On August the Bth a huge eight-mile drive from Villers-Breton-
neux was accomplished by the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and sth Divisions—the deepest
one-day advance by the Allies since 1914. On August the 9th the Ist Division
swept forward to Lihons. On August the 23rd there was another general
advance, which drove the Germans over the Somme at Peronne.
The Australians were given a month to cross the river. They did it in
three days. In that very operation Peronne and Doingt were rushed by the
sth Division, and the glorious but almost incredible feat of storming Mont St.
Quentin was accomplished by the 2nd Division. The 3rd advanced on the
left.
Then the enemy was relentlessly pushed towards the Hindenburg line.
The capture of Hargicourt by the Ist and 4th Divisions brought us into view
of that mighty system. On September 29th, in the costly attack at Belli-
court, the 3rd and sth Divisions, in company with the Americans, burst
through the main bulwark of Central Empires. The vast moral effect of this
victory was immediately seen in the capitulation of Austria. The 2nd Division
swept through to the taking of the Beaurevoir system, of Beauregard and
Montbrehain.
In two months the Australian infantry had advanced nearly sixty miles,
where every mile w r as marked by a violent struggle. It had captured tens
of thousands of Germans, many hundreds of guns of all sizes, had defeated
seventy-two enemy divisions, and had itself been redued to a skeleton of an
army.
In all the A.I.F. there is scarcely a battalion whose total casualties do
not represent a complete annihilation, five times over.
With the Artillery.
BY D. R. P. AND C. W. W.
THE combined British and French armies had struck at last. The German
trenches had crumpled to powder under the bombardment; whole
sections of trench had disappeared amid the devastating fury of land
mines, and the British battalions had slowly pressed forward to the ridge on
the very crest of which stood the village of Pozieres.
Along the wide cobbled roads, between avenues of apple trees and fields
of ripening corn dotted with blood-red poppies and blue cornflowers, the
Australian army advanced to its first great battle in France. The leaning


statue of the Virgin on the tower of the shattered Cathedral of Albert over-
hung an unceasing stream of men and guns and transport, all grey-white with
the chalky dust ol Santerre. Huge howitzers, boomed from among the ruined
houses ol the city. German shells shrieked, seeking to silence them, and
hurled up volcanoes of bricks and paving stones. Long-barrelled naval guns
unceasingly searched for the enemy batteries or shelled roads miles to the
rear of his lines. Here was the greatest concentration of artillery the war
had yet seen, and an artillery duel was in full progress. Still further on
were hundreds of field guns—l B-pounders and 4.5 howitzers—dug into the
hillsides and busily engaged in levelling the German trenches and machine
gun positions in the village of Pozieres, which had several times beaten back
the English battalions. Now Australian troops had orders to carry it at all
costs, and their own artillerymen took over the field guns from the English.
At dawn on 21st July they stood by their guns, waiting for zero. The fateful
hour struck at last, and every gun, from 15-inch howitzers miles to the rear,
to trench mortars in the front line, barraged the German positions. By mid-
day the infantry had carried the crest of the hill, and the place where Pozieres
bad been, and the field guns had to move forward. New gun pits were
quickly dug in the soft white stone, and everything camouflaged with nets
and grass lest a boche plane should direct a hail of shells. 1 hough the ridge
was won the enemy line was not broken, and successive actions were fought,
and a few more acres of ground gained till the Autumn rains set in. Then
the chalky soil, churned up by thousands of shells, changed into a gluey mud.
Plank roads were hastily laid down, and ammunition taken to the guns by
pack horses and tramlines. Men could scarcely drag themselves through the
slime, and a drizzling rain alternated with intense frosts. When in February,
1917, the enemy began to retire, the artillery could scarcely move to follow
him. Ihe ground was so soft and honeycombed with shell holes, and the
horses so weak, that the gunners frequently had to manhandle their guns
and pull them with dragropes a few feet at a time. But they kept up some-
how, and an Australian battery, the 4th, was the first to pass through the
long-coveted city of Bapaume and engage the enemy on the Hinderburg line.
On this new front there were few positions favourable for artillery; the
enemy was superior in the air, and he knew every inch of the country. Every
tree and hedge had been cut down, and from his position on a ridge the
enemy could detect and shell our batteries and transport. Steadily the guns
came into action to break this line at Bullecourt. The Germans endeavoured
to break through and destroy them. Many pieces were temporarily cap-
tured, but the gunners carried away sights or breechblocks, thus putting them
out of action. Joining the infantry, they soon swept the enemy back in a
counter-attack. Other guns were pulled out of their pits and worked with
terrible effect at point-blank range, and the enemy left many dead. While
the Bullecourt battle was still raging the 3rd Division participated in an
advance in Flanders which won the Messines ridge.
During June and July guns large and small rumbled along the great
roads towards Belgium. There, perhaps, the hugest artillery concentration
of the whole war was massing, and in July the Australian divisions moved
North to play their part. This was to be no surprise attack; sheer weight of
material was to win the day, and guns in thousands were placed, battery


behind battery, till it seemed impossible that any living thing could survive
their overwhelming might. All through that sunny month they pounded the
semicircle of ridges that surround the ancient Flemish city of \pres, obhte -
ating trenches and pillboxes, villages and woods. The enemy guns well
directed from these ridges, swept the roads and tramlines leading to our
positions. Batteries were discovered and blotted out of existence with a rag-
ing storm of high explosives. Other guns scattered shells over the whole
area “sweeping and searching” for hidden batteries or ammunition dumps.
Gas of every kind was poured over the low-lying country, and half-bin ,
voiceless men were only too common among the gun crews. More and more
batteries came into action, and the tumult of this titanic struggle became
indescribable. When at daybreak on the 31st July every gun spoke simul-
taneously the noise was so tremendous that the gunners could not dis m-
guish the roar of their own pieces. The eastern sky was a belt of hre from
the flames of myriads of high explosive and shrapnel shells. The German
5.0.5., red, green, and white rockets, clusters and strings of brilliant s >
flaming balls of fire, soared in panic into this inferno. But the attack had
been delayed too long; the fine weather had broken, and the Lng;is
battalions, hampered by the mud, did not win the crest of the ridges.ihe
guns moved forward, and fresh battles continually developed. Ihe autumn
rains converted the shell-shattered earth into a treacherous morass; but, as
before on the Somme, plank roads were pushed forward and shell carried
to the guns by pack horses. Continually more and more ground was won,
and at length, after months of constant struggle, British eyes gazed from t e
heights of Passchendaele far over the low-lying plains of Flanders.
The attack had been expected on the Messines front. Ihe uncxpecte
happened—the Germans smashed through the Fifth Army and recovered all,
and more than all, that the British had gained on the Somme in the previous
twenty-one months. The artillery followed the infantry southwards—the
Fourth Division first, then the Third, Fifth, Second and First Divisions. Last
of all came the mobile brigades, who heard, as they entrained at Strazeele,
the rumble of the barrage announcing the fateful German offensive for t e
ChaneleJorJ majority of the Australian guns could come into action, the
valour of the infantry had saved Amiens, the most important sector on the
British front. Then came the months of preparation for the counter-offensive.
There was much artillery fire during this period. The successful attac cs a
Ville-sur-Ancre, Morlancourt, and Hamel, were supported by barrages from
the Australian field guns. ..
New batteries came into action ; the gunners dug advanced pits or trail-
beds ; and the heavy guns took up their positions—a sure sign that there was
“something doing.” Villers-Bretonneux at night was blocked with a mass
of men, horses, guns and wagons. . •
At last everything was prepared; the guns were laid on the aiming
posts, the fuses set, the shells—smoke, shrapnel, and high explosives—
arranged in their proper order. “Thirty seconds to go! called out an officer.
The layers put their hands on the firing-levers. 1 wenty ! Ten . Five .
The silence was tense. Far back at Glisy a heavy French cannon boomed;
the officers blew their whistles, and thousands of guns opened on the German
trenches. It was August the eighth. The great offensive had begun.


After a few minutes of whirlwind bombardment, the batteries settled down
to their regular rate of fire. The barrage, a wall of bursting steel, crept
forward, the range being lengthened at the blast of the whistles. The infantry
followed, invisible in the mist of the morning and the artificial fog of the
smoke-shells. lanks attacked with them. Ihe British planes maintained
their mastery of the air. In two hours the field guns were out of range and
moved forward to new positions; the batteries suffered heavy losses in this
and subsequent actions. The German artillery lost 104 guns and many
prisoners to the Australians.
The weather remained fine. The First Division, which after a few hours
at Amiens had been sent north, returned from the defence of Hazebrouck.
Ihe advance continued. Ihe fighting became more open, and often batteries
were attached to particular battalions. The Germans attempted to stand
their ground at Peronne. After the capture of Mont St. Quentin, where the
Second Division made its supreme effort, the advance continued to the Hin-
denburg line, on whose impregnability the Germans based all their plans.
This vast system of fortifications was the centre of German hopes. If the
Allies broke through, Germany was lost, and both sides knew it.
Ihe artillery fire increased in intensity. Our guns searched the German
roads and swept the German trenches. There was much gas-shelling. Our
planes bombed and machine-gunned the enemy lines night and day, while
hostile planes droned overhead in the dark, bombing roads, bridges, and the
guns which they located by their flashes. Two American divisions came to
“hop over” with our experienced, but exhausted infantry. On the 29th
September the attack commenced at Bellecourt. Fog and smoke-shells aided
the storming troops, the barrage was intense but not prolonged. The tanks
cut tracks through the formidable belts of barbed wire, and the infantry swept
on. The batteries, the “heavies,” as well as the field-guns, had pulled up
close to the front line in expectation of a greater advance than actually took
place. When the fog lifted, they paid the price.
The last lines of the Hindenburg system fell with the capture of Beaure-
gard, Beaurevoir, and Marlbrehain. The attacks on these places were the
the last fights of the finest infantry in the world.
As the two American divisions had no artillery, our batteries were
attached to them, but were gradually withdrawn. The last shots of the Aus-
tralian Field Artillery were fired by the Fourth Division. The Heavy Artillery
remained in action in Belgium till the signing of the Armistice.
The casualties of the artillery were heavier during 1918 than any other
period of the war except those months at Ypres in 1917, which will always
remain the artilleryman’s nightmare.
The infantryman was a competent and critical judge of artillery, and
expressed his opinion in no ambiguous terms. His verdict was always for
Australian artillery, whose most efficient brigades were, of course, those of
his own division.


With the Flying Corps.
THE Flying Corps, unlike most other units, is divided into two almost
distinct sections —the “combatant” ranks (pilots and observers), who,
in the case of the Australian Flying Corps, were practically all officers,
and the “non-combatants,” who, with the exception of a few technical officers,
were “other ranks.” To the first group fell the dangers and the glory of the
actual aerial warfare in all its many branches. Fighting enemy aircraft, trench
“strafing” with machine guns, “shooting up” enemy reserves, bombing,
photography, artillery observation, reconnaissance, the carrying of ammuni-
tion and even food to front line or isolated posts —were some of the various
jobs allotted to the airmen. To the technical side belonged the more prosaic
and comparatively safe, though extremely important task of keeping the
machines in perfect flying and fighting condition. An idea of the magnitude
of this work may be gained from a perusal of the trade classification of the
mechanics of a single squadron, which practically corresponds in its functions
to a battalion in the infantry. The list comprises fitters, riggers, turners,
acetylene welders, carpenters, vulcanizers, sailmakers, electrical and wireless
mechanics, photographers, armourers, drivers, and cyclists of the motor
transport and various clerks.
The service pilot or observer was, for many reasons, much envied by his
fellow officers of line regiments. He had, in his work, a spice of individual,
almost free-lance, adventure that went much to redeem aerial fighting from
the mechanical slaughter of infantry action. There was an undoubted fasci-
nation and novelty in. the new, somewhat mysterious art of flying, and,
above all, he enjoyed comparative comfort when not actually on a job.
Not for him the muddy trench—the übiquitous 5.9 —the rat-infested dugout
or the cheerless “bivvy.” A cosy Nissen hut (if the gods were good), decorated
according to the taste of the inhabitants and the latest whim of Kirchner, a
cheerful, comparatively well-furnished mess, generally plenty of good cheer
(in the broadest sense), and the philosophy of Oman combined to alleviate
the “horrors of war” for the aviator.
An airman is, in many respects, almost a sun worshipper. His day begins
at dawn and ends at dusk. If it be wet or very cloudy, only the mo*st
urgent of stunts will send him from the ground. Winter, therefore, despite
the soul-chilling cold of the Flanders “upper air,” is not altogether unwel-
comed by officers or men. In any season, however, the show is always
unpopular, and it needs but iittle discernment to pick the unfortunates whose
turn it is to do the first show on the morrow. One sees a few desolate beings
on the drome before turning in, gazing into the heavens for a wisp of angry
cloud, or searching the horizon for a trace of fog that might betoken a “dud”
morning and the luxury of a sleep in. But no sooner do their heads touch
the pillows (real ones, if there has been a hurried civilian evacuation in the
neighbourhood) than the monotonous formula of the orderly breaks through
each one’s dreams. “Half-past four, sir, early patrol ordered up. Beautiful
morning, sir.” “Beautiful, be ,” is the chorus in reply as each one


drowsily rolls out of his stretcher and proceeds to array himself in a moun-
tain of woollens and furs. After a cup of tea and a biscuit, the patrol
makes its way to the sheds, where the machines, neatly lined up, are
being “run up” by the mechanics. A few words from the leader, and all
get into their ’buses, going half unconsciously through the routine of fasten-
ing their belts, testing controls, and loading and examining guns and sights.
Ihe engines are “run up” to see that they are smooth and giving their
“revs.,” and they taxi out into position on the aerodrome. There is a roar as
the leader’s engine is opened out —the machine gathers speed —up goes its
tail, and with streamers flying is soon climbing fast through the disappearing
ground mist, followed by the others in their respective positions. In a few
minutes the ’drome is silent and deserted.
In a couple of hours knots of flying officers and machines appear again
round the hangars, all searching the western sky for the little black dots
that are the returning machines. Eagerly they are counted—“ 3,4, s—where’s5 —where’s
the sixth? Anybody see six?” Nobody does, and speculation is rife as to
what has happened. Perhaps someone has had engine trouble. “C wasn’t
climbing very well when she took off,” suggests one. “Lots of Huns about
yesterday, and those black and white Fokkers are some split air merchants,”
says a pessimist. Soon the patrol comes in to land. Each machine, which
carries a flight letter denoting the pilot, as well as the squadron marking, is
mentally ticked off as it is recognised. C is missing. “Wonder what’s
happened to old X ” is everybody’s thought, and as soon as the first
machine is in a crowd surges round. “Oh, X ,he fired a green light over
Biapaume and went down—lost him in the ground mist. Only engine
trouble and well on our side,” says the pilot in reply to the host of questions
fired at him. There is a sigh of relief, but as he goes to the office to make
out his report, he is again bombarded with questions. “Many Huns about?”
“Get any stoush?” the answers depending on his mood and often on his
imagination. The “hot-air” having been duly delivered, breakfast and a sleep
are the next important items, for plenty of sleep seems to be an absolute neces-
sity in keeping fit for war flying. Even with the utmost care of mind and
body the severe, if often unconscious, nerve strain caused many pilots to
break down in considerably under the maximum of six months’ continuous war
service.
On the mechanics’ side much could be written on the multifarious, inter-
esting technical details that were brought into being by service conditions,,
but with them we are not concerned. Like the flying officers, the mechanics
were incomparably better off for creature comforts than their fellows of the
infantry. Also, especially before the Hun began his objectionable habit of
bombing and shelling aerodromes, they were comparatively safe. In spite
of this, however, a number of men applied for transfers to line regiments
rather than work, as they often had to, all day and almost all night for weeks
on end; for at all costs the machines had to be kept serviceable. As soon as a
machine arrived back from patrol it was carefully inspected and cleaned.
Perhaps “Archie” or a wily Hun had got a burst into a plane, and a new
one had to be fitted. The engine may have needed overhaul or replacement.
The guns or gun gear may have required repair or adjustment, besides the
routine cleaning and filling of belts and drums. Whatever needed doing was
n


started on instantly, and not left till the job was finished, even if it took a(
couple of days. The honour of the squadron rested on its keeping the
machines ‘‘in the air”—the life of a pilot depended on the jobs being perfect.
The A.F.C. may be justly proud of its record in the war, both for actual
work over the lines and in the efficiency of its technical and training depart-
ments. The keenness and skill of both officers and men, together with the
good understanding that invariably existed between them, enabled the corps
to keep up to the standard that the ‘‘digger” had won as a fighter in every
other sphere of warfare.
The Signal Service.
BY G. L. MAYMAN.
LIKE all other technical branches of the Army, the Signal Service was
radically transformed, by a deliberate and determined process of evolu-
tion, into a complex application of the most recent scientific researches.
To show how this was forced, in part by the nature of the ground and the
climate, in part by the difficulties of communication in a heavily-shelled zone
peculiar to French warfare, in part by the wit of the enemy and the temporary
shortage of equipment, will involve a little use occasionally of technical terms;
but the story of the conquest of material conditions, and the beating of the
Hun on his own scientific plane, is one of those triumphant tales which are
worthy to be told.
A few flag-waggers, a heliograph, a telephone or two and some wire,
and perhaps a foam-flecked steed galloping with rider through a shell-swept
area, would no doubt form the general conception of the make-up of the
signalling force. It, however, is not much more exact than the description of
a lobster as ‘‘a red fish.” It is proposed to deal with the known elements of
Signals on the Western Front only : the treatment of the same in Palestine
would be obviously qualified by the climatic difference and the less crowded
kind of warfare.
Just what the Telegraph and Telephone Department and the Express
Letter system are to our civil life the Signal Service is to the Army life, but
in a more urgent and intense manner. If a Melbourne telegram does take a
day or two to get to Ballarat it does not matter very much, but if a message
from, say, Battalion H.Q. to Brigade H.Q. takes sf minutes, the Signal office
will probably have to face a demand couched, as only a Brigadier can, poli-
tely*.—‘‘Why the is this 5 minutes late, Sigs?” It is difficult to
explain the vital value of this nervous structure of army communication by a
simple comparison with the modern Telegraph and Telephone in even the
busiest commercial centre. Nothing more exasperating and uncanny can be
felt than to be in the midst of an important battle when all methods of com-
munication employed have suddenly failed.


Haig briefly stated the function of the Signal Service to be “for the proper
co-ordination of supply and for the direction and control of battle,’’ and in
his last Despatch showed how it grew from 2400 trained and equipped for
mobile warfare to a force of 42,000 with the latest devices to meet all con-
ditions.
Organized on the basis of a Divisional Signal Coy. as the fundamental
unit, the general principle was to have one main system of wired communi-
cation running through the division. This partook of the nature of a hier-
archy or genealogical tree of three generations at least.
A divisional H.Q. had to keep forward touch with its three infantry
brigades and two artillery brigades; these brigades with their four battalions
and batteries respectively; and again the batteries stretched forward to
Observation posts, and the battalions to their companies in the front line.
The responsibility rested on the higher formation to maintain the lines to
the lower, but the lower commander was responsible for keeping his superior
posted with every happening. So in the dual endeavour the scheme worked
at times. The net work was elaborated with lateral tentacles and branch
lines to all sorts of units like Siege Artillery, Balloons, Sound Ranging
sections, etc. Thus it often happened when the main direct lines were broken
that a message would find its destination after a roundabout wander through
flanking units. Each little unit had its own telephone exchange switchboard
of 4 or 5 lines, and as the importance expanded the number would rise to
about 60 at a Divisional office.
Now we can start on our Evolution. The transition to trench warfare
and the massing of men and artillery immediately presented the Signal Service
with two difficulties. An enormous expenditure of wire was required for the
consolidating divisions; this itself meant a drain on a limited supply of the
insulated field cable, for all lines forward of brigades were laid on the ground
or in ditches, and could not therefore be of bare metal. The second problem
was the result of the gradually intensifying shelling of the zone which com-
prised most of the land lines, and a frequently dislocated and shattered sys-
tem was a daily annoyance. The first problem was solved in England with
the munitions problem; the second was attacked in various ways. Lines were
laid at the bottom of the communication trenches or pegged on the walls
thereof, but this involved a difficult repair job when the trenches were smashed
in. Standby and secondary communication was maintained by signal lamps,
but these were antiquated, of poor power, and with too wide a lateral disper-
sion of the beam of light; moreover this type of signalling was mainly only
practicable from front line to rear stations—flashing fights in the opposite
direction entailed obvious dangers and penalties. Towards the end of 1916 a
Birmingham firm produced the efficient little “Lucas” lamp of 12 volts power,
which at night time gave an adequate range, and in daylight 4 or 5 miles.
A carefully tested reflector—a modified concave— cured fairly well the lateral
spread of the ray. This lamp was easily manipulated and portable, and
although it was 1918 before all units had a sufficient supply, it satisfied most
tests, and certainly was superior to the Boche lamps. But rain and fog and
artificial smoke barrage were fatal obstacles alike for this instrument and the
heliograph—the latter simply a mirror device for using the sunlight (but, alas !
old “Helios” rarely gazed upon the muddy struggle). The beginning of 1917
UA


saw a development of wireless sets of small compact size with a very limited
range —many of only 2000 yards. But these were mostly experimental and
unstandardized until the end of the year. Meanwhile another instrument for
sending messages without wires, and its complementary receiving side, were
successfully used over distances of 1500 to 2 500 yards. “Power Buzzer” and
“Amplifier,” as they were officially known, have been sometimes designated
a “ground wireless,” but this is not a proper classification. All of the tele-
phones in the forward zone (from brigades to the front line) consisted of a
“buzzer” and the ordinary speaking parts. The former acted as the calling
part instead of a bell, and, if necessary, messages could be “buzzed” through
in the Morse code. The two chief advantages of this telephone over the
ordinary bell type were its portability and its capacity for working over high
resistance lines (thus allowing of a thinner field cable, and cheap steel wire
instead of copper), so that even a badly broken line on wet ground would
carry a buzzed message when no ring or voice would get through. But it had
one serious disadvantage common to vibratory or pulsating and alternating
currents. Neighbouring parallel lines (and often 20 lines would be running
along the same ditch or roadside) had a happy habit of picking up (by induc-
tion) all sorts of stray conversations instead of their own, and a good strong
buzzer would stir up all lines within some hundreds of yards, dhis was partly
remedied when all lines were doubled just as the Melbourne telephone
exchange service was improved by the same means. So that noTonger were
lovers’ idylls shattered by somebody bursting in with an order for pork or an
enquiry for the undertaker. But “it is an ill wind,” etc., and it was this
very property of “induction” which made the Power Buzzer a successful de-
vice for signalling from the front line to some rear Headquarters when other
means had failed. Each end would run out a “base line” of about 100 yards
long, pegged to the ground, and arranged as far as possible to be parallel,
although maybe a mile apart. This high power vibrator and its receptive
apparatus had another double-edged value. It could be intercepted by the
German listening sets, and we in turn with instruments that were gradually
perfected could pick up enemy messages. To avoid dangers both sides
adopted very elaborate codes and ciphers; units, also were known by code
names, which were periodically changed, to the confusion of friend and foe
alike. Commanders and specialists and staff officers enjoyed the results of
somebody’s brain wave with titles like—“ Pilot,” “Skipper,” “Bosun,”
the Intelligence Officer was “Sherlock,” the Signal Officer was “Marconi”—
the chaplain might have been called “Sky Pilot.”
One of the most successful signal inventions of the war was that of Capt.
Fuller, of the Royal Engineers, called the Fullerphone. Shortly, it was the
ordinary buzzer with an added device which converted the vibratory current
into a “direct” (non-vibratory) current, so that the signals on the line were
rendered practically non-intercept able. Brought out at the end of 1916 with
improvised materials, it developed into a particularly neat and efficient instru-
ment before the enemy had grasped its principles. A captured German
General-staff document on the Signal Service, dated July, 1917, hinted at
the proposed adoption of an instrument designed to prevent interception.
Captured British instruments had no doubt provided the stimulus. In
the early Fullerphones there were certain defects which were made good on


the information of a German prisoner, who explained how they used to set
out their listening set lines for picking up F'ullerphone signals.
But for quickness and satisfaction, provided secrecy could be guaran-
teed, nothing is better than the telephone conversation, and efforts were made
to provide this service always. The gradual intensification of artillery fire
and its increasing range brought about the evolution of the “Buried cable
system.” It was at a time when most things were being driven underground
for protection. Trench warfare demanded a consolidation of the communi-
cation system and an alertness of this nerve structure. From Divisional
H.Q. one or two main routes to Brigades were laid underground, varying
jn depth from 3 to 6 feet, according to the ground and the feeling of the
diggers. In advance of Brigade H.Q. the system was cxpandefl con-
siderably, both forward and laterally, into what was called a “grid” forma-
tion —i.e., a network, linked up with flank units of neighbouring divisions.
The number of lines buried in the main trunk route would vary from 50 to too
pairs, all carefully insulated from each other. Such a scheme was mani-
festly costly in material and labour, but it was absolutely justified in its effi-
ciency and in its prevention of that prodigality of signallers’ lives, which
prevailed with line-repairing work on the surface lines. In the heavily-shelled
area a maximum depth of 7 feet was aimed at, but even this was often pene-
trated in the softened and much-churned earth of, say, Ypres or Messines, by
an 8-inch shell; on the Somme the chalky ground rendered a lesser depth of
5 feet sufficiently protective on most occasions. Infantry parties of 100 to
200 men, under the Signalling Officer, usually buried the cable at the dead
of night, in all weathers, sometimes ’neath the moonbeam’s misty light, but
never “with lanterns dimly burning.” A few shells hastened the digging.
Sometimes an electric torch would be nervously used, on the desire of a
digger, to confirm whether he had really stuck his pick into a dead Boche,
though usually no light was wanted to verify this; another would find that the
hard substance he had been attacking was a “dud” shell! Very often lines
were “buried” in canals and rivers, even in sewers.
In moving warfare the burying of cable was not indulged in, as time
and men for assault were much more in demand. It was in this freer move-
ment that other methods were successfully exploited.
Pigeons, although used a good deal in trench life because of their
mobility, immunity from gas attacks, and ready return to a near loft, found
their best service with assaulting parties. Lamp signalling back to pre-
arranged stations also played an important role until the lines were run
forward. But the greatest informers of the progress of battle were the wire-
less men, whether from the air or artillery forward posts, or infantry stations,
or even tanks. Nor must one forget those splendid men, the Runners, who,
like stretcher-bearers, got a bigger share of barrages than anybody else—to
and fro so many times. Motor cyclists, too, came into their own when an
army was on the move. Wireless had developed very rapidly and extensively
after 1917. Each Division had a definite wireless section under a wireless
officer, which was part of the signal service, but planned to give a complete
chain of communication from the front line back to Corps if other methods
failed. But, in addition, the artillery was supplied with a type of wireless
telegraph, entirely a war product, and distinct from the commercial wireless


and the other army types in one essential principle. To the technically initiated
it can best be called', by its proper name, “Continuous Wave Wireless”;
the ordinary system being known as “Spark” wireless (which resulted from
from rapid charges and discharges of current, and so not a continuous
“wave”). Several advantages of great importance in military operations were
proved to belong to the new type —portability, simplicity, rapidity of assembly
or dismantling of parts, adequate range, smallness of the aerial height being
only 5 feet, and length 30 to 50 feet), freedom from interference by other sets
within reasonable distance- Ihe last advantage was of supreme importance,
and enabled a large number of different “wave-lengths” to be employed in
the same field without confusion. Of course, two stations requiring to work
together regularly adopted the same wave length. Just before the Armistice
minor alterations to these sets, made at experimental stations, showed the way
to an efficient wireless telephone service. For artillery work this would have
been of untold benefit in providing immediate information of targets of the
enemy, and in giving the necessary corrections to the gunners shooting. But
the climax was too swift for the laboratories. Since then the air force has
obtained splendid results with this type of wireless telephony. Ihe same was
used by the airship “R 34” on its Atlantic cruise: it offers excellent opportuni-
ties of use in Australia for back-country station life and isolated townships.
The smallest power sets have transmission range up to 30 miles, whilst recep-
tion is many times greater.
New instruments needed operation by signallers who understood them.
To supply these men Signal schools of varying length from a fortnight to
several months were continuously in session in different parts of France and
England : some were intensive and highly technical, others were for turning
out general signallers; others again, like the English six months course,
turned out signal officers from selected N.C.O.’s. Candidates were nominated
from time to time from each unit to these schools; they thereby secured
practical holiday far from the little unpleasantries of more earnest signalling.
In conclusion, one would emphasise the importance of the continuous
need of a rapid and accurate and reliable system of communication. It has
been shown how varied were the methods employed. (In the great advance on
August 8 last year the early fog prevented the use of lamps, but all other
systems were in full operation. Some tanks carried wireless sets, which they
set up in secluded spots). Signallers were able very often to become pos-
sessed of army secrets denied to those outside the temple, and this trust was
worthily appreciated and safeguarded by the Australian Signal Engineers,
who as a body were men of high average alertness, ability, initiative, and
confidence.
The primary purpose of this article is to give information of an indis-
pensable arm of the forces, and the secondary purpose is to stimulate inter-
est in the possibilities of Signal developments in the future Australian army.
Just as the Cambridge University and Woolwich Arsenal Laboratories and
other research centres during the war met the scientific challenge of the
German, so may the Melbourne University scientists play a part in evolving
instruments which are serviceable in peace or war.


The A. A. M.C. in War Time.
BY E. G. COPPEL
STRETCHER-BEARERS ! stretcher-bearers!” For four long years the cry
resounded, with its peculiar mournful intonation, and at each fresh cry a
squad of men came to the spot and untiringly carried on the noblest ser-
vice of the war. They were of all kinds,these stretcher-bearers —tinker, tailor
and ’Varsity student. And they worked like beasts of burden, forever carry-
ing their battered, human freight with what tenderness they might over a
land pitted with shell holes and scored with barbed wire. These are the men
who made the A.A.M.C. no less renowned than the combatant services.
And yet they were but one incident in an organisation which spread from
St. Kilda Road to the Rue de Kanga—that typically Australian street in old
Peronne. An organisation which first declared the patriotic civilian fit to be
a soldier, cared for his mumps and measles in Broadmeadows or Seymour,
stabbed him unmercifully on inoculation parades all the way over to Egypt
or England, and, having made him a person fit to die, proceeded to prevent his
death at every turn from Field Ambulance to Convalescent Home.
You saw the hospitals in one or more Australian camps, when you went
to cheer up your budding Bill-Jim with a home-made cake on Sundays. My
task is to tell you how his fellow-diggers cared for him in those anxious months
aiter you had heard that he was wounded. You wondered if he were com-
fortable, and had good food and warmth, and skilled men to treat his wounds;
or if he were just left an insignificant particle of debris on the huge scrapheap
of war.
Let us suppose your particular Bill-Jim was a full private (there were
many such) in the Nth Field Ambulance, stationed at the Advanced Dressing
Station at the head of Moreuil Gully on May 2nd, 1917.
He did not get much sleep that night, for before daylight a barrage opened
such as British artillery till that time had longed for and longed in vain. For
three hours every gun on the sector, from the 18-pounders sheltered behind
Moreuil to the big naval guns at Beugnatre, nearly five miles further back,
showered its missiles on the famous Hindenburg line. It was the opening
of the spring offensive, which was to break the great defence system, and
commence a new era of open warfare.
Jones on the Nth spent the whole of May 3rd, with the rest of his squad,
carrying the wounded down from the Regimental Aid Post in the road beyond
Moreuil back to the A.D.S., a distance of miles. What remained of the
night he spent at the R.A.P., where a Battalion M.O. and his staff of six
were receiving the wounded from the regimental stretcher-bearers. Here in
a cramped dugout one man after another was brought in to have his wounds
dressed and then be carried back to the A.D.S.
A shell burst beside the stretcher Jones had been carrying continuously
for a day and a half, and he felt as though some gigantic horse had kicked
him in the leg. Having applied a field dressing to the wound, he lay there
until another stretcher squad picked him up and carried him down to the,
A.D.S.


Here he was given a card, on which were written particulars of himself
and his wound. No attempt was made to dress the leg, as the station was
crowded with urgent cases. But he was inoculated against tetanus, and a
purple cross signifying the fact was marked in indelible pencil on his forehea .
He was lifted into a motor ambulance, and for the first time became con-
scious that this kick in the leg was becoming “damned uncomfortab e.
Of course you never could be comfortable in these ambulances, being
carried along head first and bumped over every second shell hole in t
road. It reminded Jones of that fairy tale of the magic carpet he had rea
as a kiddy—only not nearly so pleasant. Queer that he should think of th
now; but then he was thinking of all sorts of queer things. That fellow out-
side driving the car was a digger, and an A.M.C. man, too. He cou d
trying to bump all those shell holes; they were good fellows, these car
After about ten years, it seemed, the car stopped outside the Mam D.S.,
on the road between Beugnatre and Vaulx-Vraucourt. Here were the tent
subdivision of his own ambulance, working at high pressure. ,
Tones was carried inside a marquee, which seemed already full ot
wounded lying on their stretchers. A good Samaritan brought him a cup of
cocoa and some biscuits, and, best of all, a packet of Australian «p^tes.
He brightened up considerably, and began to sympathise with a digg
on the next stretcher, whose face was almost invisible through a mass of
blood-stained bandages. ,
“Had a rough time, Dig?” “Yes,” was the reply, the have
smashed my new set of teeth!” ..
By craning his head a little, he could see that the next marquee was full
of wounded Huns, from whom our walking wounded were demanding
“souvenirs” in a language compounded of English, French, Arabic and pure
Australian. A shout of amusement went up when, on the casualty card
of one Hun was found the terse inscription, “Thoroughly ratted; Nth Aus ra-
han In discourse, Jones had his leg dressed by a white-robed M. 0., who
was attended by two speedy orderlies, and who looked like an angel, even
when he cursed. Then back into the car for the trip down the mam road
through Baupaume to the 3rd Australian C.C.S. at Gravillers. This was some-
thing like” a hospital, with its huge marquees, capable of holding nearly a
thousand men. . _ . . . ,
He was carried from the car into the Reception Tent for stretcher cases
carried by bearers who had made the trip constantly since breakfast that
morning, and would still be making it when daylight broke.
From the Reception Tent, where he was once more identified, Jones was
transferred to the Dressing Tent, where the Admitting Officer examined his
leg, and voted unanimously for immediate operation. Off then to the pre-
paration Tent, where he was undressed, and made ready for the Operating
lheatre that j ones first m ade acquaintance with a Sister,
one of those devoted nurses who approached the divine more nearly than ever
angel did at Mons. The surgeon, the anaesthetist, and a couple of table
orderlies w’ere there, too; but he paid them scant attention as the fumes


began to take effect. He knew no more until he woke up late at night
in the Ward.
After breakfast next morning Private Jones was pronounced fit to
travel, and was carried aboard a hospital train bound for Boulogne. During
most of the journey he slept peacefully—the first real rest he had had these
last three days; days so crowded with incident and excitement that they
seemed like years. And yet it was barely twenty-four hours since he had
been wounded, and by nightfall he would be at the base.
At intervals he was given refreshment by an English nurse or her orderly
—quite a good fellow for a Woodbine. It was dark when the hospital
train steamed into Boulogne, and, being rather tired, Jones took little interest
in the ride out to the 2nd A.G.H., at Wimereux.
Ha was interested next morning, though, to see through the window
a fleet of fishing boats on the Channel. What weary months had passed
since his crossing from England last winter.
The next few days were full of sunshine, and, being a true Australian,
our digger revelled in the civilised comforts of a base hospital—sheets, and
clean pyjamas and warm water. He sent home a Field Service Postcard (a
“whizz bang” or a “quick release” he called it). Do you remember the
official scantiness of it? “I am quite well. I have been admitted into hos-
pital wounded, and am going on well. I have not received a letter from you
lately. J. Jones. 7/5/17. * * What digger ever crossed out that first sentence?
As the hospital life became irksome, he would ask the M.O. each morning
what chance he had of a trip to Blighty. His request was granted a week'
later, when he could manage to scramble on board the hospital ship on
crutches in his blue uniform with the socialist tie.
He sat on deck during the crossing, watching the painted destroyers
circle round their convoy, until the cliffs of England came in sight. And
there, now that you know he is on the way to recovery, we will leave him
standing with a heart full of thankfulness for the men and women who have
cared for him, leave him dreaming of long, lazy days of convalescence among
the hedgerows of an English countryside. He has still more hospitals to
visit, convalescent homes and depots; but of these he told you all in his
letters —all save the story of the nurse he almost married.
A ’Varsity Man with the Army Veterinary Corps.
BY HAROLD A. WOODRUFF.
WITH very few exceptions the University men in the Australian Army
Veterinary Corps were graduates or licentiates, and so received
commissions as captains on commencing their service. In almost
all cases these officers had had no previous war or even army experience,
and from the very beginning right to the end novel situations undreamed of
during under-graduate days and in civil practice were arising and had to be
12


met. Initiative, imagination and resource are important enough qualifications
for any officer, but for a veterinary officer, if he is to be what he should bq
to his unit commander, they are essential. , ,
The first new experience was to have veterinary charge of several hundred
horses on a horse transport going to Egypt. The conditions under which
horses are transported are about as unnatural as could be devised, especially
for Australian horses. Unable to lie down, railed up in a stall under 2ft. 6in.
wide, with improvised and far from perfect ventilation arrangements, and
with the top of a hatch as the only exercising ground, to be carefully reserved
for the sick, the animals were severely tested by a 40-50 days’ voyage from
one temperate climate to another across the equator. Suffice to say that the
mortality of horses transported in the first expeditionary force from Austra ia
was the lowest ever recorded, amounting to less than 2 per cent, on a total
of over 5000 horses. For this the veterinary officers are entitled to great
In Egypt another new experience was the handling, management, and
treatment of mules. The mule appears to have a psychology all his own both
in health and disease, and he afforded the veterinary man considerable scope
for study. Incidentally the mules introduced the possibility of observing a
disease of equines unknown in Australia, but not uncommon in America and
in the countries round about the Mediterranean—namely, Glanders.
Then again, camels, except to men from Western Australia, were known
only at the Zoo or by repute. In Egypt, Australian veterinary officers had
to supervise shipment, management, and treatment of camels—a task which
made no appeal to any man of my acquaintance. E\en the infliction of a
hump (vide Kipling) has not produced repentance and reform in the camel.
Two common diseases of the camel were new to Australian veterinarians
namely, mange (corresponding to scabies of man) and camel-pox, a near
relation to small-pox of man and to cow-pox.
Among horses in Egypt a disease known as “biliary fever,” due to a pro-
tozoan parasite of the blood, and very similar to Australian tick fever of
cattle, made its appearance and gave rise to considerable trouble. Ihis again
provided a new subject of interest.
The Gallipoli operations were not of a nature to require much veterinary
work, and only two or three Australian veterinary graduates landed on the
Peninsula. Among the transport mules there were a few casualties requir-
ing attention. The Senussi expedition to the west of Egypt also employed
at least one of our veterinary graduates, who did good service with a Mobile
Veterinary Section.
Apart from these expeditions, veterinary officers were chiefly concerned
w ith—(l) supervision and management of large numbers of horses left behind
in Egypt by Light Horse Brigades serving on Gallipoli, (2) the transport of
animals to France and active operations there with the five Australian Divi-
sions, (3) the operations of the Mounted Division in Egypt and Palestine.
Of the “standing-by” period in Egypt little need be said. The health of
the animals was generally good, and no disease of any special interest
occurred. The feeding arrangements were strange to Australian animals,
with barley as the chief grain ration, but horses accommodated themselves
to strange diets very well and veterinary officers widened their experience.


With the move to France came an entirely new set of conditions. First
as to organisation. With the Headquarters of each Division was an adminis-
trative officer —the Assistant Director of Veterinary Services (A.D.V.S.), with
the rank of Major, another officer commanding the Mobile Veterinary Section,
and 5 officers attached to Artillery Brigades, the Divisional i rain, and other
units. Besides these commissioned officers there were 2 5 sergeants of the
Army Veterinary Corps acting under one or other of the veterinary officers for
first aid work. These men, with 1 or possibly 2 exceptions, were non-
University men, and so not of special concern in this article, but a word of|
praise must be given for the loyal and very valuable service they rendered
in a position offering no chances of promotion to commissioned rank.
The unit veterinary officer had as his chief work the keeping of animals
in hard condition and free from disease so as to be fit for a heavy stuntj
whenever required. Various contagious diseases were always liable to appear
—notably parasitic mange (a very serious skin disease responsible for more
loss in horseflesh in the armies in France than almost any other disease),
glanders, and a curious but very serious form of ophthalmia beginning as
an iritis. Keen observation and then some amount of tact in giving timely
warning and advice to infantry transport officers and artillery officers in
charge of wagon lines, were necessary if a good standard of mobility of units
was to be maintained. Other duties were to attend to sick, injured, and
wounded animals remaining with their units, and to make the necessary
arrangements for the removal of all protracted cases to the Mobile Veterinary
Section, from which they were dispatched to the Base Hospital.
During the various offensive “pushes” animal casualties became seri-
ous. For example, during the 1918 Somme operations some of the Austra-
lian Artillery Brigades had 30 per cent., others as many as 40 per cent, of
their animals battle casualties from bombs, shells, bullets, or gas. As great,
or even greater, were the losses in the Passchendaele stunt. At these times
the small band of veterinary officers—less than 1 per brigade—and their
sergeants were worked almost beyond endurance, and the Mobile Veterinary
Section often became immobile because it was filled to overflowing. Then it
was converted for the time being into a field stationary hospital.
The evacuation of sick or wounded animals to the base was, however, in
the main usually possible and generally well arranged. Working cases were
sent by road, the horses tied in pairs on either side of a long cable and con-
ducted by a sergeant and party of men of the M.V.S. On the roads were
“sick horse halts” for rest each night. More serious cases were removed to
hospital either by canal barges where possible, or by train, and each M.V.S.
had a horse ambulance.
The Divisional A.D.V.S. was responsible for the posting of veterinary
officers to their units, and with movements of troops the posting had to be
changed very frequently. In addition to this, many small units of Corps or
Army troops not belonging to the Division had to be administered by the
Divisional Staff when in the Divisional area. Thus Australian veterinary
officers had to supervise Imperial, Canadian or other units, and the Australian
A.D.V.S often had veterinary officers of the Imperial or Canadian A.V.C.
under his command. Then there was at no time more than 1 Australian
Base Veterinary Hospital in France, so that for the most part animals sick
12 a


and wounded had to be evacuated to Imperial Base Hospitals with officers of
the R.A.V.C. This reciprocity was extremely valuable to the veterinary
officers concerned, for it provided interchange of experience, and appreciation
of one another which, in not a few instances, has developed into friendship
of a lasting kind.
Turning now to Egypt and Palestine, we find that another and quite
different set of circumstances faced the veterinary officers serving with the
Light Horse in the Mounted Division. Here there was no Australian Base
Veterinary Hospital, but animals had to be evacuated to British clearing
stations and hospitals. Then, too, to a much greater extent than in France,
British units were under Australian veterinary officers. Again, the Directorate
of Veterinary Services was entirely British. In view of these facts the follow-
ing extract from an official publication is of interest: —
“While speaking of Australian and New Zealand units it may here be
remarked that the high professional standard of veterinary officers of the
forces of these Dominions, their devotion to duty, and loyalty to the Direc-
torate has been a marked and pleasing feature in the veterinary history of the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force.’’
This association of Imperial and Australian veterinary officers for the
year of war has been a most valuable experience. Our University Veterinary
School is, with the exception of the Sydney school, the youngest which has
sent out officers to the British Armies, and it is very pleasing to be able to
put on record the mutual appreciation and respect which has grown up
between our graduates and those of the British and Canadian schools. The
Melbourne school has every right to be gratified at the reception her men have
everywhere received from unit commanders, senior veterinary officers and
others.
As in France, so in Egypt, initiative and resource in overcoming extraor-
dinary situations was necessary to a successful veterinary officer. Here is an
extract from a letter from one of our veterinary graduates :
“Conditions for evacuating were often extremely bad. After reaching
Damascus, for instance, 300 sick and injured horses were making the two
Mobile Veterinary Sections there immobile, and aa a further advance was
pending it was necessary to get rid of these animals. The nearest Clearing
Station was about 350 miles away; the party detailed for the job of travelling
these horses by road consisted of 100 odd Turk prisoners (as debilitated as
the horses), 1 sergeant, and 9 troopers as escort, and an A.A.V.C. personnel
of 1 officer and 3 privates.”
The remedial veterinary work on this front was of a very general nature.
Besides sickness from various diseases the constant sources of trouble among
horses and mules were debility from hard work and irregularity of food and
water supplies, lameness, and saddle injuries. Shell wounds were few, but
those from bombs dropped from aeroplanes were plentiful.
Reviewing the work of the A.A.V.C. in general, it may be said that
the emphasis was especially on the maintenance of good hygiene for all
transport animals and that few veterinary officers had any opportunity to
obtain hospital experience or great surgical practice. The work was more
of the slow, solid variety than of the more showy kind.


Promotion came in the way of comparatively few men, for the establish-
ment admitted the promotion of 25 per cent, of captains to be majors, while
only three could rise to the rank of lieut.-colonel. Thus the material rewards
were small to men who had left practices or appointments for active service.
Of military honours and distinctions there were a fair number, including
1 C.M.G., 2 D.S.O.’s, 2 M.C.’s, and several mentions.
Casualties among veterinary officers in the A.I.F. were remarkably low
cqmpared with the Imperial and New Zealand services. The only officer
“killed in action” was Major Cyril Robert Seelenmeyer, M.C., one of the
most popular graduates the School has known, and one whose loss is deeply
deplored by his old comrades.
Of the total number of whole-time graduates and licentiates trained in
the school since its foundation to the signing of the armistice {56), a total
of 46, or 82 per cent., have served overseas in the armies of the Empire—•
surely a record of which the University and its school may be proud.
Some Fun in a War Balloon.
BY G. M. CRIVELLI, LIEUTENANT, F.A.S.
WAR is not all tears and gnashing of teeth; fortunately there are some
jokes in it, too, not the sort one would perpetrate in a drawing-
room, perhaps, but who would want war in one’s drawing-room?
The balloon service is one of those exclusive services like the tanks, about
which no one knows anything except those actually in it. Consequently we
often get asked to tell all about ourselves. This sounds easy, and so it is
to a certain extent. We are the “eyes of the army,” and therefore all that
is required of us is to see. If you wish to know what we had to see, then
the task of answering becomes immense, and I would have to undertake a
text book on tactics. This were tedious now 1 that the war is over, and I
would much prefer to show the untechnical side of our lives—the side the
jokes occur on.
Quiet sectors were usually the “funny” sectors with balloon men, and
consequently they were the best hated by observers. In a very active sector
the observer was kept busy every minute of his time, and had not a moment of
worry about himself; here he was well protected, too, because of innumerable
battle planes all about, keeping off the German planes, and innumerable
heavy guns always in readiness to smash up aggressive enemy guns. But in
quiet sectors the planes only flew when they had some special work to do,
and the poor observer had to be there to keep watch all day over a sweep
of country where nothing happened to divert his thoughts from the four
thousand foot drop awaiting him should his bubble burst. It was in a sector
such as this, near the Swiss border, that the following “joke” occurred.


We called it the “Sector of Separate Peace,” because the war was some-
thing that hardly concerned it. On land nothing ever happened except the
writing of millions of reports in triplicate about the jam ration or the neces-
sity for gas-mask drill, and when the Germans did anything rash, such as
bring one of their guns to see if it could still shoot, everyone would rush to
the windows to see what was happening. ,
In such a sector life would have been one deadly monotony of armed red
tape, were it not for the balloons. To everyone but balloonists these were a
godsend. Every bne day the bright yellow cylinder of a balloon would floaty
peaceably thousands of feet up in the blue heavens, and after having dined
well, the whole sector would lean against anything comfortable, and while
enjoying its post-prandial cigar in the sun, would gaze with satished expect-
ancy at the little dot against the blue. Never was it disappointed. Soon tic
drone of engines would come faintly through the depths of the summer haze,
growing rapidly more loud and vibrating. Then would be staged one ot
the most spectacular little dramas the world has ever produced.
The sky would become dotted with little flecks of woolly smoke, as our
anti-aircraft guns got to work. These flecks grew larger and larger and
broke with a rending crash as they followed the enemy nearer and nearer
the balloon. Then as the planes came in sight of the naked eye, machine
guns would simply rip the air with the sound of tearing of thousands of
flannel shirts, and the balloon would give a plunge as its winch engine started
off hauling it down at top speed. The planes would come right above the
balloon, and with stopped engine, down would come the attacking one,
screaming through the air like a projectile. Taking no heed of the explosives
all about him, he would straighten up a little above the balloon and his
incendiary bullets, like a glowing dart from some poisonfly, would show in
a glittering stream for a fraction of a second. Instantly a sheet of flame
would rise up, and ten seconds afterwards a large black interrogation mark
of smoke, visible for miles, would be all that remained of the huge solid-
looking balloon ; as it slowly faded on the breeze it brought home to one with
a shock the instability of earthly things—the suddenness of this transforma-
tion from something to nothing had something terrifying about it. One
thing remained, however—something all-important. Under the gruesome
black pall appeared a tiny white speck, growing rapidly larger and larger,
glowing like a jewel in the sky. The observer had jumped with his beautiful
white silk parachute, and came safely to earth, soon to be lost to sight
among the trees. ,
The whole sector would then rush to its telephone to call up the balloon
company and find out if he was all right, then, feeling that it had had its
money’s worth, it would return once more with a sigh to red tape, and await
the next day’s performance. .....
The reason for the regular staging of this really extraordinarily thrilling
drama was that on the other side of the lines was a German flying school,
and, to be entitled to drive a battleplane, the student had to bring down a
French balloon. Bringing down two of our balloons was considered as great
an exploit as smashing three of our aviators, so nerve-racking was the plunge
into the dense barrage of shells and machine-gun bullets. You might wonder
why we persisted in going up in this place, but a little thought will show that


it was necessary. Air supremacy is fifty per cent, a matter of moral, and we
could not possibly give Fritz the triumph of saying he had frightened us so
that we dare not put our balloons up any longer!
We were by no means passive, however. One may easily imagine how
we racked our brains and planned all sorts of schemes to demoralize the
students of that aeroplane school. We knew them well, those school planes.
They always came by four. One of them—the student—was to burn the
balloon; he was followed closely by the professor. If the student failed, the
professor never did. High above flew a plane with a camera to photograph
the exploit, while round him circled a battle plane to keep our own airships
off, should any appear. These details were learned from one who was shot
down and made prisoner.
We organized the most highly perfected defence. The foremost infantry
observatories were connected directly with us by telephone to report when the
four planes were first seen coming far across the German lines, we had as
many as forty machine guns and twelve anti-aircraft guns, all experts at their
jobs, but owing to the speed of the attack —the whole thing usually lasting
trom two to three minutes—the fear of hitting the observer, and the truly
extraordinary luck of the German aviators, nothing availed, and our balloon
was always burned.
Finally the observers, who were getting rather fed up of parachuting as
an after lunch diversion, thought out the joke.
One beautiful clear day, most tempting for an attack, we put no observer
in the basket, but instead we loaded it up with four hundred pounds of
cheddite. This was sufficient to cause such a displacement of air as would
blow the statue of liberty from New York to Washington. We connected this
charge with a battery by a five thousand foot wire, and let the balloon up as
high as she would go.
The whole balloon company was in a state of hardly suppressed excite-
ment. We wished we could see the expression on Fritz’s face when he should
get near the balloon and the whole atmosphere would turn inside out. The
most gleeful man of all was the observer who should have been up in the
air—myself, by the way. I felt that this was the life. We had cameras, and
even visitors specially invited to see the show.
After lunch the infantry duly announced four planes crossing the lines
at X . We knew what that meant, and the men were fairly dancing with
excitement. Our guns fired a few stray shots at them so that they would
not think things were suspiciously easy, and over they came in the regula-
tion manner. Finally, at an enormous height above the balloon, one of them
circled twice, then the drone of his engine ceased, giving an oppressive
silence, as though something had poised before striking—one has the same
crushed sensation in the heavy stillness that precedes a dreadful storm.
I hen we heard the scream as he rushed through the air—our guns were
not firing, the men were so taken with what w T as coming; then he straightened
just above the balloon, perhaps fifty feet from it, and the Company Com-
mander yelled “Fire !”
We all held our breath as the Lieutenant pressed the switch over. We
heard the rat-tat-tat of the enemy machine gun, and saw the lightning-like
stream of glowing incendiary bullets flash between the plane and the balloon,


then ... the balloon burst into flame with hardly a sound, the plane
flew away unscatched, and we realized that something had gone wrong and
thC of a veil, i. occurred .o us that five thousand
feet above our heads were four hundred pounds of cheddite with nothing to
hold them there. In fact they had already started on their terrific downward
journey ! We all seemed to catch each other’s eye at once; some of us turned
white and some red, and never in my life have I seen men run as we ran
did not know where I was going, but it did not matter, just so long
WCnt ßefore I had got nearly far enough to please me, I heard the whistling
scream of the loaded basket, coming, seemingly, straight for my hea •
threw myself flat on the ground, but my hands over my ears and wondered
I should'be torn to atoms or only buried.
There was a dull thud, a moment of agonized suspense, then a deep
breath. Once more the faithful cheddite had failed to go off. So we
gathered around and laughed at ourselves like a lot of schoolgir s.
And that, at war, is what is known as a joke ! f
I am afraid Fritz was the person really entitled to the laugh, but,
course he does not know. r ~.
The powers that be refused to let us repeat the attempt, for fear the
cheddite might go off next time it hit the ground, and thereby eliminate a
perfectly good balloon company from the French Army. ,
Another episode which furnished our mess with matter for much ill-b
hilarity at my expense occurred in an active sector this time. was co
as the coldest cold your imagination can conceive, and up m the air the wi d
was like a series of ra.or blades. Each breath was like swallowmg a arge
lump of ice-cream without giving it time to melt m the mouth and anything
metallic burnt one’s fingers like fire, even through the thickest gloves. Our
planes, owing partly to a series of m.sfortunes and partly to the cold, were
unable to fly, and the artillery had some very urgent work that had to be
done so the frozen balloon was lifted from its bed, and its ropes, stiff as iron
rods’ were thawed out in the sun and by rubbing and heating in every way
possible to soften and render them less brittle, for frozen ropes break like
glaS \Vhile this was going on I put on my heaviest suit of electrically heated
furs with copper wires running from head to foot inside them. My face and
fingers were vaselined, and into a large thermos flask was poured boiling
hot tea with lots of sugar and a generous ration of rum. As a preliminary
precaution I had eaten a large bowl of hot soup, which made me glow with
internal warmth. , , . T e a
Soon all was ready. As the balloon rose into the icy air I f o a plan
of action, for I knew how temptation would soon beset my path. The work
to be done would require about three hours, therefore I should leave the
thermos strictly alone for an hour and a half. At half-past one it would be
half-time, and I should then renew my internal heat by hot tea to keep me
going the remaining hour and a half.
Against that dreadful cold all my precautions seemed as nothing. At
four thousand feet the wind came through my furs, and I could feel it like


cold water running down my spine. In an hour I began to feel the cold,
and soon it was agony. I could scarcely hold my glasses, they burnt my
fingers so, and the moisture from my breath was frozen in little icicles on
the fur about my face. 1 looked at the time—only twenty more minutes
and I would have a delicious hot ration of tea. At the mere thought I began
to revive, the work of adjusting fire seemed terribly slow, but I would not
submit to temptation, for I was not yet half finished.
Suddenly in a wood, miles away across the German lines, I saw a flash
like an electric spark, with a little faint, puff of grey, smoke rising slowly
above the glistening snow. It was a gun, of course, but for the moment I
was occupied elsewhere, and could not bother with it.
About thirty seconds later I heard a dull boom, followed by the howling
screech of a shell. Instinctively I ducked my head, there was a terrifying
crash, and as I looked up I saw, about 100 yards in front of me, the gruesome
black smoke of a high explosive shell slowly dissipating in the wind, at exactly
the right height for the balloon.
It was not yet all gone when I saw another flash in the wood. For
thirty seconds I could feel that shell coming straight for my head, then it
came !
This time it broke with a metallic “Ping!” followed by the buzzing of
a hundred shrapnel balls as they whizzed through the air. I looked around
and saw the smoke behind me. Next shot would surely be a target.
It took me by surprise, for I had not seen the flash, but it seemed to
explode inside my head. The bullets buzzed all around, there was a light
sound of a smashing glass and the basket became filled with steam. I looked
down and found that my thermos was broken, and my beautiful hot tea and
rum—the careful saving up of a whole week’s ration, alas !—were spread
about my feet.
If the Germans had been gentlemen they would have peppered my bal-
loon full of holes so that it would have brought me to the ground lor lie;,:,
hot supplies. But, being Germans, they now ceased fire—l never understood
why—and so I had to stay up and slowly freeze. This was made the worse
because my storage batteries had got out of order in the general excitement,
and so my furs were no longer heated.
I telephoned down and told them I was frozen, but got no sympathy—
they seemed to think that because I was not shot I should be happy. I told
them with tears in my voice that my week’s ration of rum was gone, but they
only laughed at me; I tried to warm myself by cursing their heartless con-
duct, but if it had any effect on them it had none on me. I realized that this
was another war joke !
Finally, when the work was done, I had to be lifted out of the basket
and massaged back to life. But at mess that night I was the butt of much
ribald laughter to the tune of “Who stored up his rum for a week instead of
drinking it like a Christian!”
I think these “jokes” may give a better insight into the kind of existence
we had than any dissertation on the technicalities of our work.
We could not look gloomy for four years and a half, so we simply had
to find something to laugh at, these examples of the “humorous” side of our
lives are such as would occur at least once in every week, and in fact it is
13


only when the war-beast claimed a comrade for his prey that for days on end
life seemed to hold nothing in it about which one could jest to hide the deeper
feelings that lay beneath.
The Hour before Dawn.
August 8th, 1918.
BY J.H.B.A.
IT is very quiet; away on the right the sky flickers a little and a dull thunder
answers. But here the night is pitch black, save when a flare from the
German line throws everything into dazzling relief. A tree, shattered and
distorted, starts out of the blackness, and for a moment hangs like a broken
cross against the glare. Nearer a few iron pickets and a tangle of rusty
barb wire; and just beyond, three shapes, huddled and still, that once were
men. The ball of fire hovers, and drops hissing to the sodden earth. Had
it been better aimed you might have seen a trench, just a narrow gutter sunk
six feet in the ground, widening at the extremities into two shell holes .. *
and in the trench five men. Mud-stained, filthy, with faces covered with
stubble of beard, with bloodshot, sleepless eyes —these are the real fighting
men of the 20th century. Tattered colour patches proclaim them Australians,
men transported half across the world to fight an unknown foe in a foreign
land. Closer scrutiny would reveal them strangely restive, each man staring
fixedly into the night towards the German trenches. A machine gun rests on
the parapet, and bombs lie handy in niches cut in the face of the trench. For
this, the hour before the dawn, is the darkest, coldest and most nerve-racking
of all for those who hold the front line. But this is to be a day of days; in
less than an hour the soul-shaking crash of a stupendous barrage will herald
a great Allied attack. Thousand after thousand of picked, trained men will
be launched against the German positions.
But all this is not yet. The five grim men in the muddy trench are
assailed with a great sense of loneliness—of utter isolation. Two hours
ago their comrades withdrew to a position half a mile in rear. With the
exception of the tiny outpost, and a similar one four hundred yards away
on either flank, not a soul occupies the front line trenches. Behind the
support line the storm troops are assembling for the attack, and further back
still artillery and transport are making their final preparations. But these
at least have the solace of action. For the lonely watchers out in front
nothing remains but to wait, to keep guard until twenty minutes before the
barrage falls, and then to creep back somehow, anyhow, to the rear of the
storm troops.
From the German trench, sixty yards away, comes the muffled sound
of a cough. In the dead stillness it sounds very near. At such times as


these every nerve is strung to breaking-point, and imagination runs riot. All
sorts of shapeless things move about in No Man’s Land. Queer sounds and
noises call tor an explanation which is never forthcoming. A rustle in the
darkness, and again that muffled cough, cough Part of the outpost’s
job is to mislead the enemy into believing everything to be as usual in our
line. The afflicted Boche affords a pretext for action. The lieutenant in
charge of the post presses the gunner’s arm, and a second later the bang
and chatter of the machine gun rends the quiet night, only to be succeeded by
a more unearthly stillness than before.
The officer glances covertly at his watch. Much depends upon him. He
must keep guard until the very last moment. He must get his men back in
time to escape the danger of their own barrage, and he alone knows the way
through the waiting masses behind. All sorts of possibilities crowd through
his mind. Suppose the Huns have got wind of these mighty preparations and
attack first. Suppose, as has happened before, they fling a devastating bar-
rage on the defenceless men crouched on the tape. Suppose they use gas.
Suppose the watch, so carefully synchronised three hours before, is wrong.
Suppose half a hundred things. Anyway, only twenty minutes more to wait.
Suddenly it seems lighter round the horizon; the edge of the trench shows
vaguely now; and from away in rear, back towards the shattered ruins of
Villers Brettoneux, comes a humming, clanking sound. The five silent men
look at each other; in imagination each pictures the weird, uncanny shapes
of the tanks —the harbingers of modern battle, lumbering drunkenly through
the darkness to their appointed positions. Closer and closer until the noise
of the great engines seems to shout a warning to the doomed men beyond,
and the machine gun barks and rattles in a vain attempt to drown the sound.
Gradually the light strengthens, and little white wraiths seem to rise
from the ground and hover in the air—“ Fog!” Is it to be an attack in a
baffling, blinding mist, when men lose touch, and friend slays friend? Only
five minutes before the withdrawal now, and on the instant the thud, thud of
a German field battery and the whining shriek of a high velocity shell. Shrap-
nel crashes and hisses over the outpost, and another battery opens up further
to the left. For an appalling moment it seems as if the worst is about to
be realized —that the enemy has got wind of our plans and made counter
preparations. The moment to retire from the outpost is almost here, and
there is barely time to reach safety before the attack begins. Bursting
shells flicker through the swirling fog, now showing up white and ghastly in
the growing light. The leader gives a final glance at his watch; a muttered
order, and five figures rise out of the ground and stumble blindly towards
the rear. Everything rests on sense of direction now; it is impossible to see
two yards ahead. Fifty yards back the deserted front line trench offers
welcome shelter for a short distance. Four men slide thankfully into it, but
the fifth grunts suddenly and falls face forward. A man bends over him, and
rising shakes his head. One more name is added to Australia’s list of fallen.
The shells are fewer now, and the fog seems to thin. From above comes
the buzzing drone of a scouting aeroplane. A ruin looms up suddenly—just
a shapeless mass of bricks and tangled iron. We must turn sharp left here,
and go on until we reach the lailway, or, rather, where the railway used
to be. Suddenly we are in the midst of men —dozens, hundreds of white-
13A


faced, crouching figures lining the white tape that is laid along the ground.
These are the storm troops who will be “over the top” in less than twd
minutes now. Here and there a huddled heap shows that those searching
shells were not altogether in vain. On and on, twisting and turning, tripping
over rusty wire and falling into mud-filled shell holes. On and on, until at
last a gloriously familiar voice, and we have reached our rendezvous. It is
only a shallow, disused trench, but it is home for the present. In two minutes
the barrage will begin. Ihe leader’s thoughts fly back for a moment to the
empty outpost, to the lifeless body lying behind it, so full of pluck and
cheeriness one short hour since, to the doomed Boche coughing in the German
trench, probably thinking more of breakfast than anything else now. Half
a minute more —ten seconds ! Away on the right a machine gun opens with
a long throbbing drone, and then, Ahhh—dear God! The earth seems to
open and a sheet of living flame leaps across the sky. The soul-shaking crash
of a thousand guns seems to burst the very ear drums and sets every nerve
a-quiver. Again and again, with ever-increasing intensity, that earth-made
thunder rolls from horizon to horizon. Ihe men on the tape leap to their
feet and walk leisurely forward. It is the turning-point—the beginning of
the end.
“Intelligence” in the Great War.
BY CAPTAIN A. LAUGHLIN.
TO the lay mind the term “Intelligence Corps’’ has represented a body
of careful and industrious men whose sole function was to collect, tabu-
late and map all information referring to the nation’s resources for
defence or offence, and to the resources of possible enemies or allies.
Apart from the fact that secret agents were employed to obtain much ol
the information desired, the layman could see nothing very extraordinary in
the achievements of the Intelligence Corps in peace time. It was simply a
matter of obtaining dry-as-dust information, plotting and filing it. But with
the outbreak of war the Intelligence Corps assumed a new importance. Hav-
ing handed over to those concerned with the fighting of the war machine a
very complete and accurate summary of information concerning the enemy,
it had now the very difficult task of keeping this mass of information up-
to-date.
This summary contained all possible information about the enemy that
could be gleaned in peace time. It included details of enemy army and navy
personnel lists, dispositions, recruitment areas, complete maps and reports
on all roads, defensive areas, rivers, forests, towns in Germany, Belgium and
Franee, personal studies of enemy commanders, and masses of highly technical
information. It concluded with scientific reports on the ultimate resources


of the enemy in men and material and statements of the possible plans of
campaign which the enemy could choose.
Not only did “Intelligence” keep this information up-to-date, but it
explored and opened up many new channels of information. It became the
eyes and ears of the army. The situation demanded an extended and intimate
knowledge of the enemy’s activity and intentions; and the Intelligence Corps,
realizing this, grew in size and confidence, and in due course became a branch
of the General Staff.
It is to be remembered that the rosy times of peace no longer existed,
that a strict censorship on all possible sources of information had been
established, that the warring nations were separated by a strip of No Man’s
Land or sea, the crossing of which was immediately resented by the enemy
in a violent manner; that it was exceedingly difficult for civilians to enter
or leave the war zone—in short, that a very resourceful and vigilant enemy
was taking elaborate precautions to prevent the leakage of information.
Therefore information had to be fought for or obtained by the exercise of
guile and cunning, and all the intelligence and science that the nations pos-
sessed. “Intelligence” rose to the occasion, so that, during the war, our infor-
mation concerning the enemy was absolutely up-to-date, was accurate and
very complete.
The General Staffs of the Allied armies were kept informed of—
(1) The Disposition of the Enemy. —The position of every enemy divi-
sion from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier, on the Italian Front and up to
the time of the Russian defection on the Eastern Front, were known. By
this is not only meant that, for instance, the 93rd German Reserve Infantry
Division was known to be somewhere between Lille and the North Sea, but
that the actual area it occupied was known and defined, whether it was in
support or reserve, or at rest in some back area, what were its duties, alarm
post, its programme of recreation or training. If it were in the line the bound-
aries of its responsibility, its days of relief, where and by what routes it
would go when relieved were known.
All this was known not merely of one division, but of the 300 odd enemy
divisions on the Western Front. (We shall confine our attention to the
Western Front.) This information was mapped and distributed weekly to all
concerned.
(2) Details of the Enemy Defences. —All enemy artillery positions were
accurately mapped and defined according to calibre and activity of the pieces.
Special artillery maps were used, on which not only were individual
batteries marked, but the groupings of batteries were indicated accord-
ing to the probable defensive or offensive schemes of enemy artil-
lery commanders. The accurate work of this special department of Intel-
ligence accorded in a great measure for the effectiveness of our counter battery
work during the last two years of the war. Knowledge of the enemy’s
defences, however, was not confined to a detailed knowledge of the positions,
calibre and direction of fire of his artillery batteries. It included equally
accurate information concerning his machine gun and trench mortar positions;
and his lines of communication, including strategic and light railways, trench
tramways, roads suitable for heavy motor traffic and those only suitable for
horse transport, infantry roads and tracks, refilling points, railheads, engi


neering, artillery and ration dumps, ordnance depots, headquarters, hospitals,
camps, billeting areas. Information was also obtained on special systems
of enemy defence—barbed wire entanglements, their extent and “holding up”
capacity, “pill boxes,” strong points, tank traps, communication and hre
trenches, overhead and underground telephone or telegraph lines, tunnels
and all positions incidental to stationary trench warfare-
(3). Miscellaneous. —Army lists were kept up to date, and personal notes
on enemy commanders, even in some cases down to company commanders,
were revised and enlarged as information came in, so that those who were
interested could learn whether such and such an officer cultivated moustaches,
what his subordinates thought of him, whether he was a “dug out” king,
what his attitude upon political or other questions of the day was. Iho
foibles, inclinations and idiosyncrasies of the members of higher commands
were known, so that often it was possible to gauge their actions under
certain sets of circumstances.
All details of enemy equipment and ordnance were kept up to date. A
new type of gun would be known and located within two days of its first shell
crossing No Man’s Land, sometimes even before it fired its first shot in anger.
An army book was periodically issued by Intelligence containing in great
detail all information concerning enemy personnel, equipment, ordnance, and
resources in all branches of the army. This secret publication was almost as
complete as any similar publication on the British army, written by a member
of it, could be.
In addition to the above important matters, Intelligence amassed a vast
amount of incidental and interesting, though comparatively unimportant,
material, all of which was logged and filed for reference.
The question naturally arises, “How in the face of the obvious difficulties
was all this accurate and complete information obtained.” Before dealing
with another function of Intelligence, wherein its fallibility was most evi-
denced, I shall attempt to answer that question.
Intelligence in the British Army is a branch of the General Staff, which is
divided into three branches. (1) G.S. Training, concerned with the training
of troops for the battle. (2) G.S. Operations, concerned with the battle
and all the movements prior to and after the battle. (3). G.S. Intelligence,
concerned with collection and distribution of information about the enemy.
The first two branches are concerned entirely with their own troops. The
third group is concerned entirely with the enemy, and endeavours to obtain
as complete information about his movements and intentions as the other
branches have about their own army.
The Intelligence Branch itself is sub-divided into three sub-branches.
(1) 1(B). Dealt with contra-espionage.
It will suffice to merely touch upon the first two sub-branches, as we are
concerned mainly with I (G).
(1) S(T). Dealt with contra-espionage.
Very few people in France, either soldiers or civilians, knew that the
whole of the war zone in France was divided into contra-espionage districts,
with adequate and competent staffs of contra-espionage police; and that every
town or village had its quota of vigilant secret police, whose purpose and
identity were not known even to the French villagers with whom they lived


and became so friendly. Nobody would suspect that stupid-looking English
soldier left behind to guard some regimental stores in a village well behind
the lines, whose only social ambition was to increase his smattering of French,
to be an accomplished linguist, whose real object was to know the identity
and purpose in life of everyone living or entering the village. His periodic
and extraordinary reports to his superior officer would have left no doubts as
to his usefulness in the war machine.
(2) I (T) was concerned with information concerning enemy war trade.
The duty of the staff of this branch was to collect and examine all
material which might have any bearing on enemy industries and trade re*
lations.
The blacklisting of many firms of neutral countries and the examination
of the trade relations of British firms suspected of trading with the enemy
were the direct result of the activity of this branch. The discovery of a case
where the materials supplied by a British firm to the Germans were utilized by
them in the building of “Pill Boxes” is illustrative of this branch’s investi-
gations. The discovery of the use of the fibre of the common nettle by the
enemy as a substitute for cotton also stands to the credit of this branch.
Other numerous and interesting examples of the function of I (B) could be
quoted.
Now we come to the branch with which we are most concerned, I (G),
or Intelligence with the fighting forces. Its work was always of the most
immediate value to the army. The sources of I (G) information were many
and varied. They include such sources as —(1) Secret agents, (2) aircraft,
(3) ground observers, (4) prisoners, (5) documents, (6) listening and wireless
sets.
(1) Secret Agents. —One is unable to speak with much authority on this
head, for the machinations of our army secret agents were, for obvious
reasons, only known to a select few. Such information as we received from
this source bore only the mystic words, “secret agent,” and was franked by
the headquarters of a higher formation ; and it may be said that this informa-
tion, in most instances, was only of confirmatory value. Anything of extra-
ordinary value or importance would be communicated only to the supreme
war chiefs, and to them alone, and the origin of the information would remain
with them. This also for obvious reasons.
Much confirmatory information as to the movements of troops in rear
areas was received frm this source, often, however, too late to be of value, for
information once obtained by a secret agent had to be forwarded to the right
quarters, and that often meant a considerable delay. An account of some of
the means whereby our agents were successful in penetrating enemy territory
would provide some thrilling reading.
Aeroplanes were even used for dropping agents in enemy territory and
picking them up again on the completion of their duty.
(2) Aircraft. —lnformation obtained by the Air Service was of the highest
importance and accuracy. The aeroplane provided a means whereby a close
reconnaissance by skilled observers could be made of any area, however dis-
tant.
Air observers were trained to develop the bird sense of sight, and to
correctly interpret the evidences of human avtivity spread below them, so that


where the untrained observer would see merely patches of bare earth, the
trained observer would see signs of activity and portents pregnant with
meaning. This war has spelt the doom of cavalry for reconnaissance purposes,
unless military science, in order to keep the game going, makes the heavens
Aerial photography reached a very high grade of perfection. The whole
of the enemy forward defences were carefully photographed at least once a
week so that a close watch could be kept upon the enemy’s activity m the
maintenance of his defensive works. In short, the careful and continuous
study of aerial photographs enabled us to immediately detect any change
in the enemy’s domestic routine, to assign causes for such changes and, i
necessary, to take steps to frustrate the enemy’s designs. Prom the mass ol
information standards for everything were evolved, and thus it became easy
to recognize quickly any abnormal behaviour on the part of the enemy. Ihe
study of aerial photographs needed special training, but to the practised
student the whole of the ground photographed became perfectly intelligible.
It is impossible to magnify the part air photography played m the war. Every
branch of the service was aided. Artillery targets were accurately pin-pointed
by photogiaphs. Observations of fire were made by photographs.
(3) Ground Observers. —All infantry, artillery and cavalry units had
trained observers who manned favourable observation posts day and night.
Every sign of enemy activity, even a man crossing a field five miles distant,
or a chimney smoking ten miles away, was logged, positions being carefully
noted with the aid of oriented maps, artillery boards and special optical in-
struments. .
Any activity worthy of immediate attention was telephoned back to
Headquarters at once, while observations of no immediate importance were
collected and forwarded to Headquarters at the close of each day. There
the events were studied with reference to maps, aerial photographs and
previous reports of activity, and were logged, mapped and filed. By this
means alone the staffs of higher functions were enabled to establish standards
and thus to detect any abnormal activity immediately it occurred.
(4) Prisoners.—Every division had at least one Intelligence officer with
a fluent knowledge of German on its staff, and here it was that the enemy
prisoner received his first official interrogation. In most cases the 1.0. knew as
much about the prisoner’s unit and his officers and the enemy’s intentions as he
himself did, and it was sometimes amusing to see reticent prisoners becoming
more and more bewildered as the conversation progressed, until at last they
consented to tell everything they knew, being convinced that it was already
known. Some prisoners, especially officers, refused, when interrogated, to
answer any questions of a military nature. They suffered nothing by this
reticence, nor did it, in many cases, avail them anything, for in the prisonersj
cages or compounds further behind the line a system of stool-pigeoning
was utilized. With every batch of prisoners in the cage would be included
an Englishman speaking German like a native dressed in German uniform
and knowing all the details of the regiment whose insignia he was wearing.
This man’s object was to strike up friendships with the occupants of the cage,
and thus obtain information through confidential conversation. Many a proud
German officer who managed to hold his tongue during official interrogation


unwittingly gave away important information by confiding in his very charm-
ing companion officer, who was such an interesting conversationalist and
such an obvious lover of the Fatherland.
“Stool-pigeons” were also used in the hospitals where wounded Germans
were treated. These “stool-pigeons” were bandaged up in a most realistic
manner, and, being placed in beds between prisoners of war, were able to
carry on confidential conversations with wounded Germans, thereby often gain-
ing valuable information. The value of the dictagraph also was not despised.
The identification of the units of prisoners of war was always a matter
of the first concern. When prisoners were taken, the first thing done was to
wire the identification back to Headquarters by priority wire. I think the
record time for an identification message back to Army Headquarters is some-
thing under five minutes from zero hour.
(5) Documents. —After every engagement Divisional Headquarters used
to receive limber loads of captured documents, which included every variety
of correspondence from the love letter of the latest joined recruit to an
enemy army order. These were carefully read through and translated. Items
of importance or interest were logged and distributed.
There were many dramatic cases in the war when the muddy torn scrap
of paper found in the trench or dug-out and forwarded with speed to higher
authority was the means of a minor easy victory for our arms or a bloody
repulse to the enemy.
The ultimate success of a certain Australian Brigade, after two failures
in a little action on the Somme in the winter 1916, was due to such a find.
Doubtless the enemy also was able to bring off some little coup of a like
nature.
Some documents were valuable from a military point of view, some re-
vealed domestic tragedy, some suggested the passage of comedy, some gave
us valuable detailed information, some merely suggested the frailty of
human effort and wisdom, but all were interesting. Some of the most inter-
esting, though least valuable from a military standpoint, were effusions from
the German supreme command to the soldiers of the Fatherland, exhorting
them to nobler deeds and sublimer exhibitions of courage, and always insist-
ing on the fact that the German arms must triumph. These statements were
intensely amusing to those who knew the other side of the picture.
Here is an extract from one of them, written by Ludendorf on the 4th
August, 1918, and distributed to the German soldiery on the following day.
After accounting for the success of the French attack between the Marne
and the Vesle on the 18th July, 1918, and dismissing it as merely a local
tactical success, he goes on to state —“The French and British Infantry
generally fought with caution; the Americans attacked more boldly, but with
less skill. It is to the tanks that the enemy owes his success of the first day.
Those, however, would not have been formidable if the infantry had not
allowed itself to be surprised, and if the artillery had been sufficiently distri-
buted in depth. At the present moment we occupy everywhere positions which
have been very strongly fortified, and we have, I am convinced, effected a
judicious organisation in depth of the infantry and artillery. Henceforward
we can await every hostile attack with the greatest confidence. As I have
already explained, we should wish for nothing better than to see the enemy
14


launch an offensive, which can but hasten the disintegration of his forces.”
This was on the 4th August. On the Bth August, four days later, the Aus-
tralians and other troops attacked in front of Amiens, and did not cease
attacking and advancing until the Armistice —an effective comment on the
vainglorious words of Ludendorf.
(6) Listening and Wireless Sets.— The enemy was the first to develop
listening apparatus which was able to pick up telephone messages. We
adopted and developed the idea. As a result the telephone was eventually not
used at all as a medium for important messages in the vicinity of the front
lines except for messages of a very urgent nature.
Even coded messages were forbidden, for it was found possible to decode
within two or three days almost any coded message. We used a 8.A.8. code
—a very intricate code for telegraph work, but even the key of this had to be
changed throughout the army every two or three weeks, for the enemy always
managed to obtain knowledge of the key within a few weeks of its use.
As the enemy adopted similar precautionary measures, important infor-
mation from this source was scanty. However, the listening devices w f ere
exceedingly useful on occasion, at this incident will show.
It was after an enemy offensive, and we were not quite sure whether the
enemy had finished attacking or whether he was merely preparing for another
attack in a day or two.
At this stage, one of our listening sets picked up a telephone conversa-
tion between a German Company Commander and one of his Platoon Com-
manders. All the conversation was harmless, except one sentence, wherein
the Company Commander enquired after the welfare of the horses of his
subordinate’s command.
Now infantry soldiers don’t have horses, therefore the enemy holding the
line at this point must have been dismounted cavalry. The enemy doesn’t
put dismounted cavalry in the line when his intentions are offensive —he puts
cavalry in the line to hold positions, thus freeing infantry for offensive action
elsewhere.
Therefore, it was deduced that the German offensive at this point had
finished. Our plans were accordingly modified, and subsequent events proved
this deduction to have been correct.
Wireless played a big part in the war, but it was not till late that Intelli-
gence seriously attempted a location and classification of the station calls of
the enemy wireless system. Classification schemes were worked out, and
the enemy stations grouped accordingly. The whole of this work was of a
highly technical nature, and the results were of the greatest importance. This
knowledge of the organisation of the enemy’s wireless communications was
zealously guarded by us, in order that the en&my might not learn the amount
of information he was giving away, and thus deprive us of a profitable source
of intelligence.
He endeavoured to camouflage all his other preparations for attack, but
though he certainly took the precaution of limiting the use of his wireless sets
during preparation, he made no other effort to camouflage the system, which
was fortunate for us.
Thus very briefly has been outlined the general sources from which I.G.
obtained its mountains of material. The information once obtained had to


be sorted, related to other information, logged, mapped and distributed to
everyone concerned.
But Intelligence had another function—one which has been incidentally
touched on at the beginning of this article —the function of reading the signs
of the times and correctly interpreting them. And this function Intelligence
carried out with excellent success. This duty, however, was the most com-
plicated and difficult of all, for though it might be easy to collect informa-
tion and interpret it, it was much more difficult to read the ultimate object
of the enemy Supreme Command, knowing that he might concentrate troops
at one point, strengthen communications, enlarge existing dumps, and estab-
lish new ones with the sole object of misleading us and striking elsewhere.
This was done in the early part of 1918. Our troops in Belgium during the
latter part of the winter were kept standing to arms for about 3 months be-
cause of enemy concentrations in that sector and other indications of attack.
The French in the extreme south were also kept on the qui vive by similar
indications. The enemy uent to considerable pains in this sector, by obvious
movements of men and transport too and fro, to impress the French with his
preparation for attack. The attack came on the 21st March, 1918, astride
the Somme, with subsidiary attacks later both north and south of this point.
But for this element of fallibility on the part of our Intelligence and the
enemy’s, doubtless the war would have been won by the last man in Europe
left standing.
At Sea.
BY K.H.B.
IT was interesting to watch the sentry on the fo’c’s’le. He staggered weakly
to a capstan, and leaned heavily against it; his rifle crashed unheeded on
the deck. It was the first night out from Melbourne, and he was im-
pressed with the responsibility attaching to a guard on active service. But
the sentry was under compulsion of a force stronger than the most terrible of
Sergeant-Majors. There was a heavy beam sea running in the Straits, and
his soul was disturbed mightly within him.
Twenty-four hours ago they had sung “God Save Our Splendid Men” in
the church, and the Great Adventure appeared in rosy tints. To-morrow, he
had thought, he would be free of that haunting question, “When' are you
going away?” And now, he was away—but he was very unhappy. There
didn’t seem much glory in it after all. Romance and seasickness are and
always will be incompatible. It was very interesting to watch that sentry
on the fo’c’s’le.
Three days later, when most of the troops had got their sea legs and their
land appetite, and had learnt the way not to get in and out of a hammock,
things went merrily. The big Bight swells rolled on endlessly, making any
u A


promenading hazardous; meal-times were especially eventful. But woe to
the inexperienced mess-orderly. Some luckless youth would appear at the
top of the companion ladder with a dish of porridge under one arm, and a
bucket of tea in the other hand. 1 hree steps down the boat would begin to
roll over. So would the mess-orderly. He would pick himself up at the
foot of the ladder; he couldn’t pick up the breakfast. The table next door
would see the joke, but his own wouldn’t, and for several minutes he would
receive useful advice.
But even when the dangerous passage from the galley had been negoti-
ated, the fun was by no means over. Ihe corporal’s tea would gallop down
the table till it collided violently with Johnson’s stew, unloading itself in the
middle by way of gravy, and then Johnson would have to be pacified. Or
perhaps, at dinner, a plate of pudding suddenly slipped from its moorings,
and entered in the scuppers, followed by a comprehensive curse. The mess-
orderly, whose dinner was not yet served, would see most of that game.
In the Indian Ocean, as the line approached, it grew calmer, and warmer
every day, and one garment after another was relegated to the kit-bag.
Life settled down into an easy routine. The sergeant lectured on gun-laying
to a group of recumbent figures, with the prospects of leave in Colombo as a
text; some energetic maniac skipped ceaselessly; the bells marked the long
hot hours. Men grew restive, and grumbled at trifles.
To start with, there was the Provost-Sergeant. He never put anyone
in the guard-room, but he wandered round the boat continually, uttering
a never-ending cry, “Get orf that ’atch ! Get orf that atch. It was more
insistent than the clamour of “card or book” in Melbourne streets on race
days; it had ceased to be amusing, and only irritated. The Provost-Sergeant
was not popular. Very few oliicials who do their job in the army ever are.
Then there was the daily inspection, which, like text-books, was a neces-
sary evil. The trumpeter strutted along in advance, vigorously calling the
crowd to attention, secure in the immediate presence of the ’eads. (It was
the trumpeter’s triumph, and he made the most of it. He always blew'
“reveille” at grave and imminent risk of a long swim.) In his wake fol-
lowed the triumphal throng, including everybody on duty, from the Colonel
to the Corporal, each peering around like the villain in the melodrama. While
yet a great way off, the Commander espied a spent match lying in a corner.
The procession halted, and looked grieved. The skipper pointed It out to
the O.C. Troops, who seemed vexed, and indicated It to the 3rd officer. He
frowned, and told the Orderly Officer; the Orderly Officer passed It on to the
Sergeant-Major. Finally, the Orderly Corporal sent a fatigue party to re-
move the offending article, and the procession would move on. But when it
was rough, it was a glorious sight to see the un-nautical part of that line try-
ing strenuously to preserve its dignity!
The great outlet for pent-up energies came when King Neptune and his
Court accepted the homage and fealty of a selected few, on behalf of the Great
Untravelled. One after another the victims were ranged before the hairy
and foamy monarch, regardless of rank or age. Their hair was lubricated
with grease and soot; they were lathered with a putty-like mixture of flour
and water; they were shaved by a repulsive fiend, with a wooden razor as
big as a scythe. Then they were propelled into a canvas mess, that had been


clean. Afterwards, there was a nasty mess, which the A.S.C. cleaned up
with a bad grace. It was a ceremony that will stick in the memory like the
sooty grease in the hair of the unhappy.
For some days after leaving Ceylon, the ship was in the path of the mon-
soon. Portholes and hatches were closed day and night, and it was too
rough to sleep on deck. One youth tried it. He woke to find himself in
the scuppers, just in time to see his hammock in the trough of the last wave
but one. Viewed from the companion ladder, the troop-deck was a strange
sight. In between the forest of swaying hammocks were visible the sweat-
ing, tense faces of those who sat at the mess-tables, trying to find some news
to evade a vigilant censor, or calculating whether crown and anchor was as
profitable as it was cracked up to be. Clustered like swarming bees round
one hatch, boxing enthusiasts expressed an unlovely opinion about the reteree.
On another hatch, a group at the piano shouted ecstatically the chorus of “If
you were the only girl in the world.’’ There had obviously—very obviously—
been pickles for tea, and their pungent odour, mingled with forbidden tobacco
smoke, still burdened the hot, clinging air. Truly, if Dante had ever been
on a troopship on a tropical night, he would have revised his conception pf
the Inferno.
And yet, there were many compensations. There were lazy hours of
dreaming; there were the cloudless tropic nights, when the boat rocked gently,
like a cradle swinging to rest. There were the burning stars, and the
phosphorescent constellations that leaped and blazed in the dark, restless
ocean, falling away from the bows in a brilliant cascade, leaving a starry
wake. The hiss and rush of the sea as the vessel passed became a part of
the subconscious self, as did the steady patient throbbing of the screw. There
were the glories of the equatorial sunset, and the splendours that came with
the dawn. So now, with the menace of exams, drawing closer, when the
brain reels before the mournful and ever-increasing pile of untouched notes, it
is hard to recall without regret all that it meant when you headed your letter
“At Sea.”
The Dover Patrol.
BY E. O. HERCUS.
THERE have in the past been few links between the Navy and the Univer-
sities of the Empire. Except for the doctor and the naval instructor,
who enters the service as a university graduate, the R.N. officer re-
ceives his highly-specialised training at one of the naval colleges, which he
enters at an early age, missing the opportunity of both public school and
university. Since the war something has been done to bridge the gap. Four
hundred naval officers have attended special courses at the University of Cam-
bridge, and have taken their part in the university life, giving to it and receiv-
ing from it something of value.


The R.N.V.R., which before the war was little more than a name, devel-
oped into an important branch of the service; and while it comprised princi-
pally men who were chosen solely for their knowledge of the sea, it
included in its numbers, both as othcers and as ratings, not a lew men of
university training, especially in the signalling Branch and on scientific work.
With the development of special apparatus came a demand for men of tech-
nical training, and many, who “did not know one end of a ship from the
other,” were able to carry out useful work and relieve the pressure on the
officers of the R.N.
It was the privilege of the writer to be associated with the Dover Patrol
for two years, and to see something of the important work which it carried
out. It is known popularly for the blocking of Zeebrugge and Ostend
last year, but too little has been heard of its other normal work, which, apart
from these two raids, would have earned for it no mean place in the story
of the war. Among the most important activities were constant offensive
work against the Belgian Coast batteries and submarine bases, the protection
of the many transports and hospital ships that crossed from Dover and
Folkestone, and the holding against the submarine of the narrowest part of
the straits, the Folkestone-Grisnez line. It was not work for the battleship
or cruiser. The big guns for the bombardment of the coast were carried by
the shallow draught monitor—the largest appropriately-named Erebus and
Terror. A few “flotilla leaders” headed the list of the destroyer flotilla, but
Dover was remarkable for the number of small craft, each type with its own
purpose and its own distinct organisation—paddle-steamers and trawlers for
mine sweeping, motor launches, manned by the R.N.V.R., many of whom
were from the Dominions, and the small “coastal motor boat,” which had the
speed of an express train.
In the bombardments of the Belgian Coast towns the motor-launch had
the dangerous task of providing the smoke screen behind which the monitors
fired. This they did so efficiently that on one occasion the Dutch papers stated
that the British bombardment had been carried out under cover of a dense
sea fog. The effectiveness of the smoke was largely due to the advice of one
former Australian professor, and another developed several important devices
for offensive and defensive work.
Destroyer officers had no light job, often doing double duty—escorting
troops by day, on patrol at night, with always the chance of meeting a hostile
force on one of its cut-and-run raids. Destroyer encounters were not uncom-
mon. Dover was lit up early one morning by star-shell; enemy destroyers
had entered the Straits, but the “Broke” and “Swift” accounted for two of
them, the former ramming its -victim and repelling a boarding attack with
revolvers and cutlasses. A division led by the “Botha,” South Africa’s gift
ship, had a similar success against destroyers attempting to bombard Dunkirk.
The enemy submarine found reason to consider the area unhealthy without
the blocking of their bases; their work was very considerably hampered by
the operations in the Patrol area, and it was no uncommon sight to see £*
little group of prisoners landed at Dover and driven off to the station. News
quickly spread in the town, and word went round that another submarine
had been accounted for, but there was never any demonstration, and the pri-
soners went through quietly to their destination.


But perhaps the most important task the Dover Patrol undertook was the
protection of transports and merchant traffic. With an area extending from the
North Foreland to Newhaven, many important cross-channel routes passed
through its waters, and all the merchant traffic through the Downs to the
I hames and East Coast ports, with the Belgian Coast enemy bases so close,
this was a great responsibility for the senior officers. So efficient were the
means taken that no ship crossing with troops to France was attacked by the
enemy or damaged as a result of enemy action.
Freiheitsüche.
BY A. G. GUTTERIDGE.
THE prisoner-of-war camp of Altdamm is situated at the base of the
Pomeranian Sea, seven miles S.E. of Stettin. When drawing up plans
of escape the first consideration was the direction to take. By means
of maps and by questioning we learnt that four ways were possible, North,
South, East and West.
Northwards 100 miles was the Baltic Sea, with the Danish island of Born-
holme 70 miles from the German coast. It was necessary to cross this in one
night, as an aeroplane patrolled this part every morning at daybreak. Des-
troyers and sentries on shore had also to be passed.
Westward 325 miles was Holland. Long stretches of moorland had to be
traversed north of Berlin with scarcity of water. Food would have to be
carried for 20 days. At the mouth of the Ems, near Holland, we would have
to cross several large swamps and canals. The border was guarded by
sentries, patrols, and dogs.
Southward 650 miles through Austria we could reach Switzerland. This
route is very mountainous, but lay mostly in the country of the Bohemians,
disaffected to the Germans.
Eastward 250 miles was the Russian front. This route led through vast
forests—mostly the hunting reservations of the Kaiser—and several large
rivers would have to be crossed. After that was the problem of crossing over
the German trenches.
We decided to try the Baltic route. By stinting ourselves we saved up
sufficient biscuits for 15 days, and bought some chocolate from the French.
W ater bottles we obtained from a German, as well as full-sized army maps, of
the whole district. Civilian clothes were unobtainable, but we managed to
buy a compass and files.
To get directly out of the camp seemed impossible, the whole area was
enclosed in a double fence of barbed wire, with sentries every 30 paces outside.
Electric lamps illuminated the whole. But every Saturday a party was sent
under guard to the dentist at the neighbouring village of Finkenwalde. We—


an Englishman, a Frenchman and myself—managed to get ourselves included
in the party. (Under our overcoats we wore vests, with the biscuits sewn
to the inside. This increased our bulk, but escaped notice.
At Finkenwalde we were marched into the dentist’s waiting room, but
slipped out while the sentry was not looking. Dodging round the house, we
crossed some open fields and took to the woods. As we entered them we
heard shouts behind, and saw several soldiers pursuing us. We doubled on
our tracks and hid in a thicket till nightfall without molestation.
Before we could turn northward we had to make a circuit of the camp,
clearly visible by its lights. At first we did not dare follow the railway, but
took to the woods and bye roads, but found these far too winding. The whole
of the country between Altdamm and the Baltic is covered with fine planta-
tions, with only a few scattered villages on the more fertile parts. We met
several people during the night, but they did not speak to us. We scent the
day in a thicket and escaped notice.
The next night was more lively, every village keeps multitudes of dogs,
which set up a terrible din on our approach, so that each made necessary
a detour and consequent loss of time. Fresh water was also hard to find.
Eventually we left the roads and took to the railway, where the going was
easier, though stations and road houses had to be circumnavigated.
That morning it commenced to snow, and we camped in a hay rick
just outside a village, as the warmest place we could find. The snow ceased
at midday, and in the afternoon some children playing in the hay stumbled
across us. With a yell, they ran for the village, which turned out en masse.
But we kept our start till we managed to hide in some woods.
The next night the Englishman had to drop out, as he was too weak to
proceed. The stagnant water we had been forced to drink had rendered him
feverish. He was picked up by the local policeman. Still following the
railway, we passed through Kammin, on the Baltic, and turned eastward.
On the fourth night we arrived at a place named Hatt, directly opposite the
island of Bornholme, and proceeded to scout. Several sailing boats were
noticed on the shore, but without sails or masts, and each was securely locked
to a line running to a stout tree. Sentries patrolled the shore in pairs every
half hour.
The fifth night seemed propitious; the wind was off shore, and the sky
was dark. Sails, mast, and oars were found leaning against a farmhouse.
These we commandeered. After watching a patrol pass, we began to file the
lock. Hardly had we started when we were disturbed by a loud shout from
behind. Examining, we found ourselves surrounded, and had perforce to
give in. We learnt afterwards that we had been reported the night before,
and that they were expecting us that night. They treated us courteously, and
were given a square meal before being locked in the coast guards’ barracks
for the rest of the night. Next day we were returned to Altdamm, where we
were rewarded with three weeks’ confinement.
Our next attempt was towards Holland. In order to be sent some part
of our way we—two Englishmen and myself this time—volunteered to work at
a village named Locknitz, 70 miles from Stettin. To allay the suspicions of
the guard we worked hard for three weeks in the fields—l 2 hours a day.
One Sunday we had the food we had collected in the yard behind a pile of


boxes, and after roll call that night managed to slip away and secrete our-
selves there too. At first the sentry on duty was very viligant, but the second
relief went to sit by the fire in the kitchen. Noiselessly we slid through the
barbed wire and crawled through a potato field until we were out of hearing.
Keeping away from the village, we turned westward and followed the main
road. A party of soldiers returning from the next village startled us, but we
ran the fastest. As we were expecting to be tracked with dogs, we waded
through a swamp, and we learnt later that this was effective, as the dogs
only followed us this far.
Nothing very exciting happened the first four days. We were forced to
pass through several towns at night time to avoid the rivers and canals, but
were not noticed. We followed the railways principally, covering 20 miles
each night, and lying hidden in the woods each day. Water was plentiful,
and the fruit in season. This country is more cultivated, and more thickly
populated than in the north; but the dogs seemed less lively.
The fifth night had been wet and and drizzly, and by morning we were
damp and cold. Leaving the railway, we entered a wood and lit a small fire
in a thicket just as the day was breaking. Before the water could boil a man
appeared with a revolver conspicuously displayed. He demanded who we
were, and evidently our accent betrayed us when we essayed some excuse.
He ordered us to follow him, but we refused to budge until we had had t>ur
tea. At first he stormed, but eventually calmed down and chatted with us
about the war, and accepted a mug of tea.
He marched us round the thicket in which we had lighted our fire, and
here we discovered a country house of fair dimensions, of which this man
seemed the caretaker. He locked us in the cellar and put his wife on guard
while he went to the village to summon help. With our knives we forced the
lock and bolted through the house before his wife finished wondering which
end of the revolver to shoot through. Jumping through a window, we saw
the whole village coming towards us. They started running on seeing us,
but wc escaped into a plantation and hid in a big tree all day. It was not by
any means a comfortable seat, and we did not dare go to sleep. We saw
several people pass beneath the tree as they searched for us, but they did
not observe us.
After dark we set out again, and found the plantation was picquetted.
We essayed to crawl through a cornfield, but were discovered in the brilliant
moonlight. We made a run for it, and, the sentry’s shots fortunately missing,
we got away again.
On the seventh night we were nearing Neu-Strelitz, in Mecklenburg.
This is a garrison town of fair size. This night, while searching for water, we
came on an unoccupied shanty near the railway, from which we commandeered
some bread, fruit, and coffee. We camped in the woods near by, but were
very thirsty, as we had not been able to find water that night. This at last
forced us to scout, and we were drawing water from a well in somebody’s
back yard when we were discovered. Although Ave again got away, the
owner rang up the barracks, where already a complaint had been lodged from
the first house we visited.
The whole regiment was turned out to search the woods, and although
we saw them coming and tried to evade them, we were at last surrounded.
15


Our hands were bound, but we were well treated, and the men joked with us
on our appearance.
The whole town was decorated in honour of the taking of Galicia, and
everyone was in the streets when we were marched through Neu-Strelitz—
the colonel and band met us and paraded us through the streets. Three of
us—dirty, unkempt and tired—in the centre of the regiments. One girl threw
us a rose, which a soldier picked up and put in my pocket.
We were locked in the barracks all night, and next day were returned
to Altdamm, greeted this time with a trip in the dark cells on bread and

BY F. W. EGGLESTON.
SALISBURY Plain was the habitat of the Australian Troops in England
for a very considerable period, and memories suggested by their stay
there should be included in any publication intended as a souvenir of
their war service. To most Australian soldiers it was a waste, bleak, and
muddy in winter, dusty and uncomfortable in summer. Life, far away from
the centres, was dreadfully monotonous, and it is no wonder that to adven-
turous spirits absence without leave was a necessity, a District Court Martial
a pleasant piece of excitement. And yet Salisbury Plain had interests which
would have appealed to a considerable proportion of the men. I left it with not
a few sighs of regret, and whenever I think of it agreeable memories crowd
into my mind. From the historical point of view, it is the most fascinating
area in Great Britain. The battleground of the pre-historic races, of the
Celts and Saxons, and later of the different Saxon Kingdoms, it has retained
on its surface more memorials of the past than almost any similar area in the
world. The Digger is not an historical student, but he does not lack imagina-
tion, and if this interest in his life had been cultivated a larger proportion of
men would have had pleasant recollections of their stay there.
The most wonderful feature of the Plain is its unchanged character.
You saw there a strip of country which had altered very, very little in the space
of 5000 years, and where each alteration could be traced by memorials of
some kind in the country side. If you take a parish plan of any district within
fifty miles of Melbourne and bring it up to date you will get a bewildering
series of divisions, sub-divisions and re-sub-divislons, so that the land as now
seen could not be recognised by anybody who saw it fifty years ago. But
on Salisbury Plain the boundaries of the holdings are substantially the same
as they were 200 years before the Conquest. The land marks on the Plain
are the land marks of a settlement of Saxons who obliterated the living rem-
nants of the previous civilisation and settled down to a farming existence on
what was then their Western border. But they did not obliterate all the marks


of the previous races. At Avebury we have the remains of a stone temple
which must have been used 3000 years before Christ; and Stonehenge,
situated just near Lark Hill Camp, was probably erected 2000 B.C. All over
the Plain you get ancient entrenchments showing that the methods of the late
war are as old as the human race itself. One of the most perfect is at Silbury
Hill, just behind Tidworth Camp. Here are the remains of an old British
village probably held at the time when the Saxons were over-running the
country, and the Britons had to maintain themselves in fortified camps on the
hill tops. It is a remarkable fact that the imaginative Celt invariably built
on the hill tops, while the creeping Saxons usually built right in the depth of
the valleys alongside water. Scattered over the Plain are the pre-historic
barrows, the burial mounds of the ancient Britons. Near Everleigh, about
three miles from Perham Down, there is a very large burial place which con-
tains over 30 barrows. Other primeval records on the Plain are provided
for by the old sunken roads which go from the old British camps on the
various hill-tops. Every now and then one comes across a straight stretch
of road contrasting strangely with the usual winding roads which, like an
aborigine’s nose, have no particular direction. These are the Roman roads
which centred at Old Sarum. One went north to Devizes, another west to
Exeter, along the ridge between Hurdcott and Sutton V eney, and another
east to Silchester, with a branch north to Marlborough running up the
great drive at Savernake. Ihe British climate favours the permanence of
these historical records. Ring Alfred is associated with Quarley, near
Perham, and had a favourite hunting lodge near Everleigh. This began the
long sporting tradition of the Plain. W hile Old Sarum was a Norman strong-
hold the field on the north, called the Tournament Mead, was one of the prin-
cipal jousting places for English chivalry. In a later age Everleigh Manor
was given by Queen Elizabeth to her chief falconer. In the early 19th Cen-
tury, Tidwmrth House was the seat of a great racing family, the Assheton-
Smiths. In a wood above lid worth house a great battle took place between
poachers and the gamekeepers, one keeper being killed and two poachers being
hanged ! At one time these woods were filled with mantraps and spring-guns,
a collection of which is now contained in Pitt Rivers Museum, near Cran-
bourne. At the present day the Plain is covered with horse-training establish-
ments. Amesbury, one of the sacred cities of the ancient Briton, was recently
the centre in England for the training of greyhounds.
In Saxon days the fields were split up into narrow strips allotted to dif-
ferent householders in the village, and the boundaries were marked by long
mounds which still exist. On the hill-sides the strips were cut out in terraces
called lyches, soil being carted so as to give a good depth to each terrace.
These are visible in many places, a particularly good one being visible at the
Overseas Training Brigade Camp at Longbridge, Deverill. The Saxon
settlement consisted of a few large walled and fortified towns and a series
of manors, round which a small village grew up. The Australian pastoral
holding supplies an interesting analogy to the manor scheme of settlement,
and probably arose out of similar conditions. In the series of trades and
occupations which are associated with a sheep or cattle station—those of the
overseer, bookkeeper, blacksmith, carpenter, storekeeper —you get the same
sort of thing as in the case of chamberlain, the bailiff, the ploughman, the hog-
-0 18a


keeper, the cowherd, and the bee-keeper of the Saxon manor. When William
the Conqueror conquered England he distributed these manors amongst his
soldiers or personal adherents in such a way that no land owner had a big
a gg r egation of property in one place. It is interesting to see in the Dooms-
day Book the list of tenants to whom manors were distributed by William the
Conqueror. Nigel the Physician, and Waleran the Chief Huntsman, are two
of the biggest beneficiaries in Wiltshire—Nigel having the manor which is now
Netheravon, and Waleran occupying the greater part of the valley of the
Wylye, near Sutton Veney. Ihe Norman Conquest led to the increased
importance of the larger towns which fringed the Plain, such as Warminster,
Devizes, Andover, Amesbury, and Westbury. These towns were held of the
King, subject to the obligation to provide the King and his suite with one
night’s entertainment every year. The country town at the time of the Con-
quest was Old Sarum, where a Norman castle and cathedral were built on
the site previously occupied by the Romans. It was on the top of a hill, and
was one of the strongest military positions in England. The monks of the
Chapter found it windy and bleak, and they also found the close proximity
of the soldiers in the castle somewhat disagreeable. They, therefore, dis-
mantled the old cathredral and re-built it on a low-lying situation on the
Avon. The choice of this marshy site betrays the tendency of the Saxon to
creep, but the exquisite tower looks like the aspiration of some Celtic soul
for the higher altitudes, hor a couple of centuries after the Conquest the
names of the great old Norman families—Bohun, Bruce, Hungerford, and
Manningford—ring through the history of Wiltshire. In the civil war of
Stephen, Ludgershall, near Perham Down, was occupied by Queen Maud, and
when she was taken prisoner at Winchester she escaped by being hid in a
cart underneath the washing; in this manner she was carried from Winchester
to Ludgershall, John of Gaunt held the old royal forest of Chute, near Tid-
worth, and the manor of Collingbourne Ducis, which was attached to the
forest. Charles 11., after Worcester—if the traditions are to be believed—
spent a considerable proportion of his time climbing oaks in Wiltshire and
other counties, and was concealed some time at Heale House, on the Avon,
just above Salisbury. While there he visited Stonehenge, and tried to count
the stones ne\cr getting the same result twice. Thomas Pitt occupied the
manor at Stralford-sub-Castle, and the church on the Salisbury road still
contains across the front “Thomas Pitt, Benefactor.” His famous son,
W illiam I itt n spent several of his early years in this house. Cranbourne
Manor House, about 15 miles south-east of Salisbury, is an ancient seat of
the Cecil family. It is an impressive type of medieval fortified residence,
and is full of the most wonderful wood carving. The later history of the Plain
does not provide any very notable names; During the 19th century it was
frequently said that the British Parliament was controlled by a group of
Wiltshire squires, but these men were of no greater eminence than the Hicks,
Beaches, and the W alter Longs. Literary associations abound. Addison
was born at Milston, near Durrington. Sir Roger de Coverley is said to have
been the Squire of Durrington in the days of Addison’s youth. We had some
lineal descendants of Addison in the A.1.F., and I often used to think that
Captain Lance Addison, A.P.M., at Warminster, was himself modelled on
Sir Roger de Coverley. Hazlitl wrote at Winterslow, and frequented the


Pheasant Inn on the main road to Andover, a few miles from Salisbury.
Sydney Smith lived at Netheravon, and complained that he only got butcher’s
meat once a week when the man called from Salisbury.
There are many exquisite impressions to be derived from the beauties
of the Plain if you once get over its forbidding aspect. The Chute district—
a series of villages carved out of the old royal forest with exquisite thatched
cottages —is one of the most beautiful corners in England. The road right
through the forest and over the Down at Conholt brings you to the highlands
of West Hampshire and the deep valley of the Hurstbourne, where Jane
Austen once lived. Ihe road down the Avon from Pewsey to Salisbury,
beloved of Cobbett, passes a series of beautiful villages, old manor houses
and medieval parish churches, which it would be difficult to match anywhere,
and a similar road down the valley of the Wylye from Sutton Veney to
Wilton brings you into touch with old houses, the foundation of which took
place before the Conquest. Magnificent seats of noble families can be seen
at Savernake (the Aylesburys), and at Longleat (the Earls of Bath). The seat
of the Herberts Earls of Pembroke is Wilton House. It is famous for its
associations with Shakespere. Shakespere played here, and Sir Phillip
Sidney, a relation of the family, wandered along the meadows. The original
Herbert was a shrewd-headed man, who profited from the dissolution of the
Monasteries. His successors of to-day were less hospitable to the Australians
than to the distinguished Elizabethans.
The drives across the Plain from Tidworth to the camps were bleak and
wearisome, but many weird impressions could be got, especially if you took
the more lonely tracks, such as the one through Tilshead and Imber. Imber
is one of the loneliest villages in England, as the couplet shows—“lmber on
the down, four miles from any town.” Appropriately enough, this road
through Tilshead is the scene of the Drummer Boy story from the Ingoldsby
Legends. Imber, like most of the other villages throughout the Plain, is
mentioned in the Doomsday Book. For ten or twelve centuries these villages
have remained approximately in the same condition as they now are.
The presence of the Australians on the Plain has added a new note to
its history, and yet I fancy not so exotic as we are apt to think. I fancy
that to the old roads and the quaint old inns the bands of swaggering, hcctor-
ing Diggers raised memories dead for centuries. These men were far more
representative than is the English villager of to-day of the yeomen and
yokels who created England. Indeed, with their burly figures, exuberant
animal spirits, keen minds, and lively wit and imagination, they carry us
right back to the bands which formed the retinue of the old Norman Lords
or to the hilarious “Commons” who in the time of great Elizabeth made
Mcrric England.


Padres.
(BY “O”)
PADRES are men ; padres can be men of many and grievous faults, but
they can also be men of most sterling character —and the majority of
them undoubtedly are. Those padres whom I came to know best were
men of such utterly different types that a short study of their characters
might be found of interest.
Our first padre I never saw at all. He had an enormous “parish”—the
whole of the heavy artillleiy of one corps —and, from what I learnt, rather
preferred visiting H.Q.’s than batteries in the line.
It was different with Padre Dallis—{we would give our types a name,
though of course a fictitious one). He was a conscientious worker, constantly
visiting his batteries and holding services. He was young and handsome, a
typical Cambridge “beau.” But he lacked the gift of power to deal with
men ; he never attempted to make himself known to the men ;
one formed the impression that he would have felt much more at home
at a mothers’ meeting than he did in an officers’ mess. He seemed without
any defined character of any sort. For a long time I considered that he must
be fresh from some “society” parish; consequently I was surprised one day
when I learnt that he had enlisted at the beginning of the war, and had
served in the ranks for some time —that, at all events, was an indication of a
strong character of some sort.
Our next padre let us call Padre Huxley. He always appeared to one
an ascetic of the sternest type, and of his self-denial and spiritual mode of
living one had not the slightest doubt. But he was so hopeless in his endea-
vours to promote acquaintanceship, so narrow-minded in his religion. More
than all else, he seemed to lack common human nature ; his cold, haughty
manner seemed to say “I am a priest of God, and therefore so much better
than you.” He gave excessive attention to the importance of public worship,
and regarded the amount of a man’s church-going as a standard of his charac-
ter. Those who attended his services he would condescend to talk to; those
who did not were irrevocably outside his fold. He entirely lacked the gift
of conversation, because he so absolutely lacked anything in common with the
average man. The services, too, which formerly had been eagerly at-
tended, became more and more an act of duty and nothing else; the voluntary
services were practically not attended at all. There was something “dead”
about the way in which Padre Huxley conducted the services, and his ad-
dresses were nothing but a series of clerical platitudes, less convincing than
usual, because delivered in a listless manner, which made one wonder if the
speaker were himself convinced of what he said.
But one padre more than compensated for the deficiencies of all the others.
Padre Tobias had an interesting history. By birth he was a Jew, but he had
been brought up a Christian. He had served in the ranks during the Boer
war, and had been ordained shortly afterwards. At the outbreak of the war
he enlisted as a stretcher-bearer, and after a long time working with a batta


lion in the line was ordered back to some C.C.S. to be an office clerk; this
work he heartily disliked, and he made several applications to be allowed to
return to the line, but was always refused. His C.O. happened to be a very
keen churchman, and, having learnt that he was a clergyman, on several
occasions requested him to conduct a service. This Tobias did ; but at last
l>e went to the C.O. and said to him, “You will not allow me to return to the
line; you ask me to do unofficial work as a padre: but I am not going to mix
the jobs up any more: so I shall ask you to forward my application to become
an army chaplain.”
Tobias was really as fine a man as one could ever meet; he was a Chris-
tian in the truest and deepest meaning of the term —entirely subordinating
the self for the great services of God and his fellow-men. He was so essen-
tially a man, and had a wonderful insight into the nature of other men. His
great aim was to help others, and to this end he worked all day and every
day by visiting the units in his parish. He always came along with a cheer-
ful, natural smile, and was equally ready to enter into some discussion or to
chat away on any frivolous topic. Nor did he make what was a too-common
mistake, that of chiefly visiting the officers’ mess; he constantly popped in to
some dugout and sat smoking and chatting with the men. He was, moreover,
an essentially brave man, and the fact that one of his batteries was being
shelled was a special reason for his going there. Needless to say, Tobias was
deeply loved and greatly respected by practically every man in the battery.
Also he conducted the services in a natural manner, which made them seem
something more than mere idle formulae, without at all slurring over their
solemnity or neglecting the more significant rites. He always asked the men
to choose their favourite hymns, and explained the meaning of any difficult
passages during the reading of the lessons. He reminded us that God is the
King of Kings, and therefore if we stood at attention for the National Anthem
should we not far more so do the same when reciting the Creed? His “talks,”
as he called them, were short and to the point, and one always went away
with at least one great thought to ponder over.
1 obias went the way of so many of the men who had loved and respected
h* im —to Blighty, maimed for life. But never will his name be forgotten by
those who knew him, never will the results of Ws ministry be effaced.
The Moving and Billeting of Croops in France.
BY J. D. R.
PERHAPS nothing would have struck a traveller in the war zone in France
and Belgium so forcibly as the fact that of the vast numbers of men,
horses and guns moving about every day and every night—by rail, by
bus and by road —-each unit had its own particular destination where it could,
as a rule, be sure of finding at least a temporary resting place. We say “as a
rule, because no system in those days of constant change could be abso


lutely perfect, and everyone will remember some nights spent in a fruitless
search for billets: and then to call all of those resting places “billets” was
indeed paying many of them a very high compliment.
The whole of this work was carried out by the Operations Branch of the
General Staff—the G. staff —in co-ordination with the Adjutant-General’s and
Quartermaster-General’s branches, the system being briefly as follows:
The M.G. branch were concerned only in the matter of supplies of food
and ammunition, and their arrangements consisted in the building up of an
adequate number of railheads and refilling points, from which a unit, no matter
where it might be, was within a reasonable distance of its supplies.
The division of the war zone into billeting areas was in the hands of the
A.G. staff. Roughly, if lines were drawn Westward from the extreme North
and South points of the British front line to the coast, the enclosed area was
the British responsibility.
From this certain General Headquarters areas were taken, and the re-
maining space divided more or less equally by East and West lines into army
Areas. The army areas were again sub-divided into corps areas, and the
latter into divisional areas.
Suppose that the British Expeditionary Force in France consisted of two
armies; each of these consisted of, say, three corps, two holding line sectors
and one in reserve in the army rest area, while each corps consisted of, say,
four divisions, two in the line and two in support and reserve in the corps
rear area.
Such an arrangement might exist during ordinary trench warfare; but
should an attack be projected by us, or expected from the enemy on any parti-
cular front, then an additional corps might be brought from an army on a
quiet front and extra divisions be placed at the disposal of the corps con-
cerned. , . .
The whole system of billeting was built upon the scheme of the division of
the whole of the B.E.F. area into divisional areas, for a division is the smallest
formation complete in all arms-—i.e., it is composed of the necessary percent-
ages of infantry, artillery, engineers, A.M.C., A.S.C., motor transport, etc.
Thus when the A.G. staff of an army had been allotted an army area, its
other retained a certain back area as an army rest area, and divided the re-
maining country into corps sectors. The corps A.G. staff retained its corps
rest area, and divided its front into as many sectors as the G. staff vyished to
have divisions holding the line. The divisions in their turn sub-divided into
brigade sectors, and brigades into battalion sectors.
Every Army and Corps rest area was divided into smaller areas, each of
which would hold a composite division (say, 15,000-20,000 men). Each
of these areas was in charge of an Area Commandant, who resided in some
central village in the area. At least, officially he did, but usually he was to be
found in the most congenial spot where he could promote ‘Tentente
cordiale!” , ,
Under the Area Commandant there were Sub-Area Commandants, each ot
whom governed a billeting area sufficient to take a brigade or its equivalent
(about 4,000 men). Then, in addition, in each village of any size there was
a Town Major, whose official duty was to keep a complete list of the available


accommodation in that village, but who could also generally be relied upon to
give very useful information concerning the “geography.”
Thus the whole of the B.E.F. area was divided into divisional areas or
sectors, most of which were occupied, but some were reserved as staging
areas. Maps were produced from time to time by the Army and Corps topo-
graphical sections, showing these areas and giving the locations of the Area
Commandants.
At any particular moment certain divisions or, perhaps, a Corps (not
often the Australian) would be found back near the coast in the G.H.Q. rest
area; other divisions would be “at rest” or training in the Army and Corps
Rest areas. Further up were divisions in reserve and in close support; finally
there were the line divisions.
The actual moving of troops was then carried out under the orders of the
Operations Branch of the General Staff —the G. staff. Suppose, for example,
it was wished to move a Division up from G.H.Q. reserve to the front line
to help in an attack, or to take over some new front, or perhaps only to relieve
a front line Division. The move may take place by train, by ’bus, or by a
march route. The G.S, of the Army on whose front it is to come find from
their A.G. staff what Divisional area is available and then send to the Division
their order to move. Copies of this order are sent to the Area Commandant
concerned, the Corps to which the Division is to be allotted, the Q.M.G. staff
for supply arrangements, to any formations through whose area the move
will take place, and also to G.H.Q. to keep them posted as to the position of
the Division. It is then the duty of the Corps G.S. to carry out in an exactly
similar manner the next move forward, and later of one of the line Divisions
to order the move into the line.
Before each move the Division itself sends forward billeting parties, prob-
ably by ’bus, to report to the Area Commandant of the area to which they are
moving. He allots the billets, and so when the units arrive they are met by
their own billeting parties and conducted to their billets.
From this brief explanation it would appear rather a simple matter to
move a Division, but to go into the many difficulties of the move would re-
quire considerable space. It must be remembered that many Divisions are
on the move at once, and roads must be so allotted that time is not wasted by
unnecessary delays ; also, if trains or ’buses are used to take troops forward, by
careful arrangement they could also be used to take troops back. In addition,
as we get near the forward area, much has to be done by night in order that
enemy aeroplanes may not observe any concentration of troops. In fact,
towards the end of the war, no movement of any number of troops was per-
mitted by day within 20 miles of the front line; but immediately at dusk all
roads in the forward area became packed to their fullest capacity with moving
troops and vehicles, and very careful timing was necessary to avoid blocks,
which were a death trap in shelled sectors.
Movements by train, as stated above, required very careful reckoning,
which was complicated to some extent by the fact that all big moves had to
be co-ordinated with the French authorities.
A train, in military language, is a definite thing consisting of a fixed
number of carriages for personnel, horse boxes, and flat trucks for guns and
vehicles.
16


A distinction was drawn merely between a strategic train and a tactical
train. In the one men and fighting material alone were carried, and a move
could be made much more rapidly than was the case with the other, when, in
addition, extra kit and whatever “comforts” a unit might have could be taken
on board with it.
Artillery and tanks also complicated matters. They required special
roads, and although the tank was quite at home on any shell-torn country, he
required a bridge to cross even a small river, and a battalion of tanks took a
considerable time to cross such bridges as existed forward. Unless special care
was taken to cover them, the marks cut by the tractors of the tanks make
their course, and hence their position, visible to hostile aeroplanes, and after
each move they had to be very carefully camouflaged before dawn. In moving
them up to the jumping-off line prior to an attack at dawn the Flying Corps
had to be called in to render assistance. In order that the noise they mjade
would not warn the enemy of the approaching attack, arrangements had
always to be made for our aeroplanes to fly very low over the enemy lines and
thus drown the noise of the tanks with tHiat of their engines—a rather
“ticklish” job.
This article really just touches on what was one of the most complicated
of staff duties in the recent war, but it may give an idea of how some of the
difficulties of movement were overcome.
Our Australian Hospitals at the War.
BY J. W. SPRINGTHORPE, LT-COL.
Under the heading of Hospitals come—
1. Casualty Clearing Hospitals, each with a Lt.-Col., two Majors and four
Captains—to receive and treat patients from the field ambulances—but
during the war developing into small mobile general hospitals—scenes
of the greatest stress and urgency, mostly surgical.
2. Stationary Hospitals, similarly staffed, further back, fixed, at first better
equipped, also developing into small general hospitals.
3. General and Base Hospitals, further back, on the lines of communication,
out of the fighting area, each with three Lt.-Cols., six Majors, and
twelve Captains, full staff of nurses, personal equipment for treating
520 to 1040 patients in every respect in an up-to-date manner.
4. Auxiliary Hospitals, outgrowth of the General, at first for emergencies,
then for further treatment, up to the stage of boarding for Australia,
or return to service.
5. Convalescent Hospitals, for convalescent purposes.
6. Special Hospitals, for cases requiring special or separate treatment.
7. Hospital Ships, the floating hospitals, equipped with all the necessaries
for treating all classes of sick and wounded on their return to Aus-
tralia.


The first hospitals to leave Australia were the ist and and General, the ist
and and Stationary, and the ist Casualty Clearing, attached to the ist Austra-
lian Division. Their departure from Melbourne on December 4, 1914, on the
hospital ship “Kyarra,” with some 140 nurses, 1000 personnel and every-
thing, staff, food, etc., for three months’ work, is our medical “Mayflower”
incident. We were members of an organization that had previously existed
mainly on paper for defence only, and, though the pick of the available pro-
fession, were under the governance of regulations—not facts, and seniority,
not necessarily special fitness. Once in Egypt, we came under the R.A.M.C.,
where these disadvantages were at their maximum, and, through no fault of
our own, we were limited in our initiative, and circumscribed in our
activities, with the result that we did mnny things in a way that we
did not approve of, and left many more undone to an extent that we deplored.
This is no place for criticism—but the interests at stake are so great, and the
results were so often marred by dissatisfaction, that it seems to me imperative
at least to mention these underlying fundamental disabilities.
Our work began at once. Within the first three months we at Mena
had to deal with some 3300 patients, though our 20,000 troops were picked
men, in a world’s sanatorium. All concerned threw all their energies and skill
into the task. At the same time, we sought an investigation, obtained a
Board of Enquiry, and, in due course, after the usual delay, furnished a
Report, with recommendations for future guidance.
Gallipoli next furnished its shock and opportunity. The report of the
Dardanelles Commission, as well as our own, show how many, varied and
serious were the errors of omission, and the results, necessary perhaps at
limes, of following pre-war regulations, and sacrificing foresight to routine.
Here again, however, the work of innumerable individuals was beyond all
praise. Al Mudros the 2nd Stationary and the newly-arrived double 3rd
General, with their imperfect resources, worked wonders. On hospital ships
and transports, overcrowded with our wounded, surgeons and nurses
proved themselves invaluable. On land our motor ambulance saved
the situation, and in Cairo—for we never even in summer got away from its
heat and sand —the two general hospitals found beds, often unsatisfactory, it
is true, for all the patients that the authorities sent our way, and did the best
possible for them under the circumstances. Surgeons worked hard all the
time, and overtime, and physicians, showing equal skill and devotion, went
beyond mere treatment, and differentiated the different forms of typhoid,
dysentery, malaria, etc., in an up-to-date manner. Going further still, unoffi-
cially we fought hard and successfully for the better distribution of personal
comforts amongst the sick and wounded, for more suitable clothing than
pyjamas for those allowed out of hospital grounds, for ever wider provision
to meet recreational needs, for official curtailment of opportunities to vice
and drinking, for other foods than “bully” beef and biscuit, and for
invaluable but absent requirements, such as insecticide, mosquito netting,
etc., for our heroes in the trenches, of whom one in every two was sick.
Then came the miracle of the evacuation, with its easing of tlfe situation.
After a few months’ rest all but the Light Horse left Egypt for France, and
most of our hospitals naturally followed, leaving the 3rd General Hospital from
Mudros (replaced soon after by the 4th General from Australia) at Abbassia, in
16*


the same old heat and sand, to look after those left behind, and afterwards
to win fame for their great work in Palestine, whilst the hospitals did
splendid work in connection with malignant malaria, dysentery, Bilharzia,
septic sores, as well as the wounded in that great campaign. It was in the
midsummer of 1916 that I had, as a patient at Abbassia, personal experience
of what treatment, even the best, meant in such a place at such a time. 1 y
future, however, was in the West, where I followed our main hospital stieam.
By the middle of 1916 our Ist A.G.H. was established at Boulogne, and
our 2nd at Rouen, where they continued till the end of the war, with their
associated Casualty and Stationary units “somewhere in Prance. Later
on, the 3rd A.G.H., after a brief stay at Brighton, went over to Abbeville,
when the submarine menace became critical, and there they stayed, leaving
us —unlike all other Dominions —without any General Hospital in England.
In France our hospitals were more than fully occupied whenever attacks
were in progress, and one and all won a great name for the good work
which they did. But they seldom received Australian patients, even though
often, our men lay in a British hospital little more than a stone s throw away-
to the regret of our staffs, as much as to that of our own men. Over in
England British hospitals of all sorts, in all localities there were over
70 pages of the names only—received practically all our sick and wounded
from France, and here they remained for periods often averaging three
months, and frequently much longer. All concerned regretted, but it was
long before anything was done. And when a “move on clause was finally put
in operation, the stay of our own men in our own auxiliary hospitals, which,
with staffs for operative work, were now practically general hospitals, and al-
ways equal to the accomplishment of much good, became so short, that they
became known amongst the Diggers as “tube stations. It was in one of these
auxiliary hospitals, Dartford, that I spent my five years in England,
varied by special duty at the British, French, and Australian fronts. Being
in charge of the class of cases which I was most fitted to treat—-the nerve
and cardiac cases—and at a fine hospital, well equipped and organized, I felt
that the aim of my service was largely attained. Like the rest, we were
always full, had some 1200 in at a time, and, latterly, discharged some 600
a week. From us, as from Harefield, patients would go to Weymouth, if
boarded for Australia, or to one or other of the Command Depots, if con-
sidered equal to duty after a certain amount of further treatment.
To some extent the Auxiliary Hospitals, Weymouth, and the Command
Depots thus acted as Convalescent Hospitals. In Egypt we had had four
Convalescent Hospitals—Helwan, Mena (at the later stage), Ras-el- 1 in, and
Montazah, of which the two former proved quite unsuitable in the heat of
summer. As regards special hospitals, these were not nearly so thoroughly
provided as amongst the other Dominions. Still we had special provision
for venereal and infectious cases, Southall Auxiliary Hospital was largely
reserved for the limbless, face cases went to Sidcup, and mental cases to
special British hospitals, whilst at Dartford, at any rate, we had special
wards for “soldiers’ heart,” shell shock, and other war neuroses.
After leaving Egypt, our officers, different again from other Dominions,
had hospital treatment to themselves, mainly in a British hospital at Wands-
worth, much to their own regret, as well as ours, though under a staff with a


great reputation. For convalescents they went to Cobham Hall, where they
retain the pleasantest of recollections of the way in which Lord Darnley and
his Victorian Countess made them feel quite at home.
Finally, as regards Hospital Ships, we had one at Gallipoli, the “Gascon,”
in common with other troops, and subsequently two between Australia and
England, the “Karoola,” and the “Kanowna,” specially fitted-out,
thoroughly-equipped, and well-staffed, and on them returning bad cases re-
ceived ail the attention of a general hospital.
In practice, of course, this hospital treatment of our sick and wounded
cannot be dissociated from the antecedent treatment in or near the firing line
by regimental medical officers, and field ambulances, and the subsequent
hospital and other treatment provided throughout Australia for those who re-
turned disabled. When we call to mind our casualty list of some 60,000
dead, and some 200,000 sick and wounded, even tffe onlooker can form some
idea of the magnitude of the task thus set the Australian medical profession.
Taken in its totality, and all the circumstances remembered, the record shows
a volume and variety of good, even brilliant work, worthy of our men
and our country. Amidst all the strain and hardship, it mlay be safely said
that our hospitals, with all that they had perforce to endure and leave undone,
proved themselves to many to be veritable oases in interminable deserts,
islands of peace and safety in oceans of inconsiderateness and desolation,
havens of retreat for restoration and salvation. With the personal touch, of
common service, in a comradeship otherwise undreamt of, at the greatest crisis
in our history, bound together in a tie that only death can break, remain the
memories and experiences of the tireless efforts of the staffs, the endless de-
votion of the nurses, and the sunny gratitude of the “Digger,” to whom
was all so freely given, and who was worth it all.
The Regimental Medical Officer.
The life of a medical officer at the front was described by one of them
as “a life of extreme boredom relieved at frequent intervals by periods of
intense hellishness.” This expresses only part of the truth—except perhaps
the second half of the description—or rather describes just two aspects of life
in the front line. The hellish times correspond to the attacks made by either
side and the boresome intervals to the periods between these attacks. In 1916
these intervals were long, but as the war progressed our munitions ac-
cumulated and our organisation developed, and they became shorter and
shorter, and correspondingly more and more gratefully accepted when they
did come. Often towards the end of the war these breaking spaces were
all too brief.
A great difficulty in the organisation of the medical service at the front
is due to the fact that during active operations, no matter how many medical


officers there are on the sector engaged, there are not enough to do the
work; and that during inactive operations, no matter how few you have,
they are more than sufficient to carry out the necessary duties, hor this
reason medical officers were, during quiet periods, seconded from their units,
and detailed for duties that were not strictly medical. I hey were put in charge
ot divisional baths and laundries, and often the duties .of gas officer in tne
early days were performed by medical men. Ihe management of a divisional
baths and laundry required a good deal of work and organisation. About
seven or eight hundred soldiers were dealt with daily : each man received a
complete change of clothes, and his uniform was cleaned and sterilised by
ironing, and was ready for him by the time he had finished his hot bath. Ihe
clothes he left were washed, sterilised and mended. It generally fell to the
lot of a Field Ambulance to carry out this work, and it was reinforced by
thirty or forty women, recruited from the local inhabitants, who did the
washing and mending of the clothes. It speaks volumes for the adaptability
of medical men that they mastered the details connected with the provision
of darning wool, buttons, soap and soda, and the hundred and one olhei
articles necessary for the work of this very important institution.
The gas officer’s duties consisted in looking after all the protective mea-
sures against a gas attack. ihis involved a trequent inspection of gas masks,
sprays, gas-proof dug-outs, alarm signals, etc., in the whole of the front
are*a, and called for continual vigilance. He also was in command of a
“gas school,’’ which was part of each division’s organisation, and he was
expected to obtain samples of the enemy’s gas on every possible occasion, in
order to find out if a new variety was being used.
All these duties, each very important, were carried out by medical men.
They could be included, 1 suppose, under the term “Preventive Medicine.’’
It was during these comparatively quiet times, too, that the h ield Am-
bulances reorganised themselves, that reinforcements were trained, that
equipment was gone through and replenished after each engagement, and
that the whole unit was got ready to take its turn again in the forward area.
The medical work during these quiet periods consisted in nothing more
exciting than looking after a divisional rest station, which was merely a field
hospital, where men who were slightly ill were kept for a couple of weeks
rest and treatment.
But it was during periods of active operations that the medical officer
came into his own ; it was then that he lived most abundantly, and that he
realised that all the routine drudgery he had gone through in preparation was
worth while. As day after day and night after night attack succeeded bom-
bardment, and counter-attack followed attack without relaxation and without
a pause, and each took its toll in killed and wounded, the greatest powers of
endurance, the highest qualities of mind and character were brought out. Ihis
was the medical officer’s opportunity.
In the forward area the problem with which he was faced was to collect
the wounded in the shortest possible time, to render first aid treatment, to
take every means for the prevention of shock, and to get the men to the
Casualty Clearing Stations where the necessary operations could be performed
with the least possible delay. To do this was the work of the regimental
medical officers and the Field Ambulances.


During heavy fighting a division would sustain about six hundred to
eight hundred casualties a day in wounded alone, and these men had to be
brought back to the wagon rendezvous, where motor and horse ambulances
would convey them to the dressing stations. Many of these wounded men
could walk to where the wagons would pick them up, but there was always
a very large number who required to be carried, and the difficulty involved
in transporting these men can be realised in some degree when it is remem-
bered that carriage by hand had to be relied on almost entirely. In many
areas there were tramway lines, but these were being continually
destroyed by shell fire, and it was necessary to fall back on hand carriage,
This involved a carry of a mile or more, partly down a communicating trench
if such a thing existed, or across country torn up by shell fire, and, if the
weather had been bad, literally feet deep in mud. Further, this had to be
done under more or less heavy fire, but fortunately the Hun was a moderately
methodical beggar in his habits, and generally put down his barrage about
the same time each day, so that the worst of the shelling could as a rule be
avoided.
The actual carrying, of course, was done by the stretcher-bearers, but the
organisation of the collection of the wounded, and their evacuation, devolved
on the medical officers, whose duty it was to see that the bearers were dis-
tributed to the best advantage, that the routes taken were the least dangerous
and the best, that the wounded did not accumulate at any place, but were
steadily and systematically carried to the rear, and that the bearers were used
to the best advantage with a minimum of waste of man power.
The medical officers were stationed in dug-outs more or less shell-proof
—generally very much less—along the routes of evacuation. The regimental
M.O. always found himself right forward; his headquarters and aid post
was one of the few dug-outs not completely destroyed by shell-fire, which he
shared with several other officers, and perhaps part of the battalion adminis-
tration. Here he lived and moved and had his being while his battalion was
in action; he had to be available at every minute of the day and night, and
he was responsible for collecting all the wounded of his unit, and for sending
them to the rear. The conditions under which he worked baffled description ;
the battered trenches, the filth and the mud, the continual shelling and the
utter desolation must be experiencd to be realised, yet in the midst of all this
the regimental medical officer dressed the wounded, applied splints to broken
limbs, and got the men to the rear as opportunity offered. On him devolved
a great work and a great responsibility, and all who are in a position to know
agree that none carried out his duties with more complete unselfishness of
purpose, with greater heroism, or with more marked success.
Thje Field Ambulances then took over the charge of the wounded. The
headquarters of these units were, as a rule, several miles behind the front
line, in a place which was supposed to be immune from shell fire, but which
generally wasn’t, and here the dressing stations were formed. Being fairly
large places, they came in for their share of attacks from the air, which were
such an important feature of the later stages of the war. All the w'ounded
of the division passed through the Field Ambulances. Here the wounds were
dressed, urgent operations, such as those necessary to stop haemorrhage,
were performed, the wounded men were well fed —an item in the programme


which was most popular as a rule—and as soon as they were sufficiently
rested they were sent to the casualty clearing station for thorough surgical
treatment.
If work at a dressing station was performed under better conditions than
prevailed further forward, it was no less strenuous. The stream of ambulance
waggons was almost continuous; wounded men poured in at one gate, and
out of the other poured men who had been fed and rested, and whose wounds
had been attended to. The flow of wounded through the station never
ceased, and those who know anything of treating injured men, even in a
well-equipped hospital, can imagine the work involved in attending to several
hundred more or less badly wounded soldiers, exhausted, and covered with
mud and dirt of the battlefield. But this sort of thing went on day after day,
and only ceased when the division, or, rather, all that was left of it, was
brought out of the line to rest and reorganise, only that it might go in again.
One got used to the beastliness of this sort of thing, the horror of it
ceased to nauseate, and the insanity to appal; but what was ever new, and
what will remain as a lasting and priceless possession, was the splendid spirit
of comradeship which was found everywhere and under all circumstances. If
nothing else had been won in this war, that alone had made it worth while
to those who experienced it.
The A.A.M.C. in Sinai and Palestine.
(BY R.M.D.)
WHEN the infantry left Egypt for France, the medical units remaining
with the Light Horse were the ist, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Field
Ambulances, which had just returned from Gallipoli to their horses,
and the newly formed Anzac Sanitary Section. These, with a New Zealand
ambulance and the A.A.M.C. details with each regiment, comprised the medical
units of the Anzac Mounted Division. Early in 1917 the 4th L.H.F.A, and
Blh Sanitary Section were formed, and, with the 3rd L.H.F.A., became part
of the Imperial (later Australian) Mounted Division, which also had an
Imperial Ambulance. In June, 1917, the Camel Field Ambulance arrived
jfrom Australia, and was attached to the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade,
becoming the sth L.H.F.A. A year later, when the Australian portion of the
I.C.C. Brigade was changed into Light Horse, this involved exchanging the
ambulance camels for horses and vehicles. It was then attached to the Aus-
tralian Mounted Division.
Two small improvised units, the value of whose work was out of all pro-
portion to their size, completed the held units. The Anzac Field Laboratory
was formed to deal with the cholera contracted from the retreating Turks,
and carried out an extraordinary amount of work of great value for 2\ years;
like the Anzac Sanitary Section, it was partly composed of New Zealanders.


I he second was an operating unit formed just before the capture of Beersheba
to make early operation for the seriously wounded possible. Its main
feature was a large operating car, its personnel partly British, Australian and
New Zealand, and its performances of mobility remarkable. All of these
units were finally embodied in the Desert Mounted Corps, a cavalry forma-
tion of four divisions, two of which consisted of British Yeomanry and Indian
Cavalry, with combined ambulances of British and Indian personnel, with
which our ambulances frequently had to co-operate by taking each other’s
patients.
All of the medical units were organised and equipped to keep up with
the cavalry in their long and rapid movements. The personnel were mounted
on horses, donkeys, or riding camels, and light bamboo stretchers were
carried on their horses by the stretcher-bearers. Only the most essential equip-
ment could be carried, as owing to the line of supply passing through the
submarine-infested Mediterranean, ambulances never had sufficient transport
for their needs, and tents, firewood, water and rations for the patients w r ere
among the essentials. Shortage of transport and equipment were always a
handicap.
The climate and diseases peculiar to the country made the work of the
A.A.M.C. arduous, but there was always variety, and the presence of new
difficulties to be overcome was stimulating. The Sinai desert campaign lasted
from April, 1916, to March, 1917, and was carried through in deep, soft
sand, rising into series of steep dunes; scattered about were oases of date
palm trees called Hods, in which brackish water was generally found. Patients
were carried partly in two-wheeled vehicles, with broad tyres, called sand-
carts, intended to hold two patients, but known in emergencies to take
twelve; four or six horses were used in them. For the most severe cases
home-made sand sledges were used, and were tHe most comfortable form of
transport, but were uneconomical in horses. Ihe majority of wounded were
carried on camels in cacolets designed either for lying or sitting cases; all of
the former were bad until we captured some of those used by the Turks at
the Battle of Romani and copied them. Camel riding is always uncomfort-
able, and what a journey of 20 or 30 miles at a rate of 2- miles per hour under
a burning sun meant to a wounded man may be well imagined.
The advance across the desert was carried out by a series of bounds
made by the mounted troops to protect the growing railway. Operations
mainly consisted of raids, or “stunts,” as they were always called, against
enemy posts. Leaving camp towards evening, a silent and smokeless march
would be made through the featureless desert to surprise the enemy at dawn ;
sometimes two night marches were necessary, the intervening day being spent
in concealment. The men slept so far as the flies and Heat would allow.
After attacking the position, the ambulances, carrying back the wounded as
rapidly as possible to railhead, usually reached camp long after the light
horse. The “stunts” were frequent, and, carried out in mid summer in a
waterless country on a daily ration of half a gallon of water, were very
fatiguing; on one occasion a whole regiment, while returning, collapsed from
heat exhaustion.
Only once was serious opposition made to our advance, when the Turks
attacked the railhead at Romani; though much trekking before and after
17


the attack was done by ambulances, the wounded, in rather large numbers,
were handled with unusual ease on this occasion, as the railway was close.
Apart from Cholera, which was soon stamped out, though always a bogey,
the main sanitary measures concerned drinking water and flies, which were
in enormous numbers, and the cause of a good deal of dysentery. Flies
were only kept in check by rigorous sanitary rules and inspections, and
avoidance of the shady palm hods as camping grounds. These measures
did not earn popularity for the medical service. The wells found were always
salty, and rarely fit for drinking, but all had to be tested to determine their
potability, and to be protected from contamination ; almost all drinking water,
which was always chlorinated, came from the sweet water canal by the side
of the Suez Canal, at first in tanks, or “fantasees.” later by a pipe line, which
finally was carried beyond Gaza, thus fulfilling the prophecy that the Nile
would flow into Syria.
The early part of the campaign into Palestine, which included the first
two battles of Gaza, did not make a great difference to the medical services,
except that fine dust replaced sand, while the country, though roadless, was
firmer. A great outbreak of septic sores occurred, which was uncontrollable
till oranges and vegetables were reached near Jaffa, and prevention of mos-
quito breeding as an antimalarial measure was first begun. More casualties
were dealt with in this period than in any other.
After the fall of Beersheba and Gaza the whole medical situation
changed with the ability to utilise ambulance waggons, the addition of motor
ambulances, and the use of motor lorries for slight cases; water became
plentiful, the effects of cold and wet had to be dealt with, and mosquito
destruction largely replaced that of flies. The distances covered were greater,
and from Jaffa patients at one time had to be carried 60 miles to the nearest
casualty clearing station over rough roads.
Experience was then gained of dealing with casualties in the steep stone
covered Judean hills, where only camels, which fall down in slippery mud,
could be used to carry wounded. In 1918, after the capture of Jerusalem
and Jericho, medical units took part in the two attacks on Amman, in the
Hauran; both failed, though the town of Es Salt was taken on each occasion.
In the first, heavy rain and severe cold in the hills of Moab made the return
of the wounded over 60 miles to Jerusalem, with ,a pursuing enemy,
a difficult task. The second attack was remarkable for the extremely
steep and rough hills on which it was found possible for camels loaded with
wounded to move. In both attacks some of the A.A.M.C. were captured.
During the summer of 1918, passed in the pestilential valley of the Jordan,
where fogs of dust and burning heat were ever present, a vast amount ol?
antimalarial work was carried out, and it was a matter of surprise that this
qnabled troops to remain in the valley at 'all; that this work was effective
was proved by the experience of the Anzac Division at the beginning of the
final offensive. Iwo nights spent in that part of the valley previously held
by the Turks, who had carried out no antimalarial work, resulted in a loss to
the division of over 75 per cent, of its strength from malaria in a few weeks.
This work, with the large numbers of sick to be treated, and the trying
climatic conditions, threw a heavy strain on the medical service, which left
it in poor condition to deal with all the patients from the time of the final


advance. This advance was very rapid and long, and when the worn-out
Australian Division reached Damascus an epidemic of influenza was encoun-
tered at the same time as the malignant malaria contracted on the way made
its appearance. At first evacuation to the nearest casualty clearing station
(which was 150 miles distant, with parts of the road almost impassable for
cars) was impracticable; later the distance was reduced to 90 miles to a
railhead, and, when Beerut was occupied, to 70. At the same time there was
a shortage of invalid food and hospital equipment of all kinds ; the majority
of the medical personnel was ill, and great numbers of sick prisoners, who
were literally dying in hundreds a day, had to be cared for as far as possible.
The Anzac Division in the hills east of the Jordan was having a similar experi-
ence. Such is a brief account of the doings of the A.A.M.C in the field with
the Egyptian Expeditionary force, and though its duties were not easy, no
member of it can help being proud and glad to have belonged to it.
The A.I.F. Education Service.
BY BRIGADIER-GENERAL LONG.
WITHIN all tha British armies serving on the Western Front there
came into being, as the long war dragged on, groups of men banded
together to co-operate in maintaining and extending their voca-
tional and general knowledge. In part the impulse came from sheer boredom,
in part it came from mental energies reasserting their vigour after long
inaction; in part it came from a desire to be fit for the tasks of peace when
war should be no more. No one began in the first place by thinking out a
great scheme for educating the armies on service.
This sporadic growth here and there of educational organisms began to
attract attention and sympathy from discerning minds. Plans to aid, develop
and correlate these growths were improvised by a few enthusiasts in an
unofficial way, and finally the idea came to birth of creating a comprehensive
official and authoritative organisation to include the needs of all the men on
service.
The two men in the A.I.F. who first gave thought on a big scale to this
full development were General Sir Brudenell White and Mr. C. E. W, Bean.
I arrived in France just at the time when they had become seized of the idea
and had enlisted the cordial support of Sir William Birdwood. I was sent
for and asked to draw up a report upon the somewhat nebulous ideas that
were then in our minds. My report was adopted as a basis, and I presently
found myself appointed Director of Education, A.1.F., which was a title
with a fine sound, not betraying the desolating fact that I was the whole
Education Department in myself.
It would be much too long a story to attempt to tell how that Education
Service grew in the course of the following months from one lone individual
17a


until it became the largest department in the whole A.I.F. during the process
of demobilisation.
In the first days I associated with myself Major H. Thomson, of Adelaide
and Oxford Universities, and Captain W. Mulholland, of Sydney University,
as Deputy and Assistant Director respectively.
We laid out our aims in two main divisions—Vocational and Inspira-
tional Education. Our methods were also to be broadly twofold —Internal
and External Education.
Let me explain briefly what we meant by these terms. Our duty was
to help to refit the fighting man for his return to civil life and to make good
as far as possible the wastage of the years spent at war. First we would
approach him on the economic and utilitarian side. What could we do to
help him in his civil vocation? He might be Jackeroo, “bottle-oh,” wharf-
labourer, medical practitioner, engineer, or anything else; but the only thing
that counted was that hie was a soldier, and as a soldier each w'as to count
for one and none for more than one. The Education Service must be as broad
as the army to meet the civil and economic needs of any and every soldier
so far as facilities could be provided.
On the second string our aim was to overcome war weariness and listless-
ness by the provision of libraries with all considerable units, to arouse interests
in the big problems of life, to stimulate among men a proper concern for the
future of their country by means of specially selected lecturers, by study
groups, debating societies, reading circles and similar agendies.
This was our civic or inspirational education.
Then the methods we planned for accomplishing our great task were
first “internal,” i.e.—meet the man while he remained with the army and
provide him there with the desired teaching from the internal resources of
the army.
Our second method was “external,” i.e.—to devise a scheme whereby
soldiers might be withdrawn from army life in considerable numbers during
demobilisation and “farmed out” for given periods to universities, schools,
workshops, farms, and the like.
In broadest outline these were our aims and our methods, and we were
able to get them approved and adopted by the Military Authorities.
For internal education there was selected and appointed an Education
Officer with a small staff for every battalion or unit of similar strength; there
were also Supervising Divisional Education Officers for each division and
similar formation, and Assistant Directors for France, England and Egypt,
as well as for various departments—technical, agricultural, university studies,
and so on.
Each of these Departments were again subdivided into branches, e.g.,
Technical Department had a separate controller for each branch, viz., Civil,
Electrical, Mining, Mechanical Engineering. Everywhere there was given
to men, while they were detaine.l in their units awaiting repatriation, oppor-
tunity to take up some subject or enter upon some course. The Commanding
Officers for the most part threw themselves with energy into the work, and
helped to organise all kinds of training for the men under their command.
Greater facilities existed in some places than in others, and consequently
the work went better there. The second divisions, for instance, were able to


place 325 men under excellent conditions in the Universite du Travail at
Cnarleroi, where they were able to receive excellent instruction in various
branches of the mechanical arts. 1 here were, in addition to Battalion classes,
Brigade, Division and Corps Schools, in such a variety of subjects that it
would be wearisome to give the list of them.
Our three main central schools under the internal scheme were at Rue,
near the mouth of the Somme, where Professor Wallace, of Melbourne Uni-
versity, was Superintendent of Studies; at Jeumont, on the Belgian border,
for the technical and craft instruction; and at Sutton Veny, for agricultural
and land studies.
On the external education side 10,000 men were placed out for various
periods in universities, colleges, workshops, farms, etc.
A university magazine will be chiefly interested in what was done for and
by university men. We had worked hard over the problems of the under-
graduate with a broken course, and had enlisted the sympathetic considera-
tion of Home Universities on his behalf.
In the early days of our work I had discovered Mr. H. W. Allen, Vice-
Master of Ormond, doomed to employ his energies till war should end upon
typing army forms. I had him commissioned to the Education Service, and
the undergraduate became his special care. Mr. Allen worked each day and
every day a weary toll of hours on behalf of the undergrad. There can rarely
have been quite such a shocking example of sweated labour as in the Educa-
tion Ser\ ice during the months of November, December and January last.
In the end we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do for the under-
graduate was to get him back to Australia as speedily as possible.
The home Universities were overcrowded, courses were difficult of adjust-
ment, and the average undergrad.’s needs could much better be met in Aus-
tralia. Sir John Monash agreed that our reasons were sound, and granted
early repatriation to undergraduates so that they might rejoin their Univer-
sities in March, 1919. In the army it is one thing to get a policy assented to,
another thing to get it enforced. It was a hard struggle to make the mili-
tary machine yield up the undergraduates, but gradually he was released
from its grip and sent homewards in time to save the wastage of still another
year from his professional career.
Another task we carried through in those early days of demobilisation
was to secure the recall of all Australian Rhodes Scholars serving with the
forces. They were scattered far and wide about the earth, but in a short time
we found them all but one, who was away on some “mystery” expedition in
the wilds of Asiatic Russia. All others we were able to place in Oxford in
January, except Major Kent Hughes, M.C., of Melbourne University, whose
journey from Aleppo to London took just too long to place Him in residence
for the first term.
Howe\ er, there were still quite a large number of undergraduates for
whom special courses were obtained, but for the most part our policy was
to reserve the opportunities in British Universities for the graduates of our
own Universities, who could profit much more widely from the special inten-
sive courses provided. The numbers of men taking advantage of these
courses was always changing, as some completed and others entered upon a
course. On June 7th last there were 559 men doing courses at British and


Foreign Universities, and engaged in educational, legal and medical studies
connected with Universities. 04 the same date there were 2401 men doing
courses under the technical sectipn, and 2192 under the agricultural section.
Great numbers of these represented post graduate studies of University men
in engineering, agriculture, forestry, and Kindred subjects. For purposes of
departmental organisation, University ‘men in engineering and agriculture
were grouped under the technical and agricultural sections not under “Uni-
versity Studies.”
in addition to these courses arranged under the demobilisation procedure,
there had been established during the War by the generous gilts of people
in England a large number of Overseas Sailors’ and Soldiers Scholarships,
t hese were tenable at ail Universities and colleges in Great Britain, and were
restricted to men incapacitated for further general service with the forces.
Our Australian men were eager competitors for these scholarships, and did
excellent work as students.
We secured more than our due proportion because of the eagerness and
good quality of the men whose names we sent in. Australians gained nine-
teen out of the first thirty-six awarded, and, writing now from memory, 1
think our eventual tally was 23 out of 43.
Many applications of great merit had to be refused owing to the depletion
of the scholarship funds.
It is impossible within the limits of this article to give anything like a
complete description of the Education Service. 1 have done no more than
mention the big school over which I placed Professor Wallace as Superinten-
dent of Studies. The early woes and ultimate triumphs of that school from
its coal-less, stove-less beginnings in a bitterly cold January to its final voyage
home w’ith work continued all the way deserves an article ail to itself. All
honour to Professor Wallace and his staff for their pluck, patience and
resourcefulness.
The Universities of Australia sent over to us Assistant Professor Holme,
of Sydney, who arrived in London in January. The authority given him by
the Universities was very useful in arranging entrance examinations, etc. Of
course we had been compelled to determine all vital policies long before his
arrival in January. Hpwever, upon his arrival I had him gazetted as
Assistant Director for University Studies, and with Mr. Allen and Mr. Clark,
of Adelaide, he was given charge of the courses and studies of University
men.
The whole work is now swiftly coming to an end, but those who laboured
so hard to make the Education Service a great success believe that its influ-
ence will tell upon Australian life for long years to come.
Ten thousand men have been given unique opportunities for study and
experience in the older countries. Tens of thousands of other soldiers have
been brought under helpful influences. The record of attendance at lectures
for the week ending June 16th was 35,600, an increase of 1200 over the week
before. There were 126,000 attendances at lectures and classes during six
weeks of April and May. These lectures and classes are continued on the
transports until the troops are disembarked in Australia.
Many of the ablest men of the Empire have been introduced to the
“Diggers” under the auspices of the Education Service.






Sir Cecil Hertslet, British Consul General for Belgium, 1903-15, recently
lectured to audiences of 700 and 1000 men respectively on “The Siege and
I’all of Antwerp’’ and “1 he Romance of Empire.’’ He was greatly impressed
by the splendid attention of the men and the excellence of the Education
Scheme. He stated it was the finest scheme of the sort he had seen in a
wide experience, and the one most appreciated by the men of all that had been
inaugurated in the armies.
I hat testimony has been given again and again by numbers of experi-
enced public men, who have been in touch with the Education Service.
As a matter of fact a special Commission of Experts appointed to investi-
gate the army Education Service in England and France pronounced the Aus-
tralian service to be the one service functioning satisfactorily, and recom-
mended its organisation as a model.
Ihe fact that the Australian Education Service was able to reach the
measure of success it did was entirely due to the amazing energy, devotion,
and self-sacrifice of the big body of men who threw themselves into its
activities at a time when they may well have considered themselves entitled
to rest at ease after the enemy had been beaten.
It was this spirit that made the Australian Corps so marvellously effi-
cient in the days of fighting, and almost a double portion of that spirit
seemed to come upon the indefatigable workers in the Education Service
when fighting days were done. In the Education Service men of all the
Universities of Australia bore their part, and though some of the very finest
of my Colleagues were not University men, yet the great majority of them
had received their capacity and inspiration for social service from their
Universities, and they did their Australian home of learning great honour by
the vigour and fine spirit with which they gave themselves to a difficult and
unexpected task.
Trinity College.
IN 1914, for the first time in their history, the Unversities of Australia found
themselves face to face with a national crisis of fundamental importance.
Civilisation and the whole social system were threatened with the sword,
and by the sword only could they be saved.
1 he prompt realisation of the danger, the sure and certain answer which
in the main University men gave to the call, are here beyond comment; we
are concerned with but one part in the whole, the record of Trinity College,
the number of her men that fought and died.
Within the past few weeks a considerable proportion of men then in
residence had enlisted, and their number was added to largely at the end of
the year, when the annual examination had relieved the individual of responsi-
bilities which, much as he might have wished it, could not earlier be disposed
of. , v


The first term of 1915 saw the College with few freshmen, and, relatively
speaking, still fewer senior men : a state of affairs which progressed until in
all there were barely twenty-five men in residence. Of this number but few
saw the commencement of the first term in the New Year. Those who found
themselves in residence came under the following categories—Were too
young; were medical students detained by order of the Minister of Defence—
and this class included several men sent back after participation in the Galli-
poli campaign; or were prevented by physical disabilities from enlistment.
The Warden was able to state in his annual report to the Council that Trinity
had no man in residence whose duty could fairly be said to lie elsewhere —a
state of affairs well borne out by the fact that under the first Conscription
Bill no College man was called into camp. Throughout 1917 and 1918 the
same conditions prevailed in each year; the number of our freshmen never
exceeded fifteen, and in each case our complement was depleted by enlistments
during the year. It is, perhaps, in this connection that expression is best
given to the gratitude felt by all Trinity men and women to the man who not
only kept the College open against his own best interests, but kept its name
above reproach in the performance of its duties to the State.
The College Roll of Service contains the names of three hundred and ten
men and women who played some part in the great struggle. Among them
some fifty-five decorations are shared, and of their number thirty-two gave
their lives for their country.
Ormond College.
WITHIN a few days of the acceptance by Great Britain of Australia’s
offer to send an expeditionary force, about a dozen of the men then
resident in Ormond went into camp at Broadmeadows. Those of
us who were in college at the time well remember Richardson, Cherry, Leckie,
Wright Smith, Wynne, Campbell, Morrison, Rogers and Dr. S. J. Campbell
coming to dinner in Hall one evening and being wished God-speed by the
Master (Dr. MacFarland) —to the envy of all the others, who were not able
to get away so quickly to the great adventure.
Richardson and Campbell were killed on Gallipoli within a month of the
landing, Leckie m France early in 1916. Dr. Campbell was killed while
bathing at Anzac. Rogers has returned to College this year as Captain J.
D. Rogers, M.C., and Belgian Croix de Guerre, of Army Headquarters
Staff, while Captain G. N. I. Morrison is now on the Staff of the Black
Watch.
The rest of the College meanwhile settled down to examinations, hardly
finding time for more than a hurried reading of the page of war cables in
the daily press. The men who finished their courses at the end of 1914 went
on active service almost to a man.






The year 1915 saw the new Master installed; and some organisation of
subscriptions to the various patriotic funds came into being. Men who had
returned to College felt restless, especially after the Gallipoli Campaign had
begun, and before the end of the first term McCallum, Searby, Longden, G.
E. Mackay, De Ravin, L. S. Woods, Hampton Southwell, Dr. Wilson, were
in camp. McCallum is back with us this year as Captain McCallum, after a
long spell in Germany, where he was taken as prisoner after being badly
wounded at Bullecourt. Dr. Wilson has returned to Australia with the rank
of Colonel.
Intercollegiate sport having been abandoned and early examinations insti-
tuted, the College settled dow n to work; but every man had more than half
his mind bent on the burning question of when he would be able to follow his
friends. The position as regards senior medical students was not then upon a
satisfactory basis, and Roberts, who enlisted and was in camp for some
weeks, was forcibly discharged to complete his course; he did so in 1917,
immediately went to the front, and was killed.
At the end of the 2nd term another big batch of men went from the
College to the various camps; D. V. K. Anderson, R. A. Reid, Powell,
Leggatt, Agnew, Pearson, Sandral, K. S. Reid, Pillow and Cook were among
their number. Of these Anderson, R. A. Reid, Agnew and Pillow gave their
lives; all the others are now back in college (Leggatt and Pearson with com-
missions), except Sandral, who has gone to Balliol, Oxford, as Rhodes
Scholar for 1915. Towards the end of the year, E. H. B, Woods, A. E.
Midleton, Porter, Gibson, Fay, Buckland, Adam, Browne, and Kelso joined
up, Woods having already seen service, but having returned to finish his
final year; with Fay and Gibson, he was awarded the Military Cross, Fay
subsequently adding a bar. Buckland was killed as a flight lieutenant. This
was the darkest year of the war, and that fact is reflected in our memories
of College life.
The end of 1915 and the beginning of 1916 saw our numbers at their
lowest ebb. During 1916 two opposite processes operated ; men continued to
enlist as they found themselves in a position to do so, but an intermittent
stream of returned men began to appear, bringing with them new thought
and interest into the life of the College. At August examinations Waterhouse,
Robertson, Disher, Crisp, Littlejohn, Sutherland, Hyett and Fox completed
their course, and came under military orders. We remember the gloom
cast by the untimely death of Sutherland after a painful illness. Captain Fox,
after a long period of able service, died on a transport returning to Australia.
Captain Disher added to his rowing laurels since the Armistice by stroking
the A.I.F. crew which won the King’s cup at Henley. Of junior men who
enlisted in 1916 Berthon and Webb made the supreme sacrifice.
At the beginning of 1917 the College had a phenomenal entry of men,
mostly under eighteen. The College, to its own great surprise, found itself
once more practically full. And it was at this time and in these circumstances
—more particularly in view of the fact that Australia had turned down com-
pulsory service (for the first time), that a definite policy in the matter of
military service was formulated. The College, rightly or wrongly, took the
view that, when a lead seemed necessary, such institutions should give the
lead; but more definitely that it must give the right lead to its own men, and
18


do everything in its power to ensure that each man did the right thing at
this greatest crisis in his life. The view was taken that no man should be
sent from Australia, to the rigours of modern war ten thousand miles away,
before the age of nineteen; and on the other hand that no fit man over the
age of twenty could justify refusal to go and play his part in the war. Men
in College knew then that the reputation and prestige of a great College stood
between every individual man and the unfair aspersions that might be made
by people ignorant of the facts of his particular case. The doors of the
College were definitely shut to every applicant who was in any way out of
tune with the great record of war service of the College.
Early in 1917 Dr. J. I. Connor went on active service; and in the middle
of the year was followed by the Vice Master, Mr, H. W. Allen, who had up
till that time been practically bound to the College by the necessity to give
the Master the benefit of his long experience in forging the links between the
new regime and the old. No figure has been more missed from College, and
none will be more heartily welcomed back. Captain Connor has done some
distinguished work on the influenza epidemic in Europe, and Captain Allen
was, late in 1918, drafted to the work of the A.I.F. Educational Committee.
College numbers fell again in 1918. A sad feature of the year was the
news from time to time of the death of men who had been in College with
us; it had become the practice to remember these men and their people at
College Prayers, and the muster of College men to mourn their lost friends
will be a lasting memory. In September the services of the Master were
requisitioned by the Federal Government for the work of Educational War
Propaganda then instituted, and he was much away from College on missions
to other States.
By the end of the year our men began to return, and in the early part of
the present year they had returned to such an extent that College had to
overflow into houses in Parkville. Nearly half our numbers now are returned
men.
If there is a strain of monotony in this record, it is because the College
thought and talked of little but the war during these years. Its proudest
possession and tradition is a Roll of Service of some 450 names, some 60 of
whom gave their lives, and 110 of the number enlisted from College. A
War Memorial Scheme has been launched, and an organisation (the War
Savings Groups) which achieved great success has been diverted to this new
object.
The war has left us with a great tradition, and it is for us and our
successors to see that the achievements of peace times are worthy of that
tradition and of the men who died.






Queen's College.
THE outbreak of the war in August, 1914, found the College with' 61
resident students, which is about the limit of its accommodation.
Within a month nine past and present students had joined the colours,
and by the end of the year this number had been increased in 56, so that we
opened the session of 1915 w *th only 43 in residence. We heartily concurred
in the decision that no inter-collegiate sports should be held whilst so many
of our comrades were risking their lives at the Front; and it was also
resolved that the usual initiation festivities and other public college functions
should be suspended during the continuance of the war. As the month's went
on, and it became obvious that we were in for a prolonged struggle with our
enemies, the call for additional volunteers was cheerfully responded to, and
by the end of the first year of the war we had 81 men serving at the front
or preparing to go. These were mostly in Egypt and Gallipoli, and in August
I received a leter from Chaplain-Colonel Green, in which he said, “I should
like you and the men at Queen’s to know that Queen’s is well represented
here (in Gallipoli), and is contributing valuable service in this difficult opera-
tion which the Empire has to see through.” Iwo of our men had already
fallen, Captain G. C. M. Mathison, M.D., and the Rev. A. G. Stapleton. Our
number of residents at the beginning of the third term was reduced to 31.
By March, 19*6, we had 130 on our Honour Roll, besides 16 others who were
doing military service in various capacities at the home base; and eleven had
laid down their lives in the performance of their duty. Only 28 men came
into residence in 1916, and the work in our Theological Hall had to be sus-
pended altogether, as all the students had either gone to the front, or were
taking the work of ministers who had been sent as Chaplains there. In con-
sequence of this, the Master was able to take a Chaplaincy at the Royal Park
Military Camp, which he continued until the camp was done away with 18
months later. Though several new students from the schools came into resi-
dence in 1917, our number remained stationary at 28; and most of these, who
were of military age, had offered their services, but had been rejected for
health and other reasons. Our Honour Roll grew steadily through these
years, but owing to a Large influx of boys from the secondary schools we
had 39 residents at the beginning of 1918; this number, however, fell to 34
before the end of the year. The inevitable financial loss during the years of
the war was- generously met by a number of gentlemen who contributed
annually to a War Emergency hund, and so enabled us to carry on without
any serious increase of our debt. When the armistice was proclaimed and it
was possible to make up the totals, we were able to report that 210 of our
past and present students had volunteered and been accepted for active service
in various capacities at the front; of whom 30 had given their lives for King
and Empire. It is intended to commemorate the self-sacrifice and devotion
of these brave men by the erection of a Memorial Chapel in the College
grounds. Five of our men have won the Military Medal, fifteen the Military
Cross, one the Distinguished Conduct Medal, five the D. 5.0., two the
0.8. E., one the C.M.G., one the C. 8.E., and one tKe French Croix de
18 k


Guerre. Two of our Rhodes Scholars, Dr. Apperley and Dr. Frank Kerr,
found their way from Oxford to the front, and a third. Dr. A. C. D. Ri'ett,
did eminent service in England in the Munitions Department; whilst Pro .
Steele, F.R.S., and Dr. Walter Rosenhain have taken a foremost place in
connection with the manufacture of explosives, and of aeroplanes respectively.
The Chaplain-General of the Methodist Church of Australia, and the Chaplain-
General for Victoria are both on our roll, as well as the Naval Chaplain on
board H.M.S. Sydney.
Non nobis, Domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da glonam !
The Work of University Women.
Melbourne University Red Cross Centre, 1914-1919.
(BY M. H. W.)
THE University Red Cross Centre was formed in April, 1915. Previous
to this date there had been an “At Homes” Committee of the Univer-
sity Union, managing weekly gatherings, which at once became sewing
parties for war work as soo as war broke out in August, 1914. The work
was definitely organised for Red Cross purposes at the beginning of first
term, 1915, and the first work .afternoon was held on May sth. A large
general committee was formed, representing all the groups of women mem-
bers of the Union. From this number an executive was elected, with Mrs.
Orme Masson as President. Mrs. Masson remained our President all through,
and it is largely thanks to her untiring interest, and the steady support of
other senior members of the branch, that the work was carried on as regu-
larly and successfully as it was. The Centre was registered with the Vic-
torian Division of the Australian Red Cross Society (8.R.C.5.). In 1916 a
University Trench Sock Guild was formed, distinct from the work for the
sick and wounded, and most of the socks knitted by us after this were sent
to the Australian Comforts Fund for the men on active service.
The work party met every Wednesday afternoon of Term, in the Club
House common room. Graduates, undergraduates, members of staff, wives
of members of staff, and sometimes other friends, came together between
2 and sto sew shirts, roll bandages, make swabs—and talk. In spite of the
sadness that lay behind it all, we often had very pleasant times on these
Wednesday afternoons. Sometimes someone played the piano, but generally
we just chatted while we worked. On fine days some of us took our sewing
outside and sat in groups on the lawn. Generally, however, the majority
remained in the common room, which presented a very busy scene. We
appropriated the whole southern end of the room, and dragged in three or


four tables from the dining-room, round which we sat in parties—swab-making
parties, or bandage-winders, or shirt-folders, or sewers-on of buttons. The
machine buzzed busily in one corner, putting button-holes into flannel shirts,
which were then doled out to waiting hands to receive buttons and linishing
touches. In another corner sat those who had charge of the wool, which they
gave out to knitters to be made up, receiving back each week all the socks
that had been knitted up to date. The attendance at these Wednesday meet-
ings varied from about a dozen (in third term, or at other strenuous periods)
to perhaps 40 or 50. Many women who were unable for various reasons to
attend the University Red Cross parties, worked for other war organisations,
and certainly very many knitted socks, at all hours of the day, both in and
out of lectures.
Altogether, the University Red Cross Centre turned out about 4675
flannel shirts, 6900 bandages, 2530 pairs of socks (exclusive of the Trench
Sock Guild, which sent away over 2600), and 11,280 swabs, besides a great
many other Red Cross articles, such as pyjamas, slippers, cardigans,
washers, scarves, counterpanes, etc., as demands came in from the central
depot.
Two one-day Red Cross Carnivals were held, one in April, 1917, and
one in April, 1918. Much good work v/as done by both men and women
members of the University in connection with the organisation and carrying
out of these carnivals, and on each occasion the University was transformed
for a day and a night into a wonderfully gay and crowded place, with peopk-
swarming everywhere, in and out of the buildings, and bright little booths dis-
playing their wares for sale under the staid old Morton Bay Figs and in the
Wilson Hall itself. The 1917 carnival realised nearly £ 7OO, and the 1918
one nearly £I2OO. On several other occasions kind friends organised enter'
tainments to augment our funds, and knitting-competitions brought us ir
both money and goods from time to time. Various University societies also
made us donations, and we collected small weekly subscriptions from our
own members. With the money received in all these ways we were able to
provide our workers with as much flannel, wool, bandage material, etc., as
they could deal with. We were able also to make donations to the British
Red Cross, the Victorian Red Cross, the French Red Cross, and other
patriotic funds in need of help.
The work-parties were continued after the Armistice till well on into 1919,
as there was still material on hand, and the demands upon Red Cross goods
did not slacken at once. The Australian Red Cross needed kit-bags, house-
wives, shirts and socks for the returning men, which we went on supplying.
The last work-party was held at the end of second term, 1919. Mrs. Masson
asked all the members present to tea in the dining-room, and we said fare-
well to nearly five years of Red Cross activity.
Of the funds remaining, was allocated to the Red Cross libraries,
'£s° to the Curative Workshop, and the balance to the Red Cross fund
for army nurses.
The last record in the Minute Book of the Branch is significant of the
end of the war period and the beginning, we hope, of a happier era. It
says that our faithful hamper, in which we used to send to the Central Depot
our finished products, packed in neat bundles, is to be given to the Union—
“after having the Red Cross erased.”


Massage: A Branch of Service.
WHEN the Military Authorities foresaw the need of massage for many
of the returning sick and wounded members of tlie A.1.F., they
called for volunteer workers to undertake a modified course in
massage. As workers were wanted quickly, the training was condensed into
about six months. Through the Australian Massage Association, the A.I.F.
authorities arranged w’ith the Melbourne University for a special course of
lectures under the guidance of the Professors of Anatomy and Physiology,
who took a very great interest in the scheme. The course began in September,
1918. There were lectures in anatomy and physiology for three months, and
a six weeks’ course in dissecting. The lectures were taken in conjunction with
practical work at the Melbourne Hospital, and the students worked hard
and were remarkably successful. On completing the course, all who got
through went straight to work at the Various military hospitals, where most
of them still are. In all, about 40 students qualified for service by means of
this modified course. Their work has been highly appreciated by the mili-
tary authorities. All are enthusiatic in their gratitude for the valuable help
they had from the professors and demonstrators who gave so much time and
attention to this special course.
As regards the full Australian Massage Association Diploma, that is, of
course, not a University diploma, but the students who do that course as a
matter of fact spend most of their time at the University attending lectures
in anatomy and physiology with the medical students. Practically all who
went in for the course from 1910 onwards have been doing qualified war
work. During the war period, the students qualifying each year went
straight on to war work, and some were sent on service abroad.
The “modified” students are a most ardent band. Most of them began
hospital work in April and May of this year, chiefly at No. 11 A.G.H.
(Caulfield), No. 3 A.G.H. (Base), and No. 16 A.G.H. (MacLeod). At Caul-
field the comparatively more recent surgical cases are treated The work as a
whole is typically war work, dealing with deep adhesive scars, paralysis,
through nerve injury, Rnd stiffened and deformed cases of a sort not often
seen at a civil hospital; the students love the general atmosphere at these
military hospitals and the cheery optimism of the Diggers. The patients
generally welcome massage treatment, though the masseuses have been given
the name of “Agony Sisters,” and the electrical room and gymnasium, with
their queer devices, are known as “the Mad House.” The masseuses are
not likely to forget the help and courtesy of the University in making it pos-
sible for so many of them to take this modified training, and so qualify to
undertake this important and interesting work at a time when the need for
masseuses was great and the supply seemed likely to be unequal to the
demand.

CALIBRATION OF MUNITIONS GAUGES.
When, in 1915, the need for large quantities of munitions was felt
and the matter of very greatly increased production was decided on in
Great Britain, a similar move was made in Australia. Federal and
State Munitions Committees were formed to investigate how Australia could
best help in this matter and to devise means for carrying their findings into
effect. It was decided to manufacture the bodies of 18-pounder high explosive
shells, but after a good deal of preliminary work had been done the project was
dropped in 1916 owing to the high cost of production in Australia, compared
with that in Great Britain. The Ministry of Munitions had brought about a
phenomenal reduction in the cost of shell bodies as a result of the dilution
of labour, the use of single purpose machines and by careful organisation in
other respects. It was then found that more good could be done by sending
skilled workers to Great Britain, and this course was followed with much
success. While the shell-making project was being attempted a great deal
of work was done by Professor Lyle, and under his direction by Mr. H. J.
Grayson (whose death in 1917 was greatly deplored), and by Messrs. W. M.
Holmes, E. B. Brown, and V. J. Daley. The task was the calibration of
munitions gauges required for the inspection of shells before they could be
accepted by the War Office. The gauges fix the limiting sizes permitted
of the various dimensions of the shells, and are required to be of great
accuracy themselves. In most cases the actual gauging dimensions are re-
quired to agree with their nominal value to three ten-thousandths of an inch.
Many difficulties had to be overcome before the work of calibration could
be performed. The most fundamental difficulty lay in the absence in Aus-
tralia of length standards of known accuracy. The various standards at
hand were compared and weighed by Professor Lyle, and he established a
provisional standard. End and line standards were made in accordance with
this by Mr. Grayson and sent to England and America for measurement at
the National Standardising laboratories. The errors in the Melbourne Uni-
versity provisional standard were found to be very small, and not nearly
enough to affect the accuracy of gauge measurements. Mr, Grayson’s great
mechanical skill was most valuable in other ways, as he was able to construct
many special pieces of apparatus, including two comparators. As nothing
had hitherto been done before in Australia of a like nature, suitable methods
had to be devised for measuring up the gauges with such apparatus as could
be made or bought.
METALLURGY.
An investigation on the manufacture of ferro-alloys was undertaken at
the request of the Federal Munition Committee, and a committee consisting
of Messrs. A. J. Higgin, E. B. Brown, W. N. Kernot, and E. C. Rennie
was appointed. These alloys are necessary components in certain kinds of
steel, particularly in ‘‘high-speed” steels, of which there was a shortage.
The possibility of the manufacture of these alloys from ores which could be
obtained in Australia or from any other available source was therefore a
subject of much importance. The alloys made were ferro-chrome and ferro-
-19


tungsten, the former from ore procured from Noumea, and the latter from
Australian ores. For the reduction and refining of these alloys, two electric
arc furnaces were constructed and set up in the Metallurgy Department. Ihe
larger furnace had a normal input of about 70 kilowatts, and very high tem-
peratures were obtained.
As a result of the researches, a considerable quantity of ferro-chrome
and ferro-tungsten was made. This work is being followed up under the
Advisory Council of Science and Industry.
LAW.
Professor W. Harrison Moore acted as special adviser to the Common-
wealth in International Law.
ARTS.
Dr. A. Lodewyckx rendered valuable service in connection with the
Defence Department by the interpretation of documents in Romance, Scan-
dinavian and Slavonic languages.
HOME SERVICE LIST.
C. W. Joy, 8.C.E., filled the position of radiographer at No. 3 Aus-
tralian General Hospital, and devised important improvements to the X-ray
bulb stand.
NATURAL PHILOSOPHY SCHOOL.
The most important piece of work carried out by members of the Natural
Philosophy School was connected with the design of the Melbourne Univer-
sity Respirator, of which an account is given in another paragraph. The
mechanical details were tried out, and the efficacy of the respirator against
chlorine gas was demonstrated with apparatus made by the workshop staff
of the department. The supervision of components and of filled containers
of some 10,000 respirators was also successfully carried out.
A stand for the support and manipulation of X-ray bulbs was designed,
find stands made to this design were installed by the Defence Department in
various military hospitals. In connection with the manufacture of the Berry
hand grenade, some 12,000 feet of mining fuse were inspected by means of
X-ray photographs.
ENGINEERING SCHOOL.
It is merely a truism to say that the war was an engineer’s war, and it
follows that the Engineering School had to take its share in advising on modes
of procedure, in testing materials and appliances, and in developing inven-
tions of a warlike nature.
The members of the staff from the outset determined that all their work
should be a free gift to the Empire, and during the whole period of the war
their time and energy was always available in an honorary capacity.


To detail all the spheres of activity entered into would requite space
than is available, but the main classes of work undertaken can be classified
under the following heads: —
(a) Members of staff acting on various war committees.
(b) Free expert consultation work on war matters.
(c) The testing of materials for their suitability for use in the manufac-
ture of munitions of war.
(d) Developing designs of warlike appliances.
(e) The manufacture of special machines and of hand grenades.
(f) Students’ work in connection with the above.
From the outset it was evident that the School would lose large numbers
of students, and soon after the war commenced all the advanced classes were
practically empty, while the only full year was the first. As soon as the
student reached the minimum age he was longing to be away to the front,
and as soon as his parents would say Yes he enlisted. In many cases rejects
During the war the Defence Department required some special engineer-
ing drafting work to be done in an emergency. The School provided twelve
men with boards and appurtenances practically on the spur of the moment.
These men spent three solid weeks measuring up and detailing aircraft at
Point Cook. Incidentally they gave up a vacation in doing so, but the work
fully justified the sacrifice.
When equipment was scarce the Defence Department found in their
stores two portable wireless sets; these were brought to the University,
thoroughly overhauled and repaired, and sent out to do service in Gallipoli
and Mesopotamia. Operators were also trained in the detail and use of the
engines, generators, and the electrical equipment.
The workshop of the School was in constant requisition in the develop-
ment of various inventions. The detail design and construction of the
Wackett automatic fuse setter is an example of this class of war work, Iwo
different patterns of this machine were made, tested, and sent by the Defence
Department to Great Britain.
The local supply of “coppers” used for testing explosion pressures in
guns having run out, a compression machine was designed and constructed.
Phis machine, after a little adjustment, produced “coppers” of a fully satis-
factory character.
The cement laboratory was at one time converted into a manufactory for
hand grenades. Equipped with a number of special machines, a foreman
and staff made large numbers of Berry hand grenades, packed them in spe-
cially designed cases, and forwarded them to the other side of the world.
The first working drawings of an 18-pound shell for the use of the
Munitions Committee were made at the School, and afterwards drawings
of shell details and gauges were worked out.
To help forward the production of Ferro-alloys the Engineering School
constructed two electric furnaces, with their equipment, and installed them
in the Metallurgical Laboratory. These furnaces have been used throughout
the investigations undertaken in the Metallurgical Department.
Tests of the strength of steel and timbers for use in shell and aeroplane
construction were conducted in the Testing Laboratory. Ihe large testing
machine was continually requisitioned for war work.


Standard weights were required in order to determine the exact limits
of weight of the 18-pound shell. These were designed, manufactured and
adjusted to a fine degree of accuracy at the School, and are now kept as
standards by the Defence Department.
At another time the Defence Department had the design of transport
waggon wheels under consideration, and the services of the Engineering De-
partment were called into requisition in connection therewith. Tests were
made and an investigation undertaken in order to determine the most suitable
form for adoption.
Branching into another sphere of war work, in connection with the
Bomb Committee, the testing of explosives was conducted in a specially
constructed bomb-proof shelter in the University grounds. The charges were
modified and tested until the most efficient results were arrived at.
Members of the staff acted on many War Committees, among which may
be mentioned—
Federal Committee for clearing and dispatch of some 5000 munition
workers to Great Britain.
The Bomb Committee, which investigated inventions in regard to bombs,
hand grenades, and catapults.
The Committee for the Selection of Standard Chassis for Motor Ambu-
lances.
The Federal Munitions Committee appointed two of the members of the
Engineering Staff as consulting members.
The Dean of the Faculty was a member of the Arsenal Committee and
a member of the delegation of experts who visited India to enquire into their
arsenals. The delegation was away from Australia for a period extending
over three months. He also acted as consultant to the Defence Department
in connection with War Patents.
The work undertaken by the various members of the Staff was often of
a very special character, involving secrecy and dispatch, and at times it was
no easy matter to keep war work and University classes going on at the same
time. And now that the classes are full and overflowing the staff is working
under as full pressure as ever, helping the men to make up the work lost
while they were away at the front.
THE MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY RESPIRATOR.
The many practical problems concerning respirators had occupied the
attention of several physiologists before the war in different parts of the world.
In Melbourne considerable experience had been gained wuth the Zuntz mouth-
piece and nose clip used in conjunction with an absorbing box. This was
improved upon, and a handy box respirator containing soda-lime absorbent
was devised by Mr. W. J. McCaw, late laboratory assistant in the Department
of Physiology,
When news arrived in Melbourne that the Germans were employing gas,
and presumably chlorine, as a deadly agent of war, a committee was appointed
locally to suggest some form of protection. This committee consisted of
Professors Laby, Masson and Osborne, of the University, and commenced


work promptly in June, 1915. The result of their conjoint labours was that,
starting from the McCaw respirator, they devised a handy and well finished
box respirator, with effective valves containing soda-lime as absorbent. In
addition, a form of rubber rimmed goggles was recommended to protect the
eys. This was tested in every imaginable way, including actual wearing by
its inventors in a trench dug in the University grounds, and filled with chlorine
gas, and also with sulphur dioxide gas. The complete specifications and
samples were despatched from Melbourne on August nth, 1915. The Muni-
tions Committee of the Defence Department took up the respirator, and after
some delay, due to local difficulties connected with material, ten thousand were
manufactured, with connecting tube, suspension cord, nose clip, and goggles
all complete, packed in an oblong box. Each part, including the enclosed
absorbent, was made locally, and the whole assembled in the Natural Philo-
sophy Department of the University—no easy task !
These respirators were sent at the earliest possible date to Europe.
Unfortunately, by the time they arrived other gases, not absorbed by soda-
lime, were being employed by the Germans, and the Melbourne University Res-
pirator was not put to use. But there is some reason to believe that the effort
was not made in vain. It is certainly interesting that shortly after the arrival
of this respirator in England the official design was changed, and one highly
suggestive of the Melbourne pattern adopted. Professor Starling wrote at
the time that the Melbourne respirator was “probably the best yet produced.”
Professor Haldane, of Oxford, than whom there is no greater authority on
the subject, expressed to the writer in February, 1917, his high opinion of
the design. The history of gas warfare has yet to be written, and those
responsible for the Melbourne University Respirator look forward with con-
siderable interest and a certain amount of assurance to the facts that will
one day be disclosed.
W.A.O.
A Skylark at Messines.
Triumphant soars thy song again,
Thrilling the morning light;
That flames on skies dark after rain,
Bursting the bars of night;
The battle-crash is hushed and still
As twilight’s faded west;
No whining shell blasts this bleak hill,
The tortured earth has rest.
Singer of peace and happiness,
Abide with us who long
For thy pure melodics to bless
This sullen world of wrong,
Where brightest dreams fall withered, dead,
The false gods strangle truth.
And bitter years run deep and red
With blood of martyred youth !


Prophetic voice ! I hear in thee
Hidden in raying gold,
Man’s spirit pealing victory
To haggard earth grown old,
Disfigured with the ghastly yield
Of centuries of sin.
0 voice above the battlefield
The mighty years begin !
The song is dead, the sun is lost,
In thickening cloud and gloom;
The ruined earth is twisted, tossed —
A desecrated tomb,
Dark, hopeless, evil is the w'orld ;
1 hear the guns’ hoarse breath,
And .overhead again are hurled
Pain, desolation, death.

. those men who saw their duty clearly in the beginning and who accepted it !
Some of them were poor, without education, and with few chances in life . . . Some
of those men, in their last moments —as they charged up some bitter place to throw the
enemy from his stronghold, or no less grandly stood at the corner of some trench, hold-
ing it a moment longer for Britain —in those last moments, in their cramped ,souls, many
new windows were opened, I warrant.” —Sydney dc Loghc.
Darkness and night, and wounded earth, unseen
With silent trenches o’er her breathless breast.
Now, for the hundredth time the slow wind sighs
Over the parapet, and many men
Curse under breath, or pray, or wonder, calm,
How the last breath is taken. Lagging time
At last draws on the mark, and breath is free;
So with the dawning all the line springs up
In a great brotherhood ; the charge sweeps on ;
All life is on a cloud, and former ways
Seem cast beyond a gulf, a previous death.
Ah, now, he finds a great reward who dies,
If in the last glad moment left of life
The soul-cramp leaves him, and he breasts the height,
Laughing his triumph over freedom’s land. . . .
When Death looks up and fears to count his gain.
