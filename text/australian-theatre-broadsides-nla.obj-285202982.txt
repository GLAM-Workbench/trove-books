An Antarctic iceberg has been seen that

There was an Irishman at Glebe West,
He had a terrible pain under his vest;
“ Be Job,” says he, “ I’ll go to the shop that is

And get meself some of Tkescott’s Squill

An old lawyer was once complained to
by a gentleman that some malicious per-
son had cut off his horse’s tail, which, as
be meant to sell him, would be a great
drawback. “ Then,” said the lawyer,
“ you must sell him wholesale. “ Whole-
sale ?’ cried the other; “what do you
mean—how so ?” “ Because you cannot
retail him.”
“ How far did you say it was from the
station to the house, Dennis ?” “ Two
miles, sir.” “Two miles! Why, we
have been over three already.” “ Well,
sir, the roads are bad about here, so we
give good measure.”
HAKKAWAY’S PUKE OATMEAL
A gentleman one day took his little lad
out for a walk ; but the boy, from some
cause or other, got lost, and meeting a
policeman, tearfully asked, “ Please, sir,
have you seen a man without a little boy ?
’cause if you have, Pse that little boy.”
Berlin began to number houses in 1795.
Starting from the Brandenburg Gate, the
Prussian ediles counted straight on to
infinity, neither beginning afresh with
fresh streets nor numbering the houses
by odds and evens. Vienna adopted the
latter reform in 1803 ; and Paris followed
in 1805.

FOR PERFECT MANHOOD, HEALTH, STRENGTH AND VIGOR.
Thy sin* of youthful ignorance, the dissipation, the weakness that proves a harrier to marriage—these are the things
™; are daily plunging thousands of men into a condition of utter ruin. The wasted parts, nervousness and physical
debility, all resulting from abuses and excesses, continue to sap the life away, simply because the sufferer in his ignor-
ance is too bashful, too far gone in a shrinking fear of discovery, to make kuown his condition or to seek out a friend. It
is this lack of courage, this blighted, backward fear that has prompted me to make known to every man, weak and
worn out from dissipation, that there is a chance for you, an opportunity whereby you may be lifted out of that state
of dread and despair, to a happy condition of self-respect and manly courage, if he will only make it a point of con-
sulting the WOKLD-BENOWNED SPECIALIST,

F. TRESOOTT, Opp Beir Maker.
A pious old lady recently sent as a sil-
ver-wedding present, a pair of flat-irons,
a rolling-pin, and a motto worked on card-
board, reading, “ Fight on."
The other day a' lady was asked by
some little girls to come and look at a
bridal-party of dolls, at whose toilette
they had been assisting. On viewing the
pretty gathering, she ventured to inquire,
“ But where is the bridegroom “ Oh,
we don’t want any men !” was the prompt
reply.
One of the most remarkable exports of
the Gold Coast, is that of monkey skins.
During the last five years, an average of
176,000 skins havebeen annually exported.
It must be extremely pleasing to patrons of
the theatres to know that when the play is over
they can always adjourn to those first-class
supper rooms at Woodward’s, 122 King Street,
and enjoy a dainty oyster, fish or hot supper.
Woodward’s rooms are so select in patrons, and *
yet so moderate in tariff that not only theatre
goers, but also the middle-day diners invariably
first try for a seat at these well-known rooms.
Woodward’s Oysters are as well and favorably
known as the post office clock.
The widow’s cap is as old as the days of
Julius Caesar. An edict of Tiberius com-
manded all widows to wear the cap under
penalty of a heavy fine and imprisonment.
Trescott’s Squill Candy won’t cure head-

In the London and Paris of a century
ago numbered houses did not exist. The
coat-of-arms, the house-name, or the
sign-board were the only indications to
guide our ancestors’ wandering feet by
day or night.
The natives of India believe that
elephants have a religion and form of

The preparation of the human hair for

A speaker at a recent debate on the

who were medical men !

The other day while passing up William
Street, I called in at FORSSB ERG’S, No. 78,
to see his furniture. I only calKd with the in-
tention of pricing, but before leaving his shop I
furnished my cottage right out on his Easy
Time Payment System. Paying £2 down and
7s. 6d weekly. He charges no extra for his
easy terms. '
It’s a well-known fact that trade is slack,

And er—er —Trescott & Co. are the makers.
GOLDEN OPINIONS.
I mark thro’ Sunny New South Wales,
As thick as bees in Clover,
Encomiums on Golden Meal,
And splendid Meal moreover.
And here upon my fence, I swear,
A further search discloses ;
Pemell’s Wheatena neatly stamped.
Half hidden now by roses.
My little wife’s first venture, made
In mortal trepidation,
corned out a big success, and earned
All round congratulation.
The sterling worth of Pembll’s Meal
Shall still assert its power ;
And maximum of excellence,
Their Snow-white Roller Floub.
Of all classes of foreign labourers in the
United States, the Germans are said to
become the most dexterous operators with
machinery.
If you are tangled over night, Trescott’s Opp
Beir,
Will untangle you in the morning.
An English poet of the last century
gives the following advice as to the wear
ng of colors :
“ The lass whose skin is like the hazel brown,
With brighter colors should o’ercome her own.
Let the fair nymph in whose white cheek is seen
A rosy blush, be clad in cheerful green.
Ladies grown pale with sickness or despair,
The sable mournful hue should choose to wear.
So the pale moon still shines with purest light.
Clad in the dusky mantle of the night.”
