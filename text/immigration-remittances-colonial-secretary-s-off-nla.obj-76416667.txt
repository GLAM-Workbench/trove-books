Immigration Remittances*
Colonial Secretary's Office,
Sydney, 22 nd December, 1848.
HIS Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has
been pleased to direct the publication of the following Notice, setting forth the
measures which will be adopted in pursuance of instructions from the Right Honora-
ble the Secretary of State, for facilitating the Remittance of any sums of money which
persons settled in the Colony may desire to send to their relatives or friends or others
in the United Kingdom for the purpose of enabling them to emigrate to this country.
I,?ln the Country Districts the Clerks of Petty Sessions throughout the Colony will be directed to receive, on
every Public Court day during the Sitting of the Court, but at no other time or place, any sums which
residents in the district may desire to remit to the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners for the
purpose of being applied to the provision of steerage passages to this Colony for their friends or relatives
or others. In Sydney and Melbourne such sums will be received at the Treasury, where they can be paid
in at any time during the usual office hours.
2.?The Clerks of Petty Sessions on receiving any suras under this notice, will enter in the printed form annexed
(Schedule A,) the name and address of the Depositor, the name, age, calling, and residence of the person
or persons in the United Kingdom for whose benefit the money is to be applied, and the names and resi-
dences of such persons of note as the Depositors may refer to for the purpose of answering any enquiries
which the Land and Emigration Commissioners may have to make ; and will write, at the foot of the same,
Receipts for the amounts paid into their hands. These forms will, in each case be filled up in triplicate,
and the three copies having been certified by one or more of the Magistrates present, one of them will be
handed to the Depositor, another will be forwarded to the Colonial Treasurer, with the List mentioned ia
the following clause, and the third will be retained as a record in the office of the Clerk of Petty Sessions.
3. ?The Clerks of Petty Sessions will be required to forward to the Colonial Treasurer, in Sydney, or to the
Sub-Treasurer, at Melbourne, on the first and sixteenth days of every month, all sums received by them
under this notice during the preceding half month, with a list of the names and addresses of the persons
by whom the payments were made, and of those ia the United Kingdom for whose benefit the money is to
be applied. The amounts thus forwarded will be then paid into the Military Chest of this Colony by order
of His Excellency the Governor, who will forward to the Right Honorable the Secretary of State, Certifi-
cates of the payments and copies of the Lists.
4.?The suras paid into the Military Chest will be placed by order of the Lords of the Treasury, at the credit
of the Land and Emigration Commissioners, who will apply the money in providing passages to the Colony
for the parties named in the Lists,
s. ?ln cases ia which it may be expected that the parties intended to emigrate, may be enabled themselves to
raise from their own resources, or by the assistance of others, a portion of their passage money, their friends
in the colony may not consider it necessary to remit a sum sufficient to pay the whole cost of the passage.
In all such instances it must be understood, that the Commissioners will only undertake to apply to the
best advantage for the benefit of the parties, such sums as may be furnished to them either by remittances
from the Colony, or by contributions in the Mother Country, and not to provide passages in cases where
the money placed in their hands is insufficient for the purpose.
6.?ln any case in which the amount remitted may exceed that required for the payment of the intending Emi-
grant?s passage, the balance will either be paid to the Emigrant, or returned to the person who made the
remittance, according to the directions which may be given by the latter, but in order to prevent this ar-
rangement being used for the purpose of making remittances unconnected with Emigration, it is necessary
to state, that the Commissioners will not undertake to make payments of money in England, to any persons
but those for whom they have provided passages to this colony.
7.?For the information of persons who may desire to make remittances under this regulation, it is hereby
notified, that the cost of steerage passages to this Colony under the Commissioners? Contracts, will not be
likely to exceed fourteen pounds for persons above the age of fourteen years. For persons under the age of
fourteen years half-price only is charged. The cost of outfit for the voyage is estimated as follows, in the
latest publication of the Commissioners which has reached the Colony ;
Fur a Single Man about .-Cl 10 0
For a Single Woman ........ ~ �3OO
For a Married Couple ? �9 0 0
The cost of an outfit for children varies with their size. Generally speaking, three children under 7, or
two between that age and 14, may be clothed for about �5 ; but a well-grown girl or boy of 13 years of age will
coat nearly as much as an adult.
B.?As it must be expected that the limited funds at the disposal of the Government will oblige the Colonial
Land and Emigration Commissioners to reject for a time many eligible applicants for free passsges to this
Colony, His Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has further directed it to be
notified, that residents ia this country may secure a preference for such of their own relatives or friends as
may be in every respect qualified under the Commissioners? General Regulations, for free passages, by con-
tributing and remitting, ia the manner above provided for, the undermentioned sums, viz.:?
For each person of the age of 14 years and upwards �8 0 0
For each person between the ages of 1 and 14 years �4 0 0
The remainder of the cost of the passage, which will amount to about one-third, will be defrayed by the
Government.
The subjoined Notice (Schedule B.) will show the descriptions of persons who are eligible for free pas-
sages under the Commissioners? Regulations, and who will be entitled to the benefit of the rule laid down in
this clause.
9,?The Balance of the passage-money will also be granted, subject to the conditions below stated, to persons
depositing the under-mentioned sums towards the payment of the passages to this Colony of able-bodied
labourers or tradesmen and their families who, though ineligible for free passages under the General Regula-
tions, may be considered of such a description as to justify a limited contribution from the Land Revenue
towards their introduction ;
For each person of the ages of 14 years and upwards .�lO 0 0
For each person between the ages of 1 and 14 years ....�5 0 0
But no deposits will be received under this clause without a written authority from the Government, to be
produced by the Depositor at the time of tendering his money, and the allowance of the balance of the
passage money will, in every instance, depend upon the approval of the Colonial Land and Emigration
Commissioners, after the enquiry which they will make in each case respecting the persons nominated.
(For forms of application under this Clause, see Schedules C and D, annexed .)
The above Regulations are to take effect at the commencement of the ensuing year.

description, and going out with the intention of settling in the Colony.

above, who have not the means of paying their own passage.
Reduced Tradesmen and persons resident in a Workhouse, or in the habitual receipt of parish relief are
not considered eligible for a free passage.
Description of Family, and Age.
s.?The Emigrants must consist principally of married couples, not above forty years of age at their last
birth-day : but for every child above fourteen, an excess of one year will be allowed in the age of the
parents, if they are still hale and capable of labor, The candidates? most acceptable are young couples
who have no children.
6, No family can be taken which includes three children under seven?or four under ten years of age. The
separation of parents from children under eighteen, will in no case be allowed.
7. Single women, uffder eighteen, without their parents, are not admissable unless they are emigrating under

ladies going out as cabin passengers in the same ship,
B,?Single men cannot be allowed, except in a number not exceeding that of the single women in the same
ship. If named by a person who has deposited money in this Country for the purchase of Land, they

single women who conform to regulation 7,
9.?A1l Emigrants, Adults as well as children, must have been vaccinated, or have had the Small Pox.
10.?The Commissioners are occasionally able to allow Relatives of Emigrants accepted for free passages
although those relatives may be themselves ineligible, under the Regulations to be' conveyed at the public
expense, an option of proceeding in the same vessel on paying the expense of their passages; but this
must entirely depend on the space available in the Ship, and on the Commissioners? discretion.
Character.
ll.?Good character is indispensable, and decisive certificates will be required both to this point, and also tq
competence in professed trade or calling of proposed Emigrant,
Form of Application,
12. All applications must be made in the form hereto annexed, which must be duly filled up and attested,
as explained in the form itself, and then forwarded to this office, with Baptismal and Marriage Certificates.
Should it be found that the signatures attached to the certificates are not genuine, or that any other
deception is attempted, the application will be rejected ; or should any Emigrant on personal examination
at the Port of Embarkation, be discovered to have made any mis-statement whatever with regard to age,
calling, health, &c., such person will not be allowed to proceed in the Ship.
14. The nomination of Laborers for a free passage by Land purchasers, will be subject to the approval of the
Commissioners, whose answer must be received before the Emigrants are led to make any preparation.
Proceedings subsequent to application and approval.
15.?1f approved of, the Emigrants will be so informed, and will receive a passage as soon as the arrangements
of the Commissioners will admit. But due notice will be given to them of the Ship by which they are
to sail, and of the time appointed for sailing; and unless they receive such notice, they must, on no
account, withdraw from their employment, or make any preparation for departure. Those who fail to
attend to this warning, will do so at their own risk, and will have no claim whatever on the Commissioners.
Ifi-?The expense of reaching the Port of Embarkation must be paid by the Emigrants.
17.?Before the Embarkation Order, entitling them to a Passage, is issued, �1 must be paid for every person
above 14, and 10s. for every child above 1 and under 14 which will be retained to meet the expense of
Bedding and Mess Utensils, which will be supplied for them.
18.?If any Emigrants fail to attend at the appointed time and place for embarkation, they will never again
be allowed a free passage, and will forfeit any money that may have been paid, unless they give to the
Commissioners timely notice and a satisfactory reason of their inability to proceed.
19.?Provisions and Cooking Utensils will be found. The Emigrants will also be provided with new Mattresses,
Bolsters, Blankets, and Counterpanes, and with Canvass Bags intended to contain one Month?s Linen, &c.;
likewise with a Knife and Fork, two Spoons, a metal Plate, and a Drinking Mug, the whole of which
articles may be kept by the Emigrants after arrival in the Colony. But they must bring their own sheets
and Towels, and also a supply of Soap.
20.?The Emigrants must bring their own Clothing, which will be inspected at the Port by an Officer of the
Commissioners ; and all parties are particularly desired to observe that they will not be allowed to embark
unless they provide themselves with a sufficient supply for their health during the voyage. The lowest
quantity that can be admitted for each person is as follows
For Males.
For Females.
Six Shirts
Six Shifts
Six pairs Stockings
Two ditto Shoes
Two complete suits of
Two Flannel Petticoats
Six pairs Stockings
Two ditto Shoes
Two Gowns
exterior Clothing.
As a general rule, it may be stated that the more abundant the stock of Clothing, the better for health
and comfort during the passage. The usual length of the voyage to the Australian Colonies is about four
months, and at whatever season of the year it may be made, the Emigrants have to pass through very hot
and very cold weather, and should therefore be prepared for both.
21.?1t is desirable that Emigrants should take out with them the necessary tools of their Trades ; bulky,
Agricultural Implements, however,'cannot be admitted, on account of their inconvenience, size, and weight - ;
neither can Furniture be received on board; Mattresses especially, and Feather Beds are strictly prohibited?
22.?The whole quantity of Baggage for each Adult Emigrant must not measure more than 20 cubic or solid
feet, nor exceed half a ton weight. It must he divided into two or three boxes, of not more than 2� or
3 feet long, by about 20 inches wide and 18 inches high. People should not crowd the Ship with boxes
only half filled, and must pack their effects close. Large packages and extra baggage will not be taken
unless paid for, and only in case there be room in the Ship.
23.?0n1y the luggage really belonging to each family of Passengers is intended to be taken under the
foregoing allowance. If any one should attempt to impose on the Commissioners by letting the baggage
of other persons, not members of his family, go under his name, he will forfeit his passage, and not
be suffered to proceed.
24.?The Emigrants will be at perfect liberty to engage themselves to any one willing to employ them, and
to make their own bargain for wages in the Colony; No repayment is required from them for the
passage out. The only return expected is a strict observance, on board, of the Regulations framed with
a view to their health and comfort during the voyage, and general good conduct and industrious habits
in the Colony.
25.?Letters and Applications should be addressed, post-paid, to Stephen Walcott, Esquire, Secretary to
the Board of Emigration, No. 9, Park-street, Westminster.

than Five Pounds each, and on all money so deposited there will be allowed Interest at the rate of Five per
cent, per annum for any period, not exceeding Five years from the date of the Deposit, during which the

Ist January and the Ist July in each year.

for the purchase of a further portion of Land, and the Receipt will be returned with an Endorsement
stating the extent to which it has been used.
s.?Receipts for Deposits under this notice will be transferable, but they must be transferred by endorsement?

if they are still hale, and capable of labour. the candidates most acceptable are young couples, who have no
Children.


/q. s.
6. No family can be taken which includes three children under seven?or four under ten years of age
The separation of parents from children under eighteen, will in no case be allowed.
7 ?Single women under eighteen, without their parents, are not admissrble, unless they are emigrating
under the immediate care of some near married relatives, or are under engagement, as domestic servants, to
ladies going out as cabin passengers in the same ship. .
8? Single men cannot be allowed, except in a number not exceeding that of the single women, in the same
ship If named by a person who has deposited money in this country for the purchase of Land, they can only be
accepted if eligible in other respects, in case the same party has named an equal number of single women who
conform to regulation 7. . A T ,
9 All Emigrants, Adults as well as Children, must have been vaccinated, or have had the Small Pox.
10 ?The Commissioners are occasionally able to allow Relatives of Emigrants accepted for free passages,
although those Relatives may be themselves ineligible, under the Regulations, to be conveyed at the public
expense, an option of proceeding in the same vessel, on paying the expense of their passages ; but this must
entirely depend on the space available in the Ship and on the Commissioners discretion.
Character.
11?Good character is indispensable, and decisive certificates will be required both to this point, and also
to competence in the professed trade or calling of the proposed Emigrant.
Form of Application.
12.?A1l applications must he made in the form hereto annexed, which must be duly filled up and attested,
as explained in the Form itself, and then forwarded to this Office, with Baptismal and Marriage Certificates.
13_ Should it be found that the Signatures attached to the Certificates are not genuine, or that any other
deception is attempted, the application will be rejected; or should any Emigrant, on personal examination, at
the Port of Embarkation, be discovered to have made any mis-statement whatever, with regard to age, calling,
health, &c? such Person will not be allowed to proceed in the Ship. .
14 The nomination of Labourers, for a free passage, by Land Purchasers, will be subject to the approval
of the Commissioners, whose answer must be received before the Emigrants are led to make any preparation.
Proceedings subsequent to Application and Approval.
15 ?lf approved of, the Emigrants will be so informed, and will receive a passage as soon as the arrange-
ments of the Commissioners will admit. But due notice will be given to them of the Ship by which they are
to sail, and of the time appointed for sailing ; and, unless they receive such notice, they must, on no account,
withdraw from their employment, or make any preparation for departure. Those who fail to attend to this
warning, will do so at their own risk, and will have no claim whatever on the Commissioners.
16.?The expense of reaching the Port of embarkation must be paid by the Emigrants.
17?Before the Embarkation Order, entitling them to a Passage, is issued, � I must be paid for every
person above 14, and 10s. for every child above 1 and under 14, which will be retained to meet the expense of
Bedding and Mess Utensils which will be supplied for them. ...
18. If any Emigrants fail to attend at the appointed time and place of embarkation, they will nevei
acrain be allowed a free passage, and will forfeit any money that may have been paid, unless they give to the
Commissioners timely notice and a satisfactory reason of their inability to proceed.
19. ?Provisions and Cooking Utensils will be found. The Emigrants will also be provided with new
Mattresses, Bolsters. Blankets, and Counterpanes, and with Canvas Bags intended to contain one Months
Linen, &c.; likewise with a Knife and Fork, two Spoons, a metal Plate, and a Drinking Mug, the whole of
which articles may be kept by the Emigrants after arrival in the Colony. But they must bring their own
Sheets, and Toivels, and also a supply of Soap. . . . . Am,,,,,.
20?The Emigrants must bring their own Clothing, which will be inspected at the Port by an Officer
of the Commissioners ; and all parties are particularly desired to observe that they will not be allowed to
embark unless they provide themselves with a sufficient supply for their health during the voyage. The lowest
quantity that can be admitted for each Person is as follows :
U 1 For Males. . . Females.
Six Shirts j Six Shifts
Sis pairs Stockings Two Flannel Petticoats
Two ditto Shoes i Six pairs Stockings
Two complete suits of exterior ! Two ditto Shoes
Clothing. 1 Two Gowns
As a general rule, it may be?stated that the more abundant the stock of Clothing, the better for health and
comfort during the passage. The usual length of the voyage to the Australian Colonies is abou four month*
and at whatever season of the year it may be made, the Emigrants have to pass through very hot and very cold
weather, and should therefore be prepared for both. . ? , ,
21? It is desirable that Emigrants should take out with them the necessary Tools of their Trades; bulky
Agricultural Implements, however, cannot be admitted, on account of their inconvenient size and weight ;
neither can Furniture be received on board ; Mattresses especially, and Feather Beds are strictly prohibited,
22 The whole quantity of Baggage for each Adult Emigrant must not measure more than 20 cubic or
solid feet, nor exceed half a ton weight. It must be divided into two or three boxes, of not more than 2 2 or 3
feet long, by about 20 inches wide and 18 inches high. People should not crowd the Ship with Boxes on y
half filled, and must pack their effects close. Large packages and extra baggage will not be taken unless paid
for, and only in case there be room in the Ship. . ~ , , , ,
23 Only the luggage really belonging to each family of Passengers is intended to be taken under the
foregoing allowance.' If any one should attempt to impose on the Commissioners by letting the baggage of
other persons, not members of his family, go under his name, he will forfeit his passage, and not be suffered to
P 24?The Emigrants will be at perfect liberty to engage themselves to any one willing to employ them ;
and to make their own bargain for wages in the Colony. No repayment is required from them for the passage
out. The only return expected is a strict observance, on board, of the Regulations framed with a view to their
health and comfort during the voyage, and general good conduct and industrious habits in the Colony.
25?Letters and Applications should be addressed, Post-paid, to Stephen Walcott, Esquire, Secretary to the
Board of Emigration, No. 9, Park Street, Westminster.
