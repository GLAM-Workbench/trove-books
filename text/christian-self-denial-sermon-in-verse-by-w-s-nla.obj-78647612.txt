CHRISTIAN SELF-DENIAL ;
A SERMON IN VERSE.
w. s. s.
Crucifixe, fac me fortem,
Ut libenter tuam mortem
Plangam donec vixero;
Tecum volo vulnerari,
Te libenter amplexari
In cruce desidero.




QUIET summer eve ; a placid lake
Deep set amid encircling hills, whose hues
Of slate and purple, gleaming eut from green,
Now warm?d with laughing light, now gloom'd to grey
Beneath the shadow of a passing cloud ;
A stone built village, and a little church,
Standing amid the mounds of grassy graves
Like silent shepherd ?mid a sleeping flock, ?
Such was the scene.
Two lovers, lately wed,
And lovers still, walk?d by the water?s marge :
And thus the husband spake ; ? My darling wife,
I sometimes tremble at our happiness ;
You know that saying, summing Scripture truth,
No Cross, No Crown ; and, love, what cross h�ve we ??
io him with tender look his wife replied,
? God portions ont the bitter and the sweet,
And ail our times are in His hand ; ?tis well
To take the joy He gives, and when He gives,
Oft meant methinks to be a memory
On which, in after trials sore and sharp,
The wearied heart may thankfully repose
And feel that God who gave the whilom joy
Will give the strength to bear the pr�sent cross.
We gather flowers now, the time may corne
When God will lay a sterner yoke upon us
And bid us ply our feet in toilsome dust,
Or scar them with the piercing thorns of woe,


Or weary them in wanderings of care, ?
But hark ! ?the chiming of the bel! ??tis time
To take the churchward pathway,?let us go.?
The preacher was a man of many years ;
Thin locks of snowy whiteness flutter?d soft
Around his aged head ; his wrinkled brow
Show?d traces of a conflict long gone by,
But now succeeded by a reign of peace.
Well fitted he to speak, as one who knew
The words of life. Not cloquent, indeed,
Nor wise was he, weigh?d in the balances
�f worldly estimation, but he knew
What God had taught him by His Spirit?s pow'r
And by the workings of His Providence.
To him the Bible was a living book,
Not a carv?d cabinet of costly work
Which men admire but rarely open ; ?no,
A storeroom, rather, stock?d with needful food,
Cordials and medicines for daily use ;
A necessary chart, more priz?d than prais'd ;
A weapon from an armoury divine,
Wielded in warfare not imaginary,
Against a varied front of subtle foes.
The text was from the words of J�sus Christ
To every one who would corne after Him.
Let him deny himself, so saith the Lord,
Let him take up his cross and follow me.
? Brethren,? the preacher said, and solemnly
Sounded to ail his grave and earnest voice,
? Ye who are Christ?s (and this ye ail profess)
What think you of your Master?s warning words ?
Do they not bid us conquer that low love
Of earth and earthly things that cramps our so�ls


And clips the wings of heavenward desires ?
Do they not sound like trumpet in the van,
Proclaiming conflict imminent for ail,
And each true heart is stirr?d to courage new,
And only cowards quail ? The Master saith,
Away with slothful self-complacency,
Away with worldly aims and dainty dreams
Of luxury and wealth ; corne, follow Me ;
First bear the cross, then wear the glorious crown ;
First tread the thorn, then sit upon the throne.
? And many h�ve obey?d Him unto death ;
Cruel tormentings fail?d to shake their faith ;
The hurled stone, the axe, the raging fire,
The rav?ning beasts, and yet more furious men,
Who greedy claim?d for public spectacle
The Christians to the lions , could not b�te
The ardour of their self-denying love
To Him who died and gave Himself for them
Upon the bitter cross : they too were fain
To sacrifice themselves for their dear Lord,
Unmindful at what cost, as knowing well
Themselves redeem?d with His own precious blood,
More costly price than heav?n and earth in one,
And freely spent, in love unmerited,
Love for a sinful and rebellious world.
? And many h�ve obey?d Him with a life
Devoted to the work of heralding
His saving Name, ?the message of God?s truth
Sent to so�ls ignorant and sad and dark, ?
Like Paul of Tarsus who, in p�rils oft
On land and sea, mid brethren faint or false,
Still gloried in the Cross of Christ, and bore
Upon his worn and wearied frame the marks


Of J�sus crucified.* Unmov?d by fear
Of bonds and pers�cutions waiting him
In ev?ry city where he went, he wish?d
This only, that he might fulfil with joy,
The joy of patient self-devotion, ail
That God had laid on him of ministry
To spread the glad evangel of God?s love.
? Others, with meaning good but action rash,
Vex?d with the evil of their �ge, h�ve left
The haunts of men, and in some desert cave
Or lonely and inhospitable waste
H�ve spent long dreary days and weary nights
In self-imposed penance, fain to quit
The selfish vices and the vain turmoil
Of man?s world round them, and to seek among
The solitudes of mountain, moor, or wood
God?s company alone. Vain quest, alas !
For he who Aies from duty?s dangerous post
Flies from the comfort and the strength vouchsaf'd
To those who bravely wage th? appointed fight,
And finds, if not ? the world? he dreaded so,
That Satan and the flesh are active foes
E?en in the far off empty wilderness.
And yet those hermits, and, in after days,
?Mid cloister?d sanctuaries, monks and nuns
Had oft at heart the lesson Christ would teach
To ail who would His true disciples be,
Let him deny himself ; so said the Lord,
Daily take iip his cross and follow me.
? ? But what is that to us ?? some of ye cry,
? We are not martyrs, ministers, or monks ;
We may not aim at high heroic deeds ;
? Gai. vi. 17


From day to day we tread a toilsome round
Of trivial duties, intermix?d at times
With petty trials hardly worth the name :
What may we do to serve and follow Christ ??
? Brethren, ye speak not wisely speaking so.
No duty?s trivial dutifully done,
Nor trial of our temper and our faith
Can e?er be petty to the so�l that seeks
f he heights divine of truth and righteousness.
Ah ! wot ye not that in the battle field
Ail are not leaders ? will ye quit the ranks
Because ye are not in the front ? Nay, stand
And do your part with patience, for, be sure,
Bach fills a place most fitted for his strength,
And fighting there against his fronting foe
Will best deny himself and follow Christ.
? Others there are? (and, as the preacher spoke,
A softening gleam of golden memories
Lighted his aged face, ?as when one sees
Through a long avenue of leafy limes,
Hov?ring above the distant spire of a church,
Bright, radiant bars of cloud, richly suffus?d
With hues of sunset, soft and beautiful, ?)
? Others there are,? he said, ? whose pr�sent joy
Seems so apart from suffering and woe,
So full of rapture and of deepfelt peace,
That almost they begin to fear at thought
Of forfeiting the character of those
Who should take up the cross and follow Christ.
Yet let not such, if such perchance there be
Among my hearers now, deem it a wrong
To drink the cup of gladness giv?n by God :
Their very joy will bring to them ere long
A seasonahle measure of new pain ;


And ail their fresh responsibility
Will test anew the bent of heart and mind
In later conflicts of the growing so�l.
? My brethren, to deny ourselves means this
That we should bave our wills subdued to God?s,
God?s will reveal?d in Christ the crucified,
The sinless One who suffer?d, sorrow?d, died,
Who bore the bitter burden of the cross,
And pour?d the very life-flow of His heart
In mingled stream upon the Roman spear,
That we the sinful denizens of earth
Might heav?nly healing find, and learn of Him
That they do best the will of God above
Who sacrifice themselves for others? good.
? Nor this alone. A higher lesson yet
Shines from the Cross of Christ : for, as we gaze
At that strange mystery of life in death,
We see the meaning of the Master?s words
That losing life for God saves life, and is
The true nobility of Christ-like so�ls.
? To do the work that God has given us,
Whate?er, where?er it be ; to do the work
Unto the end, at cost of life and limb,
In spite of malice and of cruel fraud,
In spite of violence and treachery,
In spite of ail the varied forms of sin
And unbelief that mar and vex our world,
To find the very nourishment of life
In close obedience to our Father?s word,
And rather starve for want of earthly food
Than leave undone a single duty,?this
Is to deny ourselves and follow Christ.


? Yet more. To bear as well as do God?s will,
To find in suff?ring service, and to feel
That ail that He may put on us of pain
Or sorrow is a needed discipline ;
To see in darkest hours of agony
The path that leads to light, and to behold
Beyond the cross, ?yea, on it even now, ?
The glory shining from the golden gates
Of God?s eternal city, and to cry,
When worst the burden weigheth down the so�l,
My God, as Christ did, ?this, my brethren, ?is
A true d�niai of our sinful self,
A taking of the cross to follow Christ.
? Patience with zeal ; with fervour, self-restraint ;
A bridle put upon the undue haste
And wilfulness of proud imaginings ;
Amid ail joys a soberness of so�l
That learns the limits of our earthly bliss,
Using the world as not abusing it,
And keeps God ever in the foremost place,
As ground and aim of highest happiness ;
Amid calamities a will resigned,
Not apathetic but submissive still
To ail the will of God, ?such character
Pertains to those who would deny themselves,
Daily take up their cross and follow Christ.
? And Christian love is but the highest form
Of Christian self-denial, when the heart
? At leisure from itself ? can bound with joy
Or beat with woe at others? joy or woe ;
And when the mind, kept free from selfish aims,
Can bend its powers to benefit the world
While yet the world regards it not, or looks
With scorn on the divine philanthropy."


The preacher paus'd ; then, looking upward, thus
Converted exhortation into prayer :
? O blessed Jesu, who didst bear Thy cross
Patient, amid the rude and curious crowd
That throng?d the plaintive path to Golgotha,
Help us to follow Thee, that we with faith
May do and suffer ail our Father?s will,
Not shrinking from the threats or taunts of men,
Nor yielding to the world?s false flattery
Which oft would gloze the sin of selfishness
And call it prudence, teaching us to hold
As foremost virtue self-aggrandizement.
? But Thou, O Saviour, from Thy throne on high
Help us with inner strength to bear our cross
And know that then the glory nearest is
When we forget ourselves to serve ourGod.
Help us to love Thee first and best, dear Lord,
And then in Thee to spread our sympathy
To ail our fellow men?help us to work,
And speak, and suffer for Thy Holy Name,
Until the hour of darkness pass away,
And we, within Thy Zion?s pearly gates,
Safe by Thy side, triumphant evermore,
Regard as steps unto that height of joy
The bitter cup and baptism of blood.?
Another pause, and then in earnest tones
He closed with words of blessing.
For a space
Deep silence seemed to tremble thro? the church,
While many a heart was bow?d in secret prayer ;
Then, gently breathing thro? that solemn hush,
The organ softly sounded, touch?d by one
In whom was humble melody of heart


Accordant vvith the music from her hands,
Music that said a reverent Amen
To ail the service that had gone before.
The people left the church, and some were soon
Forgetful of their recent seriousness :
But those two lovers, linked arm in arm.
In grave and quiet converse homeward vvent.
