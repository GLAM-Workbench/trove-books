These Lecturers constitute the Theological Faculty, whose
function it is to admit students to the Theological Hall in
accordance with the regulations hereinunder set forth, to arrange
the order of the classes and the hours of attendance, to keep a
register of the attendance of students, and to see that the required
curriculum of study is gone through by the students, and to have


an oversight over all matters pertaining to the course of study and
the discipline of the Hall.
Special arrangements are also made for teaching Elocution
to the students of the Hall, and also for instruction in Church
Law and Forms of Procedure.
2. The General Assembly appoints each year a Board
■of Examiners, whose duties are to prescribe subjects, prepare
examination papers, and conduct the examinations required

Hall, and to make temporary provision for the same, and report

officio members of this Committee.
4. The Treasurership Committee are ex officio Trustees for
the Funds of the Theological Hall, and the Chairman of this
Committee is authorised to receive all legacies, bequests,
donations, and other moneys falling to the Theological Hall, and
to give a full discharge for the same.
5. The Theological f aculty, the Board of Examiners, and
the Theological Hall Committee each report annually to the
General Assembly.


FOR ADMISSION TO THE THEOLOGICAL HALL.
6. Every candidate for admission to the Theological Hall
must first make application to the Presbytery within whose
bounds he resides. This application must be accompanied with
a certificate as to moral and religious character from the minister
of the congregation of which the applicant is a member; and
also with certificates as to the applicant’s previous training and
educational attainments. If the Presbytery, after enquiry, are
fully satisfied as to the applicant’s eligibility, and also as to his
probable fitness for ministerial work, the application shall be
recommended, and along with the accompanying certificates shall
be forwarded by the Clerk of the Presbytery to the General
Assembly’s Board of Examiners.
7, Every applicant for admission to the Theological Hall
must produce to the Board of Examiners evidence of his having
graduated in Arts, or of having attended the lectures of the first
year of the Arts Course and passed the first year’s examination
in Arts, including Greek, in the University of Sydney. Students
coming from other Universities, and not being graduates, are
required to pass an examination under the General Assembly’s
Board of Examiners in Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Logic, and
English Literature. Certificates of having passed University
Examinations in any of these subjects will be accepted pro tanto.
In addition to the above, every applicant for admission to
the Theological Hall is required to pass an Entrance Examination
by the General Assembly’s Board of Examiners in the following
subjects, viz.:
1. Old and New Testament History. Text Book : The
Bible.
2. Elements of Scriptural Doctrine. Text Book: The
Shorter Catechism.
3. Elements of Hebrew Grammar.
If the Board of Examiners are satisfied in all these respects,
a certificate to that effect will be furnished to the applicant, who,
on presenting the same to the Theological Faculty, will be


admitted and enrolled as a Student of Theology within the
Theological Hall.
THE THEOLOGICAL CURRICULUM.
8. The Curriculum of Studies within the Theological Hall
extends over a period of three sessions of about five months each.
The Session of the Theological Hall coincides with the Lent and
Trinity Terms of the University of Sydney, and extends from the
third Monday of March to the third Saturday of August, with a
vacation of two weeks between the terms.’ The Classes in the
Theological Hall meet at such times and places as are arranged
by the Theological Faculty, in conjunction with the Theological
Hall Committee.
9. At the close of each Session of the Theological Hall, the
Students are required to present themselves for examination by
the Board of Examiners; and Students will not be allowed to
advance from the first year to the second or from the second to
the third until they shall have satisfied the said Board and
received their certificate. Further, each Student is required to
report himself at a meeting of his own Presbytery as soon as
convenient after having obtained a certificate, and report the
progress he has made in his studies, as w r ell as the practical work
in which he has been engaged; and the Presbytery shall give him
such counsel and encouragement as may be deemed advisable.
10. During each long vacation or inter-session all the
Students of the Theological Hall are required to exercise them-
selves in conducting services and addressing meetings, so as to
acquire some practical experience in public speaking, and in the
various departments of Church Work. Arrangements are made
for this object by the Presbytery of the bounds within which the
Student resides, and certificates as to the work done in this
connection are granted to the Students by the Presbytery for
presentation at the Exit Examination.
11. In the case of Students who have not taken a degree in
Arts, it is also required that at some period of their Theological
course such Students attend a course of University Lectures


or of University Extension Lectures in Logic and Mental
Philosophy, and also a course of Lectures in Moral Philosophy-
in St. Andrew’s College, except in cases where these subjects have
been studied before; and certificates of the same must be
produced at the Exit Examination.
12. On the completion of their third Session at the
Theological Hall, Students may present themselves for the Exit
Examination. Every Student on presenting himself for the
Exit Examination must produce to the Board of Examiners a
certificate from the Theological Faculty showing his attendance
at the Theological Hall, and his satisfactory performance of the
duties thereof; also a certificate from die Presbytery as to the
practical work done during the inter-session ; and in the case of
Students who are not graduates, certificates of attendance on
Lectures in Logic and Mental Philosophy, and in Moral
Philosophy, as required in Regulation No. n. The Student
shall then be admitted to the Exit Examination, and on his
satisfying the Examiners in the several subjects, he shall receive
from the Board of Examiners a certificate to that effect.
13. Having passed satisfactorily the Exit Examination, the
Student must next make application to the Presbytery of the
bounds within which he resides to be taken on trials for license.
This application must be accompanied with the certificate of the
Board - of Examiners, and also with the other certificates
submitted to the Board of Examiners at the Exit Examination.
The Presbytery requires also, at this stage, evidence to be
produced as to the Student’s moral and religious character,
together with a certificate showing that he has reached the age
of twenty-one years. The Presbytery, being thoroughly satisfied
on these points, either reports to the General Assembly and asks
permission to take the Student on trials for license, or, if the
Session of Assembly be more than three months distant, sends
circulars to the several Presbyteries of the Church, stating that
it is proposed to admit the Student to trials. If any Presbytery
object, the case must be referred to the General Assembly; but,
if no Presbytery object within two months, or if the General


Assembly give permission, the Student is admitted to trials.
The Presbytery then prescribes subjects for a sermon, an
•exposition, a lecture, and an exegesis, and appoints a time and
place for the delivery of the sermon or the exposition or the
lecture, which may be either before the Presbytery in court
assembled, or before some Congregation of the Church in the
presence of a Commission of the Presbytery. The Presbytery
may also, if it deems expedient, examine the applicant on any
subject in his past course of study. If the Presbytery is fully
satisfied as to the applicant’s fitness for the work of the
Ministry the trials are sustained and the Presbytery may proceed
at once to license him as a preacher of the Gospel.
14. Students of Theology of this Church have the option of
attending one or more Sessions of the Theological Hail of
Ormond College, Melbourne, or any of the Theological Halls or
Colleges of the Presbyterian Churches of the United Kingdom ;
and certificates of attendance at any of these Halls or Colleges
will be accepted pro tanto. Students from any of these Halls or
Colleges will, on presenting their certificates, be admitted ad
eundem s tat uni.
15. The above regulations apply to all ordinary cases. Any
case of an exceptional character is first brought before a
Presbytery and enquired into; and if the exceptional circum-
stances be such as in the judgment of the Presbytery warrant it,
the Presbytery refers the case to the General Assembly to be
dealt with as the General Assembly may see fit.

GOOERVGbb AGABEMY.
FOUNDATION.
The Academy was built by the late Andrew Brown, Esq.,
J.P., of Cooerwull, Bowenfells, a Councillor of St. Andrew’s
College, and an esteemed Elder of the Church, who, with praise-
worthy liberality, handed the property over to the Council of
St. Andrew’s College, in trust, for the purposes of education.
Under the present arrangements the Rector has no financial
interest in the household, and the names of the Councillors,
combined with the absence of shareholders, afford a guarantee
to the public of the unspeculative nature of the management.
ACCOMMODATION.
The School Buildings are extensive. In addition to the
ordinary class rooms, dormitories, <kc., the premises provide a large
Dining Hall, a Museum, a Science Room, and a well-appointed
Gymnasium and Laundry.
The Academy Grounds (freehold and leasehold), 86 acres
in extent, afford ample accommodation for Cricket, Football,
Tennis, and other outdoor sports. The School Hospital—on the
leasehold land —is at some distance from the main buildings.
The Shower and Swimming Baths have been enlarged—
dimensions 36 feet x 12 feet.
OBJECTS.
The main objects are: To provide high-class instruction, to
foster a spirit of manly self-reliance, to create a healthy public
spirit, to encourage that habit of work and thought without which
there can be no success, and, by the inculcation of Christian
principles, to do the work of a British Public School in turning
out truly educated gentlemen.
With these ends in view the School is made a home in
which religious instruction, mental training, physical exercise,
and occasional entertainment all take their appointed places.

©PRESBYTERIAN LCADIBS’ (©OLLiEGB
FOUNDATION AND OBJECT.
The College was founded in 1888 by the Presbyterian
Church, to provide a Christian education of the highest class
for girls. It is, however, unsectarian in its character, and its
advantages are open to all denominations. It was instituted
solely in the interests of education, and not for the purpose
■of money-making, and the whole revenue is devoted to the
improvement of the means of education within the College.
There are no shareholders, and no dividends. This enables the
Council to treat the students with unusual liberality, as all those
■capable of judging are only too willing to attest. The Council,
indeed, hopes that it has founded an institution which will become
a factor in the making of Australia, and though it is early
yet to prognosticate success, signs are not wanting that the
College is projecting no uncertain shadow into the future.
SITUATION AND SURROUNDINGS.
The buildings are situated on the heights of Croydon, three
minutes’ walk from the Railway Station, and are a prominent
feature to the visitor as soon as he quits the station at the
western end.
The grounds are upwards of six acres in extent, and there is
a gradual slope on all sides, ensuring excellent drainage. The
garden is laid out in lawns and quiet walks, and has abundant
shade, while the number and variety of shrubs and plants are
intended to provide an ever-changing object lesson in horticul-
ture, which the dullest pupil imbibes—unconsciously, perhaps,
but none the less surely.
ADMISSION OF PUPILS.
Admission to the College, either as a boarder or a day-
scholar, is not a matter of course. With respect to boarders
particularly, the greatest care is exercised to eliminate all elements


from which prudent mothers would endeavour to save their girls.
This exclusiveness has cost the College dear, financially, but it is
one of those points in which, as years pass, parents will recognise
the superiority of an institution of this kind over the ordinary
private school, where, in such questions, pecuniary considerations
are allowed more weight. References are required, in all cases,
before pupils are admitted. Parents to whom this regulation may
cause some annoyance, as they may be well known in their own
neighbourhoods, are courteously reminded that the application of
the rule to all proves a safeguard to their own daughters.
THE COLLEGE AS A SCHOOL AND HOME.
The house contains about seventy rooms, which are arranged
and furnished so as to secure, in the best manner, and in the
highest degree, the comfort, the convenience, and the education
of the pupils.
Eighteen rooms are set apart for school purposes, comprising
school hall, 70 x 35, studio and gymnasium, 60 x 22, numerous
classrooms, lavatories, and music rooms. The furniture of the
school hall has been specially imported from America, and has
been designed to prevent or correct the evils of short sight, round
shoulders, etc. There is a science room fitted up with an
excellent laboratory, fossils, rocks, shells, etc. The building
is so large that there is no want of room in any direction,
and overcrowded classrooms, with the concomitant evils of
vitiated air and tired, pale faces, are impossible. The greatest
care has been taken to secure plenty of light, and there is a
constant supply of pure air, not only in the classrooms, but
in every apartment in the house. Most of the bedrooms contain
only two beds. There are no dormitories. There are numerous
bathrooms, provided with hot and cold water. The passages are
all wide and airy, the verandahs broad and ample.
All the social and household arrangements—all the inner life
of the college—are modelled on those of a well-regulated home,
and boarders are treated, as far as is consistent with school dis-
cipline, as though members of the Principal’s family. The aim


of the establishment is to supply surroundings and accessories
which will contribute to the good training, comfort, and happiness
of the students. The college is provided, as a precautionary
measure, with milk from its own cows, and the whole of the
laundry work is done on the premises. There is a large library
plentifully stored with good books, where the pupils may obtain
quiet and instruction. Appliances are provided for various in-
door games to while away the recreation hours of wet days or the
evening, but the students are encouraged to spend as much time
as possible in the open air. Two full-sized asphalt tennis courts
prove of great assistance in furthering this design. The old-
fashioned and always-disliked daily walk has been done away
with in the summer months, but there is no lack of compulsory
exercise. The boarders are expected to play a settled number of
sets of tennis or of some other game, involving an equal amount
of exercise, per week, and this is carefully supervised by one of the
resident staff.
The domestic arrangements are under the personal super-
vision of Mrs. Harden, who is assisted by a housekeeper. This
department is recognised as a very important one, and constant
vigilance is exercised in every branch of it. In the constantly
recurring fun-nights, break-ups, drawing-room evenings, etc., the
older girls are invited to assist in arranging flowers, decorating, or
receiving guests, thus getting practical instruction in a very
important part of duties likely to fall to their share later on.
There is a matron who superintends the toilets, health, and
wardrobes of the boarders. This lady takes no part in school-
work. Her general duties are to inculcate in the boarders a love
of order, as far as their dressing and bedrooms are' concerned,
and to teach them to mend and keep tidy the clothing they bring
from home. In case of sickness the Lady Superintendent
personally directs the diet, nursing, etc., of the patients, and the
matron acts under her instructions. The degree of attention and
care devoted to these domestic arrangements would, indeed, be
impossible did the college exist merely as a money-making enter-
prise. The boarders are limited to between forty and fifty in

number, while, besides the teaching staff, there is a permanent
staff of twelve servants, a housekeeper, and a matron,
METHODS OF TEACHING.
The aim of the College is to provide training for Christian
gentlewomen—a training which shall enable the girls who spend
a fair time within its walls to take up their position in life with
minds open to receive and intelligently assimilate the deeper
lessons which life brings, and adorned with the grace and breeding
which make the charm of refined womanhood. The idea that to
cram for examinations is the chief end and aim of school life is
carefully avoided; at the same time, the course of study
prescribed by the University for the various test examinations is
followed in the higher classes, and the past years have not been
barren of results in that direction.
One of the characteristics of the teaching is that each
teacher is confined as much as possible to a few subjects, which
can thus be thoroughly mastered and taught with an ease and
efficiency unattainable by those who distribute their efforts over a
variety of subjects. In this way young pupils, as well as the
more advanced students, have the advantage of being taught by
teachers thoroughly conversant with the subject in hand, and, as
they advance in the school, they are still under the eye and
guidance of the person who initiated them into the elements.
In the lowest classes the number of subjects taught is
limited, in the middle classes it is very varied, and in the
highest classes students are encouraged to narrow the limits
again.
PRINCIPAL’S CONTROL OF THE WHOLE OF THE
TEACHING.
The mistresses are allowed a certain amount of license as to
the manner in which the instruction is imparted, but the amount
communicated from year to year is regulated by a fixed scheme,
drawn up by the Principal, in such a way as to insure that a girl,
who passes through all the classes, leaves school with a mind well

VIEW OF THE COLLEGE FROM THE SOUTH.


stored with general knowledge, and with such an insight into one
or two subjects as should encourage her to pursue them further
with .advantage to herself and pleasure to those about her.
The work done is tested constantly by class examinations,
and, once a quarter, there is a more rigid examination of every
subject taught, the papers set being reviewed by the Principal, who
thus personally supervises what is done in all the classes. Copies
of the questions set half-yearly, together with reports of the marks
gained, are then forwarded to the parents, who are thus kept au
tour ant of the studies their daughters are pursuing.
MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.
Every effort is made to keep the tone of the school as high
as possible, and all recognition is given to the fact that the highest
and best can only result from holding up the life and character
of our Saviour, as alone worthy of unrestrained imitation.
Religious instruction is given regularly on Friday morning to the
whole school, the Principal taking the upper classes. The
Principal and Lady Superintendent give short Scripture lessons
on Sundays. The proceedings of every day are opened and
closed with Bible reading and prayer. As the instruction is
unsectarian in character (except that the Presbyterian Shorter
Catechism and the Catechism of the Episcopalian Church are
taught to the members of those churches who are boarders), all
pupils are required to attend, unless their parents have
conscientious scruples.
EDUCATIONAL SUCCESSES.
Though the College deprecates the idea that success at
public examinations is the best test of the thoroughness of the
education an institution yields, ir is pleased to chronicle that
many of its students have attained prominent positions at such
examinations.
In iSgo a student from the College won the Silver Medal
for French, awarded by the University to the candidate gaining


the highest marks at the Senior University Examination in that
subject.
In 1891 a student won the Silver Medal awarded under like
conditions for Geology in the Junior.
In 1893 students from the College won the Silver Medal
awarded under like conditions for Modern History, both in the
junior and Senior Divisions, whilst a third was proxime accessit
for the Senior History, and carried off the Geology Medal.
In 1894, at the March Matriculation Examination, a scholar-
ship of /50 for one year was awarded to a pupil of the College
for proficiency in Modern Languages. \t the Senior University
Examination in November, one student won the Fairfax prize ot
for general proficiency, a Silver Medal for English, a Silver
Medal for Modern History. The Silver Medal for Botany was
awarded to another of our ’students. The same year the Aus-
tralian Musical Association awarded a College Student a Gold
Medal for Pianoforte Playing (Senior Division).
In 1895, at the March Matriculation Examination, a student
from the College won the Grace Fraser Scholarship of for
three years, which is awarded to the girl candidate who gains the
highest proportion of all marks given. In November the Silver
Medal for Geography, given to the best Senior candidate, was
carried off by a pupil from the College.
The range of subjects covered to win these honours is, in
itself, a guarantee that they were not the result of any system of
cram. They were the legitimate outcome of a thorough system
of class-training, of which every pupil has the benefit, and it rests
with the students alone to secure a constant repetition of such
successes.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
This branch of woman’s education, always highly esteemed,
and to which there is now a sort of reaction from the strictly
academical tone of the last 20 years, is given a high place in our
system. Modern languages, literature, the fine arts are sedulously
cultivated. There are nearly a hundred pupils in music, for


which all the teachers are most carefully selected, and can all be
conscientiously recommended. The theory of music is taught
free of charge throughout the classes. Frequent concerts are
given at the College, where the advanced pupils often take
part with the professionals in contributing to the programme.
All pupils are encouraged at times to perform before their school-
fellows and teachers. The boarders are frequently taken to
concerts, and thus introduced to the best musical advantages
which our city offers.
The classes in drawing and painting are entirely under
the direction of Mr. J. A, Bennett, who has studied in the
Art Schools of London and Paris. The drawing is taught from
models and casts, no “ flat ” work being tolerated. This often
tries the patience of the beginner, but as it is the only true work y
no girl with a real taste for art would care to shirk it, and
it is only wise that those who shun this drudgery should
lay the subject aside. Much against the desire of the Principal
and of Mr. Bennett, more license is allowed with the painting.
This is because painting from nature requires a very long
apprenticeship ere any result is obtained, and the Master yields
to the unconquerable desire of the pupil or parent for a
pretty picture rather, than for real progress. But every girl
is encouraged to work from models and from real life.
The elocution class is under the able guidance of Mr.
Laurence Campbell, and already good results have followed his
efforts.
PHYSICAL EDUCATION.
There is a large and well-equipped gymnasium attached to the
College, and the department is under the charge of Mr. G.
Renshaw, physical instructor to the Y.M.C.A., Sydney, and to
all the good, schools in the colony.
MONTHLY HOLIDAYS.
About once a month the boarders are allowed to leave the
College on the Friday afternoon, and to remain away until the Mon-


day morning. This forms a pleasant break in the ordinary school
routine, and although it is not compulsory that girls shall leave the
College, the little holiday is of decided service, and does not
interfere at all with the serious work of the school. The Friday
afternoon on these occasions is a holiday to all scholars, except
those from whom it is purposely taken as a punishment for
neglected duties,

THE AURORA AUSTRALIS.
This is the name of the College newspaper, which is pub-
lished at the end of every quarter. It contains references to the
doings of both past and present pupils, thus promoting an esprit de
corps , whilst furnishing an outlet for literary aspirations. We are
glad to say that many ladies who, probably, made their first
appearance in literature as contributors to the College magazine.
still wield the pen at times in its favour.
DURATION OF TERMS.
The quarters, or terms, are of equal length ; there are.
namely, ten weeks in each, and this is a point in which the
Council is most careful not to break faith with the public. There
is consequently no reason in the remark, sometimes heard, that


any given quarter is shorter than another. In July the scholars
are re-classified, from which epoch the year’s marks are reckoned.
u Special Prizes ” are, however, given for the work from February
to December, in which month the distribution takes place. The
counting a year from July to June has been rendered necessary
by the alteration made in the time of year at which the
Junior University Examination takes place. Yearly re-
classification is the College custom ; the bulk of the
prizes is for class work ; the data for deciding prizes must stretch
over a year; the “ Junior” once over, the candidates need new
text books and more advanced teaching ; one class cannot be
moved without another.

THE SCOTS GOLLESE.
AIMS.
The Scots College was inaugurated by Lord Jersey in 1892
for the purpose of imparting a sound religious education, and to
afford the instruction necessary to fit boys for University and
other examinations, and for commercial pursuits.
SITUATED.
Situated on the summit of Bellevue Hill, which rises between
Double and Rose Bays, the College commands a wide extent of
country, the open sea, and the broad sweep of Sydney Harbour.
The surrounding grounds, eight acres in extent, are beautifully
laid out as flower and vegetable gardens, lawns and orchards ;
while in addition the playing fields are convenient and extensive.
THE HOUSE BUILDINGS.
The House Buildings are constructed on a scale of unusual
magnificence, and form one of the finest examples of domestic
architecture in New South Wales. The Main Hall, the Dining
Hall, and Reading Room are of noble proportions, while the
other apartments are of corresponding extent and elegance.
THE CHAPEL.
The Chapel, wherein Sunday Services are conducted by the
Principal, is by its structure and appointments suited to inspire
that reverence which is so essential an element of worship.
THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS.
The School Buildings are entirely separate at a convenient
distance from the house. They comprise six roomy and well-
appointed class-rooms built round two sides of a quadrangle,

which is roofed in and fitted up as a Gymnasium, together with a
large School Hall and Music Room. There is also a Chemical
and Physical Laboratory fitted with the usual modern apparatus.
THE HOUSE ARRANGEMENTS.
The house arrangements afford ample accommodation for
Boarders. The dormitory system is abandoned. Boys are dis-
tributed through a number of lofty and well-ventilated rooms,
each in charge of a Prefect, and under the personal supervision
of the Principal. The domestic affairs are controlled by Mrs.
Aspinall, aided by a competent Matron, An exceptionally
liberal table is provided, and every effort is made to maintain the
appearance and comfort of home life. Assiduous attention is
paid to health and sanitation.
THE CURRICULUM.
The Curriculum includes Divinity, English, History (Ancient
and Modern), Languages (Classical and Modern), Mathematics,
Science, Commercial Subjects, Music, Drawing, Painting and
Physical Training. As far as possible each subject is in the hands
of an expert throughout.
THE PREPARATORY SCHOOL.
The Preparatory School is under the direction of a specially-
trained Master, and is designed to impart that thorough funda-
mental training which is so essential to all true scholarship.
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.
Religious instruction is entirely in the hands of the Principal.
Each day opens and closes with devotional exercises ; and Scrip-
ture is taught to all boys not specially exempted. The Chapel
services are conducted according to the methods obtaining in the
great English Public Schools.

PHYSICAL TRAINING.
Physical training in a well-equipped gymnasium is given by a
special instructor Regular drill is given by a competent officer.
Every encouragement is, given to athletics. Cricket, Tennis,
Football, Swimrning and Boating Clubs are supervised at a 1 times
by a master. All boys must take part in Athletics, Gymnastics
and Drill (unless exempted by medical advice).
PREFECTS.
Prefects, who are boys of high character and principle, are
appointed as in the English Public Schools to promote a high
standard of conduct and discipline Boys are reminded that the
position of Prefect is the highest honour of school life.
AID TO MENTAL TRAINING.
As aids to mental training, lectures are given at frequent
intervals by friends of the College. Also from time to time the
Principal accompanies parties of boys to entertainments of a
desirable kind. A well-selected library has been formed, and
every effort is made to foster literary and cultivated tastes. Un-
tiring endeavours are made that the extreme beauty of the sur-
roundings may minister to refinement of character.
DAY BOARDERS.
Day Boarders dine with the Boarders and Masters. It is
very desirable that boys coming from a distance should take ad-
vantage of this arrangement.
THE COLLEGE COLOURS.
The College Colours are dark blue and gold. The hat-
band is formed of blue and gold squares, bearing the arms of the
College and the motto : Utinarn patribus nostris digni simus.”
Every boy must wear the usual hat and colours.


CADETS, BICYCLE CORPS-SCOTS COLLEGE.
