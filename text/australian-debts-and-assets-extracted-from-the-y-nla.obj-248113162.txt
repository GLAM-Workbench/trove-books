Australian ZBcfits anti Assets.
The rapidly accumulating debts of the Aus-
tralian colonies, within the last decade, have
awakened a feeling of disquietude on the part
of British investors. For many years the cap-
italists of England regarded colonial stocks
with increasing favor, until eventually, in 1889
and 1890, they were esteemed so highly that
many influential persons in the mother coun-
try gave their sanction to proposals to include
them in the list of securities open for selection
to trustees. Mr. Goschen’s Conversion
Scheme, by seriously reducing the interest
rate on British Consols, contributed to the
improvement in value of colonial stocks ; in
fact raising them so much in value that inves-
tors were prepared to lend on them at a price
which returned them interest at the rate of
barely 3£ per cent. Several loans were raised
at this figure, the colonies thus being benefitted
even more than the British Government by the
Conversion Scheme, at the expense of the capi-
talists of the mother country. On their merits
we believe that the colonial securities were
worth the price that was paid for them. But
a great change has since taken place in their
market value. This is mainly attributable to
other influences than those at work in the
colonies, although the position has undoubtedly
been aggravated by the continuous and inop-
portune expenditure of loan funds. The chief
reason for the reduced prices of colonial stocks
is the disorganization of the London money
market through the Baring’s disaster in 1890.
The consequent advance in discount rates, and
dear money generally, lowered the prices of all
Government securities, including those of Aus-
tralia. The syndicates who had bought our
stocks to resell were unable to hold when dis-
count rates rose higher than the interest yielded
by the stock. Forced thus to place the securi-
ties on the market, the price was reduced ; and
with fresh loans raised by the various Govern-
ments, and a general disinclination to buy, the
prices of the securities have not only not risem
but have further declined, until at the present
time they are below the quotations ruling
before the Conversion Scheme. Though within
two years no considerable addition has been
made to the volume of Australian stocks, and
there has been no failure or unwillingness to
pay interest on any of them, they have receded
until it appears as if it yrould be more difficult
to raise a loan at 4 per cent, than it was two
or three years back to raise one at 3£ per cent.
Mr. Goschen’s Conversion Scheme and cheap
money raised our credit from 4 per cent, to
34 per cent.; but this was followed by a re-
duction to nearly 4 per cent, owing to a chain
of causes beginning with extravagant specula-
tion and consequent exhaustion of monetary
resources, losses on Argentine securities through
Baring Brothers, and the resulting hardening
of the money market, with weak speculative
holders of colonial securities. The unwilling-
ness of the colonies to abstain from borrowing
until the money market becomes more favor-
able, with exaggerated reports of some social-
istic labor developments and disorganization of
the public finances, have no doubt aggravated
the position; but substantially the real cause
of the depreciation of our securities is that a
market gorged with them as with other stocks
and unfavorable to investment in any kind of
State securities, even of British Consols, which
are £3 below the price ruling three years ago,
has not been allowed time to recover its
wonted tone.
The time is, therefore, not at all favorable
for writing a story on Australian finance.
The present conditions are certainly not such
as we can regard as furnishing the normal con-
dition of credit of these colonies. While all
the world has suffered from the events which
have followed on the great British Debt Con-
version Scheme of Mr. Gosohen, the fate of
Australia has been exceptionally unfortunate.
These colonies have been discredited through
scare and bad financing, rather than through
any intrinsic demerits in the matter of their
securities or otherwise, as we shall proceed to
show. They have been charged with over
borrowing, yet without one tittle of evidence to
justify the accusation ; and it will be a com-
paratively easy matter to prove that their
securities are now better worth thh highest
prices which have been paid for them than
ever they were at any previous time—even
than they were two years ago, when they had
reached the highest price yet attained.
If we look at both sides of the public account
we shall find ample evidence that the wealth
and resources of the colonies are so great as to
make their obligations, large as they may
seem, of little or no importance; certainly not


such as to cause any uneasiness whatever to
their creditors. Let us then first take the
amounts of the public debts of these colonies.
From information supplied from the Statisti-
cal Departments we give the debts of the
colonies on January 1, 1892 :
Excluding the unexpended balances of
loans, in round figures the debt of the Aus-
tralian colonies amounts to about £150,000,000.
The total may be taken as about a million and
a half less, as three of the colonies have sink-
ing funds for about that amount.
Against this apparently large indebtedness
it will be asked what are the securities to
which the colonies can point their creditors in
satisfaction of their demands for interest on
the loans current and repayment of principal
at due date ? These, on the most cursory ex-
amination, will be found very ample, and such
as are possessed by no great state in so large a
measure. They may be placed under three
heads : (1) Population ; (2) Land Resources ;
(3) Railways and Public Works.
Population.
We place population first because it is the
first and prime asset. It is that which gives
the continent its value. Uninhabited, or occu-
pied only by aboriginals, the two million square
miles of territory were worthless to the civilized
world. The occupation of Australia by indus-
trious people has added to the wealth of the
British Empire at least £1,000,000,000. In New
South Wales alone the public and private lands,
without improvements, are valued by Mr.
Coghlan, the Government Statist of New South
Wales, at £280,000,000. This colony has but little
more than one-tenth of the area of the continent,
and even though the lands of more sparsely
populated colonies are not so valuable per acre,
it is yet easy to imagine how vast is the terri-
torial wealth from the occupation of so great
an industrious people. The value of a rapidly
increasing population as an asset against the
debt has never been adequately recognized, or
we should have heard very much less of the
agitation against the accumulation of colonial
obligations.
In the United Kingdom all the British
Government has to represent its debt of about
£680,000,000 is the population. That is un-
doubtedly a valuable resource, but even in this
particular the population of the mother country
in no respect can compare with that of Aus-
tralia as an asset to be set against a state
obligation. Man for man a Britisher falls far
short of an Australian as a wealth producer.
Australia has no class corresponding to the
800,000 paupers of the United Kingdom. It
s a point to which leading British authori-
ties never give adequate, we might almost say
any, consideration in talking about our debts.
And it is well that it should be insisted on at
a time when there is too much disposition to
lecture and disparage the colonies. We have
only to cull from Mr. Mulhall’s dictionary of
statistics, figures showing the income and ex-
penditure per head of population in the three
leading Anglo-Saxon communities to show
how much larger a surplus remains to swell
the permanent wealth of Australia, after pro-
vision is made for the consumptive require-
ments of the people. Everyone who has lived
in England and Australia knows that the
difference in the wealth, producing conditions
of the two countries is much in favor of
Australia. That is indeed the reason why
people are flocking here in such large numbers.
The testimony of Mr. Mulhall on the point, in
the following table, shows this very clearly :

Figures of this kind may be subject to more
or less criticism, but in the main they indicate
the real economic conditions of the respective
countries. People who have lived in these three
parts of the world confirm them by personal
observation. Population in Australia is in-
creasing at the rate of about 3| per cent, per
annum. In the United States the increase is
barely 2| per cent. ; in the United Kingdom it

community.

Taking these figures, and accepting as in the
main correct the return of Mr. Mulhall, we see
how wealth rapidly accumulates in Australia.
A surplus of £9 13s. 9d. per head of tne
3,257,000 people means in round figures an
addition to our wealth of £30,000,000 per
annum. The expenditure in this comparison,
moreover, includes nearly £2 per head per
annum for the annual interest —amounting to
nearly £6,000,000 per annum—on the public
debt of £150,000,000. After paying interest
on this debt, of the size of which complaints are
made in England, the people have a clear sur-
plus of £30,000,000 to be added annually to the
permanent wealth of the community. Indeed
the amount is really larger, because the ex-
penditure includes many more things than food
and clothing, which are immediately consumed,
and constituting wealth to be added to the other
forms of it representing the nominal surplus of
£9 13s. 9d. per head.
Since wealth only increases in Great Britain
at the rate of £4 per head, and in the United
States at the rate of £6 3s. 9d. per head,
obviously the debt-bearing power of the people
of those countries, great as it may be, and
great as it has proved to be in their provision
for the great wars through which they have
passed, cannot in any way be put into com-
parison with that of the population of Aus-
tralia, where work yields so much more profit
than it does elsewhere, and where the difference
between expenditure and income is unparalleled.
That the population can be reckoned by
money value, and may be put as an asset, is
evident from the consideration that the
colonies have spent some millions for im-
migration purposes. It may ,be interesting
here to give the immigration figures of the
years 1850-1890, and the addition made to the
public debts for immigration :
What amount was paid by South Australia,
Victoria, and Western Australia in aid of
immigrants was paid out of the revenue or
land funds. Of the total net immigration
into the colonies after 1850, amounting to
1,301,000, a very considerable proportion was
assisted, indicating pretty clearly the estimate
set upon the value of population. The
colonies paying the money no doubt had the
worth of it, and something more. People who
were brought out at an expense of from £4 to
£l6 per head within a very few years returned
the amount in taxes ranging from £2 10s. to
£3 16s. per head per annum, to say nothing of
the traffic they furnished to the railways, and
the value they gave to the lands.
The capitalized value of the earnings of
3,257,000 people in a territory such as Aus-
tralia, on the basis of an annual surplus of
£30,000,000 per annum, increasing yearly at
the rate of per cent, would, in a generation,
cover an amount considerably in excess of the
debt of Great Britain. And by so much, and
much more, will the wealth of Australia be
increased within that period after paying
British capitalists all interest on their loans.
For our creditors, therefore, to show fear of
our security, with such evidence of stability,
is to indicate an inexcusable groping in dark-
ness, or an interested desire to blacken our
character so as to get the best terms they can
for their loans. Ignorance and avarice are
responsible for much of the writings on colonial
affairs in the British press.
The wealth-producing power of an indus-
trious population in a country like Australia is
simply enormous. If we take from Mr.
Coghlan’s estimate of the public and private
wealth of New South Wales, amounting to
£580,000,000, the very liberal allowance of
£100,000,000 as the amount of debt due to the


mother country, we should have £480,000,000
as the value of the public and private wealth
of the colony. This is the product and result
of the settlement of a mean population giving
barely 21,000,000 years of work per individual
within the century. It may be asked what
will he the increase of value from 72,000,000
of years of work per individual by a population
of 1,165,000, increasing at the rate of only 3£
per cent, in the next thirty years. Unless
there be a decrease in the working ability, or a
smaller remunerative return from the work,
or a smaller increment of land values, the
increase of wealth in New South Wales during
the coming generation ought not to be less
than £1,600,000,000. How insignificant the
public debt of £50,000,000, even if it be
trebled, will appear beside such wealth is self
evident.
It may be interesting to follow this question
of the production of wealth a little further
According to Mr. Coghlan, the private wealth
of New South Wales, inclusive of alienated land,
is valued at £407,405,000. But of this
£140,638,000 represents the increment to the
value of alienated land, the Government only
having received £32,714,000 for its purchase.
Deducting this, we have left, £266,767,000, as
the amount of the private wealth accruing
from the expenditure of labor and capital in the
past. Beckoning that of this, £50,000,000 re-
presents what is owing to British or foreign
capitalists, we have a total of £216,000,000.
This amount does not include the wealth ac-
quired by a part of this population in other
parts of Australia before the separation of
Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.
If then a mean population of 220,000 working
for 100 years produced in New South Wales
wealth valued at £216,000,000, the question nat-
urally suggests itself what will be produced by a
population of 1,156,000, increasing at the rate
of 4 per cent, per annum, representing a mean
population of 2,200,000 working for the next
thirty-three years. It will be found that on
the like basis of increase the addition to wealth
in 1925 ought to amount to fully £750,000,000.
On the basis of Mr. Mulhall’s surplus in-
come of £9 13s. 9d. per head, there should in
round figures be an increase of about
£700,000,000. As the increase at the rate of
growth of wealth in the past would have led
to the expectation of £750,000,000, it follows
that wealth must have accumulated in New
South Wales at a slightly more rapid rate than
Mr. Mulhall has supposed. On his basis of
£9 13s. 9d. per head, the 22,000,000 years of
work in the past should have produced about
£204,000,000 only, whereas it actually pro-
duced £216,000,000, to which, moreover, the
value of the wealth in Queensland and Victoria
when they were separated from this colony
ought to be added because it represents a part
of the product of the 22,000,000 years of work
of the population of the colony since its found-
ation. If such private wealth that went with
Victoria and Queensland be only valued at
£20,000,000, we should find the surplus income
of New South Wales has been between £ll
and £l2 rather than £9 13s. 9d. per head.
With such an accumulation of wealth accruing
from year to year available for the purpose of
taxation, if necessary, any sensible creditor of
the colony will dismiss all fear of the sufficiency
of the security for any money he may lend to
it. If the Governments taxed the people an
additional £6 per head, yielding a revenue from
all the colonies of about £20,000,000 per annum,
or sufficient to pay a debt more than four
times as large as is now complained of, the
people would still have left surplus wealth
amounting to about £4 per head; which is as
much as people is credited with, and
this, with a population growing three times as
fast as that of the mother country, would give
an increase of accumulation threefold that of the
old land, t bjection may be taken to the rate
of increase of population being estimated at 4
per cent, in New South Wales ; as a matter of
fact, in the past decade it was 4.14 per cent,
per annum. In time, the attractions of this
part of the world, already so superior to those
found in the United States, must become still
greater when the great Atlantic country has a
denser population. And it only wants the cheap-
ening of the. facilities of transit to draw to
these shores even a larger volume of the great
human stream which is passing from the over-
populated lands of Europe. If we reduce the
rate of increase to 3 per cent, per annum, there
would still be an immense growth of wealth ;
but with the natural growth of population of
2.28 per cent, it may not unreasonably be ex-
pected that the contributions of immigrant
population will be maintained.
These figures of increase of wealth, based on


the average work of the mean (population of
the colony since its foundation thus fully con-
firm the return of Mr. Mulhall as to the surplus
income of the population, after meeting con-
sumptive requirements. Of the increase of
£1,500,000,000 that would be expected on a
proportional basis within the thirty years,
£700,000,000 would be due from the surplus
income, and the balance from the increment
of values given to the land, railways, and pub-
lic works by the growth of population.
Moreover, it may be pointed out that if the
4,200,000 people who may be expected to
occupy New South Wales in 1925, at the
present rate of increase, do not possess the
measure of wealth thus indicated, they will
not be as wealthy, individually, as the existing
population. That the rate of wealth is
growing considerably faster than the rate
of population is, however, evident from the
increasing number of people who leave
property, and the large average value of the
property left. Mr. Coghlan points out that in
1866 the percentage of persons dying in New
South Wales who left property was 5-08 per
cent. Year by year there has been a steady
improvement, and in 1890 the percentage had
risen to 12-74, while the average value of the
estates rose within the same time from £1,487
to £4,157. In 1881 the total amount of pro-
perty sworn to was £2,319,123. It rose rapidly
and reached £7,528,122 in 1890. In nine years
it had nearly trebled. Nothing seems to be
clearer than that wealth is increasing at a ratio
far faster than population, arising, of course,
largely from increment to land values. And al-
though in New South Wales progress appears
most rapid, substantially, growth here illus-
trates the improvement in other parts of the
continent.
In 30 years’ time, when the loans of Australia
now being raised come to maturity, the exist-
ing population of the continent may be ex-
pected to exceed 12,000,000, and the wealth of
the colonies promises to show an increase even
greater than we have stated. If it were now
only £1,000,000,000, then it will be at
least £4,000,000,000 ; perhaps a larger
amount. How absurdly ridiculous it is then to
complain of a debt of £150,000,000 increasing
even at the rate of £10,000,000 per annum,
although we prefer to see a more moderate
expansion of the debt. If in 30 years’ time
the colonies continued borrowing at this rate
they would have a debt of £450,000,000 (main-
ly a railway debt), apparently rather more
than a tenth, probably not a twentieth, of
the total increase of wealth. Possibly before
the 30 years have expired the condition of
the colonies may show that they can them-
selves spare capital to lend to their Govern-
ments. If we judge, however, by America,
and the large amounts of English capital find-
ing the means of investment there, it will
probably be found that British capital in the
next generation will still find its most profitable
resource in the work of colonization in this
continent, which, with even 12,000,000 people,
will be vastly under-populated. For to take
the experience of life insurance companies and
their investments, money earns 4 per cent, in
England, 5 per cent, in America, and nearly
6 per cent, in Australia. And no doubt the
conditions of a new land like Australia will,
during the next century, furnish a better re-
turn on investments of equal solidity than
those of America or England.
For these various reasons we are justified in
placing prominently in the front rank of assets
for Australian securities the rapidly increasing
population. For industry and intelligence the
people here are not inferior to those of any
other part of the British Empire, since they
mostly represent the great middle classes who
have come to better their state under the more
favorable conditions which we have set forth.
They have brought with them the best ele-
ments of British life, which is preserved and
improved under favorable modifying conditions.
A guarantee for the permanence of this char-
acter of the Australian population is its con-
tinued stream of immigrants from the old
world comprising, in increasing numbers, those
who stand in the first place as teachers of men
in all the more elevating and refining pursuits
of life. Churches, universities, educational
institutions of every class, are all contributing
more largely to mould the population into
habits of life which give additional security to
the British creditors. If there have been some
labor conflicts, they are but the flow of a wave
which had its origin in the disturbing condi-
tions of the old world, and they will soon pass
away, leaving the Australian communities still
the freest, the most industrious, the most law-
abiding, and the best section of the British


Empire entirely free from pauperising condi-
tions, and only wanting, indeed, a few gener-
ations to make them the] most numerous. In-
stead of regarding simply the increase of debt
in relation to the increase of population, the
element of increase of wealth must also be
considered ; and when this is borne in mind we
see how the increase of population not only
meets the burden of interest, but also adds
prosperity to the wealth of the community, in-
creasing its strength for taxation purposes.
The Band,
After population the next most important
asset is the land. The extent and subdivision
of this, at the end of 1890, is shown from offi-
cial sources to be as follows

We have here about 1,800,000,000 acres
of Crown Lands to set against the public
debts of the several colonies, amounting to
£150,000,000. That the value of this territory
is far in excess of the united debts cannot be
doubted.
For illustrative purposes it may suffice if we
take the lands of New South Wales, for the
features of one colony in the main represent
those of another. The area of unalienated
land at the commencement of 1891, according to
Mr. Coghlan, was 151,121,000 acres. This he
valued at £94,400,000, or at the rate of 12s. 6d.
per acre. It may he alleged that its leased
annual value is only about £1,000,000, and that
this capitalized would only be worth about
£25,000,000. But no one questions that it is
leased much below its real value. The rental
only represents a capital value of about 3s. 6d.
per acre. But such portions of it as are being
alienated are being readily taken up from £1
per acreupto£2, and evenmore. Theminimum
of 12s. 6d. may, therefore, be regarded as a com-
paratively low value. If the incomederivdfrom
it on this basis is small, the actual results of the
occupation of it would warrant a higher figure.
But the State sees it to be to its interest to
give encouragement to lease it by offering
very easy terms. Therefore we assume that
the estimate is a small one. Thus creditors
have Crown land, valued by Mr. Coghlan at
£94,000,000, besides £13,224,000 due from land
buyers to set against the public debt amount-
ing to £50,000,000.
It may be said, of course, that this land is.
being rapidly alienated, and that the proceeds
are used for the general purposes of govern-
ment, and that consequently it is a diminish-
ing figure. Of course so long as the land laws
remain as they are, and alienation goes on
under existing conditions as to price, this will
not be denied. It is, however, to be pointed out
that if the lands of the colony thus enter into
the possession of private individuals they be-
come a source of wealth and an asset furnishing
revenue in another form. Mr. Coghlan esti-
mates the value of the territory of New South
Wales at the end of March, 1890, as follows :
Alienated ... 44,758,151 £173,352,000
Unalienated* 151,123,999 107,624,000*
Excluding from the return the amount due
by conditional purchasers, there is, in round
figures, land which at the end of 1890 was
valued at £268,000,000, to be set against the
public indebtedness of £51,000,000 and what-
ever private debt there may be. The import-
ance of this feature of colonial wealth, apart
from the question of ownership, ought to be
borne in mind by our creditors, because it is an
ever increasing factor. When they talk about
Australian debts increasing faster proportion-
ately than the population, they would seem not
only to ignore the fact that the surplus wealth
is increasing at the rate of at least £9 13s. 9d.
per head, or in round figures at the rate, in
New South Wales alone, of £11,000,000 per
annum, but that also the value of the lands is
through that growth of population annually
becoming much greater. What the rate of
increase is it is difficult to say exactly. Land
speculators act as if the value were improving
at the rate of 100 or even 500 per cent, per
annum. The growth of the value of land
differs, according to situation, and according
to proximity to population. In some places
present prices are probably pretty much as

ever they will be. Price is determined some-
times by people’s expectations, by the abund-
ance or scarcity of money, by the area thrown
upon the market, and by considerations other
than the actual value. But that there is a
general law of increase with the increase of
population cannot be doubted. It is probably
not too much to put it down at 4 per cent, per
annum—the rate of increase of the population.
At such a ratio the public estate of New South
Wales, which Mr. Coghlan now values at
£268,000,000, would nearly quadruple itself
in value in 35 years, shortly before the maturity
of the last of our debts, and by that time,
when the population may be expected to exceed
4.000. it may be assumed that the public
and private lands of the colony will be worth
£1,000,000,000. The increase in the average
value of the lands would begin with £11,000,000
per annum. It is this increase which it is the
desire of the friends of Henry George to acquire
for the State. Possibly the figures we have
given are too large, but taking into account
the great advances in the values of the city and
surburban lands occupied for business and
residential purposes, the lesser improvement
that will be given to areas turned from grazing
into agricultural purposes, and the increase that
may be expected in the value of land generally
from the opening up of railway communication
and the spread of settlement, the figures may
not be very far out. At any rate the increase of
population, at the rate of 4 per cent., will give
a large annual increment to the value of the
land of the colony far in excess of the
£2,000,000 paid as interest on the public debt,
or even of any additional sum that is likely to
be borrowed from year to year. The wealth of
the colony, from increase of production and
increase of land values, is growing seven times
faster than the increase of debt at the rate of
£3,000,000 per annum. Another way of look-
ing at the increase in land values is to assume
that as a population, which has grown up to
1.165.000, has given a value to the lands of
the colony estimated by Mr. Coghlan at
£268,000,000; an increase of that population to
about 4,000,000 in the next generation should
nearly quadruple its value. If the productive
forces of the population—Mr. MulhalTs basis of
£9 13s. 9d. per head of surplus revenue—will
yield £700,000,000 within the next generation,
then the increment in the value of land from
the growth of population would add about
£750,000,000, making £1,450,000,000 as the
additions to the wealth of the colony.
It may at once be conceded that the measure
of increase of land values is open to much dis-
cussion. Some will say that our reasoning in.
support of an annual increment of 4 per cent,
is insufficient, and that we cannot fairly
assume that the territory of New South Wales,
now valued at the rate of less than 30s. per
acre, will in a generation be worth £6 per
acre in consequence of the growth of popula-
tion to 4,000,000. The land of the United
Kingdom all round is at present estimated to
he worth from £25 to £3O per acre. If, how-
ever, we only allow for an increase of 1 per
cent, per annum in the value of our territory,
there would thus be an imperceptible growth
equalling £3,500,000 per annum throughout
the next thirty-three years, and adding to its
capital value over £100,000,000. At an ab-
surdly low computation, we have an annual
increment of land values alone that more than
equals the amount of the growth of debt.
It will thus be found that though in some
respects the securities of the colonies may be
subject to rather greater fluctuations than
those of the mother country, on the whole
there is a stability in their landed resources, on
which the rates of money are based, not sur-
passed by that of Great Britain. For instance
the agricultural lands of Australia have never
suffered so serious a depreciation as those of
England within the past fifteen years. Tem-
porary inflations of values of city properties
have been produced by speculators, causing
losses which have disturbed British investors
in some of our land companies. But the great
productive lands of the colony—pastoral, agri-
cultural, and mining—are growing in value
from year to year with and through the spread
of population, and also because of surrounding
improvements. When our creditors cry out r
under the alarms of interestered syndicates, at
the amount of our borrowings, there is an utter
forgetfulness of the steady increase in value of
the securities they possess by the added value
to the land which is given by the annual settle-
ment of 100,000 people. Destitute of popula-
tion the laud is worthless. The first inhabi-
tants obtained it as a grant. Those who come
after get it at various prices—say on the
average about 225. per acre ; and their occupa-


tion quickly doubles its value, and in the nearer
agricultural settlements, around Sydney and
Melbourne for instance, this land, which was
a gift or purchased at £1 or £2 per acre, is now
for dairying or farming purposes worth from
£25 to £IOO, or even more, per acre. Notwith-
standing a temporary depression, city land was
sold in Sydney the other day at £l9 per square
foot. And as population spreads a larger area
of the continent must so grow in price that
each 100,000 people will add very greatly to the
value of the territory of Australia, not merely
to the particular areas of land they take up,
but to the unalienated land owned by the
Government. In the settlement of popula-
tion alone English creditors have increasing
security for their loans. Wealth thus comes
from the land under the influence of settle-
ment. The land becomes more valuable
because it is thus made to produce. In
England land does not grow in value in any
such general way, and its pecuniary worth is
subject to greater fluctuations than the land of
the colony. While the mother country has no
territory that gives a revenue to any note-
worthy extent, Australia has an enormous area
of Crown Lands at present yielding a large
income. And where the land is owned
privately the advantage in improvement and
increment in value is vastly greater in the
colonies than in the mother country, because
the growth of the population is thrice as fast,
and the production of wealth by the people so
much greater per head.
In our table showing the area of alienated i
lands, the figures of the territory on which
purchasers still owe money are included. Out
of the 102,000,000 acres sold, 32,000,000 acres in-
clude land which is only in process of aliena- ■
tion and on which the buyers owe the Govern-
ment balances. In New South Wales alone j
the purchasers of 18,000,000 acres owe the j
Government about £13,250,000—a sum re- !
presenting more than a fourth of the whole I
debt. And though the obligations of land
buyers in the other colonies are not so great,
they are still considerable, and have to be
entered in the account of assets.
Railways and Public Woeks.
In the third rank of Australian assets we
place the railways and public works, for the con-
struction of which the debt has been incurred.
And these alone, we believe, furnish sufficient

It may be noticed in the first instance that
thoughthe cost of the railways was £98,176,644,
the sum of £8,207,000 represents money paid
from the general revenue, leaving barely
£90,000,000 of the public debt to stand against
the railways.
The question, however, for the consideration
of our British creditors is what are our rail-
ways worth J Nominally they cost £98,176,644.
Some years back Mr. G. R. Dibbs prominently
called attention to the fact that the railways
of New South Wales were worth the whole
amount of the debt. And there is little doubt
he was right. Though the railways of Australia
cost £98,000,000 during the course of their
construction, they have all had the accretions
of value which come with increase of popula-
tion and traffic. For instance, the first
section of railway in Australia—from Sydney
to Parramatta constructed at a cost of
£ 1,400,000, must be worth three times as much,
the interest return on it for years having
ranged from Bto 9 per cent, per annum. No
doubt the unprofitable extensions have to be
set against those which pay more than cost.
But, taking New South Wales alone, the net
result on the capital cost of the lines for the
year being 3‘67 per cent., represents 4-17
per cent, on the portion of the debt against the
railway, which, according to the official figures,
costs the colony only 3-98 per cent. In other
words, the railways earned 4s. per cent, per
annum more than the cost of the money bor-
rowed for their construction. The financial
position of the South Australian railways was
security for all the money that has
rowed. The following figures given

official returns, show the financial

even better still, as the interest earned on the
capital cost was 5-32 per cent., or on the por-
tion of the debt more than 5-50 per cent. The
railways paid more than 30s. per cent, above
the interest on all the borrowed money. The
railways of other colonies did not pay so well;
but on the whole the 9,501 miles of lines, on
which there was a debt of about £90,000,000,
returned net receipts amounting to £2,986,405,
being at the rate of 3-33 per cent, per annum.
As the average interest rate on the whole of
the colonial debts, at the end of 1890, was only
3-995 per cent., it follows that the colonies had
to pay barely £600,000 per annum out of the
general revenues to meet the deficiencies of
interest. Probably about £200,000 more would
have to be added for interest on the lines in
course of construction. On a population of
3,250,000 a total of £BOO,OOO, representing
about ss. per head, is not a very serious annual
charge. It may be said that this is too much,
and that the railways should be made to pay.
But in reply it is well said that any deficiency
is far more than made good by the services
rendered by the lines in promoting settlement.
Although some of the extensions do not pay
at the outset, they open up the country, give
fresh traffic to other and older sections of the
railway system, and very soon, with the rapid
progress of settlement, enter upon a paying
career. The collateral advantages of railways
in rendering postal services, in increasing the
value of the immense areas of public estate,
and in facilitating the traffic of the country,
make good deficiencies in the cost of working.
These deficiencies are cheerfully paid for the
sake of the indirect advantages which the State
enjoys from the railways. In submitting to a
■deficiency to be paid out of the general revenue,
the colonies really enhance the value of the
railways to the English creditors, because the
low charges, which are the cause of it, really
promote the settlement which increases the
traffic. Higher charges might be fixed and the
railways made to pay working expenses and
interest on cost of construction, as they would
no doubt if they were in the possession of
private individuals, who would hardly consent
to a loss, since they would not realize the
other advantages which the State obtains from
them. Even though worked at a direct loss
English creditors must see that the absolute
unproductiveness of the lines tends to increase
the value of the securities their loans represent,
and that, consequently, the unproductiveness
being provided by the colonists themselves, is
really a cause for the satisfaction of creditors
rather than uneasiness. They may rest assured
that colonists will not overburden themselves
with the cost of these unproductive railways
in any such way as to lessen the value of the
securities for the payment of their debts.
That the capital value of the railways is
muoh greater than theircost cannot be doubted,
for it increases annually with the increase of
population. Assuming steady productiveness
in the population, a per cent, increase might
be expected to yield a like ratio of increase of
traffic ; and although that does not necessarily
indicate so great a proportionate increase in
value, it does suggest a very considerable
increase. Last year, for instance, when the
American railways had a great accession to
their traffic from the large harvest, the value
of their stocks rose on the average about 15 per
cent., constituting almost the only feature of
advance in the London share market. Similarly
the growth of the English railway traffic adds to
the value of the railways, but that growth is
insignificant beside that of the Australian
traffic. Our population is increasing about
three times as fast as that of Great Britain,
has far greater productive powers, far larger
means for using the lines for business or
pleasure than the English population, and our
railway system is therefore growing muoh
more rapidly in value than that of the mother
country. Mile for mile, of course, our rail-
ways are far less valuable than those of Great
Britain, owing not to the mere cost of con-
struction, for that would probably be less than
in the colonies, but to the cost of the land
required. The accretion in value of land in
Great Britain, to and from the date of railway
construction, made railways costly against the
general community, who moreover have not
only to pay interest on this increase of cost,
but also a generally higher rate of interest to
private capitalists than our Governments have
to pay on their capital. For instance, in 1889,
on the railway capital of Great Britain, a
return of £4 4s. 6d. per head was paid to
capitalists. The difference between that rate
and the interest paid on colonial loans, which
is a gradually lessening figure, is 4s. per cent.
The cheapness of mileage, of course, is an


element strongly in favor of the colonial
railways as a security for debt, because they
must be all the more capable of yielding a
payable return, even from a like proportion of
traffic ; and because the possibilities of in-
creasing in value are greatly in their favor.
It may be interesting to put the figures of the
British and Australian railways side by sidei
those of Great Britain taken from the State-
man's Year Book are at the end of 1889, and
those of Australia to the 30th June, 1891 ;

What is it that makes the English railway
so valuable is not so much the cost of the
work in them as of the land they occupy. And
no doubt, without the outlay of much capital,
the colonial railways will add enormously to
their value through the increments of land
values and through the quadrupling of the
population. If there were no addition to the
present mileage of railways in Australia, and
no outlay beyond the necessary additions for
accommodation and locomotives, which would
probably not be a very important factor, the
mileage value of Australian railways will,
through the growth of population, the increase
of traffic, and the enhanced value of land, have
approximated to the figures of Great Britain.
The figures we have quoted of the capital
value of the railway stock represent first cost.
Population and traffic have given the English
lines a market value considerably in advance
of the cost of £876,595,000. The stock of most
of the railways is at a premium, that of the
largest compauy, which has a capital of over
£100,000,000, is at a premium of £7O percent.
The total market value of the railways of
Great Britain exceeds £1,000,000,000, the pre-
mium being due almost entirely to the growth
of population and traffic. If there has been
an increment of 30 per cent, to the market
value of British railways, given by a popula-
tion increasing at the rate of 1 per cent, per
annum during the past 40 years, what, it may
be asked, will be the increase of value to
Australian railways within the next 40 years
given by a population of much greater wealth
producing power, increasing at the rate of
34 per cent, per annum. The market value of
the money representing the capital cost of the
New South Wales railways three years ago
approached the total amount of the debt, and
together with that of the sums representing
other reproductive works would have exceeded
it. And although the money market has since
changed against the colonies, the prices paid
by British investors for our rail way debentures
and stocks represent an amount considerably
greater than the capital cost. And when the
money market becomes more favorable no
doubt the market value will soon again repre-
sent the total debt.
The value which mere increase of population
gives as a security or asset against public in-
debtedness tells in the case of land and railway
values in an equal ratio. And as that increase
in Australia is more than treble what it is in
England, we see how vastly greater must be
the growth of wealth in population and of
increment to land and railway values here
than in the mother country. We may reason-
ably expect that within the next generation
production will yield £700,000,000, increase of
land value £750,000,000, and increase of rail-
way and other public works values at least
£50,000,000.
Summary.
A return prepared by Mr. Fenton, of the
Victorian Statistical Department, to the close
of the year 1890, gives the following statement

the Australian colonies had been expended to

It appears thus that £122,513,606 or 88 - l per
■cent, of the loan expenditure had been made
upon works yielding a direct revenue, no less
than 69'4 per cent, being on railways and
tramways. If it be said that the balance,
amounting to £16,627,044, or 11*9 per cent., is
still a large amount of money to be yielding
no direct revenue, it might be replied that it is
more than balanced by the amounts due from
those who have bought land from the Govern-
ments ; or looked at in another way, it will be
seen not to be £5 per head of the whole popu-
lation. In England the unproductive debt
represents £l7 per head of a population whose
annual surplus wealth is not one-half that of
Australia, and where the property is not
increasing in value at anything like the ratio
of what is seen in this hemisphere.
Looking at the debt from an interest bear-
ing point of view, it is estimated that of the
total amount of £5,772,160, representing 4'02
per cent, on the amount of the debt, the rail-
ways yield £2,720,000. It is thought that
£500,000 is derived from water and other re-
productive works, leaving nearly £2,310,000 to
be obtained from taxation, surplus land, and
other sources of general revenue, or about
14s. 6d. per head of the population. In Great
Britain the national debt imposes a burden of
unproductive debt approaching the same figure
upon a much poorer and less progressive popu-
lation, and the Government has no proceeds of
land rentals or alienation to aid it such as are
possessed in these colonies. For instance, in
1889, £3,831,000 was received from this source,
or nearly twice as much as the general defi-
ciency of interest earned by the reproductive
works constructed out of borrowed money.
Yet again if we take Mr. Fenton’s figures,
showing £122,500,000 as the amount of the
debt of £139,000,000 represented by reproduc-
tive works, that proportion at the market value,
under normal conditions, is about equal to the
full amount of the debt. On the stock the
colonies pay rather over 4 per cent., but the
capital value at 3£ per cent., or rather less,
which has been, and no doubt again will be the
market value, represents £140,000,000.
The resources of Australia in people, in un-
alienated and alienated territory, and in
railways, telegraphs, and 'public works are so
vast in comparison with the public obligations,
and their monetary value is increasing so much
more rapidly than the public debts, as to leave
no reasonable ground for uneasiness in the
minds of creditors with regard to the payment
of either principal or interest. Every loan
issue hitherto has been met at maturity, and
every instalment of interest has been faithfully
paid. Moreover, there has never been any
word of repudiation in the colonies. The
wealth of the communities is so great, and the
amount of it is increasing so rapidly, as to make
the incidence or the public debt a very light
weight on the shoulders of the people.
In whatever way the Australian debt is
looked at, it cannot for one moment compare
as a burden on the people with what is seen in
Great Britain or other countries of the old
world. And, sooner or later, on the recovery
of the value of first-class investment stocks
those of Australia must again take rank, not as
4 per cent, securities, which in the present con-
ditions is market value, but as 3J per cents., or
even 3 per cents. ; for their soundness is based
on resources, the like of which are possessed by
no other country in the world. The gradual
recognition of this value was apparent as the
stocks rapidly increased in value. Twenty-five
years ago our English creditors lent us money
at £5 10s. per cent. Writing in 1882 in The
Year-Book of Australia, when our securities
yielded about 4 per cent, per annum, we pre-
dicted that within fifteen years they would be
at a price that would not yield the investor
more than 3 J per cent. Within seven years, in
1889, loans were raised by New South Wales
and Victoria at about £3 Bs. per cent. Beyond
the monetary- disturbances which have pre-
judiced the market for all stocks, and disclosed
a weakness in our method of negotiating loans,
nothing has occurred to warrant any reduction
in the intrinsic value of Australian securities.
And if the colonies will only allow their stocks
to be absorbed by investors they ought soon
again to borrow at a price below 3J per cent,
per annum. And when Australia is federated
it may be fairly expected that the united
strength and importance of the continent will
give us the loans at 3 per cent. Then, of course,
the burden of the obligation will be lightened.
We might indeed take credit for the de-
clining value of money as a contingent asset,
unless we regard it as a reduced liability.
The value of money for investment purposes,
as indicated by the average prices of Consols,


has fallen in every decade of the century.
When taken in connection with the fact that
the diminishing amount of Consols gives them
greater security, we have it clearly demon-
strated that the value of money for investments
is falling. Within 30 years the price of our
securities has improved in even a greater
measure —showing two things—that the
colonies are not only sharing the benefits of
the declining value of money, but further that
their credit is improving relatively faster than
that of the mother country. The reasonable
considerations for that improvement we have
endeavored to set forth. Nothing has occurred
to warrant any change in the favorable regard
of British investors ; and we have no doubt
that when there is a recovery of confidence
the stock on the market will be quickly ab-
sorbed, and a demand will arise for more.
We wrote in 1882 : “ As the amount of the
British national debt falls off the shoulders of
the British taxpayer, it may be invested on
Australian railways on the security of the
various Governments at higher rates of interest
than are guaranteed by the British Govern-
ment.” Within the ten years about
£85,000,000 has been added to Australian
debts, no doubt largely represented by the
proceeds of redeemed Consols, of which as a
matter of fact about £85,000,000 has been
redeemed. And this we may say, that none
of it has been invested in more secure
national investments. Ten years ago we
pointed out that scores of millions of
pounds sterling had been lost by British
capitalists on foreign investments, largely in
South American State securities. Now we
have again to point out that millions more
have had to be added to their losses from
Argentine stocks. Our securities are sounder
than ever they were, though discredited for
the time by the losses made in other countries.
When the money market scare is over, and
British capitalists begin to look for invest-
ments, they will find none which present
better security than those of the Australian
colonies, of which 88 per cent, represent rail-
ways and public works of a reproductive
character, growing in value with the increase
of population and consequent increase of
traffic and use.
The details of the debts of the colonies are
furnished elsewhere from official sources.




Office of the Government Statist,
Melbourne.
You ask me to give my opinion on The Year-Book of Australia,
and as I think very highly of it, I have much pleasure in doing so. I
consider the book one of the most valuable books of reference I know. It is a
perfect marvel of industry, and contains information which, I am aware,
could not have been procured without much labour and research. The
particulars given have been judiciously selected, and are just such as are
required by those who seek to gain a knowledge of the Australian colonies.
The merits of the book are such that it ought to have a large circulation
both at this end of the world and the other.
