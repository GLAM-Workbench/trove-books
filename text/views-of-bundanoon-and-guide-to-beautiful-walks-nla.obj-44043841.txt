GUIDE NOTES
ECHO POINT, 2\ miles from Railway Station, is one of the
finest panoramic views in New South Wales. Over hill and
gully for 40 miles the eye can trace the tree-clad landscape, with
its grey scarped cliffs visible even to the Shoalhaven. For the
convenience of picnic parties a shed with tables, water-tank and
fireplace is situated a short distance from the view. Visitors
can drive up to the spot.
Starting from the Railway Station for direction proceed up
the rise, past the English Church and down Constitutional Hill.
If driving, take the turn to the right by the church, where a
new road makes an easier grade. Arriving at the bush, beyond
the orchard and Cambell’s, keep straighten (the path to the left
leads to Fairy Bower). Also, some half-mile further, the path
divides. Take the right-hand direction ; the left leads to
Beauchamp’s Cliffs.
BEAUCHAMP’S CLIFFS, a remarkably fine view, shows a
deep, well-defined gully, 300 to 400 feet deep. The view is in
contrast to the vast distances of Echo Point. The steep scarped
rocks and green heights around Beauchamp’s Cliffs form a back-
ground and complete a picture of unusual grandeur.
FAIRY BOWER is rightly named. It has enduring charms—
shady winding paths, overhanging rocks, lofty trees, giant fern
clumps, and the tinkle of running water. It is an ideal place
TO POINTS OF INTEREST AROUND

for children. Where the picnic tables are placed the water
dances across the level rocks, inviting merriment. Ought the
children to resist the temptation to paddle in the rippling shallow
waters ? Off with shoes and stockings, and with other garments
tucked safely up, soon shrieks of laughter are heard. True, the
children, sooner or later, slip down and wet themselves, and the
rocks and trees become festooned with little garments drying.
But what of it ? The youngsters, with unaccustomed scanty
clothing, slap their limbs and find a heightened enjoyment in the
novel surroundings. A towel and a spare garment for the little
ones take no room in the basket.
Thirty yards down stream from the picnic tables is the
BRIDE’S LOOKOUT, a point of view at the head of the gully.
A table and seat placed under a rock enables visitors to rest and
enjoy a wonderfully beautiful scene of the near deep ravine and
the far-away hills. Stone steps lead to the bottom of the valley.
Over the rocks the water tumbles, running down the long rope-
like roots in a thousand silver spirals and melting into spray ere
it reaches the boulders below.
Along the valley the energetic walker can go for miles to the
FOSSIL RIVER, where good specimens reward the searchers,
and on to the very bottom, where the waters of the Bundanoon
Creek make a fine fall over the rocks.


Returning, however, to the foot of the stone steps, a path to
the left leads to THE AMPHITHEATRE, a semicircular forma-
tion of rocks, and, continuing on, ladders up the cliffs lead to a
track which comes out on the main road above Cambell's and not
far from Constitutional Hill. But to-day we are keeping to our
friends at Fairy Bower.
Luncheon has been spread. What a multitude of good things
the basket held, and the good man of the party has been attending
the fire for boiling the billy. Billy tea I There’s no tea like it.
All the formalities must be observed : a twig across the billy to
keep the smoke out, and the water must be kept on the boil for a
few seconds after the tea is in. Then to make the tea-leaves sink
tap the outside of the billy. Is it the smoky water, or the novel
surroundings or the quantity of tea we used that makes such
delightful beverage ? Oh ! there’s no mistake about it. We
ALL agree we never get such tea indoors 1
When lengthening shadows give warning it is time to be
packing, coo-ees come echoing from afar. Members of our
party straggle up—some hot and dishevelled ; others (how do
they do it ?) cool and tidy as when they set out. The walk up in
the evening quiet is very beautiful. The falling hush of coming
nightthe still trees, that seem to lean and listen ; the white
gums, with their violet patched trunks ; and the haze in the
background that paints the whole scene heliotrope. At the top
of the gully our conveyance is waiting. Driving home, coats and
wraps discarded for the day, are put on. The air grows sharp as
the sun declines. The rumble of the wheels makes the young
ones drowsy. Tired little heads lean on their elders’ arms. The
horses toil up the long, winding hill, past the church —and home.
The tired children put to bed, all gather for the evening meal.
The hum of voices mingles pleasantly with the clink of the cups.
The evening air grows cold. Around the log fire the adventures
of the day are gone over. A little music, a few well-known loved
songs, and, before long, the welcome blankets and a dreamless
sleep.
The GLOW-WORM VALLEY. —Our oldest visitor—l mean,
of course, in point of residence —a man, had declared that
nothing short of an earthquake should turn him out after tea to
go looking for glow-worms. How far was it ? Enquiries put it
at two miles ; and fine, moonlight nights were not propitious.
Glow-worms like damp, and, naturally, a dark setting enhances
their brightness. As far as we could, we chose a suitable night
and started out, nine of us, with a lantern. We went past the
post office in the Exeter direction, turned up McWilliams’ lane by
Uandi, past Summer Hill, past McWilliams’ farm and the big
walnut tree, and along a fenced half-chain road grown over with
bushes and boggy in places. When making enquiries as to the
road early in the day our informant in conclusion had told us
“ you can’t go wrong.” This is what they say in the country,
when at the time you are feeling your mind a very blank as to
directions. The fencing, however, holds till about a quarter of
a mile from the gully. Here a path leads through the bush with
a general trend towards the left. You strike the top of the gully,
wind down its steep sides and come to seats, and with the sound
of water just below. The rocks rise like a wall in front, and as
long as daylight lasts show nothing beyond their dark surface.
As dusk deepens the lights begin to shine, first in single points
here and there, gradually coming out in increasing numbers and
massing into larger clusters, till the scene reminds one of lights
at sea from afar. Although most of our own party had made a
grudging start, when home again they admitted it was a wonderful
sight, and they were glad to have seen it.
GUIDE NOTES


HOPETOUN LOOKOUT is a fine extensive view about four
miles away. The track is rough in places, but practicable for
vehicles. The direction is by Constitution Hill, turning off to
the left at the top of the rise before coming to Cambell's farm.
Bear to the left through the second gate, about half a mile down
the lane. The lookout is from a tall headland, which allows a
free, commanding prospect. It is thought by some that this is
the finest panoramic view around.
- THE ERITH COAL MINE,—It is not usual to associate coal
mines with romantic scenery, yet in this case there is everything
to assist in the making of beauty—the wooded heights, the blue-
grey rocks,the waterfall, and the pebbled creek. The mine work-
ings have been abandoned twenty years since, and Nature has
clothed man’s activities with her own.mantle of sober hues. The
“ drives ” enter the cliffs about half-way down and are reached
by ladders clamped to the rocks. The workings have been ex-
tensive in their day, and considerable capital must have been
sunk.
Turning up stream from the waterfall about fifty yards is
REFLECTION POOL, of which an illustration is given on page
9. For a type of pure sylvan scenery this is hard to beat. The
dripping rocks in their setting of ferns and grasses and the clear
crystal pool make a picture of delight.
The direction is along the Karela road for a little over a mile,
and to the left by a track formed of coal cinders, where formerly
the tramway ran from the mine to the railway. At the end of
this track is the remains of what was the engine-house. Here,
if driving, you must alight and journey the remainder on foot.
From the shed turn to the right for a few yards through the
scrub, and a track will be found down the rocks. Continue for
some fifty yards and a deep cutting through the hill will be
discovered. Pass down the cutting and beyond, and the gully
and waterfall will soon be displayed. To reach the fall and
ladders, return a few paces, and stepping up the bank to the
right a path will be seen leading down to the water. Distance
from Railway Station 2\ miles.
VIEW POINT is in the same direction as the coal mine, the
turning from the main road being the next to the left beyond the
cinder track. Continue for about a mile to where the track
makes a definite divergence, then turn to the left. A shed,
tables, and water-tank are near the view for visitors’ conve-
nience.' Vehicles can be taken to within a few yards of the shed.
Another beautiful walk is, instead of turning to the left where
the track diverges, to keep straight on down the valley, along
a road leading to Taylor’s farm. It is not advisable to attempt
driving this part. Here, in the Spring, is famous for pink
boronia and other bush flowers. It is good to see them and
enjoy their beauty and fragrance, but it is against the law to
pluck them, and we would ask visitors to assist in preserving
their loveliness for the benefit of all.
There are other walks and drives which have not been touched
upon. It is merely desired to interest the visitor in the beauties
within his immediate ken, and to cause him to feel a love and
kindliness towards this spot of Health and Peace.
