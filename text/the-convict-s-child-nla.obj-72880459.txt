JWOHNNY PEARITH,
i THE CONVICT?S CHILD!
The Foun
The convict ship lay near the beach,
The morn was drear and dark.
And many a wretched felon stood
Awaiting to embark.
One felon stood among the rest.
His eye look?d fierce and wild !
He held an infant in his arms,
?Twas alas ! his only child.
Tune?Yankee Doodle.
Sec wark sly ? Stweed? the foundlin?s meade
Sen luik?d oft by the nobs, man ;
He?s daily fill?d the town wi? news
An? Magistrates wi? jobs, man ;
He thinks he?s been a prophet bworn,
And studys neet and day, man.
And swears he?ll send the ? poachin? crew
A trip to Botany Bay, man.
His auburn hair fell loosely o?er
A brow of spotless white,
His little eyes beam?d playfully
With innocent delight!
He little knew his father?s heart,
Was breaking while he smiled,
Or that he took the last farewell
CHORUS.
My job?s a bad un oft he?ll say,
They?ll drown, or shoot, or butch me,
But dash me if I think there?s yen
Amang the crew dar touch me.
There?s naen on earth puir Jwohnny says,
That iver yence befriends me,
Sae ? herum scarum? be my life.
I?ll tek what fortune sends me;
?Tis whispert that yae pitch dark neet,
Some heartless wretched bad uns.
An infant laid me at the door.
Of famous auld Mc?Adams.
Of him ?his only child.
They tore the infant from his arras,
Then dragged him from the shore.
He wildly gazed around the beach,
But saw his child no more.
The vessel sail?d - the convict fell?
In dying anguish wild,
?Tis done, the fatal struggle?s o?er,
Alas, my only child.
My foster fadder Jack Mc?Garr,
T? schuil wad often tek me,
An? tell me owre an? owre agean,
A lawyer, he wad mek me;
But larnin French or Latin bulks
I never yence cud think man,
Wi? navvy slop an? cwordy roys,
I on the line did clink man.
The widow sobbed alone,
Her tears might flow in vain,
That bitter morn her husband fell,
She ne?er could see again.
She pressed her infant to her breast,
Again she saw him smile,
I?ll live for that dear boy, she cried,
Alas, my only child.
Aw kinds o? life baith good and bad,
lies fawn unto my lot, man,
An? what comes o? me suin or leate
I dunnet care a jot, man,
1 fear nae danger?scworn the fails
Whae wad attempt to wrang me,
And actin on the ? Solaway Act,?
The wastrels cannot bang me.
My birth in myst?ry is involv?d,
By ? Planets ? lam guided,
The ? Star? which rules my luckless fate
I nobbet lately spied it,
Sae ya whae wad ? thin skilly? shun,
Beware and tek to workin.
For if yewi? your hemp traps come,
Sly ? Pearith?s? always lurkin.
The ? nettin? gang howl in my lug,
Thief, liar, rogue, an? wratch man,
Because I ? Injiamnations ? lie.
When I the varmin catch man.
Eleven t? the bench I?ve browt,
Whae now their fate bewail, man.
And wonder how daft foundlin John,
Cud send them to the gaol, man.
Frae Dearpon Scar to Yammon Foot,
And down to Fuorce Mill Dam, man,
With philosophic pow?rs endow?d,
The ? netters ? I trepan, man,
But should poor John a victim fall,
And die beneath their clutches.
My ghost will nightly tek its walk
On ? Shekel Poles ? for crutches.
X drunk wi? circuit barristers,
When tried at Carel Sessions,
And ? lawyer Ramsbray? teil?t me how
I was to use cross questions,
He tuik my brief without a fee,
The strumpet he outwitted,
And ? Jwohnny Pearith ? at the bar,
Was honourably acquitted.
FINIS.
