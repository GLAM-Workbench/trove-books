Women and Children First!
KATHARINE BRUCE GLASIER.
How long ago it seems since, in the
days of peace, the skilled journalists
pointed their paragraphs on the Titanic
disaster with the human appeal of that
phrase, ?Women and children first!?
How long will it be, I wonder, before
history reveals the starkly inverted appli-
cation of that same phrase for the coun-
tries over which the battle-tide has actually
poured in these days of European War?
In the Boer War the Boer death roll
directly due to the war stands:
4,000 men and 20,000 women and chil-
dren.
Few men, I fancy, even among paci-
fists, have set the terrible significance of
those figures clear before their con-
sciences. For our ? chivalrous ? mili-
tarist statesmen and our most Christian
bishops they might have had no exist-
ence.
But as the second winter of war in
Europe drags out its dreadful days and
still more dreadful nights, if the shat-
tered homes of the teeming towns and
villages of Belgium and Northern
France could yield up their records, and
to them be added the unspeakable woe
of the women and children in the tenfold
vaster area of Poland?s wasted farmlands,
or of the snow-bound Carpathians, of
typhus-ridden Serbia, of Montenegro, and
the bombarded districts of the Dardan-
elles, of the Armenian massacres, and the
Pogroms of the Jews in Russia, it can
hardly be doubted that the thousands of
the women and children victims of the
Boer War must have been swollen in
Europe to millions.
Yet in the belligerent countries where
the tide of war has not actually penetrated
few people seem to have the least concep-
tion of this awful price of war ? a price
they do not pay.
The journalist writers, telling of the
escape out of Serbia, after awful hardships
on the march, of originally well-equipped
small nursing units, together with a large
proportion of the Serbian Army, one and
all took it for granted that the bulk of the
women and children refugees must have
perished on the frozen roads.
Even where the war tide has left the
houses and farmsteads outwardly un-
scathed, as in many parts of Poland and
Belgium, relentless requisitions of cattle
(involving the children?s milk supply), of
fuel and blankets, have deprived the help-
less mothers of the means whereby they
could adequately feed and warm their
children. Water supplies are ruined or
befouled, disease has inevitably added its
toll, and for twenty miles around we learn
that the poisonous gases of the battle-
fields eat away at baby eyes and lungs.
Of the wreckage of nerve and brain,
through agonies of terror, I dare not begin
to write.
On January 9 (as the English people
were allowed to know more than a
month later) Polish-American citizens tele-
graphed Mr. Asquith pleading pitifully
that the British blockade against ships
carrying provisions and clothing con-
signed from the United States and des-
tined for the war-stricken districts in
Poland might be raised, and vessels
carrying such cargoes be permitted to dis-
embark at the harbour of Dantzig or some
other suitable port. They told Mr.
Asquith one-third of a generation?the
youngest?has practically, ceased to exist:
the remaining youth, old men and women
are now upon the threshold of actual ex-
tinction by starvation and exposure.
They asked that the American Commis-
sion for Belgium should undertake the
work of relief ? with absolute guarantee
that it should be distributed only and ex-
clusively among Polish sufferers in dis-
tricts devastated by war.?
But Necessity? was upon
Great Britain. The Central Powers might
benefit, might increase their requisitions.
Our Government declared it impossible
to enter into any arrangement for any such
scheme of relief until Germany and Aus-
tria had prohibited the export of all food-
stuffs from Russian Poland. So the Re-
lief Ships could not sail.
Meantime the mothers of Poland, in
the other lands where the war is being
actually fought, must continue to watch
their little ones slowly die, or, as many
of them have preferred to do, go put with
them into the snow and perish with them
swiftly.
It is only one more page in the history
of modern Europe that goes to prove that,
for all their pious protestations, great
military empires do not so much arrange
to fight for little countries as upon them.
And in those unfortunate ? little coun-
tries ? it is ?women and children first!
Surely that fact should give some pause
to the militarists in Germany and Eng-
land, admittedly now the chief prota-
gonists in the war. ? Honour ? is
strangely invoked on either side when the
trampling down of helpless millions of
women and children in countries other
than their own is involved in the prolong-
ing of the contest.
Yet hear Mr. Asquith?s would-be ironic
witticism in answer to Mr. Philip Snow-
den?s splendidly human appeal in the
House of Commons for definitely stated
terms of peace that?might bring the war
to an end, and realise the objects for which
we are fighting better than would any mere
military victory:
? Apparently we cannot either way,
whether we are stalemated or whether we
checkmate the enemy?in either way we
cannot win the game.? (Laughter.)
? The game ? ?where ? Women and chil-
dren first!? is the order of agony in the
countries where it is plavedl
I imagine the mothers of Poland listen-
ing to that laughter! So do we gain clear
vision of the seared soul that comes to a
people determined to have no other settle-
ment than war can bring them, deter-
mined on War at any Price?a price they
do not pay.?? Labour Leader.?
Will you not in the interests of humanity use your influence towards
ending this horror?
