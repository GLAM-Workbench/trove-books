DAY OF SALE.
Monday, May 13th, 1929.
"HIS remarkable collection of letters addressed to Sir Joseph Banks,
■“ President of the Royal Society, deals very largely with the early
settlements in Australia and the South Seas.
Banks was frequently consulted by the British Government as to
the appointment of Governors. A very fine series of letters will be
found from Governors Wm. Bligh, Philip King, John Hunter, Arthur
Phillip, and Wm. Paterson.
Letters of Matthew Flinders and George Bass, the discoverers, are
of the greatest rarity. A fine letter of Sir Joseph Banks, dated from
Rio de Janeiro, has a mention of Captain Cook.
A series of interesting drawings of Sydney in 180 G will be found
in the collection.
'The letters and papers are arranged in volumes, each with a
full list of contents.
Probably the most important papers concerning Australia ever
offered for sale.
Sold by order of a collateral descendant of Dorothea Lady Banks,
wife of Sir Joseph Banks, and daughter of Wm. Weston-Hugessen, of
Provender, Kent.

1 Captain Cook's Expedition in the Endeavour, equipped by Sir
Joseph Banks, who took with hih Dr. Solander and two
Draughstmen, Buchan and Parkinson. The Endeavour
sailed from Plymouth 25 August, 1768, and reached the
Harbour of Rio de Janeiro on 13 Nov. 1768
A very pine A.L.s. from Sir Joseph Banks to Lord Sandwich,
written from Bio de Janeiro, Dec . 1, 1768, 8 pp. 4to, describing
the voyage and hostility of the Portuguese officials at Eio :
. . . What will most likely surprise your Lordship I have yet to tell
which is the reception we met with here as it is quite extraordinary in
its nature. I shall give a minute detail of the Particulars. On the 13th
. . . we arrived here having sail’d up the river with a very light breeze
& amused ourselves with observing the shore on each side cover’d with
Palm trees a production that neither Dr. Solander or myself had before
seen and from which as well as everything else w'hich we saw we pro-
mised ourselves the highest satisfaction, as soon as we came to anchor a
boat full of arm’d soldiers came from the shore & without saying a word
station’d themselves near our ship, soon after another came off bringing
a colonel and officers of the Portuguese who ask’d many questions but
w'ere satisfied with our answers & told us that the next morn we might
come ashore, in the morn the Captn. went on shore early & we prepared
to have follow’d him but he returned and brought w r ith him an officer
who after some time told us that we should not be allowed to land on
shore at night, however we attempted it but were stop’d & sent aboard
again.
He goes to describe his annoyance at being forced to remain
on the Endeavour:
. . . the people here are ignorant to a degree of wonder of which I
shall give only one instance. When the Captn. first went ashore, the
Viceroy upon being told that the ship was fitted out to observe the
transit of Venus gravely asked whether that was the passing of the North
Star to the South Pole, that alone will I think sufficiently shew your
lordship the state of learning in this place.
The Captn, means to w T rite to the Society an account of this transaction
which I fancy will be very full so I shall not trouble your lordship with
any more particulars but content myself with assuring your Lordship
that I am your affectionate & much obliged
Hble. Servant
Jos. Banks.

2 BOTANICAL AND HORTICULTURAL LETTERS AND
PAPERS WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN
INTEREST

May 3, 1790, concerning a visit to Teneriffe
A. L. s. 2 pp. 4to, Cape, July 20, 1791, he is about to sail for Port
Jackson which he hopes to reach in eight days’ time
A. L. s. 4 pp. folio, Sydney, New South Wales, Oct. 25, 1791, a
letter of great interest :
. . . Very great exertions have been made here, and a vast tract of land
cleared, a number of people have become settlers, one of which has been
some months independant & the rest are making great advances towards
it. From present appearances, I think there is every reason to expect
a plentifull Crop of Indian corn, the wheat has suffered much from the
great droughts . . '. The Natives are now on the most sociable terms with
us . . .
Respecting Norfolk Island, w T e have the most flattering accounts (both
publick & private) of the appearance of a very plentiful harvest. ”
There is a circumstance which will add greatly to the consequences
of this settlement which is the Fishery. Most of the whalers here have
changed their plan of fishing on the West Coast of America. Four of
them sailed yesterday, under a full persuasion of being able to load
their ships in 6 or 8 weeks & not go 30 leagues from hence ... I shall
have upwards of 1000 people on Norfolk.
A. L. s. 4 pp. folio, Norfolk Island, May 8, 1792 ;
. . , our rising generation will be much obliged to you if any method
can be devised to send the small pox matter, so as it may inoculate these
young creatures, for I much fear that if it should make its appearance
here in a few years, that it will sw r eep off a vast number of children . . .
He goes on to give a detailed account of the agricultural
advancement in Norfolk Island
A. L. s. 3 pp. 4to, Norfolk Island, Sept. 1792 :
. . . the 130 settlers I have here are happy & industrious, & will be
very soon independant. Cultivation of all kinds prosper as much as
can be wished . . . everything thrives equal to my expectations . . .
Accept the thanks of a South Sea chief in being remembered by you . . •

far I might have been justified in an observation or conjecture w 7 hich

on -board her (Lt. Flinders and Mr. Geo. Bass the Surgeon of the

for table, necessary linen & materials belonging to the establishment to
support his dignity, as this will lead me to a judgement of my con-

5 ADMIRAL BLIGH AND NEW SOUTH WALES. A superb
series of letters addressed to Sir Joseph Banks
Bligh (Wm.) A. L. s. 5| pp. folio. Cape Town, June 3, 1806 :
. . We happily found this Place in possession of his Majesty’s
Troops and every thing is as tranquil and orderly as you can conceive
... in a few months the Cape will begin again to flourish if it remains
in our hands. Lt. General Sir David Baird has executed every thing
with such promptness & order that the Inhabitants have not found an
inconvenience and I firmly believe the majority of them would rather
be as they are than under the present Dutch Government . . .
“ I am very anxious to proceed to my Government and my mind is
full of confidence in rendering it happy and flourishing as circumstances
can admit.”
He continues his charges against Captain James Short and says that
the Captain is fonder of his bottle than of his duty ;
“ I think that such another vicious evil disposed designing man could
not have been found in the Navy.”
A. L. s. 5 pp. 4to, Government House, Sydney, 26 August, 1806,
announcing his arrival after a passage of 51 days. Has met the
previous Governor, King, who went to Parramatta, an
EXTREMELY INTERESTING LETTER :
. . . after my commission was read and I took the reigns [he] into
my own hands on the 14th inst. His being succeeded by me has given
him great comfort as by my regard for him he has felt no trouble or
uneasiness in arranging his affairs to enable him to quit the Colony with
every satisfaction to himself—you will have heard of great losses which
the settlers have had at the Hawkesbury by the inundation in March
last, the unfortunate settlers are almost ruined and starved which toget-
her with all public stores and buildings being ruined for want of repairs
... I found the Church standing with two sides and one end to it . . .
A. L. s. 8 pp. 4to, Government House, Sydney, November 5, 1806,
A LETTER OF THE GREATEST INTEREST :
. . , The Public Buildings want great repair which with misfortune
of the last crop will perhaps increase my demands on Government.
Added to all these I have many difficulties to encounter both as to the
ways and manners of the Inhabitants, all of which must be touched upon
so lightly that they cannot perceive it until the reform is accomplished
—indeed the Country is in a very poor state, and the customs of the
people very bad. _ .
Spirituous liquors about which so much has been said is still under
baneful regulations, it is allowed as a medium for payment of debts
at the rate of 20 shillings per gallon ...
The next evil which exists is the private notes which are current
about the colony and not liquated with due principle—these notes have
been drawn up with every art and chicanery, but while the confidence
between man and man is not to be disturbed I have very satisfactorily
checked these proceedings & the value of the notes will become recover-
able without any litigation . . .

A. L. s. 6 pp. folio, Government House, Sydney, 10 Octr. 1807 :
... the Colony is recovered from a most deplorable state, indeed, I
can give you every assurance of its now raising its head to my utmost
expectation. The Public Buildings carry an aspect of their value and
private houses the pride of their inhabitants ... In the Interior I feel
satisfied that the same emulation exists among the inhabitants, and their
industry materially increasing , , . The discontented are checked in their
machinations whilst the honest settler feels himself secure, and the Idler
no encouragement.
The Convicts are quiet and orderly as can be expected Provisions of
meat kind are scarce and dear, such as beef and pork at 1/9 pr. lb.
It is owing to a few wealthy Persons who have got great property: but
as we are encouraging deserving Persons, the benefits Government wish
to bestow will become more equally distributed.
[See Illustration.]
A. L, s. a remarkable letter oe 22 pp. folio. Government House,
Sydney, New South Wales, 17 Fehy. 1807, giving a detailed
description of affairs in the colony
He discusses the failure of the harvest and the danger threatening the
Colony thereby; the police and magistrates, the building of schools, the
lack of industry among the settlers. Reports that the Colony contains
395 married women, 1035 concubines, legitimate children 807, and natural
children 1025. Speaks at length on the importation of spirits and his
proposition to prohibit the barter of it being carried on in any way
whatever and the danger of illicit stills. Ho is proceeding with the
building of a church at Sydney, to be finished in six: months.
Reports further trouble with Captain Short, whom he has caused to
be arrested and sent to England. He concludes with asking Banks to
use his influence with the Home Government to procure a grant of law
for himself as Governor, etc.
A. L. s. 11 pp. 4to, Government House Sydney, Nov. 5, 1807 :
. . . This sink of iniquity, Sydney, is improving in its manners & its
concerns. Government is securing its substantive dignity and producing
the consequent good effects on the whole. It is indeed wonderfully
improved—our Church, and publick buildings as stores are respectable
and every person who has a house & garden attends to it. The Police
is regulated in a more mild and decent manner and gives greater
satisfaction, and the Irish convicts are, at present, quiet. I am sure
you are certain how open I am to mercy and compassion, but I arn
equally satisfied you are convinced that no weak feelings will lead me
from my duty ... the people are confident I am my own Counsellor and
their Protector . . .
