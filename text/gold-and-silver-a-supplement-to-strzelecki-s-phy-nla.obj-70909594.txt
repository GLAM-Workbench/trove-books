PREFACE.
My object in publishing this Supplement is less to
claim honour or credit as a discoverer of gold in
Australia, than to protect myself against the impu-
tation of negligence or incapacity as a geological and
mineralogical surveyor.
If the maps, sections, and specimens of rocks
which illustrated my survey of New South Wales
and Van Diemen?s Land were such that their exami-
nation in London, and subsequent comparison with
analogous evidence from the Ural Mountains, led
to the scientific conclusion that gold existed, and
probably abounded, in certain districts of Australia,
I must have been wholly unfit for the self-imposed
undertaking, if, when I made that survey, which
cost me 5000/. and five years of labour, no glim-
mering of this important truth broke upon me. The
following pages will show, however, that in 1839, on
the spot, I arrived at the same conclusions to which,
five years later, the distinguished author of ? Siluria?
was led, without the aid of personal inspection of
the ground.
I have long delayed this publication in the hope of


being able to add to it from official sources; but as
these have remained closed to me, I am obliged to rely
principally upon the reported debates in the Colonial
Legislature. ?lt may be collected from these, that in
1839 I mentioned the existence of a gold field in the
Bathurst District to Sir George Gipps, the then
Governor-General of New South Wales, who re-
quested me to keep the matter secret for fear of the
serious consequences which, considering the condition
and population of the colony, were to be apprehended.
Of course I complied with this request; and I deemed
it my duty, whether right or wrong, to be also silent
on the subject in my book and in my formal com-
munication with learned bodies in Europe; although
I did not conceive myself restricted from mentioning
what had occurred to the private friends of Sir George
Gipps and myself in Sydney.
This is not the place to speculate on the wisdom of
the course adopted by the Governor, but it will be
admitted that if he had ordered or authorised the
immediate prosecution of the requisite researches in
the direction indicated by me, the prosperity in which
the colony is now revelling, together with the reflected
benefits which the mother country enjoys, would
have been accelerated by several years, and (what
more especially concerns me) no doubts would ever
have been raised as to the respective priority or
precedence of discoverers.
The little eagerness I have shown to advance my


claims (be they what they may) will, I hope, render
it almost superfluous for me to state that I am
actuated by no wish to dispute or to depreciate either
the value or the originality of the scientific deduction
which preceded and promoted the practical develop-
ment and confirmation of my views. The energy,
sagacity, and eminent attainments of Sir Roderick
Murchison were never more strikingly nor usefully
displayed than in compelling attention to the hidden
riches of Australia; and the history of science
abounds with instances of competing claims to the
honours of discovery, each of which may be to a
certain degree recognised without impeaching the
soundness or originality of the rest.

PROCEEDINGS
OP THE
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OF NEW
SOUTH WALES,
ON WEDNESDAY, sth OCTOBER, 1853.
CLAIMS TO THE PRIORITY OF DISCOVERY
OF GOLD AND SILVER IN AUSTRALIA.
The Speaker took the Chair at half-past three o'clock.
The message of His Excellency the Governor-Ge-
neral, No. 46., proposing a further gratuity to E.
H. Hargraves, Esq., and the Messrs. Tom and Lister,
having been read, the House, on the motion of the
Auditor-General, went into a Committee of the
whole for the consideration of the same.
The Auditor-General stated that his Excellency
had reviewed his former proposals on this subject,
and came to the determination that the gratuity
already awarded to Mr. Hargraves was not sufficient,
considering the great value and importance of the
services which Mr. Hargraves had rendered to the
colony. His Excellency therefore proposed to add
4000/. to the sum already given, which would make
the total amount of gratuity to Mr. Hargraves
10,000/. His Excellency further proposed that the
A 4


sum of 1000?. be voted as a gratuity to Messrs. Tom
and Lister, for the assistance which they rendered to
Mr. Hargraves in demonstrating his discovery. He
would therefore move the first resolution, as follows:
?? That a sum not exceeding 4000/. be appropriated
as a further gratuity to Edward Hammond Har-
graves, Esq., as the first practical discoverer of gold
in New South Wales in 1851, in addition to the sum
of 6000/. which has already been awarded to him for
the same service.?
Mr. James Macacthur begged to make a few
observations before the motion was put to the Com-
mittee. He objected to the words in his Excellency?s
message which styled Mr. Hargraves as the ? first
discoverer ?of gold. He thought he should be able
to show that Mr. Hargraves had no claim whatever
to be so called?that in fact the only honour which
devolved on him was that of having introduced into
the colony the Californian system of cradle washing.
He (Mr. M.) remembered that so far back as 1839
Count Strzelecki discovered several specimens of gold
in the county of Wellington. These he exhibited to
different gentlemen in Sydney, including Sir George
Gipps, the Governor at the time. Count Strzelecki
repeatedly told him in private conversation that an
extensive gold field existed in the Bathurst district;
but Sir George Gipps had requested him to keep the
matter secret, as, from the penal condition of the
colony in those times, the making known of such a
discovery might have been attended with serious con-
sequences. The discovery, however, was frequently
mooted in the Sydney Morning Herald , in the shape
of letters from Strzelecki and other scientific gentle-
men. He had himself received a letter from this
gentleman on the subject. It had no date, but the
post mark was the 26th October, 1839. The fol-
lowing extract would show conclusively that gold


had been discovered in the colony nearly ten years
ago:
ff I have specimens of excellent coal, some of fine serpentine, with
asbestos, curious native alum, and brown hepatite, fossil bones and
plants, which I digged out from Boree and Wellington Caves, but
particularly a specimen of native silver, in hornblende rock, and gold
in specks in silicate both serving as strong indications of the exist-
ence of these precious metals in New South AVales. It was beyond
my power to trace these veins, or positively ascertain their gauge. I
would have done so with pleasure, pro bono publico, but my time
was short, and so were the hands. I regret that the Govern-
ment, having reserved all the mines for its benefit, did not send here
a scientific man, truly miner and mineralogist, to lay open those hidden
resources, which may prove as beneficial to the State, and individuals,
as the rest of the branches of the colonial industry.?
The same gentleman had also written a letter to Mr.
Thomas Walker on the same subject, expressing in
the most confident manner that a gold field existed
in the Wellington county. He (Mr. M.) remembered
distinctly asking Strzelecki why he did not prosecute
his discoveries farther. The Count replied that the
Governor of the colony had warned him of the mis-
chief that might arise in such times, and requested
him very urgently not to make the discovery gene-
rally known. Soon after this Count Strzelecki sent
a few of the specimens to Berlin, where they were
analysed and compared with samples of gold from
the Ural Mountains. The result of this comparison
and analysis was the placing upon record the supe-
riority of Australian gold over that of the Ural
Mountains. Experience had since proved the truth
and correctness of this analysis. These facts, he
thought, were sufficient to establish Count Strzelecki?s
claim to the honour of being the first discoverer of
gold in this colony. The next gentleman who had
anything like a claim to this distinction was the Rev.
W. B. Clarke, who, in 1841, without any knowledge of
Count Strzelecki?s previous discovery, found gold in
the neighbourhood of the Windburndah. (Here the


learned member quoted several passages from Mr.
Clarke?s evidence given before the select committee
on the Gold Fields Management Bill of last year.)
This evidence fully corroborated the assertions in the
letter of Count Strzelecki in reference to the wish of
Sir George Gipps to suppress all knowledge of the
discovery. It also showed that specimens of gold in
quartz had been found in different periods during
the interval from Strzelecki?s discovery to that of
1851. Mr. Clarke was not in the habit of going out
to search for specimens himself; and the most of
those he had received had been presented to him by
persons to whom he had communicated information
on the subject. In 1844 Mr. Blakefield forwarded
him a fine specimen, which had been obtained in the
district of Bathurst, and which confirmed him in his
previous conviction as to the certainty of an exten-
sive gold field existing in that neighbourhood. Such
were the real facts of the case, and he would put it
to the House to say whether, after a due considera-
tion of those facts, Mr. Hargraves was really and
bond Jide the first discoverer of gold in this colony.
He would now read the amendment which he was
about to propose:?
? That the discovery of gold near Wellington in the year 183.9, hy
Count Strzelecki, and in 1841, near Hartley, by the Rev. W. B.
Clarke, is indisputably established, those gentlemen having communi-
cated the facts above stated to the late Governor Sir George Gipps, at
whose instance, under an apprehension of the disorganising consequences
of such a disclosure, more especially in the state of society then existing
in this colony, they, from motives the most honourable, refrained from
publishing their respective discoveries, which were, however, made
known in confidence to several parties both in this colony and in
Europe.
? That it is further indisputably established that in 1845 and 1846,
Sir Roderick Murchison published a comparison of the Blue Mountains,
or Australian Cordillera, with the gold districts of the Ural, and recom-
mended Cornish miners to emigrate to Australia, for the purpose of
washing for gold in the streams near Bathurst and Adelaide, his views
to this effect being recorded in the Journal of the Royal Geographical
Society of London and the Transactions of the Royal Geological So-


ciety of Cornwall; and that in 1848, having rceived from this colony
specimens of gold, he wrote to the Colonial Minister, Earl Grey, urging
the importance of the discovery.
? That during the years 184-9 and 1850, the fact of this being a gold
country, and the analysis of specimens of Australian gold, became the
subject of repeated notices published in the local journals (especially in
the Sydney Morning Herald ) ; and parties were advised to seek for
gold in the Bathurst district, instead of going in quest of it to Cali-
fornia.
? That it is thus clear thac Mr. E. H. Hargraves can establish no claim
on the ground of original or scientific discovery, but solely upon that of
having introduced in March, 1850, the California mode of cradle wash-
ing, which was followed up to a successful result by his associates
Messrs. Toms and Lister, during his absence at Sydney.?
The honourable member then alluded to a paper
written by Sir Roderick Murchison and published
some years ago in the transactions of the Geological
Journal. In this paper Sir Roderick expressed a
confident opinion that a gold field existed in the
Bathurst country. Of course he formed his opinion
from the specimens forwarded to him. In 1848 he
received a number of very interesting specimens, and
immediately wrote to Earl Grey, informing him of
these facts, and expressing his opinion of the aurife-
rous character of this country. These facts and opi-
nions were still on record in the Colonial Office in
Downing Street, and showed how thoroughly known
was the golden character of this country years before
Mr. Hargraves made his supposed great discovery.
On looking over the Quarterly Review of 1849 and
1850, he was surprised to find an article in which
the colonists were recommended not to proceed to
California but to remain and try their fortunes on the
western gold field. But this was only another proof,
if any were required, that Mr. Hargraves could make
no reasonable claim to the honour of being the first
discoverer. All therefore that Mr. Hargraves had
done was to introduce the system of cradle-washing,
which, with the assistance of Messrs. Tom and Lister,
had been brought to a successful issue. Even in this


matter the assistants seem to be entitled to almost as
much credit as Mr. Hargraves himself, because they
had the honour of finding out the first really available
ground, that hit upon by Mr. Hargraves at first
having proved a failure. Taking all these facts into
consideration, he (Mr. M.) was decidedly of opinion
that the 5000/. or 6000/. already granted to Mr. Har-
graves was a very munificent reward for all his ser-
vices to the colony, especially when it was remem-
bered that he had been in the habit of receiving as
an officer of the gold department 1 /. per day in the
shape of salary and 10s. per day for travelling ex-
penses. With these observations he begged to move
the amendment which he had just read.
The Colonial Secretary said, that he should op-
pose the amendment, and support the original mo-
tion. In doing so, he had not the slightest intention
to detract from the high claims of the scientific gen-
tlemen whose names were included in the amendment
proposed by his hon. friend the member for West
Camden. The high qualities as geologists of Count
Strzelecki, Sir Roderick Murchison, and the Rev.
W. B. Clarke needed no eulogium. The explorations
in these colonies of Count Strzelecki, and his elaborate
and interesting account thereof, had obtained for him
considerable reputation. Sir Roderick Murchison?s
predictions in regard to the gold fields of Australasia,
offered upon the various descriptions of the conti-
nent, had added greatly to his fame; and the inves-
tigations carried out by his (the Colonial Secretary?s)
esteemed friend, the Rev. W. B. Clarke, would place
his name in an enviable position in the scientific
circles of Europe. (Hear.) But yielding to these
gentlemen all the credit to which they were justly
entitled, he would ask whether their investigations
would so soon have been brought to a practical effect
but for the labours of Mr. Hargraves ? He had seen


the process of gold washing in California, and had
practically introduced it here. In the first com-
mencement, it would be said that the results of his
labours were very trifling; but in all cases, of this
kind the actual work of an individual was not to be
taken as a criterion of the permanent effects of his
discovery. No sooner were the proofs of the ex-
istence of gold produced by Mr. Hargraves than
hundreds and hundreds of people hastened to the
diggings, and the result of their labours had not only
changed the aspect of affairs in Australasia, but had
had a wonderful effect on the prosperity of the world
at large. From the cradle introduced by Mr. Har-
graves had emerged a golden baby. (Cheers and
laughter.) He (the Colonial Secretary) did not
mean to contend that Mr. Hargraves was the first
discoverer of gold in New South Wales. Years ago,
M � Gregor, the shepherd, found gold in small quan-
tities, which he used to bring down to Sydney for
sale. In 1848, he (the Colonial Secretary) had in
his possession a nugget of gold weighing three ounces,
which Mr. Smith, to whom allusion had been made,
had obtained, he believed, from Mr. Trappitt, and
which was said to have been found in Lewis Pond
Creek. Mr. Smith claimed a reward from the Go-
vernment for the discovery of gold; but the same
answer was given to him that in 1851 was given to
Mr. Hargraves ?that, upon affording information that
would lead to practical results, he must rely on the
judgment and liberality of the Government. After
allowing the nugget to remain in the possession of
the Government for some three months, Mr. Smith
claimed it, but refused to give any definite informa-
tion as to where it had been found. He (the Colonial
Secretary) had himself, about the same time, ex-
amined a quartz vein in the neighbourhood of the
Belubula river, and had recommended to Mr. Icely


to try the experiment of washing for gold in that
vicinity. His (the Colonial Secretary?s) opinion had
been since proved to be correct, and gold had been
found in that and other vicinities to which he had
recommended attention. The golden discovery in
its great extent had, then, nearly been made in 1848,
and for years before that minute quantities had been
frequently found; but it was to the practical know-
ledge acquired by Mr. Hargraves in California that
this colony was indebted for the millions of treasure
which, but for his labours, would have been perhaps
even to this day unknown. He (the Colonial Secre-
tary) sincerely believed that the higher reward now
proposed to be given to Mr. Hargraves ought to be
freely conceded by the House. When it was con-
sidered that every interest in this colony, without
any exception whatever, had so greatly benefited by
the gold discoveries, surely a gratuity of 10,000/.
could not be grudged to him whose practical expe-
rience had brought about this most extraordinary
change. He hoped that the committee would see
every reason to affirm the motion before it ; and with
reference to the resolution in respect to the gratuity
proposed to be given to the Messrs. Tom and Lister,
he would add his opinion that those parties were en-
titled to it, having been most useful in developing
the discovery.
Mr. Holroyd quite agreed with what had fallen
from the Colonial Secretary in respect to the claims
of the Messrs. Tom and Lister, the treatment of whom
by Mr. Hargraves, he thought, should be strongly
deprecated. He would draw attention to a letter
from the latter which had been published in the
Sydney Morning Herald of Thursday last; in which
he had given a most exaggerated account of some
brawl in which the parties in question had been en-
gaged, and wherein he stated that it had been his


intention to have made Mr. Lister and the others a
present of 1000/. Now, this was a very queer way
of evincing gratitude?the asserting at the eleventh
hour of this very liberal profession. Did Mr. Har-
graves really think the Council were such geese as to
believe that when that letter was written, and when
Mr. Hargraves, it was to be supposed, had no expec-
tation of a gratuity beyond 5000/., that he really in-
tended to give his colleagues, as he called them, one-
fifth of that sum. (Hear, hear.) What he (Mr. Hol-
royd) complained of was that the Government had
not made up their minds sooner, and proposed to give
a fixed sum at once. From the official documents it
was seen that in August 1852, fifteen months after
the gold discovery, the Executive Council, after full
consideration, and with the effects of the gold dis-
coveries in California and Victoria to guide them,
recommended that 5000/. be given as an entire gra-
tuity to Mr. Hargraves. This proposed addition of
4000/. he (Mr. Holroyd) did not intend to oppose;
but he could not refrain from expressing his regret
at the bad taste evinced by Mr. Hargraves in depre-
ciating the exertions of those who really were, in
point of fact, the first practical discoverers of gold in
New South Wales. In a letter addressed to Mrs.
Lister, in the early part of 1851, when Mr. Har-
graves was at Brisbane Water, and the Messrs. Tom
and Lister were engaged in prospecting in the
Western district, he expressed his hope that their
efforts would be successful, but adverted to the ex-
penses of the undertaking, and regretted his inability
to defray them. After that letter was written the
four ounces of gold were found, which was the first
confirmation of the great fact of the gold fields ; but
it was clear that no fatigue had been sustained by
Mr. Hargraves, who, in vulgar parlance, seemed to
have a great propensity to send the hat round, and-


who at this present time was living in clover as the
guest of the Listers. Yet his letter to the Lieute-
nant-Governor of Victoria contained a pathetic de-
scription of the perilous dangers which he had
encountered, of the rheumatic pains which had
afflicted him, and his fears that they would only
terminate with the grave. All this, be it remem-
bered, was in the finest and warmest season of the
year; and certainly anybody acquainted with the
robust, burly, and anti-rheumatic person of Mr.
Hargraves would say that in these melancholy anti-
cipations of pains in his limbs, and other sad calami-
ties he had drawn a picture not likely to be realised.
(Loud laughter.) However, it was not his intention
to deny Mr. Hargraves? claim to ample remuneration.
He trusted that this vote was to be considered the
ultimatum, and that the thing would be got rid of.
Mr. Wentworth would support the amendment of
the honourable member for West Camden, although
he had no expectation of its being carried. He con-
sidered the reward proposed to be conferred on Mr.
Hargraves was unmerited; indeed, he considered him
to be entitled to nothing. As to every interest in
the colony having been benefited by the discovery
of the gold, that might, for the time, be true as to
pocket interests; but was the moral deterioration of
a community not to be considered when material
interests were discussed ? Did not all history show
that the fatal discovery of gold entailed concomitant
evils far greater than any good which it produced ?
It was said that the value of property had increased
by reason of our gold fields. That might be true
now, but he believed that the ultimate balance would
be against the colony, and that the result to future
generations would be most injurious. He (Mr.
Wentworth) was sorry that in his message to that
House, proposing this additional gratuity to Mr.


Hargraves, the Governor-General had been betrayed
into an inaccuracy in regard to describing Mr. Har-
graves as the first discoverer of gold in the colony.
In respect to the part which he (Mr. Wentworth)
had taken in this question, a great deal of personal
invective had been addressed to him. With regard
to Mr. Hargraves, he (Mr. Wentworth) could only
say that he knew nothing at all about him, nor did
he want to know anything. From the little he had
seen of him, he did not desire to see any more. He
thought that he might have been satisfied, indeed he
believed that he would have been satisfied, with the
5000/. previously proposed. (? Ko, no,? from the
Colonial Secretary.) The animadversions made by
Mr. Hargraves through the newspapers, meant to be
severe, and complaining most bitterly of the inquisi-
torial examination of himself before the Select Com-
mittee on the gold fields, were perfectly ludicrous.
The poor man had obviously no very great knowledge
of the Spanish Inquisition to which he so foolishly
alluded. He certainly had given his evidence in a
remarkable manner; but it was clear that he neither
saw the drift of the questions, nor could he be made
to comprehend the reasons for putting them. How-
ever, notwithstanding the hardship of which he com-
plained, he, meeting himself (Mr. Wentworth) in
Bent-street after the publication of the committee?s
report, came across the street and thanked him for
the very handsome mention made of his name in that
document. He (Mr. W.) told him that he had
nothing to thank him for (laughter) ; but although
Mr. Hargraves seemed very well satisfied then, he
had since changed his tune, and now wanted 10,000/.
in place of 5000/. He (Mr. W.) did not expect to
alter the opinion of the Council. For himself, he
conscientiously believed the proposed gratuity far too
hiffh; and he did not think the introduction here of
O /


a California cradle sufficient groundwork for such
unfounded liberality. If Mr. Hargraves was to have
this large sum, what ought those to have who taught
him the use of the cradle in California ? The Ame-
ricans were far wiser than us; they paid no rewards
for the discovery of gold, but considered that the
miners who dug for the gold were amply repaid by
the yield of their industry. Now Mr. Hargraves had
not been very eminent as a miner here; indeed his
exertions and discoveries when he first returned from
California were inconsiderable; the result being a
few grains of gold which he brought down in a bit
of paper in his breeches pocket, and which were
deemed unworthy of attention by those who knew
that much larger quantities had been found here long
ago. To one fact he (Mr. Wentworth) could not
help alluding. In Mr. Hargraves? prospecting tours
he had made them at other people?s expense, more
especially at the expense of the Listers, and yet he
now had not the gratitude to allow his colleagues the
least merit for their exertions. Supposing that the
four ounces of gold (to which allusion had been
already made) had not been found, would not Mr.
Hargraves have given up the search at once, and re-
turned to California ? It was well known that such
was his intention; and supposing that he had gone,
and that these young men had gone on prospecting
with persevering industry, and had proved the great
fact of the gold fields, would they or Mr. Hargraves
have been entitled to the reward as the actual dis-
coverers ? He (Mr. Wentworth) maintained that to
treat Mr. Hargraves as the discoverer was most er-
roneous.
Hr. Douglass had heard the hon. and learned
member for Sydney frequently express his opinion
that the evils of the gold discovery far outweighed
any good which it had brought about. Upon that


point he was at issue with his hon. and learned friend.
Whilst every material interest had improved, what
moral injury could be shown ? Taking the vast in-
crease of our population into consideration, he (Dr.
Douglass) would fearlessly assert that, whether as
regarded offences against person or property, or
minor offences, such as drunkenness and the like, the
proportion of crime to the population was now far
smaller than at any other period of the history of the
colony. His hon. and learned friend had admitted
that much prosperity now existed, but he talked
prophetically of bad times to come. Surely that was
not worthy of a mind like his! With reference to
the slighting manner in which Mr. Hargraves? intro-
duction here of the Californian cradle, pray would
the Messrs. Tom and Lister have known anything
about its use but for Mr. Hargraves ? The hon.
member for West Camden had, in his usual felicitous
manner, expressed his desire to place upon record his
sense of the high claims of Sir Roderick Murchison,
Count Strzelecki, and the Rev. W. B. Clarke, but
these claims were matters of scientific history, were
fully recognised throughout Europe, and surely
ought not to interfere with the reward to be given
to the really practical discoverer. The scientific
predictions of Sir Roderick Murchison and others re-
flected the highest credit upon them; but whilst
they were saying, ? you will find gold in Australia,?
Mr. Hargraves said, ? I have found it; and by thus
finding it, this colony will be raised to a great em-
pire.? Therefore, he (Dr. Douglass) implored that
Council not to allow this gentleman to go to England
and tell the people there that a trumpery addition of
4000/. to the gratuity first proposed to be awarded
was niggardly refused.
Mr. James Macarthur would only observe, in
reference to the allusion made by the last speaker to


his (Mr. M.?s) wish to enforce the claims of the
distinguished man of science named in the resolu-
tions which he had done himself the honour to
propose, he had been taught to believe that the
tribute of public praise and reward should be reserved
for distinguished and honourable achievements;
and he could not conceive that the introduction here
of cradle washing was a thing to overthrow moral
and social considerations. The Colonial Secretary-
had asserted that the gold discovery had enhanced
every interest in the colony. (Hear, from the
Colonial Secretary.) He (Mr. Macarthur) heard
that cheer and feared that it was the harbinger of
bitter evils to the colony. To what purpose, he asked,
was the use of gold, when a community was reduced
to a state of semi-barbarism ? Did not this colony
now import almost every article of necessity and
comfort clothes, boots and shoes, furniture, and
the like, from foreign countries ? Those countries
had been the real gainers by our gold discoveries;
this colony the loser. He (Mr. M.) believed, how-
ever, that the British character would still be
preserved here, and that the baneful lust of gold
would yet be countervailed. The hon. member
dwelt at some length on the deterioration of Aus-
tralian wools, already complained of by the English
manufacturers; and expressed his belief that so far
from the producing interests of the colony being
enhanced by the gold discoveries, they had been
paralysed. He expressed his belief that had the
gold not been discovered, the present prosperity of
New South Wales would have been much greater
than it is. He then quoted some passages from
Mr. Hargraves? evidence before the Gold Fields
Committee, contrasting the expose of his modest
assurance which they afforded with the highminded
conduct of Count Strzelecki and the Rev. W. B.


Clarke, who had nobly foregone the honours to which
they were entitled, from a deep sense of public duty.
The Attorney-General had not intended to take
any part in this discussion, but he could not refrain
from expressing his gladness that in the honourable
and learned member for Sydney, and the honourable
member for West Camden, two champions of the
moral interests of the colony, had arisen?both
gentlemen having been so very lately the warm
champions of the renewal of transportation to these
shores. (Loud cries of hear.)
Mr, James Macarthur denied that either himself
or the honourable and learned member for Sydney
had advocated the renewal of transportation in the
ordinary sense of the word, (Oh, oh.) They had
merely stated the terms on which they believed it
would be expedient to receive exiles. (Oh, oh.)
The Attorney-General feared that the hon.
member?s explanation of the matter left it very much
as it was. (Hear, hear.) For himself, he firmly
believed that the gold discoveries had greatly im-
proved the moral interests of the colony. It had
effectually put a stop to the odious transportation
question; and (to use the memorable words of the
hon. and learned member for Sydney) had ?pre-
cipitated this colony into a great nation.? (Loud
cheers.) Crime had decreased, and wealth, pros-
perity, and happiness pervaded the land. With
reference to the opposition raised to Mr. Hargraves?
claims, he thought it very unfair. That this gentle-
man might have evinced some bad taste in writing
to the newspapers was not the question to decide.
There were, doubtless, faults on both sides; but
Mr. Hargraves had been assailed by the parties in
question in a manner that was scarcely justifiable.
Private conversations had been divulged in a way
that was not gentlemanly, and he had been much


provoked. He (the Attorney-General) hoped that
full justice would be cordially awarded to the first
practical discoverer of the gold fields of Australia.
Mr. Nichols said that he quite agreed with what
had fallen from the lion, and learned Attorney-General
in regard to the decrease of crime in New South
Wales since the discovery of the gold. This opinion
had been publicly expressed from the Bench of the
Supreme Criminal Court, and he (Mr. N.) sincerely
believed it to be the true one. He then adverted at
some length to the admission made by the hon.
member for West Camden, that he still thought
exiles would be desirable to receive here as labourers;
and whilst he denounced these as the worst class of
criminals, he expressed his earnest hope that to none
of the colonies of Australasia would any more
offenders be sent from the mother country.
The question was then put on the original motion,
which was carried by a majority of 24 to 7.

The second resolution was then agreed to, namely?
That a sum not exceeding 1000/. be appropriated as
a gratuity, to be divided equally between Messrs,
William Tom, junior, James Tom, and John Lister,
in consideration of their instrumentality, in a sub-
ordinate degree, in the discovery of gold in this
colony, in the year 1851.
The Times of January 16th, 1854, commenting
upon the above proceedings of the Legislative Coun-
cil, says in one of the leading articles:?
? Now that we have been for two years and a half
familiarised with the astonishing discovery of Aus-
tralian gold, we are beginning gradually to attain
some knowledge of the discoverers. The mineralogi-
cal Columbus has already taken a mythic shape,
sometimes assuming, according to the varieties of
the legend, the form of a German Count, sometimes
of an English Knight, sometimes of a Californian
miner, sometimes of a Botany Bay convict of the
most felonious description, and sometimes of an or-
thodox divine of the Church of England. For the
benefit of some future Niebuhr, who will probably
extract from it much meaning and significance as
bearing on the state of Australia a few thousand years
hence, we propose to record the legend in its most
authentic form, leaving posterity to discover the
particular significance of the dramatis personae, and
what allegorical meaning lurks under the names of
? the Count,? ? the Knight,? 1 the miner,? ? the convict,?
and 1 the parson.?
? The first in order of time?who may be said to
bear the same ratio to Mr. Hargraves as Prince
Madoc did to Columbus?was a convict, who de-
clared himself to have discovered gold, but, failing
to point out the spot of the discovery, received, with


that injustice which so frequently waits on great men,
150 lashes, such as lashes were in those days in
Botany Bay, for his pains, and was condemned to
wear a smock-frock with the letter 4 R? worked upon
it, ?so little flattering was the first commencement
of metallurgical research on the new continent.
While deploring the misfortunes of this ingenious
person, we are bound to say that his claim to any
discovery at all is something more than questionable,
not only on account of his own assertion, to which,
probably, a discriminating public may feel justified
in not attaching much weight, but because he
claimed to have made his discoveries in the immediate
neighbourhood of Sydney, where we are not aware
that any subsequent investigation has demonstrated
the presence of the precious metal.
? The next claimant for the honours of discovering
Australian gold is the distinguished German traveller,
Count de Strzelecki, who did undoubtedly discover
the existence of gold in the Australian colonies as
early as 1839. In a speech made by Mr. James
Macarthur, in last October, in the Sydney Legislative
Council, it is stated that Count de Strzelecki exhibited
specimens of gold, found by him in the district of
Wellington, to the then Governor, Sir George Gipps,
and many other gentlemen. What follows we give
in the speaker?s own words: ?Count de Strzelecki
frequently told him, in private conversation, that an
extensive gold field existed in the Bathurst district,
but Sir George Gipps had requested him to keep the
secret, as, from the penal condition of the colony in
those times, the making known such a discovery might
have been attended with serious consequences.? Mr.
Macarthur also produced a letter from Count Strze-
lecki, of the 26th of October, 1839, in which he men-
tions his having discovered gold in specks in silicate.
But this Leibnitz had also his Newton. Without
any knowledge of Count de Strzelecki?s discoveries,


the Rev. Mr. Clarke had come to a similar conclusion
in 1841?a conclusion, however, which was not made
public, for similar reasons. In 1844 Sir Roderick
Murchison was led by scientific considerations of the
geological structure of Australia, and by a comparison
of specimens furnished to him by Count de Strzelecki
with others obtained by himself from the Ural Moun-
tains, to believe that extensive gold fields were to be
found in Australia, to urge the unemployed Cornish
miners to seek their fortune in this promising region,
and to place on record his opinion in the volumes of
the Royal Geographical Society and of the Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall. From that time
forth till 1851 specimens of native gold were ex-
hibited in the windows of the jewellers? shops in
Sydney, and a general impression existed that some-
where in the remote interior it might be met with in
large quantities. It is only due to Mr. Hargraves,
however, to say that, by applying the practical know-
ledge he had gained as a miner in California, he first
carefully tested the existence of the metal in quantities
sufficient to make it worth looking after, and, by
addressing himself to the public instead of the Govern-
ment, put it out of the power of the colonial bureau-
cracy to stand any longer between the world and this
great discovery. For this great service he has at
length received the tardy and not very liberal re-
muneration of 10,000/.; and the man who has opened
exhaustless treasures, such as eastern fable never
dreamt of, to the possession of this country, has been
presented with a moderate competence as the reward
of a secret which, had he sold it, Avould have been
cheaply purchased at a million.
?As we have described the matter, there is nothing
incompatible in the claims of the different discoverers.
The convict imagined the thing; Count de Strze-
lecki and Air. Clarke ascertained it by examination;


Sir R. Murchison deduced it from theory; and Mr.
Hargraves re-discovered it and gave it publicity and
a practical form. As far as the competition among
these persons goes there is nothing more to say, but
a few reflections will suggest themselves as to another
of the actors in this remarkable drama. What would
have been the history and what the state of the world
at this moment if Sir George Gipps had not, from
views of the most narrow, temporary, and provisional
expediency, stifled the great discovery which Count
de Strzelecki had communicated to him ? What ad-
vancement of trade, what increase of commerce-, what
stimulus for all the arts of peace, what augmentation
of the general happiness of the human race! The
population of Australia would probably count ten to
one of its present numbers, and the trade with so
large a population would have directed a stream of
almost boundless wealth to our shores. Who can
tell what might have been the effect of this discovery
at the time of the Irish famine, or how much of the
labour which perished in the workhouses of the West
might have been now producing in comfort and
affluence all the elements of wealth ? It is a melan-
choly reflection that all these advantages, and a
thousand others that w r ould have flowed from them,
should have been so long lost to the world, and all
for fear that a few thieves should benefit by the dis-
covery ! ?
Sir David Brewster, in reviewing Sir Roderick
Murchison?s ? Siluria ? in the North British Review
for August, 1854, refers (page 530.) to the question
of the discovery of gold, as follows:
?When Sir Roderick returned, in 1844, from his
examination of the Ural Mountains, and had the ad-
vantage of examining the rocks, fossils, and maps of


his friend Count Strzelecki, collected along the
eastern chain of Australia, he was struck with the
similarity between their structure and that of the
Blue Mountains, which he called the Australian Cor-
dillera, in which, in so far as he knew, no gold had
been discovered; and he was thus impressed with
the conviction that gold would sooner or later be
found in the British colony. This opinion was an-
nounced to the Geographical Society, when, in his
Presidential Address in 1844, he mentioned the work
of Count Strzelecki, on the physical geography of
Australia. In 1846, his opinion was confirmed by
some specimens of gold quartz which had been dis-
covered in Australia. Thus fortified in his convic-
tions, he, in the same year, at a meeting of the Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall, incited the supera-
bundant Cornish tin miners to emigrate to the
colony, and to obtain gold from the ancient alluvia,
as they extracted tin from the gravel of their native
county. This advice, printed in the Cornish journals,
and transmitted to Sydney, was given in the year
previous to the discovery of gold in California.
Upon our author?s return from the Continent in
1848, and finding that specimens of Australian gold
had been sent to him, he addressed a letter, on the
sth November, 1848, to Earl Grey, the Colonial
Secretary, stating his views on the subject, mention-
ing the actual discovery of gold ore, and urging
upon the Government a well-regulated search for it.
Lord Grey seems to have taken no notice of this
communication, imagining, as he afterwards con-
fessed to our author, that the discovery of gold would
be very embarrassing to a wool-growing country.
Such is the history of Sir Roderick Murchison?s un-
doubted claim to be the first person who called the
attention of Government to the actual existence of
gold in Australia.
? Unknown, however, to Sir Roderick, its actual dis-


covery in that colony had been previously made by
Count Strzelecki. This eminent geologist, when
surveying New South Wales, discovered in 1839, in
Boree and Wellington Caves, distinct specks of gold
in silicate, and of native silver in hornblende rock.
? So great was Count Strzelecki?s anxiety upon this
subject, that he wrote another* letter to Mr. Thomas
Walker, stating, in the most confident terms, that a
gold field existed in the Wellington county. The
Count had previously exhibited his specimens of gold
to Sir George Gipps, the Governor of the colony, and
had repeatedly told him of the existence of a gold
field in the Bathurst district; but Sir George advised
him to keep the discovery secret, on the ground that,
in the penal condition of the colony, much mischief
might arise from its publication. Soon after this
the Count sent to Berlin a few of his specimens,
which were analysed, and found to be superior to the
gold of the Ural Mountains. In 1841 the Rev. W.
B. Clarke discovered gold in the neighbourhood of
the Windburndale; and 1844 he obtained a fine spe-
cimen from Mr. Blakefield, which had been obtained
in the district of Bathurst.
?Notwithstanding these discoveries, theoretical and
practical, no decided step was taken to draw from
the Australian rocks, or their accompanying alluvia,
the valuable metal which they bore. An impulse of
the smallest kind was alone wanting to excite the
activity of the colonists. So early as 1849 an appli-
cation was made to the Government at Sydney by a Mr.
Smith (who in 1848 had placed in the hands of the
Colonial Secretary a nugget of gold of three ounces),
to ascertain what reward would be given by Govern-
ment for the discovery of a gold district. The Go-
vernment declined to make any bargain with Mr.
Smith, but expressed their willingness to give a
suitable reward for any real discovery. Two years

nearly passed away without any other application, till
Mr. E. H. Hargraves returned, in March 1851, from
California, in consequence of having remarked the
similarity in the structure of the Sierra Nevada in
California, and the Blue Mountains of Australia.
Soon after his arrival in the colony he addressed a
letter to the Colonial Secretary, offering to point out
a considerable gold-bearing district, on the condition
of receiving 500�. when the truth of his statement
was ascertained. The Governor made the same
reply to this offer, and Hargraves, relying on his
justice, indicated the Macquarrie river, with the
Lewis and Summerhill creeks branching from it, as
the auriferous locality which he had mentioned. The
Government Surveyor, to whom the communications
were referred, having been dilatory in making his
report, Hargraves took labourers to the creek at
Summerhill, and on the Bth of May he announced
the discovery of several ounces of gold, obtained by
the method of cradle-washing, which he had brought
from California. On the 15th of May a piece of
gold weighing thirteen ounces was found; and the
excitement thus became so great, that hundreds in-
stantly set out for the diggings, and the gold field of
Sommerhill speedily received the name of Ophir. On
the 19th of May, the geological surveyor, on arriving
at the creek found about 400 persons, within the
length of a mile, collecting from one to two ounces
daily. The rights of the crown were immediately
asserted. Licenses for 1/. 10s. per month were to be
granted to all persons not absent from service with-
out leave; and Sir Charles Fitzroy established police
stations, and gave a Government escort for the trans-
mission of the gold, at the charge of one per cent, on
the value. On the 2nd of June, when 1500 persons
were assembled, licenses were granted. In the
month of June 605 licenses were issued, and the pro-


duce of the field was estimated at 30,000/. Har-
graves now received his 500/. and an appointment
as a Commissioner of Crown Lands, with a promise
of additional remuneration should circumstances jus-
tify it.
?In other tributaries of the Macquarrie, namely,
the Turon and the Meroo, still richer gold fields were
found. Mr. Stutchbury, the Government Surveyor,
found that the gold was distributed more evenly
over the bed of the Turon than in other localities.
The valley of this river is flanked by distant hills of
mica slate without quartz veins. The gold was dis-
tributed in the soil ?as regularly as wheat in a sown
field.? Nearer the source of the river the soil was
richer, and upon trying it, three men in four days
obtained 10 lbs. weight of gold. A thousand men
were soon assembled at the river, and their average
gain was about an ounce daily for each man. The
course of the stream was declared by Mr. Hargraves
to be auriferous for 130 miles!
? In the Louisa creek, branching from the Meroo, a
native shepherd, in Dr. Kerr?s service, discovered
gold in blocks of quartz. From the largest block of
75 lbs. 60 lbs. of gold were obtained, and from the
whole mass 106 lbs. As Dr. Kerr had no license, the
gold was seized; but as this was the first discovery
of the kind, the Government liberally abandoned its
claim, and Dr. Kerr became possessed of his 6000/.
prize. From the same spot another lump imbedded
in quartz weighed 336 ounces, and was sold by
auction for 1155/. Other gold fields were discovered
in the Araluen, a tributary of the Dena river ; and a
large auriferous track has been found, extending from
the tributaries of the Condamine and the Brisbane on
the north, to branches of the Murray river on the
south.
? These discoveries, however, have been surpassed


by those in Van Diemen?s Land. The traders in the
colony of Victoria having suffered from the flight of
their best servants to the gold fields in New South
Wales, offered a reward of 200 guineas to the dis-
coverer of a gold locality within 120 miles of Mel-
bourne. In a short time a gold field was found at
Anderson creek, only 16 miles from Melbourne,
another at Clunes, 90 miles to the north, and a third
at Ballarat, near the volcanic hill of Boninyon, and
not far from the source of the river Lea. To this
last locality, the richest of them all, hundreds of
adventurers immediately flocked, and assembled at
the most productive spot termed Golden Point.
Governor Latrobe put in force the regulations
adopted at Sydney, and personally examined the
excavations which were made. Under the super-
ficial soil he found the following beds :
1. Red ferruginous earth and gravel.
2. Yellowish and red clay streaked.
3. Quartz gravels of moderate size.
4. Large quartz pebbles and boulders, with masses of iron-stone set
in very compact clay.
5. Blue and white clay.
6. Pipe-clay.
u Gold was here discovered even in the superficial
soil, but most copiously in the small veins of blue
clay in the fifth bed, above the pipe-clay, in which
no gold is found. The gold, which is apparently
quite pure, occasionally presents itself in irregular
rolled or water-worn lumps of different sizes, incor-
porated sometimes with round pebbles of quartz,
which seems to have been its original matrix, at
other times in irregular round or small pieces un-
mixed, and also in fused irregular masses of pure
gold. No fewer than 2500 persons had congregated
at these diggings ; and, according to Mr. Latrobe,
one party is known to have raised 16 lbs. at an early
period of the day, and in one day 31 lbs. During


his visit 10 lbs. was the produce of a single washing
in a day. When this intelligence reached Geelong
and Melbourne, neither of them above fifty miles
distant, their inhabitants flocked to the Ballarat
diggings ; and in the month of October the steady
workers amounted to 3000.
? Greater discoveries still were about to be made.
At Mount Alexander, forty miles north of Ballarat,
and seventy-five from Melbourne, a shepherd found
gold incased in a piece of quartz ; and from a seam of
this compact mineral nearly 400/. was taken in the
course of a fortnight; and gold was subsequently found
copiously diffused in the gravelly soil. The news of
this discovery attracted adventurers from all the
other gold diggings. Seamen forsook their ships,
shopkeepers left their professions, respectable indi-
viduals gave up places of trust, the clerks and func-
tionaries in public offices disappeared, and in the
month of December 1200 men occupied an area of
fifteen square miles. The license was doubled by the
Government, but the diggers having met in thou-
sands to resist this ill-judged proceeding, and the Go-
vernment being unable to enforce its regulations, the
increased fee was abandoned. In the last quarter of
1851 the licenses yielded 25,481/., and in the first
quarter of 1852 they rose to 48,597/. At the end of
March 1852 the following were the results of the
diggings at Victoria:
Gold shipped at Melbourne (and waiting to be shipped) 700,000 oz.
Value, at SI. per ounce - - * 2,100,0001. Os.
Licenses issued up to the end of March - 49,380/. Os.
Monthly average earning of each licensed digger 42/. 10s.
?At the same period the following were the results
in New South Wales:?
Amount of gold raised there - 320,000 oz.
Value, at SI. per ounce - 960,000/. Os.
Licenses issued - - ? 30,73 !*? o**
Monthly average earning of each licensed digger 31/. Ss.


?In his address to the Geographical Society, on
the 23rd May, 1853, Sir Roderick Murchison states
that he has reason to believe that nearly twenty mil-
lions sterling of gold have been extracted from Victoria
and New South Wales in the last year.
?At a meeting of the Legislative Council of Sydney,
on the sth October, 1853, the proposition of the
Government to grant a reward of 10,000/. to Mr.
Hargraves, and of 1000/. to Messrs. William Tom,
junior, James Tom, and John Leslie, was carried by
a majority of 24 to 7.
?Such is a brief history of the gold diggings in Aus-
tralia. To Count Strzelecki we owe the great dis-
covery of the precious metal, and to Sir Roderick
Murchison the independent merit of having, without
any knowledge of what had previously been done,
pointed out to the authorities the theoretical exist-
ence of gold in the Australian Cordillera. The in-
dividuals who followed them in the prosecution of
this great discovery have been enriched and rewarded,
but neither the colony nor the mother-country have
expressed even their gratitude to the men who threw
the light of practical and theoretical science among
the buried treasures of their colony.?
