POEM OF P. H. PEARSE TO HIS MOTHER.
(Written a few hours before his death.)
Oh! Mother dear, the last few hours
Are slipping fast away;
They’ve told me that the end must come
At dawning of the day.
I begged, I prayed, that I might see
Your dear face once again;
The tyrant’s heart is cold and cruel,
My pleading was in vain;
But tyrants cannot chain the heart,
Or make the thoughts less free,
And Mother, heart and thoughts are full
Of Ireland, and of thee.
Oh! think not, believe not, Mother,
It grieves me thus to die,
I’ll face the musket proudly,
When my hour comes, by and bye.
A soldier’s death for Motherland,
To fall in Freedom’s fight,
’Tis the death I wished for ever,
And ’tis coming with the light;
No sorrowing shall unman me,
In that grim hour of dawn,
The world holds naught to grieve for' -
Save you-
And you—you must not mourn the life
Which I so freely give;
Oh! what matter, Mother, dearest,
That I die, if Ireland live.
Some sacrifice is needed, sure,
That Erin may be free;
We’ll offer up my life for that
To God —from you and me.
And perhaps He’ll take our offering,
And you’ll live to say jvitlrpride:
“I grieve not for the boy I lost,
’Twas not in vain he died.”
Ah! well I know the bitter words
That foe and coward will speak,
And well I know they’ll strive to slight
The deeds of Easter Week.
Let coward and foeman do their worst,
They cannot kill our cause,
And men will rise in every age
Against the tyrants’ laws.
When Freedom’s sun shines out again,
And Darkness yields to Light,
The Ireland of that blessed day
Will know that we did right
The holy Priest has shrived me now,
My soul is freed from stain;
The Bread of Life within me
Will rob my death Of pain;
And soon before the Father’s throne.
I’ll join the gallant band
Of those who died for Motherland.
And our prayers shall rise unceasing,
To the Feet of Mary’s Son,
And we’ll know no joy in Heaven
Till our cause at last is won.
God rest the lads who fell in fight!
My comrades, tried and true.
Oh! Irishmen, must ne’er forget
That unbought, faithful few.
And, Mother, be your proudest boast,
That, in his Country’s need,
When hero-valour fired each breast,
Your son was chosen to lead.
And now, a last and fond farewell—
’Tis not for long we part—
And, Mother, when I face their guns,
I’ll call you in my heart.
SID MADDEN, Printer, George-st West. Tel., M 1748.
