The Lakes Trip.
Fta SALE.
ON arrival of the morning train from Melbourne at Sale in the summer
season, it is necessary to go on board the Lakes steamer at once,
as the vessel’s departure takes place within a quarter of an hour of
the train reaching Sale. Cabs ply between the station and the wharf.
Luncheon may be obtained on board. In the winter, as the boat’s
departure is delayed, refreshments can be partaken of at the railway
rooms or at one of the local hotels.
Casting off from the Sale wharf daily at 1.45 p.m. in the summer, or
3 p.m. in the winter, the steamer Dargo or Omeo runs down a short canal
to the Thompson River. About 3 miles distant is the junction of the
Thompson and Glengarry, which united flow towards Lake Wellington
as the Latrobe River. At this point the water is spanned by a swing
bridge which is moved to mid-stream to afford passage to the larger
lakes vessels.
Following the course of the Latrobe the country is fairly level, the
native foliage which decks the banks of the stream adds charm to this
portion of the trip, and in the spring time, when the wattle is in full
bloom, the passage is along a river flanked with green and gold, and
the air is heavy with the scent of the acacia. Twelve miles farther
steaming from the Latrobe bridge and Lake Wellington is reached, and
in about an hour McLennan’s Strait is entered ; 40 minutes being occupied
in traversing this passage, including a stoppage at Seacombe. Then
comes Lake Victoria, much narrower and infinitely more interesting
than Wellington, as the shore lines are closer and frequently indented
by pretty bays and sheltered inlets.
Paynesville is the next port of call, and continuing the journey by
McMillan’s Strait, the passage across Lake King is begun. Nine miles
farther to Bancroft Bay, and Metung is reached, then more narrow water,
and, as one nears Kalimna, wooded heights and tiny inlets come into
view, making a strong contrast with the previous portion of the trip.
Now the light fades, and the steamer’s syren sends shrill blasts
echoing and re-echoing amongst the lulls, warning Kalinina’s residents
of the vessel’s approach, lights appear on the jetty, a momentary stoppage
is made to disembark passengers, then on again for another 10 minutes
of half-speed steaming, past the channel lights to Cunninghame, and rest.
Via BAIRNSDALE.
The steamers Gippsland and J.C.D. run between Bairnsdale and
Cunninghame, and one or other vessel leaves Bairnsdale wharf, on the


Mitchell River, daily at 4 p.m. Passengers are conveyed from the
railway station to the steamer’s side in cabs, the distance being about
three-quarters of a mile.
Once beyond the outskirts of the town, the river flats, famous as a
maize-growing area, are passed, and when 5| miles have been covered
fhe level land gives way to broken country and Eagle Point comes into
view. From this bold headland the view extends many miles over
river, lake, hill, and dale. The river course continues through a narrow
neck of land for another miles ; indeed, so limited is the width of the
banks that a stone thrown from the vessel’s deck would lodge in Lake King
on the right, or Jones’ Bay on the left hand. After clearing the mouth
of the river, a course is shaped across Lake King to Metung, with a diver-
sion to Paynesville on Fridays, which adds 10 miles to the trip. With
the exception of Tyers, King is, perhaps, the most beautiful of all the
lakes, its well-timbered banks presenting bolder features and greater
diversity of scenery in their alternating series of hills and hollows than
are possessed by the other lakes in the group.
The course steered from Metung to Cunninghame is the same as
that taken by the Sale steamer.
SALE.
{Population, 3,700.)
Sale is 128 miles from Melbourne on the Thompson River, and ranks
as a borough. The streets are broad and the intersecting thoroughfares
cross at right angles. Amongst the principal buildings are the Municipal
Offices, Technical and Art School, with a library of 4,000 well selected
volumes, and the usual public edifices. The appearance of the business
portion of the town is that of decided prosperity ; water and gas services
have been established. The gardens on the farther shore of Lake
Guthridge, which is 60 acres in extent, form a picturesque reserve
devoted to public use.
A drive to Hilltop is full of interest; the distance from Sale is 4 miles
in a southerly direction, passing over Latrobe swing-bridge close to the
junction of the Thompson and Glengarry rivers. Crossing the bridge
and following the Glengarry for about 1 mile, Hilltop is reached ; and
from this eminence a comprehensive view is obtained of Sale and of the
nearer lakes. At this point several roads diverge, one to Dutson, and
another to the Prospect Reserve, a favorite camping ground on the shores
of the Southern Ocean, popular with the residents of Sale and the sur-
rounding districts.
There is excellent sea fishing here ; and in Merriman’s Creek, almost
surrounding the reserve, is an abundance of bream and mullet. The
streams at and around Sale also afford good sport to lovers of the rod,
whilst wild fowl, quail, and snipe are sufficiently plentiful in season to
enable good bags to be made.


BAIRNSDALE.
(. Population , 4,000.)
Bairnsdale is 171 miles from Melbourne, and occupies a fine position
on the Mitchell River, a wide stream flowing on three sides of the town.
The streets are broad and laid out at regular intervals. There is a
plentiful water supply, and 8 miles of gas mains have been put down. The
usual buildings are centrally located, and the main street is almost
entirely devoted to business premises, which include many stores con-
taining well selected stocks. The tastefully arranged Mitchell Gardens,
with a tennis court within the enclosure, lie on the river bank. The
Bairnsdale Tourist Association does much to make the sojourn of visitors
to their town pleasant, notably by arranging annually a series of eight
days’ personally conducted tours, all expenses including hotel and side-
trip charges being covered by one payment. In this way tourists are
conveyed comfortably and at a considerable reduction in cost to the
various points of interest in the locality. Such tours will be arranged
at any time for a party numbering not less than six members, on appli-
cation to Mr. W. R. Yeates, Secretary of the Bairnsdale Tourist Associa-
tion, or to the Government Tourist Officer.
Trips are made by land and water in various directions, amongst
others to Picinc Point (view of town and Mitchell Valley), over Wy Yung
bridge, returning on the other side of the river, vid Lucknow and the
new bridge.
A Day’s Outing- to Paynesville,
includes a lovely riverside drive to Eagle Point Park, where a
magnificent view of the lakes is obtained, thence through varied and
interesting scenery to Paynesville (11 miles). Yachting, fishing, and
shooting. A launch can be arranged for to the Back Beach, a lovely
afternoon’s trip to a beautiful spot on the Ninety Mile Beach.
To View the Maize Flats.
A day’s driving trip to Lindenow (11 miles), affords an opportunity
of seeing the famous Lindenow flats and the valley of the Mitchell.
A Drive to the Tambo.
An enjoyable day trip is that to Johnsonville and Swan Reach
(14miles); most magnificent river scenery, crossing the Nicholson to
the picturesque Tambo.
Steamer €xcursions.
MOSSIFACE AND THE LOVELY TAMBO.
Trip to Mossiface by steamer Tanjil on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, returning same day. Meals served on board. Return fare, 3s. 6d.
METUNG.
One of the most delightful retreats on the lakes. Good hotel accom-
modation ; splendid fishing, including bream, flathead, whiting and
schnapper. Good boating and yachting.


LAKES’ ENTRANCE (Cunninghame).
The s.s. J.C.D. or Gippsland leaves Bairnsdale daily at 4 p.m. for
Cunninghame, returning thence at 9 a.m. next day. On Sundays,
during the summer months, a steamer leaves Bairnsdale at 10 a.m. for
the Entrance, reaching the wharf on return at 6 p.m. Tourists will find
good hotels and boarding-houses there.
PAYNESVILLE (on McMillan’s Strait).
(. Population , 450.)
Paynesville is practically the pivot of the lakes, as reference to the
map on the reverse side will show. Raymond Island lies about a stone’s
throw across the water and is partly occupied by settlers following
agricultural pursuits and engaged in the fishing industry.
This is, perhaps, the largest motor boat depot on the lakes, and is,
consequently, a convenient head-quarters from which to explore this
delightful region of lake and river.
Newlands’ Backwater, within rowing boat distance of Paynesville,
is probably the prettiest inlet on the lakes, and the Tambo River can be
reached by motor boat in a short run. At Ocean Grange, from the
Lookout Tower, a fine view of the lakes, ocean, and neighbouring country
is obtained. To this point it is but a short motor boat run, and it can be
made the objective of a pleasant day or half-day trip and an extension
of the outing to the Back Lakes may also be included. The Nicholson
River, Bairnsdale, via the Mitchell River, and Metung are all within
reasonable distance.
There are a post and telegraph office, a hotel, a coffee palace and a
couple of stores at Paynesville.
KALIMNA.
Kalinina overlooks the Lakes Entrance, and is a couple of miles from
Cunninghame. Settlement here is almost entirely represented by the
Kalinina Hotel, a fine edifice built upon the cliffs above the Reeves River,
Near by, from the clearings in the timber, the outlook over the lakes,
inlets, sand dunes, and ocean is most charming.
CUNNINGHAME.
(.Population of District , 1,000.)
At Lakes’ Entrance, built upon a narrow neck of land between the
Reeves River and a sheet of water known as the North Arm.
The township is protected from the severity of the south wind
blowing up from the ocean by a barrier of sand hummocks a couple of
hundred yards across the river. About a similar distance away the
breakers roll in upon the Ninety Mile Beach, billow upon billow succeeding
each other rapidly, and the roar is so continuous that imagination
takes one to a mining town with the stampers in full running.


The variety in the scenery looking towards North Arm and again
westerly along the course of the Reeves is most marked, timbered slopes
and tiny islets contrasting strongly with the sandy ridges immediately
to the south.
Cunninghame is an important fishing dep3t and distributing centre,
as the vessels trading from Melbourne call frequently to discharge and
receive cargo on behalf of the settlers, many of whom reside far inland.
To provide for this trade the entrance was cut from the ocean to the lakes,
and heavy annual expenditure is necessary to maintain the training
walls and piers.
A pilot and signalling station forms part of the settlement, which
includes a post and telegraph office and two or three stores. Accommoda-
tion is provided by several hotels and many comfortable boarding-
houses. Bathing, sailing or motor-launching and fishing form the
principal amusements of visitors.
Cunninghame is, further, the starting point of the Orbost coach, and
the stop-over place for the Buchan trip via the Lakes. Motor, sailing,
and rowing boats are on hire at reasonable rates.
LAKE TYERS.
During the summer months a vehicle leaves Cunninghame at 9 a.m.
daily for Lake Tyers, the distance between the points being 5 miles.
Approaching Lake Tyers itself, after an enjoyable drive of slightly
over an hour, a beautiful vista is revealed. Sloping hills, here wooded
to the water’s edge, and there showing clear patches of a brighter green,
are mirrored in the pellucid waters of the lake.
A trip up either the Nowa Nowa or Toorloo Arms, extending north-
wards for 15 and 8 miles respectively, forms a truly delightful excursion,
a series of most entrancing pictures unfolding their charms at each turn
of the winding course. Excellent fishing and shooting are obtainable.
The Lake Tyers Aboriginal Mission Station will no doubt interest visitors.
It comprises a church, a State school, superintendent’s residence, and
cottages occupied by natives, of whom there are about 60 domiciled
under the kindly care of Captain Howe. The station is situated on a
bold headland on the northern bank of the lake, and is reached by rowing
boats on hire locally; distance, 1 mile. A mile beyond the station
is Lake Tyers House, where accommodation is provided for visitors.
A steam launch is available on the lake, and is at the disposal of visitors
on payment of the usual fee. Picnic and sporting parties are organized
and most enjoyable outings made in this way.
BUCHAN.
Buchan can be reached either via Bairnsdale and Bruthen by coach
or, as described in the Lakes route, via Sale and Bairnsdale. Con-
tinuing on by road from Cunninghame at 9 a.m. to Lake Tyers Landing,
and thence by motor boat to Nowa Nowa and coach the balance of the
distance, Buchan is reached at 4 p.m.
