NAR R A TIV E,
We left Sydney, March 21st, in a large open
boat, of twenty-nine feet six inches extreme length
over all, and ten feet beam, belonging to William
Farrel and Richard Parsons, for the Five Islands,
to take in cedar. The crew consisted of Richard
Parsons, John Finnegan, John Thompson, and
myself. We had a considerable quantity of pro-
vision, flour, pork, &c. for the purpose of buying
cedar, and four gallons of water and five of rum.
About four o?clock the same evening, when within
seven or eight miles of our destination, a violent
gale came on from the west, which forced us to
lower all sail, and keep the boat before the sea.
The night came on with heavy rain and increasing
wind, but we did not lose sight of land till shut
out by darkness. The gale continued with un-

but the sea continued to run so very high, that
we were still obliged to keep the boat before it,
without being able to carry any sail till the eleventh
day, viz. 2d April, when the sea being much fallen
we made sail, supposing that the current had
drifted us to the southward, and that we were
then off Van Diemen?s Land. We had no com-
pass, but we steered by the sun, as near as we
could guess, a N.W. course, expecting very soon to
make the land in the neighbourhood of the Five
Islands, our original destination. Our small stock
of water was totally expended on the second day,
and the rain we caught in the commencement of
the gale was so spoiled by salt water, that we were
forced to throw it away. Our sufferings were
dreadful for the following thirteen days, having
nothing to drink but rum. We were almost unable
to speak, and could with difficulty understand each
other. John Thompson, a Scotchman, the best
hand in the boat (having been an old man of war?s
man), had become quite delirious from drinking
salt water, and was totally useless to us. On the
fifteenth day (6th April), a heavy shower of rain
fell, and our sails being lowered and spread, we

caught about a bucket and a half; but from the
sails having been so much drenched with salt-
water, it was almost useless to us. On the
eighteenth day (9th April), a light mizzling rain
fell, when we caught a bucket-full, which was
much better. Thompson recovered a little on
getting some of it, but still continued severely
purged and otherwise affected by the salt water he
had drank. We still continued steering the same
course, N.W. as we imagined, till the nineteenth
day (10th April), when about eleven o?clock A.M.
John Finnegan having gone up to the mast-head,
said that he saw land right a-head, which he de-
clared to be the headland of Port Stephen, he
having formerly worked there ; but not being able
to credit him, I went up to the mast-head myself,
and, after looking earnestly for some time, was
unable to determine whether it was land or a cloud:
however, we determined to steer for it; but towards
evening we lost sight of it entirely. Thompson
was at this time very bad, and Finnegan had be-
come quite deaf; while Parsons and myself, though
not so bad, were hardly able to speak or move: a
dreadful lassitude came over us, and it was with

much difficulty we could keep our watch of two
hours each. We continued in this state till the
twenty-first day (12th April), when at daylight, it
being my watch, I distinctly saw land a-head,
which, as the morning advanced, appeared to be
three or four islands. We made all sail for them.
Thompson, on hearing this joyful news, apparently
revived a little; we had been obliged to bind him
hand and foot, three or four days before, to prevent
his jumping overboard, being completely deranged:
his feet were now untied, when he immediately
came aft to me, imagining we had already been on
shore, and entreated for God?s sake I would give
him fresh water. When he found I was not able
to comply with his request, he became worse;
raving in the most incoherent manner, saying he
had just dined with his family in Scotland, &c.:
he then lay down near the well, and in the course
\
of an hour expired. We now stood on for the
land till about ten o?clock, P.M. when, expecting to
get on shore at daylight next morning, we hove
the boat to, being then, according to our judgment,
about an hour?s run from the shore. We saw
plainly the natives round their fires, and intended

to keep clear of them, if possible, the next day.
About midnight the boat struck on a reef of rocks,
but being light, the heave of the sea carried her
over it without damage; and when daylight broke,
we found we had drifted so far to sea that the
land was barely visible: however, we had a fine
fresh favourable breeze and smooth water, and
again steered for the same land, and by sunset
were within two or three miles of shore, but a little
to the north of the place where we hove to the night
before. We were, however, fearful of venturing
on shore on account of the natives, whom we again
distinctly saw; we therefore kept on through the
night, steering north. In the morning the wind
was light and the water smooth, and we were close
in with the shore. I now saw plainly a run of
fresh water trickling through the beach, and pro-
posed to take the boat?s running rigging and make
�
it fast to the keg, and swim ashore with it, by
which means they could haul the fresh water on
board; but this was objected to by Parsons, who
being half owner of the boat, was afraid of her
being lost: we therefore continued our course all
day, and towards evening Parsons declared he was

half a quarter of a mile from the shore, and payed
out about forty fathoms of cable to let her drift
further in. I then stripped, and having made the
running rigging fast to the keg, jumped over and
attempted to swim for the shore; but I was so
weak and exhausted, that, what with the little
surf, and what with the keg, I was in the water
near an hour and a half before I could succeed
#
in landing; but no sooner did my foot touch the
ground than I ran to the fresh water, and lying
down by it, I drank like a horse. I then returned
to the beach for the keg, which I again left and
ran back for another drink. This happened three
or four times; and when I attempted to fill the
keg, I was quite unable to do it, from weakness
*
and the quantity of water I had swallowed. In
the meantime it began to blow very fresh from the
eastward, and my companions called loudly to me
to come on board to assist in hauling the boat off;
but the surf ran so high, and my weakness was
such, that I did not dare to venture again into
the water: I therefore called to them, as the breeze
freshened, to cut the cable and let her run ashore.
This, after some time, they did; and with the

help of a little swimming, both got safe on shore.
The boat grounded on the sandy beach, and in
less than five minutes her bottom was stove in.

The eagerness of my companions for fresh water
even exceeded mine. I had brought on shore a
pint tin pot to fill the keg: Parsons emptied this
|
thirteen times in succession; while Finnegan lay
down in the water, and drank to such excess that
r%??S
his stomach could not retain it, but threw it all up
again. This he repeated four several times. We

had all of us stripped off our clothes for the pur-

pose of swimming on shore, and the surf now ran
1 I
so high, that it was impossible to approach the
boat for the purpose of getting them; so that we
were all perfectly naked, with the exception of an
old rug jacket that Finnegan picked up next
morning. The beach on which the boat struck

much throughout the night from cold and hunger;
and next morning, when day broke, we found the
boat had gone to pieces, and that some few of the
things in her had drifted ashore. We then went
%
down to the beach, and found three bags of flour,
O
two of which were totally spoiled; but the salt-
water had not penetrated above two inches into
the third. We therefore emptied those which
were spoiled, and each took from twenty to thirty
pounds of good flour, being as much as we thought
0
we were able to carry. We still imagined we were
i
far to the southward of Port Jackson. Four or
%
five days before we w T ere wrecked, we saw many
flying-fish and dolphins, and caught one or two of
the former; but it never struck us on that account
that we were to the northward of Port Jackson.
Accordingly, after making a wretched meal of
flour and water, which we mixed in a bucket that
had drifted ashore, we set out along the beach in
a northerly direction, and continued to walk, as
expeditiously as our weakness would allow, till near
dark. We then observed a native path striking
into the bush, which apparently cut off a bluff head
before us: this we determined to follow, and in a

NARRATIVE OF
short time we saw before us a black woman and
child, carrying water in a bark vessel. Fearing
that if we were seen, this woman would alarm her
tribe, we concealed ourselves till they had passed,
�
and then continued our journey. There were
several large huts near where we saw the woman;
but the men were probably employed in fishing, as
we did not see any. After proceeding about a
mile, we reached the beach on the other side of
the head; and on leaving the bush saw a large
hut, near which was a boy amusing himself by
throwing a spear at some crows. There were a
great number of native dogs round the hut, but
they did not appear to notice us. After a short
time the boy turning round saw us, and instantly
ran into the hut, from which a man now made his
? /
appearance. He hastily snatched a spear from the
side of the hut, and then took hold of the child
with the intention of running into the bush; but
a very large woman ran out, and throwing the
child on her back, instantly disappeared. I now

called to the man to stop, when, to our astonishment,

he answered in good English, ? What do you want ?

woman. This circumstance convinced us that we
were in the neighbourhood of some English settle-
ment, and gave us great spirits, as we had now
hopes of shortly reaching some place where our
wants would be relieved. It will be afterwards
seen that we were wrong, and we could never

account for this Moreton islander?s being able to
speak English, while the natives of Moreton Bay
appeared never to have seen a white man before*.
I then desired Finnegan to go into the hut and
fetch some fire, which he did; after which we pro-
ceeded, intending to stop at the first fresh water
we fell in with. This happened in the course of a
mile: it was a shallow pool about six inches deep.
Here we made a fire, and having mixed some flour
and water, made cakes of it, and set them down to
roast. While thus employed we saw some native
dogs, which appeared to have followed us from the
hut; and shortly afterwards I saw a man?s head
peeping over the bank behind us, and then two
or three more. We beckoned them to approach,

which, after some time, they did, when we offered
them some cake, which they pretended to eat, but
immediately spat it out again. Their number now
amounted to about twelve; and they began to feel
us about the breast and shoulders in a manner
that greatly alarmed us: we therefore prepared to
move again, as soon as we had finished our meal.
They now became very urgent that we should
return with them to the huts we had first seen;
but we persisted in proceeding to the northward.
They had nets on their backs, with which they
made signs that they would catch fish for us; but
#
when they found we were obstinate, some of them
prepared to accompany us, and one or two of them
took up our bags of flour to carry for us. We
proceeded about a mile with them, when we came
to another set of huts, into which our conductors
invited us; and on our consenting, they appeared
quite happy, dancing and singing around us. They
then made a fire, near which I lay down to sleep
with my bag under my head, while one of the
natives remained, as if to take care of me, and
keep up the fire. My companions went into one
of the large huts, where every sort of attention


101

was shown them, and passed the night there.
In the morning, after having breakfasted on
some of our cakes, we again set out, accompanied
by our kind friendly natives, who brought us
down to the beach, and again seemed very anxious
that we should return the way we came, but they
did not offer to use any kind of force. We, how-
ever, determined to proceed to the northward, sup-
posing that that course would ultimately lead us
to Port Jackson; and when they found we would
not return, some of them, as before, accompanied
t
us on our way. After proceeding about three
miles, they led us into the bush, where we found
more huts. Here again they wished us to remain;
but after sitting with them about an hour, we pro-
ceeded much against their wish, accompanied by
one of their number. We walked along the beach,
and passed several more huts, but the inhabitants
V
did not appear to take any notice of us. At the
last of these huts our guide left us, pointing out
another station at some distance, and making signs
that, by proceeding, we should fall in with a canoe.
He also took us to a rising ground, where he indi-
cated a point of land at some distance, which (as

the place where we were appeared to be an island)
we imagined to be the main land. We then pro-
ceeded till about three or four o?clock in the after-
noon, when we found near the beach four or five
large huts, apparently deserted; and there being a
good run of water near them, we resolved to pass
the night there. The next day, finding that the
natives did not appear, we determined to remain
�
till the following morning, in order to refresh our-
selves a little. We then again proceeded on our
journey, and continued travelling along the beach
for the following five days, without meeting any
/ : *TI J
natives, or any thing worth notice. Our feet
being sore, we were not able to walk far at a time,
and we helned out our flour from time to time
with cockles and other shell-fish, which we met
with in our way. On the fifth day we arrived at
a high sandy point, where we found our further
progress stopped by a channel about three miles
wide, through which the tide appeared to run very
rapidly. We were now certain that we had been
thrown on an island, and our thoughts were there-
i
fore directed towards the means of reaching the main
land. At the back of the sand-hill, we found a small

well of fresh water, which had been dug by the
natives; near this we made a fire and passed the
night. We observed fires on the opposite shore,
and early the next morning we kindled a large one
down on the beach, which being seen by the natives,
one of them passed over in a large canoe. As he
approached, however, we retired behind the hill;
and when he had hauled up his canoe, he made
directly for the fire. We then made our appear-
ance, but no sooner did he observe our colour than
he ran back to his boat, and jumping in, pushed
rapidly off, shouting and roaring with all his might.
In the meantime, another canoe was launched from
the opposite side with two men, who met the first
about half across the channel, and they then both
paddled towards the place where we were sitting.
When they had landed, we were unwilling to ap-
proach them, lest they should again be frightened,
and therefore remained sitting quietly by our fire.
The three men then approached cautiously to-
wards us, and, having examined us at a distance,
returned to their boats, and made signals with
some pieces of bark to those on the opposite shore,
when two more canoes pushed off, with five or six

men in each; and, as soon as these had landed, the
whole party, to the number of fourteen, approached
us. They were perfectly naked, and had neither
spears nor any other kind of weapon with them.
They still appeared shy of coming near us, but at last
one man came close to the fire, and on our making
signs, two or three more followed his example, and
in a short time the whole party had formed a circle
round us. Parsons happened to have a pair of
scissors, which had belonged to Thompson, and
their beards being very long, he commenced cutting
them, which appeared to delight them greatly.
They remained an hour with us; and on rising to
go away, we got our bags on our backs, and pre-
pared to accompany them. This however they
did not seem inclined to permit, but ran down
quickly to their boats. We then endeavoured to
secure one of their canoes, but they were too quick
for us, and jumping in, pushed them rapidly away.
We now began to despair of being able to quit the
island, and returned very unhappy to some deserted
huts, which we had seen about three miles before
we arrived at the point. Here we passed the night,
and next morning returned to the point, in hopes


105

of being still able to persuade the natives to take
us across the channel. On approaching it, our joy
was excessive at seeing the large canoe, that had
appeared first on the preceding day, lying on the
beach without any person near it. On looking
- ? <r i ?
round, how r ever, we saw two natives, who were ap-
parently proceeding towards the place where our
*
boat had been lost, for we now found we had
?
walked nearly round the island. They did not
*
appear to notice us, but kept on their way, upon
which we proceeded with all speed to secure the
canoe. On examination, we feared that it would
. # **' ?. m
not carry us all three with our bags, &c.; so,
T
having consulted awhile, I agreed to remain
behind, and let Parsons and Finnegan cross over,
t
i
when it was stipulated that one of them should
return and fetch me. They accordingly pushed
off, and I retreated to the top of the hill, from
*
whence I was able to see them the whole way
across. On the canoe?s approaching the shore, I
could perceive a great number of natives walking
out in the water to meet them, which made me
very apprehensive that they were about to destroy
them ; and when they had landed, the whole crowd

got round them and moved in towards the bush,
which at last hid them from my sight. I re-
mained looking out till evening, expecting to see
the canoe every minute, but in vain. I therefore
returned to the little well, where we had passed
the first night, and having kindled a fire, spent a
very wretched night, being greatly alarmed lest
my companions should have met with some mis-
fortune. In the morning, I returned to the beach
and made a large fire, in hopes that, on seeing it,
the canoe would return for me. However, I was
again disappointed, nor was I able to perceive a
single native on the shore the whole day. I now
*
began to lament my hard fate, in being left alone
in this desolate place, where, after the little flour
I had was expended, I must expect to perish either
by hunger or the hostility of the natives; and I
/
returned to the well, fully convinced that I should
never again see either of my unfortunate com-
panions. The next morning, in walking along
the shore, near the point, I saw a large cask, which
had drifted ashore from some vessel. Conceiving
it might contain some provisions or spirits, I set
to work to get some of the hoops off; but when I

had succeeded, I found, to my disappointment, that
it contained only six
\
other. They appeared quite fresh, and had not
been long in the water: they seemed to be in-
tended to hold oil. While thus employed, I gave
many an anxious look to the opposite shore. I was
proceeding up the hill again, when I saw the canoe
put off with two persons in it, whom, on its nearer
approach, I ascertained to be Finnegan and one of
the natives. On reaching the beach, the native
took his nets on his shoulder, and marched off in
the same direction as the two who had before left
the canoe; but before he went, he made signs for
me to go back with Finnegan. Finnegan now
told me that nothing could exceed the kindness
with which they had been treated by the natives,
who had lodged them in a large hut by themselves,
and given them as much fish as they could eat, but
that they could not before persuade the natives to
let the canoe come over for me; and it was only
by accident he was now enabled to come with the
native I had seen, who was going to visit his friends
on the island. The tide was now running out of
the channel with great rapidity, and I wished Fin-

I was obliged to comply, and we pushed off; but

no sooner had we left the shore than, in spite of
all our efforts, the current took us out to sea. We
still continued paddling for about an hour and a
half, by which time we had drifted out close to the
breakers, which were very heavy all round us;
and, as we had no hope of the canoe?s living if she
once got among them, we redoubled our efforts,
but to no purpose: we were soon in the midst of
them; but, contrary to our expectations, the little
canoe rode it out much better than a larger boat
would have done. We soon got clear of them,
and were now in the open sea beyond them. The
tide still continued very strong, and we did not
relax our efforts to gain the opposite shore, where
we saw the natives, and Parsons in the midst of
them, running along and watching our progress.
\
At last, after about five hours? hard paddling, the
tide turned, and we reached the shore in safety,
eight miles from the place where we had originally

of natives waiting on the beach, and were received
by them with many demonstrations of joy. They
lifted the canoe into the bush, and presented us
with several roasted fish, and then conducted us
to their huts. They placed us in a very large
well-built hut by ourselves, and supplied us with
fish, water, &c. very liberally. Here we remained
for a week or ten days, during which time we
were most hospitably treated by the natives. They
would not, however, suffer us to approach the huts
in which their women were, for the first five or six
days; and at night five or six of the younger men
would sleep in front of our hut. But they after-
wards became less vigilant, and we used to pass
through their huts among the women as we pleased.
Having now recovered our strength in some degree,
and being much refreshed, after consulting toge-
ther, Parsons and I resolved to continue our en-
deavours to reach Sydney; but we had some diffi-
culty in persuading Finnegan to accompany us.
He said that the blacks were so friendly that he
wished to remain with them, sooner than encounter
the difficulty and danger of attempting to return
to any of our settlements. At length, however,

he consented to go; and accordingly, early in the
4
morning, about the tenth day, we set out in a
westerly direction, in order to get round the large
bay, of which the island that we had originally
been thrown upon forms the eastern boundary.
We had saved as much of our flour as possible, so
that our stock still amounted to about forty pounds,
the greater part of which Parsons carried. Fin-
negan carried the rest, and a stick of fire; while I
bore an axe and a tin pot, which we had saved from
the wreck. The natives had pointed out an inlet
to us at the distance of twelve or fourteen miles,
where, they informed us by signs, we should find
a canoe, in which they directed us to cross to an
island, that was just visible, towards the bottom of
the bay. After we had proceeded about ten miles,
the fire went out, at which Parsons, who was a
very violent, passionate man, declared he would
kill Finnegan, and struck him a severe blow with
the handle of the axe, and would in all probability
have murdered him had I not interfered. Finnegan
now begged for mercy, and said he would make all
haste back to a place where we had passed a native
fire, about three or four miles back. Accordingly

he departed; but after waiting at least five hours,
on his not making his appearance, we resolved to
return ourselves. We left our flour, &c. in the
bush, and retraced our steps to the fire. It was
4k
nearly extinguished, but after some difficulty, I
# 4
succeeded in making it burn. Here we stopped an
hour, in hopes that Finnegan would appear ; but,
on the approach of evening, we thought it best to
return to the place where we had left our provi-
sions. We therefore set forward, each carrying a
stick of fire this time, lest one should fail us.
However, just as we had reached the place, to our
mortification and sorrow, both sticks became ex-
tinguished, so that, our flour being the only food we
had, and having no fire to dress it, we determined
to take two or three pounds of it with us, and go
hack once more to the fire, which we had taken
the precaution of making up, before we left it.
The night was far advanced when we reached it a
second time, and having made a cake of our flour
* ' , *
and eaten it, we lay down for the night. In the
morning we baked the remainder of our flour;
and, after remaining two or three hours, in ex-
pectation that Finnegan would still come, we again

walked on to the place where we had left our pro-
visions, each this time carrying two large sticks of
fire. We justly concluded that Finnegan had re-
turned to the natives, whom we had left the day
before, and therefore took no further concern about
him, but pushed on with what expedition we could
towards the place where the natives had given us
to understand we should find the canoe. About
four o?clock, P. M., we arrived at some huts in the
immediate vicinity of the place they had pointed
out, bu� were too much fatigued to look for the
canoe that night; and having found water in a
swamp hard by, and lighted a fire, we made a cake
for supper, and slept in the huts. From this time
forwards, we always took the precaution of lighting
a fire at every two or three miles as we travelled,
that we might not again experience the same
inconvenience. Next morning, we proceeded to
search for the canoe, and found it exactly in the
place where the natives had given us to under-
stand we should. We then took it down to the
water, in order to ascertain if it would carry us
both; but it had been so long exposed to the heat
of the sun, that it opened in several places, and

would not float with one of us. This was a dread-
ful disappointment, as the beaches began to be
covered with mangrove trees so thickly, as to pre-
vent our proceeding along them, and, having no
shoes, we were unable to walk through the bush.
\
Therefore, after having consulted a short time, we
determined on going back to the blacks, especially
as we expected to find Finnegan there. We ac-
\ .
cordringly took our flour, &c. and immediately set
out on our return. By night-fall we had arrived
within three or four miles of their huts; here we
found a fire and fresh water, and remained all
night. Next morning, the tide being high, the
mangroves prevented us from walking on the
beach. We were therefore obliged to remain till
towards low water, when, just as we were about
to start, we saw Finnegan, accompanied by two
natives, approaching us. It appeared that these
men had left their nets at the huts where we
found the canoe, and were fearful lest we should
take them. They were bringing Finnegan with
them, that we might not hurt them; but as soon
as they saw us, they made signs to him to return
with us. This however we would not allow, as

we were very much enraged at his leaving us, in
w *
the way he did, without fire, and were resolved to
have nothing more to do with him. We therefore
made him proceed with the natives to the canoe-
huts, while we went on in the other direction,
towards the huts where we had lived with the
natives. About half a mile before we reached
. ? ? . ?
them, we saw the natives fishing: they had been
very successful; and on seeing us they immedi-
ately put a quantity of whitings on the fire, nor
would they allow us to proceed till we had filled
v . . i
ourselves with them. They then conducted us to
our old quarters, and having kindled a fire, they left
us some fish, and went out again to catch more.
We now set about making ourselves as comfortable
as we could, when just at night-fall we were sur-
prised by the return of Finnegan and the two
blacks with their nets. They had travelled the
distance in one day, which it took us three days
to perform, and had forced him to keep up with
them. He was dreadfully fatigued; but his two
companions, after leaving him, went out and pro-
cured fish and fern-root for him and themselves.
We now became reconciled to him, and were all as

friendly as ever, resting ourselves for the next three
days in the hut, where the blacks regularly brought
us fish and fern-root, which latter they called din-
gown. We now consulted whether we had better
take one of their canoes by night, or endeavour to
make one ourselves; and having decided upon the
latter, we made choice of a tree, and immediately
fell to work to cut it down and form a canoe. We
worked from sunrise to sunset for nearly three
weeks, having no other tool but the hatchet; and
during the whole time the natives brought us food,
' r
where we were at work, and likewise left fish in our
hut daily. During the whole of this time, Fin-
negan refused to work with us, which the blacks
observing, frequently took the axe out of our hands
and offered it to him, making signs that he should
use it, and, on his continuing to refuse, they no
longer brought him food, though to us they con-
tinued a liberal supply. He was consequently
obliged to procure fern-root, &c. for himself. At
the expiration of three weeks, our canoe being com-
plete, the natives would not allow us to launch it,
but did it themselves; and when they saw it afloat,
with Parsons and me in it, their joy and admiration

the blacks had advised us to steer, and about eleven
o?clock at night we reached it. We immediately
secured the canoe, and made a good fire, which was
scarcely done when it began to rain, and continued
i ' _
to pour incessantly during the night. The next
morning, the rain having cleared off, we proceeded
to the opposite side of the island with the canoe,
where we procured some fern-root, with which we
pushed off for the other side of the bay. The tide
being strong, we did not reach the shore till after
dark, when we found six or seven huts and some
fire. We could hear the natives, who appeared to
have just left this place, making much noise, a little
to the southward, where they were fishing, but
/?. ? - .
they did not come near us that night. The next
morning we went up to a rising ground at the
back of the huts, from which we could command a
good view of the country. From this place we
saw another point far to the northward, but the
distance appeared so great, and the shore appeared
to recede so far, that we were afraid to venture
across in our canoe; we therefore returned to the
huts, and having drawn up our canoe on the beach,
we set out to walk round the bay. The mangroves

were so thick that we could not long keep the
shore, but followed a native path which seemed to
/

lead in the direction we wished to proceed in. On
the third day we arrived on the bank of a large
river, at a place where it was evident the natives
use to cross over; but it was too wide for us to
attempt to swim, and we could not find a canoe;
we therefore resolved to go up the river until we
should find some means of crossing it. Accordingly
we travelled on for nearly a month, being very
much impeded by the number of salt creeks, which

we were obliged to walk round, as neither of my

companions were able to swim sufficiently well to
attempt crossing them. At last we reached the
bank of a creek, on the opposite side of which we
saw two canoes; one of these I was resolved to
procure. I accordingly swam across, but I found
myself so weak (as we had now lived for a month
on fern-root), that it was with great difficulty I
reached the other side. I loosed the canoe, and
/
brought it back to my companions. It was, how-
ever, so small that it would not carry more than
two of us at a time. I therefore took Parsons over
the main river first, and then returned for Fin-

negan; but we found the brush so thick, and the
country so rough, that it was impossible for us,
naked and shoeless as we were, to travel it. I was
therefore obliged to take them back in the same
manner, to the place we had left. We then com-
menced our return the way we had come; but we
had not in returning any thing like the difficulty
which we experienced in coming up, since, when-
ever we came to a river or creek, instead of tra-
veiling seven or eight days in order to get round
it, we were enabled to cross it in the canoe. We
*
thus continued for two or three days, Parsons and
Finnegan walking, and I paddling down in the
canoe, till on the opposite side of the river we
found another canoe; and being all now able to
float down the river, we agreed to rest where we
were a few days, in order to lay in a stock of fern-
root. While thus employed, we fell in with a
party of blacks, who were going to fish with their
nets, and on our asking them they gave us a good
{ e
meal of fish: but the next day they seemed anxious
that we should leave them; and upon our not
doing so, as readily as they wished, they made an
attempt to seize our canoes. We were fortunate

enough, however, to get them out of their reach,
and proceeded on our journey. In two days after-
wards we reached the mouth of the river, where,
on a sand-bank at the entrance, I was so lucky as
to kill five large sting-rays, which afforded us some
good meals. The river, as high up as we reached,
was brackish, and a very strong tide ran in it: it
was above a quarter of a mile wide where we turned
back. We now left the smaller canoe, and my
companions walked along the beach, while I, in the
other canoe, pulled along the shore. In this manner
we continued our course to the northward for three
days, and on the evening of the third day reached
the point which had been originally pointed out
to us by the blacks on the island, where our boat
\
was lost. This was the 101 st day after we left
* ?
Sydney, Parsons and I having kept a strict account
thus far; but from this time forward we totally
lost our reckoning. I had brought Parsons across the
last bay in the canoe, and had promised to go back
immediately for Finnegan; but he, having walked
r .v . . ? ,
a little distance further along the shore, found a
canoe, in which were twenty or thirty large fish.
This he immediately seized, and we had scarcely

landed, when we perceived him paddling towards
\
us. On his approach, he called out to us to make
a good fire, as he had plenty of fish; upon which
we ran down to the shore, and as soon as he landed,
having hauled up the canoe, we carried the fish to
some empty huts which we found hard by. In
the mean time, the natives who owned the canoe
s ?
began to call out, and at length followed Finnegan
across in another canoe to the number of about
ten. By this time several of the natives of the
side on which we were, being alarmed by the noise,
had joined them, and they all proceeded towards
? \
/
the huts. We had now for several weeks lived
almost entirely on dingowa, which being but a
poor kind of food, together with the fatigue of
\
travelling so far under a burning sun without
clothes, had weakened and emaciated us very
much, and we resolved to run every risk sooner
than lose the fish we had thus obtained: we
\
therefore placed them under some bark, and I took
my axe and Finnegan a stick, being determined
not to lose them without a struggle. However,
when the natives approached, they seemed at once
struck with our miserable condition; and instead

of attempting to repossess themselves of the fish,
some who had their nets with them instantly set
to work to procure more for us; and one or two
i
fetched us as much ding gw a as they could carry.
The next night they took us to their huts, where
they entertained us in the same hospitable manner
as the blacks, with whom we had before lived, had
done.

John Finnegan, Pamphlet being

We had resided with these blacks about four or
*
five days, when Pamphlet, having gone out fishing
with them one day, came back and said it was useless
to remain there any longer, as he had seen the head
/
of Jervis?s Bay at a distance of about fifteen miles,
and, therefore, proposed to go to it the next day.
To this Parsons agreed; but as 1 had every reason
to fear violence from Parsons, who had once or
twice attempted to kill me, I resolved to remain
where I was for the present, till I had fairly gotten
rid of him, and then to attempt to travel by myself.
They accordingly set out the next morning, and I
remained behind, with the chief of the tribe, who

had been very kind to me ever since onr arrival
here. However, the next evening Parsons and
Pamphlet, being unable to procure food, returned
to the huts. Here we all remained for about a
month; during which time we were distributed in
?' � r
different huts among the natives, the old chief
always keeping me with him, while every one of
the tribe contributed to our support, one bringing
fish, another dingowa, and so on; so that we were
as comfortable as we could expect to be in our
situation. At the end of a month we again grew
anxious to get home, if possible, and accordingly
resolved to make one more effort. Having collected

a great quantity of fish and , we set out
one afternoon, and pursued our course northward
along the beach for about ten miles: here we in-

tended to pass the night; but just as we had made

been living, came up with us, and used every

some other things, which we had not given them;

would arrive before morning; we therefore drove
them away, and proceeded about a mile further,
and there rested for the night. We resumed our
journey very early next morning, and in the course
of the day were overtaken by a black man and
woman belonging to the tribe we had left. These
people also tried to prevail on us to return, but
i
without success; and after accompanying us about
a mile, they struck into the bush and left us.
*
Towards evening we came to a river, which ap-
peared too considerable for us to attempt to cross;
we therefore rested on the bank that night, and
next morning went up it about a mile. Here we
found a canoe, and brought it down to the place
where we had slept, and in the afternoon at low-
water we crossed the river in it, and rested on the
other bank that night. The next morning we
proceeded on our journey, and in the course of the
v \
day fell in with another smaller river, on the bank
of which were a number of huts. Here we found an
old black man, who was unable to move, both his
legs and arms having been broken at some di-
stant period, and never having been set. There
were also three women, with some children, all

eating fish, with which, on our arrival, they in-
stantly supplied us. Here we stopped for three
days, when, having observed a woman crossing the
river at low-water by walking, we did the same,
and again proceeded on our journey. The same
day we fell in with another river, up the bank of
which we walked two days, and on the second
evening met some natives, among whom we were
surprised to see a man belonging to the tribe with
whom we had tarried so long: he was one of the
four who had followed us the day we left them.
t
This man, when we first arrived among his tribe,
was laid up with a spear-wound in the knee, and
was cured by Pamphlet, by extracting part of the
spear that had broken in the wound. He had in
consequence become much attached to Pamphlet,
and now again urgently entreated him to return
with him. To this Pamphlet, whose feet had become
extremely sore, at last consented. His friend was
then on his way to a great meeting of natives,
where he was to fight the man who had wounded
him. Accordingly the next morning, Pamphlet
and he set out together for the fight, while Par-
sons and I pursued our journey. The next day

behind without further solicitation. I now daily
accompanied the men of the tribe on their fishing
�
�
excursions, and was always supplied by them in
the most liberal manner. They would not even
allow me to roast the fish, or pound the dingoxi'Ci ,
which they gave me, but always brought them
i
ready dressed. One day, however, the old man in
whose hut I lived having caught several large
fish, did not give me any, as was usual with him,
and on my asking for some, he refused me- rather
gruffly. Upon this, fancying they might be getting
\
tired of me, I resolved to leave them, and accord-
ingly, taking my axe, I set out at once, in order to
attempt, if possible, to rejoin Parsons. I had not,
however, gone far, when I was followed by four of
the young men, who made use of every persuasion
in their power to entice me back, to which I at
last consented, the more readily as each of them
brought two spears, and I was not quite certain
what use they would have put them to, had I
persisted in my refusal. After this I lived with
them in the same manner as before, expecting
Finnegan s return every day; but having now lost

NARRATIVE OF
our reckoning for some time, I cannot form any
idea how long I remained, or what time Finnegan
was away. At last, one evening, as I was sitting
by the fire and the blacks were roasting fish for
me, I heard some natives shouting on the beach
and calling me; upon which I rose and walked
slowly towards them; hut what was my astonish-
ment and delight, when I saw a cutter under full
sail standing up the bay, about three miles from
where we stood! I instantly made towards her
with all the speed I could, followed by a number
? .
of the natives; but before I had run half the di-
, t f s
stance, she came to an anchor within half a quarter
of a mile of the shore. On coming abreast the
vessel I hailed her, and was immediately answered;
and shortly afterwards a boat pushed off from her,
from which landed Mr. Oxley the Surveyor-General,
Lieutenant Stirling of the Buffs, and the recorder
of this narrative. I now learned, to my great sur-
prise, that I was at least five hundred miles to the
northward of Port Jackson, instead of being, as we
%
always imagined, to the southward of Jervis?s Bay.
I was taken on board the vessel that evening,
where, after I was cleaned, I was decently clothed

and humanely treated; but my head and heart
?
were so much affected by this unexpected turn of
* ) S'
fortune, that I was unable to answer any questions
that were put to me that night. The next morn-
ing, however, I became more collected; and in
/ ??
the course of the day my satisfaction was greatly
increased by the return of Finnegan, who ex-
perienced the same kind treatment that I had
V , \ "?
previously done. I now found that upwards of
eight months had elapsed since I left Sydney;
consequently, I had spent nearly five of them with
these hospitable natives of Moreton Bay. Their
behaviour to me and my companions had been so
/ ?
invariably kind and generous, that, notwithstand-
.', * . v
ing the delight I felt at the idea of once more
returning to my home, I did not leave them with-
i ? '
out sincere regret.
i
\
Mr. Oxley and Mr. Stirling set out the follow-
* \
ing morning, taking Finnegan with them, in order
to examine the river which we had been so long in
attempting to cross; and on their return, in five or
six days, the Mermaid cutter got under way, and
\ r
we all set sail for Sydney.
