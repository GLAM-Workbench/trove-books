A Brief History of Western Australia.
From its earliest settlement.
*T is the duty of the faithful chronicler to set out in due order and no over
varnished language the events which make up history. If he can
commence at the very beginning of the State so much the better, and this is
what I shall do, and shall lightly and briefly pass in review events which
marked the commencement of the colonisation of this portion of the Australian
continent, events often fraught with much romantic interest, even when
regarded through a long vista of years. In December of the year 1826 Eng
George’s Sound, the first settlement made in any part of the territory, was
formed into a dependency of New South Wales. A party of fifty-two persons
was sent there from Sydney under the command of Major Lookyer, the party
including both soldiers and convicts. They established themselves on a piece
of land which now borders on the Brunswick Hoad, and there they built a
gaol, or at any rate a place of safe housing for the prisoners and a barrack for
the soldiers. It is interesting in these days, when we have all come to regard
King George’s Sound as an important strategic point, to indulge in military
parlance, and when we have strongly fortified it, and are about to garrison it
with paid soldiers, to know that the military eye of Major Lookyer was at once
struck by the necessity of at once strengthening the position, and that he
caused a rude kind of fortification to be erected. This was mounted with two
cannons, but there is reason to think that these munitions of war would have
been of very little use had the emergency arisen for putting them to the test.
Truly they were very little more than toys, and were more for ornament than
use. The gaol and buildings, venerable historical relics of a “ system ” best
forgotten, have been long since pulled down, and only a cairn of stones marks
the place where the first settlers were housed. The old cannon, cast in 1816,
still remains, choked with dust and cankered with rust, and considering the
historical interest that attaches to them they should find a comfortable resting
place at the new fort, where they can be pointed out to the interested visitor
with a taste for antiquities. There is little to be learned in regard to the
lives of these first settlers, which must have been sadly monotonous and void
of incident, save when they were attacked by natives, which was sometimes
the case, the sons of the soil apparently resenting the intrusion of the white
man, and making it as uncomfortable for him as possible. It is, however,
reasonable to assume that as the settlement was partly a military one, and
consequently well armed, the natives came off second best whenever it came
to open fighting.
In the year 1827 Sir James [then Captain] Stirling arrived off the month
of the Swan Elver in one of His Majesty’s ships, and effected a landing. A
survey of the country about the localities where Fremantle and Perth now
stand was effected, and upon Captain Stirling’s report the Home Government
determined on forming a settlement at Swan Eiver. During the latter part
of the year Captain Stirling returned to England, and during 1828 prepara,
tions were made to settle the new territory, which was publicly advertised in
glowing terms. Highly encouraging promises were held out by the authorities
at the Colonial Office —promises which, it is fair to say, were acted upon, and
which led to the wholesale giving away of large and at the present time


exceedingly valuable pieces of land. Officers of the Army and Navy, by
virtue of their service, were amongst those who received large blocks, and
to others who were termed pioneers, and who in some, if not all, cases well
deserved this honorable title, one acre of land was granted for every one
shilling and sixpence expended in introducing servants into the new colony, or
who purchased and took out with them live stock, provisions, guns, pistols,
swords and ammunition for the purpose of protecting themselves from the
aggression of the natives, who were reported by Captain Stirling and his
officers to be hostile to strangers. The exceedingly liberal concessions made by
the Home Government had the effect of inducing what has been well termed a
fit of “ earth-hunger ” in England, and a large number of persons, many of
them of excellent families and holding high positions, determined to proceed
to Swan River, or to send their sons there. On the Ist of June, 1828, Captain
Fremantle, who had arrived in H.M.S. Challenger, landed at the port which
has since borne his name, hoisted the British flag on a point near the mouth
of the Swan, and took formal possession of the new settlement. On June Ist,
1829, the Parmelia transport arrived with Captain Stirling, who had been
appointed Governor of the Colony, and several Government officers, and the
foundation of the colony dates from that day. Closely following the Parmelia,
H.M.S. Sulphur arrived with a detachment of the 63rd Regiment, under
Captain P. C. Irwin, who subsequently acted as Lieutenant-Governor of the
colony, and from whom the Irwin River takes its name.
In 1829 New South Wales was the only settlement in what was then known
as New Holland without any defined limits. Such, however, was not the case
with Western Australia (then better and generally known as Swan River),
whose boundaries were defined by His Majesty’s Commission to include all
that portion of New Holland situated to the westward of 129 degrees of
longitude. Its greatest length is therefore 1280 miles from north to south,
and 800 miles from east to west, the City of Perth being in latitude 32 degrees
south. This extensive territory embraces nearly 4000 miles of sea-board. The
most striking natural features of Western Australia are its mineral wealth.
Besides large deposits of copper, lead, tin and coal, her gold area extends from
Dundas and Parker’s Ranges to Southern Cross, thence to Coolgardie, thence
to the Murchison, and thence to Kimberley, while her sea-board and rivers
abound with a greater abundance and variety of fish than is found in any
other portion of Australia. The pearlshell fishery is still a remunerative
source of industry.
On June 17th the first public proclamation was issued by the Governor,
and appointments were made of certain public officers. The site of the City
of Perth was decided upon on August 12th, and towards the end of September
of the same year the first assignment of lands on the Swan was made, and the
real work of settlement and of subduing the soil commenced. Immense
estates were given away, and the mSnth of December was rendered notable by
the arrival of Mr. Thomas Peel, a cousin of the renowned Sir Robert Peel, at
that time Premier of Great Britain. Mr. Peel brought out with him a number
of immigrants, in fact his party came in three ships, which were also laden
with valuable stores. For the large expenditure incurred in bringing out a
number of new settlers and valuable stores and equipments, Mr. Peel received
from the Home Government a grant of land equal to a principality, namely
about 1,000,000 acres, between the Swan and Murray Rivers, perhaps better
known as the Pinjarrah District, the prospects of which fruitful portion of the
colony have been recently rendered so bright by the commencement of the
South-Western Railway. A few months after Mr. Peel’s arrival, owing to bad
management, and lack of proper food and clothing, his servants, for such
these immigrants virtually were, deserted him, and struck out for themselves.
For thirty years the leader of the expedition resided in solitary grandeur on
his magnificent but unimproved estate, making little or no use of it, and the
relative of one of England’s greatest statesmen and the owner of one of (he


largest estates in the world, died in comparatively indigent circumstances. It
is perhaps better not to dwell on a painful and regrettable chapter in the
history of the early settlement of the colony, but it may be said that Mr. Peel
was by no means the kind of man to undertake the difficult and trying task of
pioneering a new and unknown country, and that he was not cut out for
“ a leader of men.”
Twenty ships, bringing numbers of settlers and valuable stores, arrived
during the year 1829, and considerable and satisfactory progress was made at
the new settlement. At the same time cases of individual hardship were
numerous, and there were many who wished that they had never embarked
on the venturesome task of colonisation. The names of the ships which
arrived in the year of the colony’s foundation were as follows: —H.M.S.
Sulphur, Challenger, Parmelia, and the clipper ships Calistra, St. Leonard,
Orelia, Caroline, Cumberland, Atwick, Governor Phillip, Admiral Gifford,
Marquis of Anglesea, Thompson, Amity, Georgiana, Lotus, Lion, Gilmore,
Buphemia, and the Success. The exact population of the colony on the 31st
is not known, but it must have been quite a thousand souls, and Perth and
Fremantle had commenced to assume the appearance of settlements, whilst
several more venturesome spirits were scattered about the country.
1830.
January of this year brought eight ships, and up to the end of the year
ninety-three ships in all arrived, bringing 1125 passengers and leaving cargo
to the amount of iM44,277. In May the immigrant ship Rockingham was
wrecked near Rockingham, whence the present townsite takes its name. The
ship was driven ashore in a severe storm, one life being lost. This year was
important for the assignment of lands on the Helena and Canning Rivers, and
settlements were formed at Port Leschenault, at Augusta and on the Black-
wood, in Flinders Bay. The Darling Range was crossed, and the Avon River
and York District were discovered by Ensign Dale, of the 63rd Regiment.
Ensign Dale had many hardships to fight against, and the exploration was
fraught with perils. The Swan River rose to such a height this year as to
flood the tents and buildings (such as they were) erected on its banks, and did
a great deal of damage to the goods and stock of the dwellers. The natives
became troublesome, and they shed the first blood by the unprovoked murder
of Mr. McKenzie, on the Murray River. Two natives, Yagan and Midgegoroo,
were the ringleaders. They led the others on to plunder and the slaughter of
breeding stock. A man named Entwhistle was barbarbously murdered by
Yagan and Midgegoroo, the cause of the murder being Entwhistle’s
familiarity with the gins. Yagan, who was a most celebrated native chief,
stood 6ft. Sin. in height, and was a noble specimen of a savage. He was
outlawed for the murder of Entwhistle. The Government offered a reward for
his capture. Two lads, tempted with the reward, encountered him, but Yagan
was too powerful for them ; he killed one of the lads, while the other narrowly
escaped with his life by swimming across the Swan River. Midgegoroo was
also another notorious chief, and worked in conjunction with Yagan. These
two natives were the terror of the district, and to their pillage and murderous
propensities there was no end, until the avenging hand of death cut short
their careers. About this time a Mr. Phillips and Ensign Dale were wounded,
and a great deal of breeding stock was destroyed by the natives. These were
indeed troublous times for the settlers, but they were only the commencement,
for aftewards the natives got almost beyond control, and their attacks were
frequent.
1831.
This year. King George’s Sound having been given up as a penal settle-
ment, that place was included within the jurisdiction of the colony. The first
agricultural society dates from this year, it having been established at
Guildford. One hundred and sixty acres of wheat were reaped, and there


were two hundred acres of land under cultivation, this being mostly done by
spade labor. On September sth the first body of settlers, under Ensign Dale,
went over the hills and founded York, and after a more extended survey of
that district the Toodyay Valley and Dale, Brockman, and Norcott Rivers, as
well as Lennard’s Brook, were discovered. Captain Bannister and party
accomplished an overland journey to King George’s Sound, after overcoming
many dangers and difficulties. At one part of the journey the Captain was
forced to kill his horse, as there was no feed, and after proceeding on their
journey about one hundred miles, they had to retrace their steps to where the
horse was buried, disinter it and eat of its putrid flesh —their provisions
having given out. They had much to contend against, and carried their
lives in their hands. This was a great undertaking, and the good it did for
King George’s Sound and the Capital was soon manifest. To the memory of
Captain Bannister the greatest enconiums should be extended, and he deserved
greater distinction than he received at the hands of the authorities.
1832.
The first sittings of the Legislative Council were opened in January of the
year 1832. The Council consisted of the members of the Executive, and during
the next month the first court was established for civil trials. There was a
great scarcity of provisions and money felt at this time. To give some idea of
the paucity of provisions the price of the following articles are quoted : —Salt
pork, J3lO per barrel; wheat, 355. to 40s. per bushel; and fresh meat. Is. lOd.
per pound; fresh butter (which was indeed a luxury) costing Vs. per pound.
At this period, through the high prices and other deplorable circumstances,
most transactions were done by promissory notes, which were issued or made
out from 2s. fid. to ss. each. An inventive genius named Woods devised a
scheme and temporarily came to the rescue. Woods bought up as many
German silver spoons, teapots, etc., as he could obtain, and forged a coin what
was then known as “Indian dump,” varying from Is. fid. to Is. Bd. Dumps
were then the common currency of India, prior to the introduction of the
rupee. These coins were neither round nor square, rather resembling a
pentagon in shape. Probably these coins resembled old, English coins which
were minted centuries ago. Western Australia.may therefore be rightly compli-
mented as having established the first mint in Australia, though of a primitive
kind. The coins were found to be very useful, and partly superseded the
promissory note. Woods, after rendering so much assistance in a financial
point of view for about six months, was charged with issuing spurious coin,
and was transported to Van Dieman’s Land for seven years, the then only
bank in the colony having discovered, greatly to its loss and detriment, the
spurious coinage. A public meeting was held at Perth to pass a resolution
calling on Captain Stirling to proceed to England and explain the position of
the colony to the Home Government. About two months afterwards Captain
Stirling sailed for England in H.M.S. Sulphur, and Captain Irwin was sworn
in as acting Governor/ The natives were very troublesome at this period,
Yagan and others having recommenced their depredations. They murdered a
settler named Gaze on the Canning, and did a lot of mischief to stock, upwards
of two hundred pigs being killed and driven away on the Swan by the natives,
who also speared a soldier’s wife on the Swan, and after doing further mischief
they, together with Yagan, were captured and sent to Carnac Island, from
whence they ingeniously managed to effect an escape in a short time. During
this year about 440 acres of land were reaped. In May of this year a manuscript
newspaper was published, and sold at 3s. fid. per copy. About December the
first printing press arrived from Van Dieman’s Land; and a small newspaper,
printed on letter paper, called the Fremantle Observer, was printed by Messrs.
MacFaull and Shenton, and issued in Fremantle. In a shed Belonging to
Colonel Latour the first newspaper was printed, at one end, anfi at the other
end of the structure the operation of grinding the first bushel of jvheftt grown
in this colony was carried on. Thus there was food for the mind mfcne end
of the building and food for the body at the other. As there fftm ft greats


dearth of news in those days, and it was difficult to get anything startling or
new, the publishers enlisted the sympathy of a Mr. Lamb as a contributor.
This gentleman's effusions caused much consternation and excitement,
especially in Fremantle, his literary efforts being more like the roarings of a
lion than the soft and gentle bleatings of a lamb. This writing caused such a
furore that it necessitated a speedy dissolution of partnership between
MacFaull and Shenton. Mr. MacFaull continued) the production, but in order
to do so with some amount of security he was compelled to go three miles in
the bush, where he took the type and printing press, and settled at a place
called Hamilton Hill. At Hamilton Hill Mr. MacFaull started the first
vineyard in the colony, the soil here being peculiarly suited to viticulture.
These vines were planted and reared by the writer of these pages. They were
obtained from the Cape of Good Hope in June, 1830, and about two years
afterwards were removed to a garden under Mount Eliza, where the cuttings
were sold at ss. each. These were the only vines in the colony for about
twenty years, and being mostly of the Sweet Water variety, may be attributed
the present abundant supply of that description of fruit. The reign of the
Observer was of short duration, as it became defunct in twelve months, the
cause being the inability of the proprietor to pay the weekly charge of £2 per
week for the hire of the plant; the old type and press being worth say little
more than .£2O. The owner of the press, a Mr. Weasel, soon after established
a paper called the Inquisitor , whose contributors were Captain Graham
(formerly Governor of Sierra Leone), Mr. Yule (afterwards Police Magistrate),
Mr. Johnstone (a merchant), and Mr. Clarke (a Scotch lawyer). A disagree-
ment arose amongst the staff, and a serious quarrel took place between Clarke
and Johnstone. High words were indulged in, and, in the heat of passion,
Johnstone said that Clarke was “no gentleman.” At this Clarke called
Johnstone out, and a duel was fought between the antagonists, in which
Clarke fired the fatal shot, which resulted in the death of Johnstone about
twelve hours afterwards. All those mixed up in the affaire de honors were
punished, but to a great extent the urfortunate episode was hushed up. Such
is the history of the first year’s publication in the colony—a disgraceful
termination to an organ which should have been the first to put down
dissensions, quarrels, and, above all things, murder.
1833.
On the Ist of this month the Perth Gazette made its first appearance,
under the proprietorship of Mr. Macfaull, which, unlike its predecessors, the
Fremantle Observer and Inquisitor, had a fairly successful career until 1835,
when the first severe blow to the freedom of the Press took place in a most
dishonest, legal action. It arose from the publication of a letter written by
Dr. Waylen’s father, detailing the cause of a vessel named the “Skerne,”
striking on a rock between Carnac and Garden Island, bound for California j
and accusing the Captain and crew of drunkenness. The damages were laid
at £SOO, the solicitor for the plaintiff being Mr. Nairn Clark—the same gen-
tleman who killed Mr. Johnstone in a duel —who pleaded that as the Captain
only required to protect his character, any damages the jury might assess,
would be handed over to the poor of Perth. The trial occupied two days, and
on the evening of the first day Clark had a private interview with the foreman,
and promised that £5 should be given to the jury for, what he termed, a spree,
at Mrs. Mason’s Hotel —then a wattle and dab shanty at the corner of Hay
Street east. The result was a verdict for £7O damages which, at that time,
from the scarcity of money, was equal to £SOO at the present time. The spree
came off, but poor Mr. Macfaull never recovered the financial difficulties in
which this memorable and unjust trial placed him. This year opened by the
blacks being very troublesome; numerous murders and oases of spearing
cattle, and sheep being driven off were reported. A body of natives were detec-
ted breaking into a store at Fremantle, and were captured and severely dealt
with. Two brothers named Yelvick were murdered near Bull’s Creek by
Yagan and a large body of natives, the notorious Yagan and Midgegoroo being


the leaders of this expedition. A squad of soldiers were sent in pursuit of
these natives, and to check their depredations. Midgegoroo was captured and
shot by the soldiers. Though Midgegoroo’s both eyes were shot out he showed
fearful malice towards the soldiers, evincing that bitter hatred and the brutal
passion were strong in death, by struggling hard to grapple with his captors
and wreak vengeance upon them before he died. Tagan was soon after this
taken, and his skull was sent Home to the British Museum. The first barracks
was built at Perth, and in August the foundation of the officer’s quarters was
laid. The place was getting somewhat civilized by this time, various sports
were indulged in, and in October the first Fremantle races were held. Numbers
of gallinule suddenly appeared and did great damage to the crops about this time.
The gallinule, a species of wild fowl, which flocked in thousands, did incalculable
harm to the crops. These fowl did so much harm that only 600 acres could
be put under grain crop on account of the quantity of seed taken, and the
great difficulty experienced in obtaining seed at seed time. Twenty-one ships
arrived during this year, bringing seventy-three passengers, and having
estimated cargo of the value of .£48,000. There was not a great influx of
population during this year, though inducements were held out to settlers
to come here.
1834.
In January of this year ferries were established at Fremantle, Preston
Point, Mount Eliza, and Guildford, and one pound notes were issued from the
Commissariat Office, in consequence of the scarcity of specie. Tenders were
accepted for building the Commissariat Store (the present Supreme Court) for
£2930, and in April Captain Daniell laid the foundation stone of the building.
A number of natives broke into the Mill at Point Belcher (Mill Point), and
about 1000 pounds of flour was taken. Captain Ellis succeeded in capturing
four of the plunderers, and three of them were severely flogged, which taught
them a wholesome lesson, and gave them some idea of what they might expect
should their depredations be repeated. About this time a quantity of wheat
was also stolen by the natives from Mr. Burges’ farm on the Swan. A soldier
named Larkin was attacked in the barracks on the Upper Swan by the natives
and killed. Throughout the colony the natives were very troublesome. News
came in from all quarters of murders and plunder committed; sheep and
shepherds being speared on the Canning by the natives. Mr. Bland’s cart was
attacked by natives on the York road, near Greenmount, where Mr. Souper
was wounded severely in the arm. An attack near the same place had been
previously made on another cart, when Mr. Beeoham was killed, and the late
Mr. John Chipper, senr. (father of Cr. Chipper) was severely wounded. Mr.
Chipper narrowly escaped with his life. He made a dash for freedom and life
in running away, but not before the natives succeeded in putting two spears
into his back, following him in hot pursuit. Fortunately, however, Mr.
Chipper managed to out-do his pursuers, and leaped from a rock twenty feet
high, which is now known as “ Chipper’s Rock.” Being a heavy man, Mr.
Chipper came to the ground below with such force that he burst the toes of his
boots, which were a pair of water-tights, nearly new. Mr. Chipper had to go
seven miles with the barbs of the spears remaining in his back, he having
succeeded in breaking off the long wood. Messrs. Bridge and Morrell were
attacked by the natives of the Murray District this year. Bridge was killed
and Morrell was wounded. The natives were so fierce here that the soldiers
were obliged to change their station to one of greater security, and many of
the settlers contemplated the abandonment of that part of the settlement.
Messrs. Nesbitand Barron were treacherously attacked, Nesbit being put to a
most shocking death, while Barron barely escaped with his life, having three
spears sticking in his body. His Excellency Sir James Stirling returned from
England in August. The Legislative Council was opened to the public during
its sittings this year. The month of October saw the foundation stone of the
new Government House laid by Lady Stirling. Sir James Stirling, with a
few gentleman and five policemen, proceeded on an exploring expedition to the
Murray District, where the police fell in with a party of natives, whom they


recognised as notorious offenders. A fight commenced, in which the police
were worsted, three out of the five being unhorsed by the first flight of spears,
the remainder of the party being rescued by Sir James and his party, who
came up and opened an immediate fire upon the natives. It is believed that
ten natives were shot during the affray. The police did not come out of the
encounter scathless. Captain Ellis receiving a spear wound in the temple, from
which he died a fortnight afterwards, while Private Hefferon, who died in the
Mount Eliza Depot only a few years ago, was badly wounded in the arm.
This treacherous tribe received such a lesson on this occasion that they
became particularly civil and friendly thereafter. The Murray Kiver tribe
were the most formidable in the colony. They were fine stalwart fellows,
standing from sft. loin, to 6ft. 3or 4in. Their great size and build might be
attributed to the abundant supply of flesh food in the district; the Murray
Estuary supplying any quantity of fish when other food failed. Very little
trouble was experiencedfrom these natives after the salutory lesson they received
from Sir James Stirling and his party. A short time after this an institution
was commenced by the Government, under the superintendence of Mr. F. F.
Armstrong, for civilising the natives. A petition to the Home Government
was got up at King George’s Sound for the introduction of convicts, but was
objected to by the rest of the colony. The entire amount of Government
expenditure for civil services this year was .£12,175 13s. 10d., out of which
only the sum of £5292 19s. 6d. was furnished by the Parliamentary grant, the
balance being provided from colonial resources. Just on 1000 acres were under
crop this year, and the increase in stock something considerable. One
hundred and fifty passengers arrived during this year, and the estimated
value of the cargo brought by eighteen ships to the colony was £26,942.
1835.
This year opened very badly, by the wreck of the cutter Cumberland,
which was entirely due to careless navigation. This disaster happened
between Garden Island and Point Peron. The wreck was plundered, the
depredators being arrested and sentenced to seven years’ transportation each.
There were seven persons concerned in the pillaging. A public meeting was
held in Perth to memoralize the Home Government touching various
grievances. The chief amongst them was for a proper definition of the land
granted by the Crown. It appears that when the land was granted there
were no surveys made, and when the purchasers wanted the quantity of acres
specified it was found that many of the grants ran half a mile into the sea.
This was afterwards rectified by allowing persons whose land went into the
sea to choose land anywhere they liked, of a quantity equal in value to the
original area. This year was notable for a valuation of the land, houses, and
stock having been taken, the amount of available security being found to be
£219,739. Land was worth very little at this time. The insignificant
value of it can easily be imagined when it was sold at per acre, and a
litt’e later in the year 1360 acres on the York Eoad were sold for 6d. per acre.
The blacks were not as troublsome during this year, though they made several
raids on the settlers’ property and speared two men named Morphy and Twine
at the half-way house, between Perth and Fremantle. Morphy died of his
wounds, but Twine recovered. In those days if one of the tribe was killed by
the whites the natives could easily be pacified and made to accept some trivial
compensation. In the case of Gogali, a native lad who was accidentally shot
in Perth, the relatives of the boy accepted some slight compensation. This
year commemorates the arrival of the first vessel sent by America to the
colony. There were 1579 acres of land under crop this year, and fifty bales of
wool were shorn and exported to the United Kingdom. The total number of
ships that arrived in the colony up to this date, from the year 1829, was 163,
their tonnage being 32,000 tons, the total imports being valued at £394,095,
and the number of passengers landed 2281.
1836.
In January of this year a committee was appointed at a public meeting,


held at Perth, to collect and forward home communications and particulart
respecting the colony as a settlement, etc. Later in the month the firss
brewery was established in Perth. A sign of improvement was perceptible
this year, contracts being issued to supply 1200 bushels of wheat to the
Government at an average price of 7s. per bushel. A court-house was
built at a cost of -CO9H. The Lady Stirling, the first vessel built of colonial
timber, was launched at Perth. The Moore Eiver, considered to be a splendid
pastoral country, was discovered this year. A whale-fishing company was
established at Premantle. Contracts for building public offices at Perth
were taken by several artisans, and a Trepang Pishing Company was pro-
jected. All these things were done, and many more of minor importance, by a
handful of people, who had only the commodity of wheat as their principal
medium of barter and purchase. They were of the right sort, hard and
tough old pioneers, determined to make a settlement, a home in the far-off
land, where the kangaroo and emu were wont to roam at pleasure. [These
were troublous days, as well as days of toil and hardship, and when we look
back and see the way poor old Western Australia has been kept under by the
Downing Street Government we cannot wonder that she is not upon all fours
in the march of progress with her favored eastern sisters. However, now that
Western Australia has her due rights, viz., self-government, she will go ahead,
and, though slowly at first, she must, ere long too, move by leaps and bounds.
To this end she has everything in her favor. But lam digressing. At the
proper time and in the proper place we shall deal with Western Australia’s
future. Let us return to her past history once more.] Colonial grown crops
were first exhibited in March of this year. The people were not unmindful of
ther religious teaching, for in the month of April a public meeting was held
at Guildford by the inhabitants of the Swan and of the former place, and a
committee was appointed to address the Archbishop of Canterbury on the
subject of clergymen being sent to the colony; and in July following a
missionary from the Western Australian Mission Society (now the Colonial
Church Society) arrived. During that month the foundation stone of a church
at Guildford was laid by Sir James Stirling. The wonderful nutritive powers
of the colony’s indigenous gum were exampled this month in the case of a
child, seven years of age, being lost in the bush for twenty-eight days and
afterwards recovered alive, having subsisted the whole of that time entirely
on what is now known as manna gum. Eight cwt. of gum was brought in by
the natives for the Government and exchanged for flour this month. The
natives were again troublesome. Two were shot whilst in the act of stealing
from a store at York, and later on they made a raid on the house of a settler
named Knott, whom they murdered, and afterwards burned his house down.
After the natives murdered Knott they cut off his legs. They did this by
reason of a superstitious tribal idea that the dead travel after them if they
leave them in their entirety. In October a second newspaper. The Guardian,
was started, being published by Mr. Naim Clark, who formerly fought and
killed Johnstone in a duel, of which mention has been made. It had only a
brief existence of one year, a complete file of the sheet being now in my
possession. An annual fare was started at Guildford, while ploughing matches
and races with thoroughbred horses were held. There were 2000 acres of land
under crop this year. The price of ewes ranged from £2 to £4 per head.
Horses were very dear then. In fact there were but few in the colony.
1837.
This year saw the establishment of the first bank in the colony, with a
capital of ,£IO,OOO, and in June the Bank of Western Australia was opened for
public business. The price of £5 and £2 respectively was fixed for town allot-
ments in the colony, according to their situation. [From the compiler’s own
knowledge many town allotments went cheaper than that; they were even
exchanged for a pint or two of rum.] In March direct communication with
King George’s Sound was opened by road. On Good Friday, this year, the new
Courthouse at Perth was opened for public worship, In the early part of thin


year the natives were very troublesome. They barbarously murdered a
soldier named Green at York, and wounded Mr. Sewell, a settler near Beverley,
as well as carried their depredations still further to Northam, where they
speared another much respected settler —Mr. Heale. The natives generally at
this period, especially those in the York District, were very dangerous and
ferocious. They murdered in a most horrible, ghastly way two farmers, named
Jones and Chidlovv. The tunnel at Fremantle was commenced in August of
this year. In coming down High Street a new arrival of the present day
doubtless wonders what it can be, and is at a loss to understand its import.
This tunnel was excavated by native prisoners. Colonel Irwin was appointed
Permanent Commandant this year, during which remission tickets for the
purchase of land were first introduced. It is important to know what these
“ Remission Tickets ” were for. They were issued to occupiers of land, and
they permitted them to render back to the Government two-thirds of their
grants, and to choose one-third of the number of the acres in other portions
of the colony. This arose out of hasty settlement and the want of proper-
surveys. As showing the inconsistency of a new colony being occupied without
survey much of the land then taken up was found to run half a mile into the
sea. Fresh meat was now sold at Is. 2d. per pound. At the Quarter Sessions,
held in October, there were no Europeans for trial, consequently the old
custom of presenting the presiding Judge with a pair of new white kid gloves
was followed, one of the gloves being of white silk, knitted by Miss Wittenoom
from cones of the silk-worm reared at the Perth Parsonage by the Chaplain
(the Rev. Mr. Wittenoom), where he planted the first mulberry trees, twelve
of which were presented by him to the Chairman of the Perth Town Trust,
who planted them opposite the Perth Cathedral. These were termed the
Twelve Apostles. Only about seven now remain of the number, the first being
cut down for the erection of the Deanery, and was called Judas Iscariot.
There was a great scarcity of imported articles at this time, particularly soap,
which varied in price from 2s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per pound. About November a
small parcel was brought from King George’s Sound, costing half a guinea per
pound. This led to the hackneyed saying of, “ How are you off for soap?” in all
parts of the colony. The natives were very troublesome on the Canning River
during this year, and two shepherd boys, named Charles Hokin and Glulow,
were desperately wounded by them. The number of acres under crop this
year totalled 11,924|, and the number of European residents were computed at
only 1820 souls in the whole colony. The colonial revenue amounted to
,£4586 2s. 3d., and the expenditure to £4121 12s. 7d.; the commissariat and
military expenditure was £11,544 13s. 7d.; Parliamentary, £6945 17s. lid.
The value of the exports was as follow . —Wool, £2900 ; oil, £300; whalebone,
£520; sealskins, £SOO ; miscellaneous, £IOOO. Total value, £6720.
1838.
We are now coming into times when things were more settled and new
discoveries were made. The importance of the colony began to assert
itself, and the old pioneers began to take heart and hope that they would be
able to do something with Western Australia after all, and that all their
attempts at colonization would not be futile. H.M.S. Beagle, which had
arrived at the latter end of the last year on a survey expedition, sailed from
Fremantle on a voyage of discovery of the Northern and North-West coasts of
Australia. The vessel returned in June following, having discovered the
Adelaide and Fitzroy Rivers. A Temperance Society and the Sons of Australia
Benefit Society were established at Perth this year, and both of which did a
great deal of good. The passengers and stock in connection with the Bengal
Australian Association arrived in that institution’s ship, the Guillardan.
Wheat was 9s. per bushel this year, and fresh meat sold at Is. 4d. per pound.
Merinos sold by public auction at £4 10s. per head. A native woman was
speared to death by natives in the streets of Perth, owing to tribal custom. It
appeared that if a member of one tribe was killed or died, the survivors of the
deceased’s tribe looked out for a victim in another tribe, and the first


opportunity they got they killed him or her, as the case might be. This was
done in order that the other tribe should not have more than they in case of
warfare. The natives were exceedingly troublesome at this time, numberless
outrages being committed by the Canning tribe. Natives came voluntarily
from King George’s Sound to Perth with letters and despatches, their great
object being, however, to revenge the murder of a native of their district on
Garden Island by two other natives, who were left there by the Champion,
schooner. A native named Wyaput was shot in the act of plundering a mill
on the Swan. A native was also shot on the Murray while attempting to
wrench a musket from a soldier, who was doing duty as guard. Five native
prisoners made their escape from Rottnest Island in the only boat which was
there, one of them being drowned; the sons of the deceased attacked his
companions and killed one in revenge; the others, however, were subsequently
recaptured. The remains of the French mariner Yasse supposed to be dis-
covered near the Yasse River, so named by the French in commemoration of
the event. Geographe Bay was discovered by a French man-of-war. While
the crew were engaged in taking soundings in a storm the boat got capsized,
and three of the crew escaped by clinging to the bottom of the boat, but Yasse
was missing, and was supposed to have been drowned. It appeared, however,
that he reached the shore, where he lived with the natives for three or four
years, and who were very kind to him, and after anxiously and longingly
awaiting the sight of a ship, which never appeared, he died on the beach,
where his bones were afterwards discovered. The first half-yearly dividend of
I4J per cent, was declared in June by the Bank of Western Australia. Up to
this period there were granted in Perth 422 town allotments and 15 suburban
lots. The value of the improvements in Perth was estimated at .£50,000, and
at Fremantle £28,000. In August 80 ewes, with lambs at foot, were sold by
auction at £5 each, while 100 imported ewes realised £4 per head. Vaccine
matter was first introduced into this colony in September of this year. The
October Quarter Sessions were adjourned, there being no cases of any sort for
trial. This was the same as the corresponding period last year, hence the
judge again got his white gloves. A public meeting was held at Perth to get
up a testimonial to Sir James Stirling prior to his returning home, the term
of his Governorship having expired. The American and French whalers in the
neighbourhood of King George’s Sound took 10,000 barrels of oil, which was
estimated to be worth £28,000; and there were no English or colonial whalers
at that port to share in the gains. There were now about 2000 settlers in the
colony, and the number of acres under crop was 2457.
1839.
This year brought with it a new Governor, in the person of Mr. John
Hutt, who arrived on the 2nd January, and was sworn in the next day. There
were four non-official members added to the Legislative Council. These four
non-official members gave their equal votes with the four official members, who
held office by virtue of their appointment, with the Governor as President,
who had the power of vetoing or approving measures in open council. In
February of this year Lieutenant (now Sir George) Grey, with a party of ten,
sailed for Shark’s Bay on an exploring expedition. He returned, however,
in April overland from Gautheaume Bay, where his boat was wrecked under
very unfortunate circumstances. Lieutenant Grey proceeded to the Mauritius
after the wreck to reorganise his party. During February the first public
clock was set up on the Government Offices, Perth. The price of Crown lands
was raised to 12s. per acre; 15,000 acres were sold, however, in different parts
of the colony by private individuals at 2s. 6d. per acre. A most blood-thirsty,
cruel, and horrible murder of a woman and her infant child, and the house
burned over their bodies, was committed by the natives in the Beverley
District, and a proclamation was published in the native language, as well as
in English, calling upon all persons to aid in discovering the perpetrators
of the diabolical deed. A meeting was called by the inhabitants of Perth to
propose an assessment for the improvement of the town. Sheep sold by


auction at the rate of £6 9s, per ewe and lamb. Even in these early days of
settlement the Perthites indulged in the histrionic art, and amateur perform-
ances were given. Cashmere goats were imported during this year. The first
steam mill commenced working in July. An allotment of land in Perth, partly
cultivated as a garden, was sold for £4OO. There was open warfare in the
streets of Perth between two parties of natives who were hostile to each other,
and the greatest difficulty was encountered in quelling the disturbance. In
October a land tax was proposed for the maintenance of a police force.
Tenders were accepted for 1000 bushels of wheat, at an average of Us. Bd. per
bushel. The number of acres under cultivation was 2726, and the population
was 2150 souls.
1840.
The ship Shepherd sailed in January direct for London, laden wholly with
colonial produce. Champion Bay was discovered during January of this year.
In February H.M.S. Beagle paid her second visit to Fremantle, after discover-
ing, on the northern coast, the Victoria and Adelaide Eivers. In March some
stock from Van Diemen’s Land was sold. Cows realised .£2l; heifers, £ls;
sheep, £2 25.; stallions, £SO to £6O; mares, £7O to £IOO. Imported stock to
the value of £BOOO arrived in the colony this year. The first issue of the
Inquirer newspaper was published on the sth of August this year.
In September of this year the foundation stone of the Wesleyan Chapel
was laid at Fremantle by Governor Hutt. Beacons were placed on Eottnest
Island by the aid of the officers of the H.M S, Beagle. The first pile was
driven of the bridge across the Perth Causeway in September, and 2700 acres
of land on the Swan were sold for £llOO, and 1280 acres at Northam for £250,
by the Sheriff. A church was opened at Guildford. Tenders were accepted
for 2000 bushels of wheat by the Commissariat Department at an average of
11s. 7d. per bushel, and for grinding the same 2s. sd. per bushel was paid.
The population of the colony was 2345, and the number of acres under
cultivation was 3299. There were 80,061 sheep in the colony; horned stock
numbered 2318; goats, 4604; horses, 500; swine, 1595; and asses 16. The
colonial revenue, from temporary sources, amounted to £8376 95., and the
expenditure to £5729 13s. Bd.; Imperial grant, £5373 11s. 6d.; and Com-
missariat ditto, £14,440 12s. Bd. At this time there were 522 grants, of the
extent of 1,413,129 acres, owned by colonists, and 207 town allotments. The
value of property, movable and immovable, in the colony this year was
estimated at £1,415,682.
