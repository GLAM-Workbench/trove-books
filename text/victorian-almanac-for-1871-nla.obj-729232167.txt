Explanation of the Calendar.
Sun’s Rising and Setting. —These numbers show the mean time when the sun’s
centre, elevated by refraction, appears on the horizon, the eye being on a level with
that plane.
Moon’s Rising and Setting. —The same as for the sun, only that the moon is
more depressed by parallax than elevated by refraction. When the mark occurs,
it shows that the moon will only rise or set that day. Thus, on the 14th of January,
the moon will only set at Melbourne. This arises from the lunar day being longer
than the solar. The moon, it will be seen, rises on the 13th at half an hour before
midnight, the next night she will not rise till one minute past midnight—that is, one
minute after the commencement of the 15th.
Phases of the Moon. —The times are here given to the nearest minute when the
moon is respectively o°, 90°, 180°, and 270° of longitude from the sun. Apogee is the
time of her greatest distance from the earth, Perigee of her nearest approach.


Sun’s Declination. —These quantities show the angular distance of the sun from
the equator, measured on a meridian. They are given for apparent noon, or the
instant of the sun s transit over the meridian of Melbourne, and are very useful
• eterm ™' n S the latitude by meridian altitudes, for which they will serve,
without reduction, sufficiently near for most nautical purposes, the whole of the
Australian coast. . Thus, suppose on the ist of January the altitude of the sun’s
lower limb at meridian transit had been observed to be 73° 22’, the height of the eve
being eighteen feet above the sea, and the instrument having an index correction of
+ 4 , the computation will stand thus :
Observed altitude of lower limb .. .. .. .. 73" 22' o"
Index correction .. .. .. .. .. .. -f 4 0
D ‘P 4 10
Apparent altitude of lower limb .. .. .. .. 73 21 50
Refraction .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 016
Parallax .. .. .. .. .. .. .. -f- 0 ,
Semi-diameter .. .. .. .. .. .. + 16 18
True altitude of centre .. .. .. .. .. 73 37 55
True zenith distance .. .. .. .. .. 16 22 5
Sun’s declination .. .. .. .. .. 523 324
Latitude S 39 25 29
The proper way of applying the declination may be easilv inferred from the circum-
stance that the sun is vertical when on the meridian of that place whose latitude is the
same as the declination. As the sun was observed to be 16° 22' 5" north of the zenith
the place of observation must be situated so much to the south of where the sun was
vertical; if the sun had been observed to the south of the zenith, the latitude would
have been 6° 41' 19" S. If the above observation be made on the meridian of Mel-
bourne (145° E. of Greenwich', the latitude thus obtained will be quite correct; for
any other meridian the declination would require a correction, which might be easily
obtained by interpolation, thus—as 360° ; diff. of long. ;.- diff. of declination in 24
hours: the correction required. But the maximum error of latitude caused by the
neglect of this correction will be less than two miles, and will be generally much
smaller between the limits of Cape Leuwin and New Zealand.
The Sun s Semi-diameter is used to reduce an observation of his limb to his centre.
Equation of Time.—This is the difference between true solar and mean solar
time ; it is used to find the latter from an observation of the sun. Thus, suppose on
the ist of January a sun-dial, or any other solar instrument, gave the time 2h. 36m.,
to get the mean time (which is that shown by a well-regulated common clock or
watch) we add 3m. 365., which makes the mean time 2h. 39m. 365. If the observation
had been made at noon, we should have added 3m. 335., the same as in the column ;
but for any other time than noon we must apply a correction, which may be found by
mt ,S r P O , lon - F or sun-dial purposes, however, the equation at nearest noon will be
sufficiently exact.
The Right Ascension of the Mean Sun is the angular distance in time of
the mean or fictitious sun from the first point of Aries at noon. It is the sidereal
time at mean noon, or that which should be shown by a sidereal clock when the
mean-time clock points to 12 at noon. It is used to find the mean time when the
sidereal time is known, or the converse. Thus, suppose the right ascension of Sirius to
be 6h. 39m. 285., this therefore will be the sidereal time when Sirius is on the meridian ;
subtracting from this the sidereal time at the previous noon, we shall have the interval
of sidereal time that has elapsed since the preceding noon ; which, by means of the sub-
sidiary table, given for the conversion of sidereal into mean solar time, may be
easily reduced into an interval of mean time, as in the following example :—Suppose
on the ist of January an altitude of Sirius had been observed which showed that
the star was 3 hours to the east of the meridian, the sidereal time would therefore be
3h. 39m. 285.; subtracting from this ißh. 41m. 125., increasing the former by 24 hours,
we get Bh. 58m. 16s. for the sidereal interval since noon; subtracting from this im. 285.,
we have Bh. 56m. 48s. for the mean time of the observation. By means of the table of
Semi-diurnal Arcs, the mean times of rising and setting of the heavenly bodies may be
found in a similar manner. If the right ascension of the true sun is required, it may
be found by applying the equation of time to the right ascension of the mean sun.
Thus on the ist of January the right ascension of the mean sun is ißh. 41m. 125., and
that of the true sun is ißh. 44m. 455.
I he Moon s Age is the interval elapsed at mean noon since the last new moon ;
it is given in days and decimal parts of a day.
Moon’s Meridian Passage.—This is the mean astronomical time at which the
moon’s eentre passes the meridian, or due north of Melbourne. It is very useful for


finding the time of high water. The symbol near the time of new moon shows
that the moon will not pass the meridian on that day, the astronomical day beginning
.at noon, twelve hours after the commencement of the civil day.
High Water at Williamstown. —The time of this table is civil mean time. It
has been calculated for Gellibrand’s Point, on the assumption that the change tide
takes place at ah. 31m., as deduced by Captain Cox, R.N., the late Admiralty Sur-
veyor, from a discussion of the tide-gauge papers for the year iB6O. When the
mark occurs there will be only one tide that day. Thus on the 14th of January
there will only be an evening tide. The tides here computed may be taken as the
average ones when high water may be expected ; the tides at Port Philip, however,
are so influenced by winds and other causes, that the actual times of high water will
sometimes differ from the calculated ones by more than three hours. The supple-
mentary table for the outports has been taken from the Government Gazette, June
22, 1858.
Duration of Twilight. —This table shows the time taken by the sun to move
from 18° below the horizon to sunrise, and to the same distance after sunset, when
his rays cease to illuminate the sky.

CALENDAR
Showing the Day of the Week and Month in any Year from 1800 to 1900.
Example.—To ascertain the day of the week corresponding to March 5, 1870, look in the Table
of years for 1870, opposite which will be found the letter B (termed the Dominical Letter); then look
in the Table of Months, opoosite March, for the same letter (B), and underneath the column con-
taining it will be found che Calendar for March, 1870, which shows March sto be Saturday. When
the Calendar for the Month is found, any other day of the week or month can easily be ascertained.
It will be observed that there are two letters opposite the Leap Year. The first letter is used for
January and February, the second for the other months.

Cylinder Contents in Gallons.—A simple rule for finding the
capacity of cylmdiical vessels in gallons, when the dimensions are taken
in inches, is to multiply Ihe square of the diameter by the height, both m
feet, and by si, which gives a correct answer to one gallon in twenty
thousand.

F< r R THE NSANE IN Victoria. —ln the decennial period from
lb&9 to 1869, the proportion of insane persons under care in the puhhc
asylums of Victoria has increased from 1 in 940 in the former year, to 1 in
tr I S th vv ) ?v t v t( i ryear -. The ratio in is 1 in 411. The ratio in
Ajew couth Wales is lin 387. The ratio of recoveries to admissions in the
Victorian asylums during the year was 42 05 per cent., while in England
the average for ten years has only been 33 93 per cent. The percentage of
deaths in Victoria in 1869 was 7'87, as compared with 10 - 31 in England,
there were 999 males and 706 females in the asylums at the close of 1869.
Styptic Paper. A mixture of one pound of gum benzoin, one pound of
alum, and four and one-third gallons of water, is to be kept boiling for
four hours, and skimmed from time to time. The water evaporated is to
be replaced by the same quantity of fresh water, and, as soon as the solu-
tion is cooled it is to be filtered off. The paper is then dipped into it,
kept there until saturated, and then dried. When dry, a solution of the
perchloride is applied by a brush. The paper is folded up and preserved
from the action of the air in a piece of waterproof taffeta.
lo Coat Iron with Silver. —Cast iron can be coated with silver by
means of a moderately strong galvanic battery, by using the following:—
One ounce of lunar caustic is to be dissolved at a boiling heat in sixteen
ounces of distilled v?ater, to which, diluted, two ounces of cyanide of pot-
assium are to be added. The whole is then to be mixed with forty-eight
ounces of water, in which one ounce of salt has been dissolved. The cast
iron is to be freed from any oxide just before silvering, by means of weak
nitric acid applied for a few minutes.
. ,jll ° Colour Zinc Black. —Zinc may be given a fine black colour by clean-
ing with sand and sulphuric acid, and immersing for an instant in a
solution composed of four parts of sulphate of nickel and ammonia in
forty of water, acidulated with one part of sulphuric acid, and washing and
drying it. The black coating adheres firmly, and takes a bronze colour
under the brasher.


Medical Hints for the Household.
It frequently happens that accidents and illnesses occur when there is no
opportunity of calling in medical advice, or it may be desirable to act
befox-e its arrival; we therefore giro the following hints, which we trust
will be found useful:—
Scalds and Burns. —lf the injury has happened to unexposed parts, be
careful in removing the clothes. If the injured parts be blistered , do not,
on any account, break or open the blister ; but put on and around it a
thick coating of flour, or o ver it with a linen cloth soaked in a mixture
of one-third lime-water and two-thirds linseed-oil. If the skin be broken,
apply the lime-water and oil in the same manner, or a linen cloth wetted
in warm brandy.
Cut Wounds. —Bring the separated edges of the wound as exactly
together as possible, and keep them in that position by strips of sticking-
plaster, or of soft linen cloth, which must be wound carefully, but not
tightly, round the part. If considerable pain and throbbing arise, remove
the dressing, and apply a poultice of bread-and-water.
Bruised Wounds. —Endeavour to bring the separated edges together,
and to maintain them so, as in a cut ; but if this fail, or is impracticable,
apply a bread-and-water poultice in the first instance, and a linseed-meal
poultice as soon as the matter begins to be formed,
If the bleeding from either a cut or bruised wound be considerable,
pressure must be made upon the part by a hard pad of linen.
Chilblains. —Before they are broken, rub them once or twice a day
with soap-liniment, and wear warm worsted stockings. After they are
broken, apply poultices of bread-and-water , or of linseed-meal.
Fractures.—These accidents are often made more serious by injudicious
awkward movements of the parts before surgical assistance is procured. If
either of the bones of the arm be broken, it is best to put the fore- arm at
a right-angle with the upper, and support it so by a sling that reaches
from the elbow to the finger-ends. If the injury happen to one of the
bones of the leg, the body should be kept in a horizontal position, the
injured limb being placed as nearly as possible in its natural state in
regard to length, and la big (irmly tied to tho sound limb if the person
have to be moved. If moving be necessary, it is better that the patient be
carried by hand on a shutter or board, rather than ride in a carriage of any
kind.
Bleeding prom the Nose. —Bathe the nose with cold water, or vinegar-
and-water. Make pressure externally on the side from which the blood
issues ; and if these means fail, introduce into the nostril a plug of lint, or
linen-rag, soaked in a solution of alum.
Sprains. —Keep the joint perfectly at l'est. If one of the joints of the
leg be injured, let the person keep upon a bed or sofa. Apply warm moist
flannels to the injured part, or a large poultice of bread-and-water. If the
pain be vex-y considerable, a few leeches should be applied. Above all
else, avoid motion of the joint.
Colds, with or without Fever.- —On going to bed, let the feet, and
legs be bathed in a warm bath. Drink freely of whey, warm thin gruel,
or warm weak tea with plenty of milk in it. If there is pain in the head,
apply a mustard poultice on the back of the neck until the skin is i*ed and
pa.iiiful. If there is pain in the chest, the side, or any part of the abdo-
men, put the mustard plaster directly over the painful part until the
same effect is produced.
Poisons. — Acids —lf spirits of salt, oil of vitriol, aquafortis, or oxalic
acid have been by ac orient swallowed, let the person drink freely of water
in which magnesia, chalk, or common.whiting is largely mingled. Then
induce vomiting. Alkalies —lf hartshorn, ammonia, or chloride of lime


have been swallowed, give vinegar-and-water (one-fourth of the mixture
to be vinegar) freely, and afterwards excite vomiting. Opium If opium
or laudanum been swallowed, give a teaspoonful of mustard powder
in a half-pint of warm water ; repeat this quantity in five or ten minutes
if vomiting has not occurred. Keep the person constantly walking about,
and use other means to prevent sleep. Arsenic —Give copious draughts of
warm milk, and endeavour to excite vomiting Goppei —ln poisoning
from copper, or from food dressed in copper vessels, give, one after the other,
the whites of a dozen eggs in warm water. Then excite vomiting. . £ 'ungv
When these have been swallowed in mistake for mushrooms, give warm
milk, and endeavour to produce vomiting. Vomiting, in case of poison,
may often be induced by tickling the swallow with a feather or with the
point of the finger. Snake Sites —Immediately on being bitten, suck the
wound ; then cut out from the part bitten a piece of flesh not larger than
a sixpence ; drink a wineglassful of brandy, or other pure spirit, at
intervals of a quarter of an hour, in proportion to the emergency of the
case and the age of the patient ; and lie down in the open air, on a sofa or
arm-chair, until recovered. Applying a thin red-hot iron to the bitten
part would answer instead of excision, but is more painful, and not
generally so quick at haud. Quickness of action is even more important
than the nature of the remedies.
Fits. — Fainting Fits— Place the person in a horizontal position, with
the head low. Throw cold water on the face. A small quantity of wine,
or weak brandy-and-water, may be given as soon as swallowing is practi-
cable. Hysterics— Lay the person on a couch, pour cold water on the
head and give 15 or 20 drops oi fetid spirits of ammonia in a wine-glassful
of water as soon as they can be swallowed. Convulsions —Put the person
into a warm bath, keeping the head elevated, and pouring cold water upon
it. Mustard-plasters may be applied to the chest, belly, and inner sides
of the legs. Keep the feet warm. _
Bad Smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid chloride of
lime on the floor. Fumigation by burning pastiles is also a common
expedient for the purification of the sick-room. They are useful, but
only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer who commenced his
lecture thus Fumigations, gentlemen, are of essential importance;
thev make so abominable a smell that they compel you to open the
windows and admit fresh air.” In this sense they are useful, but
ineffectual unless the cause be removed and fresh air admitted..
Sick Rooms. —“lt is another fallacy,” says Florence Nightingale, “to
suppose that night air is injurious. A great authority told me that in
London the air is never so good as after ten o clock, when smoke has
diminished; but then it must be air from without, not within, and not air
vitiated by gaseous airs.” “A great fallacy prevails also,; she says in
another section, “about flowers poisoning the air of the sick-room: no
one ever saw them over-crowding the sick-room; hut, if they did, they
actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen. Gut flowers also
decompose water, and produce oxygen gas. Lilies, and some other very
odorous plants, may perhaps give out smells unsuited to a close room,
while the atmosphere of the sick-room should always be fresh and
' Warm Water. —Warm water is preferable to cold water as a drink, to
persons who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious complaints, and it may
be taken more freely than cold water, and consequently answers better
as a diluent for carrying off bile, and removing obstructions in the urinary
secretion in cases of stone and gravel. When water of a temperature
equal to that of the human body is used for drink, it proves considerably
stimulant, and is particularly suited to dyspeptic, bilious, gouty, and
chlorotic subjects.


DISEASES OF CHILDREN.
Dentition is usually the first serious trouble, bringing many other
disorders in its train. The symptoms are most perceptible to the mother.
The child sucks feebly, and with gums hot, inflamed, and swollen. In
this case, relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to time with a little
borax and honey. Selfi-h and thoughtless nurses, and mothers too,
sometimes give cordials and sleeping-draughts, whose injurious effects
are too well known.
Convulsion Fits sometimes follow the feverish restlessness produced
by these causes, in which case a warm bath should be administered without
delay, and the lower parts of the body rubbed, the bath being as hot as
it can be without injury to the tender skin ; at the same time, the doctor
should be sent for immediately, for no one should administer mediciue in
this ease, unless the fits have been repeated and the doctor has left
directions how to act.
Croup is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood. It is accom-
panied by a hoarse, croaking, ringing cough, and comes on very
suddenly, and most so in strong, robust children. A very warm bath should
be instantly administered, followed by an emetic, in the form of a tea-
spoonful of ipecacuanha wine, repeated every ten minutes until vomiting
is produced, wrapping the body warmly up in flannel after the bath. No
delay in administering the bath or the emetic should take place.
Hooping Cough is generally preceded by moaning noise during sleep,
which even adults threatened with the disorder cannot avoid; it is
followed by violent fits of coughing, which little can be done to relieve.
A child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as possible in
the fresh, pure air, but out of draughts, and kept warm and supplied
with plenty of nourishing lood. Many fatal diseases flow from this
scourge of childhood, and a change to purer air, if possible, should follow
convalesence.
Worms are the torment of some children. The symptoms are, an
unnatural craving for food, ever after a full meal; costiveness, suddenly
followed by the reverse; fetid breath, a livid circle under the eyes,
enlarged abdomen, and picking ti.e nose; for which the remedies must be
prescribed by the doctor.
Measles and Scarlatina much resemble each other in their early
stages. Headache, restlessness, and fretfulness are the symptoms of both.
Shivering. fits, succeeded by a hot skin; pains in the back and limbs,
accompanied by sickness, and. in severe cases, sore throat; pain about
the jaws; difficulty in swallowing; running at the eyes, which become red
and inflamed, while the face is hot and flushed—often distinguish scarla-
tina and scarlet fever, of which it is only a mild form. While the case is
doubtful, from 5 to 10 drops of spirit of nitre diluted in water, given at
bedtime, will throw the child into a gentle perspiration, and will bring
out the rash in either case. In measles, this appears first on the face ;in
scarlatina, on the chest; and in both cases a doctor should be called in.
In scarlatina, an emetic of ipecacuauha wine may be administered in the
meantime.
To Destroy Ants.—Kerosene poured into their holes and about their
haunts will either kill them or drive them away effectually. Of the many
ways of destroying them otherwise, one of the most certain is to take a
piece of coarse sponge, dip it in a mixture of sugar or treacle, squeeze
most of this out, and lay it down in some place frequented by them.
They will collect in the hollows of the sponge in great numbers, when the
sponge and ants may be dropped into boiling water. By repeating this
process a house may be soon cleared of them.


Directions for Restoring the Apparently Drowned.
Send immediately for medical assistance, blankets, and dry clothing', but
proceed to treat the patient instantly on the spot, in the open air. Efforts
to promote warmth and circulation must be deferred until natural breathing
has been restored.
TO RESTORE BREATHING.
TO CLEAR THE THROAT
1. —Place the patient on the floor or ground,
with his face downwards, and one of his arms
under the forehead, in which position all fluids
will escape by the mouth, and the tongue itself
will fall forward, leaving the entrance into the
windpipe free. Assist this operation by wiping
and cleansing the mouth.
2. —lf satisfactory breathmg commences, adopt
the treatment described below to promote warmth
and natural breathing. If there be only slight
breathing, or no breathing, or if it fail, then —
TO EXCITE BREATHING—
3. Turn the patient well and instantly on the
side, and
4. —Excite the nostrils with snuff, hartshorn, or
smelling salts, or tickle the throat with a feather,
&c ,if they are at hand. Rub the chest and face
warm, and dash cold water on it.
5. —lf there be no success, lose not a moment,
but instantly—
TO IMITATE BREATHING—
-6 —Replace the patient on the face, raising and
supporting the chest well on a folded coat or
other article of dress.
7. —Turn the body very gently on the side and
a little beyond, and then briskly on the face, back
again; repeating these measures deliberately,
efficiently, and perseveringly, about fifteen times
in the minute, or once every four seconds, occa-
sionally varying the side.
[By placing the patient on the chest, the weight
of the body forces the air out; when turned
on the side, this pressure is removed, and air
enters the chest.]
8. On each occasion that the body is replaced
on the face, make uniform but efficient pressure,
with brisk movement, on the back, between and
below the shoulder-blades or bones on each side,
removing the pressure immediately before turning
the body on the side.
[The first measure increases the expiration, the
second commences inspiration.]
The result is—respiration or natural breath-
ing, and if not too late —Life.
CAUTIONS.
1. —Be particularly careful to prevent persons
crowding round the body.
2. —Avoid all rough usage, and turning the body
on the back.
3. —Under no circumstances hold thebody up
by the feet.
TO PREVENT FUR-
THER DIMINUTION
OE WARMTH.
N.B.—These efforts
must be made very
cautiously, and must
not be such as to pro-
mote warmth and cir-
culation rapidly; for if
circulation is induced
before breathing has
been restored, the life
of the patient will be
endangered. No other
effect therefore should
be sought from them
than the prevention
of evaporation, and
its result, the diminu-
tion of the warmth of
the body.
1. —Expose the face,
neck, and chest, ex-
cept in severe weather.
2. —Dry the face,
neck, and chest, as
soon as possible, with
anything at hand; and
then dry the hands
and feet.
3. —As soon as a
blanket or other cover-
ing can be obtained,
strip the body; but
if no covering can
be immediately pro-
cured, take dry cloth-
ing from the by-
standers, dry and re-
clothe thebody, taking
care not to interfere
with the efforts to
restore breathing.
CAUTIONS.
1. Do not roll the
body on casks.
2. Do not rub the body
with salt or spirits.
3. Do not inject
tobacco-smoke or in-
fusion of tobacco.
4. Do not place pa-
tient in warm bath.


Farmers’ anb Garbeners’ Calendar.
JAJItABY.
KITCHEN GARDEN. — This month is generally too hot and dry to
a,dmit of much being done in gardening operations, except in low
moist situations, where cropping can be carried on almost at any time.
Where water is plentiful and easily applied, young crops should be watered
once or twice a week, care being taken that the soil be well stirred with
the Dutch hoe after every watering. If rain or dull weather occur, a few
cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, broad and kidney bean, lettuce, pea,
onion, radish, and turnip seeds may be sown to a limited extent; with the
exception of the peas and beans, all the seeds should be slightly protected
from the intense sun by shading with calico, litter, or some other suitable
material. Early potatoes should be planted, for use in April.
Flower Garden. --Dahlias and roses should be looked after; the former
requiring staking, disbudding, mulching, and watering; the latter to be
pruned when necessary, so as to give a fine autumn bloom ; decayed flowers
should be removed, and every means used to render the plant vigorous.
Carnations should be layered. Chrysanthemums, phloxes, ancf other
herbaceous plants will want staking and thinning.
Farm. —Farmers will be busy harvesting the grain crops; when the
ground is cleared, lose no time in ploughing or scarifying the stubbles to
destroy weeds, and if the weather permit, turnips might be sown, and
would yield good feed for sheep, and a good dressing of manure. Man-
golds, carrots, and other root crops must be kept clean by horse-hoeing.
FEBRUARY.
Kitchen Garden. —Cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, spinach, and turnip
should be sown. Early potatoes may be planted largely. Celery and
leeks to be transplanted into trenches. Dig up any vacant ground in
readiness for autumn cropping ; the soil is pulverised and sweetened by
exposure to the atmosphere. Cabbage and cauliflower plants should be
planted largely. If dry, water as last month.
Flower Garden. —Proceed with the propagation of favourite plants by
layering, cuttings, or otherwise. Plant at the end of the month a few
hyacinths, tulips, anemones, ranunculi, and narcissi for early blooming.
Sow stocks, larkspur, mignonette, &c. Take care that camelias, azaleas,
rhododendrons, and the like plants, do not suffer from want of water.
Climbers must, be regulated, the stronger growing kinds cut back, and
others neatly tied up. All decayed flower stems or leaves to be removed ;
walks to be kept neat and orderly.
Farm. —The plough will be in active use this month, unless the weather
is very unfavourable. Sow turnips for sheep—also oats, Cape barley, rye,
and tares for green feed. Continue the use of the horse-hoe amongst
drilled crops. Look to your manure heap, collect everything that is
convertible into manure, and when thoroughly rotted, cart on to your
land.
'MARCH.
Kitchen Garden.— Sow cabbage, cauliflower, early horn carrots, broc-
coli, lettuce, peas, radish, spinach, and turnip. Kidney potatoes may still
be planted. Earth up celery. Top-dress asparagus beds with salt or sea-
weed. If new strawberry beds are required, plant runners as soon as you
can obtain them ; three-year-old beds should be destroyed.
Flower Garden. —Dahlias, hollyhocks, liliums, and Pompon Chrysanthe-
mums will now be in their prime ; liquid manure will prolong aud enhance
the beauty of these flowers ; dead blooms must be picked off, or the plants


will be impoverished. This is the best month to sow hardy annual and
perennial tlower seeds. Prepare your ground for planting shrubs, orna-
mental trees, &c.; if not already trenched, get it done at once. Her-
baceous plants can be divided, and planted where wanted ; carnations
and pinks may still be propagated by cuttings under a bell glass. Keep
all weeds down. , , .. -m -u
Farm. —Ploughing will chiefly occupy the farmers attention. 1 lougn
deep—the extra expense is tiitiing compared with the benefits derived.
In some districts wheat-sowing will commence ; see that the niiest and
cleanest samples of seed are selected, and do not neglect to dress by using
a solution of blue vitriol, at the rate of 1 lb. to the sack. Sow lucerne,
Cape barley, rye, oats, tares, and Californian prairie grass This is the
time for preparing land to plant live fences in—quick or whitethorn hedges
are the best; the ground should be ploughed and subsoiled.
A I* !l I I-
Kitchen Garden.— Finish manuring and digging ground ere winter
sets in. Take care that young crops of turnips and carrots are kept tree
from weeds. Continue planting out cabbages, cauliflower, and celery ; the
latter would be much benefited by an occasional dose of guano water.
Sow peas (early varieties), broad beans, onions, parsley, endive, radish,
and spinach. Plant potato-onions, shallots, garlic, rhubarb, and horse-
radish. Earth up celery as required. Look to your herb bed ; where
necessary, divide the roots, and make fresh plantations. If strawberry
runners were not planted last month, let them be this. .
Flower Carden. —This is one of the busiest months in the year : most
kinds of everereens, and ornamental and flowering shrubs, are best trans-
planted now, and any alterations that are to be made in laying out
grounds should be commenced. Take up gladioli lilmms, and other
bulbs that have done flowering ; store them away in boxes packed m dry
sand. Finish planting hyacinths, tulips, crocuses, narcissi anemones
ranunculi, ixias, &c., &o. Renovate edgings of camomile thrift, box, and
thyme For new plantations of roses the ground should.be trenched and.
heavily manured; if light soil, some stiff loam should be incorporated with
it Propagate by cuttings any kind of soft-wooded plants you wish to
increase ; bell or hand glasses are required for this purpose.
Farm. —Oat sowing will commence in some places, but m cold districts
May or June are better months. For green feed, sow Cape barley and
oats : lucerne, clovers, and grasses of all sorts may also be sown,
previously testing their germinating powers by sowing a sample in a
tiower-pot, that expense and disappointment may be averted. Young
crops of barley, oats, &c , would be much benefited if a pair of light barrows
were run over them. Potatoes should be lifted and stored, as they are
liable to a second growth if left in the ground.
»S A A.
Kitchen Garden. —Asparagus, rhubarb, and sea-kale beds will want
cleaning and manuring Sow broad beans, peas, lettuce, onions, radish,
and spinach for successional crops. Plant out early cabbages and late
sowings of celery. Finish manuring and digging all vacant ground,
whether wanted for immediate use or not; bear in mind that turning
overground in a wet state does it more barm ban good. If ground is
wanted for other purposes, carrots, parsnips, and other tap-rooted
vegetables may be taken up and stored.
Flower GAden.—As dahlias and hollyhocks die off, the stalks should
be cut down and cleared away ; the former being taken up and housed in
a dry shed or cellar. Look over jour seedling, annual, and other plants,
thin them where thick, and keep slugs and other vermin away. Prune


perpetual flowering, banksian, and other spring-blooming roses. Continue
planting evergreens and flowering and ornamental shrubs; stake the same
when necessary. Propagate by cuttings fuchsias, roses, &c. Attend to
hedges, keeping them well clipped ; if new ones are required, use
hawthorn, furze, osage orange, or acacia, where strength is required ; if
light small hedges are wanted, the small-leaved prickly acacia, Cape
broom, sweet brier, or pittosporum, are the best.
Farm.—Complete wheat-sowing; also sow barley, beans, oats, peas,
rye, and vetches for seed. Finish sowing grasses, clovers, and lucerne.
Store turnips and mangolds if ground is required for other purposes.
JUKE.
IlrrcuEN Garden.—Get all heavy work in the most forward state possible.
This is the best month for planting all descriptions of fruit trees ; trench-
ins' and deep draining are essential to their well-doing ; if soil is poor and
manure be needed, use bone dust in preference to guano. Commence
p> lining fruit trees, beginning with those which have lost their foliage,
bow to a limited extent cabbages, cauliflowers, broccoli, early carrots,
lettuces, and radishes. Make good sowings of broad beans, peas, and
leeks, binish planting garlic, shallots, horse-radish, rhubarb, sea-kale,
and asparagus.
Flower Garden..—lf possible, finish planting all kinds of trees ; choose
calm dull weather for the purpose of transplanting, and take care that the
roots are mutilated as little as possible. This is a good time for sowing
grass seeds for lawns and borders. Dig neatly your flower beds, adding
if necessary a little well-rotted manure. Finish pruning roses, flowering
shrubs, &c. Old rose stools that have been standing for years should be
taken up and replaced with young vigorous plants.
Farm.—Sow barley and oats largely either for hay or seed. Continue
sowing beans and peas. Prepare land for mangolds, carrots, potatoes,
maize, sorghum, chicory, tobacco, &c. The deeper the ground is worked,
the better will be the crop. On rainy days, numerous jobs indoors may be
done, such as mending and making pig troughs, hurdles, gates, &c.
JULY.
, Kitchen Garden. —Plant largely of early potatoes ; sow parsnips upon
rich deep soil—the latter ought to have been trenched two feet or more.
Sow peas, largely—Bedman’s dwarf, blue imperial, Champion of England,
Burbidge's eclipse, climax, and alliance are among the best for general
purposes. Sow largely of the various kinds of broad beans in rows thirty
inches apart. Established plantations of rhubarb and sea-kale may be
forced by covering the crowns over with pots or slates, and covering these
again with fresh horse-manure. Plant globe artichokes in rich soil, in
rows four feet six inches by three feet. Sow main crops of onions, also
spinach, radish, and small salads.
Flower Garden.—lf former directions have been carried out, there
will not remain much to be done this month, with the exception of
keeping all the walks, borders, and beds neat and clean.
Farm.—Continue ploughing and harrowing lands intended for spring
cropping. Hoe drilled crops. Continue sowing grasses, clover, lucerne,
and peas ; beans may still be sown in late localities. Oat and barley
sowing should be completed this month if the weather has been at all
favourable.
AUGUST.
Kitchen Garden.—This month will close the season for planting fruit
trees, &c;., so that all diligence must be used. August is the chief month
for sowing seeds of various kinds—such as cabbage, cauliflower, carrot,
leek, lettuce, onion, parsley, parsnip, peas, radish, spinach, salsafy, and


scorzonera. If frames are obtainable, make up hot-beds for early
cucumbers, melons, vegetable marrows, &c. Tomatoes may be sown in
pots in a frame for planting out in October. Plant Jerusalem artichokes
and main crop of potatoes. Plant out cabbages, cauliflowers, leeks, onions.
Flower Garden.— lf the manuring and digging of the flower garden be
not completed before now, it should be attended to at once. Tall growing
annuals will require tying up. Propagate fuchsias, chrysanthemums, and
climbers from cuttings. Repot plants commencing growth and wanting
pot room. Dahlias for early flowering may be started m a little bottom
heat; seedling nemophilas, larkspurs, clarkias, &c., may be transplanted
lf Farm.—Potato planting may be commenced now, but September is the
principal month for getting in the main crops. English barley can still be
sown. Oat and wheat crops should be rolled. Prepare land for sorghum,
beet, and mangold crops.
SEP TEMBJG K.
Kitchen Garden.—This is the busiest month in the year for seed sowing
—most of the hardy vegetables may be sown, and towards close of month
all the tender sorts. Potatoes of all kinds should be planted for mam
crops. Make a sowing of peas for succession. Early longpod beans may
still be sown in low-lying ground. Sow scarlet rummers, dwarf trench
beans, beet, carrot, cucumber, melon, vegetable marrow, pumpkin onion,
radish and spinach ; mustard and cress should be sown every fortnight;
sow celery on a hot-bed. Tomatoes and capsicums may be sown in warm
situations ; if any have been raised in a hot-bed, harden a little and plant
out Plant Chinese yams and sweet potatoes in well-trenched soil. Fruit
trees will require attention ; with the finger and thumb displace any
superfluous shoots, and if time can be spared, the blossom buds should be
thinned, especially of young trees. . ,
Flower Garden.—The floriculturist has generally numerous insect
pests to annoy him in this month, such as green and black fly, red spider,
scale, and thrip, to say nothing of slugs, caterpillars, &c. Gishurst s com-
pound will be found the best remedy for the former. T lant out calceolarias,
cupheas, geraniums, heliotropes, pansies, salvias, &c. Sow both tender and
hardy annuals. ~ . , , ,
Farm.— Sow carrots, chickory, maize, mangolds, parsnips, and tobacco.
Plant potatoes. Lucerne and grasses can still be sown. Keep the horse-hoe
at work between drilled crops, and plough in weeds on fallow ground.
() ( T O II li It.
Kitchen Garden.— lf season is moist, carrots, leeks, onions, and pars-
nips may still be sown. Sow largely of kidney beans, early turnips, capsi-
cums, tomato, cucumber, vegetable marrow, pumpkins, melons, and parsley;
also tall-growing varieties of peas—they will not grow very high at this
season of the year. Plant out largely cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and
celery' also, sow again for succession. Weeds will grow apace ; choose a fine
sunny day for hoeing them down, and rake off when withered, or perchance
a shower may coma, and a great number of them start into growth again.
Flower Garden. —Balsams, cockscombs, globe amaranthus, zinnias,
and other tender annuals should now be sown, if not already done ; if
sown in pots, and transplanted into flower beds, place m sunny weather
an empty flower-pot over the patches of young plants; remove the pots
every evening, or the plants will grow up weak and spindling. Climbers
will be growing fast, and will require constant trimming and training.
See that flower beds are kept filled by turning out large plants in pots _
Farm —This is the last month that potatoes can be planted, except m
low-lying lands. Sow largely of maize and sorghum ; mangold sowing
should also be completed. Earth up early crops of potatoes with double-


breasted plough ; do not delay this operation too long, or you will injure
the fibres.
SOVBMIIE it.
Kitchen Garden.—Beds of rhubarb and sea-kale that have been forced
should be cleaned off. Cease cutting asparagus, or you will weaken the
roots. Attend to cucumbers and melons ; if any have missed, sow again,
Stop leading shoots of cucumbers, to induce laterals. If tomatoes are not
planted against a wall or fence, they should be tied up to strong sticks,
and pruned moderately, or fruit will be small and few. This is the time
for preventing a great deal of pruning in winter; use the finger and thumb
. judiciously in disbudding and stopping fruit trees ; thin the fruit where
thick ; increased size and superior flavour will be the result. Vines will
require frequent attention as regards training, tying, and thinning shoots.
Flower Garden.—Hybrid perpetual roses should have their shoots
pruned back immediately they have bloomed. Newly-planted shrubs or
plants suffering from hot sunshine should be protected by boughs of
tea-tree or wattle. Empty casks, with both ends knocked out, make very
good shelters, although rather unsightly. At close of month, budding
may be proceeded with. Flower seeds can still be sown, although with
greater risk of their well-doing than if sown earlier.
Farm.—ln some districts harvesting will have commenced, and farmers
generally will have little time to attend to growing crops of mangolds,
potatoes, &c.; but if the weeding and hoeing of these are neglected, they
will soon tell tales. Maize and sorghum may still be sown.
DECEMBER.
Kitchen Garden.—Cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and savoy may
be sown in shady places; peas, kidney beans, lettuce, spinach, and turnips
can also be sown, but not to any extent. Onions, carrots, and parsnips
will require thinning and weeding. Matured onion bulbs should be
harvested at once, or the sun will injure them for keeping. Plant out
early celery plants in trenches, and give abundance of water when
established. Early potatoes for seed, when ripe, should be taken up and
greened, by exposing them to the atmosphere for a few days, under the
protection of a shed or verandah.
Flower Garden. —Bulbs that have flowered and died away should be
taken up and packed in dry sand. This is the best month for planting
out dahlias for autumn blooming. Roses and fruit trees may be budded.
Newly-planted shrubs and trees will be benefited by having some rotted
stable straw spread on surface of soil, which should first be Well stirred.
Farm.—Wheat harvest will be getting general in earlier districts : both
wheat and oats should be cut before being thoroughly ripe. English barley
should be fully ripe before being cut, in order that when used for malting
it may all sprout at once. Hoe and earth up potatoes.
T2l E VISE.
An east or north-easterly aspect is best for the vine ; next best is the
north ; south-east may be good ; the west is the worst aspect of all. The
vine will succeed in almost any soil, but flourishes best in a deep,
calcareous, light ground ; it will thrive in any soil composed in part or
whole of volcanic debris, mixed with gravel or sand, and resting upon a
limestone formation. The best manure is bone dust, but in naturally
good soils no manure is needed. Trenching the ground is absolutely
necessary if large crops, fine fruit, and good flavour are desired ; if a
retentive clay bottom, two to two and a half feet trenching will be
sufficient, but if a fine loose porous subsoil, three feet will be better.
Draining is also essential to the well-doing of the vine, unless the ground is
E


well drained naturally. The distance at which vines should he planted
from each other depends somewhat on the soil, for if planted upon poor
hungry land, as a matter of course they will not grow so strong and
luxuriantly as they would on- good rich soil The trellis will no doubt
supersede all other modes of growing, when it becomes more known than
at present; the heaviest crops, the finest fruit and of the best quality,
are produced by this system. Plant the vines eight feet apart between
the rows, and twelve feet apart between the plants in the row ; one-year-
old plants are best. The majority of German and Swiss vignerons plant
their vines much closer than the plan just mentioned—viz., five or six
feet apart from row to row, and only two feet apart in the row ; others
again plant them four feet apart each way ; an acre planted thus will
contain about 3100 vines. The best time for planting vines is from the
beginning of June to the end of August, or in late seasons they may be
piaVited up to the middle of September.

Grass and Clover. —The following are the sorts and quantities of Grass and
Clover Seeds suitable to most soils, but the quantity of either kind can be
increased or reduced, attention being paid to the nature of the soil and subsoil,
so as to ensure early growth, with good bottom, nutritive qualities, succession,
productiveness, and permanency:—Per Acre : 12 lbs. Perennial Rye Crass 14 lbs.
different kinds of Fescues, 4 lbs. Cocksfoot, 2 lbs. Foxtail, 2 lbs. Rough-stalked
Meadow Crass, 2 lbs. Wood Meadow Grass, 3 lbs. Timothy, 1 lb. Sweet Vernal—
total, 40 lbs. Grass Seeds; with 2 lbs. White Clover, 2 lbs. Red Clover, 2 lbs. Red
Perennial or Cow Grass, 2 lbs. Alsike, 8 lbs. Clover.
Manures. —The following are the quantities of the undermentioned manures
generally applied to an acre of ground of ordinary quality 2o tons farm-yard
manure ; 10 cwt. crushed bones ; 5 cwt. crushed bones and 1J cwt. guano : 3 cwt.
Peruvian guano. 2 ozs. of guano to the gallon of water, or one part of cow-dung
to ten parts of wa' er, are customary proportions for liquid manure.
Treatment for Seeds supposed to have Lost their Germinating Power. —
Steep the seeds in water with a grain or two of oxalic acid, and sow. Or place
them in a temperature of seventy degrees, laid on flannel; turn twice a day,
keeping them moist and at a regular heat, being the state most favourable to
germination; sow at the end of twenty-four hours. lodine facilitates the
germination of seeds; put a small quantity in the water with which they are
watered.
To Grow Celery in Winter.— Have the drills ranging north and south, or
near those points so that the sun strikes the drill with full power. Manure with
a compost of turf and loose dung, which enriches the soil and keeps it light. For
the winter crop the manure must not be worked deep in the trench, but should
be as abundant in the ridge as in the drill, encouraging the roots to ramify all
through the upper and warmer soil of the ridge. Allow three feet for eartiling.
Melon Jam.— Cut the melon into small pieces, and to every pound of melon
add three-quarters of a pound of white sugar. To every ten pounds of melon put
two lemons; pare them, and cut the peel into very small pieces ; remove the
pith and cut up the inside before mixing. Then add one ounce of whole ginger to
every ten pounds of melon, which must be well bruised and p'aced in a muslin
bag, and boiled with the melon until flavoured to taste. The whole to be boiled
five hours, and kept well stirred. This jam is strongly recommended to the
useful housewife, as being a cheap and wholesome substitute for butter, and
more suitable than butter for children’s use.

number of sick in all the schools at the close of the year was 204; the
deaihs, 43 in all the schools, or under 2 per cent. The total cost of
the buildings erected for industrial school purposes has been about £70,000.

Favourite Flowers and their Cultivation.
The Pansy comprises many beautiful varieties, all of which ‘ ‘ sport ” most freely
into myriads of diversifications of new forms and tints. The beauty of pansies
depends much on their cultivation and mode of treatment. In order to insure a
constant succession of bloom through the summer, a bed should be prepared with
good rich mould, about the month of March, in which young plants, that have
either been struck from cuttings or side shoots, should be placed about
nine inches apart. The flowers will begin to show themselves about the middle
of September, at which time the soil about the roots should be pulverised, and if
the weather is dry, water should be freely applied. A succession may be obtained
from cuttings (which will readily take root if planted in a shady situation), for
the purpose of making new beds or replacing the old ones.
The Pink is a hardy flower, and no garden need be without it, for it will grow
readily in any tolerably dry and well-cared-for soil. If the soil of the garden be
not suitable, a mixture of yellow loam, garden soil, and well-decomposed stable
manure, about one-third of each, with some road-grit to keep it open, makes a
good compost. Plants for early flowering should be put out in beds the first
week in June, and successional plants later in the month. About twelve inches
apart is a very good distance when permanently planted out. A top dressing of
well-decayed manure ought to be applied early in spring, to bring the plants
forward for blooming. As the plants spindle for bloom, oidy three or at most
four stems ought to be allowed to remain on each plant. These should be tied
to neat stakes, and as the buds appear, only three or four should be left on each
stem. In dry weather, water freely; in hot weather, shade the plants if extra
fine blooms are desired. The pink is readily increased by pipings, planted in
light sandy soil; when rooted, put into store beds for transplanting as desired.
The Polyanthus only succeeds in the more temperate portions of the
Australian continent, as it is extremely susceptible of injury from long-continued
heat; therefore the most sheltered situations should be chosen. New varieties
are raised from seed, which may be sown in small pots in June or July, covering
the seed lightly with soil, and the covering closed with glass. The plants will
make their appearance in about six weeks ; when large enough, transplant into
other pots, watering very sparingly. Polyanthuses make nice borders or edgings
in suitable localities; elsewhere they should be shaded, or kept in pots in a
frame. The best soil is a light sandy loam. To have flowers of a fine size, thin
out all superfluous buds. Those in the centre are the best to take away.
The Anemone is generally planted in March, the tubers being covered with
about two inches of a light sandy soil. When the plant appears above the
ground, and when coming into bloom, if the weather be dry, water moderately.
The beauty and continuance of the flowers will be promoted by judicious shade.
Window Gardening.—Of hyacinths, for blooming indoors, either in pots or in
any of the various contrivances that are used instead of pots, strong bulbs should
be selected and placed in succession. Place them in any dark, coo! situation for
three or four weeks, to allow of their making roots before exciting them into
growth. If pots are used, and these are doubtless the best, if not the most
ornamental, use good rich saudy soil, and secure perfect drainage, for a liberal
supply of water is required during the blooming period.
Gladioli. —This class of beautiful bulbous plants cannot be too strongly
recommended to all lovers of gay flowers. They are equally' well adapted for the
autumn decoration of flower gardens, either in beds or borders, and of continuous
development when cut for the flower-vase. Any common garden soil will suit
them if enriched by digging in a little well-decsiyed stable or cowyard manure;
but the soil should be moderately deep and open, to allow the roots to descend,
and be well drained. '
Phloxes. —About beginning of October take the strongest shoots from the old
plants, and root by placing in hot-bed, such as is used for propagating dahlias.
When rooted, plant in pots, and repot as required. Plant out in rich soil by end
of November or beginning of December, and affording slight protection until
established, watering liberally, both whi e growing and when in bloom They
bloom in March and April, and the plants are at their best in the second season
of flowering. The principal points to be observed in phlox culture are dwarflsh-
sess fine foliage, and large heads of flowers.
Mignonnette is universally esteemed for growing in boxes or flower-pots,
particularly in town windows ; and although generally treated as an annual,
yet if prevented from flowering too profusely, by pinching off most of the
flower-spikes, it will attain the size and habits of a small shrub, and last in
bloom for a lengthened period.


USEFUL RECIPES.
Curdled Milk.—To prevent milk from curdling, to retard its acid
change, it suffices to saturate the acetic and lactic acids which may be de-
veloped in it by the addition of a little bicarbonate of soda. About 15
grains of this alkaline salt to each pint of milk is sufficient and is harmless.
The worst “ turned'’ milk may be restored to its normal state by adding
some bicarbonate of soda, in the proportion above mentioned, and again
boiling it.
To Make Cuttings Grow.—A very excellent plan is to boil some
small potatoes until they are nearly done, and stick one on each slip,
before setting in the ground. Very few slips treated in this manner will
fail to sprout and grow with anything like ordinary attention afterward.
To Produce Large Strawberries.—Remove the soil around each hill
to the depth of half an inch or more, without disturbing the roots ; then
spread over an area of twenty inches in diameter a pound of finely
pulverised linseed meal or oil meal, and cover it over with mellow soil;
then spread a mulching of hay or straw two or three inches deep over the
entire surface between the hills. Should the weather be warm and dry, a
liberal supply of warm water daily will generally promote the growth of
both vines and berries.
_ Crystalising Flowers.—This is done by suspending or repeatedly
dipping them in water saturated with alum. This, however, can only be
done with dried specimens. The freshness and beauty of flowers can be
preserved by dipping them in glycerine.
Moss on Flower Pots.—Ladies who are fond of cultivating flowers in
the house, will find great benefit to the plants by spreading a coat of
moss over the earth in their flower pots. This keeps the water from
evaporating, and the temperature more uniform.
To Renovate Black Silk.—Rub the silk all over on the right side
with a solution of ammonia and water (two teaspoonfuls of powdered am-
monia to a quarter of a pint of warm watfer), and smooth it on the wrong
side with a warm iron, and the silk will regain a bright black appearance.
To Clear a Room op Mosquitoes.—Take of gum camphor % piece
about one-third the size of an egg, and evaporate it by placing it in a tin
vessel, and holding it over a lamp or candle, taking care that it does not
ignite. The smoke will soon fill the room, and expel the mosquitoes.
Liquid Glue.—Three parts of glue, broken into small pieces, should be
covered with eight parts of water, and left to stand for some hours ; one-
half of chlorhydric acid and three-fourths of sulphide of zinc must then
be added, and the whole exposed to a temperature of from 178° to 192°
Fah. during ten or twelve hours. The compound thus formed does not
gelatinise ; it only needs to be allowed to settle, and will be found most
useful for mending porcelain and glass as well as wood.
Artificial Yeast. —Place a quart of good strong yeast in a vessel, and
cover it up warm until it has well worked and has a good head on it; then
stir in sufficient maize meal or wheat meal to make into a stiff dough, and
flatten this out with the hands into cakes the size of the top of a tumbler, or
less. Lay these on a nice dry board or sieve, and dry in the sun or over a
fireplace, turning them every day until quite dry. If dried in the sun,
they must be brought in every night, otherwise the damp will injure them.
When dry pack away in tins in a dry place, as the slightest moisture in-
jures them. For use, mix one of these cakes in about a pint of warm water,
and with it make a batter in the centre of your dish of flour, or set a
sponge overnight, and proceed in the morning as usual with yeast bread.
One cake will raise twelve pounds of flour.
Insects on Rose Bushes. —Whale-oil soap and rain water, in propor-
tions of one to seven, sprinkled on bushes infected with aphis, rose-bugs,
slugs, &c., will prove effective in dispersing these pests, gk


To Make Unfermented Wine.—The grapes must be ripe and sound,
and ought to be black. Pick the fruit off the stalks. Bri ak or squeeze
on putting them into an enamelled boiler, and then place on a slow fire.
When the piece boils take off the scum. Pet it boil until seeds and skins
sink. Take off the boiler and let it grow cold. Strain through a colander.
Prepare a tapering flannel bag (very fine, like a jelly bag), and strain
again three times. Pour the juice or wine into clean bottles, filing to the
bottom of the neck. Then place as many bottles in the boiler as will
stand, and fill the boiler with cold water level with the wine in the bottles.
Then place on the fire, and when the water boils, boil for half-an-hour.
Take out one bottle at a time. Put in sound cork, and seal with resin or
wax. Put the bottles away in a cool place, and leave till wanted for use.
Wine made in this way will keep many years. It becomes brilliant and
clear, and retains the delicious flavour of the grape.
Children should be taught to use the left hand as well as the right.
Coarse bread is much better for children than fine. Children should sleep
in separate beds, and should not wear nightcaps. Children under seven
years of age should not be confined over six or seven hours in the house,
and that time should be broken by frequent recesses. Children and
young people must be made to hold their heads up and their shoulders
back while sitting, standing, or walking. r lhe best beds for children are
of hair, or, in winter, of hair and cotton. From one to one pound and a
half of solid food is sufficient for a person in the ordinary avocations of
business. Persons in sedentary employments should drop one-third of
their food, and they will escape indigestion. Young peisons should walk
at least two hours a day in the open air. Young ladies should be pre-
vented bandaging the chest; we have known the worst diseases, terminat-
ing in death, which began in this practice. Every person, great and .small,
should wash all over in cold water ever}' morning, heading aloud is con-
ducive to health. The more clothing we wear, other things being equal,
the less food we need. Sleeping-rooms should have a fireplace, or some
mode of ventilation besides the windows. Young people and others can-
not study much by lamp-light with impunity. The best remedy for eyes
weakened by night use is a fine stream of cold water frequently applied
to them.
Stray Grains for Chickens.—Feed your poultry on raw onions chopped
fine, mixed with other food, about twice a week. It is better than a
dozen cures for chicken cholera. Fowls exposed to dampness are apt to be
troubled with catarrh, which will run to croup, if not attended to. Red
pepper mixed with soft food, fed several times a week, will remove the
cold. Pulverised charcoal, given occasionally, is a preventive of putrid
affections, to which fowls are very sunject. Setting hens can be cured
by putting water in a vessel to the depth of one inch, putting the hen into
it, and covering the top cf the vessel for about twenty-four hours. The
vessel should be deep enough to allow the fowl to stand up. Pulverised
chalk administered with soft food will cure diarrhoea. This disorder .is
caused by want of variety in the food, or by too much green food. Garlic,
fed once or twice a week, is excellent for colds.
Nails in the Foot. —To relieve from the terrible effects of running a
nail in the foot of man or horse, take peach leaves, bruise them, apply to
the wound, confine with bandage, and the cure is as if by magic. Renew
the application twice a day, if necessary, but one application generally
does the woi’k.
Waterproofing Canvas. —One pound alum, one pound sugar of lead,
one gallon and a-half boiling water; when cool pour off the liquor, and
use as required. _
To Garden Plaster of Paris Casts —lt is said that the addition of a
small quantity of finely pulverised marsh-mallow roots to calcined plaster


of Paris will prevent the mass, when mixed with water, from hardening- so
rapidly as it commonly does, so as to prevent its applicability to many pur-
poses. It will require nearly an hour to become thoroughly set; and then
it will be found to have acquired such an extreme toughness and tenacity
as to permit it to be filed, turned, and bored, and otherwise manipulated,
almost as satisfactorily as ivory, bone, or meerschaum. Mixed with dif-
ferent colouring matters, an excellent imitation of marble can be pro-
duced.
Red Dye for Wool.—A good, bright, red colour may be obtained in
the following way : —Stiff paste is made of lac dye and sulphuric acid, and
allowed to stand for a day. For dyeing ten pounds of wool, one pound of
tartar, two-thirds of a pound of salts of tin, and three-quarters of a pound
of the paste, are required. The wool must be boiled in the bath for three-
quarters of an hour, after which it must be rinsed and dried.
Paste Blacking. —3 gills vinegar, 4 ozs. ivory black, 1 oz. oil of vitriol,
1 oz. sperm oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. Put the oil. ivory black,
molasses and sugar into a bowl together, stir them up well, then add the
vinegar. Let it remain two or three days before adding the vitriol; then
bottle taking care to have the corks well resined. It is best to keep it six
months, but may be used directly.
To prevent Feathers working through Ticks.—Empty the feathers
from your tick, turn it wrong side out, and liy it on a tsble. Then, with
a p ece of beeswax, slightly warmed, rub the tick thoroughly, giving the
entire surface a light coat of the wax. No more feathers will ever work
thr ugh that tick until the stuff is worn through.
To take Stains out of Silver or Silver Plate. —Steep the plate in
soap-lye for four hours; then cover it over with whiting wet with vinegar,
so that it may st ck thick upon it, and dry bran, and the stains will not
only disappear, but the plate will look exceedingly bright.
Rats may be prevented from gnawing harness or other matetial which
absorbs grease, by mixing with the oil applied a little cayenne pepper, say
a teaspoonful to the quart.
Cement that will Resist Red Heat and Boiling water may be
made as follows : —Dried cby in powder, 6 lbs.; iron filings, 1 lb.; make
into paste with boiled linseed oil.
Quicksilver Coating for Iron. —The iron is cleaned with hydrochloric
acid, and then immersed in a dilute solution of sulphate of copper with a
little of the acid aforesaid. The thin coat of copper produced thereby is
to be cleaned off ; the iron is then placed in a very dilute solution of cor-
rosive sub imate, with a few drops of the acid. The iron will now be
covered with a mercurial coat, which cannot be rubbed off. If washed
with muriate of ammonia solution, it will effectually prevent rust.
A Glue which will Unite even Polished Steel. Dissolve five or six
bits of gum mastic, each of the size of a large pea, in as much spirits of
wine as will suffice to render it liquid. In another vessel, dissolve in
brandy as much binglass, previously softened in water as will m ike a two-
ounce vial of strong glue, adding two small bits of gum ammoniac, which
must be rubbed until dissolved. Then mix the whole with heat. Keep in
a vial closely stopped. When it is to be used, set the vial in boiling
water.
Mosquitoes, Flies, Ants, kc. —A tincture prepared by macerating
one part of pyrethrum roseum in four pans of diluted alcohol, and when
diluted with ten times its bulk of water, applied to any part of the body,
gives perfect security against all vermin.
Varnish for Artists.—A good varnish for mechanical and architec-
tural drawings, maps, &c., is obtained by dissolving in one gallon of
alcohol one pound of white shellac, one-quarter of a pound of camphor, and
two ounces of balsam fir.


House Papering.—As many persons living in the country are obliged
to do their own papering, a hint or two will be timely. Walls that have
been whitewashed should be wet with alum water before applying the
paper. One edge of the paper should be removed with the shears before
the lengths are cut. Remember to match the pattern before cutting the
lengths. The paste should always be made the day before, as it should be
perfectly cold when applied to the paper. A very good paste may be
made as follows: Put into a pot or kettle about a gallon of water: it will
take nearly that quantity for a room requiring from twelve to fourteen
rolls. Mix about a pint of flour with a very little water, just like dough
at first, making thinner afterwards; this avoids lumps. When the water
boils pour in the batter. Stir to prevent burning, and as soon as it boils,
turn into a milk-pan or convenient vessel, and let it stand until next day.
If it should be lumpy you must strain it.
To Fasten Leather to Metal.— Steep the leather in an infusion of
gall nuts ; and, a layer of hot glue being spread upon the metal, forcibly
apply the fleshy side of the leather to it. It must dry under pressure.
The eather will be torn sooner than separate from the metal.
Directions for Making a Will.
The Will must be signed at the foot or end of it by the Testator, or by
some other person in his presence and by his direction. The signature
must be made or acknowledged by the Testator in the presence of two or
more witnesses, present at the same time. The witnesses must attest and
subscribe the Will in the presence of the Testator. A Will must be all in
writing, and may be on either paper or parchment.
A gift to an attesting witness, or to the wife or husband of an attesting
witness, is void; therefore neither a legatee, nor the wife nor husband of
a legatee, should be made an attesting witness to the Will.
No particular form of attestation is necessary, but the following may be
used ; if used, it must be copied and written at the end of the Will, below
the signature of the Testator: —“Signed by the said , the Testator,
in the presence of us, present at the same time, who in his presence have
subscribed our names as Witnesses.”
The Testator should appoint one or more Executors.
If, after the execution of the Will, any alteration be made in it, by
obliteration, interlineation, or otherwise, care must be taken that such
alteration be executed in like manner as the Will itself. And it will be
desirable also that the names of the Testator and Witnesses be written on
the margin of the Will, opposite every such obliteration, interlineation, or
other alteration.
Wills may at any time be revoked ; but Wills made by single persons or
widowers are absolutely void on their marriages after the date of the
Wills.
Form of Agreement for Sheep-Shearers.
We hereby severally agree to shear for Mr. the sheep row depas
turing on the station, or such portion as we may be directed to shear
at the rate of shillings per 100 sheep, finding our own rations. We
also hereby severally agree to shear the sheep in a proper and workmanlike
manner, to the satisfaction of the said , or whom he may appoint to
superintend the said shearing, and to obey all lawful orders relating
thereto. We also further agree that, in the event of being discharged
through bad shearing, disobedience of orders, or other misconduct, before
the said shearing is finished, to receive payment at the rate of
shillings per 100 sheep, for all sheep shorn up to the time of such
discharge. Rations to be supplied at the following rates: —Sheep,
each; flour, per bag; tea, per lb.; sugar, per lb.


THE NEW REGULATIONS UNDER LAND ACT 1869.
The following are the points of most importance to those interested.
CONSTITUTION OP LOCAL LAND BOARDS.
Members, how appointed.—A local land board shall consist of not more
than five members, two of whom shall form a quorum. The Commissioner
of Crown Lands and Survey may appoint such persons as he may think fit
to be such members: the qualifications hitherto required by regulation 7
of Regulations of Ist February, 1870, being hereby dispensed with.
Boards appointed under these regulations to be local land boards for the
purposes of former regulations. —A local land board constituted as afore-
said shall be deemed to be a properly constituted local land board, for the
purpose of any regulation now in force under Land Act, 1869, referring to
local land boards; and local land boards already constituted shall not be
affected by reason of members thereof not having been qualified under
regulation 8 when appointed, or afterwards ceasing to be so qualified.
APPLICATIONS FOR OCCUPATION OF CROWN LANDS UNDER PART 11 OF ACT.
The regulations 1,8, 4,5, 6,7, 8,9, 10, 11, and 13, of Ist February,
1870, relating to above matters, shall be and same are hereby rescinded,
except as to any allotment of which the boundaries shall have been
defined under section 3 of said rescinded regulations before the rescinding
thereof, and as to all rights and obligations in respect of any such allot-
ment, said rescinded regulations shall remain in full force.
Boundaries of Allotments. —Every unsurveyed allotment applied for
must, where practicable, contain at least two right angles, and be quad-
rilateral. If a narrow strip of land be left between any such allotment,
and a watercourse or lake, the shortest side of allotment must front that
strip of land. The boundary line must conforpi to true meridian or to
magnetic meridian, or as nearly thereto as circumstances will admit.
Application after record in land office to be forwarded to district sur-
veyor.—The land officer, after recording particulars of occupation shall
forthwith forward it to the district surveyor, who, if boundaries of land
applied for be unsurveyed, and he is cognisant of no valid objection to its
alienation by selection, shall instruct Government contract surveyor to
effect survey thereof, at cost of applicant, in accordance with scale of fees
mentioned in previous regulations of Ist February.
Application and objection thereto are to be publicly investigated by a
local board, recommendations of such board to be forwarded in writing to
Board of Land and Works within eight days after sittings of local board.
Permission to occupy pending issue of license. —If no valid objection
to immediate occupation shall appear, the Board of Land and Works may,
by permission in writing, authorise occupation by applicant of whole or
any part of allotment pending issue of license, and may recommend
Governor to issue such licence to occupy same.
Date of License.—lf permission to occupy shall have been given as
aforesaid, license shall be dated as of day from which occupation was
thereby authorised; but if no such permission has been given, date of
license shall be that of day of signing same ; but in every case the rights
and obligations of license shall be ascertained with reference to day,
actually named in license, which shall in all courts of justice be conclusively
deemed to have been inserted in accordance with this regulation.
RESUMPTION OF LAND FOR MINING PURPOSES.
Manner in which resumption of land for mining purposes may be ap-
plied for, and form of application.—Any person, including licensee, lessee,
or purchaser may apply for resumption of land alienated under provisions
of Land Act, 1865, by lodging an application and depositing £2O with a
warden having jurisdiction under Mining Statute, 1865, within district in
which land is situated.
Where there is more than one application, such applications are to be
dealt with in order of presentation.


Applicant to give notice of hearing.—Seven days at least before day
fixed for hearing application, applicant shall advertise same once in some
weekly paper and twice in some daily paper circulated in neighbourhood
of the land, and shall serve a copy thereof upon the following persons :
Licensee, lessee, or purchaser (or if the grant should have issued, the
registered proprietor), and the person in apparent possession of the land;
or if the land be vacant, applicant shall post a copy of notice upon some
conspicuous position upon the land.
Upon satisfactory proof having been given to the warden as to service of
notice, he may, at time and place appointed, hear the evidence of appli-
cant upon oath in support of assertions contained in application, and
also evidence in opposition to such assertions.
In default of appearance application is to be dismissed, and warden at
his discretion may dispense with a notice of hearing. Persons desirous of
receiving notice of proceedings may give addresses for service.
Warden may ascertain the value of land as he may think fit, and must
transmit a report to Minister of Mines within seven days from the hearing.
Governor in Council may resume the land at any time after report, and
form of notice of resumption.—At any time after the report has been
transmitted, the land therein mentioned may be resumed by Governor in
council; and notice of resumption, stating a day subsequent to notice
upon which resumption is to take effect, shall be published in Government
Gazette, and publication of such notice in Government Gazette shall be re-
ceived in all courts of justice as conclusive evidence of such resumption,
and of preliminaries prescribed by regulations having been complied with.
If the land be not resumed within two months from hearing, application
is to be deemed dismissed.
Immediately after publication of Gazette containing notice of resumption,
a copy is to be posted by Board of Land and Works to parties interested.
If application be granted, the £2O deposited by applicant shall be
returned to him; but if not granted it will be paid into consolidated
revenue, or, at discretion of Board of Land and Works, paid as compensa-
tion to any person who shall satisfactorily prove that he has incurred any
expense in or about opposing the application.
After resumption all estates and interest created by alienation to deter-
mine.—On and after day named for resumption in notice published as
aforesaid, all estates and interests in the land therein mentioned created
under Land Act, 1869, or derived from any such estate or interest,
shall absolutely cease and determine, and the Crown shall have same
remedies in respect to unauthorised occupation of land as if it were
Crown land which never had been alienated ; provided, also, that until thirty
days after such day, no act of any person other than applicant for resump-
tion, or some person by him authorised in that behalf, done upon or in
relation to such land, shall be of any force or effect in creating or initiat-
ing any right or title, or determining priority of any application for per-
mission to mine in or upon said land, or any part thereof, or to occupy
same or part thereof for any purpose in relation to mining.
Compensation payable after notice of resumption. —The person entitled
to compensation under section 99 may apply therefore to Board of Land
and Works at any time after publication of notice of resumption, and may
be paid such compensation as he and Board of Land and Works agree
upon, not exceeding the amount named as sufficient compensation by
warden in report transmitted as aforesaid. Such compensation is to be
settled by arbitration.
Unpaid purchase-money to-be deducted from compensation. Any un-
paid license fees, rent or purchase money, which would have been payable
to Crown as license fee 3, rent, or purchase money before issue of a grant
in fee, if land had not been resumed before grant, shall bo deducted from
sum agreed upon or awarded as compensation for resumption.

AGENTS :
WILKIE, WELCH & CO., 44 Queen-street.
As a proof of the Superiority of the
THRESHING MACHINERY
Manufactured by
CLAYTON and SSTJTTLEWORTH,
They beg to call attention to the following statement :• —
Engines and Machines sent ont in the year 1868—812 Engines, 644 Machines.
Total number sent ont np to December 31,1868—8921 Engines, 7982 Machines.
THE GOLD MEDAL was awarded them at the Paris Exhibition, 1867, for
PORTABLE ENGINES & THRESHING MACHINES,
And at the last trial of the Royal Agricultural Society they gained every First
Prize offered for Steam Engines; also the Prize of £15 for FINISHING
THRESHING MACHINE, and Silver Medal 'for Special Improvements. On
this'occasion 25 of the principal makers of portable engines competed.
Note. —The Royal Agricultural Society will not hold another trial of Portable
Steam-engines and Threshing Machines until the year 1872.
CLAYTON & SHUTTLEWORTH would particularly direct the attention of the
Sheep Farmers of Victoria, to their Portable Steam Engine, combined with
APPOLH’S PATENT CENTRIFUGAL PUMP,
For Sheep Washing, Irrigation, Drainage and other purposes,
Manufactured by Messrs. EASTON, AMOS, & ANDERSON, London,
which, from its durability, simplicity of construction, easy working motion, and
continuous discharge of a steady stream without air vessels, forms a valuable
appliance for the purposes of irrigation generally, and may be successfully used
for draining low and fen lands, emptying of tanks, ponds, docks, &c. When not
required for raising water, the engine can readily be detached and used for driv-
ing saw benches, cotton gins, grinding mills, threshing machines, and applied to
other purposes for which steam power is generally required.
The Patent Centrifugal Appold Pump obtained the Council Medal of the
Great Exhibition of 1851, where, on trial, it was found to give a result equal to
nearly seventy per cent, of the power expended.—(Vide the Jury Reports.) Patent
registered in Victoria, December, 1868.
Prices and further particulars may be obtained by applying to the Agents for
Australia,
WILKIE, WELCH AND CO.,
who have also been appointed Australian Agents for Messrs. Clark & Co’s
CELEBRATED SELF-COILING REVOLVING STEEL SHUTTERS, and are
prepared to take orders for Shutters suited for all kinds of Windows, Doors,
Shop-fronts or openings. They have also a large stock of ordinary sizes of
Revolving Steel Shutters, with springs, and apparatus complete, which they can
