"One crowned hour of glorious life
Is worth an age without & name,"
Thrilling Story of
Australian Valor.
Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, one of the
corfcorres pondents permitted to accompany
the fleet to the Dardanelles,
was aboard a warship with five
hundred Australians, who formed
the covering party for the landing
at Gaba Tepe. He supplies a
thrilling account of the landing
operations.
_■ It .required,. splendid skill, organisa-
tion, and leadership to get the huge
Armada under weigh from. Mudros
Bay without accidents, ! The war-
ships and 1 transports . were divided
into ,/five . ; divisions. Never before
has an attempt been made to Jand
so large a force in the face of ■ a
well-prepared enemy. At 2 o'clock
on April; ,24 the flagship of the
division conveying: the Australasian's-
passed down - the long. line, of , slowly-
moving. transports, amid tremendous
cheering, being . played out of , the
bay .i?y the-, : French warships.' JAf,4
o'clock the ship's-, .company, and
troops .assembled,, to hear .the Ad-
miral's .proclamation to the , combined
forces. This,,, was. 1 followed by:; the
last, service before battle, ,in which
the chaplain uttered a jprayep for
victory. and; called a divine blessing
on the. .expedition, all .'standing with
.uncoyered. ■ and,/./bpwedp heads.
' RESTING 'FOUR THE ORDEAL..
. At' dusk.'..' all lights .were . put put;
and the troops rested;; ;f or the ordeal
at dawn. It was a''beautiful, calm
night, with a: '"bright: Eaif-moon, By
1 . O'clock, in the morning, .the ships
reached the -rendezvous;, 'five. 'Miles


from the landing-place, and the sol-
diers were aroused and served with
their last, .hot: meal. ■■ -■
The " Australians who were about to
go into action . for ..the..first time un-
der trying circumstances were cheer-
ful, quiet, and confident, . showing-
no -sign of nerves:or excitement. As
the moon, waned the boats were
swung out,\. the Australians received
their last instructions, and men
who six months ago were living
peaceful civilian ljy.es . began to dis-
embark on a strange, unknown
shore., in ahs.trafige land to" attack
an enemy of different, race..
Each boat was fin charge of a mid-
shipman, ahdj was: loaded with great
rapidity, iiV "absolute silence, and
without; a hitch;;.:. The ..covering, f,orce.
was towed ashore' by ships' pinnaces.
More of the Australians' brigade
were carried aboard the destroyers,
which were to go close, inshore as
soon as the covering force landed.
TENSE MOMENTS.
At 3 o'clock 1 Tit was-' quite, dirk,
and a start was ; made shorewards,
amid suppressed excitement; li: Would
the enemy, be surprised or on -the
alert ? i : ' v' : ''
At 4 o'clock- three; battleships," line
abreast and four cables apart I ,"' arriv-
ed 2500 yards from the shore,' 'with
their guns Planned ' and searchlights
made ready. Very ' slowly the boats
in tow, like - .twelve ' ; great snakes,
moved ashore. Each edged towards
each other in order to reach the
beach four cables apart. ' The battle-
ships moved slowly in " after them,'
until the water 'shallowed,;
Every eye-Was' Bxed"«©n' : the' grim
line of hills in front, mehaciiig in
the gloom, ' the mysteries ■of " which:
those in the'boats were; about?' to
solve. Not a' souhd 1 'was heard 'iibr 'a
light seen, and it appeared'-as' if the
enemy was surprised. -In .our nervy
state the stars 'often were mistaken
for lights ashore."' 1 :'.., ' 1"/;';
THE - -ALARM.
The progress of the ' boats'' was
slow, and dawn rapidlyT'waS" b-rekk-'


ing. At 4.50 the enemy showed an
alarm light, which flashed for ten
minutes and disappeared. Ihe boats
appeared almost on the beach, and
seven destroyers glided noiselessly
inshore. ■
At 4.53 came a sharp -burst of
rifle fire from the beach, The sound
relieved the ■ prolonged suspense,
which had become almost intolerable,
The fire lasted a few minutes, and
then a faint British cheer 'came over
the waters, telling that the first
position had been won. At 3.3 the
fire was intensified, and by the
sound we could tell our men were
firing. The firing lasted _ twenty,-
five minutes, and then died some-
what.
The boats returned, and a pinnace
came alongside with two recumbent
figures on deck and a small_ midship-
man cheerfully waving his hand,
with a shot through his stomach.
Three wounded in the first burst of
musketry.
A TERRIBLE FUSILADE.
' The boats had almost reached the
shore when a party of Turks en-
trenched ashore _ opened a ' terrific
fusillade with rifles and a_ Maxim.
Fortunately most of the bullets went
high. The Australians rose the
occasion. They did not wait, for
orders- or for the boats to . reach the
.beach, but s-prang into the sea, form-
ed a sort of .rough line, and rushed
the enemy's- trenches. Their maga-
zines were uncharged., so they just
went in with cold steel It was over
in a minute. The Turks in the
first trench either were bayoneted or
ran away, and the Maxim was cap-
tured.
Then the Australians found them-
selves facing an almost perpendicu-
lar cliff of loose- sandstones, cover-
ed with thick shrubbery. Some-
where about half-way up the enemy
had a second "trench, strongly held,
from which poured a terrific fire- on
the troops below and . .the boats
pulled, back to the destroyers for a
second landing party.


A TOUGH PROPOSITION.
Here _ was a tough proposition to
tackle in the darkness, but . those
colonials .were practical above all
else, and went about it in a practical
way. They stopped a few minutes
to pull themselves together, get rid
of their packs, and charge their rifle
magazines. Then this race of ath-
letes proceeded to scale the cliff
without responding to the enemy's
fire. They lost some men, but didn't
worry, and in less than a quarter
of an hour the Turks were. out of
their second position, and either
bayoneted or fleeing,
As daylight came it was seen that
the landing had been effected rather
further north of Gaba Tepe than
originally was intended, at a point
where the cliffs rise very sheer. The
error was a blessing in disguise, be-
cause there was no glacis . down
which the enemy could fire, and the
broken ground afforded good ..cover
for troops once they .had passed the
forty yards of flat beach. '
The country in the vicinity of the
landing is formidable and for-
bidding. To the sea it presents a
steep front, broken into innumerable
ridges, bluffs, valleys, and sand-
Rising to a height of several
hundred feet the surface is bare,
crumbly sandstone, with thick
shrubbery about six feet in height,
which is ideal for snipers, as the Aus-
tralasians soon found to their cost.
On the other hand, the Australasians
proved themselves adepts at this kind
of warfare.
CASUALTIES IN BOATS.
In the early part of the day heavy
casualties were suffered in ' the
boats conveying l troops from the de-
stroyers, tugs, and transports. The
enemy's sharpshooters, hidden every-
where, concentrated their fire on
the boats. When close in, at' least
three boats broke away from their
tow and drifted down, the' coast
without control, being sniped at the
whole way, and steadily losing men.
The work of disembarking' ; pro-


c ceded mechanically under a point-
blank fire. The moment the boats
touched the beach the troops jumped
ashore and doubled for cover; but
the gallant boats crews had to pull
in and out under a galling fire
from hundreds of points.
All through the 25th this went
on, the boats landing troops, ammu-
nition and stores. When it was day-
light the warships endeavored to
support them by heavy fire from
-secondary, armaments; but not know-
ing the enemy's position this support
was more moral than real.
SPLENDIDLY CARRIED OUT.
When the sun had fully risen we
could see that the Australasians had
actually established themselves on
the ridge, and were trying to work
their way northward along it. The
fighting was so confused and oc-
curred on such broken ground that
it was difficult to follow exactly what
happened on the 25th; but the cover-
ing florce's task was so splendidly
carried out that it allowed the dis-
embarkation of the remainder to pro-
ceed uninterruptedly, except for the
never-ceasing sniping. But then the
Australasians, whose blood was up,
instead of entrenching, rushed
northwards and eastwards, search-
ing for fresh enemies to bayonet.
It was difficult country in which to
entrench. They therefore preferred
to advance.
AUSTRALASIANS -IN TROUBLE.
The Turks had only a weak force
actually holding the beach, and had
relied on the difficult ground and
their snipers to delay the' advance un-
■ til reinforcements came. ' Some of
the Australasians who pushed inland
were counter-attacked and almost
outflanked by oncoming reserves.
They had to fall back after suffering
heavy, losses.
The Turks continued to counter-
attack the whole afternoon; but the
Australasians- did not yield a foot on
the main ridge. Reinforcements
poured up from the beach, but the


Turks enfiladed the beach, with two
field guns from Gaba Tepe. This
shrapnel fire was incessant and
deadly. The warships vainly foj
some hours- tried to silence them.
The majority of the heavy caual-
ties during the day were from
shrapnel,' which swept the beach and
ridge where the Australasians were
established. Later in the day guns
were silenced or forced to withdraw,
and a -cruiser moving close inshore
plastered Gaba Tepe with a hail of
shell.
PRESSURE BY ENEMY.
Towards dusk the attacks became
more vigorous, the enemy being
supported by powerful artillery in-
land, which the ships' guns were
powerless to deal with. The press-
ure on the Australasians became
heavier, and their line had to be
contracted.
General Birdwood and his staff
landed in the afternoon and devoted
their energies to securing ■ the posi-
tion so as to hold firm until next
morning, when they hoped to get
field guns into position.
Some idea of the difficulty can be
gathered when it is remembered
that every round of ammunition and
all the water and stores had to be
landed on a narrow beach' and car-
ried up pathless, hills, through a val-
ley several hundred feet high, to the
firing line. The whole 'mass of
troops was concentrated in a very
small area, and was unable to re-
ply,: though exposed to relentless
and- incessant - shrapnel fire, which
i swept every yard of ■ the ground.
■Fortunately-much of -it was, badly
aimed, and burst too high.
HEROISM OF WOUNDED.
A 'serious problem was the getting
of the wounded from the shore. All
those unable to hobble had to be
carried from the hills on a stretcher,
and; then hastily dressed, and carried
to. : the. boats. Boat parties worked
.unceasingly the entire 'day and
night. '


The courage displayed by these
wounded Australasians will never be
forgotten. Hastily placed in trawl-
ers and lighters'; boats, they were
towed to the ships. In spite of their
sufferings they cheered the ship
from which they had set out in the
morning. In fact, I have never seen
anything like these wounded Austral-
ians in war before.
Though many were shot to bits,
without hope of recovery, their
cheers resounded throughout the
night. You could see in the midst
of the mass of suffering humanity
arms, waving in greeting to the
crews of the warships. They were
happy because they knew they had
been tried for the first time, and had
not been wanting.
A WHORTY FEAT.
For fifteen,; mortal hours they occu-
pied ■ The "'heights.' under incessant
shell fire, without the moral or ma-
terial support of ' a single gun
ashore/and subjected the whole time
to a violent counter-attack by : a
brave enemy, skilfully led,- with sni-
pers deliberately picking off every
officer; twho endeavored to give a
commdhdTbf lead the . men.
There has been no finer feat in
this war than this sudden landing
in the dark and the storming of the
heights, and, above all, the holding
on whilst reinforcements were land-
ing. These raw colonial troops in
these desperate hours proved worthy
to fight side by side with the heroes
of MOBS,- the Aisne, Ypres, and
Neuve Chapelle.
"For veiled lies the future,
And beneath the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadow
Keeping watch above His own."
