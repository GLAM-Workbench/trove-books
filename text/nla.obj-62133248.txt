NARRATIVE,
%C,
On Tuesday October 21st, 1823, Mr. Oxley,
Lieutenant Stirling of the Buffs, and I, embarked
on board the colonial cutter Mermaid (Charles
? _
Penson, master), about noon, and proceeded down
the harbour; but the wind proving unfavourable,
we came to under Point Piper, where we remained
till the next day at midnight, when a moderate
breeze springing up we got under way and ran
out of the harbour. Early on the morning of the
25th we came to an anchor off Port Macquarie,
distant north from Sydney 175 miles. This place
had been settled about two years before, as a penal
establishment; but the excellence of the soil, the
fineness of the climate, and its convenient distance
from Sydney, made Government anxious to throw
it open to free settlers, in case we should be suc-
cessful in the object of our expedition.

Messrs. Oxley, Stirling, and myself, immediately
went ashore, the sickness endured by the two former
making them very anxious to leave the vessel.

The line of coast before us was very beautiful,
consisting of a succession of small headlands
richly clothed with wood; while the darkness of
the foliage was pleasingly relieved by the verdure

About a mile to the north lay the entrance of
the river Hastings, beyond which was a long sandy
beach extending six or seven miles, and terminated
by a bold headland called Point Ploraer. Across
* ?
the entrance of the river is a sandy bar with about
eleven feet at low water. With the wind at S.E.
there are heavy rollers on it, making the approach
to the town difficult and dangerous. We landed
on the rocks to the south of the entrance, and
found Captain Allman, the commandant, awaiting
our arrival, with Lieutenants Wilson and Roberts,
and Assistant-surgeon Fenton, all of the 48th regi-
ment. They conducted us to Government House,
where we breakfasted, and then walked out to see
the place, accompanied by Captain Allman.

Considering that the site on which the town
now stands was two years ago covered with im-
mense forest trees, and thick brush-wood, it is
f
quite incredible to what a state of perfection the
place has been brought by the indefatigable ac-
tivity of the commandant.
The Government House stands nearly in the
centre of the town, on a handsome esplanade, open
to the sea. To the northward, on a rising ground,
which commands the whole town, are the military
barracks, calculated to hold 150 men, each of the
married men having a small cottage and garden.
On the right of the hill are two handsome cottages,
which are used as officers? quarters. The remainder
of the town, which is extremely clean, is entirely
{
occupied by the prisoners, who are kept as distinct
as possible from the military, and who have each
a small but neat hut, constructed of split-wood,
lathed, plastered and white-washed, with a garden
attached. The sites of the streets, intended to be
built as the population of the town increases, are
regularly laid out and fenced: the spaces between
them are at present occupied as gardens and planta-

tions of maize, sugar-cane, &c. the latter of which
�
appears to thrive remarkably well, and will (I
doubt not) at some future period form a lucra-
tive article of export from this establishment. We
dined at the Government House, and a few of us
walking down to the beach after dinner, were
highly amused by a dance among the natives.
These people are a much finer race than those in
the neighbourhood of Sydney, many of them being
upwards of six feet high. Their features are also
more expressive of intellect, and their limbs better
formed than any I had before seen. Some of the
more civilized are victualled from the king?s store
of the settlement, and, in return, perform some of
the duties of constable, in a more efficient manner
than any European possibly could. Whenever
(as frequently happens) any of the prisoners at-
tempt to escape into the woods, they are instantly
pursued by some of this black police, who possess
a wonderful facility in tracing them; and being
furnished with fire-arms, they seldom fail to bring
them back alive or dead, for which they are re-
warded with blankets, spirits, &c.?but should the

runaways even escape the black police, they are i

almost sure to perish by hunger or the hostility |
of the other Indians. ' I

Having spent another day very pleasantly with I
Captain Allman and his officers, we left Port
Macquarie with much regret, having been enter-
.
tained there in a style which was far superior to
I . : ill
any thing we could have expected in so recent an

establishment, and which could only be exceeded
li
by the extreme kindness and polite hospitality of
every officer connected with the settlement.

We met the boat at the rocks where we had
landed, and with some little difficulty, on account
of the surf, reached the cutter at two o?clock on
Monday, 27th October. The wind being fair, we
immediately got under way, and continued our
course to the northward till Friday afternoon,
when it shifted, and came on to blow so hard, that
- **
we determined to run in shore and look out for
anchorage; this we found under the lee of a small
island off Point Danger (so named by Captain Cook),
about a mile from the land. While running down
for this place, we perceived the mouth of a large
river about a mile and a half to the northward;

and next morning at daylight the master was
despatched in the whale-boat to ascertain the pos-
sibility of taking the vessel into it. Shortly after-
wards, Mr. Stirling and I landed on the island with
our guns. The rock which formed the base was
evidently of volcanic origin: it was of a dark co-
lour, full of small holes and extremely hard, while
on the western side were many regular circular
cavities, some of which were about four or five
yards in diameter at top, and tapered down gra-
dually towards the bottom, which was usually
filled with round stones. One of these holes, in
particular, had a communication underneath with
the sea, and at every returning surf threw up
considerable quantities of water with a loud noise.
The superincumbent rocks were basaltic, and those
of a small rock to the N.W. of the island, as well
as those of a bluff headland, immediately opposite
on the main, were inferior only in extent to the
Giant?s Causeway in the north of Ireland. In
ascending to the top of the island, we sank nearly
knee-deep at every step in the bird-holes that un-
, t
dermined the surface. The inhabitants of these
subterraneous dwellings were sooty peterels, mut-

ton-birds and red-bills, the last very good eating.
We shot many of them, as the young ones were
full fledged and got up in numbers round us, when
disturbed by our falling into their holes. On the
top of the island we were surprised to see some
hundred pelicans seated quietly near their young,
who, with the eggs, covered a considerable space.
They did not appear at all intimidated, although
they must have heard the reports of our guns se-
f
veral times. However, on our giving them a volley,
which they did not seem to care more for than if
it came from pop-guns, they slowly took flight,
screaming frightfully. These birds were at least
five feet high, and from the peculiar formation of
the bill, the effect of such a multitude, drawn up
as if in regular order, was very singular. Having
taken a few of the young ones and eggs, we were
proceeding to the place where we landed, when we
observed what appeared to be part of a wreck on
the N.W. point of the island. We immediately
* .
proceeded towards it, not without expressing a

hope that it might prove the vessel of that unfor-
tunate and universally lamented navigator, La
Perouse, who is generally supposed to have per-

ished somewhere in these latitudes, having never
been heard of since he left Port Jackson in the
year 1789. It appeared to be the larboard quarter,
with part of the stern and quarter-deck of a vessel
of at least three hundred tons. The plank, which
was of oak, was not yet totally destroyed. Though
? V
we formed a variety of ingenious conjectures on the
subject, w� could find nothing about the wreck by
which we could at all determine what she had
been. We then returned on board, where we

found the master had arrived before us: he re-
ported that he had examined the entrance and
found two fathoms on the bar at low water, with
deep water and secure anchorage further in. As
the river appeared to run from the southward, and
parallel with the shore for some distance, it was
r
agreed that the mate should go after breakfast
*
with a boat into the river, until opposite to where
the vessel lay, when we were to join him by land
and proceed to the examination of the upper part
of the river. In the mean time Mr. Oxley and I
landed again on the island, to take an observation
and examine the wreck more closely; but nothing
further was discovered by which we could in any

way identify her. We however picked up a piece
of slate with part of a name deeply scratched on it,
? \
and also part of a case of mathematical instruments.
Mr. Oxley then ascended the hill, while I walked
towards the S.E. end of the island, accompanied
by a native black of the name of Bowen, whom
we had brought from Sydney. After spending
some time in sauntering about, during which I
found a quantity of fine sponge, and a large patch
of excellent rock spinach, of which I took a great
bundle on board, on approaching a small reef at
the S.E. end of the island, I observed, to my great
satisfaction, upwards of a dozen large turtles lying
asleep on a small beach: I instantly despatched
Bowen for assistance, and on Mr. Penson, the
master?s coming up, we were fortunate enough to
secure seven, some of which were very large, two
of them weighing above four cwt. The largest
\
was so very unwieldy that we were obliged to cut
its throat on the spot, otherwise we should not
have been able to have brought it on board at all.
Mr. Oxley and I then returned to the ship, and,
after taking some refreshment, landed on the main,
to proceed with the examination of the river; the

part of it where we found the boat extended over
a large flat, being in many places above a mile
broad, interspersed with numerous low mangrove
islands, and very shallow, except in the channel,
where we found from nine to two fathoms water.
The country on either side was very hilly, and
richly wooded, and the view altogether beautiful
beyond description. Having wandered out of the
channel, we with some difficulty proceeded about
f
four miles, when the river assumed a different ap-
pearance, being contracted to a quarter of a mile
in width, with five fathoms water all across: the
banks also wore a different aspect, being free from
mangroves: the soil seemed rich, and the timber
evidently improved in size and quality. The
scenery here exceeded any thing I had previously
seen in Australia ?extending for miles along a
deep rich valley, clothed with magnificent trees,
the beautiful uniformity of which was only inter-
rupted by the turns and windings of the river,
which here and there appeared like small lakes,
while in the back ground, Mount Warning (the
highest land in New South Wales) reared its bar-
ren and singularly shaped peak, forming a striking

contrast with the richness of the intermediate
country.
On the right bank of the river were standing
one man and several women and children, all per-
fectly naked. They did not appear so timid as
the Indians usually are, but remained quietly while
we landed to search for fresh water, the river being
still brackish. The man was curiously scarified all
over the body, the flesh being raised as thick as my
finger all over his breasts. He talked very loudly
for some time, using much gesticulation, and fre-
quently pointing to the other side of the river,
where we had observed a number of native huts.
We could not however obtain from him any in-
formation with regard to the object of our search;
so after giving him some biscuit, which he tasted
and instantly spat out again, we left him, and as
it was now late, proceeded towards the vessel, re-
solving the next day to return and follow the river
as far as circumstances would allow. We saw no
weapons of any description among these people,
with the exception of a stone hatchet hanging at
the back of one of the women, which was of wretch-
edly rude formation. It was now agreed that the

mate and crew should remain with the boat in the
river, where we had joined them, all night, and
that Mr. Oxley and I should return on board to
sleep, and come back with Mr. Stirling at daylight.
However, just as we were preparing to land, the
wind suddenly shifted to the S.W.; and as it
seemed likely to continue steady in that point,
Mr. Oxley thought it imprudent to lose the advan-
tage of it, and therefore deferred exploring the
river further till our return. The signal was ac-
cordingly made for the boat to return on board,
i
and all hands were employed in getting the vessel
under way. In the mean time a number of natives,
amounting to about 200, collected on the shore
opposite the vessel, and we could perceive with the
glass that they had all spears. They continued
quietly watching us till they saw the square-sail
hoisted and the vessel under way, when they set
up a loud shout, and continued dancing and shout-
ing while we were within hearing. The little
island under which we lay received the name of
Turtle Island, in gratitude for the abundant supply
of that fish which we procured from it. We also
gave the name of the ? Tweed? to the river. The

latitude of our anchorage is 28� 8' S. and its longi-
tude 153� 31' 30" E.
The night we left Turtle Island we experienced
a very severe gale, but as it was in our favour, it
did not much annoy us; and when it ceased, the
next day, it fell quite calm, and the sea appeared
perfectly alive with fish. The bonitas, skip-jacks,
and other fish, were leaping in every direction as
far as the eye could reach, while immediately
round the vessel were several large sharks, but we
were not fortunate enough to catch any.
The next day, Thursday, November 6th, at noon,
we came to an anchor in Fort Curtis, inside Gat-
combe Head. Mr. Oxley immediately went away
with the master in the long boat to sound, while
Mr. Stirling and I went ashore at Facing Island
in search of fresh water, from the want of which
we had suffered severely during the last week, as
all our water casks were old rum and wine casks,
which, not having been properly washed out, had
tainted all the water, so as to make it totally unfit
for use; we found water in small quantities in a
little glen, opposite the vessel, but unfortunately
it was not well tasted; however, as no other could

be procured, the casks were sent ashore to be filled
with it.
As the weather was intensely hot (the thermo-
meter standing night and day at between 85� and
95� in the cabin), we ventured to bathe in defiance
of sharks, and then returned on board to an early
dinner, after which, at three o?clock, Mr, Oxley,
Mr. Stirling, and myself, quitted the vessel with
two boats, taking with us three days? provisions.

Captain Flinders had visited this port in 1801,
but was not able, from want of time, to examine
it closely, which was the reason of our present
visit to it. We directed our course to South
Shore Point*, about six miles from the vessel, but
found the mangroves so thick as to render our
landing extremely difficult: we therefore steered
?
for a sandy beach about two miles farther on,
where, as it was low water, we landed at about
six o?clock with some difficulty, and immediately
pitched our tent and kindled a fire, the men
making a comfortable little hut for themselves
with the boat-sails, &c.
At daybreak next morning we were all stirring,

having been persecuted all night by musquitoes
and sand-flies; and, after breakfast, at about six
o?clock, we started across the country, leaving a
corporal and three men in charge of the tents.
The direction we took was about S.S.E. by com-
pass, and the country we passed over the most un-
promising I ever saw, being a succession of very
steep hills, barren, and covered with sharp loose
quartz stones; the only vegetable production being

enough to shoot them; and, after a most fatiguing
march of about six hours, in which time we had hardly
advanced twelve miles in a direct line, we stopped
on the bank of a small rivulet, which, with another
hardly equal to it in size, constituted all the fresh
water we met with. In the course of our walk, we
did not see a single native, nor were there any
marks of their having lately been there. Near
the river we found a grave at the foot of a large
tree, the bark of which had been stripped off about
six feet in height all round, and the wood deeply

print left on soft ground by the foot of the kan-
garoo, the emu, and other animals. This was
doubtless the grave of some great hunter.
After resting about an hour, we returned by the
same track, one of the men having marked the
trees with an axe as we proceeded; and at half-
past five o?clock we reached the tents, the whole
\
party completely exhausted. Indeed, the extreme
heat of the weather and the ruggedness of our
road made it certainly as bad as a walk of forty
miles in England.
The next day about ten o?clock we started in
the boat to discover the mouths of the rivulets we
had passed the day before, and after rowing about
two miles, we came to the mouth of a creek, up
which we proceeded about six miles, when we
found fresh water, but in so small a quantity as
to be totally useless for the purposes of coloniza-
tion. We then returned to our tent, where we
s
spent another uncomfortable night, and next day
struck our encampment and returned to the ship.
On our arrival on board, the master reported that
he had discovered a fine fresh water river, empty-
ing itself by an outlet, which was visible astern of

the vessel to the southward. From his account,
Mr. Oxley was induced to defer our departure to
Port Bowen another day, in order to have an op-
portunity of viewing it himself. Accordingly Mr.
Stirling and he started early the next day, while
1
I remained behind to collect specimens of minerals
on Facing Island for the governor. Late in the
evening they returned, having proceeded up the
river to above where the tide reached; and Mr.
Oxley deemed it of sufficient consequence to re-
main three or four days more, in order to examine
the country more minutely. Accordingly, the
next morning early we again left the vessel, taking
three days? provision, and proceeded with one boat
about twelve miles up the river, when we pitched
our tent on a bank about forty feet above the level
of the water. The soil here was of the richest de-
scription, and calculated to grow cotton, sugar,
indigo, and all other Indian productions. There
were however marks of the flood having reached at
least 15 feet higher than the level of our encamp-
ment, owing to which the whole surface was co-
vered about two inches deep with drift sand. In-
i
deed the floods here, in the rainy season, must be

tremendous, as we observed in many of the trees,
at least sixty feet above the level of the water, the
wrack which had been deposited by successive
inundations. On the banks we saw three or four
different kinds of timber; but the small quantity
rendered them unimportant. The river was co-
vered with multitudes of teals, widgeons, and wild
ducks; and on the banks I shot two swamp pheasants
(a pretty black bird not unlike the English phea-
sant in shape % ), a very beautiful species of small
dove, not known at Sydney, and a kind of owl that
none of us had seen before. Shortly after dinner
we prepared to go to rest, with an intention of
proceeding further up the river at a very early
hour the next morning. But unfortunately rest
was entirely out of the question. Soon after dark
our tent was filled with musquitoes of a larger size
than we had before seen: their noise alone would
have been sufficient to banish sleep, but their sting
was intolerable. In spite of all the precautions we
could take, by covering ourselves completely with
our cloaks, and every thing else we could lay hold
of, although the thermometer stood at 94� all night

in the tent, these little tormentors continued to
persecute us in the most unrelenting manner till
morning. We turned out the moment it was light,
and went down to the river to bathe. Here we
found the sandflies to the full as troublesome as
the musquitoes; and seeing that our only remedy
was to leave the place as soon as possible, we de-
spatched our breakfast, and getting into the boat,
proceeded about six miles further up the river.
Not having seen any natives since our first en-
trance into Port Curtis, we did not think it ne-
cessary to place a guard over the tents, which we
left standing, intending to return and pass another
night in the same place. The country through
which we passed this day was similar to what we
had seen the day before. The timber was however
becoming larger and more plentiful. In many
places, the right bank of the river was composed
of a remarkably fine slate, while the left was a hard
close-grained gray granite, and the soil every where
rich and fertile. Before we returned we ascended
a high hill on the left, from which we had a beau-
tiful and extensive view of the river for many miles,
through a rich brush country, the banks in many

On arriving at the mouth of the river, we found
it wanted about an hour and a half to low water;
and as Mr. Oxley wished to see the bar at the
entrance at that time, we landed and kindled a
fire for the purpose of dressing our dinner; after
which we once more embarked, and reached the
vessel at about half-past four o?clock.

parts well clothed with timber. A very lofty range
#
of hills formed a tine termination to the scene. On
our return we were fortunate enough to shoot a
brace of wild ducks, and catch a good dish of
perch, with which, and many other descriptions of
fish, this beautiful river abounds. We also saw
several fresh-water tortoises.
It had originally been our intention to remain
another day in this neighbourhood, for the purpose
of examining the country at a little distance on
either side of the river; but the torment we suf-
fered from the musquitoes was such, that we re-
solved to return to the vessel the next morning.
Accordingly, after spending another most wretched
night, we struck our tent, and proceeded down the

Curtis as soon as we returned from the examina-
tion of the river, Mr. Penson sent the mate that
morning to sound the channel at the entrance;
and his not returning at night caused a consider-
able degree of anxiety on board, especially as there
was a dangerous reef to the northward, about a
mile and a half distant, among the breakers of
which we feared he might have gotten. However,
about half-past three o?clock on the following
i 4
afternoon, he made his appearance, having been
down the coast about twelve miles to the S.E.,
*
where he had discovered a large harbour, of which
he gave such an account, as determined Mr. Oxley
to abandon altogether the idea of going to Port
Bowen, which, on account of the prevalence" of
4
northerly winds in this quarter, would have con-
sumed more time than we could well spare; be-
sides which, the increasing heat of the weather
made us gladly avail ourselves of an excuse for
not proceeding any farther to the northward.
To the river which we discovered here Mr.
Oxley gave the name of the Boyne; but from the
excessive floods to which it is subject, I fear it can

never be turned to account for the purposes of
colonization.
The next morning (Saturday, Nov. 15th) we
got under way, and stood out of Port Curtis.
We found considerable difficulty in getting out,
from the number of sand-shoals which lie across
�
its entrance, and which have never been properly
surveyed. They are apparently formed by the
tremendous torrents which periodically descend
J'- r l
down the Boyne river, from the range of moun-
tains at the foot of which it flows. However, we
at length found the channel, which, though narrow,
will be sufficient for all the purposes of navigation,
when thoroughly known and buoyed. It carries
' . \
from five to seven fathoms all the way in.
? ? i
We now stood away to the S.E. for the port
/
above-mentioned as having been seen by the mate;
and having entered it by a channel about half a
mile wide lying between two sand-shoals, we came
to an anchor at four o?clock P.M. in five fathoms
water, in a place perfectly land-locked, and shel-
*' f
tered from every wind. The next morning Messrs.
Oxley and Stirling went in a whale-boat to the

entrance of the port, to take angles for the purpose
of laying down a chart; while I set off, accompanied
by Mr. Penson, to discover, if possible, whether any
fresh water fell into the harbour. We were not,
however, successful; and after spending four hours
in examining the different creeks, all of which
ended in mangrove swamps, we returned to the
vessel without having been able to procure a drink
of fresh water. In all parts of the harbour, we
saw a great many green and black snakes playing
about in the water, while the number and bold-
ness of the sharks exceeded credibility. They
1
were continually striking at the oars, and one large
one very nearly pulled the steer-oar out of Mr.
Penson?s hand.
In the course of the day I shot a very beautiful
i
and uncommon kind of duck, which some of our
crew had before seen in New Zealand, where it has
the name of the Paradise Duck. The head and
neck were white, the bill red, the back a glossy
dark green, and the wings regularly striped with
v
blue, yellow, green, and white. Its flesh, however,
was dry, and very fishy.
On our return, the mate had discovered a large

pond of fresh water, about half a mile below where
the vessel was lying: and as all the water we had
on board was quite unfit for use, we resolved to
/
start it, and fill the casks at the above-mentioned
pond.
The following day was spent in watering, while
the master went in the small whale-boat to sound
/
the passage, and the next morning, the water
being completed, we got under way at high tide,
and stood out of the harbour. At ten o?clock we
anchored in the road on the edge of the S.E. bank
in three and a half fathoms water: the boats were
immediately sent away to sound. Messrs. Oxley
and Stirling went on shore to take observations,
while I went out shooting, but without success,
the only birds I saw being crows. The next day
it blew very fresh, and the people were employed
getting firewood, while the sounding went on as
before. The latitude of this harbour, by observa-
tion, is 23�59f'5., and its longitude by chronometer
151� 34' 45" E. It had been called Rodd?s Bay by
Captain King.
The next morning (Friday, Nov. 21st) we
weighed anchor at eight o?clock A.M., and ran

out of the road with a moderate breeze at S.S.E.,
and continued working to the eastward till the
Sunday afternoon, when at six P.M., the water
suddenly shoaling to four fathoms and a half, we
came to an anchor for the night. Next morning
at six o?clock we weighed and stood to the N.E.,
and at half past nine the water had the appearance
%
of being shoal a-head, and all round; we therefore
hove to, and sent the boat to sound. It proved to
be a reef of rocks of considerable extent, running
out from Break Sea Spit, to the N. by W. The
least water found on it by the boat was two feet
, ? V
and a half. We then bore away N. by W., and
crossed the reef in five fathoms and a quarter.
Towards evening it commenced raining and blow-
ing extremely hard from S. by W. We treble-
reefed the mainsail, which was notwithstanding
shortly afterwards split, and nearly blown to pieces
/
before we could furl it. We then set the trysail
and spit-fire jib, and lay to till Saturday morning
(Nov. 29th), the sea running tremendously high,
V
and the cutter labouring very much, and making
so much water, that we were obliged to pump her
every hour. After continuing to blow thus for six

days, the wind fell, and on the Saturday at noon,
having gotten an observation, we found that the
i
current, which here sets to the south, had, not-
withstanding the storm, drifted us nearly twenty
miles per day to windward, so that at six o?clock
P.M. we came to an anchor in Pumice-stone River,
* V
Moreton Bay, within 150 yards of the shore, in
the very place where Captain Flinders had anchored
twenty-two years before, on discovering the har-
bour, which, I believe, has not been since visited
by Europeans. Scarcely was the anchor let go,
when we perceived a number of natives, at the di-
stance of about a mile, advancing rapidly towards
the vessel; and on looking at them with the glass
from the mast-head, I observed one who appeared
much larger than the rest, and of a lighter colour,
being a light copper, while all the others were
black. This I pointed out to Mr. Stirling, so that
we were all on the look-out when they approached;
and to our surprise and satisfaction, when opposite
the vessel, the man hailed us in English. The
boat was immediately launched, and Messrs. Oxley,
Stirling, and I, went ashore in her. While ap-
proaching the beach, the natives showed many

signs of joy, dancing and embracing the white
man, who was nearly as wild as they. He was
perfectly naked, and covered all over with white
i
and red paint, which the natives make use of.
, t
His name, it appeared, was Thomas Pamphlet.
*
He had left Sydney on the 511 st March last, in an
?
open boat, to bring cedar from the Five Islands,
about fifty miles to the S. of Port Jackson. There
� ? �'?
were three others with him, but the boat being
driven out to sea by a gale of wind, they had
suffered inconceivable hardships, being twenty-one

days without water, during which time one of
them died of thirst; and they had at length been
wrecked on Moreton Island, which forms one side
i
of Moreton Bay, in the upper part of which we
were now lying. He was so bewildered with joy
that we could make very little out of his story that
night; so having distributed a few knives, hand-
kerchiefs, &c. among the friendly blacks, we re-
turned on board, taking him with us. He now
informed us that his two surviving companions,
Richard Parsons and John Finnegan, after having
travelled in company with him to the place where
we found him, had, about six weeks before, re-

solved to prosecute their way towards Sydney;
that he had accompanied them about fifty miles,
but his feet becoming so sore that he was unable
to travel further, he had resolved to return to the
blacks, with whom we found him, and who had
before treated him with great kindness; that a
few days after they parted, Parsons and Finnegan
having quarrelled, the latter also returned, and
had since remained with him, but had been absent
? the last fortnight with the chief of the tribe on
a hunting expedition; and that Parsons had not
been heard of since his departure. Mr. Oxley, on
hearing that Finnegan was gone towards the south
end of the bay, resolved to seek him on Monday
morning, and hoped by keeping along the shore,
and occasionally firing a musket, to be able to find
him also. But on Sunday afternoon, at low water,
a man was observed walking out on a sand-bank
from the opposite shore towards us, and holding
in his hand a long stick with a skin on it; upon
which I took the whale-boat and pulled towards
him, when it proved to be Finnegan. Both he
and Pamphlet concurring in a story they told us
of a large river, which they had crossed, falling

into the south end of the bay, Messrs. Oxley and
i
Stirling started next morning in the whale-boat,
taking Finnegan with them, and four days? pro-
visions, in order to explore it. I remained behind
to shoot rare birds ; and this gave me an oppor-
tunity of becoming acquainted with the natives,
who are both in their dispositions and manners
far superior to those in the neighbourhood of
*
Sydney, and indeed to any that I had yet seen.
The principal station of the tribe, with whom
we found these poor men, was about two miles
higher up the Pumice-stone River (so called by
Captain Flinders, from the immense quantities of
that substance found on its banks) than where
the vessel lay; but as they depend principally on
fish for their support, they have several huts, at a
distance of three or four miles from each other, to
which they migrate from time to time as the fish
become scarce. Their huts are built of long slender
wattles, both ends of which are stuck into the
ground, so as to form an arch about three feet and a
half or four feet high. These are strongly inter-
woven with rude wicker-work, and the whole is

covered with tea-tree (melaleuca armillaris) bark,

in such a manner as to be quite impervious to the
rain: thus forming a spacious and commodious hut,
(
capable of containing from ten to twelve people.
In their journeys the women are obliged to carry
heavy burthens, consisting of whatever rude utensils
they may possess, together with a large quantity
of fern-root, which forms a part of their daily food,
and not unfrequently two or three children besides.
The men carry nothing but a spear, and perhaps
a fire-stick; and their only employment consists
in catching fish; this they do very expertly with
i *
a kind of hoop-net, which they use in the follow-
ing manner: They go out in equal parties of four,
six, or eight, each man having two nets. They
then walk along the beach till they perceive the
fish near the shore, which (from constant practice)
they are enabled to do at a depth of four or five
feet. As soon as this takes place, a little boy,
who accompanies each party, creeps towards the
water on his hands and knees; the party then
divide, forming two lines, one on each side of the
boy, at a distance of two or three yards, and as
soon as the fish are sufficiently near, the boy

distract their attention, when the men instantly
rush into the water, forming a semicircle round
the fish, each man standing between his two nets,
which he then draws close together. In this
manner they are seldom unsuccessful, and fre-
quently catch more than they can consume. As
they never travel without fire, the moment the fish
are out of the water, they commence roasting and
eating them, which they do without cleaning or
any other preparation; and when they have satis-
fied themselves, should any remain, they carry
them home for their women and children, who
have been employed during the day in procuring
fern-root, which they call dlngowa , and a part of
which they give the men in exchange for fish.
When Pamphlet arrived among them, they had

slowly ventured back, and carefully covered the
> * V*
place where the water was spilt with sand. During
the whole of our countrymen?s stay among them,
they were never reconciled to this operation of
boiling.
The women weave a strong neat kind of net
with rushes; with one or two of these each native
is furnished to carry fish, dingowa, or any thing else
they may pick up. The nets used for fishing are
made by the men from the bark of the kurrajong
(hibiscus heterophyllus), a shrub which is very
common in the swamps. It is difficult at first
'V
sight to distinguish them from nets made of
hemp. They have also nets of a much larger size,
which they use in taking the kangaroo.
Both sexes go perfectly naked; nor are the
females at all abashed at appearing in that state
before a stranger. They do not seem to have any
ornaments, though they were much gratified with
strips of red cloth and bunting, with which we
decorated their heads; and some of the scarlet
tail-feathers of a black cockatoo, which I gave
them, had nearly produced a quarrel among them.
Several articles of clothing were also given them, but

they were invariably taken off and hidden as soon
* -
as they arrived at their camp; nor did we see ever
I
any article again after they once became possessed
of it.
Each individual of this tribe above the age of six
years had the cartilage of the nose perforated, and
many of them (especially the children) wore large
pieces of stick or bone thrust through it, in such
a manner as completely to stop the nostrils. This
operation is always performed by the same person,
whose office is hereditary, and confers some privi-
leges, such as receiving fish, &c. from the others.
It was held in this tribe by a fine intelligent young
man, who was called the Doctor by our men. His
father held a similar situation in another tribe on
the south side of the river.

These tribes are distinguished from each other
by the different colours they use in painting their
bodies. Those on the north side blacken themselves
all over with charcoal and bees? wax, which, with
wild honey, they procure in abundance; and those
on the south side paint themselves with a sort of
*
red jaspar, which they burn and reduce to a powder.
Other tribes make use of a white pigment, with

which (having previously blackened themselves)
they daub various parts of their body. Their chief
appeared to possess an unlimited authority over
them; he was a tall, middle-aged man, with an
intelligent countenance. He had two wives, which
/
\
(though it sometimes occurs) does not seem to be
common among them. However, only one of them
lived with him as a wife; the other was employed,
while he ate or slept, in going among the other
huts and collecting from their inhabitants fish,
fern-root, &c.?a tribute which was daily paid to
him without murmuring, although the rest of the
tribe in consequence occasionally fell short them-
selves. The chief possesses nets both for fish
and kangaroo, but seldom uses them except for
his amusement. Neither does his head wife ever
j
go out to gather fern-root with the rest of the
women. 'The same practice of scarifying them-
selves with sharp shells prevails here, as at Sydney;
but most of these Indians were cut more deeply,
and all with great regularity. The women here,
as at Sydney, all lose the first two joints of the
little finger of the left hand; but the men do not
extract a front tooth on their approach to puberty.

as is invariably the case in the vicinity of Port
Jackson. The amputation of the finger is per-
formed by the same person who bores the noses.
Pamphlet and Finnegan, while among the In-
dians, were regularly painted twice a day, and
were frequently importuned to allow themselves to
be further ornamented by scarifying the body and
boring the nose; but on their signifying that they
did not wish it, the natives always desisted; nor
was any violence used against them during their
whole residence.
On only one occasion, during our stay, did the
Indians show the least inclination towards pilfer-
/
ing, although they were constantly begging for
every thing they saw. Our men had been em-
ployed on shore all day cutting timber, and several
natives had been with them in the afternoon.
Upon returning in the evening, it was found that
? ' ? ? , . d
somebody had stolen the best falling axe we had:
this, as we had originally but two, we could ill
spare; and, on Mr. Penson?s informing me of the
circumstance, I resolved to recover it if possible.
I accordingly took the jolly-boat, and, with Mr.
Penson and Bowen, pulled up to their encamp-

ment. On landing, several of them came out to
meet us, and to them I endeavoured to make
known our loss by signs. They soon seemed to
v
understand me, and signified that they would ac-
l \
company me to the place where it was hidden, which
several of them accordingly prepared to do. How-
ever, I observed that they dropped back one by
one, so that by the time I had advanced half a
mile, there were only one old man and one young
man left with me; one of these I was determined
to secure till the axe was restored, I had some
difficulty in making them keep up with me, as
they were continually framing pretences to get
into the bush; but lat length succeeded in bring-
ing them opposite the vessel. Here the old man
made signs that he and I should stop till the young
man brought the axe, and we accordingly halted,
while the other was soon out of sight in the wood.
I then happened to take my eye a moment off my
companion, when he darted into the bush with
, i
amazing celerity, and was out of sight in an in-
stant. We now supposed that our friendly inter-
course with them was at an end, and that we should
not again see the axe; but at eight o?clock next

morning we found a number of them on the beach,
abreast of the vessel, shouting and elevating the
axe, which, on my going on shore, was delivered
to me by the old man who had shown such speed
the evening before. So this incident, instead of
interrupting our good understanding, rendered our
mutual confidence more strong; for several of the
natives ventured on board that day for the first
time, whereas they had always before refused to
do so with signs of fear. From this time forward
not a single day passed, on which we had not ten or
twelve of them on board at a time. They seemed
very curious, inquiring the use of every thing they
saw, but it was longer before we could persuade
them to eat any thing with us. However, when
they once began, it was by no means an easy
matter to satisfy them. Our cats and goats struck
them with particular astonishment. We could
not prevail on them to approach the latter, of
4 %?'
whose horns they seemed to have a great awe.
They were, however, continually caressing the
V
cats, and holding them up for the admiration of
their companions on shore.

awe of either good or evil spirits; nor did the En-
glishmen we found with them ever observe any
thing like religious ceremony or prayer among
them, during all the time of their residence.
The women are far more fortunate than those
in the neighbourhood of Sydney, where they are
abused in the most cruel way by the men; and
where the marriage ceremony consists of seizing
the bride and beating her till she is senseless.
Pamphlet assured me that, during his residence
among these natives (nearly seven months), he
never saw a woman struck or ill-treated except by
one of her own sex. Indeed, save among the
women, he never saw a quarrel in that or any
other tribe he was with. The women that I saw
were far superior in personal beauty to the men,
or indeed to any natives of this country whom I
have yet seen. Many of them are tall, straight,
and well formed; and there were two, in parti-
cular, whose shape and features were such as no

men, sixteen or seventeen women, and about twenty

are frequent, and often end fatally. As some of
them were witnessed by Pamphlet and his com-

the description which they gave me of two, at which

? The natives at Pumice-stone River having a
quarrel with another tribe, at the distance of five-
and-twenty miles to the S.W., they were about to
set off for the latter place in order to decide it; and
as I was then living with the chief of the Pumice-

him. We accordingly set out early one morning,
travelling from ten to fifteen miles daily. Our

party consisted of ten men, eight or nine women,
and fourteen children, the king, his son, and myself.
The men carried the nets, and the women were
loaded with fern-root, &c.; all parties, men and
women, being armed with spears. On the third
day we halted, and all the men went out fishing.
After eating a hearty meal, they commenced paint-
ing and decorating themselves with feathers. The
king; himself covered me all over with charcoal
o
and bees? wax; and, when all were dressed, we again
*
went forward, and in a short time arrived at a
? , \
number of huts, which had been erected for the
occasion. They were so numerous that I could
hardly count them; and each tribe (for there were
many tribes assembled to see the fight) appeared
to have their huts distinct from the other. On
our arriving within a small distance of the en-
campment, we all sat down; and as soon as we
were perceived, the assembled multitude began to
shout, and immediately my companions were visited
by several of their friends, and all began to weep
piteously. Shortly afterwards the chief of the tribe

conversed for some time with our chief, he pointed

out a place on which we might build huts for our-
selves. The women of our party then immediately
commenced building, and in less than two hours had
finished five or six commodious huts, in which we all
rested that night. The next morning a large party,
v
including our chief and several of his men, went out
kangaroo hunting. They were not, however, very
successful, having only caught one large kangaroo.
They, however, gave me a great piece of the hind
quarter, of which they made me eat very heartily;
and here I will observe, that at all times, whether
they had much or little, fish or kangaroo, or any
thing else, they always gave me as much as I
could eat. The same evening at sunset, the whole
party, carrying fire-sticks, went away about a mile
and a half to where the battle took place the next
day, the chief leaving me with his wife and two
children in the hut. He however returned some
time in the night, for I found him at my back
when I woke in the morning. The next day,
after breakfast, the ceremony of painting was gone
through afresh, and we marched in regular line,

panying them. We shortly arrived at a level piece
of ground, in which had been dug a circular pit
about forty feet in diameter. I was now left in
care of the chief?s wife at a short distance from this
pit; but being anxious to view the fight, in spite of
her endeavours, I went up towards it. She, how-
ever, followed me, calling out and weeping; upon
which one of the men of our tribe came to me,
and, taking my hand, led me up to the pit. I there
saw a woman of my tribe, and one of another,

fighting desperately with sticks. The battle did
not, however, last long, as they appeared to be
quite in earnest; and in five minutes their heads,
arms, &c. being dreadfully cut and swelled, our
woman was declared the conqueror, the other not
being able any longer to oppose her. The victory
was announced by a loud shout from all parties,
and the amazonian combatants were immediately
carried away by their respective friends. The man
who had brought me to the pit still continued
to hold my hand, and I observed his whole body
tremble like an aspen leaf. The chief?s wife now
came again to me, and endeavoured by every
means in her power to force me away; but

finding I still refused, she went for her husband,
who immediately came, and taking away my spear,
forced me out of the crowd. He then called
several other chiefs around me, and showed me to
them. This caused great talking and laughing
among them, from surprise at my colour and ap-
pearance. The king then addressed them at some
length, apparently asking them not to hurt me,
which they gave me to understand by signs that
/
they would not. I was then delivered up to our
chief?s wife once more, who led me back to the
place where we were left before. I had however
a good view of the pit, round which the whole
crowd still remained. I now found that, while I
had been engaged with' the chiefs, another fight
had taken place in the pit, for I presently saw a
man carried out by his friends, who were of our
tribe, bleeding profusely at the side from a spear-
wound. He was brought down to where I was,
and placed on two men?s knees, with some kan-
garoo-skins spread over him; the men, women,
and children howling and lamenting, much in the
manner of the lower Irish. They supplied him with
water from time to time, but his wound was evi-

The chief?s wife then took me away a short di-

set to work immediately to skin him; but from

the distance at which I stood, I could not perceive
the manner in which they did it. In the mean
time two more men had entered the ring to fight;
and here it may not be amiss to observe, that
previous to each fight the same ceremony is used
that is described by Thomas Pamphlet in the
combat which he witnessed. The third fight was
now going on, while our party were engaged in
skinning their deceased companion; when it ap-
peared, from a tremendous shout, that some un-
' ? ? , " i
looked-for event had happened in the pit. I
afterwards learned that the spectators judged that
I
foul play had taken place between the combatants.
The crowd upon this drew away from the pit;
and our party, accompanied by those tribes that
were friendly to them, formed themselves in a line,
while their adversaries did the same opposite to
them. The battle then became general. Several
from each side would advance, and having thrown
their, spears, again retire to the line, in the manner

of light infantry. Others would get behind the
trees, and there watch an opportunity to hurl their
spears with greater effect. In this manner the
fight continued upwards of two hours, during which
time many retired from the line severely wounded,
and another man of our party was killed. What
number may have been killed on the other side I
had no means of ascertaining. Our party now

began to give way, which being observed by the

women and children with whom I was, they made
signs to me to accompany them; and with the
exception of those who were employed in skinning
the body, we made off. Not being able, however,
to run as fast as the rest, I was soon in the midst
of the opposite party, who, however, notwithstand-
ing my fears, did not attempt to hurt me, but

merely laughed and pointed at me as they passed
by, showing the same marks of wonder as the chiefs
had done in the morning. I then walked back to
the huts which we had left that morning, but found
nobody there. However, I sat down by the fire,
and towards evening they began to return, a few
at a time. Just before dark I saw a large crowd
approach, who (it seems) were bringing the "bodies

of the two men who had been killed. They laid
them down about twenty rods from the huts, and
began a great lamentation over them. The first
body was completely flayed, but they had not yet
had leisure to skin the other. I attempted to
approach, but was immediately prevented by ail
hands, and forced to return to the fire. Shortly
afterwards our chief and his wife came back, and
instantly commenced packing up their nets, &c. in
order to depart. Two large fires were lighted
where the bodies lay, in which, as I judged from
the noise as well as the offensive smell, they were
both consumed. Immediately after this our wdiole
party decamped; and having travelled more than
half a mile, we stopped for the night. Very early
next morning we again started, and travelled all
day with great expedition, without ever halting or
eating any thing. Among our party were four
women and three men wounded, the latter very
severely. They however contrived, though with
difficulty, to keep up with us. I had observed,
during this day?s march, two men, one of whom
belonged to our tribe, and another to a tribe which
\
was friendly to us, each of whom carried something

on his shoulder, but did not keep the same path
with us, walking through the bush at a little di-
stance abreast of us. Being curious to know what
it was they carried, I attempted several times to
approach them; but as soon as this was observed,
I was invariably brought back by the others, who
N
made signs to me not to go near them. We tra-

veiled that day about eight or ten miles, and towards
evening arrived at the edge of a large swamp,
where we halted, and huts were instantly erected
by the women, who were afterwards obliged to go
out and procure fern-root for the whole party, the
T
men never providing any thing but fish or game.
I lodged as usual with the chief, at a little distance
from whose hut I observed the two men hang up
their burthens, which I again attempted to ap-
proach, but was (as before) prevented. Here we
remained two days, during which a large fire was
kept constantly burning underneath the trees on
which these mysterious burthens were hanging.
On the evening of the second day, I once more
attempted to find out of what they consisted, though
I strongly suspected they were the skins of the
two men who had been killed. The old chief, on

seeing me go near them, ran after me, calling
loudly to me to return; but I persevered, and at
last reached the place. I now saw that my conjecture
was right: the two skins were stretched each on
four spears, and drying over the fire. The skin
of the head was divided into two parts, and hung
down with the hair on it. The soles of the feet
and palms of the hands were also hanging down,
/
and the nails still attached firmly to the skin.
Several of the men and women were sitting round
the fire under the skins, and now invited me to sit
down with them, which I did. They then gave
me some kangaroo-skin to decorate my arms and
head, and seemed to wish me to sing to them; but
on my making signs that it was not proper to do
so while the remains of our friends were not buried,
they seemed surprised, and afterwards told me by
signs that they were much pleased at my refusal.
After sitting with them about half an hour, the
chief?s wife came and brought me back to the hut.
Shortly afterwards, all the men dressed themselves
in kangaroo-skins, and one of them in an old rug
jacket which I had, and with one or two of the

women, held a consultation round the fire, each

person having a fire-stick in his hand. After con-
versing about half an hour, two of the party se-
parated from the rest, and having taken down the
skins, set off at full speed through the bush; the
rest followed, shouting and making much noise.
After this I saw nothing more of the skins, nor do
I know what became of them. In about three-
? -
quarters of an hour the party returned; and the
man who had taken my old jacket gave it me back.
The next morning we returned towards the Pumice-
stone River by the same path which we had tra-
velled to the fight, and the natives followed their
usual occupations of fishing aifd hunting as if
nothing had happened. 55

sanguinary; and as the termination was very dif-

ANOTHER FIGHT
ACCOUNT
OF A FIGHT WITNESSED BY THOMAS
PAMPHLET.
44 About the time of our first arrival at Pumice-
stone River, the young native whom we called the
Doctor, and who used to bore the noses and scarify
the skins of the rest of the tribe, had been wounded
in the knee with a spear, while out on a hunting
expedition, by a native of another tribe, at a di-
stance of fifty miles to the northward. As the
spear had broken in the wound, there was a good
deal of inflammation in his leg, when he applied
to me to cure him. This I effected by extracting
a large splinter from his knee, and in a short time
he was quite recovered. As soon as his cure was
effected, and he was able once more to go out
fishing and hunting, he sallied forth, accompanied
by several of his tribe, in order to take satisfaction
of the man who had wounded him; and having a
great liking for me, on account of my having cured
him, he insisted on my going with him.
44 The spot appointed for the combat was a small
ring, about twenty-five feet in diameter, about three

feet deep, and surrounded by a palisade of sticks.
The crowd assembled to see the fight amounted to
about 500 men, women, and children; and the
combatants, followed by those who were friendly
to them respectively, approached the ring in single
file, and drew up in a regular manner on opposite
sides of the circle. The whole assembly were well
armed, many of them having five or six spears
each. The two combatants then entered the ring,
and having laid down their spears in opposite rows*
point to point, began walking backwards and for-
wards, talking loudly to each other and using vio-
lent gestures, as if to inflame their passions to
a due height. The women had previously been
driven away, and the most profound silence
reigned in the rest of the assembly. After about
ten minutes spent in this way, they commenced
picking up their spears with their feet, keeping
their eyes fixed on each other, so as to prevent
either from taking advantage of the other?s stoop-
t I
ing. In this manner they proceeded till they had
each three spears, which they stuck in the ground,
y
ready for immediate use. At the moment when
they commenced thus picking up their spears, a

tremendous shout burst from the spectators, who
immediately relapsed into their former silence. All
now being ready, one or two of the friends of each
party spoke across the ring for a few minutes;
and as soon as they ceased, the Doctor threw his
spear with all his force at the other, who, however,
succeeded in warding it off with a kind of wooden
shield called an elemong , into which, however, it
penetrated three or four inches. The other then
threw in his turn ; hut his spear was also warded
off in the same manner. The third spear which
the Doctor threw penetrated quite through the
shoulder of his adversary, who instantly fell, when
one or two of his friends, jumping into the ring,
pulled out the spear, and returned it to its owner;
and the tournament concluded with loud huzzas
from all parties. They all then retired to huts,
which had been erected for the occasion, and the
next day they again met at the ring, in order to
give the friends of the wounded man an opportu-
nity to avenge his quarrel. But it appeared that
no one wished to do so, as each had now wounded
the other, and a reconciliation took place between
the two tribes, which was announced by shouting,

dancing, &c.; and a parcel of boys were selected
from each party, and sent into the ring to wrestle:
after which both tribes joined in a hunting expe-
dition, which lasted a week; but my feet being
sore, I was consigned to the care of the women.?
Messrs. Oxley and Stirling had named Thursday,
the 4th December, for their return to the vessel;
but after waiting dinner till past seven o?clock; we
gave them over for that night; and were employed
on the following day in completing our wood and
water, so as to be ready for sea the next morning.
On Friday evening, at sun-set, I went ashore and
made a large fire, in order to serve as a beacon for
the boat, which, however, not having arrived at
ten o?clock, I went to bed, somewhat uneasy, lest
some accident should have happened: however,
after I had been in bed about an hour, Mr. Penson

came down to let me know that he had heard and
seen a gun fire. On this I rose, and just before
midnight the boat came alongside, having rowed

the morning. They were all much fatigued, par-

ticularly Messrs. Oxley and Stirling, who had not
been well before they left the vessel, and now ap-
peared quite exhausted, from constant exposure to
a hot sun for twelve or fifteen hours daily in an
open boat. Our hardships were rendered less
tolerable from our having been so shamefully
robbed by our servants, in consequence of which
these gentlemen had no wine or spirits to take

Mr. Oxley told us, that after losing the first day
in the examination of a large creek, which Fin-
negan mistook for the river, they had on the fol-
lowing day entered the river itself, by an entrance
three miles wide, and had proceeded above fifty
miles from the mouth. The water was fresh about
eighteen miles up, even at high water, and where
they left off, the tide still rose four feet and a half.
This magnificent river, the further examination of
which they were obliged with reluctance to post-
pone to a more favourable opportunity, was, at the
termination of their progress, above half a mile
wide, and eight fathoms deep; and from an emi-
nence near it they obtained a view of its course,
meandering for nearly thirty miles through a rich

flat country, clothed with large timber, among
which was an unknown species of pine in consi-
derable abundance, which from its size, and the
apparently excellent quality of the wood, will pro-
bably prove a valuable acquisition to the colony,
it being well calculated for ships? spars. The
soil on both banks was a rich black loam, and in
every part the wild indigo was growing in abun-
dance.
Having been thus successful beyond our expecta-
tions in the main object of our expedition, and the
cutter being ready for sea, we got under way in the
morning of Saturday, 6th December, with the last
quarter of flood tide, and the wind at N.E., in order
to work out of the bay; but while we were on the
>
last tack that was necessary to clear Moreton-head,
the wind suddenly chopped round to the southward,
and came on to blow with great violence. The
gale continued till Monday afternoon, though it
was less strong than that we encountered off Break-
sea Spit, and then it moderated as suddenly as it
commenced. The wind then veering to the N.E.
we stood away before it, having been driven about
twenty miles to the northward during the gale.

EXPEDITION TO PORT CURTIS
The next morning, about eight o?clock, we were
within a few miles of Turtle Island ; and Mr. Stir-
ling and I, who had, ever since we left it, been an-
ticipating the pleasure we should feel in bringing
back a quantity of turtle to our friends in Sydney,
with much difficulty prevailed on Mr. Oxley to
come to with the cutter under the lee of the island.
We then went ashore; but, owing to the late gale,
the breakers ran so very high, and the tide was
so far in, that though we saw numbers of turtle
swimming round the island, not one of them was
?�
able to land. However, we procured a large quan-
tity of mutton-birds? eggs, together with several
birds, and a large bag of spinach, with which we
went back to the cutter, and immediately got
under way. The eggs are excellent, and are with
difficulty distinguished from hens?. Indeed, one
of our men assured me that he had often sold them
in Sydney market for hens? eggs. They afforded
us a dislu of excellent pancakes, which, with the
spinach, were a real treat to us, as we had been
long without any vegetables; and Mr. Oxley, Mr.

Penson, and some of the men, had become badly
afflicted with the scurvy. The breeze continuing

fair and steady, we ran on for the remainder of the
day, and through the night, with all sail set; and
*
next day at ten A.M. we expected, according to
our reckoning, that we were off Smoky Cape, about
forty miles to the north of Port Macquarie. It
was, however, so hazy that we could not distinguish
the land at that time; but in a quarter of an hour,
on its suddenly clearing up, we found to our sur-
prise that we were passing Port Macquarie, having
thus in twenty-two hours run 20 5 miles, of which
distance, as the cutter never exceeded seven and a

drifted us about fifty-six miles.
We immediately hauled in for the shore, and
the sea breeze shortly afterwards setting in, Mr.
Stirling and I were enabled to land at about one

EXPEDITION TO PORT CURTIS, ETC.
to the vessel by four o?clock, P.M., we took a re-
luctant leave of our friends, and, accompanied by
Mr. Fenton, returned to the cutter. Here, to our
great satisfaction, Mr. Fenton was with some

noon we once more got under way, and on Satur-
day evening, December 13 th, at six o?clock, we
had the pleasure of coming to an anchor in Sydney
Cove.
