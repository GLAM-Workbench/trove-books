DOUGLAS B. W. SLADEN, B.A.
Reprinted, by permission, from ? The Cosmopolitan .?
Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen, B.A. Oxford,
B.A. and LL.B. Melbourne, is the eldest son of Douglas
Brooke Sladen, fourth son of the late John Baker Sladen,
D.L., J.P., of Ripple Court, near Dover, by Mary, daughter
of the late John Wheelton, Esq., whose name is familiar
as one of the two Sheriffs of London who were imprisoned
by the House of Commons for breach of privilege in
levying distress on Messrs. Hansard in the famous Stock-
dale v. Hansard case. The subject of our notice was born
on the sth February 1856 in his maternal grandfather?s town
house, No. 59 Gloucester Terrace, and educated at Temple
Grove, East Sheen (Waterfield?s), Cheltenham College,
Trinity College, Oxford, and Melbourne University. At
Cheltenham he took the first junior open scholarship, and
first senior open scholarship twice; and among numerous
other prizes the Jex Blake Geographical and English
Poem. He was senior prefect, captain of the rifle
corps, captain of the classical at football, treasurer of the
cricket eleven, editor of the Cheltonian (school maga-
zine), etc. He shot at Wimbledon in the Schools? Match
for the Ashburton Shield four years, and also shot for the
Spencer Cup twice, winning the Spencer Cup ip 1874.
At Oxford he was captain of the Oxford University
Rifle Volunteers, and shot at Wimbledon for Oxford v.
Cambridge four years, heading the score in 1879. He also
did good service for Oxford at football. He was an open
classical scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, and took a
second-class in Classical Moderations, and a first-class in
Final Schools (History). He graduated B.A. in 1879, and
at Melbourne graduated B.A. and LL.B.
After a wide and varied experience at home as scholar
and sportsman, Mr. Sladen emigrated to Australia in
1879, and in 1882 was appointed to the Chair of History
in the University of Sydney, N.S.W. He always thinks
and writes like an Australian upon all Australian subjects,
, n fD
j oJ


and prides himself very much on being a colonist, no doubt
having in him some of the feeling of the men of the May-
fiower, ?Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits;?
and Mr. Sladen has shown that he could do without his
Mother England, and love her none the less.
As many of our readers are no doubt well aware, Mr.
Sladen is well set for a good literary innings. The critics
have not spoilt his play, and he is mastering the bowling
of fortune. In 1881 he sent Frithjof and Ingebjorg home
to England to be published ; but so much time was lost
over its publication that it did not appear till 1882, nine
months afterwards. Most of the longer poems had pre-
viously appeared in the Victorian Reviezv , a Melbourne
monthly magazine similar to the Contemporary Reviezv.
This successful work is now almost out of print, only a
copy or two being left in the hands of the publishers. In
1882 he brought out the first edition of Australian Lyrics
in Melbourne, and in the following year appeared Poetry
of Exiles, published in Sydney. 1884 brought with it A
Summer Christmas , a novel in rhyme, his connection with
his present publishers (Messrs. Griffith, Farran, & Co., of
St. Paul?s Churchyard) commencing regularly with this
volume. In 1885 appeared In Cornzvatl and Across the
Sea, the familiar white binding with its red and black
ribbon, but not in its present form, appearing for the first
time on this volume. In the following year it was
necessary to bring out second editions of Australian
Lyrics and A Poetry of Exiles , and he brought them out
in the white parchment binding with scarlet and black
ribbon, on thick, rough-edged, hand-made, square xxmo
paper, which he has adopted as the form for all his future
volumes. By a mistake in the estimate, these volumes
were issued at a shilling each, which is below cost price.
The price should have been two shillings, and this leaves
only the narrowest margin of profit. Subsequent editions
will be issued at two shillings each.
It is an open secret that the little novel, Seized by a
Shadozv, issued in 1886 under the nom de plume of Rose
Mullion, is by Mr. Sladen. It was designed to be a satire
upon the school of Hugh Conway, substituting the im-
possible for the absolutely improbable. It is a very clever
sarcasm upon the methods of the school, the interest of
the reader being sustained by a daring ghost story, and
the scenery being the actual scenery around Loch Lun-
davra at the back of Ben Nevis, on the great military road
between Fort-William and Glasgow.


In July of the present year was issued Edward the
Black Piince , an epic drama, uniform with Australian
Lyrics (2nd edition), and A Poetry of Exiles (2nd edition),
giving a special study of the Fair Maid of Kent (so dis-
torted in modern fiction) from contemporary authorities.
The keynote is manfulness , and the poet has dramatized
the general types of English manhood, who in the wars of
King Edward 111.
? Had time to win for Englishmen
The character on History?s page
Of fighting out the one to ten,
And conquering.?
Apart from the various works we have alluded to, Mr.
Sladen finds time for more miscellaneous labours. He
writes a good deal for the press, articles and poems of his
appearing from time to time in various journals and
magazines, his most definitely Australian work in this line
being a series of sporting tales which have appeared in the
Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.
Mr. Sladen is now engaged upon the Australian part of
an important dictionary for a firm of London publishers,
and has recently been advertising for suitable contributions
for the volume, of selections from Australian poetry (on
Australian subjects), which he has been commissioned to
prepare for Mr. Walter Scott?s beautiful little Canterbury
Poets? series. His next long poem will deal with Sir
Walter Raleigh, and Mr. Sladen will pay a long visit to
Devon in connection with this work.
In 1880, Mr. Sladen married Margaret Isabella Muirhead,
youngest daughter and co - heiress of the late Robert
Muirhead, one of the pioneers of the Western District of
Victoria. Mr. Sladen?s uncle, the late Hon. Sir Charles
Sladen, K.C.M.G., was for many years leader of the Upper
House of Parliament in Victoria, first Colonial Treasurer of
Victoria after the establishment of responsible Government,
and Premier of the colony during the crisis of 1868,
In 1886-87, Mr. Sladen made a prolonged sojourn
abroad with his family, travelling up the Rhine, spending
a long time at Heidelberg, in Switzerland, at Florence, at
Venice, at Rome, near Naples, at Athens, and at Con-
stantinople, and returning by sea via Smyrna and Mar-
seilles to Paris. He paid short visits to many places in
the Rhineland, Switzerland, and Italy.
Mr. Sladen is a follower of Longfellow rather than of
Wordsworth, finding in him a health and manfulness
which he looks for in vain in the lake poet, who always


seems to him deficient in muscularity; otherwise both drew
then inspiration from much the same sources, and addressed
themself to John. Wesley?s parish-all the world. It is
u/'d S r^ blt,on ?� be the mouthpiece of ordinary
healthy Englishmen, essentially a simple-minded sport-
lovmg, courageous race. He thinks for a poet obe a
SscSe at an e d EngliSh pW 5' he � U S ht t0 be essentially
mascuhne and l ,, sympathy with the active out-of-door
life which has given the nation its characteristics Stoical
inattention to pam is a characteristic of the nation ; there-
ore he thinks it is not for the English poet to raise shrill
lamentations over Ins mental pain. Mr. Sladen of
the zest m life whether the social life of the city or the
fiee life of the wilds, and he thinks that no one can
Englishman UP enj � yment with relish than the


Council of India, and afterwards Judge of the Chief Court
of the Punjab ; an office he held until 1881, when he retired
from the service, but still takes the warmest interest in
Indian affairs.
During his career of Secretary to the Punjab Govern-
ment, Mr. Thornton took a part?not the less important
because not prominent?in framing several well-known
enactments, such as?(i) the ?Punjab Tenancy Act? of
1868, for regulating the relations of landowner and culti-
vator, ?a measure which, with a few modifications, is still
in force, and has been described by a late Lieutenant-
Governor as the ?charter of a contented peasantry;?
(2) the first ? Punjab Municipal Act,? ?an enactment
which laid the foundation of local self-government in the
province. By rules made under this Act, municipal
committees were divided into classes, with powers of
expenditure varying according to the degree of their
progress,?-those committees which showed vigour and
capacity being advanced from time to time from a lower
to a higher grade. As a rule the committees were nomi-
nated, ? the elective system, in the English sense, not
being usually in favour with Asiatic communities, ?but
the members were selected so as to represent the differ-
ent interests in the town; and wherever there was a
general wish for an elective system, it was allowed., the
object being to train the people gradually for the exercise
of full municipal powers. Under this system municipal
powers were granted from time to time to upwards of
two hundred townships. The system has been greatly
developed by a later measure, passed under Lord Ripon?s
administration, under which extended and independent
powers have been very widely granted to local elective
bodies. Whether these powers will be exercised prudently
and for the public good, remains to be seen.
Mr, Thornton also took a keen interest in the extension
of education, through the medium of the vernacular lan-
guages of India, and in the movement which culminated
in the establishment of the Punjab University ; and it was
mainly through his exertions that the Punjab was the first
province in India to establish a system of registering
births and deaths, and to prepare and publish statistics
of agriculture and commerce ; while his Annual Reports
of the administration of the province were more than
once referred to by the Secretary of State as models of
what such reports should be.
As Foreign Secretary?in addition to the varied and


important duties ordinarily devolving on that official in
India?he accompanied Lord Lytton on his tour on the
North-West Frontier in 1876, and took part in concluding
the treaty between the British Government and the Khan
of Kalat, which has resulted in the occupation of Quetta
by British troops, the pacification of Baluchistan, and the
extension of railways and telegraphs from our border to
the Khojak Pass. He also took a prominent part in arrang-
ing the historic gathering of chiefs and feudatories known as
the ? Imperial Assemblage,? at which the Queen, through
her representative. Lord Lytton, formally assumed the title
of ? Empress of India.? The aims and objects of this
gathering, the difficulties which attended its progress, and
the success with which it was crowned, form the subject
of an interesting article in a late number of the Asiatic
Quarterly , from the pen of Sir Owen Burne. From this
article some idea will be found of the care, forethought,
and diplomatic skill involved in the undertaking. Such
an assemblage had never before taken place in India, and
there were no precedents to guide the Foreign Office in
deciding the numerous questions of etiquette and preced-
ence which arose; while the work of transport, and of
locating and provisioning the camps of the chiefs and their
numerous followers, and showing them suitable attention,
looking after foreign consuls and distinguished visitors,
suggesting suitable topics of conversation at official durbars ,
required very careful consideration and arrangement. For
his share in contributing to the success of the great gather-
ing, Mr. Thornton received the thanks of Her Majesty?s
Government.
As a member of the Legislative Council, Mr. Thornton?s
name is associated with several measures of importance ;
and he took part in revising more than one chapter in the
great code of substantive Law and Procedure which is
being gradually prepared for India, under the direction of
the most distinguished jurists of the day, ?an inestimable
boon to the country and people, and a good example to
England. Lastly, as Judge of the Chief Court of the
Punjab, he is the author of several of the leading decisions
of that Bench.
In recognition of his interest in education, Mr. Thornton
was appointed Fellow of the University of Calcutta in
1875, and in 1879 Vice-President of the Punjab University
College ; and for his administrative services, he was created
C.S.I. in 1877. He is J.P. for Surrey, Member of the
Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, F.R.G.S.; a working


member of many philanthropic and other societies ; and
an occasional contributor to reviews and periodicals, in
short, a very busy member of the leisure class. In 1862
Mr. Thornton married Alfreda, the second daughter of J.
C. Spender, Esq., of Bath and Englishcombe, and has one
son, Alfred Henry Robinson, educated at Harrow and
Trinity College, Cambridge.
PIERS THURSBY, J.P.,
The subject of this notice, is the fifth son of the Rev. W.
Thursby, J.P., of Ormerpd House, Lancashire, and was born
in 1854. He commenced service in the Militia, and in 1855
joined the Ist Royal Lancashire Regiment, with which he
served ten months, three months of the time at Zante. He
returned home after the Crimean War, when he purchased
a Cornetcy in the 9th Royal Lancers, gazetted 19th Sep-
tember, 1856. He became Lieutenant on the sth March
1858 and Captain on the 24th May 1861. He served
with his regiment during the Indian Mutiny (i857~59)-
He was in the action of Shunshabad, at the capture of
Meerangunge, and at the siege and capture of Lucknow.
He served in the action of Moosebagh, the summer cam-
paign in Oude and Rohilcund, actions of Rhodawar and
Allygunge, the capture of Bareilly, the action Shah-
jehanpore and pursuit to Mabondee, and affair at Kumda-
hote, for which service he holds the medal and clasp. He
left the service in August 1864, and was married the same
month to Mary, daughter of the late Joseph Godman, Park
Hotch, Godaiming.


X
AN AUSTRALIAN POET.
The advent of a new poet ?if he be in deed and in truth a
poet ?is a subject of universal congratulation. For not
only does he adorn the country in which he lives, but the
far-reaching influence of his work spreads over and benefits
the whole world ; not only are the years in which he lives
and writes permeated and ennobled by his labours, but
their effect infiltrates through all the centuries to come,
moulds their destiny, and determines in part their history.
The great poets of the past offer him the hand of brother-
hood, and ?young and old rise up and call him blessed.?
It was Beranger, we think, who said, ? I care not who
makes the laws of a country, so long as I make the songs.?
It is therefore with great pleasure that we refer to the
poems of Mr. Sladen, an Australian colonist, whose works
have been a few years before the public, and the subjects
of many laudatory notices from the press in that country
and in England. An Oxford scholar and graduate, Mr.
Sladen emigrated to Australia in 1879, and that weird and
melancholy country proved the inspiration of some of his
happiest efforts. In 1881 he collected together a few of
his poems which had appeared in the Victorian Review ,
a Melbourne monthly magazine, and sent them to England
to be published, entitling the volume, from the principal
poem it contains, ? Frithjof and Ingebjorg.? This story is
founded on a Scandinavian Saga, and abounds in passages
having the true ring. Here and there the metre and rhyme
of the poem are very happy ; the passages, which begin
with an emphatic monosyllable, are extremely telling,
such as
? Still
Heedless alike of good or ill,
Sits Ingebjorg by the fire in the hall; ?
? Grim,
Heedless of eyes that hang on him.?
We cannot help involuntarily echoing the wish of the
modest concluding lines as we put down the book :
? Many songs were left unsung,
As the story sped along.


These perchance some later day,
When I am not over-young,
And my lyre is better strung,
Will beguile an hour away.?
Like most of the author?s works, it has been most favour-
ably reviewed by the press.
It would seem difficult indeed to find anything new to
say about Waterloo. Yet one of Mr. Sladen?s most
successful poems is on this stirring subject. He contrasts
a heroic soldier dying in the great battle, with a fair maid
praying for him in a quiet country church in Kent, with
the power of a true artist:
? Still, still
In the moonlight chill,
A dying dragoon looks up to a friend ;
? Tell her I did my part to the end ;
Tell her I died as an Englishman should ;
And give her ?her handkerchief dipped in my blood. ? ?
It is a stirring and patriotic ballad. ? The Two Roses ?
and ? My Aunt,? one pathetic, the other humorous, are
poems of great beauty, which exhibit the versatile nature
of Mr. Sladen?s work.
? Australian Lyrics ? comprises one of the best and
most characteristic of Australian poems ?? The Squire?s
Brother.? Already well known, for swing of metre, facility
of rhyming, and truthfulness of description, this poem is a
credit to the land which has already produced a Kendall
and a Gordon, one of those finished pieces of work which
remind us of a Dutch painting; it is so complete in itself,
that it seems as if another touch would mar its proportions.
The penniless younger son of an ancient family is supposed
to have emigrated to Queensland to ? make his pile,? in
order that he may marry the girl he loves. Under
the burning southern sun watching his cattle, he thus
soliloquizes :
? Do you suppose that old Sir Hugh, who won your lands in mail,
Showed half the valour that I do in sitting on this rail ?
He tilted in his lordly way, and stoutly, I confess ;
But I stand sentry all the day against the wilderness.
? * There isn?t much poetical about an old tweed suit,
And nothing chivalrous at all about a cowhide boot;
And yet beneath a bushman?s breast there lurks a knightly soul,
And bushman?s feet have often pressed towards a gallant goal.
? So here I am, and spite of all, I hope, in long years more,
To stand within my brother?s hall, my quest of fortune o?er.
And so I slave, and stay and save, and squander nought but youth ;
And if Nell said that I was brave, she only told the truth,?


Here we have forcibly depicted the typical young
Englishman ; the saunterer in the Row or at Clubs in
London, but the man who dies to defend Khartoum, or
perishes doing his duty uncomplainingly amid Crimean
snows or on Egyptian deserts, or becomes the pioneer of
such a country as Australia.
? A Bush Flower ? recalls Mr. Locker?s celebrated London
Lyrics; it has the same flowing line and witty turn of
phrase. The first verse is a happy specimen of the
whole:
? She?s attired in the richest of dresses,
Just home from a Paris modiste,
Which you?ll find, if the truth she confesses,
Cost a hundred or two at the least.
The lace on her flounce is Venetian,
Worth, who shall say how much a yard ?
And her pose is Parisian-Grecian,
Not English, unbending and hard.?
These few lines express with great aptitude the charac-
teristics of the Australian girl ; the majority of those
native-born are tall and well made, and many beautiful.
In his admirable address ?To Australia,? Mr. Sladen
thus nobly apostrophizes his adopted land :
? But you are heir and scholar to all the lore of time ;
Born of the Earth in flower, born in a golden clime,
You must profit by the errors of all your sisterhood ;
You must purge away the evil, and cleave unto the good ;
Your reign must be the first-fruits of better years to come,
An earnest of the dawn of the true millennium.?
How spirit-stirring and manly is the tone of these
verses. Instead of weeping over love ditties and senti-
mental inanities, Mr. Sladen attunes his lyre to noble
topics, and urges us to apply our energies to the work that
lies before us, not waste them in laments over melancholy
might-have-beens.
?To a fallen Gum-tree on Mount Baw-Baw,? is a
thoroughly Australian poem. The quotation of one or two
verses cannot do justice to this happy flight of fancy, but
may give the reader an idea of the metre and rhythm ;??
? Yes, you lie there in state unearthly-solemn,
As if you?d been a heaven-supporting column ;
Not a dead tree, of bark and foliage stript,
Gigantic Eucalypt.
? Your brothers, standing still, look half-defiant,
Half in mute sorrow for the fallen giant ;
I doubt if aught so great e?er fell so far,
Except a falling star.?


? A Poetry of Exile,? is full of good things. ? Quis
Separabit,? ?is a protest against colonial independence,?
and has been much admired for its sturdy manliness and
sound political sentiment. Of another class are the
following lines, and the perusal of them will confirm the
opinion as to Mr. Sladen?s versatility :
? O threatening sky,
You are not beautiful, but when there be
Dark clouds on high,
They conjure up remembrances for me
Of tones now dumb,
And dear ones drawing closer round the fire ;
And with them come
Storms of regret and raindrops of desire.
? I love the sun,
Blue heavens, Southern air, and sea in calm ;
The summer done,
I feel as in a Northern clime, a palm
Torn from its home ;
And yet, whenever clouds and cold appear,
Or fierce sea foam,
I welcome them, as if old friends drew near.?
?The Twelfth of August? proves Mr. Sladen to be a
humorist; and ? A Christmas Letter ? expresses the old
old tale of the Australian?s love for ?home,? as he persists
in calling England, even after he has been settled for years,
and his roots are deep down in the land of his adoption:
Perhaps the most completely Australian in feeling of all
Mr. Sladen?s work is A Summer Christmas , a happily
entitled volume, which the author distinctly wishes to be
considered as ?a novel in rhyme.? A family of squatters
with their guest are supposed to be sitting round the hall
during the intense heat of an Australian Christmastide ;
one of the latter?the professor?is reading the Decameron
of Boccaccio, and it occurs to the assembled party that
they also would like to beguile the hours indoors in hearing
and telling similar tales. Hence we have a great variety
of poems, linked by a thread of narrative, which includes
many descriptions of station life and scenery, and, of
course, a love idyll. All the tales are on very different
subjects ; and for ourselves we prefer the two poems, ? The
Legend of Helen at Sparta,? and ? Odysseus in Scheria.?
In Cornwall and across the Sea is a collection of poems
published on the author?s return to England, which are nearly
all descriptive of various scenes visited, or seen on the
? voyage home,? as the Australians pathetically call the
journey. ? Advance, Australia,? has the ring of the old
Norse spirit about it.


We now come to Mr. Sladen?s last work ?Edward the
Black Prince , an epic drama. The times in which we live
are cold and prosaic, and in the jostle for place and money
men have but little time for poetry and refinement. It is
therefore creditable that even under these unfavourable
auspices this work has been well received and favourably
reviewed. Written not for money, but for love of its
subject?not for the hour, but for all time ?it carries with
it the stamp of good workmanship. The author is at once
a scholar, who has been at the utmost pains to verify his
facts, and present us with a true picture of the times of
Edward III.; and a poet, whose power and pathos have
described most graphically deeds of heroism and the
tenderest of love passages. The following is a very fair
and pleasant specimen :
? The fleeting, fairest charm
Of flowers, and stars, and seasons, has she caught;
Her flesh is spring anemone, her hair
Is soft and gold as sheen of summer sun
On age-browned stone in our old belfry towers :
Her presence is the sun?where?er it shines
Is sunshine, and in hearts where it has shone,
When it has passed, there is but cloud or night:
Her voice is rippling water; silence it,
And hear a void in nature : and her eyes
Are like the morning summer in Guienne,
Blue-skied, intense, but with the merry West
Blowing up cool and laughter from the quays
Which rib the broad Garonne.?
? But my love
Is like an oak-tree planted in my youth,
Or image of the Virgin worn in battle,
Or changeless star of eve, that guides the sailor ;
And as you ever reigned my heart?s one queen,
You shall reign Queen of England?an? I live.?
The descriptions of the Battle of Fall of Calais,
accounts of the Plague, and sea-fight with the Spaniards,
are masterpieces of narration.
His talent for prose writing is equal in its way to his
talent for poetry. A novel, called Seized by a Shadoiv,
published under the nom deplume ? Rose Mullion,? achieved
great success lately. ? Written for a satire on the school
of Hugh Conway, by substituting the just impossible for
the absolutely improbable,? it is in reality a good love
story, which will well beguile the tedium of a winter hour
by the fire, or the monotony of a too long summer day.
Margaret Thomas.
