PROLOGUE
HE Sun God saw a lovely laughing Sea
Nymph floating on the ocean, and loved
her for her beauty and mirth. Fearing to
lose his Nymph, he used his charm to keep
her floating there forever by giving her his
gifts. So she lay on the bosom of the deep, catching the
bright gems the Sun flung down to her. No emerald was
so green as the heart of the wave he gave her for a crown
to confine her flowing hair; no diamond so bright as the
spindrift he gave her as a girdle; no pearls so white and
pure as the bubbles of foam he set in it. And his spell
complete, her flowing wind-blown hair becoming waving
foliage, this fair laughing Sea-Nymph was transformed into
a beautiful Island, lying isolated in the biggest ocean in
the world, remaining the Sun God?s favourite forever!


'Uhe Sun?s Messengers
now timidly approached
the 'Uhrone


PART I.
CAVERN OF THE WINDS
HE Isle beloved of the Sun God at first lay in dream
less ever-smiling slumber on the swelling bosom of the
sea. Girdled by motionless wideness of great oceans,
the Sea-Nymph still slept under the perpetual kiss of
the Sun, and his golden light was ever tenderly em-
bracing her.
No breeze came from the land; no wind came from the sea?the
clear blue sky was cloudless. Strange subtle warmth possessed the
Isle and held it ever tranced and still in unruffled calm.
He who by his charm had put the laughing Nymph to rest, now
overpowered by yearning, longed for her awakening. At first had he
hung rapturously over her in this lovely Island, satisfied with merely
holding her in his entire possession, though in sleep. He beheld her
beauty yet; but in this eternal slumbering he missed her winsomeness,
her ardent looks, her laughter; the pretty mirth for which he first had
loved her.
He said regretfully:?? This too-perfected perfection palls on
me! The atmosphere is ever still beneath the charm of my kiss. Un-
natural calm! Meaningless pervading stillness everywhere! My Isle
is faultily faultless?an Isle without a Soul!


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
And the more the Sun God brooded over her, the deeper grew
her slumber?yet stronger and more powerful the trance?until it
seemed as though the faintest signs of life in her gentle breathing had
almost ceased! The sea was perfectly smooth, and covered with
almost imperceptible ripples. Water stirring lazily at edges of un-
touched, unsullied sands, with slow creeping flow came still more slowly
landwards, till it almost ceased its gentle fret and lullaby.
Then the Sun God said:? I will send forth my Messengers unto
the Genius of the Winds at heart of the World, and entreat him that
the Winds may bring together to my Isle some touches of all other
countries, and thus awaken her to life again! I have known naught
but sadness since I put my charming Nymph to sleep!?
He therefore sent seven of his shining Messengers, each of them
mounted on a golden shaft of light, unto the Cavern of the Winds, to
seek their Genius and carry to him his intense desire. They slid down
from the blue sky, their swift steeds casting from their gold-shod hoofs
bright sparks of light.
In time they came unto the centre of the World, where was a
great Cavern. As the Messengers approached at first they beheld
within it only a great purple void gemmed with distant stars which
gave faint mysterious light. And issuing from the interior was per-
petual murmuring, as of mighty winds at a great distance.
They dismounted from their golden steeds, and stood in fear and
hesitation at the portals of the Cavern; for coming from realms of
brightness, they were in terror of the unknown vague dusk within,
and mysterious whisperings. At last they entered, trembling!
They beheld therein an unknown presence who was seated on a
massive ancient-looking throne of ebony; a being large and powerful,
and of serene and noble countenance, with great deep eyes that seemed


CAVERN OIF THE WINDS
to gaze far back into the Ages. He was leaning forward with his
elbows resting on his knees, his chin supported in his strong cupped
hands, as he intently meditated on the strange sounds of the Cavern.
For he was hearkening unto the beating Heart of all the World!
As the seven Messengers came further inwards, they heard more
distinctly these far-away murmurings, till by degrees they became
voices of mighty Winds, echoes of distant restless seas, the subdued
roar of storms, and sound of heavy waves breaking on rocky shores.
At times there was only the gentle sighing of soft breezes, or
murmuring of people. Prayers of thousands, troubled cries of
myriads, sobs, laughter, sighs! And the thoughts of the Genius on
what he heard appeared on the dark purple background studded with
dim stars ?sometimes in swift flashes, sometimes in occasional sus-
tained pictures, as though he dwelt long over some of his thoughts.
There were clear views of beautiful wooded countries, or of fields
of ripening grain. Of shingled sands and gently-breaking wavelets.
Of storms at sea and wrecking ships, wheeling sea-birds and high-
tumbling billows. Of blizzards in the icy North, land-storms in the
West. Of peaceful scenes or battles. Of busy towns and crowds of
weary strugglers. Toilers of the sea, tillers of the sod, and workers
of the city. Of glad or saddened crowds. Of gay and mirthful, or
of pitifully-sobbing little children. The Genius, all-unobservant of
unwonted visitors, sat motionless, intently hearkening unto this great
beating Heart that was never still!
As the Sun?s Messengers now timidly approached his throne, he
slowly raised his massive-looking head and gazed upon them wonder-
ingly. For even in this dimness they appeared so bright!
To him they said:? 'The Sun God greets you by us. Hear his
message to thee!??


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
Then said the Genius;??We thank our Golden Brother for his
greetings! What is his desire? How can we pleasure him??
?He entreats you to awaken his loved Sea-Nymph! Send the
Winds to endow her with touches of all parts of the world?and thus
bring her to life! She lies basking in perpetual tempered sunshine and
a breathless atmosphere, slow ripples of almost-tideless seas surround-
ing her. No balmy breezes stir the air, no bright flowers bloom; there
are no feathered songsters, or any other signs of life than mere growths
of beautiful strange foliage. No living creature exists upon the Isle,
And even the lazy ripples of the sea move scarcely shorewards!?
?The changes must come gradually,? said the Genius thought-
fully; ?each phase in turn. And this Island will ever be unusual and
unique. Return unto the Sun God, offer him our greetings; tell him
his desires shall all be granted in due season. I will send my Winds
unto the Isle, each in their course!?
The seven Messengers then left the Cavern, mounted again their
shafts of light, and returned gladly to the Sun God with the answer
of the Genius of all the Winds!

PART 11.
THE AWAKENING
EPHYR had arrived upon the Isle! The soft Spring
breeze sent as her forerunner by the balmy Southern
Wind had come hither to weave her spell! Sweet
and fresh as the new-budding clusters of faintly-scented
blooms she carried in her arms, her delicate wings a?
flutter, she alighted on the turf. On her light robe of
palest green, pink, white, and yellow blossoms tangled themselves, as
the flowers she bore drooped lightly from her clasp.
Zephyr gazed around her! It was very calm and still. The
strange noiseless ripple of the waters was the only sign of life. There
was now not even a breath or faintest sound. She let her clustering
blossoms fall upon the turf, and with a graceful movement raised her
shapely hands and arms, as she uttered a soft call. And now, for the
first time upon the Isle, the perpetual bright sunshine vanished and a
faint shadowy twilight gradually came. Then arose the first Moon in
this odourless Evening?the faintest lines of a new little crescent-
moon emerging above the tree-tops! And some distant faintly-glim-
mering stars appeared in the slowly-darkening sky.


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
Zephyr softly sang:?
ZEPHYR?S SONG.
?The light grows dim, vague spectres are all that can now be seen?
The ghostly gums, the palm-tree fronds, in vista of the green.
O! muse upon the mystery of Nature?s softened light,
As Evening draws her veil around in shadow?d hush of Night!??
In the magic hush of this first evening, white vague forms of mist
gathered slowly beneath the growing moonlight? strange unwonted
sprites of night? mere ethereal phantoms caused by the faint shadows.
Then, these shadows deepening, the moonlight vanished, and soft grey
shimmering Night veiled all in mystery. All around were young
breezes gently whispering and sighing. And this was the first coming
of Night unto the Isle.
Later the first new, pale Day-spring came, sweeping from the sky
the tiny stars, and turning the smooth sea to silver. For at the gentle
lingering touch, light fragrant breath, and soft call of Zephyr darkness
passed, and the Sleeping-Nymph began to half-stir, trembling in her
sleep I
Earth, air, and sea seemed each alive and moving faintly with
an almost imperceptible tremor of coming life growing gradually
stronger. A lazy ripple of water first caressed the untouched sands.
Then other murmuring little ripples of the half-awakening sea crept
slowly and timidly at edges of the beaches?for not yet were tides to
come, or ebb and flow.


THE AWAKENING
Now tender leaves of trees in palest sunlight began to timidly
unfold. It was as though the Nymph had gently turned her head and
drawn a long deep breath of Zephyr?s fragrant breeze!
Water, earth, and air were now all stirring as with presage of new
change to come. The Isle indeed was just beginning to awaken from
the Sun God?s spell!
"I can do no more!? sighed Zephyr wistfully. ?It is beyond my
power to quite awaken this enchanted Island! South Wind must
come!??
A sound of sweeping wings, a delicious trill of cjiildish laughter,
and South Wind appeared with baby zephyrs, descending from above.
In radiant bright beauty she alighted gently on the turf. Exotic, lan-
guorous, her wings were laden with rich breezes. Baby zephyrs were
still around her, whilst others clung to Zephyr?s robes, or sported
merrily on the green grass. Their dimpled little hands were filled with
seeds or scented grasses.
The sun shone brightly now, and a gentle wind lifted foliage of
trees, whilst young leaves sprouted boldly forth. The big bush seemed
laughing with joy!
South Wind said to Zephyr:??l have followed you in turn, com-
ing hither from my visit unto temperate and sunny zones. My babes
have gathered there these seeds and grasses to enrich this country.?
They stood hand in hand together, surveying lovingly the Island,
the airy little zephyrs clustering around them. South Wind raised her
head, repeating more urgently in sweet and mellow tone fair Zephyr?s
former call. On sunny beaches then was heard the sound of water
breaking crisply on the rocks and creeping on with murmuring long


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
ripples, moving with slow and gentle, but resistless tide towards the
sands, and gradually gathering a greater force beyond, where was the
dark blue of the sea.
The wandering South Wind had brought with her an unknown
faint aroma, and the drowsy vegetation seemed responsive to this
atmosphere. Trees in the big immensity of lonesome scrub began to
rustle fitfully in light wind, which was also rippling little pools that
were forming on the beaches, and stirring languidly the reeds and
grasses that spread out in front of them. The drowsy stillness was
definitely broken by splash of water on the sands. There were now
dim stretches of land as seen through mist on either side of bays, and
continuous thin ripples of wavelets on their shores. Slow natural
movement had at last begun of faint ebb and flow!
The baby zephyrs cast their seeds and grasses on the wind, which
lightly lifted them and bore them near and far into the bush. Rays
of warmer sunlight now struck in amongst the shadows of dull grey-
blue of Gum-trees, on their trunks and fragile network of the twigs; and
on thorny shrubs and spear-like growths in some parts beneath the
trees.
Zephyr started dancing exquisitely on the turf, and baby zephyrs
fluttered on their downy wings up to the tree-tops, circling around
lightly and singing joyously:?
?Blow on, blow on, you little breeze,
When Zephyr lightly dances.
And stir the foliage of trees.
As right and left she glances!?
As they sang the gentle wind sent a long delicious shivering
through foliage, and Zephyr danced her graceful measure unto its soft
sighing as tree-tops rocked in it. The air was crystal clear, but the


THE AWAKENING
blue sky got misty here and there and soon was slightly flecked with
small fleecy clouds, some of which grew bigger. The infant zephyrs,
looking upward, now resumed their singing:?
?Above, white clouds went sailing in the sky,
They fleck?d with varied shades the trees and grass,
Just for a moment, as they flickered by,
Blown lightly on by South Wind?s breath to pass.?
The gaiety of morning sunshine and the glittering sea where tiny
waves were slightly dancing and swaying had filled them with delight,
and South Wind said:?
?Our work is done! Now is it East Wind?s turn I?
A breath of hot wind swept past?a sound came of great rushing
wings; then a dark-faced Arab paused overhead on his steed of purest
desert-breed?its hovering wings outspread as he leaned over, looking
downwards at the Isle, rapt in deep thoughts of dazzling heat of the
vast deserts he had lately left. East Wind?s countenance was hard and
stern, his breath as hot as furnace. He turned his quick fierce eyes
right and left, as he awoke from reverie. His face softened and he
shook his head.
?I come from boundless plains and an immensity of sterile tracts
where I gathered their fiery breath. But I will take away my over-
powering heat to form in isolated parts the wastes. There shall only
be hot stretches of half-desert with a golden sun blazing overhead.
And I will leave untouched these fairer parts!?


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
He drew his robe about his face to keep his hot breath from
the Isle, and sped swiftly on his way beyond.
South Wind said happily to Zephyr:?? East Wind also loves this
country'! See! He will not sear its beauty, spoil its freshness! He
will confine to certain wastes his fiercer moods.?
Now South Wind and Zephyr sang together:?
NORTH WIND COMES!
?O! now the air is chill?d by Wintry breezes,
With many a gust that sharply whips and stings,
The drooping foliage, as all warmth freezes?
Lo! North Wind comes on pure snow-plumaged wings!?
Upon an icy atmosphere did North Wind come with his young
daughter Snow-Sprite. Hand in hand they flew together, then paused
hovering above the Island on their frost-rimed wings. The Wind of
Farthest North was singing and swaying with mighty breath the
branches of great Gum-trees. As he descended their bark was
loosened with the cold wind coming from him, and trees shed some
leaves for the first time as their stripped covering hung in tattered rib-
bons all a?flutter, from trunks and boughs.
He stood with his pale and beautiful young daughter leaning
against his shoulder as they thoughtfully surveyed the lovely scenes
around them. He wore rime on his white beard, and his breath was
very frosty. Both of them were garbed in robes of snowdrift hung
with glittering icicles which, melting in sunshine, trickled to the ground,


THE AWAKENING
forming small pools; these overflowing soon grew into little laughing
creeks. There was a momentary flash as sunlight caught these spark-
ling threads of silver streams which, vanishing from view amidst the
scrub, rambled merrily along!
Said North Wind to his daughter:?"l will only lightly touch this
Isle at seasons, reserving certain parts for real severity of wintry
rigours.?
As he spoke a cold but gentle wind began sighing through the
trees, telling them of a genial, kind Winter, as a few leaves fluttered
to the ground.
?Behold! Leaves shall not fall here altogether,? North Wind
said. ?There shall be scent of only mild decay and slight chill of
tempered Autumn. Trees shall wear their foliage almost in full all
the year round! We love too well this favoured Isle to create a dreary
Winter. We will confine our frozen breath to parts where ice and
snow shall rule; and storms shall sometimes rage on mountain-tops and
the high plains. Snow-Sprite meantime shall wake the waterfalls and
rivulets, and direct upon their course the future mighty rivers.?
So saying, he flew away alone on frost-rimed pinions to form the
icy plains of which he spoke.
Snow-Sprite also sped away; in passing she touched lightly with
her finger-tips, lingering lovingly here and there, the cliffs and over-
hanging rocks at edges of the valleys.
The crystal streams sang from the rock o?er mossy
ledge to pour!
Upspringing ferns with varied forms and grace,
were scatter?d o?er.


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
There was lilting music as of water rippling through crevices and
over stones, then waterfalls gushed forth and bounded down into the
gullies far below. Wherever rested her finger-tips, came the springing
rush of waters. Here and there, with lusty joy leapt a cascade down a
mountain side. Then a shower of whiter cascades with feathering
foam came also leaping joyously, at play with little snow-sprites laugh-
ing in them. And misty spray-wreaths sailed away upon light wind.
Whilst rills of water were soon whispering and gurgling from the hills.
Still was there a murmuring of strongly-running water invisible
from where Snow-Sprite went; and presently it trickled from the rocks
on ferns and bushes near by, sprinkling them with sparkling rain-
drops. Then down a hill tumbled suddenly a lusty bubbling stream,
as it laughed and danced in sunshine, going on its way to join with
many others, and at last to form some mighty river!
Still blue peaks of distant mountains were varied by a pretty play
of lights and shadows of the passing clouds in sunlight.
Twilight now was gathering. The valley below was changing
from dusk to dark. There was a song of living water ?and the Moon
rising over the heights, its rays shone on a spraying waterfall, turning
its ripples into a shower of emeralds!

PART 111.
WHAT THE STORM-WIND
BROUGHT
EST-WIND, beating heavily with his immense dark
wings, tore along at his best speed, laughing with
wild delight at tumult of the waves which he
created with his breath. He was a shaggy giant,
his long hair tangling in his beard and falling to his
waist, all flecked with foam from this mad racing
with the storms across the seas. Fierce gusts were tearing at it now,
as he rushed furiously in the driving rain, shouting aloud unto the
wilder elements.
He wafted before him a great varied flock of helpless birds; for
on his way he had passed a group of unknown and unpeopled islands,
each one inhabited by a different species of birds. Two genies of the
lesser kind were quarrelling together over division of these Isles, and
the birds, disturbed from peace, were fluttering distressfully above
their leafy homes when Storm-Wind passed, and many of them were
blown with irresistible force before him on the blast as he took his
way unto the Sun God?s Isle.


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
He shouted to the Storm:??l bring from the Far West the swel-
ling breaths of roaring Land-storms and of Sea-storms, many a league
away! Now gusty winds shall blow upon the Island, and rains descend
in torrents!?
On he came, tearing boisterously by, still wafting over seas the
birds. He carried with him whiffs of strong salt air direct from dis-
tant oceans.
Arriving at the Isle he caused the storm he had created to rage
around the coasts, and heavy rains to fall upon the land. A breezy
gust skirled past. The high winds stripped the tree-trunks bare and
their stems showed tall and sombre. The sky was dark and threaten-
ing, with fresh rush of wind, followed by crash of thunder and sound
of falling rain; whilst blue lightning-flashes pierced the sullen clouds.
Then he departed satisfied, still roaring, on his way home to Cavern of
the Winds, to tell their Genius what he had done to help the full
awakening of the Sleeping-Nymph!
The rough winds continued blowing landwards from the ocean
long after West-Wind had departed. Heavy rain fell ceaselessly for
days and nights. Whiffs of strong coast air had freshened all the
land, and wreckage from trees now lay about upon the ground. .. .
Then the storm passed!
The hapless birds, rejoiced at reaching a safe haven on the Isle,
had perched upon the boughs of trees, drooping drearily in flooding
rains which fierce wind was driving through the gullies. When the
v-ind dropped and it cleared again, trees were still dripping long after
the storm had passed away. The sun peeped out, and by-and-bye
shone brightly, and the birds cried lustily unto its glory.
A bird called from a tree; another near by answered it. The
birds at a little distance all gathered together now in solemn conclave,
perched on a great Gum-tree to discuss the situation, the unwonted
storm, and recent happenings. In glowing sunshine all preened their


WHAT THE STORM-WIND BROUGHT
feathers contentedly, making friends with one another and learning
each other?s names. They basked happily in the warmth, telling how
glad they were the storm was over, and how pleasant was the sun-
shine. The Kookooburra especially had much to say, constituting
himself their President; and the noisy little Parrots chattered inces-
santly together, uttering their notes in concert.
They noticed presently a restless stranger in singular-looking
plumage of black-and-white, who was flying about persistently, taking
short flights amidst the trees. The Kookooburra named him Magpie,
on account of his pied coat. The Parrots instantly caught up the
note of ?Magpie! Magpie!?? till the silent bush rang with their cries.
The strange bird wheeled about upon his wings and perched on an
adjacent tree, observing them attentively with his bright watchful eyes.
Then he renewed his short uneasy flights amongst the trees, until the
Kookooburra called to him.
?Whence came you?? he asked urgently, when the stranger had
come near. ?I never saw your kind before!?
?I came from an island many leagues away. I was disturbed
from rest by Genies quarrelling, and taking a longer flight than usual
just when Storm-Wind was rushing past, I was caught up upon his
breath and carried here upon my useless wings!?
?We were all blown hither from the group of islands!? said the
Kookooburra.
Some sun-brightened tufts of red young Gum leaves caught
Magpie?s quick eyes, and off he flew again to carefully inspect them.
Returning presently with signs of disappointment, he approached once
more the other birds.
?Why are you so restless?? asked the Kookooburra wonderingly.
?Is not this a pleasant country we have visited??


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
I he Magpie now broke into liquid warbling and delightful trilling,
quite a different sound from the strange note of the Kookooburra and
the Parrots? cry.
Because there are no flowers on this Isle I?? he trilled. ?1 want
to see some flowers here I??
?What are flowers? asked the Kookooburra.
?Sweet-smelling blooms, or gaily-tinted blossoms!? sang the
Magpie eagerly. ?Beautiful flowers abound upon my native island,
growing on trees and shrubs amidst their leaves. They are of differ-
ent colours and delightful odours! I have sought about upon this
Isle and I can find no flowers!?
The Kookooburra began to meditate about the matter. A little
grey Owl with big wise eyes struck in:?
?I recollect our old grandfather at home once telling us that in
the centre of each country exists a Spirit that has certain power over it.
There may be one somewhere in the heart of this big bush, if you could
only find it. It might give you flowers!?
Magpie at once set forth upon his search, flying long distances,
seeking eagerly the imagined Spirit of the Country. At last he found
the heart of the bush, and came upon a lovely ethereal creature who
was slumbering in a clear space amidst its tangled depths, under a big
tree which bore myriad leaves of many coloured hues. The sweet
breath of unseen flowers was in the air, where foliage most thickly
shadowed the dusky ncok of the retreat where the Spirit of the bush
was lying at rest. Attired in filmy green, her profuse fair hair, caught
in a graceful wreath of leaves, had fallen lightly around her. A faint
breeze ruffled the sleeper?s hair and a tendril of a flowerless creeper
gently swayed against her delicately-blooming cheek. At the clear
melody of Magpie she awoke and sat up drowsily to look at him. He
had perched upon a bough of a tree near by, warbling gently to her:?


WHAT THE STORM-WIND BROUGHT
?O now that stormy times are past,
And dreams come true,
This slumb?ring Isle awakes at last?
And so must you!?
The Spirit of the Bush sprang quickly to her feet, exclaiming:?
You seem to come forth from my dreams! Why have you awakened
me? What do you want? To him that arouses me from slumber
must I grant the first request?for so was it decreed when I sank into
my long rest!?
I want flowers here! the Magpie trilled deliciously. ?The bush
is incomplete without the flowers!?
Yes, the bush indeed is incomplete,? the Spirit answered; ?for
1 lay down to sleep ere my work was finished, and I?ve been sweetly
dreaming ever since.?
She gazed upwards at the big tree and sang:?
SONG OF BUSH-SPIRIT.
?Quit your leafy shelter,
Downwards, helter-skelter,
From the tree above fall lightly on green turf below!
Lo! I call my Flowers
From their shady bowers.
On this lonesome Bush their fresh gay brightness to bestow!?
Instantly the leaves began to flutter gently. Then some of them
detached themselves from the twigs. What her visitor had taken to
be gaily-tinted foliage were really little elves, each one differently
garbed in coloured dress, and each one wearing on their head a cap of
corresponding blossom. At her call the elves spread gauzy wings
and then sprang from the mystic tree, alighting on the turf around the
Spirit of the Bush.


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
One little Elf in shabby thorny garb shrank timidly from his com-
panions. They laughed heartily at his strange dull coat, so unlike their
pretty costumes of varied hues. Scorned by all the others, he sadly
crept away and hid himself in the densest of the scrub, and wept. And
when he wept delicious fragrance penetrated through the place. All
wondered whence it came!
Then the Spirit said:??l miss one of my Elfins!? and she called
him gently by his name.
At her summons he came trembling from the shadowed tangles
of his shelter, his spiky costume torn and ragged, his small face tear-
stained as he came to view, and tears dewing his dull garb as they
rolled from his cheeks. Still an exquisite perfume arose on the warm
air, and all the other Elfins, mystified, inhaled it with delight. The
Spirit of the Bush stretched out her hand and drew him to her side.
?You have distilled scent by the sweetness of your tears! You
shall creep into sterile places, or abide in densely-growing scrub, and
so perfume the air. Though scorned by your companions, still you
possess the rarest fragrance of them all! Rest in content within the
hidden and sequestered nooks. Your thorny garb unseen, you shall
be known and loved for that by all who may pass near!?
Then she sent the other Flower Elfins fluttering joyously away to
their appointed places, to take root and grow.
But when afterwards she called the Nut-Elves, a pattering of
myriads of tiny feet rustled back and forth amidst the foliage of trees
and shrubs, as Nut-Elfins dropped some leaves upon a creek near by.
First a leaf fluttered down upon the water and became a little boat; an
Elf sprang into it, for sail held one unfolded wing. Then came the
sound of many dropping nuts, as other Elfins also sprang on leaves
thrown from above, and all using them as little boats they raced each
other down the stream and sailed away!

GIFT.

PART IV.
THE STORM-KING?S GIFT
HE King of the Sea-Storms had heard rumours of the
Island, and resolved to visit there himself in his next
Royal Progress. People of the Earth call these the
Great Sea-storms because so few of them possess the
gift of inner vision and the power divine of true per-
ception.
The Royal Progress to the Isle was in full swing! Great waves
rose high, a wild reckless swirl of waters thundering along. And all
the Winds at once seemed to be loose! Gales came from South-East.
Strong breezes from the West. Strange sweet wild singing came with
wind blowing from the North. Huge billows crowned with foam were
tumbling and racing along at furious speed. And these were the
King?s Sea-horses, shaking their white manes of high-blown clouds of
spray.
Then came nearer to the Isle the Royal Progress on the seas.
Stern-faced, grand and terrible, the majestic Ocean King in all his glory
guided, standing with a foot on each, two spirited snow-white steeds


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
?with six-in-hand racing full-speed in front of them, scarce restrained
even by his powerful hands upon the reins. Tossing high their beauti-
ful wild heads and glistening manes the Sea-horses swept along on
crests of wildest billows.
Mermen swam by, blowing conch-shells as trumpets. Porpoises
and Sea-Gnomes sported merrily in the great procession. Beautiful
Mermaids from the North, with their flowing wind-blown hair, and
riding upon Dolphins, were still singing their wild sweet storm-songs,
blending with equally wild music of the wind. All tossed on together
in rhythmical turmoil with high-leaping waves, far-driven sprays, and
dazzling seething foam! It was a glorious vision?the grandeur and
beauty of it indescribable.
The sharp salt tang and freshness of open oceans were delicious,
as wind came soughing and wafting across wide waters strange sea-
birds. For the Storm King had shaken from his glistening cloak some
flakes of foam. And lo! these flakes became myriads of white-winged
gulls! The wind blew these sea-birds in great flocks amidst the storm,
and they came fluttering and screaming in the gusts towards the land!
Some young and half-trained horses as they neared the Isle had
broken loose from the King?s restraining hands as he shook free the
sea-birds from his cloak, and they had left their places in the ranks of
the Cavalcade. The King commanded the Mermaids to secure them
in line with big breakers forming near the coasts. Often had the
Mermaids sported with these horses on the seas and at their call, neigh-
ing gladly, they came to their beckoning hands, arching their necks to
their caresses, and permitting them to fasten them where they desired.
And this was the first stationing of great rolling breakers on the coasts!
The King approached the land! There was loud booming of
restless seas, the crash and roar of chained Sea-horses as they vainly
strove to break their bonds and follow the Cavalcade. Their proud
heads were tossed high, their white manes erect as they rushed forward


THE STORM KING?S GIFT
at full length of their tethers, striving by fruitless wild endeavour to
release themselves.
Big waves exploded with noise of thunder against rocky cliffs;
shoreward-rolling waters breaking for the first time on the beaches.
An immense wave gathering flung itself headlong landwards, crowned
with feathering crests reflected in its trough and its deep hollows.
Then all the Cavalcade swept up together with a tumult of wild billows,
in one overwhelming rush high up upon a beach, the salt waves washing
up still higher, seas encroaching even on the land itself, thus forming
the first great tidal wave, and bringing to the Isle the Storm King?s
gift of living tides and currents, and strong ebb and flow.
The Storm King said:?? This shall become henceforth our regu-
lar Royal Progress to this Island?we will come again and
cause the tidal wave at certain times to invade upon the land. Now
shall Sea-Gnomes and the Mermaids labour here to make these sands
appear like those of other countries. The Gnomes shall also build
me coral palaces and form sea-caves below the water. And I will send
my son to this fair Isle to people these seas, and to endow it with the
priceless gift of Mythical Legend 1?
So saying did the King depart, and presently descended to the
ocean depths. And it was as though the storm were now subsiding.
The breakers rolled more peacefully; the great combers became tran-
quil; salt sprays leapt up less violently at the cliffs; the prisoned horses
reared their wild heads less, and almost ceased to struggle at their
tethers. The first Sea-storm was over!
The sun shone brightly on crests of small dancing waves, the
brimming splash of hitherto unknown living tides the Sea-storm had
bestowed upon these tideless seas, was pleasant with its crisp frills


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
of foam. Now could be heard the drowsy ripples of waves going
shoreward, breaking gently on the strands. The sea murmured cease-
lessly as it curled lovingly upon the beaches.
The Mermaids and Sea-Gnomes were busily engaged in bring-
ing up from ocean-deeps all kinds of beautiful shells and seaweeds, and
arranging them tastefully on rocks and beaches; and also below the
water, to take root and grow. Swarms of different kinds of fish and
smaller sea-fry followed them.
Forth from these shells came springing grasshoppers, ants, and
other creeping things; all went up into the bush to people it each
after their own kind. Then pods of seaweeds and of sea-fruits burst;
butterflies and moths and other tiny winged things issuing from them,
also flew into the bush.
At first the Sea-Gnomes helped the Mermaids decorate the
beaches, but becoming mischievous they soon began to play their usual
elfish tricks?bringing up sea-creatures in great shells, and sea-eggs too;
and they amused themselves by poking out strange animals; with shrill
laughter driving them in mocking imitation of the Mermaids with the
butterflies and insects up into the scrub.
Sea-Gnomes and Mermaids still come to the sands at stormy
seasons and arrange the shells and seaweeds we find strewn about. At
times of the great tidal wave they carefully uncover on the beaches
buried treasures lost by people close by in the water, cast up afterwards
by the sea and hidden in the sand. Those who have the gift of inner
vision to perceive can then behold the People of the Sea!
Now, to complete their work at their new Island, the Mermaids
joyously found their way up winding reaches of the big lagoons that
had been formed by overflowing of incoming tides. They drifted


THE STORM-KING?S GIFT
happily together on the currents, enticing sea-fry and the fish to follow
them, and singing a new song:?
MERMAIDS? SONG.
(On the Lagoon.)
The water?s cool and calm, the sunshine?s bright and warm,
A soft breeze wakes on faces fair to blow,
And clear our voices ring as with the tide we swing,
With rhythmic sweep of white arms as we go!
The fishes leap and splash with many a silver flash,
The Sun casts thro? the water golden rays?
Now in winding reaches come to sandy beaches
Of miniature and dainty fairy bays!
?The water?s dark and deep where lies the bank so steep?
'Tis shallow where it sports and suns by day?
?Tis dark where strength for best it gathers when at rest,
?Tis shallow where the little wavelets play!
O?er reeds and rushes tall to hover, settle, fall,
The butterflies above them linger yet?
The bush is full of life, the sedge with life is rife,
And all is living where the waters fret!?

PART V.
THE COMING OF THE PRINCE
OW was all still and peaceful on the Island save for
sound of ebb and flow of tides, and the Moon was
rising high above the ocean. The Mermaids flocked
together to teach the seas around them to obey their
singing. They floated restfully, singing in sweet
unison the first part of their song
SONG OF THE SEA.
?Breathe softly, gentle breeze,
Upon the moonlit wave?
The impetus thou gave
Scarce stirs the curling seas!??
The waves moved dreamily beneath the moonbeams and the
gentlest zephyr blew. Presently the moon was veiled as by dark clouds
and soon the air grew close and breathless with stillness that spoke of
coming storm, as each Mermaid raised high her left hand and began
the next part of the song:?


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
??Blow, blow, ye wild winds, blow,
With gusty main and might,
Blow thro? the stormy night,
And lay proud vessels low!?
A sharp salt tang came over the close atmosphere, followed by
stronger gusts; rain fell, a greater wind blew suddenly, and a gale
arose. Then all the Mermaids raised high both hands as they swam
together in the raging seas, and it seemed as though they came upon a
storm-tossed vessel. Still singing with wild sweetness they played
gaily with the storm their song had raised, mounting in joyous unre-
strained delight on crests of tossing waves and flinging foam about like
driven snow.
?O thunder on, ye gale.
Wreck ships that dash along
Unto thy thunder-song?
The trembling ships that sail!?
The storm rose gradually higher, and the wind blew yet more
strongly. Waves dashed thundering along at utmost speed. There
seemed to be an echoing sound of crashing spars and helpless cries
somewhere at seal
They still sang on:?
??Stir up the thund?rous seas,
Till gainst the cliffs they dash
With foaming spume and splash?
Then sink to rest, O breeze!?


THE COMING OF THE PRINCE
Waves now dashed foaming on the rocks, high-leaping at the
cliffs above; then gradually sank to rest again as the Mermaids sang
very softly the last part of their song and gently waved their hands:?
?Soft whisper, winds that sigh,
And rock them unto sleep,
Upon the slumbrous deep,
That on thy bosom lie!"
Once more the seas soughed drowsily; the winds had dropped
into a zephyr?whispering?and a pearly dawn began to show in the
now cloudless sky!
A solitary Mermaid, shielding her eyes from the early sun with
her white hands, gazed long and earnestly at the horizon. She sang
to summon her companions:?
?I see a ship sailing o?er the sea,
So lightly lying?
Her white wings swelling gracefully
With soft winds sighing!"
All the other Mermaids hastened to her at the call. Far out at
sea showed a sailing ship, coming gradually nearer. The first vessel
had approached the Island!
They swam swiftly out towards her, and when nearer to her saw
the beautiful build and graceful curves of some antique design from


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
the Far North. Unseen by sailors on the ship, the Mermaids guided
her to the Island, and she anchored in a charming bay.
The people aboard were very fair, or red-haired. One amongst
them seemed to be a King. His young daughter was beside him,
garbed in colours delicately gay. A beautiful and winsome maiden
she, wearing on her brow the golden circlet of a Princess. White as
a lily, with faint rose-flush in her cheeks, and sparkling violet eyes.
Dark rippling wavy hair fell upon her shoulders. She seemed some-
times elfish-looking like the Mermaids, but to her father showed a
maid?s warm loyal heart.
The Princess disappeared below. By-and-bye she came again on
deck. A little skiff with luxurious rich cushions was now lowered and
made ready for her use, and she lightly took her place in it and paddled
away easily from the ship?s side, coming to a beautiful secluded nook.
MEETING!
The Mermaids drew nearer and nearer?
Fhis vision so sweet pleased their eyes?
Her beauty their fancy had captured,
Winds carried their songs with their sighs.
Their white arms were lifted to clasp her.
Entreating her presence a? near?
The stranger turned quickly towards them,
Her interest mingled with fear!
Possessing the rare gift of poetry and inner vision, the Princess
had soon discerned them. And this was the beginning of her close
friendship with the People of the Deep! She soon learnt all they


THE COMING OF THE PRINCE
knew about the Island, the tidal wave, and their own arrival. And
in delicately gay short garb soon she swam about with them as grace-
fully as any Mermaid, her beautiful white arms a?gleam in sunlight.
Now, by this time had arrived the young son of the Storm
King, sent thither by his father to rule the seas around the Isle. And
the Princess one day diving, unawares came face to face with him in a
clear pool. When she rose again to breathe, the King?s son followed
her, and they sat side by side on a rock above the pool and held con-
verse together, for they had loved each other at first sight with a great
love!
They often met again at the same spot. The ship of the Princess
was soon to sail away, and she told the Prince of this. He entreated
that she would remain behind and wed him. They were seated on
the rock above her favourite diving-pool, and he was holding in his
fingers a pale sea-flower he had brought with him, culled from some
sequestered spot far below in deepest ocean.
He turned towards her, saying earnestly:?? This delicate blossom
renders people of the Earth immune from perils of the deep?making
them Mer, or of the Sea! It creates complete forgetfulness of all their
past! Will you accept from me this flower, and be my bride??
Now, this charming Princess from the North was naturally Elfin
like the Mermaids; but still at heart was she true Maiden. She adored
her father though all her early recollections were already nearly swept
away by overwhelming love for the Sea Prince. Yet was she sad at
thought of being separated from the Northern King.
But the Prince began to tell her of his own sea-home:?
?My busy Gnomes have built around the wilder portions of the
coast, far below the level of the water, a vast and beautiful palace of


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
pure coral. Amidst fairy-like scenes arises this wondrous structure,
erected for me at command of the Storm King, my father. It is a
dream of delight! There are towers and terraces of red, pink, and
white corals. Gardens bloom with flowers of the sea, and seaweeds
of different hues. Tinted murmuring-shells adorn the exquisite interiors
of the palace and give unceasing music. One specially wonderful
tower of red coral is dedicated to my future Queen; and also a lovely
bower of delicately coloured floating weeds, and branches of coral
trees. This bower is lavishly decorated with the largest and most
lustrous of my emeralds.
?My bride will possess the rarest jewels of the ocean; she will
wear a necklace of pure chosen pearls, whilst chains of precious seed-
pearls will be woven for adornment in her flowing hair. And she will
have a comb and mirror of the purest pearl-shell.
?You have learnt already from the Mermaids of our splendid
Royal Progresses upon the seas, and of the joys we gain by rising to
the level of the tossing waves and sporting there!
?A beautiful silvery light floods the sea where are the Gardens.
Here are vast groves of big branched coral-trees, planted by the Sea-
Gnomes; and others of tall waving seaweeds somewhat like bamboos.
About here swim shimmering silver fish in clear translucent water,
some of them with gleaming coats of opal sheen, and others yet with
glinting golden flashes. Strangely-elegant sea-creatures fly like birds
in and out amongst the winding avenues, some of them singing a
strange little song with soft crooning note. Further on sea-fruits and
glistening bright berries grow on differently tinted floating weeds.
When these are ripe they burst, and lovely little creatures issue from
them, each one having filmy wings of some different hue, to correspond
with the respective colour of the berried weeds from which they spring.


THE COMING OF THE PRINCE
SONG OF SEA PRINCE.
?Amongst Mermaids swimming fleetly,
Beyond the Ocean Deep,
The fairest of hand-maidens shall be thine
(Whilst soft lullabies sound sweetly)
Adoring watch to keep,
Aye guard, and tend, and love this
Queen of mine!?
?This will be our happy home in the deep sea if you will come
with me!"
With that, he offered her the pale salt Flower-of-Forgetfulness.
The Princess looked long and thoughtfully upon it, her love for her
father striving with her greater love for her Sea Prince.
She said wistfully:?? Give me yet a little time to gradually lose
dear memories and old loves of my heart! Let me return but once
meantime to say farewell unto my father! Our ship sails at dawn
to-morrow if there be a breeze!?
?Will you indeed return to me?? the Prince asked urgently.
?Fear not for my good faith! My father will not know that 1
am bidding him farewell?for he knows not of thee. I would gain
naught by telling him, for he has not the gift of inner vision to behold!?
?When you desire my presence,? said the Prince, ?come to this
pool, sit on the rock, and sing to me! I shall glean your message
through a murmuring ripple of the water, wherever I may be?and
1 will come to you!?


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
Returning for the last time to the vessel, the Princess from the
North mused long that evening as she stood alone on deck. When
stars gemmed the sky, she softly sang:?
MUSING!
?I feel thy presence when the stars are gleaming?
OI now indeed I know my dream is true!
And when Night slowly draws her dusky curtain,
I?m dreaming of the golden stars ?and youl?
At early dawn arose the young Princess, and seeking her sleeping
father, she bent tenderly over him and kissed his brow in silent fare-
well. Then she softly stole away, and entering her little skiff she
paddled from the ship?s side to the pool.
The vessel was already being prepared for their departure by
the sailors, and later they were ready to leave the bay where they had
anchored. Deeply mourning when they failed to find their Princess,
discovering the empty skiff which she had sent adrift, and believing
some unfortunate mischance had come to her, after some time vainly
spent in search, the grieving King at last set sail without her.
As the ship moved away in the light breeze the waves reflected
delicate opals of clear dawn that, spreading in the sky, soon lighted up


THE COMING OF THE PRINCE
the wide expanse of sea. The Mermaids swam beside, unseen, un-
heard by those aboard who, not being poets, were therefore visionless.
And they softly sang to the sailors their song of farewell:?
MERMAIDS? FAREWELL.
?Farewell! We speed you on your way!
Your ship again will never stray
In these far seas or this fair bay,
Till time be past!
Your fair Princess ?neath Oceans deep
In love and joy our Prince will keep?
Her sweet content shall never sleep?
Forever last I?
Thus came and thus departed the First Ship, And the sailors
never visited these seas again!
Meanwhile the young Princess stood alone above the pool, and
sweetly sang recall to her Sea Prince:?
SONG OF PRINCESS.
?O hasten to me
At our nook of meeting?
I keep my pledge
To call you to my side?
I?m waiting here
To give thee loving greeting,
And you shall claim
Me as your faithful Bride!?


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
And the charmed murmuring ripple of the water carried her song
away with it, and whispered her soft call into the ever-hearkening ears
of the Prince, who thereupon hastened to their meeting-place. When
he rose from the depths of the pool, he found her waiting for him on
the rock. With a triumphant laugh of joy, he sprang quickly to her
side, and kneeling at her little feet he offered her once more the pale
salt flower; and this time she refused it not!
With a great adoring love, the son of the Storm King at last took
the Princess in his arms, and sang:?
SONG OF SEA PRINCE.
?O love, so sweet and fair.
With all your beauty rare,
Bright eyes, and soft dark hair?
I fold you to my heart!
The sunlight o?er you streaming.
Your blue eyes softly gleaming
Seem as tho? sweetly dreaming!?
We meet now ne?er to part!?
He placed between her lips the Flower-of-the-Sea, and she
became a Mermaid, but like him retained her lovely little feet. She
felt no fear with him of the Unknown, remembering only her great
trust, and his great love of her.
Then side by side they dived into the pool, and soon were in a
great pellucid ocean-cave below, full of changing lights and shadows,
suffused to its watery depths with sunshine clear and bright! The
Princess clasped the Prince s hand in hers and rapturously sang:


THE COMING OF THE PRINCE
DAWN!
?Let Dawn of Rapture be my theme!
It yonder casts its golden gleam,
Here in this pool, to brighter seem,
And ever last!
A love that is wise, loving, just?
A love that 1 may ever trust?
A love to love me, as I must
Love thee as fast!?
He drew her closer to him as he answered her:?
SONG OF SEA PRINCE.
?This is our light of love and joy a?quiver?
Love?s Everlasting Flower has bloom?d for me!
As it enriches me?the happy giver?
So also, dearest, it enricheth thee!
For we are lost in sweetest Love?s Illusion,
And rapturous enchantment makes the whole?
Now we are two hearts lost in one by fusion,
Of Song and Melody within the Soul!?
Then they swam away together to his palace at the bottom of the
deep blue sea!

myriad leaves were whispering on the shrubs. The
twilight of the trees was slanted through by early sun-
beams, flickering on boughs of Gums and on the grass.
The Winds began to dance with exquisite daintiness and grace as they
sweetly sang together:?
SONG OF THE BUSH.
(Time o? Day!)
??O see the golden sunlight
Cast gleams athwart the shade;
And see the sparkling dew drops
Like diamonds on the blade!
O see the shadows parting?
Before the Sun they flee?
And now his warmth so genial
Creeps close ?round shrub and tree!
O! ?Tis Dayspring in the Bush!?


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
One clear thread of melody came across the peaceful hush of
the scrub. The sudden burst of a Magpie?s liquid warbling was
answered presently by other bird-calls. The sound of falling water
somewhere mingled with the trilling and the varied notes of birds.
The song of the Winds continued joyously:?
?0 hear the Bell-birds ringing,
And hear gay Parrots call?
The Magpie?s trill and warble
Most musical of all!
The Kookooburra?s laughing
At distance in the Bush?
With all these sounds is mingled
A waterfall?s clear rush!
O! ?Tis morning in the Bush!??
Great boughs were stirring slightly, making faint shadows as a
momentary breeze swept past. From beneath some drooping branches
came scent of some pale yellow flowers. There was mellow
radiance and spicy aroma of warm fern and Gum-trees. The sun
was high, the Bush laughed with light and warmth. A faint shifting
of light was on the bracken, a dance of shadow and sunlight on
Zephyr?s cloudy hair.
South Wind and Zephyr were still dancing in soft shadow of
tree as they sang on:?


AWAKENED!

?O see the cool green fernlets,
The bracken red and gold;
The She-Oaks slim and graceful,
The Gum-trees young and old.
Here brilliant blooms or Palms grow,
And there Rock-lilies bend?
As to the breeze their fragrance
Unstintingly they lend!
OI ?Tis noontide in the Bush!?
The Sun had set, and light grew fainter. Bird-calls had ceased,
only sleepy twittering came sometimes from the boughs. There was
brooding silence as twilight fell. The sweet voices of the Winds rose
once again in song as Voices of the Night:?
*?o see the shadows lengthen,
Nightshades begin to fall?
The notes of merry bird-life
Long since have ceas?d to call!
The light grows dim and misty,
Soft echoes seem to rise?
O hear the Night-wind murmur
Vague myst?ries with its sighs!
O! ?Tis Nightfall in the Bush!?
The scrub beyond soon lay in brilliancy of Moonlight. Breath
of Night-flowers bore their varied scents. The sea sparkled drowsily
in star-rays of the mystic Summer night.

EPILOGUE
ONTIDE again upon the Isle! The Scrub ablaze
with flowering shrubs, mingled with wild herbs and
grasses of the baby zephyrs? early sowing. The
call of birds and whirr of tiny winged things, hum-
ming of wild bees above some honeyed blooms, and
lilt of running waters, mingled with the gentle fretting of the waves;
for mixed with Bush-scents was the fresh salt tang of open sea.
BUSH SONG
O?er many a dainty nook was shade from trees of dusky green,
Where palm and gum-tree boughs there wove their cool delicious
screen.
Birds twitter?d ?midst the foliage, where feather?d young at rest
Were hid in mystic, peaceful nooks safe in each cosy nest!
A perfum?d Zephyr stirr?d the grass and fern with gentle shock,
Delicious fragrance wafted from the lily of the rock.
Where drooping boughs fell lightly o?er, touch?d by the gentle sigh
Of faintly-cooling wind that came and whispered softly by!


THE SLEEPING SEA NYMPH
Overhead white fleecy clouds played hide-and-seek with sun-
shine, and leaves of Gum-trees rustled languidly on a light breeze,
whilst brown-tinted She-Oaks sighed!
Over all was the joyous laugh of the golden Sun God?for his
Sleeping Sea-Nymph was at last all living and awake!
