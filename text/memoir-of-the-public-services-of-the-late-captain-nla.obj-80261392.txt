OF THE LATE
CAPTAIN JOHN SHORTHAND,
OF THE ROYAL NAVY.
? From tiie dust Ids laurels bloom,
High they shoot, and flourish 1'reej
Glory?s temple is the tomb !
Death is iiumortalit y,?
A LTIIOLGII no part of our naval history has equalled the
- L present in the number, the brilliancy, or the importance of
gallant achievements ; and rapidly as they pass in succession be-
fore our eyes, from the splendid victory of an admiral to the
unequal but successful combat of a commander of a packet, a
grateful and admiring country records them in her faithful page,
prepares a niche in the temple of fame for her hero, and embalms
him in our memory for the example and instruction of present and
future ages.
W here success crowns the conflict, no deductions are made from
its full portion ol praise; the public voice enters into no scrutiny;

victory sheds a dazzling lustre round the hero, and his brows are
decked with blooming laurels, which bid defiance to the noxious"
breath of envy, or the whisper of detraction. Ample credit is
given for the possession of resplendent talents, and personal ac-
quirements ; and he is hailed with acclamation in his road to fame
and fortune.
But when victory frowns upon him, and ceases to acknowledge
him for her child, it is natural to pause before we bestow the
maed of praise. If disaster be not a presumptive proof of miscon-
duct, it furnishes a reasonable ground for inquiry. Merit is then
weighed in a true balance; and it is only after justice has poised
the scales with a suspicious eye, and with impartial hand turns the
beam in his favour, that his name is rescued from shame and
oblivion, and enrolled in the annals of renown. If, however, his
fame be dearly bought, its value is enhanced, it brightens with
time, and dazzles the beholder. A recording angel plucks tho
quill from a seraph?s wing, and drops the tear of sympathy, whilst
he notes down, in the imperishable volume, the matchless deed ; and
points to the dying hero, the kindred spirits in the realms of glory
ready to receive his soul, and encircle his brows with an immortal
wreath.
If the subject of our memoir furnish few and scanty materials,
either for instruction or amusement; if his career be not distin-
guished by numerous or interesting traits of courage and skill , the
last scene of his valuable life will prove that it was the want of
opportunity alone, which was denied him by a train of circum-
stances over which he had no control, that prevented him from
contributing to the stock of naval glory. If the love of our
country, undaunted courage, ardent zeal, steady perseverance,
and a nice sense of honour, form the character of a British officer,
Captain Shortland yielded in these qualities to none that ever
adorned the page of history.
Captain Shortland, the subject of our immediate consider-
ation, was the son of an officer, who, by his professional merit,
was entitled to an earlier, and a higher promotion in the service,
than he obtained. Of that gentleman, with whom Captain
Shortland first went to sea, we find the following brief, but


honourable biographical notice, in Phillip?s Voyage to Botany
Bay ;? ,
Lieutenant John Shortland very early in life had a strong predilection
for the navy, and in 1755, at the age of sixteen, he entered into his Ma-
jesty s service, on board the Anson, a sixty*gun ship, which went out in
the fleet under the command of Admiral Boscawen. On the banks of
Newfoundland this fleet fell in with, and took the Alcide and Lys, two
French ships, of seventy-four guns. On his return from this expedition,
he went on board the Culloden, a seventy-four gun shin, and was in the
fleet under Admiral Byng, off Minorca. Shortly afterwards he went into the
Hampton Court,commanded by Captain Harvey, in which ship he was pre-
sent at the taking of the Foudroyant and Arp�. On his arrival in England,
he went on board the Vanguard, Commodore Swanton, to the West In-
dies, in the fleet under Admiral llodney, and was present at the reduction
of Martinique, the Grenades, and the other islands which were then cap-
tured. In 17 63, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant by Admiral
Swanton; since which period he has always been employed in active and
important services. During the late war, and for some time afterwards,
lie was chiefly employed in going to and from America, except in the year
1782, when he was appointed to command the transports with the 97th
regiment on board, destined for the relief of Gibraltar, under convoy of
his Majesty s ships Cerberus, and Apollo : he was not only successful in
getting ajl the transports in safe, but he also lauded the men without any
loss.
On Lieutenant Shortland?s return home from this service, in endea-
vouring to get through the Gulf of Gibraltar, in the night, he was chased
by a squadron of Spanish frigates, who took three of the transports in
company, but he was so fortunate as to escape in the Betsy transport, and
arrived safe in England, without either loss or damage. In the year 1786
.ie was appointed agent to the transports sent by government to New
South Wales, at which place he arrived in January, 1788. After remain-
ing six mouths at the new settlement at Port Jackson, he was ordered to
England by way of Batavia, by his Excellency Governor Phillip, who ho*
noured him with the official despatches for government, and he arrived ia
England on the 29th of May, 1789.*
Mr. Shortland, we believe, never attained a higher rank than
that of master and commander. What his subsequent service*
were, we know not; but, beloved and regretted by all who knew
him, he closed a life of honour and integrity, at the age of 67.
* It is due to departed merit to state, that the services of Lieutenant
Shortland, in New South Wales, were of a very active nature; and some
of the charts, &c. given in Phillip?s Voyage, are from surveys which he
c Lab:e ol the lloute of th� Alexander (the ship which he commanded)


He died at Lisle, in France, in the early part of the year 1803;
leaving a widow, two sons, and two daughters. It is deserving of
remark, that every male branch of the Shortland family has been
devoted to the naval service of the country.
the variation of the compass, and meteorological observations during the
voyage from Port Jackson to Batavia; and a detailed account ?drawn up,
we believe, from his own papers?of the proceedings on the voyage, and
the dreadful sufferings of his crew. It appears, that ? the Alexander, the
Friendship, the Prince of Wales, and the Borrowdale, were got ready in
the beginning of July, 1188, to sail for England, under the care and con-
duct of Lieutenant Shortland, at which time Governor Phillip took the
opinions of the masters of those transports concerning their route. The
season was thought to be too far advanced for them to attempt the
course, by Van Dierpen?s Land ; and tiie passage by Cape Horn was ob-
jected to by the Governor. It was therefore agreed unanimously that they
should go to the northward, either through Endeavour Straits, or round
New Guinea. Unfortunately the ships were ill prepared to encounter the
difficulties, which were to be expected in every'mode of return; their com-
plement of men was small, only six to an hundred tons, officers included;
they were without a surgeon, and unprovided with those articles which
have been found essential to the preservation of health in long voyages,
such as bore-cole, sour-crour, portable-soup, and the other antiseptics re-
commended by the Royal Society. It cannot be therefore wondered,
though it must be deeply regretted, that the sailors should have suffered so
dreadfully from the scurvy, in the length of time necessary for exploring a
passage through an unknown sea, perplexed with islands, where they were
destitute of assistance from charts, or observations of former navigators;
and were not fortunate enough to obtain a supply of salutary refreshments.?'
The Alexander left Port Jackson on the 14th of July, steering E.N.E,
intending to touch at Lord Howe Island, there to meet the other ships, and
appoint a place of rendezvous, in case of separation. She, however, lost
sight of the Prince of Wales, and the Borrowdale, on the 18th, and saw
them no more, they having steered a different course. The Friendship
continued close m company. About the 10th of August, the scurvy began
to shew itself; and, for want of proper remedies, it increased so rapidly,
that it was ultimately found necessary to sacrifice one of the ships, that
both of them might not be lost. Towards the latter end of September,
some deaths had happened in the Alexander, and scarcely any of her crew
vyere capable ot exertion ; but, in the Friendship, only one man was dis-
abled. By the 20fh of October, both of the crews were in a pitiable con-
dition. i'he Alexander had lost eight men, and was reduced to two men
in a watch ; only four seamen, and two boys, being at all fit for duty. The
Friendship had only hve men who were not disabled ; both of the ships
were short of provisions; and, as the western monsoon was expected soon
to set ic, it was agreed to destroy the Friendship, the smaller cf the two


John, the elder son, the lamented subject of this memoir, was
born on the sth of September, I?Q9; and, in 1781, at the age of
twelve, he took his first voyage with his father, who was then
going out to Quebec, in the capacity of agent for transports. At
vessels. She was accordingly cleared, bored, and turned adrift. The joint
crews now amounted to only thirty men, officers and boys included. On
the 29th of October, the Alexander got under weigh from off the coast of
Borneo. The sickness continued to increase; and, by the beginning of
November, only one man, besides the officers, was able to go aloft. ? Had
the Alexander been at this time a very few days sail more dintant from
Batavia, she must inevitably have been lost, not from any stress of wea-
ther, or danger of coasts or shoals, but merely from inability to conduct her
into the port, as every man on board must have been totally disabled. On
the J7th of November only one man was fit for work, besides the officers;
a very little longer continuance would have reduced her to the condition of
floating at the mercy of wind and waves, without any possibility of assist-
ing, impeding, or directing her course. At six that evening, the wind being
too scanty to carry her into the roads of Batavia, an effort was ipade by
all indiscriminately who were able to work, and anchor was cast between
the islands of Leyden and Alkmara ; soon after a gun was fired, and a sig-
nal made for assistance. At two in the afternoon on the 18th, as na
assistance arrived, the still greater effort of weighing anchor was tried, and
the task performed with the utmost difficulty; after which, standing in
with the sea breeze, the ship came again to anchor at five, in nine fathoms.
The boat was now hoisted out, and sent to beg assistance from the Dutch
commodore, the crew of the Alexander being so much reduced as ta be
unable to furl their own sails, A party was immediately sent to assist, and
six of the Dutch seamen remained on board all night, lest any blowing
weather should come on. Never, perhaps, did any ship arrive in port more
helpless, without being shattered by weather, from the mere effects of a
dreadful and invincible disorder.
? At five in the morning of the 19th, the welcome sight appeared of a
boat from the Dutch commodore, which he had humanely laded with
refreshments. She brought also a boatswain?s mate and twelve seamen
to assist in refitting the ship for sea. The sick were sent on the 20th to the
hospital, where several of them died, being too far gone for any accommo-
dation or skill to recover. From the Bridgewater and Contractor East
Indiamen, which lay in the road when the Alexander arrived ; and from
the Raymond, Asia, and Duke of Montrose, which came in a few days,
after; with the assistance of a few men from the Dutch commodore, a
fresh crew was at length made up, in which only four of the original seamen
remained, the rest being either dead, or not enough recovered to return
with the Alexander, when she sailed again on the 7th of December.?
Nothing remarkable happening, during the remainder of the passage, the
Alexander arrived off the Isle of Wight on the 28th of May, 1789,


this time, his sole prospeet of rising in the service was by his ovra
exertions; a powerful stimulant to an active and generous mind.
On his return, he was recommended, by the late Admiral Kem-
penfelt,* to Captain James Ferguson, + of the Surprise frigate ;
and when that ship was, shortly afterwards, paid off, he was (in
1783) appointed to the Latona frigate, Captain Boston, then un-
der orders for the West Indies. On that station, Mr. Shortland
remained four years ; but, as it Vas in time of peace, it is pro-
bable that the services on which he was employed, were not of
the most interesting nature.
When he returned to England, in 1787, the first expedition to
New South Wales was fitting out; and as his father had been
appointed agent to the fleet, he was, at his solicitation, received
on board the Sirius, by Commodore (now Admiral) Phillip. +
Captain John Hunter was, at the same time, appointed second
captain of that ship.
* A portrait and biographical memoir of this officer appear in the Vllth
Volume of the Naval Chronicle,- page 365.
f Captain James Ferguson distinguished himself when commanding the
Brune, and the Venus, in America and the West Indies. ? In the month
of January, 1781, he was, on the decease of Captain Broderick Hartwell,
appointed Lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital, a, station in which
he continued till the time of his death, which happened on the 14th of
February, 1793. This gentleman, among some eccentricities, possessed
also many excellent qualities, and the shades of the former were not in any
degree capable of obscuring the brilliancy of the latter. The latter years
of his life he unfortunately passed almost in a state of childhood, in conse-
quence of a paralytic stroke, which befel him about the year 1786.? Vide
Charnock?s Biograp/iia Navalis, Vol. VI.
� The Sirius, as we learn from the remarks prefixed to Lieutenant Kin"'*
Journal, published in Hunter?s Historical Journal of the Transactions at
Fort Jackson and Norfolk Island, &c. was built in the river Thames for an
east country ship; and in loading her, she took fire and was burnt down to
her wales. The government wanting a roomy vessel to carry stores abroad,
jn 1781, purchased her bottom, which was built with such stuff as, duriuo
the war, could be found. She went two voyages as the Berwick store-
ship; and without any repairs she was reported, when the present expedi-
tion was thought of, as fit for the voyage to New Holland, when she was
named The Sirius. Experience, however, evinced, that she was altogether !
adequate to the service for which she was destined; and carried her crew
safe through one of the most tremendous gales, on a lee shore, that th�
?Idest seamen remembered, J


Ihe Sirius, in company with the Supply armed tender, and six
transports, sailed from the Mother Bank on the 13th of May,
1787; anchored otFTenerilfe on the 3d of June ; crossed the line
on the sth of July ; reached Rio de Janeiro on the sth of August ;
and anchored in lable Bay, Cape of Good Hope, on the 14th of
October. On the 12th of November, she sailed from the Cape j
and, on the 25th, Commodore Phillip left her, and went on board
of the Supply ; leaving Captain Hunter in the Sirius, to follow
with the store-ships, and a part of the transports. The Supply
reached Botany Bay on the 18th of January, 1788, and the Sirius
on the 20th.
Mr. Shortland was thus present at the first settling of the colony
at Port Jackson ; and his subsequent employment, as may be seen
by referring to our memoir of Captain Hunter,* to Phillip?s
V �yage to Botany Bay , and to Hunter?s Historical Journal, &c.
was of a very laborious and (rying nature,?On the Ist of October
following, agreeably to the instructions of Governor Phillip, tha
Sirius sailed tor the Cape of Good Hope, to purchase provisions;
and, in consequence of her springing a leak, a few hours after she
left Port Jackson, the pumps were obliged to be kept at work
during the whole of the voyage. Having doubled Cape Horn, she
reached the place of her destination on the Ist of January, 1789 ;
but, from a want of the necessary remedies, the scurvy had, by
that time, made considerable ravages amongst her crew. At Table
Bay, the Sirius took on board twelve months? provisions for the
ship?s company, about six months? flour for the infant settlement,
various stores, &c. ; on the 20th of February, she sailed on her
return; and, on the Bth of May, she arrived safe at Port Jack-
son, having, in this voyage, completely circumnavigated the
globe.J
After discharging her cargo, the Sirius underwent the ndeessary
repairs. Supplies of provisions, and stores, had long been ex-
pected from Europe; and, as none had arrived at the close of the
year, ( 1789) an extreme anxiety was apparent. ?In February,?

+ The Sirius had been absent 219 days ; 61 of which she lay in Table
Bay; consequently, she was only ICB days in describing the circle of the
earth.


gays Captain Hunter, in his Historical Journal , a we began to
look a little serious on our disappointment of arrivals : we had
not now more than provisions till June, at the allowance (half) I
have already mentioned. The governor now saw a necessity fui*
dividing the settlement, and signified his intention that such divi-
sion should take place soon, by sending a certain number of
marines and convicts, under the command of Major Ross, th�
lieutenant-governor, to Norfolk Island ; at which place he un-
derstood there were many resources, which Port Jackson, or the
Country round it, did not afford ; and the gardens and cultivated
lands here also would then be more enjoyed by the remaining
numbers : accordingly an arrangement took place, and on the 26th
of February, I received an order to prepare the Sirius for sea, and
to embark the lieutenant-governor, with one company of marines*
and the officers, baggage, and also 186 convicts ; in all, 221 per-
*ons; and with such a proportion of the remaining provisions and
Other stores, as the settlement at that time could furnish ; and I
was directed to land them upon Norfolk Island : Lieutenant Ball,
commander of his Majesty?s armed tender Supply, was ordered
under my command, and he also embarked a company of marines,
and twenty convicts.?
The Sirius left Port Jackson on the 6th of March, made Nor-
folk Island on the 13th of the same month, and, by the 15th, the
whole of the people were safely landed. The weather immedi-
ately became unfavourable ; and, as will be seen more at large in
a succeeding page,* the ship was eventually thrown upon a reef
of rocks, and her bottom beaten out. The surf was tremendous ;
but, fortunately, though all the crew were dragged on shore
through it, not one of them was lost.
On this melancholy occasion, Mr. Shortland was one of the
few, who, with the master, volunteered their services to save as
much of the provisions from the wreck as was possible ; the
island, contrary to the opinion and expectation of Governor
Phillip, neither producing nor affording any adequate subsistenc�
for the numerous inhabitants which it had now received. ?The
Supply not having sailed on her return to Port Jackson, took
Fide Shipwrecks, No, XLI,


part of the crew of the Sirius ; but Captain Hunter, the first
lieutenant, the master, Mr. Shortland, and a few of the other mid-
shipmen, were left on Norfolk Island, where they remained
eleven months ; a part of which time they were in great distress
for want of food.?ln the severe service to which Mr. Shortland
was exposed, in getting the provisions on shore, after the w reck,
his health was greatly injured. For several successive nights, he
slept upon wet sails, which subjected him ever afterwards to the
most excruciating and almost constant rheumatic pains.
The Supply at length returned to Norfolk Island ; and, on the
11th of February, 1791, the officers and crew of the Sirius em-
barked in her for Port Jackson, where they safely arrived on the
27th of the same month.?lt appeared, that the Supply, when she
reached Port Jackson with the account of the loss of the Sirius,
was immediately despatched to Batavia, for the purpose of hiring
a vessel, and loading her with provisions, for the relief of the set-
tlement. She fortunately obtained the Waaksamheyd, a Dutch
snow of about 300 tons burthen, with which she returned to Port
Jackson. After some necessary repairs, she then sailed for Nor-
folk Island, on the service already mentioned.
On their arrival amongst their friends, the crew of the Sirius un-
derstood that the governor had entered into a contract with the
master of the Dutch snow, for carrying them to England ; ? a
piece of information,? says Captain Hunter, ? which I did not
by any means feel a pleasure in hearing : for, anxious as I was to
yeach England as soon as possible, I should with much patience
rather have waited the arrival of an English ship, than to have
embarked under the direction, oV at the disposal, of a foreigner :
however, preparations were then making for sending us off as last
as possible.?
Accordingly, on the 27th of March, Captain Hunter, accom-
panied by his officers and crew', left Sydney Cove, in the
Waaksamheyd, for Batavia; but, instead of a run of sixteen
weeks, as they expected, and had provided for, they did not reach
that settlement till the 2/th of September. The Waaksamheyd
took her u route northward, it being the commeucement of the
winter, and passed through the channel that was discovered by
�ol. XXIV. c


Captain Carteret, in the Swallow, and which divides New B'ltain
from New Ireland ; went through the Strait of Macassar, and
after a passage of twenty-six weeks reached Batavia. The vessel
being foul sailed very ill, and they were unfortunately troubled
with tedious calms near the line, and* strong easterly currents,
which, with the shortness of their provisions, occasioned their
suffering much ; they were compelled to stop at two different
islands in search of water, where they were seriously attacked by
the natives.? *
At Batavia, Captain Hunter purchased the Waaksamheyd ;
and, having obtained the necessary stores, provisions, &c. he sailed
from thence, for the Cape of Good Hope, on the 20th of Octo-
ber. lie reached that settlement on the 17th of December; left
it on the 19th of January, 1792 ; touched at St. Helena on the 4th
of February ; and arrived at Portsmouth on the 22d of April. ?
Mr, Shortland, with Captain Hunter, and the rest of the officers
and crew of the Sirius, were afterwards tried by a court martial,
for the loss of that ship, and honourably acquitted.
lui i / ?/
It may here be remarked, that if, during his absence from
England, Mr. Shortland had witnessed no brilliant display of
military heroism, he had, by the most laborious services, been
perfected in the duties of his profession. The various occurren-
ces which fell under his eye, were the means of expanding his
mind, and of calling all its faculties into action ; at the same time
that he enjoyed the enviable opportunity of acquiring such useful
knowledge as distinguishes the real seaman, and raau of nautical
science.
Mr. Shortland, thus complcat in his professional education, had
been but a short time in England, before he was promoted to the
rank of lieutenant, in the Arrogant, commanded, at that time,
bv the present Admiral Whitshed,t on the home station. He

tive extract from Captain Hunter?s Journal.

lume of the Naval Chronicle, page 333. j


remained in that ship till the latter end of 1794, or the beginning
of 1795, when his old captain, Hunter, was appointed to the
government of New South Wales, The knowledge which the
commodore possessed of his skill and general ability (having had
him under his eye, in the Sirius, during the whole of the first voy-
age to Botany Bay) naturally induced him to fix on Mr. Shortland
for his first lieutenant, in the Reliance, on board of which he had
hoisted his pendant.-?Mr. Shortland, much as he respected Cap.
tain Hunter, left the Arrogant with the utmost reluctance and re-
gret; and he afterwards considered his removal as the most unfor-
tunate era of his life; as an event that banished him from the
active scene which was opened by the French revolution, and
which furnished so many, who, with minds like his, were longing
to fight their country?s battles, with the opportunity of acquiring
a deathless renown. At that time, however, it was uncertain
whether the armament which was fitting out might not be rendered
nugatory by a peace; and he was earnestly solicited, by his
family and friends, to accept a foreign station, as presenting the
best prospect of promotion. He accordingly proceeded to New
South Males; where, much to his sorrow, he was doomed to
remain five years, during the time of war.
The Reliance was fitted out for the purpose of discovery,, and
also to assist in procuring necessaries for the infant colony ; con-
sequently, while Lieutenant Shortland served in that ship (from
1795 to 1800) he made several voyages to the Cape of Good
Hope, Otaheite, jN'ew Zealand, &c.
On his return to England, in the year 1800, he was promoted,
by Earl Spencer, to the rank of master and commander; and, by
the interest of his revered friend, Admiral Schanck,* at that
tune a commissioner of the Transport Board, he was appointed to
t!ie iiarulour 3 a 44-gun frigate, annee cn Jlute , as agent of the
* loops then going to Egypt. When he came back, the Pandour
was paid off; and, in the course of a few days afterwards, he was
appointed to the Dolphin, from which he was shortly removed into
the Irompeuse, a fine sloop of war, of 18 guns, and ordered to

the coast of Guinea. "W hilc on that station, on the death of Cap-
tain Brawn, he was made post in the Squirrel, of 24 guns, by
Captain George Scott; an appointment which was confirmed by
the Admiralty, on his arrival in England, in 1805.*
Captain Shortland was next ordered on the Halifax station, un-
der Admiral Sir J. B. Warren; + and he remained there, till his
gallant friend, Captain Scott, captured the Junon, in the month of
February, 1809, when the admiral was pleased immediately to ap-
point him to that frigate.
We are now approaching to that last act of heroism, which led
to the close of an honourable and valued life.?About the middle
of September, the Junon sailed from Halifax, on a cruise , but,
from the scarcity of men at that port, her crew was upwards of a
hundred deficient of its complement, and she was, in other
respects, very indifferently found. Ihis circumstance is proper to
fee mentioned, as if places the exertions of Captain Shortland in a
more striking point of view.?On the Bth of November, in lati-
tude 32 deg. 35 min. north, longitude 35 deg. 5 min. west, the
Junon spoke an American schooner, twenty-two days from
Cadiz, bound to Norfolk, in Virginia; the maste? of which
informed Captain Shortland, that, on the Ist of that month, he
had fallen in with a French ship of 20 guns, and about 150 men,
bound to Guadaloupe. This information being afterwards corro,
borated by the master of the Hercules brig, of Liverpool, Captain
Shortland was induced to stretch to the westward, in the hope of
intercepting and capturing the enemy. On the morning ot the
13th of December, four ships were observed, which, from infor-
mation previously received, were supposed to be large Jaraaica-
men ; but, on making them out more distinctly, they were disco-
vered to be four large frigates, under Spanish colours. On this,
Captain Shortland ordered the Spanish private signals to be made;
and, as they were correctly answered, the Junon stood towards
the frigates, with the view of obtaining some intelligence of the
enemy. As she neared them, the private signals were repeatedly

lume of the Naval Chronicle, page 353,


made, and as promptly and correctly answered ; and, no doubt
remaining in Captain Shortland?s breast, but that they really were
Spanish ships, he made all sail towards them. On coming within
gun-shot, however, he began to suspect them, and gave orders to
put the ship about. At that moment, the enemy pulling down
the Spanish, and hoisting French colours, poured a broadside into
the Junon, which, unfortunately, killed the man at the helm ; and,
as the one who took his place did not correctly hear the orders,
the ship, instead of running between the two headmost frigates,
sheered on board one of them, and was immediately closed by the
other, on the opposite side. Thus, all chance of escape was lost.
In this situation, Captain Shortland, with only 200 men on board,
yet feeling as an Englishman, resolved at all hazards to defend the
British flag, and immediately cleared for action. The French
ships?for such they proved to be?were, la Renommee, of 48
guns, and 300 men, commanded by M. Roquebert; la Clorinde,
of the same force and complement of men, commanded by M. St.
Cricq; la Seine, of 20 guns, and 200 men, commanded by M.
Vincent; and la Loire, of 20 guns, and 200 men, commanded bv
M. Kerger. The two last were large frigates, armee enjluie ,
conveying 400 soldiers, with military stores and provisions, to
Guadaloupe.
As the enemy closed upon the Junon, they took their stations
in the most advantageous manner: la Renommee, and la Clorinde,
the two larger frigates, lay one on each side of her; and la Seine
passed her bowsprit over the Junon?s starboard, and la Loire her?s
over her larboard quarter. In this situation, they commenced a
most destructive fire of great and small arms; of which the latter,
from the number of soldiers on board the French ships, proved
very galling. Thus circumstanced. Captain Shortland, with the
genuine valour of a Briton, promptly determined to board the
enemy; and, calling up his boarders and marines, he, and Lieute-
nant Greme, of the latter force, were on the point of making the
attempt, when the Frenchmen, perceiving their design, directed a
general volley of grape and musketry against them, by which that
gallant young oflicer, Lieutenant Greme, and about a dozen
marines and boarders, fell dead, and many others were severely
wounded. From a want of hands, Captain Shortland now found


himself compelled to abandon the glorious intention of carrying
the enemy?s ships, and to stand on the defensive.?The enemy still
continued a most severe fire of grape, &c. and several times shewed
an inclination to board, but were as often deterred, by the
undaunted valour of the Junon?s men. Captain Shortland him-
self, stung by their cowardly proceedings, in assailing him with
such superior numbers, seized a boarding pike, and actually picked
several of the Frenchmen from their own rigging, as they ascended
for the purpose of boarding the Junon, and threw them into the
sea. Their fire, however, proved so destructive, that scarcely a
man remained on the upper deck unhurt; and a langridge shot
unfortunately striking Captain Shortland, in its full force, he was
taken senseless from the deck, and carried below severely
wounded.
The command of the ship now devolved on Lieutenant Deckar,
who, several times, with only eight or nine men by his side,
repulsed the enemy?s boarders. But such odds were too great for
any valour to overcome ; and Lieutenant Deckar, finding the ship
unmanageable, and none on deck excepting himself that was not
wounded, sent down to Captain Shortland for instructions how to
act. Captain'Shortland answered, when he might judge that far-
ther resistance would be unavailing temerity, it would be proper
to strike. Lieutenant Deckar, however, who seems to have
possessed a spirit perfectly congenial with that of his captain, still
continued the contest; but, being thrown down by a splinter, as
he alone maintained the deck, the enemy jumped on board, and,
before he could recover himself, holding a pistol to his head, com-
manded him to give directions for the firing, which was still kept
up from below', to cease. Seeing the deck in the possession of the
enemy, and no hands below competent to the task of retaking it,
Lieutenant Deckar gave the necessary directions, and the Junon
was accordingly taken possession of by the enemy, after a contest
of about an hour and a quarter.
In this action, so glorious to the British name, the Junon had
about 90 men killed and wounded ; and her hull was so complete
a wreck, that the enemy were compelled to burn her the morning
after the capture. Her colours were entirely shot away during thq.


engagement; but, what is very remarkable, and perhaps singular,
the English pendant was actually flying over her, at the time she
was burning.*
In addition to the above, which is the first and only correct account
that has appeared of this remarkable action, we subjoin the following
extract from the official report of the French captain Roquebert, com-
mander of la RenommSe. The veracity of M, Roquebert cannot fail of
being particularly admired ; as it will be seen, that he takes no notice
whatever, of la Seine and la Loire, but clearly intimates, that la Renommee
and la Clorinde were the only vessels engaged with the Junon !
? On the 13th of December, the frigate, la Renommee, under my com-
mand, and la Clorinde, Captain St. Cricq, being with the transports under
our convoy, in lat. 17 deg. 6 min. N. and 62 deg. W. we descried at half-
past twelve P.M. a large frigate and a brig, enemy?s vessels, to windward.
By manoeuvring on both sides we came about half-past rive within gun-shot.
Shortly after, having closed within nearly pistol-shot, the Clorinde and
Renommee opened their fire upon the enemy?s frigate, which presented her
starboard side to me. This very destructive discharge, however, the enemy
answered but by an ill-directed fire, and shortly he valiantly attempted to
tack and pass under the stern of la Renommee. I succeeded in avoiding
this attempt to rake me, and gave him a broadside point blank. Captain
St. Cricq, la Clorinde, who was to windward, immediately luffed up and
fell aboard,her on one side, while I fell aboard her on the other. The
enemy having dropped his foresail, parted for an instant. I practised the
same manoeuvre to close him, and the fire of the artillery and musketry of
his Majesty?s two frigates was renewed with so much vivacity, that it soon
silenced that of the enemy. La Clorinde came again close alongside, and,
shortly after, the shouts of ? Long live the Emperor !? announced the sur-
render of the enemy, at the moment when several of la Renommrie?s crew
leaped on board. Lieutenant and Ensign Kearadec, of la Clorinde, were
among the first; among the men who followed was a boatswain, aged 60,
who, forgetting his years, darted on board with the greatest intrepidity.
Ihe action lasted 40 minutes, during almost the whole of which, we were
yard-arm to yard-arm, or broadside to broadside. The frigate taken is the
Jnnon, of 40 guns, and 300 men. Captain Shortland, who commanded
her, has been severely wounded, and has lost one of his officers. She had
90 men killed and wounded. La Renommee has had 15 killed and three
wounded; la Clorinde six killed and 15 wounded. Among the latter is
Ensign Sorcl, who was thrown down upon the deck in the boarding. Cap-
tain St. Cricq manoeuvred his frigate in this action with courage and abi-
lity. I did not expect less from such a companion. Upon all occasions of
our cruise lie afforded nothing but cause for praise; but the highest which
I could bestow, would fall short of his merit. I cannot express how much
lam satisfied with my officers and crew. Captain St. Cricq lost nut a mo-


Nothing can set the glory of this action in a stronger light, than
the minutes taken from the log-book of la Seine, which assign, as
a reason for not pursuing the Observateur, (a small sloop in com-
pany with the Junon, which Captain Shortland despatched to
apprize Admiral Sir A. Cochrane of the enemy being in that quar-
ter) that they could not spare one of the frigates for that
purpose.
Captain Shortland?s wounds were extremely severe. It is
generally believed, that he received the greatest number of bad
wounds ever known in one action. The gallant Nelson lost an
arm, and an eye, and was otherwise much mutilated ; but the nu-
merous personal injuries which he sustained, were the result ot
several engagements : Captain Shortland, in one , was much
wounded in both legs, and in his side; his left arm, and hand,
were shattered to pieces ; and all his knuckles were broken. His
head was the only part unhurt. He suffered the amputation of his
right leg, above the knee, and of a linger; a grape shot was
extracted from his hand ; .and, had there been a probability of
saving his life, other operations would have bfeen necessary.
His sufferings were also greatly augmented, by the several
removals to which he was subjected. It was with great difficulty
that he was first conveyed from the Junon, to one of the h rench
frigates ; a very heavy sea running at the time. He was there
placed in the captain?s cabin ; but, unfortunately, under the sup.
position that an English frigate was in sight, the ship was cleared
for action, and Captain Shortland was removed into the gun-
room. The Observateur having given the necessary intelligence to
Sir Alexander Cochrane, several English vessels made their appear-
ance before Basseterre; in consequence of which, the French were
ment to pay the same tribute of praise to those of the Cbrinde. The
bri* which accompanied the Junon is the Observateur, eighteen 24-
pounders, took no part in the action, except by one broadside, which she
tired at la Renonunec, after which she ran, and escaped by favour of the
nidit. The English captain manoeuvred his frigate with equal courage and
ability, but it was become impossible for him to escape us. 1 request your
Excellency to recommend both to his Majesty ; and I most particularly
call your attention to Messrs. Calaber and Serb, first lieutenants of the
two frigates, (Signed) ? ROQUEBEIIT.?'


Unable to make that harbour, and were obliged to run into a
small creek, from which Captain Shortland was carried, in an open
canoe, under a scorching sun, thirteen miles to the hospital; that
being the only place where he could receive the benefit of the
b rench medical staff. There, exhausted by the loss of blood, and
worn out by extreme pain, he expired on the 21st of January,
1810; never having been able to sit up, even in his bed, after the
day of the action?a period of nearly six weeks.
fhe dreadful and lamentable manner in which Captain Short-
land was mutilated, during the engagement, may, in some measure,
be accounted for, by the fact, that his distinguishing gallantry ren-
dcred him an object for the enemy to fire at. The crews of the
enemy?s frigates were picked men ; and two of them, as it has
been already stated, had �OO troops each on board; notwith-
standing which, the Junon?s little and incomplete crew, success-
fully repulsed the enemy, in three distinct attempts to board her;
and the surviving officers of the Junon speak of their commander
as heading his men to the last moment, using a pike till he was
struck senseless on the deck. To his gallantry, a nation?s grati-
tude is eminently due; as, had not the Junon sustained the
unequal combat that she did, the Obscrvateur could not have
escaped, to apprize the admiral and onr cruisers of the situation
of the enemy , intelligence which ultimately led to the destruction
of two of the F rcnch frigates, at Guadaloupe. They were indeed
so closely pursued, that their officers were able only to save the
money which they had on board ; being under the necessity of
blowing the ships up, with all their stores, &c. to prevent them
from failing into our hands. *
* 1 he official details of the destruction of la Rcnommee and la Loire, on
the 18th of December, 1809,? are given in our XXIIId Volume, page 168,
et seq. Die following additional particulars are extracted from a private
letter, dated Barbadoes, December 26 :
? The Obscrvateur, having escaped, feb in with one of our light squadrons
off Guadaloupe, and apprizing them of the approach of the cnemv, pro-
ceeded to Martinique to inform the admiral of the occurrence. At the
moment of Sir Alexander Cochrane?s receiving the information, the S�cptre
and Alfred were standing into Fort Royal Bay, and were instantly ordered
od by the admiral, who, in the Pornpee, and with the Abercrombie, pro-
<UoI. XXIV.


Justice to the French medical stall impels us to state,
during their attendance on Captain Shortland, they vied with our
ceeded to sea the following evening, and the whole arrived off Vieux Fort,
Guadaloupe, in time to a most gallant display of naval heroism, in
which all that zeal, courage, and promptitude, could effect, was most glo-
riously exhibited.?The Gloire and Blonde frigates, Ringdove and Hazard
sloops, apprized by the ObserVatcur of the enemy being at hand, (who,
however, separated his force after the capture of the Junon)made the must
judicious arrangements to cut him off; and so fur succeeded, that he was'
compelled to take refuge in Vieux Fort, a small bay well defended, a few
miles to the northward and westward ot Basseterre. Here they instantly
resolved upon attacking him ; and so promptly were their measures Carried
into effect, that before any additional force, which now had greatly accu-
mulated (the admiral and four hue-of-battle ships, and seveial fiigates,
being in the offing), could act with them, the Ringdove was fairly in-shore
of the enemy?s two ships, by the time they had landed the tioops witli
which they were crowded ; and Captain Dowers, at the head of a party of
seamen and marines, followed so close on shore upon them, that he stormed
and carried a strong battery before their face. The boats of the Gloire,
Blonde, Hazard, and Pultusk, which was up in time to share in the glory of
the day, speedily followed, and successively stormed three batteries that
defended the fort?Captains Cameron of the Hazard, Elliot ot the Pul-
tusk, leading like Captain Dowers, their respective party ; as was, no less
gallantly, that from the Blonde by lieutenant Jenkins. The enemy?s troops-
landed from the frigates, were rather a miserable conscript banditti, than
actual soldiers they were without arms, and fled upon reaching the shore;,
the batteries, however, were well manned, spiritedly defended, and carried
only by the superior bravery of our seamen and marines. Captain Dowers
distinguished himself particularly by the undaunted manner in which he
landed his party, and rushed to the attack unsupported by the other boats ;
but to every officer and man is a full proportion of applause justly due ;
while to Captain Cameron and Lieutenant Jenkins we owe the tribute of
unavailing sorrow, for, in the midst of vic tory, they fell alike covered with
wounds and glory. Captain Cameron, after himself striking the enemy?s
colours, and receiving a musket-hall wound while doing it, was killed by s
grape shot, in getting into his boat; and Lieutenant Jenkins, in the midst
of a most gallant struggle within the enemy?s works, lost his life at the instant
he bad triumphed.
� While thus the enemy was driven from his batteries, that he might not
annoy us in our attack on the frigates, a heavy cannonade was kept up
tm them from the in-shore squadron, whose boats had tints destroyed his
line of defence ashore ; and dispositions were making to attack the frigates;,
when, dismayed by the impetuosity and courage which they iiad seen dis-
played around them, and conscious that all resistance would he unavailing,
the enemy abandoned them, first setting them, on lire ; and happily before


own people, in doing every thing in their power to alleviate his
sufferings. Their attentions Mere, indeed, of the most tender and
affectionate nature; audit would be highly grateful to our feel-
ings, could we add, that General Ernouf, now a prisoner in
England, as punctually fulfilled the duties of humanity towards his
captive ; but, on the contrary, he never once inquired after the
wounded sufferer, nor did ho ever offer to send him a single com-
fort unattainable by other means ! Indeed, the officers in
general were but indifferently treated, during their stay at Gua-
daloupc.
Captain Shortland died, as lie had lived, firm in his attachment
to the Protestant faith. The sublime duties of religion deeply
occupied his attention ; and, while on his death-bed, he repeatedly
sent his servant (a young man who had lived with him nearly nine
years) in quest of a Protestant clergyman ; conceiving that there
must be some persons on the island, sufficiently enlightened to pre-
fer the reformed to the Roman church. Finding, however, that
his wishes could not be accomplished, he had the prayers of the
Church service constantly read by those around him ; and he Mas
earnest in his entreaties, fur it to be explained to every one, that,
though he might die in a Catholic country, lie should expire firm
in the Protestant belief, it Mas also his anxious request?a re-
quest which was scrupulously performed?that no Catholic priest,
nor any emblem of that religion, might be seen at his funeral
obsequies.
After what has been said, respecting General Ernouf, it is right
to add, that, though inattentive to the hero while he was living?
when he might have applied (he balm of comfort and consolation to
bis mind, as well as to his body??as soon as he was dead, he gave
orders that every military honour should be paid to his remains.
The arrangement of his funeral was, consequently, as follows:
Three companies of grenadiers, and three battalion companies,
were stationed in the court-yard, to receive the body, under the
command of a Chef de Battalion. On the body being brought
any of our party had got within reach of die destructive conflagration, they
both blew up with a tremendous explosion, accomplishing by their own act
the full object and intention of our enterprise.?


out, it was received with the accustomed honours; the guard of
honour firing over it. The procession then moved, in the follow-
ing order, to the place of burial; a distance of nearly two miles .
two bands of martial music, playing a solemn dirge; the drums
and trumpets covered with crape. The troops, as before men-
tioned, in military order, with crape hat-bands. The coffin, con-
taining the body of the deceased, borne by six seamen of the
Jnnon : on the coffin were the coat, hat, and epaulets, of the
deceased ; the pall, a British Union Jack (no pall being to be pro-
cured on the island, excepting such as were ornamented with the em-
blems of the Catholic faith) supported by Lieutenant Deckar, first
of the Junon, two French lieutenant-colonels, and the officer
commanding the French marine. The purser and the surgeon of
the Junon following as chief mourners ; after them, the midship-
men ; and the procession was closed by nearly the whole of the
judges, and military and civil officers, in Guadaloupe. Ihe whole
of the road through which it passed was lined by the military.
The funeral service was performed by Mr. Jones, the purser Oi
the Junon; there being no protestant clergyman on the island.
After the body had been deposited in the earth, the whole of tne
procession moved solemnly round it, the military firing their pieces
into the grave.
Having thus noticed the last sad duties which were performed to
his mortal remains, we have but little to add. Jo deplore his loss,
Captain Shortland has left a mother, a brother,* and two sisters.
Their only consolation is, the gallant and glorious manner in which
he fell; their only hope?that his meritorious services may not be
forgotten by his countrymen. By his widowed mother, in parti-
cular, his death must be felt as a heavy infliction of Providence ;
as a stroke which has deprived her of a son, who invariably
endeavoured, by every means in his power, to alleviate the severe
loss which she had previously sustained, by the death of his
? His brother, Captain Thomas - George Shortland, who, as well as him-
self, w'as at the first settlement of Port Jackson, was made post on the Ist
of March, 11102. He at present commands the Iris, in which he

commanded by the Hon, Captain Paget.


lamented father. The character of the deceased cannot be better
summed up, than by stating, that he was a most dutiful son, an
affectionate brother, a good master, and a universal friend to
mankind.
Captain Shortland?s services are known to have been holden in
high estimation at the Admiralty : had his life been spared, some
distinguishing honour, with the grant of a pension, would proba-
bly have been conferred upon him ; and, considering the circum-
stances of the action through which he fell?an action almost un-
paralleled in history*?it is hoped that some token of national
gratitude will be assigned to his surviving relatives. This is the
more to be wished, when it is known, that, from the period of his
entering the service, till the hour of his death, Captain Shortland
had not been more than six months out of actual employment; and
that, by the destruction of the Junon, he sustained a loss of from
1,0001. to 1,5001. which, in consequence of its being her first
voyage, he had been under the necessity of expending in her out-
fit, &c. A public monument has been, we believe, in contempla-
tion ; but, from a want of precedent, which too frequently operates
to the injury of individuals, and prevents the performance of great
and noble acts, the idea was dropped. If the will, however, be
not w anting, it is amply in the power of government to adopt some
other mode of perpetuating the memory of the departed.
* At the court martial, which was holden at Guadaloupe, for the trial of
the surviving officers and crew of the Junon, after the decease of Captain
Shortland, very high encomiums were passed on the general conduct o( the
engagement; and, to shew the high sense which they entertained of us
brilliancy and merit, they strongly recommended Lieutenant Deckar, the
first officer, for promotion. The recommendation was promptly attended
to by Lord Mulgrave. Mr. Jones, the purser, who was wounded, and was
highly spoken of by Captain Shortland, was also appointed to the Bellero-
plion, on liis return to England.?A brief notice of the court martial
alluded to, will be found in the preceding volume of the Naval Chronicle,
page 345.

SIR RICHARD STRACHAN S REASONS FOR NOT SINKING VESSELS TO BLOCK
UP THE SCHELDT.
ripilE idea of blocking up the Scheldt by sinking vessels in it, is not new-.
Report had Jqng maintained a kind of tradition, that something of
this description had been effected by the United Provinces, when they re-
strained tlie trade off' Antwerp, formerly the most flourishing city of the
low countries. We beljeve the greatest restraint on the trade of that city
was the removal of mercantile capital to Amsterdam, for freedom and
security, However that might be, the following are Admiral Strachan?s
reasons, given to the Admiralty, for not sinking vessels to block up the
Scheldt:
? The public anxiety, though under a state of delusion, lias been led to
imagine, that nothing is more easy than to block up the navigation of a
river where the channel is narrow ; and I am ready to confess, no person?s
opinion was more eagerly bent than mine to this persuasion, on the first sen-
sation which was produced front the impression of theory; but that idea
was materially altered by the effect of observation and practical research.
? I had taken steps to prepare vessels, before I was satisfied of the
inexpediency of doing so.
? Captain Peake, a very active and intelligent officer, who was stationed
at Bathi! with tlie marine brigade, ascertained the rise of the tides to be
from twenty to twenty four feel; and, on the 2d of September, which hap-
pened to be the dead of the neaps, lie was directed to measure the rise of
the tide ; the wind was then at S.E. certainly the most checking wind in
the Scheldt, and yet it rose 18 feet.
? After this statement of facts, I venture to submit to their lordships?
consideration, whether with such a rise of tide, and in a situation where
the genius and activity of French mechanics could he employed without any
interruption, there was the least prospect, by sinking vessels, to prevent or
even to impede the navigation of that part of the river; for it must bo
evident, that any thing raised above the level %f low water could easily he
removed; and, without claiming the advantage of what they could work
tinder water, I think it will not he denied, that nothing is more practicable
than to get ships across such a narrow hank a
would form that we could sink : the enemy?s
culty lightened to eighteen feet.
?It appears, on a final calculation, that it will hemecessary to destroy
twenty-six large ships, and twenty-one smaller ones, to accomplish this
purpose.?

? MY DEAR FATHER, September 10, 1798.
? About a twelvemonth since I went on an expedition in the.Governor?s
whale boat, as far as Port Stephens, which lies 100 miles to the northward
of this place: in my passage down I discovered a very fine coal river, which
I named after Governor Hunter; the enclosed I send you, being an eye

may load there with great ease, and completely land-locked. I dare
say in a little time this river will be a great acquisition to this settlement*

doing so much as I otherwise should.
