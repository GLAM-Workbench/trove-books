THE
BOTANY BAY ROTHSCHILD.
Quern qui beatum fuisse putant, miserrimi ipsi sunt.*
Cicero.
As it is to be apprehended, that the disclosure of the immense
wealth, which an individual outlawed for his crimes has left
behind, might operate in a detrimental way upon the lower classes
of society, we haye gathered a few data of his biography, which
will show, what the man really was, and thus serve as an antidote
against the dazzling effect, which mere figures generally produce
on the unthinking and profane. It is only in consideration of the
utility, which we trust will result from our undertaking, that we
like to intrude upon the private life of an individual, whose actions
(the most tangible ones at least), whilst in New South Wales,
would not have otherwise made him an object of either public
praise or open censure. For the sake of giving a substantial
basis to the following lines, we will just mention, that the property
left by the late Mr. Samuel Terry, of Sydney, New South Wales,
amounted to nearly a million sterling, and that he bequeathed his
wife an annuity of ten thousand pounds &c.
Our hero was transported to New South Wales when very young,
and as far as we know, for neither an atrocious nor consequential
crime, some say for stealing geese. We do not know either when
he got married, and only remark, that his wife was the widow of
a man who had undergone the utmost penalty of the law. Under
such circumstances, it was easy to perceive, to what kind of exer-
tions Samuel Terry would probably resort as soon as he should
have obtained some indulgence, so profusely granted in those

miserable.


times, —he established a small slye grog and pawnbroker's shop.
Spirits were then a guinea a bottle, aud tobacco retailed for the
weight of silver. To him resorted convict servants with some
worn or questionable clothes, or other such property, which its
again circulated amongst associates and friends,
“ Higgling with convicts for their dirty clothes.”
It is easy to be conceived, how, in a sprouting up colony,
enlivened by the liberal grants of the British Treasury, such a
business was capable of being increased, and how it was really
increased. But even with all this, we must look deeper into S. T’s.
character, to be able to explain, how, even under the very favour-
able circumstances of those colonial times, he could have laid the
foundation of his subsequent large fortune. Our hero possessed
qualities (a few of them useful ones), which, under adequate cir-
cumstances will always produce a similar effect. He was of per-
fectly sober and frugal habits, he was active and industrious; and
his whole philosophy consisted in having made up his mind, to
never give value without obtaining value for it, and, moreover,
as much, as only to keep his neck out of the halter, or his legs out
of chains. Itis said, that notwithstanding he had been punished cor-
porally in the colony, hut we should not believe that this could
have been the case to any extent, else it would necessarily have
marred his encreasing business. However, Samuel Terry was
cunning enough, and not at all nice, to refuse any bargain, where
no legal danger was to be apprehended. He left several valuable
grounds, which he had purchased for a bottle of spirits; or he
advanced spirits and tobacco, sued, or caused to sue for the
debt, and bought the ground at the sale of the sheriff. Whether
our friend ever foresaw to what value land would rise in the colony,
or whether it was accidental, that he endeavoured to amass the
only sort of property, which was to be had in his way;* suffice to
say, that as soon as this rise took place, Samuel Terry was even
on that score a rich man, and he must have found to his great
/it

surprise, and at the same time satisfaction, that those acres of his,
in and near Sydney, hitherto covered with filth and rubbish, were
now worth as much as if they were pasted all over with bank
notes. Our hero entered subsequently into some shipping specula-
tions, but his cunning and caution were so great, his economical
habits so unalterable, that we did not hear that he ever sustained
any considerable loss. It was at this time (about twenty years
ago), that being asked in some law suit on his oath, how much he
believed he was worth, he answered ninety thousand pounds
sterling. Whether, or atwhat time, S. T. received his emancipation
or free pardon, is matter of indifference; because, with such a
mass of wealth, he could, in the present age, always either obtain
it, or disdain its possession.
It was at an early period of his career, that he associated with
the free-masons, perhaps also for that reason, of having a right to
be amongst some respectable men. However, w r e are induced to
believe, that his inborn and studied niggardness forsook him in
the relations with that fraternity, and we have heard of some slight
acts of charity he then performed. But scarcely have we uttered
this encomium, than we are obliged to mention a dark spot in his
life. In the extensive business he was now engaged in, he was
obliged to have large amounts of cash about him, and one Sunday
morning, his “iron chest,” (proverbial in Sydney), was robbed of
some thousand sovereigns. The deed was traced to a young
convict in Terry’s service, and who, on account of his en-
gaging figure and good behaviour, had been hitherto a favourite
of the family, —some gold coin having been found concealed in his
shoes. He was capitally convicted. It is asserted that Samuel
Terry obtained leave to visit him in the cell, when he, under the
explicit promise of obtaining his pardon, induced the boy to dis-
close the spot in the garden where the money had been planted.
We should believe, that in these times, a man of S. Terry’s afflu-
ence, might have been able to obtain any thing in New South
Wales. At any rate, it is said, that he had given his word; still
the boy was hung. The story runs, that Terry w r as since that
hunted by the sight of the executed, and iu moments of anger, his


relations reproached him with the murder of the lad. A similar
tragical event is related, in which Mr. A General B. was con-
cerned. This gentleman somehow or other got on intimate terms
with Samuel Terry, and the latter lent him, on one occasion,
eight hundred pounds. Mr. B. became afterwards embarrassed,
when T. sold his valuable farm, and got himself possessed of it,
which, it is said, contributed at least to the subsequent mental
aberration of that gentleman. And now we ask any of our readers,
even of that class we are more immediately addressing, whether
there is any of them who would covet Samuel Terry’s riches, —
riches, as is already seen, tainted by the death of a favourite
servant, and the madness of a friend ? We are sure, none ! none !
However, as even these are only, as it were moral or ethic dis -
advantages, we are, as we before said, reluctantly compelled to
show our hero in his domestic circumstances, and to investigate
what comfort, enjoyment, and happiness hath ever been his earthly
lot. We will take up a period of about six years back, when T.
was in possession of about fifty thousand pounds sterling per annum,
and in the very prime of life. He lived then in the same place he
died in, viz., a not small, hut unroomy, tasteless house in Pitt
Street, Sydney. He rode at times a clumsy old charger, and
passed many hours of the day in salting beef, in his shirt sieves.
When he had a friend with him, and was obliged to send for a
bottle of spirits to the pantry, he always smelled the breath of the
servant, for fear that he might have drank some. Mrs. Terry
never kept a female servant; she dressed in the most simple, nay,
coarse manner, and was seen every Saturday on her knees,
scrubbing out the whole premises. But, as we have again men-
tioned this female, who seems to have exercised some influence
over her husband’s conduct, it will not be out of the way to relate
an anecdote of her, showing her niggardly, fearful, and narrow
mind. About the time we speak of, a certain university-bred
man arrived in Sydney, who was introduced to Samuel Terry, by
a gentleman of some rank. The conversation turned amongst
other topics, on a certain manufacturing plan, which the former
wished to execute in New South Wales. It was hinted at, that


Terry should take some interest in it, and five or six hundred
pounds sterling mentioned as the sum required. Our hero had
listened with some attention to the proposal. When, however,
the matter was again broached a few evenings afterwards, Mrs.
Terry addressed the company in the following strain:—“Mr.
Terry has no business to embark in speculations, of which he does
not understand the nature. You may say, that the sum is only
small, because Mr. Terry is a rich man; but there were richer
people than we are, who, after all, died in great misery and dis-
tress.”—Who is it, that does not see in these few words the pangs
of a mind, which, in the possession of a princely fortune, is still
remembering painfully the privations and the humbleness of its
former life, and is continually haunted by the thought, that after all
misery and distress is still awaiting it! Although S. T., in the
latter years of his life, discounted yearly 300,000/. bills at 10 per
cent.; and, as it is known, that the rental of his houses in Sydney
(of which he possessed entire streets), the produce of hisfarms, &c.
amounted to at least 60,000/. or 70,000/. per annum, he yet
lived upon 500/. or 600/. a year, taken at the outset; and thus,
it will be seen, that his immense wealth was but a dead incum-
brance upon him. We would, in this instance, compare him to
a steam carriage, of, say two horse power, upon which the appa-
ratus of steam engines of one hundred horse power is stowed; still,
this dead burthen does not increase the strength, or the import-
ance of the vehicle in the least; and thus we would say, that S. T.
by all his anxiety of mind and niggardness, never was a man but
of 500/. or 600/. per annum; and this sum certainly it is easy to
realise, by less degrading and abject means than he had resorted to.
But we will now mention facts, which will not only exempt him
from being an object of envy, but reduce him to a state truly to
be pitied; and if the proverb, saying, “end good, all good,” is
correct, it certainly can, in its most pointed contrast, be applied
to him. About four years ago, this hitherto strong and healthy
man was seized with a paralytic stroke, which at once deprived
him of the use of his right limbs. What misfortune for a man
without mental resources, without inward consolation, without


loving siud sympathising friends ! As this man could not exer-
cise now any active influence upon the members of his family, he
became with some of them an object of contempt and disgust,
whilst in the meantime all their vicious propensities became ap-
parent. His son had married a handsome and well-bred young
emigrant, but being a drunken and brutal man, he lived then with
her on the worst terms possible, and in one of his mad moments
opened her head with an iron poker. The relations appeared
against him, and the magistrates connnitti d him to take his trial.
However, strange to say, lie was (in a case which nearly threatened
his life), allowed to bail, and the whole affair was subsequently
made up by money. Even S. T. himself was not exempted
from the brutal frenzy of this imbecile son, and lie abused and
threatened him on many occasions. Our hero, for the remainder
of his liie, was unable to move without the aid of two men, and
thus extended, in his open carriage, pale and bloated, lie drove
about the domain of Sydney, a silent but impressive example for
any one, showing bow illusive and worthless, at times, wealth is,
especially with a man like him, and if obtained in a low, and even
questionable way. In these drives he was generally accompanied
by one of his convict servants, because, notwithstanding that
riches are omnipotent in penal colonies, even those of S. T. could
not influence respectable men to associate with him but on business.
A Mr. M. however, (formerly a Wesleyan Missionary), when once
in bis carriage, broached cautiously the making of bis will, and
the conversation turned outlie subject, that S. T. should bequeath
behind one of bis farms near Syndcy, for the sake of establishing
a house of refuge, on a large scale, sufficiently endowed. We shall
see presently, that Samuel Terry’s will did not in the least realise
these philanthropic hopes and suggestions of Mr. M.
However, it is the unfortunate lot of men, like the subject of
this paper, that even, if they intend to be benevolent, they pitch
upon men of their own stamp, and do not derive either the credit
or satisfaction generally resulting from such acts. Some years
back S. T. became a methodist, and constant attendant of sermons,
which a Mr. M‘K. had established. This man possessed the gift


of uncommon good lungs, and voluntarily crying; besides this, a
thoroughly vulgar and illiterate man. As it was impossible, that
he could subsist merely on preaching, he very properly established
a tobacco shop, in which S. T. assisted him with the loan of some
hundred pounds; yet, by his unbusinesslike and drunken habits, he
failed after a couple of years, and was sold oif. S. T. on finding
himself mistaken in bis protege, or by the natural niggardness
of his character, put him into gaol, wheie M‘K remained for a
long time, attempted snidde, and finally died miserable. How-
ever, it would be superfluous to extend this paper any further, as
we are sure, of having given in these few lines, everything charac-
teristic of Samuel Terry. His illness became more dangerous,
and more irksome from day to day, and he died in the beginning
of 1838, only fifty-two years of age, and therefore just at a period
of life, when riches, well and honourably obtained, may he most
quietly and beneficially enjoyed and employed. His will was that
of all vulgar misers, to wit, he left his entire property to such as,
consanguinity and chance had placed round him, and there is not
one word about a house of refuge, or any thing of a public bearing
in it. The only provision approaching to it is, that all his benevolent
subscriptions (perhaps 100/. a year), should he continued for ten
years to come. He requested also, that his funeral should take place
with masonic honours, perhaps ;igain by the reason, that some res-
pectable men should have a pretext fcr following his corps.
Such was Samuel Terry! —the richest outlaw whom the Austra-
lian colonies yet possessed, and ever will posses, because times,
and (very properly) circumstances also, have new wonderfully
changed. In a very few' years Terry, the man, will he entirely for-
gotten save in his substantial, monetary capacity and cognomen,
‘ ‘ The Botany-Bay Rothschild!”
Wishing to conclude this paper with some general remark, we
say, that the humbler classes of society may perceive from the above,
that a glossy coat does not always conceal a worthy, or happy heart
—and that after all, it is as true now, as it was eighteen hundred
years ago, when it was said ;
“ Blessed are the Pure in heart.”


ON EMIGRATION AND TRANSPORTATION TO
THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES.
The writer of the preceding little biography of one of the crack
Botany Bay characters, has been lately so often questioned about
the treatment of convicts generally, and the manner in which they
are employed in Botany Bay (the Australian Penal Colonies),
that, he considers a few words thereon, will be a convenient addi-
tion to this frail and hasty production.
But for the sake of affording our readers the intended informa-
tion, we must in this, as in all similar matters, refer and go back
to history. As far as in the first instance the conveying of con-
victs hence is concerned, their fate thirty, nay twenty, and
even ten years ago, aye, and only a few years back, was indeed
deplorable. At the former period, the wants of the colonies were
so limited, that most of the vessels going there, had very little cargo
on board, neither government stores nor private merchandize.
The consequence was, that the Surgeon Superintendant and the
Captain mostly agreed to put into one of the Brazilian ports,
for the sake of purchasing spirits and tobacco, on their own ac-
count, which articles (as has been shown previously), were then
extremely valuable in the Colony. A voyage, therefore, which now-
lasts at an average four months, was, in this way extended from
seven to nine months, during which, these unfortunate outlaws
were kept (certainly against all law of nature !) exclusively on salt
provisions, those most inferior, so much so, that many died, and
far more became affected by scurvy and other diseases. The sen-
timents of humanity, more generally developed for the last few
years, but far more the expostulation of some of the liberal papers
in the colony, and if it is not presumption to say, our own radical
and unflinching writings, have put a stop to this, and some other
evils, under which the Australian Colonies, and their convict
population especially, have for so many years groaned. The provi-
sions supplied to the transports are now of the same quality, as those
of the Royal Navy, and whenever the surgeon finds occasion for it, he
is at liberty to put into any sea port, for the sake of supplying the


convicts with fresh provisions, vegetables, &c. A premium of
ten shillings for every head landed in the colony has been paid all
along to him; an expedient which however effective it may prove,
still speaks very equivocally for the feelings of an age, where
professional and official attention to fellow creatures must be
obtained and paid for, at so much per head !
To revert again to the conveyance of convicts, there are still two
things (and such as no Committee has yet meddled with), which
are absolutely wrong and injurious.
First. A whole shipbad of women, (some (if them necessarily
young and handsome) are left under the absolute and sole controul
of a surgeon of the navy, at times a young man, often a bachelor
or widower, and even if married, mostly unaccompanied by his
wife. It is obvious, what scandalous effects frequently result from
such an arrangement, which, however, it is unnecessary to detail
on the present occasion ; still, it is clear, that, no female convict
ship should be sent away without the surgeon being accompanied
by his wife, sister, or adult daughter, to act as matron during the
voyage.
Secondly. Another inconvenience, equally weighty as this, is, that
in all prison ships, the surgeonis the absolute and uncontroled master
and magistrate of the convicts. There is no open trying of cases,
say with the captain and the mates as assessors—the surgeon dis-
tributes lashes, solitary confinement on bread and water, &c. quite
at his own option and discretion. Weheard of some, who had placed
refractory women in the hatchway, and had two or three buckets
of water thrown over them, others (probably inimical to a class, to
which they do not belong, at least by education) say, that they
never get a gentleman convict, or a lawyer on board, without flogg-
ing him. All this is very good for an after dinner joke, still we
say, that a certain way of (summary) procedure, and a certain de-
fined rate of punishment should be ordered to be adhered to.
But now we come to an error, which pervades the whole system
of prison discipline (if so it may be called), and this is, that every
one wants to punish, to work, and profit by, and no one cares to
improve and reform these unfortunate creatures. We are happy


to find, since we liave been in London, that transportation is no
more so generally resorted to, even for very small offences, as was
once the case.* Look at a Clergyman having been formerly trans-
ported for defrauding H. M’s. Exchequer, which is to be trans-
lated, for having put a frank upon a four-penny letter, to do which
he was not entitled. Still, as things stand now, there is no suffi-
cient classification, (aye, no classification at all) made amongst the
different grades of convicts. The ferocious and blood-stained high-
wayman, and the poor lad, who to avoid starvation, stole a
bunch of turnips in Covent Garden Market, are huddled up in
the same hold, nay, in the same berth. At the first blush, we
would propose to classify convicts in this manner. First, crimi-
nals who have shed blood and injured human life in an atrocious
and premeditated way. Whether such are to belet loose upon Society
even in Botany Bar, appears very doubtful to me. Secondly, con-
victs, who by violence (not sanguinary), or any fraud or theft have
knowingly destroyed, or materially injured the well-being or pro-
perty of any family or person. Thirdly, Felons, whose misdeeds,
though felonious audtransportable, admitof some extenuation and of
a well-founded hope oi reform. Fourthly, Persons who have been
guilty of conventional crimes, riot, libel, duels, transgressors of
game or custom-house laws, &c.
But for the sake of not becoming diffuse on the present occa-
sion, we revert to our original position, amL we say, that
there is a certain conscientious, humane, and considerate way
of treating people, whose circumstances may be (in one way or
or other) depressed, or even degraded. However this (Pestalozzian
or Fellenbergian) way of treating an aggregate of inferiors, im-
plies nothing of the mawkisti, feeble canthke or hypocritical. Late
Governor Bourke allowed his private secretary to correspond with
convicts behind the back ot their master, and they may have re-
ceived answers with the Government-house seal ; but we have never
heard of any official or private act of indulgence or benevolence
* This may on the other hand be the reason, that for the last two months
(to our knowledge) three persons in London, have died by starvation. Well
may the people of this country then say, that the reform bill, has proved
hitherto to be but regular humbug.


practised by that officer towards any of them, except swell ns were
rich, or otherwise useful to him. But to be able to act in tire
above way towards our fellow-men, (in this case convicts), a man
must be an inwai-d Christian, and a thinking man. It will bo seen
therefore, how convict discipline is based upon, and hinges entirely
on, the far more important subject of “Emigration.” But, what
in the name of G—d has Government done for the last eight years,
to encourage emigration of the industrious, educated, and respect-
able classes of society to the Australian Colonies ?—nothing, abso-
lutely nothing. Now' they encourage emigration, but of whom l—
of labourers, to wit, of free Englishmen, to cultivate, in conjunction
with depraved and neglected convicts, the thirty, forty, sixty, nay
hundred thousand acres, of a Botany Bay Aristocracy !
It is (as it has been chaunted a thousand times in liberal papers,
British as well as Colonial), a virtuous, industrious, respectable,
educated pleasantry or tenantry, which the Australian Colonies
want, —but, this again is not what the thirty, forty, nay one hun-
dred thousand aeres-of-laud-Mea, examined before the Committee
of the Commons House of Parliament have in view'. Such tenantry
would require waste land, given to them by Government, and this
would interfere with the land jobbing transactions of the Botany
Bay Aristocracy. They have usurped the best tracts and patches of
the territory and they do not wish, that small settlers and a peasantry
should he located upon any land, which they themselves may con-
template to pmrehase sooner or later from Government, at five shil-
pings an acre; and to retail in exchange less valuable patches, or such
for which they may have no occasion, at the rate of two or three
pounds an acre, —and thus to take out the very last farthing from
the pocket of the emigrant, belonging to the class of “ the people.”
However, we have inadvertently transgressed from Australian to
British Politics. Here, as there, the rich wish, that the bulk of
the peopfie should remain slaves and labourers, whilst the pjeop-e
(educated and progressing rapidly) require vice versa, to become
proprietors to a certain adequate and reasonable extent.
But for the sake of concluding our present subject, we say, tha!
the fate of our outlaws, taken in the bulk, is one of great, and


often undeserved hardship. If convicts were given into the ser-
vitude of a virtuous and industrious peasantry or tenantry, say in
the proportion of three, four, or even, in some cases, as many as ten
in a family—these free people would have an interest in, and would
be able to reform them, and make them useful members of society.
But if our readers come to know, that some, (we must say many)
of the Botany Bay aristrocracy possess fifty, seventy, one hundred,
and three hundred convicts (gratuitously given away white slaves)
—talk then of improving them, reforming them ! —they have to pro-
duce carriages and carpets and silver chandeliers for the rich, and if
seven at once get hanged, the so-and-so Esquire, or so-and-so Ve-
nerable or Honorable, can get as many more without any trouble.
In having thus briefly advocated the claims (if not rights)
of our outlaws, we have the authority of a man for us, who is re-
spected and appreciated by all parties—we mean the Lord Chief
Justice Denman, who, in the parliamentary debates on national
education (a very sore subject), spoke these memorable words:
“He confessed he had, after reflection upon the question —not
“ as a subject for rhetorical declamation, but as one demanding
“ grave attention —doubted how far the state was justified in in-
“ dieting punishment for an offence, against the commission of
“ which it had taken no pains (steps) to guard. If the Govern-
“ment, in a case of serious offence, shared (!!!) any portion
“of the guilt which was pronounced against the offender, they
“ certainly incurred severe responsibility. —“ Debate in the House

IHE BOTANY-BAY ROTHSCHILD.
** Quem qui beatom fuisae putant, raiserriml ipsi sunt."* —Ctcet-o.
As it is to be apprehended, that the disclosure of the im-
. inenae wealth which an individual outlawed for his crimes
lias left behind might operate in a detrimental way upon
the lower classes of jooiety, we have gathered a few
data of his biography, which will show what the man
really was, and thus serve as an antidote against the daz-
zling effect which' mere figures generally produce on
the unthinking and profane. It is only in consideration of
the utility, which we trust will result from our undertaking,
that we like to intrude upon the private life of an individual,
whose actions (the most tangible ones at least) whilst in
New South Wales would not nave otherwise made him an
object of either public praise or open censure. For the sake
of giving a •substantial basis to the following lines, we will
just mention, that the property left by the late Mr. Samuel
Terry, of Sydney, New South Wales, amounted to nearly a
million sterling, so much so, that he bequeathed his wife
10,0001. fer life, &c.
Our hero was transported to New South Wales when very
young, and as far as we know, for neither an atrocious nor
consequential crime, some say for stealing geese. Wo do net
know either when he got married, and only remark, that his
wife was the widow of a man who had undergone the utmost
penalty of the law. Under such circumstances it was easy to
perceive to what kind of exertions Samuel Terry would pro-
bably resort, as soon- as he should have obtained some in-
dulgence, so profusely granted in those times—he established
a small sly grog and pawnbroker’s shop. Spirits were then
a guinea a bottle, and tobacco retailed for the weight of silver.
Te him resorted convict servants with some worn or question
able clothes, or other such property,which he again circulated
amongst associates and friends—
“ Higgling with convicts for their dirty clothes.”
It is easy to be conceived, how in a sprouting up colony,
enlivened by the liberal grants of the British Treasury,
such a business was capable of being increased, and how
it was really increased. But even with all this, we must look
deeper into Samuel Terry’s character, for being able to ex-
plain, how, even under the very favourable circumstances of
those colonial times, he could have laid the foundation of his
subsequent large fortune. Samuel Terry posssessed qualities
(a few of them useful ones) which under adequate circum-
stances will always produce a similar effect. He was ef per-
fectly sober habits, he was active andlndustrious;
and his whole philosophy consisted in having made up his
mind, of never giving value without obtaining value for it, and,
moreover, as much as only to keep his neck out of the baiter
or his legs out of chains. It is said that, notwithstanding, he
was punished corporally in the colony, but we should not be-
lieve that this could have been the case to any extent, else it
would necessarily have marred his increasing business.
However, Samuel Terry was cunning enough, and not at all
Bice to refuse any bargain where no legal danger was to be
apprehended. He left several valuable grounds which he
had purchased for a bottle of spirits ; or he advanced spirits
and tobacco, sued or caused to be sued for the debt, and
bought the ground at the sale of the sheriff. Whether Samuel
Terry ever foresaw to what value land would rise in the
colony, or whether it was accidental, that be endeavoured to
amass the only sort of property which was to be had in his
way ;f suffice to say, that as soon as this rise took place
, Samuel Terry was even on that score a rich man, and he must
1 have found to his groat surprise, and at the same time satis-
! faction, that those acres of his in and near Sydney, hitherto
' covered with filth and rubbish, were now wortn as much as if
they were pasted all over with banknotes. Samuel Terry
entered subsequently in some shipping speculations, but his
cunning and caution were so great, his economical habits so
unalterable, that we did not hear that he ever sustained any
considerable loss. It was at this time (about 20 years ago),
that being asked in some lawsuit, on his oath, how much he
believed he was worth, he answered, 90,000/. sterling. When,
or at what time, Samuel Terry received his emancipation ©r
| free pardon, is matter of indifference, because, with such a
mass of wealth, he could always obtain it, er disdain its pos-
session.


!• ft was at an early period of his career that he associated
with the Freemasons, perhaps also for that reason, of having
• right to be amongst some respectable men. However, we
I are induced to believe that his inborn and studied nijgard-
I linesa forsook him in the relations with that fraternity, and
i we have beard of some slight acts of charity he then per-
f formed. But scarcely have we uttered this encomium than
)we are obliged to mention a dork spot in his life. In the
' extensive business be was now engaged in he was obliged to
»have large amounts of cash about him, and one Sunday morn-
ing his iron chest” (proverbial in Sydney) was robbed of
* some thousand sovereigns. The deed was traced to a young
convict who lived in Terry’s service, and who, on account of
his engaging figure and good behaviour, had been hitherto a
. favourite 01 toe family, some gold coin having been found
: concealed in his shoes. He was capitally convicted. It is
' asserted that Samuel Terry obtained leave to visit him in
[ the cell, w hen he, under the explicit promise of obtaining his
pardon, induced the boy to disclose to him the spot in the gar-
• den where the money had been planted. We should believe
i that in these times a man of Samuel Terry’s affluence might
p'have been able to obtain anything in New South Wales. At
any rate, it is aaid4hat bo had given his word, still the boy
t was hung. The story rues that Terry since haunted by
the night of the executed, and in moments of anger bis re-
' lattons reproached him with the murder of the lad. A similar
j tragicaheyeut is related, in which Mr. A— General B— was
v eoiioeroeat This gentleman somehow or other got on inti--
Imate terms with Samuel Terry, and the latter Tent him on
one occasion 800/. Mr. B~ became afterwards embarrassed,
when Samuel Terry sold his valuable farm and got himself
1 possessed of it, which, at it is said, contributed at least to the
subsequent mental aberration of that gentleman. And now,
we are any of our readers, even of that class we are more
Immediately addressing, whether there Is any of them who
would covet Samuel Terry’s riches—riches, as it is already
> seen, tainted with the death, of •'favourite servant, and the
madness of a friend! We are sure, none ! none!
However, as even these are only, as it were, moral or ethic
disadvantages, we are, as we before said, reluctantly com-
pelled to show* Samuel Terry in his domestic circumstances,
and to investigate what comfort, enjoyment, and happiness,
have ever been his earthly lot. We will take up a period of
about six years back, when Samuel Terry Was in possession of
about 50,(XKV. sterling per annum, and in the very prime of
life. He lived then in the same place he died in—viz., a not
small, but unroomy, tasteful house in Pitt Anns, Sydney.
He rode at times a clumsy old charger, and passed many
hours of the day in talking, but iu bis shirt-sleeves. When he
had a friend with him, and was obliged to send for a bottle
of spirits to the party, he always smelled the breath of the ser-
vant, for fear that be might have drunk some. Mrs. Terry
never kept a female servant; she dressed in the meet simple,
nay coarse manner, arid was seen every Saturday on her knees
scrubbing out the whole premises. But os we have again
mentioned this female, who seems to have exercised some
influence over her husband’s conduct, it will not be out of,
the way to relate an anecdote of her, showing her niggardly,'
fearful, and narrow mind. About the time we speak of, a ■
certain university-bred man arrived in Sydney, who was in- j
troduoed to Samuel Terry by a gentleman ’of some rank.
The conversation turned amongst others about a certain ma-
nufacturing plan, which the former w ished to execute in New
South Wales. It was hinted atl that Samuel Terry should
take some interest in it, and 500/. or 600/. sterling mentioned I
as the sum required. Samuel Terry had listened with some j
attention to the proposal. When, however, the matter was
again broached a few evenings afterwards, Mrs. Terry
addressed the company in the following strain :—“ Mr.
Terry has no business to embark in speculations of
t bridrii he does not understand the nature. You may
the sum is only small, because Mr. Terry
is man | but there were richer people than we j
arc, who, after all, died in great misery and distress.”!
i Who is it, that does not see in these few words the pangs of a]
> mind, which in the possession of a princely fortune is still
remembering painfully the privations and the humbleness of
its former life, and is continually haunted by the thought that,
after all, misery and distress is still awaiting it ? > Ithongh
Samuel Terry in the latter years of bis life discounted yearly
300,000/. bills at 10 per cent., and as it is known that the
rental of his houses in Svdnev (cf which he possessed


an entire street), the produce of his farms, &c., amounted
to at least (>O,OOO/. or 70,000/. per annum, he jet lived
upon 500/. or 600/. a-year, taken at the outset ; and thus
it will be seen that his immense wealth was but a dead
incumbrance upon him. We would, in this instance,
compare him with a steam-carriage, of say two horses*
power, upon which the apparatus of steam-engines of 100
torses is stowed ; still {his dead burden does not increase the
power or the importance of the vehicle in the least, and thus
we would say, that Samuel Terry by all-his anxiety of mind
and niggardliness, never was a man but of 500/. per
annum ; and this sum certainly it is easy to realize by'd&s de-
grading and abject means than he had resorted to.
But we will now mention facts, which will not only exempt
Samuel Terry from being an object of envy, but reduce him to
that of a man to be truly pitied ; and if the proverb saying,
a end good, all good,” is correct, it certainly cnn in Us most
pointed contrast bo applied to him. About four yearsago, this
hitherto strong and healthy man was seized with a paralytic
stroke, which at once deprived him of the use of his right j
limbs. What misfortune for a man without mental re-1
sources, without inward consolation, without loving and sym- 1
pathyizing friends ! As Samuel Terry could not exercise now |
any active influence upon the members of his family, he \
became with some of them an object of contempt and desp'so,!
whilst in the mean time all their vicious propensities became
apparent. His son bad married a handsome and well-bred
emigrant, but being a drunken and brutal man, he lived
with her on the worst terms possible, and opened, in one of
his mad moments, her head with an iron poker. The rela-
tions appeared against him, mid the magistrates committed
him to take his trial. However, strange to say, he was (in a
case which neariy threatened his life) allowed to ball, and
the whole aflair was subsequently made up with money.
Even Samuel Terry himself was not exempted from the
brutal frenzy of this imbecile son, and he abused and
threatened him on many occasions. Samuel Terry for
the remainder of his life was unable to move without
the aid of two men, and thus extended in his open carriage,
pale and bloted, he drove about the domain of Sidney—a
silent but impressive example for any one, bow* illusive and
worthless at times wealth is, especially with a man like him,
and if obtained in a low and even questionable way. In these
drives he was generally accompanied by one of his convict
servants, because, notwithstanding that riches are omnipotent
in penal colonies, even those of Samuel Terry could not in-
fluence respectable men to associate with him but on busi-
ness. A*Mr. M. however (formerly a Wesleyan missionary),
when once in his carriage, broached cautiously the making of
his will, and the conversation turned on the subject, that
Samuel Terry thould bequeath behind one of his farms near
Sydney, for the sake of establishing a house of refuge on a
large scale, sufficiently endowed. We will see presently that
Samuel Terry’s will did not in the least realize these philan-
thropic hopes and suggestions of Mr. M.
However, it is the unfortunate lot of men, like the subject
of this paper, that even if they intend to be benevolent, they
pitch upon men of their own stamp, and do not derive
either me credit or satisfaction generally resulting from
such acts. Some years back S. M became a Metho-
dist, and constant attendant of sermons, which a Mr.
ITK • had established. This man posaesse&the gift of
uncommon good lungs, and voluntarily cryittg; besides
this, a thoroughly vulgar and illiterate man, Asitwasim^.
possible that ho could subsist merely on preaching, *he very
properly established a tobacco-shop, in which Samuel Terry
assisted him with the loan of some hundred ppnnds; yet by
hiis unbusinesslike and drunken habits he couple,
of yean, and was sold off. Samuel Terry bn finding himself!
mistaken in his •protege, or by the natural niggardliness of his
character, put mm into gaol, where M’K remained fof a
long time, attempted suicide, anti finally died miserable.
it would be superfluous to extend this paper any
further, as we are sure of navinggiven in these few lines every
thing characteristic of Samuel Terry. His illness became
more dangerous and more irksome from day to day, and he
died in the beginning of 1838, only 52 years of age, and there-
fore just at a period of life when riches, well and honourably
obtained, may be most quietly and beneficially enjoyed and
employed. His will was th%t of all vulgar misers, to wit, he


left his entire property to such as consanguinity and chance
bad placed round him, and there is not one word about a house
of refuge, or anything of a public bearing in it. The only
provision approaching to it is, that all his benevolent’kubscrip-
tions, perhaps 100/. a-year, should be continued for ten years
to cone.. He requested, also, that his fu r eral should take place
with masonic honours, perhaps again by the reason that
some respectable men should hare a pretext for following his
corpse.
Such was Samuel Terry, the richest outlaw whom the
Australian colonies yet possessed, and ever will possess, be*
cause times, and (very properly) circumstances also, have now
wonderfully changed. In a very lew years Samuel Terry, the
man, will he entirely forgotten, save in his substantial mone-
tary capacity and cognomen, “The Botany Bay Roths*
child!”
Wishing to conclude this paper with seme general re*
mark, we say, that the humbler classes of society may per-
ceive from the above history that a glossy coat does not
always conceal a worthy or happr heart —and that after
all, it is as true now' as it was eighteen hundred years ago,
when it' was said— ,
