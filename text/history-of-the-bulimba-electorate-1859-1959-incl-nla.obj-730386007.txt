History of
The Bulimba District ...
The Bulimba Electorate was constituted under the Electoral Districts Act of
1872 and was described geographically as follows
Commencing on the Brisbane River at the junctions of Norman Creek and
bounded thence by that Creek upwards to the west corner of portion 106 Parish
of Bulimba, thence by the northern boundary to the named road from Bulimba
to the Logan and from thence by the Logan River to its North and across to the
South end of Russell Island and thence to the Eastern short of Stradbroke Island
and continuing to the Eastern and Northerly shores of Moreton Island and then
South-west to Comboyuro Point and from there to the mouth of the Brisbane
River then upstream to the point of commencement. The area was 282 square
miles.
The area included all the territory east of the Brisbane River and the road
now known as the Pacific Highway and extended to the northern bank of the
Logan River ; also the seaside resorts Redland Bay, Cleveland, Wynnum and the
islands in Moreton Bay, North of and including Russell Island.
The district had 685 electors on the roll. The first member was the Hon.
William Hemmant after whom the township known as Hemmant was named.
The industries were almost completely primary with the exception of one tin
smelting works.
The principal township was Bulimba, described as follows :
Bulimba (60 Stanley) is a postal township in the Parish and Electoral
District of Bulimba.
It is situated on the creek of the same name, about two miles above its
junction with the Brisbane River. The district is agricultural and pastoral, the
cultivation of sugar cane being extensive and the manufacture of sugar being
the staple industry of the entire neighbourhood, which has no fewer than ten
sugar mills and one tin smelting works.
Bulimba is described in "The Jubilee History of Queensland" as a small
township about four miles distant from the City of Brisbane, and forms one of
its outlying suburbs. It sprang into existence only a few years back, and occupies
a position advantageous in several respects, possessing important gardens and
sugar mills, some of which have, however, been latterly interrupted in their
activity. Large tinsmithing works are here established, giving employment to a
considerable number of persons.


The attractiveness of Bulimba has drawn to its neighbourhood many retired
business people, and it is also the home of several who are still actively engaged
in trade.
The nearest Townships are Tingalpa 8 miles and Cleveland 15 miles distant.
The communication is by weekly mail coach and with Brisbane about 5 miles by
horse or dray to the junction of Bulimba Ferry and Breakfast Creek Roads and
thence by car or omnibus.
The soil is sandy and the country ridgy, the formation is generally carbon-
iferous. The population of the township numbers about 200 persons employed
in agricultural pursuits and at the sugar mills. There is a primitive Methodist
Chapel in the township.
The native name of Bulimba was "Tugulawah" now spelt Toogoolawah
meaning "heartshaped" indicating the "bend of the river." The "Boolimba"
of the Aborigines (meaning unknown) was at Whites Hill. The first settler at
Bulimba was D. C. McConnell later of Cressbrook. He built Bulimba House in
1850. This property is now owned and occupied by the Hon. A. E. Moore, who
was Premier of Queensland 1929-1932.
The Bulimba Creek was described as an important stream and it is clear
that from the early records the main settlement took place along its banks It
is stated as rising in the elevated land to the north of the Logan River and flows
north about 15 miles into the Brisbane River about 6 miles from its mout .
The creek waters a large area of agricultural land, nearly the whole of its banks
being taken up by settlers.
In a paper titled "Old Bulimba," produced and read by William Johnston to
the Historical Society of Queensland in August, 1917, incidentally Johnston
claimed to be and undoubtedly was the oldest white settler m Bulimba still a '"' e
in 1917 He was born at sea just outside Sydney Heads on 16th October, 1 8 ,
and arrived with his parents on board the "Lima" in Moreton Bay on the Ist
November the same year, His paper contained many interesting features dealing
with personalities, many of whom have descendants still living in the district We
are of the opinion that in attempting to record a century of progress of our
district such a work would not be complete without proper reference to the early
settlers who, through often difficult and trying conditions, established a successful
community. It is therefore with pride we pass on to you some of his work as
the historian of "Old Bulimba." Other settlers in Bulimba who arrived with the
Johnstons were the Thorpe Ridings, George Waldock and wife, and G. J. Watts.
Referring to D. C. McConnell, Johnston stated that McConnell was one
of the-earliest Moreton Bay settlers. He purchased from the Crown the area
of land at the end of Bulimba Point, and built his home, Bulimba House. The
house was bull, of grey freestone which was obtained from «htrt was
the Black Ball Quarry, which was on a site later occupied y ay
meat works, known as Queensport, McConnell grew maize and oatt which he
used as fodder for stock, mainly Devon cattle, which he imported for his pas,ora
holding he had taken up at Cressbrook. The cattle were rested and acclimatised
a, Buhmba before being transferred to Cressbrook. It consequently appear
certain that our district played quite an important part in t e es a ls
the great cattle industry. The firs, scrub farm of ten acres along rtttmw bank
was established by James Johnston and later Thorpe Riding, F. J. Watts, George
Smith and Challenger occupied adjoining farms.
The original homes consisted of timber slab walls and floors, with bar
white ant nests were used and made excellent ovens.


The only practical way to Brisbane was by boat ; the land route ran past the
present Bulimba Cemetery, through Burnett Swamp and Stones Corner to South
Brisbane and on to Brisbane. Other very early settlers upstream from the Ferry
were Sam Buckley, George Love, J. Pashen, J. Markwell, Smallman, Bostock,
Wood and Grey.
A migrant named Smallman is reported as having arrived in Bulimba in
1848, one of his daughters married a William Riding.
The first home on what is now known as Hawthorne Road was built by
the Jamieson Family. Early in the sixties a Captain Cairncross settled near
Colmslie, now the site of the dry dock named after him.
A migrant, J. Williams, settled near Queensport, and it was at this site
that saw the birth of the boat building industry so well known in the district.
A large barge was built at William's property, which was later converted to a
stern wheel steamer and was known as the "Gneering."
After the departure of the McConnells to Cressbrook, Bulimba House was
let to Sir Robert Mackensie who, with his New Farm wife, occupied it for some
time. One of Sir Robert's employees was a man named Uhlmann, whose
descendants are well known in the butchering and milk trade around Brisbane,
reference to one cf his sons, Joseph Uhlmann' will be found in the history of
local Government.
The property was later purchased by Donald Coutts who, in 1 864, divided
a large portion into quarter-acre blocks for sale. The land extended to the
Bu’imba Ferry and a considerable number of blocks were quickly sold. This
activity could be claimed to be the commencement of residential settlement
in the area.
The Bulimba Ferry dates from 1864 and was first operated by John Watson,
who purchased the allotment at the Ferry, where his late residence still stands.
Watson was a boat-builder by trade and had a varied career. He built the
Lytto.n Fort, which was used for the first time for defence in the first world war
in 1914. He also built the Mercantile Wharf opposite his home. He was at
cne time M.L.A. for Fortitude Valley and also Chairman of the Balmoral Shire
Council. One of the ferry employees was a woman named Annie Medland who
was a very capable oarswoman.
The first vehicular ferry was a steam paddle boat "Advance” fitted with
free steering control. This boat was transferred to one of the city ferries after
the 1893 flood. It was replaced by a wooden boat built and operated by J.
Nuttall, the method of propulsion being by winch and cable. This vessel was
replaced by the ferry boat "Hetherington" (reference to this boat appears in
the history of local government).
In 1862 Thorpe Riding visited England and brought back with him a
brother, John Riding, Daniel Baldwin and James Nuttall. These gentlemen were
the pioneers of many well known and respected descendants still residents in the
district.
Donald Coutts was killed, being kicked by a horse, and after his death
Bulimba House and the remaining farm land was divided into small farm blocks ;
these were occupied by Sam Woodland, John Thomson, Thomas Richmond, James
and Henry Carrothers, and Daniel Baldwin.
The earliest settlers grew mainly vegetables and maize; about 1856 bananas
were planted, and by 1862 they became the principal crop. All along the river


bank was a continuation of banana plantations. In 1862 very heavy floods
occurred and it was impossible to get to Brisbane ; the settlers had to live on
bananas for some time.
About this time the farmers were directed to sugar growing and what has
become one of the greatest primary industries in Australia, the sugar industry,
came into being. The acreage under sugar rapidly extended through a large area
of the Electorate. The first sugar mill was erected by the Hon. Louis Hope at
Ormiston in 1866. A rush for small mills followed and were erected at Hemmant
by Gibson & Sons, at Murarrie by Christopher Porter (who, incidentally, was the
first settler at Murarrie), at Springs by Dawson, at Doughboy Creek by Carlile, at
Kianawa by Kelk Bros, and Capt. Mackensie.
A further mill was established by W. Johnson in 1871 at Tingalpa on the
site of Kelly's brickyard; in 1884 Gibson Bros, migrated to Bingera and
established a sugar mill in that district which still operates. An experiment which
created Australia-wide interest and great political tension (the use of coloured
labour) was introduced in the original Bulimba Electorate on the Logan River area
and at Ormiston.
The first party of kanakas was shipped to Queensland by Captain Robert
Towns on the schooner "Don Juan" and arrived in Moreton Bay on August 14th,
1863. This batch were taken to work on a cotton plantation on the Logan
River at wages of 10/- per month and rations. The records state they were
comfortably housed. In July, 1864, Captain the Hon. Louis Hope landed 54
kanakas from the schooner "Uncle Tom." These men were employed clearing
land and planting sugar cane on land that he had purchased in the Ormiston
district. In the following years the use of coloured labour extended to the
Northern areas of the State. However, cheap labour was never very acceptable
to the average Australian and when the States federated the Commonwealth
Parliament decided that the islanders should be returned and the industry
conducted on a "white labour" basis. Parliament provided a bonus at the outset
and this action enabled the change to be successful. One consequence of the
abolition of cheap coloured labour was the influx of young men from the other
States to take up cultivation and cane-cutting for mills. Many of these remained
at the end of the season and became in turn, farmers and employers of labour,
principally along the northern coastal areas.
Sugar growing gradually disappeared from the Bulimba Electorate and general
mixed farming and small crops became the main products cultivated. Reference
to the sugar industry would not be complete without special mention of the
tremendous part played by the Gibson Family. In addition to erecting the largest
sugar mill in the district, they took up land in the Murarrie and Hemmant
district. Their first crop of sugar cane was crushed by a floating sugar mill
named "Walrus" which steamed along the banks of the Bulimba Creek and later
the Brisbane River harvesting and milling the cane then being grown in small areas
on the banks of the respective waterways. A very fair quality of sugar was
produced by this mill, though its appliances would in these days be regarded as
extremely primitive.
Machinery in all the original mills was primitive, horses were used as motive
power to turn the hardwood rollers which crushed the cane, which produced at
that time about one ton of sugar per day. Steam, however, was introduced into
the industry about 1873 and the Gibson Bros, were among the first to instal
steam powered plants capable of producing up to three tons per day. With the
introduction of more modern power, the floating mill "Walrus" went out of


existence as a sugar mill, but became established as a distillery. Walrus
Rum was well known in the late sixties.
It is of interest to record that the “Walrus" was a stern wheel steamer, and
was built at Cleveland as a schooner of 64 tons by Capt. Taylor Winship.
“The Jubilee History of Queensland," published in 1909 records that a Mr.
W. E. Burrell, “Chief Inspector of Excise in H.M. Customs Brisbane" who, in
early life had been a mechanical engineer, was of great service to the sugar
industry. He acted as manager for a number of mills including Porter's Mill on
Doughboy Creek, in the vicinity of the Murarrie railway station. He also managed
“Kelk's" Mill in the same locality, and later was also manager of the Farmers'
Co-operative Mill at Hemmant, the site of this mill was on the hill near the
monument. This mill commenced operations in 1872 and the mill-house was
built of bush timber with bark roof. The agreement with the farmers was that
the mill should retain one-half of the manufactured sugar, the balance going to
the grower.
Mr. Burrell also recounts his experiences as manager of the floating mill
Walrus which was fitted up as a sugar mill and distillery for the purpose of
utilising the cane grown by farmers on the Brisbane River and for which they had
no outlet at that time. The “Walrus" had been earlier engaged crushing cane
in the Doughboy Creek area, but the erection of several mills were able to cope
with the crops in that area and the “Walrus" was transferred to the river reaches
in the Fairfield and St. Lucia districts. Two small sugar mills were erected
in this locality. Messrs. Grimes at Fairfield and Dart at St. Lucia.
The senior Gibson, “William," had been trained as an agriculturalist ;
consequently he devoted most of his time to the growth of various types of cane
and the improvement and maintenance of the fertility of the soil.
The application of suitable fertilizers and the experimentation with new
varieties of cane were unceasingly watched and vigorously prosecuted. The
varieties of cane grown at this time are not now in cultivation ; they were known
as “Bourbon" and “Ribbon." The “Bourbon," though yielding a heavy crop of
cane was low in sugar content ; the “Ribbon" variety was a high quality cane.
The Gibson plantation at Hemmant was named “Clydesdale" and it is
interesting to note the market value of sugar in Brisbane in 1868 was £42 per
ton.
It was at this stage becoming obvious that the sugar industry was destined
to become one of the State's main primary industries and consequently it was
recognised that the district did not possess sufficient land the future of the
industry demanded. All interested in its development began to search for wider
fields for its advancement. Thus from an initial adventure in the Bulimba
Electorate there was iaid the foundation of a great industry which now stretches
over hundreds of miles involving millions of pounds, and provides a healthy and
prosperous existence for many thousands of Queensland citizens.
William Gibson resided in Hawthorne for many years prior to his death in
1915.
Other very early settlers included Capt. Switzer, who conducted a naval
school for cadets desirous of becoming officers in the merchant marine service.

Pianeers of the District ...
BULIMBA
Another very early settler in Queensland was Alfred Samuel Wright who
arrived in Brisbane with his wife in 1849. '
Mr. Wright, who was a warehouseman in England, served in the Queensland
lice Force for many years, including a period as Officer in Charge of the
women s compound, which was situated on the site of the G.P.O. in Queen Street
Bulimba 6nry T" iam nr™ Wri9ht ' and ~fathSr ° f N ° rman Wright senior of
Bulimba was born at the compound in 1854 (then N.S.W.). Mrs. Wright was
he daughter of another well known early identity, Captain Henry Page who, after
a varied career in Queensland, became the Captain of the S.S. Otter which
serviced the Government institutions at St. Helena, Peel Island and Dunwich for
many years. Mrs. Wright died in Sydney in her 98th year, survived by six
only (five sons and one daughter) of a family of thirteen.
Norman Reginald Wright, boatbuilder, Bulimba, spent a considerable period
cf his early life with his parents cn Coochiemudlo Island on a mixed farm a
venture which proved unsuccessful because of raids by blacks and whites on the
stock, pigs, calves, etc. The family returned to town and young Norman secured
a position with Laycock-Littledykes, then and still in Hershell Street. An accident
was responsible for his introduction into the boat building industry. Having
suffered a rather serious hand wound, he was unable to work for several weeks
and during this period he spent most of his time at John Hawkins Whereat's
boat shed at McConnell Street. Norman ,a lover of boats, was enchanted at the
sight of the beautiful work and boats housed in and near the boatshed. The
boats included the famous 22 footer "Bulletin," 25 footer "Gondolier," and
footers Ibex" and "Vera." Norman successfully applied for a job at
Whereats and thus began a long and still continuing career in the boat building
industry. Mr. Wright's reminiscenses bring to light many names of persons
well known to particularly the boating and sailing fraternity. In his opinion J. H.
Wnereat put the boat building industry on a firm basis. This firm built many
me boats up to 75 feet long, also numerous champion racing boats of all
dimensions. Alfred Perry, a first-class craftsman, skipper and athlete, was
associated with Whereats for over 40 years. During his employment at Whereats
Wright designed and built "out of cedar picked up in the mangroves on Peel
Island and scraps," the ten footer "Commonwealth," with which he won the
championship for three successive years. The first crew comprised his two
brothers Alf and Fred, and Bill Caniffe (an international Rugby League footballer),
and himself. In the off season fishing trips in George Crouch's famous fishing
boats to the sand hills on Moreton Island never failed to secure ample supplies
of fish.
One of the most successful boats, particularly in open bay races, a 22 footer
named "Gladys," was built by a group of Bulimbaites including Messrs. J.
Thomas, W. Davis, Geo. Porter and Wright in a yard at the rear of a cottage on
Ridings Hill overlooking the Candle Works ; there were no streets in this
locality and only a couple of houses at this time.
In 1909 Mr. Wright commenced business on his own account; an unknown
friend, through the agency of Bernard Caniffe, advanced £IOO to buy a business,
including a three year lease of a small cottage and a large block of land with


water frontage at Newstead. The business provided for slipping and caretaking
of boats. Mr. Wright asserts all he knew about business was hard work and,
being blessed with an almost tireless constitution, he successfully established the
undertaking. He relates being paid an account for £7OO in sovereigns.
A City Council decision to resume the water frontage from the Brisbane
Gas Coy. to Newstead Park caused the removal of the industry to the present
site in Bulimba, which was the site of a tin smelting works in the very early
days. This site was chosen because of the close proximity of the vehicular ferry
and consequently short distance to the heart of the city.
The outbreak of war in 1939 which extended to the Pacific with the entry
of Japan brought great responsibilities to the ship building industry.
Norman Wright and Sons and staff can look back with pride on their
accomplishments during the war, when all types of craft from small motor boats
to coastal patrol boats of up to 112 feet and a 225 ton vessel for special duty
in the eastern theatre was built. The latter vessel is now used as a cargo
boat in the Coral Sea area.
Mrs. Wright also was a member of a pioneering Bulimba family. Her
father, Mr. J. A. Thomas, being well known in Church activities as a lay preacher,
was a joiner at Dath Henderson's workshops. Mrs. Wright is also passionately
fond of sailing and has followed the fortunes of the various and many Bulimba
sailing craft for over sixty years ; consequently it does not surprise to learn that
Norman Jr., Ron and daughter Joyce are all champions in the sailing and
swimming events of more recent years.
The Wright family extends over five generations as residents in the Bulimba
district, covering a period of 110 years.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Manley, 74 Brisbane Street, Bulimba.
Arthur Manley arrived in Queensland in 1876, an infant six months old.
The family settled in Bulimba and began their colonial life in a tent situated in
scrub land near the present School of Arts. A bark hut which appears to have
been the early type of residence in those days" was soon established and was
occupied by the family for some years.
His father, Charles Henry Manley, an Englishman from London, followed the
occupation of painter for many years in Brisbane. Arthur Manley, at 82 years
of age, is still active and possesses a very retentive memory. He has lived all
his life from six months of age in Bulimba and is one of the longest living
residents in the Electorate.
He has vivid memories of Aborigines and blacks camps which existed in the
lower end of Brisbane Street, and the Riding Road area, which was then known
as the "Gambetta" estate. Much of the cultivated land in the area was under
sugar cane.
One of the earliest settlers in this locality was Arnold Wendt, who reared
a large family on a mixed farm, dairy and sugar. A migrant from Germany, he
proved to be an industrious, successful farmer, like many of his fellow countrymen
to whom many Queensland farming districts owe much. One of his sons became
established as one of Brisbane s leading printers.
The first shop in Bulimba was situated at the rear of an allotment near the
corner of Oxford and Bulimba Streets. It was constructed of timber slabs and
bark roof and was conducted by a Chinaman, popularly known as "Robert the
Chow."

One of the outstanding personalities among the early settlers was Caot

Colmslie House was in after years demolished and most of the timber was
used in the erection of a Hall in Hawthorne known as "Isons' Hall."
EaHy in 1865 Crouch Brothers, "fishermen," arrived from Botany Bay and
bought land on the r.ver bank, where a number of their descendants still reside.
Fk I A w° th i! r SeUler WH ° intr ° duCed a traditional English custom was a Captain
Ekelund, who was an eminent Military Officer of the British Army. He lived on
brL F r Bar J° n L ° dge ' and WaS 3 breeder of Shetland ponies. He also
bred English foxhounds and established a Hunters' Club. Hunts were arranged
gently, mamly on Saturday afternoons, and were carried out in typical English
as ion . unting attire, bowler hats, riding breeches were a must. There were
no foxes to hunt but that offered no difficulties to the hunters; a suitable
quarry was provided in a unique way. A young fleetfooted individual was
supplied with a length of cord to which was attached a salted fish, thus an
efficient trail was laid. The human fox was allowed a sufficient length of time
to get away before the hunt commenced. Then in true John Peel fashion "with
coats so gay," the bugle sounded and, hounds picking the scent, the hunt was
soon in full cry. It does not require much imagination by an Englishman to
visualise the glamourous scene. Thoroughbred horses, many ridden by beautiful
women immaculately attired, racing over the fields taking the two-rail fences in
their stride, and anxious to keep close to the hounds and be in at the kill
However, there was no kill, as the astute trail-maker, on hearing the
Huntsman s 'viewed halloo," quickly shimmied up the nearest tree safely out
o reach of the snarling pack. These hunts were patronised by the elite and
were the principal recreation for the horsemen and horsewomen of that time
Incidentally, the teenagers of that day were provided with excellent physical
exercise ; to follow a pack of hounds and keep in the chase demanded soundness
of wind and limb. At the end of the chase a respite was usually taken during

which teenagers would be profitably engaged exercising horses, while plans were
being devised for the next adventure. The hunting grounds extended from
Hawthorne to Murarrie.
Mail was originally delivered to the ferry house from whence it was
collected. Eventually a postal delivery was established ; the first postman was
Fred Parsons, whose mode of transport was per "penny farthing." For the
information of the modern people a "penny fathing" was a bicycle of that day.
It was so called because of the fact that it possessed two wheels, one much
larger than the other. The large wheel was fitted with pedals and the rider's
seat was positioned almost directly above the centre of the larger wheel ; the
small wheel was attached to the frame at the rear. To be a successful rider
required the agility of a cross-country runner plus the balance of a "Blondin"
or "broncho" rider. It is no exaggeration to state that mastering the "penny
rarthing required as much skill as is required by the average buck-jumping rider ;
little wonder the introduction of the solid, tyred, two uniformed size wheeled
cycle was titled the "safety" cycle. Reference to the "safety" cycle serves as an
introduction to another Bulimba pioneer who actually was the maker of the first
"safety" cycle in Queensland. Reginald R. Blunt, now in his nintieth year has
resided at 170 Brisbane Street, Bulimba, for many years. His father, Ned Blunt,
paiternmaker, was one of the early settlers in Bulimba and reared a large family
of seven sons and one daughter. Reginald is the last remaining son of hte
family, a real "chip off the old block," rugged and forthright. An engineer, in
addition to making and riding the first "safety" cycle, he is also credited with
designing and building the first internal combustion marine engine in Queensland.
He was ever ready to make available his special knowledge to various
establishments who at that time were courageous enough to instal engine power.
The Brisbane Fire Brigade frequently sought his advice and assistance and it
would be no exaggeration to state that he was virtually on call at any time to that
important public institution. Reg, like many other Bulimba pioneers, was
an ardent sailing enthusiast and his greatest delight was to be one of the
competitors in the battles of the little ships. His reminiscenses of sailing and
the Humpybong Regatta in particular were colourful and most interesting.
Another personality still well remembered by the original school children
attending the Bulimba School was Tom Taylor. Tom was a kindly, courteous
character, who lived something like a hermit. His habitation was in the nearby
bush and of a very primitive nature. How he existed was one of the mysteries
of that time. His only evident source of income was by the sale of mushrooms
when available. He possessed a long white flowing beard and it is probable that
its likeness to that well-known traditional character "Santa Claus" was in the
main, responsible for his popularity with the school children.
The first baker at Bulimba was Thomas Law. He established a bakery and
shop in Church Street, now known as Birkalla Street. He was a strong man and
became a familiar sight delivering his bread on foot, with a huge basket perched
on his head.
The record of Bulimba pioneers would not be complete without reference to
Sam Buckley, a migrant from Derbyshire. He and his family worked the ferry
for a number of years. Sam was a convivial soul and a lay-preacher of some
repute. Sam kept up the good old English custom of raising the neighbourhood
every Christmas morning by patrolling the district singing carols. He was the
oldest scholar alive when the new Bulimba State School was opened and he was


given the honour of ringing the bell on that occasion. SanVs favourite song was
"Somebody Bigger Than You and I."
Other early settlers who played an important part in the development of
Bulimba include A. Harrison, who served as a Councillor on the Balmoral Shire
Council and for a number of years as Chairman ; in the first Greater Brisbane
Council he was elected as Alderman, a fitting tribute to a gentleman in every
sense of the word who gave unstinted support to every worthwhile cause in the
interest of the citizens.
Joseph Uhlmann, big in stature, heart and mind, also served his district in
the Balmoral Shire Council. His main characteristic was thoroughness in every-
thing he said and did.
Samuel Demack, Storekeeper ; Henry Thomson conducted a blacksmith
business and afterwards successfully entered the entertainment world, erected the
well-appointed Avro Picture Theatre. Thomas Eustace, ardent labour supporter,
respected by all. William McLeod, active in School of Arts, and Masonic circles.
George Porter, Registrar-General, now resident of Redcliffe. Charlie Nequs,
James Sykes, temperance advocate secretary Rechabites and Bulimba School of
Arts. Aif Whereat, Frank Watts, Crouchs, all associated with the boat-building
industry ; Fred Clothier, "Stonemason" Joseph George, and Jack Pashen, the
well-known Brisbane clergyman. Rev. Ron. E. Pashen is a grandson of George
Pashen. Geo. Love, "a cooper," father of later well-known (cricketer) Luke and
(footballer) Barry, and C. J. Ross.
HAWTHORNE
Hawthorne was so named by William Baynes, Founder of Baynes Bros., who
established a meat works at Queensport. He build Hawthorne House and planted
a number of hawthorn bushes. He was elected M.L.A. for Burnett and sold the
property to R. M. Stewart, M.L.A., who lived there for many years. The present
Virginia Avenue was originally the drive through the estate to the residence. At
the entrance of Hawthorne Road there was a gate-house occupied by an employee
whose duty it was to screen intending visitors. The estate was eventually
sub-divided into residential blocks and were quickly purchased and improved.
Hawthorne House was destroyed by fire and a less pretentious dwelling took its
place The Hawthorne Ferry came into operation and the original site being
from the end of Uhlmann Road and diagonally across the river to connect with
Dickson Street near the C.S.R. sugar refinery. The ferryman, M. Lucas, lived
in the above-mentioned gate-house. He was of sterling character and considered
his duties as ferryman included the safe escorting of his particularly young female
passengers after dark safely to their homes. His popularity to teenagers and
parents became legion. With the advent of the tram lines from the Valley via
Merthyr Road, the ferry was removed to its present site.
Early settlers still alive include Mr. & Mrs. D. Daniels, Harris Street , Mrs.
Fullar, Virginia Avenue; The Cross Brothers, Fred. Walter, and Harry and
Charlie Nicholls, Joe Clothier, Bill Lindsay.
Mrs Daniels, one of a family of eight arrived in Brisbane in 1887 on the
sailing ship "Duranda." The family settled at Galloways Hill in the then tropical
fashion in a bark hut, with beds consisting of hessian sacks filled with corn
husks Mrs Daniels recalls that the nearest available water obtainable was a
chain of water holes in Riding Road, from which domestic water was secured.
The family washing was taken to the pools to eliminate the necessity of carrying
water Kangaroos and wallabies were plentiful and Mrs. Daniels retains a vivid


recollection of getting a fright from a large kangaroo which showed more than
ordmary inquisitiveness and chased after them. The first residence on Galloways
H,H' Cawmore Wood/' was built by Donald Mackay, who was a Portmaster ;
one of his sons, Roy, was a well-known public servant and attained to the positio
of Assistant Under Secretary of the Health and Home Affairs Department. Mrs
Daniels relates that a large aboriginal camp existed in the area now Hawthorn
Park.
Other early settlers in the Virginia Avenue area were Gillbanks and J. B
Henderson, a well-known government engineer; Andrew Mott, wharf builder
Aaren Sargent, founder of Sargents Foundry ; R. T. Cross, father of the well-known
barrister F. T. Cross; and S. D. Fletcher, well-known legal personality; H. Fullar
Superintendent of Mails.
The Hendersons and Gillbanks' residences have since been included in the
Lourdes Convent buildings. The former residence being part of the Conven
School, and the latter is now in use as the convent music room. Anothe
prominent early residents were the Parry-Okeden family. Mrs. Daniels was an active
church worker, being one of the earliest members of the Bulimba Church a
England. Mr. & Mrs. Daniels have resided in Harris Street for 60 years.
Mrs. Fullar took up residence in Virgina Avenue in 1891 as a bride, and is
still living in the same house. Mrs. Fuller, now 90 years of age, retainl happy
recollections of her early years in Hawthorne. Mr. Fullar, a Postal Official, was
frequently called on to work late and consequently Mrs. Fullar was glad o 1
ferryman Lucas as escort from ferry to home. The most popular outings of her
young days were boat trips by paddle steamers "Alice" and "Natone" to the
aquarium at Hemmant or the Botanical Gardens.
Mrs. Fullar recalls the destruction by fire of Hawthorne House which was
at that time occupied by McGillycuddy's who were visiting hte Fullars at the
lime and were enjoying a game of cards when Mrs. Fullar noticed smoke issuing
from the roof. Barton Lodge, occupied in turn by the Ekelunds, Coes and
Highfields, was the centre of gaiety for a considerable number of years.
R. T. Cross, a tailor, built a residence in Malcolm Srteet in 1887; it was
the third building in the street, the others being occupied by Messrs. Brown and
Alec Gooaall, the latter gentleman became well known as the Captain of the
dredge Bonita. Fred Cross resided in Hawthorne for many years before
transferring to Lota, where he still resides. He was one of a three-man commission
appointed to investigate the dutuies of the Brisbane Alderman and to recommend
what was considered an appropriate salary. The finding of the commission was in
favour of a considerable increase. An unusual feature of this commission was
that no fees were received by the members of the commission. Harry Cross has
resided in Hawthorne all his life and his reminiscenses of early Hawthorne are
full of interest. All children from Hawthorne attended the Bulimba State School ;
the track to school led through what was then known as "Paddocks," bearing the
name of the then occupiers. Clark's paddocks, now known as Leura Estate ;
Woodland's paddocks used in the early days of aviation as a landing area.
Knight's paddocks, the site of Walter Carr's vineyards ; Jamieson's paddocks, the
rear of which were cultivated by chinamen as gardens. It is of interest to note
that peanuts was one of the crops grown in the area.
Joseph Silver Collings, well known in political circles as a senator, was a
resident of Hawthorne for many years, portion of which his family were occupants
of Hawthorne House. Joseph and Mrs. O'Brien reside in Dutton Street ; they
are particularly well known as tennis enthusiasts. They built their own court and

many of the local youngsters have cause to thank the O'Briens for the ready
assistance and encouragement they received.
W. G. Hardcastle, an educationalist, took a prominent part in the advance-
ment of the district, gave many years of service in the local Progress Association.
A small park near the Hawthorne Ferry was named in his honour.
Walter G. Ison, popularly known as "W.G.," arrived on a migrant ship in
1883. A blacksmith by profession he established the well-known blacksmith and
wheelwright business in 1884 in South Brisbane. He came to reside in Haw-
thorne in the early nineties. A keen lover of horses, he became an ardent
supporter of trotting and was the owner of many prominent trotters. A good
sportsman, he was a generous supporter of all sporting clubs in the district and
could never resist the youngsters' appeal for assistance in the procuring of a bat
or ball.
The need for a public hall in Hawthorne as a meeting place for the various
organisations became urgent and "W.G." decided to solve the problem. He
purchased Colmslie House, which had fallen into disrepair, and demolished the
building and used the timber to erect a hall which was given the name ''lson's
Hall." The hall served the district for about 30 years when it was destroyed
by fire. His descendants include five sons and two daughters who are still
residents in the district.
MORNINGSIDE
Morningside was so named because the rising sun shines on the adjacent
hills, thus indicating the district is the morning side of the city. Similar to the
other districts in the electorate Morningside owes much to its pioneers.
The longest living resident is James Rossiter, who resides with his wife
Emily at 67 Kates Street, Morningside. Mr. Rossiter was born at Enoggera in
July, 1872, and came to reside at Morningside in 1875, when he was three years
of age. Mrs. Rossiter, one of the Longlond family, came to Morningside as a
bride in 1884. Mr. Rossiter, in his eighty-four years as a resident, has seen
many changes. His parents, Edmund John and Isobel, built a slab humpy on land
situated near Bridgewater Road, and known later as the "Union Jack" estate.
Edmund Rossiter, a tanner by trade, established a tannery for the purpose of
treating Marsupial skins ; the business rapidly increased and all classes of hides
were treated. On the retirement of the father, James, with his brothers, purchased
the business and operated for some years, but had the misfortune to suffer a
fire which destroyed the tannery. Edmund built the first house in the locality.
It was a two story structure, and still remains on the original site at the corner of
Bridgewater Road and Rossiter Street. The building of the Cleveland railway lire
cut off a section of the land.
The young Rossiters attended the Coorparoo State School, walking the
distance and back through a bush track. After several years they attended the
Bulimba State School, and finished their education at the Kangaroo Point State
School. "Shanks pony" was the mode of transport to each school. Mr. Rossiter
relates that, as a teenager, he frequently, with his mates after tea, walked into
Queen Street to take part in the band marches and afterwards walked back home.
There was only one road in existence known then as Cleveland Road, now
the main thoroughfare, Wynnum Road. Cobb & Co. Mail Coach passed through
daily except Sunday. The first shop in Morningside was built on a site on the
Southern side of the main shopping centre. It was also the first Post Office ;
the shop is still in existence, and is now occupied by a Ladies' and Gents' Hair


dressing Salon. The Post Office was later transferred to a srnall shop, near the
railway station, and occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Fred. Allison, and the postal
affairs were conducted by them.
The largest owner of land at that time was David Longland. He owned what
was known as "Morningside Estate." This estate included most of the area
within the boundaries of Wynnum, Thynne, Lytton and Junction Roads. This
area was subdivided into acre blocks and several dairies were established for the
supply of fresh milk to the increasing number of residents.
Tobacco was grown on land on the "Union Jack Estate adjacent to the
Richmond Road quarry.
The Rossiters were married in the Tingalpa Church of England by the Rev.
H. Molesworth in 1894, ar.d celebrate their sixty-fifth wedding anniversary on
October 17th this centenary year.
Mrs. Julia Sleeman, now in her ninety-first year, was born at Kangaroo
Point and came to reside in Morningside at the age of twenty-three, and has
lived in the district for over 60 years. Her early years were spent in domestic
service in the employ of the Cairncross family, who resided in a substantial
residence known as "Colmslie House" on a site near the junction of Thynne and
Lytton Roads on the northern side of the latter road. Mrs. Sleeman relates that
on her day off she walked to the Bulimba Ferry and travelled from there to the
Valley by horse-drawn tram. During their early married life the Sleeman's visited
New Zealand and on their return they purchased an acre of land and erected a
humpy there in which most of the family were reared. Eventually a new residence
was built in which Mrs. Sleeman still lives. She stated that Morningside was
more peaceful then than now.
Mrs. Agnes O'Toole, Beverley Street, Morningside, now 87 years of age,
has been a resident of the district for over sixty years. The O'Toole's first
settled in a small cottage in the only residence at the time in Key Street, a short
distance from the rear of the site occupied by the Balmoral Shire Council.
Mrs O'Toole recalls an exciting, anxious adventure ; young Pat, then about
two years of age, had ‘wandered into the thick bush. Searchers traced his
footprints in the dust-laden track, "the main Cleveland Road," which he had
crossed. He was found unharmed in thick scrub at a spot at the rear of the site
now occupied by Barry & Roberts store, actually near the hub of the now mam
shopping area. Husband Jeremiah was employed by the Balmoral Divisional
Board cracking stone on piece-work. His services were dispensed with for the
reason, it was stated, his earnings were too heavy a drain of the council finances.
The nearest Doctor lived in Vulture Street, South Brisbane. His visits to
the district were made in a carriage drawn by a pair of fast ponies.
After a short period of residence in Bulimba an area of land,, a portion of
the original Morningside Estate, was purchased and the O'Toole's established
themselves in the dairying industry. The demand for residential sites caused the
disappearance of the dairy but O'Toole's as milk distributors remain, and the
early morning patter of horses hooves on the bitumen streets serve as a reminder
of byegone days.
Other very early residents in the district were the Stratford and Blake
families, the former removed to Hawthorne near the river where some of their
descendants still reside. Capt. Law Johnson, a "retired mariner," conducted a
small dairy farm on Lytton Road for many years.


The opening of the Cleveland Line in 1889 and the provision of rail
transport resulted in marked progress and a quick rise in the population. The
early settlers of this period included the families of Tom Allen, Stephen Bartlett,
Charles Crowther, Charles Stanton, Ezra Firth, Joseph Briscam, Fred. Allison,
Alexander Munyard, W. Coates, J. Danaher, E. Ccstin, W. Gibson, R. B. Stark,
"joint founder of Allan & Stark's," A. Horne, A. E. Smith and J. P. Atkinson,
"founders of the well-known firm Smith and Atkinson." S. Hill, an early store-
keeper ; he erected a small hall known as Hills Hall adjacent to his store, served
the districts as a meeting place and dance hall till the erection of the School of
Arts ; it was later converted into and still exists as a residence. C. Parrott,
W. Harvey, C. J. Irish, W. Fitchew and E. Crowther were amongst the early
settlers in the Richmond Road area. The Schodel family, who were responsible
for the erection of the Morningside Picture Theatre. Nurse Lawson, "midwife,"
enjoyed much popularity for many years, was responsible for the safe arrivals of
a large number of present-day Morningside district residents.
Capt. Switzer was well known in the pilot service for many years. His
residence is still occupied by descendants. An unusual feature of this property,
"a suburban allotment" it possesses a street frontage on all four sides.
NORMAN PARK
Norman Park was so named after Sir Henry Wylie the seventh Governor of
Queensland.
Norman Creek. The name is claimed to be a corruption of Gormans Creek
after Leiut. Gorman of H.M. Fort, the last commandant at Moreton Bay. Baker's
atlas 1 846 has it mapped as Gorman's Creek.
The new bridge opened for traffic in recent years has been named "Canning"
bridge.
The earliest settlers in the district included Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Weir
who purchased from Capt. Louis Hope an extensive area of land extending from
near the creek to a stort distance frem the top of Galloway's Hill, on the southern
side of the main road. They were engaged in dairying .and in addition leased an
area of land in Hawthorne for grazing purposes. Weir's residence, probably the
first to be erected in Norman Park, was situated near the main road, almost
opposite the approach to the Norman Park to New Farm ferry landing. Weir
was a keen horticulturist with a passion for roses, with which he circled the
house property. He also cultivated an archway of lantana.
The property became known as one of Brisbane's beauty sports and war
one of the attractions offered to overseas and interstate visitors ; in addition the
sightseeing visits by Brisbane elite in carriages drawn by handsome horseflesh
and driven by liveried groomsmen were quite an attraction for the residents of
that period. Weir migrated to the Ballarat district, joining in the gold rush in
that area. A daughter, Mrs. Barnett, remained in Norman Park. The Barnetts
erected the residence known as "Kurilpa" and situated on the main road near
the creek. This residence has been occupied practically continuously by
descendants of the Barnett family, covering four generations, and extending over
a period of nearly 80 years. During the '93 flood Mr. Barnett, snr., rowed a boat
in a direct line from the rear steps of "Kurilpa" to Stones Corner.

greater part of her life, relates that aborigine camps existed in the Gillam Street
area and that corrobories were held frequently on the banks of the creek.
Other early settlers in the district included the following families : Wilson,
Sinden, Mackay, Robay, Frost, Terry, Firman, Ham, Henderson, Porter, Atherton,
Petersen, Swanwick, Hatton, Gilmore, and Knight.
The first residence in Norman Crescent was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. T.
H. Wilson, "the founders of the Wilson Waratah foundry," for many years.
The Frost family lived on a small dairy farm situated between Norman
Avenue and the creek ; the property suffered severe damage in a flood and the
farm was abandoned.
Ashley Terry opened the first shop at Galloway's Hill as a mixed business,
and Nick Terry later established a business as a farrier and general smith in this
locality.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Sinden and family from Faversham, England, took up
residence at Galloway's Hill in 1887. Miss Alice Sinden married Mr. Alf Stanton
and this couple will be remembered as storekeepers and newsagents at Galloway's
Hill corner shop for many years. Mr. and Mrs. Stanton now live in retirement
in Hipwood Street.
Oscar Petersen built the first residence in Longfellow Street in which the
family resided for many years and is still occupied by descendants of the family.
The only other residence in this locality was the railway crossing gate-house,
known as Hardy's gate-house. Hardy, the occupier, was a ganger on the railway.
The railway crossing was situated near the eastern end of the station platform
and was the roadway connecting Norman Avenue and Myall Street, prior to the
erection of the railway station.
The Knight family originally conducted a small dairy farm and later
conducted a small business. One of their sons, J. J. Knight, became a leading
Brisbane journalist and will be remembered by many as editor of the Courier-
Mail for several years.
Prominent personalities in later years included A. Barker, F. Clarkson, both
of whom served the district on the Balmoral Shire Council ; J. Thomson, who was
head teacher at the Norman Park State School for many years ; Geo. Gunnis, the
founder of the broom factory still operated by descendants; W. P. Prout, an
energetic worker for the Anglican cause; G. H. Turner, well-known builder and
contractor responsible for the erection of several prominent city buildings, and
still a resident in the district; Lance Frew, the founder of the Norman Park
picture theatre, an accountant by profession, the possibilities of the film industry
as suburban entertainment captured his imagination and he became one of the
pioneers in this section of the industry. He was also a successful water diviner
and his services in this connection were frequently in demand, particularly in the
Cleveland and Redland Bay districts.
H. S. (Racy) Macpherson was principle of one of the leading Brisbane legal
firms. His former spacious home, now used as an aged persons' retreat, known
as "Bethany."
E. A. "Ernie" Macpherson, director of the then well-known firm Waugh &
Josephson, machinery merchants. His residence bequeathed to charity and now
in use as a home for girls.


The Norman Park district is remembered as one of the centres of the now
defunct sport "lacrosse/' introduced into the district by the Wilson family. The
game enjoyed much popularity in the early 1920's until the outbreak of the
second world war. Players included Clarkson brothers Jack and Fred, N. Thorn-
sett, A. Garvie, C. Klingner, H. Henderson, J. Johnson, and the Wilson Bros.
Norm Wilson, as a member of the Toombu! Club, was selected in the Queensland
team in interstate matches.
Extensive reclamation work by the City Council in recent years has converted
low-lying swamp areas into excellent playing grounds which will benefit future
generations in this well-developed residential suburb.
CANNON HILL
Cannon Hill, so named by Thornhill Weedon (for many years Government
statistician) because of the similarity of two fallen tree trunks to military guns.
The Weedon family erected one of the earliest residences in Cannon Hill,
a fine palatial building built entirely of cedar. It was situated near the top of
the hill almost opposite the Cannon Hill State School. It carried the name
"Jollimont" and was in turn occupied by G. T. Bell and Clement Wragge, the
latter well known as a weather forecaster. The residence was completely
destroyed by fire in 1 927. Some of the tree which were planted on the property
still remain. Originally a circular drive girded by huge bamboo clumps provided
a screen to the building.
Another early residence was situated on the present site of the abattoirs.
The site was at that time the apex of the hill and which was removed and
levelled to provide room for the abattoir buildings. The residence possessed a
commanding view of river and bay and was believed to have been occupied for
some time by Sir Thomas and Lady Mclllwraith. It was also later occupied by
the Shand family, who were closely associated with the early history of Cannon
Hill. George Angus Shand, born in Newcastle, England, of Scotch parentage,
arrived in Australia in 1866 on the sailing ship "Great Britain." He first resided
with his father in N.SiW., establishing a meat preserving works at "Booyoolee."
A specialist in meat preserving, his services extended to South Australia
where he supervised the "Conrad Meatworks." In the nineties he was appointed
manager of the Queensport Meatworks, a position he retained for over 30 years.
Mr. Shand was one of the first exporters of frozen meat to England. He retired
when the business was sold to Anglis & Co. The Shands reared a large family
and his interests in the meat preserving industry have been retained by some of
his sons in various States of the Commonwealth.
Christian Uhlmann and family owned a large area of land extending to and
along the banks of Bulimba Creek, which has since been sub-divided, and much
of it is now occupied by residences. His sons Austin Roy and Stewart have all
resided in Cannon Hill for many years.
Other prominent personalities and families who have resided at Cannon
Hill for many years include the Acworth, Gleeson, Hoge, Radford, 0 Hagan,
Kniepp, Toyne, Stanton, Wakefield, Bartlett, Linton, Love, O'Sullivan and Moore
families.
Most of these families have descendants still resident in the district.


The name Harry Marshall deserves special mention. He gave continuous
voluntary service to the district for many years in various organisations devoted
to the public welfare. His passing recently removed one of the districts best-
known citizens.
The establishment of large industries assures this district of a successful
and progressive future.
MURARRIE AND HEMMANT DISTRICTS
''Murarrie," said to be a native word meaning "plenty of water. The first
white settler in Murarrie was, "according to the records," Christopher Porter,
who took up an area of land and engaged in agricultural production including
sugar. He also erected a small sugar mill on his property. A son, Fred Porter,
was one of the pupils enrolled on the opening day of the Bulimba School in 1866.
Another very early settler was J. Williams, who obtained a river frontage
area and engaged in boat building.
The Murarrie and Hemmant districts have at all times been closely allied,
when the first meat treatment works were established at Queensport the workers'
children enrolled at the Hemmant School. The families of Panske, Ladewig and
Stirling were among the early enrolments. Stirling senior was the engineer at the
meat works, having transferred from the Clydesdale Sugar Mill. Incidentally, he
was the great grandfather of the well-known Brisbane woman journalist, Joyce
Stirling.
President residents who have lived the longest period in Murarrie are Mr.
and Mrs. Tom Gilbert, Queensport Road. The Gilberts purchased land at fifteen
pounds per allotment. They lived in a humpy for several years pending the
erection of their residence, which was the second house to be erected on Queens-
port Road, then a mere dirt tract. The first residence was erected by George
Johnson. Washing water was secured only from nearby water holes which
provided permanent water for this purpose. Drinking water was secured from
the horse trough in the Buruda meat works property and was carried over a
half-mile on a yoke in kerosene tins, an 80 lb. load after the day s work had
finished.
The Gilberts reared a family of eleven and Mrs. Gilbert recalls that a visit
by the doctor from Wynnum cost £3/3/-, and by way of comparison Mrs. Gilbert
assisted some migrants "living in tents nearby, minus cooking facilities by
providing a three-course meal for ninepence.
Visitors in the district were rare and mainly consisted of seamen "from
ships at anchor in Queensport," whose main request were directions to the nearest
"pub" which, incidentally, was the "Queensport Hotel" at Hemmant, so named,
it is claimed, because most of the customers were employees at the Queensport
Works.
Other old residents still living in Murarrie include Messrs. Hall, Radcliffe
and Spillane.
The settlement of Hemmant, then known as "Doughboy Creek," began in
the 1859's when migrants of English, Scotch, Dutch and German nationalities
purchased land at prices ranging from £1 to £3/10/- an acre. Descendants of
these early settlers still in the district include the Lanes, Franklin, Uhlmann, Kelk,

O'Neill and Car li 11. The settlers were industrious and efficient and scrub land
was soon transformed into well laid out farms.
The first crops included vegetables of all varieties and were transported by
the only existing method, "river punts" to a wharf near the Customs House. In
1864 sugar was introduced and for several years became the main product grown.
(Reference to this industry is made in another section of this book).
The erection of the bridge over Bulimba Creek in 1870 saw the introduction
of road transport and soon after all classes of horse-drawn vehicles were com-
missioned.
A horse bus service from Lytton through Hemmant to the Bulimba Ferry
was inaugerated by a Mr. Longden, and his exclusive use of grew horses main-
tained a colourful and popular passenger service prior to the erection of the
Cleveland railway line. A good gravel road between the Bulimba Creek to the
monument was built by George Lane.
In 1887 plans for a single track railway line from Park Road to Cleveland
was approved and the contract price of £91,498/16/7 by G. C. Wilcocks was
accepted. The line was finished in November 1889.
Grape vineyards and a wine production plant was established and this
enterprise flourished for some years, however the vines were attacked by disease
and general cultivation for producing wine petered out.
Bulimba Creek in this period was an excellent fishing ground ; the Kanakas
employed in the sugar industry were keen fishermen and landed many big fish as
a supplementary food.
After the cessation of sugar cultivation vegetable crops, including sweet
potatoes, were grown, meatworks offal being obtainable cheaply for fertilising.
The rapidly-growing population of the eastern suburbs of Brisbane created an
ever-increasing demand for the supply of fresh milk and, in consequence, dairying
was successfully introduced by Messrs. Uhlmann, Yeo and Franklin. Others
followed suit and it was not long before a fleet of milk carts rumbled through the
district in the early hours to provide suburban residents with their breakfast
supply. Dairying has proved to be the most successful venture and will without
doubt continue to be as such until crowded out by population or industrial
expansion.
The Franklin, Carlill, Yeo and Brock families are descendants of pioneer
dairymen are are still actively engaged in the industry.
Sergeant Henderson was the district's first police officer. He, with Mrs.
Henderson and family of four, walked from Bulimba ferry to open the station in
the early 80's. Thomas Henderson, later well-known educationalist, was a son.
In the early days the island situated between the Brisbane River and the
Bulimba Creek was known as Brophe Island," named after a hermit farmer of that
name who lived alone. The island was later named "Gibson" in memory of an
engineer of the Harbour and Marine Department who was in charge of dredging
operations in the river.
The victims of the bubonic plague which occurred in 1899 were interred
on the island.
The first baker was Mr. Smith, and Mr. Condingly opened the first black-
smith's shop of Laidlaw Bros., "forebears of the well-known produce merchants,"
operated a store.


The history of this district would be incomplete without reference to the
"Aquarium" which was established by a company as a recreation resort and zoo
for the enjoyment of city folk. The aquarium was situated near the Bulimba
Creek adjoining the sire now occupied by Morgan's caravan park. The joint
managing directors were Messrs. Luckman and Codings (father of the late
Senator Joseph Silver Codings). A two story building 150 by 50 feet was erected
and decorated and furnished with mirrors and large chairs and a dining room
was provided. Animals on show included bears, lions, tigers and monkeys, and
there were also birds, fish and reptiles.
Switch-back railways, a flying machine and merry-go-rounds electrically
equipped contributed to the amusements. The company secured several ships,
the "Natone," "Woolwich" and "Garnett," to carry passengers from a city
wharf. During the holiday season extra ships were required to cope with the
crowds. When it is remembered that these were the days before the cinema,
it is not difficult to visualise the attraction the venture would be to the teenagers
of that time.
The disastrous flood of 1893 included the Aquarium as one of its victims.
The creek, held back by tha flooded Brisbane River, broke its banks and flooded
all the surrounding country.
The aquarium animals (with the exception of the bears) were saved and
sold to a circus ; apparently the bears were washed away.
The wooden building was saved and used for dances till 1901 ; in that year
a welcome home was given there to the local men who returned from the Boer
War. The building was later demolished and provided enough material to build
three houses at Wynr.um North ar.d are still occupied. The company's ships
were sold, the Woolwich to Sydney and the Natone to Tasmania.
Incidentally, large quantities cf timber were piled feet high on Brophe's
Island and a house which was built from timber washed down by flood waters
still stands on a site near the Queensport Hotel.
TINGALPA
The nomenclature of Queensland describes Tingalpa as a village near
Wynnum, also a creek (obviously Bulimba).
It was named by an early surveyor (name not known) from the native word
"Tinggal" meaning fat and "Pa" meaning the place of the place of fat
kangaroo.
Tingalpa was an important centre, being situated on the main coach road
on which Cobb & Co.'s mail coach operated at first twice weekly and later daily
from Brisbane to Cleveland, except Sunday. The records show that there was
one hotel known as the Royal Mail ; it is still in existence and is probably the
oldest hotel in the district. It is claimed, and probably correctly, that the coach
horses were changed at the hotel on both the inward and outward journeys.
One of the earliest settlers and certainly one of the most versatile was
Alexander Kelly, who arrived as a migrant from Scotland about 1860. Alex had
learned the trade of farrier and general blacksmith. He had also qualified as a
veterinary surgeon, and in addition was a qualified surveyor. He actually com-
menced to practice as a vet, but found business very slack ; horse flesh was too
cheap and a fresh supply cheaper than the services of veterinary science. He
consequently turned to his original trade and established a shoeing and general


smith shop in Burnett Lane and Adelaide Street on a site now occupied by
Allan & Stark.
The Bulimba Divisional Board held its first meetings at the Kelly home at
Tingalpa ; later the Board purchased the property afterwards occupied by the
Shire Council at Morningside, and Alex was appointed supervisor and resided
on the property for several years. During his period of residence at Morningside
he was commissioned by the Government to survey the land in the St. George and
Surat Districts, being granted leave of absence by the Divisional Board. At the
completion cf the survey he returned to the duties of supervisor of the Divisional
Board.
He erected sugar mills, one at Hemmant and one at the home site at
Tingalpa ; both mills operated till sugar cultivation ceased. He also erected
slaughter yards at Murarrie which were operated by the "Rosewarne Meat Coy."
and later "Acme" preserving company.
The collaDse of the sugar industry in the district made it necessary to look
for other avenues and Kelly turned to brickmaking. Fire clay equal to the world's
best was available on the property at Tingalpa. Samples of fire clay were
exhibited at the British Franco exhibition and secured all prizes against all
competitors.
Kelly formed a company and established the well-known brick works. The
company was hit hard in a financial crises "when several banks suspended pay-
ments," the price of bricks fell to 27/6 per thousand delivered to the Lytton
Fort. The company failed and Kelly purchased all the interests and he established
the business which he operated till his death. The business was later sold to
Shannons and was managed by David Kelly, who was born at Tingalpa in 1882,
and still resides there, a period of 77 years.
Another pioneer in Tingalpa was Emanuel Stanton, who arrived in Queens-
land with his parents in 1857 on the sailing ship "Schackermaxer" at five years
of age. He took up land in 1873 and established a dairy farm which has
survived the changes of the years and is still supplying fresh milk to the district.
The farm is now managed by his grandson and is one of the oldest dairy farms
in the district.
Mr. Stanton gave leng and meritorious service to the district in local
government affairs. He was a member of the Bulimba Divisional Board prior to
1888 and was a Councillor on both the Balmoral and the Belmont Shire Councils
simultaneosuly for a period. His services on the Balmoral Shire Council extended
for 22 years, during wnich period he was chairman on four occasions, 1895,
1900, 1909 and 1912-13. He was also one of the Local Authorities represen-
tatives on the Victoria Bridge Board for a quarter of a century. He was an
active member of the Tingalpa Church of England and served as a warden for
many years. The Stantons reared a family of sixteen, many of whom settled in
various parts of the district. Mr. Stanton died at the comparitively early age
of 62 and was interred in the Tingalpa Church cementery.
Mrs. J. Porter, one of the remaining family, has lived in the district for
75 years. She has vivid recollections of her early years when a large number of
aboriginies were camped on the flats nearby. Corrobories were frequently held
and on seme occasions lasted throughout the night with all the accompanying
noise, the only redress if too much disturbance was being created was the firing
of a few shots from a shotgun harmlessly in the air. Mrs. Porter relates that the

natives had a lot of respect for the "bang bangs" and festivities would quickly
quieten down.
On the banks of the creek nearby are still some of the relics of a one-time
sugar mill.
EXCERPTS FROM SPEECHES OF PIONEERS AT THE BULIMBA OLD TIMER'S
DINNER, HELD 10th OCTOBER, 1959
Mr. Frank Riding, Elliott Street, Hawthorne :
"My ancestor, Thorpe Riding, arrived in Queensland in 1849 on the
migrant ship "Lima." William Johnston was also a migrant on the same boat.
Thorpe Riding received a grant of land which extended from near the present
Bulimba Police Station to the bank of the river. He engaged in farming and
Riding Road was formed by him to enable his produce to be transported to town.
In 1861 he revisited England and returned in 1862, bringing with him a brother,
John Riding, James Nuttall and Dan Baldwin, all of whom settled in the Bulimba
district. Thorpe Riding was interred in the Bulimba Methodist Church ground.
There have been six generations of Ridings in Bulimba since 1849."
Mr. Harry Cross, Gordon Street, Hawthorne :
" My mother-in-law was one of the Pashen family ,' they claimed to be the
first white people born in Bulimba. Bulimba House, now the residence of Mr.
A. E. Moore, was erected for the McConnell family. It was built of stone
brought into the river as ballast in ships. Bulimba was either paddocks or
estates, Barton's paddocks, Jamieson estate, and so on ; part of the latter property
was occupied by a chinaman for the production of peanuts, from which we used
to help ourselves. The policeman Magee was a good old chap, he used to give
us a talking to and then let us go. Hawthorne House was burned down, despite
every effort to save it with a bucket brigade. A quarter of Hawthorne was
waterholes, no roads ; meat was delivered to homes in carts.
Mr. J. F. F. Reid, Bede Street, Balmoral :
"My parents lived at Hemmant and some of our family were born there.
The Queensland sugar industry had its foundations in this area. We used to
cross the river at the Hawthorne ferry ; after dark, a light away in the distance
from a house on Carlton Hill, where I lived, was used as a guiding light by the
ferryman and passengers. It was affectionately known as the "pile light." My
people came here in a ship of less than 800 tons. It has been most interesting
to me to note the progress of the district in the last 50 years.
Mr. G. H. Marriott, Grosvenor Street, Morningside :
"My first recollection of the district was as a boy one of my duties was to
post a weekly letter for the school marm at the Pialba school. The letter was
addressed to Mr. Pascoe, headteacher, State School, Belmont, via Morningside.
That intrigued me as a boy, mail was carried then by pack horse time has
rolled on.
"I worked in the sugar fields with the kanakas in 1902. In that year there
was a long drought and .we gathered the sugar cane in bags. The last time I cut
cane was on a plantation which was owned by one of the ladies present here
tonight.


"I have been living in my present home nearly fifty years, it was previously
a slaughter yard and was situated in the middle of a cattle paddock.
"The Balmoral tram line was so called at the request of the Balmoral Shire
Council. Alf Harrison was one of my greatest friends.
"During the war period many mothers found it necessary to go to work,
which created difficulties through having nowhere to place small children safely.
Mrs. McConnell established the day nursery and from then on it has developed
to a pre-school kindergarten."
Mr. T. Telford, Johnston Street, Bulimba :
I have lived in Bulimba for 65 years but I feel I am very young to be here
amongst old timers. Regarding old times, I remember coming out this way for
wallabies and hares and lobbying in the pools. Bulimba is one of the oldest of
Brisbane suburbs. My grandfather built in Bulimba, during the erection he had
to take all loose timber away at night, otherwise the natives would remove it.
The people made their own fun with concerts and dances and the Bulimba
School of Arts was the centre of social activities. We used to sell out as often
as three times weekly, that was before the days of the cinema. It has been a
pleasure to meet some of the old identies here tonight and to be reminded of
some of the pleasures of bygone years."
Parlimentary Representation ...
The first Member for the Electorate was the Hon. William Hemmant who
was the Colonial Treasurer in the McAllister Ministry. He was originally member
for Enoggera prior to the Electoral Districts Act of 1874. He contested and
won the Bulimba seat. He was one of the leading commercial men, being a
member of the merchant firm of Stewart & Hemmant. The Jubilee history of
Queensland records that Hemmant's commercial standing was a tower of strength
to the McAllister Ministry. In 1876 he resigned from Parliament and left the
State. He was succeeded by James Johnston, a "Bulimba Pioneer," who was
elected in July 1876. After a period of only four months his services terminated
through his sudden death.
Johnston was one of the very early settlers in Bulimba, arriving as a
migrant in 1849. Reference is made to him in the section of this journal
dedicated to the Pioneers of the District.
George Grimes filled the vacancy and occupied the seat for about two years
when he also died, necessitating a further by-election.
A remarkable feature of this period was that Bulimba was represented in the
seventh parliament by no less than four different individuals.
The ensuing by-election was won by James Robert Dickson, who is regarded
by historians as one of Queensland's most illustrious statesmen. He was a
member for Bulimba through seven Parliaments : a period of twenty-three years.
The full term of Parliament in those days was five years. Dickson served
Queensland well, holding the following portfolios : Colonial Treasurer, Public
Works, Postmaster General, Secretary for Railways, Home Secretary, Premier and
Chief Secretary. He was knighted for his outstanding services.


He was elected to the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901 and was
appointed the first Minister for Defence. Unfortunately his brilliant career ended
with his sudden death in Sydney ten days after his appointment.
Sir Robert lived in Toorak House, Hamilton, for many years.
The vacancy in Bulimba was filled in 1901 by Walter Henry Barnes, who
held the seat till 1923, excepting for one term, the twentieth Parliament being
defeated in 1915 by H. C. McMinn in the election in which the Denham
Government was defeated. Mr. Barnes regained the seat in the following
election in 1918. The Electoral District Act of 1922 brought about a redistribu-
tion of Electoral boundaries. The Bulimba Electorate was virtually reduced to
half its original area and a new Electorate "Wynnum" was created. Mr. Barnes
decided to contest Wynnum and held the seat until his death in February 1933.
Mr. Barnes, who had secured local Government experience as a Councillor
cn the Coorparoo Shire Council, early showed promise in the legislative sphere,
and his promotion to the Ministry as Secretary for Public Lands in 1907 was no
surprise. He retained Cabinet rank incessantly till 1915 as Minister for the
following departments: 1909, Education and Public Works; 1911-1915
Treasurer and Public Works; 1929-1932 Treasurer.
In addition to his Parliamentary duties, Mr. Barnes took an active interest
in Local Government affairs and was a Councillor of the Coorparoo Shire Council
for a period of thirty years, and was the Chairman on seven different periods.
A keen debater with a sound knowledge of Parliamentary procedure ~Walter
Henry," as he was affectionately known, was always worth and ever commanded
attention from political friend and foe alike.
An active churchman, he gave many years of service to the Methodist
Church as Sunday School teacher, lay preacher and administrator in the Warwick
and Brisbane districts.
Hugh C. McMinn entered Parliament in the 1915 election when the
Denham Government suffered a sweeping defeat, many Ministers being defeated.
McMinn proved to be an energetic candidate and strongly contested the election :
this fact, added to the anti-Denham swing, enabled him to win the seat against
such a strongly entrenched opponent. At the following election in 1918, with the
same opposing candidates, the figures favoured Mr. Barnes and he regained the
seat.
During his three years as member McMinn gave excellent service to the
Electorate and his defeat after only one term in a close contest could be fairly
attributed to a slight swing of the political pendulum.
The elections of 1923, two new candidates contested the new Bulimba seat.
They were D. J. R. Watson, "a leading Brisbane barrister," and A. H. Wright,
"a blacksmith." This election was most strongly contested, the retiring Labor
Government having only a small majority. The struggle in Bulimba was no
exception in so far as keenness was concerned. The Labor Government was
returned with an increased majority and this decisive swing enabled Wright to
win the seat by the comfortable margin of over 600.
Wright held the seat for six years, but was defeated in the anti-Labor
swing against the McCormack Government in the elections of 1929 by Mrs.
Irene Longman, who made political history in Queensland Politics being the first,
and up to the present time the only woman to be elected to the Queensland
Parliament.

Mrs. Longman had given great service to various women's organisations
and was a gracious and talented woman. She was particularly unfortunate in that
she attained a life ambition at a time of great stress, with unemployment and
hardship being suffered by many families in the electorate. As a matter of fact
the 1 929 election was mainiy lost and won on a State-wide plea "to change the
Government and give the boy a chance."
The general nationwide recession forced the Government to introduce many
unpoular features and the election of 1932 produced a complete reversal of
political opinion and defeat of the Moore regime. Mrs. Longman was amongst
the political casualties, being comfortably defeated by W. J. Copley.
William John Copley, a young public servant and active in the Public
Service Union. His outspoken criticism of some of the Government actions
aroused the feelings of some Cabinet Ministers who, it was claimed in Union
circles, retaliated by transferring Copley to a far distant country town. Very
naturally Copley strongly protested and claimed that he had been viciously
victimised. Be that as it may, the incident did much to advance Copley's cause
as a prospective Labor Candidate and he succeeded in winning a strongly
contested plebiscite for the selection of a Labor candidate for Bulimba. As
already mentioned, he secured a comfortable win and Queensland's only woman
member retired from the political arena. Copley represented Bulimba for six
years, 1932-38. He was defeated in the Labor plebiscite held prior to the 1938
election and consequently was not a candidate at that election.
He was succeeded by George Henry Marriott, a prominent industrial union
official as Secretary and Organiser of the Engine Drivers' and Firemen's Union.
Having won the preselection ballot, Marriott's return was assured as it became
apparent that Bulimba could be classed as a reasonably safe Labor seat, through
an increased working population. Marriott retained the seat till 1950 when he
was defeated in a three-cornered contest, he, having become divorced from the
official Labor Party, contested the election as an independent Labor candidate.
The official Labor Candidate, Robert James Gardner, won the seat in a
close contest by 42 votes from the Liberal Candidate, Hamilton.
Gardner, a foreman painter, held the seat until the election of 1957 in
another three-cornered contest. A number of votes in this election were
challenged and eventually became the subject of litigation, an appeal to the
elections tribunal. The appear was successful and the election was declared
null and void. At the consequential second election Gardner was again returned
with a majority considerably greater than in the original election.
In the dramatic collapse of the Gair Labor Government in 1957 due to the
refusal to accept the direction of the Queensland Central Executive of the A.L.P.
to legislate immediately for a three weeks' annual leave.
Gardner supported the Government stand and he also became divorced from
offical Labor.
The ensuing election resulted in the defeat of Labor and the return of a
non-Labor Ministry led by G. R. Nicklin.
Gardner contested the election as a Queensland Labor candidate and was
defeated by the official A.L.P. candidate John William Houston, who is the
present member, in a three-cornered contest.
Without doubt, the Bulimba Electorate has at all times figured prominently
jn the political activities throughout the period since the creation of the State.


Other prominent Parliamentarians who are or were residents of Bulimba
electorate are as follows.
Sir Robert Mackenzie who lived in "Bulimba House" for a number of years.
He was Treasurer in the first Ministry of Queensland in 1859, Colonial Secretary
in the second Ministry 1866, Premier of the fifth Ministry 1867. "The Jubilee
History of Queensland" records him as being a man of indedendent spirit, whose
interests were large and prosperous. He was a large owner of New Farm suburbs
and enjoyed a good share of the comforts of life. He represented a western
electorate. He died in Scotland whilst visiting a sick brother.
Hon. Peter Airey lived in Cleveland district. He was the Member for
Flinders and Brisbane South in the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and seven-
teenth Parliaments, during which period he filled ministerial positions as Secretary
for Mines, Public Works, Home Secretary and Treasurer, and was finally appointed
to the Legislative Council.
John Watson represented the Valley Electorate. He lived in Bulimba for
many years and enjoyed a varied career. A builder by profession he was
responsible for the erection of the Mercantile Wharf, also the Lytton Fort, still
monuments to his profession. He was of Scotch descent, having first seen the
light of day at Balmoral, Scotland. It is reliably reported that he gave the
district the name Balmoral.
Vernon Winstanley, also resident in Morningside for many years, repre-
sented Queenton in the State Parliament, 1908 to 1932. He was appointed
Government Whip in 1915 and held the position till 1929. An ardent temper-
ance advocate, was an executive member of the Queensland Temperance League
for many years. He gave much service to the Methodist Church as a lay preacher
in the Balmoral Circuit.
Hon. Joseph Silver Collings was resident in Hawthorne for many years. After
several decades of political prominence, he was elected to the Senate in the
Commonwealth Parliament. A fearless and vigorous debater, he was a well-
known figure throughout the Commonwealth. Smart and dapper in appearance
at all times, with a trimly cut "goatee," Joe commanded attention anywhere
anytime. Regardless of his political fervour, he was a great Australian. He
held ministerial positions in the Commonwealth Parliament as Vice-President of
the Executive Council and Minister for the Interior.
Hon. Henry Adam Bruce resided in Morningside for over thirty years,
represented Kennedy and Mulgrave in the State Parliament, was Secretary for
Public Works, also Public Instruction, transferred to the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment as Member for Leichhardt and held the seat till his death.
James Clark, resident in Galloways Hill, has represented Fitzroy in the
State Parliament since 1935 continuously.
Richard R. Bow represented the Mitchell electorate of Western Queensland
for several years, 1928-32, was a resident in Hawthorne for a number of years.
Thomas Nevitt, a member of the Legislative Council till its abolition was
visiting Magistrate to H.M. Prisons for a lengthy period and an ardent advocate
for prison reform.
Hon. Arthur Edward Moore, the present occupant of Bulimba House,
Member of Aubiney for twenty-six years, Leader of the Opposition for nine years.
He led his Party to victory in the sensational election in 1929 and became
Premier and Chief Secretary; at the following election in 1932 the Government


suffered the same fate as its predecessor, being soundly defeated, thus exempli-
fying the instability of many of the electors' political minds. A lifetime member
of the Church of England, he has served on the diocesan Council for many years.
Gerald Page-Hanify, resident of Norman Park, Member of the Legislative
Council, was a prominent temperance advocate and held the position of Grand
Chief Templar of the 1.0.G.T. of Queensland.
History of Local Government ...
It will be of interest to all to note that the first elections to be held ir.
Queensland were for the election of Aldermen to the Brisbane Municipality.
This election took place on the 13th October, 1859, and the first election for the
Queensland Parliament was held on April 27th, 1860, some six months later.
A New South Wales Government gazette issued on 7th September, 1859,
contained a proclamation which read as follows :
Under the authority of the Municipalities Act of New South Wales and in
accordance with a petition signed by 420 householders resident within the town
of Brisbane, Moretcn Bay, in the Colony of New South Wales (stating that the
number of the inhabitants of the said towns and suburbs was 5,000) His
Excellency Sir William Thomas Denison, with the advice of the Executive Council,
declared that "the district hereinafter described and named shall be a Municipality
within the meaning of the said Act."
It is universally recognised that one of the greatest bulwarks in the British
Constitution has been the system of free and responsible local Government.
The first Governor of Queensland, Sir G. F. Bowen, replying to the address
of welcome presented by the Municipality of Brisbane in 1859 said, "It has been
invariably held by the highest authorities that the system of local Government
by Municipalities has been one of the main elements of our national greatness."
He also further referred to the matter by reading a section of the report of
the Privy Council of Great Britain to Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, on the
political institutions granted the Australian Colonies in 1849, who made the
following comment, "We are of the opinion that the existence in Australia of
municipal bodies, in a state of efficiency, is not less necessary to the public
welfare than the existence there of representative legislatures. A large part of
the benefit to be derived from such legislatures seems to us to depend on the
simultaneous establishment and co-existence of incorporated municipalities. It
is the only practical security against the danger of undue centralisation."
The first Local Authority established in the electorate was known as the
Bulimba Divisional Board and was created in 1879. The initial area under its
control included the town of Wynnum and the Coorparoo district. The area
was divided into three new districts in 1888 and the Balmoral, Coorparoo and
Kianwanah (later Wynnum) districts were created. It was at this stage that the
word "Balmoral" came into existence. It has been claimed by some historians
that Balmoral was never so officially named. Be that as it may, however, it is
generally accepted by some of the present living early settlers that the name
was given by John Watson who had originally migrated from Balmoral, Scotland.
Under the Local Authorities Act of 1901 the Balmoral Divisional Board
became the Balmoral Shire Council with the area consisting of the suburbs of
Bulimba, Hawthorne, Norman Park, Morningside, Cannon Hill, Murarrie, Tingalpa

and Hemmant. The area under its control covered seventeen square miles
comprising a large area of residential land close to the city and a river frontage
extending from Norman Bridge to Gibson Island. The first chairman was

With the creation of the Greater Brisbane Council, ail existing councils within
the enlarged city area were dissolved. The personnel of the Balmoral Council at
the dissolution were Messrs. A. Harrison (Chairman), G. H. Marriott, J. Quinlan,
J. F. F. Reid (Division 1), P. Meggitt, A. Barker, J. H. Harper (Division 2), A. L.
Stanton, J. Yeo, A. E. Miller (Division 3).
The work and services rendered to the district by James Yeo (the doyen of
Hemmant) deserve special mention. As a result of hearing a glowing description
of conditions in Queensland given by Moses Ward (a former well-known Brisbane
Chemist) while visiting England, the Yeo family decided to "give it a go." They
arrived in Moreton Bay and finally took up land in Hemmant in 1881. He
quickly recognised the need for a Hemmant water supply and was successful in
locating an ample supply, which was made available in later years to the workers
who were engaged in building the Cleveland railway. Yeo served his district
on the Council for many years. He was of a humble and sincere nature and did
not aspire to the office of Chairman of the Shire, but was content to serve his
district in an efficient but unassuming manner. He acted as Sexton for the
Hemmant cemetery for many years. A daughter, Mrs. M. J. Kelk (now residing
in Cleveland) claims to be the oldest living scholar who attended the Hemmant
School.
Geo. H. Marriott, a resident of the district for nearly fifty years, served
on the Council from 1918 till its dissolution. It was largely due to his constant
advocacy and untiring efforts that the Council decided to create its own
Electricity undertaking. The proposal which was submitted by Mr. J. Hindman
was that bulk supplies of electricity should be purchased from the then City
Electric Light Coy. and distributed by the Council through its own equipment.
The proposal met at first with a lukewarm reception, but Marriott persevered
and was ultimately rewarded when the Council agreed to approach the Treasurer
of the day, Hon. E. G. Theodore, for a loan to initiate the scheme. The applica-
tion was successful and resulted in other local councils becoming interested. The
Hamilton Town Council moved quickly and it became a race to see which council
would have the first pole erected. George recalls with pride, "Balmoral won the
race." The undertaking began as the Balmoral Electricity Board, however the
adjoining Coorparoo Council became quickly interested and also became associated
and the venture became the Balmoral and Coorparoo Joint Electricity Supply
Board. The Stephens Shire later joined the scheme and eventually expansion to
more metropolitan areas created the necessity for a central authority and a new
Board, the Metropolitan Electricity Board was created, the honour of the position
of its first Chairman was given to the Chairman of the Balmoral Shire, Councillor
A. Harrison, a tribute to the energies of that body in the creation of the organisa-
tion which has now grown into a very large undertaking and is administered by
the Brisbane City Council.


Mr. J. Hindman, who was the initiator and adviser from the start, was
appointed Manager, a position he held throughout until his retirement through
age from the Brisbane City Council. Without doubt, his foresight and unfailing
energy was mainly responsible for the establishment of one of the most successful
municipal enterprises the State has known.
In addition to the general problems facing fast developing suburban areas,
the Balmoral Shire, with its long river frontage, had the additional task of
maintaining an efficient ferry service. The immediate period following the end
of the first World War witnessed great activity in home building with a
consequential rapid increase in population, many of whom were city workers who
required quick transport to and from their employment. A vehicular ferry to
provide for industrial and commercial purposes was, at ever-increasing cost,
maintained, and although at times the balance between costs and revenue
assumed a considerable amount and had to be met from other funds, it can be
stated to the credit of all the Councillors through all the years, the ferries were
treated as highways and must be kept open at all costs. As a matter of fact, it is
worthy of mention that during the 1921-24 period a free ferry service was
instituted and continued in operation until the Greater Brisbane Council came
into being. It was during this period that the Council were forced into an
interesting situation which should go on record in an historical review.
The powers that were, informed the Council that the vehicular ferry boat
was condemned and must be taken off the service within a stated time. Con-
sideration was quickly given the purchase of a new boat, the estimated cost,
however, was of such an astronomical nature as to be quite beyond the financial
capacity of the Council. Acting on the advice of Colonel Evans, a principal of the
well-known firm Evans Deakin, the Council purchased the ferry boat "Hethering-
ton" from the Brisbane City Council. The "Hetherington" had been withdrawn
from the Kangaroo Point to Eagle Street vehicular ferry service which was closed
for, it was stated, heavy losses incurred. Colonel Evans advised that the
Hetheringtcn be split lengthways and widened, which would have the effect of
considerably lessening the draft and cheapening the cost of running, and yet
increasing almost double the carrying capacity, the vessel to be cable controlled.
The contract for the alteration was entered into and work was well on the way,
when the Marine Authorities delivered another bombshell. "The Council were given
six months' notice to remove the ferry cable from the river as it was proposed to
provide a swing basin for overseas ships in that vicinity." The Council had no
option but to arrange the necessary alterations to provide for a self-controlled
vessel.
Speculation was rife throughout the district and the Council was subjected
to much hostile criticism. To control a ferry boat of that size in a strong tidal
river was considered by some so-called experts as impossible. It was an anxious
day for the Council when, with all Councillors on board, the boat left the slip
for a trial run in the gardens reach of the river. To the joy of all concerned
and particularly the Councillors, the boat behaved excellently and was put into
service and, but for the introduction of the Greater Brisbane Council, would have
possibly been still serving the district. The total cost was approximately one-fifth
of the estimated cost of a new vessel. The building of the Story Bridge ( during
a depression to help ease the unemployment problem") to some extent minimised
the distance for vehicular traffic and it may not be too much of a dream to predict
that the historian of the second century will be able to report that the under-
ground tunnel from Bulimba to Newstead has proved to be of immense value in
reducing traffic congestion and creating an arterial highway of great importance.


Like all other Councils which possessed large areas of suburban land being
rapidly opened up for home sites, Balmoral had its problems. It was not the
fashion in those days for the local authority to demand that streets be formed
complete with concrete gutters and bitumen surfaces before the estate was put
on the market with, of course, the cost of the improvements added to the
purchase price of the land. To comply with the great demand for roads, the
Concil searched for a more suitable stone than the type of soft porphyry used
which quickly powdered into dust. The search was successful , an excellent
stone was located within a short distance from the Council Chamber at Morning-
side and became known at the Richmond Road Quarry. A stone crushing plant
was installed and proved to be an outstanding success; in addition to meeting
Balmoral's need, thousands of yards of screened metal was sold to outside districts.
The quarry' suffered a sudden and unexpected end as a supplier of stone : an
unlimited underground water supply was tapped and in a short time the quarry
became flooded with water with a depth of up to 30 feet. Several years ago, an
Olympic type diving tower was erected and the Australian Diving Championship
events were staged there.
The quarry was used as the local swimming baths and attracted considerable
numbers of picnickers throughout the summer week-ends. A double drowning
tragedy caused the City Council to prohibit swimming and the area was fenced
in. The quarry served an excellent purpose for the training of volunteer firemen
in the use of mobile water pumps to be used in possible air raid fires during
the second World War.
An unusual incident occurred in connection with the road from Wynnum
Road to the quarry before the road was formed. As a result of a petition from
a number of residents who had built homes (some under the Workers Dwellings
Act) to the Council that the road be formed, Councillors inspected the site an
after investigations, found that there was no road and that the dwellings had
been allowed to be erected with a frontage to private land. A scrutiny of the
lithographs of the original estate showed that the actual street was a chain of
water holes at the rear of their property. The Council accepted the responsibility
for the situation and purchased a strip of land necessary so that the road now
known as Lang Street could be provided. The purchase proved to be very
profitable as the road became the main outlet from the quarry.
An amusing but true story is worth recording, as it indicates what was the
general condition of at least some of the main thoroughfares. One of he
Councillors, on his way from the city to attend a Council meeting, .®" lved .
then tram terminus at the Norman Bridge. Pushed for time, he haded the dnver
of the first vehicle to approach, which was a T Model flat top truck fined with
solid rubber tyres. The road was in a very rough condition and full of pot ho
as the vehicle lurched and bumped along with the passenger hanging grim y on
the driver said to him, "You know, mate, I'd like to get one of the - Balmoral
Councillors on this road with me. I'd shake h.s liver up. His passenge
a nod of the head, silently agreed, reflecting how possible it was peop e s.
wishes to be granted, though not realised by them. The episode had a satisfactory
result as the Minutes of the Council meeting included the item : On the motion
by Counci,lor it was unanimously agreed that the engineer be instructed
to carry out repairs to the main road from Norman Bridge to the top of Galloways
Hill "such work to be treated as urgent," and so it was.
' One of the most praiseworthy actions of the Balmoral Council was the
proven made for parks and sporting reserves. In the early penod of Its

existence, consideration was given to the future requirements of the district, the
result being the acquiring of suitable areas for part and recreation purposes.
The areas comprise Bulimba Memorial Park, ten (10) acres (dedicated to the
memory of the soldiers and sailors of the Shire who enlisted), Hawthorne Park,
seventeen (17) acres, Balmoral Park, Morningside, thrity-three (33) acres, Cannon
Hill recreation reserve, ten (10) acres, Murarrie recreation reserve, fifty-four (54)
acres, Hemmant recreation reserve, ten (10) acres, Kianawah Park, Tingalpa. In
addition there are a number of small areas dedicated to recreation purposes.
The Council met with some criticism at the time of the acquisition of some
of the parks, particularly Hawthorne, which was claimed by some shortsighted
people as a waste of ratepayers' money, however, the passage of time has proved
that this particular park has been and will continue to be of tremendous
advantage. In addition to providing accommodation for a number of other
sports, a first-class velodrome has been erected and has been the venue for
Australian .Cycling Championships.
The Balmoral Park, Morningside, has gained much in popularity in recent
years. It is situated on a hill from the apex of which is obtained an excellent
view of hte city. An honour avenue passes through the park, connecting the
Wynnum and Bennetts Roads. Main improvements in the park have been the
erection of a bowl house and greens and erection of several buildings for the
use of Girl Guides' and Boy Scouts' organisations.
It is worth recording that a proposal by the Greater Brisbane Council to
make available a portion of the park, including the apex, to a company as a site
"for the erection of what would have been the first Crematorium in Brisbane,
was vigorously and successfully opposed by the residents of the Morningside
district. An irate populace rightly argued that the park was held in trust by the
Council as a "recreation reserve," the alienation of any part of it for commercial
enterprise was wrong and the purpose for which it was to be used could not by any
stretch of the imagination be classed as recreation.
The Bulimba Memorial Park is also well patronised by all classes of sport
and is perhaps best known as the headquarters of the long-existing Bulimba
Ranger Soccer Club and the first grade Balmoral Cricket Club. A stand capable
of seating 250 persons has been erected, giving additional pleasure to the sporting
public. Ideally and conveniently situated, with the frontage to Oxford Street
well shaded with trees, Bulimba can be proud of its memorial to its fallen
heroes of two World Wars.
The Cannon Hill recreation reserve is at the present time receiving active
attention from the various local bodies and the City Council and it is confident y
anticipated that a first class sports oval will become an established fact in the
not too distant future.
The Murarrie recreation reserve of over 50 acres is awaiting development.
The area extends from the Wynnum Road to the railway and will provide ample
scope for the future recreation requirements of that district. Doubtless, this area
will eventually receive the attention of the City Council with its reclamation
scheme which has been so successful in many closer city areas in recent years.
The Hemmant district was not forgotten and a recreation reserve was
provided and is serving a useful purpose in providing playing spaces for the
various sporting associations active in this district.
Kianawah Park at Tingalpa, situated with a frontage to Wynnum Road has
been developed as an all-round-the-year cricket ground. Twelve wickets have


been provided and are fully occupied throughout the normal cricket season and
a considerable number are used for winter cricket fixtures.
Hardcastle Park is a small area situated on the bank of the Brisbane River
near the Hawthorne ferry. It was dedicated to the memory of W. G. Hardcastle,
a prominent resident in Hawthorne for many years.
The following gentlemen have served the Bulimba district on the Brisbane
City Council since the establishment of the Greater Brisbane Area :
1 925-28—Alfred Harrison
1928-31—John Innes Brown
1931-37—William McAuliffe
1937-40—Michael Kelly
1940- —Thomas Holmes
Reference to the outstanding qualities of Mr. Harrison will be found else-
where in this book. His successor, John Innes Brown, was a well-known personality
particularly in the Stones Corner and Coorparoo district. A blacksmith by
profession, strong in muscle and character, his work in the sphere of amateur
athletics was known throughout Australia and beyond; he acted as the official,
starter at the Amateur Athletic Championships for many years. He possessed a
passion for straw boater hats and wet or fine and through all seasons his straw
hat was his head cover. To "John" the boater was just as important as the
cigar and "umbrella" to two other prominent personalities. He successfully
contested the Logan Ward in 1931 and afterwards entered the State Parliament as
Member for Coorparoo.
William McAuliffe was also prominent in amateur sport, being keenly
interested in boxing. He was mainly responsible for the creation of sporting
clubs for boys at the "Victoria Park temporary housing settlement." He was
President of the Queensland Amateur Boxing and Wrestling Uunion, and was
appointed Manager of the Australian Olympic boxing team at the 1956 Olympic
Games in Melbourne ; it was whilst carrying out these duties that he suffered a
sudden fatal collapse. He will be gratefully remembered by many lovers of the
fistic art for his helpful contributions over a lengthy period to that sport.
Michael Kelly, resident of Hawthorne for nearly 'fifty years, arrived in
Queensland from Ireland in 1907. After working on the land for several years,
he entered the carrying business as a one-man carrier. He was an active member
of the Hawthorne progress association for many years.
Thomas Holmes, sitting Alderman since 1940, originally a migrant from
England, became associated with the meat industry and active in industrial affairs.
He was Chairman of the Health Committee in the Labor controlled Council
1952-55.

"THE COURAGE OF HONESTY"
"I'm not surprised that many people feel lost and unable to decide what to
hold on to and what to discard, how to take advantage of the new life without
losing the bjest of the old.
"But it is not the new inventions which are the difficulty.
"The trouble is caused by unthinking people who carelessly throw away
ageless ideals as if they were old and outworn machinery.
"They would have religion thrown aside, morality in personal and public
life made meaningless, honesty counted as foolishness and self-interest set up
in place of self-restraint.
"At this critical moment in our history we will certainly lose the trust and
respect of the world if we just abandon those fundamental principles which
guided the men and women who built the greatness of this country and
Commonwealth.
"To-day we need a special kind of courage, not the kind needed in battle,
but a kind which makes us stand up for everything that we know is right,
everything that is true and honest. We need the kind of courage that can with-
stand the subtle corruption of the cynics so that we can show the world that
we're not afraid of the future.
"It has always been easy to hate and destroy.
"To build and to cherish is much more difficult."
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
CHURCH OF ENGLAND
ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST BULIMBA PARISH
The initial action to establish the Church was taken early in 1887, when
there appeared in a prominent place at the Bulimba Ferry a notice with the
signature of Mrs. Coxen inviting Church of England adherents to a meeting to
consider the advisability of asking for regular Church services. At that time
Bulimba was part of St. Andrews parish, South Brisbane.
As a result a Curate, the Rev. H. M. Bannister, established what was known
as "The Bulimba Mission." Services and Sunday School were first held in the
School of Arts, and Mrs. Coxen donated a site for a Church in Church Street.
This was later sold and the present site in Oxford Street, which was more suitable,
was secured. A building subscription list was opened and headed by Mrs. Coxen
with a donation of £lOO.
The first stump of the Church was capped by Lady Musgrave, "wife of the
then Governor of Queensland," on 23rd June, 1888. The first member of the
congregation to cap a stump was Mr. J. Pashen, senior. The first services were
held on the 29th September in the same year.


Due to the absence abroad of the Archbishop of Brisbane, the dedication
service did not eventuate till June 2nd, 1889, the service register records state :
"The Church was this day consecrated to the service of Almighty God,
and dedicated to the name of St. John the Baptist, by the Right Rev.
William Thornhill Webber, Lord Bishop of Brisbane.
"The petition was read by Edward Griffith, Esq., then 'Chairman of
the Balmoral Shire'."
The Sunday School was erected in 1895 during the Rectorship of the Rev.
T. H. Molesworth. Mr. Sam Woodland was the Sunday School Superintendent,
and it was largely due to their unstinting efforts that a successful organisation
was established. Their names are lovingly remembered by many who are still
residents of Hawthorne and Bulimba, and who were Sunday School scholars at
that time.
From 1900 to 1914 the Bulimba Mission was under the direction of the
Cathedral and during that time Catechists were in charge. Mr. T. H. Fallows
carried out these duties from 1907-1914 and it was due to his outstanding
work and organisation that made the creation of a parochial district, to include
Morningside and Cannon Hill, possible.
The first Vicar appointed was Rev. A. H. Barlee, and by 1920 the district
was enlarged to include Norman Park and Tingalpa. The district was then
declared a parish under the name Balmoral Parish with the Rev. J. H. Steer in
charge. Under his leadership excellent progress was made, and two new
churches were erected. The Church of the Transfiguration at Norman Park,
and the Church of the Ascension at Morningside. In 1930 the Bulimba area
of the parish, with the approval of the church authorities, became a parish on its
own, retaining the name Bulimba.
It is interesting to note that during the Rectorship of the Rev. W. Wyndham-
Earee, he crossed the river at Hamilton, and commenced regular services there,
and it was from these services that the first St. Augustine's Church was built,
and at the dedication services the Bulimba Choir led the singing.
The Golden Jubilee celebrations were conducted in 1938 under the leadership
of the Rev. T. Tomlinson. The exterior and interior of the church was painted,
and a beautiful reredos and panelling were installed in the Sanctuary. The
reredos was dedicated to the memory of Louisa Ellen Fellows by Bishop Dixon,
and Archbishop Wand consecrated the panelling to the memory of twenty-five
old parishioners.
The parishioners on the list at the Golden Jubilee, who were present at the
dedication services in 1889, included:—
Mrs. Johnson, Senr., Treasurer (Women's Giuld).
Mr. P. Pashen, member (Parochial Council) warden, and member of the
choir 44 years.
Mr. Parry, foreman at the building of the church.
Mr. Icke, member (Parochial Council), built the Parish Hall and Bell Tower.
Mr. L. Blunt, choir member 42 years.
Messrs. A. & H. Manley.
Mr. J. Pashen.
Mr. & Mrs. Edwards.
Mr. & Mrs. Fletcher.
Mr. Geo. Porter.


Mesdames E. Glover, R. Leonard, Stoodley, Carr, Jefferies, Green, L. L.
Blunt, and Miss A. Thorpe.
Messsr. E. H. Johnston and F. C. Glover are remembered for their sterling
work for many years as Hon. Organist and People's Warden respectively.
The present Rector, Rev. L. R. Crossman, has been in charge since 1955,
and he is optimistic that the future is full of great promise for the church in this
district.
NORMAN PARK
THE CHURCH OF THE TRANSFIGURATION
This church, beautifully situated with commanding views in all directions
and yet with easy approach, speaks volumes for the foresight of the pioneer
church members in the selection of the site, which was acquired in 1921.
Norman Park at that time being attached as a parochial district to the Bulimba
Parish. The Rev. R. O. S. Free was appointed to assist an active organisation
for the erection of a church. The foundation stone was laid by Archbishop
Sharp in July 1924, and the new church was officially opened and dedicated by
the Archbishop in the following year, under the rectorship of Rev. J. J. Steer,
with Messrs. Waller and Knight as wardens.
An opportunity to secure additional adjoining land was accepted in 1926,
thus giving the necessary space for a generally improved lay out of the ground.
The new Parish of Balmoral, including Morningside and Cannon Hill, founded
under the rectorship of the Rev. A. T. Craswell with Mr. W. E. Waller as lay
preacher for the parish, was created in 1930. Nine years later, the parish was
formed into a separate parochial district and in 1950 Norman Park became a
parish in its own right, with the Rev. G. L. Peters as Rector, and Messrs. Vicker-
man and P. Prout as Wardens.
The present Rector, the Rev. S. L. L. 'Estrange, was inducted in 1957.
TINGALPA
CHRIST CHURCH
Christ Church, Tingalpa, situated on the main Wynnum Road near Bulimba
Creek, was erected in 1868 and opened by Dr. Tufnell, Bishop of Brisbane, on
the 28th October in the same year. He was assisted by the Revs. J. R. Moffatt,
T. Jones and J. Matthews.
The large gathering of parishioners and visitors included the Governor of
Queensland, Colonel Blackail, and the Mayor and Mayoress of Brisbane, Alderman
and Mrs. J. Hardgrave.
At the conclusion of the dedication service the cemetery adjoining was
consecrated.
An energetic church committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Charles
Coxen, ensured the success of the venture, which was also greatly sided by the
work of two ladies, who had collected between them £l2O for the building fund.
It is of particular interest to note that the church was built of hardwood,
and was of the following dimensions : 40 feet by 22 feet, with a spire 47 feet
high.
The total cost of the building, seating and fittings, was £192, made up as
follows : Main building £l6O, Chancel fittings £l2, 20 seats £2O.


The church was blown down in a cyclonic blow in 1885 and was re-built
with the salvaged timber.
Early church wardens included Edward Robinson and Emanuel Stanton,
descendants of these families are still associated with the church, which is now
under the rectorship of the Rev. F. J. D. Wilson of the Manly parish.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
STS. PETER AND PAUL CHURCH
The story of Sts. Peter and Paul's Parish, Bulimba, is bound up intimately
with the lives of those men and women priests, brothers, nuns and laiety
who, under God's guidance and motivated by a spirit of self-sacrifice, laboured
to erect in our midst a lasting edifice to the glory of God.
On a Sunday afternoon early in 1896, a meeting of Catholics was held at
the residence of Mrs. Keogh, Main Street, Bulimba, to consider the question of
the erection of a church in the area. His Grace Archbishop Dunne presided at
the meeting, and it was decided to begin the work of collecting funds. The
Hon. A. J. Thynne, M.L.C., offered the site for the building free.
The foundation stone of the new church was laid on July sth, 1896, by
His Grace Archbishop Dunne. Before the year was out the building was com-
pleted, and His Grace, when performing the opening ceremony on December 6th,
1896, was able to congratulate the Catholics of Bulimba on the completion of
the church and its freedom from debt. This first church is now the parish hall
on the corner of Riding Road and Main Avenue. The architect was Mr. Caldwell,
and the actual work of erection was done by Mr. J. Parry.
For nearly twenty years the people had to be satisfied with a weekly visit
from a priest, and one Mass on a Sunday. Fr. J. O'Leary, of St. James' Church,
Coorparoo, was pastor of the church from 1901 to 1904, then Mr. Canali
administered it until 1915. The year 1915 is one of the important milestones of
the parish, for in that year His Grace Archbishop Duhig, who was then coadjutor
Archbishop to Archbishop Dunne, decided that the time had arrived when
Bulimoa should become a parish in its own right. The Archbishop successfully
negotiated for the purchase of several acres of land on the slope of the hill at
the rear of the church, and Mr. T. R. Hall, as architect, was entrusted with the
task of drawing up plans for a parochial school.
That same year, 1915, saw another giant step forward when the Rev. Fr.
Arthur 0 Keefe, then of Ipswich but now chaplain of Nudgee Junior, was appointed
the first permanent parish priest. He entered enthusiastically into the task of
providing a convent school for the children of his new parish. Meanwhile he
resided at St. Joseph's Presbytery, Kangaroo Point. As a result of his labours
and the enthusiasm and generosity of his parishioners of those days, Fr. O'Keefe
was able to have the school completed under Mr. F. J. Corbett as the contractor.
To His Grace fell the dual pleasure of dedicating the new school and welcoming
the Sisters of the Good Samaritan to take up work in it on Sunday, February 6th,
1916. Since its opening day the convent school has progressed beyond all
expectations.
Having attended to the urgent wants of the children Fr. O'Keefe set about
the erection of a presbytery for himself. Once again the task of preparing plans
fell to Mr. T. R. Hall, and the work of erection was undertaken by Mr. Edward
Duhig as contractor. The presbytery was blessed and opened in the presence of
a large gathering on Sunday, September 2nd, 1917.


Fr. O'Keefe continued his labours as parish priest until 1928 when Rev.
Fr. Stanaway took his place. Before leaving the parish however, Fr. O'Keefe
had the joy and consolation of witnessing the opening in 1926 of our present
beautiful church.
Fr. Stanaway remained as parish priest until 1935 when he was succeeded
by Fr. J. O Brien. Our present parish priest, Fr. J. Concannon, assumed the
responsibilities of this parish in 1952.
Final milestones in this brief review of our past are the year 1916, when
Lourdes Hill Convent was opened on its present site, 1918 when the beautiful
assembly hall was added, and in 1956 when the final additions were opened.
A parish can only be an outstanding success when priests and laiety combine
to further God s work. By doing just this in days gone by our predecssors have
made the landmark of our faith in this parish of Sts. Peter and Paul's shine with
a lasting lustre.
THE METHODIST CHURCH BALMORAL CIRCUIT
Minister : Rev. B. H. Blake, 8.A., L.Th.
BULIMBA
The earliest record of church services at Bulimba is recorded in valume
written by Mrs. D. McConnell, entitled "Bygone Days." The first church services
were held under a large tree, and most of the worshippers were the families of
McConnell s employees. An early settler, Thorpe Riding, quickly recognised the
need for a permanent place for worship, and donated an area of land on which
the first Primitive Methodist Church was erected in 1856.
The decision by both the Primitive and Wesleyan Methodists to become a
united church was reached in 1897, and as from the first of January, 1898, the
words Primitive and Wesleyan were dropped and the name of the united church
became the "Methodist Church of Australia."
Many well-known Bulimba families were represented in the list of early
members, and most of them have descendants still residents and members of the
church.
The list included : Mr. & Mrs. Thorpe Riding, Mr. & Mrs. J. Nuttall, Mr.
& Mrs. Baldwin, Mr. & Mrs. Crouch, Mr. & Mrs. W. Lindsay, Mr. & Mrs. J.
McLeod, Mr. & Mrs. T. Enever, Mr. & Mrs. Tom Riding, Mr. & Mrs. J. Uhlmann,
Mr. & Mrs. Hurley, Mr. & Mrs. W. Tyler, Mr. & Mrs. Bullock, Mr. & Mrs. Houston,
Mr. & Mrs. Dodds.
In 1926, to provide extra accommodation needed, a two story hall was
erected on the front portion of the site, and a section of the hall is available to
give extra seating accommodation for church services as required.
Several families have rendered outstanding service in the various sections
of the church for many years. The present choirmaster, Mr. F. Bullock, has
been an active member for over 60 years ; as Sunday School superintendent for
years, and has acted as choirmaster since 1943, succeeding to the position, on
the death of Mr. C. Tyler, who was choirmaster for 20 years.
The Riding and Uhlmann families have been continuously represented in the
office-bearers.
MORNINGSIDE
Methodist services were first held at Morningside at the residence of Mr.
and Mrj. Allison, and were conducted by lay preachers from the Wesley Circuit


(East Brisbane). These services by lay preachers quickly became popular, and the
need for a church was soon expressed. Land in Thynne Road was purchased in
1900, and the church was erected and opened for worship in 1902. The records
of the first members include the following : Charles and Jane Crowther, Joseph
and Sarah Briscam, Alexander and Agnes Munyard, Ezra and Eliza Firth, Thomas
and Maria Cocks, Fred and Elizabeth Allison, Charles and Lillian Stanton, Misses
Nellie Munyard, Emily Crust, Mary Kite, Ada and Mary Wooton.
The first Sunday School Superintendent was Mr. J. Lang, and he was
followed by Mr. Tom Kelly, whose services in that capacity extended for a period
of ever 40 years. In 1920, to meet the need for additional seating accommo-
dation and as a memorial to the men of the church who made the supreme
sacrifice in the first World War, a transept was added to the church, and in
addition a brick Hall was erected for use as a Sunday School, and the various
youth activities. During this period of building progress great assistance was
given by Mr. R. G. White who, for a period of 20 years prior to his demise, was
the Secretary and Treasurer of the Trustees. His organising ability and control
of the finances made it possible for all outstanding liabilities to be liquidated.
A handsome donation cf a pipe organ was donated by his wife and daughter in
his memory.
Within recent years the church has been completely refurnished, a feature
of which being that practically the whole of the cost of the new furnishings was
covered by relatives of former worshippers in memory of them. Members of
earlier years, in addition to those previously mentioned, who descendants retain an
active membership include : Mr. V. Winstanley, M.L.A. for Queenton, an ardent
temperance and advocate and lay preacher for many years ; Mr. S. D. Fletcher,
a former organist and choirmaster ; Mr. E. Walker, a trustee for many years : his
son Leslie is the organist and choirmaster at the present time ; The Dalzell family :
Mrs. Dalzell, Senr., still active as Honorary Secretary of the Ladies' Guild, son
Donald the present Superintendent of the Sunday School. Other families whose
membership extends for over 40 years include : James, Coates, Ison, Maskelyne,
Hitchins, C. Smith, W. Smith, Wright, Hoskins, E. Cooper, L. Ross and McGowan.
Recent years have witnessed much increased activity with notable progress
in the children and youth organisations, in addition to the usual Sunday School
work. A child minding centre operates two days weekly. A young girls' choir
for ages Bto 14 is now (under the tutorship of Mrs. P. Smith) well established.
For the teenager a youth mixed choir gives promise to become a valuable
permanent institution.
TINGALPA
The Queensland Gazetteer records that there were originally three churches
at Tingalpa. A Church of England, a Primitive Methodist, and a Wesleyan
Methodist. It is clear however that the two latter groups became united, and
the present church was erected in 1877, the opening services being held in July
of that year. The building committee comprised the Hon. Angus Gibson, M.L.C.,
Messrs. L. Hamilton, J. Cope, E. Daw, B. Waugh, R. Fleming, J. Porter, and J.
Morris, under the chairmanship of Rev. W. Wilson. Mr. E. Daw held the trustee
treasurership for over 40 years.
Prominent in the life and work of the church's activities in the intervening
period has been the Alcorn Family. The increase in residential properties, and
bigger congregations, necessitated greater accommodation during recent years.


This challenge has been cheerfully met, and the church has been enlarged and
remodelled. Youth activities are being vigorously encouraged, and this section
of the organisation gives great promise.
CANNON HILL
Methodist services first commenced in the Cannon Hill district in 1928 ; they
were held in the School of Arts and were conducted by Rev. J. H. Heaton, then
in charge of the Balmoral circuit.
The depression years, 1929-32 severely affected the district, causing much
unemployment and hardship, and in consequence services were maintained only
with difficulty.
In 1933 Mr. Heaton was transferred to Wooloowin, and after consultation
with his successor, Rev. W. Kleindienst, it was decided that the services be
discontinued.
In July 1949 services were re-commenced again, conducted by Mr. Heaton
who, in the meantime, had retired from the active ministry and had become a
supernumery minister and a permanent resident in the district.
A Sunday School was established with Mr. Heaton as Superintendent and
made such progress that it was decided to plan for a church building. A suitable
site was purchased and a small church was erected and was officially opened
by Rev. A. C. Tempest, President of the Methodist Church, in May 1953.
Much development has occurred in recent years and the marked increase in
the number of Sunday School children necessitated greater building accommodation.
An adjoining building measuring 50 feet by 30 feet has been purchased and is
now occupied by the Sunday School.
The tenth anniversary services held recently were a particularly gratifying
success, when nearly 100 scholars and teachers entertained record congregations.
Cannon Hill has made much progress in recent years and there is no doubt
that under the continued consistent work and care of the Rev. J. H. Heaton and
his group of helpers the Methodist cause in this area will grow and prosper.
HEMMANT
The first religious services occurred in 1865 when a group of Wesleyan
pioneers led by E. Keik founded a Sunday School under a tree, and by November
1866 a church was erected and opened for service.
The Gibson family were identified with the church from its inception. The
Hon. Angus Gibson being a local preacher and trustee for 50 years.
The church became known as the Methodist Church and the Rev. Doran
was the first ordained resident Minister.
The church is the second oldest in the distict and celebrates its 93rd
anniversary this year. Considerable furnishing improvements were installed in
1947 when folding doors, pulpit, organ and memorial windows were dedicated
by the Rev. J. Prowse.
The Sunday School, under the guidance of Mr. and Mrs. C. Lilley, with
an enrolment of 60, is making marked progress.
Mr. H. W. Prebble is the organist, a position he has held for nearly 40
years.


The church is incorporated in the Wynnum Circuit under the Ministerial
leadership of the Rev. Ralph Heaton since 1953. A branch of the Blue Nur§jng
Service, attached to the Circuit, operates through the Hemmant and Murarrie
District.
The Circuit has also instituted an aged persons settlement at Pleasantville,
and the erection of a number of cottages are in hand and, it is anticipated, will
be completed and ready for occupation before the end of this year.
THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
BULIMBA
The Presbyterian cause in Bulimba was fostered by the St. Andrews Church,
Brisbane, for a number of years. The number of members progressively increased,
and the desire to have a place of worship was soon accomplished by the erection
of the church in 1881.
Bulimba was elected to full status as a Charge in 1886, with the appoint-
ment of the Rev. Stewart Byron as Minister. Thirty-five members participated
in his first communion service.
An interim session guided the congregation until 1893, when the following
were elected to the Eldership, and formed the first Bulimba Session : Messrs.
John Thomsen, A. Thomson, J. Lapraik, W. M. Gillieary and J. Sykes.
The Wynnum district was about this time added to the charge, and the
combination continued until 1908 when a new charge, Wynnum and Manly, was
created. Following this separation, Bulimba became a Home Mission charge
until 1913. A union with the Cannon Hill charge took effect in 1936 to 1946.
An extensive building programme was initiated in 1920 to meet the
requirements of the Sunday School. A small hall was erected and 1923 saw the
completion and occupation of the Manse.
With the increasing population in the district, marked progress was made,
and it was found necessary to increase the accommodation for the various
activities in the youth movement attached to the church, and a new and larger
hall was added to the property in 1934.
The Cause has continued to grow, and the record attendance of 105
members participated in the Communion Service conducted by the present
Minister Rev. T. R. Hall in June this year.
The present Session comprises seven members ; they include : Messrs. R.
A. Day, T. B. Telford, F. A. Thomas, F. L. Buckley, S. Renshaw ; Session Clerks,
R. S. May and F. A. Buckley.
Ministers who have served in the Bulimba Church include : Revs. Stewart
Byron, 1886-88; Pames McQueen, 1892-1900; J. L. King, 1900-04; Allan
McD. McKillop, 1904-08; S. M. Mitchell, 1908-10; J. Sinclair, 1912-14 ;
William Meikle, 1914-17; John Vance, 1918-23; D. A. Brown, 1923-27; W.
C. R. Moore, 1927-31 ; M. McDermant, 1936-46; M. Janson, K. Innes, A. E.
Dempster, and the present Minister, T. R. Hall.
HAWTHORNE
Originally part of the Norman Park charge, the Hawthorne Church was
established in 1910, when a small church hall was opened in a site by the
Trustees of the late William Gibson estate. In 1924 Hawthorne became a


separate charge, with its own Home Missionary, and additional ground adjoining
the church was purchased as a site for the erection of a new church.
To meet the increasing urgent demands for additional accommodation the
original building was subsequently extended in 1926 and 1929. Hawthorne
had at this stage become a separate sanctioned charge with the right to call its
own minister. The first ordained minister was Rev. S. M. Mitchell and during
his ministry the cause was extended to Cannon Hill.
During the depression years of the 1930'5, and in spite of serious financial
stress, there always remained a nucleus to carry on God's work.
The most recent building addition was the purchase of a spacious manse,
which occupies a commanding position.
The growth of the church over the years is evidenced by the strength of its
various organisations. Sunday School activities have always been a feature, and
the enrolment now exceeds 200 scholars with a full strength of zealous teachers.
The Women's Guild has always been untiring in its work, with some of
the original members still active, and the Fellowship Association, the Church
Youth body,'' is to-day at its greatest strength since inception.
The Choir, Men's Club, and the Parents' and Friends' Association all play
an important role in their respective fields.
A survey of the past indicates steady progress over the years, and the
church, with its various organisations whose members are alive to what is
required of them, seems assured of progressive development in the coming years.
The present Minister, Rev. P. W. Gillies, was inducted in 1957, and is the
church's fourth ordained Minister.
NORMAN PARK
The cause began in August 1900 as a branch Sunday School of the
Mowbraytown Church and was conducted in a room at the Norman Park State
School until 1907. In April of that year a stump capping ceremony marked the
commencement of building operations. The function was attended by the then
Moderator Rev. J. McQueen. The new church in Agnew Street was built by
C. Petersen and was opened for worship on July 7th, the Rev- Geo. Ewan of
Mowbraytown conducting the service.
The cause became a sanctional charge in 1916 under the leadership of the
Rev.* Robert Millar. Subsequent ministers who have servied the cause include
Revs. Dr. Gibson, F. W. Gresham, T. Howe-Turner, J. Costello, R. T. Joughin
and H. C. Spijkerboer.
In the early 1920's the church was removed to the present site in Long-
fellow Street, and a manse was purchased in 1925. Further improvements to the
property have included a renewal of the interior of the church in 1936 and the
erection of a new hall in 1940 at a cost of £6OB.
Original worshipers included hte families of Messrs. J. P. Atkinson, A. H.
Morrison, J. Dempster (father of Rev. A. Dempster), J. McClintock, J. Cameron,
Geo. Cameron (a stipendary magistrate), Geo. Gough, H. H. Wilson. Messrs.
R S. Byrnes and R. P. Gresham, Treasurer and Secretary and Assistant Secretary
respectively, of the Presbyterian Church of Queensland, gave excellent service to
the charge when residents in the district.
Two young men from the district, Revs. A. Dempster and K. Gardener, are
now serving the church as ordained ministers.


During the 43 years as a sanctioned charge, four worshippers have servied
as session clerks ; they include Messrs. A. H. Morrison (20 years), J. Dempster
(9 years), J. McClintcck (10 years), and the present holder E. C. Cunningham.
To promote encouragement for cultural attainments in the district the
Sunday School officials decided to organise an eisteddfod in 1925. The venture
met with distinct success and has become a most popular annual event to many
competitors and residents throughout the metropolitan area and beyond. Mr.
H. H. Wilson has held the position of Hon. Secretary and Organiser since the
inception 34 years ago. Much cf the success obtained has been due to his
indefatigable efforts.
It is the fervent prayer of all that under God's guidance the cause will
ex'.end and prosper in the work of extending His kingdom.
A branch of the Norman Park charge has been established at Seven Hills,
which now has its own session. The session clerk is Mr. F. W. T. Main and
the Sunday School superintendent is Mr. Ron Burrows. A lay evangelist campaign
conducted recently gives promise of good results.
CANNON HILL
Early in 1929 a canvass of the families residing in the Cannon Hill district,
with the object of opening a branch of the Presbyterian Church, was made. The
canvass was successful and almost immediately a congregation was holding
services in the School cf Arts Hall, under the jurisdiction of the Hawthorne
Church.
A building committee was formed and ground was purchased, and plans were
made for the erection of a Church Hall. In the meantime services were trans-
ferred from the School of Arts to a marquee, which had been purchased and
erected on the site in Molloy Road.
In March 1930 a stump capping ceremony was held, and later the same
year services were held in the new building.
In 1936 Cannon Hill was detached from the Hawthorne Church and became
attached to the Bulimba Church till 1946, when a petition to the Presbytery cf
Brisbane to place Cannon Hill under the management of the Committee of Home
Missions, for the supply of ordinance and for organisation, with the view to its
being raised to the status cf a ministerial or sanctioned charge, was granted.
The Sunday School was opened in February 1929 with four scholars, and by
the end of that year the number had increased to 70. The growth continued to
increase to such an extent that additional accommodation had to be provided.
It was consequently decided to build a hall to provide the extra accommodation,
and to be also used for general utility purposes, leaving the original building
principally for church services.
The stump capping ceremony was performed by the Moderator of the
Mowbray Presbytery on 19th July, 1958, and he also conducted a dedication
service on the 26th October in the same year.
The new hall, to be officially known as the "Hammond Memorial Hall" when
completed and furnished, will cost in the vicinity of £5,000.
A branch of the "Pathfinders" has been formed for the benefit of the young
girls and boys within the church who, under adult supervision, are being trained
in millinery, woodwork, etc., also devotional exercises.
The Committee of Management have recently commenced a sporting club
which is functioning well and creating a feeling of good fellowship.


SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS
MORNINGSIDE CHURCH
The establishment of the church was the result of a mission held in the
locality which was followed by services held in the Buffaloes Hall, and later in
the Masonic Hall, Morningside.
Approximately 30 people formed the company and under the leadership
of Pastor Roy Alan Anderson, now Secretary of the Ministerial Association of
General Conference of Seventh Day Adventists, made good progress, enabling
favourable consideration to the selection of a site and erection of a church.
Land was secured and the church was erected by Mr. J. W. Groom in 1929,
and provided overall floor space ~47 feet by 27 feet, with two rooms under the
mainn building for Sabbath School and recreation hall.
The dedication of the church by the pastor was held in the presence of a
large congregation.
Activities associated with the church in addition to the Sabbath School are
junior and senior branches of the Missionary Volunteer Society. The Dorcas
Society, which is mainly responsible for rendering material assistance to people
in need.
Early members of the company included Pastors W. G. Turner (President of
Queensland Conference 1929), F. Knight and Marriott, Mr. and Mrs. H. Moseley,
Mr. and Mrs. R. Coe, Mr. and Mrs. John Tritton, Mr. and Mrs. Daniells. Mrs.
Cox was appointed the first church clerk.
The company, with an extending progressive membership, is at the present
time under the leadership of Pastor R. V. Moe, with Messrs. Les Robbins and
David Crabtree as elders.
CHURCH OF CHRIST, HAWTHORNE
This religious organisation was initiated by the formation of a Sunday
School in 1912, which was conducted by Mr. R. Haigh in a shed on his
prcparty in Virginia Avenue, near the Hawthorne ferry.
The movement grew rapidly, necessitating early consideration to acquiring
more commodious premises.
Land in Malcolm Street was secured and plans prepared for the erection
cf a building.
The original church building was erected on 14th November, 1914.
A particularly interesting feature regarding the church was that it was
erected in one day. At an early hour a team of workers, including the necessary
tradesmen, arrived frcm the Metropolitan, Ipswich and West Moreton districts.
A band of women supplied refreshments throughout the day and also assisted
where possible the building operations. The effort created considerable interest
in the district and received commendable praise from neighbouring onlookers,
one of whom, who was an adherent of a sister church, donated the first com-
munion cloth to the church as a mark of appreciation of the effort.
At 8 p.m. work had ceased and a service was conducted by Mr. Nightingale,
Minister of the City Church.
To meet the increasing needs a hall was erected at the rear of the main
building and a further extension has been made by the erection of a new wing
on the eastern side of the church.


Other activities of the church cover the women's Fellowship, the Christian
Youth Fellowship, the Girls' Life Brigade and the Junior Rechabite Lodge.
The first minister to serve hte church was Mr. G. Burns ; others to serve
have been Messrs. J. Marlet, E. Adermaan, J. Martin Rothery, G. Lease, Jim
Larsen, Jack Larsen, A. Nirling, C. J. Williamsand, at the present time, G. H.
Eager,
Services are also conducted at Murarrie in the progress hall.
BAPTIST CHURCH, BULIMBA
The Bulimba Baptist organisation started originally as a home mission and
services were held at the residence of Mr. James Johnston, who donated an area
of land as a site for the church which was erected in the 1 870's.
In addition to Mr. and Mrs. James Johnston, families who were represented
in the early activities included Mr. and Mrs. T. McLauchlan, Mr. and Mrs. Porter,
Mr. and Mrs. Negus, Mr. and Mrs. Crouch, Mr. and Mrs. Mann, Mr. and Mrs.
Green, and Mr. and Mrs. Parsons.
The various activities of the church, with their leaders, include : Sunday
School, Mr. R. Mann ; Youth Movements, Mr. R. Perkins ; Life Boys' Brigade,
Mr. A. G. Manuel ; Church Secretary, Mr. D. Griffith ; Ladies' Guild, Mesdames
D. Humphreys, President, D. Griffith, Secretary, M. Silcock.
A Sunday School has also been established at the Colmslie Migrant Centre.
To cope with the increased youth activities, land has been purchased in
Lytton Road, and a suitable hall is now in course of erection. Future plans
include the removal of the original building to the new site and the erection of a
new church.
The organisation also extends to Norman Park where a small church has
been established. Pastor D. Humphreys is the present officer-in-charge of the
district.
Additional churches in the district for which no information was available
included "Church of England" The Church of the Ascension, Morningside ;
"Roman Catholic" Oliver Plunkett, Cannon Hill, and St. Sabina, Morningside.
Ecation ...
The earliest educational activities in the district appear to have been at
Hemmant where, on May 9th, 1864, a school was opened. It was what was
known as a "Nonvested" school, the parents paid for the building and the
Government provided the teacher. The first teacher, Mr. Frederick Swanwick,
commenced his duties with an attendance of 1 5, ten boys and five girls, ranging
in age from two to thirteen. The elder boys were sturdy and rugged and used to
doing heavy work and not sitting still for long; according to reports they gave
the teacher a lot of trouble.
The original name of the school was Bulimba Creek School, however,
probably due to the erection of the Bulimba State School in 1866, and to avoid
the similarity of names, the school was given the name "Doughboy Creek Mixed
School." Incidentally, Hemmant was originally known as Doughboy Creek.
It is claimed that one of the early explorers landed at the mouth of the
creek and made doughboys for breakfast, hence the original name. Several


years later the name was shortened to “Doughboy" and finally in 1878 it was
changed again to Hemmant.
The School Committee at this stage comprised Messrs. Gaskings, Kavanagh,
Kelk, Gibson and Salway. This Committee petitioned the Education Board for a
new building. The original school was built completely of pine, even to the
stumps ; the ravages of white ants was such that the building became riddled with
holes and was declared unsafe for use. In 1876 a new building was erected, the
estimated cost being £276, and the parents of the scholars were obliged to find
one-fifth of the cost. This building is still in existance as part of the school.
The Hemmant School is number 30 in the official register.
Under the Electoral iDstrict Act of 1922 the Bulimba Creek became the
eastern boundary of the Bulimba Electorate and Hemmant became a portionof
the Electorate of Wynnum.
BULIMBA STATE SCHOOL
The Bulimba State School is the oldest registered State School in the
electorate and number 17 for the whole State- The school site is undoubtedly
one of the best in the State, an elevated position possessing commanding views
of Moreton Bay, Hamilton and New Farm reaches of the Brisbane River, also
sections of the widely scattered suburbs of the surrounding districts.
The school was erected early in 1866 and operations commenced in July
of the same year. The first head teacher was Mr. J. J. Brown, a migrant who
had arrived in Brisbane in 1862. He had established and conducted the first
private school in Brisbane. He gave excellent service and was highly respected
by parents and scholars alike.
The first day's enrolment includes the names of many well-known and
respected families, still resident in the Bulimba district. The first pupil enrolled
was John Tait, then followed in order of enrolment : Archibald Tait, John Watts,
Joseph Pashen, John Watson, Samuel Buckley, Catherine Smallman, Alex Jamieson,
Mary Jamieson, Eliza Collins, Elizabeth Woodland, David Johnson, Arthur Crouch,
James Johnston, John Coutts, Thomas Coutts, Alexander Johnston, John Davieson,
William Nuttall, Fred Wendt, Emily Crouch, Bridget O'Donnell, Stewart Craies
(an orphan), and Fred Porter (Doboy).
The original wooden building of one room had extended to five classrooms
and the head teacher's office when the Government decided to build the present
imposing brick structure which was officially opened in 1938.
The head teacher's residence was originally situated in the school ground
on the site of the present tennis court and some of the earlier boy pupils
remember one of their duties was to cut firewood in the nearby scrub for the
head teacher's wife.
The school has always enjoyed the services of an active school committee
and the memory of two former members have been especially honoured. Mr. A.
Harrison, a member of the committee for over 30 years, is remembered by a
plaque on the present school building, and a sun dial in the grounds is a memorial
to "Vic" Lucas, who was a generous benefactor to the school.
The school possesses a magnificent swimming pool which was officially
opened in March 1955 at a cost of about £8,500, half of which was raised by the
school committee through functions and by donations from parents and supporters.
The remaining half was provided by the State Government under the ground

improvement subsidy scheme. The pool is approximately 82 feet long and 25
feet wide. It is built so that half of the pool may be used for the training of
young children, with depths from 2 feet 9 inches to 4 feet, maximum depth
7 feet 6 inches. Modern amenities and a grandstand have been provided and
all school children are taught to swim free of charge.
MORNINGSIDE STATE SCHOOL
The rapid development of the Morningside and Hawthorne districts in the
1920-24 period, with the consequent increasing child population created a demand
by the progress associations of the two districts to the Government for the
establishment cf a school. At that period nearly 100 school children from the
Hawthorne district were attending the New Farm school, thus necessitating a
hazardous river crossing twice daily. Other public organisations joined in the
request and a suitable site frcm a very few available and at a reasonable price
was suggested for purchase. The request was refused, but continued pressure,
assisted by convincing evidence of the advisability of securing the site won the
day and the necessary steps were put into operation to purchase the land.
The continued rapidly rising population made the erection of a school an
urgent necessity and a request for accommodation for not less than 400 pupils
was made. The departmental officials (no doubt based on the experience of
requests generally) decided on accommodation for 225.
The school was erected and commenced operations on 16th August 1926,
the enrolment cn the first day surpassed all expectations, totalling over 400,
actually nearly 200 more than the school was built to provide for the needs of the
district for several years, at least on the departmental officials' estimate.
By midday the local member reported the situation to the responsible
official and then followed probably the swiftest action ever known by a Govern-
ment offical. The architectural branch were given immediate instructions to
prepare plans and specifications for two new wings to accommodate an additional
400 children ; consequently, before the first day's enrolment was completed,
official action was taken to provide increased accommodation.
The first head teacher was Mr. W. Munt, and the school was classed as
grade 4. However, within a short period, due to the increasing enrolment, the
classification rose to class one and Mr. J. Burge, a prominent educationalist, was
appointed to the position. Mr. Burge was an ardent cricket fan. His son John
served Queensland cricket cn the Australian Board of Control and International
Peter Burge is a grandson. Under the guidance of the head of such a sporting
family it is not surprising that the school has at ail times figured prominently in
sport and a number of the scholars have secured interstate representation.
The first school committee comprised Messrs. A. H. Wright (Chairman),
J. Elder (Secretary), C. Ware (Treasurer), H. Peters, W. Mosses, C. E. Hilderj
and E. Haines.
The school has been extensively increased during the intervening years to
meet the progressively growing number of pupils consequent on the erection
of many new residences in nearby areas.
The number of scholars enrolled at the present time is 1,271, and the
teaching staff, under the head teachership of Mr. G. Anderson, numbers 32,
with six visiting specialist teachers on drill, guidance and speech therapy.
The present school committee comprise Messrs. D. Evans (Chairman) L.
Latham (Secretary), N. Brazil (Treasurer), R. Elder, R. Spinks, V. Burris and


M. O'Bryan, who are working energetically, raising funds for the establishment
of a swimming pool in the school grounds as quickly as possible.
CANNON HILL STATE SCHOOL
The Cannon Hill State School is situated on the main Wynnum Road and
serves a district enjoying a rapidly increasing population. The school was
opened on August 16th, 1915, the first day's enrolment being 176 and the present
day the roll contains 1,219 names.
The original teaching staff including the head teacher, Mr. Tom Inglis,
numbered seven, which has increased to 30 under the control of Mr. C. J. Caskey,
the present head teacher.
The first school committee comprised Messrs. Walker Bartlett (Chairman),
J. Cranley (Secretary), T. Allen (Treasurer), W. Linton, J. Kniepp, A. Love and
H. Kingston.
A feature of the work of the committee in the early years was organising
an annual horticultural and poultry show, proceeds of which were used mainly for
ground improvements and the erection of a swimming pool.
The annual show gained much popularity and received patronage and
exhibitors from many metropolitan districts.
A near drowning tragedy in a nearby waterhole in which a pupil was
concerned was responsible for a special effort by the committee to provide a
swimming pool and thus ensure that each pupil had the opportunity to learn
to swim.
Working bees at week-ends were arranged and parents were invited to
participate in one of two special ways :
(1) to excavate and remove a yard of material
or
(2) make a donation equal to the normal cost of the removal of the same
quantity.
The scheme proved to be very popular and received the utmost co-operation
from all concerned. The baths were completed and the necessary change sheds
and amenities at an actual cash cost of less than £6OO.
The present school committee, comprising Messrs. V. C. King (Chairman),
C. P. Sheehan (Secretary), A. S. Roberts (Treasurer), L. E. Weldon, A. S. Lauman,
R. A. Stewart and Mrs. R. A. Gray, have just completed improvements to the
buildings and relining the bath walls.
The accommodation at the school is now being increased and a new wing
is under construction.
NORMAN PARK STATE SCHOOL
The Norman Park State School began operations on July 9th, 1900, and
the first day's enrolment totalled 52 including pupils from as far away as
Lindum. The names of many well-known residents were among the list and
included Mackay, Svenson, Peterson, Wilson, Porter, Gilmore, Hatton, Woolley,
Atherton and Rossiter.
The first head teacher was Mr. James Keys and the teaching staff comprised
Misses I. Wheeler, N. Sydes and M. Allen.


The office-bearers of the original school committee were W. Young (Chair-
man), F. J. Swanwick (Hon. Secretary), W. Mackay (Treasurer).
To widen the scope of interest amongst the residents of the district it was
decided in 1946 to form a parents' and citizens' association. The present officials
are Messrs. C. C. Campbell (President), Roy Ward (Vice-President), W. T.
Ryland (Treasurer), and Mrs. J. E. Ham (Hon. Secretary).
The immediate objective of the association is the establishment of a
swimming pool in the school grounds. A considerable amount of cash is in
hand and it is hoped that with the continued support of parents and residents
it will be possible to commence construction of the pool in the not too distant
future.
The enrolment at present is approximately 600, with a staff of 16 teachers
under the guidance of Mr. E. Bytheway, head teacher, who, incidentally, com-
menced his teaching career as a pupil teacher at this school.
MURARRIE STATE SCHOOL
The second day of July 1928 was a red letter day in the history of
Murarrie : the opening day for operations in the new State School. The parents'
daily anxiety for their children's safety in the train journey, or long walk, to
Hemmant or Cannon Hill, was over. The school, which is situated on a nicely
elevated site, commenced with an enrolment of 50 pupils with two teachers.
This locality was severely affected during the early thirty's (the depression
years); many families left the district and the school attendance fell to such
proportions that the teaching staff was reduced to one only in 1947.
A steady increase in the population of the district has taken place since
1949, with a consequential marked increase in the number of school children.
The average daily attendance now exceeds 220, with a teaching staff of seven,
including the head teacher, Mr. C. W. Long.
A parents' and citizens' welfare association headed by Messrs. A. Bell
(Chairman), S. Krause (Treasurer), and Mrs. N. May (Hon. Secretary) are actively
engaged in the work of providing amenities for the benefits of the pupils.
BALMORAL STATE HIGH SCHOOL
This institution is the first State Secondary School to be established in the
district, commencing operations in February, 1958. It is ideally situated in at
present an open area, within a quarter-mile from the Brisbane River near
Cairncross.
The educational facilities available are consistent with all the requirements
for the studies of all necessary subjects.
The recreational requirements have received attention, a very fine sports
oval has been laid out and will, when completed, compare favourably with other
similar grounds.
An active parents' and citizens' committee is in existence, the executive
committee comprising Messrs. J. W. Houston, M.L.A. (President), L. L. Lathan,
B. M. Woolley (Vice-Presidents); N. L. P. Holst (Treasurer), D. Anderson
(Secretary), C. J. Harmon, G. B. Bannister (Committeemen), Mrs. M. Kluck
(President Ladies' Auxiliary), G. Churven (School Principal).
Catholic schools are established at Bulimba, Cannon Hill and Norman Park.

BULIMBA SCHOOL OF ARTS
The initial steps to form this institution took place in 1885 when, at a
public meeting of local residents, it was decided that a School of Arts, to provide
a public meeting place with facilities for library accommodation, be established.
A provisional committee was appointed and it was decided to request the
Education Department to agree to the use of a portion of the State School ground
as a site for the proposed building.
The request was agreed to, the Education Department surrendered one rood
of land in January, 1886, and the Government granted a title vested in Trustees.
The first Trustees appointed were Messrs. J. Watson, S. Demack, J. Nuttall,
R. Jamieson, Jnr., and E. Smaliman. They were proclaimed in the Government
Gazette, 1 Qth July, 1886.
The original building, consisting of the main hall with library accommoda-
tion, was opened during 1887. A storm in February 1903 dislodged the iron from
the roof of the main building. Extensive additions were erected in 1903 by
J. P. Parry at a cost of £137. The names of the individual original office-bearers
are not available, but it is certain they were some of the original trustees.
The available records show that the President and Secretary from 1897 to
1905 were Messrs. R. Jamieson, Jnr., and T. C. Storey, respectively. Incidentally
the salary paid to the Secretary v/as 5/- per week and 1/- per hour after 10 p.m.
The salary was increased to £l/10/4 per calendar month and 1/- per hour for
overtime.
At the annual meeting in 1905 it was decided that the position of Secretary
should become honorary. George Porter was appointed Honorary Secretary, a
position he held till 1913 when he was elevated to the position of President.
Fees for the hire of the hall were fixed in 1903 for meetings: 8-10 p.m.,
12/6 ; 8-12 midnight, 20/-; political meetings, 15/- ; local meetings for the good
of the public, 5/-.
Doubtless a considerable percentage of the meetings held would be classed
in the latter category.
An interesting item appears in the minutes of the Committee Meeting in
February 1906 when tenders were opened for the cleaning of the building. Three
tenders were received, the difference being 16/-, 12/- and 9/- per calendar
month —the lowest tender was accepted.
Despite the greatly increased costs of administration and maintenance
throughout the years the membership fees have remained the same. Several
local organisations have been tenants of the institution for over half a century.
It has at all times been the desire of successive committees to increase and
maintain an up-to-date library with the limited financial resources available from
time to time, however, the greatly increased cost of literature has restricted the
extension of this section which now contains approximately 1,500 volumes.
A proposal by the City Council to control and maintain the institution in
conjunction with the establishment of a municipal library for the district is
receiving the favourable consideration of the Trustees and Committee.


MORNINGSIDE MEMORIAL SCHOOL OF ARTS
The rapid development of the Morningside district in the post war period of
the first World War created an urgent need for accommodation for public
meetings, etc. The initial action was taken at a well-attended meeting of resi-
dents, when it was agreed to endeavour to secure the present site "which was
gazetted as a recreation reserve."
The land had been originally purchased by public subscriptions and vested
in three Trustees who, when approached on the matter, agreed to offer no
objection to the use of a portion of the ground being used for the building.
To enable the Committee to approach the financial institutions for the
necessary money for the building, the Government of the day agreed to put
through an enabling Bill which provided the necessary security.
After several unsuccessful attempts to secure financial help locally, a
personal application to the headquarters of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney
met with success and a loan of £1,500 was obtained.
Tenders were quickly called and the then well-known Morningside builders,
Charles Crowther and Sons, were the successful tenderors, the price being £2,000
for the brick cavity wall structure. Good stage accommodation is provided and
an anteroom at the rear provides sufficient room for small meetings, etc., also
accommodation for library books, a library having been established as soon as
possible after the completion of the building.
The building was officially opened in 1926 by the Hon. William Lennon,
Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland.
The original office-bearers comprised Messrs. R. E. Stark (Patron), A. H.
Wright (President), J. A. Hobson (Secretary), C. Ware (Treasurer), E. Danaher,
J. F. Gleadell, J. Swiie, W. Skiller, A. G. Shand.
The institution has proved to be of great value to the district in providing
the necessary accommodation for the various public organisations, and is in
constant demand for social functions. It is pleasing to record that the original
loan liability has been liquidated and the financial position is in a reasonably
sound condition, and the library now contains over 4,500 volumes. The present
office-bearers include Messrs. L. Knight, President, N. Danaher, Hon. Secretary,
A. Clark, Treasurer, F. Amos, J. Mogg, R. Petty, C. Parker, J. Atack, E. Conway
and W. Christie.
CANNON HILL SCHOOL OF ARTS
The porst-war period after the end of the first World War witnessed a
rapid increase in the population of Cannon Hill, consequently the provision of a
public assembly hall became an urgent necessity. Various organisations were
being developed with the only accommodation a room at the State School or the
use of a private residence.
In 1920 a School of Arts Committee was formed and an active organisation
commenced with a fund raising campaign. Within three years sufficient funds
were in hand to meet the cost of the purchase of the selected site and the
proposed building which provided for an auditorium with a floor space of approxi-
mately 40 feet by 30 feet.
The building was officially opened in 1923 free of debt.
The original committee included Messrs, and Mesdames J. McAlister, H.


Marshall, W. Simpson, Brown, Outhwaite, Cummings, Morrison, Wwyer, McLean
and Lather.
The depression years seriously affected the financial position of the
institution and, like many similar organisations throughout the country, a particu-
larly lean period was suffered.
The return to a more prosperous atmosphere created a renewed activity by
several of the original members, assisted by a number of new residents, under
the presidency of Mr. G. H. Marriott.
With the outbreak of World War II public activity increased greatly,
largely attended social functions resulted in hundreds of pounds being raised for
the various patriotic funds.
The new committee, recognising the need for increased accommodation,
decided- to remodel the existing structure and increase the floor space to approxi-
mately 60 x 60 feet, including the provision of dressing rooms and amenities.
The necessary finance, including a loan of £1,300, was secured.
The enlarged building is excellently and attractively designed and is
worthy of the fullest suDDOrt of the district.
The Trustees comprise Messrs. G. H. Marriott, W. H. Cash, P. F. Goldsmith,
J. R. Stagg and J. M. Williamson.
The present committee, many of whom have given continuous service for
a lengthy period, include Messrs. G. H. Marriott (President), E. Browne and R.
Webb (Vice-Presidents), W. H. Cash (Hon. Secretary), H. G. Lamble (Hon.
Treasurer), R. James, W. Burton, H. Hollingworth, W. M. Hughes, Mesdames A.
Cuthwaite, senr., J. Stagg, R. Webb, Larsen and Urban.
Mrs. Cuthwaite, senr., was a member of the Foundation Committe, and has
remained a member of every committee since. She carried out the duties of
Hon. Secretary for several years. She has the honour of being the first woman in
Cannon Hill to be appointed a Justice of the Peace. The appointment was made
in 1932.
A perusal of the last four annual balance sheets disclose steady progress,
including the reduction of the loan indebtedness by £550, a praiseworthy effort.
The committee are desirous of liquidating the loan commitment and hope to be
in a position to favourably consider the establishment of a library. They are
confidently anticipating increased public support to enable their proposed projects
to become an established fact in the earliest possible time.
Girl Guides ...
BULIMBA, BALMORAL AND CANNON HILL DISTRICTS
The story of Guiding in this district began in 1925 when a guide company
was formed at Balmoral under the auspices of the Rev. Steer. The first Captain
was Miss Hendor, with Miss Doris Richardson as Lieutenant. Lady MacCartney
enrolled the first guides after service one Sunday morning under the belfry at
the Norman Park Church of England. Doris and Nellie Richardson, Dolly Shirley,
Olga Hamilton and Edie Riding were five of the eight enrolled that morning.
The first record of Brownies at Balmoral is in 1935 when a pack was
formed by Miss Lertch. A second Pack was started in 1953 with Miss Duce as
grown Owl. For many years meetings were held in the Church Hall and at the

Norman Park School, but the company and packs now meet in their own hut in
Balmoral Park.
The Rev. A. C. Flint was instrumental in starting Guides at Bulimba in
1931. Miss Riding was Captain and Miss Joan Gawthorp as Lieutenant.
Previously there was a company which met for a short time at the Presbyterian
Church, but no records of this company are available. The first five guides
enrolled at Bulimba were Grace Bonifail, Gwen Imrie, Linda Booth, Madge Booth
and Esther Fellows.
A Brownie Pack was also started in 1931 with Miss Nadine Hanlon as
Brown Owl and Miss Joyce Ross as Tawny. A second Brownie Pack was formed
by Miss Dougan in 1954.
Until the Guide Hut in Barnamul Street was ready fro occupation the Guides
and Brownies met at St. John's Church Hall and the Bulimba School.
To meet the needs of girls who had passed Guide age a Sea Ranger crew
was formed in 1947 with Miss Barclay as Skipper and Miss Florence Watts
(Naugh) as Lieutenant. Under the enthusiastic leadership of these two and
later with the assistance of Miss Nancy Harvey and Miss Elizabeth Allen this
crew has gone from strength to strength, carrying the message of Guiding out
into a wider world.
In March 1957 a Guide Company with Mrs. M. Cannons as Captain,
Brownie Packs with Mrs. Brown and Miss Bunderson as Brown Owls, and a Local
Association were all formed at Cannon Hill. At the present time the Guides
meet at the Cannon Hill R.S.L. Hall but plans are afoot to build their own hut
in the near future. Miss Olive Bardsely was the first District Commissioner,
being appointed about 1930.
In 1957 Balmoral, Bulimba, Cannon Hill and East Brisbane became known
as the Margery Charlton Division and Mrs. H. R. Hancock, the first Division
Commissioner. This district has had the honour in that our then Guide Captain
Miss Nancy Harvey was chosen to represent Australia in America in 1955 as
the Juliet Low Friendship representative, and Miss Elizabeth Allen in 1959 was
chosen to represent Australia at the Young Adults' gathering in Pakistan.
On the occasion of the B.P. Centenary in 1957, Sea Rangers Margaret
Adam and Judy Love, both of whom were Queens Guides, and Ann Chesterman,
formed part of the Queensland contingent which attended the World Camp in
Windsor Great Park, England.
The story of Guiding would not be complete without mention of the many
women wh ohave worked on Local Associations to raise money for huts, and the
men who have done such splendid work on these huts.
It is impossible to name all the good people who have helped Guiding, but
the vitality and strength of the Movement in this district is a living token of
gratitude for their efforts.
Boy Scouts ....
THE BOY SCOUT MOVEMENT BEGINS IN MORNINGSIDE
The first Boy Scout Patrol to be formed in Australia was in N.S.W. in 1908.
In the following year Patrols were being formed in Brisbane, and by the end
of 1909, Patrols had developed into Troops, one of which was at Morningside,


under the care of Mr. Stephen Bartlett, who was one of the members at the
inaugural meeting which established the "Australian League Boy Scouts, Queens-
land Section."
One of the most important Scout Camps was then at Morningside in the
area bounded by Wynnum Road and Lytton Road, beyond where the Anglican
Church now stands. In 1910, visiting Troops from Wynnum went by train to
Murarrie, and then walked to the camp, while Kangaroo Point Troop carried all
their equipment from Kangaroo Point to Morningside. Another favourite early
camping site at Morningside was on the present site of Lawson Street. There
was a creek in the bush in the vicinity which provided good drinking water.
In 1910, differences of opinion arose over the proposed affiliation
with the Boy Scout Headquarters, and the existing troops continued fitfully for
a number of years, and finally flickered out, as far as the Movement in this
district was concerned.
In 1926, Mr. Tom Simpson formed the first Troop in the district to be
registered under the now existing organisation, and this was at Morningside.
An attempt had been made just prior to this, by Mr. Stan Dickens, to form
a group, but this was not registered, and was abolished in the new group.
This group, with Mr. Simpson as Scoutmaster, consisted of Scouts and Cubs,
and in 1936 a Rover Crew with Rover Leader R. McSloy was formed.
By 1 934 more groups had been started and a local Association District was
formed, to incorporate the then existing groups into one administrative district.
The inaugural meeting of the South-East Brisbane Local Association was held in
the Morningside Rover Den on July 4th, 1934, the elected officers being:
President, Mr. W. Howell; Chairman, Mr. J. F. Field; and Secretary, Mr. A.
Clarke.
The area covered then included troops at Cleveland, Wynnum, Cannon Hill,
St. Peter and Paul, Morningside and Coorparoo. The number of boys then
enrolled was 203.
The next year saw Bulimba Troop in action.
In 1936, the Morningside Den, where the majority of the meetings had
been held, was burnt down. An aerial pageant, organised by Miss McSloy, was
responsible for raising much of the money required for the new Den, which was
opened by the Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson, on the day of Edward Vlll's abdication,
12th December, 1936.
By 1937, Hemmant, Mt. Bruce and Greenslopes troops were in operation,
as was also a Sea Scout Troop at Bulimba. Arrangements were under way for the
procurement of a suitable camping ground at Capalaba. In 1939, concern was
felt ever the lag in scouting interest, due to the number of older lads who were
joining the Militia. War then started to take its toll of Scout Instructors and
by 13th December, 1939, two of the Sea Scouts had already been gazetted as
Naval Sub-Lieutenants, and were in training at Flinders, while George Arnold
was already serving on one of H.M. ships, and a Morningside Scout, Max Jelly,
was on active service with the A.I.F.
Despite the difficulties of the war years, the district carried on, even to the
extent of providing, in 1940, a swimming pool and camping enclosure at
Colmslie. This, named "Tongala," was opened by the State Chief Scout, Sir
Leslie Wilson, on 17th April, 1941. However, the use of this was short lived, as
the Army moved into the area the same year and occupied the site.


In 1948 the area covered by the District Local Association was reduced to
the East District, and now includes seven groups, namely Murarrie, Morningside,
Norman Park, Balmoral, Seven Hills, Bulimba and Mobray Park. The Sea Scout
Group ceased to function during the war years. It is not recorded how many
Scouts paid the Great Sacrifice during the war, nor the number enlisted, but it
is cretain that many used the training and Scout teachings of loyalty and honour
in those hard years.
In 1959, 33 years after the first Troop was formed in the district, over
450 lads are registered and in uniform as Scouts, Cubs and Rovers.
R.S.S.A.I.L.A. ...
THE TWO GREAT WARS
The district, in common with all other districts in Queensland, rose to the
occasion in the two World Wars. Many hundreds enlisted for active service,
and figures have not been obtainable of the number who made the supreme
sacrifice, but in the first war alone this numbered at least 80.
Memorial plaques and honour boards have been erected in Morningside,
Bulimba, Norman Park and Cannon Hill Memorial Halls. A Memorial Park with
grandstand and trees dedicated to the servicemen and women of Bulimba has
been a boon to the district, and an Honour Avenue of Weeping Figs was planted
in Balmoral Park. A number of trees was also planted at Cannon Hill, and a
statue of the figure of an Anzac is erected at Tingalpa.
In 1928, the Morningside Branch of the Returned Soldiers League was
formed, to perpetuate the memory of the fallen, and assist the dependants
of these men, also to watch over the interests of ex-servicemen, and inculcate
loyalty to the throne.
The name was later changed to Balmoral Sub-branch, so as to include a
larger area of the district. Balmoral Sub-branch is still in existence, but there
are now also Bulimba/Hawthorne, Cannon Hill and Norman Park Sub-branches,
who came into existence after the Second World War, due to the very large
increase in membership.
The League also changed the name to the Returned Soldiers, Sailors and
Airmen's Imperial League of Australia R.S.S.A. I.L.A. and now takes an
active part and interest in the district activities such as "adopting" the local
Scout Groups and, as in the case of Balmoral Sub-branch, "adopting" the
Balmoral High School Cadet Corps.
In recent years, Bulimba/Hawthorne, Cannon Hill and Norman Park have
built their own halls, while Balmoral continue to meet in the Memorial School of
Arts. Each Sub-branch has built some form of Memorial Cairn at which a
Memorial Service, attended by a large number of the local populace, is held
each Anzac Day.
On the eve of Proclamation Day at 9 p.m. of 9th December, 1959
Balmoral Sub-branch, in keeping with other R.S.S.A.I.L.A. sub-branches from
Tweed Heads to Nambour, lit a huge bonfire on the crest of the hill in Balmoral
Park, in sight of the Memorial Honour Avenue, after reading a reaffirmation of
loyalty and also the original Proclamation Speech made by Governor Bowen on
10th December, 1859.

Industries ...
The Electorate is virtually the home of the meat industry of Southern
Queensland and from an early period of the State's existence meatworks and its
allied industries have been in operation.
The processing side of the industry had its genesis in 1881, when, for the
first time in Queensland, meat was frozen at an establishment at Queensport, then
operated by the Queensland Freezing and Food Export Coy.
It is of interest to note that an English Firm in 1880 had commenced the
manufacture of refrigerating machinery for freezing by what was known as the
"cold air system." The first of such machines was brought from England by Mr.
Faucet in .1881. The machine was immediately installed at Queensport and a
carcase of mutton was successfully frozen. The export of frozen meat overseas
was delayed for a considerable period as, due to the depth of water at the river
mouth being insufficient, all cargo steamers had to lighten their inward and
outward cargoes in Moreton Bay. It was necessary that the company should have
a steamer that could act in the dual capacity of storage depot and lighter. To
meet the requirements an order was placed with J. W. Sutton & Co., Kangaroo
Point, to build a suitable vessel. It was appropriately named "Iceberg" and was
the first steamer and boiler built on Kangaroo Point and was fitted with
refrigerating machinery.
The first shipment of frozen meat actually despatched from Queensland
left Queensport in May 1884. The shipment comprised 3,594 carcases of mutton
and 100 quarters of beef. Credit for the enterprise was given to the Queensport
Freezing and Food Coy. although unfortunately the shipment was not a success.
About 1890 the Queensport Meatworks was taken over by the Graziers
Meat Export Coy., and later passed into the hands of Baynes Bros. This firm
provided mostly for the local trade, ship's stores and preserving. They also held
contracts with the Netherlands India Government for army supplies of salt beef
which was sent to Java in casks.
Baynes Bros, held good grass paddocks in the Belmont area, to which access
was provided by the Belmont tram line which connected with the railway at
Norman Park. Parts of the cuttings and formations of this line can still be seen
near the Belmont tram terminus.
The meat for the firms 50 retail shops was transferred by a vessel, S.S.
"Bonito," which on one occasion lost the whole of her top deck and meat cargo,
through being blown overboard in a gale force wind while rounding Bulimba
Point. This boat was later replaced by S.S. "Grazier" which was also replaced
by a vessel of the same name. The capacity of the new "Grazier was 30 tons
of beef and 10 tons of mutton, all hanging on rails on the top deck. The daily
run up the river, loaded with prime meat and under the control of Capt. \A/. L.
Kennedy, was, to Bulimba riverside residents, as interesting as the passing
through along the highways the famous Cobb & Co. coaches.
The company operated a boning, canning and fertilizer department and
employed up to 175 persons, mostly Bulimba district residents. The company
carried out slaughtering operations by night with the aid of kerosene or carbide
lights.
Queensland suffered a severe drought in 1902 and the works were closed
for much of that year, meat being imported from New Zealand for the retail
trade of Brisbane.


The Works were sold to Mr. (later Sir William) Angus in 1929 and the
ruins of the works, the old wharf and its sheds, remain to-day as a mute
testimony of its one-time greatness.
In 1901 Messrs. Birt & Co., who had built a cold storage and ice works
in South Brisbane, built their own killing and freezing works at Murarrie with a
capacity to handle 150 cattle and 600 sheep daily, with cold storage for 1,030
tons. These works became known as Buruda and were also a source of
remunerative employment for many locals. Prior to and during the first world
war a small works known as Acme operated on a site at Doboy Creek. This
works was used for the boneless beef trade. The beef was boned at Murarrie
and taken fresh to Birt & Co.'s cold stores for freezing.
The Moreton works of Thomas Borthwick & Sons Ltd. was constructed and
commenced freezing in 1912. This plant was subsequently modernised and
to-day is an important unit in the export trade of frozen and chilled beef. The
normal annual output at these works are approximately 84,000 head of cattle
and 28,000 calves. Peak cattle slaughterings were recorded in 1957 when
86,882 head of cattle were treated.
Originally the killings were approximately 180 cattle and 4,000 sheep
daily and the first shipment of frozen beef and mutton was made on the "Dorset"
in April 1912. The firm have, in recent years, played an important part in the
development of chilled beef, possessing their own wharf, with deep water
frontage, the largest overseas vessels are able to berth with safety.
Bulimba residents will remember the disastrous fire in 1946, but fortunately
the works were able to operate with a minimum loss of employment. A large
new freezing block, embodying the most modern methods of handling meat
products replaced the damaged building.
At the peak of the season, employment is provided for 600 employees, many
of whom are residents of the district and some with over 40 years of service.
Mr. A. A. Van Hemrigh, Brisbane Branch Manager, is an active resident
in Bulimba, and Mr. J. Simpson, Works Manager, has resided at the Works for
many years.
The American firm of Swift International Coy. became interested in the
Australian Meat Industry in 1912, with an introduction of American capital.
This company decided to build two works one at Cannon Hill and the other
at Alligator Creek, Townsville. A large area of land with river frontage was
purchased at Cannon Hiil. The erection of the necessary buildings was one of
the largest industrial operations undertaken in Queensland up to that time. It
was necessary to remove a large portion of the existing hill away, involving
thousands of tons of earth. The work, which was supervised by Americans,
provided employment for hundreds of Bulimba district residents. A horse drawn
railway was provided for the removal of the soil which was used to level the
surrounding area. The scene was one of great activity as upwards of 300 pick
and shovel men were engaged at the one time with unceasing action, excepting the
meal time break. Almost every nationality was represented and worked side by
side remarkably well. There was practically no machinery used in the excavation
work; a similar undertaking to-day would be accomplished with less than 10
per cent, of the number of workmen.
Explosives were used to loosen the ground and a serious blasting accident
caused the death of several workmen and injured about thirty others. The well


known Bulimba Pashen family suffered a bereavement, George Pashen being
killed instantly.
Slaughtering commenced in 1914 and the name was changed to Swift
Australian Co. Ltd. and operated as such till 1931, when the property was
acquired by the Queensland Meat Industry Board, for the purpose of a public
abattoir, as well as for processing meat for interstate and export trade.
A brief story of the development at the Brisbane Abattoirs is revealed in
the following figures.
Cattle slaughterings 1932—33 llo—lo3 head
1958-59 330-340 head
Refrigeration capacity 1923—33 1,103,490 cubic feet
1958-59 2,234,799 cubic feet
The maximum daily slaughtering capacity at the present time is 1,551
cattle, 4,736 sheep and lambs, 1,600 calves, and 900 pigs.
The Queensland Meat Board, in conjunction with the C.5.1.R.0., developed
a processing technique which permanently established the chilled beef trade in
1934.
The first chilled beef shipment from the Brisbane Abattoir was made per
M.V. "Idomenais" in 1934, when 44 tons was successfully placed on the
United Kingdom market. From this stage the shipments increased rapidly and
by 1939 when the outbreak of war occurred nearly 24,000 tons of chilled beef
had been exported from the Abattoir alone, the highest in any one year being
7,261 tons in 1937-38. During the war all meat for export was required to be
frozen.
THE PROVINCIAL TRADERS PTY, LTD.
PROGRESS OF A QUEENSLAND INDUSTRY
The opening, at the beginning of this year, of the new edible oil refinery
at Murarrie, marked another step in the progress of Provincial Traders Pty. Ltd.
With this and other recently installed plant, Provincial Traders factory ranks as
one of the most up-to-date in Australia. From its beginning in 1931, this
company has rapidly expanded to become one of the top margarine producers in
Australia, and markets its products in all States and New Guinea.
Chemists and engineers in the laboratories are constantly working on ways
and means of improving the products and increasing production, whilst others are
engaged in carrying out countless numbers of tests to ensure that the same
high quality associated with all Provincial Traders' products is maintained.
Parallel with this progress has been that of the associate company, Fertiliser
Distributors Pty. Ltd. Activities in this organisation commenced in 1929 at
Murarrie and over the last few years we have seen the erection of new factories
in Cairns, Mackay and Hemmant. These factories are all equipped with the most
modern plant and machinery, and this year has seen a record tonnage of
fertiliser produced.
Both these companies are entirely Queensland industries, and as such are
strong supporters of other Queensland industries. Provincial Traders Pty Ltd.
are large users of Edible Beef Fats and also use considerable quantities of locally
produced Peanut and Cottonseed Oils, whilst Fertiliser Distributors Pty. Ltd. are
large consumers of Meat and Bone Meal, a by-product of the Queensland meat
industry.

To keep pace with the ever increasing demand by the public for quality
products, these two companies have planned for the coming years a further
expansion programme.
VACUUM OIL COMPANY
To provide for future expansion of the industry this company purchased 63
acres of land at Colmslie in 1943 for the purpose of the safe storage of the
firm's products.
The necessary buildings have been erected and the river frontage of the
property has been graded, a retaining wall built and lawns and flowering trees
and shrubs planted.
A wharf capable of accommodating the largest ship that can enter the
Brisbane River has been erected.
The mobile products handled at Colmslie are delivered by tankers from the
firm's oil refineries in Victoria and are contained in steel storage tanks erected
on the property and which have a total capacity of 13 million gallons. The
largest tank on the property holds 3,000,000 gallons.
A railway siding with three spurs into the Terminal and connecting with
the Cannon Hill main line, enables the petroleum products to be railed to every
railway town in Queensland.
Road tank trucks, some up to 5,000 gallons capacity, are filled here to
supply all the mobile service stations in Brisbane and the Coast.
The drum filling and cleaning plant is the most modern in Australia and is
classed by overseas visitors as one of the best they have seen.
A beautification scheme has been put into operation and where possible the
natural trees growing on the property have been retained.
An ultra modern air conditioned office and employee s amenities building
with full canteen services has been erected on the Lytton Road frontage.
Approximately 100 persons are employed at Colmslie, who, without
exception, fully appreciate the opportunity of working under such ideal conditions.
Incidentally, it will be of interest to note that the oil industry as we know
it to-day, is 100 years old this year.
Colonel Drake drilled the first commercial oil well in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.,
in 1859.
WILSON WARATAH METAL COY. PTY. LTD.
This industry is one of the oldest in the Bulimba district. It was founded
on its present site at Norman Park by the late Thomas Henry Wilson, who arrived
from Manchester, England, in March 1883. After a period in private employment
with Messrs. Smith and Forrester, he commenced business on his own account.
The business was converted into a limited liability company in 1912. A
company recognised as a leader in the production of castings in brass, gunmetal
aluminium, phosphor bronze and anti-friction white metals, has been developed
The principle industries and buildings in Queensland will be found to
contain a portion of this company s products.
The business is now conducted by the four sons of the founder, who have
made a special study of the products manufactured.


JOHN COX & SONS WOOD WORKERS
WYNNUM ROAD, GALLOWAYS HILL
The founder of this industry was John Cox, who arrived from England on
the migrant ship S.S. Limerick" in 1914. A woodworker by trade, he early
recognised the opportunities sunny Queensland, with preponderance of wooden
homes, presented to good furniture manufacturers. He established the present
organisation in 1928 and the firm's products are installed in many local homes.
The factory, which is now controlled by sons Dennis and Neville, who have
introduced a new sphere of operations in the wood turning and moulding, the
latter product a most modern operation in which much of the industry's waste
products are gainfully used.
SEAR AND GUNN PTY. LTD. BULIMBA
This firm, though small, is well-established and specialises in all classes of
plumbers brassware, particularly hot water systems.
This industry has been in operation for five years and is an entirely Queens-
land organisation.
MARINO PRODUCTS PTY. LTD.
BAMBIL STREET, BULIMBA
Manufacturing Engineers and Merchants
Marino Products Pty. Ltd. were incorporated in 1930 and after having small
premises in Creek Street and offices, showroom and factory in Barry Parade,
Fortitude Valley, the factory was shifted to its present site just on 1 1 years ago.
The company manufactures machinery for use by the man on the land,
including hign and low pressure spray plants for the control of pests and fungus
in crops, etc., pumps of various designs and sizes for handling water, petrol,
oils, etc., and the only plastic pump in Australia, if not the world.
In addition to this, they manufacture misting machines which are supplied
all over Australia and are exported to a number of overseas countries. As a
matter of fact, all of the goods manufactured by this company, and in particular
the plastic pump which is made in fibreglass, are exported to a number of
overseas countries.
The Company does all its manufacture on the site in Bambil Street from
raw materials produced in Australia as well as overseas.
In addition to the Engineering Division which has been discussed above,
the company has now incorporated a Reinforced Plastics Division which is just
starting to operate.
C. E. CROWLEY BOAT BUILDER AND DESIGNER
57 McConnell street, bulimba
A comparatively long established boatbuilding firm at Bulimba is C. E.
Crowley which was founded in 1935.
One of the first boats to be built by this firm was for the late Mr. F. Z.
Eager. This launch, "Tangalooma," was a pleasure craft fifty-two feet in length.
Since then countless number of pleasure boats have been built for clients from
all over Australia.
Apart from these, C. E. Crowley has built many sailing craft including the
following Australian title holders: "Malvina," an 18 foot skiff, "Nina,"


"Resolve 1," "Dynamic," "Desire," all 12 foot skiffs, and also the very well-
known 45 foot ketch "Sari Marais 1," which sailed to America.
However, in the boatbuilding industry, many commercial boats are built.
For instance, C. E. Crowley has built luggers for Thursday Island, cargo vessels,
one of the best known being "S-Port," copra boats, and several pilot boats, a
recent one being "Torres V," built for the Torres Strait Pilot Service.
With the war came work for the Services Navy whalers, lifeboats and
aircraft refuelling launches. Much work in boatbuilding is also done for
Government Departments, an example being the "Vedette II," a fortyeight foot
launch built for the Police Department.
Thus is an exmaple of the great variety of building manufactured by this
firm, C. E. Crowley, in the boatbuilding industry at Bulimba.
ROY BLISS BOAT BUILDER
63 BYRON STREET, BULIMBA
The firm of Roy Bliss, Boatbuilder, is one of the more recent establishments
of Bulimba. Roy Bliss is an ex-airman and is no stranger to the suburb, having
learnt his trade with the old Bulimba firm of Norman R. Wright & Sons Pty. Ltd.
After seven years of employment with that firm he spent a few years
gaining experience as a Shipwright at the South Brisbane Graving Dock before
venturing out on his own.
His business activities commenced at Newstead in January, 1958, sharing
the premises of well-known boatbuilder and yachtsman Harold Spring as a
temporary stand until he was able to procure a sight more suitable on the
Bulimba side, situated at 63 Byron Street, where he specialises in fast water-ski
runabouts.
Roy is a keen skier himself and claims that his boats for that purpose are
the best produced in the State of Queensland. Ski boats alone do not keep the
business going. Major repairs to fishing and pleasure boats have also been
carried out. The largest boat built to date by the firm is a 47 foot fishing boat
for Mr. Rowley Reilly, a well-known fisherman also of Bulimba.
J. B. McDOUGALL FURNITURE PTY. LTD.
BARRAMUL STREET, BULIMBA
This is a new Bulimba industry which specialises in the manufacture of "La
Fay" chairs. A pleasing feature is that the whole of the materials used are
produced in Queensland. Although only recently established, the indications are
clear that this enterprise is likely to grow to be an important addition in the
industrial life of the district.
M. R. HORNIBROOK (PTY.) LIMITED
The Bulimba works of M. R. Hornibrook (Pty.) Limited at Carr Street,
Bulimba, are situated on the site of the old aerodrome adjoining Pashen Creek.
The property has been owned by the firm for many years and was not used
until the early part of the last war when five igloos and a rough slipway were
constructed to build barges for the American Army. However, the war situation
changed and this contract was cancelled. In 1944 the area was taken over for
the use of the Royal Navy, and the present large buildings were built mainly as
a radar base.
The firm transferred their works from James Street, Valley, in May 1948.

The area is about 20 acres, the entrance being through the main gates
dedicated to the memory of Robert Clark, Director of M. R. Hornibrook (Pty.)
Limited 1926-46, in appreciation of his loyal service, erected June 1953.
The ceremony was attended by the State Member for Bulimba. Since then
a dry dock has been built and was ready for use in 1956.
The works are primarily used as a supply, repair and manufacturing base for
the firm's contracts. To provide these services it is necessary to have a number
ot specialists such as boilermakers, fitters, storemen, motor mechanics, wire
workers, painters, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, crane drivers and truck
drivers, making a work force of ninety-five.
Queensland contracts are supplied from these works and also special plant
requirements are resigned and built here for contracts in South Australia,
Victoria, New South Wales and to New Guinea.
The boilermakers' shop has built in the dry dock, barges which at the present
time are working in Townsville, Brisbane and the Southport areas. The towers
for Dry Ice (Queensland) Pty. Ltd. were fabricated and erected through this shop.
The fitting shop, besides their normal work, has completed a contract for
the supply of peanut harvesters for Kingaroy producers.
The electrical division, whilst attending to all electrical requirements for
contracts, also has a contracting agency for general electrical work.
Wire ropes are spliced and canvas goods repaired, including suits and gear
for divers.
The garage, sawmill, painters' and plumbers' shops complete the general
picture of an almost self-contained supply base, in that the store can supply the
complete camp for a country job down to small ironmongery items.
The deep water wharf serves the use of our floating river plant and is also
the base for Whale Products Pty. Ltd. during the whaling season when the whale
meal is brought to the wharf and stored in No. 5 building. Whale Products
maintain a permanent office and store in the area.
At present on the wharf is the hull of a steel launch completed in the boiler-
makers' shop and handed over to the owner for fitting out.
Whilst the works are located in Bulimba and staffed in the majority by
local people, its sphere of operations extends through most Australian States
and to near overseas' countries.
RHEEM AUSTRALIA PTY. LIMITED
Rheem Australia Pty. Limited commenced operations in Bulimba, Queens-
land, in July 1 944.
The plant is situated on the Southern bank of the Brisbane River on an
area of 14 acres fronting Pa la 11 and Love Streets, Bulimba.
The company employs approximately 240 people and is engaged in the
manufacture of steel containers which vary in size from 4 gallons to 44 gallons
in the case of drums, whilst the tank production caters for various types ranging
from 50 to 20,000 gallon capacity.
BULIMBA POWER STATION IS A MONUMENT TO PIONEERS
When Queensland gained self-government a century ago, electricity was
unknown to mankind at large. Indeed it was several decades later before people


became aware of the new and rather mysterious forces that were destined to
revolutionise human living throughout the world.
It is recorded that Brisbane was one of the first places in the British Empire
to be given a public supply of electricity. That was in the year 1888, when the
pioneering firm of Barton and White supplied electric light to the Post Office
from a building in an adjacent laneway, which still aptly carries the name
Edison Lane.
This notable landmark of history is of special interest to-day, as we celebrate
Queensland s first centenary. It has a peculiar interest also to resident of
Brisbane s eastern suburbs because in their midst is a mighty monument to the
faith and enterprise of those electricity pioneers. Less than a decade after
Brisbane's first new electric light hte firm of Barton and White formed a further
company known as Brisbane Electric Supply Co. Ltd., and a larger power house
was erected in Ann Street, City. In 1904 this company was converted into City
Electric Light Co., which made rapid progress, building a larger power house in
William Street. Here growth was phenomenal, but the site had its limitations,
and so the year 1926 brought into being the first of the modern power-plants,
now known as Bulimba "A."
This station was erected on a bank of Doboy Creek near where is used to
enter the Brisbane River. This site had the advantages of abundant cooling water,
easy access for coal by rail and river, very little flood risk, and ample room for
expansion. The first power unit had a capacity of 12,500 kilowatts, but Bulimba
"A" steadily expanded to a final development with 92,500 kW installed capacity.
By the end of the second world war, the need for another and larger power
station was seen and Bulimba "B" was planned. The site chosen was Gibson
Island, adjacent to Bulimba "A." Here foundations provided a problem, as solid
rock was some 120 feet below the surface, but this was overcome by driving steel
cylinders down to the rock and filling them with reinforced concrete. The
island was also jointed to the mainland, at its western end, by reclaiming with
hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of ashes, mostly from power house boiler
furnaces.
The Southern Electric Authority of Queensland, which succeeded City Electric
Light Co. in 1953, pressed on with this bold plan to meet the fast rising demand
for electrical power, and put the first 30,000 kW unit at Bulimba "B" into
commission at the end of that year. Since then three more such units have been
installed, bringing the new station up to the half-way stage of the planned
capacity of 240,000 kW.
To-day, the dual power station at Bulimba has a total capacity of 2,125,000
kW, and is easily the largest electricity establishment in Queensland. Expansion
goes steadily on, and assures future security to the rapidly developing primary
and secondary industries of the State. The Bulimba sub-station, which steps-up
power from 33,000 volts to 1 10,000 volts, is the nucleus of a system of trans-
mission which supplies electricity to consumers in an area of about 18,000
square miles.
DARLING DOWNS CO-OPERATIVE BACON COMPANY LIMITED
In 1910 a handfull of farmers met in Toowoomba to discuss the pig prices of
the day. At that time bacon pigs were sold for little more than £1 per head. Out
of that meeting the Darling Downs Co-operative Bacon Company Limited came
into being and a bacon factory was established at Toowoomba.


Although the first years were not always successful the Darling Downs
factory from 1916 onwards became the driving force behind the Pig Industry in
Queensland.
As the years passed by and the company's products became known and
sought after, because of their fine quality, by the consumer public, the company
had to look for additional factory space.
The directors of the Association, in their wisdom, acquired the Meat Works of
Birt & Company Ltd. situated at Doboy on the Wynnum Line (at the time of the
change of ownership Doboy was known as Beruda). These works were remodelled
and the first pigs were slaughtered on March 21st, 1934.
The pig producers of the North Coast, Brisbane Valley, Fassifern Valley and
the South and Central Burnett, aware of the benefits Darling Downs had brought
to the farmers of Toowoomba and surrounding areas, rallied to the support of the
Doboy factory and to-day the products, such as hams, bacon, smallgoods and
corned meats, have an Australian-wide distribution and the Association has a
very substantial export trade.
To-day Darling Downs Co-operative Bacon Association is the only producer
owned co-operative bacon factory operating in Southern Queensland.
During the first year of operation, 1912, 8,232 pigs were treated, and this
later reached a peak of 240,450 per annum. To-day the Association's sales
turnover is approximately £5,000,000 each year and all Queensland should be
proud of this truly co-operative organisation.
QUEENSLAND BACON PTY. LTD.
This firm was originally known as The Queensland Co-operative Bacon
Association Ltd.
In Queensland the move towards the Co-operative manufacture of dairy
products commenced about 1900 and now practically all butter factories are owned
and controlled by the farmer suppliers.
This led to a strong desire to also manufacture bacon and hams under the
same system and in consequence a company was registered in 1911. The scheme
received strong support and by August 1913 the factory had been completed
and operations commenced.
At the official opening ceremony the Chairman of Directors, Mr. T. P.
Farlington Beaudesert, stated that the factory was the largest and most up-to-date
of its kind in the southern hemisphere.
Extensive additions were made to the factory in 1947 costing over sixty
thousand pounds. The additions increased the daily treatment of pigs from six
hundred to one thousand.
The first millionth pig was treated in April 1936 and was the occasion of a
special celebration at which over 800 guests were present including the then
Governor of Queensland, the late Sir Leslie Wilson, and the Hon. Digby Denham,
who had, as Premier of Queensland, officially opened the factory. Up to date
approximately three million pigs have gone through the factory, and consistent
employment is provided for over two hundred employees.
Early in 1958 Australian Bacon sought an interest in the Association and on
May Ist, 1958, the Co-operative Association became Queensland Bacon Pty.
Ltd., an association with southern interests which will undoubtedly accelerate
development and expansion.

It is confidently expected that this old established and renowned business will
now assume a new importance and will play, perhaps, a very considerable part in
the second century of Queensland history.
Many of the factory's empolyees reside in the district. Some of them have
an enviable record of service, in some cases successive generations have derived
their livelihood from "Murarrie" as the factory is famliiarly known in the
trade.
Modern machinery and equipment now permit the manufacture of the finest
quality smallgoods, while the virtues of the mild cured bacon and hams are widely
accepted, not only throughout the State, but in New South Wales and Victoria.
The adoption of the well-known "Dandy" trade mark, the use of the most
modern methods of food preservation, packaging and canning, will undoubtedly
lead to extension of business and, with the strong backing of the large parent
organisation, Australian Bacon Ltd., there is good reason to believe "Dandy"
will become a very great asset to this district.
CAIRNCROSS GRAVING DOCK
During the second world war the electorate was the scene of tremendous
industrial activity for the manufacture and storage of war material.
One of the major undertakings was the erection of the graving dock at
Cairncross, which has a capacity sufficient to accommodate the largest ships
that can be berthed at Brisbane wharves. The dock, built as a wartime
necessity, when ships were required to be serviced without delay, played an
important part, with other maritime projects associated with shipping activities.
A permanent institution, the dock, in addition to giving an important
service to the ships of all nations as required, will also serve as a reminder of a
history-making era in which the City of Brisbane virtually existed under actual
war conditions.

BULIMBA RANGERS' SOCCER AND YOUTH CLUB
The Bulimba Rangers' Soccer Club was founded in 1909 and was mainly
composed of members of migrant families principally English and Scotch. Office-
bearers and supporters included Alec and Dave Simpson, Henry and Sandy
Thomson, John Walters, Jock Stewart, Harry Fletcher, Jack Lloyd, Bert Storie, Bill
Exton and Joe Clegg.
The Club showed early promise and became one of the leading Metropolitan
teams and was successful in winning the major trophy the "Queensland Soccer
Cup"; the players in this team included Archie McGowan, Twiggs Munro, Jim
Peebles, Bill Atkin, Johnnie, Geo and Willie Mackay, Laurie Trainor, Sandy
Thomson, Dave Dougall, Bob Davidson and Adam Morrow.
The Rangers and Thistle matches when played at Bulimba always produced
more than ordinary interest. The visiting team, plus their own pipe band and
supporters, would board the vehicular ferry and would be met by a full contin-
gent of Rangers' supporters, and the whole of the Bulimba juvenile population.
With the pipe band leading the way the assembly moved as a procession to the
players' change rooms at the Balmoral hotel and thence to the football ground,
then known as McDonna's Paddock. The same procedure occurred at half time
and after the completion of the match, back to the ferry ; regardless of the


result of the match, the visit of the Thistles was always a highlight in Bulimba
sporting circles.
The first World War 1914-18 greatly affected sport, and as in most clubs,
a large number of active players responded to the call of duty. The club
went into recess in the depression of 1928-32.
In 1947 a group of soccer enthusiasts including A. Harrison, A. Daly, I.
Kennedy, Jock Weig, R. Lugton, Senr., T. & R. Lugton, Junrs., A. McKensie,
H. Mclntryre and others decided to re-establish the club.
The club secured the services of the Australian and International player Bob
Lawrie, and under his tuition the team made good progress and played in the
First Division through four seasons. The club fielded a Second Division and
three Junior teams in the 1959 season, all home matches being played in
Memorial Park on No. 1 and 2 ovals.
The Junior section of the club is very strong and it is the desire of the
officials to increase the number of junior teams next season and hopes to secure
assistance from local players as coaches, etc., for junior players.
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL FOOTBALL
The Australian Rules game was first introduced into the district by teachers at
the Morningside State School, when several school teams played in the school
competitions in the 1940 football season.
Three years later the first senior club was formed by the Morningside
Athletic Club under the guidance of Messrs. L. Knight, R. Greaves and E.
Danaher.
An additional club, Hawthorne, was formed in 1944, sponsored by Messrs.
W. McGuiness, R. Reynolds, R. Duncan and R. Hughson. The two clubs played
in different divisions of the national football competitions for several seasons.
With the object of raising the standard of play the two clubs agreed to
amalgamate in 1951, under the name Morningside National Football Club (the
Panthers), the colours of both clubs were combined, being black with red and
white stripes. The amalgamation proved very successful, the new club winning
the "B" grade grand final in the following year.
The code has made excellent progress in recent years and the club is now
fielding a team in every grade from A Grade Senior to Under Eleven Midgets,
comprising a total of approximately 150 players in the district.
An increasing number of schools in the district are including the code in
their sporting activities.
The club has obtained its own ground dressing sheds and canteen in Haw-
thorne Park and the popularity of the game has greatly increased.
Local schoolboys who have been chosen to play in the Queensland Interstate
Schools Teams include R. Campling, D. Burrows, H. McGuire, Noel and Neville
McGuiness, R. Byrnes, A. Beatty, M. Prentice, C. Brindley and D. Hawkins.
The highest award in senior football, the "Grogan" Medal for the best and
fairest player, has been won four times by Morningside players Noel McGuiness
(twice), H. McGuire and K. Farnsworth.
RUGBY LEAGUE
This code is played in all the State Schools in the electorate and caters
for many grades and hundreds of players. The introduction of districts into the


code split the electorate into two areas Valley and Eastern Suburbs, the former's
boundary being north of Dutton Street and extending to the New Farm and
Hamilton Reaches of the Brisbane River.
Prior to the creation of district football, Bulimba teams enjoyed considerable
success in the various competitions, the "Violets" were winners of the premier-
ship for seven successive seasons and in the first season of district football the
Valley club's team included no less than eleven Bulimba players.
Vic Jensen, founder of the well-known Brisbane shoe store' was a prominent
rugby league official for many years. Mr. Jensen resided at Galloway's Hill for a
considerable period.
BALMORAL DISTRICT BOWLING CLUB
This club was founded in 1919 at a meeting of residents in the district
which was held in the Shire Council Chambers. The first President was Mr. C. G.
Irish, who occupied that position for the first three years. Mr. J. McLelland
filled the position of Honorary Secretary. The Balmoral Shire Council gave great
assistance and readily agreed to making available a portion of land in Balmoral
Park Morningside as a site. A full-size green 125 feet square was laid down and
the necessary bowl house erected at a total cost of approximately £1,300, green
including excavation and levelling £7OO, bowl house £6OO. The green was
opened for play in 1920 by the President of the Queensland Bowling Association,
A. P. Greenfield.
Membership maintained steady around the total of 80 until the post-war
period of the early forties ; from this time bowls enjoyed a wave of popularity
throughout the nation. Applications for membership flooded into all clubs, and
Balmoral was no exception. A second green became an urgent necessity. A
new lease for 21 years was granted by the City Council for an additional area.
Extensive excavation had to be undertaken in the erection of the second green,
the total cost being well over £2,000. The membership rose rapidly and
eventually a waiting list had to be introduced, the number of members being
maintained at about 190. The greens have earned an excellent reputation over
the years, being classed as amongst the best in the State. It has been the venue
for many important matches, the most notable being the finals of the Singles
and Fours Australian Championship in June this year, before an audience of
nearly 3,000 spectators. The elevated banks on two side created an amphi-
theatre appearance, enabling excellent vision for all.
A new bowl house was erected in 1956 with complete new modern furnishings
at a total cost of approximately £13,000.
The club won the major Pennant Championship in 1956 and a number of
Balmoral players have won honours in various open competitions and have
represented Queensland in interstate matches.
Bowling greens have a big advantage over most sports by virtue of the fact
that a full size green, 125 feet square, provides playing accommodation for 64
players in comfort at the same time.
Many greens are located in park land and in most instances they have
converted what often were unkempt, untidy areas into attractive and pleasant
surroundings.

invasion caused considerable concern in some clubs regarding the advisability of
encouraging ladies to take up the game.
The experience has been that not only have some of the ladies become
most proficient performers, but ladies' clubs have proved to be of great value to
the men's clubs from both a financial and social viewpoint.
The Balmoral Ladies' Bowling Club was formed in February 1931 with 21
members. The first officials were Mesdames A. Harrison (President), L. Atkinson
(Vice-President), C. Palmer (Hon. Treasurer), E. Fairlie (Hon. Secretary). Mrs.
Harrison retained the Presidency for eleven years when failing health caused her
retirement. Mrs. Palmer occupied the Treasurership throughout until her death
in July this year. Mrs. G. Cameron has held the position of Hon. Secretary for
24 years and, with Mesdames S. T. Roberts and A. Bannister, enjoys the well-
deserved honour as life Foundation Members.
During the war years the membership was reduced to eight, but the club
remained active and the President of this centenary year is proud of the privilege
of guiding the activities of the 85 members at the present time.
The club has an amicable agreement with the men's club which provides
for the use of the green and amenities, with complete satisfaction to both
organisations.
CRICKET
The first cricket club in Bulimba was known as the "Bulimba Cricket Club."
It was formed in the 80's and most of the players were members or relatives
of the Crouch families. Other players included Bert Port and Hitchcock. The
matches were played on vacant land near the corner Quay and Brisbane Streets.
Cricket made a definite advance in 1911 when . two clubs were formed and were
known as "Dukes" and "Tcogoolawah," and they became very keen rivals for
supremacy. The "Dukes" were comprised mainly from residents in the Duke
Street area and the players were drawn from members of the following families :
Johnsons, Ridings, Metcalfs and Loves. The Toogoolawah team was obtained from
the surrounding area and some of the prominent players included the Pashen
Bros., Bill and Dave Lindsay, Bond Bros., E. Walker, Davidson and Dixon.
The first World War 1914-18 caused a cessation of cricket during that
time. In 1919 a new club was formed under the name "Balmoral Gordons";
this club played in the Church Union competition for four seasons with distinct
success.
In 1924 sufficient players were available to field an additional team and
both teams transferred to B.C.A. Junior competitions. These teams also met
with considerable success, winning the premiership on several occasions. Prominent
players included the Lindsays, Johnsons, Metcalfs and Love.
A further change took place in 1933 when it was decided to change the
name to Eastern Suburbs Balmoral Cricket Club.
Two teams were entered in the Q.C.A. competition in the B & C Grades
respectively, with players from the Balmoral district eligible to compete. Several
premierships have been won in these competitions. The club went into recess
during the second World War and was re-established in 1943. The home
matches are plyaed in pleasant surroundings in Memorial Park, Bulimba.


MORNINGSIDE
The first cricket club in Morningside originated in 1920 and was founded
through a challenge by young married residents to the single men, most of
whom were associated with the Methodist Church.
The match was played on Boxing Day on a hastily prepared wicket on what
was known as Sleeman's paddock. The club was quickly established and matches
were arranged with outlying centres including Redland Bay, a team which included
Alex Hurwood, who later toured England in an Australian team, Cleveland,
Wellington Point, whose team included Jack Burge, later a member of the
Australian Cricket Board and father of international Peter Burge, Wynnum and
Hemmant Clubs.
All day matches on Australia Day and Easter Monday with the Redland
Bay Club created keen interest and special transport arrangements were necessary
to convey the team and supporters to the matches. Prominent players included
Jack and Tom Oliphant, Ernie Bytheway, now headteacher at Norman Park State
School, Sam Sheppard, Charlie Grimley, Gil Hoskins, J. Martin, H. Jones, J.
Seeley, R. Atkins and H. Wright.
The team played in Church Union for several seasons, on the first concrete
wicket laid down in Hawthorne Park.
SAILING
Bulimba, having the river on two sides, automatically became a home for
those who enjoyed their leisure on the water both for pleasure and competition.
Bulimba therefore has always been to the forefront in the exhilirating
pastime of sailing.
It is a fact that in every class in which Interstate or Australian Champion-
ships have been held, Bulimba sailing men have carried off the honours.
To hark back to the early years we find punt races being held, one famous
racer of these times was known as the "Wire Fence." Later trading schooners,
fishing boats and the like took part in regattas, which also included rowing races.
Clubs at first catered for boats of all descriptions from small sailing skiffs
to the stately yacht. Among these clubs were the Queensland Flying Squadron
and Royal Queensland Yacht Club. Later the Brisbane Dinghy Club, Merthyr
Sailing Club, 14 foot Sharpies Club. As time went on new clubs were formed,
old ones faded out, and some were absorbed into one or other of the new clubs!
Classes catered for by these clubs were many and varied, from the ten-
footers with their enormous sail area, to the stately yachts of 30 foot and over.
At the helm of many of these racing craft were skippers living in this fine
suburb of ours, many of whom became famous throughout Australia.
Among the many men and boats that set out from Bulimba shores to vie
with those from other parts were Jack Whereat (of "Bulletin" fame), whose son
Alf (Toby) later made a name for himself in the 12 foot and 16 foot skiffs. Jack
Cary (one-time teacher at Bulimba School) in the "Gondolier" which was also
sailed by Arthur Baldwin and Sam Sanberg. Harry Chapman had the "Violet"
(14 foot), sailed by Charlie Crouch (Pikie) which won a number of Queensland
and Australian titles. Among other well-known skippers of past times were
Norman Wright (Commonwealth and Gladys and later Miss Brisbane), Eddie
Crouch (Alesia), Alf Whereat (Lulu and Ajaxes, Clar Melv), Walter Crouch


(Swansea), Lance Watts (Joker, Vione, Ibex), Jack McCleer (Dove). Later Vic
Lucas of "Victor" fame came to reside in Bulimba and was the hero of all the
young lads whose ambition was to sail on the river.
Many other of the old residents took part as crew members in many of the
boats and even now Bulimba is in the forefront of the sailing world.
Skippers must have boats and Bulimba was also the scent of much building
of boats. Whereats, Gaskings and later Wrights, Crowleys, Watts and Wrights,
and Mills and McCleers were names that will go down in memory as producers of
champions as well as many stately yachts.
The advent of the motor-boat has curtailed the sailing but still there are
those who love to feel the kick of the tiller in their hands, the fresh breeze
filling the sails and the flying spray. Every week-end the river has its devotees
and many and varied types of tiny ships scud across the water vieing with each
other for supremacy.
The river that girts our suburb has been a home to very many of the
inhabitants who have left their name engraved on its bosom by their love of the
sport of sailing and hte many successes they have attained.
MORNINGSIDE AMATEUR ATHLETICS CLUB
This club was formed in 1928 by a number of parents and citizens in the
district who were desirous of providing an opportunity for the growing number of
teenagers for healthy recreasion.
Several pioneer residents of the district gave financial assistance toward the
purchase of the necessary materials and the club received the full support and
encouragement from Sergeant, later Inspector Stan Patch, the officer there in
charge of the Morningside Police Station.
The early officers included Messrs. E. Danaher (President), and J. F.
Gleadell (Vice-President), L. Knight (Hon. Secretary) for 27 years.
Mr. Eddie Danaher held the position of President from the inception till his
death in 1958 (30 years).
Honorary instructors included Messrs. W. Geach (Wrestling), T. Starkoff
(Gymnastics), J. Gweendych (Weightlifting), E. Danaher (Boxing), Organiser of
tournaments C. Whetton.
The club commenced with a membership of 30 which has now increased
to 420 300 boys and 120 girls. It is non-denominational and is open to all
children over five years of age. Special classes are provided for hte younger
section.
Miss Annette Elmes is the honorary instructor for girls and Mr. Les
Berghofer has acted as general instructor for the past twelve years.
Membership fees commenced and have been retained at ninepence per
wek pr member.
Parents are specially invited and many attend regularly ; quite a number
of parents have retained membership since their teenage days are now co-
members with their own children, particularly in the physical culture classes.
During its thirty years of existence the club suffered two fires in which
a considerable quantity of equipment was destroyed. Replacements have been
secured and the club now owns approximately £l,OOO worth of equipment.


BULIMBA POWER HOUSE


Messrs. Dick Schiefelbein and Sam Elmes have rendered valuable assistance
in the manufacture of the timber equipment.
Additional equipment for the physical culture classes is at present being
installed in the open air in the School of Arts reserve at a cost of approximately
£2OO.
Members of the club have been consistently successful in the amateur ranks
of various sports, particularly boxing.
Discipline is well maintained and it is fully recognised that the creation and
continuance of this club has been of tremendous advantage to the Morningside
district.
CANNON HILL YOUTH CLUB
A meeting of parents and residents of the Cannon Hill district held early
in 1958 decided that it was necessary to provide an opportunity for cultural and
recreational activities for the youth of the district.
The club was established on the 17th April, 1958, with the following
foundation officials : President, W. F. Hardgrave ; Senior Vive-President, W.
Cash; Junior Vice-President, W. Ha; Treasurer, H. Hollingsworth; Hon.
Secretary, W. Burton; Committee, Messrs. J. Kane, E. Wright, E. Brown, R.
Fisher, P. R. Coulsen, Mesdames Jones and Young.
The club meets weekly in the Cannon Hill School of Arts and has a
membership of approximately 300.
Club officials look to the future with confidence, believing that the
organisation will continue to provide useful and healthy recreation for the
youth of the district.

Centenary Year Celebrations ...
Celebrations conducted by the committee during the year were as follows :
(1) An open-air Concert, April Bth.
(2) Procession and Fete, June.
(3) Sports for School Children, July 25th.
(4) Old Timers' Dinner, October 10th.
The open-air Concert was held at Hawthorne Park and was attended by
several thousands of residents. A variety high-class programme was rendered by
local artists and included special items given by a massed choir of schoolchildren
representing all the schools in the district.
The second celebration, the procession and fete, was also a very successful
venture, the procession in which over 40 decorated vehicles participated and
which represented all sections of the community, commenced at Murarrie and
terminated in Hawthorne Park which was the venue for the fete and was the
scene of great activity with many gaily decorated stalls. This function was also
very well attended and will be remembered by many residents as one of the
outstanding events of the centenary year.
The third of the series of celebrations held in the Bulimba electorate to
mark the centenary of Queensland was a combined sports meeting in Hawthorne
Park on Saturday, 25th Juiy.
Approximately a thousand children, drawn from clubs and schools within
the electorate, competed in cycling events, athletic events and ball games.
Unfortunately, a bitterly cold south-westerly blew with force, making the
day one of the coldest on record. As a result there were few spectators but the
severe weather in no way dampened the enthusiasm of the youthful competitors
