LONDON: THURSDAY, AUGUST 9. 1894.
LORE FROM A LADY.
The experiment of allowing a lady to mount the Royal
Colonial Institute platform succeeded so well in the case of
Miss Shaw that the administration, which is not apt to be
too venturesome, was emboldened to admit Miss Spence, of
Adelaide, to a like privilege last week. The result was
eminently satisfactory, as, even from a practical point of view,
Miss Spence made some most suggestive comments on the
Australian situation. Economics, the lady remarked, and Sir
Charles Dilke has proved, can be more easily studied in new
countries:??
We see how enterprise expands into unwise speculation, and how
severely all classes suffer when the natural development receives a
check. Tor the recent terrible financial crisis British capitalists are
much to blame. Mr. Goschen?s conversion of the Three per Cents,
was the signal for sending millions of money out to banks and
finance companies, to inflate the monstrous land boom of Melbourne
and its (suburbs. Australian capitalists themselves, seeing the
steady fall of produce and of profits, due very much to the appre-
ciation of gold, preferred to put money into the banks at 5 per cent,
on fixed deposit. When the natural result of aggressive banking
followed, these capitalists began to withdraw their deposits, and
this and the failure of building societies financed by the banks were
the causes of the failure of some banks, and of the suspension and
reconstruction of many more.
Miss Spence did not take a very rosy view of Australian
finance, nor did she take a pessimistic view. The resources
of Australia are, as she said, enormous. Their homogeneous
population makes their progress more normal than that of
America, which has foreigners and negroes to absorb.
It needs no argument, though the fact is a good deal
ignored or not properly grasped, to show that the existing
low or no value of things in Australia affords the finest
opportunity to prudent and well-informed investors that has
ever been presented since the colonies commenced to loom
large on i_tho political and commercial horizon. He who
despairs of Australia must despair of the world, as
nowhere else will he find a country more ripe unto harvest
for the exploiter who wields a well-directed sickle. There


are not only the ? boundless resources ? which have ,j .
dinned into our ears to nauseating point, but which, never-
theless, are a real live fact, of which the fringe has only been
touched as yet. But there are limitless possibilities of
expansion on already-explored bases, which it only requires
a steady influx of the right stamp of immigrants to convert
into a concrete reality.
As regards minerals, the country has only been subjected
to surface scratching, and this within a very restricted area,
whilst from the soil there is untold wealth to be drawn by
the intelligent and industrious husbandman, just as gold is
got out of the mines,'and without the disagreeable element
of gambling, which is at once the drawback and the incentive
to the latter. Peels advice to his partisans in this country
fifty years ago was ? Register, register.? In Australia just
now the cry should be ?People, people, more people.? At
the moment it seems to be ?Taxes, taxes, more taxes.? This,
if persisted in, can only result in the breakdown of already
overburdened communities. What is wanted is more
shoulders to bear the existing weight, which would be by no
means arduous were it distributed over a reasonable number
of backs instead of the present handful of taxpayers. As
Mr. Littleton well put it in one of his contributions to
our columns, it is not so much the export of meat
that 'should be encouraged, but the advent of more
mouths to consume the locally-bred beef and mutton on the
spot. Only when accompanied by a steady inflow of the
right type of immigrants can fiscal protection be justified
even in new countries, and it is because it has not been so
justified that the system in Victoria is breaking down. One
doesn?t want, at least no enlightened Protectionist wants, to
erect a Chinese wall round a privileged clique. The object
of putting a premium on domestic enterprise in a semi-
developed State is not to hamper the foreigner or to pamper
the ? insider ? but to render the country attractive to the
best bone and sinew of the world, and thus to stimulate
productive energy and prosperous settlement to the utmost
possible extent. Amongst the working-classes in Australia,
and especially in Victoria, the means has been too much
mistaken for the end. Protection is not a good per se. In
fact, quite the opposite, its only locus standi being the
stimulation not the restriction of national development.
But instead of an article we are writing a homily, so we


ï¿½ 1 Aeind up with just one more quotation from Miss Spence?s
Colonial Institute address :??
The wave of depression has checked emigration from the Mother
Country to Australia, whereas now is the best time for people with
some capital and some common-sense to go there to settle. There
never was a time when land could be bought more cheaply, or when
it would be easier to make a start. The more people are in Australia
the better off they would all be. Australia sends to Great Britain
annually five hundred million pounds weight of wool, in the manu-
facture of which, perhaps, millions of her population are employed,
Ihe Mother Country imports about half her food supply. Would it
not he better to manufacture in Australia, where- food is abundant
? take the workers to the raw material rather than the raw
material and the food to the workers ?
There ought to be no doubt in the minds of colonial
politicians as to the right answer to this question, .which is,
only Mr. Littleton?s argument put in a more comprehensive
form. We believe that the statesmen of Australia are
privately fully convinced of the expediency of an immigration
policy, but unfortunately they live publicly in an atmosphere
of clap-trap, opportunism, and pandering to superficial',
popular susceptibilities, which renders it almost impossible
for them to lift themselves, or the communities which they.
assume to govern, out of the mire of false seeming, in which,
with a human weakness for going with the shallow stream
of surrounding tendency, they are too prone to wallow.

EOYAL COLONIAL INSTITUTE.
Abstract of Paper to be read in the Library of the Boyal Colonial
Institute, Northumberland Avenue, on Tuesday, July 81, al
4.50 p.m.
The Institute as a body is not responsible either for the statements made or for

SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL ASPECTS OF
AUSTRALIAN LIFE.
Miss C. H. Spence, of Adelaide, South Australia.
Miss Spence began by saying that she was the first representative
Australian woman who had addressed the Institute; for, though
born in Scotland, she had gone to Adelaide at the age of thirteen,
and had grown up in a Colony not three years old at that time.
Travel had shown her how great is the bond of a common
language and literature. The patriotic song of America is set to
the air of ? God Save the Queen.? There is much ignorance of our
great South lands in America, but all reformers watch affairs in
Australia and New Zealand with intense interest.
Australia was founded on convictism, a thing as bad for the
transporting country as for that to which criminals were sent, for
so long as offenders were sent out of sight a new crop took their
places, and there was no serious attempt at reformatory methods.
South Australia was a free country, founded by doctrinaires.
She is still called the happy hunting-ground of the faddist. In five
directions her lead has been followed : in the separation of Church
from State ; in the secret ballot; in the Real Property Act for land
transfer ; in giving the municipal vote to women ; and in taking
pauper children out of institutions and boarding them in natural
homes.
The sixth fad, the taxation of unimproved land values for the
general revenue, has only been initiated in New Zealand. f
Economics can be more easijy studied in new countries. W
see how enterprise expands into unwise speculation, and
severely all classes suffer when the natural development
check. For the recent terrible financial crisis British capitalists aiJ
much to blame. Mr. Gosehen?s conversion of the three-per-cenirS
was the signal for sending millions of money out to banks and
finance companies, to inflate the monstrous land boom of Melbourne
and its suburbs. Australian capitalists themselves, seeing the
steady fall of produce and of profits, due very much to the apprecia -
tion of gold, preferred to put money into the banks at five per cent,
on fixed deposit. V\ hen the natural result of aggressive banking
followed, these capitalists began to withdraw their deposits, and
this and the failure of building societies financed by the banks were
the causes of the failure of some banks, and of the suspension and
reconstruction of many more.

She did not take a very rosy view of Australian finance, nor did
she take a pessimistic view. The resources of Australia are enor-
mous. Our homogeneous population makes our progress more nor-
mal than that of America, which has foreigners and negroes to absorb.
The fact that labour is done by free men and is honourable made our
convicts more readily absorbed into the industrial population than
in Virginia and Tennessee, where work was done by slaves, and now
by coloured people.
The general revenue provides schools all over Australia, whereas
the Southern States find it hard from local rates to provide two
schools in each district, as the white and the coloured keep apart. J
There is more social freedom in the North and the West of Amerii
than in Australia, but Australia has more political freedom. Hors
racing and betting are the greatest evils among the Australis
youth. No people buy more books, and of a better class, than tl
people of Australia and New Zealand.
As for authors, we have a few good names, and there is a. recen
outcrop of fiction-writers. There is no first-class poet. Mutual
admiration cannot raise any of our helpful verse-writers to the ranks
of the Immortals. But our newspapers are able and respectable,
and are built on the large and liberal lines of ' English journalism.
As a journalist, she was glad to work in Australia, rather than in
the States.
The great object of her life for over thirty years has been electoral
reform on the lines of Hare?s single transferable vote, applied to
districts to return six or more representatives. When labour and
capital, which ought to be friendly, were organised as enemies, she
began to speak in South Australia, and, by the aid of ballot
papers, she had sought to show that reform was just and practic-
able. This was her main object in going to America, and she
believed that public attention had been aroused there. Second to
this, was her advocacy of homes rather than institutions for those
children who were thrown on public charity, which is a burning sub-
ject at the present moment in England.
The wave of depression has checked emigration from the Mother
(Country to Australia, whereas now is the best time for people with
, ;-..,gome capital and some common-sense to go there to settle. There
?inever was a time when land could be bought more cheaply, or when
* -. it would be easier to make a start. The more people are in Australia
ffd the better off they would all be. She concluded by quoting from
Mr. E. A. Petherick, that Australia sends to Great Britain annually
five hundred million pounds weight of wool, in the manufacture of
which, perhaps, millions of her population are employed. The Mother
Country imports about half her food supply. Would it not be better
to manufacture in Australia, where food is abundant?to take
workers to the raw material, rather than the raw material and the
food to the workers ?
