FOREWORD
The following report is the final one of a series of publications on the Barossa
district. The previous reports have dealt with the Nuriootpa area (Soils and Land
Use Series No. 13), the Angaston-Springton and Tanunda Creek-Trial Hill areas
(Soils and Land Use Series No. 22), and the Greenock-Gomersal area (Soils and
Land Use Series No. 30). This report covers the Tanunda-Williamstown area,
which has characteristics of soils and land use differing in detail from those pre-
viously described.


SOILS AND LAND USE IN THE BAROSSA DISTRICT, SOUTH AUSTRALIA
THE TANUNDA-WILLIAMSTOWN AREA
By K. H. NORTHCOTE*
[Manuscript received July 25, 1958]
Summary
In the Tanunda- W iJI iarnstcnvn area the landscape of low, rolling hills and
plains dissected by creek valleys presents a more undulating topography generally
than that found in the Nuriootpa area (Soils and Land Use Series No. 13), yet
without the more prominent hilly features of the Angaston-Springton area (Soils
and Land Use Series No. 22). The relatively numerous creeks are a pronounced
feature, and their surface drainage indicates the general direction of movement
of the underground waters from which some additional supplies could be obtained.
Four broad groups of parent materials occur, and together with the varied
physiography largely account for the diversity of the soils, in regard to both their
morphology and their levels of fertility for plant growth. This is exemplified by
the amount of agricultural development found on the red-brown earths, grey and
brown soils of heavy texture, and wiesenboden as contrasted with the underdeveloped
state of most of the area occupied by the solods and yellow podzolic soils. The
development of these latter soils is a practicable measure but depends on additions
of nutrient elements such as molybdenum, zinc, and copper, and possibly potassium
as well as phosphorus in the fertilizer programme.
Although the seasonal pattern of the climate is very similar to that of the
other Barossa areas, reported earlier, the slightly higher rainfall in the Williams-
town locality may prove attractive for future developments in horticulture in
the district.
The results of this survey in regard to land use confirm those obtained on
earlier surveys, particularly the decline in fertility of surface soils. In addition
there is an unrealized potential for further pasture development, which in many
ways provides the key to the future well-being of the district, in which both cereal-
growing and horticulture are, and will continue to be, important. There is the
decided possibility of increasing vine plantings in the Williamstown area and in
this regard the yellow podzolic soils may have a special significance for such varieties
as Riesling.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Barossa district covers about 250 square miles of country in parts of the
Hundreds of Belvidere, Moorooroo, and Nuriootpa, County Light; part of the
Hundred of Barossa, County Adelaide; and part of the Hundred of Jutland, County
Sturt, in South Australia. It is important as the largest wine-producing district in
Australia. The Tanunda—Williamstown area (Fig. 1) is situated in the southern
portion of the Barossa valley (the northern portion of which forms the Nuriootpa
plains) and in the adjoining, almost contiguous, Lyndoch valley, which extends
south to the Williamstown locality.
The Tanunda-Williamstown area covers about 24,000 acres and arable farming,
pastures, and horticulture make significant contributions to the local economy.
In point of total acreage, the horticultural development is second only to that of
the Nuriootpa area.

II. THE LANDSCAPE
(a) Physiography and Drainage
(i) Physiography
The dominant feature of the area is the generally subdued landscape of low,
rolling hills and plains dissected by creek valleys and bounded by the steep gradient
of the northern Mt. Lofty range to the east, where the hills rise to over 2000 ft
above sea-level. The elevation of Tanunda is 864 ft, Lyndoch 595 ft, and Williams-
town 900 ft (approx.). The detail of the landscape is complex.
Two units corresponding to the two soil maps may be recognized; the Tanunda-
Rowland Flat unit and the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit.
(1) Tanunda-Rowland Flat Unit. —This is the southern extension of the
Barossa valley formation, the northern portion of which was described by Northcote,
Russell, and Wells (1954). It is more broken and undulating than the broad, flat
Nuriootpa plain to the north, and has a steeper gradient towards the North Para
River, which forms the western limit of this survey. The boundary between the
northern and southern portions of the Barossa valley formation is defined by the
northern limit of the Tanunda micro-association of grey and brown soils of heavy
texture, their dark grey clay surface soils contrasting with the lighter coloured,
sandy textures of neighbouring areas.
The Tanunda micro-association of soils covers flat plains. It occupies promi-
nent and geographically central positions throughout the unit (see Map A) and
represents the remains of former lacustrine deposits. These have been dissected
by numerous creeks, such as Tanunda Creek and Jacob Creek which cross the area
in a general north-westerly direction to flow into the North Para River. Former
creek activity has resulted in exposure of Tertiary materials, especially along the
North Para River, the presence of older alluvial deposits of variable nature such
as the high-level river gravels of Jacob Creek, between the plains of the Tanunda
soil micro-association and the present creek valleys, the presence of piedmont
alluvial plains between the Tanunda soil micro-association and the hill slopes to
the east, and the formation of a series of terraces in the alluvial deposits. The
topography of this unit is essentially that of a dissected plain of lacustrine sediments
with terraces and creek flood-plains and with piedmont alluvial plains extending
down from the bordering hill slopes.
This unit merges into the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit near Altona and
Hoffnung Lagoon, which probably represents the southernmost limit of the Barossa
valley formation although now separated from it by a minor watershed on a pied-
mont alluvial plain in the vicinity of Trial Hill Road.
(2) Lyndoch-Williamstown Unit. —The low, rolling hills and the shallow
Lyndoch valley, which runs meridionally, almost through the centre of the unit,
present a contrasting landscape to that of the previous area.
It is a somewhat wedge-shaped unit with the narrow end based on Williams-
town. The steep slopes of the northern Mt. Lofty Ranges form its eastern margin
and the lower but quite rugged hills of the Barossa Reservoir catchment area form
the south-western limits, Sandy Creek the north-western edge, and the North Para


River defines the northern limits of the unit. Lacustrine and alluvial deposits are
largely restricted to the Lyndoch valley, Tweedie Gully, Victoria Creek, and their
tributaries. The low hills are composed of Proterozoic rocks, mainly phyllitic slates
(Campana 1955). These rocks outcrop frequently and occur at shallow depths below
the soils, which in most cases are formed directly from them. Important areas of
Tertiary (?) deposits occur in two broad bands which extend from the Sandy Creek
locality, one diagonally across the area to Altona and the other along the south-
western margin of the area to Williamstown. The Sandy Creek-Altona band, in
which irregular sand-ridges occur, has been dissected by the Lyndoch valley.
(ii) Surface Drainage
The principal drainage-way is the North Para River, which flows in a general
south-westerly direction from Nuriootpa to near Rowland Flat, where it bends
sharply to the north-west, ultimately flowing out in a general westerly direction
into Gulf St. Vincent. In the Tanunda—Rowland Flat area it is joined by several west
to north-west flowing tributaries, the larger being Tanunda Creek, Jacob Creek,
and Kabininge Creek. A watershed near Altona is the starting-point for westerly
drainage to Lyndoch valley, which rises in the Williamstown locality and follows a
northerly course to join the North Para River near sections 546 and 547 in the
Hundred of Barossa. It has many small tributaries, the larger being Tweedie Gully
and Long Gully. Sandy Creek, which forms the north-western limits of the survey,
also follows a northerly course to join the North Para River downstream from
Rosedale. Victoria Creek, a tributary of the South Para River, flows south-west
across the southern tip of the area in the vicinity of Williamstown. It is separated
from the headwaters of Lyndoch valley by a watershed near Williamstown.
Poorly drained areas occur locally at Hoffnung Lagoon in section 567, Hundred
of Barossa, where two lagoons form seasonally. The smaller is fresh but dries out
more rapidly than Hoffnung Lagoon itself, which becomes saline during the summer
and autumn. A low watershed of soil material prevents surface drainage flowing
from this lagoon into Tweedie Gully.
(iii) Underground Water Supplies
The hydrology of the Barossa valley, including the quality of the water, has
been discussed in some detail by Chugg (1955), who finds that the direction of
movement of underground water appears to conform generally with that of the
surface drainage, additional supplies of underground water may be obtained from
bores, and a safe maximum annual amount for this additional withdrawal would
be about 150 million gal and 50 million gal respectively for the Tanunda-Jacob
Creek and Lyndoch valley areas, provided bores are adequately spaced.
(6) Parent Materials of the District Soils
Four broad groups of parent materials from which the soils were formed may
be recognized in the area, as set out in Table 1. Their origins are related to a variety
of geologic events which resulted in the formation of the present physiography,
outlined above. This is the main reason for both the large numbers and the diversity
of the soils, as well as their great range in fertility levels. The soils formed from


the Tertiary(?) deposits are easily the most impoverished, with more nutrient-
element deficiencies than those formed from any other parent material. Even so,
the range of soil conditions which affect plant growth varies greatly within the one
broad group of parent materials, for example, in the soils formed from lacustrine
sediments the wiesenboden soils are influenced by a water-table whereas the grey
and brown soils of heavy texture are not. Thus the kind of soil needs to be taken
into account when plant growth is considered. In general, data relating to the
origin of soils, when considered with the subsequent pattern of soil development
(which is reflected in the classification of the soil) and with their physical and
chemical properties, will provide valuable information concerning both present and
potential problems of soil fertility.
III. THE SOILS
There exists a considerable variety of soils in the Barossa district, as previously
reported (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954; Northcote and de Mooy 1957;
Wells 1959). This continues into the Tanunda-Williamstown area. Notable soil
differences between this area and those studied previously are: (i) the large areas
of grey and brown soils of heavy texture, which are found in the Greenock-Gomersal
area also but do not occur extensively in the Nuriootpa or Angaston-Springton
areas; (ii) the large areas of solonized forms of brown earths which are often inti-
mately associated with the grey and brown soils of heavy texture as soil complexes;
(iii) the large areas of solods and other sandy soils which are also a feature of portions
of the Nuriootpa area but are particularly well developed here; (iv) the areas of
yellow podzolic soils which also contain, in complex, small areas of sands, solodized
solonetz, and solodic soils, whereas the yellow podzolic soils of the Angaston-
Springton areas are associated with skeletal soils; and (v) the relatively small but
significant area of wiesenboden.
On the other hand, the similarity of soils and soil conditions between the
Tanunda-Williamstown area and the Nuriootpa and Greenock-Gomersal areas is
clearly evidenced by the common occurrence of large areas of red-brown earths
with smaller areas of solodized solonetz and alluvial soils.
{a) The Mapping Units and the Soil Maps
(i) Mapping Units
Sixteen major soil groups, many of which conform to the great soil groups
described by Stephens (1953), were recognized, as set out in Table 1 and in the
keys to the mapping units on the soil maps.
The soil family, which is the next higher stage in soil classification above soil
series, has been used in defining and mapping the individual kinds of soils within
these major soil groups. This approach is an advantage in an area like the Barossa
district where large numbers of similar, but not the same, soil series occur, because
they may be drawn together under the one name. Furthermore, observed similarities
with soil series of adjoining areas are readily brought out. For example, the family
similarity between some unnamed red-brown earth soil series in the Tanunda-
Williamstown area and the Stockwell and Light Pass soil series of the Nuriootpa

PARENT MATERIALS OP THE DISTRICT SOILS

area were established on the survey, thus these unnamed soil series could be placed
along with the Stockwell and Light Pass soil series in one soil family, the Stockwell-
Light Pass soil family. This technique has been used wherever family similarities
could be established. It avoids excessive naming of soil series also.
Twenty soil families were defined and used as mapping units, together with
6 soil series, 8 soil groups, 1 micro-association, 23 soil complexes, and 1 soil com-
bination. These are shown on the accompanying soil maps and are described below.
(ii) Soil Maps
Two soil maps are included for the area, one covering the Tanunda-Rowland
Flat unit and the other the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit. This is necessary because
of the awkward shape a combined map would have.
(6) Description of the Soil Areas
Representative profiles of the different soils are described in Appendix I.
The data given below are used to bring out the features of the mapping units as
individual areas of land; but to avoid repetition, such subjects as the nutrient
element position, waterlogging, salinity, and other specific factors which affect
productivity will be discussed separately in the next section. The following comments
on the soils and their companion profile descriptions given in Appendix I should
be regarded as reference data to be read in conjunction with the soil maps.
Category I. Soils with Marked Contrast in Texture between Surface Soil and Subsoil
All soils of this kind have surface soil horizons clearly distinguishable from
the subsoil horizons below. The surface soils are sands, loamy sands, sandy loams,
and loams while the subsoils are clays or less frequently sandy clay loams or sandy
clays. The contrast between surface soil and subsoil is often enhanced by the arrange-
ment of the subsoils into clearly defined structural units, e.g. prismatic structure,
which have been described by Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954).
(i) Subsoils Containing Free Calcium Carbonate {Lime)
{A) Red-brown Earths. —All red-brown earths, in which two broad subgroups
may be recognized as {a) deep red-brown earths and (6) shallow red-brown earths,
have three important features in common: browm to grey-brown coarse to medium-
textured surface soils which in (a) are 6-24 in. thick and in (6) 3-9 in. thick; red-
brown clay subsoils in [a] 12-30 in. thick and in (6) 4-15 in. thick; and a deeper
subsoil of brown clay with accumulations of calcium carbonate — (a) usually contains
less carbonate than (b) and in (b) this layer is frequently cemented and laminated
whereas it occurs in pockets, inclusions, or veins in (a), and moreover, the calcareous
horizons begin at greater depths in (a) (20-36 in.) than in (b) (12-24 in.). Some of
the best district soils and certainly those most easily adapted to a variety of agri-
cultural uses are included.
(1) Stockwell-Light Pass Family. —This comprises all the deeper red-brown
earths of the area which have typically developed on the alluvial-colluvial deposits
of piedmont fans and lower hill slopes to present broad areas of fairly uniform soils
with slopes ranging from Jess than 1 per cent, at the base to about 15 per cent, at


the top. Compared with the areas covered by the Light Pass and Stockwell soil series
of the Nuriootpa area (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954) their development in
the Tanunda-Williamstown area is limited. The texture of the surface soil is pre-
dominantly a loam in the piedmont fan above Jacob Creek and a sandy loam in the
Trial Hill locality. Loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand textures of the surface soils
are encountered in these soils in the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit. Because they
cover relatively small individual areas there, they are not entirely typical of the
family; soil-moisture relationships, for example, are influenced by the topography
and the surrounding soils.
(2) Jacob Family. —These soils cover the older terrace formations which
present weakly undulating, inclined surfaces having irregular low ridges throughout
and sloping away from the edges of the Tanunda micro-association which they
adjoin. The alluvial deposits on which Jacob soils formed are variable in character
but are typified by waterworn stones, which are a striking feature of series 1. The
variation in the parent material is reflected in differences between the component
soil series, particularly the stone content and the mottling of the subsoil. Jacob
soils all have loamy sand surface horizons which vary in thickness from 4 to 27 in.
and mottled red-brown clay subsoils varying from 14 to 24 in. thick. The calcium
carbonate content of the deeper subsoil is also variable. In places it rises to within
9 in. of the surface and here it coats gritty bands of parent material, the red-brown
clay horizon being entirely lacking. Thus the Jacob soil areas are fairly variable as
regards both profile changes and the microtopography. Jacob soils occur also in
complex with both the Tanunda and Kabininge soils (see map A).
(3) Bilyara Family. —The Bilyara soils are shallow red-brown earths which
were defined on the Nuriootpa survey (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954). They
cover remnants of older terrace formations (series 2) and piedmont fans (series 4)
which have inclined almost flat surfaces and present relatively small areas of fairly
uniform soils. Series 2 has surface soil texture of loamy sand, sandy loam, loam,
and sandy clay loam, and these changes occur over very small distances, the sandy
clay loam patches often standing out as areas of “hard” ground. Series 4 has a
fairly uniform loam texture of the surface soil and a dark red-brown clay subsoil
whereas that of series 2 is reddish brown. Bilyara soils occur also in complex with
the Tanunda grey and brown soils of heavy texture.
(4) Dale Family.— The Dale family of moderately shallow red-brown earths
covers the low rounded, rolling hills and the short piedmont fans which spread out
from them in the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit. Parent materials are dominantly
Proterozoic phyllitic slates and alluvial-colluvial deposits derived from them.
Dale soils have loam surface soil horizons 8-10 in. thick, a red-brown clay subsoil
6-15 in. thick overlying large amounts of calcium carbonate with weathered slates
below this. Slate fragments also occur throughout the profile. Dale soils on their
own provide fairly uniform areas of soil, but as they occur commonly in complex
with either the Wilsford terra rossa soils or the Altona grey and brown soils of
heavy texture, soil conditions do change markedly over short distances.
(5) Williamstown Family.—These deep red-brown earths occur only in the
extreme south-western portion of the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit on Proterozoic


schists which were partially weathered before the development of the Williams-
town soils began. They cover several low rounded hills and also occur on lower
hill slopes, following in ribbon formation the schists which were exposed by dis-
section. The surface soil texture is typically a loam and fragments of schist appear
throughout the profile but are especially concentrated in the A 2 horizon. The red-
brown friable clay subsoil of about 20 in. thickness passes down into weathered
schist in which accumulations of calcium carbonate appear in cracks and pockets.
Williamstown red-brown earths cover fairly uniform areas but the size of these
varies a great deal.
(B) Brown Earths. —The general form of their profile is similar to that of the
red-brown earths but their surface soil is generally greyer and the clay subsoil is
typically brown. They occur in seasonally moister situations than do red-brown
earths. Agriculturally they are good soils.
(1) Para Family. —The Para soil series was defined in the Nuriootpa area
(Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954) and similar series (see Appendix I) defined
on this survey have been placed with that series in the Para family. They occur
typically on newer terraces formed from alluvia and provide fairly uniform soil
areas although individually not very large. The Para soils are all deep, with a fine
sandy loam surface soil 12-18 in. thick over a dark brown clay subsoil and with small
accumulations of calcium carbonate below 30-36 in.
(C) Brown Earths-Solonized Forms. —Their profile form is similar to that of
the brown earth but the surface soil is notably powdery and/or crusty and the
subsoil, which has a strong prismatic structure, is tough and hard when dry and
tough and sticky when wet; that is, they have poor physical properties which may
be attributable to the influence of the sodium ion (Table 4). They are not good
agricultural soils in their present state but can be greatly improved by fertilization
and clover pasture leys to become quite useful.
(1) Bethany Family. —These shallow soils, in which the surface horizon is a
loamy sand 4-5 in. thick over a subsoil of impermeable clay with pockets of calcium
carbonate in its deeper layers, have formed on alluvial-colluvial deposits of pied-
mont fans with slopes of up to 15 per cent. Their soil areas are fairly uniform but
small changes in the thickness of the surface soil markedly affect plant vigour.
(2) Kabininge Family.— These are deeper soils than those of the Bethany
family but their subsoils are equally impermeable and consequently the effects of
seasonal waterlogging are more evident in their subsurface horizons. They are
formed on alluvial-colluvial deposits of piedmont fans, on lacustrine sediments, and
also where the two interfinger. Two series were recognized. Series 1, which has a
sand surface 9-15 in. thick, occurs in small but discrete areas of a fairly uniform
nature. Series 2, which has a light sandy loam surface about 6 in. thick, always
occurs in complex with the Tanunda grey and brown soils of heavy texture. Such
complexes cover large areas which present variable soil conditions for plant growth.
{D) Transitional Red-brown Earths-Solonized Soils. —Soils placed in this group
are somewhat intermediate in character between red-brown earths and solodized
solonetz. Surface soils are usually sands or loamy sands, light-coloured with an


almost white (bleached) subsurface horizon which overlies variously mottled clays
with accumulations of calcium carbonate in the deeper layers. These features are
similar to those of the solodized solonetz but their friable prismatic structure, which
readily breaks down to small blocky units, contrasts with the columnar form of
that group but is similar to the structure of many red-brown earths. As may be
expected, they are fair agricultural soils capable of improvement.
(1) Nuriootpa Family. —The Nuriootpa soil series was defined by Northcote,
Russell, and Wells (1954) and similar soil series (see Appendix I) defined on this
survey have been placed with that series in the Nuriootpa family. They occur
typically in the lower-lying situations along the fringes of the Tertiary deposits
where these adjoin the Proterozoic phyllitic slates. They present fairly uniform
soil conditions for each individual area of occurrence.
(2) Unnamed Soil Group RS2.—This is a group of variable soils with a general
similarity to the Nuriootpa soils but formed on micaceous alluvia of the newer
terraces. They cover small areas only.
(3) Unnamed Soil Group RS3.—This collection of transitional red-brown
earths is typified by hydromorphic features at the junction of the A and B horizons
where a relatively thin (up to 1 in.) but hard and impermeable layer is found. Such
soils cover only small areas, especially where drainage conditions are intermediate
between those pertaining to red-brown earths and solodized solonetz respectively.
Moreover, each individual area has some peculiarity of its own.
( E ) Solodized Solonetz. —The soils included in this group have bleached (almost
white) subsurface horizons immediately above the clay subsoil, columnar structure
of the subsoil, and visible accumulations of calcium carbonate in the deeper subsoil.
They cannot be regarded as good agricultural soils, seasonal problems of drought
and/or waterlogging and sometimes salinity being a feature, but fertilization and
sound agronomic practices can do much to enhance their productivity.
(1) Nuraip Family. —Soil series similar to the Nuraip soil series of the
Nuriootpa survey (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954) have been grouped together
to form the Nuraip family. In this area Nuraip soils have formed from a variety
of parent materials but especially from Tertiary deposits exposed and/or transported
by past stream activity and other alluvia of varying origin. The areas of these
soils are moderately large, particularly in the valley of Tanunda Creek, and show
some variability due to small changes in topography of an irregular ridge and swale
type. Nuraip soils are deep, with a sand surface and a pronounced bleached sub-
surface horizon overlying an impermeable subsoil clay. They can be regarded as
strongly solodized solonetz.
(2) Unnamed Soil Series S6.—Only very small areas of these light sandy loam
moderately solodized solonetz soils (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954) were
encountered.
(3) Unnamed Soil Series SlO. —Generally similar to the Nuraip soils but kept
separate from them because of the loamy sand surface soil and the greyer, more
sticky subsoil clay. They cover only small areas and have developed from the
alluvia of piedmont fans and older terraces.


(4) Unnamed Soil Seri's Sll. —This is quite a distinctive, shallow, weakly
solodized solonetz, related to the Moorooroo soil series of the Nuriootpa survey.
511 covers a strip of transitional soil on the outer margin of some areas of the
Tanunda grey and brown soils of heavy texture. The sandy loam surface soil is
typically brittle and crusty, indicating the presence and effect of the sodium ion.
(5) Warpoo Family. —These sandy strongly solodized solonetz occupy small
localized rises in the Tertiary deposits of the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit. Because
of this they are more droughty than the other solodized solonetz. Warpoo soils
also occur in complex with the Barossa yellow podzolic soils.
(F) Solodic{l) Soils. —These are all shallow soils characterized by tough clay
subsoils which evidence the effect of the sodium ion. They are always found in
small areas, usually local hillocks in, and marginal to, the Tertiary deposits. They
frequently occur in complex with the Barossa yellow podzolic soils.
(1) Unnamed Soil Group SCl.—This mapping unit embraces a variation of
soils with loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand surface textures; two main kinds of
profiles are given in Appendix I. Because of their small areal extent, they are not
important agriculturally except in so far as they may become local foci for run-off
and thus for soil erosion.
(ii) Subsoils Not Containing Free Calcium Carbonate [Lime)
(A) Solod. —Characteristic features of this group are deep sandy surface soils,
pronounced bleached subsurface horizon, a subsoil more clayey than the A horizons
and of massive form often with an irregular domed surface, and the absence of visible
accumulations of calcium carbonate in the deeper subsoil. Solods have some
similarity with strongly solodized solonetz but are even more leached. They are
poor agricultural soils with seasonal problems of drought and/or waterlogging, but
correct fertilization and sound agronomic practices will markedly improve their
productivity.
(1) Moppa-Vine Vale Family. —The Moppa and Vine Vale soil series were
defined on the Nuriootpa survey (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954) and similar
series (see Appendix I) found in this area have been placed with them in the Moppa-
Vine Vale family. Here, these soils are formed on alluvial-colluvial deposits of pied-
mont fans and lower hill slopes. They cover relatively small areas with slopes of
1-15 per cent. Soil conditions are fairly uniform within each area. Agriculturally
they are superior to the other solods.
(2) Willamba Family. —These are the most widespread solods in the area and
are particularly prominent in the Sandy Creek locality; they also occur in the
Greenock-Gomersal area (Wells 1959). The Willamba soils are developed on
Tertiary deposits and cover a dissected plain on which irregular sand-ridges add
to an already complicated microtopography. Profile variations are considerable,
particularly in regard to the thickness of the sand A horizons which vary from
6to 72 in., 30-36 in. being a common depth. The shallow phases occur on upper
slopes, especially around Sandy Creek, and the deeper phases on lower slopes and
on sand-ridges. The subsoil is a mottled light red sandy clay loam which has a
very irregular up-and-down surface. All these features add up to quite variable


soil conditions pertaining over the Willamba soil area. These soils have a low order
of fertility and are generally more droughty than thu other solods.
(3) Incrassata Family. —The soil series included in this family are similar to
the Incrassata soil series defined on the Nuriootpa survey (Northcote, Russell, and
Wells 1954). They are developed in the relatively lower-lying situations on Tertiary
deposits around the margin of the Willamba soil area, and other areas occur marginal
to the Barossa yellow podzolic soils. The coarsely mottled clayey sand or sandy
clay loam subsoils, with clay coatings on the sides of cracks and aggregate faces,
clearly show the influence of the fairly severe seasonal waterlogging which is a feature
of Incrassata soils. Individual areas of these soils are not large and the soil con-
ditions are fairly uniform throughout.
(4) Long Family. —In broad terms the Long soils family is similar to the
Incrassata as it is developed on similar Tertiary parent materials, but the brighter
colours and only slight mottlings of the sandy clay loam or sandy clay subsoils
show that they are better-drained soils. They are found along drainage-ways in
the Willamba soil area; other areas occur marginal to the yellow podzolic soils.
(5) Unnamed Soil Series 1.- —This soil series covers very small, narrow areas in
hollows in the Willamba soil area. The organic surface soil and the gley features of
the subsoil (see Appendix I) indicate the severe restriction on drainage which occurs
seasonally.
( B) Podzolized Lateritic Soils
(1) Belvidere Series. —One small area of this soil occurs near Tanunda. The
Belvidere series, which was defined by Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954), has
sandy A horizons containing variable amounts of ironstone gravel which overlie
mottled clay subsoils at 9-18 in. in depth. They are low-fertility soils with a
seasonal problem of subsurface waterlogging.
( C) Yellow Podzolic Soils. —The main characteristics of these soils are coarse-
textured A horizons, a definitely lighter-coloured A 2 horizon often of a yellowish
colour, and a mottled yellow clay subsoil of weak angular blocky structure when
moist. Yellow podzolic soils have poor reserves of plant nutrients and their subsoils
restrict water movement. Correct fertilization and sound agronomic practices
involving a clover pasture will greatly increase their productivity.
(1) Barossa Family— The Barossa family of yellow podzolic soils is fairly
widespread in the south-western portion of the Lyndoch-Williamstown unit where
their parent materials, the Tertiary deposits, cover large areas. The topography
is that of a dissected plain with many minor topographic irregularities. Barossa
soils are fairly deep with a sand surface of about 15 in. in thickness over a clay
subsoil some 30 in. thick, below which are found mottled clays and sandy clays of
the Tertiary deposits. In themselves, the areas of Barossa soils present fairly uniform
conditions but considerable variation is encountered owing to the small areas of other
soils frequently found in complex with them. These are soil group SCI of solodic(?)
soils, soil group CS2 of sands and ferruginous material, and the Warpoo solodized
solonetz, as shown on Map B.


(2) Unnamed Soil Series YPI. —Only a small area occurs to the east of
Williamstown. The coarse sandy surface soil is usually about 18 in. thick, but there
is much variation. It overlies a mottled clay subsoil of about 6 in. in thickness
which in turn overlies weathered sandstone. The areas of YP I soils are hilly with
some steep slopes exceeding 25 per cent, and therefore soil conditions are quite
variable.
Category 11. Soils ivith No Marked Contrast in Texture between Surface Soil and
Subsoil
These soils do not have the distinctive contrast in texture between surface
soil and subsoil found in the Category I soils. Soil groups are developed on coarse-
textured and on medium- and/or fine-textured parent materials.
(i) Coarse-textured
[A) Sands. —This grouping includes all the sand soils Avhich, because they
lack distinctive profile features, cannot be placed with any recognized major soil
group. On the whole they are of limited agricultural value.
(1) Unnamed Soil Group CSL—These deep soils formed from Tertiary materials
are usually very coarse and may contain a high percentage of quartz and ironstone
grit and gravel. Slabs of sandy ironstone are often associated with them. Areas
are not large but much local variation is usual.
(2) Unnamed Soil Group CS2.—lncludes both shallow and deep ferruginous
coarse sandy soils with a reddish brown sandy loam surface. They are formed from
the Tertiary materials and slabs of sandy ironstone, ferruginized quartz con-
glomerate, or ferruginized schist are common throughout. They are remnants of
former geologic periods and consequently the variation is considerable.
(3) Unnamed Soil Group CS3.—These are the very deep light-coloured loose
sands of which a limited area occurs north-west of Altona. They are probably
derived from Tertiary materials.
( B ) Skeletal Soils
(1) Unnamed Soil Group Ski.—Very small areas of these soils are found north-
east of Lyndoch where they are associated with outcrops of jointed quartzite. They
are essentially shallow loamy soils overlying weathered rocks at variable depths
(commonly 8 in. here); small veins of clay may occur between the cracks in the
rock. Other descriptions and details of skeletal soils in the Barossa district are
given by Northcote and de Mooy (1957).
(0) Sandy Alluvial Soils
(1) Turrung Family. —These include all the deep, fine sandy soils adjacent
to drainage-ways. They are freely to excessively drained (Northcote, Russell, and
Wells 1954).
(ii) Medium- and/or Fine-textured
(A) Terra Rossa Soils.— Their characteristics are: red to brown mellow,
structured soil usually of shallow depth; no free calcium carbonate in this soil
material unless incorporated by cultivation; and underlain by calcium carbonate
accumulations with a hardened capping.


(1) Wilsford Family. —These shallow, friable loam soils have developed from
Proterozoic phyllitic slates and are widespread in the north-eastern portion of the
Lyndoch-Williamstown unit in association with the Dale red-brown earths. Two
complexes between these soils were mapped as Wilsford-dominant and Dale-
dominant. The former, the Wilsford-Dale complex, occurs over the more broken
and hilly terrain, outcropping rock being a feature also. The latter, the Dale—
Wilsford complex, occurs on the lower, more rounded hills which are marginal to
the former complex. The usefulness of these soil complexes is largely determined
by local topography as both the component soils are sound agricultural soils.
(. B ) Rendzina
(1) Kroemer Family. —Similar shallow dark-coloured calcareous soils were
defined in the Nuriootpa area by Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954). Only two
small occurrences were found in the surveyed area.
( C) Grey and Brown Soils of Heavy Texture. —These are essentially deep clay
soils, either grey or brown, with a thin, favourably structured, often self-mulching
surface soil which passes fairly sharply to subsoil clay of more massive structural
units which continues for some depth, often with calcium carbonate accumulation
in its lower part, and gradually passes to lighter coloured, often mottled brown,
clays containing calcium carbonate. A feature of such soils is the conspicuous
pattern of cracks up to 1-2 in. in width which form as the dry season progresses.
Gilgai formations often occur and with these calcium carbonate may be distributed
irregularly throughout the profile and on the soil surface. They are sound agricul-
tural soils especially for annual grain crops.
(1) Tanunda Micro-association. —These are the conspicuous “black” clay soils,
the flat expanses of which dominate the landscape from Rowland Flat to Tanunda
and west across the North Para River too, in the Gomersal area (Wells 1959).
Gilgai formation —hump and hollow microrelief —was a feature before cultivation
but is not evident now except along little-used roads and along fences. These soils
have developed from older lacustrine sediments and provide fairly uniform con-
ditions for plant growth over large areas. The grey soils of heavy texture are dominant
over their brown counterparts throughout most of the area, but the two do occur
within a few yards of each other in many places. Another minor feature is the
presence of occasional small saline depressions.
The Tanunda micro-association is found in complex with both the Jacob and
Bilyara families of red-brown earths and also the Kabininge family of solonized
brown earths. These complexes provide the contrast of clay, loamy sand, and
sandy loam surface soils occurring within yards of each other and thus provide
very variable soil conditions over relatively small areas.
(2) Altona Micro-association. —These grey and brown clay soils (see Appendix
I) have developed on Proterozoic phyllitic slates and rarely occur over large
individual areas but are common in complex with the Dale red-brown earths to
provide variable soil conditions over relatively small areas.
(D) Wiesenboden. —These are essentially dark-coloured clay soils with cal-
careous clay subsoils and a fluctuating ground-water table.


(1) Lyndoch Family. —These black clay soils found in the Lyndoch valley are
developed from newer lacustrine sediments, still under the influence of ground water.
They provide fairly uniform soil conditions for plant growth except for variations
introduced by the fluctuating ground-water table which has affected the salinity
of this soil and especially its deeper layers in parts of the valley.
(. E ) Alluvial Soils
(1) Unnamed Soil Group 10.—The black loam and clay loam soils of creek and
river flood-plains are included here; seasonal water-tables may influence these soils
(Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954).
Category 111. Soil Complexes
Where soils change over distances too small to allow their individual areas to
be mapped out separately, they are grouped together and mapped as a soil complex.
Complexes of named and numbered soils have been discussed already under
the appropriate major soil group heading (see soil maps also), but besides these
there are the soils which occur in proximity to the drainage-ways.
[A) Soils along Drainage-ways: DW3, DW4, DWS, DW6, DW7. —Complexes
DWI, DW2, and I) IT3 were mapped in the Nuriootpa area (Northcote, Russell,
and Wells 1954).
(1) Complex DW3.—This includes all the soils of the present flood-plain] of the
North Para River and some of its tributaries. Each time floods occur these soils are
altered. Useful soil areas do occur, particularly along the Tanunda and Jacob Creeks.
(2) Complex DW4. —This complex embraces all the soils found in the Tweedie
Gully-Lyndoch valley areas except the larger areas of the Lyndoch wiesenboden.
They are mainly deep fine micaceous sands, brown earths similar to the Para soils
family, transitional red-brown earth-solonized soils, and small areas of the Lyndoch
wiesenboden. The generally favourable water regime of this valley area enhances
the agricultural value of these soils.
(3) Complex DWS. —This accounts for the seasonally waterlogged, that is
hydromorphic, variations of the Stockwell-Light Pass red-brown earths and the
Altona grey and brown soils of heavy texture. This is a ribbon development along
small drainage-ways and thus of strictly limited agricultural significance.
(4) Complex DW6. —This complex includes the ribbon development of solodized
solonetz and solod soils around some of the smaller drainage-ways. Their agricul-
tural use is restricted.
(5) Complex DW7. —In the Rosedale locality there is a complex array of
flood-plain and newer and older terraces along the North Para River, the soils of which
are defined as complex DW7. It is very variable, but the most important parts
agriculturally are the terraces; the older and higher, which may exceed 7 chains
in width, are covered by an alluvial soil with brown earth affinities. The newer and
lower terraces are often wider and their soils, which have less definite brown earth
affinities, are much more variable, usually containing a large amount of water-
worn stone.


Category IV. Soil Combinations
{A) Trial Hill. —The soil combination is a broad-scale mapping unit used here
to show the relationship between this area and the adjoining Tanunda Creek-Trial
Hill area (Northcote and de Mooy 1957), the Trial Hill combination forming the
common ground between the two areas. The dominant soils in this combination,
which covers the lower rounded hills flanking the eastern side of the Barossa valley,
are red-brown earths, grey-brown skeletal soils, and grey-brown podzolic soils.
These are described by Northcote and de Mooy (1957). In the areas of the Trial
Hill combination near Hoffnung Lagoon and Tweedie Gully, the Dale red-brown
earths occur as well as the Trial Hill family of red-brown earths recorded previously.
(c) Factors Affecting Soil Productivity
(i) The Question of Nutrient Elements and Soil Fertility
It is well known that plants differ in their requirements for nutrient elements
and that soils differ in their ability to supply them. Because of this some soils are
termed deficient. A soil deficiency may be either absolute, when not enough of
the nutrient is present to allow the normal growth of the plant, or partial, when
additions of the nutrient will improve yield and/or quality of the plant. Many
deficiencies fall into the latter group. Again, deficiencies may be natural or induced
by agricultural practices, for example, by over-cropping. The only way to deter-
mine conclusively the needs of particular plants and soils is to grow plants in soils
under field conditions. To this end a number of techniques such as the use of
symptoms of indicator plants, chemical analysis of plants, pot-culture methods,
all of which give useful clues about what nutrients to try in the field, have been
developed. Basic to all this should be a knowledge of the kind of soil involved, its
origin and formation, and its chemical properties, especially the exchangeable
cations. These characteristics provide data regarding the level of the reserves of
mineral nutrients in the soils and a guide to the predisposition of soils to deficiencies.
Then, if these data are considered along with accumulated experience, clues about
the deficiencies of particular soils will emerge and suggestions for trials in the field
may be made. In this connexion, the soils of the Tanunda-Williamstown area may
be divided into three broad groups as follows:
(a) Soils with the exchangeable cations largely dominated by hydrogen or
hydrogen plus magnesium and with relatively low total exchangeable cations
(less than 15 m-equiv. per cent, in Bj horizon), i.e. with a predisposition
to deficiencies—podzolized lateritic soils, yellow podzolic soils, some solods
(such as Incrassata), sands, skeletal soils, and some sandy alluvial soils
(Table 2).
( b ) Soils with the exchangeable cations largely dominated by the metal ions
(calcium, magnesium, and potassium) and with relatively high total
exchangeable cations (more than 15 m-equiv. per cent, in Bi horizon),
i.e. a low predisposition to deficiencies—red-brown earths, brown earths,
transitional red-brown earths-solonized soils, terra rossa, rendzina, grey
and brown soils of heavy texture, wiesenboden, some loamy alluvial soils
(Table 3).


(c) Soils with a significant proportion of sodium in the exchangeable cations
(more than 6 per cent, in the Bi horizon and increasing in amount with
depth), i.e. a predisposition to deficiencies due to the influence of sodium
ion—solonized forms of brown earths, solodized solonetz, and some solods
(such as Moppa-Vine Vale) and solodic soils (Table 4).
It will be noted that solods may occur in both groups (a) and (c), which is to
be expected from their morphology and chemistry which place them somewhere in
the soil spectrum between solodized solonetz and some forms of podzolized soils.
(1) Nitrogen and Phosphorus. —These two major elements are considered
separately because they are needed in nearly all South Australian soils. Indeed,
the phosphorus deficiency found in so many of our soils has led to the technique of
improving and maintaining soil fertility with superphosphate applications and
subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum) pastures, a method which is applicable
to most of the district soils although barrel medic and snail medic ( Medicago
tribuloides and M. scutellata) may replace subterranean clover on the grey and brown
soils of heavy texture, rendzina, and wiesenboden.
Nitrogen and organic matter are closely bound up with each other and their
level in soil is related more to soil husbandry than to the kind of soil. In the Barossa
district, for example, on the same soil type an area under improved pasture con-
taining subterranean clover will contain more than two and a half times as much
nitrogen as an area of clean-cultivated vineyard or orchard (Northcote and de Mooy
1957). This is one reason for the loss of surface soil fertility and increasing erosion
in vineyard and orchard soils as previously discussed by Northcote, Russell, and
Wells (1954).
In common with most South Australian soils, phosphorus contents are low
(Tables 2-4), soils of group (6) being slightly better supplied than those of ( a ) and
(c). Applications of superphosphate to all soils should be regarded as basic for
sound agricultural practice in the district. In this regard, soils of group (a) and
possibly (c) require heavier initial applications and maintenance dressings than do
those of group ( b ) (Tiver 1955). This is one reason for the lower productivity which
is found on many areas of soils of classes (a) and (c) as compared with those of class
(b). There is room for continued research such as that of Cook (1942), Woodroffe
and Williams (1953), and Donald and Williams (1954) into this aspect and also
into the question of the residual effect of applied phosphate on different soils.
(2) Soils of Group (a) — Podzolized Lateritic Soils, Yellow Podzolic Soils, Some
Solods, Sands, Skeletal Soils, and Some Sandy Alluvial Soils. —These are the soils in
which many deficiencies of both an absolute and a partial nature have been recorded
in other areas and in a wide range of plants (Tiver 1955; Northcote and de Mooy
1957). Besides nitrogen and phosphorus, the most widespread deficiencies seem
to be molybdenum, zinc, and copper, especially in subterranean clover. It is
interesting and a reflection of the highly weathered state of group (a) soils that
the order of importance of these nutrients varies from locality to locality. The
suggestion is that they are all needed for high-class production. Again, even if no
plant response is obtained, copper is frequently necessary to maintain stock health
and wool quality. Copper, zinc, and molybdenum are also at least partially deficient

for many horticultural crops grown on these soils. Vines may respond to zinc
swabbing by increased yields (Coombe 1952). Where copper-containing sprays are
used for disease control it is most unlikely that copper deficiency will arise.
Sulphur deficiency may be important too, but since it is a constituent of
superphosphate, the application of this fertilizer will correct it, at least temporarily,
on many of these soils. Other sources of sulphur may become necessary, however,
as the general level of soil fertility and organic matter is raised and the content of
phosphorus increased (Anderson 1952 a; Steinberg and Williams 1956).
All the soils of group (a) are low in potassium and calcium, the yellow podzolic
soils being particularly low in calcium. There is every reason to anticipate at least a
partial potassium deficiency on these soils, possibly induced by current forms of soil
management which, while satisfactory on the more fertile red-brown earths, are not
adapted to the low-fertility soils of the district. Indeed it is suggested that where
these soils have been used intensively for horticultural crops, potassium is needed
now, especially where an attempt is being made to grow legumes for green manure
or ley pasture purposes, and also where fruit quality is declining. Since calcium
is a constituent of superphosphate, an absolute deficiency seems unlikely where
this fertilizer is used, although partial deficiencies in particular crops are more
than feasible.
The Willamba solod deserves special mention as a soil of very low natural
fertility in which deficiencies may be induced relatively easily by using cultural
practices suitable for more fertile soils such as the neighbouring red-brown earths.
Highly developed orchards on the Willamba solod have with the passage of time
shown examples of many deficiencies, including copper, zinc, boron, manganese,
and recently potassium; pears in particular have suffered. Deficiencies will be
more intense on the deeper phases of the Willamba soils than on the shallower phases.
In view of the low fertility of group (a) soils and their predisposition to
deficiencies it is not surprising that large areas are underdeveloped by comparison
with the rest of the Tanunda-Williamstown area. But improvement of the soils
with nutrient elements and subterranean clover pastures is a practical proposition.
(3) Soils of Group (b) — Red-brown Earths, Brown Earths, Transitional Red-
hrown Earths-Solonized Soils, Terra Rossa, Rendzina, Grey and Brown Soils of Heavy
Texture, Wiesenboden, Some Loamy Alluvial Soils. —Apart from phosphorus and
nitrogen, which have been discussed above, zinc is the main nutrient element likely
to be required on all these soils. Moreover, the evidence suggests that zinc occurs
mainly as a partial deficiency; for example, vines may respond by increased yields
to zinc treatment even though there are no obvious symptoms of zinc deficiency
(Coombe 1952). Furthermore, it is highly likely that zinc deficiency will occur on a
wider range of plants on those soils in which not only a high pH but also the calcium
carbonate content influences the nutrient element position, that is, in the shallow
red-brown earths such as Bilyara series 2, rendzina, grey and brown soils of heavy
texture, and wiesenboden. Millikan (1938) reported zinc deficiency in flax grown
on the Wimmera grey soils of heavy texture, which are related to the Tanunda
soils; Forster and Hore (1939) obtained increased yields of wheat on the Wimmera
soils too; cereals, subterranean clover, and flax have all responded to applications

of zinc on the grey and brown soils of heavy texture in the south-east of this State;
and experimental applications of zinc to grapes grown on the Tanunda soils allowed
normal setting of the berries where previously it was extremely poor (Wells 1959).
Manganese is also a possible deficiency for some plants grown in the more
alkaline and calcareous soils of this group —rendzina, grey and brown soils of heavy
texture, and wiesenboden —although no local reports are known. The incidence of
manganese deficiency is usually seasonal, being more apparent in dry seasons,
especially where the soil is affected by a water-table as the wiesenboden are.
(4) Soils of Group (c) — Solonized Forms of Brown Earths, Solodized Solonetz,
Some Solods and Solodic Soils. —The high content of exchangeable sodium is the
special feature of these soils. It could cause an imbalance between nutrient elements
and make them relatively unavailable. Again, sodium ion has helped to maintain
the poor structure and consistence found in the sandy loam types, such as the
Bethany and Kabininge series 2 soils, and because this restricts water entry the
nutrient supply is often limited, seasonally, sooner than in non-sodium soils.
Apart from nitrogen and phosphorus, zinc and copper are the main deficiencies
likely to occur on these soils. Zinc has proved useful on vines (Coombe 1952). The
application of both zinc and copper has allowed subterranean clover pastures to
become established on similar soils in the south-east of the State.
The supply of potassium is generally adequate although the solods are border-
line and could become deficient.
The supply of calcium is adequate in the solonized forms of the brown earths
but is border-line in the solodized solonetz and solods. The possibility of deficiency
is reduced by the use of superphosphate, which contains calcium, as a fertilizer.
The Bethany and Kabininge soils could be made much more productive as their
total exchangeable cation content is quite good (Table 4). To do this, it is suggested
that the structure and consistence of their surface soils should be improved by
establishing subterranean clover pastures with superphosphate applied at the rate
of 2 cwt per acre per year over a period of 5-6 years plus 7 lb zinc per acre and
31 lb of copper per acre in the first year only; after this a maintenance ration of
superphosphate at 1 cwt per acre per year should be sufficient. Adequate seed-
bed preparation is advisable on these soils.
(5) Phases of Soil Types. —lt is important to realize that within the groups
outlined above, and indeed within the one soil type, a variation in the thickness of
the surface soil occurs, and that generally speaking the deeper the surface soil
beyond the optimum range of 6-15 in. (depending on texture), the greater the chance
of deficiency problems. This is particularly the case with sand textures. Of course,
the rooting habit of the plant must be considered also. Again, where the surface
soil is shallow, problems of soil drought may affect the nutrient element position.
(ii) Physical Properties for Plealthy Soils
The behaviour of soil towards tillage operations, entry of water and its passage
through the soil, aeration, the development of plant roots, and liability to erosion
are among the factors which depend on the physical properties of the soil. Conse-
quently, it is important to have satisfactory physical conditions in soil for good
plant growth.


(1) Surface Soils. —Surface soils are stable under well-managed pasture, and
conversely are liable to degradation under prolonged clean cultivation such as that
commonly practised in vineyards and orchards. The better the original structure
and consistence of the soil, the longer will be the time involved before degradation
occurs, e.g. the Wilsford terra rossa soils as compared with the more readily degradable
Bethany solonized brown earths. This loss of structure and consistence leads to erosion
which causes the removal of plant nutrients accumulated in the surface soil, e.g. of
phosphorus and nitrogen, so that a serious decline in surface soil fertility results
(Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954).
The surface soils in this area may be placed in three broad textural classes,
as follows:
(a) Sands, loamy sands, and light sandy loams;
( h ) Sandy loams, fine sandy loams, sandy clay loams, and loams;
(c) Clay loams and clays.
(а) Sand, loamy sand, and light sandy loam textures are found mainly in
the solodized solonetz, solod, yellow podzolic soils, podzolized lateritic soils, sands,
skeletal soils, and sandy alluvial soils, and sometimes in red-brown earths and
transitional red-brown earths-solonized soils (see Appendix I). Prolonged clean
cultivation results in the formation of a loose, single-grain condition in the surface
soil, especially where it contains 5 per cent, or less of clay. As a result the soil does
not always accept water readily, its liability to erosion is high, and the level of
plant nutrients is low. The large drifting sand-hills in an area of Wifiamba sand
east of the Sandy Creek locality are striking examples.
(б) Sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and loam textures are
found mainly in the red-brown earth, brown earth, solonized brown earth, terra
rossa, solodic soils, and in some alluvial soils (see Appendix I). Prolonged clean
cultivation results in a break-down of the structural units of the surface soil with
a release of clay particles which become suspended in water during rain and form
a film on the soil surface as it dries. The skin or seal of clay so formed (Northcote
and de Mooy 1957) reduces the rate of water entry into the soil, thus increasing its
liability to erosion. This condition and the resultant erosion may be observed on the
Dale and Williamstown red-brown earths, particularly where they have been used
for cereal-growing in short-term rotations.
(c) Clay loam and clay textures are found in the rendzina, grey and brown
soils of heavy texture, and wiesenboden (see Appendix I). The rendzina has a well-
aggregated granular surface soil which allows water to enter readily, but when wet
it becomes sticky and may hamper tillage operations. Both the grey and brown
soils of heavy texture and the wiesenboden have coarsely-structured shrinkable
clay surface soils which are only slowly permeable to water once the large summer
cracks have closed. They are liable to some seasonal waterlogging and conversely
set down hard when dry, thus hampering cultivations at either extreme. Never-
theless, their structural aggregates are relatively stable or else reform fairly readily
in the moist state, and on this account they are well suited to arable farming.
Many areas of the wiesenboden soils have surface deposits of sandy loam and sandy


clay loam soil washed down from nearby slopes and these vary from mellow to
sealed conditions. In the latter state and because the area is almost flat, water
accumulates and may stand for some time on the soil surface.
These adverse conditions may be corrected by improving the organic matter
content in the surface soil. A green manure crop (Till 1953) will maintain or at
least slow down the rate of deterioration of the surface soil in vineyards and orchards.
But where the surface soil has already deteriorated ((a) and (6) above), improve-
ment by this means is doubtful and certainly slow. It is better to use a pasture
containing a legume such as subterranean clover together with adequate fertilizers,
depending on soil type. The increased root and microbial activity will reform satis-
factory soil structure and consistence. Badly sealed and compacted orchard soils
in the Light Pass area are being improved by this means. Eroded arable soils will
respond to the same technique (Hayman 1945). The common factor in soil manage-
ment which maintains both sound physical condition and a favourable balance of
nutrient elements in the surface soil is the growth of pasture containing a legume.
(2) Subsoils. —Apart from the surface soils, the arrangement of horizons in the
profile and the structure and consistence of subsoils strongly influences the internal
soil-water relationships and the ease with which plant roots may explore the subsoil
(Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954). This is especially important for deep-rooting
plants such as the vine. In terms of their physical attributes, these soils may be
placed into four classes as follows:
(а) Soils with structure and consistence of subsoils favourable for water move-
ment and root exploration—the red-brown earths, brown earths, transitional red-
brown earths-solonized soils, terra rossa, and some alluvial soils. These are the
soils which have a generally satisfactory soil-water regime for plant growth. But
their subsoils are so highly structured that once the surface soil is removed by
erosion the subsoil aggregates are readily detached from each other and erosion
gullies develop rapidly.
(б) Soils with large prismatic, columnar, and massive subsoils which are
relatively impermeable and thus conducive to the formation of seasonal perched
water-tables which result in waterlogging of the 3-12 in. of surface soil immediately
on top of the subsoil during winter and spring. Conversely, because much of this
water is lost by lateral movement instead of penetrating into the deeper subsoil and
being stored there, a more intense seasonal drought results during summer and
autumn. The yellow podzolic soils, podzolized lateritic soils, solonized brown earths,
solods, and solodized solonetz are included here. Broadly, they are the poorly drained
soils of the area. The depth of their surface soils and their topographical situation
strongly influence the severity of their waterlogging. An extreme case is the
Willamba sand which, because of the depth of sand surface soil and its location on
slopes, is seldom waterlogged; indeed, it may be considered an excessively drained
soil in some situations. But it does contribute to the waterlogging of Unnamed
Series 1 sand which has a perched water-table standing at the surface in wet winters.
The two cases illustrate the extremes found in these soils.
(c) Sandy soils with uniform texture profiles which are liable to seasonal
drought because the water-holding capacity of the subsoil as well as the surface


soil is low—sands, skeletal soils, and sandy alluvial soils. These are all excessively
drained soils.
(■ d) Clay soils with uniform texture profiles and with high water-holding
capacity but liable to seasonal drought because the wilting point is high also —
grey and brown soils of heavy texture, rendzina, and wiesenboden. In the latter,
the position is modified by the presence of a fluctuating ground-water table.
In soils of both classes (c) and ( d ) the water regime, the root development of
plants, and the erosion hazard depend on the same physical properties that exist
in the surface soils.
(3) Liability to Erosion. —The district soils are stable under pasture and will
not erode unless pastures are overgrazed, but under arable culture the soils are
liable to erode unless their management has been designed to prevent this. More-
over, the management programme should be based on crop rotation and/or cover
cropping supported by contour tillage in the hilly portions of the area. The lack of
contour planning and planting is a failing in many of the more hilly portions of
the area. Table 5 sets out the erosion hazard under arable culture for the different
soils.
(iii) Salinity Problems
Two distinct kinds of salinity problems occur in the area.
(1) The Bethany and Kabininge Families of Solonized Brown Earths and Unnamed
Soil Series Sll of the Solodized Solonetz. —ln all the above soils the total soluble salt
contents may rise locally to 0-2-0-4 per cent, and the sodium chloride may exceed
0• 1 per cent, below 20 in. These or higher salt contents are found more frequently
in the Bethany and /Sll soils than in the Kabininge soils. Only localized salinity
problems are likely therefore and should not involve large areas. Permanent plant
cover such as subterranean clover pasture will control the position where saline
patches do develop. Because of their poor physico-chemical status, Bethany and
/Sll soils would benefit from a period of fertility and structure building by pasture
before other crops are grown.
(2) Salinity Associated with Ground Water. —ln all the complexes of soils along
the drainage-ways, especially DW?> and DWi, and in the Lyndoch family of wiesen-
boden, a ground-water table exists which fluctuates considerably with seasonal
conditions. The salt content of these waters also varies greatly with the season
and the locality. In general terms salinity is greater (1) where drainage waters
enter the valleys from the Tertiary geological formations (see Section II), as for
example in the portion of the Lyndoch valley near and to the north of the town of
Lyndoch, and (2) after (a) a very wet winter, ( b ) a wet winter following a drier than
usual season, or (c) in a drier than usual summer after a dry winter. Salts which
occurred at depth or were widespread over an area are concentrated in the upper
soil layers by 2(a) and (b) often in the lower-lying places, whereas in 2(c) it is the
concentration of salts in the ground water which increases. Hickenbotham and
Williams (1932) found salt-affected vines in the Lyndoch area and traced the damage
to saline ground water at a depth of 9-10 ft. Control of such salinity problems
involves drainage, but where this is impracticable, recourse to a permanent plant

cover is desirable. This may mean retiring affected areas from vines which do not
provide sufficient cover to prevent evaporation from the soil and thus the rise of
water and salts.
(iv) Waterlogging
Two forms of waterlogging occur in the area, (1) where a seasonal perched
water-table develops and saturates the subsurface soil as in all soils with imper-
meable subsoils and (2) where the ground-water table rises seasonally into the top
2-3 ft of the soil as in some alluvial soils. In both cases plant roots may suffer from
excessive water and lack of aeration. Vines and trees are likely to suffer some stress
under these conditions, as suggested by Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954).
Waterlogging for long periods even during the dormant stage of vines and trees may
affect their development since this dormancy is only relative (Baldwin 1956).
The most striking case of waterlogging due to ground-water table was observed
in a vineyard in the Jacob Creek area of soil complex DW 3. Here, irregular patches
of indifferent vines, some in very poor health, were related to the presence of a
non-saline ground-water table between 30 and 36 in. in depth, whereas in adjacent
patches of vigorous vines no ground-water table was encountered within the top
6 ft of soil.
IV. CLIMATIC INFLUENCES
The climate is similar to that of the other areas studied in the Barossa district.
It has cool, wet winters and hot, more or less droughty summers.
(a) Annual Rainfall
Rainfall data (Table 6) for Tanunda, Lyndoch, Williamstown, and Gawler show:
(1) A general increase in the rainfall from north to south with an increase of
about l|in. between Tanunda and Lyndoch, but about Sin. between
Lyndoch and Williamstown.
(2) The north-south increase in rainfall is accompanied by a decrease in the
number of wet days per year and thus an increase in the rainfall per wet
day, indicating generally heavier falls of rain in the Lyndoch-Williams-
town unit as compared with the Tanunda-Rowland Flat unit.
(3) A comparison of the rainfall for Lyndoch and Gawler, 9 miles to the west,
illustrates the decrease in rainfall from east to west across the area.
(4) More than 75 per cent, of the rain falls in the 7 months April to October
inclusive.
(6) The Rainfall Economy
Trumble (1948) in a study of rainfall, evaporation, and drought frequency in
South Australia showed that: the mean effective rainfall season for this area v.ries
between 7-6 months for Tanunda and 8-3 months for Williamstown; althoigh
effective rain may fall in any month of the year, the probability of this happeiing
decreases from nearly 100 per cent, in winter to less than 10 per cent, in sumner;
and the drought-year frequency, that is the percentage of years in which the seison
of continuously effective rainfall is less than 5 months, varies from 13 per cen. at
Tanunda to 6 per cent, at Williamstown.

Northcote and de Mooy (1957) made a general estimate of the rainfall economy
for vineyards and orchards and concluded that, within the limits of the method
available, an average deficit of about 5 in. of rain occurs where the annual rainfall
is about 22 in. The deficit will be less where the annual rainfall exceeds this amount,
although not necessarily in proportion. They also made a similar estimate which
showed the suitability of the Angaston and similar areas for annual pastures. This
applies equally to the Tanunda-Williamstown area.
(c) Intensity of Rainfall
Data presented by Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954) showed that 2 in. of
rain falling in a 24-hour period could be regarded as causing excessive run-off under
Rarossa conditions and that this could be expected to occur on the average once in
5 years.
(d) Temperature
Temperature conditions in the Rarossa district have been discussed by
Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954) and Northcote and de Mooy (1957), an important
feature being the low mean temperatures of less than 50°F for June, July, and
August, which means a substantial check to plant growth in those months. There-
fore, the effective growing season as distinct from the effective rainfall season is
divided into two parts, autumn and spring, with a period of but little growth between.
An analysis of the degree days above 50°F, that is, the average warmth
available for plant growth, gave an average annual summation of 2963 degree days
for Nuriootpa and 2811 degree days for an open situation at Mt. Crawford. It seems
likely, therefore, that the temperature variation over the Tanunda—Williamstown
area will not be much different to this for comparable situations. Of course, aspect
is always important, but it cannot be assessed without detailed data for each
particular site.
V. LAND USE
Although more than 100 years have elapsed since settlement began in this
district (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954), there remain several large areas which
are either underdeveloped or not developed at all. They contrast strikingly with
the scenes of intensive farming encountered in other parts of the Tanunda-
Williamstown area. Agricultural activities are mainly cropping, pastures, and
horticulture, all of which may be welded into the activity of a single farm, or each
may form the main or even sole activity of a farm. Nevertheless, there is a general
zoning of the main kinds of farming, largely related to the distribution of the soils,
as discussed below.
A stock and domestic water scheme serves portion of the district but crops
and pastures depend mainly on rainfall, supplemented by underground water from
bores and wells where practicable, for their water supply. Further development
of bores and wells in parts of this district is possible (Chugg 1955). There [is also
a limited potential for water conservation in earth dams in favoured situations.


{a) The Underdeveloped Areas
The distribution of the underdeveloped areas is closely related to the
occurrence of the solods and yellow podzolic soils, both of which have very low
levels of natural fertility. But there is no need for this to continue, as the fertility
of these soils may be greatly improved, after clearing, by what is now the almost
traditional southern Australian technique of establishing subterranean clover pasture
including annual or perennial grasses with superphosphate in which the other
necessary nutrient (trace) elements are incorporated. These are most likely to be
molybdenum, copper, and zinc on these soils (see Section 111(c)). * Good pastures
have been established on the Pewsey Vale yellow podzolic soils in the Tanunda
Creek area by this means (Northcote and de Mooy 1957).
Potassium may be required also for either the establishment or the continued
productivity of subterranean clover on areas of these soils where the small reserves
of this element (Table 2) have already been used up by vines or other crops, as in
the case of abandoned orchards on Willamba sand.
The underdeveloped areas have a considerable potential for pasture develop-
ment which will improve their fertility and allow other crops to be grown in the
future. Furthermore, vine- and apple-growing could be extended on the Barossa
yellow podzolic soils (see Section Y{d) also).
(6) Cropland
The most extensive areas of cropland in the Barossa district occur in the
Tanunda-Williamstown area and the adjoining Greenock-Gomersal area (Wells
1959) because of the presence of large units of grey and brown soils of heavy texture
which in association with various red-brown earths provide excellent soils for
cropping purposes. This is largely a reflection of the relatively stable structure of
the surface soil of grey and brown soils of heavy texture. It allows them to be
cultivated for prolonged periods without much deterioration, which is a point of
contrast with adjacent red-brown earths (Section 111(c)), in which soil erosion is
much more evident.
The main crops are cereals for hay or grain, field peas, and lucerne.
The alternation of field peas and cereals has the advantage of broadening the
rotation, which helps to maintain the fertility of surface soils. Field-pea growing
is a valuable industry in the district and Gross (1954) provides useful data for the
grower. But peas as a crop are not a good safeguard against erosion of surface soil,
because of their habit of growth when young and because of the light straw after
harvest. For these reasons, good soil structure is necessary for pea-growing. There-
fore pasture containing a legume needs to be included in the rotation on red-brown
earths and contour tillage should be used on slopes, whereas on the Tanunda and
Altona soil families the more stable structure will allow peas and cereals to be
grown without the pasture phase, at least for a considerably longer time.
* These nutrient elements are not given in order of importance, as this varies from place
to place. Those needed for a given locality may be determined by a field trial such as that of
Anderson (19526).


Where field peas are not grown and the rotation is a fairly narrow one, falloow-
cereal in some cases, erosion is a serious problem as on the Dale and Williamstoown
red-brown earths, especially in the Williamstown locality. Here, slopes of 5 per
cent, and more accentuate the problem, which needs tackling now by broadenning
the rotation to include subterranean clover pasture and introducing contour tillllage
so that water and soil will stay in place instead of flowing out onto Williamstaown
roads owing to the present up-and-down tillage (Herriot 1954). Again, owingg to
excessive cultivation, the structure of the surface soil, particularly on some anreas
of the Dale—Altona soil complex, has been completely lost and now presents a hhard
smooth surface which sheds water and thus causes the soil to be droughty. Estab-
lishment of subterranean clover pasture is necessary to reform the structural
aggregates in the soil and thus make it more receptive to water. Pasture in the
rotation will start a new upward trend in the yields of the cereal crops to folllow
(Cornish 1949).
Lucerne figures to advantage in the rotation on the Dale red-brown earthis in
the Sandy Creek—Rosedale localities. It could be used far more in the district! on
all soils with calcareous subsoils, especially those of Category I(i).
(c) Pasture
The question of pasture has been considered in some detail by North) cote
and de Mooy (1957) for the Angaston-Springton area of the Barossa district wlhich,
although much more pasture-conscious than the Tanunda-Williamstown area,, has
achieved only a fraction of the potential pasture development of which its soils
and climate are capable. This is true also of the Tanunda-Williamstown jarea,
where the few good pastures only serve to point up the poor quality of the aveerage
district pasture. It should be realized that this is a serious defect in the gerneral
agricultural economy of the district, and especially so in view of the important! role
good pasture containing clovers or medics plays in maintaining and/or restcoring
soil fertility, an aspect which has already been stressed in this report.
All the soils of the district except those which are very shallow, such aas the
rendzina, the skeletal soils, and some of the sands, are capable of growing imprroved
pasture of the subterranean clover-perennial grass (Phalaris tuberosa) Itype.
Certainly some soils such as the solods and yellow podzolics will need fertilizzation
with other nutrient elements besides superphosphate (see Section 111(c)), butt this
should not be regarded as a difficulty since standard mixtures of fertilizers are
available from the fertilizer companies (Tiver 1955). Many may be satisfied with
subterranean clover-annual grass pastures; but, while these are a big advamce on
the present “natural” and “volunteer” pastures, they do not use to the fulll the
resources of soils and climate, which can be obtained only by using perennial grass
with the clover.
Where the land is sloping and especially if the soil surface has been comp»acted
and damaged by over-cultivation, contour tillage will aid in pasture establish-
ment. Indeed, there is a general lack of contour-farming methods in the hilly portions
of the Tanunda-Williamstown area. Attention to this particular would help to
improve productivity. In conclusion it may be stressed again that pasture provides


the key to the future well-being of district agriculture through its effect on soil
structure and fertility.
( d ) Horticulture
The horticultural crops grown in the area are mainly wine-grapes, apricots,
pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, oranges, lemons, almonds, and apples, the last
more especially near Williamstown. The border-line nature of the rainfall for
summer-growing vines and trees has been mentioned in Section IV. Some growers
have been able to develop underground sources of water to provide supplementary
irrigation for fruit-trees.
An estimated 5000-6000 acres, or between 20 and 25 per cent, of the total
area, are used for horticulture. This may be compared with approximately 10,000,
2000, and less than 1000 acres used for horticulture in the Nuriootpa, Angaston—
Springton, and Greenock-Gomersal areas respectively. Thus it is the second most
intensively developed area for horticulture in the Barossa district. Moreover, further
expansion is possible throughout the area, especially in the Williamstown locality
which the higher rainfall (see Section IV) makes slightly more attractive; even
so, the most satisfactory locality for future Barossa district development is the
Tanunda Creek-Trial Hill area (Northcote and de Mooy 1957).
At present horticultural crops are concentrated in several clearly defined
localities. These are as follows:
(1) Tanunda-Bethany (i.e. the lower Tanunda Creek valley).
(2) Rowland Flat-Jacob Creek-Kabininge Creek.
(3) Lyndoch valley-Tweedie Gully.
(4) Valley of Sandy Creek.
(5) Victoria Creek valley near Williamstown.
The geographic core of each locality is a valley in which the moisture regime
may be regarded as more favourable for deep-rooting, long-lived vines and trees
than the higher locations nearby. The soils in the valleys belong to the alluvial,
brown earth, transitional red-brown earths-solonized soils, and wiesenboden soil
groups. On the adjacent slopes and rises above the creek valleys, the red-brown
earths, solodized solonetz, transitional red-brown earths-solonized soils, and to a
lesser extent solods and solodic soils are used for horticulture. Of these the red-
brown earths are the most intensively planted. Thus, apart from the wiesenboden
and alluvial soils, which occupy better than average locations so far as moisture is
concerned, the soils favoured for horticulture have coarser-textured (sand, sandy
loam, and loam) surface soils over finer-textured (clay, sandy clay, and sandy clay
loam) subsoils. This is partly a reflection of the limiting effect on summer-growing
trees and vines of moisture which comes largely from the preceding winter-spring
rainfall, and partly of the ease with which these soils may be cultivated. The clean
cultivation usually practised is so thorough that during the summer the upper
portion of the surface soil is often little better than a dust layer if loose, or a concrete
layer if compacted. This is a failing because it is this layer which contains the more
readily available nutrient elements which could be used by plants after summer


rains. The art of farming should be to produce a layer of mulch on top of the sunrface
soil to keep this cool and allow plant roots to develop and draw on its moisisture
and nutrient supplies (Jacks, Brind, and Smith 1955). There is little doubt / that
mulching of orchards and vineyards would improve their productivity. Cultivattions
should not be more frequent than is necessary to destroy weeds which comnpete
with vines and trees for moisture; otherwise, erosion and loss of surface soil ferttility
are encouraged (Northcote, Russell, and Wells 1954).
Many vineyards and orchards in the surveyed area have suffered 1 soil
deterioration through over-cultivation with a consequent decline in yield I and
quality. They need to be replanned and replanted and the experience gaineed at
the Experimental Orchard, Blackwood (Beare and Harris 1955), provides i some
valuable information. Contour design for all vineyards and orchards on slojpes is
necessary.
(i) Vines
The vine is the most important horticultural crop, since it accounts for more
than 80 per cent, of the total plantings in the Tanunda-Williamstown areai and
provides the raw material for the local wine industry. But surprisingly littlle has
been done to select good strains within the different vine varieties or to determine
the suitability of the different kinds of soils (major soil groups) for the growiing of
different varieties with the object of producing musts and wines of particular
character. The attitude which seems to expect all varieties grown on all soils to
yield quality and to crop for 60-80 years is possibly incorrect for this climate under
the current cultural system, and “rotations” may prove worthy of consideration.
Evidence collected on the survey of the Angaston-Springton area (Norfthcote
and de Mooy 1957) suggests that grapes of the Riesling variety grown on the Ptewsey
Vale yellow podzolic soils will produce quality white table wines. Therefore, it is
suggested that the suitability of the Barossa family of yellow podzolic soils would
be worth investigating for this purpose. If suitable, plantings of Rieslinjg and
perhaps other white table-wine varieties could be expanded into the area of Blarossa
yellow podzolic soils which occur in the higher-rainfall portion of the area. These
soils are largely underdeveloped at present. Naturally, attention would meed to
be given to the improvement and maintenance of the fertility of the surface soil.
Most of the vine plantings on solods are in a run-down condition, some areas
being given over to sand pits. This is due to lack of moisture and nutritional
deficiencies. Vines grown on solods face seasonal stresses of drought and/or water-
logging; besides this, their nutrient content is low and under present ciultural
methods, vines cannot be expected to grow and produce crops for long periods.
It is highly likely, for example, that the small reserves of potassium (see Sectkon III)
have been depleted to the point where it is deficient. Most old vineyard siites on
solods should be returned to subterranean clover pasture for a period before new
vineyards are planted. To do this, nutrient elements other than superphosphate
and potassium will be required (see Section 111(c)). Similarly, yellow podzollic soils
have low levels of plant nutrients and vines planted on them are likely to be short-
lived and produce indifferently unless attention is given to their nutrition..


Evidence of declining vine yields on all soil types including alluvial soils,
wiesenboden, and red-brown earths suggests that more attention should be given
to their nutrition even though this be of an apparently indirect character as when
green manure crops or subterranean clover pasture leys are used. Further con-
siderations of vines and soil conditions are given by Northcote, Russell, and Wells
(1954) and Northcote and de Mooy (1957).
(ii) Tree-fruits
Although tree-fruits account for only a small proportion of the total plantings,
they make an important contribution to the economy of the district because they
can provide immediate cash returns. Discussions of tree-fruits and soil conditions
are given for Barossa conditions by Northcote, Russell, and Wells (1954) and
Northcote and de Mooy (1957).
Red-brown earths, brown earths, and some alluvial soils are the most satis-
factory for tree-fruits, although pears and plums may be highly successful on
wiesenboden and apples seem suited to the yellow podzolic soils, even though their
plane of nutrition seems very low on such soils. But they are superior to apples
on the small local rises of solodic soils in the same area, which probably suffer more
severe moisture stress seasonally as well as the nutritional stress. With this
exception, orchards on solods, e.g. on Willamba sand, are much more difficult to
maintain in sound condition than on almost any other soil. Orchards on solods
are either very poor and have been neglected or else require continual attention
to nutrition and moisture needs. Thus in this district solods can be developed success-
fully for orchards only where water is available for supplementary irrigation.
Furthermore, the nutrient element position requires continual attention as one
element after another becomes limiting to growth and crop production; at least,
this is the experience on Willamba sand. But, of course, solods will grow tree-fruits
if moisture and nutrient needs are met.
