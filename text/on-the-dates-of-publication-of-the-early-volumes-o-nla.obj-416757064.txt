Society of New South Wales ” (September 25th, 1895).]
ON THE DATES OF PUBLICATION OF THE EARLY
VOLUMES OF THE SOCIETY’S PROCEEDINGS.
By J. 7, f f-WctW
The first twenty-eight Parts of the Society’s Proceedings—
constituting Vols. i.-vii. of the First Series (for the years 1875-
1882) offer no more definite indication of the several dates of
publication than is afforded by a notice of the year of issue at
the foot of the front page of the paper covers, or on the title-
page included in the fourth and concluding Part of each Volume.
Unless specially instructed to the contrary, bookbinders seem
habitually to discard the covers when binding. A number of
copies of Vols. i.-iv., bound at Sir W. Macleay’s expense, so treated,
have passed into circulation under the Society’s auspices. In
regard to these, and others so dealt with, it should be borne in
mind that the year indicated on the title-page is usually that in
which the fourth and last Part only of the Volume was issued :
or if not so, the coincidence is accidental.
The first twenty-six of the Parts in question were issued prior
to the Garden Palace Fire. As the Society’s official books and
records were completely destroyed therein, no information what-
ever about these early Parts is forthcoming from this source.
Eleven consecutive Parts commencing with Part 2 of Vol. i., were
printed by two firms which subsequently retired altogether from
business, the establishment of one of them having been completely
burnt out; so that no particulars from the publishers are obtainable,
and I have only the dates of receipt kindly supplied by the
Librarians of the Public Library and Royal Society of N. S.
Wales to go by.
Occasionally there arise questions of priority in the description
of species dealt with in these Volumes; and requests for authori-
tative information as to dates of publication are from time to
time received.


It seemed advisable, therefore, that the effort should be made,
once for all, to ascertain if possible the dates of publication of the
first twenty-six Parts with a view to their publication. On
applying to the Librarians of the Public Library, Sydney, and
the Royal Society of New South Wales, I was most kindly
furnished with almost complete lists of the dates of their receipt
of the various Parts—which are approximately those of publica-
tion. Messrs. F. Cunninghame & Co., who printed Part 1, very
obligingly referred to their books, and supplied the requisite
information about this Part. Mr. F. White, who printed Yols.
iv.-vii., most courteously provided me with a list of the dates of
delivery to the Society of the sixteen Parts comprised in these
Volumes. From the data so supplied, the list—as approximately
correct as it is now possible to make it—given overleaf has been
compiled.
One or two other matters may also be noted.
The first Volume is exceptional in that it comprises the Pro-
ceedings of two years —Part 1 constitutes the Proceedings for
1875: Parts 2-4 the Proceedings for 1876. In the separate
copies of Part 1 as issued, was inserted a slip—which is missing
in all the bound Volumes I have seen—setting forth that—-
“ The first 20 pages of this Part were printed and circidated ten
months ago. They have now been re-prinled in order to make the
Part complete
The sixteen consecutive Parts, commencing with Vol. viii., and
ending with Vol. i. (Second Series), have the dates of issue on
the paper covers, but there only. If the covers have not been
preserved in binding all clue to dates is lost in bound volumes.
They are accordingly included in the list.
Commencing with Vol. ii. (Second Series), not only is the date
given on the cover of each Part, but it is repeated at the head
of the lists of the Contents of the four Parts comprised in each
Volume, supplied along with the title-page and Index in the
concluding Part thereof. No room for doubt, therefore, can arise
in connection with these and future Parts :
