When they got to the guay
where the ferry boats were
Richard bought some fruit, and
M ummy bought the tickets
to the Zoo.




What a surprise it was when
Daddy hurried on to the
wharf, just as the gangway
was put down.




They had lunch at the
Zoo. and the birds came
for crumbs.




Richard and Daddy stood
quite close to the man
while he fed the pelican
with fish, then they went to
see the monkeys.




Some of the monkeys were
running and jumping and
swinging, swinging, running and
jumping having such fun,
and some of the monkeys
were Just eating and blinking
their little round eyes.
A funny little monkey
stopped eating his banana
while he stared at Susan and
Richard ,




Richard and Susan ran
along the path where they
saw two little penquins
standing close to the wall.
Quite suddenly one penguin
opened his bill and called
aha-a-a-a-a- ahe-e-e-e, then
dived into the pool, and
using his two little wings,
swam away.

Susan liked looking at the
fish. Richard liked looking at
the fish too. but they did so
want to see who was living
in the big rocky house
next door.




It was brown bear. Susan
thought he was one of The
Three Bears. He came
treading softjy, sat down on
a little ledge, looked up, flung
wide his paws, and then
gently patted one over the
other and nodded. Richard
said Somebody has been
i n
tasting my porridge 7

It was time to go home, so
they hurried on to the
wharf to catch their boat.




They had had a happy
day, and got ready for bed.




Will you please put their
bed clothes over them, and
see if their window is open ?




A little young moon came
up over the church and
over the houses, and
Susan and Richard were
fast asleep.
