1. HYMN
THE fields are all white,
And the reapers are few;
We children are willing,
Eut what can we do
To work for our Lord in His harvest ?
Our hands are so small,
And our words are so weak
We cannot teach others;
How then shall we seek
To work for our Lord in His harvest ?

7. PSALM 103- Chant Tune 117—
OThou my soul, bless God th
Lord ;
and all that in me is
Be stirred up His holy Name
to magnify and bless.
Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,
and not forgetful be
Of all his gracious benefits
He hath bestowed on thee.
Lord’s Prayer and Benediction
The Children of the Sabbath School
We’ll work by our prayers,
By the offerings we bring,
By small self denials ;
The least little thing
May work for our Lord in His harvest
Until by and by,
As the years pass'at length
We too may be reapers
And go forth in strength
To work for our Lord in his harvest

All thine iniquities who doth
most graciously forgive:
Who thy diseases all and pains
doth heal, and thee relieve.
Who doth redeem thy life, that thou
to death may’st not go down;
Who thee with loving kindness
doth,
and tender mercies crown.
