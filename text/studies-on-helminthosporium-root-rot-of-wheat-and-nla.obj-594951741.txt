PART 3t.—FACTORS INFLUENCING INFECTION.
INTRODUCTION.
During the past eighteen years, considerable attention has been given in
different countries to a study of the factors concerned in infection of cereal
plants by root-rotting fungi. Up to about 1919, little intensive work had
been undertaken on the problem, although the importance of various soil-
inhabiting fungi in diminishing wheat yields was fully realised by several
workers. Cordley ( 20 ), in 1902, reported the first definite root-rot disease
of wheat, with which a fungus was associated, and in 1912 and 1913 Bolley
(7) pointed out that continuous cropping of land with wheat resulted
in the development of wheat-sick soil due to the accumulation of several
different fungi, including Alternaria, Collet otrichwm , Fusarium and
Helminth osporium.
Although Beckwith (') and Bolley reported that Helminihosporium was
a destructive parasite of wheat roots, it remained according to McKinney
(“) an( l Drechsler ("') — for Johnson Oto he the first to demonstrate in
1914 that H. sativum was pathogenic to wheat. It is of interest to note
here that Hehninthosporium was first isolated from root-rot affected wheat
in Australia in 1913 by Mr. W. A. Birmingham of the New South Wales
Department of Agriculture, the material being obtained from the Bathurst
district
In 1920, Stakman ( 81 ) proved that a species of Helminthosporium, ap-
parently IT. sativum, was capable of causing seedling blight and root-rot in
wheat and rye in addition to spot blotch of barley; pathogenicity on various
grasses was also demonstrated. Ihe subsequent work of ( hristensen ( , ),
Hamblin ( 33 , 41 ), Stevens O, Henry O and others amply demonstrated the
parasitic capabilities of 11. sativum on roots of various cereals and grasses.
The first extensive paper dealing with factors affecting infection by this
species was that published by Dosdall ( ) in 1923, and since that time im-
portant contributions to the subject have been made principally by Christen-
sen (”, 18 ), McKinney ('"), Henry C% Broadfoot 12 ), Machacek
* Received for publication 3rd Januray, 1938.
t Parts 1 and 2 were published as Science Bulletin No. 47 (March, 1935). These studies constitute two
of five papers on cereal root-rot diseases submitted to the University of Sydney in fulfilment of the
requirements for the degree of Doctor of Science in Agriculture. The third paper, Studies n
Rhizoctonia Root-rot of Wheat and Oats,” was published as Science Bulletin No. j 8 (May, 1937).


c 5 ) and Mead ( C1 ). The effects on disease development of soil moisture, soil
temperature, soil fertility, soil type, time of planting, presence or absence
of other micro-organisms, and certain other factors have in turn been in-
vestigated, but the problem still remained unsolved. The complex nature
of the soil environment, the variability of the parasite which comprises
numerous strains of varying infective capacity and which may and does
saltate with frequency under certain conditions, resulting often in changed
virulence, the different degrees of susceptibility of the host at different
stages of growth and under different sets of conditions, have all contributed
to the difficulty experienced by root-rot investigators in defining precisely
the factors concerned in infection.
A study of the literature shows that the factors governing the occur-
rence of pre-emergence and seedling blight in wheat, through invasion
by II. sativum, are more clearly understood than are those governing disease
development in adult plants. The planting of wheat in inoculated soil
under either field or glasshouse conditions usually results in an appreciable
reduction in emergence, hut the extent to which surviving plants will de-
velop root-rot symptoms at the ear-peeping stage or just prior to maturity
has not been clearly defined by any investigator for particular sets of con-
ditions. In fact, no work has yet been published in which experiments on
factors, governing root-rot development in adult wheat plants in a con-
trolled environment, are described.
Reference has already been made O to the fact that under Australian
conditions Ophioholus graminis is both more important and more virulent
on wheat than II. sativum, and it is of interest to note that Broadfoot (’"),
working in Canada, observed O. graminis to be much more virulent than
not only II. sativum but also Fusarium culmorum and Leptosphaeria herpo-
trichoides. But since //. sativum is widely distributed in the wheat grow-
ing areas of New South Wales and has long been regarded as a factor of
importance in the causation of cereal root-rots in this State, it was decided
to investigate more closely the activity of this pathogen under different en-
vironmental conditions. Special attention was given to a study of factors
influencing disease development in the adult plant stag’e—the most impor-
tant phase of the disease. Extensive field surveys indicated that certain
factors were of special significance in the development of epidemics, and
these were given special attention under controlled glasshouse conditions
over several years. The nature of the work also demanded tests in field
plots, and these likewise were conducted over several seasons. Factors
concerned in infection by Helminthosporium M. ( Gurvularia rarnosa) ( 44 )
were also investigated, and special attention was given to the effects resulting
from soil inoculation with two or more parasitic organisms in combination
under different sets of conditions. The work is described in the following
pages.


THE SEEDLING BLIGHT PHASE.
(a) Effect of Soil Moisture.
The first experiments dealing with the influence of soil moisture on
infection of wheat and barley seedlings by 11. savitum were those conducted
by Dosdall ( 24 ) and McKinney ( SS ), and since the publication of their papers
in 1923 no further work in this connection appears to have been published.
In a series of tests conducted in sterilised soil under glasshouse condi-
tions, Dosdall found that the percentage and severity of infection in barley
seedlings, as determined by plant growth, increased as the amount of soil
moisture was increased. The results also indicated that seedling barley-
plants suffer most from root infection in soils containing maximum or mini-
mum extremes of moisture. She further states, “when conditions are more
nearly favourable for the optimum growth of the plants, the effect of the
disease can be overcome, and root systems are developed in inoculated soil
almost equal in extent to those in clean soil.”
McKinney’s work was of a more comprehensive nature, and dealt with
the effect of both moisture and temperature on seedling blight in wheal,
under controlled conditions. He found that high soil temperatures, 28 deg.
to 32 deg. Cent., and high soil moisture content, 55 to 65 per cent, water-
holding capacity, favoured infection. The optimum temperature varied
for different varieties. The results of a combined soil-temperature and
moisture experiment showed that the temperature optimum was fairly stable,
when soil moisture content was varied, but when temperature was varied
the moisture optimum seemed to change. When the soil temperature was
high, high soil moisture content was most favourable for infection, while
at low temperatures parasitic attack was greater at lower soil moistures.
Hence the temperatures at and above 24 deg. Cent, favoured a high mois-
ture optimum, whereas temperatures below 24 deg. Cent, appeared to favour
low moisture optima. Extremely low soil moistures were not favourable to
infection at any temperature, and at extremely high and low temperatures
the moisture curves for infection were irregular. Alternating the soil
temperatures gave the same results in infection as when a constant tempera-
ture equivalent to the mean of the fluctuating temperature was employed.
No work on the soil moisture relationship with Australian forms of the
fungus has so far been published. Experiments in this connection were
initiated by the writer in 1931 and continued in 1932 and 1933, the work
being conducted under glasshouse conditions during June and July. Tho
moisture relationship was also investigated for infection by other root-
rotting fungi, singly and in various combinations Avith 11. sativum. A
further test in 1934 was conducted under outdoor conditions to determine
the role of a number of organisms, singly and in combination, in infection
of Avheat seedlings, without regard to the moisture factor. Owing to lack
of facilities, it Avas not possible to control the temperature in any of the
experiments. The details of procedure and results are as folloAv:

conducted in 1932. Ten-inch galvanised containers were used in all cases.
Following inoculation and sowing of grain, the soil in the containers was
adjusted to 30 per cent., (10 per cent., or 65 per cent, of its water-holding
capacity, as required, the preliminary and subsequent additions of wate>.'
being made through glass tubes inserted in the soil, which permitted the
delivery of water at the base of the containers. The prevailing qool con
ditions necessitated weighings and additions of water only thrice weekly.
Inoculum for the 1931 tests consisted of a culture of 11. savitum growing
on sterilised oats —a method extensively used by root-rot investigators and
found to be very effective ( 70 ) —and 250 c.c. of this material were mixed
with the top two inches of soil in each inoculated container prior to the
sowing of 18 grains of Nabawa wheat; in the 1932 tests, inoculum con-
sisted of spores and mycelium of 11. savitum scraped from agar cultures,
the 25 grains for each container being also dusted with spores prior to
sowing. Seed was sown about 1J inches deep, and the surface of soil in
all inoculated containers was covered with a thin layer of clean soil to
prevent dissemination of spores to the control series in which sterilised oats
were incorporated. All tests were replicated six times, and were termi-
nated five weeks after sowing. The extent of loss through pre-emergence
blight is indicated from the summary of emergence data presented in Table
1.
Table 1. —Average percentage emergence of wheat sown in soil,* uninoculated
and inoculated with Helminthosporium. sativum, and maintained at high
and low moisture contents under glasshouse conditions.
The experiments showed that pre-emergence blight from parasitic inva-
sion was pronounced in soil maintained alike at high- and low-moisture
content; that emergence of seedlings above the soil level in both moisture
series was slower and more irregular in inoculated soil than in uninocu-
lated soil; and that infected seedlings were noticeably stunted, the leaves
being narrower and of darker green colour than the controls. It appeared,
in general, that these features were more marked in the series maintained
at the high moisture content than in those kept at 30 per cent. W.H.C.
* In the 1931 tests, unsterilised garden loam was used; in the 1932 tests, sterilised clay loam.


A striking feature of seedling blight tests with H. savitum is the fact that
in most instances the severe effect of the pathogen is manifested principally
in pre-emergence blight, and that the seedlings which actually emerge above
the soil line usually continue to develop and often do not exhibit any appre
ciable amount of stunting. This may be explained by the manner in which
wheat roots are protected against a decorticating fungus. Henry ( )
studied the pathological histology of seminal roots attacked by different
fungi, and in the case of Helminthosporium observed that the stele was
intact and free from mycelium, while the cortex was riddled with hyphae;
that the mycelium had penetrated to, but not beyond the endodermis.
With Fusarium, however, it Avas observed that the central cylinder had
been invaded —the most serious form of injury. Cortical injury, if exten-
sive, would prove serious but often the attack is localised; eA’en when the
rot is extensive, however, the functions of the water-conducting tissues
are not necessarily disturbed. Apparently the closely-packed cells of the
endodermis and their thickened inner Avails constitute a barrier against
entry of some fungi into the central cylinder. From numerous observations
by the AA'riter, it is quite eA’ident that the seedling 1 stage is critical from
the standpoint of root diseases, as the primary roots are particularly sus-
ceptible to injury, whereas the secondary roots do not appear to be so read-
ily attacked.
Tests in 1933. —Sterilised Avheat soil of a Avater-holding capacity of 35
per cent. AA T as used, and one series of tests was conducted in 10-inch gal-
vanised-iron containers (Series A), another in 7-inch garden pots (Series
B). The soil-moisture content was adjusted to 30 or 00 per cent, of the
water-holding capacity as lequired, additions of moisture being made
thrice Aveekly by applying Avater to the surface of the soil by means of a
pipe Avith “rose” attachment. The experiment was designed to determine
the effect of high and loav moisture-contents on seedling blight as caused
by a number of root-rotting fungi, singly and in various combinations.
The organisms used A\ T ere Helminthosporium M., 11. sativum , Fusarium
sp. Ophioholus pram in is, and Penicillium sp. Each fungus was propa-
gated on sterilised oats, and the various cultures Avere used for inoculation
when five A\ r eeks old. For each of the galvanised iron containers 2.>0 c.c.
of inoculum, as used in the 1931 tests, Avere mixed AA'ith the top tA\o inches
of soil, 80 c.c. in the case of the pot tests; Avhere tAvo organisms were used
in the same container, the total quantity of inoculum incorporated Avas,
therefore, double of that used in cases Avhere only one organism was under
test, treble in cases where three fungi were employed, and so on. In each
10-inch container, 75 grains of Nabawa Avheat Avere sown, 50 grains in
each of the 7-inch pots; seed Avas sown about 1 i inches deep and the sur-
face of soil in each inoculated container covered with a thin layer of clean
soil to prevent spore dissemination. 1 o the controls of each series sterilised
oats Avere added in amounts corresponding Avith those used in the inocu-
lated series. Each set of experiments was conducted in duplicate and Avas
terminated three Aveeks after sovving.

lablk 2 —Average percentage emergence and height of wheat seedlings in
sterilised soil, uninoculated and inoculated with various root-rotting
tungi—singly and in various combinations—and maintained at high
and low moisture contents under glasshouse conditions (1933).
I he results presented in Table 2 show that with all organisms tested in
both series of experiments the amount of pre-emergence blight was greater
under conditions of high soil moisture, but that the difference in amount
of blighting at 60 per cent. W.H.C. and 30 per cent. W.H.C. varied con-
siderably for individual organisms and for combinations of them. From
the graphic presentation of the results for Series A in Fig. 1, it is clear
that under conditions of low soil moisture Helminthosporium M. was more
virulent than either 11. sativum or Fusarium sp., the last-named being of
no importance pathogenically. It is also evident that Helminthosporium,
M. and H. sativum acting together produced more severe effects than when
acting alone; that while Fusarium sp. intensified the activity of JI
sativum when associated with it, and reduced the severity of Helminthos-
porium M., yet when the three fungi concerned were brought together it

f This isolate was of known low virulence.


appeared that the essentially weak parasite ( Fusarium ) stimulated the
activity of the other two organisms, with the result that the germination
of wheat was reduced to an extent greater than in any other instance in
the low-moisture series.
Fig. 1.
Fig. 2.
Average percentage emergence of wheat in pots of soil inoculated

(cf. Table 2.) Abbrevations: Hel. sat.= Helminthosporium sativum ;
Hel.M.= Helminthosporium M.; Fus . = Fusarium sp.; Oph. gr. =
Ophictolus graminis ; Penic. = Penicillium sp).
These results are explained on the known fact ( ,s ) that while the pro-
ducts of metabolism of a certain organism might be inhibitory to the para-
sitic activity of another, they intensify the parasitism of yet another. The
association effect may be due to changes in acidity, but the fact that little
information is available concerning the basic influence of one organism
on another is significant of the complexity involved in attempting to prove


that the result of the interaction is due to one particular factor, and no-
other. The severe damage occasioned by the three fungi acting together
is considered to be due to this association, and not to quantity of inoculum,
as explained later. Nor could additional food supply be a factor, as the
oat medium used for propagation of inoculum was thoroughly permeated
by the fungus at the time of transfer to the soil.
In the high-moisture series it is again evident that Helminthosporium
M. was more virulent than either 11. sativum or Fusarium sp., but the last-
named, in this instance, showed appreciable virulence. Most severe effects
occurred when the organisms were paired in various combinations or were
all associated together in the one container of soil. The marked virulence
of certain isolates of Helminthosporium M. has already been stressed in a
paper by the writer ( 4:i ).
From the data on average height, set out in Table 2, it is apparent that
in both wet and dry series greater stunting occurred in seedlings growing
in soil inoculated with two or three organisms than in cases where only
one organism was used. It is also evident that reduction in height was
more marked in the 60 per cent. W.H.C. series than in those maintained
at 30 per cent. W.H.C.
Examining the data for Series B ( cf . Table 2 and Fig. 2) it is evident
that 11. sativum was much more virulent than 0. graminis, but the latter
was known to be of low pathogenicity. However, when associated together,
the extent of pre-emergence blight attributable to 11. sativum was notice-
ably reduced, indicating the antagonistic effect of the weak associate, 0.
graminis. Ihe most severe damage at both high and low moisture-contents
occurred when 11. sativum, 0. graminis, Fusarium sp. and Penicillium sp.
were all operating together in the same soil-container, a result which is
much in accord with that already noted for Series A, where three distinct
organisms were involved in the development of severe blighting at the low
soil-moisture content.

As is indicated in Figs. 3 and 4, the most severe effects in respect of plant
growth in Series B occurred in the low moisture set where all four organisms
were used together. While in the high moisture set pre-emergence blight
was somewhat greater than in the low moisture set, the growth of surviv-
ing seedlings was more vigorous under the moist conditions. In both
moisture sets, the plants were very slow to emerge above the soil level
and at the termination of the experiment were markedly stunted,
particularly in the dry series.
It is important to stress here the fact that the strain of 0. graminis used
in these tests was one of marked low virulence and was not by any means
representative in its action of that of most isolates of this fungus. Ihe
writer has already drawn attention to the higher virulence of 0. graminis
when compared with 11. sativum C), but the varying degrees of patho-
genicity exhibited by different strains is recognised for numerous fungi.
Kobertson ( 7 °) observed that 0. graminis caused much more serious injury
to wheat culms and roots than F. culmorum or H. sativum, and that appa-
rently 0. graminis was the only fungus of the three that could penetrate
the crown and the endodermis of the roots.
The results presented for the three-year period show that while Ilelmin-
thosporium M. and 11. sativum are each capable of causing considerable
damage to wheat through pre-emergence blight under conditions of high
or low soil-moisture content —being greater when soil is very wet the
amount of injury produced when associated with other fungi may be inten-
sified or reduced according to the nature of the additional organism con-
cerned, and it would appear that the intensifying effect of an associated
fungus under one set of moisture conditions may be converted to a reduc-
ing effect when the soil-moisture content is materially changed. This
might be explained on the basis of altered conditions of aeration, acidity
or other factors consequent upon the change in moisture content, but the
real explanation is obscure. While temperature ( M ), acidity ( ST , s ) and
nature of substrate (”) have been shown to be of importance in synergy
of certain organisms, very little other data are available in this connection^

but it is generally accepted that changes in environmental conditions may
transform compatibility between two organisms into an antagonistic rela-
tionship. When, however, the soil contains a number of organisms in
association—some strongly parasitic, others weakly parasitic—the extent
of injury from pre-emergence blight may be expected to be greater at
either high or low soil-moisture contents than when the strongly parasitic
organisms are acting singly under the same conditions in respect of soil
moisture. This is apparent from the data presented above.
Tests in 1934.— 1 n order further to test out the role of various fungi in
causing seedling and pre-emergence blight in wheat, when acting singly
and m combination, an experiment was conducted in 8-inch pots under
outdoor c ,°. ndltlons ; Sterilised soil was employed, and Helminthosporium
j. 1., H. sativum and F. culmorum were used singly and in various combina-
tions tor the inoculations. Approximately 100 c.c. of inoculum, consisting
o± the fungus propagated on sterilised oats, were mixed with the top three
inches of soil in each inoculated pot, but double that quantity was used
Avhen two organisms were employed, treble the quantity when three were
used. Fifty grains of Nabawa wheat were sown per pot at a depth of 11
inches, and sterilised soil was added to the surface in each case. No steri-
lised oats were added to the control series. All pots were placed outdoors
m the soil to their own depth and kept moist throughout. The experiment
was conducted with seven replications and was terminated eight weeks
after solving.
Table 3. Summary of results of an outdoor pot experiment* (1934) to
determine the effect of Helminthosporium M., 11. sativum and Fusarium
- culmorum —singly and in various combinations—on emergence and
seedling development in wheat, using sterilised soil.
Froin the results presented in Table 3 it is again evident that Helmin-
Ihosponum M. and 11. sativum are both very active agents in causing
pre-emergence blight in wheat and are much more virulent than F. cul-
morum. Somewhat more severe effects were obtained in this experiment
wien Helminthosporium M. and If. sativum or F. culmorum and H. sati-
vum were combined, while the greatest amount of pre-emergence blight
resulted when the three organisms were inoculated into the soil together.
1 he data on relative vigour of surviving seedlings also show that when
the fungi were inoculated in pairs greater degrees of stunting occurred
than when each organism was used alone, and that greatest reduction in
vigour was shown by those plants growing in soil inoculated with all three
fungi. I hese results are more clearly defined in Figs. 5 and 6.

discussed at a later stage.

studies where two or three organisms are used, singly and in various combi-
nations, as employed in the tests discussed above, has also been used by other
workers ("’, ,x ). But with this method, the actual increase in total supply of
inoculum may be a factor of importance, although where comparatively
large quantities are used for tests with a single pathogen it is questionable
whether further increases would be of much account, so that the question of
quantity of inoculum in cases where two or three fungi are combined may
not be of great moment. But further work is necessary in this connection.
A preliminary experiment designed to ascertain whether the intensifying
effect of Helminthosporium M., 11. sativum and F. culmorum, acting toge-
ther, could be explained purely on association effects, irrespective of
quantity of inoculum, was conducted in sterilised soil under glasshouse
conditions. Where each pathogen was used singly, 45 c.c. of inoculum (fungus
on sterilised oats) were applied to each pot; where the three organisms were
combined, only 15 c.c. of inoculum for each pathogen were incorporated. The
experiment was of a preliminary nature, and while no definite conclusions
could be drawn from it, the results did indicate that the intensifying effect
of organisms in combination was a direct result of this association and
was not due to quantity of inoculum. This idea is rather supported by recent
Canadian work C").
(b) Effect of Temperature.
, A number of worker ( 24 , ', M , **) have investigated the influence of tem-
perature on infection of wheat seedlings by Helminthosporium spp. Refer-
ence has already been made to the studies of McKinney ( r,N ) in this connec-
tion. In studying the effect of temperature on 11. sativum infection in wheat
and barley in test tubes, Dosdall ( 2J ) found that infection took place to
some extent through a fairly wide range of temperature, 6° to 34°C., but
that a narrower range, probably 22° to 30°, was necessary for severe de-
velopment of the disease. She considered that to some extent moisture,
as well as temperature, was the limiting factor at the extremes. Mitra O
observed that infection by 11. sativum in wheat and barley was intensified
as the temperature was raised from 20° to 30°C. In connection with
Helminthosporium M., Henry after determining that the minimum,
optimum and maximum temperatures for growth on potato dextrose agar
were 6.5° —B°C., 29°—31.5°C., and 36° —37°C., respectively, studied the
relation of soil temperature to infection of wheat seedlings' and found that
the greatest injury occurred at the temperatures nearest the optimum for
growth of the fungus, viz., 30°C.
It is evident, then, that soil temperature is a factor of importance in the
development of seedling blight in wheat as caused by Helminthosporium and
other root-rotting fungi. It is also clear that so far as this particular aspect
under Australian conditions is concerned, very little information has been
made available in published work ( 42 ). It was therefore decided to investi-
gate the role of temperature in relation to seedling blight of wheat caused
by 11. sativum, and as no special equipment was available for conduct of
the work under strictly controlled conditions the tests were conducted in
the field, so that the effect of temperature could be assessed on a basis of
time of planting—a method adopted by other workers. The experiments were
carried out at the Cowra Experiment Farm over the three-year period.


1928-1930, and tlie results were correlated with temperature as recorded by
the maximum and minimum thermometer. It was felt that this method of
procedure would give a fairly reliable index as to the importance of the
temperature factor, and while necessarily the limits could not be defined,
yet the results would be of value in presenting a fairly true picture of the
situation as it occurred under field conditions and as it had not hitherto
been presented for any part of Australia.
No data appear to have been published on the correlation of air tempera-
tures with soil temperatures under Australian conditions. However, daily
temperatures taken during June and July, 1930, at Cowra Experiment
Farm, showed that in a cultivated field free of vegetation the temperature
on the soil surface at 8 a.m. was usually the same as or no more than I—l§1 — 1§
degrees Centigrade higher than that at two inches below the surface; at
12 noon was always appreciably higher—sometimes by 10 or 12 degrees; and
at 5 p.m. was usually lower by 2 —3 degrees. But it is not possible to make
any generalisations from these observations which extended over a very
short period and only under one set of field conditions. Kimball et al ( 4 )
working in Southern Ontario, found that over a two-year period the average
monthly air temperature was always lower than that at a depth of four
inches in a light sandy soil, although the difference was usually relatively
small.
In each year of test, 10 to 12 varieties each of early, mid-season and late-
maturity were planted at the correct sowing period in adjacent plots, seven
feet long and replicated three times. Each plot consisted of three rows,
spaced nine inches apart, and 30 grains were sown in each row at a depth
of approximately II inches. Control plots were of two types: those in
which grain alone was planted (Control 1) and those where sterilised oats
at the rate of approximately 100 c.c. per row were added after placing the
grain (Control 2). In the inoculated plots a similar quantity of inoculum
(prepared by culturing H. sativum on sterilised oats in flasks) was added
at the time of planting.
Emergence counts were made in each row and the figures subjected to
statistical analysis. It should here be pointed out that the use of the par-
ticular method of analysis adopted was rendered possible by regarding each
of the varieties under test at the one planting as equally susceptible to
attack by H. sativum in the seedling stage, thus allowing of the experi-
ment to be considered as replicated. The results of numerous tests con-
ducted by the writer and other investigators justified this line of pro-
cedure; and it may be stated that small-scale time of planting tests in
which representative varieties of the three maturity classes each were
planted not only on their correct sowing dates but also at subsequent
periods, gave emergence results similar to those recorded for control and
inoculated plots in the large-scale experiments described below.
It is to be noted, also, that the figures for the three rows of each plot
in the tests under consideration were summed, so that for purposes of
analysis there were three adjacent plots to each variety.
Before subjecting the data to analysis it was of interest to determine
whether there was any significant difference between the emergence figures
for Control 1 and Control 2. A study of the results for the 1928 season
was therefore made by using “Student’s” method. It was found that in
the case of each of the early maturing, mid-season maturing and late
t 68791—8


maturing groups, the difference between the figures for Control 1 and Con-
trol 2 was not significant. This result is of interest in view of Sallans’
work 0°), which showed that the addition of sterile medium—oat hulls—
to unsterilised soil resulted in non-emergence and other injury to wheat,
caused no douht by the soil fungi and bacteria which grew rapidly on the
sterile medium and which injured the seedlings directly or by the pro-
duction of toxic substances. I his phenomenon has also been discussed
by the writer (*) in connection with other tests in which sterilised oats
were added to soil under field conditions.
It is quite probable that under other sets of circumstances the differ-
ence in emergence for Control 1 and Control 2 plots would have been
significant, but in determining the amount of pre-emergence blight for
inoculated and uninoculated plots in the 1928-1930 tests, it was decided
to analyse only the results for the Control 2 and inoculated plots in each
year of test, as the incorporation of sterilised oats was considered to pro-
vide a truer type of control.
In each case, the significance of the mean difference between control and
inoculated plots was tested by ‘“Student’s” method, and the variance between
early, late and mid-season plantings compared. When no difference in
variance existed between the three plantings, the data were grouped and
examined by Fisher’s Analysis of Variance method (-“).
The lesults for 1928 showed that the mean reduction in emergence as a
result of inoculation Avas significant in each of the three plantings, and,
expressed as a percentage, was as follows:
1. For early maturing \ r arieties, 14.7.
2. For mid-season maturing varieties, 5.7.
3. For late maturing A'arieties, 29.2.
Difference for significance = 3.5 per cent.
Ihe reduction in emergence was significantly greater in the late matur-
ing than in the early maturing varieties, and in the early maturing than
in the mid-season maturing varieties.
In the case of the data for 1929, the analysis showed that the mean re-
duction in emergence as a result of inoculation, expressed as a percentage,
was as follows:
1. For early maturing varieties, 1.9 (not significant).
2. For mid-season maturing varieties, (5.0.
3. lor late maturing varieties, 14.8.
Difference for significance = 5.6 per cent.
The reduction in emergence Avas significantly greater in the late matur-
ing than in the mid-season maturing varieties.
Ihe results for 1900 shoAA’ed that the mean reduction in emerg’ence fol-
lowing inoculation Avas significant in each of the three plantings, and, ex-
pressed as a percentage, Avas as folloAvs:—
1. For early maturing varieties, 6.6.
2. For mid-season maturing A r arieties, 7.8.
3. For late maturing A’arieties, 11.6.
Difference for significance = 3.4 per cent.

The reduction in emergence was significantly greater in the late matur-
ing than in either the mid-season or early maturing varieties. The differ-
ence between early and mid-season varieties was not significant.
Summarising the results for the three-year period, it is clear that appre-
ciable reduction in emergence occurred each year in the inoculated plots
of early, mid-season and late maturing varieties planted at their correct
sowing periods, with the exception that the difference between control and
inoculated plots of early maturing varieties in 1929 was not significant,
a result which is doubtless attributable to the low temperatures (lower
Table 4. —Data on air temperatures and soil moisture at Cowra, New South
Wales, during the early period of each of the wheat seedling blight
(.Helminthosporium sativum) tests conducted in 1928-1930 and described
in the accompanying pages.
than any recorded for fortnightly periods during 1928-1900 — cf. Table 4)
occurring during the two weeks following planting. It is also clear that in
each year of test the greatest reduction in emergence occurred when wheat
was sown early, i.e., in the late maturing varieties sown at the end of April
or the begining of May. The fact that in the early maturing and mid-
season maturing varieties, the reduction in emergence was not always
significantly greater when the thermometer readings were higher indicates
that in certain instances some factor other than temperature is more im-
portant. No reliable conclusions can be drawn from the data in respect of
rainfall presented in Table 4.
The method of estimating the influence of temperature on infection of
wheat by 11. sativum through varying the dates of seeding has been adop-
ted by a number of workers in other countries. Christensen ( ,c ) stated:
“that sowing grain late in the spring (i.e., at Minnesota, TJ.S.A.) favours
the development of root-rots, is indicated by the fact that the optimum
temperature for the pathogen is relatively high. "Therefore, if susceptible
grains are grown, they should be sown as early as possible in the spring.”
McKinney ( uS ), working at Wisconsin, I .S.A., found that there was agree-
ment between the infection results with 11. sativum obtained under con-
trolled moisture-temperature conditions in the glasshouse, and those

obtained by varying the time of planting in the field. Thus winter wheat
sown early in the autumn was more severely affected by the disease than
late-sown winter wheat—higher temperatures operating in the case of the
former. Sallans (") observed that seedling blight caused by H. sativum was
more severe when wheat was planted on May 22 and June 12 (warmer
weather) than when sown on May 1 (weather cooler), and established
a direct correlation between soil temperatures at dates of planting and
the amount of damage due to infection.
Dickson ( 21 ) showed that seedlings of spring and winter wheat and corn
develop most vigorously and most uniformly at the following soil tempera-
tures : spring wheat, 16 deg - , to 20 deg. Cent.; winter wheat, 12 deg. to
16 deg. Cent.; and corn 24 deg. to 28 deg. Cent. Since infection by Gib-
berella saubinetii was more severe on wheat at higher temperatures and
on corn at lower temperatures, he concluded that the parasite was capable
of causing most damage when both hosts were subjected to unfavourable
environmental conditions. And this generalisation would apply also to
infection of wheat seedlings by 11. sativum which has a temperature opti-
mum for growth similar to that of G. saubinetii (24 deg. to 28 deg. Cent.).
(c) Effect of Soil Moisture and Air Temperature on Foot-rot Development
in Wheat Seedlings, as Caused by Selected Isolates of Helminthosporium
M. and H. sativum.
It lias already been pointed out O that the colony diameter on agar
media of physiologic forms of 11. sativum is usually greater at 25 deg.
than at 15 deg. Cent., but that in the writer’s growth rate studies there
ivere certain isolates which did not exhibit greater colony diameter at 25
deg., and Avhicli, in pathogenicity tests, proved to lie of low virulence; the
data in connection with these particular isolates are presented in sum-
marised form in Table 5.

Further, it was considered that the temperatures obtaining during the
conduct of the inoculation tests may have been too high for infection by
these particular isolates, and that the growth rate data indicated tha». the
optimum temperature for disease development may he lower than that
usually regarded as being particularly favourable to infection, viz., 25
deg. to 30 deg. Cent.
Table 6. —;Colony diameters (mm.) of two selected isolates of Helrninthos-
porium sativum growing on potato dextrose agar at various temperatures.
The colony diameter studies of certain of these isolates —Nos. 13 and 678
—were repeated on a larger scale, using 24 c.c. of potato dextrose agar per
four-inch petri plate, and incubating the quadruplicate sets of dishes at
each of live different temperatures—after having first transferred uniform
quantities of inoculum to the plates from plain agar cultures previously
grown at the particular temperatures at which the plates were subsequently
incubated. The results are summarised in Table 6, and it will be seen
that at the eight day period the greatest colony diameter in the case of
isolate No. 13 occurred at 15 deg., with appreciable growth at 20 deg. In
the case of isolate No. 678, there was little difference in colony diameter
at 15 deg., 20 deg., or 25 deg., but the rate of growth appeared to be some-
what faster at 30 deg. These results are illustrated in Fig. 7.
It was therefore of interest to determine the moisture-temperature rela-
tionships in infection of wheat seedlings by isolates of H. sativum which
were known to make optimum growth in respect of colony diameter on agar
at 15 deg. to 20 deg., and which, in previous infection tests under high
temperature conditions, proved to be of low virulence. Four such iso-
lates were used, in addition to one each of Helminthosporvum M. and 11.
sativum, whose rate of growth on agar media was known to be fastest at
25 deg. to 28 deg. Cent., and whose virulence on seedlings was known to be
of a high order; in the case of the former, the cultures were Nos. 13, 53, 678,
97, and in the latter, Nos. 48 and 43.
Sterilised loamy soil of a water-holding capacity of 47 per cent, was
used, and the tests were conducted in 5-inch pots in quadruplicate under
glasshouse conditions. Fresh inoculum consisting of the fungus growing

on sterilised oats was incorporated with the top layer of soil at the rate
■of 70 c.c. per pot. No sterilised oats were added to the controls. The
variety of wheat used was Nabawa, and 35 grains were sown in each pot.
The soil moisture content was adjusted to 32 or 64 per cent, of the water-
holding capacity, as required, and each day during the four weeks course
of the experiment each pot was weighed and the necessary additions of
water made. The tests were initiated in mid-June, one complete quadrupli-
cate set of pots being placed in a glasshouse unheated, and another in a
glasshouse heated by hot-water pipes. At the termination of the experi-
ment, emergence counts were made and the tops of the plants in each pot
weighed immediately after the final weighings for adjustment of soil-
moisture content.
The experimental data are summarised in Table 7. Differences in growth
between certain of the series are illustrated in f igures 8 to 13.

Table 7.— Summary of data from a glasshouse experiment to determine the
effects of soil moisture and air temperature on emergence and weight
of tops of wheat seedlings, when selected isolates of Helminthosporium
M. and H. sativum were used in inoculation of sterilised soil.
A study of the results for emergence shows that in practically every
instance the greatest amount of pre-emergence blight occurred at the “low"
temperatures, and although the effect of soil moisture content varied with
different isolates it is noteworthy that with three out of six cultures
tested, the figures for emergence were lower under conditions of high soil
moisture and relatively low temperature. It was apparent also that the
only isolates which produced pronounced blighting were those whose
virulence had previously been shown to be of a marked character, viz., Nos.
43 and 48.
* Certain of these isolates had shown optimum rate of growth on agar over a wide range of temperature,
others over a restricted range, (c/. Tables 5 and 6.)

The data for average weight of tops per pot again shows that m most
instances the most severe effects occurred at relatively low temperatures
an] that with only one exception the greatest differences between weights of
tons of control and inoculated series were always apparent under condi-
tions of high soil moisture and low temperature. In the high temperature
series, the results show that in the case of each of the weakiy pathogemc
strains of 11. sativum, the difference for weight of tops at the low soil
moisture content was the same as that at the high moisture content .
the case of the virulent strains— Helmmthosponum U. 48 and U.Mlimn
43—however, the weight differences were much larger under conditions of
high soil moisture. It is again noteworthy that out of the si*-culturestea tod,
Nos. 43 and 48 proved most virulent—the latter more so than the former.

Differences in weight for equivalent numbers of seedlings occurred m
many instances but this was due to differences in vigour and general develop-
ment; moreover, in some cases occasional seedlings bad died before tie
termination of the experiment.
It is unfortunate that facilities were not available for complete control
of temperature. As it was, the air temperature conditions in both “high
and “low” series fluctuated considerably, as is indicated from the thermo-
graph records summarised at the bottom of Table 7. However, while the
average maximum temperature in each case was not very different, the
range and average minimum in the low temperature series was


widely different from those in the high temperature series, so that two dis-
tinct sets of conditions were provided for assessing the effects of tempera-
ture variations on infection, and under these conditions it has been shown
that with isolates of both low and high virulence more severe infection in
the majority of cases occurred when the soil moisture content was high and
when the temperature ranged from 8.5° to 36°C. Moreover, the experiment
has again demonstrated that the rate of growth of colonies on agar under
different temperatures provides no reliable guide as to the optimum tem-

viding for a greater degree of temperature control, results of greater signi-
ficance doubtless would have been obtained.
THE FOOT-ROT PHASE IN ADULT PLANTS.
lieference C 2, J 3) lias already been made to the fact that under Australian
conditions the damage from foot and root-rot due to 11. sativum is usually
much more conspicuous and severe at or later than the ear-peeping stage,
than in the seedling stages. This has been the experience in Canada
and the United States also.
It has frequently been observed that once seedlings become established
there is usually little evidence of the disease until about the time plants come
into ear, and in this connection the remarks of Christensen ( ] ‘) are of
interest: “Field observations indicate that barley and wheat pass through a
stage in which they are somewhat resistant to root and basal-stem rot.
This period of apparent resistance extends from the time of development
of adventitious or permanent roots, to the heading stage. I rom the milk
stage to maturity root-rot and basal stem-rot develop very rapidly.” llobert-
son ( 71 ) has shown that a pronounced increase in the amount of lignification
in the xylem, perieycle, fibres of the vascular bundle sheaths and cortex of
the crown roots of wheat plants, occurs with advancing age and reaches
a maximum by about 40 days. The increase in lignification was observed to
be coincident with a pronounced falling off in infection by 0. graminis
after 40 days.
(a) Influence of Rainfall.
Little information is available concerning the effect of climatic factors
on root-rot development in wheat, as caused by 11. sativum. Interesting cor-
relations, however, have been worked out in connection, with Ophiobohis root-
rot by Russell ( 73 ) in Canada and by Garrett ( 2T ) in South Australia. But
the situation with epidemics caused by IT. sativum may.be expected to be
somewhat different from that in the case of 0. graminis, for as Garrett
has pointed out epidemics of take-all occur in years of comparatively high
spring rainfall, and this is possibly related to the occurrence of wind-borne
ascospore infection.
The use of some system which expresses in a single numerical index at
least some of the factors concerned in climate, may prove of distinct value in
epidemiological studies. The Meyer ratio of precipitation to absolute satura-
p .
tion deficit ( ——I—-the1—-the relation between the rainfall in inches or centi-
s d.'
metres, and the atmospheric water vapour saturation deficit, also measured
in inches or centimetres —takes account of such factors as precipitation,
temperature, relative humidity, and the evaporating power of the atmosphere.
This ratio has been used in connection with plant and soil studies ( 7 ) and
may prove of value in connection with epidemiological studies on economic
crops.

records of extent of development of foot-rot, set out in Tables 20 and 21,
.are based on personal observations and on reports from district agricultural
instructors. The figures for rainfall were computed from data made avail-
able by the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau, and represent the
totals for the average monthly rainfall in the growing period of the crop
(or portions thereof) from several different localities in each of the State
divisions considered. In the Warrumbungle Lowlands sub-division of the
Central Western Slopes division the rainfall data from the following-
centres were analysed: Dubbo, Wellington, Parkes, Molong, Cudal, Forbes,
Eugowra, Canowindra; in the South Western Slopes (northern) sub-
di vision of the South Western Slopes division the following centres:
Marsden, Grenfell, Koorawatha, West Wyalong, Barmedman, Morangarell,
Temora, Young, Boorowa, Murrumburrah, Cootamundra, .Tunee, Burrin-
juck Dam, Gundagai; in the Liverpool Plains sub-division of the
Western Slopes division the following centres: Boggabri, Manilla, Ben-
demeer, Gunnedah, Somerton, Tamworth, Breeza, Werris Creek, Black-
ville, Quirindi, Nundle; in the Eastern Riverina sub-division of the
Riverina division the following centres: Ardlethan, Barellan, Griffith,
Leeton, Whitton, Narrandera, Grong Grong, Coolamon, Conargo, Denili-
-quin, Moama, Jerilderie, Berrigan, Tocumwal, LTrana,, Lockhart, Wagga,
The Rock, Henty, Culcairn, Corowa, Ilowlong.
From the data presented in Tables 20 and 21, it is evident that in the
•Central Western Slopes foot-rot was prevalent or moderately prevalent in
those years when the rainfall in the growing period of the crop was, in
general, less than or in excess of 10 inches. In the South Western Slopes
also it is apparent that in years when the total rainfall during April to
October was 10 or 11 inches foot-rot was not widely distributed, whereas

in seasons when the rainfall for the growing period was higher or lower
than approximately 11 inches the disease was present over wide areas; the
-occurrence noted for 1925, however, appears to be an exception for which
no explanation can be offered at present. From the distribution of the

rainfall during the early and later periods of the growing season as set
out in the Tables, it is not possible to conclude whether early rains are
more important than late rains in respect of disease occurrence or vice
versa.
Table 21. —Average rainfall of several different localities in the oouth
Western Slopes (Northern) subdivision of New South Wales for
certain months in each year of the period 1924-33, and the extent of
development of foot-rot in wheat in each season.
The analysis of the situation for the Riverina district also showed that
the same general principle obtains, the outstanding features of mention
being that foot-rot was prevalent in the years 1920, 1928, 1929, 1931 and
1932, when the total average rainfall registered in the growing period of
the crop was 14.9, 8.5, 8.7, 17.5 and 12.7 inches respectively. Data for the
North Western Slopes are not as complete as desired, but from information
available it would appear that in that division the disease assumed most
serious proportions when the rainfall during April-October was heavy; thus,
foot-rot was observed to be prevalent in 1924, 1920, 1930, 1931, and 1933,
when the average rainfall was 14.4, 12.4, 10. i, 10.0 and 1 1 .2 inches
respectively, while the disease was not prevalent in 1928 or 1929, when
the rainfall recorded was 11.1 and 10.3 inches respectively.
Observations in individual localities also support those reported above
for districts as a whole. For instance, at Cowra, the foot-rot disease was
very prevalent in 1921 and 1929, when the April-October rainfall was 10.5
and 0.9 inches respectively, while in 1922 and 1927, when the rainfall for
the growing period was 11.9 and 9.5 respectively, the disease occurred to
a slight extent only; many similar examples could be quoted to support
the contention that foot-rot is usually more severe when the April-October
rainfall is low or high. Under dry soil conditions, crown root development
ami the plant’s.capacity for root repla’cement are restricted, and the num-
bers of micro-organisms in the soil are not as great as when moist con-
ditions prevail ( 23 , 4 '), so that inhibition of parasitic activity would be less,
and disease development is to be expected. Under very moist soil condi-
tions, however, biological antagonism becomes more important, and in soils
lacking in humus —a characteristic feature of typical wheat country in
New South Wales—and subject to excessive rains, circulation of gases is
slow and carbon-dioxide accumulates, with the result that root develop-
ment is impeded and general metabolism lowered; hence invasion by root-
rotting fungi under excessively moist conditions is also to be expected.


Ihese data obviously can only be used to indicate in a very general way
the relationship of rainfall to incidence of disease. Moreover, the effec-
tiveness of rains is dependent on so many factors of soil and climate which
could not be reckoned with in this general survey. Again, instances came
under notice which in themselves were contradictory of the general trend
indicated, and these were to be explained on the number of cultivations
which is known to have a very important bearing on moisture conservation
and which, in turn, influences the final effectiveness of the rainfall. This
question is discussed further at a later stage in this paper.
(b) Effect of Soil Moisture.
In view of the results of the survey on the relation of rainfall to develop-
ment of the disease under field conditions, experiments were conducted
under glasshouse conditions to determine the effect of various soil moisture
contents on disease development in adult wheat plants. No work has so
far been published along these lines, the controlled moisture experiments
of other workers having been confined to plants in the seedling stage.
Dosdall (' 4 ) and Christensen ( 17 ), however, attempted to determine the
moisture relationship for adult plants under field conditions.
A orking with barley and wheat planted in field soil inoculated with
11. sativum and sprinkled with varying quantities of water, Dosdall ( 24 )
observed that the barley showed a slight increase in the amount of foot-rot
with increase in relative amount of soil moisture, whereas in wheat foot-
and root-rot was slightly more marked on the driest plot. The differences,
however, were small and were not of much significance.
Christensen ( u ) studied the influence of soil moisture on 11. sativum
infection in wheat and barley by sowing on peat soil with five different
drainage levels. In the case of wheat, the roots and stems of plants on the
one-foot water level usually were not so obviously discoloured as those in
the other plots; plants were killed by root- and basal-stem rots on four
different water levels (2 to 5 feet) but not on the 1-foot level. He con-
cluded that high soil moisture either inhibited the growth of the fungus
or rendered the plants less susceptible to infection; that the lowering of
the soil moisture content to a point where metabolism of wheat or barley
became abnormal, predisposed them to invasion by 11. sativum.
Tests conducted by the writer extended over the three-year period,
1931-33, and organisms other than 11. sativum were also employed for the
inoculations. The effect of soil moisture on disease development when the
soil was inoculated with organisms in combination, was also investigated.
The details are set out below.
Tests in 1931.—1 n these tests, 11. sativum was used for the inoculations,
and exactly the same procedure as that described above for the 1931 seed-
ling blight moisture tests was adopted. The experiment was conducted
in triplicate and was terminated when the plants reached maturity. In
each of the control and inoculated series, one triplicate set was maintained
throughout at 30 per cent, of the water-holding capacity of the soil, one
triplicate set at 65 per cent, moisture, while in two other sets provision
for change of moisture-content was made three months after sowing, so
that soil in containers of the 30 per cent, series was adjusted to 65 per
cent, of the water-holding capacity, and vice versa; these changes were
brought about gradually and took approximately seven days to complete,
the altered moisture-contents being then maintained until maturity by the
usual thrice-weekly weighings and additions of the necessary quantities

of water. It was hoped by arranging for different sets of soil moisture con-
ditions to secure information which would be of value in interpreting the
occurrence of epidemics under field conditions. It is of interest to note
that in his experiments on the water requirements of farm crops, Richardson
(“) arranged for soil in pots to be adjusted to different moisture capacities,
and in this connection stated that the conditions obtaining in pots kept
at 30 per cent, water-holding capacity were really comparable with those
actually existing in arid regions, while the conditions in pots maintained
throughout the growing period at high saturation (00 per cent, and above)
were comparable with soils enjoying a good rainfall.
Extensive notes were taken throughout the course of the 1931 experi-
ment, in addition to making a complete analysis of the mature plants. The
data showed that the only appreciable differences were in plant height,
which are shown in Table 22. It will be observed that the feature of in-
terest is the difference in height between control and inoculated plants
when the soil was originally kept fairly dry, but later made wet. The
Table 22. —Summary of results of a glasshouse experiment (1931) to deter-
mine the effect of varying soil moisture content on the development of
root rot (Helminth osporium sativum ) in adult wheat plants, using
unsterilised loamy soil.
differences shown for the remaining series are so slight that no definite
■conclusions can be drawn from them. It would appear from this experi-
ment, therefore, that infection by 11. sativum, as manifested in adult plants,
is most likely to be severe when the soil moisture content during early
growth is low, but is increased after the plants have been growing for
about three months.
Tests in 1932. —Following exactly the procedure outlined for the 1932
experiments on the effect of soil moisture on seedling blight, a series of
tests (Series A, see Table 23) were initiated on .Tune 9 and terminated when
the plants reached maturity. All work was conducted in duplicate, and in
both control and inoculated series provision was made for fluctuations in
soil-moi3ture content, as arranged in the 1931 tests. The details in respect
of these moisture changes are set out in Table 23.
A further series (Series B, see Table 23) was also instituted to ascer-
tain the effect of adding to control and inoculated duplicate sets, measured
quantities of water which would be equivalent to rainfall under field com
ditions. The surface area of each container was estimated to be .00001014

order to equal 1 inch of rain was 1043 c.c. Sterilised soil of a water-
holding capacity of 28.5 per cent, was again used, and inoculations and
additions of water were made after the manner described for the 1932 seed-
ling blight tests. Twenty-five grains were sown in each container, and the
experiment was initiated on June 9, under glasshouse conditions.
Measured quantities of water were added to each container at odd inter-
vals throughout the growing period, and these quantities are indicated in
Table 24.
Throughout the course of each series of experiments, notes were made
in respect of dates of ear-peeping, flowering, and ripening; a complete
analysis of plants in each container in respect of height, number of tillers,
yield, basal lesions and root damage was made at the conclusion of the
tests. 'File more important data are set out in Table 23.

Considering the data for Series A, it is clear that the final number of
plants in the control set maintained at a low soil moisture throughout
was much the same as that in the control set whose soil moisture content
was low during early growth but which was subsequently increased; that
the number of plants in the high moisture control set was about the same
as that whose water-holding capacity was reduced in the late stages of
growth; that high soil moisture during early growth resulted in a greater
number of plants, finally, than in the low moisture sets —when uninocu-
lated soil was used. Much the same conclusions are to be drawn in respect
Table 24. —Number of cubic centimetres of water added at different periods
to each wheat container* in “dry” and “ wet ” series of a Helmin-
thosporium sativum root-rot experiment conducted under glasshouse
conditions in 1932. (cf. Table 23, Series B.)
of the inoculated sets. It would-appear that the final number of plants in
a stand of wheat, whether in clean or infested soil, depends largely on the
available moisture supply during early growth—being always greater when
the initial soil moisture content is fairly high. It is evident, also, that
the difference between control and inoculated containers in respect of the
final number of head-producing plants was much greater when the moisture
content was low during early growth than when it was high, irrespective
of what the water-holding capacity was in the later stages of growth.
The dates for time of ripening in each set show that in all cases the
plants growing in inoculated soil matured somewhat earlier than did those
growing in uninoculated soil.
•Surface area of each container = -()0001014 acre.
t 68791—C


The effect on height of plants through varying the moisture content of
the soil showed that when the percentage water-holding capacity during
the pre-ear-peeping stage was high the parasitism of 11. sativum was negli-
gible, whether the moisture content in the post-ear-peeping stage was high
or low. This negligible effect is also reflected in the figures given for yield.
On the other hand, when the soil moisture content during early growth was
low the data for average plant height and total yield show that the pathogen
had exerted an effect which was more pronounced in the set adjusted to a
high moisture content in the late stages of growth than in that maintained
at the low moisture content throughout the experiment. The figures for
average yield per plant are what may have been expected in view of the
number of plants in each instance.
In the case of Series B the figures for final number of head-producing
plants are what may have been expected in view of the data and discussion
presented for Series A. It is to be noted that although in Series B there
was a “dry” and a “wet” set for both control and inoculated containers,
the moisture content during the first six weeks of the test was not markedly
different in each set, as the ratio of water supplied to each was approxi-
mately 3: 4.
The ripening dates show again that plants growing in inoculated soil
matured somewhat earlier than did those in the control sets.
The data for average plant height and yield are likewise in agreement
with those presented for Series A, showing that under dry soil conditions
foot-rot manifestation in adult plants is more severe than when the soil
is kept reasonably moist.
Concurrently with the tests described above, a series of preliminary
experiments was instituted under glasshouse conditions to determine the
effect of H. sativum and Fusarium sp., singly and in combination, on
adult wheat plants growing in 7-inch pots. Sterilised Bathurst wheat
soil of a water-holding sapacity of 28.5 per cent, was used, and 16 grains
of Nabawa wheat were sown in each pot at a depth of 1J inches. Soil was
inoculated with spore suspensions obtained from colonies growing on potato
dextrose agar, and an effort was made to ensure uniformity in respect of the
amount of inoculum applied to each pot. When two organisms were in-
corporated with the soil, the total amount of inoculum was double that
used when only one organism was incorporated. No sterilised medium was
added to any of the pots in the control series.
Following soil inoculation and planting of seed, a thin layer of sterilised
soil was applied to each pot to prevent spore dispersal, and the moisture
content in all series was as indicated in Table 25.
It will be observed from Table 25 that in a few instances late inocula-
tions were also employed. These were done at the ear-peeping stage (October
14) by carefully removing soil from the bases of the plants, placing spore
material in the region of the roots and sub-crown internode with a flat
needle, and then replacing the soil. All tests were initiated on July 27 r
and were conducted in duplicate.

acting singly, hut when combined with Fusarium sp. the effect was quite
noticeable. It is also to be noted that this marked reduction in height re-
sulting from the combined activity of organisms was much the same when
both were incorporated with the soil at time of sowing, when 11. sativum
was applied at sowing and Fusarium sp. at ear-peeping stage, and when
Fusarium sp. was incorporated at time of sowing and 11. sativum at the
later stage. Period of infection with root-rotting fungi has already been
discussed by the writer ( 4: '). Examination of heads and stem bases of
plants in all pots showed that parasitic invasion had occurred in the
inoculated series, hut it was difficult accurately to estimate differences be-
tween the various sets in this connection. It soon became evident that the
differences could best he expressed by plant height.
Tests in 1933. —In view of the results obtained on infection in adult plants
with 11. sativum and Fusarium sp., singly and in combination, in 1932, a
comprehensive series of experiments was instituted in 1933 to ascertain the
effect of varying the soil moisture content on infection in adult wheat with
several different cereal root-rotting organisms, singly and in various combi-
nations, under glasshouse conditions.
The general procedure was exactly the same as that adopted for the seed-
ling blight tests conducted in 1933 and described above, one series being
carried out in 10-inch galvanized-iron containers and the other in seven-
inch garden pots. In the former series fifty grains of Nabawa wheat were
sown in each container on July 7, and the moisture content was adjusted
to 30 per cent, or 55 per cent. W.H.C. as required in each case. The number
of grains planted was large so that following loss from pre-emergence and
seedling blight sufficient plants would be left to grow to maturity. Four
weeks after sowing, the number of seedlings in each container was thinned
to 28. The fluctuations in soil-moisture content arranged during the course
of the tests were as indicated in Table 26.
Tn the pot series, twenty-four grains of wheat were sown in each pot on
July 21, and after four weeks the number of seedlings in each was thinned
to nineteen. The soil moisture adjustments were similar to those previously
* Of the Fusarium culmorum type.
t All pots were maintained at 45 per cent. W.H.C. until ten days after ear-peeping stage, when the
moisture level was kept at 15 per cent. W.H.O. until maturity.

ments were the same as those used in the 1933 seedling hliglit tests, viz
Helminthosporiurn M.. IT. sativum. Fusarium sp., Oplnobolus grammis, and
Penicillium sp.
A study of the results for the large container experiment, presented in
Table 26, reveals a number of interesting points. In the first place, infected
plants in almost every instance came into ear earlier than did the control
plants, irrespective of variations in soil-moisture content. In the 1932 tests
it was found that inoculated plants matured earlier than the controls.
Table 26. —Summary of results of a glasshouse experiment (1933) to determine
the effect of varying soil'moisture conditions on the development of
foot-rot in adult wheat plants when sterilised soil was inoculated with
Helminthosporium M., H. sativum and Fusarium sp.,* singly and in
various combinations.
The most striking feature of the results is in respect of average height
of the plants. Considering first the figures for the wet-dry senes it is apparent
that most severe, stunting occurred in containers inoculated with Helmtn-
thosporium M., IT. sativum and Fusarium sp. in combination. Some de-
gree of stunting also occurred in other containers but the decrease in height
in each was not so striking as that just cited.
In the drv-wet series, however, not only did the greatest amount of stunt-
ing occur in those containers in which all three organisms were incorporated
but the decrease in height was greater than that noted for similarly treated

plants in the wet-dry series. It is also to be noted that when Helminthos-
porium M. and 11- sativum w r ere combined in the one container the reduc-
tion in height of plants was greater than when either organism was used
singly, and this decrease —though not as marked as when three fungi were
used together for inoculation —was quite appreciable.
It was significant that in both moisture sets the average yield of grain
per plant in the inoculated series was not materially different from that
for the controls. In almost all of the writer’s glasshouse tests over several
years, grain yield has invariably been found to be an unsatisfactory measure
of plant reaction. This has been attributed to variations in setting of grain,
consequent upon differences in time of flowering and humidity of the
glasshouse. Height of plants, however, has always proved to be the most
satisfactory standard for glasshouse work.
Examination of the root systems of plants in both the dry-wet and wet-
dry series showed that in the latter the roots were better developed than in
the corresponding sets of the former, the root systems of uninoculated plants
having made most extensive development in each case. Examination of the
basal nodes and internodes showed the presence of lesions in various stages
of development but the markings were so variable in each of the inoculated
sets that they could not be correlated with the extent of disease development
as determined by plant height which was considered to he the most reliable
indicator.
A study of the data for the pot series of experiments, presented in Table
27 (cf. Figs. 14 and 15), show's that under the wet-drv treatment there
were no appreciable differences in height or yield between control plants
Table 27. —Summary of results of a glasshouse experiment (1933) to deter-
mine the effect of varying soil-moisture conditions on the development

Helminthosporium sativum and Ophiobolus graminis, singly and in com-
bination ; also when several fungi w'ere incorporated together.
and those growing in soil inoculated with one or more pathogenic fungi.
The result c or the H. sato'wm-inoculated pots is much in accord with that
for the same series in the large container tests described above.

In the dry-wet pot experiments, it is to be noted that while the figures
for average yield of grain per plant are of little account, the data for
height are in general agreement with the trend of results discussed in the
case of the dry-wet series in the large container tests, viz., that when
several root-rotting fungi are combined in the inoculation of soil, the effect
is to cause more stunted growth in the plants than when organisms are
inoculated singly.
Examination of the root systems showed, as previously observed, that
greatest development had occurred in the wet-dry series, the control plants
showing more extensive systems than the inoculated plants in each series.
There appeared to be only slight differences in the root development of
plants from each of the various inoculation sets in the dry-wet and in the
wet-dry tests. Basal culm lesions provided no reliable indication as to the
extent of infection.
The results obtained in the pot series were not so convincing as those
reported for the large container experiment, hut it is significant that in
each case more severe infection occurred when several fungi were inoculated
into the soil, and then under soil conditions which —up to the ear-peeping
stage—were fairly dry but which subsequently were quite moist.
Conclusions.
From the results on disease development in adult plants over the three-
year period, it is clear that whether the pathogens were used singly or in
combination the effects from inoculation were usually most severe when the
soil moisture content during early growth was low, but high during the
later stages of growth. It is also clear that the degree of infection was
generally most marked when organisms were associated together than
when acting singly. Many instances of root-rot in the Central and South
Western Slopes of Mew South Wales have come under notice, when the
occurrences were associated with the dry state of the seed-bed and dry
conditions during the winter months.
From the experiments in comparative symptomatology ( 43 ) the writer
concluded that since the features of Helminthosporium infected plants
under pure culture conditions were different from those collected in the
field, it would appear that the manifestations of foot-rot under conditions
of commercial cropping were not attributable solely to the action of H
sativum, and that perhaps more than one organism was responsible for
the symptoms developed. It was also pointed out that many of the isolates
of H. sativum obtained from root-rot affected wheat in this country were
of very low virulence, and that while in some instances damage was directly
attributable to this fungus, it was probable that the number of cases in
which severe effects were due to the combined action of 11. sativum and one
or more other fungi, was far greater.
It is impossible to determine precisely what the infection phenomena
are in the case of plants growing under field conditions, but the opinions
expressed in regard to the probability of disease development being due to
the action of two or more organisms, are strongly supported by the experi-
mental results discussed in the foregoing pages. In fact, the writer feels
convinced from long association with this problem in many aspects, that
while “take-all” is attributable to the action of a single organism (Ophio-
bolus graminis ) and “purple patch” to a single organism ( Rhizoctonia
solani), the foot-rot disease —previously associated with 11. sativum in
Australia is in the majority of cases due to the action of a complex of


organisms, comprising Ilelminthosporium M., H. sativum, lusarium cul-
morum and possibly other fungi. Owing to the fairly constant association
of 11. sativum with affected plants, however, it is probable that this organ-
ism is the primary pathogen of the complex. It is conceivable from the
results of at least one of the experiments that in some instances reputedly
harmless fungi may play an important part in accentuating the effects
initiated by one or more of the recognised pathogens. It is perhaps signi-
ficant that in platings of the basal part of foot-rot-affected wheat from
the field, more than one type of fungus usually develops in association
with 11. sativum.
Of particular interest at this point is the work of Broadfoot (’") who
studied the effect of other cereal root-rotting fungi on the pathogenicity of
Ophiobolus graminis, and observed that Helminthosporium sativum,
Fusarium culmorum, and Leptosphaeria herpotrichoides singly and in
various combinations depressed the virulence of 0. graminis in most in-
stances. A study of his tabulated data, however, reveals certain points in
regard to the effect of other root-rotting organisms on the pathogenicity of
IJ. sativum —a feature to which he does not draw attention in the article;
his tabulated results show quite clearly that disease development in adult
wheat was more intense when 11. sativum was associated with 0. graminis,
F. culmorum and L. herpotrichoides —singly or in various combinations
than when acting alone.
in reference to the moisture factor, the results of the controlled experi-
ments presented above give a clearer picture of the relationship than has so
far been presented for the root-rot disease; also they indicate the effect
of moisture content at varying periods of growth of the plant on disease
development, in a way which could not be determined from the general
survey on the relationship of rainfall to incidence of disease in different
districts. The results show that the moisture relationship is of very great
importance in so far as the disease is concerned, and this fact is of par-
ticular interest in view of the situation in regard to wheat production gener-
ally in Australia. Richardson (“) found that the maximum yield of both
straw and grain for wheat resulted when the soil moisture content was
maintained at CO per cent, of the water-holding capacity, the yield botii
of grain and straw declining as the moisture content was increased or
diminished.
Moisture is the principal factor concerned in the successful growing of
wheat in Australia, and while the temperature factor is, in the main, likely
to be of real importance during the very critical stage of heading and
flowering when, together with drying winds, it may be responsible for
marked depletion of the available supply of moisture to the plant, in
general, temperature has not been considered by investigators to be so
important a climatic factor as rainfall. The precipitation and its inci-
dence are not the only factors in rainfall; more important still is the
amount of moisture actually retained by the soil and the capacity of the
soil for supplying water to the plant, all of which is so largely dependent
on the physical character of the soil.
Since winter sown wheat under Australian conditions adds to its dry
weight at an increasing rate during the first four months of growth and
reaches maximum rate at the ear-peeping stage in September-October, it
will be seen that the supply of soil moisture during August and September
is of great importance. Hence, any factor which tends to limit the avail-
ability of moisture to the crop at this time is likely to affect the ultimate
yield, so it may be expected that low rainfall prior to August and/or during


August-September or, on the other hand, excessively wet weather would
be inimical to the crop; if attack from root-rotting fungi was also in evi-
dence under either of these sets of conditions, the yield may still further
be atfected —and it has been demonstrated by the writer that low soil mois-
ture content during early growth followed by high soil moisture in the later
stages, favours root-rot development.
It would appear that the manner in which disturbed water relationships
influence yield in wheat is similar to that affecting foot-rot development.
Hence it is concluded that weakened plant growth constitutes a very im-
portant factor in the progress of the disease. Data presented in the follow-
ing pages provide further confirmation for this argument.
(c) Effect of Cutting Back Plants.
Field observations by the writer (*') in the Central Western Slopes dur-
ing 1925 and 1926 showed that healthy, vigorous stands of wheat which
had been fed-off by sheep in July, subsequently incurred severe damage
from Ophiobolus root-rot; sections of the crop in the same paddock which
had not been grazed were quite free from the disease. The same phenome-
non was noted for Helminth os porium root-rot. Lp to this time, no such
observations had been reported in Australia; nor was there any record of
similar occurrences in foreign literature. Guyot ('*') in 1930, however, in
discussing the control of foot-rot diseases of wheat, referred to the adverse
effect on yield of allowing sheep to graze the fields. Griffiths ('”), in 1924,
reported experimental results to the effect that infection with the wheat
flag smut organism could be produced earlier and in greater percentage by
cutting back the plants at different stages of growth.
It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether the cutting back of
plants under distinctly artificial conditions would likewise result in in-
creased severity of root-rot development.
Concurrently with the 1932 experiments on the effect of soil moisture on
llelminihosporium root-rot in adult wheat plants, and adopting the same
experimental procedure, a series of tests w y as instituted to ascertain the
effects of cutting back plants in control and inoculated containers in each
of the dry and wet series. In the dry series, the moisture content of the
soil was maintained at 30 per cent, water-holding capacity throughout the
life of the plants, in the wet series at 60 per cent, water-holding capacity
throughout. Sterilised wheat soil was used and the organism employed
for the inoculations was 11. sativum. All sowings were made on June 9,
and plants were cut back to within 1| inches of the soil level on August 5,
at which time the plants were about 12 inches in height and had produced
1-3 tillers each.
At maturity, all plants were examined and data taken in respect of indi-
vidual plant height. The results showed, as was to be expected from experi-
mental data recorded in the foregoing pages, that a greater difference in
degree of stunting* between control and inoculated series had occurred in the
dry series than in the wet series. In fact, in the latter several of the in-
fected plants were somewhat taller than the controls.
In the cut-back series, similar results were obtained —the inoculated
plants of the dry pots average 31 inches in height as against 34 in the
controls. In the wet pots, the difference in height was 2 inches in favour,
of the infected plants.
The results also showed that in both dry and wet series the difference in
height between plants in the control non-cut-back pots and those in the
control cut-back pots was not as great as in the case of the inoculated
series.

In view of these results it was of interest to ascertain the effect of
■cutting-back plants when inoculated with several root-rotting organisms,
singly and in combination, and when grown under outdoor conditions of
temperature and rainfall. Accordingly, in 1934, a triplicated series of
tests in eight-inch pots was conducted under out-door conditions, using
sterilised loamy soil. The fungi Helminthosporium M., 11. sativum and
Fusarium culmorum were used, singly and in various combinations, foi
the inoculations, and the same general procedure described for the 1934
seedling blight tests was adopted. The experiment was initiated on 27th
June, and no attempt was made to control the moisture content of the
soil in any of the series. Plants in certain pots were cut back to within
one inch of the soil level on 31st August. At maturity all plants were
measured, the total dry weights of tops determined, and the root systems
examined after removal of soil by washing.
A study of the results presented in Table 28 shows, in the first instance,
that when the heights of plants in control and inoculated pots in the non-
cut-back series are compared, there was an appreciable decrease in all
infected plants except in the case of the 11. sativum and the F. culmorum
sets, being quite pronounced in the case of those inoculated with H.
.sativum + F. culmorum and Helminthosporium M. 4- 11. sativum
The conditions for plant growth were very satisfactory, and it is known
that where H. sativum is acting alone under such conditions, manifesta-
tion of symptoms in adult plants is usually of little or no account, i.e..
disease does not develop. Hence the exceptions in the present instance are
explained on this basis. It is also to be noted that, with the exception of
the 11. sativum pots, the yield of dry matter from inoculated plants wan
noticeably lower than that from uninfected individuals.
Table 28. —Summary of results of an outdoor pot experiment (1934), using
sterilised soil, to determine the effect of cutting-back on the development
of root-rot symptoms in adult wheat plants, when various organisms—
singly and in combination —were used for the inoculations.
Comparing the figures for height in the control and inoculated sets oi
the cut-back series, it is clear that reduction in height occurred in some
of the inoculated plants, but the differences were not as great as may have
been expected.


Examination of the basal parts of the plants showed that in the case oi
the controls, the nodes and internodes were heavily infected by the root-
rotting organisms used in the inoculated pots, and these fungi no doubl
had been transferred across by wind, resulting in severe attack on the new
succulent growth which followed the cutting-back of the plants in thin
series. But for this unexpected happening, the height of the control cut-
back plants may have been greater than that recorded. The figures for
yield, however, show a noticeable reduction for all inoculated plants over
controls, being most pronounced in the 11. sativum pots.
The differences for height and yield between the control cut-back and
control non-cut-back are no doubt explained by the heavy basal culm in-
fections in the former.
When the data for plants in the inoculated non-cut-back series are com-
pared with the figures for inoculated cut-back plants, it is evident that
■ cutting-back resulted in appreciable stunting in practically every instance,
and this was most marked in the case of plants growing in soil inoculated
with 11. sativum. Cutting-back also resulted in noticeable reduction in
yield of dry matter in most cases, being particularly marked again in the
case of the 11. sativum series.
Examination of the roots from all series in the experiment showed, ai?
indicated in Table 28 and in Figs. 16 and 17, that in inoculated pots the
root systems were not so extensively developed in the cut-back plants as
in the non-cut-back plants, although there appeared to be little difference
in this connection in the Helminlhosporium iff.-infected plants.

Finally, the results of the entire experiment demonstrate that the most
severe effects in respect of height and yield occurred in those plants which
were grown in soil inoculated with 11. sativum, 11. sativum —(- I. cut -

which are outlined at a later stage. . .
Whether the new succulent shoots which develop following grazing o;.
cutting back become more heavily attacked at the base by root-rotting fungi
which have increased during the early and warmer part of the season, w
not known. The effect of injury to plants from tramping of sheep or the
effect of organic materials deposited, would not —in view of the experi
mental results recorded —appear to be so important as the actual elimma
tion of the top growth. ,
The reduction in root development following cutting hack, as already
referred to, is of particular interest in view of the fact that organic root
reserves in some plants are known to vary according to the treatment to-
which the above-ground plant portions are subjected, and that productivity
is affected by these reserves ( 89 ). Much more work is necessary to deter-
mine the relationship in wheat of this idea to the concomitant effect o.
root invasions by parasitic fungi, and the final effect on root and top
development.


(d) Effect of Soil Type.
No experiments have been conducted by the writer with the
purpose of determining the influence of soil type on infection and disease
development, although field observations and miscellaneous experimental
work have not demonstrated that 11. sativum root-rot is more acute on one
type of soil than on another. The reports of other workers are rather con
dieting.
Stakman ( 81 ) was unable to find any correlation between disease se\oiitj
and soil type or previous crop history. Samuel ( ) observed that Ilehnin-
ihosporium was responsible for over 60 per cent, infection in wheat growing
on white sandhills, but that this disease was completely absent on fertile,
red sandy loam flats. Christensen ( 1T ) observed that in one season, damage
to roots by H. sativum was more severe on sandy soil than on heavier soils,
but in another season found that there was as much root infection in one
type of soil as in the other.
Dosdall O investigated the development of the disease in wheat and
barley in different types of sterilised, inoculated soil using pots contain-
ing a heavy loam, a sandy loam, a sand and a peat soil. She states that
during the first six weeks, root-rot inhibited the growth of barley to the
greatest extent in the peat soil and that the effect of the disease was less
pronounced in the heavy loam and the sand, and least evident in the sandy
loam. With wheat, during the same period, the growth was least inhibited
in the heavy loam—the effect of the disease being markedly increased, and
to practically the same extent, in the other three types of soil. By matur-
ity, however, she found that in wheat the disease had developed uiosl
severely in the sand, as evidenced by the smaller size of the plants, their
decreased vigour, the amount of basal browning, and the breaking-down
of the root system; the effect of the disease was almost as severe in tho
heavy loam, but in both the sandy loam and the peat there was only a very
slight difference between the plants grown in inoculated and uninoculated
soil. Doubtless such factors as supply of organic matter, water-holding
capacity, aeration and available mineral nutrients played an important
part in these tests, but the more recent work of Sanford and Broadfoot
O and of Garrett C) on the effect of other soil micro-organisms on in-
fection of wheat by Ophiobolus graminis offers at least one explanation as
to why most severe effects occurred in the sand, for although Dosdall’s tests
were conducted with soils which had been sterilised it is known that steri -
lised soil soon becomes contaminated with micro-organisms, and these mul-
tiply much more rapidly in loam soils than in sand, resulting often in
marked antagonism between the contaminants and the parasite—thereby
minimising pathogenic effects.
(e) Influence of Other Factors.
Temperature. —The influence of temperature on disease development in
adult plants has been determined by the writer and others mainly through
varying the dates of seeding. 1 his aspect is discussed later.
Frost Injury. —Frost, per se, is known to cause considerable damage to
wheat in certain seasons. Considerable evidence has been accumulated by
the writer, in support of the contention that subsequent to frosting, the
damage from 11. sativum is often very acute. Heald O discusses the


predisposing effect of frost inqury on root and foot infections in cereals.
Frosting of wheat stems sometimes extends as far as the basal inter-
joints, producing a brownish discolouration; these tissues become weakened
and thus furnish a ready avenue of entrance for the pathogen. In the
1929 season a wheat stand of 700 acres in the Kiverina district of New
South Wales was observed to be very badly attacked by 11. sativum, follow-
ing the occurrence of frost; on a conservative estimate the loss sustained
amounted to 75 per cent, of the potential yield; neighbouring crops which
had not been frosted were free from the disease.
Soil Reaction. —No work has been described dealing with the effect of soil
reaction on disease development in controlled experiments. Christensen (”)
states, however, that “the reaction of the soil determines to a great degree
the extent of infection. The disease was always worse in alkali spots than on
land immediately adjoining them. This was undoubtedly due to the fact
that the host had become weakened rather than to the effect of soil reaction
on the pathogen.” In connection with this latter point, Dosdall (' 4 ) ob-
served that spores of 11. sativum germinated through a wide range of hvdro-
gen-ion concentrations, although better germination was obtained in alka-
line solutions than in acid solutions. The spores tolerated high degrees
of alkalinity. Henry ( 35 ) observed that Helminthosporium M. grew well
throughout a pH range of 1.9 to 9.3 except in the most acid concentration;
the best growth was obtained on the acid side of the neutral point.
Soil pH determinations by the writer in 1931 of several samples taken
at Wagga Experiment Farm from the surface 3 inches adjacent to
healthy wheat plants or plants affected with 11. sativum, showed that the
pH in the case of the former varied from 7.3 to 7.5 and in the latter from
7.1 to 7.3. These results are probably of no significance, and no conclusions
are drawn from them.
Soil Salinity. —No experiments on this aspect have been conducted by the
writer, but Machacek ("") observed that unusually severe infection by
Helminthosporium and Fusarium occurred in fields of wheat where the
concentration of soluble salts was high. His experiments also showed that
high concentrations of magnesium sulphate retarded seedling growth and
increased the severity of root-rot.
Cultural practices and poor growing conditions affect to a considerable
extent the development of root-rot diseases in wheat, and these aspects are
discussed in Part 4, dealing with the control problem.
DISEASE DEVELOPMENT IN ADULT WHEAT UNDER ARTIFICIAL
CONDITIONS IN FIELD PLOTS.
From several years’ work on tests of relative susceptibility of wheat varie-
ties to infection by 11. sativum in field plots artificially inoculated with this
pathogen, it became apparent that further work in this connection was
useless until more was understood of the factors responsible for disease
development under field conditions. Distribution of inoculum in the rows
along with seed at time of planting could not be relied upon to result in
foot-rot development in full-grown plants under all conditions. Data on
seedling blight were usually most readily obtainable, as is indicated by the
-work already described.


As no experimental data had been furnished by other Australian in-
vestigators on foot-rot development in the adult plant phase, and since for
purposes of varietal tests on susceptibility it was necessary to know of the
conditions under which the disease would manifest itself, plot tests were
initiated at Cowra Experiment Farm in 1928 to determine the etfects of date
of seeding and other factors. These tests were continued in 1929 and 1930,
but owing to seasonal conditions and depredations of hares the results of
these essentially small-scale experiments were variable and of little value.
The work, however, was continued in the three-year period, 1931-33, and
was amplified considerably. The rainfall in inches for the growing period
(April to October) in each season was: 1931, 17; 1932, 12; 1933, 13.5. On
the basis of the survey on relation of rainfall to incidence of root-rot de-
velopment, discussed earlier, each of these three seasons at Cowra was favour-
able to disease development.
The essential feature of the work was to ascertain whether foot-rot de-
velopment could be promoted by varying the planting dates and by cutting
back the plants to within 1 inch of the soil level when they were about
8 inches high. Reference has already been made to the fact that under
conditions of commercial cropping, feeding-off by sheep often results in
severe damage through root-rot diseases.
The tests were conducted on fallowed land in plots 7 feet long and
replicated three times. Each plot consisted of three rows, spaced 9 inches
apart, and thirty grains of wheat were sown in each row about 1| inches
deep. Control and inoculated plots were employed, and inoculum—pre-
pared by culturing H. sativum on sterilised oats in flasks —was added at
sowing at the rate of approximately 100 c.c. per row. In the 1932 and
1933 tests, however, no inoculum was incorporated as the land utilised was
already heavily infested with the fungus. Two varieties each of the early,
mid-season and late maturing classes were planted at their correct sowing
periods and at periods not regarded as suitable. The general plan of the
1931 experiments—followed, with slight modifications, in 1932 and 1933
also —was as follows: —
1. To plant at usual period for the variety.
2. To plant at usual period and cut back plants when about 8 inches
high.
3. As in 2 except that plants to he cut hack a second time.
4. To plant three weeks later than usual for the variety.
5. To plant three weeks later than usual and cut back plants when 8
inches high.
6. To plant eight weeks later than usual for the variety.
7. To plant eight weeks later than usual and cut hack plants when 8
inches high.
Further details and results for each year’s experiments are set out in
Tables 29, 30 and 31, the data being taken when plants had reached the
late dough stage. The various degrees of infection recorded in the Tables
were based on examination of plants for the following characters: height,
tillering, root development, basal culm lesions, and ear development.

Summarising the results for the three-year period, it is clear from the
tabulated data that both increased percentage infection and increased
severity of foot-rot occurred when varieties were planted later than their
maturity classes demanded, thus being more pronounced in June sowings
than May sowings and still more pronounced in July plantings than in
June plantings. Also, in any variety and at any planting period percentage
and severity of infection increased as a result of cutting back during early
growth, and it was apparent that cutting back twice in the early growth
period resulted in more severe effects than where only one such treatment
was given. The results for one season (1932) indicated that some varieties
are more likely than others to develop foot-rot in severe form following
drastic feeding-off under conditions of commercial crop culture. The most
severe manifestations of disease occurred in those varieties planted late
and cut back during early growth.
In the 1931 tests —the only year when artificial inoculation of soil was ar-
ranged—the data indicated quite clearly that in a season favourable to root-
rot development and that when infested land was used for experiments, the
addition of inoculum of H. sativum to the soil was of little value in so far
as the development of foot-rot symptoms in adult plants was concerned, for
it was apparent that in regard to percentage and degree of infection there
were in most instances no appreciable differences between control and in-
oculated plots in any of the series. Greaney and Machacek ( 29 ) observed that
applications of oat-hull inoculum of 11. sativum to field soil at seed level
failed to increase the amount of root-rot in wheat, apparently due to the
antagonistic effect of other soil organisms. There was a considerable
amount of infection on the roots and basal parts of plants in plots not
artifically inoculated, a noticeable feature of the writer’s tests just discussed.
In isolation platings from infected plants taken from several of the
plots in each year of test, it was found that not only 11. sativum but also
F. culmorum and other organisms developed. It appeared that the root-
rot conditions in each season were attributable to the action of more than
one fungus, and this tends to support the idea previously outlined that root-
rot of wheat is due to a complex of organisms.
The effect of cutting back on disease development has already been fully
discussed in connection with the pot experimental work.
In reference to the effect of temperature on foot-rot in adult plants—as
determined by varying the dates of planting—it is of interest to note that
Christensen ( 17 ), working at Minnesota, United States of America, con-
ducted experiments along somewhat similar lines. He made several sow-
ings of wheat and barley under field conditions at various intervals, thd
soil being inoculated at time of seeding. He found that the greatest number
of plants killed after heading occurred in plots sown at the end of April or
in early May when the mean air temperature was approximately 50°F., and
observed that only a few of the plants sown after the middle of June suc-
cumbed to the disease (the mean air temperature for June was 63° and
for July 69°F.). While it has been shown for Australian conditions ( B 1)
that early sowing leads to greater root penetration than in the case of late
sowing, it has not yet been determined whether this is a factor in connec-
tion with the phenomenon under consideration. The pathogen is more active


at higher temperatures, but even with late plantings when the soil tempera-
tures are ower it has been shown in the seedling blight tests than an ap-
preciable amount of infection takes place, and whether the more severe
manifestations of the disease in the adult plant stage with late plantings aie
associated with winter injury to the host before it has become firmly estab-
lished, has yet to be determined.
It is of interest to note here that under commercial cropping conditions
in New South Wales, quite variable observations have been made m respect
of the effect of time of planting on ultimate foot-rot development. In many
instances it has been found that the disease shows up m more severe form
in varieties planted early, while under other conditions it appears eqm y
severe in early, mid-season and late maturing varieties; often, too, toot-
rot is more evident in late sown wheats when its development m earlier
sown varieties is negligible. The effect of grazing by
late grazing—is now generally accepted by agriculturists m this Mate as a
predisposing factor in the development of foot- and root-rot diseases m
wheat, being particularly marked in dry seasons.
SUMMARY OF PART 3.
1. A study of the influence of soil moisture content on infection of wheat
seedling's by Helminthosporiwn sativum in 1931 and 1932 showed that
pre-emergence blight was pronounced m soil maintained at high (
65 per cent.) and low (30 per cent.) moisture contents; that emergence of
seedlings in both moisture series was slower and more irregular m moo
lated soil than in uninoculated soil; and that infected seed mgs were notice-
ably stunted. These features appeared to be more marked m the ng
than in the low-moisture series.
2 Experiments on the influence of soil moisture on infection of wheat
seedlings by a number of root-rotting organisms, singly and in various
combinations, were conducted in 1933. In one experiment (Series A)
Helminthosporium M., H. sativum and Fmanum sp. were used; m the
other (Series B), H. sativum, Ophiobolus gramims, Fusanum sp. and
McmL sp. were used. With all fungi tested
greater at 60 per cent, water-holding capacity than at 30 per cent. .
holding capacity, but the difference in amount of blighting at high soil
moisture and low soil moisture varied considerably for individual organisms
and for combinations of them.
In the case of Series A, it was found that at 30 per cent, water-holding
capacity pre-emergence blight was greatest when all three fungi were
combined At 60 per cent, water-holding capacity most severe effects
occurred when the organisms were paired in various combinations or were
oil associated together. In both wet and dry series, greater stunting
oceiuTed in seedlings in soil inoculated with two or three organisms than
where only one fungus was used; reduction in height was more marked in
the 60 per cent, moisture series than m the 30 per cent, series.
In the case of Scries B, most severe reduction in emergence at both, high
and low mo" tte contends occurred when all four fungi were
Stunting of plants was most marked m the low moisture set contair g


the four organisms. While in the high moisture set, pre-emergence blight
was somewhat greater than in the low moisture set, the growth of surviv-
ing seedlings was more vigorous under the moist conditions.
3. In an outdoor pot experiment in 1934 involving tests with Ilelmin-
thosporium M., 11. sativum and F. culm ovum, it was found that somewhat
more pronounced pre-emergence blight in wheat occurred when Helmin-
thosporium M. and H. sativum or 11. sativum and F. culmorum were com-
bined than when each acted alone, while most severe effects occurred when
all three fungi were associated. Growth of surviving seedlings was more
stunted where the fungi were inoculated in pairs than singly, the greatest
reduction in vigour occurring where all three fungi were combined.
4. The influence of temperature on infection of wheat seedlings by 11.
sativum was studied in extensive field tests with several varieties over a
three-year period, by varying the dates of planting. The data which were
analysed statistically and which were correlated with air temperature lead-
ings also—showed that appreciable reduction in emergence occurred each
vear in the inoculated plots of early, mid-season and late maturing \arieties
planted at their correct sowing periods; there was, however, one single
exception and this was explained on the basis of low temperatures. Ihe
significant feature was that in each year of test the greatest reduction in
emergence occurred when wheat was sown early, i.e., in the late maturing
varieties sown at the end of April or beginning of May when soil tem-
peratures were high.
The results for a single season showed that there was no significant
difference in emergence between Control 1 (wheat sown alone) and Control
2 (Wheat + steamed oat kernels) plots in the early maturing, mid-season
maturing or late maturing varieties sown at their correct planting periods.
5. The rate of growth on agar of certain weakly-parasitic isolates of
11. sativum was found to be greatest at temperatures lower than the recog-
nised optimum for the species. In infection tests on wheat seedlings in
soil at 32 per cent, water-holding capacity and 64 water-holding capacity,
these isolates produced more severe effects at relatively low temperatures,
but under the conditions of the experiment it was also found that certain
strongly-parasitic isolates which made more rapid growth on agar at the
recognised optimum temperature, also produced more severe effects on
seedlings at the relatively low temperatures. It was again concluded that
rate of colony growth on agar at different temperatures provides no reliable
guide as to the optimum temperature range for infection in wheat seed-
lings.
6 A study of the incidence of Helminthosporium root-rot in adult wheat
plants at Bathurst during 1927-3932, inclusive, and of meteorological
data at that centre during the six-year period, showed that the disease was
more marked when the Meyer ratio (A) was relatively low during the
August-October periods.
t 68791 E


7. Surveys of incidence of wheat root-rot in different districts of the
State during 1924-1933 showed that the disease was usually more severe
when the rainfall in the growing period of the crop (April-October) was
high or low.,
8. Controlled experiments in 1931 showed that H. sativum root-rot in
adult wheat developed only in series in which the soil moisture content was
maintained at 30 per cent, water-holding capacity during the first three
months of growth and was then changed to and maintained at 65 per cent,
water-holding capacity until maturity.
The tests in 1932 showed that when soil moisture content during the
pre-ear-peeping stage was high the parasitism of 11. sativum was negligible,
whether the moisture content in the post-ear-peeping stage was high or
low But when the moisture content during early growth was low the
pathogen exerted an effect which was more pronounced in the series adjusted
to high moisture content in the late stages of growth than m that at ow
moisture throughout growth.
9. Preliminary tests in 1932 showed that root-rot in adult wheat was
more marked when soil was inoculated with If. sativum -j- Fusarium sp.
than when 11. sativum acted alone.
10 Further studies of the influence of soil moisture on root-rot develop-
ment in adult wheat were made in 1933. In Series A, Eelminthosporium
M 11. sativum and Fusarium sp. were used singly and in various combina-
tions for inoculation; in Series 8 ,11. sativum, Ophiobolus gramims.
Fusarium sp. and Penicillium sp. were used. In Series A, most severe
stunting occurred when all three fungi were combined and then under con-
ditions where the soil moisture content up to the ear-peeping stage was
low, and thereafter high; also, in the “dry-wet” set, it was found that when
Ifelminthosporium M. and If. sativum were combined the reduction oi
plant height was greater than when either organism was used alone. In
Series B it was likewise found that stunting was most pronounced when
all four fungi were combined, and then under the “dry-wet” conditions
quoted above.
11. Glasshouse experiments showed that cutting-back of wheat when 1-j
inches high resulted in more severe development of Helmmthosporvum
root-rot as determined by plant height at maturity. In outdoor pot tests
it was also shown that cutting-back resulted in more pronounced disease
development when If elminthosporium M., 11. sativum and I. culmorum
were used, singlv and in various combinations, for the inoculations; a
striking feature of these outdoor tests was that in inoculated pots the root
systems were not so extensively developed in the cut-back plants as m the
non-cut-back plants.
12. The influence on If elminthosporium root-rot in adult wheat of factors
other than moisture and cutting-back is discussed.
13. In field plot tests conducted over three years, it was shown that
llelminthosporium root-rot in adult wheat was more pronounced when
varieties were planted late (soil temperatures relatively low). Cutting-
back during early growth resulted in intensification of disease development.
The most severe manifestations of disease resulted from late planting am
cutting back:, combined.


PART 4.—THE CONTROL PROBLEM.
I ho problem oi control of foot rot in adult wheat is extremely complex,
as so many factors are involved. From the writer’s work it may be accepted
that in the majority of cases where severe occurrences are encountered in
the field, more than one organism is concerned in the epidemic. It is
probable, however, that 11. sativum is the primary pathogen—judging from
its very common association with the condition—and while present con-
siderations of control of foot-rot centre largely upon our knowledge of this
particular fungus, it will be realised that complete understanding of this
problem is only possible when more is known of the associated organisms
and the reaction of the host to the complex under different environmental
conditions.
At the outset, there are three aspects from which the control problem
must be considered: (1) Seed carriage of pathogens, and seed treatment;
(j) plant resistance; and (3) soil factors which include soil disinfection,
fertility, and cultural treatment.
Seed Treatment.
I he carriage of root-rotting fungi— llelminthosporium and Fusarium in
particular in or on the grain of wheat and barley has been demonstrated
by several, workers ( e , 19 , ,3 , 60 , ") and the use of black-pointed seed is known
to result in reduction in emergence, seedling vigour and yield of mature
plants. Again, the physical condition of the seed-coat is important, and it
has been shown ('“, 4 ", " 4 , " 7 , ot ) that damage from fungus attack in the soil
is especially liable to occur following the use of injured seed.
A feature worthy of investigation in connection with 11. sativum infec-
tions, is the influence of environmental conditions during maturation of
wheat grain, in predisposing plants to infection. -This is suggested from
the. interesting report of Dickson et al ( 22 ) who observed that strains of
spring wheat resistant to Gibberella saubinetii became susceptible and
yielded poorly when the seed was grown for one season in the hot, mid-
summer climate of central Illinois, while seed of the same strains ripened
at Madison, Wisconsin, produced plants which were resistant and which
yielded normally. Similar results have been reported by Bayles (’).
1 he control of seed-borne infection by steeping grain in hot water, solu-
tions of organic mercurials or by dusting seed with various organic mer-
cury fungicides has been studied by a number of workers ( s , 17 , ls , 19 , L ’ B ) and
the consensus of opinion is that while the fungus (//. sativum ) is not
always completely eliminated by seed treatment, its development is retarded
so that increased emergence and vigour of seedlings result.
Hut does disinfection of normal seed afford any protection against
infection from soil-borne inoculum during the early growth stages? The
work of Simmonds and Scott (*") and the writer have demonstrated that
soaking of wheat grain in semesan, germisan and uspulun (0.3 per cent,
solutions) or dusting with Dupont dust No. 12, semesan, uspulun, granosan
and copper carbonate effected a distinct protective action against infec-
tion from 11. sativum and F. culrnorum inoculated into the soil, and in soil
naturally infested, resulting in increased emergence. Similar results were
obtained by Machacek and Greaney (“) and Blair ( 4 ).


The writer’s tests in this connection were initiated in 3928, and were
continued over the ensuing three years. They were conducted at Cowra
Experiment Earm in small plots inoculated with 11. sativum alter tne
manner already described for the seedling blight tests conducted at t e
same farm; in each year, eight replications were employed lor each treat-
ment. Sound wheat grain of different varieties was dusted with one or
other of several different mercury compounds at the approximate rate of
3 oz. per bushel and was sown on 21st May-13th June by placing the treated
seed in immediate contact with the inoculum in the rows. Ihe controls
consisted of untreated seed planted in inoculated soil. Emergence counts
showed that dusting with semesan, semesan 13U, uspulun, Dupont dust
No. 12, and granosan gave appreciable control of pre-emergence blight,
the best results being obtained with granosan, which resulted m increases
of emergence over the controls up to 26 per cent. In no instance, however,
did fungicidal treatment of seed afford any protection against loot- and
root-rot development in plants in the adult stages; this observation is
based on seven years’ experiments in both small infection plots and in
large-scale plots in which dusted and untreated gram was sown by the
seed drill on land in which 11. sativum root-rot subsequently developed.
Machacek and Greaney O, however, report that m their field tests
organic mercury fungicides gave good control of root-rot caused by species
of llelminthosporium and Fusarium as indicated by the decreased disease
rating in mature plants.
Experiments conducted in the glasshouse with healthy wheat grain
treated with uspulun, semesan, semesan 13U, and Dupont dust No. 12 m
the dust form and the liquid form (0.25 per cent, for one hour at room
temperature during July), and planted in unstenhsed—but uninoculated
—loamy soil, gave results which showed that the emergence percentage m
every treatment excepting that with liquid semesan was appreciably
higher than in the case of the controls (untreated). The uspulun dust
resulted in an increase in emergence of 10 per cent. Copper carbonate
dust was also included in the experiment, and seed treatment with this
fungicide resulted in increased emergence of 12 per cent. Ihe determina-
tions of heights and dry weights of seedlings in each lot proved to be ot
no significance. The results of this experiment are similar to those re-
oorted bv other workers, and are interpreted on the basis of the action ot
the fungicides on seed- and soil-borne organisms, not necessarily recognised
parasites 0°).
Varietal Resistance.
It is freelv agreed that the development of resistant varieties is more
important in the ease of soil-borne parasites than in any other■ class, of
pathogen. But from the experience of workers m Canada, U mted t tates
and Australia C, ”, ”) it would appear quite evident that no quick
and easy solution to the foot- and root-rot problem (tf. sativum an F.
culmorum ) in wheat is to be found in varietal selection.
The writer’s field tests in inoculated soil, conducted over several years,
demonstrated that out of 100 different varieties not one was resistant to
Selmmthosparium root-rot. Observations m commercial crops-”" d P
varietal plots throughout the State over several years have shovn that

some seasons certain varieties displayed what appeared to be definite re-
sistance, but under other sets of field conditions these same varieties de-
veloped the disease in severe form. This is in agreement with the work of
Christensen ( l 7) and other investigators.
While in addition to common wheat ( Triticum vulgare), other species
of Triticum and the cultivated varieties of barley and rye are susceptible
to H elmintliosporium invasion ( IC , ”, " , 41 ), oats are highly resistant in
most instances C 2) and are known to be of great value in a rotation sys-
tem for foot-rot control.
Whether any practical application will arise out of Leeman’s conception
( r '°) that degree of susceptibility in wheat may be influenced by the addi-
tion to the soil of certain organic substances which, while not in themselves
harmful to a particular parasite, become detrimental to it when incor-
porated into the host protoplasm, remains to be determined. His in vitro
tests on the alteration of susceptibility of wheat to 77. sativum through the
absorption of extracts or secretions of micro-organisms open up new lines
for investigation from the control standpoint.
Viability of the Pathogen.
Turning now to the soil problem, the question of viability of inoculum
in the soil and on wheat stubble at once presents itself. It is well known
that 77. sativum possesses great sporulating powers (”) under widely dif-
ferent conditions and on different substrata, but in field soils fructification
is not of common occurrence ( 37 ) —due, no doubt, to the inhibitory effect
of other organisms—so that the carry-over of the fungus is mainly in the
form of mycelium.
It has been shown ( IC , ”, 35 ) that the pathogen can over-winter in infected
wheat straw in the field, and can withstand long periods of exposure to
low and high temperatures, fluctuating temperatures and variations in

the spore germination percentage fell considerably after exposure for
eighteen months, some conidia actually withstood the fluctuations of
winter and summer temperatures for almost three years. W hile this test
cannot be considered comparable with a test of spore material placed
strictly under the conditions obtaining in field soil —and the difficulty m
the latter case would be to ensure that only the original material was in-
cluded at the time of testing for viability—the result does give some idea
of the effect of field temperature fluctuations on spores when the moisture
factor is eliminated. The fact remains, however, that no precise informa-
tion is yet available in respect of the factors affecting viability of spores
and mycelium in their natural habitat —the soil.
Soil Disinfection.
The partial or complete elimination of root-rotting fungi from commercial
cropping land by the use of disinfectants would lie quite impossible from
the practical standpoint under Australian conditions, although in France
( 32 ) applications of 12J per cent, sulphuric acid at the rate of twelve litres
per are not only reduced the percentage of stems of wheat affected with foot-
rot (. Leptosphaeria herpotrichoides, Ophiobolus herpotnchus, Wojnowica
yraminis), but also gave increased yields in some instances. In small plots,
such as are used bv plant breeders, soil disinfection should be both practic-
able and valuable in some instances. This would apply particularly for
seedling blight control, although the question of re-infestation would doubt-
less be a limiting factor in some cases.
In planning tests with this object in view, it was considered necessary
in the first instance to ascertain the effects of fungicidal treatment on
emergence and general development in wheat planted on land not necessarily
infested with 11. sativum or other root-rotting organisms. Accordingly, in
Table 33. —Average percentage emergence of wheat sown at Cowra Experi-
ment Farm in plots treated with copper sulphate, formalin and water
prior to planting.
] 923, a series of plot tests was instituted at Cowra Experiment arm to
determine the effects on germination and growth of applying to the soil
copper sulphate and formalin in various strengths and at various periods

prior to planting— water being applied in the case of the control plots. Each
plot was widely separated from the adjoining one and consisted of four
25-link rows, spaced 1 link apart; fifty grains of Hard Federation wheat
—previously surface sterilised in mercuric chloride —were sown in each row
on June 16-20. High grade copper sulphate crystals were used in prepara-
tion of the solutions, while the formalin dilutions were made from com-
mercial formalin containing 40 per cent, formaldehyde. Preliminary tests
had shown that subsequent to the opening up of the four rows in each
plot, the application of 8 gallons of solution was sufficient, although not
too much, for the soil to absorb. Further experimental details are indicated
in Table 33 in which the results of the tests are also summarised.
It will be seen from the results in the case of the copper sulphate treat-
ments, that the average percentage emergence decreased progressively with
increased strength of solution in each of the three-day, one-day and one-hour
periods between time of treatment and planting, and that with each strength
of solution the figures for emergence were for the most part lower when
the applications were made one hour before planting than when made three
days or one day prior to planting.
It was apparent that with 0.5 per cent, solutions, satisfactory emergence
percentages resulted from treatment one day and three days before plant-
ing, hut not where applications were made one hour before sowing. Other
concentrations proved to be deleterious at all periods. The results do not
indicate a significant trend when the figures for “one day” and “three days”
are compared.
Good germination was obtained in the control sections. Inspections of
plots when the control plants had developed to the ten-leaf stage showed that
seedlings in the treated sections were stunted and yellowish, and generally
appeared unhealthy in contrast to the vigorous nature of the controls.
In the case of the formalin treatments it will he seen that in no instance
was there the severe reduction in emergence which occurred in so many of
the plots treated with copper sulphate—the greatest reduction, when com-
pared with the controls, being 13 per cent, in the case of the 1-50 strength
applied three days or one day before planting. Moreover, inspection of plots
during early growth showed that the general development and vigour of
plants in the treated sections were almost as marked as in the case of the
control plots. There appears to be no significant general trend in the
results for “one hour,” “one day” and “three days” in each of the concen-
trations applied. In experiments of this nature it is desirable that statis-
tical methods be employed in analysing data, but the general plan of the
work did not allow of this.
Examined when the plants were in ear, it was quite apparent again that
the formalin-treated plots were practically indistinguishable from the con-
trols, whereas in the sections treated with copper sulphate all plants had
died off in the early stages of growth. Owing to environmental conditions
root-rot diseases did not develop in any of the plots in the experimental area.
The fact that heavy rain was experienced just before and just after
initiation of the tests, doubtless explains the non-injurious effect on wheat
of the more concentrated solutions of formalin applied just before planting.
The results, however, justified further work on a known infested area, but
unfortunately that has not been possible.

The fact that H. sativum root-rot in epidemic form so commonly appears
in crops on land treated with superphosphate is further indication that this
fertiliser is of no value in minimising l the incidence of the disease.
Influence of Cultural Treatment.
It is generally agreed by investigators that the incidence of foot-rot in
wheat is readily reduced by fallowing, increase of humus content, and
rotation with oats ( ,2 , ss , 42 , ") provided pre-disposing factors such as frosts,
grazing, or excessive fluctuations in moisture —as demonstrated by the
writer —do not come into operation.
It is not proposed to review the Australian literature on this
the problem, as the same general idea is emphasised in each paper so far
published. The writer has previously referred to it O, and liis observa-
tions in respect of the importance of fallowing—based on fifteen years
Table 34.—Incidence of root-rot diseases in 50-acre commercial stands of

experience in New South Wales—are represented by those summarised m
Table 34. These data are of particular interest m view of the. fairly
comparable conditions under which the wheat was grown with the
exception that the cultural details varied considerably, thus permitting of

UP conspicuously in the Forbes district. It will be seen from the tabulated
dpta that wheat after wheat favoured disease development, as also did
grazing by sheep, and that even when fallowing was practised the disease
assumed appreciable proportions, except in those cases where the soil had
been cultivated four to six times during the eight or nine months prior,
to seeding.
Frequent cultivation of land results in increased conservation of mois-
ture, microbial activity, aeration, accumulation of nitrate nitrogen and
weed destruction (*), conditions which promote vigorous crop growth. It
is well known that vigorously growing wheat plants possess an amazing
capacity for production of secondary roots so that the extent to which a
plant is fortified against the effects of root attack by fungi would depend
to some extent at least on conditions affecting plant vigour which m turn
would determine the capacity for root replacement. Soils well-tilled and
adequately supplied with humus and moisture contain increased numbers of
micro-organisms ana lue mniulLlul u J
of pathogens by soil saprophytes has been given great attention in recent
years While this inhibition is usually attributed to exhaustion of food
supply of, and production of substances toxic to the parasite ( , , , ),
further work may show that the reduced parasitism is really due to acquired
resistance of the host following the intake of secretions of soil saprophytes
C). The fact that Ophiobolus grominis is more virulent on light soils
of poor adsorptive capacity is considered by Brommelhues O to be due
to the ready disposal in such soils of the toxins formed by the pathogen’s
saprophytic concomitants.
In the case of 11. sativum, it has been demonstrated that several
organisms ( 3 , IS , 30 , 3<i , “), including Trichcderma lignorum and Cephalothe-
ciurn roseum, are antagonistic, thereby reducing parasitic attack on wheat
seedlings; antibiosis, however, is perhaps of little importance in suppressing
seedling injury from diseased seed ( ). While the actual number of organ
isms in the soil is not the only factor in inhibition of pathogenic fungi—
the type of organism being quite important Garrett’s work ( ) indicates
that where greater numbers of micro-organisms occur in a particular sod,
reduction of disease may be expected. Therefore any set of circumstances
promoting multiplication of organisms in the soil —such as tillage during
warm weather following rains, when cultivation is normally done on wheat
lands —must be considered of benefit in reducing disease in most instances.
However, the fact that in the writer’s experiments conducted over three
years at Cowra Experiment Farm in a loamy soil, pronounced Helmin-
thosporium injury occurred in wdieat seedlings at early planting (tempera-
tures high)—more so than at late planting (temperatures low)—would
indicate that biological antagonism under some conditions is not of impor-
tance in limiting injury from 11. sativum, for in the case under considera-
tion there can he little doubt that inhibitory organisms were present in


appreciable quantity, more so at the early planting period when the antago-
nistic effect would be greater. Furthermore, Helminthosporium root-rot
has frequently been observed in all wheat-growing districts of the State,
and on soils of widely different type, varying from clays to light sandy
loams—the principle type being a medium red loam of granitic origin.
These observations imply that something more than mere quantity and
quality of soil saprophytes is involved in inhibiting parasitic attack, environ-
mental conditions being important in determining whether or not the
organisms will prove antagonistic to the pathogens. This is apparent from
the work of other investigators who have shown that temperature (“'),
acidity ( 8S ) and nature of substrate (”) may be of considerable importance
in synergy of organisms.
The partial or complete elimination of grass hosts on wheat land by
tillage is also an important aspect, for it has been demonstrated that
11. sativum attacks numerous grasses, and the seriousness of the carry-over
of virulent strains of the pathogen in this way —particularly on new land
—has been referred to by several workers ( lfl , ", u , 43 , “). First crops
on land previously under lucerne also frequently succumb to root-rot
diseases, and this is due largely to the presence of affected grasses amongst
the lucerne.
Continued cultivation of wheat on the same land is known to favour
root-rot diseases, and it has been suggested that loss of soil fertility is a
contributory factor in this connection, but Kussell ( 72 ) has pointed out that
short-term constant cropping to wheat does not result in any appreciable
reduction of fertility of the soil. Kichardson and Gurney however, ob-
served that the nitrate nitrogen content of stubble soil before seeding was
inferior to that of a well-worked fallow at the same period.
The detrimental effect of constant cropping is usually attributed to the
building up of additional reserves of virulent inoculum, a view expressed
by Bolley ( 7 ) over 20 years ago. But the studies of Broadfoot ( 13 ), Ziling
C 1), Greaney and Bailey ( 2R ) and the writer have shown that the relative
prevalence of either Helminthosporium or Fusarium in wheat is not signifi-
cantly affected more by one type of crop sequence or cultural practice than
another; that there is no marked tendency for root-rotting organisms to
accumulate in the soil during several years’ continuous cultivation of
wheat; and that bare fallowing does not appear to reduce their numbers.
In all cases, however, it has been found that fallowing and suitable crop
rotations minimised the disease. Therefore, the beneficial effect is not a
question of suppression of virulence of pathogens versus diminution in
quantity of inoculum in the soil, but rather is it a question of suppression
of virulence versus increased plant vigour enabling the plant better to
withstand parasitic attack. In the light of present knowledge, there can
be little doubt that the beneficial effect is due to a combination of both
factors—biological antagonism and crop vigour.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS, PART 4.
From the discussion of available evidence concerning factors related to
the control of Helminthosporium root-rot in wheat, the following main con
elusions are drawn: —
1. The pathogen sporulates freely on stubble and is capable of wit 1-
standing adverse conditions for considerable periods.
2. The control problem is complicated by the existence of grass hosts.
The development of resistant varieties of wheat is not a hopeful me
TTh. pathogen may be carried by the seed, internally or externally.
Trea.!ncnt P „f ?nfected'grain is of doubtful value. Treatment of normal
wheat seed with organic mercury compounds effects a protective action
against infection of seedlings from soil-borne inoculum, but no ov, * a ’;';
was obtained in the writer’s tests that such treatment minimised the
incidence of foot- and root-rot in adult plants. Reductions in stand and
yield may result from sowing of injured seed.
4 There is no evidence that Helminthosporium root-rot in adult wheat
can' be reduced by the application of fertilisers. Superphosphate, undei
certain conditions, minimises the incidence of pre-emergence blight, ircat
ment with formalin of infested soil in small field plots may be expected to
result in reduction of blighting in the seedling stages.
5. The pathogenicity of Helminthosporium may be suppressed by other
soil-inhabiting fungi, but it would appear that biological antagonism is
not so important a factor with H. sativum as with Ophiobolus. gramims.
6. Constant cropping of the same land to wheat results in increased
incidence of root-rot, and this appears to be due mainly to the reserves oi
virulent inoculum.
Frosts, grazing by sheep, or excessive moisture fluctuations frequently
result in severe manifestations of the disease.
7 Fallowing and suitable crop rotations are the best known methods of
controlling the disease in wheat. These practices result m increases m
numbers of the saprophytic flora of the soil, and m increased vigour o
plants, which therefore possess marked capacity tor production of second
arv roots. . , , i
The relative prevalence of Helminthosporium or Fusanum on the basal
parts of wheat is not significantly affected more by one type of crop
sequence or cultural practice than another; lienee the beneficial effect of
fallowing and/or rotation with oats in reducing disease is not a question o
suppression of virulence of pathogens versus reduced quantity of mocu urn,
but rather a question of suppression of virulence versus increased plan
vigour enabling the plant better to withstand parasitic attack.
The disease is likelv to be less severe when crops are sown on well-con-
solidated land and on land containing adequate reserves of organic matter.
8 Changes in the micro-flora of the soil may result in differences in
amount of injury in wheat from root-rotting fungi. Whether rn all cases
this is attributable more to differences in degree of antagonism between
pathogens and saprophytes, than to altered states of the host protoplasm
resulting from absorption of metabolic products or secretions of saprophytic
organism, is not known; Leeman’s work on the latter phenomenon opens up
interesting possibilities in respect of the Helminthosporium control problem.
