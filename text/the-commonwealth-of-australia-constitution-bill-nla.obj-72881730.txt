The Commonwealth of Australia
Constitution Bill.
MANIFESTO OF THE NORTHERN FEDERATION LEAGUE.
TO THE PEOPLE OF TASMANIA.
FELLOW CI
provide for without increasing the present burden of taxation. A
uniform federal customs tariff may, as some people have predicted,
yield a less amount of revenue than is now being collected on the
Tasmanian tariff. If it does the people will have to pay less customs
duties, and so gain what the Treasury loses.
Dtilmunte the union of the Australian Colonies in one
indissoluble Federal Commonwealth, under the Crown of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, is necessary to secure for
their inhabitants :
Federation will open the ports of Victoria, South Australia, and
eventually those of West Australia and Queensland, for the free
admission of Tasmanian products, just as the ports of New South
Wales are now open. Trade between this colony and its neighbors
must expand when relieved of all customs restrictions.
Defence of their hearths and homes against all foes ;
Free and unrestricted intercourse and trade with their neigh-
bours ;
Uniform laws and regulations on all matters which are of
common concern ;
With its great natural resources Tasmania has nothing to fear
from federation, but may gain much. Federation can scarcely fail
to facilitate the development of the island?s natural wealth, cause to
be used for manufacturing purposes the vast water power now
running to waste, and increase the prosperity and happiness of its
people.
Liberty to develop the natural resources of these magnificent
countries, without fear of molestation from within or
without ; and
Lasting peace and harmony between the peoples of the several
colonies ;
are urged to vote for the Commonwealth of Australia
Constitution Bill which has been drafted by the representatives of the
people, and is an instrument of government intended to secure for
them for ail time the aforementioned blessings.
The disturbed condition of Europe, Western aggression in the
East, the rise of Japan as a naval and military power, the presence
of large forces of armed men and ships of war within a few days 1
steam of Australia, make it imperatively necessary that these colonies
shall combine in a time of peace for mutual protection. We cannot
expect Great Britain to retain for all time the responsibility for oin
defence now resting upon her.
? It is a Constitution framed for a free people.??(Mr. Barton.)
? Nothing can be done under the Constitution which is contrary
to the will of the people.??(Sir Edward Braddon.)
? The Constitution is the most magnificent institution into which
the chosen representatives of a free and enlightened people
have ever breathed the spirit of popular sentiment and
national hope.?? (Mr. Kingston.)
It is necessary that six thousand votes be cast for the Bill tc
enable Tasmania to enter the federation. In the highest interests
of the colony and its people it is desirable that it should adopt this
Constitution, which gives to it greater constitutional rights than it
is likely to get under any other form of federal government.
? There is no danger whatever in accepting the Constitution
proposed under the Bill, and living under it, consistently
wuh being the freest people on God?s earth.??(Mr. Tren-
vvith.)
? If there is written in the book of destiny one fact clearer and
more significant than any other, it is the fact that sooner or later,
by some sort of contrivance or another, the whole of those barriers
which now separate Australians from Australians must come down.?
?(Mr. Reid.)
?This Bill is more liberal than any other Constitution in the
world.??(Mr. Deakin.) **
It gives the whole of the States equal representation in the
Senate, It enables Tasmania to send as many representatives to
the Senate as the largest and most populous colony on the Conti-
nent of Australia. It gives to Tasmania at the beginning of the
Commonwealth one more seat in the House of Representatives than
the proportion of her population entitles her to.
No more favorable opportunity than the present for breaking
down these artificial barriers will ever occur. Whatever difficulties
are in the way of removing the obstacles to Australian union are
removable by this Bill, and if they are not removed now they are
certain to multiply and become more difficult to remove in the
future.
The provisions relating to Finance and Trade have been examined
by Sir Edward Braddon, Sir Philip Fysh, Mr. John Henry, and Mr.
F. W. Piesse, all of whom have intimate knowledge of the social and
financial conditions of Tasmania, its natural wealth, and its productive
capacity, acquired by experience in the administration of the Govern-
ment of the Colony, and they agree in advising the people of
Tasmania to adopt the Constitution, because they are of opinion that
by entering the federation on the terms laid down in the Bill the
colony will incur no monetary responsibility that it will be unable to
�hevx fjare you are earnestly appealed to to do your duty
as citizens of Tasmania, of Australia, and of the British Empire, by
voting for federation on June 3? for by so doing you will assist in
the great work of welding together these now divided colonies, and
help to unite their inhabitants with the sacred bonds of nationality.
We are all of one race and speak one tongue, our interests are
similar, and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia is
an instrument of government that will make us
