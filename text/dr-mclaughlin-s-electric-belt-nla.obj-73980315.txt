?A MESSENGER OF CHEER.?
From a Painting by Moreau of Tours,


Introductory.
This is the electrical age. We are passing through a period
which is prolific of invention upon the lines of electricity, and it is
fitting that great improvements should be made in the adaption of
Electricity for the cure of disease, and of the many weaknesses
from which men suffer. No branch of electrical research has offered
such great inducements, such marvellous possibilities, for the better-
ment of mankind, as the improvement of the methods of applying
Electricity to the human body for the restoration of its vitality.
Experience, coupled with faithful and con-
sistent study; observation of the need of the bllilt
sickand weak, combined with an ardent ambition OH stclte*
to produce the means which would most effec- merits of
tively battle with the elements which create facts
distress of mind and body, have enabled me to
produce a most wonderful method of applying electricity* to the
human system, and I am gratified with my success, not only in having
perfected an appliance which overcomes all objections to the use of
electricity, and which absolutely cures, but by plain and honest state-
ment of facts; by appealing to the judgment of suffering people and
by having built up the largest business of the kind in the world.
With thousands of cures already accomplished, and thousands of
grateful people who are shouting their words of gratitude for their
deliverance from the horrors of pain and weakness, as an assurar.ee
of future success, I anticipate still greater results from my efforts to
demonstrate the truth of my life-long claim, that ? Electricity is the
basis of all animal vitality, and without it we could not live.?
These words will bear deep study, and to you who seek health,
I commend them and the many other truths in this book.
? Dr. M. A. McLaughlin.


A Discussion of
Dr. McLaughlin?s Methods.
It has been demonstrated that Electricity is the most natural of
all remedies for the cure of the ailments which afflict the human
body. Every physician of modern ideas is an advocate of electrical
treatment, and concedes that it stands far above all medical agents,
especially when applied to diseases relating to the nervous system.
This is a practical admission of the power of electricity over the
nerves and vital organs, hence it must be evi-
dent to a thinking person that a means of intel- Great boon
gently applying this wonderful agent should be
the greatest boon to suffering humanity. " �
Twenty years of close association with men humanity
and appliances devoted to the cure of human
ills with electricity, is the foundation from which Dr. McLaughlin?s
improved methods have sprung. Twenty years of study, of practi-
cal experience in the treatment of the diseases most susceptible to
electricity have brought forth all the virtues, and exposed all the
faults, that have existed in the methods that have been used, and
have given an experience which should qualify such a student, such
an enthusiastic advocate of the modern methods of electro medical
treatment as Dr. McLaughlin has been, to develop a practical
system of self-treatment which must produce results pleasing to its
inventor and enormously successful as a cure for bodily ills.
The Dr. McLaughlin method of to-day is the result of this expe-
rience. The appliance which is termed an Electric Belt for the
sake of description has nothing in common with any other of the
many contrivances sold throughout the country, under the name of


Result of ?Electric Belt.? It is different in construc-
tion, in material, and especially in the method
twenty years 0 f application ? it is a finished, scientific appli-
of experience ance, the product of mechanical skill backed
by a perfect knowledge of its object and of the
best way to accomplish it.
To acknowledge that Electricity will cure disease is to concede
the power of Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt, for in this appli-
ance are embodied all the elements of a perfect electrical treatment;
it has sufficient volume to saturate every nerve and vital organ of the
body with electrical force; it pours this life into the body for hours
at a time in a slow, continuous stream, which is acknowledged the
most effective method of apph ing electricity, and the vitalizing cur-
rent is directed into the body in an intelligent manner, suitable to
the individual case under treatment. These
are the elements which have made its great the
success possible, and which should commend it
to the favorable consideration of every person U�\V method
in need of electrical treatment. trial
To those who have tried other methods,
outside of electricity, we would say, consider the great advantages
offered in this method of treatment, the invigorating influence of
electricity upon nerve life, and upon all the vital parts of the body;
consider the close relationship between electricity and the vital
element, and you will realize what a great influence it will have upon
your health ; how much strength it will infuse into your body, and
how great will be your ability, possessed of its life-like energy, to
withstand the encroachments of all manner of disease; for this
Electric treatment not only cures, but fortifies the system ever after.
The Dr. McLaughlin method has been successful where many
others had failed to relieve. It is a special treatment, and wi I
cure when all else fails ; it will cure any case that Electricity,
backed by intelligence, can cure, and justifies the honest investiga-
tion of every health-seeker. *


Facts to Prove that
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt
is a Natural Cure.
When we consider that our nervous system, which is the
fountain of life to the kidneys, liver, stomach, brain, and all organs,
and the various organic functions of the body, depends for its
sustenance upon the vitalizing element of electricity, and that
without this life it is impossible to keep up a normal condition of
health in the body, it is easy to understand
that a waste of this life principle will be Nerve life
followed by weakness a-nd disease, and it is
7 IS
also easy to understand why the natural restora-
tion of this electric force in the nervous system electricity
will saturate the various vital organs which
have become weakened, with a new energy which will place every
vital part of the body in a state of natural health. Thus, it is under-
stood that the element most
necessary in our bodies is elec-
tricity, as it is electricity which
generates nerve force, and the
nerve force is health, or the
source of health, and without
it we cannot live.
The utilization of this
great principle has been greatly
retarded for the want of a
proper knowledge of the means
necessary to generate the


Origin of electric currents demanded to reach the weak-
ened functions, and indeed, until very recently,
OUT new the on |y apparatus that could be obtained was
methods both inconvenient and costly, so that only those
possessed of ample means and fully acquainted
with the science of electricity could avail themselves of this most
effective remedy.
This rendered it vastly important, and, indeed, indispensable,
that self-applicable treatment should be contrived, that the vast and
valuable properties of electricity could be accessible without the ser-
vices of a medical electrician. It was therefore highly desirable that
some simple, inexpensive, but efficient means should be found that
would produce and apply electric currents with no more incon-
venience than is experienced in the use of ordinary remedies;
and it was to meet these requirements that
Dr. McLaughlin invented his Electric Belt. A simple
Always alive to the needs of those to whose common-
health he has devoted his life, Dr. McLaughlin
has from year to year added improvements to
his invention, until he has brought it up to the
highest state of perfection, embracing in this simple appliance a
means of saturating the system with electricity in a mild, strengthen-
ing manner, enveloping the suffering part in a gentle and continuous
galvanic current which will infuse health into it each day without
interfering with the usual habits of the patient, and providing a
simple, common-sense cure which well deserves the immense
patronage which it is now enjoying in all parts of the civilised
* w
world. Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt is a modern remedy,
a simple and effective means of regaining health, which will con-
tinue to grow in popular favor as the people become better
acquainted with its virtues. It is no exaggeration to say that it is
to-day the most extensively used of all known remedies for the cure
of weakness and disease, and that it has more permanent cures to
its credit than any other known remedy.

A Few Words about our
Famous Belts.
We claim for this Belt that it is the best Electric Belt in the
world at the present time, and is the only body Belt ever invented
in which the electrical power can be changed by the wearer from
a very mild to a very strong, powerful current, without removing
the Belt from the body.
This Belt is scientifically made, and yet very simple in its con-
struction, and is composed of from thirteen
double to eighteen triple battery cells, and (Jail be
the battery is so arranged that the patient can
use the electric current from the mildest force WOm by
to its full power, as the invalid may desire, either SQX
and so regulate the current of electricity as
may suit the patient. This we claim can be done by no other belt
ever invented. The change is made to the different degrees of
power by means of a regular attachment, and can be done in a
moment of time, and one Belt is enough for a family of six or
eight, as it is worn only from three to six hours a day.
The Belt possesses everything that is desirable in an electro-
galvanic body Beit, viz. : ?i. A mild or strong electric current, as
the patient may require. 2. Can be worn by male or female, at
any kind of labor witli any kind of dress without the least incon-
venience. 3. It will last for years, and with good care will last a
life-time.
We have met few patients who could wear our belt when charged
to its full capacity, and it should be borne in mind that we only use
one-fourth of vinegar and three-fourths of water, hence our Belt


j j will last four times as long as any belt where
you have to use clear vinegar. In our museum
will oUtl3.st can seen samples of all the electric and
any other galvanic belts that are known and are now on
the market for sale, and we stand ready to
prove to the satisfaction of any invalid who may call on us that we
have the best electric Belt in the world, and also that we make no
statement but what we can prove. We publish no testimonials
without the full name and address of the writer.
* # * *
Who has not at some time or other been afflicted with a sudden
pain, which demanded immediate attention, and, no physician being
handy, felt the need of some remedy that would give quick relief?
What a God-send it is, then, to have at hand such an article as
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt, which
gives immediate relief in all local or transient Keep it
pains, inflammations or irritations. Severe con-
stipation, which often threatens inflammation of house
the bowels, is relieved sometimes in two hours.
Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Headaches, etc., are
quickly relieved. Considering its vast benefits in all ailments, its
cost is trifling.
? * * * *
The Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt is the very latest im-
proved and is entirely different in construction from all other belts
and devices, and it is charged by simply dipping the metal batteiy
in a little vinegar and water, when it will retain a strong current
that can be felt by the wearer for twenty-four hours. We warrant
it for one year, and with care it will last a life-time, and can be
worn by different members in a family. Ihe amount usuallv
expended for doctor?s bills in a few months will purchase one ot
these Belts, which will protect you from sickness and disease for
life. It relieves the patient of the continued use of drugs, and
offers a cheap and efficient protection from all kinds of sickness.
10


_ This Electric Belt is a valuable substitute
53,vc vour
for medicines and medical treatment of every
medicine name and description, and its cost is infinitely
money small in comparison when taking into considera-
tion the following : Most invalids and ailing
persons pay out in small sums, or at one time, from 12s. to 40S.
per month for doctor bills, secret and patent medicines. These
outlays, in the aggregate, will in three or six months or longer
amount to considerable money. Compare even the lowest aggre-
gate expenses for medicines, etc., during a certain period, with the
expense attending the purchase of an Electric Belt, and the money-
saving advantage the latter offers will be apparent. Ihe Belt is to
be purchased but once, is ever ready for use, and will prove more
valuable and economical in curing diseases than a family medicine
chest or any kind of medical treatment. The
money expended for medicines proves a dead You buy
loss, and patients are little, if any, better off
than before using them. The effects of all
drugs are pernicious, as they produce by regular blit otlC6
use a ?drug disease,? and if continued for a
long time derange the stomach and other organs irreparably. Why
sensible people will make ? drug shops ? of their stomachs is an
unsolved problem.
* * * *
As every purchaser of an Electric Belt desires the best made,
and as it is difficult to determine, from the representations made
by different concerns, which is the best, we offer to send to the
parcels office of anyone wishing to inspect the Dr. McLaughlin
Belt any grade of Belt he may choose, for fice examination
before purchasing.. After the Belt has been examined, if satis-
factory, the price may be paid to the express agent and the Belt
taken out; if not as represented it may be returned at our expense.
Send 2 Shillings with order to cover express charges. This will be
deducted from the bill.

Bright?s Disease of the
Kidneys.
Bright?s Disease is a disease or the kidneys displaying itself by
the presence of albumen in the urine Principal among the symptoms
ot Blight s Disease is that pain in the loins known as lame back,
although a lame back in itself may precede the disease some con-
siderable time before the disease sets in. The urine is sometimes
scanty and sometimes very profuse; when scanty it has a thick,
muddy appearance, when profuse it is much
lighter in color than in its normal state. In | bfick
an advanced state Bright?s Disease is occasion-
ally accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea.
We think it of far greater importance to symptoms
acquaint the reader with the symptoms accom-
panying the approach of the disease than those of the disease itself.
As before stated, the most marked precursory symptom is the well
known ?lame back.? The skin sometimes will assume a yellow,
parchment-like appearance, or it may be that the complexion will
only be slightly deteriorated There is a peculiar puffiness under
the eyes, and the sufferer not only has a haggard and worn-out look,
but seems to dread the approach of some impending ill. In fact,
the very dread of the disease itself may in many cases be looked
upon as a symptom of its approach.
* * * *
It is very often the case that the urine during this period may be
in a perfectly normal condition and even upon analysis will not reveal
the presence of the albumen which indicates that the disease has
actually set in ; but it is none the less important, that most energetic


�
It should be Steps should be at once taken to ward off its
, , approach. This can be most effectually done by
the treatment of Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric
quickly Belt. In Bright?s Disease this Belt may be
looked upon as a God-send to suffering hu-
manity, for the simple reason that no medicine, in fact no hitherto
known treatment, has proved of any great avail. Drugs, in many
cases, make matters worse; it is for that reason that the sufferer
should be extremely careful in his choice of treatment. Hundreds
can testify to the extraordinary healing power of our Belt, and the
testimonials are symbolical of many others received by us.
Almost every disease of the urinary organs manifests itself by
some bladder symptom, and that symptom is usually what is termed
irritable bladder; that is, the patient passes urine more frequently
than natural, with or without pain. Such symp-
toms may indicate the presence of a severe or Qur Belt
fatal organic disease, and frequently, when per-
mitted to progress to an aggravated state, lead promp
up to most serious complications. to aid
Difficulty in passing urine may be produced
by a stricture or partial closing of the urethra by an enlarged prostate
gland, or weakness in the nerves or muscles of the bladder. When
there is inflammation of the bladder itself, there may be a desire to
pass the water too frequently, and great pain before and after its
passage. These conditions are all affected by the curative action
of an even continuous current of electricity passing from the kidneys
at the back, through the bladder and urinary ducts. Immediate
benefits have been found in the use of the Belt in these complaints,
and through its invigorating the nerves and muscles all the proper
functions of the kidneys and bladder are revived, impurities are
carried out of the bladder and a general healthy state resumed in
all the affected glands. We have the greatest confidence in the Belt
in these complaints, and the number of grateful letters shown from
people who have been cured is the best evidence of its merit in all
troubles of the bladder and prostate gland.

Electricity as a Curative.
Ihe knowledge gained in recent years from close study of
the scientific treatment of disease has placed electricity in the fore-
ground as the one and only successful remedy?the only remedy
known to science which cures disease without injuring the mem-
branes of the stomach. With the growth of this knowledge
electricity is fast superseding all other plans of treatment in the
great variety of chronic, nervous, and functional diseases, especially
those that are due to a decrease of nervous vital power. Among
the various remedies placed within the reach
of man for these many diseased conditions, i* > ,
~ , ii is rue
none is so well adapted as electricity, since it
is easy to ascertain its curative powers in all Cure devised
diseases by observation and expeiiment. Its by nature
effect upon the various functions is evident
immediately upon application ; it can be applied directly to the
diseased or weakened organ; and can be continued or checked
in its action at a moment?s notice \ in powerful contrast to the use
of drugs taken internally, which leave the patient in ignorance
as to the probable effect, or to the extent
of the good or bad results until the force
of the drug has been spent. The wearer
of our Belt knows, also, that electricity
applied in this way cannot help being
beneficial, no matter what his ailment.
It is, first and last, an invigorator?a
natural source of vitality and every
moment that it is used adds to the fund
of healthy force in the system. Such
a remedy as this must secure favor.


A Few Words to the Afflicted.
We are daily in receipt of letters from the afflicted, many of
whom say they have been basely deceived and humbugged by
charlatans and their worthless, deleterious compounds. These
unhappy victims, from improper treatment, have not only nearly lost
confidence in human nature, but are almost without hope themselves.
Poor, unfortunate, young and middle-aged men not only write us
pitiful letters regarding their unhappy state, but in many instances call
upon us in person. Nearly all of them are unanimous in the statement
that the drug dosing which they have undergone
has not benefited them in the slightest degree, Drugs Otten
but has left them much poorer in health* and in complicate
purse. In fact, the little recuperative power the
which nature had left them to build up an-ew on
had been almost entirely destroyed, besides
complicating the original complaint with other diseased conditions of
the system. And why not, does not every thinking person realise
that the daily pouring of drugs into the stomach is contrary to the
laws of Nature ? Does not every sane man know that nearly every
drug is a poison, an unnatural stimulant, whose object is to arouse,
excite, and irritate the delicate organs of the body, so that they may
show temporary signs ot the energy
they have lost? It requires little
reflection to convince any student of
anatomy and physiology that no
permanent good follows the use of
any kind of drug, for each and every
dose is a false promise to the afflicted
part.
15


Drugs may Dru S medicines and other advertised nos-
stimulate trums taken into the stomach, which if not
but seldom ln j ur * ous > are a s a rule utterly powerless, to
reach and act upon a set of delicate and sen-
sitive nerves and tissues that are abnormally
weakened and diseased. These nerves, ducts, glands, vesicles,
cords, etc., in their very nature, need the tenderest care and treat-
ment, Drug medicines may at first temporarily stimulate the
system and allay nervousness, but in the end tend to derange the
digestive apparatus, thereby increasing indigestion and constipation,
?and through this means clogging up the liver, kidneys, and bladder.
This causes reaction, which increases-the involuntary or unconscious
waste, and thus still further aggravates the bail symptoms, and
renders a permanent cure less easy and less speedy.
1 o directly reach the weakened organs, and
to quickly strengthen and invigorate them, Nature
can only be done through the nervous centers
ot the system by the mild, constant, soothing prescribes
and invigorating current of galvanic and mag- electricity
netic electricity of quantity, which the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt and Suspensory impart. The first
thing to be done in any vital weakness or general debility, is to stop
the unnatural waste or loss of vitality. This, drug medicines, adver-
tised nostrums, even if they possess tonic properties, rarely if ever do,
as the temporary stimulation which they may impart is more than
offset by the astringency which they produce in the bowels, which
increases the waste at stool, during urination, and unconsciously in
disturbed repose, arising from indigestion. Again, if the drug be of
a purgative character, nearly a similar result is produced, as anything
which has a tendency to violently disturb the action of the bowels,
liver, or kidneys, also helps to aggravate the unconscious waste.
Such being the case, sufferers, instead of receiving the expected
and hoped for relief, finding themselves, after a time, much worse,
are disappointed, discouraged, and soon become hopeless of
16


Sufferers ever being cured b y drL, g medication - And well
they may be ; for in the first place, the treat-
become ment is irrational and unnatural, and in the
discouraged P^ ace > if it is not altogether worthless, it
is positively injurious in its chemical and physio-
logical effects upon the system. We have hundreds of these doubly
unfortunate victims come to see us as a last resort, who, through
the employment of quacks, and the use of advertised nostrums,
were not alone bankrupted in health, but much depleted in purse,
likewise. With sufferers like these we deeply sympathise, and fully
appreciate the doubt and uncertainty which fill their minds in
venturing to try a new remedy, with which, through inexperience,
they are but little acquainted. Heretofore, hope and confidence
have been high within them, through the alluring and deceptive
promises which have been held out to them by
unscrupulous quacks and impostors for the sake D eceD fJ
ot gain. Actuated by the first impulse of Nature,
they have made every laudable and earnest effort P rorr J ISCS
to overcome their unfortunate condition; have G f quacks
sought, upon occasion, every available means
within their reach to effect the same, at the expenditure of con-
siderable money, to be in the end disappointed, discouraged, mayhap
swindled, and worse, ruined in health and less hopeful and confident
of permanent cure. Is it any wonder then, that the sufferer is
doubtful, suspicious, incredulous, even when plain, honest truths
are presented to him, which, under more favorable circumstances,
would at once appeal to his intelligence and common sense ? An
aggravated case of general debility of itself invariably begets in the
patient an unnatural suspicion and distrust.
* * * #
''** ? . ,
It is our earnest desire and constant purpose to cure sufferers,
otherwise we would positively decline to take hold of their cases, for
we would sooner lose a dozen sales of the Dr. McLaughlin Elec,
trig Belt than to fail in the cure of one of our patients. Let us here


Q ur remark, that while we believe the practice of
medicine in many cases to be somewhat experi-
constant menta]) we nevertheless do not ignore the good
aim is to which obtains from the well-directed and intelli-
cure gent efforts of the reputable and skilled regular
practitioner. We seek rather to aid him in his constant endeavors
to overcome diseased conditions than to dispense with his services
altogether. Consequently wc are in perfect harmony with the objects
of the regular medical profession, as the application of the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt in nowise interferes or modifies any
course of medicine or system of treatment which physicians may see
fit to prescribe or pursue in conjunction with its use. However, in
all cases where practicable, we would much piefer that the Dr.
McLaughlin Appliances had free and independent action, so
they will receive the credit which they deserve
for the beneficial and curative results which Co = Operating
they invariably accomplish. with
# # # *
We are at all times disposed to assist the physicians
regular practitioner in the use and application of
our Belts, and offer him every facility in our power to that end, and
are happy to state that hundreds in the profession are using them in
their practice with the most marked curative results in cases of general
debility and kindred disorders. The Dr. McLaughlin Appliances
carry out the true idea of the progressive physician, that to be
curative in functional, nervous, or vital diseases, medico-galvanic
and magnetic electricity must be imparted to the nerves and muscles
under the form of mild, close, constant currents of quantity which
the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt alone generates.
This method is known to be far superior to the old style battery
current, as any one knows that when nerves are weak, sensitive, and
easily upset, it is not the shock and jar that invigorates them, but
the warm soothing influence of the continuous cunent, which pours
its vitalizing force into them slowly, constantly, and gives them
plenty of time to absorb it.

A statement When the patient is in doubt as to the kind
should and power of Belt and Suspensory he may need,
always be s^ us a statement of his case, and,
sent a^er the same has been carefully examined, and
we feel and know that he can be cured, we will
honestly and frankly tell him so, and under no circumstances will we
advise the purchase of any of the Dr. McLaughlin Belts if we
believe the case incurable. But we claim that every case has the
elements of cure within it ?so long as the patient can move about,
eat and sleep, and has no structural degeneration. Patients will
please bear in mind that we do business on an honorable and legiti-
mate basis, and that in no instance will we countenance anything
otherwise. We give to the least and poorest of our patients the
same attention and consideration that we do to the richest and
highest. Having once taken hold of a case, it
will have our fullest and best endeavors until Rich and poor
the patient is finally cured. Such being the .
, . . , . , receive same
fact, even in cases of the most obstinate char-
acter, we rarely, if ever, fail to effect a perma- consideration
nent cure. It is daily being demonstrated that
the constant and mild current of galvanic and magnetic electricity of
quantity, as induced by the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt and
Suspensory is not only the best and most natural remedial agent in
all vital weaknesses of a personal nature, but that it will cure when
drug medicines and all other systems of treatment have failed,
because it is applied in a natural way, and is a simple aid to Nature.
* * * *
It is in vain to say to the sufferer from the effects of general
debility, ?Amuse yourself; employ your mind; go into society;
seek agreeable conversation ; forget your weakness,? etc. So long
as the cause of his disorder is not removed he is unable to profit by
this counsel. How can it be expected that when a man is fatigued
by the least exercise he can occupy himself walking or at labor ?
How can he go into society when the simple presence of a woman
20


How Can a intimidates him and recalls all his former misfor-
tune ? How can he enjoy conversation when he
WPH Iv mnn
loses its thread every moment, when his memory
enjoy life? leaves him and he feels his nullity? Why per-
suade him to seek amusements and pleasures?
Are they such to him? Is not the happiness of others his greatest
punishment ? Let us first remove the cause of the patient?s disease,
and then his character and conduct will change, and lie will return
to his natural tastes and habits. The Dr. McLaughlin Electric
Belt and Suspensory speedily removes the cause, not by treating
the symptoms, but by curing the affections by which they are
caused, hence their wonderful success in Organic or Vital
Weakness or any Functional Disorder. When these ailments
are removed manhood in all its best elements will return.
The patient should not be discouraged, nor
despond, as his case is undoubtedly curable if There Is
taken in due time and properly treated. When the 111 a
( irculative System is greatly at fault, as it is in
all such cases, it is not the result of a few days or Chance left
weeks of carelessness and neglect, but of months
and even years of slow but steady undermining, hence to speedily
and permanently bring about a restoration of the general health and
many vigor requires strong and effective treatment, and some little
time. Ordinarily you can tear down faster than you can build up;
but with such a potent remedial and curative agent as the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt and Suspensory, disease is over-
come in a wonderfully short time. Again we would say to the afflicted
that hundreds who have exhausted all the resources of their family
physician, with little or no benefit, have speedily found health and
happiness through the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt and
Suspensory. These statements are made in simple truth, and
ought to be known by the afflicted everywhere. Unfortunately, many
sufferers become discouraged when they fail to obtain relief at home
in the usual way, and often strive to reconcile themselves to their
21

elsewhere, fearing that they may again be dis-

diseases, but, on the contrary, they almost uni-
versally prove injurious. They are no more opinion is
adapted to reach these cases than a dose of good �
ipecac or jalap is to assuage a mother?s grief for
the loss of her darling babe, for, the disease being largely local, the
restoratives must be applied directly to those prostrated parts; and
since electricity is undoubtedly the instrumentality of all life it
necessarily follows that this element constitutes Nature?s own most
potent remedy in these diseases, when rightly applied.? Here, again,
is pointed out the necessity for intelligent, scientific application of
the electric current, which has the element of vital and nerve force
in it if given in the right manner. The study and practice of years
has taught us how to apply this wonderful agent successfully, and the
patient intrusting his case to our hands may be sure of deriving the
very best results that are to be had from properly applied electricity.

?Railroad Back.?
A common ailment among men, whose business keeps them on
the railroad cars a great deal, is what is often termed a ?railroad
back. I his is particularly applicable to conductors, engineers, and
trainmen, who spend most of their lives over the jolting, jarring
trucks, the vibrations of which cause a disturbance of the spinal
nerves and muscles, and a resultant weakness of these parts.
The symptom is a dull, heavy pain in the back below the kidneys,
where the general muscular system joins the spine. It is a habit
with most railroad men to press their hands
upon this spot, and, when they sit down, to slide Jt is
down on the seat so as to bring the pressure on
the weak point. This shows that the muscles are a CO *T! mon
loose and flabby 3lillTlcrst
and the circulation
poor. Frequently this complaint leads
to a complication of weaknesses, afifect-
ing the sexual organs and kidneys,
and if some remedy is not used in
time to check the cause a general
debility is likely to follow.
-Kailroad back? -is frequently
mentioned in the many cures by Dr.
McLaughlin?s Electric Belt. Its
wonderful strengthening effect is im-
mediately noticeable when applied upon
the seat of the trouble, as shown in
the illustration in this book. A con-
stant even current of electricity is made
2i.


Our Belt to permeate the muscles at the lower end of the
. spine, adding strength to them with each
makes a .
application. Ihe muscles are drawn back to
quick cure their normal shape, filled with elastic energy,
and the pain is quickly overcome. The effect
of this current is carried throughout the entire nervo-muscular
system, the kidneys, and sexual organs, and all complications are
quickly and permanently removed.
# * * *
It has often been stated, and by the leading men of the medical
profession it is generally admitted, that the want of vital nerve force
in the body is the greatest cause of disease. If the nerves are well
charged with the vital element?electricity?they are enabled to
keep up a vigorous and regular action of all the organs of the body;
so that the latter are able to carry off the waste
matter through the natural channels, preventing \\fQ
this getting into the blood. This reduces the
chances of disease to a minimum, and gives a COlTieS
free, healthy action to all the vital functions, Hlcctficity
which makes it possible to bring organic and
muscular force up to the highest state of perfection.
The strongest claim made for Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric
Belt is for its upbuilding of the vital nerve force. The greatest cures
accomplished by it have been through its wonderful power in this
respect. Saturating the nerve cells with electricity in less than 30
days converts the system into a perfect galvanic storage battery,
and while this life is retained in the system by living in accord
with the laws of nature, disease becomes almost an impossibility.

When life 11 is gladdening to the heart of a physician
who has an interest in the recovery of his
is filled with patients to note the change of manner which
sunshine takes P ossession of a y� un S man during his re-
covery from a deep seated nervous disorder.
The transition from gloom to sunshine is pictured in every line of
his features ; his heart seems bubbling over with joyous feelings, the
old expression of care and uncertainty, which was ever present
during his mental suffering, is gone, and has given place to light-
hearted confidence. He is full of animation, ready with question
and answer, discusses affairs with abandon, giving the impression
that life to him is one vast playground, into which he loves to dis-
seminate the joy which is breaking its bonds within him. How
different is this young Hercules from the haggard, despondent boy
who applied to us a few weeks ago ! Eyes that
were downcast, dull, and surrounded by the tell- 6 WOl*
tale rings, indicating waste ofnerveforce, are now must kflOW
bright, sparkling with joyous feeling; the rings of His
are gone and the pupils are full of expression, gratitude
His step is quick, and his chest expanded to
make room for the increased vitality. He tells the story of his re-
covered health as if he had just escaped from a dungeon in which
lurked misery and death. His gratitude for the means of his new
lease of life is expressed in his radiant features, and he vows that
the world shall know of the agency through which he has been
enabled to once more face his fellows as a man among men.
Instances of this kind are of daily occurrence in our offices, and
lend a charm to the life. It is a great thing to feel that you have done
an act of kindness to a fellow man. The knowledge that thousands
of young men have found health, strength, and manhood, in all that
the word implies, in our method of treatment, and that they have
acknowledged to the world the cause of their new found existence,
is pleasing to us. It fills us with a desire to increase the scope of our
work, and to make even greater endeavors to teach the facts to those
27


Do yOUr who st -ill doubt that Electricity, intelligently
applied, is the fountain-spi ing of youth, from
which all may drink the richness of vitality, and
yourself regain the energy which has been lost through
ignorance and recklessness.
It is the duty of every man, young or old, to remove all these
evil effects of past folly; a duty that he owes to himself, to his family
and friends, and to those who may hold him responsible for their
existence. It is a duty which he should not shirk when the chance
is offered him to regain all the manly force that he has wasted, when
there are so many examples about him of the truth of every claim
that we make. Let him, therefore, be true to himself, and procure
this aid before his strength has gone be; ond reca 1. Renew the
wasted energies, revive the youthful ambition, and make the young
manhood what nature intended it to be ? great
AND GLORIOUS. If yOU HCCd
We assume that the man who reads this has oy j- help
decided that he must get medical aid?is seek-
ing it, else he would not have written us, would don t delay
not have this wcrk, which we thrust on no one
unasked. Whatever may be the cause of his incompetent condition:
whether overwork of body or mind, unrestrained dissipation, past
illness, or inherited ills, it is now that he should determine to over-
come all unfavorable conditions which are likely to affect his future.
The natural forces are in his favor, and Mother Nature will lend
her aid toward building up now more freely than in after years.
The condition should not be allowed to become complicated
and chronic by neglect. Debility, nervousness, and all weaknesses
may be supplanted by strength and buoyancy, new life infused,
confidence, ?pluck,? and light heartedness established as a new life
legacy by the use of Nature?s remedy?electricity as applied by our
Dr, McLaughlin Electric Belt. The many hundreds who
have given their unsolicited testimonials to this firm should be
convincing of what we can do for you.

A Regulator to Control the
Power.
This is one of the features which have made Dr. McLaughlin?s
Electric Belt a success, and caused it to be sought alter by thou-
sands of sufferers who had tried electricity and electrical appliances
in other forms. It is a well said truth that electricity is a blessing
when under control, but worse than useless otherwise. An electric
belt, the power of which cannot be controlled, is usually either too
strong or too weak, the wearer having no means of adapting it to his
purposes. In this belt, however, we have a perfect regulator, the
only instrument manufactured which will modu-
late the current on a scale of six different de- No more
grees of power at the will of the patient. It is, burnf? Q r
in fact, the only instrument attached to an elec-
tric belt which will regulate the current. ft blistering
renders the use of the belt a pleasure and over-
comes all inconvenience. The greatest advantage that can be
possessed by one electrical appliance over all others is that of giving
all of its'curative power without the inconvenience which is so
common to electric belts. Every one who has used the old style
belts knows how, if they give any electricity at all, they burn and
blister the skin, sometimes making their
use unbearable. This has been entirely
overcome in our late improved regu-
lator, which controls the current at the
will of the wearer. When the hand is
at strong,? the full force of the current
is turned on ; as it is moved toward
? mild,? the current gradually becomes
weaker, and can be turned off altogether.
29


Rheumatic Pains.
The very first matter we wish to call to the attention of sufferers
from this disease is the marvellous influence we have found our
treatment to exert in this as well as all diseases of the Kidneys.
Since the introduction of our methods years ago, we have seen our
belts used in many thousand cases where all other treatments had
failed and have had the satisfaction of seeing a large majority of all
completely cured, and the rest benefited to an extent to place them
in average good health with the rest of mankind, and we unhesitat-
ingly say that where our belts are given a fair
trial, and the patient is really not beyond help, Cripples
we know that they will cure more cases of the Have beeil
above disease than all other known remedies freed from
combined. We trust that every sufferer will crutches
call on us or write to some of the many whose
certificates we give in our testimonial sheet, because we believe a
cure within the reach of nearly all.
To justify this belief we have the experience of years of success-
ful combat against the disease; of thousands of patients?cured by
our Belt, some of them in a few days? treatment, and nearly every
one of them failures in the treatment with drugs. We have seen
cripples, who had leaned on crutches for months, lay aside their
supports and stand firmly on their feet and cry out in gratitude that
they were free from pain ; we have received letters from patients
who had been Rheumatics for thirty and forty years, and got their
first actual and only permanent relief from our Belt.
To Rheumatic sufferers we feel it necessary to say that different
organs and structures of the adult human body are in a condition
of continual change. Waste and repair balance each other. When
putritious food, of proper quality and quantity, is furnished to

Cause for ever ever rom disease, Rheumatism, The
from the success attendant upon the use of Dr.
. . , McLaughlin?s Electric Belt in the fol-
lowing Rheumatic and kindred diseases is
now a matter of record : Soreness and stiffness of the muscles and
joints, restlessness and suffering on touch and movement, distorted,
deformed, and impaired use of limbs, feet, hands, neck, and back,
atrophied muscles, lumbago, acute and chronic syphilitic Rheu-
matism, and affections of the heart and kidneys, resulting from
Rheumatism. In the testimonials we give will be found scores of
cures, and they are worthy the fullest attention of every sufferer,
for, of course, they are interested in proving what we have done so
as to form a reasonable basis on what may be done.
* # * *
Lumbago differs from Rheumatism very mate- -UnibagO
rially, in that the pain is of the nature of a dull, from cold
heavy ache. It exists always at the lower end of
in bdck
the spine, between the joints of the hips. Its cause
is mostly from cold, exposure to dampness, and
over-working in stooping positions. When a person is predisposed
to lumbago a slight cold is likely to settle in the lumbar region and
cause intense annoyance. Its cause also is different from Rheuma-
tism, as its comes mostly from congestion of the circulation. The
action of the blood is interrupted ; the tissues are congested ;
there is a pressure upon the veins and nerves, and the pain results.
Intelligence in the use of our Electric Belt will overcome the
trouble quickly, as has been demonstrated in thousands of cases.
The nature of the trouble is congestion, which is quickly dissolved
by the negative current applied directly over the lumbar region.
This calls for a current of strong volume flowing from the stomach
or abdomen to the back, and the first infusion of this current
loosens the congestion, gives an impulse to the blood, and cleanses
the tissues of all impurity. A permanent cure will result from the
use of a strong power Belt in from two to eight weeks.

_ , ~ . The Sciatic nerve extends from the lower
Sciatica, a , ,
part of the hip joint to the buttock, passing down
paitl in the the back of the thigh. The nervous affection,
hip & thigh known as Sciatica, receives its name from this
circumstance, and is one of the most distressing
of this class of disease, often coming on without warning and imped-
ing the motions of the lower limbs. When the entire nerve is
involved, the patient is deprived, by pain, of sleep, and often there
may be symptoms of fever ?a hard, rapid pulse, with thirst and
coated tongue. In older cases cramps are often experienced, accom-
panied by sensations of tingling and numbness, and in the chronic
form there is shrinkage and a sense of coldness in the limbs. Ex-
posure to cold and dampness, especially in those approaching old
age, are predisposing causes of this disease, which is often very
sudden and sharp in its attacks. Electricity,
applied by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt, c, ojllc cages
we have found to be a positive remedy. As will
be seen by many of our testimonials, we have CUl*ed in 3�
time and again so relieved sufferers that they tyjinutes
would leave their bed in less than 30 minutes
after putting on our Belt, and be at work in a few hours. We
positively believe that our Dr, McLaughlin Electric Belt,
applied and used as we direct, will cure every case of Sciatica.
* * * *
It is impossible to use too strong a Dr. McLaughlin Belt, as
the current from the strongest as well as the mildest is given in such
an even, soothing manner that the nerves have plenty of time to
absorb it; therefore there is no shock nor jar, and should the Belt be
worn longer than is necessary the excess supply is thrown off by
the system, which will take in only a certain amount of the fluid.
The use of a very strong belt is always in favour of a quicker, more
certain cure, and it has been proven that where a very low power
Belt may be strong enough to cure, the very strongest can be used
safely, and with a greater certainty of permanent cure.

The Progress of Twenty Years.
It is only within the past twenty years that progress of any note
has been made in the application of electricity for the cure of
disease. True, it has been used, in one form and another for a long
time, principally by the physician?s battery, and, in many instances,
with good results. It was through the success attained by physicians
in making local application for a few moments of the battery current,
and because of the inconvenience incident to this method, that
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt was invented. With it came
a period of wonderful development, and the
Electric Belt is now the most efficacious means The new way
of applying Electricity to the human body. ,
t m / , ? compared
It is well known that of the various forms in
which electricity is used, there is none which with the old
j /
compares in value to the even continuous flow
of the current into the system. The greatest disadvantage that phy-
sicians have to contend with in using a battery is the impossibility of
applying the current in a volume mild enough to be absorbed by the
nerves. Be it understood that the human nerves and the vital organs
dependent upon them are extremely sensitive, and electricity given
from a battery shocks and jars them to such an extent that the result
is more frequently injurious than beneficial, hence the need of the
mild, soothing currents of galvanic and voltaic force generated by
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt. From this appliance the
power is absorbed by the nerves as a sponge absorbs water, until
the entire nervous and organic system is saturated with its life giving
force; its power is felt for hours at a time, and can be regulated to
any degree the patient may desire. It is by far the most modern
and nearest perfect appliance known for the treatment of disease.


The Nervous System.
The nervous system is best described as an immense electrical
machine, of which the spinal cord is the power-house and the
thousands of nerves leading from it to all parts of the body the
system of electric wires, intended by nature to convey power to the
intricate machinery of the body. These nerves are the channels
through which each vital organ derives its electrical energy ?the
force which is needed to keep the vital action up to its healthy
standard. Every artery, every vein, ?no matter how insignificant it
may appear to be?every gland and tissue of the
human anatomy, 'ffig nerves
are each supplied
with a delicate COflvey life
network of nerves, to all parts
which convey in
their elastic tubes a thrill of electric
life which gives them power to act,
renders them responsive to the will
power and alive to the sympathetic
influence of the brain. The main
centre of supply is the spinal cord, and
of course the health of all parts of the
body depends upon its being able to
furnish sufficient energy to keep the
machinery of the body going. If the
supply is depleted, the vital action
weakens. So long as the power-house
generates enough electrical life to sup-
ply the nerves with what they demand,
52


Electricity is tliere is > and must be > a P erfect state ofhealtb)
the moment it ceases to do this some organ of
the basis of b o( }y slows down, as a piece of machinery
nerve power will when the power is shut off, and if the
depletion continues other organs will follow it,
until, there being no revival of the supply, every vital part of the
body will show a disposition to cease work. Now comes the
wonderful influence of electrical treatment. The fault is at the
power-house, which is unable to supply the demand made upon .t
by the thousands of nerves Electricity is applied in a gentle,
continuous stream to the spinal cord, filling its empty cells with
renewed energy , storing in it daily a new volume of electrical life,
which, added to that already stored there, feeds the impoverished
nerves, which convey the power to the machinery of the body,
renewing the action and restoring vigorous health.
* * * * Look out
The sale of promiscuous, cheap, and so- c | iea pjy
called Electric Belts has been so general for
the past ten years that we frequently find made belts
patients who are actually surprised at the dis-
covery that Dr. McLaughlin?s Belts really do give a genuine
current of electricity that can be felt by the patient as soon as
applied. Many who have been deluded by contrivances sold at
4s. to �\, finding them frauds, seem to conclude that all electric
belts are built on the same plan. This is the greatest mistake that
could be made. There is not a valuable invention on the market
to-day but has its imitations, and these are hawked on the street
corners and peddled in the country homes under the guise of the
genuine article. A few days always convinces the purchaser that
they are worthless imitations and the use of them a waste of time.
This has aroused a deep suspicion against every other article
bearing the name of belt, but a fair test of the Dr. McLaughlin
appliances is always sufficient to correct the false impression.
Cheap articles are usually poor ones.

Dyspepsia, Indigestion.
When a patient says, ?My food does not agree with me ; it
sours on my stomach, and my appetite is treacherous. I suffer
great distress after eating certain kinds of food, for which I have a
great liking. I have to be very careful as to what I eat,? it is Dys-
pepsia, and the least of the suffering is upon the stomach, the origin
of the trouble, for this condition produces the most disagreeable
train of symptoms in its aggravated form The stomach is in active
sympathy with the brain and nervous system, and Dyspepsia pro-
duces nervous prostration, gloomy forebodings,
nightmare, depression of spirits, organic ex- Q ur Belt
haustion, sleeplessness, as well as many other .
indications of a breaking down of the general e ' S 1
vital forces, all in sympathy with the stomach, the stomach
Electricity, properly applied, will cure it. It
begins from weakness, from a lack of vital activity in the secretory
glands of the stomach, from a want of sufficient gastric juice ; hence,
a remedy which will arouse these parts, stimulate them to action,
infuse them with vitality, will cure the cause and the disease. Our
Belt will do it. The study of years has taught us that the stomach
is, in health, a veritable galvanic battery. It generates electricity,
which is heat, warmth When it breaks down it carries every other
vital organ with it. Dyspepsia comes when its capacity has been
overtaxed; it is not able to furnish the energy needed. Hence, a
steady, gradual infusion of electric force into it renews its power,
arouses its inactive function, revives the secretive action and restores
the machinery to a healthy state. The stomach begins anew to
throw out sparks of electric life to the whole vital system, and a
state of perfect health is restored.


The Force of Vitality at
Different Ages.
t J
It is almost universally assumed-by those who have thoroughly
invest,gated the subject-that the human body reaches its maxi-
mum of development at the age of thirty years. At this period, if
men have not injured or abused themselves, and have attained
then- natural strength, the body generates, by its own chemical
processes, so much Electric Force, as shall enable it within given
bounds to work its own machinery ? to call
forth, at will, a limited measure of extra force, a f
and so supply a fluctuating loss that may be ACtIVe ?
conveyed away from it through any cause. r eSefVe, and
The body yields, therefore, to Active Force, waste force
Reserve Force, and Waste Force; and these,
under ordinary circumstances, are sufficient to? maintain the perfect
organism in effective life. So much Active Force gives the body
power to perform so much labor; so much Reserve Force supplies
it with a power to perform a measure of extra labour to meet einer-
gencies ; so much Waste Force enables
it to resist the external vicissitudes
without trenching on the supply which is
ever wanted to keep the heart pulsating,
the chest heaving, the glands secreting,
the digestive apparatus digesting, and
the brain receiving or thinking.
It we should use the active force
too long, by over taxation of any
organ, we become exhausted and call
56


Bxcesses upon the reserve ; if we still continue the pro-
exhaiK t cess, we at * ast ? s^ee P forces ' tselt u P on
us and brings with it the rest it insures, a renewal
nerve force of power. If, again, we are robbed of this waste
force quicker than we can supply it, exhaustion
is produced ; insufficient control over the nervo-vascular system
succeeds, and therewith causes the congestive condition of the
lungs and other organs, under which death is so easy.
That exhaustion should be more rapid in the man who has just
reached his prime is but natural. In his past he has been growing,
developing his body, and in the course of development he has used
up an excess of force commensurate with the demands of his
growth. When he stops in development and stands on a fair level
with the external forces that are opposed to him, then his own
force, for a short time balanced, soon becomes
second in command. At middle
At middle age and old age he feels cold a^e
more tenderly ; if his rest is broken, his demand
for artificial heat is more urgent; if he lose or begins to fail
miss his food he fails rapidly. Now, if these
causes affect the healthy, middle-aged man, they still more disas-
trously affect the unhealthy, or the one who has not attained his
growth, or the one who has passed beyond middle life. Has he a
weak point in the vessels of his brain ? He is more liable to pressure
and rupture, with apoplexy as the consequence. Is he suffering
from weak lungs? His evils are double. Has he a feeble, worn
heart ? It sinks under the strain put upon it. Has he enfeebled
action of the kidneys ? He is threatened with complete obstruction.
Is he indifferently clothed and fed ? He is subjected to intestinal
derangement or congestion, and their resultant effects.
It is from these and kindred causes that the mortality of disease
runs up so fast. Pressure of blood on the brain disposes to apoplexy,

disease The lesson we learn from all this is that
Nature demands and must have sufficient
vitality with which to feed the pulsating machinery of the human
body. When the body itself is not capable of generating this vitality
it must have assistance from the outside. The means of assisting
must be natural, else the object aimed at is lost, hence, what will
furnish the power needed but Electricity, which is the basis of all
vital force? Our method of treatment in this condition is studied
and intelligent. We know what is wanted, and know that unless it
is supplied there will be a failure of the vital action, bringing serious
consequences. We aim, therefore, to apply our Belt-so as to infuse
the nervo-sexual centres with its vibrating life,
pouring warmth and energy into the nerves first
daily, until each and every nerve cell is charged the
with it and vigorous health has been restored,
the reserve force re-established, and the organic reserve fotXC
body invigorated with a supply of inexhaustible
vitality, which will prove valuable as a fund of energy with which
to enter the period of old age, when the demands upon Nature are
daily increasing, and when, of all periods in the life of man, vigorous
health brings blessings beyond price.

In aged or elderly men the recuperative power?s so slight that it

weakened tissues ; harden and contract the flabby, relaxed muscles ;
enrich and purify the impoverished and poisoned blood ; increase the
sluggish circulation; tone the stomach ; restore action to the con-

liver, and bring the man back to his natural condition. He has tried
drugging the stomach, etc., and yet he is worse, fails rapidly, and

energies. In this case there is no energy, dormant or active; hence
an attempt at stimulation only paralyzes what little force there is.
New life must be supplied, new nerve strength, new vitality. That
we give with our Belt in a natural manner. If reason did not teach
us the truth of these remarks, the hundreds of old men who pro-
claim their gratitude for our method of treatment must do so.

While we have not anything to say either for
or against any other electric or magnetic goods, We have the
but simply concern ourselves with our own, we
would nevertheless here most emphatically and
affirm, based upon abundant testimony, expe- best made
rience, and scientific truth, that our Appliances
are superior to and different from anything of the kind yet made.
No other electric, galvanic, or magnetic belt, band, or other device,
can generate the mild, close, constant current of quantity, except
the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt and other Improved Appli-
ances. This may seem a bold assertion, but we have the proof
positive, not only in the peculiar construction of the Dk. McLaughlin
Belts themselves, but in the letters patent from the Government
of the United States and the Royal United Kingdom, which
protect and secure to us alone these important results.
In this Belt, with or without the Suspensory attachment, the cur-
rent is magnetic as well as electric, thus giving the patient the benefit
of all the curative effects of electricity, galvanism, and magnetism.
This, we say most positively, without fear of successful contradic-
tion, no other appliance of the kind yet made or invented can do
60


It will build Anyone reading this book must, ere this,
have come to the conclusion that Electricity,
any part applied by this method, must be good for
or organ wasting or weakness in any part of the body.
If he has not, we wish to point out to him in
such a way that he can readily understand the
matter, that weakness, debility, or a run-down condition of any of
the organs, no matter from what cause, is a result of either direct
or indirect loss of the nervous energy in the part. If a man over-
works his stomach he is bound to suffer, Nature punishes him;
and if he overworks or abuses any part of his organism in any
manner, she will manifest her displeasure in a way that must very
soon become noticeable to the indiscreet. Over-indulgence of any
of the organisms of the human machine deprives the part of its full
integrity, causing the organ so abused to lose its full value as a
functional part of the body.
The part so abused must resent the ill-treatment in one way or
another according to the functional work it performs. In any event
one thing is certain, and to either the casual or the interested reader
of this book, it must be apparent that he knows what is going on.
He must know, ere this, that the vitality of the organs is wasted,
that he has driven out that potent force with which Nature provides
him, and he must know what this force is. We have endeavoured
to show him that Electricity is the potent, the vital element in the
human body, and if he wants back his wasted vigor, he must
replace it with the same element of which he has been deprived.
The power of Electricity generated into the body adds vitality
to the general system. Directed to any special part it increases the
blood supply to that part. This must necessarily give more strength
to the tissues, and as blood is the fountain of life in the tissues of
the body, it is readily understood that if it can be supplied to the
parts in greater quantity than is necessary to enable them to do
their regular work, that it must add more vigor than they have,
and to impaired organs of the body more strength supplied than is


required gives Nature a chance to reassert herself, gives her a chance
to rebuild, because she has more material to work upon. Hence,
a healthy and vigorous condition must be the ultimate result.
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt provides the means of
directing the current of Electricity to any part of the body, there-
fore its great value as an invigorator.
It matters not what may be the nature of the weakness, it results
from a lack of full vitality. A limb may shrivel or shrink Elec-
tricity carried to and through it, must increase the blood supply
and impart new life and vitality. Thus it is easily and readily seen
that the same effect must be achieved by an application in any
direction.
It is vastly important, of course, that the current be properly
directed, and therefore the adaptability of our Electric Belt becomes
apparent.
Nu matter in what part of your body the trouble may be, it can
be reached, and the results must be the same in any case. Apply
the current, and you impart new life and energy.
* * * *
We have yet to meet with a failure in curing the most aggra-
vated case of nervous or functional disease, where our Belts have
been used according to our advice. We have found some cases
more obstinate than others, owing to the complications being greater,
and in such we had to use stronger Belts, but as we in such
exchanges allow a reasonable price for the first one bought, the
patient is perfectly protected. Particularly remember that we will
forfeit if any one of our Belts from �x up fails to give a
current which can be instantly felt when properly charged by the
patient, and further, that we absolutely guarantee every belt to last
one yeai, or be replaced by a new one.

Avoid Cheap, Worthless Belts.
With reference to cheap electrical appliances the public should
be placed in possession of a few facts. The market is flooded with
so-called ?galvanic,? ?magnetic? and ?electric? belts, braces,
bands, girdles, etc., which are so poorly and crudely constructed,
and of such worthless material, that when tried they prove to be
valueless and utterly devoid of curative or strengthening virtue.
Many persons, misled by false claims made for them, have been
led to purchase these articles, because they were cheap. 1 hese

tentious charlatanism, do not hestitate to charac- Buy Only

intelligent people have reached this conviction, to l)G Held
They could fall into no more serious error.
When carefully constructed, upon the best known scientific prin-
ciples, and of suitable materials, belts, bands, etc., worn upon the
body and which communicate a constant electrical stimulus to the
system, have been pronounced by em-
inent physicians to be of inestimable
benefit. In regard to cheap belts,
then, we will say, to afflicted persons,
try them if you must; but, when con-
vinced, as you will undoubtedly become,
of their utter worthlessness, come
to us and get a good one. The Dr.
McLaughlin Electro-Magnetic Belt
is not a cheap one; it cannot be made
cheaply, and therefore cannot be sold
cheaply. But you will find it an electric

and applied to the body, and with care will last
SIX people for many years, and can be worn by different
members of the family. We can refer to many
instances where one Belt has cured six or even more persons, so
that its cheapness cannot be disputed, everything considered. It
should also be borne in mind that while using the Belt, the patient
from time to time receives competent, professional advice, which
often is of equal value to the use of the Belt.
Remember particularly that everything about our Belt is
warranted for one year, and if anything should break or get out of
order it will be repaired free of charge. As to power of currents ;
we guarantee our Belt will generate stronger and more lasting ones
than any other belt or appliance made.
Bear in mind also that we positively guaran- The latest,

expensively made than any other electric belt in
the world. It has all the latest improvements and best
known to science, including our patented regu-
lator, which is possessed by no other belt made, and, most important
of all, our Belts are adapted in every instance to the particular case
under treatment, so that good results are bound to follow their use.

The strength and activity of the natural animal electricity
which a man possesses is the measure of his menial and bodily
vigor; and when it falls below the normal standard, through
excesses, overwork, etc., an impaired condition of the functions of
both body and mind inevitably ensues, so that in general terms
disease may be regarded as a disturbance or lack of the proper
electrical conditions of the body, rendering the harmonious actions
of the various organs impossible, and it is only by a renewal of the
vital force that disease is overcome. This is in a few words our
treatment, as the electric current from our Da. McLaughlin
Electric Belt fully supplies the needed force.

Can I cure Myself?
Will the Belt Cure? We answer most honestly and frankly,
Yes. We speak from personal experience, and the testimony
of thousands now well. Were you to see the letters we receive,
and the people who call personally at our different offices all
over the world, and read and hear what they say, you would be
more emphatic in saying that our appliances do more than we
say they do. Read the testimonials we send you with this book,
and notice the wonderful reports of dozens who have been taken
out of bed in a few hours, after suffering for
months and even years; also the many we few
have cured who have been given up to die by
doctors and friends. Questions
Will any one know that lam wearing answered
one? We answer, No; unless you tell them.
It can be worn at all hours without the least
inconvenience or trouble, while at rest or any kind of labor. It
fits perfectly, and cannot be seen through your clothes, no matter
how tight or neat fitting your clothes or dress may be.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CURE ?
We are often asked, How long will it
take to effect a cure ? We can only say
that it depends upon the nature and
length of time of the weakness or
disease. Ordinary cases are cured in
from one to two months; in very ag-
gravated cases from two to three months,
and in some we have found it necessary
to use our appliances six months. These,
of course, were very severe cases.


Always For ordinary cases the medium belts are used;
send a for old, chronic cases, the stronger power. But
in ordering always send a brief statement of
statement your ailment, because our advice is often of as
much importance as the Belt, and we wish to
treat our patients only one way, and that is the right way.
How LONG SHOULD THE BELT BE WORN AFTER I AM WELL? As
a general rule, after you find your physical or nervous weakness, or
any ailment from which you have been suffering, entirely overcome,
it is well to wear the Belt at intervals for a month or so afterwards.
It can be taken off at any time and put on again at your pleasure.
When the system has recovered the tone, strength, and vigor needed,
the Belt can be laid aside, or occasionally worn to prevent other ills.
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt can be worn at any time, at
work, or during sleep. It is, however, desirable
to use it when the patient is resting. A favorite YOU Can
time, and the time when its effects are most wear it at
pleasant, is between ihe evening meal and bed-
time. Three or four hours? use will usually an\ time
saturate the system with the life giving current,
and the Belt may then be removed, though it can be worn constantly
for twenty-four hours without any fear of overcharging the system,
as the body becomes as strongly electrified as the Belt itself after
three to six hours? use, and there is therefore no possibility of
getting too much electricity in the body.
It is a source of great pleasure and satisfaction to us to know we
conduct our business on strictly truthful and honest principles, and
prosper despite the unscrupulous means employed by our numerous
competitors in their endeavor to gain fame from the good work we
have done during the last twenty-five years, and are still doing.
This pamphlet contains a great deal of information and encourage-
ment for those afflicted with any kind of the troubles upon which it
treats, but there is nothing said which our past and present success
does not fully warrant us in saying, and which cannot be relied on.

Electricity will cure where
Medicine fails.
Skilful, scientific medical treatment has accomplished a great
deal in the relief and cure of the various ills which afflict humanity,
and it seems strange, indeed, to the majority of sufferers, that weak-
ness or debility of the generative organs should be the one ailment to
resist its efforts. However, it is not the purpose of this work to leave
the impression that all such cases resist the skilful use of medicine.
There are certain peculiarities in the constitutions of some patients
which are favorable to drug treatment, and many instances can be
cited where this method has cured. But while
giving due honor and credit to medical treat- Obstinate
ment, it must be admitted that in the majority
r ? f J cases can
of cases, owing to the fact that the weakness
is primarily of the nerves and the organs sup- be reached
ported by the nerves?over which medicine
has no direct influence, it must fail, since it can do no more than
stimulate the general nervous system at the expense of the stomach.
It should be borne in mind also, in this connection, that this stimula-
tion of the nerves, through the functions of the stomach, is unnatural
and therefore injurious. The use of the stomach as a channel for
the passage of the many deleterious ?tonics ?and stimulants, in
many cases irreparably injures the membranes, ruins the digestive
functions, and leads the way to permanent debility.
* * # *
In this age of electrical enlightenment we are sure every reader
ot this pamphlet well knows that the power of current of an electric
belt, or any other electrical apparatus, is determined by the power of
the battery which generates the current, and hence it is needless for
us to make any lengthy explanation of the fact that the number of
conducting discs on a belt does not determine the power of it. The
public are well acquainted with the fact that there can only be two
poles, the negative and positive, in any battery or belt.

To Men who Work.
The occupations which men follow are often responsible for the
breaking down of the physical structure. Men are prone to commit
excess, in labor as well as in pleasure, and the body is often worked
beyond its capacity. Very often, without perceiving any injurious
results at the time, the strength is severely taxed, and the reserve
force reduced. Frequent recurrence of the strain finally brings on
the inevitable collapse, and we have a broken down constitution to
mend. Following are a few of the special symptoms which develop
in men of various occupations.
Mechanics, Miners, Laborers, Farmers, Sea-
men, and all men who have laborious duties to
Our Belt
perform, often find that the muscles of the back will Cure
become weakened, the kidneys, from continual
strain begin to decline, the legs get weak and these men

Clergymen, who are suffering from general debility, over-brain-
work, anxiety, etc., followed by biliousness, constipation, and indi-
gestion, will find in Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt that which
will relieve constipation, allay nervousness, and assist nature to
restore an equilibrium necessary to perfect health.
Lawyers, worn out by the fatigue of hard study and laborious
court trials, so that wakefulness takes the place of sleep, will find in
this Belt a soothing action which will relax the high nervous tension,
allowing nature?s own restorer to do its perfect work.
Journalists, with brain perplexed in preparing food for the literary
stomach amid the street din and office disturbances, can have no

disturbance.

sufficient amount of physical exercise by reason ot their daily seden-
tary habits, need a tonic, and that which will replace the animal

system this life-giving element, that compensates for the lack of
exercise in the open air.

incumbent upon a single trip, which so debilitates the whole human
system, especially preying upon the kidneys, stomach, and liver,

Belt to counteract these influences, with which he challenges all
other electric or galvanic appliances, as a curative agent, now in
existence, and which, if worn according to directions, will produce
results that will be a ? God-send ? to the wearer; an investment
never regretted.

The following Section of this
work is devoted exclusively
to Women.


Maiden, Wife and Mother.
To the Maiden.
Crossing the threshold of womanhood, with vague
fears of the uncertainties of the future, with wonder and
amazement at the things revealed to her by nature, and
to whom a few words of advice may bring happiness
and health ;
To the Wife.
Beginning to realize the great responsibility she has
assumed, and feeling the encroachment of disease upon
her delicate constitution as a result of the absence of
sufficient vitality to keep the body in a state of health ;
To the Mother,
God bless her! who has given the sweetness of her life
to the nourishment of her offspring, and whose nervous
and physical body is deprived of the vigor nature intended
it to possess :
To these, with the hope of doing good, this work is
most respectfully dedicated by
Dr. M. A. McLaughlin.


Magnetic Personality.
The power of individual electricity is manifested in social life.
We often meet with persons of both sexes whose features and
forms are not pretty, nor their mental endowments striking, but
who are still very attractive. We say of some lady, ? She is very
fascinating, but not at all handsome ; there is something about her
very agreeable, although she is far from being mentally or physically
prepossessing.? Now what is this mysterious something but her
individual magnetism which she unconsciously uses in commanding
the respect and admiration of her acquaint-
ances? She in fact magnetizes every one she Magnetism
meets, and makes them admire something about
her?they do not know exactly what. So � rea tef than
wholesome is the influence of this animal beauty
magnetism upon the person of its possessor
that it is possible for a plain, or even coarse featured woman to out-
strip her more fortunate (?) sisters who have been given regular
features, in the admiration of men. There is an attractiveness about
a magnetic woman which men cannot resist. She is admired and re-
spected for her power to command the hearts of her acquaintances.
This magnetic influence is born of electricity generated in large
degree by the human battery. When depleted the Dr. McLaughlin
Bult will restore it by renewing the electricity of the body.
* * * *
? If it were not for my large practice among women, I might as
well take down my sign,? was said by a physician whose name was
a household word. What a pity ! And why is it so ? The only
reason seems to be that a woman hates to quit the ?old doctor.?
It has gotten to be that he looks upon her as a life customer, and
he will drug and dose her until death robs him of his fees.

How Can I Thank You ?
? How can I thank you for the great blessing of health which I
have received from your God given remedy?? asks a grateful patient.
What a world of gratitude is contained in this message from one
delivered trom the agony of despair ! Let it go straight to the hearts
of the thousands of suffering women and carry to them its fragrance
of jo} ous inspiration. Let it carry hope and encouragement to those
who live in misery from the manifold ills of womankind. Let it
proclaim in accents which can find no words to describe, how great
and far-reaching is the health-bringing power of
Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt. Prejudice
A woman who has since childhood looked
upon the family physician as the embodiment of mU^
wisdom, and trusted to his resources alone for laid aside
relief from growing disabilities, can never realise
the wholesome beneficial effects that are to be derived from this
method of electrifying the tired and weakened nerves, and can never
give due credit to the remedy which Nature has laid at her door,
until she makes up her mind to consider it practically. Lay aside
the prejudice arising from childhood?s teachings, and realise that
the world moves and that the remedies of olden times are not the
lemedies of to-day, that new discoveries have brought forth new and
more effective methods of treating disease.
# # * *
If the women of this age would realize that neither all the drugs
in the world nor any one or combination of them contains the
ingredients which will restore nerve and organic strength?it would
i educe the number of poor miserable creatures who swallow more
drugs than food and whose stomachs are ruined for the want of
healthy nourishment.

No. 7, Price �lO.
This magnificent Belt contains every improvement that is
necessary to be embodied in an electrical appliance for body wear,
with triple silver-plated battery of great power, with non-irritating
silver-plated electrodes, having the special patent chamois
non-blistering covers. There is in addition a very powerful
current-diffusing Disc, particularly for women.
In smoothness of current and easiness in the mode of permea-
tion, coupled to simplicity and elegance of its general appearance,
it is perfect. It is intended for those cases requiring a generally
strong current of equal distribution to affected parts, in which it is
desired to have the greatest possible comfort with the speediest
results.
The price includes all attachments that your case may require.


Debility and Exhaustion.
The most thorough examination of the subjects of nervous
exhaustion generally fails to discover any organic disease in any part
of the system. Many such patients look so well that few would
suppose them to be invalids; their nearest friends often believe
their complaint to be imaginary. But if we examine into their
symptoms we discover that the action of the heart s slow and
sluggish, sometimes it intermits or skips a beat; they are easily
startled, undecided and timid, fearful of making ventures; there is
at times a great despondency and loss of
energy, a gloomy, hypochondriac state of mind, Loss of the
a feeling that recovery is impossible, and a rin sof
morbid fear of sudden death. They complain
of wakefulness, falling sensations in the sleep, womanhood
frightful dreams, nervous trembling, sudden
concussions in the head, and many other symptoms. The digestion
is weak and the powers of assimilation, or the nutritive functions,
impaired; flatulence and various dyspeptic symptoms are complained
of; the complexion is sometimes noticed to be sallow and sickly,
and the patient has an anxious and melancholy cast of features ; she
is unable to endure much exertion of any kind, and her mind is in no
condition for mental labor, household duties, or pleasure. The physi-
cal stamina seems bankrupted, and it is for the time; her muscles are
weak and flabby, and there is a noticeable loss of flesh and strength.
These are the results of over-exertion, neglect of the laws of
health, great mental strains, grief or anxiety; and, in many cases,
over-indulgence in different forms of dissipation and unnecessary
waste of nerve force, and the victim is plunged into the most
miserable condition in which it is possible for a woman to exist.
Many sufferers, despairing of relief, prefer death to such a life.

Electricity It is exactly in this peculiar condition of ner-
vous exhaustion, functional weakness, general
tones up all debility, or by whatever name it may go, that the
Vital parts Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt produces
the most- remarkable results ; and the greater
the degree of exhaustion, the more utterly prostrated all the vital
functions appear, the more astonishing and emphatic the benefits of
this treatment. As the functional and nervous system is toned up
by it, all the symptoms enumerated, and many others not mentioned,
gradually disappear, the whole system shares the general recupera-
tion, the drain of vitality is checked, the natural vigor of all the
organs returns, and the patient speedily finds herself stronger,
physically and mentally, than she ever was or ever expected to be.
The necessity for a due proportion existing between the develop-
ment and strength of the nervous and muscular -
systems has always been recognized. Unfortun- Women tflX
ately the restless, energetic and ambitious spirit ie | r powers
which actuates the people of this country
has prompted a plan of education which, by its tOO greatly
severity, creates avast disproportion between the
two systems and its effects are more especially exerted upon the female
sex, in which the tendency to such loss of balance is much more
marked than in the male. Girls of tender age as well as women of
more mature years, find it necessary to apply their minds too con-
stantly and to tax their intellects by efforts of thought and memory
which are too prolonged and laborious. The results are a lapid
development of brain and nervous system, precocious talent, refined
and cultivated taste and a fascinating vivacity on the one hand, and
a morbid impressibility, great feebleness of muscular system and a
marked tendency to weakness in all the delicate organs on the other
hand. These statements no physician will deny. Here the mild,
soothing, and invigorating current from Dr. McLaughlin s Elec-
tric Belt is effective. It produces a natural contraction of the
relaxed cords and gives them strength at the same time. Relief

The patient should not be discouraged nor method Cures
despond, as her case is undoubtedly Curable if
taken in due time and properly treated. When the General System
is greatly at fault, as it is in all such cases, it is not the result of a
few days or weeks of carelessness and neglect, but of months and
even years of slow but steady undermining, hence to speedily and
permanently bring about a restoration of the general health and
womanly vigor requires strong and effective treatment and some little
time. Ordinarily you can tear down faster than you can build up;
but with such a potent remedial and curative agent as the Dr.

their family physicians with little or no benefit

drU�TS fail AND PPLIANCES - This statement is made in
simple truth and ought to be known by the
afflicted everywhere. Unfortunately, many sufferers become dis-
couraged when they tail to obtain relief at home in the usual way,
and often strive to reconcile themselves to their miserable condition
instead of making an effort elsewhere, fearing that they may again
be disappointed, when without such effort they must continue
miserable while they do live, and fill untimely graves. These
should clearly and distinctly understand that nervous exhaustion,
and the different discouraging symptoms which accompany it,
never cure themselves. To them we would say, do.not despond,
for there is strong hope for a speedy and permanent cure for you
in the use of the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt. Sufferers
can rely upon our secrecy, humanity, and prompt attention in the
management of the cases entrusted to us.


Constipation.
This is the most frequent of all ailments of the female sex. It is
caused from carelessness of the laws of health as much as anything
else; irregularity, neglect to go when nature calls, the use of highly
concentrated foods and the scarcity of liquids taken into the system.
It often arises from derangement of the internal abdominal organs,
falling from the natural position, pressing against the intestines and
obstructing and partly closing the canal. Whatever may be the
cause, it is true that a large portion of the female sex suffer from
constipation and the many evils resulting from
it. Usually at first there is but a functional \y e elite
disturbance, which later on, as the disease
affects the other organs of the body, develops
by aiding
into organic disease. There arises disorder of Natlll*�
the abdominal organs, the circulation is clogged
up with impure matter which should naturally pass off through the
bowels, the liver is disturbed, and the kidneys act poorly. Then a
train of symptoms follow which imperil the general health. The
blood is rendered impure and loaded with the products of decom-
position. The offensive breath, often noticed and ascribed to
disordered stomach or bad teeth, is not from these sources, but is
caused by the re-absorption of gases from the intestinal canal,
from which they arise and contaminate the breath. Headaches,
depressed spirits, languor, and inaptitude for the affairs of life, loss
of flesh, pale, grayish complexion, pimples on the face, dull, lifeless
glance of the eye, and a general loss of ambition, are some of the
indications of this condition. It takes all the brightness out of
life, and renders an otherwise attractive woman an invalid in body
and mind, in appearance and in reality.
To cure this health-destroying affliction nothing has been found


Our Belt t0 ec l a continuous electric current,
which is infused into the affected parts by Dr.
assists the McLaughlin?s Electric Belt. Its vitalizing
digestion current is given direct to the organs of digestion,
where it invigorates the secretory glands, renewing
their activity, and so stimulating their secreting powers that they are
enabled to supply in sufficient quantity the bile, gastric and other
juices that are essential to a proper digestion and assimilation of
the food that has been received in the stomach, preparatory to its
ejectment into the alimentary canal, whence the unassimilated refuse
portion passes in an easy and regular manner, and the nutritive part
is carried into the blood to build up and renew the wear and tear
that has been going on in the muscles, nerves, and other tissues of
the body. Health immediately follows this application, the blood
becomes pure, and the complexion rosy. Life takes
on a brighter prospect as soon as the vitalizing Sufferers
Electricity begins to course through the famished from
nerves, telling the gladdened heart that there is life |*�ctal
and hope in Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt, troubles

Thousands of men and women suffer from piles and hemorr-
hoids, which in many cases undermine health of mind and body.
They are usually the result of continued constipation, childbirth, or
too much sitting, and are an affection of veins in the lower part of
the rectum, and the tissues about the anus, produced by pressure
enlarging and creating a varicose condition of the veins. Most
women with functional weakness have this dreadful suffering to
contend with, in addition to their other pains. Biliousness pro-
duced by indigestion is one of the principal reasons for piles,
however, and both cause and effect are cured by the application of
a gentle current of Electricity to the nervo-muscular centre, where
the current enters the nerves supporting the bowels and conveys
through them an exhilarating life which quickly strengthens the
weakened tissues, increases the circulation of blood, and gives a
gentle contraction to the relaxed and weakened muscles.


Negative There is one feature of the electric current
Current cures w^' * s P ecu barly beneficial in most cases of
constipation; that is, the power of dissolving
Constipation congestion, which is possessed by the negative
current. In many aggravated forms of constipa-
tion the fecal matter has lodged so firmly in the lower bowel that
it becomes almost a solid mass, as hard as a lump of clay. Hardly
anything will break it up, though strong purgatives will sometimes
force a passage-way through it wide enough to permit a partial action
of the intestinal canal, but immediately after the effect of the strong
drug has passed off the parts relapse into even a worse condition
than before, since no healthy secretion has been thrown into the
bowel and none of the obstructing matter has been carried off. In-
stead the intestinal muscles have been still further weakened by the
unnatural action of the drug. As this mass gathers
it forces the impurities back into the system and Dissolves
charges the blood with corruption, making a healthy impure
condition of the body impossible. It causes a
congestion of the tissues of the intestines, and HiattCf
often results fatally. This mass of feces must be
dissolved before relief can be had, and it is done quickly by a
negative current applied from Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt.
Negative electricity produces a decomposition of all impure
matter, dissolves and scatters it. It will remove the congestion
from the bowels in a natural manner, and as the negative current
has also the stimulating element, it will restore the energy to the
nerves of the lower intestines, making them more sensitive and
active, so that they will contract and relax properly as nature calls.
This will in all cases bring about freehand natural action of the
bowel and so restore health.

Doctors do not usually recommend the Dr. McLaughlin Elec-
tric Belt ?some because they do not understand it; others because
it takes customers from them; but no sensible person can doubt its
simple curative power, nor can any one disprove its wonderful cures,


Keep Up Your Vital Energy.
This is the secret of all good health. If you have a strong vital
force circulating in your nerves, there is no chance for the pains or
weakness of which so many people complain. When you have a
pain in your hack it comes from a nerve which has been injured,
or else from some general weakness of the vital organs which are
supported by the nerves that centre at the spine. If you are
nervous, forgetful, or brain weary, it is from* a waste of your vital
energy. There are so many signs of weakness caused by the loss
of this great vital force; its effects are so depressing to the spirits,
weakening to the general nervous organiza-
tion, and so destructive to the general health, Electricity
that all good health depends on retaining basis of
your vital energy. If you have lost any
part of it there is only one way to regain it good health
?by Electricity.
When Dr. McLaughlin?s Electric Belt has been on the body
one hour it places enough vital power in the nerves to supply all
that would be exhausted by an ordinary person in a whole day. It
is worn from four to eight hours daily, day or night; hence it keeps
the body saturated with eight times as much vitality as is needed
to carry on the work of running the human machinery. All this
excess goes to build up the reserve force which has been weakened
by some means in the past. Anyone who understands the relation
which Electricity bears to human nerve force can appreciate the
great, the grand, and wonderful effect that such a treatment must
have upon nerves and organs that nave been gradually losing their
power. It is as simple as anything can be, and yet wonderful, as
is attested by thousands of women who have been saved from
weakness and despair and restored to health and happiness by the
Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt.
