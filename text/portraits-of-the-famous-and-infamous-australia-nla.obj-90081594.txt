PORTRAITS
of the
FAMOUS and INFAMOUS
AUSTRALIA
NEW ZEALAND
and
THE PACIFIC
1492-1970
The portraits compiled in. this book are in the Portraits Section of the Rex Nan Kivell
Collection of Australiana except those in the possession of Galleries or Museums, or held
privately. The Collection is now in the possession of The National Library, Canberra,
Australia,
The portrait collection consists mostly of contemporary portraits in oil, watercolour,
drawing and engraving in all mediums, of the “famous” whose activities in various ways
foresaw, discovered, opened up and settled the great Continent of Australia and the Islands
of New Zealand and the Pacific, and the “infamous” whose contribution has chiefly been
romantic, dramatic and sometimes historic.
We have rejected no medium at all, including portrait illustrations from books and photo-
graphs where a photograph is the only known portrayal, in order to make the listing as
complete as possible.
The portraits include the early philosophers, cartographers, navigators, explorers, statesmen,
Home and Colonial, churchmen, missionaries, authors, artists, political and social reformers,
legal and criminal personalities, emigrants, naval and military Governors and officials, and
some who earned the double sobriquet of “Famous and Infamous”.
The period covered is from Christopher Columbus —who wanted to find the New World in
1492 —to the present time. To each person entered is given a brief biographical sketch of his
or her connection with the subject, also the method and size of the portrait or portraits, and
where found.
Besides being listed here, all the portraits have been photographed and are inserted in the
duplicate Rex Nan Kivell series of 30 large albums, one set of which is at The National
Library, Canberra, Australia, and the other set is on view at Australia House (the Library),
London, W.C.2, eventually to go to the Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand.
The portraits selected for illustration here are identified individually and also are noted
accordingly by pagination in the text.
Many of the individual surnames and Christian names will be found with different spelling.
We have adhered to the original spelling when written contemporarily. This is due to the
writers in manuscripts and on pictures and engravings following phonetic pronunciation.
Some readers will be surprised at the omission of several well-known personalities, but this
only means that no portrait of them has yet been traced.
It is inevitable that further research will find more portraits. These will be collected and
published in a supplement at a future date.

BLIGH. John, later Lord Darnley, 1767-
1851. Capt. Bligh, when making the
passage through the Torres Strait in the
“Providence” and “Assistant” in 1792,
discovered and named Darnley Island
after his kinsman Earl Darnley.
BLIGH. Lieut. Wm. 1754-1817. First became
noticed when serving as sailing-master
aboard the “Resolution” during Cook’s
3rd Voyage; Commander of the Frigate
“Bounty” during her voyage into the
South Sea for the purpose of conveying
the Bread-fruit-tree to the W. Indies,
1787-90; made a second and successful
attempt in the “Providence”, 1791-93;
Governor of N.S. Wales, 1806-08. When
commanding the “Director”, played a
prominent part in the suppression of the
mutiny at the Nore, 1795; served as
Captain aboard h.m.s. “Director” at the
battle of Camperdown, 1797; Lord
Nelson’s high commendation of Bligh’s
conduct during the naval engagement at
Copenhagen; published his narrative of
the “Bounty”, 1790 and 1792. He was
doubtless a controversial character, ever
ready to enforce the severe naval
discipline of his period. Many are the
criticisms levelled against his supposed
arbitrary naval conduct, but all agree he
excelled as a navigator. Bligh died in
Bond Street, London. His residence at
100 Lambeth Road is now (1972) in good
preservation.

1754 where he remained until 1763. The
same year he joined his country’s naval
service, being ordered to the Falkland

failure, Bougainville turned his attention
exploring parts of the Magellan Strait.
Passing through the Strait into the
Pacific, he discovered and named several
islands. After his return to France he
rejoined the army, retiring as Field-
Marshal, 1790. Seeillus. p. 247.

BRUCE, George, or BARNET BURNS,
1778-1819, b. at Radcliffe-Highway, Lon-
don. He left England in the “Royal
Admiral” as Boatswain’s boy, arriving
at Port Jackson 1792. Quitting the ship
he joined the Naval Colonial Service and
for a long period worked under Capt. M.
Flinders on the Exploring and Surveying
of the New Holland coastline and its
harbours. Bruce was aboard the “Lady
Nelson” and attended Tippahee (King
of New Zealand) who had been taken
with a dangerous illness whilst making
the passage home to N.Z. Bruce’s treat-
ment so pleased the King that on arrival
at the Bay of Islands he offered Bruce the
hand of his daughter, Princess Aetockoe,
provided Bruce entered the King’s
service. Accepting, Bruce submitted to
the native custom of tattooing and so
became a Warrior and Chief. He became
a flax-trader for Sydney merchants. Later
the “General Wellesley”, Capt. Dal-
rymple, entered the Bay and induced
Bruce and his wife to make a voyage to
Cape North, where, said the Captain,
gold had been discovered. When the
ship arrived at the Cape she hove-off and
sailed on to Malacca, the Captain ignor-
ing the pleadings of the couple to return
to the Bay of Islands. At Malacca Bruce
went ashore to report the Captain’s
conduct and while so engaged he saw the
ship sail away; his wife being aboard.
After many months of painful search he
located and joined her, making their way
home by way of New South Wales.
Returning alone to England, he pub-
lished an account of his life in New
Zealand and embarked on a series of
lecture tours describing the customs of
the natives of New Zealand, before
fading into obscurity.
There are no definite dates of birth and
death. They vary from the above to those
given by the Hocken Library (1807?-
post 1859).
Note: The above is pieced together from
an account printed in 1819. It does not
agree with the opinion held by Govr.
Macquarie of Bruce’s character or con-
duct.

securing a ruling that every sitting of
Parliament should begin with prayers.
In 1887 he was created a baronet.

COLENSO, William, 1811-99. The Caxton
of New Zealand. Arriving at Paihai,
North Island, during Jan. 1834. He set
up the first New Zealand printing press
of which he was compositor, printer,
binder and distributor. He was also a
missionary. Made a Deacon 1844. Had a
friendship with Allan Cunningham, the
naturalist who visited the Bay of Islands
in 1838. In 1841 J. D. Hooker on Ross’
Antarctic Expedition in the “Erebus”
and “Terror” also came to the Bay for 3
months. They went on many expeditions
together. Thereafter for 5 o years Colenso
sent specimens and exchanged letters
with him and his father Sir W. Hooker.
In 1852 he was deprived of his Deacon’s
office for having a natural child —so
much for the appalling ‘enlightenment’
of the missionary superintendents of the
period, when he, Colenso, had so much
of quality to contribute.

COOK, Capt. James, R.N., F.R.S. 1728-79.
The celebrated English navigator who
performed three voyages around the
World. The first, 1768-71 upon which he
visited New Zealand and the East coast
of New Holland; the second, 1772-75, to
the Southern Hemisphere and towards
the South Pole, crossing the Antarctic
Circle three times; the third, 1776-80, to
the N.W. Coast of America. Previous
to the first voyage he was engaged by the
Admiralty on survey work off the New-
foundland Coast and within the ap-
proaches to Quebec.
To him we owe the first authentic account
and discovery of many South-Sea Islands,
with a description of their inhabitants,
customs and manners. He was the first to
successfully use an anti-scorbutic which
preserved his seamens’ health, so pre-
venting the fear of another “Anson’s
calamity”. For such service he was
awarded the Copley medal and thanks
of the Royal Society (Nov. 30, 1776).

combined with the engraved design on
the decanter, c. 1820.

by the portrait, is about 38 years, or, just
previous to the first voyage, 1768.

pastor. He was assistant editor of the
“Globe Encyclopaedia” and of “Cham-
bers’ Etymological Dictionary”, and a
contributor to Chambers’ Encyclopaedia.
In 1890 he was appointed as co-pastor of
Knox Church, Dunedin; he remained in
New Zealand for four years, earning
through his sermons and work with
young people the great respect of his
congregation. Early in 1894, after a
disagreement with Dr. Stuart, the senior
pastor, he returned, despite the remon-
strances of the Session, to Scotland,
becoming pastor of Skirling Hanna
Memorial Church in the presbytery of
Lanark.

detention was that Decaen considered
Flinders a spy. Decaen ordered the

papers and charts of Flinders’ Australian
explorations, be seized. Flinders returned
home in 1810 when the papers and

the “Victorian”, a Roman Catholic

compromise militated against his achiev-

DE THIERRY, Charles Philip Hippolytus,
Baron, 1793-1864. His interest in New
Zealand was aroused by a meeting with
Thomas Kendall of the C.M.S. mission
in 1820, and he arranged with Kendall
for the purchase of a large area of land
on the Hokianga River, which he set out
to claim in 1835. He sent an outline of his
plans for the government of his demense
to the British Resident at New Zealand,
James Busby, who responded by organ-
ising the Maori Chiefs of the north to
draw up a Declaration of the Independ-
ence of New Zealand. When de Thierry
reached New Zealand late in 1837, he
was met by official opposition and a
repudiated land title, and most of his
colonists deserted him. He settled on
land in the Hokianga and later at Auck-
land, but left New Zealand for California
in 1850. His plans for his territory were
in themselves quite sound and inspired
by humanitarian ideals, but his rather
absurd pretensions and picaresque ex-
istence, coupled with the difficulties over
his land title, undermined his 'ability to
carry them out.

METHOD DESCRIPTION
AND SIZE
FAIRFAX, Hon. John, 1804-77. Trained as
a printer and bookseller in England, he
arrived in Australia in 1858, after a libel
case had left him insolvent. He gained
employment as a librarian, but soon
turned again to journalism, and in 1841
purchased with Charles Kemp the Sydney
Herald, renamed the following year the
Sydney Morning Herald. In twelve years
of successful partnership the Herald was
established as the leading Australian
newspaper of the day; when Kemp
retired Fairfax became sole proprietor,
devoting himself to improvement of the
paper as a vehicle of news and commerce
and its establishment as a political power.
Though he served a term as legislative
Councillor, he was never an active
politician, turning his energies rather
to the support of charitable institutions
and the Australian Mutual Provident
Society, of which he was for 20 years a
director.

FRANKLIN, Benjamin LL.D. 1706-90.
American philosopher and statesman. In
a letter to Alexander Dalrymple he pro-
posed sending a ship to New Zealand and
other savage parts with a cargo of fowls,
goats, dogs, cattle, corn and iron, etc.
These he considered, when exchanged
with the natives, would be an advantage
to society. The scheme was ignored but
later printed in pamphlet form and is
now a rare item. It is reprinted in the
“Annual Register”, vol. 22, p. 110,

FRY, Elizabeth, 1780-1845. Quaker and
prison reformer. A frequent visitor to
Newgate Prison in the early 1800’s,
obtaining for the women and juvenile
convicts many reliefs from their appalling
conditions. She instructed the children
to read, while the women were taught the
benefits of industrial endeavour and self
respect. At Sydney and Parramatta she
arranged the opening of hostels to which
the women transportees were sent upon
their arrival in Australia. In Feb. 1818,
she was called and examined before a
Committee of the House of Commons
who considered the evidence given “On
the Prisons of the Metropolis”. Thus she
became the first woman commoner called
by the Government to advise on matters
of public concern. Elizabeth continued in
her cause throughout her life and saw its
good effects extend into France, Ger-
many and Holland. She was cousin to
Edw. G. Wakefield.

Cornahir, Co. Westmeath, she married
Lieutenant-Colonel George Grey of the
30th Foot Regiment, whose family were
London bankers, descendants of the
Greys of Groby. The shock of his death
in 1812 whilst leading a storming party
against Badajoz caused Mrs. Grey to give
premature birth to the son who was
later to become famous as one of the
great Colonial Governors of the nine-
teenth century: Sir George Grey. She
was a well-educated and pious lady,
whose early teaching left an indelible
impression on Grey. In 1817 she married
an Irish baronet, Rev. Sir John Thomas.

GRINN, Henri Louis (alias Louis De
Rougemont). Born at Paris 1847. He
found his way to Australia during the 18 70’s
and became occupied as waiter, photo-
grapher, and common trickster. Arriving
back in England in 1898, he presented
himself at the offices of the “Wide World
Magazine” and offered for sale his travels
and adventures in the Australian Colon-
ies. These were readily acquired and
published by the editor as a true and
startling narrative. The narrative was
published in ten instalments, appear-
ing from Aug. 1898 to May of 1899, the
whole appearing within vols. 1,2, 3, as
annuals. This fantastic concoction of lies
was so well related by Rougemont that
many Geographical Societies of the day
were quite taken-in. F. Clunes, the
Australian writer, names Rougemont as

GRINNELL, Henry, 1799-1874. A wealthy
New York merchant, Grinnell had early
been connected with the whaling in-
dustry and developed an interest in the
arctic regions and their exploration. His
equipment and dispatch of three vessels
in search of the lost Franklin Polar
Expedition greatly stimulated the revival
of American exploration. His second
voyage of 1853, commanded by E. K.
Kane, was notable for its discovery of
the Humboldt Glacier, and its attainment
of the highest latitude ever reached by a
sailing ship; new land was named after
its benefactor. One of the founders and
president of the American Geographical
and Statistical Society, Grinnell con-
tinued to give generous financial aid to
Polar exploration.

Govr. Phillips, 1792, he became Lieut.-
Govr, until replaced by Govr. Hunter in
1795. It is said “he considered himself

chief pastime was that of the Colony’s

full of ships from Bra2il, India, and the
Cape of Good Hope, all laden with

HAWKESWORTH, Dr. John, 1715-73.
Author of many works of literary merit.
He was engaged to arrange for publica-

voyages of Byron, Wallace, Carteret,
and Cook. For this he is said to have
received £ 6,000 plus a severe censure on
account of its inaccuracies and nautical
omissions. Perhaps the charge is not
quite justified as Cook’s Journals were
no easy undertaking to turn into an
attractive narrative. This is proven by
later observations made by the Bishop
of Salisbury to whom was entrusted the
J
principal part in preparing the journals
of Cook’s second and third voyages for
the press. See Douglas, J., Bishop of

HIGINBOTHAM, George, 1826-92. Ar-
riving in Melbourne in 1854, he practised
as a barrister and for three years edited a
local paper, the Argus. He first entered
the Legislative Assembly as an inde-
pendent liberal in 1861, becoming Attor-
ney-General in the McCulloch Govern-
ment of 1863-8. A man of rigid
principles, he resigned his seat, disgusted
with parliamentary procedures, in 1876;
declined a knighthood; and threw away
the chance of becoming lieutenant gover-
nor by refusing to acknowledge the right
of the Colonial Office to interfere in the
internal affairs of a self-governing
Colony. A great orator, he was im-
mensely popular with industrial workers,
even before he caused a sensation by
giving financial assistance to the leaders
of the 1890 maritime strike. In 1880 a
Judge of the Supreme Court, he became
Chief Justice of Victoria in 1886, com-
pleting in 1890 a consolidation of the
statute law of the colony.

HORDERN, Anthony the Third, 1842-86.
He built the railway from Albany to
Beverley, commencing 1886 by payment
from the Government of 2 million acres
of land to be selected between Beverley
and King George’s Sound, and the con-
tractors besides building the railway were
to settle 5,000 emigrants in the Colony.
Subsequent agreements were that he
received £lO for each emigrant landed
and almost three million acres. Hordern
secured the co-operation of C, & G.
Millar in the construction of the railway
and he then visited London and set up
the West Australian Land Company with
a capital of £BOO,OOO. Whilst returning
to supervise the work in West Australia
he died at sea and was buried at Albany,
but his well-laid plan went on. An obelisk
monument was erected to his memory in
York Street, Albany, in 1889.

“Kent” for Port Phillip, then on to the
gold-diggings at Bendigo; later, Com-
missioner for Crown Lands at Heathcote.
For 17 years he remained in Australia
where his varied attempts to earn a liveli-
hood constantly brought him near desti-
tution. Upon his arrival back in England
he found himself estranged from his old
friends, by the English public, forgotten.

Horne: The Farthing Poet, Longmans,
etc., London: 1968, reserves the latter

JONES, John, 1809-69. In his youth a sealer
and Sydney waterman. Jones’s careful
investments in whaling had by 1859 made
him the owner of a fleet of vessels and a
chain of stations along the coast of the
South Island of New Zealand. Investing
further in South Island land, he sent
eleven English families, with a mission-
ary, to start in 1840 a settlement at
Waikouaiti. Arriving himself three years
later, he established a prosperous farming
business which after 1848 catered for the
needs of the new Dunedin settlers. But it
was as a shipowner that he made his
greatest contribution to the growth of
Otago. At first providing regular services
to the northland and Sydney, he founded
in iB6O the Harbour Steam Navigation
Company, eventually to grow into the
Union Steam Ship Company of New
Zealand, which carried much of the
passenger and cargo between Dunedin
and Port Chalmers, and secured in
addition a contract from the Provincial
Government to run regular services
north from Dunedin. In 1854 Jones
moved to Dunedin, becoming in 1855 a
member of the Town Board and in 1856
its chairman; generally, however, he took
little part in public life.

JORGENSON, Jorgen. 1780-1841. Amongst
the persons employed in the V.D.L.
Company in 1826 was Jorgen Jorgenson,
whose adventurous life made him re-
markable even among vagabonds. He
was a Dane born in Copenhagen in 1780.
After some employment in the coal trade
he accompanied the expedition of Flin-
ders, and afterwards as mate on board the
“Lady Nelson” attended the first party to
Risdon Cove. Having returned to
Europe he became commander of a
privateer in the service of his own
country, but was captured after a smart
resistance by the British ships “Sappho”
and “Clio”. He obtained, while out on his
parole, the merchant ship “Margaret
and Anne” to carry provisions to Ice-
land, where the people were suffering ex-
treme privation. On a second voyage
Count Tramp the Governor prohibited
further intercourse. Jorgenson landed
when the people were at church, and aided
by his seamen took the Governorprisoner.
He then issued a proclamation stating
that he had been called by an oppressed
people to take the reins of government.
He proceeded to reform its various
departments; he lightened the taxes; aug-
mented the pay of the clergy; improved
the system of education; established
trial by jury, formed an army consisting
of eight soldiers and fortified the harbour
with six guns. Having performed these
exploits he returned to London in a
prize taken from the Island. His proceed-
ings were already known to the Ministry
and he was arrested as an alien at large.
Jorgenson made no small stir by his
appearance among legislators and
administrators.
After a variety of adventures he
was charged for robbing Sarah Stour-
bridge, lodging-house keeper of Warren
St. (Lond.), of a small quantity of
bedding and sentenced (May 1820) to
V.D. Land for 7 years. In Newgate he
was employed as a dispenser of medicine.
After four years detention he was re-
leased, but was retaken, having neglected
to quit Great Britain, and was trans-
ported for life to V.D.L. Here he was em-
ployed as a constable, detected many
crimes and brought several men to the
scaffold. He at length closed his singular
career in the hospital in Hobart Town.
He was known to Sir Joseph Banks and
also to Sir William J. Hooker the
celebrated botanist, who, when a young
naturalist, met with Jorgenson in Ice-
land, said that his talents were of the
highest order but his moral and re-
ligious character was of the lowest. “He
was seaman, explorer, traveller, author,
adventurer, gambler, spy, man of letters,
man of fortune, political prisoner, dis-
pensing chemist, and King of Iceland.”
He wrote “State of Christianity in the
Island of Otaheite . . .” sold by J.
Hatchard, Piccadilly, 1811. Also “Obser-
vations on the Funded System . . .”

KNATCHBULL, John, alias Fitch or Fetch,
1789-1844; second son of Sir Ed.
Knatchbull of Mersham, Kent, a
relative of Sir Jos. Banks. Joined the
Navy, becoming Midshipman and later
Captain. His naval service terminated
upon receiving 14 years transportation
for forgery. Arrived at Sydney aboard
the “Asia” in 1825, If his autobiography
is to be accepted, his lot was surely a sad
one. More misfortune awaited him in the
Colony where he became constantly in
trouble with the authorities. He was
hanged, Feb. 1844, for the murder of a
Mrs Jamieson of Sydney.

These reveal the commencement of the

savage sentence so willingly inflicted by
Judge Williams on the six Dorchester
labourers in March 1834. Today one may
wonder why Melbourne’s name was
given to the present flourishing city.
Would not the name of either Hume,
Roebuck, or Wakley have been more
appropriate ?

LOCKE, John, 1632-1704. The greatest
philosopher of his day. As Secretary of
the Council of Trade, he helped draft
the fundamental constitutions of Carol-
ina; as Shaftesbury’s associate he had to
flee England in 1683, remaining in
Holland until after the Revolution of
1688. His Essay concerning “Human
Understanding” and his “Two Treatises
of Government” established him as the
founder of philosophic liberalism. Sub-
stituting for the hereditary power of
kings that of government by social
contract, Locke arrived at the doctrine
of the supremacy of the legislative power
over, and its separation from, the
executive providing a justification both
for the overthrow of James II and for the
revolution of the American colonies,
Locke’s political philosophy was the
basis of Whiggism for over a century.
His doctrines were embodied in the
Declaration of the Rights of Man of
1789, in the French Constitution of 1871,
and, most strikingly, in the American
Constitution.

later, each was sentenced to seven years’
Transportation. They left Spithead on
board the “William Metcalf” on 25

MAC ANDREW, James, 1820-87. Born in

establishing a store and a coastal and
intercolonial shipping service. Politically
active throughout his life, he was a
member of the first Otago Provincial
Council and the first Dunedin Town
Board, and the Dunedin member for
parliament from 1853-60. Elected Super-
intendent of the Province in 1859, he was
imprisoned two years later for embezzle-
ment of public funds, but by 1865 he was
again sitting in the General Assembly,
remaining a member for various Otago
constituencies until his death. Chosen as
leader of the Liberal Party in 1879, he
held office in two governments, obtain-
ing from Parliament the authorisation of
three important railways, the North
Island Main Trunk, the Midland, and the
Central Otago. Easily regaining the
Superintendency in 1867, which office
he held until its abolition in 1876, he was
instrumental in the founding of pro-
vincial educational institutions, notably
the University of Otago and the Medical
School.

years’ stay in the Colony he was engaged
in many undertakings: stock-breeder,

liquors. He was the first to introduce the
fine Spanish Merino sheep into New
Holland and had the satisfaction of seeing
the commencement of present Australia’s
prosperous staple commodity. By nature,
he was considered of an explosive dis-
position but ever ready to defend his
energetic and controversial character.

MACKENZIE, Peter, 1799-1875. Founder of
the “Loyal Reformers’ Gazette”, 1831-
36, and later the “Glasgow Gazette”. His
papers were always at the disposal of the
Reform Movement while he devoted
much time to assisting those unfortunates
who fell within the grip of the then
Treason and Sedition laws. To him goes
the credit of exposing the Government
spy system as enacted by Alex. Richmond
and his companions; the successful
petition to King William IV for the
pardon and return of eighteen men
previously transported to N.S. Wales,
also the suggestion of erecting a monu-
ment on Calton Hill to the memory of
the Political Martyrs of 1795-94. From
his pen came “The Life of Thos. Muir”,
1831; “Reminiscences of Glasgow and
the West of Scotland”, Glasgow, 1865-
68, 3 vols. Bvo. New edn., 2 vols. in 4,
1875-76; the “Exploits of Richmond the
Spy”, which appeared in fifteen succes-
sive numbers in 1832 (Court statement),
but Mackenzie mentions “sixteen weekly
or monthly numbers, price twopence
each”. See p. 394, pt. 2 of vol. 2, 1875-76
edn. of “Reminiscences of Glasgow”.

Portraits are displayed in Pompallier House, Kororareka, N.Z., of
three Marist bishops whose names are closely associated with
Kororareka. One came here to be consecrated; another arrived first
as a priest and returned later as a bishop; the third was consecrated
only after he had left the New Zealand mission.
COLOMB, Georges. Consecrated by Viard at Kororareka, May 1847.
Succeeded Epalle as Vicar Apostolic of Melanesia and Micronesia.
Died at Rook Island, between New Guinea and New Britain, 1848.
VIARD, Philippe. Arrived Kororareka December 1839. Recovered
Chanel’s body at Futuna January 1842, brought it to Kororareka in
the “Sancta Maria” February 1842. Appointed coadjutor to Pompallier
1845, consecrated at Sydney January 1846. Headquarters at Korora-

EPALLE, Jean. Arrived Kororareka June 1839. Whangaroa 1840'
Vicar-General Kororareka 1841-42. Returned to France 1842.
Appointed Vicar Apostolic of Melanesia and Micronesia, consecrated
Rome 1844. Killed at Ysabel, Solomon Islands, December 1845.
There are no known likenesses of several of the Marist Fathers who
served at Kororareka and thus neither Claude Andre Baty nor
Auguste Chouvet appear in this collection: Baty, who spent the
greater part of his 11 years in New Zealand at Kororareka and who,
for much of that time, was involved in the work of the printing house;
Chouvet, who assisted Baty at Kororareka when troops were stationed
at the Bay in 1845 and who later published a lively account of his
sojourn in New Zealand. The first Catholic priest ordained in New
Zealand was Francois Roulleaux-Dubignon who was raised to the
priesthood on 2 July 1841 in the little chapel which once stood on this
property, but he too is missing from this portrait collection. Most of
the Marist priests whose photographs now hang in Pompallier House
gave many years to the New Zealand mission, all knew this building
during its earlier days, some may have assisted with its construction.

tane, Otaki. Returned to France 1854. Died France 1899.

The only lay brother whose photograph hangs in Pompallier House
is Brother Florentin (J. B. Francon). He arrived at Kororareka in
June 1839 and was stationed here briefly before going to Hokianga
where he spent most of his 11 years in the northern mission. He went
to Meeanee in 1851 and died in Sydney in 1903.
These Marist portraits have been copied from prints lent by Mount
St. Mary’s (Greenmeadows), “Zealandia”, Rev. J. N. Joyce, s.m., and
the General Archives of the Marist Fathers in Rome. No likenesses
have been traced of the two laymen so intimately associated with
Pompallier House itself, Perret the architect and Yvert the printer.
*Rozet became a Marist only after his return to France.

MUIR, Thomas, of Huntershill, Scotland,
1 765-99. In company with Margarot,
Palmer and Skirving he was sentenced
to transportation to N.S.W. for a
supposed seditious act “For making
Seditious Speeches and exhorting Persons
to purchase the printed like of same”.
After a tedious voyage the “Surprise”
with Muir, Margarot, Palmer and Skirv-
ing aboard, reached Sydney, Sept. 25,
1794. During the next two years it
would appear that Muir received from
the Colonial Authorities far better treat-
ment than afforded by the Home Govern-
ment prior to his transportation. On
Feb. 18, 1796, arrived the American
ship “Otter” and within a few hours
Muir was smuggled aboard and well
clear of Sydney, en route for Nookta
Sound where the “Otter” became a total
wreck when within sight of her destina-
tion. Muir, with two others, were the
only survivors. Then began his long and
miserable journey across America to
Panama and on to Vera Cm 2, where he
was shipped by the Governor to Spain
as a suspected person. When off the
Spanish coast the Spanish frigate, carry-
ing Muir, was engaged by two English
Men-of-War, and sunk. From this en-
gagement Muir lost an eye and suffered
other injuries. Finally Muir arrived in
France where he was well received. He
died at Chantilly, Jan. 26, 1799, snd
was buried in an unknown grave.
(This description of his vicissitudes is
taken from Peter Mackenzie’s “The
Life of Thomas Muir”. London, 1831.)

NOBBS, Rev. Geo. H. 1799-1885. Joined
the Navy and made a voyage to Australia,
1811. This adventurous spirit was always
engaged in some form of conflict or
other. In 1816 he accepted an offer to
join Lord Cochrane’s South American
patriots for whose cause he displayed,
before Arauco and Callao, many heroic
and brave deeds. Quitting the Chilian
Service, 1822, he went on to Naples,
Messina, then from London to Sierre
Leone as chief mate of the “Gambia”.
Of the nineteen persons aboard, none
but Mr Nobbs and three others lived to
return. Finally he arrived at Pitcairn
Island, Oct. 1828, via Calcutta,
Valparaiso and Callao, being well received
by John Adams and the Islanders. Upon
the death of Adams, March 1829, Mr
Nobbs was appointed Pastor and Teacher
to the Island community. Under his
shrewd and careful guidance the com-
munity enlarged and flourished. Mr
Nobbs and his flock transferred to
Norfolk Island, May 1856, and enjoyed
the benefits of a model Constitution
given them by Govr.-Gen. Sir Wm. T.
Denison. Nobbs died and was buried on
the Island, Nov. 7, 1885.

NOMAHANNA. She was one of the wives
of Tameamea, king of the Sandwich
Islands. Her residence was on Wahu
Island. Otto von Kotzebue met her
before the death of her husband in
1819, and then again in 1824, when she
“appeared at the utmost not more than
forty years old, was exactly six feet two
inches high, and rather more than two
ells in circumference”. She proved a
very hospitable hostess, and was con-
sidered by the natives and settlers as the
cleverest and most learned woman on
Wahu.

PATON, Rev. John G. 1824-1907. Came to
Tanna, New Hebrides, Nov. 1858,
accompanied by his wife. His stay on the
Island of four years was beset with trials
severe enough to make the boldest
quake. He was highly considered in
Sydney and Melbourne, from where he
was able to obtain sufficient funds for the
purchase of the Mission-Ship “Day-
spring” and pay a second visit to Tanna.

PATTESON, Rt. Rev. John Coleridge, 1827-
71. Educated at Eton and Balliol, and
ordained in 1853, Patteson was attracted
to missionary work by a meeting with
Bishop Selwyn, and left England in 1855
to work in the Melanesian field. He
taught Melanesian students in New
Zealand and Norfolk Island at first, and
was consecrated bishop of Melanesia in
1861. He worked to produce vocabularies
of several languages, and translated parts
of the Bible into the Mota dialect, which
he had chosen for use in his school. He
died on Nukapu to the north of the Santa
Cruz Group, and his death, which was
seen as a reprisal for one of the more
violent aspects of the “labour trade” of
the time, inspired attempts to regulate the
trade. Became first missionary Bishop of
Melanesia.

PATTLE, Elizabeth. First wife of Edward
Gibbon Wakefield.
PAUL, Sir John D. 1802-68. With his two

Escaping again with a convict named
Cox, Pearce repeated his early conduct.
Giving himself up again he confessed to
the repeat of cannibalism, and before he
was hanged for the murders it is reported
that he said he preferred human flesh to
any other form of food. It had become a
craving with him.
PEEL, Sir Robt. 1788-1850. Noted English
statesman, Under-Secr. for the Colonies
during 1811. Mt. Peel, N.Z., was named

RENNIE, George, 1802-60. His early in-
terests were primarily agricultural and
artistic, but a brief period as an M.P,
attracted his attention to Colonising
schemes, and he wrote a letter to the New
Zealand Company in July 1842, out-
lining a plan which was to form the basis
of the New Edinburgh or Otago Settle-
ment. The letter, which appeared in the
press, was much debated, and it was not
until 1848 that the first emigrants arrived
at Dunedin. Rennie himself never came.
From 1847 to 1855 he was Governor of
the Falkland Islands, and he died in
London in iB6O after a long illness.

the Scottish Spy, as he appeared in the
Court of Exchequer, London, 20-22nd
Dec., 1834. The portrait appears in one of
the 4 twopenny numbers forming the
“Exposure” pamphlet, with the collation
(when bound) of pp. 1-64, Bvo.
The author uses the sobriquet “A TEN-
TOUNDER” (P. Mackenzie).
RICHMOND, Alex. Bailey. 1790-1862. He
first came to notice as the spokesman of
the Scottish weavers during their demands
for improved working conditions during
the Glasgow disputes of 1812. Peter Mac-
kenzie (author of the Life of Thos. Muir,
1831) with numerous others, considered
him a proven spy, under the direction of
Visct. Castlereagh and Ld. Sidmouth.
Richmond doubtless passed secret in-
formation whereby many Scottish and
English radicals were transported
between 1816-20. In 1835 P. Mackenzie
published a pamphlet “An Exposure of
the Spy System in Glasgow, 1816-20”
causing Richmond to sue the agents of
Wm. Tait the Edinburgh publisher for
libel and £5,000 damages. Richmond’s
defence was so inadequate that he was
ruled non-suited.

Wesleyan lay preacher, Ridley went to
South Australia in 1839, where he
established himself as a miller and ex-
perimented with building harvesting
machines, based on illustrations he had
seen in an encyclopaedia of agriculture.
His success with the machines enabled a
great increase to be made in the wheat-
growing of the district and he was
formally thanked for his work by the
South Australian Parliament in 1858. He
left Australia in 1853 an d travelled on
the Continent before settling in England,
where he devoted himself principally to
preaching, and made many gifts to
evangelical churches and missions.

On the outbreak of war, he acted as an

leave the district. In 1862 he was offered
a post as Maori Missioner in Otago,
where he settled at Otago heads and
kept a school. He became a minister of

ROBLEY, Major-General H. G. 1840-1930.
The celebrated delineator of Maori
tattooing and Maori life. Came to
Auckland aboard the “Australian” in
Jan. 1864, as a Lieut, of the 68th Regt.,
seeing service at the Gate Pa and Te
Ranga. His well known “MOKO” was
published in 1896. Without this excellent
artist painting his contemporary Maori
portraits and tattooing, New Zealand
would have a very sad void in its
pictorial history. Forever let us thank
General Robley.
He married Hane Ngata, a Maori girl and
had a son. In the Rex Nan Kivell
Collection are several large albums con-
taining Robley’s original watercolours,
sketches and drawings, all being an-
notated by Robley. Mostly purchased
direct from General Robley.

were Sir Robert Helpmann, Michael
Benthall, Sir Noel Coward, Sir Michael
Redgrave, Sir John Gielgud, Lord
SAINTHILL, Loudon, 1919-69. Born
Hobart, Tasmania. Worked as an artist
in Melbourne and Sydney where he was
a member of the Merioola Group. He
exhibited at the Macquarie Gallery and
had paintings acquired by the State
Galleries. In 1939 he arrived in England
and exhibited at the Redfern Gallery,
London, his paintings of the Russian
Ballet, arranged by Harry Tatlock Miller
with whom Sainthill remained in close
association the whole of his lifetime.
During the war he returned to Australia
and served in the Australian Army, and
returned to London in 1949. At Stratford
“The Tempest” 1950, was his first Eng-
lish production followed by 14 other
Shakespearian productions at both Strat-
ford and the Old Vic., while others in-
cluding Shaw at the Haymarket, Wilde
in Shaftesbury Avenue, “Le Coq d’Or”
at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, Tennessee Williams at The
Royal Court, Cole Porter at the Coliseum.
At times he had three or more produc-
tions simultaneously showing in the
West End of London. He became inter-
nationally known as a designer for the
theatre and as one of the strongest
influences in stage-design in England.
His style was always personal and could
range from a remarkably controlled
extravagance to an astringent simplicity.
He is buried in the village churchyard of
Ropley in Hampshire. The Loudon Saint-
hill Memorial Scholarship has now been
established in perpetuity to enable young
Australian theatre designers to study in
Europe.

SOLOMONS, Isaac “Ikey,” the famous
Houndsditch swindler, forger, fence, and
brothel-keeper, etc. b. 1780. Ikey’s wife
was sent to Hobart Town for a term of
fourteen years for receiving a stolen
watch, and was later joined by Ikey
and the family who opened their tradi-
tional business of crime. They prospered
at Hobart for some months, when
suddenly an order for Ikey’s apprehen-
sion arrived from England. Appearing
at the Old Bailey, July 9, 1850, he was
indicted upon eight different charges,
found guilty of two, and transported
back to Hobart Town. Ikey, it appears,
was born to overcome all obstacles in
life; for he later became an Overseer of
Convicts. The following anecdote seems
worthy of recording: Upon the sentence
of transportation on Mrs Solomons,
Ikey’s son preceded her to Van Die-
men’s Land and met her transport ship
at Hobart, going aboard in a swaggering
manner, he claimed Mrs Solomons as an
assignee. Some state he went much
further by making it known that he
intended, if necessary, to make her his
wife.

STRZELECKI, Sir P. E. de, 1796-1873.
Polish explorer and scientist, arrived in
Australia in April 1839. Found gold
near Bathurst which he showed to Sir
George Gipps, the Governor, who
begged him to suppress all mention of
his discovery, since the announcement
would unsettle the Colony. Strzelecki
compromised and when his Journal was
published in the Sydney Herald he
mentioned the gold but wrote that it
did not exist in sufficient quantity to
“repay its extraction”. He believed
quite the contrary. He is commemorated
by the Australian mountain which bears
his name.

STUART, Rev. Donald McNaughton, 1819-
94. Called to be first minister of Knox
Church, Dunedin, in 1859, retaining
the post for the rest of his life. His major
interest was in education: he advocated
the establishment by the Presbyterian
Synod of a Divinity Hall in Dunedin,
and taught there for a time on its
opening; he was a member of the board
of governors of the Otago Boys’ and
Girls’ High Schools from its establish-
ment in 1877, being chairman at the time
of his death. He was an original member
of the Council of the University of
Otago, serving as Vice-Chancellor in
1871, 1874 and 1877, and as Chancellor
from 1879 until his death; he was also a
member of the Senate of the University
of New Zealand from 1873 to 1881,
although he did not approve the loss of
Otago’s power to confer- degrees. In
1872, an honorary degree of Doctor of
Divinity was conferred on him by the
University of St. Andrews, where he had
once studied.

pilers, wish to thank him for his co-
operation extending over many years.

TASMAN, Abel J. 1603-59. The great
Dutch navigator who set out from
Batavia in 1642 in the “Heemskirck” &
“Zeehaen” on purpose to ascertain the
extent of the western side of the Aus-
tralian Continent. It was upon this
voyage he sighted the land which he
named Van Diemen. Continuing, he
crossed the Tasman Sea until he came
upon and named New Zealand. His
reception by the Maoris was most
hostile, as three of his crew were
murdered and his two ships chased or
pursued by some twenty armed Maori
canoes. On his second voyage to the
South Coast of New Guinea and N.W.
part of the Torres Strait was made an
attempt to find a passage into the South
Seas. Tasman returned to Batavia in the
June of 1644 after which the charts of his
two voyages were forwarded to the
Stadt-House, Amsterdam. The first
English account of his first voyage
appears in the Philo. Collections of the
Royal Society, London, as No. 6, March
i6B(-J), at pp. 179-186, 1 plate. London:

suggested date of the painting is just
previous to 1637. It was formerly in
possession of Robt. Springer of Bradford,
England, whose early relative Jan
Meynderts Springer, married Tasman’s
widow, Feb 6., 1661. It was about this
period that many Dutch families came to
Yorkshire and engaged in the then
expanding wool industry. The painting
was sold at Christie’s in 1877 and has since
come into the collection of Rex de C. Nan
Kivell, forming part of his Australasian
Collection.

TAWELL, John, 1784-1845. A one-time
Quaker who was transported to New
South Wales in 1817. Upon gaining
ticket-of-leave, he began a successful
career at Parramatta and Sydney as a
chemist, moneylender and speculator.
After his return to England he became
involved in an affair with a Mrs Sarah
Hart whom he poisoned. Tawell was
sentenced and hanged on March 28 at
Aylesbury.
Tawell is seen seated in his cell engaged in
writing. Calcraft, the executioner together
with the turnkey, arrive to perform their

TAYLOR, John, 1829-75. Alias John “Wee-
church” or “Weachurch”, as he was
known in Victoria. English-born, Taylor
was transported to Tasmania for theft in

expiry of his sentence but was soon
gaoled again and remained in prison for
a succession of serious crimes including
arson and attempted murder. Eventually
hanged in December, 1875.
Accuracy of this account is doubtful, the
date of hanging is given by White as 1876
or 1877, whereas the “Victorian
Government Gazette” showed it to be
1875.

SUBJECT
WADE, Rev. William Richard, 1802-91.
Arrived in New Zealand late in 1854
with William Colenso to aid in the
establishment of the Church Missionary
Society’s press at Paihia, but he could
not get on with Colenso and his dissent-
ing views precluded his partaking in
many of the religious duties then
expected of lay members of the mission.
He was sent to the Te Papa, Tauranga
Station when it opened in 1835, but
withdrew the following year on the
suspension of the station because of war.
He travelled subsequently in the Waikato
investigating sites for possible future
stations and published an interesting
account of his journeys. His differences
with his fellow missionaries continued,
however, and he left New Zealand in
1842 for Hobart, where he was ordained
and became minister of the Baptist
chapel.
WAGHORN, Lieut. Thos., R.N., F.R.A.S.,
1800-50. The originator of the Overland
Route via the Red Sea and Trieste from
India to Great Britain, 1835. This
provided the Australian Colonies with a
much shorter steam communication than
via the Cape of Good Hope.
WAINEWRIGHT. Thos. Griffiths, 1794-
1847. Soldier, poet, artist, poisoner and
forger. It was for the forging crime he was
transported to V.D. Land, arriving
aboard the “Susan”, July 1857. It is
reported that he sought and was granted
permission to occasionally leave the
Hobart Jail for the purpose of drawing
the local female celebrities. It was during
the last six years of his life, 1841-47, that
he drew his Tasmanian portraits, al-
though frequently an inmate of the St.
Mary’s Hospital, where he was under the
friendly care of the Rev. Wm. Bedford
one of the hospital’s founders. Robt.
Crossland, in his “Wainewright in
Tasmania”, 0.U.P., 1954, fully vindi-
cates the character of Wainewright by
disproving the erroneous reports so
freely distributed by such writers as Chas.
Dickens, Dr Wm. Crooke, T. N.
Talfourd, and others. Wainewright died
of apoplexy in the Hobart Convict
Hospital, Aug. 17, 1847. See illus. p. 41. '

George Washington Walker, a Quaker
who had made a famous journey with
James Backhouse, investigating con-
ditions among settlers and natives in
Australia and South Africa. He was
educated in England and studied law,
but his major interest was in the study of
Tasmania itself. He was actively involved
in the formation of the Royal Society of
Tasmania, and also the University of
Tasmania, serving as a member of the
council of the Society and as Vice-
Chancellor of the University. Several of
his papers on early Tasmania, read before
the Society, were published in 1902.

WASHINGTON, George, 1732-99. Soldier,
statesman, first President of the U.S.A.
By early 1795 the news of the trial of
Thomas Muir and his companions had
awakened a sincere desire among many
prominent Americans to afford them
every possible assistance in gaining their
liberty. It is said of Washington that he
ordered the fitting out of the “Otter” and
instructed Captain Dorr to proceed with
her direct from New York to Sydney
Cove. Upon the arrival of the “Otter”,
Feb. 1796, part of her crew called on
Govr. Hunter to pay the usual respects
and also to obtain his co-operation to
supply fresh water and ship’s stores.
Whilst engaged on their requirements
the other members of the crew located
the whereabouts of Muir and hastily
secreted him aboard the “Otter” and at
once made for the open sea. Long before
this daring episode was detected Muir
was well on the way to U.S.A. His two
companions, Gerrald, and Skirving, were
both very sick men and so unable to
share the excitement and gratitude of
successful escape. Also see under Muir,

WHITAKER, Sir Frederick, 1812-91. Prac-
tised law in Kororareka and Auckland on
his arrival in New Zealand in 1840, and
soon developed extensive commercial
interests, before becoming involved in
politics. He was Superintendent of
Auckland from 1865 to 1867, and a
member of either the House of Represen-
tatives or the Legislative Council from
1853 to I^9 I with only one lengthy break
between 1867 and 1876. He served as
Attorney General in several administra-
tions, and as both Premier and Attorney
General in 1863-64 and 1882-83. During
his first premiership, his cabinet led the
Auckland “pro-war” party in opposition
to the Governor and passed strong
measures to crush “rebellion” and con-
fiscate large areas of land. The influence
of his commercial interests may be traced
in his political activities —often to the
detriment of his reputation—but he was
also an early advocate of manhood
suffrage and proportional representation.

WHITE, John, 1755-1832. Appointed Sur-
geon-General in Oct. 1786, and in the
following March joined the “First Fleet”
at Plymouth then awaiting departure to
New South Wales under the command of
Capt. Athur Phillip. During the voyage
out his sensible and humane conduct
towards the convicts greatly relieved
much of their misery which was created
by the iron rule and indifference of
official command. The Fleet arrived at
Port Jackson Jan. 1788. White organised
a hospital, but was greatly handicapped
by lack of medical necessities. His interest
in the flora and fauna of the new Colony
is depicted in his “Journal of a Voyage to
New South Wales”, London, 1790, 4t0.,
containing 65 coloured plates of birds,
animals and botanical specimens, and is
possibly the first colour-plate book on
Australia. In December 1794, White left
the Settlement and returned to England,
holding rather a pessimistic outlook con-
cerning its future success. For the follow-
ing twenty-five years he remained in the
Naval Service as surgeon, first on the
“Royal William”, and later at Sheerness,
and Chatham dockyard. He died at
Worthing, Sussex, Feb. 20, 1832.

letter dated: Windsor Castle, March 30,
1834, in answer to Lord Melbourne’s
letter of the previous day, wherein the
Royal fear of the recent trial of the
Dorchester labourers is quite noticeable.
The letter is full of suggestive action
against, as he imagined, the recent
revolutionary trend shown by certain
discontented persons. He was the founder

WILLIAMS, Sir John, 1777-1846. The Judge
who presided over the trial of the six
Dorchester labourers, Tolpuddle Martyrs,
at the County Hall, Dorchester, Sat.
March 15, 1834. On Wednesday, March
19, he delivered the sentence upon each
of the six unfortunates: “I feel I have no
discretion in a case of this sort, but that
I am bound to pronounce a sentence of
the law, which the Act of Parliament has
provided, and accordingly the sentence
is that you and each of you be Trans-
ported ... for 7 years.” One hundred
years later, Sir Stafford Cripps, when
considering the Judge’s conduct through-
out the trial, concluded that Judge
Williams was a “violent advocate for the
Prosecution”. In 1834 Williams was
promoted to the Bench as a Baron of the
Exchequer.
