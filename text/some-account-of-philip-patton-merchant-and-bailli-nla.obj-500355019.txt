Philip, Charles, Robert, David, and Helen, Janet, Margaret. Of his
ancestors, Gourlay says (“ Anstruther,” Co. Fife, by Robt. Gourlay,
1888) that Bailie Philip Patton could trace his pedigree, in Anstruther,
to the days of Queen Mary, but there is no account extant beyond a
family tradition that his grandfather served as a naval officer at the
battle of La Hogue (1692), where his life was saved by a large silver
tobacco box, in which a musket shot lodged, and which was afterwards
melted down and made into a cup. Mr. Patton is stated in his son’s

Extract from Parish Register of Anstruther, Fife.
Extract from “ Fifiana," or Memoir* of the East of Fife, by Mr. F. Conolly.
Colonel Patton, of Kinaldy, in the Parish of Dunino, was born at
Anstruther in 1743, and was educated at the Burgh School, and afterwards
at the University of St. Andrew. He entered the service of the Honourable
East India Company at an early age, and proceeded to India (in 1764). The
Colonel was a literary man. He wrote an Historical Review of Rome, which was
appended to the work of his brother Capt. Charles Patton, R.N., on the “ Effects
of Property on Society and Government” ; also a work on the “Principles of
Asiatic Governments,” and minor works without his name on the subjects of the
day. He possessed a refined and accomplished mind, and wrote several Poetical
works, and also translations of the Classic Roman Poets, which were found in Mss.
after his death. He was Military Secretary to the celebrated Warren Hastings,
when Governor General of India, and for whom he had the greatest admiration
and esteem, and, with every lover of justice, was most indignant at his prosecution
and protracted trial during 9 years. He married Miss Gonstantia Adriana
Mapletoft (on 31st July, 1772), and left India with her in 1775 in consequence
of bad health. They had a family of 17 children, and lived at Kinaldy from 1775
to the end of the century. About 1797 he had a house in Castle Street,
Edinburgh, which he occupied for some years before his appointment as Governor
of St. Helena, which took place in 1801. He held that responsible post about
7 years, and returned to England in 1808. He died at Wallington, near Fareham,
Hants, on 14th January, 1812.

To the Honble. Warren Hastings, Esq.,
Governor General, &0.,
and the Gentlemen of the Council.
Honble. Sir and Sirs,
After having resided upwards of eleven years in this country
in the service of the Honble. Company, I find my health of late so much
impaired that I judge it necessary on that account to return to Europe,
to which I am further induced by other considerations respecting myself
and my family, I am therefore to request your permission to resign
the Commission I have hitherto held in the Company’s service, and to
take my passage on board the Anson. I should esteem it an indulgence
if I might be permitted to hold my rank in the Service till the despatch
of that ship.
I have the honour to be with the greatest respect,
Honble. Sir and Sirs,
Your most obedient humble Servant,
ROBERT PATTON.

To John Stewart, Esq.,

Sir,
I must request the favour of you to obtain the authority of the
Honble. Board, for my embarking with my family on board the Anson,
Capt. Tryon, to proceed to Europe; and lam desired by Mrs. Mapletoft
and Mrs. Wynne to submit the same favour for them. I enclose a list
of the names, and the attendants, for whom we will respectively enter
into the-usual obligations,
I am, Sir,
Your most obedient Servant,
ROBERT PATTON.

5. Anna Maria, born during her parents residence at Kinaldy ; accom-
panied them when they moved to Castle St., Edinburgh, about

intimate with many of the literary celebrities of the day ;
amongst others, with the Rev. Sydney Smith, who presented her
with 2 Volumes of his Sermons, now in the possession of her
son G. W. W.
In 1802 she accompanied her father to St. Helena, with her
sisters Sally and Jessie, their mother remaining at home with
the younger children, and kept house for him during his
Governorship of the Island, which ended in 1807. The Island
was a post of great importance in those war times, and a port of
call and rendezvous for men-of-war, East India Company’s vessels,
South Sea Whalers, and other ships : and there, among others,
she made the acquaintance of Charles Grant and of the Honble,
Arthur Wellesley, afterwards the great Duke of Wellington ; and
her sisters met their husbands, Henry Torrens, Adjutant General of
the Army, and John Paterson, Commander of the H.E.I.C. Ship,
The Castle Huntley. It was in 1809 that she met her husband
in India, Captain George Warren Walker', of the Bth Royal Irish
Dragoons.
In 1819, she accompanied him to Ceylon, where he had been
appointed Deputy Adjt. General on the Staff, and remained
there till 1826, when he came home on furlough. In 1831
she left home to rejoin him in Ceylon, accompanied by her two
eldest daughters, who both manned there ; her four sons and
youngest daughter being left behind for education. Her next
move was to India in 1839, where her husband took up the
command of H.M. 21st Royal North British Fusiliers at
Chinsurah for a time, till his promotion to the rank of a Major
General in India, and appointment to Command of the Meerut
Brigade. It had to be vacated in 1843, his Regiment having
been transferred to the Madras Presidency, and while waiting at
St. Thomas’s Mount for a vacant Brigade, he died there on the
4th December of that year.
Thenceforth, till her death on the Bth September, 1852, she
lived, first with her son Henry at Cannanore, ’and afterwards
with her daughters Georgeanna and Selina, and her son Warren
at Mangalore, where her son-in-law Mr. Findlay Anderson was
Judge (afterwards a Judge of the High Court of Madras).

The Life Story of Mrs. Mapletoft, née Sally Beale, and her
Children.
On the retaking of the Island of St. Helena from the Dutch in the year
1673, by the Squadron under command of Captain Sir Richard Munden,
R.N., Captain Richard Field, R.N., was appointed Governor by Royal
Commission of King Charles 11., dated 19th December of that year; and
Captain Anthony Beale, who had been Governor in 1672, when the
Dutch took the Island by surprise, was appointed his Deputy, with
power of succession “in case of his death or removal.” Such promotion,
however, never occurred, and Captain Beale was poisoned by his black
servant (or slave) in 1683.
The family then appears to have met with great misfortunes, for
his orphans are stated in Minutes of Consultation of the year 1709-10,
to have been deprived of their property by Mr. George Hoskinson, a
man of extremely bad character, but of such influence as to have been
Deputy Governor for a short time. Owing to which circumstances is
probably due the migration of Mrs. Sarah Beale (n6e Bodley) to Calcutta,
where her daughter Sarah (although called a native of St. Helena on
her tombstone at that Island) was baptized on the sth February, 1728,
the father having apparently died at St. Helena, or on board ship.
Sarah Beale (junior) married early Mr. Henry Palmer, a Calcutta
merchant, who died in 1743, and by whom she had two children,
Elizabeth Martha, born in 1742, and Henry John, born in 1743, both
of whom died young. She married 2ndly James Irwin, Esq., of the
Honble. East India Company’s Service, by whom, who died on 29th
June, 1752, she had three children, James, Eyles, and Sally.

Mrs. Irwin married 3rdly, on 31st March, 1753, the Rev. Robert
Mapletoft, by whom she had three children, viz :
Anna Maria, baptized 12th March, 1754.
Robert, baptized 30th October, 1755 ; died at Byfield Rectory, Northants,
in 1761.
Constantia Adriana Sally, born in 1756, died in 1811.
In the interval between these two latter births occurred the memorable
siege of Fort William, Calcutta, by the Nawab Suraj-ed-Daula, and the
Tragedy of the Black Hole ; in the former of which Mr. Mapletoft
served as Captain-Lieutenant of the Calcutta Militia (most of them
covenanted servants of the Company), and from the latter he was saved
in the manner described by Mr. Holwell, the Deputy President, in his
“ Indian Tracts ” which include the “ Genuine Narrative of the deplo-
rable deaths of the English Gentlemen and others who were suffocated
in the Black Hole of Calcutta.”


The enemy first appeared before Calcutta on the 16th June, 1756,
and by the 18th the case of the besieged was found to be so desperate
that the Council of War that afternoon ordered the embarkation of the
English women on board the Dodaly and other ships then lying off the
Fort. It was about 11 at night that Mrs. Mapletoft with some others
were persuaded by Mr. Holwell himself to take refuge, with their
children, on board the Diligence, a ship under his direction. “ Early in
“ the morning of the 19th,” Holwell says, “ the President, Mr. Mackett,
“ the Rev. Mr. Mapletoft, myself and others, were employed in cutting
“ open the bales of cotton, and filling it in bags, to carry it upon the
“parapets.” When such work was completed, those gentlemen, whose
families were embarked, were given leave to visit them and deposit in
their care their papers and valuables. While Mapletoft was availing
himself of this permission, without the slightest idea (Mr. Holwell
vouches for it) of what was about to happen, President Drake suddenly
went on board the Dodaly and ordered it and every other vessel to drop
down to a safe distance with the ebbing tide. By noon on the 20th
(Ist Sunday after Trinity) there were but 150 men left under Hoi well’s
command, 50 of them wounded, and by 6 o’clock that evening the
Nawab was in possession of Fort William.
Thus the Rev. Captain-Lieutenant escaped the Black Hole wherein
nearly all his comrades perished, but only to die a few months later of
fever at Fulta, a “despicable village” 30 miles down the Hugh, under
the cover of a small Dutch Fort. Holwell writes of him and a few of
his brother officers as “ Gentlemen who failed in no part of their duty,
either as Officers or Soldiers in the defence of the place.”
His wife and two children found refuge with the Dutch Governor
of Chinsurah, Adrian Bisdom and his wife Amelia Constantia, and when
the expected child was born they stood Godparents, and she was chris-
tened Constantia Adriana Sally. On the return of the English to
Calcutta Mrs. Mapletoft took up her abode there, sending her children
home in 1758 to their grandfather, the Rev, John Mapletoft, at Byfield
Rectory, where the boy died, but his sisters rejoined her at a later date.
The marriage of the younger to Capt. Robert Patton has already been
recorded at page 9of this record. Of the elder the following events
are similarly chronicled as follows, viz :
In the Marriage Register of St. John’s, Calcutta :
25th August, 1770. Mr. William Wynne, Secretary, to Miss Anna
Maria Mapletoft.
In the Baptismal Registry of St. John’s is the following entry;
14th January, 1772. Anna Maria, daughter of Mr. William Wynne
and Anna Maria his wife.
In the Register of Baptisms of the “ Out Settlements ” of Calcutta.
27th February, 1773. William, son of Mr. William Wynne and Anna
Maria his wife.
Mr. William Wynne died at Calcutta previous to the year 1775, in
March of which year his widow and children went home to England with


her brother in law (Captain Robert Patton) and sister, and mother (Mrs.
Mapletoft), whom they dropped at St. Helena en route, where she died
on the Bth September, 1792. Of their two children, William died young,
and Anna Maria married Sir James de Bathe, Bart., and had issue :
James and William Plunkett (afterwards Sir William).
Mrs. Wynne married 2ndly Captain Robert Brooke. H.E.1.C.5., of
Prosperous, County Kildare, Ireland, who afterwards became Governor
of St. Helena from 1788 to 1801. They had 3 children ;

10. Herbert Augustus.
11. Walter Braikenridge, who died in infancy.
12. Patrick Grieve.
Sally Beale, alias Palmer, alias Irwin, alias Mapletoft, had an
adventurous career. Born at St. Helena, landed at Calcutta an infant
waif and stray in 1728, she endured the vicissitudes of Indian life in
those troubled times, which came to a climax in 1757 in the siege of
Fort William, which she shared, and the Black Hole which she narrowly
escaped, and terminated gloriously in the victory of Plassey, under Clive,
and the successful Government of Warren Hastings, whose Civil and
Military Secretaries became her sons-in-law. It was a period the events
and manners and customs of which are cleverly delineated, in the
literary style of the day, by the Authoress of “ Like another Helen ; ”
who does not, however, do the justice to Mr. Mapletoft’s character that
Mr. Holwell (better informed) has done.


Mrs. Mapletoft finally returned to her native Island in 1775 ; lived to
see her son-in-law, Colonel Brooke, Governor of it in 1778 (and her elder
daughter and three grandchildren with him), dying there in 1792, as
recorded on her tombstone at St. James’s Church, James Town, in the
grandiloquent phraseology of the Georgian era. But she must have
been a strong minded and courageous old lady, deserving to be chroni-
cled as “no obscure character.” There is an authentic family tradition
that she was a staunch Jacobite, and that when King George was
prayed for in Church, she would take snuff to show her contempt for
him ; which conduct, however, could not have been approved of by her
Reverend husband, devoted adherent though he, too, must have been to
the old cause, as became a near relative of the Ferrar family of Little
Gidding celebrity, whose connection with the Mapletofts is shown
further on.

JOHN MAPLETOFT, 1631-1720.
Reprinted from the BRITISH MEDICAL .JOURNAL, January sth, 1929.
John Mapletoft, to whom Sydenham dedicated the third
edition of his Medical Observations, was the son of the
Rev. Joshua Mapletoft, vicar of Margaretting in Essex,
and the godson and great-nephew of Nicholas Ferrar, jun.,
of Little Guiding. He was horn at Margaretting in 1631,
and in 1635, when lie was 4 years old, his father died.
Thereupon his godfather, Nicholas Ferrar, took charge of
him and brought him up in the devout family community
which he (Ferrar) had founded there. John Mapletoft
was educated at Westminster under Dr. Busby; here he
met John Locke, and formed a friendship with him that
lasted all through their lives. Ho was originally intended
for Holy orders, but the troublous times of the Civil War
postponed the fulfilment of his desire. In 1648 he went
from Westminster to Trinity College, Cambridge, took
his B.A. degree in 1651, became a Fellow of his college in
1653, and in 1654 was incorporated' B.A. at Oxford. He
was expelled from his Fellowship by the Parliamentary
Visitors, and, with many other graduates of Cambridge
who were forced to leave Cambridge for their loyalty,
retired to Oxford. Possibly he took this step for the
reason given by Anthony Wood, “ to avoid the cruelties
and barbarities of the presbvterians.” But Wood mentions
another reason in his Fasti Oxonienses (under the year
1655), where ho says that many of the graduates by
incorporation came to Oxford “ for the sake of the public
library.” In the case of Mapletoft the cause is not clear,
because in 1655 he proceeded to the M.A. degree at
Cambridge.
For three years (1658-1660) he travelled as tutor t:
Joscelyn, sun of Algernon, last Earl of Northumberland,
After 1660 he studied medicine in Italy, and, having be---,
restored to his Fellowship, took his M.D. degree :■
Cambridge. Then he practised in London, where he made
the acquaintance of many eminent physicians—Willis, Ccx,
and Sydenham—continuing there his close friendship with
Locke. An interesting event occurred at Oxford in 1669.
“ This year,” to quote Anthony Wood again, “ Sheldon’s Theatre
being opened, and dedicated for a learned use was a most splendid
Act celebrated therein on the 12th of July and very many Cambridge
men coming to the solemnity . . . were incorporated in a Congre-
gation held in the House of Convocation the next day.”
[2/291


Among the Cambridge men thus honoured was John
Mapletoft, described by Wood as “ afterwards Professor of
Physic in Gresham College and Fellow of the Royal
Society.” His first lecture as Gresham Professor was
delivered in 1675. I nlike his fr iend Sydenham, who makes
no mention of the work of Harvey, Mapletoft devotes
considerable attention to this work.
“ I will begin,” he says, “ with that celebrated and useful dis-
covery which was first made and published to the learned world by
John Mapletoft.
that, ornament, of bis own ago and of this nation to all ages, (ho
judicious Dr. Harvey concerning the motion of the heart, and
circulation of the blood.”
His admiration for Harvey did not end with mere words
of eulogy; Mapletoft presented to the Royal Society that
well-known portrait of Harvey in a skull cap which hangs
in the rooms of the Royal Society at Burlington House.
When he resigned the Gresham Professorship in October,
1679, Mapletoft retired from the practice of medicine, an
occasion which caused John Locke to write regretfullv to
him; “ 1 like our calling the worse since you have quitted


it.” Tu November, 1679, at the age of 48, he married
Rebecca, daughter of Lucas Knightley of Hackney, a
Hamburg merchant, and lived in the country to prepare
himself quietly for Holy orders. He was ordained deacon
and priest in 1682, and became rector of Braybrooko in
Northamptonshire soon after. In 1684 he was appointed
vicar of St. Lawrence Jewry. In 1689 this remarkable
man, who had seen Charles I visit Little Gidding in
1642, and again in his flight for safety in 1646,
Rebecca Maplotoft (née Knightley).
had the degree of D.D. conferred upon him when
King William went to Cambridge. His ministry was
no mere leisured evening to his life, for he was
one of the active promoters and founders of the Society
for the Propagation of the Gos|>el in Foreign Parts,
a member of the Society for the Promotion of Christian
Knowledge, president of Sion College, and a director of
Greenwich Hospital. In 1710, after a serious illness, John
Mapletoft resigned his living, and spent his last years in
the house of his daughter and her husband, Dr. Gastrell,
Bishop of Chester. There he enjoyed a soft and gentle
old age, preserving to the last a gaiety and cheerfulness of


temper, seeming always desirous to gain the affections of
those about him that ho might engage them to virtue and
religion. He clung affectionately to the recollections of his
early life in the family community of the Ferrars, giving
to his son a Gidding Concordance, in which ho wrote:
“ I desire that it may be preserved in his family as long as
may be.” His long life covered an era in English history
full of strife and change, yet such was the largeness of his
heart that he could number among his friends Sydenham,
who was one of Cromwell’s captains, and Locke, whose
father had been a captain in the Parliamentarian forces.
He died in 1721, and was buried under the altar in
St. Lawrence Jewry.
The portraits of John Maplctoft and his wife which illus-
trate this article are by John Riley, a well-known Court
painter, whose fame has been depressed by his best works
having been ascribed to Lely. Charles 11, Janies 11 and his
queen, and William and Mary all sat to him. We have
been enabled to publish photographs of these portraits by
the kindness of one of his descendants, Mr. A. J. Leonard
of Bristol.
The portraits are at present in possession of Mr. J.
Burford Leonard of 7, Hughcnden Avenue, Belfast, who
has had them photographed, and has generously sent prints
for reproduction in the Journal. One of John Mapletoft’s
daughters married the Rev. Edward Burford, in whose
family the portraits have been handed down as heirlooms,
and have thus become the highly prized inheritance of
Mr. Burford Leonard.
