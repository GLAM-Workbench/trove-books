CURRAMULKA INSTITUTE JUBILEE
“BACK TO CURRAMULKA”
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of
the opening of the Institute building, the
present committee decided to hold a
"Back to Curramulka” to mark the occa-
sion, and to give former residents an
opportunity to re-visit their old home
town. The Officers and Committee ex-
tend to the visitors a hearty welcome, and
hope that their short visit to the town
will prove pleasant and enjoyable.
SOME EARLY RECORDS
The early records do not contain the
exact date when the first meeting of
residents was held to consider the erection
of an Institute building, but the minutes
show that a meeting was held in 1883,
probably about April, at the Curramulka
Hotel, when the subject was discussed
and the following gentlemen were ap-
pointed officers:—President, Mr. R. F.
Wilson; Vice-President, Mr. W. McDon-
ald; Secretary, Mr. J. S. McLeod; Trea-
surer, Mr. A. Douglas; Auditor, Messrs.
John Thomas and R. C. Jones; Commit-
tee: President, Vice-President and Secre-
tary, and Messrs. F. J. Bickers, S.
Goldsworthy, John Clucas, A. Douglas,
J. Parsons, A. Johnston, R. A. Tucker,
F. Gregor, R. Kappler.
At the second meeting on June 2, 1883,
the following were elected trustees, Messrs.
W. McDonald (chairman), T. J. Bickers,
R. A. Douglas, R. A. Tucker, J. Parsons.
On November 17th, 1883, it was de-
cided to call tenders for the erection of
an Institute building to conform to plans
of the Enfield Institute. Dimensions to
be: Hall, 45 ft. x 30 ft.; Library, 15 ft.
x 12 ft.; Ladies’ Dressing Room, 10 ft.
x 9 ft.; Gent’s Dressing Room, 10 ft. x
9 ft.
On December 18th, 1883, the follow-
ing tenders were received:—H. Kasby,
£1,061/10/-; W. Dainty, £1,043/10/-; R.
Angwin, £907; Hill dc Coy., £986/15/-;
Robertson &C Milgraith, £868; J. Jenkins,
£846; D. Beer, £628; C. H. Marlow,
£560; D. Sharp, £610; W. Boundy,
£1,050.
On January 22, 1884, the tender of
Mr. C. H. Marlow, of Minlaton, was
accepted with instructions to commence
building operations on March Ist, 1884.
During the course of erection the arch
over the stage collapsed, under heavy
southerly winds and rains. Owing to
the extra expense involved through this
dela- Mr. Marlow could not fulfil his
contract. At a meeting of the committee
on November 22nd, 1884, the tender of
J. Swan 6C Son, of Maitland, for £320,
was accepted for the completion of the
Institute. The building was opened by
Mr. Calder, M.P., and the first public
meeting was held in the Committee Room
on March 7th, 1885. The rules of the
Institute were adopted at a general meet-
ing held on June 11th, 1885, and Mr.
W. McDonald was chairman, and Mr.
Tom J. Bickers, honorary secretary.
This building served the needs of the
town and district until 1906, when owing
to increasing demands for further space
it was decided to make certain alterations
and additions, including the floor to be
increased to 65 feet in length, with a
stage 16 feet deep and full width of
hall. The tender of Mr. C. R. Goldfinch
for £295 was accepted for carrying out
the work. The official opening of the
re-constructed building was held on
August 23rd, 1907.
On April sth, 1922, a spacious supper
room was added to the existing buildings.
This has proved a great boon when func-
tions have been held in the main hall.
The building cost £654. Mr. T. M.
Crocker was the contractor.
In 1923, at a cost of £3OO a new ceil-
ing was added, also painting and re-
pairs carried out. A cinema box was
installed in 1926.
The Institute is managed by a com-
mittee elected by the subscribers. The
present members are: Messrs. L. Juers
(President), H. L. Gifford (Secretary),
G. E. Lovelock, A, Pointon, N. Morton,
S. F. Tucker, N. E. Kleeman, C. May,
L. R. Watters, A. B. Jellett, C. G. Kemp,
W. A. S. Hanold, Dr. A. V. Hillier.


INTERESTING ITEMS
Owing to a difficulty arising.in obtain-
ing guarantors the District Council of
Minlaton has taken over the position of
guarantors.
At a meeting held on March 2, 1935,
Messrs. E. A. McDonald and Walter
Pointon were elected life members of the
Institute. Mr. McDonald, now a resident
of Glenelg, for many years was a
staunch member of the Institute Com-
mittee, he also occupied the position of
president for some years. Mr. Pointon,
a well-known resident of Curramulka, was
also a member of the Institute Commit-
tee for many years. For their loyal
support in the past these gentlemen were
elected life members of the Institute.
Mr. S. F. Tucker was secretary of the
Institute for a period of 18 years.
HISTORICAL NOTES ON THE TOWNSHIP
AND HUNDRED OF CURRAMULKA
Curramulka is a Government town in
the Hundred of Curramulka, County of
Ferguson, Yorke Peninsula, South Aus-
tralia.
The town was surveyed by Charles
Hope Harris, in July, 1878, named by
Governor Jervois, and Gazetted 12th
September, 1878.
Allotments in the town were offered
at auction on the 10th October, 1878,
and various later dates. 17 lots were
purchased by James March Stone, 10 by
Richard Casserly Jones, 10 by Kennedy
Kappler, all of Curramulka, and other
lots purchased by various owners.
£2/5/- was the lowest price paid, that
being for Allotment No. 125, in 1879.
The highest price realised was for lots
47 and 184, sold in 1878 and 1911 re-
spectively, each realising £26.
The suburban sections were surveyed
in 1878 and 1880. Among the pur-
chasers were Cotton and Opie, J. J.
Stuckey, Walter Reynell and C. A.
Reinecke, all of Adelaide, and James
March Stone, Robert Frazer Wilson, Ren-
ney Kappler and John Johnstone, all of
Curramulka.
Among the early settlers taking up land
adjacent to the township were: Douglas
Thomas, William Miles, Thomas Golds-
worthy and Stephen Goldsworthy.
HOW NAMED
According to the late Mr. Rodney
Cockburn the word Curramulka is made
up of two native words—Curre (emu)
and Mulka (deep water hole). "Emus,”
he says in his Nomenclature of South
Australia, "used to stoop down to drink
and fall in, thus allowing themselves to
be caught by the natives, who called the
place Curre Mulka.” In a letter to Mr.
Cockburn, a Mr. R. Higgins states that
he had been told by an old Yorke Pen-
insula settler that the native name was
pronounced "curra-murrka,” meaning
"emu rock holes,” owing to the number
of small saucer-like holes in the surface
of the bare limestone at which the emus
used to drink. (See photo on page 16)
The Hundred of Curramulka was
Gazetted on December 31st, 1874, and
there is in the Public Library, Adelaide,
an old official plan, dated 1876, of the
"newly opened lands at Curramulka.”
RIFLE COMPANY
In the early eighteen eighties the dis-
trict was represented in the Volunteer
Forces of the Colony under the Rifle Com-
panies’ Act of 1878. This Act pro-
vided for the formation of companies of
twenty or more riflemen, who were to be
supplied with rifles and ammunition by
the Government, and were to receive the
same pay as ordinary volunteers. Each
company was to be named after the dis-
trict in which it was raised. In this way
the Curramulka Rifle Company, consist-
ing of a about a score of men, came into
existence in 1881, and functioned for
about five years. There is in the Ar-
chives a list, on parchment, of the men
who were enrolled during the year 1881,
1882, and 1883.

LIBRARIAN FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS.
Probably what constitutes a record, or
nearly so, is that held by the present
librarian of the Curramulka Institute.
Mr. A. J. Martin has occupied the posi-
tion of librarian for a period of forty-
eight and a half years. He has been a
resident of Curramulka for fifty-two years
and has seen many changes in the dis-
trict during that time. Many years ago
Mr. Martin was * a member of the Insti-
tute Committee and was also caretaker.
Although now of an advanced age this
elderly gentleman still performs his duties
with integrity, and is noted particularly
for his punctuality by those who obtain
books from the library.
