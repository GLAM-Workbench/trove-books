Foreword.
The "Orari Tatler" is published in its present form,
not because of any intrinsic literary merit of matter
or style, but simply and solely as a souvenir of a
particularly happy sojourn on board H.M.N.Z. transport
"Orari'' No. 6.
Those who have gone to the expense of publishing it
trust that in days to come it will serve as a genial
reminder of the incidents on the way; of the camaraderie
of the ship's company, of the places we visited and the
persons we met, of the things that instructed and amused
us, and of many happy friendships formed during our
seven weeks' intercourse.
We regret the delay in publication, which was
unavoidable, and hope that the appearance and style
of the magazine will amply compensate for any
disappointment in that connection.

No. I. Vol. I. AT SEA. 24th Oct. 1914.
T IS with no little pleasure that we make
1 our bow to the Orari public. All the
more that the difficulties of publication
have been well nigh insurmountable. The
Tatler will endeavour to impartially chronicle all
the happenings of the voyage, and, needless to
say, all the important world happenings, special
arrangements having been made for the receipt of
wireless messages from the ''front" and from the
"back". Being new to the business of editing a
modern newspaper, and not having an up-to-date
printing plant, we crave the indulgence of our
readers if, in any respect, we seem to come short of
the newspaper ideal. For the purposes of this
publication we want, not only literary flavour, but
plenty of "snap", and we shall have to depend very
largely upon contributors for these qualities. We
invite officers and men to unite with us in making
the Tatler a worthy record of what promises to be a
remarkable voyage. Our columns will be open to


correspondence on any question affecting the public
welfare, from the quality of "bully beef' to the
temperature of No. 5 horse deck. We invite
discussion upon any question that is agitating the
public mind. Legitimate criticism of men and things
will be gladly received as long as gross personalities
are not indulged in. Literary contributions, grave
and gay, will also be welcomed, and we beg to state
for the encouragement of our contributors that our
rates of pay are on the most liberal scale. Whatever
may be said of the letterpress we can vouch for the
excellence of our illustrations, which will continue
to be a feature of future issues, save and except
when our artist is suffering from the prevailing
malady. We are trying to make arrangements for
sporting, musical, and social columns. The editoi
of the last named column wickedly suggests that
pars will be scarce since we have none of the fair
sex on board; but we are confident that he is wrong,
our own experience being that men are gi eater
gossips that women ! We have seen men wink at one
another when they have come across two women
retailing their gossip over the palings of a dividing
fence, emphasising their points with heads and
hands : but get the same men in the smoking room
and the women are nowhere in comparison. We
therefore hope to provide our readers with some
spicy items from week to week. A leceiving box
for contributions will be placed in some convenient
part of the ship. Our fighting editor weighs six-
teen stone, and will always be on hand when an
irate reader wishes an interview regarding any
statement published in the Tatler.

Locals.
The only reference to our presence which the Hobart
Mercury permitted itself was in a leading article on the local
show, in which it said, "Wars may come and wars may go ?
droughts may come, and droughts may go ? ships may come
and ships may go ?men may come and men may go, but
like the Brook, the Show must go on as usual."

Trooper M. Murphy had the misfortune to have his hand
crushed by one of the horses on Sunday last necessitating
the amputation of the little finger of the right hand. The
patient is making good progress towards recovery.
?�r
* *
General regret was felt at the necessity of having to
leave Trooper Morgan of Masterton behind us in the Hobart
Public Hospital. He was deeply disappointed himself, but
bore himself bravely in the circumstances. He found that
two members of the force had preceded him, one from the
Tahiti and one from the Waimana. The matron and
sisters assured us that every thing possible would be done
for their comfort.

We learn that the Tasmamian Contingent, numbering
about 2,000 (officers and men) in two transports, left on
Tuesday, and are waiting to join us somewhere round the
coast.

The Minotaur our Battle Cruiser escort, is of 14,000 tons,
has a nominal speed of 23 knots, and can steam 26. The
I'Buki is a cruiser of 16,000 tons, has a nominal speed
of 20 knots, and can steam 23.


The route march on Thursday was a veritable battle of
fruit and flowers. We have written elsewhere of the volleys of
fruit discharged at the troops. Some of the Hobart flower
gardens must have been well stripped. One of the foot
regiments looked like a garden as it passed the saluting
base. Our own piper received a good deal of attention.
One lady in a motor car threw him a button hole which,
as he was blowing a martial air through his chanter, had
to lie in the road. Not to be beaten, she got a gentleman
in the car to jump out and pin a second to his coat. A bent
old lady who evidently " had the Gaelic" was greatly
moved at the sight and the sound of the pipes, and called
down blessings on the piper's " curly pow".
*
* *
We understand that the guard at the wharf barrier had
an exciting time in our absence. It sustained a frontal attack,
thro' an unexpected visit from the G. O. C. Some members
of the party were in the goods shed, and others were very
much "at ease", the gallant officer in charge being
distracted by the attentions of some members of the fair
sex. However, a noble effort was made to retrieve the
situation. One member of the party in his eagerness to
get into position tripped, and fell full length on the wharf!
Another tried to fix his bayonet and stand at attention in
one act, which was a complete failure. What the G. O. C.
thought of the comedy has not transpired.
*
* *
Two rejected troopers, Wellington stowaways, have
come out into the open since we left Hobart, and have
thrown themselves on the mercy of the O. C. We must
try to get some "copy" from them. An account of their
refuge, and of their experiences during last Saturday and
Sunday for example would be interesting to say the least
of it. One of our officers is rejoicing over the " prodigal "
in the shape of a restored batman, whose services he had
sorely missed.
*
* *
Was it magic ? Just before leaving the wharf some
cases were taken aboard for the canteen. They were passed


from hand to hand, and stacked uponthe deck in the
presence of quite a number of onlookers. The tally on
the wharf was correct, but when compared with the deck
tally three cases had mysteriously melted into thin air:
nor could any trace of them be found, altho' the most diligent
search was made.
' ***
Can any but a Scot decipher the following puzzle ?
'oo? ay, 'oo. a' 'oo ? ay, a' 'oo. a' ae 'oo ? ay, a, ae 'oo.
Strange as it may seem this is a conversation.

At a meeting convened for the purpose it was decided to
call the paper the Orari Tatler, to appoint Chaplain Major
Grant as editor, with Captain McLean, Lieut. Logan and
the editor as a Press Committee.

Day by Day.
FRIDAY 16th OCTOBER.
This morning at daylight our escort slipped out of
Wellington harbour, and one by one the transports followed,
one squadron of five lead by the Psyche and another by the
Philomel. By eight o'clock all had cleared the heads, and the New
Zealand Expeditionary Force had begun to make history. We
found the straits, for a wonder, like the proverbial millpond, and
throughout the day we sailed over "summer seas" and hugged
ourselves at our good fortune. Passing through the straits we
sailed in a double line of five, the British cruiser Minotaur
six miles ahead, the /' Buki six miles on the starboard, the Psyche
on the port, and the Philomel bringing up the rear. As the
land passed out of sight our hearts were filled with thoughts of
home and loved ones, and we wondered when again we should
look upon the rugged coast of our "fair island home".
Doubtless as we gazed across the watery expanse many a "God
bless them" was whispered into the night, even by men who
seldom pray. Official log. Distance 44 knots. Smooth sea.
Light breeze.
SATURDAY 17th OCTOBER.
"The scene was changed". During the night a light
drizzling rain set in, the wind freshened, and we began to roll
through a choppy sea. There was a very poor response to
"Reveille", and at "stables" the blithe hearts and the willing
hands of yesterday were conspicuous by their absence. Some
of the horse decks were almost deserted, and the men who were
on duty had to do the work of five and even ten in some cases.
To day most of the men would be an easy prey for the Germans.
One man thought he was dying : his only fear being that he
wouldn't. There were several volunteers for service, the
"Batchelor" and "Forceps" being worthy of special mention
both having worked like Trojans. The cooks had an easy time


of it. There was no "sound of revelry by night" only the
lamentable sounds that accompany one's first r acquaintance
with the rough motions of the sea. The horses had to move
about in order to keep on an "even keel" and on the whole the
swell has done them no harm. Official log. Dist. run. 260 knots.
Fresh to strong S.S.W. breeze, rough sea and swell.
SUNDAY 18th OCTOBER.
There is no improvement in the weather conditions. The Expe-
ditionary Force is being laid low, but not by the Germans. We
mourn several "vacant chairs" at the Junior Officers' mess, and
it is an effort for some who are present to be moderately
cheerful. In some cases appetites are not quite as hearty as
usual, and even "Tiny" misses a meal through "tiredness" and a
desire to "discipline his appetite". Church parade is down in
orders for 9.45 a.m. on the fore hatch between decks. The
parson is fit and ready, but in deference to the prevailing
epidemic the O.C. suggests postponement. A voluntary
service was held in the evening to a select few. It was interesting
during the day to watch the antics of our consorts. It was
with the greatest difficulty that they kept their stations : indeed
several quite failed to do so : they yawed, and plunged and
rolled in great style. The whole fleet looked like a school of
whales plunging and rolling in the heavy seas. The wind
went down during the day, and towards evening the swell
moderated. Official Log. Dist. run. 220 knots : strong southerly
breeze : heavy southerly swell: ship pitching heavily at times.
MONDAY 19th OCTOBER.
The interest taken by landsmen in the weather is more for
conversational than for practical purposes; but the man at sea,
especially in the early stages of the trip is full of a consuming
anxiety about it, and hails the sun and the gentle zephyr with
enthusiasm. Today the recluses of yesterday are coming out
into the open, and begining to realise that life may yet be
worth living. The talk although not quite so vigorous as usual
is quickly coming back to normal. The horses are being
groomed and led round the deck, (there being barely room for
this operation,) and, "all goes merry as a marriage bell". Nearly
every man is fit for duty again. Quite a large company gathered
on the fore hatch for prayers this morning. Pads and. pencils


are making their appearance in readiness for the mail at Hobart.
Do horses have a sense of humour ? A trio on No. 3 deck were
enjoying themselves immensely this afternoon, during the
parade. Every horse that passed got three good nips in different
parts of his anatomy and if he paused he got so many more. If
these horses didn't exactly wink the eye one could imagine
them doing it. It was a case of "running the gauntlet".
Official log. Distance run 258 knots: smooth sea: gentle
southerly breeze.
TUESDAY 20th OCTOBER.
The weather continues good and consequently the routine
business of the ship goes sweetly. We are all looking forward to
seeing Hobart tomorrow, but are somewhat disquieted to learn
that no leave will be granted to officers or men. A route march
however holds out some prospects of diversion, and some of the
sick men at the thought of seeing and being seen by the Hobart
girls are beginning to feel quite "sparky". Official log: Distance
run 261 knots.
WEDNESDAY 21st OCTOBER.
Today is Trafalgar Day and the anniversary of the
departure from New Zealand of the Ist contingent to South
Africa. We have several members of the contingent on board,
who would fain be with their comrades at the annual re-union.
We were in sight of land at daybreak this morning and reached
the Hobart wharf a little after noon. The scenery coming up
the estuary is soft and pleasing as compared with similar
country in New Zealand although the approaches to the estuary
are rugged enough. Cape Raoul, with its pillar-like strata
reminds one of Staffa in the western seas. We miss the variety
of the New Zealand bush. We must have been a unique, and,
to those in ignorance of our coming, a somewhat alarming sight
as we steamed into the harbour a long line of fourteen ships.
The public was conspicuous by its absence, the greater part
being present at the Annual Agricultural Show, which is being
held today and tomorrow. In the afternoon the troops from
some of the transports were taken for a route march round
the suburbs of the city, but the Orari men did not participate.
Although no leave was supposed to be granted one or two
mysterious disappearances took place during the evening :


several officers and men could not be found at their usual haunts
for some hours. Official log : Distance run 250 knots.
THURSDAY 22nd OCTOBER
We were on the march today at a quarter past eight,
passing through the city and suburbs. The weather was
muggy, and the pace decidedly warm to begin with, but
all enjoyed the outing and were simply amazed at the
kindness of the public all along the route. We are reserving
some racy incidents of the march for the next issue. Suffice
it to say that the expression of goodwill quite outdid
anything we had witnessed in our own land. An almost
continuous fire of apples, oranges, and bananas had a
somewhat disturbing effect upon the alignment of the
regiment, and the offers of cooling drinks were particularly
tantalising to the pipers and the members of the band,
when they happened to be playing. We left the wharf at
12.20 pm., the usual late passenger?laden with flowers ?
had to be slung aboard on a rope, and we left our
anchorage and started on our voyage across the Australian
Bight at 3.30 p.m. At 5.40 p.m. we dropped our first horse
overboard. Several snapshots were taken of the event.
FRIDAY 23rd OCTOBER.
This morning at daylight we were roused by the steamer's
whistle going at intervals of two or three minutes. We had
run into a thick fog. Happily it melted away, before the sun.
All day we have been struggling with the difficulties of publi-
cation, and at a late hour tonight had by no means surmounted
them. We have tried the typewriter and the mimeograph so
far without any success, but we are hopeful that in the end the
difficulties will yield to our endeavour and that copies of
the first issue of the Orari Tatler will be in the hands ot
subscribers in a few days. We had hoped to publish tomorrow
morning, and failing that we propose to read the contents to
the assembled troopers on Saturday evening. If it is thought
worth while, later on, we may have it printed at some port of
call.
It is a week today since we left New Zealand and the time
seems to have flown.

The Onlooker.
We have had, in Burns' phrase, "A chiel amangus taking notes",
and he asks for a little of our valuable space in which
to publish them. If he is wanted after publication he begs us
to say that he took flight by aeroplane just before we went to
press. ? We have had to edit his notes severely, but trust they
will now pass muster. He did not venture on any criticism of
the ship's company except to say that the skipper combined
in a remarkable degree the suavitur in modo with the fortiter
in re, and that his subordinates were a very decent lot, worthy
of their chief. With these preliminary remarks we transcribe
his notes.
THE O. C.
The O. C. like "Caesar's wife" is "above suspicion" (criticism)
but we venture to say that he is Wliite by name, and acclaimed
by officers and men as a white man through and through.
THE MAJOR.
We vote the major a real good sort", he can look remark-
ably mild, almost innocent on occasion ;he is withal a genial
man . but we shouldn t like to come under the cold displeasure
of his eye.
THE ADJUTANT.
If you want a description of the adjutant in a word we
should say "Versatility" is that word; if in a phrase "The one,
and Only".
THE PADRE.
The Padre will pass. A sketch has been shown me
entitled The Padre at prayers" in which he appears in
trousers and jersey sweeping a horse deck.


"TINY"
"Tiny" is a name of affection. His friends swear by him.
He has convictions about men and things, and is at no pains to
hide them. Like some men who are preternaturally solemn
he has a great fund of dry humour.
J. is one of the jolliest boys on board, and might be named
the "irrepressible" save when he is laid by the heels with that
universal subduer, Mai de Mer. Then for the time being his
exuberant spirits flag, and his sonorous voice is stilled into a
comparative whisper,
The "Doc.", the "V.S." "Sparks", the "Bachelor", and other
notables, in a future issue.


On
That some of the Orari men on the march at Hobart ought to
eat mushrooms?to make-um de "catch-up", as the Maori
said.
That, Seeing Hobart 'per boot" did not seem to appeal to the
protem "mounted Fut".
That, half way between N.Z. and Hobart the skipper startled
the "mess" by the following statement.?"Do you know,
gentlemen, that we are only two miles off land". "Impos-
sible", replied the mess. Etiquette forbade them to say
more. "S'truth", said the captain, "Land below the ship"!
That, the courtesy extended by the officers of the ship has been
much appreciated by all ranks. We think they were not
just made?they are gifts from heaven.
That, revolver shooting will have to improve considerably if
they want to shoot "Bill", 'cos he aint as big as an 'orse.
That, ow ing to the hospitality of the Hobart people the ranks on
march were bent, bruised, half-broken, but not "bust". Oh,
those girls !!!
That, a heavy swell was noticed amidst the guard on the
wharf. And he is only 24 today.
That, Mr. Taylor reckons this war has an unsettling effect as
far as transports go. Mr. Taylor is not alone in his opinion.
Ask Mr Cameron.
That, a member of the Arawa's outfit lay for many days on his
back gazing at the sky. On being questioned by his pals
lie replied with words in which "Europe" predominated.
The sky seems to be the only blankety-blank thing about
this ship which keeps still". Then more "Europe !!/'


Ip
That, you never hear a horse called a horse on the Orari.
Many other terms of endearment are used. Oh! how many !!
That, if the horses on No. 5 deck are ever required to get a
move on after leaving ship just show them a shovel.
Nuf sed.!
That, the officer on troop horse-deck No. I. was overheard
exhorting one of his men. ?"Back him in, head first".
That, two days out, a trooper lying sad and sorry on horse deck
No. 3. was overheard soliloquising. "The blank author of,
'A life on the ocean wave, a home on the rolling deep'
didn't know anything about it".

Dear Sir,
Who the dickens is playin' tricks wiv the bloomin' clock

blank don't yer go for the blank tucker, you blank son of a
sea-cook ? An' the orderly he ses, ses he, why it wants 20
minutes to five yet you blitherin' idiot! Well look a here
ses I, I'll back this 'ere "ticker" o' mine against all the ships'
clocks in creation, an she says five, she do! An' this is

The Call of the Blood.
ROUSE ye ! rouse ye ! men of British breed :
Rouse ye ! rouse ye ! desp'rate is the need.
Your kith and kin are standing at death grips with the foe :
Shall men of race imperial the battle gage forego ?
List ye ! list ye ! all the world of men :
List ye! list ye ! blood will tell again.
The fathers fought victorious, for honour truth and right;
The sons will fight unfaltering, the Teuton's boasted might.
Hail them ! hail them ! chosen of the lands :
Hail them ! hail them ! hail the gallant bands.
From East and West they're sailing; in North and South they tell
How men go forth to conquer, beside the gates of hell.
Waft ye ! waft ye ! every wand'ring breeze,
Waft ye ! waft ye ! round the seven seas,
How shoulder pressed to shoulder our kin of every clime
Fight, and die, and vanquish hate, as erst of olden time.
Mourn ye ! Mourn ye ! loyal hearts that bled:
Mourn ye ! Mourn ye ! Mourn our sacred dead:
Men who died, unconquered, that their brothers might be free
Men who paid the priceless gift of Life for liberty !.

No. 2. Vol. I. AT SEA. 31st Oct. 1914.
HE word to conjure with in these days is
) the word POWER ; not alone in the
I mechanical sense, but in every sphere
of life and activity : motive power in
the mechanical and commercial world, social
and political power in the world of men. The
symbols of it are many and various, and some
of the ways to it are devious and hard. Men sell
their souls for it, and find it in the end as dust
and ashes. From the beginning until now, men
for the lust of it have drenched the world in
blood and brought upon it unspeakable calamities.
One man in our own generation dreams of it, and
plans for it for a score of years, and plunges the
world into the most frightful catastrophe it has
ever witnessed in order to gratify his vaulting
ambition. To realise his dream of a world wide
empire, and, what he calls, the God-given destiny
of himself and his people, he ruthlessly destroys
the very flower of European Manhood; his own


and that of other peoples and lets loose upon
Western Civilization the fiendish forces of hate
and lust and destruction. To materialise his dream
of power, men are dehumanised until they act as
devils, so that women and little children in their
helpless misery, suffer unspeakable things at their
hands. Powci is admirable when it is used in an
altogether admirable way: and it seems to us that
the allied forces at this time of world crisis are
using it in an altogether admirable way, when they
use the power of men and things to curb the
madness that would wreck the world. A great
army is one of the most impressive symbols of
power, unless, indeed, it be a fleet of mighty
battleships, straining at their anchors or steaming
out to sea. But in the presence of the great engines
of destruction manufactured by modern science,
an army may wither like the grass before the blast
of a furnace, and the mightiest battleship that
ever rode the seas, in a few moments may become
a floating debris of scrap iron. By how much
more then is the call for men?men of courage
and resource?men who are willing to risk all and
pay the full price if need be. And how that call
is being answered they know, who are gathering
from East, and West, and North and South from
all the seven seas, to stand shoulder to shoulder
with their kith and kin in fort and field until
the day is won. In that connection the deathless
story of the retreat from Mons and the fight at
Ypres stirs and thrills us. The blood of our kith
and kin runs red in our veins and leaps at the
story of how they fought, and how they fell, ever
with their faces to the foe. At Mons the enemy
thought to sweep them off the face of the earth,
hurled picked battalions against their thinning


lines, surrounded them with a ring of steel, sent
word to the Kaiser that they held them in the
hollow of their hands, and then wondered why
they did not surrender when according to all the
German-made rules of war they were beaten. But
the Britishers were true to the traditions of the
race, and not knowing that they were beaten,
they extricated themselves from the ring of steel,
at tremendous cost to the enemy, and after five
unspeakable days they rested from their deathless
deeds, a living remnant of flesh and blood power.


Locals.
It should be put on record that on reaching Hobart the
G.O.C. complimented the Orari on the way in which she
"Kept Station" during the run from Wellington. We offer our
congratulations to Captain Weston.

Here, in Albany, we have been joined by the battle cruiser
Melbourne of the Australian fleet, the fastest and most up-to-
date ciuiser of our escort. The I'Buki has gone to Freemantle
to coal, and will probably return before we resume our voyage.

Col. Meldrum, with some of the officers of the W.M.R
rowed over from the Arawa on Thursday morning, and spent
some time on board. Later in the day Col. Malone came over
to have a look at his chargers, and warmly complimented the
officers and men on the appearance of all their horses.

Lieut. Logan, as an old Duntroon student was invited to
dine with the Australian G.O.C. and other fellow students on
Wednesday evening.
* *
One pleasing feature of our life on the Orari is the happy
relations subsisting between the various authorities on board.
We have a civil authority in the person of the Captain, a
military authoiity in the person of the 0.C., and an intermediary
between these on the one hand, and the Admiralty and the
G.O.C. on the other, in the person of the N.T.O. It is quite
conceivable in such a case that there might be friction at
times, and that the atmosphere should on occasion be charged


with electricity. It says much for the geniality and good
sense of all concerned that there is a perfect understanding
between the heads of departments, which obviates all trouble.
We cannot withhold our meed of admiration for the dash
and daring of the Emden, the German cruiser in the Indian
Ocean. According to the latest news she has accounted for
seventeen vessels The Commander has "played the game"
and has paid us the compliment of acting up to the best
traditions of the British Navy ; and when he is captured, as
we do not doubt he will be in the end, he will deservedly merit
and receive all the honours of war. We understand that our
Japanese escort is keen to try conclusions with him. If he
fights with the same dash with which he raids, he will give a
good account of himself. We should like nothing better than
to see him fall into the hands of our escort. There are grave
possibilities bound up in such a contingency, but we should
cheerfully face them.
An informal visit was paid on Friday to the Hororata
the latest addition to the N.Z.S.Co's. line, and one of the
Australian transports, by Captain Weston, the O. C. Major
Whyte, Major Chambers and Surgeon Captain McLean. A
boats crew of members of the force, under Lieut. Joll, rowed the
party across the bay. The conditions were fairly easy going,
but the return journey was more difficult on account of a head
wind, and the crew including the Lieut, had had enough by the
time they had reached the Orari. The boys on the Hororata
gave the Orari boys a good reception, and questioned them
about friends of theirs living in New Zealand, ranging from
North Cape to Stewart Island.

We expect our sporting editor to supply us with an acdount
of the Boxing Competitions when they are completed. We
witnessed some very good bouts on No. 4 hatch on Friday night.
A man reveals his temperament in boxing just as later on he
will show it in fighting. One man falls upon his opponent in a
flash and rains blows upon him like a fury. His opponent,


cool and steady, wards them off as best he can, and, waiting
his'opportunity, he plants a staggering blow that has all his
strength behind it. One man starts slowly almost stolidly
until he is stung into action by a smartly landed blow from the
man in front of him. One man is so much on spring wires
that he ties himself in a knot, and sprawls in the ring; but he
is up again in a flash, darting at his opponent like a wasp
on the wing. Boxing is a fine thing to teach a man self control.
The angrier he gets the more he puts himself at the mercy of a
good boxer ; the warier and cooler he is, the better chance he
has to give a good account of himself.

TROOPSHIP No. 6.
Engine Room.
Situated amidship is the source of propulsion, which
consists of two sets of triple expansion, condensing Engines,
built by Denny & Co. of Dumbarton.
The diameters of the Cylinders are, H. P. 25� I P. 42 "4 P.
710" " the stroke being 48"
Steam is admitted through a balanced piston valve,
to the H. P. cylinder, at 200 lbs. pressure to the square
inch, and is expanded down to 60 lbs. pressure before
entering the intermediate cylinder, from which it exhausts
into the low pressure valve casing and cylinder at 10
lbs. pressure ?25 lbs. absolute. It enters the main condensers,
of which there are two, at two pounds absolute pressure,
where it is condensed by impinging on 1500 tubes made
from Muntz metal, through which the sea water is circulated
by two powerful centrifugal pumps.
The condensed steam and vapour are drawn from the
condensers by Edward's patent air pumps, producing a
vacuum up to 28 inches, that is, destroying 14 lbs. of the
atmospheric pressure. From the air pumps the water is
drawn into the main feed pumps, which force it back into
the boilers ; passing on its way through filters, which extract
any grease or solid matter held in the water, and through
a live-steam heater, where its temperature is raised to
220� Fahr.
Under certain conditions the raising in temperature of
the boiler feed water, greatly reduces the coal consumption,
besides reducing the deteriorating of the boilers to a minimum.
The main shafts are of Mild Steel 14" (inches) in diameter,
and the propellers are 16 feet in diameter, having 4 blades
set at a pitch of feet 18' 9".
At 75 revolutions per minute, the engines are capable
of propelling the vessel, deep laden, at 13 knots.
Steam is generated in five multitubular marine boilers,
working under Howden's forced draught system, which


doubles the consumption of coal per square foot of five-grate
area. Each botler has 3 furnaces of the Morison suspension
bulb type corrugation.
to 1 12 knotS the consum P tion of coal per day amounts
to 85 tons.
For the present voyage 3570 tons of N. Z. coal have
been placed in the bunkers.
In the Mam Engine Room there is also an auxiliary
condenser with separate circulating and air pumps far use
m port; a ballast pump capable of discharging 2000 gallons
over oar ; a sanitary pump; a fresh water pump; a duplex
circulating pump, and two evaporators each capable of
making 30 tons of fresh water per day, from sea water.
The electrical installation consists of a 60 kilowatt set
comprising two machines, generating current at 100 volts'
supplying the various circuits with current for several'
undred lamps, an 8 H. P. motor driving a force draught
for ventilating purposes at 850 revolutions per minute,
35 2/2 amp ire fans, several electric radiators and the
wireless apparatus.
The refrigerating machinery consists of two Haslam
ammonia compression machines.
The ammonia, after compression in the cylinders is
expanded through regulating valves, into coils round which
brine is circulated, or into batteries through which air is
driven by large fans. The action in either case is the
same, the ammonia leaving the compressors as a liquid
an expanding into a gas, it draws the necessary Latent
Heat of evaporation from the surrounding brine or atmosphere.

Day by Day.
SATURDAY 24th OCTOBER.
Those who were on the poop this morning before breakfast
had an exciting experience. Looking astern we wondered to see
the Ruapehu, or the Roop as she is called here, suddenly sheer
off to port and then after a space of 5 minutes or thereabouts
come back again, and hang broadside on to the following ship,
the Waitnana, which was quickly lessening the distance between
them. For a few minutes we felt that we were looking on a
possible tragedy, that the Roop was in imminent danger of
being cut in two, and that would have been quite as disastrous
in its effects as a German torpedo. Something had gone
wrong with her steering gear, and she lay quite helpless and
broadside on to the Waimana. From where we looked it seemed
as though the bows of the Waimana just managed to scrape
past and we all drew a big breath of relief. It requires very
little imagination to picture the horrors of such a collision if
it had taken place. The whole fleet had to slow down while the
Ruapehu's steering gear was repaired.
Rifle practise, at a target trailed behind the ship, was
indulged in for the first time this afternoon, and we had some
good shooting.
The sky is full of fleecy, copper coloured clouds which
indicate very hot weather inland; so says one who speaks with
authority. It is therefore better to be here than there.
Official log: Distance run 262.
SUNDAY 25th OCTOBER.
We passed a quiet, uneventful day ?a good muster gathered
on the "fore peak" for church parade this morning. In the
evening the Chaplain conducted a short song service on the


fore hatch. A ripple ot amusement went round the faces of the
congregation this morning, when the preacher, referring to one
e ear y isciples, said, "he could swear like a trooper".

MONDAY 26th OCTOBER,
ablm R ll Pe '"'}* again P rovi ding us with something to think
bout. The sad news was passed around the fleet this morning
of our first casualty. Lance Corporal Gilchrist of the Ruapehu
?ed suddenly last night. The funeral was held this afternoon
and must have been for his comrades, an impressive sight A
funeral at sea is at any time, an arresting experience, but when
It is participated in, as in this case by a whole fleet, it is invested
with an unique solemnity. While Gilchrist was in life he was
a mere insignificant member of the expedition, like any of the
rest of us, but, dead, he was invested with such majesty, that
or the space of fifteen minutes the pulsing engines of the fleet
ceased their throbbing, while the men on each ship stood at
attention, the bands played the "Dead March", and the short
service appointed for a burial at sea was read. The Ruapehu
took station as near as possible in the centre of the fleet, for the
service, and, that completed, returned to her appointed place It

Nothing of note has happened today. There have been
many inquiries as to when the the Taller goes to press
We hope to satisfy inquirers tomorrow morning. A fresh follow'

force would not be feeling too happy.

WEDNESDAY 28th OCTOBER.
We passed between Breaksea Island and Cape Bald about
ten o'clock this morning and dropped our anchors on the
seaward side of the great fleet of transports lying in the outer
harbour. The dullest imagination must have been stirred by
the sight which met the eye.
Excluding our escort we are 38 transports, all told,
filled with horses and men ; counting the crews of the ships
there cannot be less than 34,000 men lying in the bay. We
form a long line, three deep, extending from the inner harbour to
the entrance of the bay. Later in the day we were ordered to
take station in the inner harbour to load 200 tons of coal. The
Mounganui and the Athenic were already lying alongside the
wharf, but there was no room for us to go alongside and we
dropped anchor in the stream. The Australian ships are not
painted an elusive grey, as ours are, but wear the colours of the
steamship lines to which they belong. This lends variety to
the scene ; but we cannot help thinking that the fleet would
look much more formidable, if all were painted a uniform grey.
A general order, was issued yesterday, forbidding any one on
the transports taking a photo, without special permission.
The first number of the Orari Tatler, dated Saturday 24th
October, was published today, and quickly passed into cir-
culation ; and, had it been possible to produce them, many
more editions could have been disposed of. The Editor received
many expressions of approval, one of the best being by a
member of the crew. "Not so bad for a bloomin' parson". He
is kept humble by the thought that it takes very little to please
men on board a transport.
As we passed the Australian transports today, on our way
to the inner harbour, many a hearty cheer was given and
received. The crews of the battleships looked particularly
smart as they stood "at attention".
THURSDAY 29th OCTOBER.
Today we came out of the inner harbour to our old anchorage
near the heads. The deck boats were lowered and races were
indulged in by crews representing the different troop decks


Some one suggested that they had gone fishing, judging by the
number of crabs" that were caught. That was unkind because
the majority of the men were expert rowers, some of them medal-
lists. One of the ship's officers said of one crew "that it managed
the boat as well, if not better than the sailors". The greatest
fun, however, was in lowering the boats and shipping the
crews. One member of the editorial staff who was inclined
to be bilious, had the heartiest laugh he has enjoyed for a
long time, and found it better than a dose of medicine. The
men were like dogs off the chain, and entered into the sport
like schoolboys.
Military terms were mostly in evidence?Shouts of "Left",
"Left" "Get into your stride Mate", "Dress by your Right"
abounding. We hope to have the report of the races from
our sporting editor.
We have been struck by the appearance of the country
today. It looks barren, but pretty. There appears to be a
good deal ot limestone, which should augur well for the soil,
other things being equal.
The beaches as seen from the ship, are a dazzling white,
and slips on the far hillside look like snow. From where the
Orari lies at anchor we see all the transports, and at night
the lights have the appearance, against the dark background
of the hills, of a low lying city with its twinkling lights.
FRIDAY 30th OCTOBER.
The chief event this morning was a visit from the G.O.C.
Some of the horses are getting irritable owing to the heat
and too much feeding and too little exercise, with the result
that the men are beginning to have trouble in cleaning out
the stalls. This morning one of the troopers had a narrow
escape of being killed, escaping with a number of severe
bruises. Along the front of the horse stalls a beam 6x 6 is
fixed. Already in some cases horses have worn it more than
half way through, pawing at it when feed time comes round.

The Onlooker.
The Onlooker has been fairly busy as will be seen by what
follows: ?
The storm last week revealed the quality of the Bachelor .
He's a "grafter" and not afraid to tackle the whole job himself,
when the men are hors de combat; and he knows how to do it
too. He is such a handy man that he would make a "Benedict"
just after the modern woman's heart. We feel sure that he
would dress the baby, and bring the wife her morning cup
of tea.
"JOCK" has little to say for himself, but he gives you the
impression that he is always taking something in. His men
make up for his silence : they fondly believe that Jock" will
be another "Kitchener", and they will follow him through the
deepest German trench to victory.
"THE DOC." Behind that non-committal look and that
carefully groomed moustache, there is more than at a first
glance appears.
The "Doc" like some of his countrymen, keeps you at arms
length until he has had time to "dissect" you a little. He
"lays hands suddenly on no man" and, according to circum-
stances, that look of his expands into a genial smile or
contracts into a forbidding frown. His understudy, who only
joined us the day we left Wellington, was taken to our arms
at once. His name is Mac C(or)mick ; and so he may be either
Scotch or Irish.
The "V.S." must know every horse in the ship by this time,
and that is saying a good deal, seeing there are over yoo horses
on board. The Major is a man who seems to see nothing, but
who in reality sees everything, and what he does not know
about a horse is not worth knowing.


SPARKS has been adopted by every member of the
Junior mess, the president included, "for he's a jolly good
fellow".
We forgive him freely when he gives us no wireless news,
but some of us think, all the same, that with a little more
enterprise it wouldn't be difficult to give us some every
morning. No, Sparks" would never make a good War
Correspondent.
. There are tw o LOGANS; both are grafters in their particular
line and will be heard of some day.
"Maunsell" is one of those likeable fellows you cannot
withstand. He has an English name, is probably Irish, judging
by the "bulls" he has already perpetrated, and "ought to be
Scotch" says a member of the force. "Dont you see, man, that
his name is made up of two Scottish words".
Bruiser" so far has not had much opportunity to justify hi s
name. For some days at the beginning of the voyage like the
man we read of in our last issue, he lay gazing, if not at the
sky, at the roof of his cabin, and for once in his life he was
considerably bruised" both in his spirits and in his body.

His worship, on looking down the Crime List, stated
how pleased he was to note the small number of "delinquents ",
and also the comparative mildness of the crimes ; but what
pleased him most of all was the total absence of female
defaulters on this boat. He sincerely trusted this happy
state of affairs would last, but expressed the fear that this
epidemic of stowaways might spread while we were in
port, to some of the blondes and brunettes who looked
with longing eyes on the officers, and incidentally, the men
of the good ship Orari.
On the word to " Carry on " Chief Detective Anderson
in stentorian tones called the name of "John Mc Pherson
Grant This man, whose looks were rather against him,
was called upon to answer the charge of being a Scotsman,
and also on the second count of being a native of Inverness.
The accused through the aid of an interpreter pleaded
guilty to being a Scotsman, but on it being explained
to his worship that Inverness is a " long, long way from
Tipperary" the accused was let off on the second charge.
His honor with great leniency inflicted a fine of 15/ ? on
the first charge, which accused immediately paid into court,
in the recognised ship's currency, to wit, two canteen
coupons and a promise.
The next case, was one brought by Police Constable
Allardice against at least five of the troopers, and also the
Chief Engineer. It was a gross case of " exposure of the
person. " The accused, who certainly did look a barefaced
lot when lined up, explained to his honor, that the}' had
only shaved their heads and exposed them to the elements
in the vain hope that they might be better covered with
hair in the near future. His honor, who was at first


inclined to treat this case with the utmost rigour of the
law, realised that it would indeed be hard to punish such
" highly polished" gentlemen, and only imposed the slight
restriction of 8 hours " Hair Drill " per day.
During this " Exposure Case" the Doctor was noticed
to be in a state of the utmost embarrassment, sitting with
averted face, and blushing violently.
At this stage of the proceedings, " Come to the Cook-
house Door" was heard loudly blown outside, and in the
resultant rush, there were several casualties, which were
attended to by the " Red Hot Cross Bun Brigade ".

IjJI Wireless. \ui
Wireless.
It is some ten years now since wireless first came before
the public. Since then great strides have been made, both in
reliability and distances obtainable. A few years back, a
distance of 200 miles was considered remarkable, but now,
anything under 1500 miles is quite ordinary.
A ship's plant consists of two complete wireless sets, one
of which is worked from storage batteries. This is called the
emergency set, and has proved most efficient in many cases
when vessels have been in distress. Should a ship be wrecked
the power set would quickly be rendered useless, for the water
would stop the ship's dynamos, thereby cutting off the supply of
current to the wireless house With the emergency set, however,
it is possible to work as long as the ship is afloat, providing
that the operator does not "bolt". When a message is sent out
a great electric strain takes place, which causes electrical
vibrations. These vibrations produce ether waves, which
are propagated with the speed of light, about 186,000 miles per
second, and can be detected great distances from their
source, by means of instruments specially designed for the
purpose. It has been said that the great disadvantage of
wireless, is that there is no secrecy, owing to the fact that a
ship can pick up any message. Of course in time of war this
is a disadvantage, but extensive codes and cyphers are used,
and are not likely to be deciphered except by those for whom
the messages are intended.
Wireless was not invented for secrecy, but for an additional
means of life-saving at sea, and it is obvious that a distress
message would stand a better chance of being picked up if
all ships could hear it, than if only certain ships could.
The latest addition to wireless is the "Radio-goniometer"
or "wireless compass" which shows accurately the direction


from which signals come. This "Marconi", apparatus is
independent of the regular wireless outfit on board ship, and
it requires no power for operation. All that is necessary is
a separate installation of aerial wires, presenting two
triangles that bisect each other at right angles. The
range of the compass is from 40 to 5� miles, and can
be manipulated simply either by "Sparks" or the "Navigating
officer". The wireless compass should ultimately be relied
on quite as much as the foghorn, although the sounding
apparatus can never be dispensed with, until all vessels have a
complete wireless equipment.
Wireless Telegraphy has already been of great service in
locating vessels in a fog.
Messages exchanged between ships and shore stations, have
served to keep commanders informed of vessels near them, and
experienced operators can gauge the proximity of another
vessel, by the increasing strength of received signals as the
distance diminishes. Some coast stations send out wireless time
signals, and ship's chronometers can be accurately adjusted
daily. Comparatively few errors in the reception of messages
are n ade, but one crops up now and again. One operator
received a weather report from Wellington not long ago,
which informed the astonished skipper that the
barometer was rising "tenderly". This of course should
have read Barometer, rising tendency", but as the operator
in question was a comparatively new hand, he may be for-
given for this little faux pas.
A course of instruction in wireless telegraphy includes
sending, receiving, magnetism, electricity and heroism. The
last subject includes all that is necessary for the operator
to know concerning wrecks, attitude to lady passengers who
interrupt during the transmission of "5.0.5." messages, how
to take a flying leap from the masthead as the ship's funnel
disappear beneath the waves, and other essentials.


ULiElli
On Dit.
That, an Orari trooper on learning that no leave was to be
granted at Hobart, expressed his disgust by saying,
"They're treating us like babies; They'll be putting on
our nighties and putting us to bed next."
That, the following colloquoy took place between a tourist and
an Irishman,? "What are those red berries growing yonder
on the hill side ?" "Oh, they're black berries", "How can
they be black berries, when they are red ?." "Oh they're
always red, when they 're green."
That, the stewards of this boat are the most attentive and
obliging lot it has ever been our fortune to meet.
That, the "Kiwi" grudges the " Kangaroo " his daily allowance
of grog.
That, Colombo is so openly and freely talked of as our next
port of call, that one suspects, it is being done to cover up
our real route, and put the enemy off the scent.

Poet's Corner.
Poet's Corner.
The Troopship.
You ask what it's like on a troopship, sir,
That's a thing that I finds 'ard to tell
For it ain't exactly like home, sir,
And it ain't altogether like 'Ell.
Yer see, our ship 'ad the 'orses
She bein' a steady old 'en
And on her we 'ad nigh eight 'undred
With a 'andfull of two 'undred men.
We started away on a Friday
And of course 'ad the usual "good byes"
It ain't a good sight to look on, sir,
And see women with tears in their eyes.
But we were off, and soon felt much better
For our breakfast and breeze from the sea
And was skippin' on deck like sailors
Thinkin' Neptune and us would agree.
From our top deck to bottom was 'orses
Standin' in row upon row :
To one who was jumped in upon us
We looked like a bloomin' big show.
Three times a day, sir, we fed 'em
And three times we cleaned out their stalls;
And we thought that "Reveille" and "Stables"
Was two of the rottenest calls.
Now it wern't over cool down below, sir,
And the sea 'ad developed a swell.
The result you can guess was unpleasant
And most of us blokes was unwell.


The smell of the 'orses was sickenin'.
Poor beggars, they didn't do grand,
They stumbled and staggered about, sir,
In their wild endeavours to stand.
Now a soldier can always go "tucker"-
And pricks up his ears at the call,
But sometimes around our mess table
There wasn't a soldier at all.
How did we manage with "Stables"
When the sea was playing us tricks ?
Well them as was well and our "bosses"
Rubbed shoulders, and hoed in like bricks.
But seasickness don't last forever
And its got its comic side too,
We soon had full musters for breakfast
And cleaned up our porridge and stew.
Now I ain't goin' to grumble at quarters
Tho' it wern't quite a floatin' 'otel,
And the time that we passed in the tropics
Was the part that was mostly like 'Ell.
When a man goes to fight for his country
'E don't look for chicken and 'am,
Tho' we grumbled and growled a lot, sir,
We all got our butter and jam.
Yes, most of our day it was "Stables"
Of our 'orses we all thought a lot:
Gawd only knows what they suffered
And the names what we called 'em was 'ot.
But sometimes we shouldered our rifles
And blazed off at targets afloat,
And the S.M. he gave us instruction
To keep us from actin' the goat.
Would 1 go through it again, sir ?
Well rather, I reckon I would,
Though fightin' is mostly what's bad, sir,
It brings out a lot what is good.

No. 3. Vol. I. AT SEA. 7th Nov. 1914.
HOSE who from choice, like a recent well
1 known writer, or from necessity, like
the shepherd on the hills, the settler in the
backblocks, the sentry, and the sailor man,
have to witness the breaking of the day, are not
without their compensations, especially if, like
Crockett, they are lovers of nature or have some
sense of the beautiful. Many, alas, have no such
sense. They are like Wordsworth's Tokel:-
A primrose by the river's brim,
A yellow primrose was to him,
And it was nothing more.
A sunrise to them is nothing more than the opening
of a new day; its mystery and witchery is not
for them; a sunset nothing but a splotch of colour
in the sky; the mystic beauty is hidden from their
eyes.
We have had some really fine sunsets this
week. The great artist of the sky is for ever
painting his inimitable pictures. How many have


been feasting their eyes upon the transformations
of form and colour? We had a remarkable picture
in the western sky on Thursday evening. When
you had looked at it steadily for a minute you
saw a broad river of red molten gold. On the far
side, inlets running between great bluffs, and on
the near side sedges and trees. In the upper reaches,
a land-locked basin with a great ship riding at
anchor, and in the lower reaches stretching into
the far distance thousands of islets of every
conceivable shape and size. We have seen the
glories of the sunrise, and the splendours of "Sunset
and Evening Star" in both the old world and the new,
but never have we seen anything to equal what once
we saw from the slopes of Mount Egmont, above the
clouds. We had left the camp in the darkness
of a never-to-be-forgotten autumn morning, and
stood on a narrow razor-back ridge of the
mountain, at a height of 5000 feet. Behind us was
the camp, and the stunted scrub from which we
had emerged; beneath us, a deep and wooded
gorge, from which ascended the lowing of wild
cattle; on our right and above us, the summit
of the mountain, piercing the sky for another 3000
feet, majestic and still, clad in its mantle of white;
in front and to the left stretching to the far
horizon, a billowy sea of snow-white cloud; and
in the far distance, at the gates of opening day,
the peak of Ruapehu, Tongariro, and Ngaruahoe,
rising like islands out of the cloudy sea, a fairy
spray seeming to break upon their sides. We
stood in silent wonder watching the fleeing shadows
and the growing light.
Speech at such a time would have been an
impertinence. Words would have been futile to


voice the feeling in our hearts, or to describe the
magnificence before our eyes. The light grew
clearer and the outline of the mountain seemed
to cut the sky; quick fiery sparkles shot along the
cloudy horizon; the majestic cone above us changed
from snowy white to rosy pink; then, in a breath-
less moment, the lord of day flooded our upper
world with radiant light.


Locals.
Locals.
Surgeon Captain McLean has begun a series of lectures,
on First Aid for the benefit of officers and men.
*
* *
Most of the officers and men have been inoculated this week
for fever.
*
* *
With this issue we present our readers, not only with the
usual page of illustrations, but with a chart showing the
disposition of our convoy and escort, with the name of each
ship, its tonnage and speed.
*
* *
A somewhat daring local in the last issue of the Tatler, was
censored out of existence. We cannot even make the remotest
allusion to it, but sympathise with our readers in their loss.
*
* *
We have come to the conclusion, that we have in the
Expeditionary Force as a whole, a fine lot of men, and a
particularly willing lot on board this ship. There are few, if
any shirkers; quarrels are almost unknown and are soon
settled ; and there is a capital understanding between officers
and men. "The Duke's son, and the Cook's son" "Meet on the
same Level" and let us hope that in the end of the day they
"will part on the square".
* *
All the same there are men and men. Temperament is
revealed not only in "boxing" but also in "brushing". It is a
treat to see with what thoroughness some of the men sweep the
decks and groom the horses, although they know it will have
to be done all over again in a few hours. A horse ship is a
continual heartbreak to a man who is methodical and tidy.


yet some of the horses and horsestalls with their surroundings
are as near perfection as the conditions will admit. On the
other hand some men scuffle round the deck and use the dandy
brush as though they were quite new both to broom and
brush. They seem to be saying within themselves "This is
good enough" or this will pass muster". We understand that
two men look after ten horses. How would it do to offer a
weekly prize, (not necessarily a money prize) for the best kept
horses and stalls ? Who will come to the rescue ?
*&
* *
We hope that the troopers will respond to the invitation
which the Editor addresses to them for copy. We want the
paper to be representative of all ranks, and to reflect every shade
of opinion. Moreover it will be much more valuable as a souvenir
of the voyage if every side of the ship's social life is reflected
in it. Knowing, as we do that every class of civilian life is
represented in the ranks, it is certain that there are dozens of
men who have in the past contributed to School and College
Magazines.

Day by Day.
SATURDAY 31st OCTOBER.
Nothing of note has transpired today. The men have had
the boats out, and have greatly enjoyed visiting the transports,
and hailing some of their comrades quartered on these.
When the boat ranges alongside a veritable fusilade of
questions is hurled from both sides, and a lot of good natured
banter takes place. The men on board the Tahiti regarded an
Orari boat load with envious eyes, as they for some reason had
not been permitted the use of the ship's boats. Word has gone
round that we leave tomorrow at daybreak, and general
satisfaction is expressed both fore and aft.
SUNDAY Ist NOVEMBER.
At seven o'clock this morning the Orvietta, the Flagship of the
Australian Expeditionary Force, the first of an imposing line of
26 transports, steamed slowly past us ; then the Maunganui
leading the first line, and the Arawa the second, we followed ;
and all had cleared the heads by 9 o'clock. The formation is
now as follows : ?we have a battle cruiser ahead, and one each
on either flank. The Australians are in three lines of seven,
nine and ten ; we follow in two lines of five as before. The
Japanese cruiser, an 1 the two Westralian boats will join us
presently, when in all probability the Westralians will fall in
behind the Australian line of seven, and the cruiser will take up
station in the rear. We have had a most auspicious start for
this the third stage of our journey. Albany Bay looked its
loveliest, and the sun was tempered by a gentle breeze.
We must have been a magnificent sight to any onlooker who
witnessed our departure, but of these there seemed to be few.
We were not long out when we were informed that our next
port of call was to be?not Colombo?but Capetown !

MONDAY 2nd NOVEMBER.
The most ominous tidings, that we have yet received, came
from Headquarters this morning, viz:? that Britain had
declared war against Turkey. This will probably mean the
end of Turkey in Europe, by the time Russia and the Balkan
States have done with her, but it may also mean grave
complications in our Indian Empire and in Egypt. We may be
assured that our Imperial Statesmen have not gone to war
without long and anxious consideration of all the possibilities
involved. In all likelihood their hands have been forced by
Turkey's open and insolent disregard of the Laws of Neutrality.
After Prayers this morning the Adjutant read the General
Orders xegarding the censorship of correspondence, and
intimated, on the authority of the N.T.O. that the course had
been altered and that we were now heading straight for
Lolombo. A welcome break in the somewhat monotonous round
of duty, took place tonight, in the shape of a capital concert
organised by the N.C.Os, and the men, which was given on the
forehatch. It revealed the fact that we have musical talent
aboard of no mean order. Elsewhere our reporter furnishes an
account of the proceedings.
Official log. Dist. run 220 knots, fresh breeze N.W.N.
Temperature (at noon) air 66. Sea 67,

We were joined this afternoon by the transports from
Freemantle, accompanied by the I'Buki and the Pyramus.
Official log : Dist. run 220 knots, strong breeze, wind West.
Temperature (at noon) Air 66 Sea 67.
WEDNESDAY 4th NOVEMBER.
Early this morning most of the ship's company were startled
out of their slumbers by a succession of tremendous rolls. For
the space of some minutes we seemed to be wallowing in the
trough of the sea, and almost standing on our beam ends.
The horses got a big surprise, but soon settled down to the
swaying motion, Some sensational stories are told of narrow


escapes from serious accidents. The officer on the bridge obser-
ved an extra big swell approaching the ship. Some account for it,
on the ground of a submarine disturbance?not of the German
variety.
Some speculation was caused today when the Maunganui left
her station, and almost disappeared over the horizon ; the cause,
we shall probably know tomorrow.
Official log: Dist. run 220 knots; gentle breeze, wind W.S.W
Temperature (at noon) Air 70 Sea 70.
THURSDAY sth NOVEMBER.
We struck a South East Trade wind this morning. It will
probably last for six or seven days, when we may expect the
North East Monsoon, which is a warm dry wind. The sun is
hot, and men off duty are seeking every available shelter.
Awnings are being erected to protect the heads of the horses!
and openings are being made in the horse boxes to permit free
passage of air.
The ship's bedding is getting a sun bath; we are decorated
from stem to stern and half way up the ratlines with the various
details. From now on many of the men will sleep on the hatches,
the tops of the horse stalls, or any other convenient corner.
We learn this morning that our next port of call is really
Colombo. Now that we are at war with Turkey, the Expeditio-
nary Force may be required in Egypt in certain contingencies.
There is little doubt that the first intention was to take us to
Europe via Capetown, We also learn that the Maunganui went
off her course yesterday for a serious operation, which was
successfully performed. The Minotaur came up from the rear
and through our lines this morning, belching thick smoke from
all her funnels. She had evidently been through the Convoy
during the night on a tour of inspection. Later in the day the
following message came through "The Minotaur to N.Z. Convoy,
Station keeping and general order, especially as regards lights'
is most satisfactory".
Some excitement was caused in the afternoon by a smudge of
smoke, which was discovered on the far horizon immediately
behind the Convoy, and which indicated that a vessel of some


sort was overhauling us. Very soon the cruiser in our rear was
seen to leave her station travelling in the direction of the
stranger. After some time she returned, and later the smudge
grew until it materialised into the H.M.S. Osterly. She passed
by quite close to our starboard line. Speculation is rife as to
whether she will remain with us or be permitted to go on.
Official log. Dist. run 237 knots. Gentle breeze, wind South.
Temp, (at Noon) Air 76 Sea 71.
FRIDAY 6th NOVEMBER.
The wind today is round in the S. E. and we are conse-
quently getting more benefit from it. There is no sign of
the Osterly this morning. Someone suggests that the
Admiralty may be using her as a decoy for the Emden
that if she sights the Ernde?i she will scurry back and the
cruisers will hurry forward. The Maunganui and the Hawkes
Bay have left their stations and retired to the rear of the
convoy, for what purpose we can only vainly surmise.

?EE*
On Dit.
That, the Naval Transport Officer likes to have his little
joke concerning the route of the Expeditionary Force.
That, the Orari Troopers are to all appearance a cross
between a lunatic asylum and a penitentiary ! The
craze for shaven heads which is spreading to the
officers quarters, and is usually a conspicuous sign
of a mental patient, combined with the denim overalls,
many of which are branded with the broad arrow,
and a number, go far to justify the conclusion.
1 hat, ceitain men on this ship have very little sense of
humour, and that men who deal in that commodity
had better beware ! Nuf Sed.
That, a certain sergeant takes a malicious delight in clipping
close the locks of his bosom friends.
That, " Too many cooks spoil the broth" as witness the
heaving overboard of poor Kaitoke.
That, one of the crew in the 3rd officer's boat on Saturday
last, contemplating the possibility of a visit to art
Australian Transport said in deeply disappointed tones
as the Chaplain went down the ladder, "Oh Lord,
this looks like beer; I don't think"!
That, two horse picquets one night this week were discovered,
laboriously putting a horse's forelegs under him with
the idea of getting him up.
That, an animated discussion took place the other day
between two troopers as to the cost of living in N.Z.
and Australia, one maintaining against the other that
it was higher in Australia than in N. Z. A third trooper
ended all controversy by stating authoritatively that
it was the same in both countries, viz : sixpence a glass.
That, under medical advice the N. T. O. began to grow a
beard, but was so appalled at the appearance of the
first crop, that he desisted and changed his doctor.

Concert.
A very enjoyable concert, which is, we hope, the precursor of
many more, took place on the forehatch on Monday evening,
Major Whyte O.C. in the chair. Where every item was
vigorously encored it would be invidious to single out indivi-
dual performers. The following is the programme, I. Overture,
Sergt. Richardson (banjo) Trooper Scales, (banjo) and Trooper
Turner (piano). 2. Song, Sergt. Cooksey, "Trooper Johnny
Ludlow." 3. Song, Trooper J. H. McCrae "A Perfect Day." and
"Absence" 4. Highland Fling, Trooper McWilkie (Piper
McKenzie). 5. Song, Trooper Davie, "Invictus" and "Mary." 6.
Song, Corporal Judd, Comic Selections. 7. Reading from Orari
Tatler Chap-Major Grant. 8. Boxing Bout, Troopers Eggleton
and Christie. 9. Pianoforte Selections, Trooper Turner "Spring
Song" (Mendelsohn) and "Hearts and Flowers." 10. Song,
Trooper Davie "Good Company" and "My Ain Folk." 12.
Recitation, Trumpeter James "Lost." 15. Song Trooper McCrae
"Drinking." 14. Song Corporal Judd, Comic Selections a' la
Harry Lauder. 15 Song, Trooper Prosser "Lads in Blue" and
'Chums".
The meeting closed with "God Save The King." Sergt.
Richardson and Trooper Turner accompanied the songs very
sympathetically.
Major Whyte thanked the N.C.Os and men for a delightful
evening and hoped that they would have many such during the
voyage.

I dreamt that we were torpedoed, and the ship was sinking fast,

For our dying could not alter Standing Orders for the day.

The captain next gave orders, and his voice was rich and clear
He knew his end was coming, but held no thought of fear
He gave his order sharply, with perhaps a touch of scorn '

The Major next approached us, with a slow and stately stride
He scanned ttie row of faces, and his heart was filled with pride
hen gave his final order like a born aristocrat,

Just then the ship dived under, and each man met his fate

Answers to correspondents. Anxious; "Buster" is a nom de
plume of course, but his identity is known to us.
Curiosity; We cannot divulge the information you ask
for.
Non Combatant; Your lines have no little merit, but both
the rhythm and the rhyme want licking into shape before
we can publish them in the Tatler. Call at the office for
them and try your hand again.
Tarry-Diddle; We have thrown your communication into
the waste paper basket. It would in any case have been
censored out of existence.
Subscriber; Your sentiments are unworthy of anyone who
reads our high class paper.
Prohibitionist; We can vouch that nothing stronger than
coffee is served in the officer's mess. They share the ship's
water with the men.
Mr. Editor,
The top av. the mornin' to yez, an' I hope yez are
lukkin' as vinerable as Pat Sullivan's grey haired donkey,
and as swate timpered as new milk. When i seen that
litter av me frind " Buster" wid its quare lingo, in your
paper lasht week, I sed to mesilf, " Pat me boy, perhaps the
editur can do yez a good turn too begorra, as the cat said
to the hin whin she was aitin the chicken ", an' so I vinture
to address your 'anner, God save your 'anner's soul, to see
if yez can can do anything for a poor divil of an Irishman


that has the misforchune to be wid yez on this T.T. ship.
Bedad I was rale proud to offer me services to the Impire
that's givin' justice at long lasht to me disthressful Counthry,
but I little knew avic what a burnin' thirst wad conshume
me inside in the doin'av it. Ye see your 'anner I've been
used to takin' a drap o' the cratur wid me males and a
few drops wid the boys in bechune, ever since I was a gossoon
at Biddy Maloney's wee shebeen in the Kilkenny hills "a
long long way from Tipperary". And, be the same token,
in O' Flaherty's little shanty, forninst the Bush, in a Wist
coast township which we needn't mintion your 'anner
where good old " Dick � wud take a sup wid me, and me'
bussom fnnd Mike O' Hara. So your 'anner what I'm after
saying is this, as the cow said to the man when she was
pokin her horns intill him, Wud your 'anner use your
influence wid the Gineral to have me taken off this ship,
and put on one ot those Australyan boats where I'm towld
they get there grog wid every male. If your 'anner cud see
your way to do this for a poor divil of an Irishman that's
never been behind before, in the matter of his grog, he'll
pray that your 'anner may never wear a wig till the sun
burns all the hair off your pate.

No. 4. Vol. 1. AT SEA. 14th Nov. ig 14.
iHAT are the foundations of Empire ? What
i are the strong foundations of our own
1 Empire ? Quite a variety of answers can
be given to this question all of them
true, or all containing a part of the truth; but we
feel sure that all will readily agree that one of
the deep foundations of the empire, which in spite of
all its faults, stands in the sight of God and man
today for justice and righteousness, is the sense of
duty which has dominated its leaders and rulers.
No Roman of them all, in the golden days of
Imperial Rome, had ever greater reason to be
proud of his name and country, than have they
who live under the folds of the "Union Jack" in
all the ends of the earth. Withut belittling other
peoples it cannot be denied that men of our blood
and race have dared and clone, under an heroic
sense of duty, everything of which the human heart
is capable.

let us not forget that the women of our
race in the spirit of the mother of the Maccabees,
have ever been ready to give their sons to a?
igh and patriotic enterprise upheld and inspired
by this sense of duty. The world applauds the
men who go upon the Empire's tasks. We applaud
m � therS ' Wh � Standi "g ' n the sha-
with 'o em g �' y � U read your histories
with o eyes and understanding heartS) yQu
1 see that one of the sure foundations of Empire
is loyalty to duty. 1
When the day comes that the leaders - those
aid fL P �h ltlonS � f ? res P ons 'hihty or the rank
and file, begin to flout duty, to belittle it, or
to poui their scorn upon it, and deny its claims
then alas for the Empire which stands in its
pride of place and power to-day.
When the old stern joy in the discharge of duty
passes away, when the old grim determination
to hold on to an unpleasant task is a thing of
doom aSt 'n We Sh r" b : SteaCUly marchi "S our
doom. Our only salvation as an Empire is to
have this sometimes stern but always ennobling
ense of duty deepened in the heart of the race
and this is being done today to our farthest'
boundary. Duty is literally the thing due a
recognition of the moral imperative, in a real
sense in the highest sense the call of God. When
a man instinctively and unfailingly responds to the


call of duty, he is in the way of the noblest
manhood. Be it remembered too by us who are
soldiers of the King, that Duty comes in lowly guise,
and that the great heroes are to be found, not
always where you have the blare of the trumpets
and the thunder of the guns, but in the quiet walks
of life. Many a man in New Zealand, today who would
fain be a member of this Expedition is at least
as much of a hero, as the man who stands by his
guns on the field of battle or falls in his tracks
with his face to the foe. A stern sense of duty
towards some homely task keeps him at home.
And many a toilworn mother, her nerves worn
threadbare and her strength exhausted sticks to
her post, until they fold the tired hands above the
loyal heart that has ceased to beat, as great a
heroine as any Joan of Arc.
We see how in the classical instance a keen
sense of duty gave us, as a nation, the command
of the seas. "England expects that every man
this day will do his duty", and that expectation
must be fulfilled day by day if the Empire is
to stand. That duty was revealed in the orders
of the one-eyed, one-armed hero who led the
van of battle and perished in the onset. Under
Drake and Blake, English seamen had learned
to recognise the Call, and so responded that
they swept all before them in "Trafalgar Bay".
What keeps the sentry at his lonely outpost,
facing the darkness or the day, on the rim of the
desert or the edge of the Kopje, amid tropical
heat or frozen snows ? Fidelity to Duty.
And what has sent our brothers in many a day of
death fearless to their doom ? The sense of duty.


Given a disciplined force with a high sense of duty
an you have an army of heroes. What made the
pass of Thermopylae impassible to the Persian
hordes, but for treachery? Obedience to duty
inspired by love of country. And that same love
has saved our own lands not once but many
times as recorded in our deathless stories. It is said
that this is an ease loving, pleasure loving age and
that men no longer respond to this high call. That
e age is self indulgent cannot be denied, but
happily the crisis in our national life, shows that
men in all the bounds of the Empire are ready still
to walk in the sacrificial way at the call of King and
Country.

All lectures have been postponed for the time being on
account of the heat. For the same reason Reveille is being
sounded at five, and the horses exercised before breakfast.

The excessive heat causes a horse to go on the " rampage "
every now and then, and for the space of a few minutes things
are made to hum. He generally manages to kick down the bars
between him and the next horse and is only quieted when a
bucket of cold water, is thrown over his head; when a fit
takes him at " stables" and a trooper happens to be at
his heels, all sprinting records are broken.

The following clipping from the World's News of August
1911 will be read with interest. - Remarkable gunnery
practise has been made by the fleet at the China Station
during the recent gunlayer's test, in which the flagship
Minotaur has, it is believed, achieved a world's record.
Firing with a 7.2 in. gun, Leading Seaman Russell made
six hits, five direct and one ricochet in 31.8 seconds.

Ihe Minotaur is at present at the head of the fleet in
records, though the firing of the other warships has been
uncommonly good, last year's averages having been exceeded.

A bucket of water was left temporarily in front of a horse
stall. The horse considered it for awhile, them deliberately
put his foot into it, and drew it in. Lightning passing
at a game of football was nothing to the way in which


that bucket was passed from back to front, and from horse
to horse. Needless to say when it finally emerged from the ruck
it resembled a piece of scrap iron more than a bucket.

The cloud eftects this week have been particularly fine.
Once or twice it was difficult to believe that we were not
in sight of land. One man indeed was so positive that he
risked money on his conviction, and five minutes after was
a sadder and wiser man.
Frequently on Saturday the clouds on the horizon represented
in a most extraordinary way a scene from the arctic regions.
Under a curtain of dark cloud the sun could be seen shining on
the ice fields and the icebergs.

SATURDAY 7th NOVEMBER.
Considerable discomfort is being experienced today on
account of the heat, the sun being directly overhead. Many of
the men are taking to Hielandnians breeks, an 1 many of the
officers and most of the men to silk stockings! Official log:

SUNDAY Bth NOVEMBER.
Hats were worn today at church parade, and the service
was shortened as a tribute to the excessive heat.
The Minotaur passed through our lines this morning, and
after speaking the Melbourne disappeared over the horizon.
It is said that she has left us for good, but one never knows.
In any case she will be in wireless touch for some days. One
would hardly expect to be left with our present escort, seeing
we must be in the danger zone. We expect to pass the Cocos
Islands this evening, but not near enough to get a sight of them.

MONDAY 9th NOVEMBER.
This used to be the late King Edward's Birthday, and will
henceforth be marked in the annals of the Australian Exped-
itionary Force as a "Red Letter" day. This morning at day-
break the Sydney disappeared over the horizon thereby causing
a good deal of speculation. 1 hen about ten o'clock we
saw the Melbourne cleared for action and her flags flying
leave her station and race away in the same direction, the
Jap on our starboard flank following fast! what did it
mean ? We were not left long in doubt. It was reported


that we were being chased by two German cruisers probably
the Emden and the Konigsberg, and the order for the transports
was full steam ahead. We felt quite confident that our escort
was able to deal with the Germans and experienced only a
pleasurable excitement in the probable result, which came to
hand much sooner than we could have anticipated.
We were reassured in the first place by seeing the Melbourne
and the V Buki retrace their course, and then the tidings were
flashed through the Convoy that "the enemy had been beached
to save herself from sinking", and that "the Sydney was chasing
her collier". Later that "the Emden was sunk and done for"
and later still casualties on the Sydney, two killed and thirteen
wounded". It goes without saying that there was great
excitement throughout the entire Convoy at these unexpected
tidings. The Emden had no conception that we were in the
neighbourhood. The Sydney overhead her calling up her collier
and raced after her with the above result.
We've not heard what casualties the Emden has sustained
but the Sydney is to be congratulated on having accounted for
such a formidable opponent, and having gone through her
baptism of blood so successfully. The naval engagement was
the only topic of conversation today. There will be great
rejoicings in Australia and New Zealand when the fact becomes
known. Official log : Dist. run 237, Wind S.E. Gentle Trades

TUESDAY 10th NOVEMBER.
The men are hosing not only the horses but one another these
days. We had a message from the Sydney today saying that
she would sail to rejoin the convoy as soon as. she had
succeeded in embarking the German wounded and prisoners
which might take another 24 hours as the operation presented
considerable difficulty. Official log : Dist. run 250; Wind ES E

Congratulatory messages passed between the N Z.G.O.C. and
the Australian G.O.C, regarding the Sydney's exploit. Rumour


hath it that the Konigsberg is in the neighbourhood and that she
crossed our track two or three nights ago. Official log: Dist.

THURSDAY 12th NOVEMBER.
The Melbourne said good-bye this morning and our only
protection now as far as we can see, is the Jap. This afternoon
one of the C.P.R. boats ( Empress of Russia probably) passed
us on the starboard making south. She is an armed auxiliary
cruiser with 8 4.7" guns. It is supposed that she may be going
to relieve the Sydney of her wounded and prisoners. Being a
passenger boat in times of peace and with plenty of accom-
modation, this seems feasible. Official log: Dist. run 259 >

FRIDAY 13th NOVEMBER.
The Equator was crossed this morning between seven and
eight o'olock. Some of the men would fain have had a visit
from Father Neptune but this ship is too busy for such frivolities.
We must leave these ceremonial touches to the ships that have
few or no horses and an unlimited number of men. Orders
have come for the N. Z. Convoy to take station abreast of the
Australian Convoy and proceed to Colombo.
The protected cruiser Hampshire of 4 7-5"6.6" guns, and 20
3 prs. emerged out of the Scotch mist which has enveloped us
since morning, to take us in charge. Our slowest boat is a
little bit faster than the Australian's slowest boat and so we
have now the privilege of pushing ahead. Official log : Dist. run

Boxing.
Some very interesting boxing was witnessed on this boat on
the 30th October down on No. 5 horse deck, between the
members of No. 1 troop, 9 th Squadron, when some five or six
bouts were keenly contested. Quite a large crowd assembled
to watch the boys engaged in the noble art of self defence, and
at the end of each round the combatants were awarded hearty
applause. The Star" event of the evening was a three round
go." between Corpl. Whyte and Corpl. Groves. This bout
caused great excitement and was thoroughly enjoyed by the
audience. At the sound of the gong Corpl. Groves jumped
straight from his corner and went in at his opponent as if to
finish him there and them, but that worthy knew too much; as
quick as lightning he side stepped and bringing that deadly
left into play landed the terror of the deck a terrific blow on the
lower part of his "jaw." "That's steadied him a little"
someone was heard to remark; but it didn't. With the pluck
and courage of a lion he came at him again and again, but
only to meet that terrible left which was always hovering
round. However towards the end of the round Corpl. got in
some telling blows which equalised matters a bit, and when
the gong went, the claret was flowing from Corpl Whyte's beak.
The second and third rounds were a repetition of the first;
straight out biffing from start to finish, and when the gong
went to declare the winner, the referee laid his hand on Corpl.
byte's shoulder; and by the way the audience applauded I
think they were all satisfied with the decision.
The following bouts were also very interesting and the
spactators had the pleasure of seeing some very excellent
boxing. Trumpeter O.G. James II st. v Trooper W. Arnold
10 st. 12 lb. a draw: Trooper Jeffreys 10 st. v Trooper Perry
101 st. 6 lb. the latter won on points after a real good go; Heavy
Weights Trooper T. Moore and Trooper J. H. Bremner, Moore
was declared the winner.
I am sorry to say there has been no boxing for the last week
on account of the heat, but as soon as it cools down we will be
at it again.

You sleepy patient old idol
A' chewin' away at your 'ay
I wonder your pore legs aint busted
A standing there day after day.
No wonder you kicks at a shovel
And bites at me arm as I pass,
I bet how you dreams of a station
Where your belly was full up with grass.
This quarrel it aint 'o your makin',
You lived on your station content;
When your boss 'eard that soldiers was wanted
'E on with your saddle and went.
You thought you was off to a picnic.
You'd be back in the paddock by morn
A'tellin' your pals how the boss told the gals
O' the millions o' sheep that 'e'd shorn.
But I guess that you aint at no picnic
When once you get shoved in them stalls,
Its good-bye to green grass and freedom
An' its feed up and water by calls.
When the ship starts a rollirf you wonder
What kind of a stable your in
An' you can't go your tucker and water
An' you can do nuthin' but grin.


M
If I could I'd give you a pension
When we reach our far distant shore
But we'll be ordered to shove on your saddle
And march you poor beggar to war.
Then remember if some blighter plugs us
Try to think of me then as your friend
Though I've sworn at yer, punched yer and cursed yer
We're mates in one grave at the end.

altered ! When 1 telt a neebur o' mine I was gaun tae write ye

There's anither frien' o' mine in the ship wha's sentiments are

fonder o' the whuskey or the bawbees, the whuskey maist times
wins the day, when the tanes put against the tither?but here

No. 5. Vol. I. AT SEA. 2lst Nov. 1914.
N English Girl in Paris" has been sent
to us for review. It professes to set
forth the life and doings of a middle
class family in Paris which has many
points of contact with the old French Nobility.
Betty, the English girl, has an old uncle who has
lived for many years in the gay capital, and him
she visits yearly, becoming intimate and friendly
with a French family, who adopt her as a kind
of cousin. By turns they adore her and marvel
at her impossible English ways of looking at
life and life's problems; but they mostly adore
her, and shrug their shoulders at what they consider
her insular prejudices. There is a real enfant terrible
in the person of little Jacqueline, who is spoiled
by everyone and has a most uncanny knack
of interposing at awkward places in the
conversation. When the "chou" takes a hand in
the conversation it is screamingly funny for the
onlookers, but decidedly uncomfortable for the


person who happens to be the victim for the time
being. Betty herself is charmingly frank and natural
and part of the book's fascination is the literal way
in which the French idiom is rendered into English,
thereby giving it the quaintest of turns and a flavour
all its own. The book certainly makes clear to the
reader how much we all are the slaves of custom
and convention, and how much depends upon the
point of view. Betty's friends it seems talk quite
reely and naturally about subjects that are banned
in polite English Society?there is nothing in the
book itself to offend the most puritanical reader?
and when her very proper, and sometimes prudish
English friends visit her, she is often in great straits'
to steer clear of the pitfalls that await the unwary
The book shows, too, how the French mother is
bound up in her children?to marry well her son
and to accumulate a good "dot" for her daughter'
When the ladies meet socially the chief topic of
conversation, the topic to which every other topic
Which is introduced seems to lead is marriage the
French mother is filled with horror at the ways of
the English in this connection. Moreover the
French son and daughter leave this all-important
matter with complete confidence in the hands of
their parents, who, for the most part according to
Betty, manage the business on a commonsense
practical plan, which makes at least for the
material comfort of the interested parties. Imagine
an English girl bringing her fiance up for
inspection before a mutual friend in this fashion
Say then do you not find he resembles absolutely
to an Englishman ? He has the air, is it not so
of making well 'le sport' and 'la chasse'. The eye
clear and frank; the colour fresh. Eugene stood
there for my inspection, heels together like a


soldier called to attention. Fortunately my coun-
trymen offer such a variety of type I could
truthfully say be might very well be an Englishman.
?I find this is often taken as a compliment to a
Frenchman, but I know of no Englishman who
could enjoy being told by his bride that be looked
just like a Frenchman, or the living image say
of a German! I must not forget to add though
that I fear no Frenchwoman would be gratified
if her fiance said she resembled 'une Anglaise'
unless she were on horseback". Our space will
not permit us to deal with other aspects of the
book. A chapter on the Old Nobility is rich in
incidents that to an Englishman appear utterly
ludicrous if they were not in reality so pathetic.
A chapter on the tyranny of the concierge is full
of humour of a particularly grim type for those
who are principally concerned. On the whole we
felt after reading the book and this may only be
another example of our colossal British prejudice
that it is good to be a subject of King George Fifth !
But Betty can never persuade a Scotsman that the
Scottish maid, Margaret MacDougall, pronounced
"lamb" as larm! She may have called it lahm but
never larm.


H Locals - H
Locals.
The Cingalese as we saw them on the streets, are noticeable
for theii diminutive size and for their glistening copper coloured
skin. Some of the children are remarkably pretty, and for the
most part, have soft musical voices. The rickshaw men must have
had the time of their life both as regards work and pay. Never
before surely was there seen such an influx of white men?men
who weie out to see as much as possible in a given time and
not too particular as to what it cost them. Monday the 6th
Novembei will be marked as a red letter day in the annals of the
caste. It is astonishing how much ground they can cover with
that jog trot of theirs.
?�r
* *
Here is one of the incidents of the march. Many children
followed us begging for money and offering fruit for sale. One
little chap who didn't seem to be more than four or five mana-
ged to sell a cocoanut for sixpence and was proudly showing
the coin to an admiring group of his mates when a man came
along the footpath, seized his hand and despite his cries
extracted the sixpence. But swift vengeance overtook him. A
trooper left the lines, gripped his shoulder, made him deliver
and restored the sixpence to the boy. You can imagine the
triumphant glee of the children. If they did not cheer the
troops they did something remarkably like it, and the small
boy danced a kind of baka in front of his deliverer.
*
* *
Never have we seen cleaner or smootherroads, and itis said they
extend far into the country. There was neither dust nor gar-
bage to be seen in the streets of the native Quarter we passed
through, yet were the shops anythingbut prepossessing.The streets
were clean but many of the shopkeepers looked anything but
clean. "Ceylon's spicy breezes" were in evidence but too often


on the march we got a whiff of something that was innocent of
spice. We felt that with the exception of bananas and cocoa-
nuts we should prefer to buy our eatables elsewhere.
*
* *
If the men were remarkable for their diminutive size their
oxen were equally so. To see the men loading coal made one
wonder where they get their strength, and to see the cart and
the loads which a tiny yoke of oxen pulled along was even
more astonishing. The oxen imported from India are white, and
larger than the native oxen, with long thick horns shaped like
a yak's : but it is native oxen that are chiefly used. They not only
pull the bullock drays with heavy loads, but trot along quite
smartly in lighter vehicles which are used for passengers.
They look very well cared for and there seems to be a complete
understanding established between them and their drivers.
*
45- *
The national religion is Buddhism, and the Cingalese are
devout worshippers, altho' their priests, according to a recent
writer, are in no sense leaders, and do not set a good example
to the people. Christianity has made greater progress among
the educated classes in Ceylon, than it has done in India.
*
* *
The Cingalese beggars were a pathetic sight. One wondered
what custom the withered old women got, who sat by the road
side with a basket containing a few berries or nuts, or a plate
with a few uninviting looking cakes. No one seemed to notice
them, and there they sat forlorn and patient hoping against
hope for the customers who never came. But as it is the poor
who help the poor, we doubt not that some who are a little less
forlorn and poor help them to eke out what at best must be but
a precarious existence. A anyrate they can always be warm
and snug, and where fruit is so cheap and plentiful have enough
to keep the torch of life burning which is more than can be
said of beggars farther North and West.
*
* *
The policemen magnified their office and were not slow to
use their whip on the crowd when there was any danger of it


getting out of hand. Indeed they rather enjoyed laying about
them vigorously. They were courteous to the strangers, and
ready to give any information within their power. Judging by
some of the numbers on their caps there must be quite an army
of them. The Indian soldiers tall and athletic looking were a
great contrast to the natives. Many looked like kings and prin-
ces moving about among their subjects as they marched along,
erect and proud, every inch a soldier.
*
* *
One of the prettiest sights to be seen in Colombo is the little
fleet of Catamarans going to and from the fishing grounds
They usally carry a crew of three. One of them steers, a second
keeps the great oblong sail of fine cocoanut fibre wet with the
sea water, which he skilfully applies with his stick to every
inch of it, until it glistens purple in the sun, not unlike a great
coloured balloon, and the third stands on the outrigger to prevent
the dugout from capsizing. A breeze is called a one man o
a two man breeze according as one man or two is required to
stand on the outrigger to keep the whole concern from going
over. We saw them racing in from the fishing grounds on
Tuesday morning, some of them much faster than others and
making as near as we could judge from ten to fifteen knots an
hour. They looked like wild things instinct with life and
beauty.

* *
One of the most pleasant experiencies in Colombo was the
accidental meeting of friends whom we had not seen since we
left New Zeuland. Quartered on different transports and not
knowing one another's movements it was delightful to meet in
the most unexpected fashion and compare notes.
All who knew him were distressed to learn that Lieut. E.J.H.
Webb had met with a serious accident on Friday the 13th inst.
which ended fatally after an unsuccessful operation in Colombo.
He was with us at Awapuni, and later with this ship's company
at ITentham, and the officers and men who knew him esteemed
him highly for his personnal qualities and mourn a promising
career cut short. From what we can learn the accident happened
very simply. He dived from the top of a horse box into a


shallow canvas bath which had been prepared for the Neptune
festivities, and dislocated his neck. He was conscious all the
time, and bore himself with manly fortitude although he knew
that there was little hope. He was taken ashore on Sunday
and the dislocation reduced, but he succumbed two days later.
He had just finished his medical course at the Dunedin
University before joining the N. Z. E. F. Much sympathy will
be felt for his relatives and friends.

Some of our men came across members of the Sydney's
crew in Colombo, and were treated to a vivid account of the
recent action with the Emden. It is said that the two cruisers
raced at one another. The Sydney opened fire at 6,000 yards
and made the first hit. Before very long she had swept the
Emden's decks, masts and funnels going by the board.
The Sydney was hit two or three times but very little damage
was done. One shell passed though the first lieutenant's cabin
without exploding. Half the Emden's crew numbering close
on 500, were put out of action, 200 being killed. The Commander,
and Prince Joseph of Hohenzollern the Kaiser's nephew, were
unwounded. The surviving officers were given all the honours
of war and retained their swords.

Just before daybreak a revolving light was seen on our
starboard bow. We reached the Colombo roadstead between
eight and nine o'clock, just as the mists were breaking over
the ranges behind the city. The prospect from the ships was
pleasing and picturesque. For the great majority of us it
was our first contact with the Orient, and all eyes were
directed to the palm-fringed shore lined with its fleet of
Catamarans, the Cinnamon gardens, famed the world over
for their luxuriant beauty, the crowded harbour, and the City
itself with its composite buildings speaking of East and West
and Past and Present. The chief event of the morning was the
arrival of the Sydney, and her consort the Empress of Russia with the
German prisoners. Our men would fain have given the gallant
Sydnev a hearty British cheer for her recent doughty deed,
but according to instructions they merely stood at attention
as she steamed past. Her decks and rigging were eagerly
scanned for evidences of the affray, but to the uninstructed
eye there was nothing to indicate that she had so recently
been in action. The harbour was crowded with all sorts of
craft besides others lying out in the open roadstead. The
following cruisers were berthed inside the Breakwater the
Russian cruiser Askold, the Japanese FBuki, the Australian
cruisers Melbourne and Sydney, the British cruisers Hampshire
and Yarmouth, and the auxiliary cruiser Empress of Russia
making in all a quite respectable fleet. As many of the transports
as could be accommodated, also anchored inside, and very
quickly the Cingalese were busy pumping in water and
shooting in coal. General satisfaction was felt on our arrival


inside the breakwater to learn that leave was to be granted to
the men to go ashare. To begin with it was understood that no
leave was to be granted but better counsels prevailed and it is
believed that very few members of the expedition failed to see
the sights and smell the smells of this oriental city. One
officer accompanied every twenty men on a short route march
through the native quarter. We deal elsewhere with various
incidents of the march. The men were greatly pleased to view
oriental life at close quarters and in very tew cases, throughout
the entire force, was that liberty abused. In one 01 two cases
resident New Zealanders hailed our men with delight and
treated them to a lavish hospitality.

We learned with deep regret this morning that Lieut.
E.J.H. Webb, one of the medical officers on board the Arawa,
had met with a serious accident on Friday last and was not
expected to recover.
The transports in harbour occupied the day in running
parties of men ashore, in filling up with coal and water, and
getting necessary ships stores. Some of the transports left
their anchorage inside the breakwater unexpectedly, early in
the afternoon, and proceeded out to the roadstead. This meant
that in some cases returning parties had a long pull in the ships
boats in a head wind and a rough sea. In some cases two
hours were consumed in reaching the transport. The ship was
hailed not once but many times in the night with belated
parties looking for their floating houses, our own padi e among
the number!
TUESDAY 17th NOVEMBER.
A cool breeze made things very pleasant for us this morning
in the roadstead. The fishing fleet, sailing to and from the fish-
ing grounds, the morning sun gleaming on their purple sails,
made a pretty picture. As they went flashing by more than one
expressed a wish that he were on board. We left the anchorage
to resume our voyage at 11.30. Fen of the fastest Australian
boats were left behind to coal and water, and will join us in
a day or two,

Lieut. Webb, who died yesterday, is being accorded a military

morial service was held on board each of the N.Z. Transports at
II a.m. Tonight between seven and eight o'clock something
went wrong with the electric light and the whole ship was plug-
ged into darkness. There was quite a panic among the horses
who are on the lower decks, and the horse piquets had all their
work cut out to quieten them, until lights were procured. To-

we saw their twinkling lights.

On Dit.
That, two padres belonging to the N.Z.E.F. had a great time on
shore on Monday last, and that one of them nearly missed
the Bus, on account of his ship unexpectedly leaving the
anchorage in the afternoon. He had to hire a row boat to
take him out into the roadstead and discovered that finding
his ship in the dark was nearly as difficult a task as "looking
for a needle in a haystack". He had often in days gone by
been soothed and inspired by the strains of the pipes, but
never before did they sound so sweetly as they did that
night when they made sure the identity of his ship.
That, while one of our trumpeters was sounding "stables" one
day last week the regimental dog sat up on his hind legs,
and howled most piteously. The trumpeter looked unspeak-
able things, and finally broke off in the middle of his call
and said "D you if you don't appreciate music clear out
of this! ".
That, the O.C. hired a rickshaw boy with a red fez. He hadn't
gone far when the boy stopped, looked at the O.C. in an
apologetic manner and said, "Oh, I sorry he Turk," plucked
off the cap, trampled it well, and proceeded on his way. It
heasn't transpired whether he got any extra pay for his
patriotism.
That, one of the troopers bargained with a native for a moon-
stone for which the latter to begin with wanted 2/- Finally
the stone was purchased for six pence, and the trooper gave
the native a florin and waited for his change. "Yes" said
the native "you make a very good bargain. You get 3/-,
4/-, perhaps 5/ ? for that stone when you get to your own
country". " All right my son" said the trooper "shell out
my change, and be quick; I must get back to the boat."
"Ah yes" said the native, " welly good bargain you make
here your change " and deposited in the outstretched hand
three moonstones !!


That, the O.C. got a shock on Monday about midnight, when a
boat from shore hailed the Orari with the information that
it had ten of our men aboard, although the adjutant had
reported every man aboard at six o'clock the same evening !
Needless to say it was the man from shore who made the
mistake. The luckless ten belonged to some other transport.
Before the mistake was discovered the guard was turned
out to receive the delinquents and came to the gangway
under the impression that they were to receive a load of
"shikkar".
That the Orari has been re-named the "Workshop".
That a new slang word has made its appearance on board, viz:
"Possy." A man speaks now of having secured a good
" possy " meaning thereby a good position for his bed.
Later on when the campaign is in full swing it will often
be heard.
That one of the guards the other night said to a passerby "Do
you love your country Jerry ? " "I do" "well then get me
a drink, I'm going to fight for it".


Poet's Corner.
Poet's Corner.
The Great War.
Man, Jock, this war's the bluidiest ane
Since e'er the world was made,
Ten times a million men an' guns
In battle lines arrayed.
The thunder o' the guns is heard,
The neighing o' the steeds,
The rattle o' the musket'ry,
The tale o' deathless deeds,
The shrilling o' the pibroch clear,
An' eke the trumpet's blare,
The martial tramp o' stalwart men,
Who suffer an' who dare.
The bonnie country side is scarred
Wi' shot an' shell an' fire,
The daisied sod an' yellow corn
Are trampled into mire.
An' weemin fowk an' bairnies wee,
Are frichtit ilka day,
Are sufferin' things unspeakable,
An' things that mak' us wae.
We dinna doot oor laddies, Jock,
Will dae their pairt fu' weel,
That strong an' gleg they'll fecht the foe
Fu' brave an' true as steel.
They'll mairch an' sterve, an' stan' the weet
In trench an' tented field,
They'll fill their leaders herts wi' pride,
They'll dee but never yield.


But mony bonnie lassies, Jock,
Are murnin' sair the noo
For friens an' brithers gane awa,
For lads sae leal an' true.
An mony mithers' herts are sair,
Altho' their een be bricht,
For honest pride hauds up their heids.
As lang as they're in sicht.
But whiles they lat the tears doon fa'
An think o' deith sae grim :
An' syne they whisper saft an' low
It canna come tae him.
An' whiles they feel like ca'in doon,
A heaven's judgment fell,
On them wha struck the spark, an' made
This earth into a hell.
An' whiles they think o' the weary days
Afore they'll meet again :
An' oft they clasp upon their breists,
In fancy fond, their ain.
Ah, what a gude an' gledsome day,
When, a' thae terrors past,
The mithers welcome tae their herts
Their laddies dear, at last!
But war, Jock, is a hellish thing !
Oh man it gars me greet,
For mithers on the ither side
Are juist as gude an' sweet.
Their laddies haena made the war,
An' only fecht, because
Like oor ain laddies, they've been taught
Tae gaird their King an' laws.
An' deep damnation, surely, Jock,
Shall be the judgment just
On men who for their ain fause ends
This horror on us thrust.

Nos. 6 and 7? Vol. I. AT SEA. 3rd Dec. 1914.
ODAY our voyage comes to an auspicious
1 close. It will be seven weeks tomorrow
1 since we steamed out of Wellington
harbour ; and although the way was not
without its perils, known and unknown, we were so
carefully guarded by the Empire's "sea dogs",
assisted by our friends the Japs, that even had a
hostile cruiser disputed the way, with quiet confi-
dence we could have left our escort to deal with
him in his own drastic fashion, as in the case of the
Emden. Britain's naval supremacy was never better
illustrated than it is today, and Sir Walter Raleigh's
memorable words, uttered nearly 300 years ago
never had more force. "Whosoever commands the
sea commands the trade; whosoever commands the
trade of the world commands the riches of the
world, and consequently the world itself".
The world is a much bigger place in our day
compared to what it was in the days of the
Elizabethan adventurers, but that part of it through


which we have been recently journeying is little
changed in its essential features. During the past
week we have been sailing between lands of mystery
and romance. On the one hand the land whose
religion literature and laws have dominated and
inspired Western Civilisation for two milleniums; on
the other Abyssinia, Nubia and Egypt, the land of
forgotten races, ancient civilisations and buried
cities. On our right lay that Arabian desert in
which the Israelites wandered for forty years after
their deliverance from Egypt, Mount Sinai from which
the law of the "ten words" was promulgated, Mount
Nebo from which their great leader viewed the
promised land, the traditional Elim with its wells
and palm-trees, and away in the far distance that
Jerusalem to which the heart of Jew and Christian
alike turns. On our left another desert; behind it the
delta of the Nile, the cradle of vanished peoples and
the battleground of empires. It was here that Joseph,
the slave, became prime minister of Egypt, here
that the Israelites made their dwelling for 400 years
and multiplied into a nation, and built the treasure
cities of Pithom and Rameses. Here that another
Joseph found refuge for Mary and the Holy
Child, during the years of peril that overshadowed
His infancy. It was here that one dynasty after
another ruled and passed the Accadians, the
Shepherd Kings, the Pharoahs, the Persians, the
Greeks, the Romans and the Arabians. The ancient
cities buried beneath the Nile mud and the desert
sand uncovered by the explorer are eloquent of the
past; and the monuments in their massive strength
have resisted the destructive ravages of time in
amazing fashion. The sphinx looks out over the
desert with the same calm inscrutable gaze as in the
days of the Pharoahs, although his face has been


battered by the cannon of Mahomed Ali. Countless
generations have come and gone since some
unknown builder erected its vast bulk, and who
shall say how many more before he crumbles into
the : ;desert sand which already hides his feet! Our
camp is to be on the edge of the desert, not very far
from the buried city of "On" the home of Joseph's
father-in-law, and probably the university city where
Moses became learned in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians. Within our vision will be the pyramids
of Ghizeh, and we shall be encompassed on every
hand with reminders of a past that reaches back
in some cases to figures that stagger us. It is
our great good fortune that instead of wintering
amid the snows and frosts of England we are to
camp and train in the winter climate of Egypt,
surrounded 011 every hand by tokens of its past
greatness and mystery.

We wish our artist would give us a picture of a line of
horses just before feeding time, laying back their ears,
showing the whites of their eyes, snapping, snarling, and
kicking, greedy, impatient, and angry: first of all afraid that
they are going to be missed, and then that the next horse is
going to rob them of their longed for feed.

The passage of the canal was much more varied and
inteiesting on this occasion by reason of the encampments of
Anglo-Indian and Indian solders all along the route. Many
questions were asked and answered as we passed slowly by.
And in every case when they heard we had come from
New Zealand they gave us a hearty cheer. At one encampment
a fine rendering of the Marseillaise was given by a fife and
drum band as we passed. At Ismailia we came across some
Manchester territorials who had been there for three months.
They informed us that practically all the regulars were at the
front.
*
* *
We wonder what the German prisoners thought as they
passed through the canal, and saw the preparations which
were being made for their friends the Turks, and when they
heard that behind our convoy of 38 transports another Indian
convoy of 17 transports had entered the canal.
The isthmus of Suez has an evil reputation. Whether it is
worse morally than other parts of the world east and west is
difficult to determine. It is generally conceded however that
it is the meeting place of east and west and that the scum of
both hemispheres is apt to gather at the meeting of the ways.

It is certain that vice is more open and unashamed in the whole
Nile delta than it is in other parts of the world. What is it
Kipling sings in his ballad of Mandalay ?
Ship me somewheres east of Suez, where the best is like the worst,
Where there aren't no Ten Commandments an' a man can raise a thirst.

This morning at daybreak the transports were huddled
together like a flock of frightened sheep, and our escort, the
Hampshire, was down on our flank "winking" furiously with
her searchlight. It looked at first as if the confusion had
been caused by the appearance of a hostile cruiser. The
real cause we learned later on, but we are not permitted to
chronicle the fact in the Tatler.

horizon the Hampshire steamed down the lines as though
something were wrong. A message in the afteronon informed

us that the Waimana's ship's adjutant, who has been seriously ill,
was being transferred to the passing steamer the Duke of

The sunrise and the sunset today were exquisite. They
were not by any means gorgeous, but the blending, shading
and interweaving of form and colour have been a constant
delight. The sky for an hour before sunrise and for half an
hour after sunset is a study in colour.
We have been running along the north coast of Sokotra

We are informed this morning of a serious British reverse
in German East Afri :a. This may mean in the judgment of
some, the diversion of the expedition to that colony if re"
inforcements are required. We are only 7 days sail from that
part of the world.
We find on reaching Aden this afternoon that our vanguard
had only preceded us by 10 hours. The Maunganui, we are
told, had an uncomfortable experience. Two guns were fired
across her bows as she entered the harbour probably because
she had unwittingly failed to comply with some of the
regulations. Aden is picturesque in its desolation. We surely
think that signal station on the serrated ridge of the hill
overlooking the port quite unique of its kind. From the harbour
it looks inaccessible even to the nimblest kind of goat, and as
though there weren't room to plant the flagstaff,


Tonight a boat went off to the Maunganui for provisions.
Some of the men got into conversation with the German
prisoners on board, from whom they got an all too vivid
account of the recent action between the Sydney and the Emden.
A few days ago the Aden garrison captured a Turkish fort
opposite Perim with a loss of six killed and 15 wounded.

We steamed out of Aden at 6 o'clock this morning, and are

to our Japanese friends. The following messages were
exchanged. General Godley to Captain Kato I'Buki. "Goodbye :
and thank you very much on behalf of New Zealand and its
Expeditionary Force for escorting us so far, and looking after
us so well. We all wish you the best of luck and success in
your future cruises." Captain Kato FBuki to General Godley
Maunganui. Wb all join in thanking you most sincerely for all
kind feeling so warmly expressed by you towards I'Buki
throughout my service as escort of convoy. It was indeed the
most eventful one of my life, and personally feel greatly
honoured that this duty fell upon me. Reciprocating your good
wishes in every way I send you our hearty Banzai! Be success
and victory always with you."
Passing through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb we got a good

SATURDAY 28th NOVEMBER.
The Orvietto and Maunganui left us to-day and proceeded to
Suez. Shortly after, instructions came through that we were to
be ready to disembark at Suez.
As usual speculation is rife as to the reason why. Some
maintain it is but a ruse to test our readiness for such a contin-
gency ?some that a Turkish army is moving on the canal, and
we are required to ward it off ?and others that we are to relieve
regulars who may be wanted in German East Africa. One
reservist has maintained ever since we left Wellington that
we'll be landed at Alexandria and winter and train there and
be shipped to Marseilles in the spring. In any case most of the
men are quite pleased to hear we are leaving the ship. "Cheenges
are lichtsome." If we disembark at Suez it will mean that we'll
probably miss our first N.Z. mail.
SUNDAY 29th NOVEMBER.
A lovely northerly wind sprang up in the night reviving men
and horses. The horses on the lower decks suffered severely
with the heat on Friday and Saturday. In the lowest hold once
or twice it was very little under 100�. Add to that the smell of
the stable and it is little wonder that the horse pickets, naked
to the waist, had to make frequent visits to the upper air. The
temperature at the morning service today was delightfully cool
compared to last Sunday. The men have been busy all day
overhauling gear in readiness for disembarkation. The
sixteenth horse went overboard this evening.
MONDAY 30th NOVEMBER.
Both the sunrise and the sunset were particularly fine today.
Streamers like the Aurora were visible at night and made a
really brilliant display of colour. One onlooker said truly that
if any artist were to put into a picture the colours we saw
painted on the sky tonight, people would call it impossible
and unnatural. The men have been busy all day preparing for
terra firma.
TUESDAY Ist DECEMBER.
We arrived at Suez this morning, and after staying a few
hours steamed into the canal, the Arawa leading and the


Or an being the second ship. An interval of a mile was obser-
ved between each ship, so that by the time the last transport
had entered the canal, the Arawa was nearly half way through.
Indian troops were busy disembarking at the jetty as we passed,
and at intervals of two or three miles we passed groups of
soldiers busily engaged in building redoubts, digging trenches
and erecting barbed wire entanglements. They were interested
to learn our port of origin and cheered us heartily as we passed.
If that Turkish army comes along it will get a warm reception.
We also passed a torpedo boat patrolling the Bitter Lakes. The
guard on each transport was supplied with twenty rounds of
ammunition per man as it was thought quite within the bounds
of possibility that we might be fired on from the banks of the
canal. As far as we know nothing of that sort happened. We
learn that our port of disembarkation is now definitely
Alexandria, and that we are to be encamped for training
purposes in the neighbourhood of Cairo. The day went out with
flaming crimson banners.
WEDNESDAY 2nd DECEMBER.
We arrived in Port Said early in the morning. In order to
circumvent the Turks the authorities have opened the dykes
and Port-Said is now an island. Some of us were wakened at
4 a.m. with a weird "chanty" of five recurring notes, and found
on looking over the side that coaling and watering were going
on. A couple of planks ran from the coal barge into a hole in
the ship's side and a double line of Arabs filled the planks, one
travelling up the planks with the full baskets and the other
running down with the empty baskets; the fellows with the
empties chanted as they ran to cheer the men with the loads
Coaling a ship by these Port Said Arabs is an unique sight
for any one who has not passed this way before. It is under-
stood they hold a world's record. They are certainly much faster
than the Cingalese and have quite a different method. Early
in the afternoon we moved out into the Mediterranean and so
passed into the western world.
THURSDAY 3rd DECEMBER.
Our voyage in the good ship Orari terminated this morning
about 8 o'clock, when we came alongside the quay at


Alexandria. We learn that it was really intended to disembark
us at Suez ; but things being somewhat congested with the
arrival of Indian troops just before us, it was decided to bring
us on here. We have had a remarkably fine trip all through
and feel quite sorry to part with the officers and men of the
Orari who have been exceedingly courteous and kind. As daily
we have committed ourselves to Him "who rules the raging of
the sea", so now, we would close our record of this voyage with
a note of thanksgiving for His providential care.


?EE*
On Dit.
That the N. Z. elections are over, and that Mr. Massey has
been returned to power and National Prohibition carried.
That, some of the men, in consequence, vow they will never
go back to the land of "Milk and honey."
That, the most astonishing rumours are started in this ship,
and nobody knows their origin and they travel with
remarkable rapidity. As a rule, a man who gives a piece
of information in the forepart of the ship, will find on
walking off in a leisurely manner that the news has
preceded him.
That, the Indian piper on the banks of the Canal last
Wednesday played up to the best traditions of that instru-
ment, and warmed the cockles of every Scotsman's heart.
That, two men who came on board with the electric light for
the canal passage (Arabs) claimed to be Scotch, one saying
"I am Ferguson from Dundee," the other, "I am Macgregor
from Glasgow!"
That, the heat got on the nerves of two men the other day and
from heated talk they got to blows. One called the other
a . . His fellow responded with the same graceful
compliment. A sergeant-major invited them into a quiet
corner, and told them to "work off the bile". This they did
so effectively that presently they were able to shake hands-
By this time the adjective they had applied to one another
was quite justified, but the fight left the other matter where
it was, a matter of opinion !
That, we all feel sorry to leave the real good fellows on the
Orari. That we are not sorry to leave the conditions
obtaining on the Orari, but genuinely sorry to part with
the good company of the officers and crew. We reciprocate
their wishes of "good luck" and "GOD bless you."


That, we all were delighted with the note of admiration which
crept into the voice of various questioners on the banks of
the canal on Wednesday, when on being' told that we
were New Zealanders, they said "Good boys", "Good
work", etc.
That, a pilot, commissioned to bring in one of our transports
had never heard of either Australia or New Zealand!!
Alas we are only of today while he lives in the land of
the Pharaohs. All the same it seems rather wonderful,
considering the number of Australian and N. Z. boats
which pass through the canal. However, we do not doubt
he will know a little about Australia and New Zealand before
the war is over.
That, the O.C. had a very frank talk with the men on
Wednesday evening regarding the moral and physical
perils of those Egyptian cities.

X.Y.Z. We are as much in the dark as you are regarding
the source of the information that " Mr. Massey had been
returned to power, and that National Prohibition had been
carried in N.Z." We venture the opinion that it is merely a
case of a vivid imagination, and that " the wish was father
to the thought."
Buster. We really cannot be bothered any more about that
"ticker" of yours. You had better write direct to the G.O.C.
Anxious. We cannot say whether it is likely you will be
granted leave "to see your grandmother " on our arrival in
England. We feel sure however that O. Cs. will be inundated
with requests from fellows who want leave to see their
grandmothers !
Dear Sir,
We've 'ad a good many argyments on this 'ere ship sence we
'eard that national Prohibition was carried in New Zealand. A
few o' the chaps ?not many?are real glad that it 'as been
carried, cos why, they thinks it 'ill be a great thing for the
country! Other chaps thinks it is a kerlamity, an' on the top of
the war it 'ill spell ruination for our fine little country. (I call it
mine, Mr. Editur, cos I've lived there a good many years now)
Other chaps say that if Prohibition is carried they 'ill never go
back to New Zealand ! I admit, Mr. Editur that that 'ere would
be a kerlamity! But I ses to old Buster that if we find, ses I
that its goin to be hutter failure we can alius go back to the
"status quo" (I've 'eard the toffs talk that away). "Buster" ses I,


"from the pint of view of sentiment Prohibition would be a good
thing." When I mentioned sentiment to Buster, Mr. Editur,
e sneered, 'e did an' sed, ses 'e, "There y' are, sentyment! You
prohibitionists are a bally lot o' mugs : the likker traffic must
be managed on sound business lines, an" there aint no room for
sentyment." " All the same Buster", ses I, "sentyment rules this
'ere world o' ourn. Why Buster" ses I, "what but sentyment, the
sentyment o' patriotism 'as built up this here army of a million
men that Kitchener's goin' to face the Germans with in a few
weeks time ? An' what but sentyment is bringin us chaps
from all the ends of the earth at the call of the empire ?
An so ", ses I, " sentyment is all right as an argyment
Think of the 'Omes that'll gain in confort, the little Kiddies
that'll 'ave their chanst like other little Kids, the gain in self
respect of many a poor devil what's ' out an down' but
would soon 'make good', an' think of the lives that would
be saved." Ses I, to Buster, "Don't yer think", ses I, "that
these things ought ter count somethim' against pounds,
shillin's an' pence? An' then" ses I ter Buster, "We spend
about four millions, nearly four pun' ahead man woman an'
child on likker, an' that's reckoned at whole sale prices, an'
a million o' that gos ter the Government Well then, yet, see
Buster" ses I, "we have ter spend four millions in likker for
which we' ve precious little to show, so as we can give the
Government a million. An' if we 'ad Prohibition ter morrow
it seems ter me we could pay that million right out of our
pockets an' be three million pounds ter the good!! We
could even afford to pension off all the likker chaps and
still be a lot ter the good." Them's my sentyments Mr.
Editur, but then p'raps, as Buster ses, I 'm only a "bally
mug " an' don't know what I 'm a talkin about.
Thanking yer in anticipation
Yours truely,
OLD WATER

I would be true, for there are those who trust me;
I would be pure, for there are those who care ;
I would be strong, for there is much to suffer;
I would be brave, for there is much to dare ;
I would be friend of all the poor and friendless;
I would be giving, and forget the gift;
I would be humble, for I know my weakness;
I would look Up, and Love, and Laugh, and Lift !
