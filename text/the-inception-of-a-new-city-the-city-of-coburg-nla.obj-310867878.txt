The Call of the North
The call of the Northern Suburbs, and more
especially of Coburg, is one that should appeal
to any citizen residing in the crowded areas south
of the Yarra; that is, any citizen who has the
forethought to look a little ahead. The expansion
of Melbourne has been going on for some years at
an almost phenomenal rate, and the tide has
swept to a great extent southward until the area
between the metropolis and from 10 to 12 miles
out has become thickly crowded with dwelling
houses resembling rabbit warrens. Who has not
seen from the windows of trains passing through
the southern suburbs mile after mile of houses,
closely packed with yards in which it would be
difficult to perform the proverbial feat of swing-
ing a cat? It is not till the market garden areas
abutting on the Bay are reached that any open
land is seen, and even then the little available for
building purposes anywhere near travelling facili-
ties is quoted at prices far above the average
citizen’s limit. The tide has gone so far south
that to reside in any healthy area means an hour’s
journey to and from the city, and correspondingly
high fare.
Take the Other Side of the Picture.
From the Coburg Station fast electric trains
take residents to Flinders Street in 21 minutes at
reasonable fares, 3id. single, 6id. return, while
electric and cable trams furnish an almost as
rapid and exceptionally cheap transit. In the
west of Coburg extends a huge area, high, well
drained, and with picturesque views eminently
suited for residential purposes, and, above all, at
reasonable prices. Figures absolutely unobtain-
able south of the Yarra, and all this within a
distance of from 41 to 63 miles of the G.P.O. When
it Is remembered that the extreme northern
boundary of the municipality is only distant 63
miles from the heart of the metropolis, the fallacy
of imagining that Coburg is too far from the
city is at once exposed. Opportunities exist for
the acquisition of suitable areas at extremely low
prices, and the erection of residences with ample
surrounding spaces at prices which cannot be
approached in any suburb south of the river.
This, and all this, can be proved by the best
method of reasoning, “figures.” It is your oppor-
tunity to secure a home in a progressive healthy
locality, excellently served by electric train and
tram, with assured extensions of the latter, and
with no greater outlay in most cases than the
rent being paid for inferior houses in more con-
gested areas. As our American friends say, “We
have the goods.” Please inspect; you will cer-
tainly buy.

A COUNCIL MEETING
Extract from “Argus,” 28th March, 1922,
Sixty years ago Coburg was a bush outpost,
with a farming population of 250 persons, its
green lanes intersecting the Sydney road, along
which bullock teams toiled laboriously, and fre-
quently became bogged. To-day electric trams
run where bullocks strained at their yokes; in-
stead of isolated little homesteads surrounded by
crops are to be seen rows on rows of modern
villas, in which are housed Coburg’s 20,000 or
more inhabitants. Where the modest post office,
store, and smithy, and the wayside hotel stood
flanking the main thoroughfare, modern shops
have been built, fronted by broad smooth pave-
ments. Powerful electric arc lights glow where
once flickering kerosene lamps threw feeble
beams over the muddy road. Municipally, Co-
burg’s progress of recent years has been rapid.
It was proclaimed a borough in January, 1905,
and a town in September, 1912. On Saturday,
April 1, it will attain the crown of municipal
achievement by being proclaimed a city.

Means of Communication
There are few places around Melbourne so well
served in the main with train and tram service.
First and foremost comes the electric train ser-
vice, which, although the citizens emulating Oliver
Twist, are always asking for more, is admittedly
excellent. Commencing from 5.20 a.m. in the
“up” service and 5.10 a.m. in the “down,” there
are no fewer than 75 trains each way during the
day. These are so distributed that during the
busy hours of the morning and evening there is
practically little or no waiting, while even in the
slack hours there is never an interval of more
than a quarter of an hour between trains. When,
in addition to this, it is known that the fast elec-
tric service takes one into Flinders Street in 21
minutes from the Coburg and 19 from the More-
land stations, it can be easily realised that the
service may very well be termed efficient, and
considered eminently satisfactory. It will cer-
tainly compare favorably with the time-tables
and speed from places with anything approaching
the same residential conditions south of the
Yarra, or, indeed, anywhere else.
As might well be expected, the excellence of
the electric railway service has put the Tramway
Board on its mettle, and there is a first-class
service, especially during the busy hours through
to Queensberry Street from the northern portion
of the suburb and from the Coburg Cemetery.
This traverses both the suburbs of Brunswick
and Carlton, and the large shopping centres of
these districts are easily get-at-able. For those
seeking places in Brunswick, Parkville and Eliza-
beth Street, City, a change can be made to the
cable tramway, which have an almost continuous
service to the city. Whenever there is a tendency,
as there is liable to be, to “ease off” in the mat-
ter of tramway service and convenience, the local
council gets to work promptly, and keeps the
Tramway Board up to the mark.
Extensions of the service is absolutely a mat-
ter of the very near future. In the west sur-
veys have already been made for a line affording
direct communication between the north-west of
the suburb and the metropolis. This will be the
final touch in the scheme of adequate communi-
cation that will place Coburg an easy first in
regard to transit facilities. This is, of course,
one of the most important, if not the main con-
sideration with business people choosing a subur-
ban home.
Industrial Opportunities
The City of Coburg offers rare opportunities
for the establishment of industries, and already
there are several. Reasonably priced sites and
cheap electric power from the municipality’s un-
dertaking have appealed to enterprising capi-
talists, with the result that spinning mills, imple-
ment works, and various other factories have
sprung up on what was yesterday vacant area.
Practically the northern extremity of the suburb
opens into the country, and there is ample land
for all purposes. The council has, however,
wisely set apart a zone for industrial establish-
ments, an area—or rather several areas—which
affords ample scope for the erection of factories,
and the full development of industries on an ex-
tensive scale. The zoned industrial areas extend
from Gaffney Street on the south to Short’s Road
on the north, and from Sussex Street on the west
to the railway line on the east. There is again
a smaller area of six acres east of the Batman
railway station, upon which an extensive imple-
ment manufactory has been established. Another
huge area is from Gaffney Street on the north
to O’Hea Street on the south, and from Cumber-
land Road on the west to Sussex Street on the
east.
When, in addition to the provision of adequate
areas for industrial enterprise, it is known that
the surrounding district provides low-priced al-
lotments for workers’ dwellings, it can easily be
seen what special advantages Coburg offers for
industrial enterprise.
By this admirable system of zoning, intending
home-builders may select their sites, with the
knowledge that in their immediate vicinity no
factories or industrial establishments may be
erected, and the worker desirous of living as
close to his daily avocation may select his allot-
ment within the industrial zone should he so
desire, or as near that zone as may be his fancy.
“A place for everything, and everything in its
place” is the slogan of the Coburg City Council.

A Splendid Health Record
One of the predominant, if not the most vital,
considerations in selecting a place of residence
is that of health. All the most picturesque
scenery possible, all the most advantageous terms
as to acquisition of land, all the possibilities of
expansion dwindle in the scale of comparison
with the question of the healthiness or otherwise
of the locality. In this respect Coburg can
fairly challenge comparison. On the land agents’
and speculators’ announcements not too much re-
liance can be placed. It stands above contradic-
tion, however, that this suburb is situated in high
and what should be healthy surroundings; that it
has natural advantages that should secure health
to th'ose living within its boundaries; but, as an
ancient saying has it, the “proof of the pudding is
in the eating,” and the “eating” is surely and ef-
fectively furnished in the official Government sta-
tistics—a statement unprejudiced, unbiassed and
absolutely reliable. It is to this solid basis of
fact rather than panegyrics of interested people
that we direct attention.
Many persons, looking forward, pin their faith
to an extent upon the birth rate of a community,
and here Coburg shines as the birthplace of a
rising generation of Australians, for, according
to official figures, the birth rate for 1920 is 31.7
per thousand of the population, only surpassed
in a small degree by Oakleigh, Footscray and
Northcote. The lowest rate, it may be remarked,
is in St. Kilda, a favorite suburb, and Malvern,
the home of the well-to-do.
Now as to mortality Coburg compares favor-
ably, very favorably, with other municipalities
around Melbourne, the Coburg rate for 1920
being 10.9 per thousand, while such places as
Fitzroy (14.1), Collingwood (14.3), Oakleigh
(13.1), Footscray (13.6), and Prahran (12.3)
shows conclusively that the crowded areas south
of the Yarra, and within anything like the same
distance from the metropolis as Coburg, are
far less conducive to longevity and the enjoy-
ment of good health than the north.
In one respect this suburb can claim a unique
credit in the matter of health precaution. It was
absolutely the first place in Victoria to establish
a Truby King Centre, the wife of the last Gover-
nor-General, Her Excellency Lady Helen Munro
Ferguson, performing the opening ceremony in
the presence of Dr. Truby King. The centre has
already proved of unquestionable advantage to
the health of the infantile portion of the com-
munity, and has proved a boon to young and in-
experienced mothers in putting them in the right
way to bring up their offsprings to a strong and
healthy life.
The general supervision of the health of the
locality is excellent, and every precaution is
taken, under the supervision of a most energetic
health officer and staff of inspectors. Without
undue exaggeration the locality may claim to be
the nearest approach to a sanatorium within easy
access of the metropolis, and to combine with
those two attractions a suitable residential area.

Extract from Parliamentary Standing Committee’s Report upon Tramway for West Brunswick:—
The whole of the West Brunswick and West Coburg district ... is the most thickly populated area without a railway or
tramway at a convenient distance. In the opinion of the Committee it is entitled to better travelling facilities, both because
•f the distance the residents are from train or tram and the prospects of rapid development as a residential district.

Rating, Upon Unimproved Values
This system of rating, exempting as it does all
improvements from municipal taxation, must be
an important factor in building, either from the
point of view of the home builder or the investor
and speculator. For example, take the individual
building his own residence. In districts where
this system is not in operation, the moment his
house is ready for occupation the city valuer as-
sesses him upon the net annual value—i.e., the
amount at which the house might reasonably be
expected to let As a concrete instance, a house
costing £6OO, because it can command a rent of
£6O per annum, will be rated at £5O (some allow-
ance is made for taxes, repairs and insurance).
Now most municipalities in the metropolis are
levying a rate of 2/6 in the £, so that the muni-
cipal taxes upon the property under review
would be £6/5/- per annum. Suppose this parti-
cular house to be erected upon land having a
frontage of 50 ft., valued at £2 per foot. The
capital unimproved value would be £lOO, and the
municipal taxation at 4d. in the £ would amount
to £l/13/4 —a clear saving of £4/11/8 per an-
num, which, spread over a period of 20 years
with interest, means that the land has cost
nothing, the saving in municipal taxes over the
period having paid for it. Lower-priced allot-
ments mean a correspondingly greater savmg,
and this system has brought upon the market at
reasonable prices very desirable building land,
close to tram and train, which until the introduc-
tion of this method of rating was being held by
persons waiting for the phenomenal rise in values
which must come with the progress of the City s,l
Coburg.
Consult to-day any local estate agent, who will
verify these statements by actual example.

THE CITY OF COBURG

Yarn of Every Description and Variety of Colour produced at above Mills.


Lincoln Knitting, and Spinning, Mills
With the start of the Lincoln mills some years
ago, an entirely new phase of industrial life was
introduced to the municipality. There had been
various small factories, and a fair amount of re-
tail business of tl.e ordinary suburban kind, but
the Lincoln mills was the birth of big industrial
enterprise with'n the boundaries of the town.
From its inception as a portion of the life of the
place the indu. 1 try has been a veritable growing
concern. Like the plants in certain tropical coun-
tries, one might almost watch its daily growth,
until at present it spreads northwards into the
open country, w istward for a big distance, and
on the east has ts its handmaid, as it were, the
electric railway system running direct to the
metropolis.
The mills now occupy an area of twelve acres,
and still there ia expansion. As a natural con-
sequence of their existence there n r
quite an industrial suburb within a suburb, for a
very large number of the employees, appreciat-
ing the advantages of healthy homes convenient
to their work, in fine, open, health-giving sur-
roundings, and within less than half an hour
from Melbourne, provided with electric railway
and tram transport, have settled down, and there
are already practical signs of a thriving town-
ship. This is one of the things that have been
done for the place by the mills. They have
opened up a fine residential area, formerly
neglected and unappreciated, and they have also
shown a beacon light to other industries as to
the potentialities of the district as a suitable area
for industrial enterprise
From the outset there have been established
cordial and mutually beneficial relations between
the proprietors of the Lincoln mills and the muni-
cipal council, and, while the latter, fully appre-
ciating the advantages to the district of so big
an enterprise, have been always ready to meet
the wants of the mills as far as laid in their
power, the former have in turn recognised the
advantages of a council that is prepared to assist
them in every way, and give them every reason-
able accommodation.
The knitting mills are engaged in the manu-
facture of hosiery, sports coats, vests, underwear
and sweaters, and, in addition, there is a dye
house, yarn store, and, by no means last in im-
portance, the silk department, a very large-sized
business in itself. There is to be seen in working
a complete, up-to-date equipment for the manu-
facture of silk hose, including winding, tram-
ming and knitting machines.
There is a complete equipment at hand for the
repair and maintenance of the plant, and this
has enabled the industry to keep gome’
those vexatious stoppages which are such a
marked disadvantage in iiiuuauuu con-
cerns.
Now comes an important feature of the whole
business, and that is the care and consideration
for the employees, of whom there is a small army
of both sexes, in addition to the corps of expert
supervisors in charge of the various depart-
ments.
Dining-rooms have been established at a cost
of over £lOOO. The largest of these will acccom-
modate 450 girls, and the smaller 160 men.
Tables seating a dozen persons each are de-
corated with palms and other plants. During the
winter these rooms are heated by means of
steam pipes. Though most of the employees
bring their own meals, provisions can be obtained
at nominal charges. Altogether one of the most
pleasing features of this vast establishment is
the care of its employees.
The industry has become identified with the
city, and is one of the features in its progress.

Recreation Reserves
The highest medical authorities have always
impressed upon the public the vital necessity of
having “lungs,” or adequate breathing spaces,
in every community. In all conscience, there is
plenty of breathing space in and around Co-
burg, but that is not enough. It is necessary to
provide attractions at certain of these open
spaces, so as to draw the residents there. This
has been done on an ample scale at Coburg.
B’irst and foremost, there is the New Reserve, in
Bell Street, right in the heart of the city, and
within one minute’s walk of the electric tram and
two of the train. This is unquestionably one of
the largest, and probably the prettiest, reserves
around Melbourne, with a playing arena of 185
yards by 165 yards, which meets with the entire
approval of the Victorian Football League, and
which has been graded and prepared under ex-
pert supervision. There is ample provision for
football, cricket and other sports, while a bowl-
ing green affords an attraction under municipal
patronage to the more sedate and elderly portion
of the community. A croquet ground is in the
making, and tennis courts, in addition to those
already constructed at the Old Reserve, are con-
templated, It is not, however, upon the sporting
portion of the reserve that the claim to special
excellence is based. There is an extent of beauti-
fully laid out gardens, splendidly tended, which
present an exquisitely charming appearance with
the varied flowers in bloom. In the centre is a
commodious band rotunda, where the municipal
and other bands from time to time give per-
formances. The whole extent of the reserve is
15 acres 12 roods 32 perches, and it has a front-
age to Bell Street of 560 feet.
Next in importance comes the Lake Reserve,
and here is found a unique attraction in the shape
of a fine body of water, formed by the construc-
tion of a weir across the Merri Creek. This
beautiful sheet of water is surrounded by a natu-
ral park, with ample room for citizens to congre-
gate and enjoy the scenery and fresh air. Pub-
lic bathing boxes or sheds have been erected, and
the creek now forms one of the finest swimming
pools in the State. A fine avenue of trees, which
have been planted in memory of the lads from
the district who gave their lives in the Great
War, furnishes a striking memento of that tragic
episode.
In addition to these, there is the picturesque
Old Reserve in Bell Street (5J acres), the small
Moreland Reserve adjoining the Moreland sta-
tion, the Mailer Reserve in Moreland Road West
(22 acres), the West Coburg Reserve adjacent
to the State school, Reynard Street (8 acres),
and the Pascoe Vale Reserve, Gaffney Street
West (8J acres) —altogether a total of over 75
acres devoted to reserves, and, as the district
progresses, more to follow. Thus it will be seen
that Coburg can claim to be specially well pro-
vided with air spaces and sporting grounds, a
state of affairs due to the wise municipal policy
of securing the necessary areas while available,
and providing for the future.
Extract from the “Argus,” March 28, 1922:-
The civic centre is in Bell Street East, where
new and commodious municipal buildings are
now in course of erection. Near by are munici-
pal gardens, covering an area of 12J acres, and
there also is a group of modem State school
buildings, which is known as the “ladder of edu-
cation,” comprising as it does kindergarten, in-
termediate, and high schools. Bell Street is a
two-chain road, fringed with elms and wattles;
and when the new municipal buildings are com-
pleted, and the proposal of the council to con-
struct lawns on both sides of the street is carried
out, it should present an imposing appearance.
The policy of planting the streets with trees has
been a feature of the municipal enterprise of
Coburg, and it has not gone unremarked. One
American journal referred to Coburg as a model
of street tree-planting. Canadian elms, flower-
ing gums, and many species of acacia have been
planted. Allied with this scheme of street beau-
tification has been the provision of adequate
reserves.

PARLIAMENTARY STAND- x
ING COMMITTEE ON RAIL-
WAYS’ RECOMMENDATION
IN CONNECTION WITH WEST
DRUNSWICK TRAMWAY:—
“The Committee therefor re-
commends that, pending a
scheme being prepared for the
construction of an Electric
Tramway from Royal Park into
the City ... a double-track
electric tramway of the Mel-
bourne and Metropolitan Tram-
ways Board’s standard design be
constructed from within 2 chains
of the Western entrance to Royal Park Rail-
way Station, north-west through Royal Park
to Park Street, thence across private land to
Grantham Street, and along Grantham and
Dawson Streets to Melville Road, terminating
from the outset at Moreland Road. That this
tramway be divided into two sections, and
the sectional fares be the same to all pas-
sengers, no concession being allowed to pas-
sengers who travel wholly by tramway be-
tween West Coburg and the City, or vice versa,
as against those who travel partly by tram-
way and partly by railway. That the rail-
way and tramway officials confer from time
to time to obtain as far as practicable har-
mony between the arrival of tram cars and
‘up’ trains in the busy hours of the morn-
ing at Royal Park Station, and between the
‘down’ trains and the cars in the rush period
of the evening.”
The termination of the West Brunswick-
Coburg Tramway at Royal Park Station for
the time being will enable connection to be
made with the Preston, Heidelberg, Clifton
Hill, Spencer Street, Flinders Street, and
Princes Bridge Electric Trains, thus affording
quick transit to Northcote, Preston, Colling-
wood, Fitzroy, Clifton Hill, Brunswick, Fair-
field, Heidelberg, and other Northern suburbs
without necessitating a journey through the
City.
A model suburb in embryo, capable of rapid and modern development. Within 5¼ miles of G.P.O.

The
State Savings Bank Housing, Scheme
Towards the close of 1920 the Parliament of
Victoria passed an Act to facilitate the provision
of dwellings for persons of small means. The
Commissioners of the State Savings Bank* of Vic-
toria were given authority to acquire land, erect
buildings thereon, and then sell the properties to
eligible persons. This Act is now in operation,
and the Commissioners are building houses at the
rate of about 15 a week, which are being sold on
extended terms of payment.
Persons desirous of obtaining a home under the
provisions of this Act are advised to select a suit-
able block of land, having a frontage of 45 to 50
feet, and costing not more than £l5O. The ap-
plicant should not buy, nor enter into a contract
to buy the land, but should have it put under offer
in writing. The bank will not take over land al-
ready purchased if the price paid is in excess of
the bank’s valuation. Having chosen the land,
the applicant will consult the bank, and select
one of the standard designs of dwellings prepared
by the bank’s architects. There are a consider-
able number of types to choose from, of varying
accommodation and cost. The bank will value
the land, and, if approved, will purchase it, and
advertise for tenders for erection of dwelling ac-
cording to the plan selected. Should a satisfac-
tory tender be received, the building will then be
erected under the supervision of the bank’s archi-
tects. On completion, accounts will be adjusted,
and the purchaser enter into occupation.
The total capital cost of dwelling house and
land, including outbuildings, fences, lighting,
water supply, drainage, sewerage, and all other
costs, must not in any case exceed £BOO.
Any person who is not the owner of a dwelling
house in Victoria or elsewhere, and is not in re-
ceipt of an income of more than £4OO a year, is
eligible under the Act to obtain a house. A mar-
ried woman will not be eligible for a house under
these conditions unless her husband is also elig-
ible, but only one of them may obtain a house.
Every purchaser for whom a house is erected
must personally occupy it.
The applicant is required to provide at least
one-tenth of the total capital cost, and to pay
the legal costs in connection with the transfer
of the land, and contract of sale between the
Commissioners and the purchaser, or mortgage
to the Commissioners. A charge of £2 is made
for valuation fee, and of £4/4/- for architect’s
fee, advertising tenders, and the services of the
clerk of works. Interest on the amounts paid to
the contractor from time to time is adjusted
when the building has been completed.
The amount provided by the bank is repayable
by monthly instalments at the rate of 9 per cent,
per annum, including interest at the rate of 7i
per cent. This works out at 15/- per month for
each £lOO, and payments must be made on the
last day of each calendar month at a branch of
the bank most convenient to the purchaser.
These payments will discharge the whole debt in
22 years and 8 months, but purchasers may re-
duce the period by paying additional sums, which
will be received at any time, and which will earn
interest at the same rate as is charged on the
debt. The purchaser may at any time pay off
the balance of his debt with interest to date of
payment, and obtain his deeds. All legal costs
in connection therewith must be paid by the pur-
chaser.
All dwellings erected by the State Savings
Bank are insured with the Commissioners, who
are authorised to keep an insurance trust ac-
count. Premiums are paid annually by pur-
chasers into such account, and in the event of
damage or destruction by fire of any insured
property, the Commissioners may restore the
property, pay compensation to the purchaser, or
apply the insurance money in reduction or in
liquidation of the debt to the Commissioners.
METHOD OF BUILDING.

Sports and Recreations
The city is well supplied with ample means for
sport and recreation of all kinds. Football and
cricket clubs which Have gained high honors in
the arena of athletic games, and are steadily
but surely pushing their way by sheer merit of
performance into the first grades, are associated
with the place and its growth. Bowls, tennis,
cycling and harriers’ clubs are well known, and
have been established for years, while the lake in
itself is an attractive gathering place between
certain hours for swimmers.
As to pastimes for those who prefer to take
their pleasure easily, there has been recently
established what is certainly the best equipped
and most satisfactory picture theatre around
Melbourne. “The Grand," as its name implies,
is of very large dimensions, and possesses accom-
modation and convenience for patrons not to be
seen in any like establishment around the metro-
polis. One feature of the Grand is its lofty
ceiling and ample air space, also its up-to-date
ventilation and means of securing a constant cur-
rent of cool air. The programmes are well
selected, the pictures screened being carefully
selected by a management which is not tied down
by a big proprietorship, involving the considera-
tion of the wants of half a dozen other picture
theatres. Altogether “The Grand," opened last
year with due ceremony by the Mayor, not only
fills a want, but is in every respect a welcome
and gratifying addition to the recreations of the
citv.

CITY OF COBURG


City of Coburg: North-Eastern Portion—Newlands
Eor the time being Newlands is the rural area of the City. Within its boundaries the dairying indus-
try flourishes, and incidentally furnishes to the city.a pure milk supply, besides other farm produce.
It may be rightly termed the Sanitorium of the North, and, being within easy reach ef both Tram and
Train, it is rapidly being subdivided and placed upon-the market.
The Lake
Reserve is a
reserve of
great natural
beauty.
Through its
entire length
flows the
pretty Merri
Creek,
converted,
before it
reaches New-
lands Road,
into a broad
Lake by means
of a weir.
This lake
forms an ideal
swimming
basin, and
attracts
throughout
the summer
months crowds
of citizens who
thoroughly
relish the cool
waters of the
creek.
An avenue
of Honor,
planted in
memory of
Sold lets of
the District
who made
the supreme
sacrifice
during the
Great War,
1914-18,
relieves the
Natural
Grandeur of
the reserve,
and extensive
improvements
are contem-
plated by the
Council.
The South-
Eastern
portion of
this area is
situated close
to the
Nicholson St.
Electric Tram-
way, and is
subdivided
and ready for
building upon.
The whole of
the area is
outside the
Industrial
Zone, and is
partly re-
ticulated with
water and
Electric Light.
The land is
high and un-
dulating, and
the course of
the Merri
Creek affords
many little
beauty spots
which have
become
popular picnic
resorts.
Fishing in the
Merri Creek is
strictly pro-
hibited, as the
stream has
been recently
stocked with
Macquarrie
Perch. It is
anticipated,
however, that
this restriction
will be
removed at the
end of 1923.
The Lake Reserve is approximately 6 miles from the G.P.O., and can be reached by Electric Car, Sydney
Road (Gaffney Street stop).
