EXHIBITION
of
OIL PAINTINGS
by
RUPERT C. W. BUNNY
SEPTEMBER 8th to 22nd
1925
Held in the Galleries of
ANTHONY HORDERN & SONS
LIMITED
BRICKFIELD HILL, SYDNEY




FOREWORD
THE work of Mr. Rupert C. W. Bunny is only
available to the Sydney public at infrequent
intervals, but has always met with an
appreciative response whenever the opportunity
has presented itself.
This exhibition of landscapes presents a new
phase of Mr. Bunnyâ€™s art, and will doubtless
be productive of much argument and criticism.
By the patrons of the old school it will be roundly
condemned, but to the followers of the new
movement in landscape art, it will be a source of
much interest, and will meet with a favourable
reception.
There is a freshness of colour and directness
of painting which must appeal to all lovers
of Art, even though it has to break down some
preconceived ideas of how nature should be
portrayed.
There are few Australian artists who have as great
a reputation abroad as Mr. Bunny. In Paris he has
always maintained a foremost place, and his work
has been purchased for the permanent collection in
the Luxembourg.
He is a Societaire of the Autumn Salon, an
Associate of the New Salon, and a member of the
International Society of Painters. He is repre-
sented in the National Galleries of Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.
