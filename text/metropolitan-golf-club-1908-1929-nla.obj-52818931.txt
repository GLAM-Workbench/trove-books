A Retrospect and a Birthday
l7th October, 1908, the Metropolitan Golf Club had its opening day, so obviously
on the same day in 1929 it celebrates its coming of age, hence these few lines which
one hopes may not be considered out of place.
Probably some of the younger players of to-day are of opinion that the first attempt
to play serious golf in Melbourne was at Caulfied by a small band of players known as the
Caulfield Golf Club. This to a certain extent would be correct, but the real history is as
follows: —
In 1891 a small number of men led by the late Mr. J. M. Bruce banded themselves
together to start a golf club, which they did, using some land at Caulfield, which was after-
wards known either as Carroll's or Woodmason’s paddocks—there they rented a small
cottage as a club house. They were known as the Melbourne Golf Club, and later about
1895 as the Royal Melbourne Golf Club. Matters went on for ten years till in 1901 they
came to the conclusion that not owning the land and as East Malvern was gradually ex-
tending they would be wise to acquire land elsewhere, and eventually decided on Sand-
ringham, to which place they transferred themselves in 1901, where they dug themselves
in and became the much respected senior club of Victoria, which one knows to-day.

CTTPoWEVER, when the migration took place in 1901, there was a small band of
O' members left who did not wish to join up at Sandringham, because they mostly lived
in the Caulfield or Malvern districts, and journeying to and fro in those days was a very
different proposition to what it is to-day.
A meeting took place in June, 1901, at Mr. Graham’s office at the Widows’ Assur-
ance Fund Building—the late Mr. William Knox being in the chair—the others present
being Mr. H. T. Wilson and Dr. Barclay Thomson and Dr. (now Sir John) Macfarland
and the late Messrs. Graham, Jones, Mackie, Colonel Elliston and Falconer. (Mr. C. W.
Chapman and the late Mr. Mackenzie, who laid out the Metropolitan Course, may or may
not have been present at this meeting.)
In August, 1901, the first serious meeting seems to have been held at Caulfield
(again in the little cottage), and one finds fresh names appearing—Sir Hartley Williams,
Messrs. Baker, Call, Hills, Dunbar, David Mills, H. M. Browne, G. C. Morrison, Baker,
McLean, Cameron and Major Baillie.
One is unfortunately obliged to realise that most of these pioneers have passed
away.


RATTERS went along with much amusement and simplicity until 1906, when blocks
of land were being sold and houses were going up continuously until after one
man had driven a ball through a villa window, and, fortunately without injury, another
had played a mashie shot into a pram, it was decided that history must repeat itself, and
the seniors again had to consider the advisability of seeking fresh pastures.
Eventually after land at Glen Huntly had been inspected, a property at Oakleigh,
known as Barholme. was found to be in the market for immediate sale, and was bought
at once by Messrs. H. T. Wilson and H. M. Umphelby, and in 1906 they offered this to
the Club at cost price, or, alternately, on lease for the making of new links. The Metro-
politan Golf Club was then formed, and the necessary financing arranged to enable mem-
bers to take advantage of the distinctly sporting offer of these two gentlemen.
As a fact the Club was originally registered as a Company Limited by guarantee
under the name of The Australian Golf Club, but as the Sydney Club of that name
entered a protest it was altered to its present title.


C YEN those of us who saw the property in 1906 find it difficult to recollect it to-day.
With the exception of a portion of the 11th and 18th fairways, which had been
cleared to allow of Mr. James McCulloch growing crops for his Jersey cattle, the whole
place was scrub and trees. Incidentally the growing of fodder is still traceable by
the paspalum grass in the rough of these fairways.
There followed many months of arduous toil—clearing, burning-off and ploughing—
till at last in 1907 a small party gathered on the verandah of the villa could see right
through over acres of desert to the Centre Road. Great work has been done since 1908,
but possibly the greatest credit of all is due to those few veteran pioneers who controlled
the almost heart-breaking spade work of 1906 and 1907.
In 1907 a small meeting of about twenty was held to discuss the planting of trees
on the cleared land which would not be required for the course. Enthusiasm was shown
and £lOO was raised in the room for preliminary expenses in order to carry out a plan
that had been provided by Mr. Boyne Luffnan, of the Burnley Gardens. It is interesting
to note that all the trees on the property with the exception of some Manna Gums have been
planted since that date, and one finds it difficult to realise that the whole of the clump on
the left of the tenth, and even the pine trees bordering the Centre Road, were included in
Mr. Luffnan’s scheme.


HE last roll of the old Caulfield Club showed a membership—including juniors—of
102, and one regrets that with the passing of time one finds only about 30 of these
names on the membership list at Metropolitan to-day.
I have been able to get a few photos reproduced which, together with this memo-
randum, kindly accept as a small token of our coming of age.
Yours sincerely.
ROBERT DEBENHAM,
President.
