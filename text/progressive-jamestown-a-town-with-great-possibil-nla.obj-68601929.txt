A Fine Exhibit at the recent Belalie Show of ?Sunshine? Implements.
'T'HE renowned ? Sunshine? Harvester is manufactured at Sunshine Victoria, and is
x the leading and most popular made in Australia. This harvester was introduced
into the South Australian State by the inventor and manufacturer. Mr. H. V McKay
some few years ago, and with his noted determination placed the now popular ? Sun-
shine ? macbine before the farming community. Although many of the old conserva-
tive class of farmer was extremely sceptical at first?this machine on its merits, and
merits alone?against considerable opposition, forged ahead, and displaced foreign-
made machines. To-day the harvesters are verily like the sun shining and doing good
work in every portion of S.A. Agencies and duplicate depots have been opened
throughout the States with gratifying results, and a large and competent staff of travel-
ling representatives are employed Some three years ago farmers ridiculed the idea
of one harvester being able to strip 100 bags per day. Messrs. Bond Bros, placed their
three Sunshines ?at the disposal of the Jamestown representative, and 356 bags were
stripped by the evening. Later one Sunshine machine, with two teams of four horses,
stripped on Mr. D. F. Allen s farm at Gulnare, S. A., 202 bags of wheat averaging
bushels between sunrise and sunset This is surely a world?s record. Last year, at
Jamestown, a dynamo was attached to a ?* Sunshine,? an t for the first time a harvester
was brought into practical use at night time, with highly successful results Mr, P. H.
Bennetts, one of the finest and most practical machinists and machine sellers (his
record is probably the best as a ? seller ? in Australia), has represented the firm during
the past five years in the Northern Areas, and by his ability and straight dealing
methods, has proved himself a valued servant, and one the farmers have every respect
for. The writer would like, as an Australian (not born, but adopted), to ask farmers to,
if possible, support Australian industries in e/ery article they purchase?that is. can
purchase at a lair and reasonable price. It is to evei yone?s?interest to support Aus-
tralian goods?it gives labor to our own fellow Australians, and assists us to build up
ourselves as a nation. In the case of the Sunshines they are generally admitted to be
the finest harvester on the market?are obtainable at prices which compare favorably
with ? foreigners? ? goods, and the feeling that you, as farmers, are at least giving work
to your own brothers-should be an inducement to support Mr. H. V. McKay. The
machine is an excellent one in every way?it has proved itself, and the price is now
lower than foreign machines that were hitherto ? dumped ? in Australia even below
cost (before the new protection policy was passed), in order to kill yom own Australian
industry thatemploys hundreds of Australians and will probably support thousands ere
another ten years has passed. In finality, do try and remember that Australia is the
country your living is gained in, and it is up to every patriotic * cornstalk ? to buy and
use every Australian manufacture where same is reasonably equal in price and quality
to the foreigners? goods
The Late Mr. John Maslin
'|\/fR. JOHN MASLIN is another of the
well-respected pioneers of South
Australia who has ? crossed the bar ? after
a strenuous and meritorious life. It was as
far back as 1857 when he first took up land
at Saltire, near Port Augusta, and foi
many years struggled hard against succeed
ingldroughts Later, in connection with Mr.
R B. Smith, a large area of land was held
at the Hummocks, but eventually Mr.
Maslin purchased a large tract of land at
Bundaleer and spent the balance of his life
in rearing high-class Merino Sheep, and in
perfecting his property. He left four
sons and one daughter. Mr. George
Maslin is proprietor of the beautifully laid
out ?Bundaleer North? station, and Mr.
J. F. Maslin ? The Bundaleer? estate.
Both brothers are keen sheep-breeders, and
possess a magnificent strain of Merino,
which are frequent prize-takers. Mr.
?Fred? Maslin only goes in for cultiva-
tion on a limited scale, having found that
his land is more suitable for the raising of
sheep.
Mr. Ogilvie
MR* J- A OGILVIE has worked up the
South Australian Farmers Co-opera-
Union?s business wonderfully during the
two years he has been the local Jamestown
agent, and last year he was the successful
purchaser of quite one third of the wheat
grown in the Belalie district. He is
energetic, exceedingly so as agent, and
shows his firm a big turnover in the various
lines the SA. Union trade, monthly. He
is Secretary of the Vigilance Society,
Secretary of the Rechabite Dodge, a
member of the Corporation, and a Justice
of the Peace. Mr. Ogilvie is one of the
most energetic of the Jamestown public
men, and everything he does take up
is carried out thoroughly. ??Thorough?
appears to be his motto.

T'HKKK are two thoroughly complete General Stores in Jamestown, Mr. Axford?s
and Mr. Naismith?s and probably the trade is about equally divided Mr. Alex
Naismith settled in Jamestown 3o years ago, and is one of the few old pioneers
remaining. This store is a solidly built one in Ayr Street, and carrier a very large and
varied stock of groceries, drapery, ironmongery, etc. in fact there is very little one
cannot obtain at this store. A successful effort is also made to cater for the ladies, and
the millinery show room, which is in charge of Miss Chester, a clever little milliner
possessing much experience, looked exceedingly dainty at the time the writer
inspected Mr Naismith is also proprietor of chaff mills which were established 25
years ago. A fire occured and new mills were erected five years ago adjoining the
railway station, and the enterprise has gone on on a large scale with distinctly
favourable results. Mr. Naismith, Senr., has done yeoman service as a member of the
Corporation, and is still on the Hospital Committee Board and the Agricultural Show
Committee By man}' acts of kindness and his straight-dealing in all things he is
living to-day to be one of the most respected and admired men in Jamestown and the
Belalie district His son Mr. Win. Naisworth, who is managing the business for his
father, also takes a keen interest in public matters, ano is President of the Institute
Committee, Secretary of the Racing Club, Secretary Lacrosse Club (the premier club
of South Australia). Also it might be mentioned that Messrs. Noblett and Naismith
were members of the last Interstate Lacrosse team Mr. William Naismith is one of
the most energetic business men in Jamestown, and appears to belong to the young
progressive school. Me doesn?t talk much ?acts instead, and these are the people
that really do the most good and the best work.
Mr. McDougall?s Shoeing Forge?The Leading One in Jamestown.
jyj?R. W. J. McDOUGALIy is the leading Wheelwright in Jamestown, and practically
monopolises the shoeing trade. He has gone ahead very rapidly, and from being
an employee only a short time ago is now an employer of several first-class workmen
Great care and trouble is taken to assure that every horse is well shod. Mr.
McDougall, who is a thorough?very thorough?tradesman, guarantees to prevent
horses over-reachine, falling behind, or stumbling, by the manner in which he shoes.
Of course, this does not apply to cases where horses faults are caused through physical
infirmities. Vehicles of every kind are manufactured at the factory, and only well
seasoned and genuine materials are used. Mr. McDougall is honest and outspoken
and a man who quotes a fair price and puts just the ? work ? into the article he
promises. With close attention to business he should yet control a very large and
important establishment.

Progressive Jamestown
And the Men who assisted to make it.
J. EDWARD ROBERTSON,
Publisher and Journalist.
TAMESTOWN is, without
J doubt, the second prettiest
town in South Australia, and
is not nearly so well advertised
as a tourists? resort as it might
and should be. The compiler
therefore feels that in a small
way this publication, with its
large circulation, may en-
lighten the public of South
Australia and the other States
somewhat. Jamestown is
situated on a branch line,
which practically connects
Port Pirie with Broken Hill,
and thus much traffic passes
through. The distance from
Adelaide is via Terowie, 176
miles, andviaBlyth, 155 miles.
Passing through by train the
passenger sees but little of the
beauties of the place, and no
idea of its importance, on

account of the town lying
samewhat away from the
station. However, with the
building of the new post-office,
it appears certain that the
tendency in the future will be
to build on land adjoining the
station, and with the advent of
this, or rather partial comple-
tion, Jamestown should be a
far more compact and complete
place than even at present.
Jamestown was declared a
Corporation Town in 1878, the

following Councillors were

Coombe, E. W. O?Halloran,
J. Moore and Thomas Thomas.
The Auditors were Messrs. J.
Wilkinson and Geo. H. Lake,
and Mr. G. B. Yates, Town
Clerk.
To the first members of the
Corporation much credit must
be extended for the foresight
they showed in laying out the
town so well, and more es-
pecialE in having gone so
extensively in for tree-planting.
The great beauty of James-
town is in its delightful

tion to the shade they give in
the summer time, act as a
great breakwind. Not unlike
other South Australian towns
the place under review has a
main street, where nearly all
the business places are situated,
but it differs in this respect,
inasmuch as there are three
thoroughfares which run
through two beautiful rows of
well-grown artistically trained
trees. And apropos the above
the writer was pleased to hear
that the Corporation intend to
shortly erect new fences around
these reserves ; they are badly
needed, and will, when erected,
add greatly to the general
appearance of the town. The
place under review
has certainly not
gone ahead to any
great extent in lat-
ter years, as the
following figures
will show indisput-
ably. In 1878 the
assessed value of
property was
,�6,491, and in
1907, ,�7,057. It
appears rather ex-
traordinary that in
30 years the assess-
ment should only
increase by roughly
,�600, but it is so.
Probably, the fact
that the land has
been held by com-
paratively so few
people in past years has been
the main factor in the building
stagnation, and as a proof of
the beneficial results of closer
settlement the ?Yongala
Station ? bursting up might be
quoted. Every business man
in Jamestown is willing to
acknowledge the benefits re-
ceived, and yet in their politics
many are opposed to the
breaking up of big estates, or,
at least, record their votes to
Parliamentary representatives
who are tooth and nail against
the principle. Politics don?t
pay the writer ?one makes too
many enemies, but he would
like to point out that it should
be every business man?s gain

to have large estates ?split?
up. The hundreds of insignifi-
cant towns in South Australia
can never grow any larger
unless the land carries a more
numerous population. How
can Jamestown grow rapidly
any larger ?excepting by
natural, or rather, ordinary
growth, unless some more
?Yongalas? are cut up?
Jamestown is a healthy,
delightfully pretty place,
but is certainly over
?shopped? ?in other words,
there are too many businesses
in the same lines, and more
than adequate. There are
only two trades the writer
noticed there were good open-
ings in. One was
for an up-to-date
pharmac}', which
would prove a
highly payable con-
cern right from the
start, and the other
for a modern tailor-
ing establishment.
Gorporation.
Th e present
members of the Cor-
poration are Messrs.
Rosie (Mayor),
Haskard, Grosser,
GOodes, Brookes,
Haese, Lines, Far-
rington andOgilvie,
while Mr. Turner
ably fills the posi-
tion of Town Clerk. The
present members are following
faithfully and well in the foot-
steps of their predecessors, and
are one and all assiduous in
attending to their public duties.
The townspeople may consider
themselves fortunate in secur-
ing such excellent level-headed
business men to guard and
push ahead the interests of the
town. The Institute Hall is in
Ayr Street, and connected
with the building is the library,
which has a splendid collection
of modern literature, also
papers and magazines from
almost every portion of the
globe. It is excellently kept,
and well patronised.

The Institute Hall is a
commodious building, capable
of seating some 500 persons.
The stage is suitable, and quite
large enough to put on a
? play ? in a thoroughly satis-
factory manner, and thescenery
is ver) r creditable, indeed the
acoustic quality is equal to that
in other halls the writer has
visited, but the ventilation
appeared to be quite insuffi-
cient. On two recent occasions
the hall was almost unbearably
hot, and seemingly the only
means the hot air had of
escaping was through the
?top? of the windows.
The members of the
Institute Committee are: ?
Messrs. W. Naisraith (Chair-
man), W. Moffat (Treasurer),
I). Rosie, Haskard, W. A.
Hawkes, C. W. Walker, F. W.
Humphris, Hillary Boucaut
and G. Rippin. The Secretary,
who carries out the duties in
a most satisfactory manner, is
Miss E. W. Paquelin.
The Jamestown Racing
Club is one, if not the most,
successful clubs of its kind in
the Northern districts, and
their meetings are so well
carried out to the smallest
minor details, that it stands as
an object lesson to many
country clubs where much
bungling and many exasperat-
ing delays occur. The course
is situated about a mile from
the town, and covers an area
of 84 acres, which was recently
purchased by the club?the
price being �8 per acre. This
club was only formed in 1897,
and during recent years, owing
much to the excellent manage-
ment and energy shown by
Mr. J. Horgan (the Chairman)
and Mr. Will Naismith (the
Secretary) has gone ahead
wonderfully. A grand stand,
capable of accommodating
some 700 people, has been
erected, and there are avail-
able 64 well-ventilated boxes
for horses. Then there is a
spacious jockey?s and secre-
tary?s room, stewards? stand,
lavatory accommodation, etc.
MR. CAMERON?S WELL-D ESIG NE D AND COMFORTABLE
Gage Photo HOTEL! ??THE GLOBE "
JAMESTOWN is well supplied with hotels ?there being four, and
amongst them is ?The Globe Hotel,? which is splendidly conducted
by Mr. John Cameron, who, like the writer, boasts of quite a bucketful of
? Scotch blood.? ? Mr. Cameron has seen much of the world, and can tell,
when in the humor, many interesting stories of his adventures and travels.
? The Globe occupies a corner block, and is a well-built handsome
structure, where great business is done. The appointments of the hotel
are elaborate, and travellers are invariably well pleased with the arrange-
ments made for their comfort by their host. A splendid table is kept,
and the bar trade is a big one. The writer found Mr. Cameron an ideal
landlord, and one of the straightest in, not only South Australia, but
throughout the Commonwealth.
Mr. J. Farrington s Premises
J. FARRINGTON has for the past eighteen months carried on a
well-stocked Confectionery and Greengrocery businessdn Ayr Street,
Jamestown. The fruit and vegetables sold can always be relied on, and
the proprietor appears to possess the happy knack of securing only one
quality?the best. Evidently he employs a capable buyer in the city.
There is a very cosy little ? bar ? ?a non-intoxicating bar?at the rear,
and there one can obtain almost every cordial manufactured in Australia.
The writer noticed one drink, which is an excellent substitute for beer,
and is named ? Snow} 7 ,? and is excellent. Try it ! The luncheon rooms
are comfortably arranged, and the public may obtain light refreshments
at any time of the day or night. Mr. Farrington has a sound business,
and the way he manages it is a credit to him. He can?t help succeeding.
The stakes last year competed
for amounted to and was
the most successful ever held.
With such an energetic and
painstaking Secretary as Mr.
Naismith is, and now the
property belongs to the club,
further improvements will be
gradually made, and with a
holiday date obtainable (it is
not at present) the Jamestown
Racing Clubshould easil}djethe
premier country race meeting
of South Australia in the years
to come.
Ghurches.
Churches are well repre-
sented in Jamestown, there
being five, which are all well
attended by their respective
adherents. The buildings are
without exception well-built
solid structures, and clearly
illustrate that the worshippers
have not been niggardly in
donations, enabling the erec-
tion of worthy edifices where
they may worship God. The
following are the shepherds of
the various congregations, each
of whom is extremely popular.
Church of England, Rev. T.
A. Frewin ; Presbyterian, Rev.
J. A. McEellan; Roman
Catholic, Rev. Father Doyle;
Methodist, Rev. James; and
Baptist, Rev. E. H. Kentish.
Hotels.
There are four well-
appointed hotels in Jamestown,
and each one caters on a liberal
scale for the public. Tourists
and the travelling public can
rely on receiving excellent
accommodation, and every
effort is made by the several
licensees to make their guests?
stay a happy one.
Belalie Agricultural
Society.
The Belalie Agricultural
Society has now been in exist-
ence 34 years, and, despite bad
seasons, has always managed
to give a creditable Show. The
first one was held on the park
lands, when there was not a
great deal of Jamestown, same
being promoted and engi-
neered by Mr. Wilkinson, who

acted the part of a hard-work-
ing Secretary for several years.
The present show grounds were
taken over some ten years ago,
and gradually improvements
have been made, so that the
recent 1908 Show proved to be
one of the best-appointed and
largest attended in .South Aus-
tralia. Fully 5,000 people
were present, so some idea can
be gained of the popularity
the Jamestown show enjoys.
The new grand stand, which
is a handsome well-designed
structure, capable of seating
some 500 people, was recently
declared open by Mr. A. J.
Murra}'. No doubt, by the
time the 1909 Show occurs the
new stand will have received a
coat of paint; this will still
further improve its fine appear-
ance. Also, the Committee
might endeavor to arrange for
more efficient sanitary conveni-
ences. Mr. John Chapman,
during his fourteen years?
Presidency, did great work in
promoting the welfare of the
Society he so ably represented,
and when handing over the
reins of chief office to Mr.
G. K. Maslin, had the satis-
faction of feeling that an
equally enthusiastic and level-
headed man had relieved him
from his meritorious duty.
Mr. Richard Rowe has been
Secretary during the past ten
years, and in spite of many
troubles and worries incidental
to the working of a large
society, has proved himself an
able and far-seeing Secretanq
possessing much diplomacy
and considerable ability.
Belalie District
Council.
In addition to a Corporation
there is a District Council, the
Chairman of which body being
Mr. G. E. Maslin. The Clerk
is Mr. R. Rowe. The mem-
bers have proved themselves
energetic men, and no com-
plaint (except personal, and
its difficult to please everyone)
can be found with the manner
in which the district require-
ments are attended to.

l\TR. D. McNAUGHTON is the pushing representative in
Jamestown and District for Messrs. James Bell & Co.,
who are Agents for Mt. Tyell Superphosphates, Highland

introduce ?supers? into this district, and not unnaturally,
command an extensive trade with the farmers. Mr.
McNaughton, on behalf of his firm, was also successful in
buying one-third of the wheat last season in this district. Mr.
McNaughton is well-known and respected amongst the
farmers for his straight-dealing qualities, and the firm are
fortunate in securing such an active and popular repre-
sentative.

The Belalie district can
very honestly boast of some of
the finest agricultural land in
South Australia. Fast year
the total acreage under culti-
vation was 21,800 acres, and
the average yield was 22
bushels. These figures speak
very loudly. True, the land
is rich, but a great deal of
credit must be given to the
farmers of Belalie district for
working the land so scientifi-
cally. They are an np-to-date
body of men, who never con-
sider themselves too old to learn
and believe in profiting by the
successful experimenting of
experts. Many people are
pessimistic (probably by
nature), and are continually
talking of the bad j'ears that
are to come. The writer
believes a bad year or two may
happen (bad years happen in
every country), but the farmers
of South Australia are working
their land so well now that,
even with an almost rainless
year, there will still remain
sufficient moisture in the soil
to save a ? total failure ? crop.
It appears that ? dry-farming?
methods are generally em-
ployed at the present day right
throughout the length and
breadth of South Australia.
Sporting Glubs.
There are several sporting
clubs in Jamestown, and the
local lacrosse team is the
?daddy? of South Australia.
The football club has put
up a good record for the season
just closed.
The tennis club has a large
membership, and this game is
decidedly popular in James-
town with both the ? gentler ?
sex and the ?burly opposite.?
Cricket is hardly in full
swing as yet, but the local club
will no doubt, as usual, hold
its own with the neighboring
towns. Recently, through
the energy of Mr. Boucaut,
jun., and several others, a
junior cricket club was formed,
and has met with great success,
inasmuch, that a large number

of members have been enrolled,
and the finances are strong.
The writer is glad to record
the inauguration of this club,
as it gives the juniors an oppor-
tunity to later on fill any
vacancies that may occur in
the senior team.
There are two lodges, viz.:
The Foresters and Rechabites.
They both have a large num-
ber of members, and the respect-
ive Secretaries, Messrs. Hawke
and Ogilvie, fill their positions
in a highly satisfactor} 7 manner.
Industries.
The great and important
industry of Jamestown is that
controlled by Messrs. Hum-
phris and Sons, who employ a
considerable amount of labor,
and are a- big portion of the
Jamestown backbone as it were.
Their factories stand on some
two acres of land in the most
convenient spot in Jamestown.
Messrs. Humphris& Sons have
done much to forward the
dairying industry, and have
saved no expense in perfecting
their factory as far as possible.
Also, it might be mentioned,
that arrangements have been
made with the railway depart-

not go to this expense solely
for the sake of suppliers, as
they gain the advantage from

from saying more.

and put through a large
quantity of wheat yearly. The

a splendid photo of the factory,
which will perhaps prove an
appreciated illustration to those
interested, Mr. Rippin is the
unassuming and very popular
manager.

Gage Photo Mr. G. K. Maslin, Chairman.
SOUTH Australia is distinctly poorer by
the loss of Mr. Thomas Mitchell, who
proved himself one of the most able, indus-
trious, generous and finest colonists this
State has ever possessed Born at Meigle
Scotland, in 1884, he arrived on Australian
soil at the age of eighteen years, and battled
hard for many years, until ultimately he
was able to take up land in the Belalie dis-
trict, and in a few years his farm ?Kldana?
had been turned from a veritable desert
into a beautiful oasis. A photo of the estate
has been secured for this number, and an
idea can be gained of its great beauty. The
area of ? Eldena ? is approximately 1,300
acres, and it is an ideal sheep farm The
homestead is a handsome one, and the
garden is quite a delightful arcadia. The
late Mr. Mitchell took a keen interest in
public matters, and took the leading part in
the formation of that very successful body?
The Farmers? and Producers? Co-operative
Union From the start until his decease he
occupied the position of Chairman of
Directors. To a very great extent the suc-
cess of the Union is. due to his untiring
energy and zeal. He was an acceptable lay
reader for some thirty years, and a pillar of
the Presbyterian Church. Two sons
(Messrs. R. and A. D. Mitchell), a grandson,
two daughters and his wife survive. Mr.
Mitchell, whose sudden and unexpected
death was a keen blow to many people who
had had the opportunity of finding out the
many excellent qualities, and knowing his
great considei ation and kindness shown at
all times to whom there was an opportunity
of assisting. The words?? Well done, thou
good and faithful servant ? might very truly
and aptly be applied to the late Mr. Thos.
Mitchell.

MR. HILLARY BOUCAUT is one
the old school of South Austral-
ian solicitors, having commenced the
practice of his profession in 1878.
He is connected with the well-
known firm of Fleming, Boucaut
and Ashton, who have a big reputa-
tion in Adelaide, as well as James-
town. Mr. Oswell Hunter, L.LB.,
recently joined the firm, and is
assisting Mr. Boucaut in their large
and lucrative Jamestown business.
The lot of being chosen Mayor of
the Corporation has fallen four
times to him, and it must be said,
in justice to him, that during his
tenure of office, he proved himself
well worthy of the position, and
handled the Mayoralty reins with
dignity and exceeding credit. Mr.
Boucaut, who is still hale and hearty,
and one of the real genial kind, is
also a member of the Institute,
Show, and Hospital Committees,
and, in fact, takes a keen interest
in all public matters.
M r - JOHN GOODES is a native
of Sawtry, Huntingdonshire,
England, and placed his two feet on
Australian soil in 1850. He settled
for a time in the Kersbrook district,
but in 1671 took up some 1,700 acres
in Belalie, and battled hard?very
hard there for many years against
droughts and low prices for produce.
To-day he has the pleasure of
being able to say he won, and on his
retirement some two years ago, the
farm, which is five miles distant
from Jamestown, and one of the
best in the district, was handed over
to the management of his sons,
Thomas, William and Frederick.
Mr. Goodes had the misfortune to
lose one of his sons ?a fine strapping
young man?in the South African
war. Mr. Goodes is still hale,
hearty, and one of the jolliest old
pioneers in South Australia, and
possesses more vitality than many
men of forty, although he was born
in 1837. He is a member of the
Corporation, and takes a keen in-
terest in all public matters.

MR, C. W. WALKER,
trading as Walker & Sons,
has now been in business in
Jamestown six years, and each
year the returns have steadily
increased. That?s a good sign,
for it shows very plainly in-
deed that customers have been
satisfied with quantity, quality
and price. If a man or woman
are not satisfied with their
purchase they don?t call again
?instead, trj- elsewhere. Mr.
Walker possesses a double-
fronted shop, with entrances
in front and exits a consider-
able number of feet farther
down ?the exact number of
feet is 163. This will show
that the shop is a large one,
and worthy of being written
up in a good strain. One side
is devoted to footwear, and the
writer having inspected the
stock can very truly state that
the high-class stock carried is
one of the best he has met
with in country towns. In
country towns storekeepers
merely stock the cheaper lines
?so does Mr. Walker ?thou-
sands of pairs?but he also
carries a fine assortment of
boots ? American, English,
and Continental manufac-
ture. Footwear can be obtained
there as high in price as 30/-,
and as low as 4/6; the former,
of course, are the better.
Orders are received from all
parts of the North, and the
proprietor has an excellent
?post.? trade. On the other por-
tion of these premises is found
the Drapery Department, and
the public have a large
range of wear to select from.
An experienced Milliner is
employed, and every care to
keep abreast with the ? times ?
in creating the designs. Ladies
will find a large stock of ready-
made blouses to select from,
and the writer, though a mere
man, noticed some delightfully
chic ones ?the prices of which
no husband could possibly
grumble at. Mr. Walker is
energetic, and amongst the
most progressive in the town.
He is a keen buyer with long
experience, and the value of
a good buyer is in just having
the handy knack (it?s almost
an art) of purchasing just what
his customers require, and
will please them.

Panoramic View of Messrs. Humphris & Sons? factories at Jamestown
A FINE VIEW OF THE BUTTER FACTORY.
'pHK importance of Jamestown as a com-
mercial centre is to a great extent due to
the large and flourishing firm of F. Humphris
and Sons, who have undeniably the largest
factories of the kind in South Australia out-
side Adelaide, and when it is mentioned
that the material for this article took
quite two hours to collect, it will be under-
stood in a slight degree the magnitude of the
works under review. The first department
visited was the Butter Factory, where some
8,000 pounds of the full-flavored, choice and
rich ? Emu ? butter is turned out daily, and
the total this year amounted to nearly a
million pounds. These are figures that speak
loudly. Cream is received from all parts of
the Northern district, even as far as from
Hawker, Hookina, Snowtown and Brink-
worth, and every can is tested in the labora-
tory directly it arrives. The fact that this
firm has 750 suppliers on their books amply
proves that the farmers are satisfied with
their tests, and the prices received for cream.
The factory is underground?the more im-
portant work, such as churning, working up,
etc., is done in the base of the factory, and
even iu the hottest weather the temperature
is low. Coolness, it is generally recognised,
is necessary for first-class butter-making.
There are several of Cherry?s up-to-date
churns, each capable of turning out 3,000 lbs,
per day, and a fine butter-worker with a
capacity of 6 cwt. at each working. The cold-
storage capacity roughly amounts to 8,000
feet, one Aomibeing for cream, and the other
two for the storage of butter. It might he
mentioned, however, that the butter-rooms
are seldom if ever severely taxed to their
utmost, there being such a ready sale for
? Emu ? brand of butter in Broken Hill, the
South Australian markets, and a big quantity
is shipped to Great Britain. The butter
cutter is a large and up-to-date one, capable
of dealing with a big quantity in a day. Con-
nected with the butter factory is a six-ton
Hercules refrigerator, and large quantities of
ice are manufactured in summer-time. This
butter factory is one of the cleanest and most
up-to-date the writer has ever inspected (and
he once delivered milk to factories himself),
and the visit was not only interesting but
valuable from an instructional point of view.
The utensils were spotlessly clean, and every-
where the aroma was sweet and pleasant. It
might be mentioned also that all scouring of
cans, etc., is done by steam. Messrs. Hum-
phris & Sons buy large quantities of eggs,
and wish to emphasize the fact that they pay
cash. A 40-h.p. gas-producer and engine of
the latest pattern is employed at this factory
and supplies the greater portion of the
power required. From the butter factory the
writer explored the ice works, and thence on
to the Aerated Water factory, where a large
number of hands were busily employed
turning out thousands of bottles of soda-
water, lemonade, ginger ale, etc. These
minerals are very highly spoken of, and as
in other lines, Messrs. Humphris & Sons
command the bulk of the trade in the North-
ern districts. The Pickle and .Sauce factory
where Humphris & Sons? noted tomato sauce
is manufactured, was a veritable hive of
activity, and cases upon cases of pickles,
sauces (including that piquant an 1 appetising
sauce made from plums), chutney, etc., were
being rapidly cased for despatch to near and
distant towns. Also, while the thought
occurs, it is worthy of that this firm
makes all its own cases locally. The cordial
department is not a bit behind the others,
and here the same activity exists as is met
with everywhere within the factory gates.
The firm provides its own chemical laboratory
and same is well stocked with thousands of
bottles each containing the various chemicals
needed in the cordial trade. The many lines
in sauces, pickles, and cordials, the writer
herewith gives below, and it will readily be
understood how thoroughly the firm goes

MR. THOMAS MITCHELL?S BEAUTIFUL ESTATE, ?ELDENA.?
Mr. Thomas p. axford.
'J'HE Jamestown Agriculturist and Review well holds its own in the field
of Journalism, and is one of the ? newsiest? country papers in South
Australia. Its circulation is is despatched and met with right
throughout the Northern districts; also odd copies trickle not only
throughout South Australia, but the whole of the Commonwealth. It is
an excellent advertising medium, and is well worthy of the support
accorded. Mr. A. W. Gage is proprietor of same, and has recently had a
splendidly-lighted and commodious building erected in Ayr Street, which
is probably the largest printing office in the country towns of South Aus-
tralia. The views herewith should confirm this statement. Job printing
is carried out in all branches expeditiously, .satisfactorily, and at reasonable
prices. The power for driving the various machines is supplied by a
Hornsby oil engine, and 1,700 copies of the newspaper can be run off per
hour on the Wharfdale machine. Mr. Gage has also gone in for the
stationery business, and has on hand a large range of goods, obtainable at
city prices. He is also erecting shortly a studio, and intends to go thor-
oughly in for photography. Many of the views in this number, and which
have his name underneath, were taken especially for ?Progressive
Jamestown.? They clearly illustrate the excellent work Mr. Gage can
all waste water from the various branches of
the factory. A further improvement has
been made, and new stables on thoroughly
modern ideas have been erected and they
are equal in comfort and sanitation to many
of the best racing stables the writer has
inspected. The growth of Messrs. Humphris
& Sons has been gradual but well sustained
as it were, and they have built it on an
honest, sound reputation. Their goods have
been found to be of excellent quality, and the
firm has always endeavoured to keep faith
with those who engage in business with them.
Three travellers are employed, and they
?work? the whole portion of Northern
South Australia with gratifying success.
The firm also have a large factory situate in
Carrington Street, Adelaide, and the James-
town factory is worked in conjunction with
the city one Messrs. R. K. &F. W. Humphris
are the two brothers this town has to thank
for much of its prosperity, fora large number
of men are employed throughout the year,
and their spending power means much to
Jamestown. Both the proprietors are well-
respected men and noted for their integrity.
No doubt they have had many troubles,
moreover still have them, but they have risen
above them and succeeded deservedly so for
in every article turned out from their factory
they have endeavoured to give the public
clear, wholesome, and pure articles, the same
as they themselves would desire to consume.
In conclusion, in appreciation the writer
wishes to dedicate one motto which he feels
they will appreciate : ? The manly man is the
man in adversity who fights for that which is
right and fair.?

JN May, 1908, Mr. |H. Renk, who has
for some years controlled a large
Jewellery and Watchmaking business in
Petersburg, took over the Jewellery estab-
lishment of Mr. H. N. Lindschau, and
Mr. F. Farrington?s Jewellery Department

the step taken, as he commands a large
trade, and an increasing number of cus-
tomers. His premises, which are in Ayr

chased at City prices. He also carries

that he has the

be sufficient proof
to show clearly
that he has been

successful. His success is due to two reasons?one is his exceeding popu-
larity, and the other, the fact that prime meat and small goods can in-
variably be relied upon. The careful housewife recognises the difference
between tender and tough meat (of course, her husband does too), and
sticks to a butcher who studies her requirements. That?s the reason Mr.
Carter?s customers don?t leave him ; also, he is careful not to ?throw ?
too much bone in when weighing up, and that?s a really good and
creditable point.

trading as Evans & Sons, carry on
a lucrative butchering business in Ayr
Street, Jamestown, and secure a big
share of Jamestown custom. They
have now been in business 7 years,
and are gradually extending it. A
full plant for smallgoods has been in-
stalled, and the silent chopper is
driven by a motor engine. The
primest of meat can be relied upon

every endeavor is made to thorough-
ly satisfy customers. The two sons
are young men who possess excellent
business abilities, and are to be com-
plimented on the scrupulously clean
manner in which their shop is kept.

fyJR. B. T. EVANS is proprietor of
an up-to-date hairdressing saloon
and is one of the oldest residents of
Jamestown, having settled there some
31 years ago. His business connection
is a large one, and he carries
a large stock of stationery,
smokers' requisites, tobacco, and is
the principal newspaper vendor in
Jamestown. The saloon is a well-
furnished, comfortable one, and his
customers always have the know-
ledge that they will obtain an easy
shave, an artistic trim, and a thor-
ough shampoo at Mr. Evans' estab-
lishment. He is well-respected for
his many good qualities, and the
town would be distinctly poorer by
his absence.

M R J- BROWN carries on a Butchering Business in James-

in great contrast to many of the butchering businesses in the
Adelaide suburbs. Cleanliness is very naturally much associ-
ated and necessary in a business such as the one under review,
in fact it is as necessary as selling only the primes! of meat and
smallgoods. Mr. Brown has both, so no wonder he controls
such a large number of customers, and he is richly deserving of
the success gained.

Gage Photo Mr. A. J. Lee?s Hotel??The Commercial.?
A Favorite with Travellers,
A. J. LEE is proprietor of the Commercial Hotel, Jamestown, and
in every sense it is a commercial hotel wdiere every possible comfort
is found. The rooms are large, airy, and extremely comfortable, while
the cuisine is all that even the most fastidious could desire. The hotel is
two-storied, and contains several cos} t private parlors, both up and down
stairs. There is also a w T ell-appointed billiard room, and a much
appreciated balcoiu r with comfortable lounges. The proprietor is a quiet
unassuming publican, w r ho believes in keeping his hotel on very strict
lines, and that is the right way. Mrs. Lee ablj superintends the domestic
portion of the work connected with the carrying on of an hotel, and
everything runs smoothly, and the writer from experience can recommend
the hotel to the travelling public, and assure them that they will be
thoroughly satisfied in every way.
The Railway Hotel, Jamestown.
MR. A. E. BIGGS has only recently taken over the
Raihvay Hotel, Jamestown, yet he has made many important and
necessary improvements for the comfort of visitors and district residents.
And not unnaturally the new proprietor has already found the advantages
arising from conducting an hotel on strict, fair, and impartial lines, by
the increase of the better class trade. Mr. Biggs conducted the Forest
Range Hotel for nine years in the most praiseworthy manner, and the
writer is glad to hear and know that the proprietor of the hotel under
review is absolutely determined to conduct his premises on up-to-date
lines, so that it will be appreciated by the travelling public and the
local residents.
A few of Mr. Porter s Prize-taking Merinos. The Homestead
Gage Photo is in the distance.
A. J. PORTER has one of the finest farms in the District of
Belalie, and is a noted sheep breeder. ? Glanville Farm,? the name
his estate is known by, is but a pleasant half-hour?s drive from James-
town, and is beautifully laid out. The homestead is a decidedly comfort-
able one, and the out-buildings show very clearly the great care and
expense that has been incurred in erecting them on the latest principles,
and with a view? to both the comfort and health of the animals. This
estate was taken over from the late Mr. R. H. Williams, and since Mr.
Porter?s occupation new strains of sheep have been introduced, consisting
of Canowie, Murray and Rockbrook blood. He has been a regular
exhibitor at Northern Areas Shows, and each year sees him more and more
successful. At the last Jamestowm Agricultural Show r Mr. Porter?s exhibit
secured four first and five second prizes from fourteen entries. Consider-
ing that the Northern Areas districts are noted for the breeding of wonder-
Gage Photo Shearing in full swing at ? Glanville Farm.?
fully fine Merinos, and competition at Shows is exceptionally keen, it will
readily be understood that Mr. Porter?s sheep well uphold their prestige.
Each year ?Glanville Farin?? stud rams realise big prices, and are
eagerly sought after by farmers who are desirous of improving the
quality of their herd. Stud rams can also be leased from Mr. Porter
on easy terms. It might be mentioned that he bred the runner-up for cham-
pion merino ewe at the recent Show. The animal was only two years old,
and the judge remarked that he had not judged a better animal at its age.
The breeding of ponies is also carried on extensively, and a large number
were noticed grazing in his fine paddocks, where the feed was quite 3 feet
high. The Belalie creek runs right through his estate, so that it is amply
watered. Mr. Porter usually tops the local market for fat sheep, and
last year received the highest price for wool in Belalie district, viz.,
1/1 per pound. Mr. Porter is a popular and thorough farmer, possessing
an ideal sheep farm, and the writer thanks him for the courtesy in
allowing the taking of photographs for insertion in this work.

ELDER, SMITH & CO. have a well-established
and lucrative branch at Jamestown in charge of Mr. Ben
Hunt, who is probably one of the four most popular auctioneers
throughout South Australia. He is a man who has practically
lived amongst cattle, sheep, and horses all his life, and what
Mr. Hunt doesn?t know about quality and value is
infinitesimal. He is a jocular, straight-from-the-shoulder
auctioneer, and the buyers don?t need to wink or nod twice
when Ben Hunt is on the rostrum. Messrs. Elder, Smith & Co.
have much to thank their Jamestown manager for the big
turnover, for his popularity brings in much business. When
sellers or buyers meet a man they can trust thoroughly they
rarely fail to rally up to his sale, for they know it will be like
a river after heavy rain?a full one ?a good one, and a fair
interchangeable ?deal? must occur.
Sheep in great demand. As usual buyers very eager.

JAMES WILKINSON is the man-

Messrs. Bagot, Shakes & Lewis, and has
proved a highly successful one. This
firm?s business has gradually expanded,
and the gradual development is in a
great measure due to the zeal and
popularity of their local manager. Mr.
Wilkinson has occupied practically every
public position in the town, and has been
mayor for two years, president of the
Institute and Agricultural Show com-
mittees, and it is worthy of note that the
present soundness of the Jamestown
shows is in a great measure due to Mr.
Wilkinson, who, in the early days,
worked hard as Secretary to keep the
annual show in existence. He has also
been auditor and councillor for James-

hospital committee. He has been
appointed inspector of branches for
Messrs. Bagot, Shakes & Lewis. He ranks
as one of the smartest, cheeriest, and
best auctioneers in South Australia.

W. KEEEMAN started in business as a building
contractor and cabinet maker some twelve months ago,
and has made such rapid strides that he now employs several
experienced hands, and can boast of a considerable turnover.
His establishment is known as the ? Excelsior Timber Yards,?
and there all kinds of timber and building material can be
obtained at reasonable prices. Mr. Kleeman also carries on an
undertaking business, and all such engagements receive every
attention in all details. The cabinet-making work sent out
from this factory can be relied on to last far longer than much

of the South Australian factories. It is strongly recommended
to those desiring to purchase articles that will last a life-time ?
give satisfaction, and keep on giving satisfaction.

justly respected by all.
J. HASKARD started
business in Jamestown in
1888 as a plumber, tinsmith
and ironworker, and has proved
himself a successful business
man. His premises are in
Ayr Street, and there the
manufacturing of galvanised
iron tanks and the well-known
?Searchlight? Generators is
carried on. The great advan-
tage the ?Searchlight? appears
to possess over the majority is
the extreme brilliance and
clearness of the light it gene-

apparatus the gas is washed
and purified before use, and
thus the gas is brighter. A

Ayr vStreet in the busiest portion, and carries a large range of
Groceries, Drapery, Ironmongery, Crocker} T ware, etc. The
proprietress is capable, clever and courteous, and judging by
the up-to-date stock the writer noticed must be a keen buyer.
Those of the public who favor Miss Haren with their patronage
can rely on receiving good solid value at reasonable prices, and
it is pleasing to note that a business so worthy of general
support should be forging ahead gradually.

rapid strides that he practically controls the whole of the
saddlery and harness-making trade in Jamestown. His shop
is probably the largest stocked in the Northern district towns.
A great deal of repairing work is done, and the writer at the
time of his visit noticed a dozen saddles just in from Northern
stations for repairs. The large saddlery shops and factories in
Adelaide do not go in a great deal for repairing work, and thus
a country, saddler, who caters thoroughly for it, receives much
support. Three hands are in constant employment, and Mr.
Champness, who is a ?grafter? himself, has reason to feel
proud of the business, which, by sheer merit, determination and
good workmanship, has been been brought to its present solid
and prosperous condition.

MR. THOMAS AXFORD is one of the oldest-
established business men in South Australia,
having commenced business as a General Store-
keeper in Jamestown years ago. His premises
originally were of an unpretentious nature, and the
number of customers small, but as time rolled on ?
the business gradually expanded, and to-day Mr.
Axford has one of the finest General Stores in the
Northern districts. There are several departments,
each carrying a large and varied range of articles,
of high-class quality, and the prices are practically on
a par with those in Adelaide. Mr. Axford buys in large
quantities, and utilises his large store rooms at the
rear of the premises to their fullest capacity for
reserve goods. The proprietor has worked up his
present large connection by merit ?sheer merit and
strict integrity. He endeavors to satisfy his cus-
tomers in every way as far as lays in his power, and
has succeeded well. He has done much to forward

Church, and has been a local preacher for some 36
years, and a member of the Rechabite Lodge for
some 48 years. Mr. Axford is one of the old pioneers
who have helped to make South -Australia the pros-
perous State it is to-day, and richly deserves the
success he has achieved in business.

'pHE popular proprietor of The Jamestown
Hotel is Mr. W. J. Quigley, who has now
carried on the business for a number of years.
It is situate on the lower corner of Ayr Street,
and has recently been renovated in such a
thorough manner that it is evident no expense
was spared. This hotel is a decidedly com-
fortable one, possessing many parlors (private
and public), both up and down stairs. Two
separate tables are kept, and the cuisine is all
that can be desired. Travellers and visitors
are splendidly attended to, and as far as pos-
sible Mr. Quigley endeavors to make his
guests? stay a happy one. He is an unassum-
ing publican, well liked by all, and deserves
success in his business. It might be added
that sample rooms for the convenience of
?commercials? have recently been erected,
and will be appreciated by them. The wines,
spirits, etc,, can be relied on, and generally,
the Jamestown Hotel can fairly and strongly
be recommended to the public of South
Australia.

B. HERON,
Draper, Clothier, Milliner and Tailor,
AYR STREET, JAMESTOWN.
''Jj'HE finest and most hand-
some business devoted
solely to the sale of Drapery,
Clothing and Millinery in
Jamestown is that controlled
hy Mr. B. Heron. It is a
large two-storied structure,
standing in Ayr Street, and
contains two large plate-glass
windows, which enables the
proprietor to show off his up-
to-date goods in an excellent
manner. The interior is lofty
and commodious, and a large
stock of goods are there for
inspection, and, of course ?
more important still ?for sale.
Upstairs, there is a nicely-
designed Millinery Show-
room, where thousands of
articles of head-gear were
noticed. Many were extremel} 7
choice, daint}" creations. Mr.
Heron is to be complimented on enabling the ladies
of Jamestown and District to secure such up-to-date
articles, and the writer questions whether there is a

under review. Certainly,
many Adelaide drapery estab-
lishments carry larger stocks,
but do not excel in quality.
Adjoining the Millinery
Showrooms is the Dressmak-
ing Department. A dress-
maker, with a splendid repu-
tation for sound and fashion-
able work, is engaged, and the
trade is of such dimensions
that the great difficulty the
proprietor has is to secure
sufficient number of assistants.
Connected with the business
there is also a Tailoring
Department in charge of an
expert cutter. Hundreds of
suits are turned out yearly,
and the quality, finish and
price is favorably commented
on. Personally, Mr. Heron is
a quiet unassuming gentle-
man, who commands the respect of everyone both
in Jamestown and District. His trade gradually
increases, and this is a sure indication of a man?s
popularity in business.
