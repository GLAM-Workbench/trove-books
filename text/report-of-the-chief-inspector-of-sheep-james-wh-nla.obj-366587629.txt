CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SHEEP:
REPORT FOR 1879.
Laid upon the Table by the Colonial Treasurer, and ordered by the House to be
printed, August 10, 1880.




REPORT OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SHEEP.
Inspector of Sheep Office , Hohart Town , 19 th July, 1880,
Sir,
I have the honor to submit the following Report upon the working of the Scab Act during the
years 1879-80 to the 30th June.
In my Report of the 14th August, 1879, I referred to a number of wild sheep from the
Dromedary Range having mixed with and infected a flock of sheep at the Lawn Farm on the
eastern bank of the Derwent, in the month of October, 1878. In the same Report I gave a detailed
account of the steps taken to capture and destroy them. At that time about 40 had been secured,
and I was then in hopes that the whole had been caught. In this 1 was mistaken, as a considerable
number more were secured in 1879; none of those, however, proved to be infected. Altogether
about 60 wild sheep have been captured on the Dromedary Range, the cost of which, about £3O,
has been defrayed from the Scab Act Fund.
I am still of the opinion expressed in my last Report that “ other cases of a similar kind are
possible,” but certainly not so probable as at the date of that Report in July, 1879.
Twelve months having elapsed without any case of a similar kind having arisen in any part of
Tasmania and the Islands appertaining thereto, I think I may reasonably indulge in the belief that
the scab disease may now be considered extinct amongst Tasmanian sheep. Although such is my
belief, I still deem it advisable that a Proclamation of Cleanness under the Scab Act, 1879, should be
withheld for a few months longer. Perhaps in October next, when two years will have elapsed
since the last case at the Dromedary occurred, the propriety of formally declaring the flocks of
Tasmania free from disease may be considered.
Here I may also observe that, notwithstanding my conviction that the scab disease has been
eradicated, I still hold the opinion as strongly as ever that strict inspection at all public sales should
be kept up during the remainder of the current year; and as this cannot be thoroughly done with a
reduced staff of Inspectors, I hold that common prudence demands there should not be any reduc-
tion in the number of Inspectors until after the 31st December next.
The saving by the contemplated reduction will be so small in comparison with the magnitude
of the interest which the Scab Act has created, that it seems difficult to comprehend how any one
can consider it advisable to advocate what appears to me a miserable cheese-paring policy instead of
being a necessary economy.
My views on this question have been so frequently and fully before the Government, as well as
the public through the press, that it is almost unnecessary for me to further reiterate them in this
Report.
I may, however, without offence I hope to those gentlemen who differ from me in opinion on
this subject, again state my conviction that, in the face of the acknowledged annual addition of at
least a quarter of a million sterling to the material wealth of the Colony produced by the Scab Act,
the contemplated reduction of the inspecting power at my disposal is not only not demanded by the
circumstances of the case, but is a most unwise if not absolutely dangerous course of action. If
carried out, it cannot but be considered a condemnation of, if not in effect a positive censure upon,
my views and recommendations in connection with the future administration of the Scab Act. To
put the position in its truthful nakedness it seems to mean this, —that although I was right in my


views and vaticinations in 1869 when I introduced the Scab Act, and have in the main been fairly
right in administering the law to what almost every sheepowner admits to be a successful issue, I
am wrong now and extravagant in my desire to maintain the full strength of Inspectors until the
31st December of the current year. The opinions of a few outsiders, who probably never gave any
great amount of consideration to the question, pronounce authoritatively that in asking to be left with
my inspecting staff unimpaired during the present year I am asking for what is no longer necessary:
that four Inspectors are amply sufficient for the efficient working of the Department; and that my
desire to retain seven until the end of this year is a mere piece of extravagance which the unfortunate
and heavily burdened sheepowner ought not to be called upon to submit to.
I am well aware that fully nine-tenths of the sheepowners throughout Tasmania do not hold
such opinions, and do not consider the question of whether the contribution shall be a farthing or
one half-penny per head worth a moment’s consideration; but unfortunately the voices of the few
parsimonious grumblers are very loud in the ears of Governments, and are liable to overpower and
smother as it were the milder remonstrances and opinions of the majority, even when those remon-
strances and opinions are dictated by the ordinary prudential considerations of safety advocated
by the author and administrator of the Act.
I trust that a Bill will be passed during the forthcoming Session of Parliament which will
increase the farthing per head for 1881 to one half-penny.
This would provide funds sufficient to meet the amount,of deficiency for the current year, even
if the existing Staff of Inspectors is maintained until the 31st of December next, and provide for
a reduced number for 1881.
If no disease makes its appearance during the next six months, then for 1881 three or four In-
spectors will be sufficient; but on this point the Government is already in possession of my opinions
and estimates, on a reduced scale, for the ensuing year.
During the last twelve months all that portion of the Island not formerly declared clean, under
Section 10 of “ The Scab Act, 1875,” has been divided into and declared to be “ Clean Sheep
Districts.”
In Parliament, and out of it also, the contribution to the Scab Act Fund has been designated a
tax and an impost on sheepowners. In my opinion it is neither the one nor the other; and in support
of such an opinion I will quote what I stated on the subject in my last Report, with the figures
altered and brought up to the 30th of June, 1880.
I believe that the contribution of one half-penny for 1880 was opposed on the ground that it was unnecessary,
as the country might be said to be clean; and, that being so, the department ought to be reduced and, by consequence,
the impost on the people lessened. The same opinion lam aware has been expressed by a few sheepowners through-
out the country ; but I venture to say that if the most intelligent and most observant sheepowners were polled to-
morrow on that question, they would give their voice in favour of my views being carried out irrespective of any
consideration of whether the contribution should be a farthing or a half-penny per head for another year.
On the Ist question, as to the necessity of a continuance of a sufficient inspecting power for a considerable period
after the country has been declared clean, and what may constitute sufficiency, I think I may without presumption
hold the opinion that I ought to be, if I am not, the best judge.
As to the contribution under the Scab Act being a tax or impost on the people, I deny it. It is not even a tax
or impost upon sheepowners in the proper sense of the term. In the first place it was an investment of capital on
the part of sheepowners to get rid of a disease in their flocks which lessened their value and, by consequence, the
value of their properties. On this part of the question I can show that since March, 1870, up to the 30th June last,
the amount of money invested in the form of payments from the Scab Act Fund is £30,159 4s. 3d., the return from
which up to the present time may, on rational grounds, be computed at over £1,700,000. The particulars of my
calculation will be found in Paper C appended to this Report, and the Treasury accounts showing the receipts and
expenditure under the Scab Act from the Ist March, 1870, to the 30th June, 1880.
The 2nd aspect of the question is, that instead of being a tax or impost now it is, and has been for some years,
an insurance.
The lands of the Colony now produce about 12,000 bales, or over 3,000,000 lbs. more wool than they produced
before the introduction of the Scab Act. Proper care and sufficient inspection are required to maintain it. Do away
with inspection, save the contribution or premium, and it is possible enough that scab would again be introduced,
when it would run through the country like wildfire, and the same process that has been gone through before would
have to be repeated, to the infinite loss of sheepowners as well as to the public at large. In 1878 three lots of scabby
sheep arrived at Sydney from California, within four months, and, in accordance with the law in New South Wales,
were destroyed.
I shall therefore deem it my duty again to urge upon the Government that during the ensuing Session of
Parliament a Bill be introduced to reimpose the half-penny per head contribution to the Scab Act Fund during the
year 1880.
Unless this half-penny is again imposed for another year the number of Inspectors must necessarily be reduced
about one-half, which, in my opinion, may prove “ penny wise and pound foolish ” economy. Moreover, I think it
will be most unfair to myself and the department to weaken the inspecting power at the very time when it appears
to me to be so essential to maintain it.

The exportation of stud sheep in 1879 greatly exceeded that of 1878, both in number and value.
In value more than
double that of any year for the last 10 years. This may be
accounted for, in
some measure, from
the fact that in 1878 Tasmanian sheep
were, through oppressive and wholly
unnecessary regulations, virtually shut out of the Victorian market. A slight modification of the
Victorian regulations respectin
g the introduction of sheep by sea was
made in 1879, wdiich again
opened the market to Tasmanian breeders; and I think it
is probable that a further relaxation of
the present obstructive regulat
ions will be made b\
the Victorian Government when it becomes an
restrictions to the importation of Tasmanian stud sheep in all the Australian Colonies and New
Zealand. This, I think, is a consideration which has not had any weight attached to it by the
advocates of a sweeping reduction in the strength of this department.

I may remark here, that whenever any question concerning the Scab Act has come before the public or before
Parliament, it has been treated as a purely sheepowner’s question, affecting their interests alone; hence the small
interest taken in the subject by many m embers of the Legislature. Some gentlemen, representing, city constituencies,
look on passively, thinking, and in poi nt of fact saying, that they do not understand the question: “It is for the
country members to deal with it “ It is no business of theirs.”
This view of the question has always appeared to me to be a most erroneous one. I deny altogether that the
question is a mere sheepowner’s question. In my opinion it is no more a sheepowner’s question than it is a question
for every member of the community who eats mutton, or may in other ways be interested in the prosperity or other-
wise of a part of the community which contributes about half a million sterling to the exports of the Colony.
If the income of sheepowners has been increased by a quarter of a million sterling annually through the operation
of the Scab Act —which I maintain it has, and more—assuredly the general public must be interested in many ways
in the expenditure of this additional income. It is not hoarded up ; every sixpence is expended in the country. To
this source may be traced certainly not less than £15,000 to £20,000 a year of the increased Customs Revenue during
the last 6or 7 years. This is also of a permanent character; and therefore has an advantage over increased revenue
arising from mineral discoveries, which experience has demonstrated in Victoria and elsewhere may be exceedingly
S reductive for a few years, but are soon exhausted altogether or greatly reduced in extent, at least so far as alluvial
eposits are concerned.
The number of sheep returned is about the same as last year. The Table underneath shows the number of
sheep, and the quantity and value of wool exported each year, from the 30th June of one year to the Ist July of the
following, made up from Customs Returns of wool exported; and number of sheep returned to this office since 1870: —

unnecessary regulations, virtually shut out of the Victorian market. A slight modification of the
Victorian regulations respecting the introduction of sheep by sea was made in 1879, which again
opened the market to Tasmanian breeders; and I think it is probable that a further relaxation of
the present obstructive regulations will be made by the Victorian Government when it becomes an
established fact that scab no longer exists in Tasmania. I fear, however, that a premature reduction
of the number of Inspectors will have the effect of greatly retarding the removal of existing
restrictions to the importation of Tasmanian stud sheep in all the Australian Colonies and New
Zealand. This, I think, is a consideration which has not had any weight attached to it by the

The number of cattle returned in the Live Stock Statistics for the years 1873 to 1877 showed a
gradual increase, which has been continued :
During the year 1879 the export of rabbit skins was 1,027,116 valued at £7569. The number
of rabbits destroyed in 1879, according to the number of skins exported as compared with 1878, did
not quite come up to the number accounted for in 1878.
I can but reiterate what I have stated in my annual reports for some years past: The plague
instead of being stayed is steadily on the increase, and I believe will still go on increasing until it
attains dimensions which must command a more earnest attention from landowners. Many sheep-
owners I know are labouring under the delusion that rabbits are becoming less numerous, and they
arrive at this conclusion from the fact that many of the runs now carry more sheep than formerly,
notwithstanding the presence of rabbits. They overlook in a great measure the true cause of the
greater grassing capacity now of sheep-runs generally as compared with seven or eight years ago.
The increased number of sheep, notwithstanding rabbits, is solely attributable to the operation of the
Scab Act. Many more sheep are now kept by small agricultural settlers who can purchase and
fatten small lots of sheep with both safety and profit where formerly the existence of scab prevented
them. lam led to believe also that a considerable extent of rough crown land is now occupied by
sheep which could not be so occupied if sheep were not clean.
A new invention for the destruction of rabbits has recently been introduced by which they can
be smothered in their burrows by poisonous gases at a very trifling expense. A few settlers have
procured this machine, and two gentlemen, Messrs. William Kermode, of Mona Yale, and H. E.
Headlam, of Trefusis, after having tried the process have reported it as being a great success.
But even with this new and, as stated, cheap mode of destroying rabbits I have no faith in its
being generally adopted effectively by any considerable number of settlers. That is to say, one settler
will destroy the rabbits on his farm while his neighbour, who may be inert, ignorant, and prejudiced
against any “ new-fangled” invention, will persistently refuse to avail himself of the means of getting
rid of his rabbits. In short, as fast as one man destroys the pests another will breed them as is the
case at present.
Nothing, I believe, will ever accomplish a thorough destruction but a stringent compulsory law
containing powers as great if not greater than those contained in the Scab Act. Without some such
legislation it is hopeless, I believe, to expect that any mode of destroying rabbits effectively will be
generally and systematically carried out.
If all the rabbits in the Island could be destroyed, I feel assured that the export of wool in a
few years would be increased by at least 4000 bales; and as a matter of course in the same
proportion would the supply of animal food be also increased.
This may seem absurd to many of those who may read this report; but it is sober truth
notwithstanding its seeming exaggeration. Great as is the annual loss now arising from the
existence of rabbits, I believe the evil will have to become very much greater than it is at present
before public opinion will be strong enough to demand from the Legislature the passing of a coercive
law like the Scab Act, which will compel the destruction of rabbits no matter how distasteful such a
law may be to individual settlers, who would rather submit to have their properties a prey to vermin
than submit to be coerced, for their own benefit, by a law which they would denounce as tyrannical
and un-English, in the same manner as a similar class of men, and for similar reasons, denounced the
Scab Act and its author, and all who supported him, 10 years ago.
The number of sheep specially inspected by the District Inspectors from the 30th June, 1879,
to 30th June, 1880, was 772,318, and miles travelled 26,729
I again append a Return of Stock received at the Hobart Town Main Line Railway Station,
which Mr. Grant has been good enough to furnish me with.
Injustice to Inspectors, and I may say also injustice to myself, I feel constrained to reassert
that the protraction of time in accomplishing the eradication of scab has not been attributable to
either want of energy or skill on the part of Inspectors, as has been alleged by a few inconsiderate


individuals, both publicly and privately, but to the over merciful infliction of penalties in many cases
of prosecutions under the Act, particularly in Districts where scab mostly prevailed a few years ago.
I may say, as I stated before, that in very many cases the infliction of merely nominal penalties
completely neutralised the efforts of Inspectors.
A writer in a public journal has recently referred to Inspectors under the Scab Act as drones
lam desirous of keeping up unnecessarily. A grosser or more unjustifiable libel upon a class
of meritorious public officers was never penned. The records of this office clearly prove that the
amount of work performed by Inspectors during the year ought to protect them from the unworthy
charge of being drones.
I feel myself again, in the immediate view of what I consider will be a premature reduction in
their numbers, fairly called upon, in justice to them as well as to myself, to show approximately what
their labours and my own have realised to the Colony at a cost which every man of intelligence
acquainted with the facts, I think, must allow to be trifling in the extreme when compared with
results in increased export of wool, increased quantity and improved quality of animal food, increased
value of stud sheep both for export and home demand, enormously diminished cost of production ;
and, although last not least, the complete removal of that disquietude of mind and unceasing worry
and annoyance which was inseparable from the ownership of sheep infected with scab.
Appended to this Report, marked A., is a detailed Return of Sheep throughout the Municipal
and Police Districts, with the names of the owners.
Appendix B. is a revised calculation or estimate of the material advantages now annually derived
from the Scab Act, —advantages which may and most probably will be increased as time passes on,
but which in the main cannot be materially diminished in the future, no matter what fluctuations
may from time to time take place in the value of wool in the markets of the world.
Appendix C. is a continuation and revision of a calculation which I gave in my Report for
1879, showing the principal material results which may fairly be credited to the operation of the
Scab Act.
Appendix D. is a continuation of a Return which the Manager of the Main Line Railway
Company is good enough to furnish me with periodically.
Appendix E. is a continuation of Receipts and Expenditure under the Scab Act from the
Ist March, 1870, brought up to the 30th June, 1880.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
JAMES WHYTE.

APPENDIX B
REVISED ESTIMATE for 1879-80 of Annual Gain derived from the eradication of Scab.
J .
1. Increased quantity of wool, say 2,500,000 lbs., at Is. 3 d. per lb 156,250
2. Increased value of quantity (5,000,000 lbs.) produced prior to 1870, at say 3 d. per lb 62,500
3. Cost of dressing annually for tobacco, drugs, and additional in dressing under the old system
of yarding and spotting every few weeks, say as before 13.500
4. Saving of the wasted labour of 1000 men at ,£5O each 50,000
5. Increased number and value of fat sheep, say at least 20,000
6. Increase arising from export of stud sheep to neighbouring Colonies, say 12,000
£314,250
To some very probably the above may be considered an exaggerated estimate. It is not so, however.
It is moderate in every item, and is capable of proof if a number of settlers 1 could name would show me
their books with their incomes from sheep, and their expenditure now as compared with former years
anterior to the introduction of the Scab Act.
The average value of stud sheep annually exported from 1872 to 1879 inclusive amounts to £18,420.
I think two-thirds of that amount may fairly be credited to the Scab Act, as without it there would have
been no foreign market; and if that had been so, I do not think the home prices for stud sheep would
have been sufficiently encouraging to the breeders to have induced them to improve and extend their flocks
to the extent they have done during the last 10 years. Is. 3d, per lb. is not a high value, I think, to put
upon wool, taking one year with another; and as for the other items in the calculation that they are even
more moderate most intelligent and observant sheepowners will allow. Some, I am aware, will make no
such admission, and stubbornly maintain that although the Act may have done some good it has not
benefited them individually; that they cleaned their own sheep, as they dipped them themselves, &c., but
ignoring the fact that the dipping -was compulsory and, in very many cases, of the worst kind, under the
direction and often under the supervision of Inspectors or other agents employed for that purpose.
JAMES WHYTE, Chief Inspector of Sheep .
APPENDIX C.
A CALCULATION of the principal material Results which may fairly he credited to the
operation of the Scab Act.
The quantity of wool annually exported prior to the introduction of the Scab Act was, on an
average, about 5,000,000 lbs.
Ist. Quantity of wool in excess of 5,000,000 lbs.
per annum, exported during the years^
1873-4 to 1879-80 inclusive 13,284,023 lbs.
Deduct for other causes than Scab Act, say 3,321,005
9,963,018 lbs., at Is. 3d. per 1b.... 622,687
2nd. Increased value on former annual export
of 5,000,000 lbs., from 1872-3 to 1879-
80 inclusive, 8 years ; 40,000,000 lbs., at 3c?. per lb 500,000
3rd. Increased value of stud sheep exported to the neighbouring Colonies, from 1872
to 1879 inclusive, 8 years, at say £12,000 per annum 96,000
4th. Saving of labour of 1000 men, at £5O per annum for 7 years 350,000
sth. Increased quantity and value of fat sheep, since 1872 to 1879-80 inclusive,
cannot be less than 100,000
£1,668,687
Deduct expenditure under Scab Act, from Ist March, 1870, to 30th June, 1880, as
per Treasury account, Appendix 30,159
£1,638,528
To the above may fairly be added a proportionate increase in value of all pastoral and agricultural


lands used for the production of wool and fat sheep to an extent, I may very safely say, of not less than 25
per cent, on the value of property in 1870.
The other causes for which I have deducted one-fourth from the quantity of wool in excess of former
years’ exports are —improvement in the quality of some flocks in the Colony, principally in the North; an
increase in the number and quality of long-woolled sheep; and an increase in the number of sheep shorn
in the grease.
The two first items are the only ones to which any weight can be attached, and much more to the first
than the second. To the third I attach little or no importance. The fact is that a very large quantity of
wool is passed through the Custom House only by the number of bales, without the exact weights; in such
cases the weight is assumed to be 300 lbs. per bale.
Formerly the number of bales of wool shipped varied from 15,000 to 16,000 and 17,000, or about an
average of not more than 16,000 bales. In 1878-9 Customs Returns now before me show that 28,023 bales
were shipped. lam therefore of opinion that for other causes I have deducted about 2,000,000 lbs. too
much from No. 1 item.
On the third item, increased value of stud sheep exported, I might have placed ,£20,000 or £30,000
more.
My returns of value are from the Custom House, and I know that, all round, exported stud sheep
have realised much more than the value they were passed at through the Custom House. This is not the
fault of the Customs officers, but the fault of the shipper, who sends his sheep to town sometimes without
any instructions to his agent as to value; and, consequently, sheep that may sell in New Zealand or
elsewhere at from £2O to £l5O are put down by the agent at £5, £lO, or £2O, as the case may be.
No. 4 item, the saving of labour formerly absolutely necessary on account of scab, is, I believe,
considerably under-estimated.
No. 5 item is a very moderate calculation, if it is taken into account that fat sheep now slaughtered
average from 8 to 12 lbs. more per head than they did in 1870, and the meat is wholesome instead of being
diseased.
