PREFACE.
It has long been a subject of complaint among the
Common School teachers, the public, and the officers
of the Board of Education, that Local Committees take
little or no interest in the schools nominally under
their superintendence. I have been at some pains to
discover the cause of this apathy; and I have ascer-
tained that it arises in a great measure from the fact,
that Local Committees are not aware of the nature of
their powers or duties, or how those duties are to he
performed. It is my object in the following pages to
explain the powers and duties of Local Committees,
under the Common School Act, and to suggest a uni-
form method of carrying them out. The advice I offer
is the result of experience. It is not authoritative,
and, possibly, some of my readers may differ from me
in the interpretation I have placed upon some of the
rules of the Board of Education affecting Local Com-
mittees. I trust, however, that the work may prove
useful to those for whom it is principally intended.

POWEES AND DUTIES
LOCAL COMMITTEES.
Local Committees owe their origin to the Common
Schools \ct, No. CXLIX., which was passed upon the
18th June, 1862. By this Act, sections XIV. and
XVIII., it is provided that: ?
XIY. No school shall receive aid from the consolidated revenue
unless it be under th ; manage uent of a local committee ot not less
than fiv i per ons who shall be pproved of by the Board of Educa-
tion and whose names shall be published in the Government Gazette
and also in some local newspaper if any ? Provide l that no teacher
shall be appointed to or dismissed from such school whose q alifica-
tions shall not be approved of or dismissal sanctioned by the Board
of Education.
XVIII. It shall be lawful for the Board of Education from time to
time to app >int and remove loc 1 committees and to establish schools
in such localities as the Bo rd shall deem fit subject to the provisions
of this Act Prov ded th it no local committee shall be removed with-
out he consent of the Governor-in-Council Provided also that
where a local committee shal have been appointed for any school
previo sly to the commencement of this Act the same committee
shall until removed in manner aforesaid continue and be the com-
mittee of the said school under this Act Pro vided further that one
mo ith's notice shall be given in the Government Gazette of the inten-
tion of the Board to appoint or to remove any local committee.
The above are the only two clauses referring to the


appointment, powers, and duties of Local Committees
under the Common Schools Act; but, by clause VI.,
the Board of Education is empowered to make such
rules and regulations as are requisite for carrying out
the provisions of the Act, and clause YIIL provides
that all regulations made by the Board of Education,
approved by the Governor-in-Council, and duly pub-
lished in the Government Gazette, shall have the force
of law, and therefore, any legally formed rule of the
Board has as much force as though it were part of the
Common Schools Act itself, as passed by Parliament.
The rules affecting Local Committees, as set forth
in the General Rules and Regulations of the Board of
Education, are as follows :
VI.?MISCELLANEOUS.
Local Committees.
(70) The Board will receive nominations of members for Local
Committees for approval or appointment.
(71) The approval or appointment of Local Committees of Com-
mon Schools rests with the Board, who have the power, with the
consent of the Governor-in-Conncil, of removing such Committees.
(72) One month?s notice of the intention of the Board to appoint
or remove Local Committees or members thereof will he given
in the Government Gazette, and all appointments of Local Committees
or of members thereof will also be notified in the Government Gazette.
(73) A Local Committee must consist of not less than five mem-
bers, of whom the Correspondent must be one.
(74) The Correspondent is the organ of the Local Committee, and
must be appointed by them. He has not the power of taking inde-
pendent action in any matter connected with the school, but must
communicate with the Board in the name and on behalf of the Com-
mittee.
(75) The duties of the Local Committees will be: ?
a. To appoint the necessary number of teachers, enter into
agreements with them, and remove them when requisite,
subject to the provisions of the Act and of these regulations.


b. To recommend to the Board the proportion in which the
allowances made by them to schools shall be distributed be-
tween the head teacher and his assistants, if any.
c. To regulate, subject to the rules above laid down, the rate of
school fees for children attending their school, to make
arrangements for their collection, and to decide what pro-
portion of them should be paid to the head teacher and
assistants respectively in such school, and what proportion
should be applied to other school purposes ; such scheme of
distribution to be approved by the Board.
d. To keep full and correct accounts of the total receipts and ex-
penditure of their school, to be produced when required by
an Inspector of the Board.
e. To visit the school at short intervals, and record upon the
school rolls the results of their visits, together with the
number of children found present at the time of visiting.
/. To hold periodical examinations of the children, and make
returns of children of destitute parents, orphans, &c., after
having satisfied themselves that such children are fit objects
of bounty.
It is my intention to review these rules seriatim,
with a view to suggesting a certain amount of uni-
formity in their observance.
When the Board of Education came into existence*
it at once sanctioned the appointment of all com-
mittees then in being. Under the late National Board,
Local Patrons occupied the position now taken up by
Local Committees, but their powers were never so
extensive as those exercised by the latter named
bodies.
It will be seen that by the rules of the Board there
is no definite method of bringing a Committee into
existence. No constituency is provided to elect the
members. ? The Board will receive nominations it
does not specify by whom, or from whom. So that,
in point of fact, a clergyman may nominate a Com-
mittee of his own choosing; or a few individuals may
meet together and nominate themselves ; or a meeting


of the inhabitants may be called to elect a Committee,
or a meeting of parents, or a meeting of subscribers
to the school building.
The best plan that can be adopted in selecting a
Committee, is to elect the members from a publicly
convened meeting of the parents, whose children are to
attend, or are attending the school, and the subscribers
to the school funds, whether for building or otherwise.
This at all events is a reasonable constituency, which
may be safely relied upon to elect the most eligible
men in the district. Those elected should always be
either resident near the school, or in the habit of being
near it frequently.
In case of a vacancy in an existing Local Committee,
the usual plan pursued at present is for the remaining
members to nominate a new member; but while this
method of procedure is, no doubt, quick and con-
venient, it does not seem to be so satisfactory a plan
as that of going back for a new member to the original
constituency ?a course which suggests itself as the
fairest, and least likely to engender local misunder-
standings or jealousies.
Care should be taken, in case of vested schools, that
no preponderance in numbers be given to the members
of any religious denomination ; and experience has
proved that it is unwise to allow any clergyman a seat
upon the Committee of a vested school. If a clergyman
be upon the Committee, many parents, however much
3 r ou protest the contrary, will believe that the church
of which such clergyman is a member, has an undue
influence in the management; and that the school, in
consequence, is more or less denominational in its
character.
In vested schools it is desirable to exclude from the
daily routine of school exercises, all prayers, the Bible in


any form or version, and all religious teaching, and to
confine the instruction to purely secular subjects. By
this course alone can you satisfy parents that attempts
at proselytism will not, and cannot be made.
Rules 71 and 72 require no comment.
(73) ?A Local Committee must consist of not less
than five members, of whom the correspondent must
be one/?
In electing a Correspondent, care should be taken
that he is capable of conducting the necessary cor-
respondence, that he resides near the school, or, at all
events, can conveniently visit it, if requisite, at short
intervals. The Correspondent, more than any other
member of Committee, is bound to visit the school
occasionally, if only for the purpose of checking the
returns, in the general and apparent accuracy of which
he concurs by signing them. If a Committee find that
a Correspondent is unfit, either from character or
incapacity, to be entrusted with the duties devolving
upon him, they have full power to remove him, and
appoint a new one from among themselves, with the
sanction of the Board.
In some Committees an agreement is made that
each member of Committee shall in turn be Corres-
pondent for one year. This has been found to work
satisfactorily, but would in some districts be found
inconvenient. Another plan, with a view to aiding the
Correspondent, is to appoint a member of Committee
for each month, whose duty it is to visit the school
once a week. In other committees, where the number
of members is large, it is sometimes the practice to
have a Chairman of Committee, and also a Corre-
spondent, but this is hardly advisable. The better
course is to appoint a gentleman in whom the Com-


mittee and the parents have confidence, and let him
be Chairman, Treasurer (if need be), and Cor-
respondent.
When the Correspondent has been elected, it is
well to fix the number of members of Committee who
shall constitute a quorum, the days of meeting (and a
Committee should meet about once a month), and to
provide for conducting all business in a proper manner,
by resolution duly moved and seconded, and entered
in a minute-book. After each meeting, the minutes
should be read over, confirmed, and signed by the
Chairman.
Rule 73 provides that a Committee shall consist of
not less than five. In thickly populated places seven
is a good number to select, allowing four to constitute
a quorum. Large Committees as a rule, however, do
not work as well and harmoniously as smaller ones.
Rule 74, viz., ? The Correspondent is the organ of
the Local Committee, and must be appointed by them.
He has not the power of taking independent action in
any matter connected with the school, but must com-
municate with the Board in the name and on behalf of
the Committee,? speaks for itself.. If a Correspondent
act without the authority of the Committee, or contrary
to its wishes, the members of Committee can remove
him and appoint any other member in his place.
Notice of such a change should be communicated to
the Board as early as possible, together with a copy
of the resolution, or resolutions by which the change
was ordered, and a statement of the reasons which
actuated the Committee in making it.
We now come to the consideration of the duties of
Local Committees. One of the first and most im-
portant duties entrusted to them is the appointment
and dismissal of teachers ?subject to the sanction of


the Board of Education. In appointing a teacher, the
Local Committee has something more to consider than
the quality of his testimonials. They should satisfy
themselves in regard to his or her private character;
and they should have some degree of assurance that
the teacher, if appointed, will remain with them; for
it is a fact that there are a number of teachers in the
Common Schools who are continually applying for
almost every vacancy advertised, and who have no idea
of remaining in a place longer than their whim lasts,
or their caprice dictates. Frequent changes are always
prejudicial to the interests of schools, and retard the
progress of pupils; and Local Committees should
therefore prefer a candidate with a low certificate who
would pledge himself to remain for a reasonable
period, to one with a higher certificate, but whose rest-
less disposition is such as requires constant change.
When a Local Committee is about to appoint a
teacher, the best course is to advertise in the Melbourne
newspapers. When the applications are received, it
would be well to send a list of the names of the appli-
cants to the Inspector of the district in which the
school is situated. He will be in a position to give
the Committee much valuable information, and could
mark against the name of each candidate a short ac-
count of what is known of him officially. An Inspector
could not be expected to take upon himself the
responsibility of recommending any individual teacher,
but he could have no objection to aid the Local Com-
mittee in the manner indicated.
A married couple, even where one of them is uncer-
tificated, is always to be preferred to two single
teachers, where male and female are employed.
In advertising for teachers, it is advisable rather to
understate the income and accommodation afforded


than to pursue the objectionable plan, so frequently
resorted to, of overestimating the school average and
receipts to such an extent as to cause a disappointment
and resentment in the mind of a teacher, which no
act upon the part of the Committee can afterwards
efface.
Recollect that, in dealing with teachers, you must
be extremely plain and explicit, for they are the most
? crotchety? class in the community. I do not use
this term in an objectionable sense, but I affirm that
any individual who is daily accustomed to perform an
irksome task like teaching?who is continually ex-
posed to trials of temper, and who, from morning till
night, rules with despotic sway and unquestioned
authority, gradually developes an imperious and dog-
matic character, which can ill brook restraint of any
kind, and much less imposition, such as has been
alluded to above.
When you have appointed your teacher, and you
have satisfied yourselves that he is fit for the perfor-
mance of his duties, the less you interfere with him
in the internal management of the school the better.
The ? agreement,? a printed form of which the Com-
mittee can procure from the Board, on applying for
it, is the next point for consideration. In this agree-
ment the Committee should make arrangements for
the payment by the teacher of a small per centage
upon the fees, for the purpose of defraying the neces-
sary expenses connected with the proper conduct of
the school. There are two ways of doing this, and it
is often advantageous to both parties to give the
teacher the choice of methods.
First, the teacher may agree to defray all necessary
school expenses, and to keep the building in tenantable


repair; in which case the only deduction would be
about one per cent, on the fees for postage, etc.; or
the teacher can furnish the Committee with an esti-
mate of what the cost of cleaning, and keeping the
building in tenantable repair will amount to, and then
the Committee can deduct that sum from the fees to
the extent required?say five or ten per cent. The
Committee, by this contract, become responsible to the
teacher for the due performance of the duty undertaken,
and they are required to keep accounts (for inspection)
of the expenditure of the money thus taken.
Where school buildings are used for church pur-
poses on Sundays, some proportion of the cost of
cleaning, and of wear and tear of furniture, should be
borne by those using the building.
When it becomes necessary to dispense with the
services of a teacher, the Local Committee is bound
to give him a month?s notice of such discontinuance
of his services. In cases of gross immorality or open
insubordination, or where the interests of the school
suffer materially from the presence of the teacher, the
Committee has power to suspend him from the per-
formance of his duties at once, but the month?s notice
cannot in any case be dispensed with.
When a teacher is served with notice of dismissal, it
is necessary that the reasons for such a course should
be fully and distinctly stated, in order that he may, if
he choose, appeal against the action of the Committee.
A copy of the notice sent to the teacher, together with
the reasons assigned for dismissal, must also be sent
to the Board of Education at the same time, as no
teacher can be dismissed without the sanction of the
Board; and unless the Board has the facts before it
on which the dismissal is grounded, it cannot consider
the case.


Unless for gross immorality or other grave offence,
a Committee should allow a teacher the opportunity of
resigning. Dismissal will probably prevent his being
employed elsewhere, and it is the most severe punish-
ment a Committee can inflict. It should, therefore, be
resorted to only in extreme cases.
Immorality, habitual drunkenness, scandalous public
behaviour, or repeated and habitual want of punc-
tuality in opening or conducting school, or persistent
disobedience of the reasonable orders of the Com-
mittee, are grounds for dismissal.
A variety of less grave offences would warrant the
Committee in demanding the resignation of a teacher.
For example, if a teacher had failed for any length of
time to procure a certificate, and the parents were dis -
satisfied with the progress of their children, and the
school were reported officially as ill-conducted.
All cases of appointment, dismissal, or resignations
of teachers, should be communicated to the Board as
early as possible after they are settled by the Com-
mittee.
It is the duty of the Committee to regulate the scale
of fees to be charged in the school under its superin-
tendence. The teacher should be consulted in this
matter before a decision is arrived at. Some teachers
prefer charging different fees for the different classes,
and others prefer a uniform fee throughout for all
classes above the infants. This latter is undoubtedly
the better and simpler course, the rate being 6d. a
week for each infant, i.e., a child under eight years of
age, and Is. per week for every child above that age,
no matter how many come from the same family. The
Committee has of course to regulate the fee to the
pecuniary condition of the parents who avail them-


selves of the school, but it must be borne in mind also
that the teacher must derive such an income from the
school as will insure his living respectably, or he will
not remain in the profession. On goldfields and in
places where the cost of living is more than ordinarily
expensive, the fees must be raised in proportion, say
to Is. 6d. or even to 2s. per week. To stint the teacher
in his fee is to practise a false economy, that will end
in the children?s loss.
The Committee should also bear in mind the provi-
sions of Rule 7, viz., that in no case will the Board of
Education grant more than �2 for every �1 locally
raised, either by fees or local contributions.
Besides regulating the scale of fees, the Local Com-
mittee Ims to apportion the amount so received, and
also the other allowances made by the Board, among the
teachers, where more than one is employed. Its duties
in this respect have been simplified of late by the issue
of a circular, of which the following is an extract: ?
(8.) ?The moneys available for the maintenance of Common
Schools are derived from the following sources:?
The salaries and augmentation (if any) paid to head teachers,
and the fixed salaries paid to assistants, work-mistresses, and
pupil-teachers.
h. The amounts paid under rule 16 for results.
c. The school fees paid by the parents and guardians of children.
d. The local contributions raised towards the augmentation of
the incomes of the teachers, assistants, work-mistresses, and
pupil-teachers.
(4) On the 21st March, 1866, the Board issued a circular, N0.66 | 2,
suggesting a certain mode of distribution, but stating that, as special
circumstances might require different arrangements, they would
not require that that mode of distribution should necessarily be
uniform.


(5) But the Board regret to find that in several schools their recom-
mendation has not been carried into effect, and that in many cases
head teachers are receiving an undue proportion of the school income,
and local committees are reserving, for geneial school purposes, large
sums, which are appropriated for payment of rent, interest on outlay
upon buildings, and other objects which do not form fair charges upon
the income of the school.
(6) By the term ? other school purposes,? used in Rule 75 (c), the
Board understand such expenditure as may be necessary for keeping
the school building in suitable repair, providing fuel, gratuitous
supplies of books, &c. (if any), sweeping and cleaning, and other
current expenses required for the actual management of the school.
(7) The Board have accordingly decided that, from and after the
80th June next, they will not approve of any scheme of distribution
of results, fees, and local contributions, unless the following require-
ments be complied with:?
In schools where one assistant only'is employed, the head
teacher shall not receive more than 75 per cent.
b. In schools where two cr more assistants are employed, the
head teacher shall not receive more than 60 per cent.
c. That the reservation from fees and local contributions shall be
strictly confined to the purposes specified in paragraph 6,
such percentage to be a first charge upon the gross amount
of fees, and to be stated in clause 3 of every agreement as
thus, ? less per cent, of the fees and
local contributions reserved by the Local Committee for other
school purposes.?
(8) All schemes of distribution of school income, therefore, which
have already received the sanction of the Board, but which do not
comply with these requirements, must be considered as terminating
on the 30th June next, and fresh schemes of distribution must be
made, and new agreements entered into on or before that date.
(9) All new agreements which may be entered into from this time
must be made in accordance with the above requirements, and no
new appointments of teachers or assistants will be approved by the
Board, unless agreements in accordance with this circular be for-
warded to this office.
From this it will be seen that as a general rule,
where a master or mistress with only one assistant is
employed, the head teacher should receive two-thirds


and the assistant one-third of the fees and allowances
other than salary; and where more assistants are em-
ployed than one, then the head teacher should receive
not less than one half of the fee and the allowances,
the remainder being divided among the assistants in
equal, or slightly varying proportions.
Whatever proportions the Committee determines
upon must be embodied in the agreements between
the several teachers and itself.
It is the duty of the Committee, as stated above, to
keep full and correct accounts of all receipts and ex-
penditure of the per centage levied, and this account
is separate from the accounts kept by the teacher. He
simply shews in his accounts that he has paid over a
certain sum to the Committee, but he cannot know in
what way the sum is expended by the Committee.
The next duty which devolves upon the members of
Committee is, ? to visit the school at intervals, and
record upon the school rolls the results ol their visits,
together with the number of children found present at
the time of visiting.?
It is the fashion among Committeemen, as a rule, to
write something complimentary at every visit, as an
apology to the teacher, apparently for the intrusion
into his domain. I allude to such entries all
right,? ?all correct,? ?everything satisfactory,? &c.,
&c. Now these, if we consider their meaning for a
single moment, are obviously improper How
can any one after a casual visit say that all is right,
or ? all? ? correct,? &c., when it takes an experienced
officer several hours to arrive at any such conclusion?
Committeemen can state the number present, and they
can tell whether the several classes are kept employed or
left idle; whether the room and the pupils are clean


and tidy; and whether there is order and silence. To
these points then, at casual visits, they should confine
their entries, and above all, try to write the few words
required with correct spelling.
The Committee is instructed, by rule 75/, ? to hold
periodical examinations of the children.? To do this
properly, requires some skill and experience. In order
to shew the style of question which may be asked in
each class, I have in an Appendix compiled a few ques-
tions, which will suggest others of a similar character.
The Committee will, as a rule, find it best to suggest to
the teacher the nature of the examination, i or question
they wish put, and allow the teacher to place it before
the pupils in his own way.
The last duty of the Committee is to guard against
imposition in the matter of ? free children.? Before
a ? certificate? of destitution is given, the Committee
should be satisfied that the case is a hona fide one; for
there cannot be a doubt that at the present moment
the Board of Education is paying for the education of
pupils, whose parents are neither in want, nor even in
straitened circumstances. The bounty of the State, in
the matter of gratuitous education for the children of
destitute parents, has indeed been so severely abused,
that the question of its withdrawal will inevitably be
the result, unless more care is taken by the Local
Committees, clergymen, and magistrates, in issuing the
certificates.


OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW
SCHOOLS.
When it is desirable to establish a new school in a
locality where no other school exists, the mode of pro-
cedure is much more simple than is generally sup-
posed.
In the first place, a meeting of the residents should
be held, and a Committee appointed to carry out the
undertaking. One member of the Committee should
be selected to carry on the necessary correspondence
with the Board of Education. This gentleman should
write to the Secretary of the Board, informing him of
the steps taken, and the desire of the people to have a
school, ?vested? or ? non-vested,? as may have been
determined upon. On receipt of this the Secretary of
the Board will furnish the Correspondent with a few
official forms, which have to be filled up and returned.
These forms embrace a list of the parents who un-
dertake to send their children to the proposed school,
with the names and ages of the proposed scholars ;
also particulars relative to the proposed site and school
building, etc.
The documents are then referred to the Inspector
of the district for report. Here there may, and pro-
bably will be, some delay, for the inspector must visit
the locality before reporting, and this he can only do
on his half-yearly tours; but this delay need not at
all postpone the action of the Committee. If the
school is to be non-vested the building can be erected


on any of the plans sanctioned by the Board (which
can be obtained on application to the Secretarj"); a
teacher can be appointed, and the school opened.
Eecords of the daily attendance should be duly kept,
for the school must be iu operation for six mouths,
and show an average daily attendance of at least
twenty before it can be entitled to aid. This is re-
quired by the following clause of the Common Schools
Act:
IX. No school unless for the deaf and dumb and blind shall receive
aid from the consolidated revenue unless there shall have been during
the preceding six m mths n such school an average daily attendance
of not less than twenty pupils.
The Board of Education, can, however, when they
grant aid, frequently pay salary for this probationary
period, so that the teacher or committee can lose
nothing by beginning at once.
If the Committee desires to establish a ?vested?
school, however, the matter is otherwise, and it is
better to await the arrival of the Inspector and the
decision of the Board, before commencing the building.
This need not, however, prevent the opening of the
school. This can be done in a hired house, and is at
once a token of the earnestness of the Committee, and
a great saving of time as regards the six months above
referred to.
In cases of non-vested schools, the Board of Edu-
cation give no aid whatever towards the building, and
the people can use the school for religious or other
purposes.
In the case of a vested school the Board, as a rule,


gives aid to the extent of one-half of the cost of the
building (Rule 42), but the school cannot be used for
public worship or political purposes.
INDISPENSABLE SCHOOL APPARATUS.
1. A sufficiency of desks and forms graduated to
the size of the pupils.
2. A clock and a bell.
3. One large blackboard, and one small one, with a
supply of chalk.
4. Maps of the ?World,? ?Europe,? ?Asia/
?Africa,? ?America,? ?Australia,? and ?Vic-
toria.?
6. Books, slates, and reading tablets.
6. A sufficient number of pegs for caps, etc., con-
veniently arranged.
