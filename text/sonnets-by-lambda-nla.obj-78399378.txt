THE SORROWS OF FLOWERS.
Thoughtless is he who plucks the scented bud
Without a qualm and daisy eyes loves not
Nor homage pays the queenly rose whose good
Is basis of her charms, as though begot
For vestal virgin?s birth and sacrifice.
Fair Natures smiles oft bring a wild despair ;
A fierce desire to seek her arms of bliss. ?
To God?s pure flowers be kind; their trials share;
Their sickness tend; assuage each born defect.
Thin is the zoophyte-link ?tween animal
And plant, though haply puzzling to detect.
Yet traced in waters low and mystical.
All earthly bloom peruse and magnify;
Yea ponder there thine own mortality.
LAMBDA.
To my friend, W. T. Gill, Esq.,
who suggested this theme.
14/3/08,




NOTHING.
Can aught be shown where Nothing has a place ?
No, no. In all the realms there is no void
But what is filled with Power that flung in space
The stars and made each in its course employed.
You show a vacant cup, but lo! ?tis full;
You see naught hence say, ? Here is nothingness! ?
Yet every chink is stored with fixed rule
By Him who planned to leave no emptiness.
Could crypt be found from broken laws to hide
Where Nemesis keen-eyed would fail to trace
The steps of those who wrong such as confide.
And pray not, neither restitution face.
How gladly would the dying wrongers past
Have sought such cave to sleep whilst aeons last.
LAMBDA.




HAD SATAN TRIUMPHED.
Of awful and eternal moment ?twas
When Satan forty days did tempt the Lord.
For had Christ?s foe the victor been, just as
He was o?er Adam, ?dread thought!?God?s given word
Had failed. No spotless Lamb for sacrifice!
In vain the Jewish ? look ;? the Gentile f hope
The saints would then have wept in Paradise
To see mankind in deadly chaos grope.
Is not the Aftermath the same old cheat
In false enticements wrapt ? Applause, desire
For superabundant wealth, power, all at feet
Of idols laid with senses base on fire.
Resist the Tempter! Then from thee he?ll fly :
The Lord?s example take how fight and die.
LAMBDA.

DEATH.-WHY SHUN THAT NAME?
Man prides him on his freedom, yet lives he
A prisoner. In darkness such am I
That even the light of day doth hide from me
The scintillating stars above the sky.
But ?tis our part 'neath discipline to stay
Till Death shall turn aside the veil where glance
The shining splendours all for them who pray.?
Why shun that name ? ?Tis but a circumstance,
Personified idea, a thing unknown.
Unfelt, where travellers welcomed are by name
Or holden in suspense for misdeeds done.
Sweet is the thought that Death brings no dread claim,
It merely waits to show the simple life
Where it may find a home unknown to strife.
LAMBDA.

PERSONALITY.
Behold the silent stars speeding in their course
Wielding their mighty influence far and near :
Thus man draws to himself, or the converse.
Those who impinge his subtile atmosphere.
Be not deceived, man?s secret ways are known;
His tell-tale aura publishes to all
His life. Thy soul into thy neighbour?s own
Can see as clear as sunbeams on the wall;
Yea, more, ?can view the motive ?neath the act
And read what makes for good or ill; can feel
The truth hid in the touch, the smile, the fact,
The word, as well the effort to conceal.
Man dies like to the star that breathes its last;
Yet both down ages send their records past.
LAMBDA

PERSONALITY.
Thy sovran spirit is native of the skies;
Of distance making naught: is messenger
With anxious mien, averted face, or hies
Upon its cheery quest as comforter.
Nor is this strange. Secrets deep their thoughts impart;
Approaching steps are felt; the penman oft
By means unknown precedes his anxious heart.
?Tis well perceivings such are left unseoff?t.
The humble hear God?s voice and He doth theirs.
Great is the soul, but spirits greater wing
Their flights past all confines.* When human cares
Are over, spirits disrobed must face the King,
Of soulful sweets of sense those are the best
That give to heaven first place within the breast.
LAMBDA.
An expression of belief founded on the Pauline doctrine of spirit,
soul, and body (i Thess. v. 23). John Wesley says, ? Ofthe three,
only the last two are the natural constituents of man,?

PERSONALITY.
O soul, thine are the joys and tears of time.
Great are thy powers to do the right or not
Whilst treading tempting ways or paths sublime
Attended by thy spirit from heaven begot.
The constant?friend thou venturest to control.
An earthly form doth hinder thee ; tis plain.
As burdens snail with shell, as spirit with soul.
O warring three that meet in wilful man!
The voicings of the soul are like the lap
Lap on the shore or raging wave that showers
On rocks. Within its arms it would enwrap
The world and eat its pleasured fruit and flowers.
Until a voice shall say on life?s last strand.
? Farewell, O soul, I haste my natal land/
LAMBDA.




PERSONALITY.
Thy Personality is like a boat
That sails the seas and finds it hard to face
The storm or answer give the helm or note
The treacherous whirlpool circling to embrace.
Great is thy share of lives once wrecked and torn
In port or mid the stormy ocean?s din:
And how unlike to heaven?s created form
Is that in which thou art now voyaging in !
And thus and thus thy soul perplext sails on
Life?s seas and heavy lade with parts effete
Once used and oft again in ages gone ;
Those parts perverse still live to face defeat.
In heaven alone there?s found the prime support
And grace to steer thy homeward barque to port.
LAMBDA.

WHO IN THAT THRONG WOULD SHINE.
When damaged past repair and tenancy
Is man?s frail tabernacle, he this sphere
Must leave and take the Journey far?the sky
Way free to him. A broken voice draws near
? Show me the better path.? Response I make
? 'Tis that which leads to Paradise where vast
And endless joys the much-forgiven partake;
Among them Magdalen, her errors past
Erased ; the prodigal, the libertine,
The common reprobate, the moral blind, ?
Throne worthy made. Who in that throng would shine
Must as a sinner be to sinners kind.?
How sweet the Calvary love of Christ, the Way ;
To seeker vile He never says him nay.
LAMBDA.




THE COMING YEAR.
Thus to a Soul its Spirit? What wouldest thou ? ?
More wealth. ? Then give of thine to those in want.
Honours. ? Let chaplet grace another brow ;
On palace favours look with eyes askant.
Long years. ? Offer thy life for sacrifice;
Then dying thou shalt hear the well-done call
Real joy. ?ln sorrow?s abyss find Paradise ;
Behold in such ways lived the Lord of All.?
Still speaks that mystic sleepless voice within
? Material is but semblance of the real;
Man?s Spirit can only be with Spirit akin
Howe?er the fleshy veil may it conceal.
O that all men obeyed the Voioe sincere,
Then would the coming be a happy year.
LAMBDA.

HEREDITY.
Shall thine unborn be a mere circumstance
With former vices linked to virtues few ?
Or wouldst thou give thy little one a chance
To lead a pure white life, be manly true ?
Then grant this heaven-kist theme ?it leads the van ?
Consideration meet, at least as would
The builder to his plans, the business-man
His facts; or mariner the compass should.
Let goodly gifts enrich thy heart, O wife.
So thou mayst share with him to come,
Who will, perchance, give readily his life
To raise the altar, sanctify the home.
Then seraphs shall voice, like tidal waves, their songs,
Echoed a soft resurge by far-off throngs.
LAMBDA.




SUNSHINE AND SHADE.
Happy is he who welcomes shadows cast
On pleasure?s path ; who hears the minor plaint
In music?s laughter hid; who feels no blast
Of sin?s hot breath on memory clear or faint.
The Lord?s good care of him such sendings prove.
And certain ?tis as Adam?s blighted morn,
As lurks the night in day, as twin-birth love
And hate, as life that?s dying soon as born.
Naught strange is this. Do not the trees, bees, birds, beasts.
The rivulet, the sounding waves that leap
Upon the shore, all tell of ending feasts
And of a coming time too late to weep ?
O let unworthy thought be sacrificed.
Then shall thy cares be unmatei'ialised.
LAMBDA.
