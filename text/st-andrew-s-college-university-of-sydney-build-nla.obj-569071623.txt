BUILDING FUND APPEAL.

T. ANDREW’S COLLEGE was established in accordance with its Incorporation
Act (assented to 12th December, 1867), to afford to Presbyterian and other Students residence
and *domestic supervision, with systematic religious instruction, and efficient tutorial assistance
in their preparation for the University lectures and examinations. Under the Colleges’ Endowment
• Act, 18 Victoria, No. 37, the Government of New South Wales gives an endowment of
to each College for building purposes, provided a like amount is subscribed towards its Building Fund
by the public. At the present time there is still a sum of unapplied for, and it is to be in a
position to apply for this sum that the Principal and Councillors of St. Andrew’s College now
make this appeal.


In the Principal’s Report, bearing date 15th April, 1891, occurs the following passage : —“There are
at present connected with the College 32 Students, 28 being resident. In order to admit the entrance of so
many the Reading-room and Tower-room have been converted into Students’ rooms ; such an arrangement can
only be of a temporary character, and has been adopted this year that Students might not be refused admission.”
From this it is evident that if St. Andrew’s College is to maintain its proper position as an affiliated College of the
University of Sydney, additional accommodation must be provided for the larger number of Students
applying for admission. It is also the earnest desire of the Council to erect additional class-rooms, so as,
amongst other things, to enable the Professors or Tutors in Theology in connection with the Presbyterian
Church of New South Wales to deliver their lectures at such hours as shall be convenient to them, the
Incorporation Act making express provision that “ Students after taking their degrees at the University may
continue in the College for a period not exceeding four years, for the purpose of prosecuting such branches of
learning as may not be taught in the University.”
As it is several years since an appeal of this kind was made to the subscribers and friends of the College,
the Council trusts the response will be both prompt and liberal, the circumstances being urgent. Where donors
prefer that their subscriptions should be payable by instalments extending over one, two, three, or four years, it
will be esteemed a favour if promissory notes can be given, so as to enable the Council to obtain the immediate
use of the money so represented. It is confidently believed that the sum now asked with the proportionate
Government Endowment, together will put the Council in a position to supply the additional
accommodation contemplated.
With the exception of a year from the Government towards the salary of the Principal, the
College is self-supporting, the only private endowments at present being for scholarships and prizes. It is
thought well to mention these facts so as to obviate possible misconception on the subject.
As a considerable number of the students, past and present, have come to us from Queensland —and
none are more welcome —the Council hopes residents of that Colony will kindly consider this appeal as addressed
to them as well as to the inhabitants of New South Wales.
Subscriptions may be forwarded to the Principal, or to any of the Councillors, or to the Secretary and
Treasurer, Mr. James Anderson, 97 Pitt Street, Sydney.
