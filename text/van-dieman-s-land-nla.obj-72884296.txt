�m yflD pleafures and palaces though we
EVA may roam.
Be it ever fo humble, there?s no place like
home ;
A charm from the {kies feems to hallow us
there,
Which, feek through the world, is ne?er met
with elfewhere.
Home ! Home! fweet, fweet Home !
There?s no place like Home ! there?s no place
like Home.
The poor failor-boy, as o?er billows he
roam.
Oft fighs for the cot he has left far at Home,
And the fweet village bells, fo pleafant and
gay,
And the lafs that he loves, who is far, far
away.
An exile from Home, fplendour dazzles in
vain,
Oh,give me my lovely thatch?d cottage again;
The birds Tinging gaily that came at my
call,
Give me them with the peace of mind dearer
than all.

pOME all you gallant poachers, that ramble void o
care,
That walk out on a moonlight night, with your dog, gun,
and a snare;
The hare and lofty pheasant you have at your
Not thinking of'your last career upon Van Dieman s
1 and.
Poor Thomas Brown, horn Nottingham, Jack Williams,
and poor Joe, [doth know ;
Were three determin?d poachers, as the country well
At night they were trepann?d, by the keepers hid in sand,
And �for fourteen years transported were upon Van
Dieman?s Land.
The first day that we landed upon the fatal shore,
The planters came around us?there might be 20 score �
They rank?d us up like horses, and sold us our ot hand,
They yok?d us to their ploughs, my boys, to plough
Van Dieman?s Land.
Our cottages we live in are built of clods of clay,
And rotten straw for bedding, yet we dare not say nay :
Around our cots a circling fire?we slumber when we can.
And drive the wolves and tigers oft upon Van Dieman s
Land.
Oftf.mes when I do slumber, 1 have a pleasant dream.
With my sweet girl sitting near me, close by a purling
stream; ...
Thro? England I?ve been roaming, with her at my
command, , , . ,
And waken?d broken-hearted upon Van Dieman s Eana.
God bless our wives and families,likewise that happy shore
The isle of great contentment, which we may see no more ;
As for our wretched families, see them we seldom can,
There?s 20 men for one woman upon Van Dieman?s Land.
There was a girl from Birmingham, Ann Summers was
her name, C sanie J
For fourteen years transported, we all well know the
Our planter bought her freedom, and married her out
of hand? ? '
She gave to us good usage upon Van Dieman?s Land.
But fourteen years is a long time?that is our fatal doom,
For nothinst else than poaching?God knows that s all
we?ve done:
You would leave off dog, gun, snare, and poaching every
man, [Land.
If you did but know the hardships upon Van Dieman?s
Now if I had a thousand pounds laid down all in my hand,
I?d give it all for liberty, if that I could command :
Again to England I?d return, and be a happy man,
And bid adieu to poaching, and to Van Dieman?s Land.
