NOTES
FOR THE
Guidance of Umpires and Referees.
1. The Referee’s or Sole Umpire’s de-
cision is in all cases final.
2. The Referee or Sole Umpire shall
be time-keeper, and his decision on any
question of “ Time ” shall be final, and
he shall have power at his absolute and
sole discretion to allow extra time for
any delays that may take place.
3. All free-kicks awarded by way of
penalty may now be converted into goals,
except the free-kick for a knock-on from
a throw out of touch.
4. The ball is dead if it strikes a Spec-
tator, Umpire or Referee, and a scrum-
mage shall be formed forthwith, at the
spot where the touching occurs, but it is
not dead if when a player running with
it collides with a Spectator, Umpire or
Referee.
5. A fair-catch can only be made
direct from an opponent’s kick, knock


on, or throw forward, and not from a
rebound.
6. It is lawful to make a fair-catch
from kick-out or kick-off.
7. Any projections on boots of the
nature of spikes are illegal.
8. The corner flags are in touch-in-
goal, and the intermediate touch-flags
are in touch ; the ball is therefore in
touch-in-goal or in touch, as the case
may be, if it strikes them.
9. Since it is the object in a throw-
out of touch to land the ball at right
angles to the touch line, a ball thrown
out crooked to allow for the wind, but
eventually pitching straight, is a straight
throw. On the other hand, a ball thrown
out straight, but subsequently diverted
by the wind is not a straight throw.
10. A player, provided that he is not
carrying the ball: —
(a) May be in touch and yet play
the ball with his feet, so long as
the ball itself is not in touch.
(b) May be in touch-in-goal and yet
score a try, by touching the ball
down, so long as the ball is not
in touch-in-goal.


11. The ball is in touch if it crosses the
touch line and is then blown back into
play. A Goal is scored if the ball crosses
the bar and is then blown back into play.
12. A player can score a try by touch-
ing the ball down in goal, even though
the ball be dead before he reaches it. To
secure a try the ball must be touched
down by the hand.
13. So long as a player has one hand
on the ball he may remain in a Maul-in-
goal.
14. The placer of the ball for a kick
at goal shall not be included in the
“ kicker’s side,” who must remain behind
the ball until the try has been decided.
15. In the case of an illegal charge
before the ball has been placed on the
ground for a kick at goal, the Referee or
Sole Umpire may, on a claim by the
kicker’s side, if he has whistled before
the kicker has taken his kick, allow
the ball to be placed anew, and prohibit
the defenders from charging, whether the
kicker has taken his kick subsequent to
his whistling or not: but if the kicker
has taken his kick before the whistle has
been blown, the Referee or Sole Umpire
cannot allow him a second kick.


16. The ball must now be brought out
for a try at goal in a straight line from
the spot where it was touched down,
whether between the posts or not.
17. In the case of an appeal to'an Um-
pire play shall not cease pending a de-
cision.
18. The game shall be stopped when-
ever the Referee or Sole Umpire blows
his whistle.
19. In the case of appeals being made
on more than one point, the second ap-
peal can only be entertained when the
first is disallowed, except in the case of a
“ knock-on ” out of touch, when if a fair-
catch is made a “free-kick” may be
taken, even though a claim fora “ knock-
on ” had been granted.
20. Appeals must be made immediately
after the points occur which cause them,
otherwise they cannot be entertained by
the - Umpires, Referee or Sole Umpire.
21. The Referee or Sole Umpire shall,
if he allows the appeal, immediately
blow his whistle and the game shall be
immediately stopped ; but if on the con-
trary the Referee or Sole Umpire does
not immediately blow his whistle, it


shall be taken that he disallows the
appeal, and the game shall proceed as
though no appeal had been made.
22. In the case of “ kick-off,” “ kick-
out ” and fair-catch it shall be the duty
of the Referee or Sole Umpire to see
that the kicker’s side are behind the
ball when it is kicked. In the event of
players (in his opinion) breaking the law
on any of these points, he shall, on a
claim by the opposite side, order a scrum-
mage to be formed in the case of “ kick-
off ” in the centre of the ground, and in
the case of “ kick-out ” at a spot twenty
five yards from the kicker’s goal line,
and equidistant from both the touch
lines, and in the case of a “ fair-catch ”
at the spot where the “ fair-catch ” was
made.
23. If in the opinion of the Referee or
Sole Umpire any player shall in a scrum-
mage intentionally handle the ball, or fall
down, he shall, on a claim by the op-
posite side, award a free-kick.
24. In the event of any player illegally
tackling, charging, or obstructing any
opponent, the Referee or Sole Umpire
shall, on a claim by the opposite side,


award a free-kick at the spot where the
offence took place.
25. A player who is off-side may,
nevertheless, run until an opponent
actually has the ball, but must stop
directly he has it.
26. In the event of any player when
off-side wilfully touching the ball or run-
ning .or attempting to tackle or other-
wise interrupting an opponent who has
the ball until such opponent has run five
yards or taken his kick, the opposite
side may elaim either, (1) a free-kick,
or (2) a scrummage at the spot where the
ball was last played, before the offence
occurred, the Referee or Sole Umpire
shall award the claim.
27. If on a throw-out from touch the
ball shall be knocked on, the opposite
side may claim either (1) a free-kick,
snch free-kick not to count a goal, or (2)
a scrummage at the spot where the knock-
on occurred, the Referee or Sole Um-
pire shall award the claim.
28. If a player shall kick, pass or carry
the ball back across his goal-line, and it
there be made dead, the Referee or Sole
Umpire may on a claim from the opposite


side order that the ball shall be brought
back, and a scrummage formed at the spot
whence it was kicked, passed or carried
back.
29. If, in the opinion of the Referee or
Sole Umpire, a try would undoubtedly
have been gained but for the unfair play
or interference of the defending side,
he shall, on a claim by the opposite side,
adjudge such try. On the other hand, if,
in his opinion, a try would undoubtedly
not have been gained but for the unfair
play or interference of the attacking side,
he shall, on a claim from the opposite,
adjudge a touch down.
30. If in the opinion of the Referee or
Sole Umpire any player, when he has
been tackled, and the ball held, has not
immediately put the ball down, he shall,
on a claim by the opposite side, award a
free kick at the spot where the offence
occurred.
31. The Referee or Sole Umpire shalj
signify the granting of a fair-catch by
blowing his whistle, without further
claim than the heel-mark. (See Law 26.)
If the whistle is not promptly blown, it
must be taken that the claim is not
granted.


32. In all cases when a claim has once
been made for a “ fair-catch ” or “ free-
kick,” it must be taken, if granted by the
Referee or Sole Umpire.
