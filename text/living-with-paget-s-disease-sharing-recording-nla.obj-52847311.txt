The Paget’s Support Group was formed in 1983. It’s main aims are:
- to increase knowledge and profile of Paget’s Disease,
through public awareness of the extent of the disease.
- to provide support and information for the members.

It makes sense to understand what is happening to your
body with any health problem, and it is with this in mind
that this booklet has been put together.
It is designed to be used as a record to monitor your
Paget’s Disease. Whilst the booklet contains basic facts
in point form, for more detailed information refer to
our more comprehensive PAGET’S DISEASE OF BONE
available through your local Paget’s Support Group or
through the Department of Endocrinology and
Metabolism, Concord Repatriation General Hospital.
The aim of treating your Paget’s Disease is to relieve
pain and prevent disability from complications. Whilst
there is no cure for Paget’s Disease, todays treatments
are able to reduce the activity of the disease and for
many bring the disease into remission, that is, no active
Paget’s Disease in the bone.

Understanding Paaet's Disease
What is Paget's Disease?
Paget’s Disease is a bone disorder that occurs when the normal
process of bone remodelling (old bone broken down and new
bone formed) is affected. Bone is living tissue, just tike the skin
and other parts of the body and is constantly being renewed
(remodelled). In areas of bone involved by Paget’s Disease the
rate of old bone being broken down and new bone replacing it
speeds up. This may result in bones that become enlarged,
misshapen and fragile.
Normal Bone Remodelling
What causes Paget's Disease?
The cause is not yet fully understood, but it appears to be the
result of both a genetic factor that you inherit and possibly a
‘slow viral' infection, a condition that is present for many years
before symptoms appear


What are the symptoms?
Some people with Paget’s Disease may not have any symptoms.
Symptoms are often vague and can mimic other conditions. The
most common would be:
• pain in the affected bone, frequently described as a
'deep seated burning pain’
• heat over the affected bone
• pain in a joint
Complications may develop and these include enlargement and
deformity of the affected bone, fractures in weight bearing
bones and pressure on nerve roots.
How is it diagnosed?
Bones affected with Paget’s Disease have a characteristic
appearance on x-rays and the disease is often diagnosed this
way. A blood test showing elevated levels of alkaline
phosphatase (an enzyme that is overproduced in Paget's
Disease), will alert your doctor to investigate further with more
specific tests, A bone scan should always be done to show
which bones are involved.


Understanding Paget's Disease
What is the prognosis (long term outcome) for
people with Paget’s Disease?
Generally symptoms progress slowly and the outlook is good,
particularly if treatment is commenced before major bone
changes have occurred, and there is usually no spread to
normal bones. Treatment can control Paget’s Disease, lessen
symptoms and prevent complications. However it is not a cure.
When untreated, it can cause serious complications, depending
on which bones are affected.
What causes pain in Paget’s Disease?
Pain in the affected bone is the most common symptom
reported. This is thought to be due to the stretching of the
covering of bone (periosteum) as the bone gets larger It may
also be in the joint close to the affected bone, where
osteoarthritis is common, due to deformity of the joint surface.
Is there a special diet that will help my Paget’s
Disease?
No,There is no relationship between diet and Paget’s Disease,
However; a healthy balanced diet is recommended. Patients
with a history of kidney stones should normally not take
calcium and vitamin D tablets, Discuss this with your doctor
6


If my bones are fragile, is it safe for me to
exercise?
Exercise is very important in maintaining your bone health,
avoiding weight gain and keeping your joints mobile. Before
beginning any exercise program it is wise to discuss this with
your doctor as undue stress on affected bones should be
avoided.
Will Paget’s Disease spread from the bone or
bones where it is initially diagnosed, to other
parts of the skeleton?
The disease is normally confined to affected bones and may
progress slowly within that bone, depending on whether or not
you are being treated. There is usually no spread to unaffected
bones.
Should my Paget’s Disease be monitored when
the course of treatment is completed?
Monitoring the response to treatment is one of the most
important aspects of managing Paget’s Disease. The patient’s
symptoms and laboratory test results show whether the
treatment has been fully effective and when it needs to be
repeated. Frequency and timing of tests depend on which test
is being considered and which treatment has been administered.
Since there is no cure for the disease the aim is to control the
disease process to avoid complications arising.


What tests are done for Paget’s
disease and what do they mean?
Blood Test
Alkaline phosphatase: is an enzyme (a substance in the
blood) that is produced by bone building cells
(osteoblasts). In Paget’s Disease it is overproduced by the
affected bone.This test is used to diagnose the disease and also
to monitor the effect of your treatment, With treatment, the
level of alkaline phosphatase in your blood should fall into the
normal range (approximately up to 100 - 130 U/L)
Urine Test
Collagen Crosslinks; is a substance that is produced by cells
that break down old bone (osteoclasts). High levels of
these substances in the urine mean your Paget's Disease is
active.The aim is to bring it down into the normal range (this
depends on the exact test and how it is done).
Bone Scans
This test tells your doctor which bones are involved.
A small amount of radioactive substance is injected into the
bloodstream (this is quite safe) This is taken up by areas of
bone affected by Paget's Disease. Bone scans use less
radiation than x-rays and are more sensitive in detecting
affected bone. The doctor may also use this test to see if the
Paget's Disease is still active after a course of treatment.
X-rays
Allow the doctor to confirm that there is Paget’s Disease in a
particular bone, and assess the way in which the disease is
affecting a particular bone or joint.

How is Paget's Disease treated?
The goal of treatment is to control your Paget's
Disease with medication, relieve the symptoms and
prevent complications, e.g. bone deformity.
The treatment used is a group of medications known
as bisphosphonates (biss-foss-fon-ates). There are a
number of different bisphosphonates available, which
are listed over the page.
They come in tablet form or as an intravenous (into a
vein) infusion. This is often referred to as a 'drip',
Your doctor will decide which is most appropriate for
you, and give specific instructions for taking your
medication.
