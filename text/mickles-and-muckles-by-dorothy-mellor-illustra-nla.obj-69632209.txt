Dicky Dan stared. There, propped against a great boulder, sat
a gnome, the most surprising gnome Dicky Dan had ever seen.
He was wearing a sort of green swimming suit, and across his
shoulder hung a pair of field glasses. ?I?m Dicky Dan,? said Dicky
when he could find his voice. ?Who who are you??
?They call me Jimpsy Joystick,? the gnome said.
?What a queer name! Why do they call you that??
?Because of my aeroplane; the joystick is part of it, you see;
it couldn?t fly without the joystick.? The gnome looked up at Dicky
Dan. ?Never heard of me?? he asked. ?Never,? said Dicky Dan,
shaking his head. ?Have you seen my shilling about here? I have
lost it.?
"Shilling?? the gnome repeated, pricking up his long ears
and whistling a soft long whistle. ?Shilling? No, I haven?t.?
Dicky Dan?s chin went up. ?Well, I?m going to search the whole

?Flip the Bunyip? Might HE know??
?If it?s anywhere in the Heart of Australia, Flip is the boy to
know.? They flew over houses and gardens, over treetops and
rivers, until they reached the hot brown desert in the Heart of
Australia. Then the propellers stopped whirring, and Jimpsy taxied
his plane gently down. Raising his hands to his mouth, Jimpsy
coo-eed loud and long . . . An answer came echoing back. Hurry-

and floppy ears one up, one down and he had
flippers instead of paws, and looked the happiest
animal Dicky Dan had ever seen. He greeted Jimpsy

Jimpsy thought for a moment. ?We might go to South Africa . . . ?
Dicky was breathless, his eyes shone. ?Or to America,? he said.
?I heard my Daddy say the other day that the boys and girls in
America know lots about aeroplanes. What is that noise? Is it your
aeroplane, Jimpsy?? Jimpsy craned his neck to look. Flip lazily
thought it might be a beetle flying over. ?And from Alaska, you
will be quite close to the Reindeer . . . and the Polar Bears ...?

*' Hi
Joystick like an old friend, and listened intently to the story of
Dicky Dan?s shilling.
?Really? What, then, are your plans, Jimpsy?? asked Flip,
raising both his ears. ?Plans? How do you mean plans??
?Well plans. Do you mean to say you haven?t made your
plans? Why, this will never do. You must have plans, you know.
And how about your maps??
?Maps? My plane knows its way without those things,? said
Jimpsy scornfully. I think we will first run across to the Jungle
and ask the animals if THEY have seen Dicky Dan?s shilling. . . .
What was that? I thought I saw a shadow . . . . ?
Flip laughed. ?Perhaps a blue butterfly; they are about just
now. And from the Jungle where then??
?And I?ve a mind to see the Red Indians,? said Jimpsy. ?Hark!
Listen!? He hopped up and peered around the boulder. ?Snitcher!
It?s Snitcher the Goblin! Shhh! He HAS followed us!
He is listening behind that rock to our plans. Keep
talking, Flip, as if we are still with you, while we slip
away. Make it snappy, Dicky Dan. ...?
Softly they crept away and were well up in the
air and off before Snitcher found out or could
follow them.
JUNGLEDOM
impsy Joystick swung his plane swiftly into
the wind, taking off on the Great Adventure.
He laughed softly. ?Serve Snitcher right.
Won?t he be mad when he finds we have
slipped away ...? They climbed
steadily, smoothly, out over the calm
blue sea; not a cloud, not
a sound but the soft hum-
ming of Jimpsy?s plane.

Dan?s hand, Jimpsy led him up to the Jungle. ?You are always
welcome, Jimpsy Joystick,? murmured Mother Jungle, then, frown-
ing at Dicky Dan, she added, ?Who is your fledgling? An enemy?
The son of a White Man!? Jimpsy Joystick was humble. ?The son
of a White Man, Madam ?but a friend,? he said. ?We have come
to see you and to ask if you know anything of Dicky Dan?s shilling.?
?Is my shilling here?? asked Dicky Dan timidly.
?Shilling? Shilling, did you say, sir??
?Yes, Madam. Dicky Dan has lost it and we search the world
for it.? The Jungle stood still with amazement. ?Lost? No one in
the jungle ever loses anything. Such a thing is never known in
Jungledom. Be careful how you talk here of losing things, for the
Ant-eater has a very long tongue, and he may tell the others. He
causes me a great deal of worry,? Mother Jungle sighed.
Dicky Dan was getting used to the darkness. It was like going
indoors from the sunshine when everything at first is dark. Dicky
Dan and Jimpsy Joystick sat down to rest and Mother Jungle folded
her arms about them. She called a number of the animals Gib the
monkey, and Bumbledom the elephant, and hosts of others. The
tiger dropped a hot heavy tear on Dicky Dan?s head. ?The poor
child, the poor little man,? she gulped, ?has lost his shilling.?
?Well, what of it?? Mother Jungle snapped.

?Oh no, mother?we shouldn?t feel like that about it.? The
tiger lifted her streaming eyes. ?You should

shilling.? ?I know it wasn?t.? The tiger burst into
weeping. ?But I feel as if it was. And that?s


A small black monkey who had been hanging on to the topmost
branch of a tree overhead suddenly laughed so hard that he fell on
the tiger. The tiger cuffed him sadly a couple of times, and turned
again to Mother Jungle. ?What IS a shilling, mother?? she asked
wonderingly. ?A shilling,? said Mother Jungle slowly, ?is what
children of white men call money. It is sometimes called a
BEGINNING.? Everyone sat still to hear the story of the Jungle.
?There was a time,? said Mother Jungle, ?when I was the
tiniest thing. Mine was a very humble beginning; a tree here, a tree
there. Everything must have a BEGINNING, however small. Like
white men?s pennies and shillings . . . . ?
?I know,? interrupted Dicky Dan. ?Mickles and Muckles . . . ?
Jimpsy Joystick nudged him to be quiet.
Mother Jungle?s frown faded and she continued. ?The trees
grew, and more came; vines climbed about them fondly; sun and
rain gave them warmth and life. That was the beginning of
the Jungle home. It gave shelter to the animals?lions, tigers,
pigs and bears; squirrels, elephants and monkeys. The jungle
grew bigger and bigger. Then the animals drew up the laws m
of the Jungle. It was to be kept clean and orderly; no waste,
no one was to go hungry or homeless. A strong guard was | J

who came to destroy, to chop down
trees, to shoot the animals, to ruin

living there could teach them
some lessons in how not to
lose things, how not to waste.


f
f /
Do the people of the jungle lose things? Squander? No! These
things NEVER happen in the jungle.?
Mother Jungle looked hard at Jimpsy and Dicky Dan while all
the animals cheered the end of her speech. ?See that you both
remember,? said Mother Jungle. ?Oh, we will,? said Dicky Dan
hastily.
Mother Jungle was silent a long moment, until she said, ?I am
glad that Jimpsy Joystick brought you, Dicky Dan. I will give you
the Freedom of the Jungle forever . . . you will always be welcome
here.? Jimpsy Joystick smiled and blushed. ?How kind you are!
We thank you, Mother Jungle, and everyone. We have far to go,
ever so far ?but someday . . . someday . . . Come, Dicky . . come!?
Dicky Dan was still thanking them as he waved goodbye; they
were all there to see them off, the elephant, the lions, the squirrels,
the ant-eater, even the little black monkey, and the motherly tiger
who stood shaking her head and weeping because Dicky Dan was
going so far, far away across the sea in that queer thing they called
an aeroplane

us yet. If only we can clear the great high mountains, we
might be able to shake him off.? Jimpsy?s voice was excited but a bit
anxious too. They were still as far off as ever from the lost shilling.
Dicky scanned. All he could see were bare peaks towering
straight to them in the sky. ?Do you think it might be there,
Jimpsy?? ?What do you see, Dicky Dan?? Jimpsy asked.

Shagra wonderingly. Dicky Dan nodded. ?To put more with it;
to make it grow. Mickles and muckles, you know.? He laughed.
?Mickles and Muckles how funny,? said Shagra as he lifted
his head and made the long Call of the Arctic far and wide. When
they were all gathered together on an ice-floe, the seals and whales,
the fleet reindeer and the polar bears, Jimpsy talked to them. He
told them that out in the great big world men exchanged their food
for money. They didn?t hunt like the Arctic folk. For fear this
money should be lost they had places where it could be kept safely
and where it could grow like baby bears, or baby seals, into more
money. ?And that?s what Dicky Dan wants to do with his shilling
when he finds it. You of the Great White Land,? Jimpsy said,
?could never afford to lose ANYTHING. Food is hard to gather,
to save against your winter when all the land is frozen white. All
through the summer months, you animals of the Arctic lay up your
store, little by little, piece by piece, so that you do not starve, so
that your families and little ones do not starve in the long winter
before you.? The polar bear grumbled, ?Ough! I?m tired of all
this talk of saving,? he said, with a yawn.
Shagra looked severely at him and turned to Dicky Dan.
?Please pardon the bear?s bad manners; he doesn?t mean it. Here
in the Arctic we do
not have money,?
he said. ?But each
animal when he is
small is taken care
of by his elders,
and trained careful-
ly to save and USE
everything. When
he grows older, he
hunts for himself.

then he starts housekeeping and provides for his-wife and family.
In the Arctic our folk NEVER waste, are never,stipshoil or careless;

he had said too much for good manners. bi\ like
boasting. ... ?I am sorry we cannot for <you,

said the silly Seal, and barked hoarsely in fareweu7 ?Beaver
Country?" said Snitcher, leaping to his own plane. ?Why, that?s
just where I?m going!? and?buzzzz! ... off he flew!
Jimpsy looked anxiously at Dicky Dan. ?Our aeroplane is the
best of any gnome's but we are two passengers. That?s extra
weight. Watch him; keep the glasses on him, Dicky Dan
?Bye Shagra, ?bye everyone, ?bye ...? Snitcher was well away.
Think he 11 find my shilling?? Dicky Dan was anxious.
The sun was shining warmly as they flew over the deep blue
ocean; the light wind blew the wavelets into soft white curls here
and there. See those seagulls? And the albatross? We are near-
ing land, I should say.? Jimpsy was a good pilot.
On and on they flew, over the coast, over dark green pine
forests which grew lighter and then darker again, until at last they
came down in the Beaver Country. Looking steadily through
Jimpsy s glasses, Dicky Dan saw Red Indians with their squaws and
little children sitting around fires
J which burned before their wig-
wams. . . . Secret-looking people,
he thought. This might be just
the place where

They found Snitcher leaning
against it.
BEAVERLAND
impsy Joystick looked at the Indians in the distance. ?No.
They won?t have your shilling; they only want scalps,? he
said. ?Then we?d better keep away,? said Dicky Dan.
?I wonder where Snitcher is??
?I?ll make a landing by this Waterfall,? said Jimpsy. ?Whew!
That was a chase ... I wonder what HAS become of Snitcher??
?Ha-ha-ha . . . ha-ha-ha . . . ha-ha-ha,? laughed the Waterfall
knowingly.
?Of course she knows everything that goes on in the woods,
Dicky.? ?Everything, Dicky Dan,? the Waterfall chuckled.
?Then can you tell me where my shilling is, please?? said
Dicky Dan. ?And Snitcher and his aeroplane, I?d like to know,?
said Jimpsy. The Waterfall burbled and tumbled over and over in
somersaults, hurrying on, never still, softly murmuring, softly hum-
ming as she went, ever onwards, merrily, happily. But she would
only laugh and tell them nothing.
?Come, we must follow Snitcher. SHE won?t tell us anything,?
said Jimpsy Joystick. They followed the Waterfall on and on till
they came to a place where she tumbled into a lake. A few willow
trees drooped over the lake, where the great pine forest stood on
guard. ?I?ve heard of this place,? said Jimpsy, ?but I?ve never been
here before. I wonder who lives here? Pretty busy sort of people;
look at all the little trees, nearly nibbled through.?
A Grandpa Beaver poked his head out of the lake. He floated
up to them, staring at Dicky Dan and Jimpsy Joystick. He shook
the water from his glossy coat, and scrambled up the bank. Stand-
ing on his webbed hind-feet and balancing on his square flat tail,
he made his bow to the visitors. ?I heard from the chattering
Waterfall that you were here. I came to see why.? His beady black
eyes looked them up and down, his head first on one side, then the
other.
?Have YOU seen my shilling anywhere?? asked Dicky Dan.
The old Beaver looked puzzled. He turned to his wife who was
scrambling up the bank to see what it was all about. ?Shilling??
he said. ?Is it a tree?can you eat it?? Dicky laughed and shook
his head. ?I?ve lost it, and we?ve come to look for it. Can you help
us?? ?Help you? Well now,? he looked at his wife anxiously,
?we Beavers are very busy people . There are trees to cut and
collect, to carry and store. You?ve no idea how tiring it is to
roll the logs down the bank and float them across to our lodge.?


#�/ ~ Grandpa Beaver made his bow to the visitors.
'
?Well, why do you do it?? asked Dicky.
?Food, young man, food to be stored for the winter. Then new
lodges have to be built and the old ones patched . . . our enemies
must be watched, our strongholds strengthened. . . . There is our
home see for yourselves,? he invited, waving a paw in the direc-
tion of the great high lodge, a mound in the water, built of grass
and moss and twigs woven together and plastered with wet mud.
It was nearly three times as high as Dicky Dan, and broader than
the school playhouse. ?That is my home, the home of my family.
It takes a lot of keeping up. But, gentlemen, look for yourselves,
look for yourselves. You?re welcome.?
Dicky Dan leaned over the bank ?Hi! Look out!? cried
Jimpsy, clutching at Dicky?s pyjama-sleeve. But it was too late.
With a loud splash Dicky Dan fell into the lake! ?There you are!?
began Jimpsy, forgetting he was holding on to Dicky Dan. ?I told
you ...? Splash! Splash! Jimpsy was in too!
Dicky Dan?s head came up first. Not a sign of Jimpsy ah,
there he was, over by the Beaver?s house. Dicky Dan laughed;
Jimpsy?s long ears were plastered round his face; he looked all eyes
?angry eyes glaring at Dicky Dan. ?Funny, isn?t it?? Jimpsy
growled. ?Pulling people into lakes . . ?
Dicky Dan shivered. ?It?s?it?s cold and wet, isn?t it?? Jimpsy
snorted and one of his ears flew up into its right place. ?Water
often IS wet,? he said. ?Can you swim??
?Well, Uncle Les is teaching me ?
?Uncle Les!? Jimpsy snorted again, and the other ear flew up.
?Excuse me, gentlemen,? the Beaver?s
quiet voice broke in, ?can I give you a

lift I mean, a tow? You

pretty well. . . . Just catch hold
of my tail, and I?ll have you
ashore in no time. That?s right
?now you take Jimpsy?s foot
?no, that?s his ear; I said his
foot . . . Right? Off we go!?
Safely ashore, the Beaver
turned to Dicky Dan. ?Borrow
Jimpsy?s field-glasses,? he said,
?and look at my home through
them.?
?Oh, Jimpsy, it is wonder-
ful,? Dicky cried. ?I see four
beavers with their father and
mother, dear little woolly ones
in a large room, so tidy with
its floor all covered with moss
and leaves.?
Mr. Beaver smiled. ?Did
you see the storeroom filled
with food? Took some build-
ing, that place did. We worked
and worked, day and night,
from a very humble beginning.
We taught the others, and
so the homes grew.? He pointed to the other lodges all about,
quite a village of them. ?The baby beavers are our first care.?
?Mr. Beaver, I think your home is wonderful,? Dicky Dan said.
?But don't tell anyone. Particularly the Otter . . . ?
A long-drawn howl pierced the sunny air. Mr. Beaver turned
pale, and his paws were trembling. ?The Wolf,? he whispered
hoarsely, as he watched his wife dive at once into the creek. ?The
White Owl warned me last night. Goodbye, my friends, goodbye.?
He dived suddenly after his wife and vanished, and the Waterfall
laughed and laughed.
?Snitch-snitch-snlTcher! Snitch-snitch-snlTcher!? called a little
bird high up in a tall poplar tree. ?Snitch-snitch ?
?You hear that?? said Jimpsy Joystick. ?A warning! Come
quickly, Dicky Dan,? and he started up the hill with Dicky Dan
at his heels. ?Hey! Young Snitcher!? called Jimpsy. ?What
have you done with my plane??
Snitcher sat on the top of the hill* his arms folded about his
knees; he grinned at them. Beside him was his plane. But Jimpsy?s
had gone! ?Findings keepings!? called Snitcher from the distance.


Dicky Dan turned pale. ?What does he mean? Has HE found
my shilling?? ?Come on,? growled Jimpsy. ?Hurry up!?
But as they stumbled up the hillside, Snitcher suddenly stood up
and got into his plane. ?Catch me?catch me?lF you can!? he
called. Just as his plane rose, a great brown eagle swooped down
with outspread wings, and, taking Snitcher, aeroplane and all, in
his great claws, he flew off with him.
Dicky Dan looked at Jimpsy Joystick. Jimpsy looked at Dicky.
?Dicky Dan! We must do something. After all, Snitcher, you know,
belongs to the goblin, the gnome world,? said Jimpsy anxiously.
Taking the glasses, he watched the direction the eagle took before
he gave the special Cry of the Gnomes to comfort Snitcher. ?To
the plane, Dicky Dan; we must follow and release him. Get the
plane.?
?But where is it?? asked Dicky Dan. ?It is gone.? Jimpsy
shook his head impatiently. ?That silly Snitcher has only hidden it;
he thinks it?s funny. Give me the glasses,? he said.
At last Jimpsy saw the aeroplane hidden inside a large cave.
They hopped in and tore after Snitcher. After an hour?s furious
flying, they saw him caught fast on a topmost peak.
?Shall we leave him there, Jimpsy? You know, in a way, he
deserves it.? Jimpsy Joystick shook his head. ?You don?t know
the eagle?s habits,? he said.
When Snitcher saw them, he whimpered. He was green with
fright; his aeroplane was so damaged that it took Jimpsy quite a
time to mend it; even then it would be some time before Snitcher
reached Australia. He would never race them again, he promised,
and was quite polite and humble
as he climbed into his mended
plane and took the air behind
them. Every now and then Jimpsy
asked Dicky Dan to look back
through the glasses to make sure
Snitcher was still aloft and
following them. Across
the wide heavens, in
and out of creamy
cloud banks, over land
that grew from green
to grey, over neat little
islands set in rings of
white surf they flew?
Caught fast on
a topmost peak.

on and on, until at last they saw the blue sky, the blue sea, the
sunny golden land of Australia once more.
Jimpsy laughed happily. ?We?ll make straight for the Billabong,
Dicky Dan; we?ll get all the news there,? he said. ?If there?s any
chance of your shilling, the Billabong lot will know.? . . .
BILLABONG.
impsy Joystick let his aeroplane glide gently to a resting-
place beside the Billabong. Spots of yellow sunlight danced
about the gum trees and bottlebrush; it was good to feel
t h e st j n g Q f sunshine again, and to see the host of Austra-
lian friends coming from far and near to welcome them home once
more. ?You know, my Australian friends,? said the gnome, ?you
ought to realise what a comfortable life you have. We have just
come from the Jungle, and from the Arctic and Beaverland, where
life is often a struggle, where the smallest fragments of food are
gathered and saved up for the long winters; but YOU, my friends,

everything ...?
An Old Man Kangaroo stood up to his full height, his ears
twitching with excitement; by his side stood a Native Companion.
?Jimpsy Joystick,? he said, ?we were hoping to see you soon.
You have always been a help in times of trouble. News comes to us
from far and wide that trouble threatens us. I am an Old Man, and
I have seen droughts, I have seen floods, and I know the hunger
and death that follow them. Jimpsy, I fear there is another drought
ahead of us.?
His voice faded
to a whisper; his
face was drawn
with fear.

Jungle and the
Beavers, the

the Arctic, as he
looked round at

said. ?The Ibis must be sent to find the waterholes; the Rabbits
and Wallabies must go out and learn where the most food is to
be found, and the greedy Grasshoppers must be watched carefully;
the Cockatoos must hunt for roots and seeds, for they are bound
to be scarce, and they must spread the news from tree to tree until
all Bushland is warned.? The Goanna sighed. ?I?d rather have
floods any day,? he murmured wearily. ?Humph! You can climb
trees,? said a rabbit, ?but think of us.?
Jimpsy Joystick leaned over to Dicky Dan and whispered:
?Ever seen down a rabbit?s burrow, Dicky Dan?? ?No!? said
Dicky Dan solemnly. ?Or in a cricket?s house?? Dicky shook his
head. ?Or seen over a Rock Wallaby?s farm, or the gorges where
Flying Foxes gather? No,? said Jimpsy Joystick, ?you haven?t.
Take these glasses, Dicky, and look down that burrow for a start.
What do you see??
Dicky Dan took the glasses and looked; he chuckled with
delight. ?Jimpsy?the little bunnies. They are putting on their fur
coats and brushing their tails. The youngest ones are getting ready
for their breakfasts ...?
Ha! ha! ha!? laughed a Kookaburra high up in a tree.

Jimpsy?s smile went round to his
ears. ?And do they lose their fur
coats, any of ?em ? No. Do they
lose their tails ? Do they pinch
the other bunnies? breakfasts ? No.
They never have more than their
fair share; and they are taught to
take care of things.?
Dicky Dan looked at the crowd
sitting around the Billabong. A Wagtail flitted about sneering at
a Magpie. Koalas had gone back to finish their sleep in a nearby
tree; Ants, Bees and Beetles buzzed by; so busy, so clean, so cheer-
ful. . . Dicky took the glasses and looked down a neat round hole.
A big fat Locust was yawning and stretching, opening its eyes.
?Seven long years at an end,? it murmured sleepily. ?This is the
year I go out into the great world of sunshine to sing,? and he
started to wriggle his way out of the ground. A Frog leapt up
from the Billabong and gave a hoarse croak. Turning quickly,
Dicky Dan was startled to see Snitcher coming towards him. A
grin was on his face, in his hand was something silvery and shiny . . .
?Dicky Dan,? he laughed mockingly across the golden light
that lay about them. Dicky started up in alarm, when he heard
Jimpsy Joystick call to him. ?Dicky Dan . . . Dicky Dan ...? He
looked for Jimpsy amongst all the animals gathered there in the
soft pink and gold light, but he had vanished . . . ?Dicky, Dicky!?
. . . Was it the Wagtail? Dicky Dan looked up into the trees,
but they were fading away into a pale blue light; he looked for all
his friends, but they were ever so far away far, far away in the
blue-grey mist ....
?Dicky Dan!? . . . another voice

Jimpsy Joystick; it wasn't Snitcher; it wasn't Flip the Bunyip; it
wasn?t any of the Billabong folk. He opened his eyes ....
It was Mummy. He smiled Mummy standing there beside
his bed! ?Come, Dicky Dan, get up or you?ll be late for school.
You mustn't be late now you're SEVEN, you know."
Mummy?s cool hand was on his forehead. ?You've been
dreaming, Dicky. Too much birthday cake, I should say.?
?I?ve been looking for my shilling . . . ?
?Your shilling? Here it is, on your dressing-table; ready for
you to take to the school bank. We will empty your money-box,
100, and it can be earning more pennies, Dicky Dan, for you.
?Monny a mickle makes a muckle,? you know . . . .
?The mickle and the muckle,? Dicky Dan laughed happily.
That dream was over, anyhow.
He caught his mummy?s hand, ?But I?l might lose them, he
whispered, remembering Snitcher,
?LOSE them, Dickie? Surely
?No, perhaps I won?t now,?
and Shagra.
Dicky Dan set off for
school, his pennies and
shillings and sixpences all
folded in a brown paper
bag, packed carefully in
his coat pocket. Mummy
fastened it for him with a
large safety-pin.
?Put them all in the
Bank, Dicky,? she said.
?Then you can?t lose
them. They are your
?mickle,? you see, which
the Bank makes into a
great big ?muckle? for
you.?
?The mickle and the
muckle,? he chuckled, the
coins jingling as he ran
off to school, ?the mickle
and the muckle!?
