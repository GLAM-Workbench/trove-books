THE
.? ?
THIRD CHAPTER OF REVELATIONS.
? IT?S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND.?
N producing ray second pamphlet on ? The Financial
Position of Queensland,? I consider it desirable to
preface it by a few remarks in reply to some of
the adverse criticisms to which the first one has been
subject. I hereby disclaim any intention to dictate
a financial policy based on the assumption of my
infallibility. My object has been, and is, while criti-
cising what I consider the errors in the financial policy of our
past and present Governments in the plain and strong language
necessary to make my meaning perfectly intelligible, and in
exposing the misstatements in the annual financial balance sheets
submitted to the people of the colony and the outside world, as
well as the misappropriations of the public funds, I base my
charges entirely on official documents.
Any comments of mine suggested by these must be taken
as my individual opinions free from any outside dictation and
uninfluenced by any personal feelings, and are strictly confined
to the public acts of those whose policy and acts I condemn. In
advocating any change in the method of keeping our Government
accounts, or proposing any financial changes, I do so in the hope
that they will meet full and fair consideration from the taxpayers
in whose interest I write, and shall be very much gratified if any
of my suggestions may be considered worthy of adoption. I may
add that, not having a stake in any description of colonial in-
vestment, I am not biassed by any consideration of self-interest.
I trust this explanation may be considered satisfactory to my
readers.


I think it will be admitted that the colonisation of Queens-
land has been so far a conspicuous failure, particularly when the
favourable circumstances under which it was started 88 years
since are taken into account, with a small population ol
about 27,000 and an almost nominal debt ?virtually a clear start;
with an unencumbered real estate of 428,000,000 (lour hundred
and twenty-eight million) acres, containing more undeveloped
wealth than, any other country on the face of the globe. Yet in
the present year there are less than 300,000 acres under culti-
vation ; 10,640,000 alienated, value �6,640,000, employed as
cattle and sheep runs and under pastoral and mining occupation,
bringing in a revenue from all sources ol �501,500 in round
numbers. We have a public-lunded debt of �29,457,184, the
interest provided for in the Estimates for the current year being
�1,214,000, an increase of �57,750 on the previous one. We
have in addition a deficit of �6.642,550.
The various statements furnished by the Treasury Department
have been so manipulated as to present a kind of kaleidoscopic
effect by exhibiting the same figures from different points of view,
as the contents of the kaleidoscope, by turning the cylinder round,
are made to produce different combinations, the contents being
still the same. So the facts of which the colonial balance-sheet
is composed remain the same ?no amount of manipulation can
alter them.
When the Treasurer, in making his Financial Statement, said
that he had reduced the deficit, Mr. Nelson termed it a ? Financial
Juggle.? He might have used a stronger term. In the case of
a manager or director of a public company it would have been
termed ?Falsifying the accounts? ?in other words, issuing a
?? fraudulent statement.? The statement will appear in its proper
place. .
The Obstacle to be overcome in bringing about any radical
?change in this colony is, the vis in of the people ?an apathy
amounting almost to atrophy with regard to their duties and
responsibilities as citizens of a new country, the success ot which
depends on the individual action ol each member. This has been
brought about principally by the habit of dependence on the
?Government, which has completely demoralised all classes and
destroyed their habits of self-reliance. Out of this has grown a
habit of intense selfishness and the pursuit of personal interest,
to which all public duties are made subservient, Until this is
completely changed, and the people place their public duties first
.and their personal interests second, there is little hope of any
radical change for the better. They must be prepared to make a
sacrifice for the public benefit if there is any spark of patriotism
in them, which I have been sometimes led to doubt.


Who and what is the Government ? It is to ignorance on
this subject that many of our difficulties have arisen. The
Government, or rather the Ministers composing it, have been
looked on and treated as an entity invested with despotic powers
and claiming certain immunities with which no autocrat or
autocratic Government is invested. The members composing the
Government have been selected from the men elected by the people,,
and are supposed to represent the wishes and carry out the
intentions of the majority ; so those who placed them in their
positions have little right to complain. The members of the
Government really occupy the positions of the directors and:
trustees of a bank or other public company, and should be
amenable to the same rules and penalties. Unfortunately they
are not, and may, and with impunity, misappropriate the public-
funds and falsify the accounts, the only difference being that in
most cases they do not do so for their personal benefit, although the
result is the same to the people interested. They are, therefore,
instead of being brought before the Bar of the Law Courts,,
brought before what is called ? The Bar of public opinion,? the
penalty of which is dismissal; but the process of enforcing this
is very slow when they have a majority of the members of the
Assembly who selected them, as is the case with our late present
Government. The public are always ready to condone political
offences, unfortunately.
7 �/
The difficulty we shall have to contend with in the near future
will be to elect a new set of representatives who are not committed
to the financial and other errors of the past or pledged to any
line of policy. The choice among the members of the present
Assembly is very limited among those who have filled office or
taken a prominent part in the Opposition ; still it is to be hoped
that among the present members of the Assembly there are good
men who only require the opportunity to make their mark, and
outsiders who may be induced by the exigencies of the country to
come forward at the next election.
In all the great emergencies of the past the right man, or
men, have turned up at the proper time ; let us hope that this
will be the case in our present difficulty, which I trust we may
fully realise, and not be satisfied to dwell any longer in a ? fool?s
paradise,? or be led astray by interested or subsidised optimists
who preach security where there is none and ignore the facts of
our present position.
In my free criticism of the Financial Statements issued by the
Treasury Department I must disclaim any intention of making
personal reflections on the civil servants connected with it. They
have inherited a rotten system, and have had a very arduous duty
to perform in attempting to reduce such an amount of complicated
and conflicting elements to order, and have, no doubt, been acting


under superior orders to make the result square with foregone
conclusions. lam in the position of a surgeon applying the
knife in a critical case. The patient may wince under the
operation, but when it is over and he feels the relief his feeling
will be one of gratitude to the operator and he will soon forget
the unavoidable pain inflicted. All we require is a clear and
intelligible system of keeping the public accounts, of which I can
furnish a sketch as a basis. I give specimens of a style of
accounts to which I object.
The unexpended amouut of loan votes is stated to be
represented by the following :

Bearing the above remarks in view, I propose prove the
necessity that exists for a complete revision of the present system
of keeping the Government accounts, with a view to simplify and
make them intelligible to our ordinary legislators and taxpayers,
besides insuring accuracy and considerably reducing clerical work
and consequent expense.
It would be impossible to give anything approaching a


thorough analysis of the Financial Statements furnished by the
Government in the limits of an ordinary readable pamphlet, so
will confine myself to furnishing sufficient evidence to warrant
the adoption of my proposal.
I believe I shall be able to show that the present acknowledged
deficit is considerably understated, and that there is a still further
unacknowledged deficit which has been concealed by manipulating
the public accounts. I stated at the commencement of my first
pamphlet that ? Facts ave stubborn ,? and might have added
that there is nothing more deceptive than figures. If the facts do
not warrant my conclusions, and if I do not satisfy my readers
that the figures I shall bring forward are deceptive, I shall
be glad to acknowledge myself to be in error; till then I shall
hold my opinion.
At the end of the financial year before last, Sir Thomas
MTlwraith, then Treasurer, speaking of the coming year, stated
? That after meeting all engagements he would have a balance in
hand, July 1, 1892, of about �681,771, so that we were on pound
ground.? ' Mr. Donaldson asked : ? After providing for the deficit ??
The Treasurer; ?I shall have that money in hand.? Mr.
Donaldson again; ? After providing for the deficit ?? The
Treasurer; ?Yes!? {See Hansard). The Treasurer must have
known that this was not strictly in accordance with the facts. The
result appears in my report.
The Treasurer?s anticipations with regard to the current
year are equally optimistic. He states that he anticipates a
small surplus on General Revenue arising from the new taritfi
also that the Treasury Bills will be met by the forced sales of
land under the Act of 1891, while up to the present date the total
-sales have been �340,000, cash received �145,000. He also
expects that the sales of water from the Artesian bores will bring
in a handsome return on expenditure. So far he states that
�lOOO ! (one thousand pounds) had been received on an expend-
iture not given, which I estimate at about half-a-million!
independent of expense of keeping them open. This item has
disappeared altogether from General Estimates. At least I find
no trace of it.
The difficulty, if not impossiblity, of keeping the sums compos-
ing the National Balance separate led no doubt to the adoption of
what is erroneously termed the ? Consolidated Revenue Fund,?
which has led to what ?I propose to prove?has been a consider-
able amount of misappropriation of public funds and an amount
of confusion and complication of accounts which renders detec-
tion or rectification almost if not quite impossible. As the
A( lievenm Proper ? strictly speaking has not been sufficient to
meet the current annual expenditure, it has been the habit to
supplement it by appropriating receipts from other sources


or funds in hand, trust or otherwise, to make up the deficit; even
with this, the accumulated deficit from 1859-1892, say in 34
years, amounts to �1,455,141. Table L.
The deficit has no doubt arisen in many cases from un-
forseen expenditure for which no provision has been made in
the estimates, and although these have been afterwards
approved of by the House, there is not any proof that there
has been authority given to include them in future loans. The
way in which supply votes have been rushed through
the House at the end of the session prevents any proper super-
vision as was the case lately. It?s a perfect farce. (See Auditor-
General?s Report vi., �172,421, under this head.

Mr. Nelson pronounced this to be a financial juggle. Now,
where the juggle comes in is, that the Treasury Bills authorised
by the House were drawn against anticipated sales of land under
the Bill of 1891, the proceeds of these being hypothecated to meet
these and the interest; total amount authorised wa5�1,429,945,
of which �288,400 were sold in the colony, and �500,000
in London ; together, �788,400. Of this amount �400,000 was
appropriated in reduction of deficit and �125,000 cash, proceeds
of Land Sales amounting to �287,787 the payment of balanco


'extending over three years, the last payment maturing in 1895.
It will thus be seen that �400,000, part of the proceeds of sale
of unsecured Treasury Bills, and �125,000 of amount hypothe-
cated to secure these, were applied to nominally reduce the
?deficit!
Now let us compare the actual deficit with the above.
Deficit per Table L, p. 10, being Statement of Revenue and
Expenditure, 1859, to June 80, 1892 :

N.B.?Whether any portion of Treasury Bills should be
applied in reduction of this is an open question, but there cannot
be any difference of opinion with regard to applying the amount
{�125,000), held as a Trust Fund, to provide for payment of these.
Treasury Bills. ? The Acts authorising the issue of these
are Viet. 59, No. 26, for �500,000, applicable for ordinary
revenue purposes, maturing 1896, and Viet. 55, No. 8, for �920,945
{together �1,420,945). These were to provide for the pay-
ment of Victoria Bridge Debentures, �121,250, and then for
ordinary revenue purposes?lnterest in both cases not to exceed
4 per cent, per annum. Had these Bills been issued on the
same plan as the old Exchequer Bills, bearing interest at a fixed
rate per diem, they would have been a favourite investment, as
the latter were, and might have been floated, I believe, at par,
bearing interest at pence per diem, or 8f per cent, per annum.
lam not aware that there would have been any objection. They
could then have been retired as the funds specially set apart for
their redemption were realised?another advantage, as the
interest would then cease. ? The funds for the redemption of
these were to be provided by the sales of government lands as per
Act Viet. 55, No. 21. These funds as received were to be placed
to the credit of a special fund, named the ?Treasury Bills
Account.? This has not been done. The first amount, �125,000,
having been applied in reduction of the deficit?a double breach
of confidence ! The amount realised under these sales was to be
applied to pay the interest as well as principal of such Treasury
Bills.


N.B. The amount realised by the Real Estate transferred
by the Government to the Municipal Council of Brisbane to
enable them to raise funds to build the bridge, and re-transferred
to the Government at what was most probably an increased value.
The amount, so far as I can see, does not appear to the credit of
the bridge or any other fund, although the amount paid,
�120,945, is added to the deficit.
I shall confine my figures to the smallest number necessary
to prove my case, and refer any of my readers having the
curiosity and patience necessary to the official statements. I will
first state how the ? Financial Juggle? referred to by Mr. Nelson
was accomplished.
I trust from my foregoing statements that my readers will
have realised the financial position of the colony ; and now for
the remedy which 1 propose for the consideration of the people.
The remedy may appear at first sight rather drastic, but
? desperate cases require desperate remedies,? and as there will be
ample time to consider and discuss these from every point of view
before the general election, I trust and hope that any objections
and prejudices which may at first sight suggest themselves
may be overcome and removed, and that we shall have
a radical change in our financial and general policy adopted
under new leaders, and a new and thoroughly representative
Assembly will open up an era of prosperity which will place this
colony in the position to which, from her unexampled resources,
she is entitled, and that by the adoption of a new system of
financial policy we may set the other Australian colonies a good
example and render our own colony independent of outside capital,
except such as will naturally be attracted by sound and paying
investments which will furnish permanent and profitable
employment to a large and increasing population, which will place
Queensland at the head of the future Australian Republic. I
don?t think the term ? Commonwealth? suitable for the occasion,
and suggest this for future consideration.
Remedies Proposed.
? Before entering on my new proposals I will call attention to
those which I have already advocated, with regard to which I
have not seen any reason to alter my views. I will give the
preference to Irrigation and Water Conservation, with regard to-
which I claim to be one of the pioneers, having persistently and
consistently advocated these questions since my arrival in the
colony, eight years ago, by public lectures and through the Press.
I shall confine myself at present to giving an extract from my
pamphlet, ? The Second Chapter of Revelations? (p. 11), summing
up the results which I anticipate from a financial point of view:?
Irrigation and Water Conservation.
Before entering into this part of the question, the writer


distinctly and unreservedly states, as that with a
Bill such as he can propose, properly and honestly worked, a
royalty for the concession of water privileges with the increased
value of land and facility for sale will, in the course of a few years,
pay the whole revenue requirements of the colony and furnish
fund for the gradual extinction of the debt. This looks a big thing
to promise, but it is a fact ?and not a theory.
The carrying out of this plan would cause an immense influx
of capital and give employment for along period to many thousands
of people, besides holding out attractions to the right sort of
settlers who will all bring more or less capital into the Colony.
I am prepared to go into particulars with any one who may
question the correctness of my views through the public Press.
A tax on personal annual expenditure as a substitute for an income
tax, which will remove the objections and demoralising effect of
the latter. I have advocated this for several years without having
had any tangible objection made to it so far.
The Civil Service Expenditure.
Sympathising as I do with the civil servants, who may well
say, ? Save me from my friends,? the persistent attacks made on
them by the general public as offering room for a large amount of
retrenchment, must have convinced them that a full inquiry with
this object cannot be delayed longer than the next Parliament, so
they will have time to prepare for it. The late motion of Mr.
Chas. Powers has opened the way, and he has stated several of
their grievances, but too late for any action in this session, which
is just as well, as the House after the next election will be in a
position to deal with the question from an independent stand-
point, free from any pledges. The determined stand taken by their
-defenders and their grounds of defence have done their cause a great
deal of harm, and actually furnished their enemies with weapons
of attack. In the meantime, pending a thorough inquiry, if my
proposed substitute for an income tax should be adopted, it will
reach those members of the service who can afford to contribute
to the necessities of the financial position, from which every other
class of the community, with the exception of the members of the
?Civil Service, have suffered so severely, involving in so many cases
total ruin. I warn them to be prepared to submit to the inevitable
and bear in mind that ? necessity has no law.? We have a Civil
Service which, including allowances per schedule, amounts to
about �1,000,000 ?-two-thirds of amount of revenue from taxation,
or,two-sevenths of total revenue. '
I now come to the most important measure which I propose,
and urge my readers to give it their full and dispassionate
consideration. lam fully aware that it would have been too
radical to meet a moment's consideration from our present
'Government, being so decidedly opposed to their traditional policy


of making all our public works a Government monopoly. It
would also abolish a large amount of patronage so dear to the
official mind.
As all public works under Government control have been
grossly mismanaged and their patronage abused, more particularly
in the department with which I propose to deal, I believe I shall
have the sympathy, and I trust the support, of all classes of the
public.
To come to the point, I propose, ??To hand over all our
railways to a public company, to be formed in London, giving the
Queensland people the option of becoming shareholders.?
There would not be space, nor wmuld it be desirable in a small
pamphlet to go into details, the first object being to obtain the
approval of the plan, and succeeding in this to make it a ? test
question? with all candidates for election to our Assembly. One
of the main objections has been already removed by the sanction
given to public companies to build and work the railways under
the land-grant system. I shall, therefore, confine myself to the
result from a financial point of view.
Taking the stated net income of our railways for the
financial year ending June 80, 1892, as per official report at
�886,000. I propose to make this the basis of their value to a
public company. To pay 4 per cent the value would be
�9,650,000, which would reduce our funded debt by a similar
amount, and the annual interest, calculated at 4 per cent., by
�386,000 ! To pay 5 per cent, the value would be �7,720,000
with a reduction of a similar amount on our funded debt and on
annual interest �808,800! N.B. ?The return by Government
report, letter R, per cent, on cost price is �2 Bs. lid., say �2 4s.
I make it a shilling less on cost at �18,000,000.
The amount of purchase might be paid by cancelled bonds
or otherwise as might be most advantageous to the colony. The
railways to be taken over subject to an equitable adjustment of
any special claims on the part of railway officials, and stipulations
made with regard to employment of existing staff of employees
which would not interfere - with the independent action of
purchasers, who would most probably find it their interest to
retain the present staff, and probably in many cases at increased
pay. This would apply also to civil servants, who might be
thrown out of employment by the change. Another advantage
which would be gained by the adoption of my proposal would
arise from a reduction of work in the Civil Service by the transfer.
Remedy 5.
In transferring the railways to a company, the Government
could reserve to itself a certain amount of control as is done in
the old country ; also a contingent future interest above a cer-
tain profit. It is quite evident that it would be the interest of


the company to make the railways pay, which would lead to a
better understanding with the public by making their intereets
identical, which does not appear to be the case under the pre-
sent dictatorial management.
I trust the days of tinkering and cheeseparing are past, as
w'ell as the men who inaugurated the system, and that our now
men will have the courage and grasp of intellect to adopt
a bold and comprehensive financial policy.
There?s nothing to be gained by harking back on the errors
of the past. The charges of wasteful and reckless expenditure to
secure political influence, and the prostitution of this influ-
ence for personal purposes, have been discussed ?ad nauseam, ?
and are generally admitted, so the least said about the matter
the better. Not so with the men who have played the most pro-
minent parts in bringing about the present disastrous climax.
There?s an old saying, ?De mortuisnil nisi bonum still the dead
cannot escape the verdict of posterity. ? The evil which men do
lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.? So it
has always been ; posterity is not very charitable, and does not
make allowances for the failings and temptations of our public
men in passing their verdict, and the good which they have done
is often very late in being recognised.
REMEDY 6.
In dealing with the men at present under consideration, I
shall, do so charitably; they are both alive, and may live to redeem
their public errors in new positions. Sir Samuel W. Griffith is
dead politically, and has fallen into the groove for which his
talents have naturally fitted him. May he live lang to adorn his
new position. As a statesman and politician he has been a
decided failure ; he has played the role of an ?opportunist.?
He it was who inaugurated the system of reckless and extra-
vagant expenditure which has demoralised all classes, and his
recantation came too late to repair the damage. This will be
the great difficulty with which his successors will have to deal.
Out of his errors grew our present financial difficulties which
will take some time to repair. We have now to deal with Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith. Although not dead politically, I look on
him as being ? in articulo mortis,? and trust in the course of
events he may find it desirable to retire on his ? otiam cum
dignitate,? and recoup his health, and enjoy many years on his
native heather. I would rather not review his financial policy,
but leave him to be judged by the result. As a financier, he has
many admirers and believers, who will, perhaps, yet find that he
has been guided mainly by expediency, and has excused no
doubt many of his financial acts as having been justified on the
grounds of necessity. Posterity may probably pronounce a different
verdict. Sir Thomas got the credit for putting his foot down on
certain expenditure last year. He couldn?t help it, necessity com-
pelled him to.
