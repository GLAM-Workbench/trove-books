PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
It is a matter of interest in the history of the world at large, no
less than in that of the Australasian Colonies, that in the year 1770
Captain Cook landed in the neighbourhood of what has since
become the City of Sydney ; and the statue which adorns Hyde
Park, and looks over the beautiful region which he was the first
to discover, bears witness to the gratitude of the country to the
intrepid navigator who opened to mankind so fair a portion of the
world. Less than 100 years ago Captain Phillip reached the
shores of Port Jackson, with an expedition numbering 1,000
souls ; and from this beginning sprang not only the Mother Colony
of New South Wales, but also the other Colonies, which are fast
peopling the great Southern Continent. Until thirty years ago
the history of Australia was contained in that of New South
Wales, for from Sydney went forth the pioneers who first opened
up and populated the continent, penetrating further and further
away from the mother city, until the distance that separated
those settlers from her became so great that the Home Govern-
ment found it advisable to concede to them the right of self-
government. Victoria first separated in 1851, and Queensland
followed eight years after. Meanwhile the population and
importance of New South Wales had increased so far that, in
1855, it was considered that the colonists were fully capable of
managing their own affairs, and in 1856 the system of responsible
government was established under which we are now living.
By this timely concession the just discontent of the colonists was
allayed, and their loyalty to the English Crown —no less sincere
than that of any portion of Her Majesty’s dominions—was pre-
served unimpaired. The sad lesson of the previous century had
taught those at the head of affairs in England to conciliate by
justice and moderation a people whom the arrogance and oppres-
sion of former times would have alienated beyond recovery. If
the statesmen who guided Australia through this perilous crisis
found no opening for the career of a Washington, we may at least
be thankful that the annals of the Colony are free from the horrors
of a war of independence.


The franchise is based on manhood suffrage, and a measure has
lately, been passed which will tend still further to popularize the
already popular Government. By the Electoral Bill which was
passed in the last session of Parliament the number of Members
in the Legislative Assembly will be increased from 73 to 108.
It is probable that the Census, which will be taken in this as
well as in all the other Australian Colonies in the course of the
ensuing year, will show the population to number about 800,000
souls.
Upon the beauties of the Harbour and surroundings of the
city of Sydney it is unnecessary to enlarge, so widely are they
known and so generally recognized ; but as to the aspect of the
city itself, having begun to grow before the modern improvements
in the method of laying out cities had been introduced, it lacks
the wide streets and even regularity of more modern towns.
With regard to buildings, public and private, we need only
point to the collection of photographs of objects of interest in
and around Sydney exhibited by the Commission.
If facilities of communication may be taken as a fair test of
progressive tendencies, New South Whies cannot be considered
backward in proportion to the size of her territory. There are,
at the present time, 790J miles of Railway open.
The extension of the Southern line, opened on the Ist of
September, has brought Sydney 50 miles nearer to Melbourne,
and it is anticipated that by the close of the year this important
line will be extended to Albury, that is, within about 3 miles
of the terminus of the Victorian Railways. When this extension
is complete, the journey between the capitals of New South Wales
and Victoria will only occupy about 26 hours. At the same time
lines are being rapidly pushed on which will open up the great
districts lying to the north and west. At the present time the
Railway has been opened for traffic 228| miles to the north, and
251 miles to the west, while 340 miles on the west and 267 on the
north are in prepai’ation or projected. A model of the Lithgow
Valley Railway, generally known as the Zigzag, which will
be found among the New South Wales exhibits, illustrates
one of the most interesting feats of modern engineering, while
various other exhibits will indicate the apparatus in use on the
Government Railways.


In the adaptation of Steam Tramways to street traffic, New-
South Wales may claim to have taken the lead of the other
Colonies. A tramway line which was constructed from the
Redfern Railway Station to the centre of the city, in order
to afford easy access to the Sydney International Exhibition*
proved so successful an experiment that it was determined by the
Government to construct a system of tramways, similar to that
adopted with such success in the capital of Belgium, which would
connect the principal suburbs with the centre of the city. The
work has already been commenced, and it is estimated that when
it is completed the facilities for traffic will compare favourably
with those possessed by any European city. Among the exhibits
will be found specimens of the rails in use, and of a new method
of working the points, as well as some cars made in the Colony
from colonial materials.
While treating of means of communication in the metropolis,
we may direct attention to the model of the proposed high-level
girder bridge, to connect Sydney with the North Shore, exhibited
by Mr. Parrot. The advantage to be derived from the successful
completion of this difficult undertaking, in the shape of additional
facilities for traffic and the promotion of business, could hardly
fail to justify the large outlay necessary.
Communication with the country districts is effectively main-
tained also by a complete Postal and Telegraphic system, which
has of late been largely extended, and which will be further
improved as the work of Railway extension proceeds. There are
12,426 miles of Telegraph wire open in the whole Colony, and
Post Offices are established wherever the circumstances of the
people require it.
In passing to the subject of Mercantile Marine, we come to
treat of one of the greatest resources and most important indus-
tries of the Colony. Being provided with one of the finest
harbours in the world, and situated close to the great coal-fields
of Australia, Port Jackson is naturally fitted to become the centre
of the shipping trade in the South Seas. Natural facilities for
the formation of docks and wharves have been to some extent
taken advantage of, and the Eitzroy Dock and Mort’s Dock are
capable of receiving vessels of the largest size. Sydney is now
the terminus of four great lines of steamers, —the Peninsular and
Oriental, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company (whose


vessels arrive fortnightly), of the Pacific Steam Navigation Com-
pany, and the Torres Straits Mail Steamships. The new steamers
employed by the Orient Company are among the finest afloat, and
the “ Orient,” which made her first visit in the beginning of the
present year, ranks in point of size and power with the largest
vessels of mercantile marine. The Peninsular and Oriental
Company are also now sending their finest vessels to Sydney. The
fact that four such lines as these find sufficient inducement to
supply such a service demonstrates sufficiently the importance of
the Australian trade. Besides these four great Companies there
are seventeen principal local Companies, with vessels which, for
intercolonial trade, may be ranked with the lines just referred to.
The total amount of tonnage of ships visiting the harbour in
1879 was 1,268,377. The ship-building industry is increasing
rapidly,—49 vessels, amounting to 3,442 tons, having been built
in 1878; and as a proof of what has already been done, we may
point to the models exhibited in the New South Wales Court by
Mort’s Dock and Engineering Company, as well as to the shaft of
the s.s. “ Maitland,” the latter being of special interest.
It is impossible, in so brief a space, to convey an adequate
impression of the natural resources of the Colony. Although
population has increased with great rapidity, many years must
elapse before the vast tracts of country lying at a distance from
the coast are anything but sparsely populated ; and thus by far
the larger proportion of the country is still in the pastoral stage,
and the greatest source of wealth lies in the production of Wool.
Moreover, the country seems to be by nature specially adapted for
this industry. The increase in the number of sheep, in spite of a
late severe drought, has been rapid; and the returns for the year
ending March 31, 1880, show an increase of 6,923,661 on the
returns of the previous year—the total number of sheep in the
return for 1880 being 29,043,392. The yield of wool comprises
almost every variety in use, and is of uniformly good quality. In
fact, in this respect New South Wales has for many years held
the first place in the world ; and it is believed that, in the forth-
coming Wool Show, she will not fall short of her reputation.
According to the returns quoted above, there were, in March,
1880, 37,557 stockholders, owning 360,038 horses and 2,914,210
horned cattle.


Another enterprise has lately been formed which should greatly
benefit those engaged in pastoral pursuits. The success of the
“ Strathleven” experiment in conveying frozen meat to England,
and the favourable reception afforded to Australian meat in the
London market, in part justifies the hope that, before long, in the
exportation of meat from Australia to England, may be found
another source of wealth to the Colony.
But the natural course of progress in the history of a young
country is from the pastoral to the agricultural stage, and the
great problem which the statesmen of the Colony have for years
been endeavouring to solve is the settlement and population of
the country by its division into smaller agricultural holdings.
It has been frequently pointed out, but cannot be too strongly
insisted upon, that the first essential of prosperity in a young-
country, with a large territory at its disposal, is to bring that
territory under cultivation. When that is done, industries of a
spontaneous and healthy growth—and not nursed into unnatural
prominence—will spring up to supply the wants of the country
population. To attain this end, it is most desirable to secure the
immigration of a class of men whose knowledge and experience
would fit them to take advantage of the varieties of the climate
and the richness of the soil, by becoming prosperous farmers,
agriculturists, and wine-growers. As a further inducement, beyond
these natural advantages, land is procurable upon easy terms.
At present the agrarian system is founded on the principle of
“ free selection before survey”; but, for further information on
this subject, we refer our readers to the Land Laws of New
South Wales.
The area of land under cultivation is now steadily increasing.
In March, 1880, there were 39,918 holders of land, exclusive of
pastoral tenants, holding acres, of which 635,641
acres were under cultivation—l7,s7B,3B9 acres being enclosed,
though not under cultivation—showing an increase over the
return of the previous year. Maize is grown most successfully
in the Hawkesbury District, both the yield and the quality of
the grain being highly creditable; this may be tested by a
reference to the exhibit made by the district. The wheat grown in
the Western Districts of Bathurst and Orange, in the South-west
about Goulburn and Yass, and in the North in the neighbourhood
of Tamworth, is of fine quality.


By the great variety of vegetable products, the size of the
Colony and its many different climates are perhaps best illustrated.
The yield includes semi-tropical fruits and the fruits of the colder
latitudes in profusion. The County Cumberland seems specially
favourable to the growth of the Citrus tribe, the many varieties
■of which will be displayed at the forthcoming Fruit Show as a
special exhibit. The production of sugar in the Northern District
of the Clarence has already assumed great importance; and the
business carried on by the Colonial Sugar-refining Company,
which has its works on the Clarence River, is veiy large. The
quality of their produce may be tested by reference to their
exhibit. The fertility of the Clarence River District, and the
industry and energy of its inhabitants, is further illustrated by a
collective exhibit characteristic of the district. Tobacco is grown
here in considerable quantities; but the districts which produce
most tobacco in the Colony are those on the Hunter River. It is
much to be regretted that, owing to circumstances connected with
the differences of tariff in the two Colonies, this industry,—
although its growing importance is demonstrated by the extensive
scale upon which the works of the tobacco factories in Sydney are
carried on, —is, on the present occasion, almost unrepresented.
The Southern Districts, from Illawarra to the frontier, are best
adapted for dairy farming; and the district of Bega, which makes
an effective representative exhibit, is specially famous in this
respect. The wine-producing capabilities of Australia are fast
attracting the attention of the world ; and at the Paris Exhibition
the wines of New South Wales received the consideration which
they merit. Since that time they have fast been growing in
favour; and it is to be hoped that the excellent arrangements
made by the Commissioners for the Melbourne International
Exhibition, in order to subject wines sent to the Exhibition to the
judgment of the general public, may be effectual in dissipating the
remains of the unreasoning prejudice which at one time prevailed
against the wines of Australia.
Statistics taken a few years back showed that the number of
acres in New South Wales under cultivation for the growth of the
vine was 4,237, yielding 684,733 gallons. Of late years the
wine-growing industry has progressed with great rapidity. A
representative exhibit has been forwarded, which is not however
sufficient to indicate the great importance of this rising industry


—which the natural advantages of favourable soil and climate
must necessarily render, in course of time, one of the most
prominent in the Colony.
The subject of Fish Culture has of late attracted considerable
attention, and a Royal Commission has recently been engaged in
inquiring into the matter. Everything seems to point to the fact
that an abundance of fish might be supplied to the capital; and it
may be hoped that a new Company which has lately been organized
will be successful in satisfying a want which has long been felt.
The establishment of an Aquarium, for which the Garden Palace
affords ample room, would stimulate public interest in the matter
of Fish Culture. A collection of food fishes from the waters of
Port Jackson and the neighbourhood, exhibited by Mr. Ramsay,
Curator of the Australian Museum, should possess a considerable
interest.
In company with the last-named collection will be found
another, of the Birds indigenous to the Colony, made by the same
gentleman. A handsome private collection, comprising 150 speci-
mens of birds, exhibited by Mr. J. S. Bray, is also worthy of
special mention.
Perhaps the most interesting exhibit in the New South Wales
Court will be found in the display of Minerals. Collected and
arranged by able and' experienced officers, acting under the
direction of the Minister for Mines, they will convey a correct
impression of the vast mineral resources of the country in almost
all the metals;, and will, above all, attract attention to the
unequalled richness of the Coal-fields of New South Wales.
The extensive and complete collections from the Department of
Mines include specimens from all the principal Metalliferous
Districts and Coal-fields in the Colony. They have been arranged
in series, as follow :—Auriferous Rocks, reef quartz and alluvial;
Silver Ores; Copper Ores; Tin Ores, stream and lode; Iron Ores;
Coal and Kerosene Oil Shale; Antimony Ores; Lead, Bismuth, and
Mercury Ores; together with samples of Colonial Marbles, polished
and rough; Asbestos, and various minerals; and specimens of Sedi-
mentary and Igneous Rocks. In addition to these there is a large
collection of the characteristic fossils illustrative of the principal
Sedimentary Formations of New South Wales. The fossils have
been selected chiefly from the collections of the late Rev. W. B.
Clarke, and as many of them have been figured and described in

palaeontological publications now exhibited, they are of special
scientific value. They have been arranged according to the
several geological formations, viz.: Upper Silurian, Devonian,
Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Miocene, Pliocene,
Post Pliocene, and Recent. On the wall sj>ace, near the specimens,
are the various geological and other maps published by the
Department; and amongst them is exhibited, for the first time,
the Geological Map of New South Wales, constructed principally
from the original map of the late Dev, W. B. Clarke.
The above-mentioned collections, of which a detailed list will
be found in the accompanying catalogue, have been classified and
arranged by Mr. C. S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., Government Geologist,
Mr. John Mackenzie, F.G.S., Government Examiner of Coal-
fields, assisted by other officers of the Department of Mines. It
may be interesting to mention that the value of the Minerals
from the Colony of New South Wales, to the end of 1879, was as
follows:
Besides Trophies of Ingots of Copper, Tin, and Antimony, and
Obelisks representing in bulk the quantity of gold and silver
raised in this Colony, the Department of Mines exhibits a splendid
collection of polished samples of indigenous Woods, collected and
arranged by Mr. 0. Moore, F.L.S., Director of the Sydney Botanic
Gardens.
Amongst the Mineral Exhibits from private sources are some
of great importance. Several of the Coal-mining Companies have
sent very fine sections of Coal, showing the actual thickness of the
seams now worked on our Coal-fields. Mr. Herrenschmidt, and
also Messrs. Cook Brothers, exhibit samples of Star Antimony and
Antimony Ores from the Mines near Kempsey. The Great Cobar


Copper-mining Company, Copper Ores; Mr. Alexander Stuart,
M.P., Lode Tin and Bismuth, from New England; The Eskbank
Iron Company, trophy of Bar and Pig Iron, with Iron Ores ; the
New South Wales Shale and Oil Company, and the Australian
Kerosene Oil and Mineral Company, trophies of Australian Bog-
head Mineral or Kerosene Oil Shale ; Mr. M. Isaacsohn, a fine col-
lection of Gold Specimens, &c., from Nundle ; Mr. W. H. Suttor,
Gold; Mr. H. L. Beyers, M.P., Gold, from Hill End; Messrs. J.
Hurley, M.P., and J. Shepherd, M.P., auriferous and argentiferous
Ores; Australian Asbestos Company, Gundagai, Asbestos, &c. ;
Professor Liversidge, a valuable collection of Gems ; Mr. H. Cope-
land, M.P., Quartz Crystals; Mr. John Lucas, M.P., Stalactites,
from Binda Caves ; Mr. Brown, Building-stones, from Maitland ;
Mr. Gibbs, Elag-stones, from Wagga; Messrs. Deer Brothers,
Copper Ores, from Frogmore; Mr. E, Rudder, Galena, &c., from
Kempsey ; besides other interesting exhibits, which will be found
described in the accompanying catalogue.
The Manufacturing Industries of the Colony are of the highest
importance; but, in view of the great disparity which exists
between the fiscal policies of the two Colonies, it has been found
impossible to procure a fitting representation of this department.
In a country in which Manufactures are not created as a
desirable end in themselves, but are left to grow up naturally
when and where the circumstances of the people require them,
little regret need be felt at the absence of an imposing list of
names, when compensated for by the solid, though less showy,
advantages of what is held to be a sounder system. The natural
growth of a tree may be slower than that of a hot-house plant,
but the tree is deeply-rooted, healthy, and lasting.
In 1878 the total number of works and manufactures was
13 892 11,033 of which were carried on in connection with
agricultural pursuits. This may help to confirm what has already
been stated, namely, that by taking advantage of the natural
resources of the country and extending the area of land under
cultivation, the interests of manufacturing industries will best be
promoted.
We would point specially* to the show of manufactures in
Leather, made by Messrs. Alderson & Son and others, which in
itself affords a proof of the importance of this industry and
of the success of the labour which is brought to bear upon it.


The same difficulty in regard to the different commercial policies
of the two Colonies has prevented any representation of the
extensive manufactories of furniture, clothing, and other articles
of this kind. It is to he regretted, also, that the numerous
breweries and carriage manufactories are, for the same reason,
almost unrepresented. Samples have fortunately been supplied of
the good work done by the enterprising firms of Messrs. Hudson
and Mr. Wearne.
With regard to the Intellectual progress of the Colony,—the
question of National Education has of late years been the subject
of considerable discussion and most important legislation. It will
suffice, in this short resume , to state that, by the Public Instruc-
tion Act passed during last session of Parliament, the Council of
Education has been abolished, and the whole of the system of
Primary Instruction has been placed under a Minister for Public
Instruction, The Bill, which is mainly due to the foresight and
ability of the Honorable Sir Henry Parkes, K.C.M.C., Colonial
Secretary, provides also for the establishment of High or Grammar
Schools for both sexes, in all the principal centres of population
throughout the Colony, as an intermediate stage between the
Primary Schools and the University. The whole educational
fabric is crowned by the University of Sydney, which was incor-
porated in 1851, and seven years afterwards was placed on the
same footing as the Universities within the United Kingdom. A
Chancellor, Yice-Chancellor, and elective Senate of sixteen mem-
bers constitute the governing body; the studies are directed
by seven professors and lecturers. The endowment amounts
to an income of <£5,000 per annum. A reference to the University
Calendar will show that considerable sums have been given by
private individuals for annual and other prizes, and a munificent
bequest of £lOO,OOO was a few months ago bestowed by the will
of the late Mr. Challis.
The Technical or Working Men’s College affords by its display
of work substantial proof that the mechanics of Sydney are not
behindhand in higher education. The exhibits of the Royal
Society of New South Wales, and the valuable display made by
the Government Printer, supply sufficient evidence of the diffusion
of superior knowledge; while the public taste for learning is
borne witness to by the fact that the present Public Library, though
by no means a small building, has been found insufficient, and a


new Library on a larger scale is about to be commenced. In
considering the part taken by the Colony in Art, the great
difficulties which must necessarily beset a young country in
this pursuit must receive full consideration, together with the
irreparable loss of the advantage derived from the study of great
masters. It is, however, undisputed that a decided tendency to
improvement in artistic taste has of late and the
creditable efforts made by a new Art Society, in spite of its
recent foundation, to be well represented, is an earnest of a desire
to excel.
To those who have watched the progress of the Colony it must
be apparent that, in the last three or four years, its prosperity
has advanced with rapid strides. The seed sown with so much
toil and labour in past time is now producing a harvest, the
full richness of which we have yet to enjoy. In great natural
resources, and almost boundless mineral wealth, lie the best
securities of a great future ; while some proof of the fact that
the inhabitants of New South Wales are not unworthy of the
bounties which Nature has bestowed on their country is to be
found in the surprising quickness and energy which, in preparing
the late Sydney International Exhibition in so short a time,
accomplished a feat which might well have been considered
impracticable. Although it might be somewhat exacting to
demand a display equal to that in the .New South Wales Court
of the Garden Palace after so short an interval, it will at least
be allowed that, in her contribution to the success of the Melbourne
International Exhibition, New South Wales has not been forgetful
of her own reputation, or of the lively interest which she must
always feel in the wellbeing of the Sister Colony.


{Reprinted from the Sydney Morning Herald.\
THE EXPORT PRODUCE OP XE¥ SOUTH WALES AND
VICTORIA IN 1879.
The Victorian Department of Trade and Customs has recently issued
a number of valuable documents respecting the imports and exports of
that Colony during the last eight years. One of them deals specially
with exports the produce of the Colony alone, and classifies these under
a few leading heads. For the purpose of an exact comparison between
New South Wales and Victoria, we have collected similar particulars
from our own trade returns for the year ended on the 31st of last
December, and re-arranged the whole in the form given below. In re-
gard to our mineral exports an important correction had to be applied.
The gold received from Queensland and elsewhere is coined at the Sydney
Mint, and then returned in our exports as coin the produce of this
Colony. That is misleading, for the coin is worth only a fraction more
than the gold. Altogether our export of gold in bullion and specie last
year was valued at £696,803, against an import of £1,067,015 in gold-
dust alone. Part of this gold-dust was retained in the Colony, and
another part was coined and re-exported. To correct for this error we
have taken the export value of gold the produce of this Colony at
£400,000, which is probably not far from the truth • a similar correction
is made for tin imported as ore and re-exported as ingots. The follow-
ing statement exhibits the principal sources of our wealth, side by side,
and their relative proportions for the two Colonies. We have added a
statement of the revenue of each Colony for the year ended on the 30th
of last June, divided into the three principal heads of taxation, territorial
income, and receipts on account of the general Government Services.
The particulars are taken from the official Gazette statements, and the

All political economists assume that upon the average of years the ex-
ports of a country must pay for its imports. The difference is designated
“the balance of trade,” and when that balance is against any country for a
considerable term of years such country is supposed to be retrograding in
material wealth. From many representations of the trade of this Colony,
of the other Colonies, and of the United Kingdom, submitted in recent
issues, our readers will perceive that this doctrine requires a complete and
accurate statement of facts for its full vindication, and that the usual
trade returns furnished by the Customs authorities must be analysed and
carefully rearranged, in order to represent the truth. For instance, the
exports of a country are put down at the estimated value in the place of
exportation, and the imports are valued at the importers’ and not the
exporters’ prices, between which there may be, and usually is, a very
great difference. International trade demands that international returns
should be kept upon a uniform standard, so as to afford adequate data
for estimating the intrinsic value of produce, the cost of transit, and the
profits of interchange. The world is as yet a long way from arriving at
such a uniform standard, and all that can be done by political economists
meanwhile is to take the facts as they appear, and apply such corrections
as the general conditions of trade may indicate as approximately
accurate.
In another column of to-day’s issue we give a statement of the exports
of New South Wales and Victoria for last year, confined in each case to
articles of local production, adding also the value of the re-export pro-
duce, the value of the total imports in return, and some particulars of
the sources and amount of annual revenue. The classification of
produce follows certain official returns recently published in Victoria, and
may prove useful just now to merchants and public men. During last
year New South Wales sent abroad produce of her own territory of the
value of £10,381,885, and Victoria produce valued only at £8,069,857.
Man for man, therefore, this Colony exported produce to the value of
£l4 10s. 9fd., and Victoria to the value of only £9 Is. 4|d., a difference
of more than one-half in our favour. Turning to the particulars of this
total export trade, it will be observed that pastoral produce made up
four-fifths of our entire exports, but only half the exports of Victoria ;
that our minerals were equal to one-sixth of the whole, against more than
one-fifth from that source in Victoria; that agricultural produce was
nearly equal, without being high in the two Colonies; and that under
manufactures and miscellaneous produce the Victorian exports were
equal to nearly one-ninth of the whole, and ours to one-thirtieth. In
comparison with the great staple of wool, in both Colonies, all other


exports are far in the background. The New South Wales wool crop
was worth £6,491,198, and the Victorian £3,564,721. As might be
expected, from the growth of population and smaller territory, our
Southern neighbours are less dependent upon wool than they were
formerly ; but New South Wales is more dependent upon this source of
wealth than ever before during her whole history. Would it be too
much for the State to require a rent for the use of its pastoral lands, on
which thirty million head of sheep are feeding, equal to about half a
million per annum, when our annual wool clip alone is worth thirteen
times that amount, and the meat, leather, tallow, &c., are worth two
millions more, leaving out the whole quantity locally consumed? Yet
the State had 208,177 square miles of territory under the five years’
pastoral tenure last year for a gross rental of only £162,550. Add the
value of pastoral produce locally consumed, and the value of the year’s
increase of stock to the value of produce exported and the conclusion is
inevitable that, after making the amplest allowance for stock fed on free-
hold land, the rental for the use of Crown land is ridiculously out of all
proportion to the income shared by the Crown lessees.
Under the head of mineral produce Victoria has scarcely anything to
export but gold ; and though there has been a great falling-off in that of
late years, the net export is still valued at £2,210,177. In New South
Wales there has also been a great reduction in the production of gold,
which is now worth less than half a million sterling per annum. There
are indications that this will soon be reversed, and that New South
Wales will become more largely gold-producing than ever. Apart from
that, her coal, copper, tin, and iron deposits give her the first place in
variety, as they will eventually in magnitude, of mineral wealth. Where
iron and coal are, manufactures should be, and in time will be; but
that contingency is mainly dependent upon the growth of population.
At present Victoria, according to the returns we are using, is exporting
manufactured articles and miscellaneous produce at the rate of £1 Os.
l|d. per head of her population, and New South Wales at the rate of
9s. lljd. per head—a difference partly owing to Victoria’s greater con-
centration of population, and possibly, also, partly owing to her protec-
tionist duties. It is reasonable to suppose that Victorian manufac-
turers, having sold the bulk of their produce at high prices to Victorian
consumers, may be in a position to send their surplus stock to free-trade
markets at whatever prices they can get, just as American manufacturers
flooded Canada a year or two ago. But what are the principal articles
of Victorian manufactures ? Refined sugar is at the head of the list, at a
value of £144,721 ; and there New South Wales surpasses her with a


value of £184,951. In boots and shoes Victoria stands at £48,906, and
New South Wales at £47,759; in saddlery and harness, Victoria at
£14,244, and New South Wales at £15,849 ; in carriages, carts, &c.,
Victoria at £8,284, and New South Wales at £10,840; in colonial
spirits, Victoria at £756, and New South Wales at £12,829. In these
branches of manufacture the free-trade Colony is ahead of her neighbour.
The principal articles in which Victoria leads are apparel and slops, made
chiefly by cheap female labour, to the value of £189,607; machinery,
£50,929; stearine, £37,566; stationery, books, and paper, £37,466;
hardware and ironware, £32,988 ; furniture, £28,604 ; woollen manu-
factures, £28,155; biscuits, £26,779, and not another article amounting to
as much as £20,000. While our pastoral exports for the year exceeded
those of Victoria absolutely by three-and-a-half millions sterling, the Vic-
torian export of manufactures exceeded ours by less than half-a-million
sterling absolutely, and by a much less sum relatively. For this result
Victorians had to pay ad valorem duties to the amount of £275,527,
from which New South Wales was free. Those ad valorem duties must
have increased the prices of the local produce by a corresponding amount,
because they did not kill importation, and the consumers of Victoria had
to pay probably four times as much as the whole value of their manufac-
tured exports. A nation which nurses a few pet industries on such
terms must be very rich to escape ruin. The United States has kept on
this game for years, because of their vast and rich territory, their
immense natural resources, and their unparalleled increase of population.
The Australian Colonies might repeat the experiment without national
bankruptcy, but not without national injury. Free trade between com-
munities is as important as free trade between the individuals of one
community; and the policy of selfishness and monopoly will no more
pay in one case than in the other. Protection means high prices, and
high prices mean hard times for the poor man, whatever they may mean
for the rich man.
