Not hands round, but hearts together
Linked as friends
Heady for whatever weather
Fortune sends ;
Storms the mighty peoples smiting,
Our’s more firmly still uniting.
2. fi
In the radiant Future ever,
Be our aim,—
With magnanimous endeavour
Still the same ;
Each regarding each as brother,-
Standing loyal to each other.
3.
Heirs of one great Fame unbroken,
Flowing down ;
I’eople of one Language spoken
Of one Crown ;
Of one Crown which trackless ocean,
Names in thunders of devotion.
4.
Of one mighty Queen whose glory i
Is our own ;
Thro’ whose hero-peopled story 1
Are we known ;
Known as of that Race whose power
Shapes to-day the coming hour.
In these lands so rich and ample,
Bright and fair;
Shall w'e not by such example
I)o and dare ?

Dare what makes her so>'s vie- J
