THE
NURSE’S CORN FLOUR
Recipe Book
1936 Edition
CONTAINING 60 ENTIRELY NEW RECIPES
READ THIS INTERESTING LETTER . . .
I've had particularly good results with
my cooking since I've been using Nurse's
Corn Flour, and nearly every day I find
some new way to use it.
I find that if I use some Nurse's Corn
Flour as well as ordinary flour for cakes
and pastry, I get my cakes very much
lighter and shorter I'm specially proud
of my feather-weight sponges.
And I've been making the most delicious
cold sweets —things like lemon snow and
butter scotch cream. They are so easy to
make with Nurse's Corn Flour, and they
hardly take any time to set. And for
custards and sauces, you won't find
anything so rich and creamy as this special
Corn Flour.
I like to use as much Nurse's Corn Flour
as I can, because it is so easily
digested and nourishing.
