SIDNEY NOLAN
FOREWORD
Sidney Nolan, bom at Melbourne, in 1917, is known in Australia as
one of that country?s most gifted artists. His last exhibition of Central
Australian paintings, held at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, was
regarded as one of the most important events in the history of Australia?s
painting. His work has already attracted attention in Paris where it
was shown last year under the direction of UNESCO. M. Jean Cassou,
Director of the Paris Museum of Modern Art, writes of these paintings
as ?the work of a true poet and true painter. With Nolan?s exhibition
Australian painting appears as a revelation. He has astonishing
imagination and gifts of imagery and he creates in us a wonder of some-
thing new being born.?
* * * *
Australian culture is at a cross roads, perhaps the most important
it has yet faced. We have emerged from the ?colonial? stage, when
everything Australian was measured by its resemblance to the more
familiar patterns of ?Home.? We have been forced to come to terms
with our geographical and economic environment; we have an attitude
recognisably our own. But we still lack roots ?that confidence and
understanding which come from patient probing of our accumulated
inheritance.
Our way of living is modified by an environment in many respects
unique; yet we are inheritors of that long experiment in human living
which is the culture of Western Europe.
The natural reaction from colonialism ?the rejection of every-
thing not directly Australian ?gets us nowhere. The rejection of
European tradition does not make us more at home in a profoundly
strange landscape. For landscape, as Sir Kenneth Clark has lately
suggested, is not something objective, but something assimilated. It is
?recreated in our imagination to reflect our moods: it contributes to
an idea which we call nature.?
The time has come when we must look at this tradition in terms
of our own country, rather than at our own country in terms of the
tradition. We must neither repudiate this tradition, in which lie our
roots and from which we can constantly draw refreshment, nor repine
against our environment which has also become a part of ourselves.
Our uniqueness lies in being a European people in an Australian
setting, and our opportunity to contribute to world?s history lies in
facing boldly both sides of our inheritance and making our own
synthesis. To this synthesis I believe the work of Sidney Nolan will
make a notable contribution.

SYLVIA GOSSE
R.8.A., R.E., F.R.S.A.
FOREWORD
The name of Gosse is rare enough, so that when we see Sylvia Gosse?s
signature for the first time on a picture, or printed in a catalogue, the
memory of Edmund Gosse comes to mind. It is therefore no surprise
to learn that this famous woman painter is a daughter of the late
celebrated critic, poet and essayist. Edmund Gosse was wise enough
to be a civil servant. He made his living working for the Board of
Trade by day, while he spent his evenings and weekends as a literary
artist, later becoming librarian to the House of Lords.
From her earliest days Sylvia Gosse saw the famous men of her
father's generation come and go in the home at Paddington where she
was born. The house was in the part of the city where the Grand
Union Canal supplies a waterway for business of various kinds in the
district. One branch of the canal leads into Paddington Station and
one passes through Maida Vale and Regent?s Park, and gives to that
corner of the city in which are still to be seen some fine old houses of
early Victorian days, an old world atmosphere. In one of these houses
Browning lived, and was a neighbour and frequent visitor at the
Gosses? home.
The canalisation of the water imparts to that particular milieu
tranquillity, broken from time to time by the slow passage to and fro
of picturesque barges, boats which are amongst the few colourful
carriers reminding us of pre-railway days. That quarter seems a fit
meeting place in which a literary man should have lived, the world
of writers congregated and a painter been born.
Amongst the outstanding people who foregathered at the Gosse
soirees were Swinburne, Hardy, Meredith, Dobson, Le Gallienne and,
as stated, Browning. Walter Pater also came, but Sylvia Gosse tells us
that George Moore, Thomas Hardy and Henry James are the three
authors best remembered by her because she saw a great deal of them
when she was mature enough to appreciate their gifts and conversation.
There were also painters in those assemblies. Mrs. Edmund Gosse
painted and was a pupil of Ford Madox Brown, while her sister was
married to Sir Alma Tadcrna. Sir Max Beerbohm was to be seen there
too, as we might guess when we recall his famous caricature of Edmund


Gosse and Austin Dobson sitting on government department office stools
busily composing ballads during office hours. When Sickert is added
to the list we realise the origin of definite influences.
The foregoing is enough to show that to be brought up and bathed
in such an atmosphere was enough to drive any sensitive child into the
world of art. Sylvia, following her mother?s inclinations, chose to be a
painter, while her brother embraced their father?s leanings by becoming
a distinguished author whose books on pirates have entertained many a
?Penguin? reader, while he is also known as a naturalist. Such is the
family background of the distinguished artist whose pictures are
represented here and have been exhibited in many galleries in London,
the provinces and abroad.
Sylvia Gosse was not educated by being sent to the usual schools.
Under her parents? care she was taught at home by governesses and
tutors until the age of fifteen, when she went to live in an English
colony, and attended an English school, in the old French town of
Dinan, on the river Ranee, then reached by diligence from the port
of St. Malo. Up to this period she had always drawn, being chiefly
entranced by the subject of pet animals, a number of which were always
harboured in her parents? home. At Dinan she first came in touch
with the serious business of painting still life under a French painter
employed by the school.
Returning to London, she made up her mind to take her studies
seriously by attending the St. John?s Wood Art School, then under the
direction of W. Q. Orchardson?s son. There she studied until her work
was approved by the R.A. schools and she was admitted as a pupil at
Burlington House, where she worked hard for three years. Desiring
a thorough training, she was allowed another two years. While at the
school she was more or less under a different R.A. or A.R.A. painter
each month, as is the custom. The teachers who impressed Sylvia
Gosse most were George Clausen and Ouless, who were good talkers as
compared to Sargent, who was quite inarticulate. Nevertheless, well
grounded in her job though she was, she left the R.A. schools without
knowing what she wanted to paint, a predicament so many others
have faced.
At that time Sickert had become a frequent visitor at her father?s
Sunday evening gatherings. He took an interest in Sylvia Gosse and
seeing her drawings suggested etching as a suitable expression. This
branch of the graphic arts she immediately followed and continued
for many years. In due time she became a distinguished etcher whose
prints have found their way into many private collections. Campbell
Dodgson, for long the curator of the Print Room at the British Museum,


had several of her drawings and prints bought for the national collec-
tion. Her one-man shows at the Colnaghi Gallery and elsewhere
have since established her name firmly as an eminent exponent of the
medium.
But we are going a little too fast. Sylvia Gosse's meeting with
Sickert had other momentous results. When they were first associated
he was teaching at the L.C.C, school at Westminster. He later gave
up that job to form a school at Rowlandson House in Hampstead Road,
where he and Miss Knox were partners. The latter, becoming Mrs.
Carfax, gave up teaching and Sickert asked Sylvia Gosse to become
his partner, a compliment to underline since it is well known that he
was a most discriminating man in the matter of artistic taste and
knowledge. The names ?Sickert and Gosse? thereafter formed the
school sign.
Of Sickert?s methods of teaching Sylvia Gosse speaks highly. It
may be news to many readers that while drawing from life the pupil
was taught to think of the drawing in terms of a later picture. All
were advised to square up their drawings at home, enlarge them and
paint pictures of them. While at work out of doors his advice was to
make quick sketches and note the colours on each sketch to enable the
student to observe and memorise better. That was his regular method,
which Sylvia Gosse has almost consistently followed. At the outbreak
of the 1914-18 war the school closed down, and she has not been
connected with any school since.
Sylvia Gosse says she has never had what is technically called a
?studio.? Whatever room she works in is always a living-room; a
place, that is to say, where her model or sitter may sit in the normal
surroundings of ordinary life. She makes it a habit to paint and think
of people as being at home, since her chief interest in human beings
is to depict them at their domestic occupations; at work or at leisure,
in their urban or rural existence. In all she does her thought is con-
temporary and even her still lifes are composed of the dishes, furniture
and ornaments with which she is in daily contact. That mode of seeing,
thinking and contemplating is the key to all she paints, and if we wish
to understand her work and enjoy it more we have to grasp that her
art is domestic, be the subject indoors or out of doors. The virtue of
her vision lies in her capacity to see the commonest actions of our
diurnal duties with a fresh eye and a quick memory. There is a simul-
taneity about her pictures, a feeling as though the moment she depicts
on her canvases happened at the minute she painted it, no matter what
time elapsed between the incident and its recording.
Her first studio in which she worked for some years was a long
room over Grimble?s vinegar factory near the Cumberland haymarket ;


?a room with three windows, 5 ? as she says, ?along the street side, which
must have been the drawing-room of the original Grimble family in
the days when people lived over their shops. It was pervaded by the
delicious scent of hot vinegar, and great wagons laden high with
steaming grain used to rumble out under my windows. It looked
across at a long row of beautiful little one-storied William IV houses
?now, I think, destroyed.? By these words we see that rooms in
which she works must be accustomed to the lives of people; she likes
the feel of the hearth and habitation.
Sylvia Gosse has been for long a noted member of the Royal
Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, and a regular exhibitor at
the R.A. and provincial galleries. Her paintings, drawings and prints

VERA CUNINGHAM
FOREWORD
It would be untrue to say that the profound artist is hardly ever super-
ficially charming. There have been moments in history when the
most important thing to be said could be said in terms of the Noble
(see Raphael) the Graceful (see Watteau) or even (see Matisse) the
merely Elegant. But to-day is not one of those moments. Vera
Cuningham is intensely serious, and the dark unease that besets every
serious person becomes more and more apparent in her work as she
becomes more articulate: she knows that the artist of to-day must
concern himself, not with what the eye sees but with?with what?
I am not shirking my responsibilities in refusing to answer that
question. It can only be answered by the drawings in this exhibition.
They are extraordinary drawings sometimes difficult, sometimes
uncouth, but always passionate and profound. They are the out-
pourings of a mind groping for wisdom about what lies beneath the
surface.
It is easy to cling to the surface. Vera Cuningham has done so
herself in the past. The groping for deeper truths began later. At
first I found it alarming, even forbidding; but as my own under-
standing of what she is endeavouring to do increased, and as her own
ways of expressing this new kind of experience became more assured,
I began to find her drawings and paintings among the most moving
and satisfying that are being produced in England to-day. Restless
and tragic they may be, but to have discovered, after much trial and
a certain amount of error, a formal means of conveying that tragic
restlessness is a considerable achievement. It puts her among the little
company of poets whose names will be remembered long after the
prosaists have been forgotten.
Eric Newton.
