LEGENDS OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES SCULPTURED IN CLAY.
William Ricketts.
* FOREWORD:
"Many of the ideas formulated by my ancient fathers may seem to an enlightened
age fantastic and absurd, but to us. these ideas are the foundation of a structure and
edifice of knowledge under whose shadow we live to-day. says David Umapon, the
well-known Aboriginal writer and scholar.
That there is one at least among the white men of our so-called "enlightened age,
who feels that these ancient ideas are neither "fantastic" nor "absurd, but fulll of a
deep spiritual message to our generation, is shown by these clay sculptures of William
Ricketts, of Mt. Dandenong.
For several years now he has gained, through the works of Sir Baldwm Spencer.
David Uniapon. and other gatherers of our Aboriginal a deep insight into
the religious life of these primitive people. He has found that their spiritual conception
of Nature and Lite was more closely akin to his own innate conviction that every bush s
aglow with God." than the materialistic conception of many of his white contemporaries
of this "Machine Age" to whom
" ?A primrose by a river's brim
A yellow primrose is to him,
And nothing more."
His work is, therefore, a powerful sermon to regain that intuitive spiritual insight
that senses the Divine behind each natural object and each manifestation of Nature s
forces. This insight, as shown by their legends, the Aboriginal Australians possessed
to a very high degree, unlike too many of their white successors.
As a natural corollary to this sense of the divine or supernatural in Nature.
William Ricketts Is sensitive to an extraordinary degree to the suffering endured by
animal, bird and plant life at the hands of man. especially the thoughtlessly cruet,
self-seeking, and ?money-grubbing 11 white man. The trapping of the gentle furry wild
things of the bush to bedizen women with furs; the wanton shooting of birds; the
needless telling of beautiful age-old trees, and the hideous ruin of both and
animal lite through bush-tires, often begun through sheer carelessness, till him with a
raging sorrow and a flaming anger that he cannot put into words, but must express in
some way.
- , - V) ? , . ?
That way is by sculpturing in clay the legends of the ancient Australians, whose
folk-lore shows clearly that, however primitive their life was, they did feel the divine
behind the common things of life, and therefore they felt the comradeship between
their human lite and the plant and animal life around them.

While not minimising the heroic work of our white Australian pioneers in creating
a modern nation out of a wilderness, Picketts, with his ardent sympathy for the black
man?s point of view, cannot feel that "the taming of this country has made our past
all glorious." as was said recently. He rightly knows that our white race was guilty
* This foreword and the conclusion have been repeated (at Mr. Rickett's request)
from a former catalogue.


of much horrible and wanton cruelty towards the black men whom we have ousted
from their sacred tribal hunting grounds, where every natural feature and every stone
and tree meant as much to them as the cathedra! stones of England mean to the
English folk. We have utterly failed, as a nation, to consider as sacred, anything
that they regarded sacred.
? Looking back into this age of a "pre-white" Australia, the artist feels that in
comparison with our present highly sophisticated and commercialised Australian civili-
zation, it was an age of human Innocence and purity which the white man has
ruthlessly destroyed.
To him. his work is a Heaven-sent mission, that will help to substitute public
understanding and sympathy for ignorance and indifference towards the remnants of the
black tribes: and, lead at last to some form of national restitution by insisting that,
those as yet untouched by white influence, will remain so, and be free to carry on
their ancient tribal life and customs, in the lands that are sacred to them; and that
the de-tribalised ones be also properly cared for by a kindlier people who want to
make amends for an evil past, and, who feel that they can learn much spiritually from
a primitive people. His work is therefore a truly national work.
Thus William Ricketts, by his "legends in clay," is making the black man the
missionary to the white man, to preach again the universal brotherhood of all living
things. In a world torn and shattered by the fiendish super-inventions of the white
man, this gentle preaching has the quality of the "still small voice of God," after
the "passing of the whirlwind and the earthquake."
Turning now to the legends that he has depicted in his sculptures, we find that the
Aboriginal legends of the "creation of all things" have had a special appeal fo him,
and one cannot do better than quote David Uniapon's own vivid version of his
"ancient fathers' " belief on this subject :
"At the beginning of creation, Man was present in spirit, and with spirit vision
beheld the wonderful transformation of Life coming out of the slimy water, over-
shadowed with dense atmosphere and heat. The first of the Spirit Life to select
bodies of flesh and blood were the lower orders and kin gd oms of the earthly spirit,
which consisted of such forms and shapes as those demonstrated In the varieties and
diversities of fish, reptiles, lizards, animals and insect life?creatures evolved by the
power of their intelligence and capacity, according to their own fancy?each species
considering itself superior to the others. As observed, some were walking, crawling,
hopping, wriggling and flitting on the surface of the earth, and some were swimming
and paddling and floating in the water, and making a wonderful array of body shapes
and forms. . . . When the appointed period arrived, Spirit Man made the great
decision and adventure to be clothed with earthly body of flesh and blood. His
spirit consciousness experienced a great change, tor he was overshadowed by another
se If?the subjective consciousness, which entirely belongs to the earth, and not to the
Sacred Realm of Spirit, the Father of all Mankind?Eternal Home. He began to
realise that the spirit self was controlled by an earthly subjective consciousness, which
bou nd him to earth's environment, with all Its blessings, disappointments, discomfort,
and its pain and sorrow. Being a stranger to a strange land, he found It difficult to
adapt himself to Earth's environs. His spirit self began to fret and pine for its
Heavenly Home. The living creatures of the earth saw his plight, and were moved
with pity and with sympathy. They gathered around him, and by their knowledge and
instinct, taught man how to seek a shelter in a tree-top or within a cave, and warned
him of approaching danger of storm and hail and rain.
And thus did Man's subjective consciousness grow in wisdom and in knowledge,
from instruction of earthly creatures ?the kangaroo, emu, goanna, and the insect life
the beetle, the spider and the ant. Thus all the tribes of Aborigines of Australia
have, from time immemorial, selected living creatures for companions and guides.
This is Totemism, one of the most ancient customs of primitive man?the companionship
of earthly creatures ?each tribe having its own particular animal totem?thus we have
the tribes of the kangaroo men, the emu men and the lizard men, and so on."


EXHIBITS.
No. I.?"My Country."? This piece is rightly placed as the first of all these
exhibits, for it is vibrant with Ricketts' deep love for Australia?not only the presen
Australia of the white man, but also the Australia of the immemorial past ot the
native folk.
He has modelled the white man with his own features, not as a self-portrait,
or for any purpose of self-glorification, but simply because, as he says, he was
the most convenient white model available, and also because he himselt is so
passionately seeking to bridge the terrible gap between the white and the aboriginal
Australian?a gap created by over a century and a half of lack of understanding
sympathy and. often, complete indifference on the part of the majority of
white men to the native folks' tragic fate of being slowly but surely eliminated before
the advance of his so-called superior civilization.
Here in this, shall we say, prophetic piece, the white Australian sprung from
the same beloved Motherland?Australia?is clasping tenderly and protectmgly within
his arms and hands the happy faces ot little aboriginal spirit children who are
emerging from the sacred rocks of their ancient tribal haunts and looking hopefully
towards a better future for their race. As he has said himself, he is striving in this
piece of work to express the future ideal for these two Australian races as a great
assimilation and a magnificent reciprocation.
It is, too, a self-revelation of how he regards his work?a mission to interpret
the spiritual background the Alchera or "beckoning dream-world" ot the aboriginal
Australians to the white Australians, so that the latter, too. may come to see the
divine shimmering through all the common things of life, and begin to reverence
anew the beauty of trees, the bush creatures and the aboriginals and their ancient
culture, instead ot thoughtlessly destroying them as heretofore.
During the last six or seven years, his life has been unified and made purposeful
by this mission, and by his constant endeavour to more and more completely translate
into his work his intuitive feeling that where words end, religion, music and art are
one in more fully expressing the divine that is In himself as well as in all other men
and all living things.
The next 6 pieces all deal with various creation legends current among various
aboriginal tribes.
No. 2. ?'The Creation of Men." ?This piece is based on a Central Australian
legend which tells how, in the very beginning of things, there were rolling round
Central Australia on the eastern shores of a oreat inland sea strange incomplete
creatures ??inapatua" ?huge, ball-like masses of living matter with here a leg,
here an arm, and here a head protruding from out ot the whirling, chaotic whole.
Suddenly there descended from the western sky two great giants who, with their
great stone knives, hacked complete human beings out of the "Inapatua"?and so
men and women came into the world.
No. 3. ?"Numbakulla." ? Numbakulla was the great original creator spirit who
called into being Inkatas or totem leaders (such as Intwailuka, the great Witchetty
totem leader), men, churinga, all animal life, and spirit children belonging to churinga.
Numbakulla is here calling on the spirit world to take on all the forms of varied
life, as told above in Uniapon?s creation legend.


No. 4.?"lntwailuka." ?At the dawn of creation, this great spirit, Intwailuka,
descended to earth and made great chasms and clay cans in the Macdonnell Ranges.
He was the creator of Heavitree Sap which leads south to Alice Springs, and also
of Emily Sap. According to the semi-humorous legend, he sat down on the mountain-
top, and his great weight crashed through the rocks and formed the great Heavitree
Sap, which is such a remarkable feature of the landscape of Alice Springs. He
Is here shown in the cleft of the Sap, as is symbolised by the two churingas on each
side of him. Intwailuka sent out his leaders and guides?lnkatas?to all the tribes,
and these guides formed the various totem groups, named after themselves, for
each was in the guise of some animal, bird or insect (the "friendly earthly creature
companions of Man" ?as told in Uniapon's Creation legend). Intwailuka was the
great Wrtchetty Inkata himself. (The Witchetty grub Is an edible white tree grub
?a great aboriginal delicacy.) Having taught the tribes all they needed to know,
and their work being finished, the Inkatas sank into the ground, but their spirits
remained behind with the churinga, rocks and trees, and these spots and districts
have been sacred to each tribe ever since. This helps one to understand the acute
spiritual loneliness of the detribalised aboriginal (who has been deprived by the
white man of his sacred hunting grounds) and his consequent spiritual degradation.
No. s.?"The Lizard Inkata" ?shows the guide of the men of the Lizard totem.
No. 6. ?"The Origin of Two Euros."? This is another Central Australian legend
and tells of the creation of the euros, a small species of kangaroo. First, there was
a water hole, and then a boy spirit appeared. When he grew to be a man, he
suddenly became two great v/izards whose beards flowed along the Foster Range,
and as they blew along their beards, out came two lovely euros, leaping into the
glowing sunshine.
?
No. 7. ?"The Kangaroo-men"? shows the men of the kangaroo totem tribe carry-
ing their sacred churinga stone. The churinga stone was the especially sacred property
of a tribe, and was planted in the earth with great and secret ceremony, and was
supposed to send out roots, and so increase the number of edible roots and tubers,
and also the fertility of the particular animal which was the totem of the tribe.
In this particular ceremony shown here, the men of the kangaroo totem no longer
think of themselves as men, but in their imagination, so completely identify themselves
with their animal "guide and companion" of primal days that they adopt his body
with its marvellous powers of swift and beautiful motion.
This piece was kindly lent by Mrs. Ellis.
No. 8. ?"Old Men Discoursing on Churinga."? One can imagine that a similar
group crouched round this sacred churinga stone and told Sir Baldwin Spencer in awed
whispers of all its miraculous powers.
Ricketts has a deep and loving veneration and hero-worship for Sir Baldwin,
for his sympathy and understanding of the Aboriginal mind and life.
No. 9. ?"The Evening Star.' I?The 1 ? The legend of the Evening Star tells of a lovely
maiden who travels across the fields of the sky and each night sinks into a beautiful
white stone on the horizon.
(Kindly lent for this exhibition by the Mac�obertson Girls' School, Melbourne.)
No. 10.?"The Moon Man."? This is a legend of the Flinders Ranges tribes and
tells how the moon got Into the sky and how It got the marks in the middle of its face.
The moon man was a bad-tempered fellow whose two nephews always greatly annoyed
him; determined to get even with him, they persuaded him to climb a high tree, and
then they blew upon it so that it grew until it reached the sky. They then asked him
to show how clever he was by touching the sky. When he did this they pulled down
the tree and left him up in the sky for ever. At another time, one of the nephews


pushed him over a cliff and he fell on his face?hence the permanent scars This
work was inspired by the drawing of an aboriginal artist from the Flinders Ranges.
(This piece has been lent by Mrs. Gladys A. Sanderson.)
No. II and I la.?"Witchetty Spirits."
No. 12.?"The Sandhills Are Good!"? shows the spirit of the aborigine rejoicing
in the 'goodness of the sacred sand-hills?his home country from immemorial times.
No. 13,?"Engwurra" or "Ordeal by Fire."? The young men of a tribe go through
the "Engwurra" or "ordeal by fire," as the last of the initiatory ceremonies before
emerging as perfectly developed members of the tribe. This ceremony imparts courage
and wisdom, and also makes them more kindly-hearted and less apt to quarrel, tor
it teaches them self-restraint and hardihood. It also shows the mature man the
secrets of the tribe, which are concerned with the churinga and the totems with
which they are associated.
|S| O . 14. ? "A Symphony of Legends." ? In this will be recognised many of the
legends already told.
No. |5. ?"Possum Waters." ? A fountain piece with happy 'possum spirits as
its main motif.
No. 16 and No. 16a. ?"Mind Thought, Beauty Wrought" is the name chosen
by the artist for this thought-provoking and beautiful piece.
No. 17. ? "His Dreaming" or "Alchera."
No. 18.?"Assault on Alchera." ?This work is a challenge from the Aboriginal
Heaven calling (or more so, shouting) at the evil spirit in the white man to come
no further.
No. 19.?"The Tree of Tradition."? Just as the tribe itself has sacred places where
they need fear no evil, so. each individual has his own "Nanja" or sacred spot, generally
a tree, where he is safe from the assaults of enemies, human or supernatural, and here,
too, are in safety with him the animals which he loves. It is a flowery isle, as Shelley
says, "in a wide sea of misery." According to the Aboriginal belief, when the human
body dies, the spirit "flies forth as a little bird," back to its sacred Nanja
rock, and there it dwells "happy and free as constant sunshine and pure running
water" ?the two great symbolical elements. The spirit is quite free to travel wherever
it wills, but usually, it stays where its own tribe is dwelling. Specially gifted persons
have the power to see these "Liberated Spirits" everywhere ?peeping out from rocks
and trees and branches. The artist has made much use of this happy legend in many
of his pieces. Always these spirits are ready to re-incarnate themselves, over and over
again, for they never die. They enter the lubra spiritually and so are born again
in the flesh.
The spirits of animals and plants have the same power of re-incarnation among
their own kind ?for all life is one.
Again the mind of the white man must dwell in shame on all the spiritual misery
and consequent degradation he has caused to his black predecessors whom he ruth-
lessly deprived of their ancient tribal haunts, hallowed by centuries of religious rever-
ence. Can we, as a nation, escape a just retribution for these deeds of our race
during the last 150 years?
"The mills of Sod grind slowly,
But they grind exceeding small."
4
It is, however, not too late to cry "Peccavi," and make what recompense we can
through our Governments making sufficient Aboriginal reservations where the remaining
tribes can still live unmolested by the white man's interference and vices.


No. 20.?"The Spirit of a Great Tree. 1 ' ? Comparing this tragic piece with No. 19
is a bitter humiliation for us white Australians, for it pointedly contrasts the poetic
love of the native folk for the great Australian trees with our own criminal carelessness,
and, only too often, wilful destruction of our wonderful heritage?the Australian forest.
So, In No. 20, we find the artist adapting the Aboriginal mythology to this tragic and
woeful modern theme. "The Spirit of a Great Tree" shows a oreat forest giant burnt and
charred by the flames of a great bush fire, and its spirit peers forth with frightful
avenging scowl. It Is as if the spirit of the tree Is threatening the vandal fire fiends,
who thoughtlessly destroy the lovely forests and the birds and beasts therein, by hurling
at them the terrible words in Jeremiah : "I will punish you according to the fruits of
your doings, saith the Lord, and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and It shall
devour all things round about It,"
V
No. 21.?"The White Brute" or "The Destroyer.' I?This 1 ? This last piece among all
these exhibits is meant as a glaring contrast to the ideal expressed in No. I, "My
Country," for here Ricketts, with ail the fervour and fierceness of one of the old
prophets, flails the hideous sins of some of the white Australians, against which all
his work is not only a protest and Indictment, but a vehement tirade.
'r% V, � *
The worst type of the white man is here held up for our contempt ?sleek
plastered hair above a brutish and moronic face, his axe plunged into the heart of a
great forest giant, and dead and dying bush creatures lying on the ground?the
results of an "open season" such as was proclaimed by our government in 1927, when
thousands of koalas and possums perished in the interests of "big business" in the fur
trade. At the door of this same type of bestial selfishness and sheer stupidity may be
laid the continued depletion of our virgin forest lands, the caging of wild birds, as
well as the tragic and progressive extinction of our native folk. It has become
Rickett's mission in life to help to rouse the white Australians, before it is too late,
from their callous complacency about these things vital to our national life.
May one point out in conclusion that this Is not an exhibition with which to fill
in a few Idle moments, for then It will have nothing to yield to the onlooker; but a
quiet and careful study of each piece, the result of years of intensive thought and
craftsmanship wifi so richly repay the seeker that like the disciples of a greater Master,
one will say, "It is good for us to be here," and go away with the feeling expressed
by Elizabeth Barrett Browning :
"Earth's crammed with Heaven,
And every common bush afire with God,
But only he who sees takes off his shoes;
The rest sit round it and pluck blackberries."

An Open Letter by Ricketts
Mountain Gallery
- Mt. Dandenong.
April 20th, 1944.
Dear Readers, ?
You have just seen my work and read in my catalogue, how, by means of
my clay sculptures, I have been trying to show to my fellow Australians some
of the ancient beliefs, traditions, and modes of thought of our Australian aborig-
inal folk.
Since 1933 my mind has dwelt on these things, and on these dispossessed
people who dwelt in Australia for thousands of years before the white man
came to these shores. This has given rise to a powerful love and an over-
whelming desire to make these two races ?-both Australian ?understand each other
more fully, and, above all learn from each other; and, most especially, to help
the white men to learn from the aboriginals whom they generally have contemp-
tuously regarded as uncultured and quite uncivilized. I have tried, as far as
lay in my powers, to show by means of my clay sculptures that they were far
from being uncultured, and that in many ways they could teach the white
Australian much about the higher things of life.
.In some of my pieces, as you have seen, I have shown how sharp the
difference between the spiritual outlook of these two races is, and that only too
often the white man, judged by any higher standards than merely material ones,
comes off a bad second-best in such comparisons.
After ten years of unaided hard work and privations I cannot yet say that
I have made a path, but I have at least made a scratch, and I have found
many who understand and sympathize with my work and aims, and I feel and
know there is a growing fund of goodwill, sympathy and appreciation for me
net only here,-but overseas.
I felt humbly proud and thankful when no less a person than Dr. Chas.
Duguid, of South Australia, that great lover of and sympathizer with the aboriginals,
wrote to me: ?Your work is going to do a tremendous lot to bring the white
overlords to their responsibilities which, so far, they have largely evaded.?
For, in looking back over the last 150 years of our modern Australian history,
I am bound to confront the white man with a black record. How often has he
actefi mercilessly, selfishly and stupidly and ridden roughshod over the rights of
the native folk! He has ruthlessly destroyed the native animals and native
forests?often enough at the instigation of ?Big Business,? that profit-seeking
monster ??95 per cent, lunatic? as Bernard Shaw said years ago, and which he
prophesied ?would lead the world into a ditch.?
I am not the only one who has judged so the misdeeds of the white man
in Australia. Dr. E. Stanley Jones, the famous American missionary speaker
and writer, who visited Australia a few years before the present war, says:?
?I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the aboriginal is not dying
off but he is being killed off. He was 300,000 in numbers, now he is 60,000
and dwindling. A casualty list of 240,000, and yet it is said, no blood has
been shed in the conquest of this land! .Each nation has its blind spot, and
this is Australia?s blind spot. . . . True, you have softened the picture by
maiiy deeds of kindness through missionary and other organizations, but these
have only touched the fringe of the problem. As a nation you have not tackled
it in any great comprehensive and statesmanlike way . It is the saddest story
of the dealings of one people with another that has been written in modern
times. And, the astonishing thing is that it has been written by the most
otherwise kindly and big-hearted people on earth. The basis is ignorance,
prejudice and unwillingness to face facts.
?Most Australians shift the conversation at this point. It is the skeleton
in Australia?s national life.?


Hr Chas Duquid, M.A., said, in a recent A.B.C. broadcast describing the
Ernabeiia^Mission^School in'the Musgrave Ranges, whene native fa.lk are
taught to read and write their own language (due to the skilful Uanslator s voik
of Dr- 1. R. B. Love and their teacher, Mr. R. M. Trudmg). . ,
?For over 150 years more and more of the grass country previously owned
by the aborigines has been taken over by white men to ratten sheep am
bullocks and we have been content to allow the natives to become hangers-on
at the stations when their game has disappeared and their bush-tticker has been
eaten up. The able-bodied natives work on the stations and get a minimum
of food and some cast-off clothing, but nothing else. Some South Australian
stations pay their men, but what I have said applies to nearly the whole o
the interior of Australia where the natives are despised and scorned.
from want and freedom from fear are not yet in their charter. Ernabella hopes
to chance that. We hope to convince the white people that the aborigines are
children of God, and that some good land must be left to those who remain.
Ernabella is training the tribal children in such a way that retain
their natural prowess and powers, and at the same time grow up ah.e to manage
and work the country they wander over under the direction of understanding
white people. To deprive them of more good land is to condemn them o
death. It means nothing less. If Ernabella supported by the people of
Australia, it will succeed in saving our native race in the heart of the co, .orient. _
The Rev. Theodore Webb, lifteen years missionary to the aborigines of <
North Australia, in ?Spears to Spades,? says : . . .
?Our task is to learn so to understand tnese people (the aborigines) as
to be in a position to determine what is desirable for them; then sympathetically
to help them to understand what is necessarand finally to teach ana encourage
them to do these things for themselves. , ,
?In whatever form education and- training may be imparted, it will be
clearly recognized that there is much of our complex civilization waich is
undesirable and there are many of our conventions that are of no real value.
Our aim is to make these people better aboriginals rather than
Rev. J. R. B. Love, who has translated the Gospel into the Pitjantjatjara
language says that: , . 4 .
?A Christian mission to aborigines should be a place where the native
people can live out their own lives, speaking their own language, ana keeping
the best of their own tribal laws and social organization, such laws purified.
and uplifted by the leaven of the Gospel of Christ which recognizes the good
in all and is uncompromisingly opposed to the evil.
In all these four extracts the italics arc mine for it is on these selected
opinions of men who have known and loved and worked among our native, folk
that I want to build in the future and replace a century and a half of destruction
by a new 1 age of preservation and construction.
And now I wish to lay a plan before you?a plan that I realize myseh
cannot at once be fully fulfilled, but which I desire to begin as soon as possible,
for I desire it as a sower desires to plant a seed.
I think you will agree that this plan is akin in spirit to those or the lovers
of the native folk, whom I have quoted above; and plan will, I hope, in tne
distant future continue to grow and flourish far beyond my present dreams and
imaginings. r
Briefly put, my plan is that with the help of otners ?both white and native
folk?l may, before it is forever too late, found a great cultural centre for our
native folk. It is a plan that is national in its scope, for its ultimate aim is a
fuhief understanding between ourselves and the native folk, and also when it is a
working reality, it will be there for all the world to see that, at long last, we
white Australians have recognized the dignity and worth of the aboriginal
people, and honour the beauty of their ancient folk lore and their folk arts.
We who have robbed them of so much will now try to make them a little
late restitution.


f
It will, naturally, be necessary to set aside (either by Government grant
or by the gift of some understanding person) a tract of land as a great sanctuary
somewhere in the south-east of Australia where in later times, when fully
developed, it will not be entirely inaccessible from our great centres of population,
where future generations will also need to learn to honour our native folk.
I would desire mountain, plain, and river country, partly set (if still possible)
amid virgin forest ?a piece of the ?real Australia ' as our native folk knew
it before the white man came. This great reserve must be kept inviolate through
ail future generations ?its trees, its native flora and fauna are not to be despoiled
by any man.
I desire a free hand to go into that sanctuary with what talent and money
I have made by the sale of my works and my property at Mount Dandenong,
and also supported in spirit by a great fund of public good will. Thus, as one
white man (and later there may be others) taking hold of the culture of the
aboriginal race, I will, through the medium of life-size sculptures based
on the folk-lore give out that beautiful and true expression of life between the
two peoples now living alongside each other in this country. Many of these
large works of art which I hope to create will be merged into the natural rock
features of the reserve. I hope, as hitherto, to draw largely on Professor Sir
Baldwin Spencer?s books. One of these works of mine will certainly be a
tribute to that great man and lover of our native folk.
Thus, by these my works in that sanctuary, I want to show not only to all
the world, but most especially to our native folk how much I honour them, and
pay a tribute to the beauty of their folk-lore. I want them to feel that when
they come there, here is one who has prepared a welcome for them in a great
art spectacle of their own people?s ancient beliefs and customs.
It seems to me now that I would need at least five years to prepare in
that way for these native people for whom this sanctuary will, in the first place
be created.
I know that nowadays there are only 700 full-blood native folk in New
South Wales, and about 70 in Victoria, and I know, too, that these have al 1
been detribaiized for the last two or three generations, and therefore have in
most cases only a distant cultural link with their ancient folk lore and tribal
customs; but, it is these very people that I want gradually to draw into my
plan, for, as things are now, they are not becoming ?better aboriginals? but are
simply ?imitation Europeans.?
Though they are scattered in various communities in both Victoria and
New South Wales there must be many among them born with their hereditary
skills for the old arts and crafts of their even if they lack the actual
knowledge of the old tribal lore and customs. As has been pointed out by
Dr. Duguid and scores of other observers and teachers of our native folk, they
excel in drawing, music and expressive dancing, while in other subjects (given
the teaching and opportunity) their intelligence is equal to that of the white man.
So, gradually, during these five years of my preparation for them, the
full-blood native people anywhere in Australia, but especially those in New
South Wales and Victoria, could be told of this great reserve set aside for their
honour and encouraged to come in with their families and take part in creating
this cultural centre for themselves.
They will have in most cases to be taught again the old legends of their
people by some of those who still know them. Artists among them will, I hope,
want to come in from anywhere in Australia and teach those amongst them
wishing to develop their ancient skills in aboriginal designs in drawing, woodwork
and carving and stone work, and, above all, in expressing themselves in music
and dancing ?a new form of ballet. I myself could teach the younger children
and older folk how to express themselves in clay. All these arts and crafts
would be developed along true aboriginal lines, and one can envisage in the
distant future our native folk giving to the world their own special contribution
of beauty in music, art, ballet and also in literature.
Works of art by these native craftsmen could be sold and so help to support
them, and I myself would help with this by the sale of my own works.


Possibly all of the native people from south-east Australia would know how'
to read and" speak English and therefore there would be needed a line library of
collections of legends'and folk lore from all over Australia as well as other
matters pertaining to Australia. Doubtless too the wonderful pioneer work of
the Rev/ J. R. B. Love in rendering one of our native languages into a script
that can be read and written by themselves, will be further developed by other
white translations, and this new learning would aiso naturally lino a place in this
native sanctuary and may eventually give rise to an aboriginal literature.
As is easily realized there would be no chance or any of these oetnbalized
native folk of south-east Australia, several generations ago removed from their
old tribal lands, ever taking up again the nomadic life of primitive hunters such
as their ancestors were, and as the people or Ernaoeila and che great C_.eptial
Australian Reserve still do and are rightly encouraged to continue, so that they
?may retain their natural prowess and powers.? Ernabeila and similar mission
stations, if supported, will preserve the aboriginals more in their original hunting
stage of life.
But, most of these native people of the south-east (or tneir immediate
ancestors) were hustled by the white man from a primitive hunter?s life to that or
an advanced European one ?often a city life. Hence they skipped the natural
next stage of human development ?that of the tiller of the soil, the riverside
farmer. It must always be borne in mind (as Rev. Eric Owen has pointed out)
that ft was ?not because of an inherent mental deficiency, but because of the
absence of a seed worth cultivating? that the Australian aboriginal remained a
primitive hunter without any architecture, water conservation, or village or town
life or any permanent possessions except his weapons.
Therefore in this great cultural centre they may now advance at their own?
leisure and possibly under the tuition of understanding white men to this agrarian
stage of civilization, for the white man has brought with him many different
types of seeds worth cultivating; and so along the river land of that reserve
we may yet see the homes of native farmers who are also native craftsmen and
artists in drawing and painting, or music, or dance.
Ail buildings on the reserve* would eventually be built by the native folk and
would naturally be more comfortable than the primitive hunter?s transient home,
the mia-mia, built for a night or even for a few days. In time they would
possibly develop some architectural style of their own and suited to their needs.
A school, a place of Christian worship, a meeting hall, the library and a hospital
would all naturally follow as the settlement of native folk grew in numbers, for
native folk will be coming and going I hope from ail parts of Australia, and
others living there permanently. All native children living or born in south-eastern
Australia and elsewhere can come in at their wish to breathe in the language of
the art and music of their native race.
'Thus the native children of the eastern part of Australia will learn to know
their brothers and sisters of the Musgrave Ranges and elsewhere, and a new
feeling of national unity will begin' to make itself felt among them, as well as a
new bond of brotherly love for the helping white folk of their common motherland
?-Australia.
it must of course be clearly understood that no white men can come into
this reserve without proper procedure, or even be allowed to live there unless
they are acting temporarily as teachers, anthropologists, or advisers to the native
people.
White people and, above all, white children may visit under the conduct of
native guides, so that they may learn and understand at first hand about the
folk lore of the Australian native race.
This then is my plan in outline and I commend it to you for your considera-
tion. For myself I feel as Blake did about England :
?I shall not rest from mental fight,
Nor shall the sword sleep in my hand
Till I have built Jerusalem .
, in Austral s green and pleasant land.?
I am, yours truly,
WM. RICKETTS.
