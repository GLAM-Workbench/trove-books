BROWNE of BALLINVOHER,
CASTLETOWN ROCHE, CORK,
In the Barony of Fermoy, Cork, Ireland.
The date of settlement in Ireland, and the original domicile in
England, are unknown. It may be assumed that the first Irish
settler was one of the English gentlemen planted by the great
Earl of Cork in the Valley of the Blackwater, and reference to his
Diary at Lismore Castle may throw some light upon the subject.
Documents on record in the Court of Chancery, Dublin, furnish the
earliest known particulars, from which it is found that
EDWARD BROWNE married 23 March, 1647, Jane Tynte, who
appears to have been fourth daughter of Robert Tynte of
Ballycrenano, eldest son of Sir Robert Tynte, who came to
Ireland in 1599, and was eventually buried at Kilcredan, Cork.
In consideration of £4OO marriage portion, an entail was created.
The only issue now known is the Heir,
HENRY BROWNE, of whom Archbishop AVilliam King wrote in
the year 1691, page 168, one Mr. Browne appeared in a company
of men who endeavoured to make their escape from those that
came to plunder them of their arms and horses. But mistaking
the design, went home to his own house. He was brought before
Judge Dally for this at Limerick, who upon examination of the
matter dismissed him, judging him innocent of any crime that
would bear an indictment; but he was taken up again for the
same fact at Cork, and brought before Judge Nugent at the time
when King James came first thither. Judge Nugent seemed at
first to be of the same opinion with Judge Dally, but after he
had discoursed His Majesty he vigorously proceeded against the
gentleman, and procured him to be found guilty by a partial
jury. Every body looked on this only as an occasion sought for
the King to show his clemency. Mrs. Browne, the convicted
gentlemen’s wife, with five or six children, presented him a petition
begging her husband’s life at his feet, as the first act of grace on
his coming into the kingdom ; but he rejected her petition, and
notwithstanding she reinforced it with all the friends and interest
she could make, the gentleman was hanged, drawn, and
quartered. This awakened all the Protestants in Ireland. See
also Dr. Chas. Smith’s History of Cork, 1774, vol 1, page 339,


who further refers to Lord Kingston’s Galway prisoners.
Dr. Charles Leslie, in his reply to the state of the Protestants in
Ireland, questions the justness of Archbishop King’s statement,
and says: “But the story is thus, as the Irish Protestants do
tell it—the Earl of Inchiquin and Captain Henry Boyle, with the
generality of the Protestant gentlemen in the province of
Munster, having entered into an association in December, 1688,
resolved to seize Cork and Bandon as the places of greatest
strength and consequence in the province etc. etc. In their
march Sir Thomas Southwell and others seized on all the Papists’
horses; and this Mr. Browne, who was one of them, took the
horses of Neagle of Moyallow, then High Sheriff of County of
Cork, and a man was killed in the fray, etc.” What this author
means by overt acts, or what by treason, he will tell us or give
us some probable reason why King James should reprieve and
afterwards pardon Sir Thomas and all the rest engaged in that
business, and have such a particular malice only at Browne,
whom he knew as little as any of the rest, that he should bo
inexorable in Mr. Browne’s case alone, and yet so very merciful
to all the rest, is a contradiction to believe, if his case or
circumstances did in no way differ from theirs.
The wife referred to was Eleanor, supposed sister of Thomas Lane
of Ballynseunator, (see King, p. 250), who was attainted in 1689.
She was married on 8 April, 1673, and had a marriage portion
of £2OO, her husband dying in March, 1688-9, or thereabout. He
had previously, on 24 November, 1684, arranged with his
connection, Sir Pichard Hull, Judge in Common Pleas, to pass a
patent for his lands; the Judge’s son, William Hull, of Leamcon,
completed this 28 March, 1717. The children of Eleanor may
now bo represented by the
Brownes of Wicklow, Passage, or Bronwlfa, and Waterford;
but the only one known by name is the heir,
POBEPT BPOWNE, who on 23 October, 1701, married
Elizabeth, supposed sister of Erancis Burgess of Ballyscurloek.
They had — Henry, John of Cappoquin, Tynte, who married
Ann, died 1760, daughter of John Wigmore, of Lismore
■Waterford, by his wife Ann Giles.
Robert had various family dealings with his estate. His wife’s
marriage portion was £450; his will is dated 11 Juno, 1731.
HENPY BPOWNE broke the entail in 1732, and on 6 November,
1747, granted a fee-farm grant of £lOO a year, with which the
lands are still encumbered.
He married twice—first, on or about July, 1732, Tryphona,
second daughter of the Pev. Pichard Yerling, Pector of


Castletown-Roche, who died without issue, and second, about
1747, Bridget, sister of Francis Archer of Cork, who was related
to Bishop Gough of Limerick. There was but one son and heir,
ROBERT BROWNE, who died at Castletown-Roche 2 July 1815,
having married 12 May, 1769, at St. Nicholas Church, Cork,
Elizabeth, who died aged 82 years in 1830, and was buried at
Ballintemple, daughter of Thomas, second son of Thomas Warner
bom 1697. Their issue were—
1. Henry. 2. Bridget. 3. Eliza.
The eldest daughter Bridget married Gustavus Meredith Warner,
born 1797, third son of Gustavus third son of Rev. Simon Warner.
They had seven sons and* two daughters, of whom two only
survived, viz.—
Gustavus, bom 25 August, 1805, died November, 1870, married
Alicia, daughter of Kommis, who died 4 February, 1881,
and was buried at Finglas, near Dublin. They survived all
their children. He was Rector of Castle Lost, Rochfort Bridge,
in the gift of Lord Kilmaine, of Westmeath.
The youngest and last surviving son was —
Gustavus Adolphus George Thomas Warner,
married Sarah, daughter of Major Long of Limerick, who
predeceased him. He was bom 13 January, 1809, and in 1855
was Chaplain to the British forces at Corfu. He was a
contemporary of Gladstone, and in 1874 wrote some letters on
the demolition of the Irish Church.
Eliza, the second daughter, married Charles Edward Blake,
Lieutenant-Colonel 63rd regiment, probably of Galway. She
died at Hillsea Barracks in 1812, without children, and leaving
an informal will, involved her brother in an unsuccessful law
suit.
HENRY BROWNE married twice, and died in Dublin 20 August,
1849, aged 74. He was buried at Stillorgan. He resided in
early life at Mallow, and latterly in Dublin with his daughter.
During the French wars he served with his Militia regiment,
and once saved Athlone Castle from destruction by fire. He was
captain in Royal Limerick Militia, Deputy-Governor of Limerick,
and a barrister-at-law, but never practised. He married, first,
at Rahan Church, 8 October, 1796, Isabella, eldest daughter of
William Galwey, banker in Mallow, who died 18 October, 1817;
secondly, 20 July, 1820, his cousin Mary bom 1792 died
1 March, 1865, third daughter of Gustavus, third son of
Rev. Simon Warner. She had previously married William Yicars
of Granstown Castle, Westmeath, who had a son William, who


died about 12 years old ; and another, Robert, who married his
cousin in Brussels, and left an only son, who died at Windsor,
3 years of age, from a painful accident. By his first marriage
Henry had—
1. Elizabeth Isabella, born 2 March, 1798,

She was a pet in the family.
WILLIAM HENRY, second but eldest surviving son, was born
in Mallow 20 August, 1800, and died at Bifrons, Launceston,
18 Juno, 1877. Ho was educated at Charleville, and entered at
Trinity College, Dublin, 6 October, 1817, where ho purposed
studying medicine; but he prepared for Holy Orders, graduated
A.B, 19 July, 1824, and became LLD. 9 March, 1829. He was
ordained in the Cathedral Church of St. Coleman, Cloyno, as
Deacon 17 October, 1824, and as Priest on 10 April, 1825,
serving as Curate of Whitechurch for three years. He considered
that he was illiberally treated hero by his Rector,
Rev. Dr. Hingston, and sought, through the interest of
Lord Shannon and others, a Colonial Chaplaincy, which he
secured in Yan Diemen’s Land, under letters patent issued by
Mr. Husldsson, and signed by George the 4th, dated London
7 February, 1828, then taking passage in the “ Coronet,” he left
the Cove of Cork on 1 May, 1828, and arrived at Hobart Town
on 6 October, 1828, when he was soon appointed to Launceston,
under a Gazette notice of 1 November, 1828. Here, as the
number of the clergy in the North of Tasmania increased, he was
regarded as their head. A strong will and a hospitable board
contributing to his supremacy; he was most noted for the
prominent part he took in the Anti-Transportation League
movement 1847 to 1852, in the “solemn declaration” of the


Clergy, July, 1851, in building schools, in promoting
savings’ banks, and temperance, in the enlargement of
St. John’s Church, in funeral reform, and in shortening the
Church services. He retired upon a pension in May, 1868, but
was appointed Archdeacon of Launceston in July, 1870. The
Church Neivs records : “ The appointment of the new Archdeacon
has been well received. A debt was due to one who for more than
40 years presided over St. John’s Parish, that parish once equal
in extent to a diocese, has by the gradual creation of new
parishes been reduced to the more central portion of the town.
Archdeacon Browne took charge at a time when most of us were
either unborn, or were very young at school. During all those
long years the breath of slander never dimmed the lustre of his
character, and no churchman need hang down his head for shame
on account of the aged and courteous gentleman who now
presides over the clergy of the North.” This was not an office of
emolument, his private means being trenched upon, but he filled
the post till his death. Almost the only breaks in his clerical
life were a few months in 1838-39, after injury from a fall from
his horse, and a visit to Europe in 1853-56. Being a thrifty,
prudent man, he amassed ample means. The Archdeacon
married twice—first, on 3 Sepetmber, 1829, Caroline Johnson,
second daughter of Bichard Willis, J.P., M.L.0., of Wanstead,
Campbell Town, formerly of London. She died at Sans Souci,

Ordnance Survey. It is situate on the left, or north, bant of the
Awbeg, a good trout stream, and a tributary of the Blackwater
River. On the opposite side of the Awbeg are Mr. Grove,
Annesley of Annesgrove, and ilr. Richard "Welsted of Ballywater.
Of the Awbeg, Spenser the poet wrote under the name “ Mulla,”
as follows: —
Old father Mole (Mole bight), that mountain gray,
That noils the north side of Ar Mulla dale,
He had a daughter fresh as flowers of May,
Which gave that name unto that pleasant vale,
Mulla, the dam of old Mole, so hight.
******
Full fair she lov’d and was belov’d full fair,
Of her own brother river, Bregog hight,
So hight because of this deceitful train
Which he with Mulla wrought to win delight;
But her old father, more careful of her good,
And meaning her much better to prefer,
Did think to match her with the neighbour flood
Which Allo hight Broadwater called far,
And wrought so well with his continual pain,
That he that river for his daughter won.
******
First into many parts his stream he shar’d,
And then, besides, those little streams so broken,
He under ground so closely did convey.
That of their passage doth appear no token
Till they into the Mulla’s water slide.

though, young, behaved with undaunted courage- She was
Catherine Townshend of Castle Town, Cork.

These particulars are partly from the evidence, 1732, of
Rev. Thomas Widenham in the cause of Browne and Browne.
Partly from information supplied by Thomas Wigmore of
Ballyvodock, near Middleton, a careful Genealogist,
Henry Browne’s will, dated 5 October, 1839, refers to a settlement
of 4 October, 1796, bequeaths Ballinvoher to his eldest son, subject
to three charges of £1250 Irish, each, to his younger surviving
children.

Mr. Wigmoro wrote on 19 February, 1867, from Queenstown: —
“I once had the marriage settlement of Harry Browne and
Tryphena Yerling, his first wife, that I gave to Mr. Henry Maunsell
of Limerick. This Henry married, second, as you say,
[Bridget] Eliza, sister to Dick Archer of Cork, Merchant, who
used to manage his brother’s money matters. Those Archers
sprung from an old and honorable family, of the same name, in
Leinster. The last I saw of them was the Rev. Foster Archer of
Dublin, Inspector-General of Prisons.
; ‘ The Burgess family lived at Ballyscurlock, near Tallow. I
think Mr. Francis Burgess of that place was Executor to
Harry Browne’s will. They perhaps came originally from Limerick,
and are extinct. His daughter, Betty Burgess, was godmother to
my father. I had letters signed with Harry Browne’s arms —an
eagle displayed.
“ Warner —this was, after Tynte, the highest marriage in the
family. They had a fine estate at Ballynakilty, near Charlevillo,
which Captain Simon Warner sold to Mr. Courtney.


“ Curiously enough, I had from Norfolk last week a shield-of-arms
of Lane of that shire, I believe them to bo the right ones, not
those of Bentley, which they, of Cork, erroneously affect.
“ Thomas Wigmore of Lapps Island, and of Bothwell, Y.D. Land,
was a school-fellow and related to me.
“ After I shall return to Ballyvodock I will send you more if
health permits.”
Mr. Richard Caulfield, LL.D., writes —
“ I got the following from Mr. Wigmore : —Edward Browne got
a small property in Co. Wicklow, which came to his descendant
Tynte Browne. Wigmore was a great loss. He was the most
enthusiastic genealogist I ever met, a most accurate man. He left
a great mass of papers. I believe Mr. Garde has a great quantity
of them.
“In Playfair’s British Family Antiquity, Ireland, vol. 9, there
is a long account of the Tyntes.
“ Heard somebody say that the Brownes of Passage, Co. Cork,
the shipbuilder’s firm, claim relationship with the Kinsale Brownes,
but this I think, as usual, only traditional.”
Under the 19 Yic. 17., 22 December, 1855, from 1 January, 1856,

Under the 44 Yic. No. 9, 20 Oct., 1880, from 1 January, 1881,

NOTES.
Robert Trollop, whose Mausoleum, is the most striking object in
the Cemetery of old St. Mary’s, in the borough of Gateshead, was
an Architect of considerable eminence in the North of England,
and built Capheaton Hall, the seat of the Swinburnes, the contract
for which is dated 9 December, 1667. This, with the receipts of
his son Henry and self for the several payments as they became
due, and also the original brass rule inscribed “ 1655,
Robert Trollop of Yorke Ereemason,” which was used in that
work, as well as in the building of the old Town Hall of Newcastle,
are still preserved at Capheaton. In front of the Hall is
to be seen a dial, “The Capheaton Sun Clock,” surmounted with
the word “Wee,” one of Trollop’s quaint devices. It was a
Memento Mori of the Architect—a sermon in stone —a hint to the
lookers-on to remember that “We die all.”
Trollop’s monument is described in the “Beauties of England,”
1803, Durham, vol. 5, p. 197. Also in “ Notes and Queries,” series
3, vol. 4, pages 354 and 437. In the Gateshead Observer ,
16 November, 1861.
There is reason to believe that the names John and Michael
ascended in the Dobson family, and that search in the right
quarter would carry the present account back into the pedigree
recorded in 1666 at the Herald’s College. Traditionally the
father of the first known Michael Dobson was a Physician or
Surgeon.
The Lambert family includes in the same generation, Anthony, a
Judge at Calcutta; George of Osborne, Isle of Wight, in 1831.
The mother of Captain Charles Swanston of Hobart, and Elizabeth,
daughter of William Lambert of Tweedmouth, whose son was
George Anthony Lambert, also Mrs. Wallace, and the wife of
Colonel Ovans.
Eor the purpose of carrying out the pastoral settlement of
Port Phillip, now Victoria, organised by Mr. John Batman in
May, 1835, Messrs. Charles Swanston, J. T. Gellibrand, and
James Simpson, representing seventeen (17) gentlemen, went to
and were in Sydney on 14 October, 1836, accompanied by


Mr. John Dobson, and so far succeeded in gaining' concessions from
the Government of New South Wales in commutation of tho
“native,” or “Batman grant,” that the settlement of the new
colony was proceeded with, and shipments of sheep were forthwith
commenced from Yan Diemen’s Land to Victoria, and were
* *
continued till about April, 1841, deliverable at Geelong for the
Weribee and other parts of Port Phillip.
The foundation of tho important colony of Victoria may thus be
traced to Mr. John Dobson and to the other seventeen gentlemen
with whom he co-operated.
The following were early arrivals in Van Diemen’s Land ;
Dobson and others arrived at Hobart 26 August, 1820,
per “Surrey.”
G. Dobson and family arrived 24 December, 1822, per “ Skelton.”

TYNTE of SOMERSET, KENT, and SURREY.
Tradition points to a young Knight of the Family of Arundel
'who at the battle of Ascalon, 1192, attracted the attention of
King Eichard the First, and received a grant-of-arms and a motto,
in which the word “Tynctus” occurred; this corrupted became
“Tynte.” It is also possible that Etienne, or Stephen, may have
fallen into “Tynte.” The Tinctures of the Arms now used are
the reverse of those said to have been given at Ascalon, the Herald
records “The proofe for this coate is an owld glase wyndow wth
“ the name of Tynte written vnder it, wch glase I tooko to be
“ moore the an hundreth yeare old. — Y York Herald .”
The Visitations of Somersetshire for 1559, 1573, 1591, and 1623,
show Tynte in Wraxall, Middleton in Kent, and in Ireland. There
was also a Tynte at Pepper Harrow, Surrey, 1643-49, and Colonel
Edward Tynte, Governor of North and South Carolina, about the
same time. A Baronetcy was created 7 June, 1674, which became
extinct 25 August, 1785. The last Baronet, Sir Charles Kemeys
Tynte, left the following provisions in his Will dated 26 August,
1776 : —“To my niece Jane Johnson and her heirs, failing heirs to
“ the use of my godson, the Hon. Yero Poulett, the second son of
“ the Earl Ponlett, for the term of his natural life, in case and as
“ soon as Yere Poulett, bom May, 1761, or either of his sons, shall
“ enjoy the title and estates of his father, the devise shall cease,
“ etc. etc., but not in case of intermarriage with my goddaughter
“ Jane Johnson. Eemainder to my godson Edward Cotton, the
“ fifth son of Sir John Hynde Cotton, Baronet, of Maddingley,
tl etc. etc. Eemainder to the use of John Acland of Fairfield,

« *
1. John, died without issue. 2. William, died without issue.

Extract from Will.


Dr. Caulfield writes [24 February, 1880] —On reference to my
Index of Wills proved in Cork from 1600 to 1800, I only see two
Tynt wills proved, viz., Robert Tynt of Ballycrenane, 1646, and
John Tynt of Cork, 1663.
About tbis time tbe Irish male lino appears to have died out,
James Worth becoming the representative in right of his mother,
but how the lands settled upon his English relatives came to him
does not appear. He used the Tynte and Worth Arms quarterly.
It is however certain that ho was much esteemed by the people
of Youghall, which Borough he represented in the Irish Parlia-
ment at Dublin. The Youghall Council Book records on the
10 September, 1744, arrangements for an address and a dinner, and
on the 13 September his reply, after presentation, is given. He
was a member of the Dublin Privy Council in 1774.
A son of James, Robert Tynte of Dunlavin, County Wicklow,
married Elizabeth, daughter of John Stratford, first Earl of
Aldborough, and left James Stratford Tynte, who was created
a Baronet in 1778, and died without any male heir. He married
his cousin Hannah, daughter of Morley Pendred Saunders
of Saunders-Grove, County Wicklow, and left two daughters.
One, Jemima Roberta, married Joseph Pratt of Cabra Castle,
County Cavan, whose second son became Joseph Pratt Tynte of
Tynte Park, Dunlavin, County Wicklow, and whose family bear
the name Tynte in Ireland.

AD AMICUiM.
Tynte was the man who first from British shore
Palladian arts to Carolina bore.
His tuneful harp attending Muses strung,
And Phoebus’ skill inspired the lays he sung.
Strong Towers and Palaces their rise began,
And listening stones to sacred Fabrics ran ;
Just laws were taught, and curious arts of peace,
And Trade’s brisk current flow’d with wealth’s increase.
On such foundations learn’d Athens rose,
So Dido’s thong did Carthage first enclose,
So Rome was taught old Empires to subdue,
As Tynte creates and governs now the New.
