Supposed Ancient Wreck on S.W. coast of Victoria.

300. Chap, xxxiv., ? How they all went hunting for sea anemones
at Cape Chatham,? &c.
? I imagined,? said Sara, ? that the sea would be much rougher than this. In spite of
the ceaseless thunder below there, it is very calm.?
? Calm,'eh ?? said the Doctor?s voice behind them. ? God help the ship that should
touch that reef this day, though a nautilus. might float in safety.?
Jim came panting up. ?So this is the great Southern Ocean, eh !?
? Fancy,? said Halbert, ? one of those old Dutch voyagers driving on this unknown
coast on a dark night. What a sudden end to their voyage ! Yet that must havenap-
pened to many ships which have never come home. Perhaps when they come to explore
this coast a little more they may find some old ship?s ribs jammed on a reef ; the ribs of
some ship whose name and memory have perished.?
? The very thing you mention is the case,?, said the Doctor. ? Down the coast here,
under a hopeless black basaltic cliff, is to be seen tiie wreck of a very, very old ship, now
covered with coral and sea-weed. I waited down there for a spring tide, to examine her,
but could determine nothing, save that she was very old ; whether Dutch or Spanish,
I know not.? [Author?s note.] ? Such a ship may be seen in Hie eastern end of Portland
Bay, near the modern town of Port Fairy.?

1770. April 20th. ?Discovery of Point Hicks, Earn Head, V
Gabo Island, and Cape First Voyage of Captain t r. /
Cook. J /
April 19,1770. With the first daylight this morning the land was seen ; it made in
sloping hills covered in part with trees or bushes, but interspersed with large tracts of
sand. At noon we were sailing along shore, five or six leagues from it, with a brisk breeze
of wind, and cloudy, unsettled weather, when we were called upon deck to see three water
spouts
? ? Banks? Journal, edited by Sir J. D. Hooker, 1896, p. 261.
Thursday, 19th April, 1770. We continued standing westward, with the wind at S.S.W.
till eight, when we made all sail we could, and bore away alone, the shore N.B. for the
easternmost land in sight, being at this time in latitude 37� 68' 8., and longitude 210� 39'
W. The southernmost point of land in sight. ... I judged to lie in latitude 38�,
longitude 211� 7', and gave it the name of Point Hicks, because Mr. Hicks, the First
Lieutenant, was the first who discovered it
At noon, we were in latitude 37� 50', longitude 210� 29� W and a remark-
able point bore N. 20 E. . . . a round hillock, very much resembling the Ram Head,
at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, and therefore I called it by the same name. . . .
At six in the evening, we shortened sail, and brought to for the night. . . . The north-
ernmost land in sight then bore N. by E. J E., and a small island lying close to a point
on the main bore W., distant two leagues. This point which I named Cape Howe, may
be known by the trending of the coast .... may also be known by some round
hills just within it.

Thursday, 19th April, 1770. At 6 a.m. [2oth] saw land. We continued standing to
the westward with the wind at S.S.W. until 8 . . . . and bore away along shore
N.E. for the easternmost land we had in sight. . . . The southernmost point of
land we had in sight, which bore from us W. J 8., I judged to lay in the latitude of
38� 0' S., and in the longitude of 211� 7' W. from the Meridian of Greenwich. I have
named it Point Hicks*, because Lieutenant Hicks was the first who discovered this
land. To the southward of this point, we eould see no land (p. 237).
Friday, 20th p.m. At 6, shortened sail, and brought to for the night .... the
northernmost land in sight bore N. by E. 4 E., and a small islandf lying close to a point
on the main bore W., distant 2 leagues. This point I have named Cape Howe (p. 238).

Captain Cooks Australian Landfall. By Thomas Walker Fowler,
M. Inst., C.E. Read 19th April, 190 Geog. Journal, 1907,
vol. xxv., pp. 8-12 and diagram.
A discussion of the questions;?
Did or did not, Cook anticipate the existence of the Strait subsequently discovered
by Bass ? What particular portion of our State was first sighted ? What are the points
that were named by Cook ?? Point Hicks ? and Bam Head ?" and \\ hat was the exact
date of the landfall ?
� By the civil reckoning now used in Australia, Cook sighted our eastern shores on the
20th April, 1770, and not on the 19th If, however, in such cases calendar
corrections are to be made, where are we to stop ?? especially in dates of discoveries
antecedent to the new style.

Two papers on the lapse from recent maps of the name ? Point Hicks,? and its supposed
replacement by ? Cape Everard,? proving the existence of both landmarks.
The name ? Everard ? commemorates Capt. Sir J. Everard Home, Bart., of H.M.S.

North side Mr. Rushworth found the wreck of a boat, together with some stove casks,
with the name ? Porpoise ? marked upon them; for which we can in no other way
account than to suppose this to be the boat in which Druce and the unhappy companions
.of his rash enterprise attempted an escape from the settlement on the Derwent.

This is the letter referred to Mrs. Hartley (quaere Hopley ?) West (Hist, of Tasmania ,
1852,1., p. 30) and by Bonwick to Mrs. Hopley (a mistake) (Port Phillip Settlement, 1883,
p. 79). Much to Mrs. Hartley?s regret, Lieut.-Gov. Collins settled his Colony at the
River Derwent, in V.D. Land, in preference to Port Phillip. ' ? My pen,? she writes,.
?is not able to describe half the beauties of that delightful spot.? . . . ? Port Phillip
is my favourite, and has my warmest wishes. During the time we were there [three
months] I never felt one ache or pain, and I parted from it with more regret than I did
from my native land.?

[The preceding pages are published in tentative form for the
use of members of the Historical Society of Victoria. The
section, in this form, will make not less than 100 pages. It
is a specimen of a Bibliography of Australasia and Poly-
nesia, which would occupy 2,000 octavo pages like the present,
or 1,000 folio pages (double columns) the size of a Parliamentary
Paper. /
The general arrangement of the whole work is in Eight Divisions,
comprising numerous tentative sections and sub-sections as
follows :
I. Discovery.? lntroductory Matter. Voyages 16th, 17th, 18th
and 19th Centuries.
11. Physics and Biology.? Astronomy, Geology, Physical Geo-
graphy, Meteorology and Climate, Medical Sciences, Botany,
Algae, Zoology, and Marine Life.
111. Ethnology.? Aborigines of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand,
and other Island Groups of the Pacific, New Guinea, &c-
Philology.


IV. Colonies. ?Geography, Topography, History, and Statistics of
the States of the Commonwealth?New South Wales,
Queensland, Riverina, Victoria [the present section]. South
Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory, Bass
Strait Islands, Tasmania, Norfolk Island, New Zealand,
Fiji.
V. Industries. ?Agriculture and Industrial Resources?Farming,
Gardening, Domestic Occupations, Fisheries, Mining, Manu-
factures and Useful Arts, Sports, Yachting, &c.
VI. Economics. ?Trade and Commerce, Free Trade and Protection,
Finance, Currency, Banking, Shipping, &c.
VII. Politics. ?Colonization, Emigration and Immigration, Govern-
ment?State, Federal, Municipal; Law and Justice, Edu-
cation, Crime and Transportation, Land, Labour, Public
Works, Engineering, Railways, Roads, Posts and Telegraphs.
VIII. Literature. ?Newspapers, other Periodicals and Miscellanies,
Poetry, Prose Fiction, Religious and Scholastic Publica-
tions ; Fine Arts, Music, Theatres, Libraries and Museums.
This is a natural and systematic order of things?from their
discovery, or their beginnings to the crown and glory of all
civilization, i.e., Literature and the Fine Arts.
The titles and references are in chronological order, so that
students may see at a glance the earliest and latest publications,
or those for any intermediate period?the growth of our know-
ledge, or progress of events in any section.
The compilation, begun on this plan as long ago as 1865, now
comprehends tens of thousands of titles and includes all known
publications issued in or relating to this part of the world in
any language. The Catalogue proper will be accompanied by
an Alphabetical Index of Subjects, and another of Authors,
in which the writings of every known author, whether separate
publications, or articles in Collections an<f Periodicals, will be
brought together, in the order of their publication.
It may be added that the work is founded upon the Compiler?s
own researches in the British Museum, and other European and
Colonial Libraries, but chiefly upon an extensive Collection of
books, maps, &c., collected by the Compiler for the purpose of
this work. The Collection, presented to the Commonwealth, now
forms the nucleus of an Australasian Historic a I Museum ,
a foundation of the Archives of Australasia and Polynesia, to
which the ? Bibliography ? is a key illustrating every phase of
Australasian History ?geographical, scientific, political, social,
industrial, judicial, commercial, literary and religious. The
Collection, numbering nearly 15,000 items (to be added to and
continued), is now lodged in the Federal Parliament House,
Spring-street, Melbourne.
The Compiler strictly reserves all rights of reproduction, more
especially as the work is incomplete and in tentative form.]

JOURNEY to WESTERN PORT.
Messrs. Hovell and Hume, during this Interesting journey, kept separate
and Independent journals. The object observed by the Editor [Wm. Bland,
M.D.] in the execution of this little work, is to embody in it every Pact or
Observation found in those Journals elucidated, wherever the Brevity of the
Originals appears productive of Obscurity, with such explanatory Additions
as exhibit a clear or useful and interesting View of those hitherto unexplored
Begions which it describes.
Names of Subscribers to this Work, will be received at the Offices of the
Sydney Gazette and the Australian, and the Counting house of Messrs,

A JOURNAL of the INTERESTING TOUR from SYDNEY
to WESTERN PORT, by Messrs. Hovell and Hume.
As this Colonial Work, which is edited by Dr. Bland will tend to open the
eyes of the world, and especially of the Colonists, to the beauties and advan*
tages of this Southern Continent, it is suggested that timely Application may
be made for Copies, as the Number is unfortunately [necessarily] limited.
?Sydney Gazette, Oct. 14 to Dec. 13, 1826.
The work above announced [in 1825 & 1826] was delayed by the illness of the editor for
several months, when, a considerable portion having been actually printed, a new and most
unexpected obstacle to its progress occurred . . the printer had no more paper, and it
was impossible at that time to procure a supply of that article in the colony. The print-
ing of the publication does not appear to have been resumed until after Captain Sturt?s
expedition down the Murrumbidgee. The little volume was issued January, 183.1.
Letter to Mr. Secretary R. W. Hay, signed R. Stirling, dated Pirbright

The narrative of this journey was compiled by Dr. Bland from the journals of the ex-
plorers ; it begins Saturday, Oct. 2, 1824, and ends 24 January, An earlier title
page was printed erroneously describing the journey as made to ? Western Port ?? ; but
this appears to have been cancelled after some copies were issued, as well as the preface
(dated January 10, 1831): It was intended to include in the Appendix (1, 2) Narratives
of Sturt's Journeys, reprinted from the Sydney Gazette, Apl. 9, 1829, and May 13, 1830
(3) the Colonial Petition for a change of Government, signed by 3,625 inhabitants
(4) Prospectus and first report of a High School (5) Report of the Agricultural Society.
These are not found in copies which I have seen, but were printed separately. The
preface is missing from copies in the Colonial Office (one of which with corrections for a
new edition) was transmitted with a Despatch from Sir Richard Bourke, 29 Apl., 1837,
as well as a chart referred to in the Appendix on Western Port. Both may have been
cancelled. The preface was not reprinted in the second edition. All the MS. corrections
in corrected copy were, with one or two unimportant exceptions, made in the second edition
(1837): One marginal correction (p. 4 note) in 001. Office copy (which is interleaved, and
without the ? Dedication?) namely the word ?winter ? altered to ? summer,? has not
been corrected in the 1837 reprint. E.A.P.

. . . "On the 16th of December of the above year [1824] Messrs. Hovell and Hume
arrived at the northern shore of what they considered Western Port, notwithstanding
they looked in vain for the large island, which the charts show us lying within it. This
was, however, their mistake ; for, without being aware of it, they had actually effected
more than had been originally expected of them, for they had made the north-eastern
side of Port Phillip ?a large bay on the south coast, half a degree to the westward of the
point at which they had supposed themselves at the time to have arrived. Of this fact
the late Mr. Oxley was assured, when it was seen that their report of the extent of the Pott
they had made on the coast, and the country to the northward of it, agreed so fully with
what was known of both from the year 1803 ; when Port Phillip was visited by Mr. Charles
Grimes, at that time surveyor general, who was sent to survey the harbour more minutely
than either Captain Flinders, or the discoverer of it, lieut. John Murray, R.N., wereenabled,
in the preceding year to effect.? ? Jour. R. Geoo. Soc., vol. 11., p. 107. 1832. c

night within or out of doors ; a bushman, with large experience
among flocks and herds, and cattle and sheep yards ; full of
dry humour, intelligent, taking little interest in public affairs,
ever busy, hard-working, hospitable, cheerful. When he ap-
proached the nineties he grew infirm in body, but was clear in
mind. He was a great favorite with all the settlers?the very
men who swarmed in and took up selections on his run. He
gave them the use free of the big wool shed, and helped them in
very many ways.? He was a true friend of his church, and greatly
interested in education. It is men of that stamp who are deserv-
ing of all honourable mention. They did much to lay good
foundations on which the stable prosperity of our State is built.

Report of Council for Year ending 30<A June, 1913.
Seventeen members have been enrolled during the year, while'
seven have resigned, and two have died. It having been decided
on the occasion of the last annual meeting that no further addi-
tions were to be made, except under special circumstances, to
the roll of honorary and corresponding members, the roll has
been revised, with the result that the names of two honorary
members, with whom the society has lost touch, have been struck
off the list. This leaves a total, on 30th June, 1913, of one
hundred and sixty-nine (169) members (5 life, 95 ordinary, 11
corresponding, and 58 honorary).
Ten (10) general, seven (7) council, and two (2) committee
meetings have been held, and delegates have been appointed to
the council of the Melbourne meeting of the Australian Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science (January, 1913), and to the
Library Association of Victoria.
Continued assistance from the Government in the matter of
printing has enabled the Council to publish the second volume
of the Victorian Historical Magazine, although with some un-
avoidable delay. It is proposed in future to make the issue of
the Magazine concurrent with the financial year of the society,
and it is believed that no further difficulty will be experienced
in its publication at regular quarterly intervals.


The proposal to obtain clerical assistance, which was referred
to in the last report, has been carried into effect by the appoint-
ment of Miss F. Bayley as assistant secretary, in August last.
This lady now gives regular attendance at the rooms three days
a week, and, besides rendering considerable assistance to the
honorary secretary and honorary librarian, is preparing to com-
pile a card index of the society?s collection. Increased accom-
modation for the latter has been provided through the generosity
of the President, Sir Frank Madden, to whom the Council is
indebted for the gift of a handsome cedar cabinet; while a sum
of �5 has been specially devoted to otherwise improving the
means taken for preserving the various prints, documents, &c.,
which have been brought together.
With the courteous co-operation of the Honorable the Premier
and the Agent-General for the State, an endeavour has been
made to secure letters and other material from early colonists,
which may be in private possession in Great Britain. A letter
from the chairman of the Council on this subject was printed in
The Times of 30th September, 1913, and copied in a number of
ether English papers. The result has been a small but definite
addition to the material in the society?s hands.
Exchanges of publications have been established with the
Royal Society of Tasmania and the Wellington (N.Z.) Early
Settlers? and Historical Association, while courteous assistance
has been given by the librarian of the Mitchell Library, Sydney,
in matters which have been referred to him.
Your Council desire to record their satisfaction at the extension
of the spirit of historical research throughout Australia and
New Zealand, and are glad to believe that the activities of this
society have had a stimulating effect in this direction. The
work of the South Gippsland Sub-Centre is still actively pro-
gressing, and investigations are being made into the history of
the north-eastern portion of the State by Dr. Arthur Andrews,
of Albury, a member of the society.
The founders of the recently-established Wellington Early
Settlers ? and Historical Association in New Zealand, as well as
the projectors of the proposed Historical Society of Queensland,
have had such assistance as could be afforded by the experience
of this society to guide them, and the hand of fellowship has
been extended to the newly-formed Australian Numismatic
Society.
Note has been taken of the minor movements within the
boundaries of the State, although experience has proved that
the promoters of such movements are not yet alive to the ad-
vantages of organized co-operation. It is believed that the
growing interest which is manifested generally in the records


of the past is plainly indicative of an advance in the development
of national consciousness, and as such is worthy of the sympathy
of every intelligent Australian.
In conclusion, the Council desire once more to record their
appreciation of the services of Mr. A. W. Greig, the honorary
secretary to the society. Any success the society may have
achieved, and any services it may have rendered, are in the main
due to his efforts,
W. HARRISON MOORE,
Chairman of the Council.
South Qippsland Sub-Centre.
Second Annual Report.
During the period since our last annual meeting three meetings
have been held, at which, even if the attendances have been
small, good business has been transacted, and some interesting
contributions submitted. Foremost among our acquisitions during
the past year may be placed the framed collection of photographs,
for which a lodging place has been found in the shire hall. The
serial articles in the Gippsland Standard serve, it is hoped, a
useful purpose, if in no other way, at least to keep our sub-
centre in evidence. The sub-centre has also a valuable historical
asset in the papers rescued from the old store at Port Albert,
these being at present in the secretary?s hands for arrangement.
Our relationship with the parent society has been well main-
tained, and our efforts have been cordially acknowledged. Our
financial position is a sound one, as disclosed by the balance-
sheet, and it is hoped that there may be an increase of subscribing
members.

Port Phillip Intelligence. From the Cornwall Chronicle.
Weather 107� in the shade; hot winds prevailed; sheep shearing finished; Mr.
Ebden, formerly of the Cape, and another gentleman, arrived at the settlement from the
Murrumbidgee, and making arrangements for sending their wool from thence to Port
Phillip for shipment. Population increasing ; Henry Batman, Chief-constable'* very
obliging ? but maintains that Government Officers can take any land they like, even that
already possessed by others.
Government Surveyors spend their time in the township instead of being out on survey.
Commissary and Custom-house Officers much esteemed, in consequence of their gentle-
manly deportment and attention to their business. Police Department
extremely defective.
Timber scarce and dear. Sawyers much wanted, as are brickmakers. A few tailors
and shoemakers would find ample employment.
The first race was run on a beautiful Race Course, on the Bth February. The only
match which was well contested, and which afforded interest, was between horses the
property of Dr. Cotter and Mr. Brown ?which was won by the horse of the latter gentleman.
A fire destroyed a large hut on the evening of the Bth February?belonging to Messrs.
Solomon and Ferguson.

?The Governor and suite landed on the 4th March, being joined on the way up the river
by a motley procession of whale boats and other kinds. Some cheering and others popping
off musketry all the way in honour of His Excellency?s visit. At the wharf, the detach-
ment of the * King?s Own ? saluted, and, joined by the gentlemen present, we walked up
to the tents which had been erected by the Governor?s suite the day before (3rd). A small
tribe of natives, headed by Buckley, were drawn up on the roadside. On the Governor
reaching the tent he held a levee to receive the heads of departments and the settlers,
and then mounting his horse he rode round the township, and marked its boundaries,
which embraces about a mile of river frontage. At 5 o?clock he received a deputation
of the inhabitants, who presented an address of congratulation, &c. [see below], replied
to it, bowed them out, and we sat down to an excellent dinner in a very nice tent, well
furnished with furniture, eatables, and other comforts, for which we were indebted to
Captain Westmacott?s (the Governor?s aide-de-camp) activity, for he had arranged every-
thing. Mrs. Westmacott had sent Mrs. Lonsdale a goose and a gander. They were
landed intheboatthattook the Governor?sthings. No sooner was the poor goose brought up
than His Excellency?s cook knocked her down, cut her throat, and dished her up as a
second course at dinner.? ? I was very much pleased with the settlement. After pulling
for eight miles through a tea-tree scrub, which impenetrably clothes the low banks of the
river, the settlement suddenly burst upon our view. It is scattered of course, at present,
but consists of perhaps 30 or 40 huts. Some are of sods, others framed and weather-
boarded, others wattled and plastered. The framed houses have all been sent from
Sydney or Launceston. Were it not for the burnt up appearance of the place, the scenery
about the town would be beautiful, the ground undulates, and between the houses and
the river is an alluvial flat of good soil, in which good gardens may be formed, and very
productive too. We called upon the ladies of the place, and found them enduring great
discomfort, some living in mud hovels, others in tents, and others just entering their new
abodes, formed of ? wattle-and-dab.? ? ? The country, after a dry season, looking quite
burnt up.?
Between the 9th and 20th March the Governor?s party rode through the country, and
crossed the Weariby, the Little River, the Marabul, and the Barwon, to Geelong. An
account of Buckley and his history is given, the Stations of Clarke, Sams, and Aitken
were visited, and Mt. Macedon ascended.

rnHE following Address was presented to His Excellency the Governor
X at Port Phillip on the 4th instant: ??
To His Excellency Major-General Sir Richard Bourke, K.C.8.,
Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Territory of
New South Wales and its Dependencies, &c., &c.
Sir, We, the undersigned Inhabitants of Port Phillip, beg to approach your Excellency,
and offer our congratulations upon your safe arrival in this poition of your Government.
The pleasure we experience in thus addressing Your Excellency is enhanced by the
consideration that your arrival dissipates the reports which had reached us of your Excel-
lency?s resignation, and bids us hope that the Colony may continue to derive advantage
from the exercise of those talents which have always been excited for, and have tended
materially to advance its prosperity.
We cannot sufficiently thank your Excellency for having at so early a period visited
this newly settled Distiict. It is very impoitant that the sites of towns and other pre-
liminary arrangements should be speedily and efficiently determined and we congratulate
ourselves that these will be effected under your Excellency?s personal superintendence.
We may perhaps be allowed to express our regret that so few are present to meet your
Excellency on this occasion, but the absence of several from the Distiict, and the distant
position of the residences of others, have prevented many from manifesting their respect
and attachment to your Excellency and joining us in welcoming you to this interesting
and important part of New South Wales.
[Here follow the signatures.] Not printed. E.A.P.
His Excellency?s Answer.
Gentlemen. ? I thank you for the kind manner in which you have welcomed my arrival
in this promising Settlement. In the belief that its future progress will realise the sanguine
expectations entertained regarding it, I have felt very strongly the necessity of fixing
at once those points of occupation which are obviously of the greatest importance, in
order to prevent the waste of capital, and to give to the industry of the Settlers a perma-
nent direction. In coming among you for this purpose I see no reason notwithstanding
the temnorary effects of a dry summer to doubt the eminent adaptation of the vast tract
of country by which you are surrounded, to those lucrative pastoral objects which have
been so successfully pursued in other parts of this Colony. The fostering care of His
Majesty?s Government, will, I km assured, be never wanting to promote and protect to
the utmost those useful pursuits. The difficulty of introducing all the advantages of
order and society into remote Settlements is well known, but I trust that in the present
instance the praiseworthy disposition evinced by the inhabitants will continue to charac-
terise the District, and to aid the efforts of Government in securing its peace and prosperity.

ment into three Counties ?Melbourne, William, and Bourke, and marked out sites for
several Townships, with their streets, &c. The Governor had visited Geelong and Mount
Wellington [Macedon]. Several stores were being erected at Gellibrand?s Point, and
the settlement was progressing rapidly. The "Alexander M?Lcay ? had arrived from
Sydney, and was discharging her cargo. Neither the ? Regia ? nor ? Isabella ? [with

SALE OF TOWN ALLOTMENTS.
THE Governor having taken into consideration the number of persons who are now
occupying temporary habitations in and near the Township of Melbourne, waiting
for an opportunity of purchasing Allotments, has been pleased to direct that a ceitain
portion of the Allotments which have been recently laid out by order of His Excellency,
shall be disposed of by Public Auction on the spot:?Notice is therefore hereby given,
that at ten o?clock of the forenoon of the Ist day of June next, the Blocks numbered
respectively on the map of the town 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, will be put up to Auction at some
convenient place in the said Town.
His Excellency having also taken into consideration the advantage which the imme-
diate sale of a few allotments in Williams Town would afford to the commercial interests
of the district, has been pleased to direct that, at the same place and time above mentioned.
Seven Allotments, from 3 to 9 inclusive, of Block No. 3, as marked upon the map of that
Town, shall also be put up to Public Auction.
Further information respecting the above Allotments may be obtained from the Sur-
veyor-General; and respecting the Conditions of Sale from the Colonial Treasurer in
Sydney, and Police Magistrate at Melbourne.

Port Phillip.
Last night?s Government Gazette contains three notices respecting Port Philip. The first
is no less than an address to the Governor from the ? Settlers in the Western District of
Poit Philip ? who assure His Excellency of their ? esteem and respect for his person and
government.? Who these settlers are that thus address His Excellency, we are not
aware, but we cannot help thinking that it is a pity he does not stop where he seems to
be so much admired, for he may depend upon it that his ? broad and liberal admirers
are fast decreasing in number in this part of the Colony.? His Excellency of course,
receives with satisfaction, this loyal and dutiful address. The second notice is of more
consequence, announcing as it does, the first sale of Crown Lands in that district, which
is to take place at the new Township of Melbourne, on the Ist day of June next. The only
land to be put up is five blocks (we are not aware how many allotments are in a block)
in the Township of Melbourne, and seven allotments in the Township of Williams Town.
The third notice announces that the bay at the northern extremity of Port Philip is to be
called Hobson?s Bay, where the new Township of Williams Town has been laid out, and
?that a town to be called Melbourne has been laid out on the right bank of the River Yarra.

Address to Legislative Council, N.S.W.
Gentlemen,
After I had last the honor of addressing you, I received His Majesty?s
Gracious permission to open for location the Country adajcent to the Waters of Port
Phillip, and in the vicinity of Twofold Bay. The former of these Districts already contains
a population of above 500 souls, whilst more than 100,000 sheep may be found grazing
on its ample pastures. The expenses attending this occupation have been hitherto defrayed
from the revenues of Crown Lands, to which the sale of such lands within the District
will hereafter largely contribute. Copies of the communications which have passed
between His Majesty's Ministers and this government on the subject of these locations,
are laid on the Table for your information.

Port Phillip (from the Cornwall Chronicle).
" Our information from the new settlement this week is far from being satisfactory.
Rumour, with its hundred tongues, draws a frightful picture of the situation of the settlers.
We dare not state more at present, than that every probability exists of open hostility
between them and the natives.
? We would ask Mr. Commandant Lonsdale why he does not permit the soldiers, who
are supported by the country, to protect the inhabitants in the township. It seems that
Mr. Lonsdale keeps them at His residence, some distance from the settlement, and out of
sight of it altogether?it is said to protect himself !!!
? The township is marked out by the surveyors, who have left only one house (a public
house) to stand. Every other house is to come down. It is laid down in squares of
10 acres, each of which is to be divided into twenty allotments of | an acre each, which
will be sold (it is generally supposed) at Sydney.
? We arc in possession of some singular facts touching the Port Phillip Authorities and
the natives, which we refrain from publishing this week.?
?Tasmanian, April 7, 1837, p. 115 b.
Port Phillip.?We hear that some of Sir Richard Bourke?s newly constituted officers
at Port Phillip have already commenced jobbing in land and stock at that settlement.
It?s good to be early in the market 1

Address to Sir Richard Bourke, by General Inhabitants of N.S.W.,
sth Dec., 1837.
? Whilst Sydney has thus shared your attention, the interior of the Colony was not
neglected ....
? Under your sway too, it should bo borne in mind that whilst the flocks and herds
of the Colonists rapidly increased, you provided by suitable enactments for the safe and
advantageous occupation of the extended pastures which this public exigency required.
?We beg leave further, Sir, to acknowledge, that to your promptitude and decision,
we are mainly indebted for having secured to New South Wales the noble domain?
millions of fertile acres, which encompass the waters of Port Phillip. Impartial history
will yet record with what vigilant anxiety you watched the machinations of those who,
under the pretence of fictitious sales and artful representations, endeavoured on terms
injurious to the rights and interests of the Colony, to make a monopoly of those green and
boundless plains, which at no distant period are destined to be covered with our multi-
tudinous flocks and herds.

It is a fine pastoral country, but many parts have brackish water. The land near the
Settlement, except on the bank of the river (that contains good water) is not adapted
for agriculture. However a great deal might be improved.
