PREFACE
Having been requested by the Rev. E. S. Hughes, President of the East
Melbourne Cricket Club, to write its History, I can certainly say the work has
given me a great deal of pleasure, in going over the old affairs, in thought and
in discussion, with members who joined in after years. My connection, dating
from about 1858, has brought me into contact with a great number of men, young
and old, and I cannot help a keen feeling of pain at the knowledge of so many
good fellows having passed away who had assisted in their days in bringing the
Club to its present prosperous condition, either in the field or in its councils.
It is passing strange.to think that only four of the original members are left—
Messrs. C. Dight, W. E. P. Okeden, D. Wilkie and myself—and verily I may
say that during all these years my interest in the Club has never wavered.
Regarding my own connection with the Club, from the year iB6O onward
I occupied various positions, as Secretary for many years, as Committee-man,
and, at times, as Vice-President and Treasurer. Then, in 1885, I was elected
President, a position which I retained, with the exception of the 1886 season,
from that time until the year 1903. I then considered that it would be advan-
tageous for the Club to have a new President, and, after giving the matter careful
thought, decided upon resigning the position I had held so many years.
Though I relinquished the office, thinking that new influence would be of
benefit to the Club, my interest in its welfare and progress was in no way abated,
and it was with much gratification I received the following letter, embodying a
special resolution, by the Committee, on behalf of the Club: —
East Melbourne Cricket Club.
The Pavilion,
17th September, 1903.
Dear Sir, —
I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant,
expressing your wish to be relieved of the Office of President of the East
Melbourne Cricket Club, as you are unable to give the attention necessary
for the position, and to inform you that your communication was last
evening placed before the Committee, when the following resolution was
carried unanimously:—
“ That the Committee accept the resignation of Mr. Alfred E.
Clarke, from the Office of President of the East Melbourne Cricket
Club, and at the same time express their deep regret that he has found
it impossible to retain the position he has for so long filled with
honour to himself and advantage to the Club.”


The Committee further directed that a minute be inserted in the Club’s
Book, expressing, on behalf of the members, their gratitude for the
invaluable services rendered by yourself during your 45 years’ connection
with the Club, which has done so much to place it in its present proud
position.
You were then unanimously appointed to the position of Patron of
the Club, an Office specially created in your honour.
Believe me,
Yours most faithfully,
(Signed) S. McMICHAEL,
Honorary Secretary.
Mr. Alfred E. Clarke.
In compiling this history I am especially indebted to our old friend and
player, C. S. Carr, for his invaluable and able assistance all through. His excel-
lent knowledge of the game in which he took a prominent part, and his well known
love for his old Club, have materially assisted me. To Frank Laver lam also
indebted for the loan of his books and articles on our Club and its doings, and
Messrs. Okeden, Williams, Manning, Horan, Nodrum, and Scott have contributed
valuable and entertaining articles, which I am sure will be appreciated by all
cricketers.
A. E. CLARKE.

History of the E. M. C. C.
Before commencing the regular history of the East Melbourne Cricket Club,
I propose to make a few remarks about its antecedents and the Club from its more
social point of view.
About the year 1857, Messrs. Tom and Charley Dight, J. O. Moody, and
Fred. Moody, from the Scotch College, and all living at or near Abbotsford, used
to meet for practice in Bights’ Paddock, at Abbotsford, and on my joining, with
a few others, we called ourselves the Abbotsford Cricket Club. Later on, when
others left the College, they joined their old school chums, and for a short period
practised on a vacant piece of land on the south-east corner of Albert and
Clarendon Streets, East Melbourne, and, as members increased, we journeyed
down to a pitch in the Richmond Paddock, just outside the M.C.C. gates. A very
fair team of boys was then playing, and it was necessary to look out for a larger
piece of ground, and I have a great personal pleasure in the recollection that I
suggested trying to obtain the use of Captain Lonsdale’s cow paddock, and chang-
ing our name to the East Melbourne Cricket Club.
Naturally, the change of name was strongly objected to by some of the
founders of the Abbotsford Cricket Club, but, to strengthen our position in
applying for the ground, we considered it was necessary to identify ourselves
directly with the district. It was looked upon almost as a forlorn hope, as, only
a few months previously, the Press Cricket Club, a strong body in those days,
had applied for the same ground, and had been refused. However, after an
interview with the late Hon. W. C. Haines, a prominent man in the State, an
earnest supporter of cricket and all manly sports, assured of his advice and
active assistance, a few of us, including C. Bight, J. O. and F. Moody, H. J.
King (since Major King), Julius Wilkinson, and myself, had a requisition drawn
up, and, going out every night in pairs, we called on every resident for his signa-
ture and assistance, and so successful were we that in a week or two we were
prepared to arrange an interview with the Minister of Lands, the Hon. Dr.
Greaves. Again, with Mr. Haines’ active assistance, a very influential deputa-
tion, introduced by Mr. Joseph Wilkie, M.L.A., member for the district, presented
the petition, and it can be imagined with what pleasure we heard the worthy
doctor say he “ did not see how he could refuse such a request, supported as
it was.” Thereupon, acting on a hint from Mr. Haines, we juveniles cleared,
leaving the rest for him to settle, and we were very proud, on the 24th October,
i860, to receive notification from the Board of Land and Works, that the land
had been set apart for our use.
PETITION.
The following are the copies of letters, asking for deputation, of the
memorial, with the signatures, and minute of the approval of the Board;—
B


86 Elizabeth Street,
Melbourne,
12th October, iB6O.
The Honourable the President of the Board of Lands and Survey.
Sir, —Be pleased to inform me when you could receive a deputation
to be introduced by Mr. J. Wilkie, relative to a piece of land being granted
to the East Melbourne Cricket Club.
If agreeable, Tuesday next, 16th instant, would be convenient to the
members deputed.
I have the honour to remain, Sir,
Yours obediently,
A. E. CLARKE,
Hon. Sec..
To the President of the Board of Lands and Survey.
The Memorial of Members of the East Melbourne Cricket Club for
permission to use as a cricket ground a portion of Crown Lands in or
near such locality WE the undersigned
residents in or near East Melbourne many of whom have been affiliated
with the Abbotsford Cricket Club being desirous of promoting the manly
game of cricket on ground convenient to our respective residences solicit
you by authority or recommendation to permit us the regular use of a
suitable block of Crown land for the purpose of the game
for the Cricket Club.
We therefore and of which the under-
signed are for the most part members.

OF THE EAST MELBOURNE C.C.


THE BOARD OF LAND AND WORKS grant to the EAST
MELBOURNE CRICKET CLUB permission to play cricket on the
ground in question until further notice on the understanding that the
Club will have no exclusive right to the ground, that no trees be interfered
with and no fence erected.

S. G. and Sec.
Joseph Osland Moody informed and plan of site forwarded.

J. N. LEWIS.
We were gratified to have many personal expressions of goodwill and
pleasure from a large number of influential people, and to me there is singular
pleasure in the knowledge that not on any occasion since has there been cause on
the part of residents to regret the permission given.
Our work then commenced, for we found the ground more of a cow paddock
than we had anticipated. It was a very bog in winter, and cow holes knee-deep
almost occupied the whole surface.
The ground at that time extended to the north side of the present road on
our north boundary; some years later the City Council determined to make the
new road, or “straight cut,” and our boundary was shifted back to its present
line. As a “ quid pro quo,” we were given about a similar sized piece of land at
the lower end of the ground, taking our south boundary to the present line.
A large tree stood just about north of the north-east corner of the present
pavilion, which we judged would make a capable back-stop, and we levelled, to
the best of our ability, a practice pitch in front of it; and I well remember the
first ball bowled by F. Moody, a fast uncertain bowler, to Mr. W. E. Parry
Okeden, who was the President of the Club at that time. That ball first struck a
covered up cow-hole, then bounced to Mr. Okeden’s forehead, and, to our dis-
may, he dropped as if shot, and it took some little time to bring him round again.
So we once more had to go over and carefully prepare that pitch. We then
arranged for a width of 50 yards square in the centre of the ground to be pro-
perly turned over and prepared for a playing ground. That would be just about
in front of our present grand stand !!!
The first contract was let to George Cosstick and William Elliott, who did not
make much out of it, as they found many large boulders of bluestone just under
the surface, which, of course, had to be removed. Later on, this 50 yards was
extended by Jerry Bryant and George Cosstick to 75 yards, a playing space with
which we were all pleased. Those whose memory goes so far back will know
that we could not have had better advisers than Jerry Bryant, George Cosstick,
and William Elliott, and they had excellent ground to work on; but we were
hampered to a great extent by “ red tape ” regulations of the Board of Land and
Works, as every alteration made, or tree to be taken out, had to be sanctioned
by the Board, and on several occasions permission to remove trees or alter fences
was given some time after the trouble had ceased to exist, a rather risky, but
necessary, proceeding on our part.
The ground at that time was surrounded on the north and east sides by a
low two-rail fence, and this fence was the cause of no end of trouble, until we
nearly had a very serious accident.
The want of funds naturally required that we should go slow, but somehow


we were always improving, and improvements will go on so long as the Club
lasts.
One of the chief factors in the continued success of the Club is and always
has been, the esprit de corps, or camaraderie, of its members, who, at all times,
have played the game as sportsmen; and I cannot recall any single instance of
selfish play; but all went for the Club, and none for himself. It has always been
a source of pleasure to know how absolutely that feeling prevailed, and so long
as members stand together in that way nothing can tarnish the excellence of the
games played. Fortunately, the First Eleven, especially, has had men as captains
that any team would be proud of, and when I mention Dan Wilkie (1865/75), the
late Harry Boyle (1876/1893), and of late years, from 1893 to 1909, that
especially sound, genial and best of fellows, Frank Laver, it can readily be under-
stood teams must work well together with such leaders. I have many a time
heard the remark that “the East Melbourne team does not require a captain;
they fall into their places like machinery.” Very possibly true in one way; but
we have been favoured with good heads, and stout hearts as well, which makes
a team complete. So far has the idea of brotherhood been carried that many life-
long friendships have been formed among members; and, to my own knowledge,
and as members have many a time told me, membership of the Club has proved
of value to travellers. Of that I had a rather amusing instance when in New
Zealand some years ago. On going into the smoking-room of the hotel where
I was staying, I was suddenly greeted, “ Hullo! Mr. President,” from an old
member I had forgotten for years. Another instance was related to me just
lately, by one of our early members. A few months ago he was going through
Palmerston, in the north of Australia, when he was hailed in the street by a
similar, “ FIullo! East Melbourne.” Other instances I could relate from England
and from America, thus showing that we are unconsciously weaving a golden web
of friendship that can never die while life lasts.
The Club management has always been in the hands of Officers and Com-
mittee elected annually; and from these a Ground Committee, and a Match Com-
mittee, have been appointed, and friction between the different bodies has scarcely
been known.
The Club has every reason to be satisfied with the manner in which the
Ground Committee has worked. The excellent wickets at all times prepared, and
the care with which everything has been watched, have drawn forth repeated
marks of commendation from visitors. The satisfaction W. G. Grace expressed,
when he said he would like to carry the wicket about with him, cannot be for-
gotten. It is to be hoped the Club may always be as well served as it was in the
early days, by such men as Wilkie, Williams, Alice, Gaggin, Horan, Budd, Carr,
and others.
In the early days, when the Club was almost entirely confined to boys who
had just left school, it was always with a considerable amount of pride we were
dubbed “ Haines’ boys,” and the Press in those days continually referred to the
Club as “ the nursery of cricket,” a term it justly earned, and has maintained.
The “ Cricketers’ Guide ” for 1861, edited by the late W. J. Hammersley, writing
of the Club, says it “ has a peculiar interest for all cricketers, as it is composed
almost entirely of the ‘ colt ’ element, and it is satisfactory to know it is in a very
flourishing condition.”
“ Bell’s Life,” of 28th September, 1862, writes: “ The ground of the East
Melbourne Cricket Club, that nursery of cricketers, presents an appearance which


must be highly gratifying to its members. Under the superintendence of Jerry
Bryant, an area of 60 yards square has been ploughed and sown with rye grass,
now beginning to sprout; and thirty-six trees, presented by Dr. Mueller, have
been planted along the east and north sides. (These were all stolen, replaced,
and again annexed.—A.E.C.) The ground is in a very favourable state, and,
notwithstanding the rains, will, under energetic management, be a credit to ‘ the
colts,’ ” Again, in 1864, the same authority says: “ The ground of this rising Club
never looked better than at present, and excellent wickets can be obtained on it.”
It is highly satisfactory to know that even in those early days the E.M. wickets

had this good name, which has remained with them all through the past years.
Owing to considerable assistance given to us by some warm supporters, im-
provements on the ground were kept steadily going, and a tank was sunk —about
where the present stand is—to hold water from the Fitzroy Gardens and the
Richmond road, which was afterwards taken on to the ground. In this primitive
way was the playing ground watered. Steps were then taken to build a pavilion,
which was erected in 1865, afterwards removed and raised, and did good service
for many years, until the present brick structure was erected in 1885.


Thus was a Club started, that throughout its career —by the public spirit
of its members, the keenness of its players, as shown in Club, in Intercolonial,
and also in the great contests with England for the world’s supremacy—has had
a marked effect on the history of Australian cricket, and has secured a prominent
position among the cricketing institutions of the world.
Among the capable and sterling men connected with, and wedded to, the
Club, was O. C. Williams, who acted as Honorary Secretary during the years
1869 to 1873, and subsequently as a Committee-man, and Vice-President, a par-
ticularly hard and trying time. To this day it is a matter of great pleasure to
talk over with him the immense success of the Club we were both so wrapped up
in. How little did we know we were laying the foundation of a strong, powerful
Club that, before its Jubilee, should have attained a world-wide celebrity.
In those days, when it was difficult to get a Committee, and still more
O. C. WILLIAMS
DAN WILKIE
difficult to get a quorum, his bright, eager spirit overcame all difficulties; and
very critical times, but little understood by members, were got over. As a player
he ranked high, and it is a question if we ever had a better “ point.” He, with
Charley Allee, in one of the great matches for the Challenge Cup, assisted to break
the reign of terror that “ bowler of a century,” Frank Allan, had set up for all
cricketers. His excellent articles on “ Cricket ” are well remembered, and brought
the game before the public in a manner not excelled by any writer. Official duties


took him away all too soon; but it is a pleasure to know that he still retains his
warm friendship for the Club.
The name of Henry Hale Budd also stands out very prominently. Never
much of a player, he yet took the keenest interest in the game, and especially in
the E.M.C.C. As my coadjutor for many years, I sincerely regretted his loss.
A warm friend, a proud and constant supporter of the Club, a hard fighter for
its rights, his wmrk was invaluable. He and I had to work through, perhaps, the
most serious years of the Club's existence; and, though we did not alw r ays row
in the same boat, a valued and lasting friendship was formed. He had unbounded
confidence in his Club, and no time and no work were too much for him in its
service. At a very serious financial crisis, he manfully assisted me in pulling the
Club through its dire trouble, and no name can be more properly held in grateful
W. W. GAGGIN
H. H. BUDD
remembrance by well-wishers of the Club than his. He acted as Honorary Sec-
retary from 1875 to 1887, and died in 1905, retaining his interest in the welfare
of the Club to the very last.
There was an old confrere, H. M. Gooch (1877 to 1900), who acted as
member of Committee, as Honorary Treasurer, and for many years as Vice-
President, a real active, live V.P. He, like O. C. Williams, Harry Budd, and one


or two more, could never think enough, or do enough, to promote the Club’s in-
terests, until, as one by one, our old friends passed from the scene, he, too,
retired, feeling the new generation knew him not; but no one can measure his
value to the Club. For many years he was “ one of us.” At his death we lost
a very valuable helper, even though he had not held office for some years.
A very staunch supporter in William Riggall is still with us, and has occupied
the position of Vice-President since 1900. As both batsman and bowler, from
1866 to 1876, he had a well-earned position in the Club's Eleven, and we would
all be pleased to see him more frequently on the ground.
C. G. ALLEE
What a tower of strength W. W. Gaggin has been, and I can yet see him and
L. Goldsmith going in first in those great and exciting days of the Cup matches.
What games they were, and how strenuously fought by splendid teams! Life was
worth living in those days! It was in one of the Cup matches that this old hero,
with Goldsmith, first collared the “ Terror,” Frank Allan. It would be difficult to
estimate the numbers of beginners that Gaggin has encouraged, and his services
on the Committee, and, perhaps, more especially on the Ground Committee, were
invaluable : and though he gave up play many years ago, he still shows his


interest in the Club by his Saturday attendances, when fishing or shooting allows
him to get away.
Another name that comes forward very clearly is the much-lamented Charley
Allee. Surely a true Mark Tapley, invaluable in the team at all times, who never
had an idea of defeat until the numbers were up. He did yeoman service for
the Club on its Committees; an essentially capable and energetic member of the
Ground Committee, on two occasions he had special votes of thanks accorded
him, and was the man to whom the credit of the present stand, or, as he called
it, the “ Cow-shed,” belongs, and to whom many of our younger players owed
T. HORAN
debts of gratitude for unfailing kindness in coaching them in their early days at
the grand old game. We all felt the loss of a genial Club-mate in the fullest
sense of the word.
Looking back among the heroes of the Club, Thomas Horan stands out very
conspicuously. His splendid play qualified him to be one of the first chosen as a
member of the First and Third Australian Elevens—lß7B and 1882—two of the
strongest and most successful teams which have left Australia. In Club matches,
and in the Victorian Eleven, his performances were of a very high order, and it


is well worthy of note that no less than five members of this family have been
valued players for our Club; and were it not for District Cricket, there can be
little doubt that a Horan would still be in our team. Not only in the field has
Horan done great service to the game, but as a cricket-writer he has established
a world-wide reputation, and his friends may be counted by the thousand in every
land where the grand old game is played.
One of the earliest players to make a name for himself was W. H. Peryman
1860-76, a very capable all-round man, with a very powerful drive.
F. LAVER
H. F. BOYLE
In the Church, we are well represented by the Rev. George Tait, who took
part in the memorable match for the Coppin Challenge Cup, but unfortunately his
duties precluded his retaining his position in the Club after 1865.
Another prominent, and very valuable, member of the Club, was the late
H. F. Boyle, who for 20 years took part, not only in our Club matches, but in
Victorian Elevens, Australian Elevens, and on five occasions formed one of the
Eleven to visit England. A thorough sportsman, a keen cricketer, almost too
much of an enthusiast for the youth of to-day, a great favourite with friend and
opponent, he has left a name behind him that cannot be forgotten, and undoubtedly


he ably assisted to make our Club’s name honoured throughout the cricketing
world.
Yet another good old warrior for the Blue and White stripes for many years,
John Healy, is still with us, and though from natural causes he does not take part
in the game nowadays, he is a valued member of Committee, and can look back
with pleasure to the stirring matches he took an active part in; but for District
Cricket he would have the pleasure of watcning his son Gerald playing for the
Club he has so faithfully served for years.
And yet another genial Club-mate in Charles Forrester crosses our mind—
our Lion-hitter, who is said to have made the biggest hit on the ground. Unfor-
tunately, he seceded many years ago, and since then has occupied a prominent
position in the M.C.C.
Of later years, Frank Laver, from his position as captain of the team for
many years, as a member of Committee, and as the Club’s representative to the
C.C.A., has done yeoman service. His splendid batting and bowling averages
speak for themselves, and he may almost be looked upon as the backbone of the
team for many years. As a member of the Australian Elevens to visit England
in 1898, 1905, and 1908, and as manager for-the teams in 1905 and 1908, his
name has become a household word in both hemisphere^.
Peter McAlister, from his superb batting, and many unrivalled performances,
deserves special mention. He has been one of the most consistent and valued
players we have ever had. He also is a representative of the Club on the V.C.A.,
and visited England with the last Australian Eleven, and acted as the representa-
tive of the Board of Control.
S. McMichael is another who has greatly assisted to gain the splendid reputa-
tion the Club has earned, and to all cricketers it was a genuine treat to watch him
and McAlister in one of their great partnerships. In addition to his skill in the
field, he acted as Honorary Secretary from 1901 to 1905, and through his energy
and bonhomie he materially assisted to improve the position of the Club, and a
well-merited special vote of thanks was cordially approved of by the members.
A. S. Carter has been a wonderfully consistent player: Iw has the credit of
playing in more matches than any other member of the Club, and has scored
but little short of 10,000 runs.
One of the prominent representatives of the Club is J. A. Seitz, who learned
his cricket at the Scotch College, gravitated to our Club, and had the honour of
being chosen as the Rhodes Scholar in 1906. He promptly qualied for the Oxford
team, where he kept up his reputation as a capable batsman and brilliant field, and
had the fine average for his University of 32 for seven innings.
Many others could be mentioned, who have well deserved special recognition,
if space had permitted.
A matter well worthy of mention is that the First Eleven has been practically
led by only four men, and W. L. Rees, who was the first captain, only acted
for one year before his departure for New Zealand. He was followed by that
excellent, genial school chum, Dan. Wilkie, who occupied the position from
1861 to 1875, an< l who piloted the team with the greatest ability and bon-
homie in many strenuous and stirring games. Wilkie was followed by that
thorough judge of the game, and thorough “white man,” Harry Boyle; and
it is needless to say he did his best to keep his team up to its first-class standing,
and by his remarkable bowling performances with the Australian Elevens, in
1878 to 1884, more especially in England, gained a position amongst the greatest


cricketers that the world has ever seen; always good tempered, cheerful, a strict
sportsman, he and his team were at all times and places made very welcome, and
so highly was he appreciated that, when illness overtook him, a sum of no less
than £BOO was quickly subscribed to ease his latter days. He died in 1907, but
his memory is kept green in the Club by a “ Harry Boyle Trophy,” given by
-bis widow to perpetuate his memory, and the Committee determined that the
player whose aggregate of points, calculated on a basis fixed by the Committee,
for the season, is the highest, should be entitled to the trophy. Mr. H. F. Parsons
was the first winner, in 1909, and Mr. W. Scott is the winner for 1910.
Boyle was followed by an equally good, capable, and popular man, in our
present esteemed captain, Frank Laver, who has earned conspicuous success in
the Club, not only by his play, but by his sound judgment, geniality, and sports-
manlike conduct at all times. It has been a source of unbounded satisfaction,
not only to all East Melbourne members, but to the community generally, that
he has made such a name for himself with Australian Elevens in England, in 1899,
1905, and 1908, and takes rank amongst the foremost cricketers of all time. It
is needless to say that under him the Club’s team has maintained its prestige very
fully, and I trust he may still longer be with us to lead a grand team on from
success to success. A peculiar incident occurred to Laver that is worth mention-
ing. The highest individual score was held by W. Bruce (M.C.C.) for many
years, until Laver topped him in a match against St. Kilda, when he scored 352
not out, but his position as top scorer was very soon taken from him by
J. Worrall, who scored 417 in a match against University in 1896.
Of course during the years these men have been the recognised Club’s cap-
tains, others have occasionally been required to act, and the Club has been singu-
larly fortunate in having capable and valuable assistants.
It seems somewhat strange, as the Club emanated from the Scotch College,
that comparatively few of the players from that College have joined our ranks of
late years. Strenuous efforts have been made to foster school cricket, and
matches with the Scotch College and the Melbourne Church of England Grammar
School were, at one time, regular items on the programme, but at no time did
they cause much enthusiasm, though some who afterwards attained front rank
took part in the games. From the comparatively small interest they created,
they have been dropped out altogether of late years. It is a remarkable fact that
but few public school boys are keen in following the game after school days are
over.
Another matter that may be mentioned is that throughout our career we have
mainly relied on our own members as players. The number of professionals
played by the Club might be numbered on the fingers of one’s hands, and, without
in any way wishing to detract from the performances of the paid men, there is
no question but that we were most successful when we relied entirely on our
own members.
The Club has been particularly fortunate in its curators, who have in the
long course of years only numbered three—McAlpine, a big, brawny Scotchman,
being the first, followed by McAulay, better known as “ Old Mac,” a man who
bossed the ground for very many years, and so qood and true a man was he, and
such a general favourite with members, caused in a great measure, doubtless, by
his, and his “ Tarrier’s ” many peculiarities, that on his retirement, upon the
work getting too heavy for him. a life pension was granted him. Onlv a few
years ago did he pass away, after serving the Church of England Grammar


School in a similar capacity, and it is pleasing to know that he was an equal
favourite with all the boys on that ground. Old Mac was followed at East by
the present occupier, F. Capewell, and how well and conscientiously he takes care
of the ground, and the Club’s properties, is well known to all members at the
present day. The Club, indeed, has been particularly successful in its curators.
Very early in our career our first match was played against the M.C.C., and
it will doubtless interest many old supporters of cricket to recall names long for-
gotten, but who, in their days, were the giants of the cricket field. I annex
the score, which shows a clever victory for our Club.

During the years 1860-61, a Challenge Cup, given by the late Hon. G. S.
Coppin, which had to be held by a Club for two years, without a defeat, before
it became possessed of it, was being played for. The Richmond Cricket Club was
then at its zenith, having an especially strong team, which had enabled them
to hold the Cup for about one year and ten months, when the idea occurred to
me that we should challenge the invincibles, as we were entitled to play fifteen
men against their eleven. I was secretary at the time, and my Committee scouted
the idea, notwithstanding that I pointed out very strongly that we had nothing
to lose if we were beaten. If, on the other hand, we were fortunate enough to
win, or play up well, we had everything to gain. But it was useless, they
would not hear of playing, and the meeting broke up. I, however, felt so strongly
about it that I wrote, and posted a challenge, on my own responsibility, the imme-
diate result of which left me without a Committee, who all resigned. The players,
however, backed me up well. A team was chosen, the game played, and we won
by an innings. I have always considered winning that match was the making
of the Club, so I offer no apology in giving the full score: —

With regard to this Cup, it was handed bacK to Mr. Coppin by our Club,
owing to an unfortunate dispute about the playing of the return match with
Richmond.
The old adage, “ Nothing succeeds like success,” proved very true, as we
opened the following season with a large accession of members, and, except for a
few years, when cricket generally was at a very low ebb, the Club has never gone
back, and has produced perhaps more first-class young players than any other
Club in the State, and has a splendid record of matches played and won.
The defeat of the hitherto invincible R.C.C. Eleven, in 1861, at once lifted
the Club from a position of tolerant patronage at the hands of the older estab-
lished clubs, to a footing of equality, somewhat grudgingly admitted, it is true,
but which could not be withheld, owing to the excellence of the collective play
of the teams it sent forth, the merit of the numerous young players constantly
emerging under its aegis, and their proved ability to hold their own against the
leading clubs, who were compelled to look to their laurels, and put their best
elevens in the field in order to avoid defeat by their young and militant rival.
Some lasting record should be kept of the doings of those who, at this time,
laid the foundations of the Club’s proud position in the cricket world, and did
their work under difficulties, of which the colt of the present day can have but
little conception. The ground was almost as nature made it, dependent, until
1863, on water filched from the drains running into the gully having its course
through the Fitzroy Gardens; attention being confined to a square in the centre,
and the practice pitches such as would severely try the nerve of those who now
receive their coaching on billiard-table wickets, and side nets, and all the other
accessories deemed sine qua non for the education of the modern batsman.
The Bights, Moodys and McDonalds, who bore the brunt of the earlier
struggles, now give way to a younger generation, who naturally gravitated to
Jolimont from the two great public schools —“ Scotch ” and “ Grammar. Sink-
ing their school rivalries, and cementing friendships in their enthusiasm for their
Club, that spirit of camaraderie grew up which has always been a feature of
the Club, and has been a great factor in its success and progress. The eleven
in ’62-3 is mainly chosen from C. O. Barrass, Dan. Wilkie, C. Blanchard, Jas.
Smith, Jas. McPherson, J. Phillips, F. McDonald, G. O’Mullane, D. Carson, G.
Bromby, R. Jacomb, C. E. Griffiths, J. Conway. In ’63-4, Conway has been an-
nexed by M.C.C., and the first ten continued to be the mainstay, but the ranks are
added to by the adhesion of H. Yewers, Jas. Wilkie and G. Hedley, while in the
following year, of the original eleven, only Dan. Wilkie, Geo. Tait, J. C. Stewart
and McPherson play constantly. In ’64-5, W. L. Rees, the first-elected captain,
returns to Melbourne, and takes a prominent part, his activity, especially in
coaching young players, being of great service, and recruits are found in W.
Campbell (from the second), Allan Campbell, and Birkmyre, and we find R. W.
War dill not above taking an occasional hand with the Club, though a Melbourne
crack.
In 1865, we find “ Bell’s Life,” then the cricketing authority of the colony,
saying: “ The East Melbourne Club has grown up since the good old times;
fathered at Abbotsford, and reared by a Clarke, it has come to years of maturity
to be coached by a Rees. Pitching its tent in ominous proximity to
it threatens in time to dwarf the parent stem with its luxurious branches.”
In 1865-6 Rees does not play so frequently, and the eleven suffers a great


loss in the untimely death of George O'Mullane. At this time Dan. W ilkie
stands out prominently as a stalwart playing member, not only throughout the
decade, but well on into the ’7o’s, captaining the team for many years, and noted
in that capacity for “ keeping his tail up ” in the most adverse circumstances,
and for his judicious handling of the team, while his bowling was a terror to
his opponents. “ Longstop ” says of him, in 1865: “ A member of that dis-
tinguished Club, the East Melbourne, entirely colonial-taught, has all what may
be termed the makings of a great cricketer, and had his lot been cast in England
he would have ranked high. As a slow bowler he has no equal here, varies pace
and pitch, a peculiar delivery, with considerable spin, and delivers a difficult
ball, if not more so than the renowned Tinley.”
Wilkie was first chosen as a batsman, and to him belongs the credit of having
scored the first century made by a member of the Club, while in 1865-6 he
secured a “ double first,” averaging 29.6 in batting, and 7.14 per wicket in
bowling. Originally a slow round-arm bowler of the "Farmer” Bennett style
with the advent of the renowned Tinley, it became his ambition to shine as an
underhand bowler, and upon his success in this direction his fame mainly rests.
He reduced underhand bowling to a fine art. Though his bowling is known as
“ slows,” that is not entirely a true definition, for at times he delivered a ball
fast and low, which came off the pitch like lightning, and was the undoing of
many a first-class batsman. Some of Wilkie’s performances are remarkable. The
flower of Victorian batting could do nothing against him in 1865, and against
North Tasmania, playing for Victoria, he obtained seven for 17 in the first
innings, and eleven for n in the second; his average for the match reading; 114
balls, 28 runs, 2 maidens, 18 wickets. At Hobart, when it was complained that
he was not made sufficient use of, he obtained, in the second innings, eight for
30, off 78 balls, and closed the season with an average in first-class matches of
6.3 per wicket, Tommy Wills being first with 5.6, and Conway third with 6.9
per wicket. Besides being in the first flight as a player, he was a prominent
member of Committee for years, and with his brothers—James, David and George
—all staunch East Melbourne men—constitute the only quartette of brothers who
have represented the Club at one and the same time.
W. L. Rees had been known in the game for many years, and when a mere
youth was selected to represent the Colony in the first intercolonial match, played
at Sydney, in 1857. During the time he played for East Melbourne, he frequently
acted as captain, and at all times did his utmost to coach and bring forward
young players, and forward the interests of the Club.
George O’Mullane (1865-6), whose earty death, at the age of 24, robbed
the Club of one of its brightest ornaments, and the colony of one described as "a
cricketer, who acquired his play here (being a native, and an old Grammar
School boy), and of whom the colony was proud, being by far the best
seen representing Victoria, and but little inferior to the best performers
in the old country.” A fine, free hitter, with plenty of nerve, he treated
all bowlers alike, and as a wicketkeeper he was a long way ahead of any the colony
had up to that time brought out.
Jas. McPherson, as an all-round cricketer, was one of the most useful in
the Club, a capital bowler, a good field anywhere, and a dangerous batsman of


the forcing style. Acting as Secretary, in ’66-7, to his energy the signal success
of the Club in that season was largely ascribed. With Dan. Wilkie and H.
Yewers —another of the general utility class, and a bowler with a nice easy
delivery and some pace—he bore the brunt of the bowling for the team.
The batting mainstays of the Club at this period were;—J. Phillips—sur-
named “The Potter” —an early exponent of the art of stonewalling; J. Horan
(elder brother of the renowned T. Horan, of later years), who, though only in
his teens, was accorded first rank by the ablest judges; and Willie Campbell,
dubbed, “ Our Colonial Jupp,” who was considered Horan’s only rival in the
colony for “ elegance and neatness.” Willie Campbell, as is well known, for
many years held the eye of the cricketing public as a leading batsman; but
Horan’s promising career was cut short by his early death in 1868.
Ben. James, that sterling cricketer, afterwards one of the pioneers of the
Carlton Club, and a selector of teams for the colony, must not be forgotten, for
he did yeoman’s service for East Melbourne as a bowler, and puzzled opposing
batsmen by bringing his hand from his back and “ taking the ball from his
waistcoat pocket ” in the act of delivery.
The progress of the Club resulted in the accumulation of “ almost a super-
abundance of players,” which, as is mournfully stated in one of the reports,
“ greatly increased the Club’s expenditure on material,” but, as a corollary, a
very strong Second Eleven was sent into the field. Towards the latter end of
the sixties, and in the early seventies, the line of demarcation between the two
elevens was difficult to draw, and good men were well content to play in the
Second—one or two actually making it a grievance that they were transferred
to the First! A match for a dinner between the two elevens was talked of, but
never came to a head
A famous trio now make their appearance, in L. Goldsmith, Donald Campbell
and W. W. Gaggin, followed by C. G. Alice, C. Forrester, C. Carr and T. Hep-
burn (“ Languid Tom”). Charlie Allee and Gaggin, those staunch supporters
and sterling cricketers, remained in harness, and took leading positions for
some twenty years. The latter is still among us, and Alice’s connection with the
Club only ceased with his greatly mourned death in 1895.
Many notable performances stand to the credit of the Club record in this
decade, in addition to the early victory over Richmond, previously mentioned.
In 1865, somewhat of a sensation was created in the overthrow of the Victorian
Eleven by a Jolimont 16. The match took place on the 9th and nth November.
The East were without the services of three of their best men, in Phillips, Rees
and Crawley, but nevertheless succeeded in winning by four wickets. “ The
features of East’s innings were the batting of W. Campbell in the first and Dan
Wilkie in the second.” “ Bell’s Life ” report says: “ The only way to account for
the defeat of the Eleven is that the bowling of Wilkie was too good for them,
well backed up by a field judiciously placed, and the generalship on the other
side not being of the best. Wilkie’s slows seemed to stick up the most expert
batsmen. Turner was the only one to play them at all properly, and he gave
a chance.” Other chances, if taken, would have further reduced the Eleven’s
score. The following is the full score of this match: —

While making good its footing among the “ first rankers,” the management
of the Club had the courage to inaugurate Country matches—no light task in
those days when means of communication were comparatively limited. Great
interest was taken in these games, and to quote “ Bell’s Life ” again, “ The East
Melbourne Club are entitled to great credit for having originated these matches
which do so much towards improving cricket.”
The first of these Country Clubs to try conclusions was Corio, so early as
December, iB6O, the “Pivot” being successful by 13 runs. Home and home
AN ‘OLD TIME” MATCH ON E.M.C.G.
games were played with varying success for many years. Geelong was followed
by Castlemaine, visited in 1862, and Ballarat and Bendigo in 1864.
Castlemaine at this time was a great Cricket centre and thought “ no small
beer ” of itself, its representatives being the only ones in the Colonies to lower
the colours of the All England Eleven under H. H. Stephenson. Its team com-
prised Makinson (who captained the United N.S.W. and Victorian team against
All England, and at Castlemaine scored 36 against them in the memorable defeat
referred to), a free and wristy player, T. and B. Butterworth (Vic. XI.), Brooker,


Amos, Wilson, Lewis, Taylor, West, Morris, and Bull. The ground was noted
for its roughness. East Melbourne on their first essay scored 44 and 61 (Amos
and Brooker doing the damage) against 32 and 76 for eight wickets by Castle-
maine. The ground being too rough for Conway's bowling, no less than 43
sundries were included in the Castlemaine total of 108.
These matches were played regularly up to 1865, East Melbourne winning
three out of four. There was then a break in the continuity with the passing
away of the early enthusiasts of the Goldfield, but in later years, as though in
recompense for that early enterprise, Castlemaine was to supply us with Laver
and Costello.
The first match against Ballarat was played on the M.C.C. Ground, kindly
lent for the occasion. A very warm team was put in the field by the Golden City,
including Wills, Redfern, Morris, Sweeney, and Figgis, shining lights in the
Victorian Eleven. The match is reported as one of “ the most attractive of the
many played by the First Eleven of ‘ the Colts’ Club, ” the country men winning
by 38 runs on the first innings—E.M., 92 and one for 45 ; Ballarat, 130.
We returned the visit in the following month, but were equally unsuccessful,
losing the game by 32 runs. This was the forerunner of many pleasant trips to
the beautiful City of the West, but, unlike the velvety turf of the Eastern Oval,
as we now know it, the ground is spoken of as “ rough and bumpy.”
Bendigo came into line in 1864 —Bendigo forever famous for giving us Boyle,
Midwinter and Harry, names known wherever cricket is played. Crawshaw.
Slumi and Elliot were good bowlers, with Boyle coming to the fore; Beswicke
and the Mackays were also of great value to their district, Boyle scoring his
first success in first-class cricket against the Victorian Eleven in the following
year.
The years 1870-1880 embrace probably the most interesting period of our
cricket history; not only did Club cricket reach the zenith of its popularity, absorb
public interest and attract large attendances Saturday after Saturday in a manner
unprecedented and never since approached, but it saw the advent of the great
“ W. G.,” and his Eleven, followed by periodical visits of All England teams, and,
finally, the throwing down of the gauntlet to Old England, and the departure of
the first Australian Eleven to try conclusions with the flower of English Cricket
on level terms.
So far as our own Club is concerned, these are years which every clubman
must look back upon with pride. They made the name of Jolimont known in
the far corners of the earth and put the coping stone on the work of the pioneers
of the previous decade. The Club had been receiving steady accession to the
ranks of its players, chiefly from the Public Schools. Old school friendships
were renewed and lifelong friendships formed, and to a greater extent perhaps
than at any other period of our history its members were indeed a happy family:
chums in the truest sense of the word on and off the field. They devoted them-
selves to the service of the Club with all the enthusiasm of youth and the single-
mindedness of true cricketers. First and Second Elevens alike were imbued with
this spirit, and were equally successful in the field. The Second was for many
years practically invincible and contained in its ranks the equals of those in the
First. Thus the dropping out at times of three or four from the main team made
hardly perceptible difference in its strength.


SEASON 1871-2
The season of 1871-2 is further noteworthy for the advent of Boyle, who,
having distinguished himself early in the season in the Colts' Match, showed out
prominently in the first of a series of matches inaugurated by E.M.C.C. against
teams chosen from the combined Country districts of the Colony. In the first of
these matches, the country team was composed of Beswicke, Boyle, Glen, Mid-
winter (Sandhurst), Reid and Docker (Wangaratta), Scates, Pamphilon, Sweeney
and Hurst (Ballarat), Aitken, Lynch, and Lewis (Castlemaine). In this match
THE BOHEMIANS
A TEAM COMPOSED MAINLY OF E.M.C.C. PLAYERS.
Boyle scored 40, and obtained three wickets at a cost of 27, Wilkie securing seven
of the Country men for 16. The Bendigonian was immediately spotted by Messrs.
Wardill, Hammers ly, and Wilkie, and after another good performance at Geelong,
this time in the ranks of E.M.C.C., was placed in the Victorian Eleven, where he
amply justified his selection. In the match at Geelong, Boyle scored 60 on an
almost impossible wicket, but was unsuccessful with the ball. The bowling tor
us was done by the irrepressible Wilkie, six for 17, and Darke four for 7, in the


second innings of Geelong. In 1870, a second Challenge Cup was subscribed for
by the M.C.C., S.M.C.C., and E.M.C.C., and matches were controlled by a
Committee, consisting of Messrs. W. H. Handfield, W. J. Hunting and A. E.
Clarke, representing their respective Clubs. Play for this Cup extended over
about 10 years, and not only produced cricket of the highest order, but to my
knowledge was the immediate cause of the Australian Eleven being started.
Messrs. Hunting, L. Goldsmith and I were so much impressed with the splendid
displays of cricket that we were in negotiation with New Zealand to send an
Australian Eleven there, when the late Jack Conway got wind of the idea, and
with some Sydney friends carried the project through to send the team Home,
with what results are well known, and it is always with the greatest pleasure 1
recall the many grand teams that have so worthily maintained the
supremacy of Australian Cricket, and to know that representatives of our Club
have repeatedly and conspicuously asserted themselves.
In the years that the Challenge Cup was in competition, probably the most
stirring in AGctorian Cricket history, our teams always took very prominent parts,
and some matches were played that cannot be easily forgotten; for instance, the
Lost Ball Match, played by us versus M.C.C. in 1871, in which the excitement
got so high that it even invaded the scorers’ sanctuary, and that old prince of
scorers, the late C. Hipwell, declared he could not make up his book. The Cap-
tain of M.C.C., the late R. W. Wardill, and I took possession of the scoring books
and locked them up in a Milner’s safe, where they could not be touched till
Monday morning, when the scorers were able to agree that we had won the game
by 2 runs.
The establishment of the Second Challenge Cup was without doubt a great
factor in concentrating public interest in club cricket, and the exciting contests
it resulted in gave a great impetus, and brought many votaries to the game. The
notable events of the period are therefore largely made up of performances in
these matches. M.C.C. and South having tried conclusions, the former became
the holders, and were promptly challenged by us, but, coming out ahead by four
wickets, remained in possession until April, 1871.
The first match for the Challenge Cup in which we were engaged was played
in January, 1871; Melbourne having defeated S.M., were called upon to show their
ability to hold their own against E.M.C.C. We were weakened by the absence
of Don Campbell, who had gone home to Oxford, and W. W. Gaggin, who was
rusticating in the Western District, teaching the young idea of those parts how
to fish and shoot. Our first essay resulted in 234, of which W. Campbell con-
tributed 71, and Dan Wilkie 54. Melbourne responded with 186, and rosy views
of our chances were taken. In our second innings, four wickets were down for
129, but on resuming, the disappointing total was only 163, of which Riggall made
60 in good style. However, this left Melbourne with 213 to get, which they
managed to do with the loss of six wickets.
Our second attempt was more successful, M.C.C. conceding 14 men, the only
occasion upon which we accepted the handicap we were entitled to through Mel-
bourne playing professionals. Our Committee made a dead sure thing of this
match in accepting the handicap. M.C.C. were unable to do anything against the
bowling of Barnes, a fast little bowler hailing from the “ tight little island,” who
paralysed the mighty men of Melbourne, obtaining seven wickets for 17 in the
first innings, out of a total of 29, and nine for 41 in the second : Melbourne’s dual
effort totalling 137. Our score being 775, of which L. Goldsmith supplied 59 and


H. Jennings 40 We thus scored our first Cup victory in this decade by an
innings and 38 runs.
South Melbourne challenged us, and were accorded a handicap of 15 men,
notwithstanding which we cantered in easy winners in an innings and 121 runs.
The chief scorers in our total of 221 were the two “ G.’s,” Gaggin (46) and Gold-
smith (33), most of the remainder of our team adding their quota. Allee, five
for 24 and five for 15, and David Wilkie, four for 12, secured the S.M. wickets
for 73 and 27.
In the following month, the historical “ Lost Ball ” match was played. How
that match stirred the pulse of the Cricket community! There is no doubt that
both teams suffered from nerves in that last memorable innings of M.C.C. O. C.
Williams, “ the indefatigable ” at point, tore his hair and raved; Wilkie, “ the
Captain of the age,” was rampant; Goldsmith broke the fence and almost broke
his neck; and when Fred. Marsden, as “ sub.,” missed Willie Ford, even the level-
headed, ever cool Gaggin found matters warm enough! And the excitement in
the Pavilion! The young lions of the East Second Eleven roared themselves
hoarse, and ruffled the dignity of veteran Melbourne supporters. A great game!
We want a few such nowadays to rouse public interest in Club matches. This
was, probably, the most exciting match in which we, or any other club took part.

THE LOST BALL MATCH.
“ Mid-on ” —at our special request —writes a description of the match as
follows: —■
Although in the course of pavilion chats most young Jolimonters of the
present generation have heard mention made of “the famous lost ball match,”
few of them have perhaps any distinct knowledge of the facts and circumstances
connected with that memorable occurrence, the discussion of which is a perennial
delight to the grey-beards, who remember it, and who are happily still on the
scene. As I was one of the spectators who witnessed the match, and the particu-
lar incident which has made it famous, I gladly acceded to Mr. A. E. Clarke’s
request that I would jot down some of the facts for the information of the
younger generation, to whom it is merely a legend. Young cricketers of to-day
will find it difficult to realise and believe that an ordinary club match of thirty
years ago, between East and South Melbourne, has been known to attract 5000
or 6000 spectators on each of several consecutive Saturdays, yet I can assure
them, from my own experience and recollection, that such was the case in those

E.M.C.C. IN THE “LOST BALL” MATCH


brave old days in which men played cricket—aye, and football, too —not for gain
or emolument, but for genuine love of true sport, and in a spirit of healthy and
honourable athletic rivalry. Well! The famous “lost ball match" was played at
East Melbourne, in December, 1871, between the first elevens of East Melbourne
and Melbourne. The respective captains were Dan. Wilkie (East Melbourne)
and Dick Wardill (Melbourne), elder brother of the present Secretary of the
Melbourne Cricket Club. Melbourne were batting, and Willie Ford (son of the
late Dr. Ford, of Collins-street) hit Darke to leg. The ball hopped over the two-
railed fence, which then bounded the ground, and lodged in the Jolimont-road.
After it like a streak sped L. Goldsmith (the since well-known barrister), who, in
endeavouring to jump the fence, hit the top rail, and Came a terrific cropper as
the flimsy rail gave way. All feared that “ Goldie ” was seriously injured, as he
lay still, after falling, and Dan. Wilkie ran out to his assistance. Boundary
allowances had not then been adopted, and, therefore, the wily Dan., while solicit-
ous for his injured comrade, called out to Billy Gaggin to check the runs for
lost ball appeal. When the Melbourne batsmen had completed their fifth run,
Gaggin sang out, “ Lost Ballthe batsmen ceased running, and six runs were
recorded to the credit of Willie Ford. Wilkie found Goldsmith dazed, and unable
to rise, and it was a considerable time before he recovered from the effects of
the severe shock. Eventually an intensely exciting finish resulted in East Mel-
bourne winning the match by two runs, and it was the narrowness of that margin
which led to protracted discussion and correspondence between the two captains
and through the columns of the press. Dick Wardill averred that when Gaggin
called “ Lost ball,” the Melbourne batsmen had run 8 runs, and were therefore
entitled to that number of runs for the stroke. Now! lam not going to pretend
that I remember exactly how many runs were actually completed, but I think that
it is hardly necessary to ask any cricketer who then knew, or who now knows
“ Billy ” Gaggin, whether he was likely to have made such a “ bloomer!” Per-
sonally, I could just about as easily imagine “ Old Gagg.” losing a trout after he
had once got him well hooked, or missing a snipe within fair range, or omitting
to score “ his nob ” if he held the Jack of the deck-head suit in crib!
However, East Melbourne’s victory was never upset, though the question as
to whether the lost ball appeal should have been allowed has always been a moot
point. Goldsmith, on recovering, said that although unable to rise, he could
see the ball—which, indeed, I believe was never actually lost to sight—and it
was probably his statement to that effect which strengthened the Melbourne skipper
in his view that the batsmen should have been allowed to “ run it out.”
Cricketers generally are aware that the rule bearing on the subject says: “ If a
ball in play ‘ cannot be found or recovered,’ any fieldsman may call ‘Lost ball,’
when the ball shall be dead; six runs shall be added to the score, but if more than
six runs have been run before ‘ Lost ball ’ has been called, as many runs as have
been run shall be scored.”
Such as I remember them are the facts connected with the famous “ Lost
Ball ” match, and whether the umpires were right or wrong, or premature in
deciding, the fact remains, that the match will for all time be recorded amongst
East Melbourne’s innumerable victories.
The exact personnel of the East Melbourne team on that memorable occasion
may perhaps not be remembered by even the oldest members of the Club, and
in the belief that it may interest them I append the list:—Dan. Wilkie, the well


known Melbourne solicitor, who is still hale and hearty —“ the only Dan.,” who
was without a peer as an underhand bowler, and his brother Dave, who, with lom
Hope—now Dr. Hope, of Geelong— used to win the challenge pairs year after
year at the Melbourne Regatta, W. Riggall (of Blake and Riggall), L. Goldsmith
and W. W. Gaggin, the two G.'s, who used to open East Melbourne’s defence as
regularly as “the two Macs ' have in more recent years; E. D. Heather, who for
over a quarter of a century has been secretary to the Victorian Cricket Associa-
tion, and who in those days used to reel off centuries in match after match; Owen
Williams, now manager of the Bank of Australasia in Sydney; Willie Campbell,
who used to be chosen in the Victorian Eleven for long-stopping—an important
feature of the game at that time —and who was also an elegant batsman; Charley
AH ee —dear old “ Smiler” of glorious and happy memory; W. H. Peryman, who
still retains his interest in cricket, and whose batting and fielding were of the
highest order; and my old school fellow, W. F. Darke, one of the best bowlers
that Victoria has produced. Names to be conjured with, those! Good luck and
long life to those of them who are still amongst us, and peace to the memories of
the happily less numerous contingent of that famous team of old Jolimonters
who now sleep beneath the turf they loved so well.
Following on the “ Lost Ball ” match, we were called upon to concede a
handicap of 15 to South Melbourne, and another very close thing was witnessed,
South defeating us by 6 runs only. The match proved a chapter of surprises.
In the first innings we responded with only 141 to our opponents’ set of 178, but
when Darke and Alice sent the whole 15 to the rightabout for 65 in the second
innings, it looked a real good thing for Jolimont; then six of our best wickets
fell for 24, of which Goldsmith had made 13. Things looked very blue. Captain
Dan and Charlie Alice came to the rescue, and the thermometer rapidly rose as
they gradually increased the score; both fell eventually, Wilkie making 37, and
Alice 18 (first innings 30 not out). Riggall followed his captain’s example, but
was not supported, and with six runs short of the required score, the innings
came to an end; Riggall 12 not out, and “ well set.”
“ The Australasian,” in its report of the match, remarks; “ Cup matches, the
happy thought of Mr. A. E. Clarke, the much abused ‘ A. E. C.,’ have done much,
very much to stir and revive interest in the ‘ noble game.’ ” The game was watched
by cricketers representing every suburban club; there were spectators, too, from
Ballarat, Geelong, and even Sandhurst. “ What’s the row over yonder ?” said
a sober-minded, demure passenger in a Richmond ’bus, as we were getting out
at the ground. “ A cricket match.” “ Only a cricket match ?” was the con-
temptuous rejoinder; “why they make more row over it than a mob of our
larrikins would in a fight.”
SEASON 1872-3
Not till the following season did we have an opportunity of regaining our
lost laurels. How we did so deserves a special record, for this was another
memorable Cup match. The “ Argus ” report says: “ Nothing less than an Inter-
colonial match, and that on a holiday, has ever drawn so many people to witness
a match on a Metropolitan Cricket ground. Both teams were very confident.
E.M. had said ever since the previous match with South, that they were sure to
regain the Cup on the next occasion, and repeated the statement even at the close


of the first day’s play, when their opponents had obtained what was in many
places considered too strong a start to overtake." The match took place on
iith and 18th, 1873, and witnessed the boiling-over of what appeared a
certain pot for the South after the first innings. The first day of the match saw
our team woefully out of form. The unabated confidence of our boys in them-
selves after the poor showing in all departments, save the bowling, where Charlie
Alice rose to the occasion on the first day, brought forth satirical comments in
the Press, and “ the decadence of East Melbourne ” was mourned, notwith-
standing our reputation for playing an uphill game. The supporters of our
Southern rivals were very jubilant, but “sweet are the uses of adversity," the blood
of Jolimont was up, W ilkie had all his men down regularly during the following
week, and every man was given half an hour’s batting, with the field placed to
Coates, the famous Sydney left-hander, who volunteered his service as coach, in
addition to our own trundlers, and by the following Saturday every one was as
“ fit as a fiddle."
Notwithstanding the great heat of the day, which militated against the
attendance, the game was resumed on the second day in the presence of thousands
of spectators, and with any odds on South in the Pavilion, but the week’s assiduous
attention to systematic practice bore fruit. The elation of Southern supporters
was cut short, and confidence gave place to anxiety as Alice, Boyle and Wyndham
dismissed their team for 53. Alice bowled well throughout the innings, and so
did Boyle up to the time of the change to Wyndham, a judicious move, the re-
maining wickets falling in quick time, only 6 runs being hit off WJyndham. “ The
batting of South was not brilliant. At the same time, it must be stated that but for
the magnificent fielding of East Melbourne, the score would have been much
higher. In all points of the game East Melbourne worked well, and not a single
instance of bad fielding could be noticed.”—(“Argus.”)
With Allan, Conway and Alexander, the three foremost bowlers of the
Colony, against them, and having in mind the form displayed in the first innings,
East Melbourne, outside its team and immediate supporters, was not considered
equal to the 89 required, but the two “ G.’s,” Gaggin and Goldsmith, to whom
this will ever remain a red letter day in the calendar, went in at 4.30, and in an
hour’s time had 70 on the board by most brilliant batting. Gaggin was caught
and bowled by Allan. O. C. Williams took his place, and Goldsmith immediately
fell (as though he could not get on without Gaggin). Carr next handled the bat,
and he scored away just as Gaggin and Goldsmith had done until 89 was called,
and the game won. Too much praise cannot be given to Alice, Boyle and Wynd-
ham, but Gaggin and Goldsmith were the heroes of the occasion through their
masterly display in the second innings. The “ Australasian ” says; “An easy
win for the Hillites was anticipated. There was a considerable sum of money,
we believe, depending on the match, and, if report be true, the Jolimonters, as
the evening grew on, waxed exceedingly jolly over it, whereas in the opponents’,
camp, there was wailing and gnashing of teeth, and perhaps more.”
The jollity of East may be summed up in the words “ Carton’s Dinner ”
an impromptu dinner given in honour of the team by some supporters on their
return to town, at which the Challenge Cup was produced, and bumpers of
champagne imbibed out of it by every one of the team in turn. Some prominent
members of our friendly rivals (M.C.C.) strolled in also, and insisted on broach-
ing a case in congratulation of a well-earned victory.' Some of the more jovial
spirits visited the Pavilion, and, having sent old Mac on a wild goose chase up


to Flinders-street, hoisted his pet pair of watering pants as a pennant, with a
famous pair of ancient boots beneath, on the Club’s flag-pole, where they re-
mained until they met Mac’s horrified gaze on the following day (Sunday) as
good people were coming out of church.

The trophy having once more passed into our hands, we were quickly called
upon to defend our title, M.C.C. being the challengers, and the first of the disputed
games ornamenting the series was commenced in February. This proved one
of the most exciting of the many games played during this period—
but, unfortunately, it was never played to' a finish —being abandoned
at a most interesting stage, owing to the departure of the principal players
on either side for Sydney, to take part in the Intercolonial. A trip
to Sydney now means a few hours or so by rail; then, the only com-
munication between the cities being by sea, it entailed a voyage, frequently a very
rough one, of two or three days each way, and a day or two to recover one’s
sea-legs; the whole trip, therefore, running into three weeks. On this occasion,
the time was exceptionally prolonged in consequence of Sydney being visited by
a tropical downpour, starting a day or two after the team arrived. As a result
fully a month elapsed before the interrupted game could be resumed. The match
itself provided such good cricket, and w r as so open, that a feeling of regret was
expressed by all supporters of the game at the unsatisfactory termination. Mel-
bourne, in their first innings, scored no, which we bettered by placing 146 on
the scoring board. Allee obtained seven of the Melbourne wickets for 54, and
the evenness of our batting is shown in the fact that eight of the team reached
double figures in the neighbourhood of 20. The second innings of Melbourne
was played on a blazing hot-wind day, and mainly owing to Fanning, 112 not
out, and Gibson 51, a total of 315 was realised; this left us 269 to get, which we
considered well within our reach, as our batting w 7 as very strong. We lost five
wickets for 159, and the in required was by no means a hard task in view of
the class of batsmen to go in. Negotiations had been opened by our captain
with the M.C.C. captain for an extra day prior to the departure of the Inter-
colonial team, but the two captains could not agree. An impasse was therefore
reached, and to get the Cup Committee out of the difficulty our Club voluntarily
handed over the Cup to them. The Cup Committee, in their wisdom, decided that
neither Club should be interested, and ordered S.M. and Carlton, both already
defeated, to compete. Carlton, with a handicap of 15, succumbed to South by
the narrow margin of 13 runs.


SEASON 1873-4
In the following season, South having defeated Carlton once more, our
chance came again. S.M. had in the meantime been strengthened by the recruiting
of Midwinter, while on the other hand we were without Boyle and Goldsmith,
and the team generally was " all abroad ” for want of practice, partly owing to
the wet season interfering with the pitches, and partly owing to
our overweening confidence in our ability to “ lick creation ” with or without
THE JOLIMONTERS
AGAINST 15 OF OVENS DISTRICT, AT WANGARATTA, APRIL, 1873
preparation, for which we paid dearly. Though we were defeated by 115 runs,
it was by no means a runaway match, and the vicissitudes of the game, together
with the reputation of the team for getting out of a tight corner, which had
become proverbial, maintained public interest to the last. The match was started
on Prince of Wales’ Birthday (Nov. 9) in wretched, blustering weather, all
against good cricket; S.M., assisted by loose fielding (a rare occurrence with
an E.M. team), totted up 128; Wyndham obtaining seven for 70. Our first
essay only gave 68, O. C. Williams and Willie Campbell being the only two on


our side to reach double figures. South, in their second, obtained 159. Our
bowling was very loose; T. Horan was the only one of seven bowlers tried, to
get a length at all, and he came out with four for 20. Fortunately, our fielding,
in marked contrast to that of the first innings, was of a very high order, and
was instrumental in keeping the runs down. With 219 to get, a close finish was
anticipated; Gaggin and Elliott started the innings, the latter’s wicket falling just
before time—one for 14. Stewart joined Gaggin when the game was resumed
on the following Saturday. Between them, a good stand was made, and E.M.
stock rose considerably, but received a set-back when Gaggin fell a victim to
Allan, the board showing —2 —l8 —30. Riggall, Horan, W. Campbell, and O. C.
Williams, four of our best, falling in rapid succession, caused the Jolimont tem-
perature to fall to zero as the miserable record of seven for 43 was hoisted.
Carr joined Stewart, and “ we were treated to the best cricket of the match,’’
and Jolimont was jubilant once more as 100 appeared on the board. The jubila-
tion was short-lived, as, without any addition to the score, Stewart was bowled
by Allan for 48, receiving a due recognition for his sterling display on his return
to the Pavilion, and being presented with a bat. To the astonishment of everyone,
the match was over in a few minutes : Alice, Wilkie and Wyndham adding only
one run between them. The innings closed for 104. Stewart (48), Carr (26
not out), and Gaggin (18) accounted for 92, the other eight men only contributing
7 off the bat between them!
This was the year of Grace's visit, and it was galling to drop from first place
and see the public attention, to which we had been so long accustomed, focussed
on M.C.C. and South, when the Englishmen arrived. The lesson was, however,
taken to heart, and late in the season we recovered our prestige, and before its
close were once more the holders of the peregrinating Cup.
The next contest between M.C.C. and South having ended in “ Dispute No.
2 ” regarding the proper definition of “ dead ” ball (this was a more personal
matter, and more bitter than the first), the Cup Committee decreed that the Cup
should be “ dead ” to both of those Clubs for the time being, and, for the sake of
poetic justice probably, decided that East and Richmond should compete for it
on the ground of the former. Richmond, making their first appearance on the
Cup stage, were allowed 15 men. This proved a very friendly game, though
partaking much of the nature of an internecine struggle, no less than six of the
best of our Second, who frequently played in the First, being included in the
Richmond team, which was captained by an old Jolimonter also, the evergreen
W. H. Peryman. Carr, who was run out for 80, and Elliott 65, were our chief
contributors to our total of 285. Horan got five wickets for 29 in the first, and
five for 57 in the second innings, D. Wilkie two for 25, and four for 17.
We wound up the season by defeating Carlton 15 with ten wickets to spare.
SEASON 1874-5
The season of 1874-5 opened well in the defeat of M.C.C. by ten wickets;
Barnes, the tear-away bowler, and Boyle playing havoc with the Melbourne bats-
men, the former taking seven wickets for 31, and Boyle three for 44, while Horan
took five for 82 in the second innings. Elliott was top-scorer for us with 50.
run out.
Then followed the famous “ Centuries ” match with South Melbourne, cora


mencecl on 21st November, which appeared fated never to reach finality, owing
to interruptions by rain, and long scoring, but we eventually brought it to an end
on 1 st and 2nd January, 1875. South scored 170 in their first innings, which we
topped by 89, Horan making 119 of the total, and things looked rosy for us, but
in South's second the memorable stand by B. B. Cooper (117) and James Sleight
(124) was made, and their score of 483 left us with 395 to get. We were unequal
to the task; what chance we had being destroyed by the numerous postponements.
This extraordinary match was played on our ground, and lasting over five Satur-
days, was witnessed by such crowds that Blondin, who was performing on the
heights where Government House now stands, declared in disgust that Melbourne
had gone mad over Cricket!
Feeling seemed to grow as time went on, and the red and white of
S.M., or the blue and white of E.M., was as a red rag to a wild bull to the
partisans of the two Clubs, but it never seemed to interfere with a good dinner
at the old Cafe de Paris after a match, when riva'ls would meet to laugh at the
“ Pond ”-erous jokes of mine host!

We reversed the verdict in the following month, or, rather, we started to
do so then, for this proved another interminable game, lasting from February till
17th April, when it was decided in our favour by 59 runs; Hastings (75 and 13)
and Boyle (g and 62) being the chief scorers on our side, the latter taking four
wickets for 57 in the first, and six for 56 in the second innings of South.
SEASON 1875-6
We retained the Cup unbeaten throughout the whole of the season 1875-6,
defeating in turn South Melbourne (twice), Melbourne, and St. Kilda (15). We
won the first of the South Melbourne matches by an innings and 151 runs, Willie
Campbell playing a splendid innings of 114 not out, while Gaggin contributed 88,
Hastings 73, Forrester 54, and Boyle 47 to our total of 466. Forrester gave a
great exhibition of hitting until run out, his score including a magnificent hit for
6 right out of the ground into Jolimont road.
The second match against our old Southern rivals was closer, but we still
had three wickets to the good. The M.C.C. match was, as usual, between the
two dubs, of a close and exciting character, but we came home by 27, while that
against St. Kilda was uninteresting, they being defeated in an innings.

“CLUB” CHALLENGE CUP
List and Particulars of Matches played by E.M.C.C.


SEASON 1876-7
After defeating St. Kilda (18) in an innings at the beginning of the season
of 1876-7, the match being signalised by Horan making 132, not out, in great
style, and taking six wickets for 10 runs, we met our Waterloo, Richmond (16)
defeating us by 135 runs. Richmond having a very strong combination, we were
unduly handicapped.
The Richmond match concludes the record of this famous Challenge Cup, so
far as the E.M.C.C. is concerned, for we did not again enter into competition for
it. Alelbourne, Richmond, South Melbourne, St. Kilda, and the Civil Service
continued the contests until January, 1878, when the M.C.C. finally handed the
trophy back to the Committee, or the Association, and it has never been traced
since.
The Cup, in its earlier stages, was of incalculable benefit to Victorian Cricket.
The long drawn-out games of its later years, and the miserable disputes it gave
rise to in certain cases caused it to fall into disrepute, but the bickerings and
petty jealousies for which it was blamed arose in great measure from personal
antipathies, which would have caused trouble in any case, and have not been
absent right down to the present day.
The greatest trouble throughout the decade was undoubtedly faulty umpiring,
and we were great sufferers by it. A system of appointing partisans, irrespective
of their qualifications, gave rise to unpleasant suspicions, and numerous decisions
were often put down to unfairness, when probably due to incapacity.
Unfortunately, the intense feeling between all the Clubs was later carried
much further between M.C.C. and ourselves, with the result that no matches took
place between the Clubs for two years ! this undoubtedly being brought about by
our strong efforts to obtain some of the good matches on our ground. This state
of things was happily ended by a cordial invitation to us to play a match on the
M.C. ground, and dine with the officers and players, which gave Melbourne
“ Punch ” an opportunity to produce a very happy cartoon, showing the Mel-
bourne and East Melbourne presidents embracing each other. Whatever other
results of the trouble there may have been, there is no doubt about the E.M.
players continually asserting their equality in the field with their wealthier neigh-
bours.

SEASON 1877-8
The loss of the Cup to Richmond (16) terminated our interest in these
contests, but we avenged our defeat in the return match, when on level terms
later in the season we got home by five wickets. Richmond were very strong this
season, especially in bowling, with Kendall, Hodges and Whiteoak. We also were
successful in both matches against our old foes of the “ Hill,” winning the first
by 88 runs, and the second by eight wickets; and, notwithstanding our being
handicapped out of the Cup, wound up a most successful season with a record
of 11 matches won, 2 drawn. 2 lost, our only successful opponents besides the
Richmond 16 being our good Ballarat friends, who had “clowned” us by 15.
The two drawn games were against Corio, very much in our favour, the figures
being E.M. 189, Corio nine for 35, and against Carlton, in which we had a good
chance, Carlton (15) scoring 111, and E.M. 115 and three for 59.
SEASON 1878-9
On 9th and 16th November, 1878, we met our old antagonists, M.C.C., for
the first time since January, 1876, and while the resumption of these historic
games was hailed with satisfaction by all supporters of cricket, the result of the
match, an easy win for E.M.C.C., was all our most ardent sympathisers could
wish for. Though an easy win in the end, the outcome was in doubt until Gaggin
and Don Campbell put an end to the chances of M.C.C., the former with 47, net
out. and the latter 36. How interesting the match was during its progress may
be judged by the result of the first innings, which was a tie —102 all. Walshe
was our standby in bowling, obtaining the fine average of seven for 45, our
principal scorers being Don Campbell 20, and Allee 19. Melbourne in the second
innings was dismissed for 87, owing to the bowling of Mackay of the Scotch
College, who obtained five for 16, aided by splendid fielding, J. Healy shining
especially in this direction, as did Elliott behind the wickets.
The second match of the season, in February, 1879, was equally interesting
as indeed may be said of almost every game that has been played between these
two great rivals for the cricketing supremacy of the colony. The match was
indeed a draw, the figures, however, pointing to a probable victory for us. Our
first effort brought forth the meagre total of 91. but, as we succeeded in despatch-
ing our opponents for 120, not much harm was done by our batting failures. Our
second innings was more productive, and the respectable total of 306 left Mel-
bourne with 277 to get. Three of their wickets had fallen for 85 at the conclusion
of the match.

ON THE ELEVEN'S RETURN FROM ENGLAND E.M.C.G., DECEMBER 12, 13. 14, 1878


THE EIGHTIES
As we get into the eighties the lions of the seventies are gradually dropping
out, and changes in the personnel of the team take place by degrees. Gaggin and
Goldsmith no longer lead the van, and tempora mutantnr Captain Dan has become
a Bohemian, but the places of those who retire '' by effluxion of time ” or
other causes, are worthily filled by Groube, Scott, Musgrove, Trapp, Gordon, and
McShane, and they, with Boyle, Horan, Healy, Hastings, and Alice of the old
brigade, make up a very strong combination.
Club Cricket having fallen tnto the doldrums, Air. John Cleeland, the well-
known boniface and sportsman, with the object of infusing fresh vitality into
these games, presented the Association in 1881-2 with a Cup for competition,
which was supplemented by handsome prizes for batting and bowling averages
by Mr. Oliver McLean and Mr. Rosier respectively. With the strong team
1 epi esenting E.M., it was fully expected that the Club would maintain its prestige
and wind up the season either as winners or runners-up, but the proverbial un-
certainty of the game was well exemplified, for after defeating Fitzroy in hollow
fashion (the scores being_E.M. 247, Fitzroy 31 and 25), we were fated to receive
one of the severest defeats, at the hands of S.M., ever experienced during the
long series of matches between us. Though there was little to choose between
the teams, the combination of the firm of Geo. Palmer and W. H. Cooper, backed
up by the incomparable Jack Blackham, upset all our calculations, and the out-
come was the very unusual experience of an innings defeat. Blackham stumped
no less than five of our team in the first innings. The result of this defeat was
that “ subsequent proceedings interested us no more,” and the destination of the
Cup was eventually the M.C.C. Pavilion.
The continual advent of English Teams, and the formation and departure
of successive Australian Elevens, naturally had a very malign influence alike
on the finances of the Club, and the public interest in their doings. Mr.
Oliver McLean, realising this, at the instigation, I believe, of Dave Scott,
made another attempt to revive the former Cup excitement, by offering for com-
petition an exceptionally handsome and valuable trophy, especially manufactured
in England, which eventually became ours. This Cup had to be held by the Club
passing through one whole season without a defeat, the donor desiring thus to
give a wholesome stimulus to the game, at a time when there was no counter-
acting influences in the shape of an English visit. This object was in
some measure attained, though the invariable success of our teams, and
the _ one-sided victories they scored in almost every case, militated
against the matches arousing the absorbing interest attaching to the
old Cup. In this contest, matches of which the Club may well be proud, were
won by us. Fitzroy were beaten in an innings and 606 runs (E.M. 685, Fitzroy
55 and 19), Sandridge by an innings and 203 runs, and Hotham by an innings
J 463 runs. Our closest game was against Richmond, won by runs, an
exciting throughout. Our first innings produced 205, McShane playing a
first-class innings of 51, our second totalled 203, the individual scoring being
fairly equally divided between Groube, Scott, Robertson, Alice, and Horan
Richmond scored 127 and 197. The flaw in our play was the fielding, which was
net up to the Club’s reputation. The final match against South Melbourne was
commenced on the 10th March, and lasted for four Saturdays and eight evenings


and was witnessed by over 30,000 people. We put up 234 in our first innings,
to which South responded with 171. In our second innings we had nine wickets
down for 186, when a notable, and, I believe, a record, stand to this day, for
tenth wicket, was made b) r Groube and Geo. Gordon, who put up 174 runs before
Groube was dismissed by a fine ball from J. W. Trumble. To this set, South
only answered with 162, and we thus won by 261 runs. All the other Clubs
having been twice defeated, it was naturally assumed that we were the winners
of the Cup, the original conditions having provided that it should be won in one
season, but man proposes, and the Cup Committee disposes. Then followed the
remarkable decisions of that body —(1) That Richmond and South play another
match. This was actually commenced, I think, but Richmond, objecting to playing
half an hour each evening into the winter, it was abandoned. (2) That E.M.
and South play another game. Both Clubs objecting to commencing a match
so late in the season, the final oracular judgment was delivered, viz., that the
Cup season dc facto ended on March 31st, and therefore everything occurring
after that date had never occurred at all, and the official state of the game was—
E.M. 234, South eight wickets for 124, and ordered the match to be resumed at
the commencement of the following season. The game was eventually brought
to a conclusion on 18th October, 1884, some seven months after it commenced!
This second edition ended in our winning by nine wickets, South not adding to
their total in the first innings and scoring 134 in their second. In the following
month we were called upon to have a final struggle for the coveted trophy with
Richmond, which we won by an innings and 77 runs, and Mr. Justice Williams,
as President of the V.C.A., had the pleasure of handing over the Cup to Mr.
Justice Williams, as President of the E.M.C.C. The Cup was afterwards pre-
sented to me by the Club, and members may be well assured that it is very
highly prized, not only by r myself, but also by all the members of my family.
The final match was played by E.M. v. Richmond on November 22-26, and
December 6th, 1884, with the following results;—

McLEAN CUP
NOTE. —Cup Committee decided to be
played over again as from 31st March,
official result therefore being:
East Melbourne
234 & 1 for 26 = 11 wkts. 260
South Melbourne
124 & 135 = 20 wkts. 259
Which would make average per
wicket, 35.743 against 9.669




All through these matches we were represented by probably the best teams
we have ever put out, who played well together, everyone “ for the state and
none for himself ’; but this, it is a pleasure to know, has been an unfailing
characteristic of members throughout the Club’s career.
Although we did not meet our old opponents, M.C.C., in the Cup contests,
two matches were played, both being drawn. In the first we scored 421 for nine
wickets, Lewis 112, Groube 85, McShane 62, Robertson 35, and Boyle 34, all
contributing to the discomfort of the Melbourne bowlers. The second match,
the final game of the season, resulted in M.C.C. scoring 200 with the loss of four
wickets, so outside of the Cup honours were fairly easy between the two leading
Clubs, but we practically played a third match against them, in which we were
successful. I refer to the match against St. Kilda on December 6th, the keenest
and most exciting contest of the season, where the victory even by the narrow
margin of 3 runs was one the Club had every reason to be proud of, considering
the powerful Eleven put in the field by St. Kilda, which included eight of the
best of the M.C.C. players, Alexander, Bonnor, Tobin, Kelly, Vint, McEvoy,
Mcllwraith, Lawler, and Crook. Robertson and Palmer, however, succeeded in
dismissing this formidable combination for the modest total of 122, the former
getting five for 35, and the latter five for 39. Our total of 125 was made up
chiefly by Scott (45), E. P. Hastings (24), and Palmer (23). For St. Kilda,
Tobin, of Melbourne, was in fine form, taking seven of our wickets for 45.
Most of the matches of the season resulted in hollow victories, our Elevens
scoring very heavily. The only defeat suffered was at the hands of the Union
Jack 15, when the Club was represented by a very weak team. The season was
also signalised by a tie, the second in our history, and, like the first, against a
country team, at Dandenong, each side on a bad wicket, scoring 71 runs.
The record at the close of the season showed 24 matches played, 14 won,
8 drawn, 1 tied, and 1 lost.

As we get into the nineties, names familiar to present-day cricketers obtain
prominence, and with the exception of Horan and Boyle, none of the old lions
of the seventies and early eighties remain. In 1887-8 Frank Laver emerged, his
performances with the Castlemaine Club marking him out as a star, and promptly
securing his position in the Club’s first Eleven. Then in 1888-9, Bendigo, to
whom we were indebted for Boyle, provided another sterling acquisition in that
genuine cricketer, J. Harry; C. Letcher, T. Flynn, and Drysdale also make their
bow. Horan still kept a leading position in the batting department, with P.
Lewis a close attendant. The season of 1889-90 saw a considerable numerical
increase in candidates for first Eleven honours, S. McMichael and P. McAlister,
a pair which has done yeoman service for the past twenty years, being among
the number. The Club was second on the Pennant, the sole defeat experienced
being at the hands of M.C.C., when we suffered by unfavourable weather con-
ditions.
Frank Laver and C. Letcher were our mainstays in Bowling, the former in
all matches obtaining ninety-four wickets (the greatest number credited up to
that time to a single bowler of the E.M. in one season) at a cost of 7.2 runs per
wicket. J. Harry headed the Batting average, with P. McAlister a good second.
SEASON 1890-1
The 1890-1 season was a very busy one, enjoyable country trips being made.
Daylesford and Castlemaine and Kyneton formed the Easter trip, and of the
five defeats suffered during the season, our Country friends accounted for three,
Kyneton twice defeating us, once by 11, and once by 18 runs, while the Dayles-
ford and District 15 also lowered our colours with a margin of 11. No less
E


than 17 matches out of a total of 33 played were drawn. South Melbourne
inflicted a crushing defeat early in the year, we having to face a total of 225 on
a wicket softened by rain, the match being decided on the first innings, the other
defeat being by North Melbourne, where we lost by the narrow margin of 12
runs. Notwithstanding the loss of three of our leading players in F. Lewis,
Worrall, and Drysdale, the Club well maintained its reputation, and very even
performances were put up individually, but J. Harry stood out prominently with
the splendid record of 30 innings for an average of 45.2, S. Deane coming next
wdth 38.5 for 16 innings, and also in the latter part of the season worthily filling
the gap caused by the loss of Percy Lewis behind the wickets.
In Bowling, the veteran Boyle, and Laver, J. Bruce, and J. Harry are the
mainstays, the first-named securing 52 wickets at an average of 9 runs per
wicket, while Laver bowled 2509 balls for 67 wickets, costing 11.8 per wicket.
A notable victory was scored against Essendon by an innings and 425 runs, W.
McGivern playing a brilliant innings for 103, Laver 92, and Harry 74, Horan,
mirabile dictu J being the only one of the team who did not score substantial
double figures. Our total was 523, and Essendon were dismissed for 57, and 41.
Laver got eleven for 50, and Bruce eight for 36.
SEASON 1891-2
The following season, 1891-2, the team continued singularly unfortunate in
the Pennant Competition, owing to the disappointing batting of the Eleven as a
whole, from which McMichael stood out prominently as an exception, his per-
formances being far above those of any batsman, and constituting the most
striking feature for the year. In Pennant matches he secured an average of
40.5 for ten innings. The season was signalised by the visit of Lord
Sheffield's team, and the match played against that team, which resulted in a
very favourable draw, was probably the best performance put up by us, and
was distinctly ahead of that of any other Club in the Association against the
English Eleven. A faultless 55 by A. S. Carter was the striking incident of our
innings, and gained him great encomiums from comrades and opponents alike.
Letcher was the most successful bowler for us, obtaining five wickets for 63;
Boyle, two for 28; Laver, two for 54; and Costello, one for 54, securing the
rest. In this match the two veterans, P>oyle and Horan, played, being the only
two players taking active part in cricket at the time who played against AV.G.
on his first visit.

It was intended to secure a professional coach for the Club from his Lord-
ship’s team, but though £3OO was guaranteed by members of the Club, for two
years, the inducement was insufficient, and the project fell through.
Boyle, Letcher and Laver bore the brunt of the bowling for the season, the
two first-named running very close in averages, with 12.3 and 12.7 per wicket, re-
spectively. In the match against the Combined Schools (16), won by four runs,
Boyle and Laver did the “ hat trick ” in successive overs.


The Club, during this season, had to mourn the loss of an old and honoured
supporter, in Mr. E. S. Chapman, " Augur,” of the “ Australasian,” who had
followed the Club through good and ill-fortune for several decades, and whose
engaging personality endeared him to every one of our members.
SEASON 1892-3
This, 1892-93, proved a sensational and prosperous season, that is, prosper-
ous in every direction save in pennant cricket, the premiership again eluding us,
and the Club falling to fifth place. Though occupying this unsatisfactory position,
F. LAVER S RECORD SCORE
AGAINST ST. KILDA. 1893
the vagaries of the game were well exemplified in the Club defeating, in a brilliant
manner, an eleven chosen from all the associated clubs, and comprising all the
best talent of the colony outside our own members. It was in this year that Laver
made his memorable Australian record of 352 not out ; and, though heading the
batting list of general averages for all the clubs, with the fine record of 65.30 runs
—the best of the year in Australia—and with a still better average for the Club


of 75 runs per innings, and 43.51 in intercolonials, he was not considered good
enough for a place in the Australian Eleven! He and J. Harry were the only
two batsmen playing in Melbourne senior teams who scored over 1000 runs in
the season. P. Costello, in a season of remarkably high scoring, in Saturday
matches, carried off the bowling honours, with the splendid record of 1359 balls
and 34 wickets, an average of 15.7 per wicket. Castlemaine (Laver and Costello)
was well to the front this year, as in many others during the decade, with Bendigo,
in the persons of Harry and Boyle, in close attendance.
Scores of 581 against University, in one day; 448 for nine wickets, also in
one day; and the grand score of 713, in one innings, against St. Kilda, testify
to the batting triumphs of the team during the season, as does the pronounced
victory over Fitzroy; while our failures against South Melbourne, University, and
North Melbourne, in pennant games, only accentuate the proverbial uncertainty
of the game.

The Easter trip covered Warrnambool and Hamilton. Warrnambool was
defeated by an innings and 98 runs, Laver (59), Steel (55), Vautin (34), Carter
(24) and Boyle (22), contributing most of our total of 241. Warrnambool’s two
tries produced 72 and 7x, Laver getting seven wickets and Boyle three, in the
first; and Carter and Bruce five each in the second innings of the seasiders. After
enjoying the hospitality of the local club, visiting Tower Hill and other places of
interest in that charming locality, and having a good time generally, the team
proceeded to Hamilton, where, for the first time, we met the Western District team
on level terms. The Hamiltonians, having a strong batting side, had good hopes of
“ downing ” us, especially when we put up the modest total of 108, of which
Laver contributed 40. Hamilton’s score amounted to 33, Laver securing the
whole ten wickets at a cost of 15 runs. Our second effort brought forth 74,
Carter playing a fine innings of 25. Laver again played havoc with the elect of
Hamilton, taking eight for 18 in the second innings, his figures for the match
being 124 balls, 33 runs, 18 wickets; average, 1.83 per wicket.
SEASON 1893-4
1 893-94. —A gratifying improvement in the Club’s position in pennant cricket
took place in this season, the team winding up with an excellent record,
and securing second place, only losing the premiership in the final match against
North Melbourne, owing mainly to the splendid batting of H. Stuckey, who was
plavmg for North, and scored 141 before he was stumped by Harry off Letcher,
thus proving on this occasion as great a thorn in our sides as a couple of seasons
later, and for many subsequent ones he was in our opponents, for it was not until
the season of 1895-6 that he finally threw in his lot with us, only to have his con-
nection with the Club compulsorily severed a year or two back by the exigencies
of the hybrid district cricket, which, in my opinion, has done much to destroy
the esprit de corps of the clubs, and incidentally the best side of the game.
A comparison of our averages this season with those of the winners will
show that however meritorious were the performances of the latter, there was

little to choose between the two, and that our Club had every reason to be proud
of its representatives. The following is the record of the two teams: —
The above figures speak for themselves in gauging the merits of the two
teams; and had the result been decided on the basis of combined batting and
bowling averages, instead of by matches, the position would have been reversed.
Coming to individual performances, Laver again held pride of place in bat-
ting, and emulated his notable performances of the previous season, by compiling
the magnificent score of 258 against South Melbourne, when we totted up the
splendid total of 573. Laver’s was the last wicket to fall, and it was hard luck not
to carry his bat. He was ably assisted by the majority of the team, P. Lewis being
the most prominent, and just missing the century. Under any circumstances this
was a performance to be greatly proud of; but when we consider the calibre of
the opposing team, which had in its ranks H. Trott, Ingleton, Over, Kemp and
Giller, it is one which will be rarely, if ever, surpassed in the annals of the Club.
McMichael was in consistent good form throughout, and was next to Laver in
point of averages. Harry proved a tower of strength to the side, and in the
return match against .South Melbourne scored a brilliant 109 not out —the only
centurion, besides Laver. Carter’s performances, likewise, especially at the latter
half of the season, were consistently excellent; in fact, as the averages show, the
whole team was in great heart and form. This was A. E. Trott’s first season with
the Club, and both with bat and ball he gave promise of that excellence which, in
the following year, came to fruition, and gained him world-wide renown. The
bulk of the bowling was done by him and Letcher, who was at the head of the
pennant bowling averages with 32 wickets, at a cost of 13.09 per wicket. In all
matches, A. E. Trott bowled no less than 3026 balls for 108 wickets, averaging
11.09 P er wicket. The veteran, Boyle, again proved that his skill had not deserted
him, taking, in the match against M.C.C., thirteen wickets for 98 runs. The
name of H. F. Boyle is then missed from the ranks, he having left for Queens-
land, carrying with him the good wishes of all.
SEASON 1894-5
We made an excellent start in October, 1894, our first premiership match,
■against University, being won in a style which presaged a very successful outcome
of the season. The representatives of Alma Mater were dismissed for 106,
Costello (six for 72) and Trott (4 for 50) doing the damage. We responded
with the handsome total of 445. Of this number, Vautin contributed just 100 by
a beautiful display, which Lewis and McAlister augmented by 90 and 75 respec-
tively. The former had the misfortune to be caught by Laver, fielding as sub.,
a fate which also befell Trott, who expressed his determination never to hit a
ball heavenward within cover of Laver’s “ landing nets,” wherever the latter
might happen to be fielding as sub. McAlister gave a beautiful exhibition for
his 75, and gratified his clubmates by his recovery of form, which in the previous
season had been so disappointing that he was “ given a chance ” in the Second
Eleven; but by a magnificent 135 against Melbourne’s Second, reasserted his


claims for First Eleven honours, and he has never looked back since. University
could only make 64 in their second attempt, so we won our first match of the
season by an innings and 275 runs. We followed this up by beating Fitzroy, also
by an innings, our total of 303 including a fine, but not faultless, innings of
105 by Laver, and 61 (not out) by McMichael, whose cricket was clean and
stylish.
The team did not stop at this, but continued its phenomenal rate of scoring,
putting up, in successive matches, eight for 524 against M.C.C., and seven for
537 against Fort Melbourne, a total of 1061 for 15 wickets —something to be
remembered.
The solitary reverse we experienced in the matches for the premiership was
at the hands of M.C.C. The match was remarkable, in that M.C.C. closed their
innings when five wickets were down for 52, in order that we might have the
full benefit of the soft wicket. This action gave rise to some soreness at one
period, and the result was disastrous to us; they having won the toss sent us in
to bat. Our total of 91 was a fair performance, and with five of the best of
M.C.C. gone, the game was even; but, having to go in again on the bad wicket,
we lost five for 36 at the close of the day, and but for the splendid batting of
Lewis, the record would have been worse. Our innings was a one-man one. Lewis
resuming with 18 (not out) on the following Saturday, scored 102, run out, out
of a total of 147, Costello being the only other batsman to render assistance, with
18 (not out). The brilliant batting of W. Truce and H. Graham enabled M.C.C.
to win by eight wickets, but the match was a most unsatisfactory test of the
capacity of the two teams.
The outcome of the season was disappointing, notwithstanding the brilliant
performances recorded by the team, for we were again merely runners-up for
the premiership. The fates appeared to be against us, the solitary defeat which
turned the scale against us being mainly attributable to the conditions under which
the match was played; success in the circumstances being practically hopeless.
SEASON 1895-6
The visit of Stoddart’s Team created intense interest, and the splendid series
of test matches were a source of great pleasure to all lovers of the game, but,
naturally, adversely affected club cricket. In individual performances for the
Club, Lewis shone out by his consistency, and his effort of 102, against M.C.C.,
in the match previously alluded to, when a stand was badly wanted, is deserving
of special notice. McAlister was another whose services throughout were of the
very highest order, having innings of 152 (not out) and 124 to his credit, among
other good performances. Vautin also treated us to some grand displays of
batting, scoring no less than four centuries —195, 105, 101, 100 —and his hitting
innings at Warrnambool and Hamilton were something to be remembered; but
“ the star of the bunch ” was undoubtedly Tfott, whose rapid advance to the top
of the tree, in club, intercolonial, and international cricket, in both departments
of the game, formed the feature of the season, not only in local, but also in
Australasian cricket. For the Club, in bowling, he performed the remarkable
feat of taking 147 wickets at a cost of 8.52, thus beating his record of the pre-
vious season, and in each of two successive seasons taking over 100 wickets, the
only bowler who has ever done so for the Club. In addition, he was at the head
of the averages for all matches, with 56.52, and in pennant second only to Lewis
(57.5), his average being 53.87 for nine innings.

One of the periodical reconstructions of the governing body of Victorian
cricket took place at this time, and a new “ Cricket League ” was formed, with
Melbourne, Carlton, East Melbourne, Fitzroy, North Melbourne, Richmond, St.
Kilda, South Melbourne, “ Associated Clubs,” playing for the premiership; and
Brighton, Coburg, Essendon, Hawthorn, Hawksburn, Port Melbourne, and Wil-
liamstown, "Affiliated Clubs," relegated to a minor flag of their own.
Some changes likewise took place in the personnel of our team, the Club
losing the services of Letcher, who, succumbing to the blandishments, it is said,
of the genial George Robertson, cast in his lot with Carlton. On the other hand,
we had a welcome accession of strength in Harry Stuckey, Chrystal, and John
Hewlett. The batting strength of the team quickly asserted itself, as the record
of the first five innings shows, the successive scores being 457, 422, 473, 476, and
876, respectively. In compiling the last-named total, we were congratulating
ourselves upon having established a record, but, by a remarkable coincidence,
upon the very same afternoon Carlton went one better, with a score of 922. The
evenness of the batting is confirmed by the averages, no less than six of the team
averaging over 40, and four over 50, in pennant cricket, while no fewer than 23
centuries were scored in all matches, Vautin again heading the list, with 254,
132 (not out), and 112; run closely by Laver, with 248, 147, and 101; Lewis, 109,
131, and 154; McAlister, 184 and 106 (not out) ; Stuckey, 170 and 102 (not out) ;
and Carter, Howlett, Healy, P. Waxman, and Harry, one each, the last-named
also scoring 107 in the intercolonial. In contrast to the remarkable figures re-
corded by the team, the highest score against us was 238, by Fitzroy. One would
have thought that performances such as these would have ensured the fluttering
of the premiership pennant at the head of the Club’s flagpole; but fortune was
again unkind, and notwithstanding the brilliancy of the season, we only achieved
third place. We met our first set-back at the hands of M.C.C., in February, when
we lost by 37 runs on the first innings, with two wickets down for 114 in the
second. A forcing game against time became necessary to have any chance of
victory, and the result was a loss by three wickets. We were also unfortunate
in being without Harry, owing to an injury. Our cup of misfortune was filled
when we lost our second pennant match in the last game, against Carlton, by 32
runs, failing to get the 178 runs required on a bad wicket, and being without
Harry, who was on the sick list, and Trott, who had left for England. The actual
winners were North Melbourne, whom we did not meet at all. The three leading
clubs compared as follows:
As I have said, the batting was of exceptional excellence, and where per-
formances all round were so evenly good, it is almost invidious to specialise, but
the uniformity of McAlister’s batting cannot be overlooked. He topped the
averages with the splendid record of 67.42. In all-round play, the captain’s
(Laver) services were invaluable: he bowled 2747 balls in all matches for 84
wickets, average 11.71; his average in pennant matches being 15.77.


SEASON 1896-7
1896-7. —We had some " bad quarters of an hour ” in our first premiership
match of the 1896-7 season, which was against Hawksburn, promoted from the
“ Affiliateds.” Winning the toss, Laver, with some misgivings, put Hawksburn
in on a bad wicket, which, however, went from bad to worse as the game pro-
gressed. Laver's good length was the main factor in disposing of Hawksburn for
87; seven of their wickets going to him at a cost of 35. At call of time affairs
did not look too promising, with six of our wickets down for 64, Laver being
responsible for 38, and A. S. Carter 14 (not out), invaluable performances under
the circumstances. Two of the remaining wickets being “ only bowlers,” we re-
sumed the following Saturday with some anxiety as to the result, as the match
was certain to be decided on the first innings. Carter (46) and Chrystal (15),
however, quickly dispelled all fears. Carter’s 46 was the innings of real value to
our side, especially the runs made on the first day. E. Howes (24) and J. Lynes
—only a bowler —(44, not out) materially added to our total, which rose to 190,
Hawksburn making 144 in their second try, owing to Carter, who was “ only a
batsman,” following up his innings of 46 by taking seven wickets for 50. We
won our first match of the season by 103 on first innings. Great interest in the
following fixture, against North Melbourne, was taken, owing to our opponents
being the holders of the pennant, and this was intensified by the fact that the two
redoubtable elevens had not, owing to a badly arranged programme, met in the
previous season. We were fortunate in having the services of both Harry and
A. E. Trott, who had returned from the old country. These two, and H. Stuckey,
were chiefly instrumental in scoring a substantial victory by five wickets. Our
figures were 146 and 131 for five wickets; North, 108 and 167; Trott obtaining
seven wickets for 46, and Harry two for 22, in the first innings of North, and
scoring 37 and 28, and 35 and 18, respectively. Stuckey got 11 in the first innings,
and his 52 in the second practically won the match, and was all the more credit-
able, as the wicket on the last day was anything but what it ought to be; its
“ peculiarities ” giving rise to considerable dissatisfaction; in fact, our innings was
commenced “ under protest.”
This was one of those rare occasions upon which strong ill-feeling was
aroused, owing to an apparently well-founded suspicion of mala fides on the part
of someone connected with the interests of our opponents. The upshot was an
enquiry before the Association, and the North Melbourne Club was fined for “ not
having the wicket properly prepared,” some very severe comments appearing
in the sporting press.
Laver and J. Lynes were on- bowlers in the second innings of North Mel-
bourne, taking four wickets each, the latter's at a cost of 37 runs only.
Our third match was against our ancient rivals, M.C.C., and was signalised
bv the unaccountable failure of our batting in the first innings, J. Harry,
MeMichael. Stucker r and Carter being the only members of the team to reach
double figures in our very poor total of 106. M.C.C. responded with 361, of
which C. McLeod made 124, and G. L. Wilson 80, and Bruce 71. Our second
effort was in marked contrast to the first, the splendid score of 407 being put up,
H. Stuckey playing a magnificent innings for 143 (not out), with scarcely a false
stroke, and, considering the quality of the bowling, decidedly the best innings of
the season in pennant cricket. Laver made 69, Harry 41. MeMichael was
Stuckev’s chief supporter during his innings, keeping his end up, and scoring


a careful 39. The rest of the team all secured double figures, save Lynes and
Howes. Our effort, however, came too late. Melbourne, at the close of day,
had two wickets down for 88, and the game went to them on the first innings.
Our next match was with “ another Richmond in the field,” and that Rich-
mond was kept in the field for two days, to the tune of 625. The main factors
in this huge total were Sam. McMichael and Val. Thompson, " the colt of the
season.” The colt went in first, and four wickets had fallen for 117 when
McMichael joined him. Between these two a phenomenal partnership was set
up, until, at 432, McMichael was given out caught-at-the-wickets off Kelly, for a
splendid innings of 211, probably the finest of the many fine displays we have been
treated to by him. The two next wickets fell rapidly, and Richmond's hopes rose,
but another fruitful and merry partnership was set up between Thompson and
Vautin; in 43 minutes the latter laid on the wood in such style that he had 94 to
his credit, including 16 fours and several fives, two on to the pavilion reserve, and
one down towards the railway. Thompson carried his bat right through for the
grand score of 228, which included 27 fours, and the Richmond team, to a man,
joined in the hearty applause he received. It was a magnificent effort for a colt,
in his first try in a first eleven; all the more creditable in view of his being only
18 years old. The yellow and black, owing to the fine bowling of A, Trott (seven
for 39) and Harry (three for 62), only succeeded in placing 157 on the board in
the first innings, and in the second had three down for 83, the match resulting
in a victory for us by 468 runs on the first innings. Our team surpassed them-
selves in the field, Laver and Alf. Carter being especially noticeable at point and
mid-off, respectively, and we were all pleased to see Percy Lewis back in his old
post at the wickets, after a long spell, and doubly pleased at the great form he
displayed.
SEASON 1897-8
After years of hope deferred, the Club, in the season of 1897-8, at length
attained the object of its ambition —the premiership of the Victorian Cricketing
Association, which we had on so many occasions narrowly missed winning. So
often had the prize been snatched from our grasp, when apparently we were
certain of success, that it almost seemed as though the fates had determined that
the premiership flag should not again float above the pavilion. This season, how-
ever, our efforts were crowned with success, and we saw the initiation of that
remarkable series of successes which form, perhaps, the brightest page in the
records of the Club. Not alone in pennant cricket did the Club shine during
this season, but in matches of all classes. The First Eleven Pennant team passed
through the season undefeated; the Second Pennant Eleven just missed winning
the premiership, being defeated only in the final game, against M.C.C.; the non-
pennant Eleven was undefeated, and the First Eleven, in all matches,
were only twice defeated, making, in all, a complete record of 51 matches
played, 27 won, 21 drawn, and only 3 lost. It is not surprising, in view of these
results, that the greatest enthusiasm was displayed by members, and that, to
quote from the annual report: “The smokemight given by your President, Mr.
A. E. Clarke, to the Club’s playing members, in commemoration of the winning
of the premiership, was the greatest success of its kind ever held in connection
with the history of the Club. The gathering was thoroughly representative of
cricket, and the rafters fairly rang with applause and merriment.”

tests for premiership honours, no less than six secured averages of over 50, viz.,
Messrs. Stuckey (163), McAlister (59), Hewlett (59), Laver (55), Harry (53),
and McMichael (53) —sufficient indication of the very great batting strength of
the team. Stuckey’s performance was wonderful, in scoring in three successive
innings, 298, 192, and 165. That bowlers and fieldsmen alike did their share,
the following summary of the performances of our team, and those of the
runners-up, conclusively show, and the figures likewise emphasise the undeniable
superiority of the E.M. team over any ether competitor for the “ blue riband ”
of V ictorian cricket throughout the season.
Laver and Carter ably backed up our batsmen, the former taking 23 wickets
off 770 balls, at an average cost of 15.53 rmls P er wicket, and the
latter ig wickets off 660 balls, for 17.89 per wicket. Carter also proved
himself an excellent all-round cricketer, by being next to McMichael in the
batting averages, with 29.83.
North Melbourne were defeated by 78 runs, and Richmond by an innings
and 203. Then came the match against Carlton.
Stuckey and McAlister were the heroes of this game, in which we made one
of those high scores, for which this team, practically the same, individually, was
destined to become famous during this and the following seasons ; Stuckey, who
batted for about 6)4 hours, had the misfortune to lose his wicket from a bad
and low hit, when within two of his third century. During this fine innings,
Stuckey gave but one possible chance, when he was 173, and well earned the pro-
longed applause which greeted his return to the pavilion. McAlister swelled the
total with 147, made in about 3/2 hours’ play, but not with his faultless precision.
Stuckey and he put on no less than 248 runs for the fourth wicket. McMichael,
whose clean, crisp hitting was much admired, helped Stuckey to put on 218 for
second wicket, and seemed to be going strong for his hundred, when he was
taken in the slips. The first wicket had fallen for ng, Harry having been the
one to retire, with a well-got 63 to his credit. As showing the remarkably even
rate of scoring. I may mention that the first hundred took one hour, the second
two hours, and the third three hours, and the fourth four hours to compile.
Carlton put up a good up-hill fight against us, but their more than creditable
471 was insufficient by 184 runs.
Fitzroy were the next to get a taste of our quality. Our tally of 478 would,
as a general rule, give rise to much jubilation, but in this team of “ many cen-
turies ”it appeared to be but the natural order of things. Stuckey and McMichael
were again to the fore, the former following up his magnificent display against
Carlton by a great score of 165, and McMichael's 62 was the outcome of beautiful
cricket, stamping him as one of the best batsmen of the time in Victoria; but
when Laver joined Stuckey the runs were piled on at a great rate, the partnership
producing 145. Laver showed his return to form in a grand innings of 145 (not
out), full of vigour throughout, without a shadow of a show to the field. Fitzroy
scored 168 in their first innings, Laver taking six of their wickets for 83, and
Carter two for 18: and in their second innings, 176, Laver again getting four
wickets for 49. This made our fourth win in the pennant games.


In the South Melbourne match, which followed, the team maintained its con-
sistently high rate of scoring, putting up the even “ half thousand,” in which
the whole team took a hand, headed by the invincible Stuckey, whose 192 was
the only century the match produced, and an innings without a single chance,
which will .take rank with any of his many fine efforts. The whole of the re-
mainder of the team, save the not out man, got into double figures, Hewlett being
at the top with a merry 64. The Southerners were all disposed of in 2)4 hours
for a total of 177. Laver, who has seldom, if ever, performed better cricket on
a first-class wicket, maintaining a capital length, and bowling with judgment,
came out with six wickets for 61, off 116 balls. Our win by 323 runs was all
the more gratifying, as our old rivals, with Harry Trott at their head, were very
confident of their ability to check our hitherto unbroken run of victory.
The bon-bouche of the season was reserved for the end, when a keen tussle
between us and our great old opponents, M.C.C., resulted in a close and exciting
finish in our favour by 36 runs on the first innings. In this game, when Laver,
Stuckey and Aal. Thompson had fallen for eight runs, it looked as though we
were about to undergo another experience of having the cup dashed from our
lips, but the two ” Macs ” came to the rescue, and relieved the situation. They
brought the score to 87 for four wickets, McMichael playing a nice, forcible
innings for 47, when McAlister and Carter put on 106 for the fifth wicket. The
former made 83. and the latter 64. Nine wickets were down for 220 odd, when
an invaluable stand by Wright and Hewlett added 40, bringing our total to 268.
Wright made 25, and Hewlett 28 (not out). Melbourne made 232, and their
innings exemplified how even the best fielding team will sometimes miss catches,
Carter being the chief sufferer, winding up the season bv having no less than seven
chances missed off him, almost, I should think, a record in bad luck. His
wickets (3) cost 88, Laver's three 61, Paterson took two for 20, and Hewlett
one for 32. We went in a second time, and at call of time had lost two wickets
for 107, McMichael playing another fine game for 61 (net out).
SEASON 1898-9
Having once broken the ice of pennant success, this great team proceeded in
the following season, of 1898-9, to show that their remarkable record was no
fluke or flash in the pan, by going one better, and averaging 41 runs for, and
having only 17 runs per wicket scored against them. Six batsmen again averaged
over 50 runs each—Laver (95), McMichael (82), Carter (56), Stuckey (56),
\ ; Thompson (53), and McAlister (50). They repeated their pennant victory,
winning seven matches, and losing two. The wins consisted of Fitzroy, by
401; St. Kilda match abandoned, after we had scored 460 for two wickets;
Hawksbnrn, by 595! University, by 370; South Melbourne, by 212; M.C.C., by
272; and Carlton, by 226. Against these truly magnificent results we had to set
two reverses, namely, against North Melbourne, who defeated us by 273, and
the Richmond match, lost by eight runs on the first innings. These two games
are notable from the failure of our batsmen to play up to their true form. In
the last match, against Richmond, they redeemed their reputation in the second
innings, by scoring 294 for four wickets, but too late to affect the result, which
was decided by the first innings.
So far as individual performances are concerned, Laver broke all previous
records of the Club, by winning both batting and bowling averages in pennants.


as well as in all, matches. Carter, who was in splendid form through most of
the season, also established a club record to that date, by aggregating 1412 runs
for the season, among which he counted five centuries.
The first pennant game of the season was against Fitzroy. It was said at
the time that this should be called “ Laver's match," for, in addition to scoring
171, he secured six wickets for 36. Though this, as it was termed, “prodigious
performance ” stands out, the captain was splendidly supported by McAlister
(63), Carter (53), McMichael (55), Hewlett and others, in a total of 469; Fitz-
roy, batting eight men, totalled 68; two batsmen and sundries accounting for 57
of these!
Having given the representatives of the northern suburb a taste of their
quality, the eleven next preceded to enjoy themselves at the expense of St. Kilda.
McMichael and Stuckey opened the ball; Stuckey compiled 30; McAlister fol-
lowed with a beautifully got 48, the second wicket falling at 165; Laver then
joined McMichael, and the pair remained in possession until St. Kilda abandoned
the game—when the scoring-board showed 460 for two wickets, with McMichael
246 (not out) and Laver 126 (not out), the pair, in the last portion of their
partnership, putting on 120 runs in an hour, and 147 in 100 minutes.
After these two dazzling performances, one of those reversals of form, so
puzzling to the pavilion cricketer, took place in the match against North Mel-
bourne. The Northerners put up 440, against which we could only show 167,
with two men away. McAlister played another fine not out innings of 50;
Laver (37), Barry (20), Stuckey (18), and Carter (13), were the only ones to
give the scorers any work to do.
After this disappointing display, our cracks were keen to rehabilitate them-
selves, and the sufferers by the reaction were the Hawksburn bowlers, nine of
whom were tried before we were disposed of for 689. Only two of our team
failed to get double figures. Stuckey and Laver were in evidence again, Stuckey
recording another great innings of 175, and Laver 114; next to them came
Carter, 91 ; McAlister, close up, with 83; and Christian, 69. Hawksburn re-
sponded with 94. Laver was very destructive, and got seven wickets for 31.
The start of the game against University presaged a small score. The
wicket was tricky, and three wickets were down for 32, but a great stand was
made by Stuckey and Carter. Stuckey scored 88 in capital style; but Carter gave
no rest to the field, save when he hit the ball clean out of the ground, which he
did five times during his innings of 165. He gave a splendid exhibition of well-
timed and powerful batting, in this, his fifth century of the season. The respect-
able total of 350 proved too much for the Students, who, however, saved the
follow-on, scoring 159, their wickets being well distributed among our trundlers.
Our second innings produced a modest 223, Carter agains shewing batting form
by getting top score of 76, while Laver put up 63. University's second innings
was signalled by another great bowling performance by Laver, whose six wickets
cost only 12 runs, and the whole side was dismissed for 44.
If our financial position had depended upon the performances of Laver,
McMichael, McAlister, Carter and Stuckey, we would have been relieved of the
anxiety it was giving us at this time; but, unfortunately, success in the field and
a flourishing money-chest do not always go together. The standard set up by
these players was so high that each club opposed to them met with disaster.
Against South Melbourne they accounted for 314 out of a total of 401. No
centuries adorned the scoring-sheet, McMichael just missing the coveted honour


by 3, his 97 being obtained in his best form; Carter played another brilliant
innings of 74; Laver, 59; Stuckey (run out) 54; and McAlister, 39, Christian
added his quota of 30; and V. Thompson, who was singularly unfortunate this
season in pennant matches, was 17 (not out). South Melbourne’s innings of
189 was passed with two wickets down; Carter, four for 28; Laver, three for
57: and Barry, two for 34; and the captain’s brilliancy at point, were the main
factors in disposing of them.
SEASON 1899-1900
It was not to be expected that the very heavy scoring and high averages of
the two preceding seasons would be maintained, as the variability of the weather
caused the wickets to be anything but favourable to batsmen. We were also
handicapped by being minus the services of some of our best players in the
matches lost, in each instance, by narrow majorities; but some brilliant victories
were accomplished when defeat appeared almost inevitable. Laver, to whose un-
equalled value in the team these records eloquently speak, was unable to play
against North Melbourne or University, and was considerably handicapped in
the Hawksburn match by an injured thumb, these three matches being the only
ones lost, II e again headed the batting averages in pennant matches with 63;
McAlister (55), Stucke}' (.49), Horan (47), Godby (33 ), V. Thompson (32),
and Carter (30) also showed to advantage. Hewlett headed the bowling averages
by a fraction from Christian, with 12 runs per wicket, the latter, however, taking
19 wickets to the former's 13; Laver averaging 15. and Collins 16, for 17 wickets
each, were likewise useful. Collins was unlucky in meeting with an injury
which prevented him bowling much, just when he promised to be exceptionally
dangerous.
The fielding of the team was excellent, and the wicket-keeping of H. Wright
so brilliant, notwithstanding an injury early in the season, that a special prize
was awarded him. During Laver's absence, McMichael acted as captain, and
worthily filled the gap.
Godby won his spurs in the First Eleven by making 66 not out in the first
innings of the Carlton match; he and V. Thompson (56) and Carter (26) were
the chief contributors to our total of 242, to which Carlton responded with 156.
Our second attempt produced 328, mainly owing to a splendid innings by Carter
of 140. Laver, who had just returned with Darling's Australian Eleven, assisted
with 71, Hewlett 21 (not out) and McAlister, 21. Laver was the most successful
bowler, obtaining five for 50; Christian following with three for 36; the remain-
ing two being taken by Carter and Howlett.
In the following match, with South (Melbourne, four good wickets had
fallen for 45; and our success seemed problematical, when a fine stand by the
two colts, Godby and J. Horan, changed the complexion of the game. The former
made 60, and the latter 50, and both, singularly enough, were run out. Our
total was 240, and as Sutherland and McCormack, at the close of the second day’s
play, had put up 118 without the loss of a wicket, it again seemed as though our
old rivals had a “ sure thing;” but, owing to the excellent trundling of Laver and
Howlett, on resuming, the whole of the wickets fell with the total at 203, and
we thus won by 37 runs. Laver took five wickets for 78, and Howlett five for
5 6 -
Then followed another “ see-saw ” game against Fitzroy, who totalled 248.
Our chances looked anything but rosy when McAlister and McMichael fell for


6 and 14, respectively, this being the first time for three years that the former
failed to get double figures in a pennant match. An invaluable partnership
between Stuckey and Laver put on 129, and made the position safer. Stuckey
batted in his very best form for 70, made without giving a semblance of a chance
during it, hitting 11 fours. Laver and Horan finished the match, Laver’s m
being one of his best performances, and including fifteen 4’s. Horan batted
in a pleasing style for 35 (not out), and the result was a win by six wickets.
The match against St. Kilda produced another of those mammoth scores,
with which the seasiders have, on a number of occasions, been treated at our
hands. No less than three of our team topped the century. McAlister played
a great innings for 87; he and Horan took the score from one for 6 to two for
167; Horan’s tally was a well-got 113. Stuckey was at the top of the poll with
142 (not out), followed by V. Thompson, with 123. Stuckey gave no chance,
and compiled his runs in his most vigorous manner, while Thompson’s innings
was characterised by some beautiful cutting and wrist play; it included a splendid
five to leg, and 18 fours. Godby was also seen to much advantage in his contribu-
tion of 43. Our total was 620. With three of their men away, St. Kilda could
only put together 23, Christian securing six of their wickets for seven runs, and
we had a runaway win by 597 runs.
So much for our successes. Our failures were against University, North
Melbourne, and, most disastrous of all, the final match for the premiership,
played off between Hawksburn and ourselves. The last was 'played at the tail
end of the season. We had nothing to complain of in the luck, but our batsmen
unaccountably failed in a very small-scoring game. With only 113 to get, it
appeared a guinea to a gooseberry on us, but our strong batting team only suc-
ceeded in putting up 88, and we therefore lost by 25 runs. Hawksburn thus
won the premiership in their first season of Association cricket, and well
deserved their success.
SEASON 1900-1
The break in our run of success in the pennant competitions seemed to
nerve the team to greater effort, and the opening season of the twentieth century
proved an “ Annus mirabilis ” in the history of the Club. The records put up
by the team have never probably been surpassed, or even equalled, by any club
in the world.
The eleven went through the season without a single reverse, and averaged
47.92 runs per wicket lost, while the average against us per wicket was only 15.83.
The individual batting averages are something to dwell over. Starting at 103.66,
by J. Hewlett, they taper down gradually, the lowest being 21.25. With such
remarkable figures it is almost superfluous to particularise; but, without detract-
ing from Hewlett’s splendid record, the palm must unquestionably be given to
P. McAlister, who scored double the aggregate number of runs put up by any
batsman, save Stuckey, missed a three-figure average by merely a decimal, and
had the assistance of only one not-out innings. Six more runs would have given
him a century average.
The phenomenal batting of the team was rivalled by an equally phenomenal
bowling record by Laver, the captain, who captured 24 wickets for an average
°f 9-93 P er wicket, off i 486 balls. This, coupled with his fine average, 44.42, off
the bat, bears ample evidence of his invaluable services to his side during the
season.

These figures deserve some lasting record, and, therefore, at the risk of
wearying readers with dry statistics, I feel bound to give them in full.
Enthusiasm, determination, and esprit de corps will work wonders, and
their influence on the fortunes of a cricket team cannot be over-estimated. That
all these feelings animated our team goes without saying, and it is worth while
running over its tally since 1897-8, the turning point of our fortunes in pennant
cricket. In that season (undefeated) we scored an average of 41 against our
opponents’ 19; in 1898-9, 41 against 17; and in 1899-1900, 30 against 18.
In order to pleasantly celebrate these magnificent achievements in traditional
English fashion, the President and Vice-Presidents hospitably entertained the
players at a banquet, at which the members of the First Eleven took the oppor-
tunity of presenting their captain with a handsomely framed group of photo-
graphs of all the players who had taken part in these matches during this and
the previous three seasons. The feeling of good-fellowship was further exempli-
fied by pleasant inter-communal matches played, one between sides chosen by
the veterans, T. Horan and J. Healy, and the other between sides chosen by the
two of the champions of the period, Laver and McMichael.
The ball opened in October, at Jolimont, our opponents being Carlton. The
games this season were played on the “ half-time ” racket, and at the close of
the first day’s play Carlton had seven wickets down for 135, and the two Macs,
McAlister and McMichael, were in possession, the tally being 127 for no wickets.


On the second day, Carlton increased their total to 179. Our first wicket fell for
140, McAlister falling to Griffiths for 87, made in characteristically artistic style.
McMichael and Horan then added 105 before the latter was c. and b. by
Saunders for a steady 31. McMichael was dismissed a few runs later for the
splendid contribution of 126, the first century of the season, made in 3 hours
and 37 minutes, in the manly and graceful style so well known to us. Stuckey
and A. E. Clarke were not out, respectively, with 7 and 25, and with the total
at 284 we were declared the winners by six wickets and 105 runs, thus com-
mencing the remarkable series of victories mentioned before.
University were next to try conclusions, and the representatives of Alma
Mater were treated to some severe leather-hunting, a total of 568 being put up
by us, three centuries being recorded, by Laver, McAlister, and J. Horan.
Stuckey was run out for 48, A. E. Clarke (30), Wright (29), and Godby (32,
not out), also contributing to the score. McAlister was top scorer with 127,
obtained in a shade over three hours, in his customary taking style. Horan
followed closely with 125, and was going strong when he chopped a ball on to his
wicket, while Laver, not to be outdone, put up 103 in an hour and 50 minutes.
University’s total was 179, Laver obtaining six wickets for 88, off 198 balls. A
second innings was commenced, University scoring 46 for two wickets, both
obtained by Hewlett, and we had one down for 76 Godby (15), Collins (not out,
35), and Wright (not out, 23), being the batsmen, but the match was decided by
the first innings, East winning by 451 runs.
The following match against Melbourne was the most interesting and exciting
experienced for many years, not alone by its importance in connection with the
premiership, but also by the keenness of the rivalry between the two clubs, and
the evenness of the competing teams. M.C.C.. keenly alive to the crucial nature
of the struggle, and anxious to retrieve their lost laurels of previous years, put
their best team in the field. At the end of the first day’s play, the score sheet
showed East three wickets for 133, M.C.C. three wickets for m, and anybody’s
game. The second day made our position less hopeful, for the tally showed
E.M. six for 222, M.C.C. four for 236, and on paper the lookout was even worse
than the figures indicate, for McAlister (114, not out) had, in addition to Hew-
lett (10, not out), only the bowlers of the team, and the wicket-keeper, to rely
on for assistance, while M.C.C. had Trumble, C. McLeod, Sutherland, Ross and
Russell, a formidable five, and two useful men in Cave and Aitken in reserve.
Once more, however, the unreliability of paper conclusions was realised, for on
resuming, instead of the remaining Jolimonters falling an easy prey, McAlister
was again in good form, and, ably assisted by Hewlett, who played a sound, strong
game, 98 was added for the loss of only one wicket. When McAlister was
caught at the wicket for 163, obtained in masterly style, the board showed
7' 1 63-3i2. Hewlett’s sterling contribution of 42 (not out) was invaluable, and,
made at the most critical stage of the game, when resolution and nerve were
required, is deserving of all commendation. At the call of “ half-time ” our score
was 320 for seven wickets. The Melbourne pair, Trumble and McLeod, resumed
with 236 on the board for four wickets, and 40 runs were added before the latter
fell a victim to Laver. Trumble fell shortly after; he had batted finely for in.
including sixteen 4’s and a 6. After the departure of Trumble came a lightning
change, and some uncommon incidents. Laver had come in to silly-mid-ofif for
Sutherland, and a hot drive went straight to him. Too hot to hold, it cannoned
off his hands and was caught by Hewlett. Eight wickets were down for 285.


Ross and Aitken made a game effort to save the match, and put on 34 runs
before the latter was disposed of. Cave, the last man, was run out by a clever
piece of play. Laver was fielding his bowling keenly, to save the short runs,
6 only being required to make a draw; Ross played a ball to forward cover, and
Laver, darting for the ball, secured it before Collins could reach it, and threw
the wicket down, and Cave was run out; it was a great piece of work, and a
fitting conclusion to a great, exciting, and inspiriting game.
North Melbourne were the next to lower their colours to the apparently
invincible eleven. At the beginning of the season the team was called a good
batting side, but weak in bowling, being classed very much as Noble’s Eleven
was at the beginning of the last English tour, and similarly, as the season pro-
gressed, it was made evident that though possessing no ‘‘ demons,” the quality
of our trundlers was much under-rated, as our opponents’ learned to their cost.
In this match, North were dismissed for 173, the wickets being well distributed;
Collins, three for 47; Laver, three for 54; Christian, two for 24; and Carter,
two for 24. Our total was 429, and, strange to say, and evidencing the even
quality of our batting in this large score, not one century appears on the sheet.
Laver, the top-notcher, just missed the coveted three figures by two. Carter,
the dashing left-hander, signalised his return to town and the team by compiling
65 in free style, including some capital leg hits. was close up to him
with 64, and the consistent McAlister followed with 61. All the rest, save
McMichael, got into double figures, and the last pair, Collins (34) and Hewlett
(28, not out), put up 61 between them in 35 minutes. The substantial majority
of 256 was therefore the outcome of our fourth contest.
The fifth round saw us pitted against our old rivals of the Hill, led by
the redoubtable Harry Trott. The opening was not promising for us, two of
our most reliable men, Laver and McAlister, being dismissed for 7: but Stuckey
and Carter got together, and made things uncomfortably warm for the
Southerners, scoring 134 and 120, respectively. I doubt if the latter ever batted
better; he hit four s’s and thirteen 4’s. Stuckey also played a capital innings,
but had some luck. The troubles of South were not at an end, however, with
these two, for Hewlett played a splendid not-out innings for 166, throughout
which admirable display he gave only one chance, a difficult one, at 53 ; his runs
were all made in 3 hours and 28 minutes. Hewlett was ably assisted by Officer
and McMichael. Officer batted beautifully for 81, made in 67 minutes, including
thirteen 4’s. McMichael, who was in low down, owing to indisposition, assisted
to increase the score by 81 for the last wicket, his contribution being 41. South
Melbourne’s first effort produced only 114. Laver, again, was the destroying
angel, and secured eight wickets for 44 runs off 150 balls. In their second try
they had three down for 41, Collins obtaining two for 17 and McAlister one for
13 and 2 wides. Our second innings produced 114 for three wickets, Officer
again playing an attractive and vigorous game for 57 (not out), made in 45
minutes. Horan also shaped well for 33 (not out). Our score of 653 in the
first innings was put together in 6 hours and 10 minutes, constituted the record
for the season in pennant cricket, and left us with the handsome balance to the
good of 539 runs on the first innings. We thus defeated both our ancient and
respected antagonists decisively, and scored a decided lien on the premiership.
The sturdy Richmondites next essayed to break our long run of victory,
and though failing in their batting, put up a good fight, for after McMichael and
Stuckey had scored 60 and 67, respectively, six of the hitherto invindbles fell for


20 runs, when Christian came to the rescue, and with McAlister totted up 64 runs
for 10th wicket, in 32 minutes, bringing our total to 274, as against Richmond’s 114,
McAlister making 65, and Christian 42 (not out). Laver took six wickets for
34, and his figures shown at one period of the game are worth quoting—4B balls,
2 runs, 6 maidens, 4 wickets. Collins obtained three for 49. Richmond’s total
was 114. We lost four wickets for 109 in our second innings. McMichael, who
played a brisk and attractive innings for 35, Laver (27), and McAlister (20, not
out) were the chief scorers. In the same time our opponents scored 40, Laver
and Collins having the batsmen in a knot, their averages being—Laver, 120 balls,
13 runs, 14 maidens, 3 wickets; Collins, 120 balls, 15 runs, 13 maidens, 3 wickets.
There now remained but one task to crown our achievements. Hawksburn,
the premiers of the previous season, against whom it will be remembered our
batsmen failed in an astonishing manner in the last match, had to be met, and
that defeat wiped out. That the team made ample amends for their shortcom-
ings of the previous season, the following record will show. Going in first, the
board showed I—l1 —17 —34, McMichael being bowled by Osborne. Carter joined
McAlister, and between them 114 were added to the score, the former playing
a rattling innings of 65, scoring fiver’s in one over off successive balls. McAlister
wound up his season with a magnificent 158, in which it is sufficient to say that
he was seen at his best; his cutting was a treat to witness, his driving full of
power, and his leg-glances models of style and skill, no chance marring his fine
performance. This being his third century in pennant matches this season, general
regret was expressed that he should not have scored another six runs, to enable
him to secure a three-figure average, to which he was well entitled, for his con-
sistent performers. The other contributors to our score were: Laver (52),
Hewlett (58) and Stuckey (31), stalwarts all. Christian being absent, our
total was 432 for the nine wickets, Collins being not out (11). The Hawksburn
bowlers thus joined the ranks of those who, throughout the season, had tried
with so little success to stem the tide of scoring—a remarkable contrast to our
poor showing of the previous season, with practically the same team. Our
bowlers again asserted themselves, Laver being to the fore with seven wickets for
44; Collins, two for 58; and Hewlett, one for 26.
We played seven matches, defeating in turn: —
Carlton, by 6 wickets and 105 runs
University, by 451 runs
M.C.C., by 3 wickets and 6 runs
North Melbourne, by 256 runs
South Melbourne, by 539 runs
Richmond, by 160 runs
Hawksburn, by 287 runs
SEASON 1901-2
The presence of an English team in 1901-2 had the usual effect of detracting
from the interest in club cricket, and pennant matches for the greater part of the
season lost their hold on the followers of the game. With a plethora of first-
class cricket provided by international and interstate contests, club games in-
evitably retire into the background, the public becomes surfeited with the very
best, and, with the exception of a few enthusiasts, they pay little attention to
the struggles for supremacy among the clubs which in normal seasons satisfy


their appetites. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, upon the departure of
McLaren’s team, there was a gratifying brightening up in interest, and consider-
able enthusiasm among followers of the two clubs was displayed during the pro-
gress of what proved to be the final match of the season, E.M. v. Carlton, which
resulted in a draw. The conclusion was unsatisfactory, as, the teams having
tied, the latter club declined to play off in compliance with the decision of the
Pennant Committee, the ostensible reason being that they could not get a repre-
sentative team together. The action of the Carlton Club was generally condemned,
as the public was eagerly looking forward to a final tussle between the two evenly
matched teams, which would have greatly revived interest in local cricket, and
have provided a treat for genuine lovers of the game.
Of the nine pennant matches played, we won 6, 2 were drawn, and I lost.
Our single reverse was against M.C.C., in the first match of the season, before
our men had time to strike form, and with Hugh Trumble at his best, ably
assisted by C. McLeod and Cave, our batsmen required to be at their top to
enable them to score a success; as it was, we put up the poor total of 120, M.C.C.
having closed with seven for 213, and losing three for 50 in their second innings,
won on the first innings. McMichael was our top-scorer with 39, Wright follow-
ing with 32, McAlister 10, and Laver 10. This was an unpromising commence-
ment, and our first defeat since 1899. For the remainder of the season, however,
our batsmen asserted themselves, and though not equalling the unprecedented
records of the previous year, their performances were still of a very high standard.
After a draw with Richmond, much in our favour, North Melbourne, University,
St. Kilda, Hawksburn, Fitzroy and South Melbourne were in turn defeated with
substantial margins. Against Richmond, we declared with two down for 269,
S. McMichael playing a splendid not-out innings for 120, which he commenced
with a grand hit over the boundary, into Punt Road, for five, and at a subse-
quent stage hit another fiver to long-on; Laver put together 63 by capital cricket
before he was bowled by Desmasures. McAlister batted in his wonted artistic
style for 33, and H. Stuckey obtained an unusually careful 38 (not out). An
exciting conclusion was provided, as R. Pirrie and W. Kelly, stone-walling
against time, succeeded in keeping their wickets up, and secured a draw, notwith-
standing the tempting hittable stuff which Laver put on to try and break down
their patience. Call of time saw Richmond with seven down for 184, to the
delight of the local supporters.
North Melbourne only succeeded in putting up 92, Laver taking four wickets
for 45, off 114 balls. Collins, who had 12 hit off him without a wicket, wound
up with three for 14 off 36 balls, and Christian secured the other three for 24, off
90 balls. McMichael and McAlister, our two batting stars, started our innings
with another of those invaluable partnerships, by which the Club has benefited
on so many occasions, and our first wicket fell for 189, the former wicket falling
with McMichael’s score at 89, McAlister following him to the pavilion shortly
after, with 104 to his credit. Stuckey was in fine form, his 62 being obtained
in a little under an hour and a half. Vollugi compiled 44 in taking style, and
Laver and J. Horan put on 122 for the last wicket, and were not out at the
finish; the former, who went in last, being 69, and the latter 49, obtained by
steady play. The total was 469 for nine wickets, and the margin of victory, one
wicket and 377 runs.
The St. Kilda match produced fairly even individual scoring in a smaller
total than we had become accustomed to, 273 being the aggregate, of which J.


Horan contributed 72 (not out) by sterling cricket. Stuckey was again to the
fore with 41, most of the others obtaining double figures of varying dimensions.
A peculiar incident occurred in this match, Wright being given out caught-at-
the-wickets. He touched the ball, which cannoned off the wicket-keeper’s gloves,
and actually stuck between the middle and off stumps, whence it was picked out by
the wicket-keeper, and the verdict went against Wright, on appeal. I never remem-
ber a similar case, and there was some difference of opinion among cricketers as
to the correctness of the decision. St. Kilda were disposed of for 84, mainly
owing to the excellent trundling of Collins, who secured six of their wickets for
41 runs. In the second innings we put up 97 runs for one wicket, J. Horan again
showing good form for 50 not out. St. Kilda responded with one wicket for
92. The match being decided by the first innings, we won by 189 runs.
Hawksburn were our next opponents, and their skipper, winning the toss,
sent us in the field. They were disposed of for 168, mainly owing to Collins,
who again was in excellent form, and took six wickets for 85, Christian securing
the remaining four for 71. Our total was 252, obtained without any sensational
individual effort. McAlister played a beautiful innings for 53, Laver coming next
with an equally meritorious 51, compiled in an hour. J. Horan, McMichael and
Seitz each contributed their quota; Nodrum was not out, with 17, and a com-
fortable win was the outcome.
A win by seven wickets and 146 runs against Fitzroy followed. In this
game, McAlister resumed business in the century line, his 120 not out being a
masterly innings, admirable throughout, during which he gave not a solitary
chance to the field. Laver maintained the even form which characterised his
play this season, his contribution being 70. Carter gave a sound and entertaining
exhibition for 55 (not out), the unbroken partnership between him and McAlister
yielding 114 runs. Collins continued the excellent form he had been showing
throughout the season with the ball, obtaining six wickets at a cost of 58 runs,
the other four falling to Laver for 28.
The South Melbourne match followed, and resulted in our sixth consecutive
win, the Southerners making a poor show against our bowling, their wickets being
distributed amongst Howlett (4), Christian (3), Laver (2), and Collins (1), for
the small total of 90. Our response was 387 for nine wickets, Collins being
absent. McAlister once again proved his reliability, giving a fine display for
139, which included no less than 23 fours, and one five. A remarkably enter-
taining and spirited innings by Christian put 66 opposite his name, compiled in
an hour, including two fine fivers and nine fours. Laver set up 36 in 40 minutes;
a sound and forcible innings by H. Stuckey for 61, in less than an hour and a
quarter, a brisk 25 by Wright, and double figures by Howlett and Vollugi, kept
up the rate of scoring; McMichael having retired hurt, with 10 to his credit, and
Collins being absent, the innings was closed with the total stated above. There
was a great contrast in the scoring of the two teams, South taking 2 hours and
40 minutes to put together their 90, East in the same time scoring 243.
The final match, for the premiership, took place on the Carlton ground,
everything conducing to an enjoyable and successful wind-up to the season. The
weather was delightful, and an attendance of some 2000 spectators was in marked
contrast to the beggarly array of empty benches with which pennant cricket had
been patronised earlier in the season. The spectators were well rewarded for
their attention, for the match provided delightful cricket on both sides. Our
opponents, having won the toss, started with Warne and the captain, and they

were still in possession at call of half-time, with no on the board. Our two
Macs, McMichael and McAlister, opened the ball for us; the former retired
with a beautiful 43 to his credit, and the total one for 64; and at call of time we
had two wickets down for 103. On resuming, Worrall completed a brilliant and
forcible innings for 158, Warne having made 65 in the same time, and the record
was one for 229. With two down for 103, Carter and McAlister continued our
innings; the former, having made 15, was caught in the slips, and Horan and
“ Peter ” kept their ends up until stumps were drawn. McAlister gave a final
touch to the splendid form shown by him throughout the season, compiling 101
(not out), making his third consecutive century in pennant matches, while Horan
played a steady and useful innings for 10 (not out). Our total being three down
for 185, left the game at a most interesting stage, and the decision of the
Carlton Club, previously referred to, was a great disappointment to the cricketing
public, which looked forward to a deciding fight between the two with keen
relish. The evenness of the chances of the two teams may be judged by their
respective averages for the season, which compared as follows:
SEASON 1902-3
It seemed as though the fates had determined that these two teams should
have another go, for in the following season, the draw pitted them against one
another on the opening day. There was some friendly difference of opinion
between the executives of the two Clubs as to where the match should be played;
the Pennant Committee decided in favour of the Carlton ground. Such changes
as were made in the personnel of the teams of the previous season were in the
direction of strengthening our opponents, as they had a notable acquisition in
Harry Graham, and an addition to their bowlers in De Ravin, from Bendigo;
while on our side, the only alteration was that Mirams, from Essendon, was
in the team, and we were without our crack wicket-keeper, Wright, not a scien-
tific change, as the loss of our regular wicket-keeper could not be counter-
balanced by strengthening other departments of the game. The match occupied
three Saturdays. On the first day we had three wickets for 107, and Carlton
four for 74, the wicket being affected by weather. The following day the wicket
was in capital order, yet, to the dismay of their supporters, the remainder of
Carlton’s batsmen only added 45 runs. Worrall and Warne did not repeat their
sensational stand of the last match; they, with Graham, had fallen to Laver on
the first day. Laver wound up with five wickets for 56, and Collins bowled
well, especially on the second day, when he secured four wickets for 23, his final
figures being four for 43. Stuckey, who had joined McAlister with the score
at three for 91, remained until the latter was bowled by De Ravin for 118, and
4 —ll8 —190 was telegraphed. It goes without saying that McAlister’s innings
delighted the cognoscenti; he was as sound and true on the leg side as in his off
play, where he treated us to those beautifully sweet and crisp cuts to the boundary
which made his batting so attractive. A big score seemed on the cards at this
stage, but after the departure of Stuckey, who put together 40 in 63 minutes, no
lengthened stand was made. J. A. Seitz, the colt of the team, shaped in promis-
ing style for 14, and good judges prophesied that if he stuck to the game he


would make his mark, a forecast which his subsequent career has amply justified.
Hewlett, with 23 (not out), was the only other batsman on our side who added
materially to the score, which amounted to 248 all told. Seven of the Carltonians
were disposed of for 116 in their second innings, Collins (three for 36), Christian
(two for 28) and Hewlett (one for n) taking the wickets. In our second
innings, the order of going was reversed, and the “ tail end ” went in first, and
put up in with five wickets down, Christian (25, not out) and Collins (22)
making things lively, while Seitz played another nice innings for 22. Carter was
cordially praised for filling the breach as wicket-keeper, and notwithstanding a
severe blow on the first day, which necessitated stitches in both lips, did credit-
able work. The only noticeable points in a low scoring game against St. Kilda,
which followed this victory, were the excellent bowling of Collins, and Horan’s
two capital innings for 84 (run out) and 39 (not out) in our score of 150, the
only other double figures being McMichael (18) and Collins (15). St. Kilda
made 126 in their first, and 93 in their second innings, Collins taking seven wickets
in each innings, fourteen in all, for 100 runs. We won by eight wickets, Christian
scoring 18, and McAlister and Horan being 16 (not out) and 39 (not out).
The University next had to lower their colours, and the match was produc-
tive of one of those mammoth scores for which the Club’s representatives had
become noted. Strange to say, in a total of 539 put up by our men, only one cen-
tury appears, that being credited to McMichael. He went in first, and was not
disposed of until 163 appeared opposite his name; 259 was' on the board then.
The first wicket fell for 75, McAlister’s, his share being 46. After Horan was
bowled by Rainey, another great partnership was set up between McMichael and
Stuckey, which yielded 155, and the board showed 3 —B4 —284. Stuckey’s
84 included eleven fours. He drove and cut with all his old force, and his
telling display was marred by no single flaw. Too much cannot be said of
McMichael’s grand display in this match, his driving, cutting, pulling and leg
strokes were up to his best form, and throughout his long innings he gave no
possible chance. Another productive firm was that of Laver and Godby, which
put 113 to the credit of the side, the captain’s contribution being 80 (not out),
and Godby’s 58, the outcome of attractive cricket. Hewlett contributed 30, and
Wright rattled up 20, to swell the total. Laver, Collins and Hewlett disposed of
the sons of Alma Mater for 139, Laver taking five for 48; Collins, three for
51; and Hewlett, one for 12; and a win by an even 400 runs was recorded.
The match against South Melbourne, the next on the programme, was com-
menced in December, and owing to the interruptions arising from the interstate
fixtures, was concluded in January. It resulted in a win for us by 105 runs on
the first innings. We set up a moderate total of 215, our principal contributors
being Laver, with 98, and Vollugi, who shaped like an artist, for 42. The pair
put on 80 during their joint stay at the wickets, Stuckey (27) and McMichael
being the other players to get into double figures. The Southerners only succeeded
in putting together no in their first innings, being unable to make any headway
against the bowling of Laver and Collins. In their second innings, they did no
better, five wickets falling for 40, McAlister coming out as a bowler, and signalis-
ing his only appearance by capturing two wickets at a cost of 10 runs. We lost
four for 73 in our second innings, which included a nice score of 34 by Seitz.
Then followed one of the most memorable performances ever put up by this
or any other team, in the match against Fitzroy, played on January 17th, and
February 7th and 14th, when the world’s record score of 744, for two wickets,
was put up. The full scores will be seen in the full-page illustration given.

The remarkable partnerships resulted as follows; —McAlister and Laver,
366 for first wicket; Laver and Stuckey, 247 for second wicket, which tell at
613; and Stuckey and Horan, in, for their uncompleted combination. It will
be seen by the score that we won by the enormous number of gg>B runs and
eight wickets.
Alas! that after this magnificent record we should meet our Waterloo in the
eery next match, but such are the beautiful uncertainties of the game. W e
suffered our defeat at the hands of North Melbourne. The match proved a most
exciting one. The wicket was anything but perfect, and we were greatly handi-
capped by the indisposition of Laver, who was only able to bat under great dis-
ability on the second day, and whose services were likewise lost to us at a most
critical stage of the game. McAlister contributed 56 to our total of 201; so effec-
tive was the bowling of our opponents on a wicket which seemed to suit them,
that while we had one wicket down for 108 on the first day, seven were down for
197 on the second, and our total was only 201. North Melbourne, amid great ex-
citement, and to the delight of its supporters, topped our score by 22; then the
game took another exciting phase, and our team again showed its grit in an uphill
fight, for our second innings, having produced 79 for four wickets, in an hour,
Laver and Christian bowled so well that, ably assisted by excellent fielding, five
of their men were disposed of for 21, and it appeared as though we would even
yet pull off the match, but George Stuckey came to the rescue of the Northerners,
and saved the situation with an invaluable 13, and the sixth wicket fell shortly
before the drawing of stumps, and North were declared winners on the first
innings by 22 runs, amidst warm applause from an enthusiastic gathering of some
1500 supporters.
There yet remained another match to complete the contests for the season.
This was against M.C.C., and, as usual in a game between these two representa-
tive elevens, was productive of an excellent display, but was, unfortunately, put
an end to by rain, an unsatisfactory draw, in our favour, so far as it went, being
the result. We had one wicket down (McMichael, 26) for 232, while M.C.C,
had lost four for 119. McAlister and Stuckey set up another of those partner-
ships which had been the bane of so many bowlers, and added 172 without a
separation, McAlister being 103 (not out) and Stuckey 92 (not out).
Although the premiership flag was snatched from our hands, there could be
no gainsaying the remarkable averages recorded by the team, and a comparison
of the pennant results leaves little doubt as to which club was entitled to the
honours of the season.
SEASON 1903-4
The season of 1903-1904 was notable for the visit of Warner’s team, and
for the disappearance of half-time cricket, which received its quietus at a meeting
of the Association in September, and vanished amongst the limbo of experiments
for the regeneration of the game. Its advocates and inventors argued that it
would make for more dashing cricket, and also have a tendency to equalise the
chances of the game, but, after a fair trial, by general consent, it was abolished


with but few mourners. With us the season proved a bright one, from a
financial as well as from a player's standpoint. Dealing with the latter here, I have
only space to refer to the performances in pennant matches. How well our players
again acquitted themselves may be judged from their record of matches played,
namely; 7 won, 1 lost, and 1 drawn; average per wicket, for us, 21.83, against,
11.38. Total runs, 1725; against, 1390. Wickets taken, 122; lost, 79; and we had
the honour of flying the pennant once more from our flagpole, and hanging the
McEacharn Shield in the pavilion. Twenty years previously we won the Chal-
lenge Cup two seasons running, but that was eclipsed by our record for the seven
years to 1904, that record being:—
1897- Premiers
1898- Premiers
1899- Runners up
1900- 1901 Premiers
1901- 1902 Premiers
1902- Runners up
1 9°3" 1 9°4 Premiers
The quality of the combination which accomplished these great results needs
no further attestation than the results themselves. Nine of the team for this
season were also members in 1897-1898, namely, McAlister, McMichael, Stuckey,
Laver, Collins, Christian, Hewlett, Wright, and Carter, and this being Laver’s
tenth year as captain, it must have been very gratifying to him that his team
should have signalised it by adding another to the remarkable series of successes
which had been achieved under his leadership.
The season was a bad one for run-getting, and the averages all round were
much reduced, yet McAlister once more proved his consistency by securing an
average of 62.57 per innings, with an aggregate of 438 runs. In the bowling
department, Christian came to the fore with a remarkable rush, recording the
exceptionally fine average of 6.62 runs per wicket for 24 wickets, while our old
standbys, Hewlett, Laver and Collins were again to the fore, their wickets costing
10, 11.54 and 14.04 runs per wicket, respectively, and proved very hard nuts for
opposing batsmen to crack. Collins took the greatest number of wickets, namely,
33-
The season opened on our ground, when our opponents, Richmond, started
the run of lower scoring, which was to be a feature of the season. The match
resulted in an easy win by one innings and 59 runs, Richmond’s totals being 73
and 82, while our single effort produced 214. Laver was very deadly with the
ball in the first innings of Richmond, taking seven for 26; and Hewlett bagged
two for 2. In their second, our captain’s tally was three for 6; Collins got two
for 17; and Christian, four for 37. J. McDonald, a son of the popular President
of the Warrnambool Club, played a beautiful innings for 74. Seitz also played
excellent cricket for 41; G. Healy justified his promotion to the First Eleven with
a well got 16, and Vollugi shaped well for 19. Laver’s policy in giving the
youngsters of the team a show to distinguish themselves, reserving the veterans
for the tail-end, proved a success, the colts doing well, easily topping the Rich-
mond score, the only veterans to make any show being Hewlett and Christian.
The Hawksburn match proved another good thing for us, our total being
101, and Hawksburn’s 55, and four for 55. Laver’s one wicket in the first
innings cost 4 runs, Collins took three for 28, and Hewlett four for 22.


Our one defeat was sustained at the hands of St. Kilda. The match was
remarkable in that it was one of the rare occasions upon which our friends the
seasiders have been successful against us; that it was one of the few pennant
matches of the season played upon a wicket unaffected by rain; and, finally, that
upon a perfect batsman's wicket, the bowler’s throughout had the upper hand.
When St. Kilda had only put up 125, it was looked upon as a foregone conclusion
that the game was ours: but the unexpected was once more in evidence, and our

unusual records for us to see on the board during our innings. The only pleasing
features of this match, from our point of view, were Laver’s bowling, seven
for 68, and two fine catches, one by Carter, and another by Godby.
Against South Melbourne, we declared with four down for 296, a superb
display by McAlister, for 146 (not out), marking our innings. South’s response
was 184, of which 157 were made by three of their batsmen.
Christian wrought sad havoc with the University Eleven, taking seven wickets


for ii runs, the whole side being out for 28. Considering the state of the wicket,
our score of 148 was a respectable one. Christian was to the fore in this also,
being “top” with 33, Seitz (31) and McMichael (29) also adding their quota.
Carlton were so hopelessly out of it on the first day that they abandoned the
game, Collins having taken seven wickets for 32, and Carlton’s total was 94. We
had two wickets down for 134, McAlister playing another of his fine innings for
72 not out.
The most exciting game of the season was that against North Melbourne,
which we won, after a close call, by 10 runs. Our first innings having produced
only 149 runs, and North Melbourne having lost one wicket for 30, the tipsters
prophesied an easy win for the Northerners, but they reckoned without Christian
and Laver, who each secured four of our opponent’s wickets, the former
especially being in rare form, his wickets costing only 25 runs, off 72 balls, to 58
scored off the latter. Hewlett also had a finger in the pie, disposing of two
wickets for 26. The value of a good fielding side was once more proved in this
game, and too much praise cannot be given to the performance of our representa-
tives ; but Wright, our wicket-keeper, deserves especial recognition; indeed, this
may be said of his work during the whole series of games which made the team
famous in these contests. Season after season he proved his worth, and I doubt
whether Victoria ever produced a more consistent, neat, and reliable keeper of
the sticks; the keeper of all time, Blackham, of course, stands alone in this
department. This match was practically the deciding game of the season, for
it placed us in an unassailable position, and the concluding match against Fitzroy
was a runaway game. With three wickets down, we closed for 287, another
fine display in the partnership between McAlister and McMichael not being
broken until 155 appeared on the boards, made in 128 minutes, McMichael going
first, with 71 to his credit, while McAlister added another to his many three-
figure scores, and was 142 (not out). Stuckey rattled up 40 in about the same
number of minutes, and Seitz made 17 (not out).
SEASON 1904-5
The team maintained its high standard of excellence in the season of 1904-5,
performing splendidly, and keeping undimmed the prestige gained by its previous
successes. Seven successive victories were scored over St. Kilda, University,
Richmond, Carlton, Hawksburn, South Melbourne, and North Melbourne, and
in the final match, against the formidable M.C.C. Eleven, we were in a very pro-
mising position, when a downpour of rain stopped the play, and the match ended
in a draw. This memorable match created intense interest, and the lame conclusion
was all the more disappointing to us, in that, although we considered we had the
match well in hand, the interruption to the play resulted in the premiership being
awarded to Melbourne on the averages, and thus destroyed our hopes of beating
all records, by securing the pennant in three successive seasons. A disastrous
start was made in the match, McAlister and Healy’s wickets having fallen with
the total at 4; Dawson added 5, and three wickets were down for 19, but the
association of McMichael, who captained the team, and went in first, and Seitz,
inaugurated a partnership which resulted in the splendid addition of 73, at this
critical juncture. Just after the interval, the former was bowled by Hazlitt for
58, made without giving a chance. Christian, who joined Seitz, followed his cap-
tain’s example, and another 108 was added to the score before Christian was caught


m the outfield, his contribution of 72 being compiled freely and faultlessly. The
light became very bad, but the umpires, on appeal, ruled “play on,” and Hewlett
fell a victim just before drawing of stumps. Six wickets being thus down for 221, a
very satisfactory total when the calibre of the bowlers, who included Trumble,
Hazlitt, and Ransford, is considered. Seitz, who had just won his Rhodes
scholarship, and had with difficulty obtained permission to be absent from the
University Commencement, had his loyalty to his Club rewarded by a first-class
J. A. SEITZ
performance, scoring a most invaluable 80 (not out). He made all his strokes
neatly, varied his rate of scoring according to circumstances, never appeared
puzzled, and gave no chance. McMichael having closed our innings, a clear vic-
tory being our only chance to win the premiership, Melbourne lost four wickets
(Vaughan, Trumble, Ransford and Hill) for 80, when rain put an end to the
play. Our six wickets, counting as ten in the compilation of averages, further
reduced our bowling averages. The position of the two clubs was officially worked
out by an elaborate arithmetical process as follows;

The performance of the team was all the more creditable, as throughout a
considerable portion of the season they were without the services of Laver and
Stuckey,, the former absent in connection with the Australian Eleven, and the
latter through accident. Christian headed the batting average for the season
with 48 for 10 innings. Wright, whose wicket-keeping throughout the past seven
seasons had been of such great value to the team, added to his laurels by batting
capitally, secured an average of 45.66 for seven innings, followed by Healy
(35.60), Laver (35.60), McAlister (35.63), and McMichael (34.61).
The bowling honours were secured by Collins, who was in great form. He
was closely followed by Hewlett and Christian. These three, who bore the brunt
of the bowling, had records so close and excellent that they deserve quoting; —
Christian's figures, combined with his performance with the bat, proved him
one of the best all-round cricketers of the State for the season.
SEASON 1905-6
We had again to be contented with second place in the season of 1905-6.
Two young players, G. Healy and A. Seitz, were in fine form throughout the sea-
son, the former heading the batting averages, with 45.2 per innings, and the latter
37.7; Seitz secured the highest aggregate for the season. McAlister, as usual, was
well up on the list, his average of 41.4 being second only to Healy’s. Christian’s
brilliant batting, both for the State and for the Club, was one of the features of
the season, and he averaged, for the Club, 30 runs per innings.
Bowling honours were divided between Collins, on whom the main responsi-
bility rested, Laver, and Christian. Collins captured 47 wickets, at an average
cost of 13.34. Barry, from the Second Eleven, proved himself also of great
value to the side.
SEASONS 1906-7 and 1907-8
The scheme of district cricket, to which I refer elsewhere, was brought to a
head in the following season, and, though the personnel of the team was greatly
changed, owing to the provisions of the system under which players are restricted
in their choice of club mates to boundaries arbitrarily fixed by the controlling
cricket body, the eleven went through this, and the following season, without
suffering a single defeat. The names of Rainey, Douglas, Walsh, Goss, Parsons,

Reeves, and Scott, Vollugi, and Douglas, make their appearance in the scoring
books of the Club.
In 1906-7 we won two matches outright, eight on the first innings, lost none,
and drew one, making 22 points, as against the runners-up (South Melbourne)
11 points.
Notwithstanding the infusion of new blood, batting and bowling honours
were secured by two of the old brigade, McAlister and Laver, in 1906-7, and
Laver and Collins in 1907-8. In the former year McAlister finished the season
with the very fine average of 79-11, having scored an aggregate of 712 runs, in-
cluding a magnificent 265 (not out) against St. Kilda, while Laver captured 40
wickets at a cost of 10.92 runs per wicket.
In 1907-8, Laver’s batting average was 83, assisted, however, by four not-
out innings, and Collins had the fine average of 9.5 per wicket for 36 wickets
taken.
SEASON 1908-9
After two seasons of unbroken success in pennant games, the Club received
a check in 1908-9, sustaining its first defeat at the hands of Prahran.
This unaccustomed experience was repeated in the final, and deciding, game
against the same Club, when we were relegated to second place on the premier-
ship list. This final match was played on Easter Saturday and Monday, when,
notwithstanding the late period of the season, an exceptionally fine wicket was
provided by Capewell. The weather, too, was all that could be desired, and we
put up the excellent total of 340. The feature of our innings was a brilliant dis-
play for 102 by W. Scott; Rainey (55) and A. S. Carter (46) also helped to swell
the total, which, however, was insufficient, for our opponents scoring 349 for
the loss of seven wickets, secured a well-deserved win, by three wickets and
9 runs. The favourable conditions under which this match was played, the
keenness of the contest, and the fine displays on both sides, lent exceptional in-
terest to the game. The performance of Prahran, in facing a total of 340, suc-
cessfully, was most meritorious. We suffered severely in strength through the
absence of the backbone of the team, in Laver, McAlister and Collins. What
that meant to us can best be realised by a reference to the records of the previous
ten or twelve years.
Carroll made his first appearance for the Club this season, and signalised it
by heading the list of batting averages, with 51.22 for 11 innings, Laver following
with 47.86 for nine innings. Carter had the best average for the season (55), but
only played four innings. McMichael led the team during the absence of Laver,
and proved himself a capable captain. He batted, also, as attractively as of
yore, his average being 37.75, a fine innings of 94, against Fitzroy, being specially
worthy of mention.
Bowling honours were again carried off by Laver, who obtained 36 wickets
at a cost of 11.14 runs per wicket; Collins and Parsons came next, with 27 and
38 wickets, for 16 and 16.18 runs per wicket, respectively.
SEASON 1909-10
From 1906, up to the present time, the Club has maintained its high position
in pennant cricket, notwithstanding the disintegration brought about by the estab-
lishment of district cricket. The team were premiers in 1906-7, and 1907-8. and


runners-up in 1908-9; but in this, the final year of our half-century’s existence,
which I had hoped to see closed with Club flying the Association Pennant, we
have had again to be content with second place, thus, for the first time since
1895-6, two seasons have gone by without our securing the coveted first place.
Altogether, I regret to say, the season was an unsatisfactory one. There
appeared to be an evident absence of “ pulling together,” and a very undesirable
unevenness of form throughout. The opening match, against South, gave promise
of a successful year, as, under the captaincy of McMichael, a brilliant victory was
scored, mainly through a great innings of by McMichael, in which he gave
no chance, and showed that he had lost none of his grace and precision. The
captain was ably assisted by Seitz—just returned from England, where he worthily
upheld the reputation of the Club at his University—who scored 52 ; \V. Scott, 49:
and Godby, 54; our total of 360 for nine wickets securing a victory by three
wickets and 249 runs. The small score of South Melbourne was brought about
by the excellent bowling of Collins and Parsons. The former bowled throughout
unchanged, his figures being: 156 balls, 7 maidens, 7 wickets, 40 runs.
The following game, against Carlton, showed a great reversal of form,
Carlton declaring with four for 313, out of which the veteran, Warne, made
145, and we just managed to stave off defeat, and secure a rather inglorious draw;
six wickets being down for 106 at call of time.
A win by 207 runs, against Richmond, made us hope that the form against
Carlton would not be repeated. Parsons bowled in fine form in this match, as
his figures, five for 35, show. In this game Godby showed something of his old
form, and his innings of 129 was deservedly eulogised. Baring, a colt of great
promise, also played a useful game for 74, Seitz was 46, and another promising
colt, in Strut, showed good form for 37. Our score was 370 against Richmond’s
119, and four for 53 in their second innings.
We followed up this success by defeating Prahran by 67 runs: Prahran, 172;
E.M., 239. Rainey again proved his value in a meritorious innings of 83, and
that good all-round man, Parsons, made 53.
We were once more successful against University by three wickets; Univer-
sity having scored 231, we had to play against time to secure a victory. McAlister
captained the team, and signalised his return by making 48, though not with that
precision for which he is justly famed; but the feature of our innings, and the
main factor in our success, was a brilliant, forcing innings of 102, by Carroll.
This constituted our third consecutive win, none of which, however, gained in a
manner to inspire confidence in the consistency of the team.
A draw against North Melbourne followed, brought about by the clerk of
the weather. No play took place on the first day, the ground being saturated. We
made 227, but North did not bat. Our principal contributors were: Scott, 65;
Vernon, 39; and Baring, 27.
We next met our famous old opponents, M.C.C., and though not counting,
under our most unsatisfactory system, for premiership honours, the match was
looked forward to by all lovers of the game to provide a treat of really first-class
cricket, and a closely contested match. Unfortunately this was not realised, as
our form was very mediocre, and we suffered a pronounced defeat by six wickets
and 153 runs. It must, however, be borne in mind that we were greatly weakened,
owing to the absence, from various causes, of Laver, McAlister, McMichael, Scott,
Vernon and Parsons.
The next premiership match was against Fitzroy, in which our batsmen


showed their true form, McAlister gratifying us with an innings of 104, while
Seitz gave a magnificent exhibition. He and Scott, who also played a fine game,
being not out, 166, and 44, respectively, the scoring board reminding us of old
times, by showing two for 329. Fitzroy’s total was in, Collins being the chief
instrument of their dismissal, and securing seven wickets for 54. Reeves kept
wickets in excellent style.
Maintaining the good form displayed against Fitzroy, we won our next game,
against North Melbourne, in a manner which led us to be very sanguine of our
ultimate success in the struggle for the premiership. Having disposed of our
opponents for 247, owing to excellent bowling by Collins and Vernon, who kept
a good length throughout, we came in first by the handsome margin of six wickets.
Scott played a first-class, faultless innings of no, and the consistent Seitz followed
closely with 81, and Rainey played a useful not-out innings of 17.
Then came our Waterloo! in which that unevenness of form previously
referred to was painfully displayed, for we wound up the season with the most
crushing defeat in the history of the Club, when the St. Kilda C.C. scored 487
runs against our 93. The match was played in glorious weather for the two
Saturdays, and on a perfect wicket all through. St. Kilda won the toss, and by
good management, and exceptionally good play, retained possession of the wicket
for the two Saturdays set apart for the match; a rather unusual feature of the
large innings being that no one made a century, Dudgeon, with 97, being highest.
East Melbourne had to play on Monday, when a thunderstorm was brewing, at
4 p.m., and were all quickly disposed of for the above poor total. The lack of
cohesion, erratic fielding, bad catching, assisted materially to swell the St. Kilda
total, and probably the loss of our stock bowler and good general, Laver, was
never more pronouncedly brought home to us, and I can only hope that next
season we shall again see a united team, and a return to the triumphs of old.
On going through the pennant games of each season since their inception,
one is struck by the frequency of unsatisfactory conclusions, owing to the deciding
games being left over until the tail end of the season, when the interest of the
public and player alike has somewhat waned, and the advent of the footballer on
the field causes many players to temporarily transfer their allegiance to the
winter game. It is probably difficult to arrange, especially in seasons when our
home friends are visiting us, but there is surely sufficient resource in our Associa-
tion to fix the semi-finals and finals in such a way that these, the most exciting
and strenuous club games of each season, may be played to a finish under equal
conditions. At the present, matches are played at a season of the year when
weather conditions are most uncertain, and the winner of the toss has a decided
lien upon the game, added to which, the team going in second are sure to be com-
pelled to bat in broken time on week days, to the inconvenience of the players, and
the annoyance of the public; while the severe handicap to the batting side the
continual breaks entail, is too patent to every cricketer to need further comment.
Three Saturdays, at least, should be set aside for the concluding game, which
should be commenced earlier. A reform of this kind would do much to revive
the interest in club cricket, which every lover of the game desires to see accom-
plished, and a return to the absorbing interest with which the Cup matches of
the “ seventies ” were followed would, in all probability, be secured. I was pleased
to see, in the final match, the abandonment of the absurd four o’clock adjourn-
ment, a return to commonsense which gained unanimous expressions of approval.

A FAMOUS JOLIMONT TRIO
On perusing these records one cannot fail to be struck by the constant pro-
minence into which their performances bring the names of Laver, McAlister, and
McMichael, during the last two decades.
Making their bid for First Eleven honours practically at the same time, they
sprang at a bound into the front rank of the Club’s representatives in the field,
and the continual iteration of the triumphs of one or the other, or all three, in
match after match, from that time up to the present, forms one of the most note-
worthy features of the history of the Club. So inseparably linked with its
successes have they been, and so keenly felt was the absence of any one of them
from the team, that I have no hesitation in saying this famous trio have been the
main factors in the unparalleled, or, at all events, unsurpassed, achievements of
the Club’s premier team since their accession to its ranks. On more than one
occasion, when we just missed premiership honours, the absence of one or more
of the triumvirate was in very great measure responsible for our failure to wind
up the season consistently with prior performances. We had an exemplification
of this no further back than in the season just passed; McMichael was injured
early in the year, after having given exhibitions of batting which indicated that
he would probably equal, if not excel, in brilliancy, the best records of his career.
McAlister was absent for the greater part of the season, Laver for the whole,
and, as was said when the memorable fiasco against St. Kilda, in the final match,
took place, the presence of Jolimont’s captain-bowler would in all likelihood have
entirely changed the aspects and outcome of the game.
From the season 1887-8, these three between them scored in all matcehs
25,198 runs, 705 innings, 97 not outs, average 41.240; and in first-class club
matches no less than 19,232 runs; played 519 innings, 62 times not out, giving an
average of 40.8 per innings per man; and their individual figures deserve repeti-
tion. They are: —
Laver is undoubtedly the leading light in the triangular constellation, for in
addition to his great batting triumphs, which led a well-known cricket writer to
introduce him to Lord Brassey as “the man of many centuries,” his bowling has
been the mainstay of the Club year in and year out, and has many times turned
an apparently certain defeat into a triumphant victory. How valuable his services
in the bowling department have been, the following figures eloquently demon-
strate :

His capacity in the field has become a by-word among followers of the game,
and joined to his dexterity as bowler, batsman and field, he has proved himself
one of the most capable leaders any Club has had, in which department he has
won alike the confidence and esteem of all who have had the pleasure of playing
under or against him.

games for the Club than any other player, and what a thorn in the sides of our
opponents has been that combination of " the two Macs,” who so successfully
started our innings, and, time after time, took the sting out of the bowling, and
put up their centuries throughout these years.
Notwithstanding the consistent and brilliant performances of these three stars,
an unaccountable prejudice kept them out of representative cricket for years, and
even after having proved their capacity in intercolonial contests, the same strange
perversity withheld from one or other of them the honour of a place in an
Australian Eleven. To my mind', this was an obsession only paralleled on the occa-
sion when Boyle (at the time undoubtedly in the first flight of Australia’s picked
eleven) was not considered worthy of a place in the Victorian Eleven.
I cannot close this chapter without paying further tribute to McMichael, who
at a most critical period of the Club’s fortunes undertook the onerous and honorary
office of Secretary, carrying out his trying duties with credit to himself, and to
the great advantage of the Club. So much were his services appreciated that a
handsome memento of his term of office was presented to him by his grateful
Clubmates, on his relinquishing Secretarial duties in favour of our present capable
and esteemed Hon. Sec., Mr. F. S. Hilcke.
SOME NOTABLE MATCHES PLAYED AT “EAST”
A world-wide, interesting match was styled, Smokers v. Non-Smokers, played
March 17, 18, 19, and 21, 1887, when Lilly white’s English Team and the Aus-
tralian Eleven were divided. This match produced cricket of the highest order,
and caused a considerable amount of excitement, not only in the colonies, but in
England, and, at the time, the highest recorded score in any match in the world
was made. After four days’ keen play, it was drawn, vastly in favour of the
Non-Smokers.

One of the sensational matches played by the Club was against a Tasmanian
team, on our own ground, in December, 1879, when we made the highest score
in the world at that time, the innings lasting the full two days allotted to the
match, and, although we offered to play on, many of the Tasmanians could not
give further time.
It was computed that H. V. Bayley, a fast bowler, who took a long run,
must have run nearly seven miles in the two days —a wonderful performance.
\V. G. Grace remarked of Bayley, that “ he was one of the best bowlers
he ever played against,” which makes our performance all the more meritorious.
In this match, two other incidents occurred, Gaggin making his first century,
and T. Horan making the Australian record to the time —250 (not out).
East Melbourne Record Score, 742, the largest in the world at that time,
the next being Royal Artillery versus Engineers, 724, for eight wickets.

As further evidence of the spirit and “go” of our members, so early as
1877 we sent a very strong eleven to Adelaide to play a South Australian tearm
and this match was undoubtedly a factor in materially assisting cricket in that
State, and though I tried hard, when the V.C.A. afterwards took up matches with
South Australia, to secure the matches for our own ground, I was unsuccessful.
It was in this match that H. H. Budd, who was our umpire, caused a great stir
by no-balling Whitridge, the South Australian bowler, for throwing. This
incident created a lot of newspaper controversy, and caused some feeling for a
long time.

The match was really won by eight wickets, but Wilkie, however, agreed to
play on.
Our first meeting with Tasmania took place on our own ground, in March,
1875, when we succeeded in defeating the representatives of the island State by
38 runs. A match against the Victorian Eleven was played in December, 1877.
The Club being allowed 15 men, went very near to repeating their victory of
1865. The eleven were disposed of for too, against our 263, Gaggin and
Andrew Loughnan each playing a fine innings of 66 and 90 (not out), respectively,
for us. The Eleven lost five wickets for 107 in their second, the draw being very
much in our favour.


COUNTRY CRICKET
The scope of country cricket, which the Club had done so much to promote
during the sixties, was widened greatly during this decade, and matches were
instituted with country districts never hitherto visited by metropolitan teams.
Though the extension of railway communication enabled this to be done with
greater frequency and ease than formerly, it speaks volumes for the enthusiasm
of the playing members that matches should have been successfully engaged in at
places so far apart as Wangaratta, in the far North-East, and Sale, then truly in
the wilds of Gippsland, each being practically terra incognita to the great majority
of Victorians prior to its connection by rail with Melbourne.
The match with Ovens District —necessitating the journey to Wangaratta—
was inaugurated mainly owing to the efforts of Mr. J. B. Docker, of “ Bon-
therambo,” whose hospitable invitation on behalf of the cricketers of the district
was warmly responded to, and n good men and true left Spencer Street on the
eve of the Easter holidays, and, after a five hours’ rail journey to Violet Town,
were all aboard a coach and four, cn route for the pretty little town on the banks
of the Ovens and King Rivers, that is to say, all were aboard save the wily
captain, and Darke, two “ knowing birds,” who availed themselves of a friend's
buggy and pair, to avoid the bumping and jolting of the coach. The team arrived
at Wangaratta at 5 a.m., all but the two knowing ones, who did not put in an
appearance until the afternoon, much the worse for wear, the good thing in
buggies having been a snare and a delusion.
The Ovens team was chosen from the players of Albury, Wahgunyah, Beech-
worth and Wangaratta, and included some old E.M.C.C. mates, in the Dights,
Curtis Reid, and others; also W. E. Brown, an old Sydney player, and the first
secretary of the Albert C.C. Notwithstanding the generous hospitality of the
North-Easterners, we succeeded in getting home by 25 runs. The disasters of
the buggy enterprise did not have an ill-effect on the bowling of Darke, for he
obtained nine for 28 in the first innings, and seven for 47 in the second innings
of Wangaratta; Wyndham (three for 18) and Dan. Wilkie (two for 8) doing
their share also. These pleasant games became annual fixtures for Easter. The
Easter of 1875 saw two country teams in the field at the same time, one at
Wangaratta, and the other at Sale; both were successful. Something to be proud
of when it is remembered that our roll of playing members at that time did not
exceed 30.
The Gippsland team, leaving Cobb’s office, in Bourke Street, at mid-day on
Thursday, reached Sale on Good Friday afternoon. During the journey they
were often inclined to agree with the coachdriver's dictum, “ That those who
travelled by coach to Sale to play cricket, were not unlikely people to seek amuse-
ment in .” However this may have been, they arrived sound in wind and
limb, if somewhat battered about, with spirits undamped, and on the Saturday
put through the Sale 18 by an innings. Captain Dan. having a picnic, securing
thirteen for 20 in the first, and nine for 14 in the second innings ; in the latter,
Charlie Alice took six for 3, the 18 totting up 17 in all. The total scores were:—
E.M., 95 : Sale, 42 and 17.


A second match was played on Easter Monday against 22 of Gippsland, and
ended, amidst great excitement, in a tie. The chief feature of the match was the
plentiful supply of “ ducks ” contributed by each, in fair proportion, the 22
accounting for 12, and the eleven for 6, Gippsland hospitality, as well as the
vagaries of the ground, being doubtless responsible.
Many other country matches were also added to our programme, Ararat,
Hamilton, Camper down, Warrnambool, etc., etc., were visited in turn, the old
contests with Corio, Ballarat, and Bendigo being likewise continued.
Our Easter trip, in 1880, was once again to the North-East, the venue being
changed, however, to Benalla, at the instance of Mr. John Brock, a warm sup-
porter of the Club, and a subsequent V.P. Though we came off second best,
losing by 16 runs, we had a hearty reception, meeting genial friends, and renewing
acquaintances with old Jolimonters. The team was hospitably entertained, and
spent a real good time. Some thrilling adventures in the piscatorial line were
narrated, and I believe the weight of the baskets was some times in inverse ratio
to that of the anglers.
The following year the North-Eastern team tried conclusions with us at
Jolimont, and we had our revenge, securing an easy win by three wickets and
66 runs. Scores: 129, and seven for 194, Walsh (46) and C. Alice (44) being
our chief scores, and the latter took thirteen wickets for 51.
The next Easter we again journeyed to the Broken River, and were again
defeated. R. Wootton, notwithstanding that he had in the meantime lost three
fingers of his right hand, apparently retaining all his pace and precision, and
being ably assisted by Peter McLean, an old Scotch Collegian, we were 55 to the
bad. Following up their success, the Benallaites organised a fifteen in the next
year, and again defeated us on our own ground.
A Record. —On 5th April, 1862, we played a match against the Coast Club,
a strong team in those da} r s, composed of residents of Brighton, and in which
the late Sir Thomas Bent and his brother, the brothers Agg, and others took part.
The Coast team was got rid of for 7 runs, of which “Mr. Sundries’ accounted for
4, Aylwyn 2, and 1 other. No fewer than nine “ ducks ” were hatched. Dan.
Wilkie (six wickets) and J. McPherson (four wickets) were the destroying
angels. This is one of the smallest scores ever made in a first-class match.

DISTRICT CRICKET
District cricket was established by the Victorian Association in 1906, and,
although good results were prophesied, I fail to see that it has been of the great
value claimed by its supporters. On the other hand, there is no doubt that positive
harm has eventuated, in the breaking up of teams that had grown up together, and
whose great idea was their Club’s welfare, the ranks of the first elevens being
constantly filled from the second eleven, thus providing a natural stepping stone
for players, and keeping club members always together. In our position, the
district can never take the place of the Club. A young player gravitates to a
club where the chosen companions of his school-days are likely to be associated
with him; the district system compels him to play wherever he may chance to
reside, without regard to his predilictions or associations. To my mind, this is
utterly subversive to that esprit de corps, club pride, and community of feeling,
which are such potent factors in producing a whole-hearted player, playing the
game for itself, and furthering the interests of the club he voluntarily associates
himself with, and when his active part in the game ceases, passing on the splendid
traditions of his club to the younger generations taking his place.
A difficulty arose about allocating districts to our Club and the M.C.C., which
was obviated by making the M.C.C. a free club, open to all, but not allowed to
play pennant matches, and it is a moot point if it had not been better for cricket
generally had the E.M.C.C. been made a free club also, for there can be no gain-
saying that it would be much more interesting to witness matches between two
powerful sides, than to compel a powerful team to meet a weak one, in which
neither players nor public take the slightest interest. It will be noticed that our
team to-day is made up principally of men who have graduated with other clubs,
and many players brought up with us, and who naturally looked forward to
occupying places in the First Eleven, are compelled, by residence, to play with
clubs with which they can have but little interest, or else they must abandon the


game; nor can it be argued that a first-class player, compelled to play with an
outside club, can get the valued practice obtainable on the metropolitan grounds.
Perhaps as the Club I take so much pride in is the greatest sufferer by the
innovation, I may be thought to take a jaundiced view of the present state of
affairs, but I am convinced that ere long, unless some drastic move is made, we
shall see the objectionable features of the football quasi-professionalism intro-
duced into club cricket. How easy for a man to “ qualify ” himself, provided the
“ inducement ” be powerful enough, by a change of residence from one suburb
to another. Already permits have been granted—probably the thin end of the
wedge.
East Melbourne, I am proud to say, reached its foremost position without
offering inducements to any player to abandon the club which brought him out,
and has invariably relied upon its own resources.
The number of years many of our players have taken their places in the
Club’s teams must attract attention, showing their splendid pride in the Club.
This valuable trait must, to a great extent, disappear if district cricket is to stay,
and I sincerely hope I may again see our Club absolutely free from outside
control, the teams full of that pride in themselves, in their Club, and in the game
which has been so characteristic of its members for the past 50 years, and with
such meritorious results.
ANNUAL DINNER
A prominent feature of the Club in past days was the Annual Dinner, held
at the close of each season, which undoubtedly did much to foster that good-
fellowship which has been so conspicuous among members of the Club. At these
dinners, many capital speeches by public men, as well as by members, were made,
and it is difficult to suggest any cause for the abandonment of such an excellent
practice, and possibly the Committee may see its way clear to revert to a very
good old custom. On this subject, it is interesting to quote a paragraph from
the Club’s report, presented to our predecessors, in May, iB6O, over 50 years ago:
—“ It is a social meeting which will strengthen the union more strongly between
members and the Club; it is an occasion for subduing and annihilating party feel-
ings ; it induces a friendly feeling among members; it gives confidence in the Club;
and, it will induce united action at any time for any object for the improvement
of the Club.” Good reasons for to-day !
OUR GROUND
The question of the tenure of the ground has always been a bugbear, but I
cannot say that it has caused me much uneasiness after getting assurances from
men like the late Mr. Richard Speight, the late Hon. J. B. Patterson, and many
others, that we were not likely to be interfered with, and now, after fifty }?ears'
occupation of the ground, the large amount of money spent on it, the comparison
of the state of the ground of the past and the present, the popularity of the Club,
especially with the surrounding residents, all combine to make our tenure abso-
lutely secure, except for railway purposes. I can readily believe the property
owners and residents of Jolimont would rise en masse to prevent the railways
getting nearer to them now, more especially when such a large area of ground is


available on the other side of the line, and I am sanguine enough to believe that the
East Melbourne Club and Ground, with ordinary tact on the part of the Com-
mittees in power, will still be in existence at its centenary.
In October, 1876, after some considerable trouble with the Board of Works,
we got a Committee of Management gazetted by the Government, to exercise
control over the reserve for cricket and other purposes of public recreation.
The Committee so appointed, and which has not been superseded, consisted of
Messrs. R. D. Reid (deceased), William Riggall, O. C. Williams, H. H. Budd
(deceased), and A. E. Clarke, with the President of the Board.
In the year 1882, arrangements were made with the Essendon Football Club
to play their matches on our ground, and this has been in force ever since, much
to the satisfaction of both clubs. The financial results have been so satisfactory
that we have been enabled to vastly improve the accommodation for the members,
and for the public, so that, at the present date, 30,000 people can get an excellent
view of the game being played. What would some of the old identities say,
could they re-visit the ground on a football afternoon, and note the results of
their early endeavours. To me, who has watched the steady growth of the
Club, and its many improvements, it seems almost like a dream. The Committee
now, I believe, is preparing the way for building an up-to-date and commodious
stand, and thus do away with a very serviceable relic of the past, which, unques-
tionably, has seen its day.
FINANCE
The financing of the Club has always caused an immense amount of anxiety
and work. In the early days, the great bulk of our members being young
fellows, either at school or in offices, could not be expected to contribute largely
to the growing necessities of the Committee, and had it not been for the generous
assistance of a few public-spirited citizens, the, at times, almost necessarily
feverish haste of the Committee could not have been satisfied. From the very
start, expenses commenced, and we were very fortunate that we could keep going.
A great satisfaction at the present day is that very little work has to be done
over again, except where the old has to make way for the new. I think this
fact shows the care at all times exercised by the Ground Committee, under whom
all expenditure was incurred, and when it is remembered the ground was
worse than an ordinary bare patch, that all had to be turned over, no water but
what we got off the road, no fence worthy of the name—in fact, no anything,
but a splendid natural turf, it is difficult to compare, or even understand, the
present and the past. We only knew all difficulties had to be, and were got
over, and present members owe a great debt of gratitude to those splendid men
who so closely watched over the interests of the Club and its ground.
Originally, as I have said, a tree was our back-stop, until we got a home-
made net. A tree, and afterwards, but only on special occasions, a tent gave

us shelter, and with that we were a happy and hard-working band. Then
came our wooden pavilion. The ground, at that time, was surrounded on the
north and east by a low two-rail fence, and it was this fence that nearly cost
L. Goldsmith his life, and caused all the excitement of the celebrated “ Lost
Ball ” Match mentioned elsewhere. That fence was by degrees replaced by
a sound picket one, which, later, made way for the present iron fence, and the
ground thoroughly enclosed. Water was laid on in 1864, much to Old Mac’s
joy, and lately the buildings have been sewered. All these improvements have
run into something approaching £20,000, and it is very satisfactory to know that
the Club is not only out of debt, but has a substantial credit balance.
There is no disputing the fact that for this happy state of affairs we are
greatly indebted to the Essendon Football Club, in playing its matches on our
ground, and to a lesser extent to the University Football Club, which, for the last
two or three seasons, has taken the ground on the Saturdays on which the Essen-
don Club were playing elsewhere.
Mainly by the proceeds of the matches played by these clubs, we have been
enabled to spend, within the past five years, over £SOOO in improving the ground,
besides paying off £2OOO of liabilities, and now have a comfortable credit to
go towards a new grand-stand.
Before that time it is impossible to say what was spent on the ground, as
no records can be found. Cricket matches during the great Cup time con-
tributed handsomely, no less a sum than £650 being taken in one match. With
the assistance of concerts, open-air entertainments, donations, the kind help of
the M.C.C., and in other ways, money nearly always came when required, and
allowed necessary improvements to go on continuously; but, from the peculiar
title to the ground, and the altogether too frequent cries of “ Wolf,” on account
of the Railway Department, we were never in a position to obtain the necessary
capital to erect a much-needed and suitable grand-stand. That, however, I
understand, the present Committee has determined to take in hand, and we may
close the first fifty years of our existence with the knowledge that we have spent
over £20,000 on our ground, and that the only heavy expenditure required in
the immediate future is for a new grand-stand, the ground and its surroundings
merely requiring the usual close supervision.
In mentioning the assistance by the M.C.C., it is as well members should
know that, when we were in dire trouble, and on all sides it was suggested we
should close, the M.C.C. magnanimously lent us the money necessary to carry
on, rather than take the Club over, as was urged by some in both clubs. We
owe a debt of gratitude to the M.C.C., which I hope members will never forget.
OLD IDENTITIES’ MATCHES
APRIL 21 st, 1891.
The old players of the Club invited the old players of the M.C.C. to meet
to fight their battles over again; the idea was taken up very earnestly on both
sides, and a most enjoyable day’s cricket was the result. When I mention the
names of W. Gaggin, L. Goldsmith, C. Carr, E. P. Hastings, H. Wyndham, Ben
James, T. Hepburn, E. Fowler, C. Forrester, Percy Cox, and W. H. Peryman,
who represented E.M., and on the other side such men as B. B. Cooper, A. Lough-

nan, T. J. D. Kelly, T. C. Riddell, W. Newing, B. J. Wardill, H. J. King, and
others, as the representatives, it can easily be understood that it was no muff
cricket, and to a certain extent the same old feeling was shown by the players.
The match was such a success from a social point of view, that the Press thought
it worthy of an extended and highly complimentary notice.
A return match was played on March 2nd, 1893, between the two clubs,
when again a representative lot of the “ Has-beens ” on both sides took part in
a most enjoyable day’s play on the Melbourne ground.
There is no doubt that these matches, happily thought of, and still more
happily carried out, had a very marked effect in bringing members of both clubs
into more friendly feeling, and I think it is a matter of regret that matches are
not more frequently arranged and carried out on similar lines. When our first
flight men who have done yeoman service, not only for their Club, but for the
cause of cricket generally, drop back, they should not be allowed to rust and die
as forgotten, as we are allowing them to do now, and it can only be good to the
game to see men like Trumble, Frank Allan, Horan, Blackham, Giffen, Gaggin,
Wilkie, Wardill, Carr, Groube, and a host of others, go into the field as of yore,
though we all know they cannot show the prowess that has won them renown,
they can still show the younger members of the community, both cricketing and
otherwise, some of the form that has made Australian cricket acknowledged
throughout the world. Another great advantage would be in bringing the old
and new players together to know each other, as I have frequently heard the
remark, and regretfully felt the truth of it, that “ old members are unknown on
the grounds and in the pavilion nowadays.” This was amusingly brought into
notice a week or two since, when our world-famous old identity, T. Horan, was
coaching a young fellow on the ground, who afterwards asked who “ that old
buffer” was! ! “ Sic transit,” etc.
JUBILEE YEAR-1910
The Annual Report of the Committee to the members of the Club, for the
season 1909-10, has been published since the foregoing was written, and what a
vast difference is evidenced between now and 50 years ago, showing how well
the Club has followed the progress of the State. Now a members’ roll of 560
against a modest 20 to 30 to start with. The ground, now second to none as a
cricket field; the appointments, certainly not all that we could wish, but all that
are necessary and capable of comfortably accommodating 30,000 to 40,000 on-
lookers; the finances of the Club in a flourishing position, with over £l5OO to
credit, and all debts save one cleared off. What a splendid position to start the
second half of our century! How pleased previous hard-worked, anxious treasurers
and committee-men would be, could they know the wonderful results following
their exertions.
The members’ roll is one to be proud of; I would, however, be pleased to see
the names of many old members, staunch supporters of the Club in the years
gone by, on the list, and I hope this hint will bring some of the “ lost sheep back
to the fold.”
The performances of the players, more especially of the Second Eleven, have
been very satisfactory, and it is a genuine pleasure to know there is again a strong
Scond Eleven, who played up well, until defeated in the semi-final match for
the premiership.


It was a matter for regret by all supporters of the Club, and followers of
the game, that Frank Laver, our esteemed captain, did not take part in any of
the matches of the past season, and all will be pleased to know that he will be
with us again in the coming season, when, I trust, he will have a grand team to
maintain the prestige of the Club.
It must also be a matter of great satisfaction to the officers and Committee
that members are so satisfied with their capable management during the past
year, that all should be re-elected, without opposition, to carry out the programme
laid out for the future, and in which all can heartily join in wishing them a
“ bright and prosperous New Year.”
THE AVERAGES
The Club is to be congratulated upon having such a complete set of averages
as are displayed in the pavilion, and it will be noticed that I have only repro-
duced the three or four highest batting and bowling averages. In looking through
the averages as given elsewhere, the reader will be struck with the remarkable
difference between iB6O and 1910. I consider nothing can show more clearly
the advancement of the game in that period, for low as the averages are, and
necessarily the scores were low also, our proportion of wins was always good,
and I much regret that space will not allow me to give more names, as a great
many valued members of the Club cannot appear.
The few runs scored in the early days must attract attention, for in iB6O
we find J. McPherson 115 runs, with an average of 11. In 1861-2, G. Tait 236
runs, with an average of 15. These were our champions at that time, and it
will be noticed that not until 1866-7 were 323 reached, by J. Phillips, then five
years later 377 by J. McPherson in 1871, average 29, followed in 1872-3 by
W. W. Gaggin with '412, average 27, which he bettered in 1877-8 with 447,
and an average of 34. In 1879-80, T. Horan comes with 576, average 64, fol-
lowed in 1882-3 by H. Scott with 715 runs, average 51; then in 1889-9 J
Harry was the first to top 1000, 1033, with an average of 48, and in 1895-6,
George Vautin topped all previous totals with 1201 runs.
During these years the general play had wonderfully improved, not alone
on account of the better wickets played on, but by the greater skill shown all
round, for although I have only mentioned the highest averages, they were not by
any means always top scorers, which showed year by year a remarkable im-
provement.
In the early days, a total of 100 runs in an innings was pretty nearly a
certain win. None of us would feel very comfortable with such a score now,
when we look for that many from individual members of the team, and some
have scored over 300 each. The averages shown are well worthy of perusal
by all who take an interest in our Club as well as in the grand old game.
The bowling averages also show excellent results, and though it has always
been thought we have been wanting in bowlers, the averages would not lead
one to say so, for in iB6O we find Murphy 11 wickets at a cost of runs,
in 1861-2 McPherson 47 wickets cost 4.42, and in 1862-3, 44 wickets at a cost
of 6.10, which he followed next year with 41 wickets at a cost of 5 runs, and
for seven years shows an average of 6.56 per wicket.

Dan Wilkie started in 1861 with an average of 4 runs, and we find his
name appearing regularly until 1875- There is no doubt about Wilkie
having been the very best slow underhand bowler we have ever had in Australia,
and it is a question if he was in any way short of the English slow bowler,
Tinley. In all, from iB6O to 1875, he took 5 : 5 wickets for 3700 runs, an average
of 7.95 runs per wicket, a record player and Club alike may well feel proud of.
Charlie Allee, one of our staunchest players, occupies an exceptionally good
position, with an average of 10 runs and 534 wickets obtained during 20 years’
play.
Boyle’s totals, 1872-94, also attract attention, 619 wickets and 5356 runs
in 23 years, an average of 8 and a third.
Frank Laver’s average, 15.79 runs f° r 473 wickets, in 21 years, does not read
so well as Boyle’s and Wilkie’s, but it must be remembered he came on the scene
only in 1887, and since then heavy scoring has been invariably the rule. He has
proved himself a tower of strength at all times.
Fred. Collins, who has been prominent since 1898, also stands well, his
313 wickets costing only an average of i3-43> an( l sincerely hope to see this
enthusiastic young fellow come back to his previous good form.
Our good old friend, T. Horan, occupies a conspicuous position on the
bowling sheet, as well as on the batting, and has many meritorious performances
to his name.
With men like McShane, Christian, Goss, Trapp, Trott, Letcher, Darke,
Carter, and others, and with our opponents’ batting averages considered, there
seems no justification for the almost regular cry that “ E.M. has no bowlers ”;
we have held, and can still hold, our own very well.
Not in any way to detract from the value of the bowlers, it must be ad-
mitted that they have at all times been supported by some of the finest fielding
we have seen in the States, the First Eleven, all through its career, having been
noted for its efficiency in this department of the game, and many a match has
been won only by the exceptional prowess in the field shown by members of the
team.
In wicket-keeping, too, we have been especially well served by G. O’Mullane,
Elliott, P. Lewis, Wright, and in late years by Reeves, who were only surpassed
by the Prince of Keepers, Blackham; Elliott and Lewis, in addition to their
wicket-keeping, occupied high positions in the batting averages.

THE PRESS
It would be ungenerous of me to close this History without most heartily
thanking the Press for their invaluable assistance at all times, and in every way
to advance our noble game. Especially are we indebted, for I never failed to
make good use of the papers in keeping ourselves well before the public, and
as members we can all give hearty votes of thanks to writers such as “ Longstop,”
“ Tom Brown,” “ Felix,” “ Mid-On,” “ Observer,” and others, for their able,
unbiassed writings and criticisms, which have done so much to keep the game
prominently before the public.
SECOND ELEVEN
By C. W. Nodrum.
No history of the East Melbourne Cricket Club would be complete without
some reference to the Second Eleven, but in attempting to trace its record one
meets with obstacles at every turn. The Club itself has kept no account of
the Second Eleven’s achievements, and the newspapers have reported the matches
with such meagre detail, and so irregularly, that what scraps of news there are
to be found in newspaper files of the last fifty years, are too disjointed to be
welded into anything like a history. We have still in our midst several men
who have served the Club well and long in its early days, notably Mr. A. E.
Clarke, who played for the Second Eleven in 1861, Mr. W. Riggall, who played
as early as 1865, and Mr. W. W. Gaggin, who started in 1868, and any of these
gentlemen could have done far more justice to the Second Eleven than I, with
my limited experience of a dozen seasons, can hope to.
In the year of our foundation we had no Second Eleven, but in 1861 the


Club was represented by both a First and Second Eleven, and has been ever since.
The latter’s doings, however, have been allowed to pass into obscurity, and all
that remains is that most unsatisfactory of all records —averages. Nevertheless,
a study of these averages is instructive, and proves that our second eleven has
very ably carried out the functions for which it was primarily formed, namely,
to supply the First Eleven with ready-made players. It has, right down through
these fifty years, been the nursery of East Melbourne’s cricket, and the testing
ground of all the unknown talent that has come to us. That these functions
have been ably performed, is proved by the average lists that hang in the
pavilion, which show dozens of names appearing for various periods with the
second eleven, and then passing on in the height of their strength to fill up
the gaps that occur in the first. The Club’s policy at its inception was to draw
its First Eleven players from the junior ranks of the Club. It is the same to-day,
and our cricket record for fifty years stands as ample proof of the soundness
of that policy. But besides being the training ground for first elevens, the second
also caters for another class of cricketer —men of moderate ability, who either
by lack of ambition or the demands of business, do not aspire to first eleven
honours, but who are anxious to play cricket in fairly good company and on
good grounds. They are invariably good clubmen, and are extremely useful to
the side in giving it stability, and adding the necessary maturity to the teams
which always contain a fair proportion of young players.
At one time or another the names of many men occur in. our Second Eleven
records who have since made their mark either as cricketers, or in the more
serious walks of life. As mentioned before, the Club’s present Patron, Mr.
A. E. Clarke, played in 1861, and was second in the batting average of that
year. W. Riggall started his cricket with us in 1865, and in that season he
had the winning batting average of 20.1 runs per innings. He was an ardent
and enthusiastic cricketer, who served the Club ably in the field for many years,
and is one of its vice-presidents to-day. With Dan Wilkie, O. C. Williams,
and others, Mr. Riggall took delight in imparting instruction to younger players
at the nets during the seventies, and helped to earn for the Club the title of
“ the Nursery of Cricket.” D. Carson played with the Second Eleven in the early
sixties and continued for many years. Nearly forty years later he was a member
of the Committee. His home is in Queensland now, but when he comes to
Melbourne he never forgets the old ground.
Another notable player of the sixties was W. Campbell, who afterwards
developed into one of the best batsmen in the colony. He was so attached to
the Second Eleven that it was with the greatest difficulty that he was persuaded
to play for the First. Campbell was one of the most correct and stylish batsmen
of his day, and played some valuable innings in intercolonial cricket
A famous East Melbournite started his cricket with the Second Eleven in
1867, in the person of L. Goldsmith. He topped the batting average that season,
but his ability was too great for the Second Eleven to retain him long, and he
became a first eleven man. Another famous old Jolimonter, W. W. Gaggin,
commenced in the same year. He played with both First and Second Elevens
that season, and has remained a faithful East Melbournite during the forty-three
years that have intervened. C. Forrester, the present Honorary Treasurer of
the Melbourne Cricket Club, commenced his cricket with our Second Eleven in
1868. and did yeoman service for seven years, when the First took him. His
record is a fine one. He won the batting average in 1868-9, the bowling in the


following year, and the batting again in 1871-2. J. Healy started in 1873, and
still practices at the nets. His first notable success was in 1876, when he topped
the batting with the fine average of 35. The First Eleven, however, soon took
advantage of his wicket-keeping talents, and he went the way of all good second
players. The Club indeed found an enthusiastic worker in Mr. Healy that year.
His energy has never relaxed, and he is to-day one of the Club’s most hard-work-
ing Committeemen. V. B. Trapp came along in 1877, and won'the batting average
in his first year.
The golden days of the Second Eleven were the seventies. The team was
so strong at one time that it challenged the first to play for a dinner, but
no dates were available and the match fell through. In addition to the names
mentioned, old players of the period love to talk of others of their favourites.
Of Fred Lineker, who was such an energetic fieldsman, and the terror of all
wicket-keepers because of his shot-like returns at short range; of Hugh Kyte,
familiarly known as “ Bella ”; of Maurice Blackburn, jovial, dark-featured, and
burly, fond of the game and always ready for a quencher on a hot afternoon;
of George and Jim Wilkie, brothers of the better known Dan, and of Fred.
Marsden, whose classically cut features and distinguished mien earned him the
nickname of the “ Count.” These were some of the men that went to make
up the might of East Melbourne’s great teams of the seventies.
A name well known in legal and athletic circles is that of Geo. Moir, who
was the team’s best batsman in 1883-4. In the same year J. A. Bruce com-
menced a connection with the Second Eleven, which lasted twenty-four years,
and which makes him the most noteworthy figure in the history of the Second
Eleven. He did not play uninterruptedly with the team, because his abilities
made him frequently in demand for first-grade matches, but the great bulk of
his cricket was second eleven cricket, and it is as a second eleven cricketer that
East Melbourne will remember him. For the greater part of his time, J. A.
Bruce was captain of the team, a position for which his good judgment and
ripe experience entirely fitted him. He was at all times a sound and finished
batsman, but was at his best in a crisis, and it is safe to assert that no batsman
at East Melbourne has turned the game to his side’s advantage oftener than
Bruce. Good change bowling, and energetic, lively fielding, made up the
cricket qualifications of East Melbourne’s most prominent second eleven cricketer,
and it must be added that no fairer or more honourable player than “ Jimmie ”
Bruce ever played the game.
Three years later came R. F. Steel, another player who served us long and
well. He was a splendid batsman, and headed the averages in 1890-1, 1890-2, and
1892-3. Frank Laver appeared as a Second Eleven player in 1887-8, but his
talents were too obvious, and he played only two innings. E. B. Manning was
in the team in 1888, and E. Healy started two years later. In that year (1890)
the Second Eleven records are honoured with the name of H. F. Boyle. His is,
perhaps, the most illustrious cricket name that appears amongst our records.
Boyle was at this time about fifty years of age, and it is a striking testimony of
his devotion to cricket that, with such a great career behind him, he was content
to eventually go down to second eleven cricket rather than give up the game.
The “nineties ” were prolific in players who have left their mark. P. Lyons
started in 1894, and bowled consistently year after year. J. Hewlett came the
next season, and won both batting and bowling average in his first year. J. G.
Thompson, big, genial Jack, first played with the Second Eleven in 1896, and


stuck to it for ten years. He was a bowler far above the average of second
eleven ability, and more than one first eleven of other clubs tried to tempt him
away. E. Barry started in 1897. He was not considered much of a bowler at
first, but he soon developed the enormous breaks that made his bowling quite a
curiosity. It was no uncommon thing to see him bowl a man round his legs, and
many a batsman has drawn back from a ball apparently too wide on the off side
to play, only to see it come back and take his wicket. Barry completely mastered
the art of concealing his delivery, and on his day there were few better bowlers
about.
The most promising young batsman that ever passed through our Second
Eleven was the late Val. Thompson. He started in 1897, but passed into the
First Eleven in the same season. His batting average with the Second was 145,
and for the First he had the remarkably good average of 58, being beaten for
first place by one run, by Frank Laver. His light-hearted, sunny disposition
endeared him to every member of the Club, and his sudden death, in the very
midst of his youth and strength, caused the greatest grief. East Melbourne
lost, in Val. Thompson, a brilliant batsman, who was sure to have made his
mark in big cricket. He had all the advantages —youth, great height, a quick eye,
a finished style, and a modest disposition. A year after Val. Thompson we got
another good colt —Fred. Collins. He won the bowling average in his only season
with the Second Eleven. The incidents relating to his first game with East
Melbourne are worth recording. Collins came to the ground quite unknown, and
the First, Second and Third Elevens for the following Saturday had already
been chosen. It was soon apparent he could bowl, and the attention of the
Fourth Eleven was called to him, but they did not think him sufficiently good to
justify a place in their team. F. S. Hilcke was Second Eleven secretary at the
time, and, rather than let Collins go without a game, he got a Third Eleven player
to stand down in his favour. The result was immediate. Collins mowed down
his opponents, and was very soon promoted to the Second Eleven, and within
two years of his first game with the Club he was in interstate cricket.
Arthur Christian played in 1897, but his all-round abilities swept him on to
First Eleven and interstate cricket. In 1901-2, Gerald Healy, a son of J. Healy,
played, and the Second Eleven thus had a player in the second generation. Gerald
went one better than his father, and won the batting in his first year, averaging
47.30, and the next year 63.71, and again in 1904-5, with 66.5. His cricket with
East Melbourne was certainly phenomenal. He started with the Fourth Eleven,
and won the batting average; passed into the Third Eleven and did likewise;
repeated the dose on the Second Eleven three times, and on the First Eleven
once. After having worked from the lowest team in the Club to the highest, he
was compelled to leave us by the laws of district cricket. Another instance of
father and son, in their turn, playing for the Second Eleven, is that of C. Pinnock,
who played in 1864-5, and his son about forty years later. From 1895 to 1905
the Second Eleven had a succession of powerful teams, but the laws of district
cricket completely broke up the side in 1906. Half of our Second Eleven players
went into the first elevens of their district teams when the new rules compelled
them to leave East Melbourne. We had playing then Harold Dawson, an English-
man, who was a splendid batsman. For a man of his weight he was remarkably
quick on his feet, and a very hard hitter. Dawson died in Africa in 1909. H.
M. Adams was also at that time a terror to second eleven bowlers, and a forcing
partnership with Dawson was worth going a long way to see. E. Barry, A. P.
I


Officer, J. Ramsden, P. Lyons, Arnold Seitz, J. Thompson, T. and G. Healy, J.
A. Bruce, G. Horsburgh and H. Vollugi are all sterling cricketers, who played
with the Second Eleven before the dark days of the coming of district cricket.
The first couple of seasons immediately following the introduction of district
cricket saw our Second Eleven at the lowest ebb it has ever reached. The effect
of the new scheme on second elevens was peculiar. The ten old associated clubs
were so strong in players that they could each put two powerful teams in the
field, and both first and second elevens played good cricket. The new scheme,
however, created a large number of first grade clubs (who naturally drew on the
old second elevens for many of their players), and a still larger number of
second grade clubs, who had to fill up their depleted ranks, and form new sides,
from third-rate teams, with the result that the status of second-eleven cricket
declined tremendously. East Melbourne found it a matter of the greatest
difficulty to get a sufficient number of qualified players to make up a team.
Matters, however, are mending now, and our prospects are brighter. We have
players like E. L. Carroll, S. Strutt, A. Walsh and H. A. Vollugi forming the
backbone of a good side, and our Second Eleven cricket is rising again in quality.
The Second Eleyen has at various times been rendered yeoman service by
players who have had to stand out of the First on account of an overplus of
talent, but these are really First Eleven men, and are, dealt with elsewhere in
this book. Alf. Carter is such a player. He has worked hard in a great many
Second Eleven matches, and yet it is difficult to consider him a Second Eleven
man.
The greatest disadvantage that second elevens suffer, arises out of the very
reason of their existence. It is the continual changing of the team. In a club
strong in interstate players, such as East Melbourne has always been, the second
eleven is continually being called upon to fill up two or three places in the first
eleven while interstate teams are away, and this constant changing militates against
uniform results. Of course, the opportunities thus afforded to second eleven men
are very valuable, and have hastened the promotion of many a player; but the
second eleven premiership list is not always an accurate guide as to the strength of
the competing teams. A club whose first eleven contains no star players does not
need to alter its team, and its second eleven enjoys the great advantage of being
able to play through the whole season with practically the same side. East Mel-
bourne’s Second Eleven has, in this way, long paid the penalty of the Club’s
greatness. May the necessity ever continue.
Most players who have had a few years of second eleven cricket, leave it
with regret, even though personal ambition be gratified by promotion. The
matches are not such a serious business as first eleven cricket, and the result is
not so important; but what the games lose in importance they make up in
enjoyment. I do not mean to say that second eleven cricket is not keen cricket,
but it is less responsible than the higher grade, and the joy of the game increases.
A retrospect of my own connection with East Melbourne’s Second Eleven
cricket, and I have had my fair share, brings back to me nothing but the thoughts
of golden happy days spent with jovial companions, of good-natured banter and
friendly rivalry, of many a victory gloriously fought for, and many a disappoint-
ting defeat. Some of us owe cricket a great debt.


THE “OLD TIMES”
By W. E. Parry-Okeden.
1857-1860.
Melbourne, May, nth, 1910.
In response to your request, I now jot down such incidents as I can recall
to memory of “ old times,” when I was, as you put it, “an active member of the
E.M.C.C.”
I consider that any history of the Club, to be accurate, must embrace a short
recountal of the early days, when the Abbotsford Cricket Club earned the ashes
from which, Phoenix-like, sprang the E.M.C.C., to play a brilliant part the world
over, in keeping in Australia the coveted “ ashes ” of international cricket.
The Abbotsford Cricket Club was a name adopted by a few young cricketing
enthusiasts, who banded together in 1857, to play the game whenever and wherever
they got a chance. They had no rules, no books, no ground, and only a meagre
outfit. If they played “at home,” they played in Bight’s Paddock, at Abbotsford;
afterwards, in the “ Government Paddock,” on the flat at the back, and a little
to the left of the entrance to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.' Just over the hill
is the Richmond ground, where Jack Huddlestone used to do some mighty hitting.
After my school cricket days I used to play at South Yarra and elsewhere,
with Donald and Jim Wallace, W. Haines and his brother, George O’Mullane and
his brother, Verney Cameron, Frank Murphy, Vessy Crown, and Jack Conway;
the last four had been in school teams with me; and, later, most of us joined the
Abbotsfords. I do not know if you have any accounts of their early doings in
the field ? The first match that I have a record of, in which I played for Abbots-
ford, was against the “ Williamstown Alliance ” team, in the Government Pad-
dock, and we played the Royal Park match later on. It will interest, and may
be useful to you, to have particulars of teams of your old friends, who “ played
up ” creditably over 50 years ago. Those were the days when Bulli and Merri
Creek soils had not been worked into the scheme of defence; when surprise
pitches so consistently favoured the attack, as to furnish defenders with a reper-
toire of excuses of such infinite variety that, as a rule, even regular makers of
“ ducks ” and “ spectacles ” were invincible when assailed with contumely for
the monotony of their contributions to the score. I have always felt that I
supplied the exception that proved the rule in this connection, when I explained
to Winfield Attenborough, solicitor, to whom I was articled, that my black eye
was caused by a cricket ball bumping off a bad pitch. A true story of the first
ball, bowled by F. Moody, to celebrate our getting possession of the E.M.C.C.
Ground.
Our teams were but a lot of “colts,” companionable in their relations, always
happy, generally successful in their matches, and full of enthusiasm. You will
recall, as I do, many little impromptu suppers after victories, held at Spiers and
Pond’s Cafe de Paris. What prodigious cricket we used to play THERE!
It was in the air! I wonder if that was when the cricket microbe entered into
Spiers and Pond, and stirred them so that they had to bring out an English
team later on? If so, here is another triumph for the old Club, and what about
that great “ congratulatory supper and social,” held nine years ago, at the Cafe


Denat, to celebrate the establishment of a world's record of averages by the
E.M.C.C. ? Although I was in Queensland, I had the satisfaction of getting a
letter to you in time to be read at the gathering, and of otherwise contributing
to the jubilations.
All its triumphs, great and many as they have been, under your excellent
and, so far as I know, unparalleled regime, were not too many to count as a
glorious tribute to the patient, unselfish, enduring work of the founder of the
Club. He it was who, in 1857, recruited the little band of “ young enthusiasts ”
I have mentioned, and he it was who took the first step towards regularising the
Abbotsford Club’s proceedings. He called the first meeting at the beginning of
the 1859 season. Rules were then adopted, and a resolution passed that minute
books should be kept. From the general minute book, which you have allowed
me to see, I find that J. O. Moody was a fortnight later (22nd September) elected
President, and a Committee was formed.
At the meeting, Bth December, 1859, you represented me by proxy, and you
moved and carried (W. H. Freame, seconder) the appointment of a Land Com-
mittee, “ for the purpose of purchasing, or obtaining, a piece of land for the
Club.” Dight, Freame and Wilkinson were elected.
At the next meeting (12th January, i 860), Freame proposed, and I seconded,
“ That a petition be sent to Captain Lonsdale’s agent for use of paddock.” This
was carried, and I was elected a member of the Land- Committee, vice Freame,
resigned. You and I were elected to be auditors of the books of the Club. At
the close of the 1859-60 season, it was resolved to hold a Club dinner, to celebrate
its success in the cricket field. The First Eleven played 10 matches, won 6, drew
4, lost none. The Second Eleven played 8, won 3, drew 3, lost 2. The dinner
was held in the M.C.C. pavilion, on the nth of May, iB6O. Jerry Bryant catered;
W. J. Hammersley was a guest; 23 sat down to dinner; and I occupied the Vice-
Chair ! Fifty years ago to-day!
The first general meeting of the Abbotsford Cricket Club for the 1860-1
season was held on 6th September; J. O. Moody elected President; you, Secre-
tary; J. Wilkinson, Treasurer; Freame and King elected to complete the Com-
mittee of five. The Committee was deputed to draw up rules for next meeting.
At the next meeting, held November Ist, iB6O, the President, with the other five
members of the Committee, being “ present,”—“ The rules, as brought forward by
the Committee, were adopted, which changed the name from Abbotsford to East
Melbourne Cricket Club.” This important step had been decided on as means
to secure an increased membership roll, and to enlist extended public interest;
both valuable considerations in relation to the acquisition and improvement of
the new ground. In order, therefore, that no delay should occur in official effect
being given to the change, the meeting provisionally enlarged the Committee, E.
A. Fawcett and C. O. Barrass being added to it. This action, in effect, at once
produced somewhat altered conditions, touching the constitution of the meeting.
Mr. J. O. Moody considered it to be incompatible with his taking any further part
in the proceedings as President of the Abbotsford C.C., and Mr. E. A. Fawcett,
the newly elected Committeeman, carried on and wound up the meeting, signing
the minutes as, “ Chairman for the time being.”
So was constructed the funeral pyre of old “ Abbotsford.” Only by con-
vening a general meeting under the new name provided for in the Rules that
had been adopted could the destruction of this pyre be consummated, so that the
old Club might rise from the ashes to newness of life as the “ East Melbourne


Cricket Club.” The next meeting was, accordingly, convened for the 27th Decem-
ber, iB6O, and was styled, “ General meeting of the East Melbourne Cricket Club.”
It was held on the above date, at the Parade Hotel, Richmond Road, kept
by Jerry Bryant, “ Mr. E. A. Fawcett in the chair.” Mr. W. E. P. Okeden was
elected President, on the nomination of Mr. King, seconded by Mr. Clarke. A
cordial vote of thanks was passed to Mr. J. O. Moody, the late President, and
as he was not present, it was to be “ conveyed ” to him.
The last minute of the meeting is unique, and, withal, interesting, in its
relation to the present East Melbourne grounds. It reads; “ That it be left to
the Committee of the Club to decide whether or not the Club shall allow its name
to be used in conjunction with an inaugural fete proposed to be holden on the
new ground,” the carrying out of which was left to the following gentlemen, who
at once formed themselves into a committee for the purpose, viz., Messrs. Okeden,
Fawcett, Clarke, Barrass, King, Wilkinson, Moule, H. Stephen and Hurst.
So ended the official proceedings attendant upon the birth of the E.M.C.C.
In writing of this meeting I thought it best to depart from the rule previously
observed, of writing to you in the first person.
Well do I remember, during the 1859 season, being with you and Edmund
Fawcett, in Elizabeth Street, and your interesting me in a scheme for procuring
a ground for Abbotsford. This, I take it, was why you provided yourself with
my proxy for the meeting, at which you took the first step to that end, and which
I furthered at the next meeting, by seconding Freame’s motion for a petition to
secure Captain Lonsdale’s paddock, and by being elected to the Land Committee,
appointed previously, on resolution moved by you.
During recent visits to the E.M.C.C. Ground, to see the last match of the
cricket season, and the opening game of the football one, I was impressed with
the extent to which public patronage is bestowed. Truly have you deserved public
recognition for the manner in which you stuck to, and carried through, the work
incidental to the acquisition and making of a playground that has been, for fully
fifty years, a great public boon.
That old minute book of general meetings has been, to my mind, a veritable
mirror of the past; and, as I turned its leaves, I alternated between happy
recollections of associations and incidents of those olden days when the
sands of time ran slow; and saddening reflections that nearly all my old cricketing
mates have departed. But, though I can find, despite my sadness, much pleasure
in retrospective thought of my youthful days in the cricket fields round Mel-
bourne, I have assured myself, by recent experiences, that rambling round the
grounds is not the happiest method of celebrating a jubilee return to them. Not
alone is this accounted for by sad reflections and old associations; old identities and
celebrities have commingled their dust with the dust of years, and now only people
the old haunts with such shades as fancy may call up'. But rather is it engendered
by a keen feeling of loneliness among the living, caused by discovering oneself
to be such a way-back number that, even on the old grounds, one may sit for hours
under the pavilion verandahs, surrounded by joyous onlookers, many of whom
are reported to be “ old identities,” and yet not one to greet or speak to. Cricket,
the king of games, to my mind, more than any other, fosters a spirit of camara-
derie, and the joy of watching good cricket, with a congenial companion, who
knows the game, is untold.
; Yours very faithfully,
W. E. PARRY-OKEDEN.


REMINISCENCES
By O. C. Williams.
1868-1875.
I have very great pleasure, at Mr. Alfred Clarke’s request, in assisting him
with his history of the E.M.C.C., for its Jubilee, with my memories of its fortunes
during the very happy years I was an active member of it. The looking backward
has been a delight, and made me live again in those truly good old days of long
ago.
I joined it in 1866, as a timid and humble admirer of Geo. O’Mullane, Geo.
Tait, Newton Jacomb, C. Barratt, and other shining lights of those days. The
first annual meeting I attended was held in the old “ London Tavern,” in
Elizabeth Street, and it was adjourned for lack of a. quorum. The ground then
included that portion afterwards ceded to the Government for G. Techow’s
gymnasium, which we surrendered as a sop to Cerberus to strengthen our tenure
of the ground, of which, I believe, I am still one of the Trustees.
The remains of Captain Lonsdale's old Government cottage were still visible
in the vacant lands adjoining. The only protection from the wandering cow or
predatory goat was then a two-railed post and rail fence, with many a tottering
panel in it, too, and Mac Alpine, old Scotch Mac, then our ground-keeper, often
took a top rail in his brawny arms and welted the offending kine across the
ditches, with strong Celtic objurgations.
The pavilion certainly was an improvement on the “ cowshed ” then on the
South Melbourne Ground, and so derided by our captain, Dan. Wilkie, but the
improvement was not conspicuous, an oblong weather-board shell, with just enough
space between the floor and the ground to hide our watering hose away from our
creditors, and to afford a shelter for Mac’s dogs. In a single ro x 6 lean-to, in
the rear, Mac snored by night, and talked Gaelic or bad French by day; and
many a pipe was smoked in that lean-to on Sunday mornings and wet afternoons
by him and Donald Campbell, Gaggin and others, who enjoyed drawing him out
with his broad Doric.
There was a small forest of old gums between the Richmond Road and
our two-rail fence in those days, and some six or seven old giants were in the
ground itself, in the north-west corner, close where our practice wickets were
usually pitched. They were good wickets, too, and with only a single net behind.
We had the rule of five minutes’ grace, and out when you get out thereafter, in
those days, and before the five minutes were up the batsman slogged as he liked,
and the bowlers and the field of four or five were listless and at ease. When the
cry of “ Five minutes up!” was sounded, though, everyone was alert, the field and
all, for catching was included, and the quicker the ball was back, the quicker the
batsman might be got out, and the next man’s turn come. That system had much
to do with the reputation the East always had for fielding, and it improved the
batting, too.
On Thursday afternoons, moreover, a match wicket used to be made out
on the playing ground, and the First Eleven fielded against all-comers, who were
expected to make their game as much “ tip and run ” as possible. Those Thurs


day afternoon practices were not kept to as much as they should have been, still,
they did good. ■
There was no boundary chain or fence in those long agos. Every hit was
run out; and many a batsman, after running a four or five, and at times a sixer,
at top speed, has had to meet the next ball from a cool and revengeful bowler,
while his own condition was anything but cool, his sight dancing, and his lungs
gasping for wind. An innings of 50, in those days, was equal to one of 100
now.
Those wickets of ours were the pride of MacAlpme, and our pride, too.
They were the best in the colony, unapproached until the later “ seventies.” We
got our top-dressing from the Merri Creek, out Northcote way, and we had the
monopoly of it for a good many years, Rowley, of the M.C.C., vainly trying to
get a share of it. Later on, even the Sydney cricket grounds used to get it from
there too, brought up as ballast, and they only stopped getting it when Phil.
Sheridan discovered the now famous Bulli soil.
The dandelion was a great pest on the ground in the old days, and old-time
members, Gaggin and myself and others, often helped Mac. pick them out of
the playing ground with our pocket-knives, kneeling on sacking; and men were
also employed to do the same at times. We had two rollers, a big iron one, for
a horse, and a little solid stone one, with which Mac. always “ topped off ” his
wickets.’ I remember those rollers well, so often have I helped to pull or push
them up and down between the wickets, and the chaff and jokes we interchanged
and cracked.
Scotch Mac. got married, and soon after left us to better himself, and we got
another “ Mac.,” an Irish one this time, Macauley, and a treasure he proved, and
a character he was. He is the East Melbourne “ Mac.,” that this generation
remembers. He was an artist in making wickets, and no better man ever stepped
straight, honest, hard-working, and kind-hearted to all. He had an affection
for “ tarriers,” and kept several. “ Them blamed weeds ” on the ground were
his pet aversion.
I think J. McPherson, or J. Phillips, was Hon. Secretary when I joined, in
’66, and the Committee meetings were held in Alfred Clarke’s office, at the corner
of Little Collins and Elizabeth Streets. I have sat many times, first as Committee-
man, then for several years as Secretary, and finally as Vice-President, in that
little room, and we never troubled about quorums at our meetings, for, before
the Challenge Cup was started, we seldom could get them.
It was J. Ballantyne who persuaded me to go on the Committee. I was very
much in earnest, and never missed any of the meetings. The public interest in
cricket in the late “ sixties ” was but small, and members’ subscriptions were the
clubs’ sole source of revenue. We had the best wickets and a strong team;
our muster roll was small, but all were young and keen players, and our fielding
as a team was the best in the colony; but funds were very low. Our watering
hose was more than once seized for unpaid rates, and our roller once got to
Stubbs’ auction-room, for sale under distress. I well remember going round with
the hat for subs, to save it, and riding in the dray that towed it back home again.
I think that was in my first year as Hon. Secretary, and how I took that post was
thiswise. Things were going from bad to worse financially and Alfred Clarke
and I were at times the only ones who turned up at Committee meetings. Before
’67-68 season began, Clarke said to me, “ Look here, Williams, we can’t go on like
this. If you’ll take the Secretaryship, I’ll be Treasurer.” He had been President


perpetual hitherto, but now said, “ We’ll got Edward Cohen to be President, and
see if a new deal won’t improve matters.” Cohen was member for East Mel-
bourne, and his influence might help us in our tenure of the ground.
So I started, things being at the ebb I have above stated. A circular was
sent to members, who numbered 42 only, making a call of 10/- a head, and saying
that, unless it was responded to, the matches arranged would be cancelled, and
the ground closed at Christmas-time. Herbert Henty was the President who
signed the circular, and it helped to tide us over that season. Edward Cohen
came later.
We tried getting up concerts to aid our empty Treasury, and two of those
efforts stand clear in my memory. Clarke used to provide the music, and the
rest of us sold the tickets. One was given in the Haymarket Theatre, where
Paddy’s Market now stands, and the house was filled with our victims. I sold
£sl worth of dress circle tickets. My friends and acquaintances used to avoid
me like the pestilence. The concert came off, but the only things worth listening
to were the pieces played by the Garrison Band. The rest were so bad that
Clarke slunk along back streets for months after, ashamed to look his musical
friends in the face, and the theatre burnt itself down afterwards —no wonder!
The other memory is of a concert we got up in Hockin’s Rooms, in Elizabeth
Street, and a certain well-known and famous Melbourne musician was to play
the opening piece. He was a man of many parts, and had been practising one
of them rather freely prior to the entertainment. David Lee was our conductor,
and he and Clarke and I waited on the pavement below in agonies of apprehension
as the minutes went by, and the impatience of the audience upstairs was being
expressed in the usual way, and crescendo-ing. Presently a cab stopped, and in
it the huddled-up form of our friend was seen. Clarke and I were in despair,
but David Lee was equal to the occasion. Seizing one arm, he told Clarke to
take the other, and me to push behind, and so we got him up those long stairs,
and thence, behind a screen of the other performers, on to the music-stool.
Directly his fingers felt the keyboard, he was right as rain, and both Lee and
Clarke declared he never played better in his life.
We would make £3O or £4O by these entertainments, a poor return for the
time, labour and energy we expended, but the receipts tided us over our difficul-
ties from time to time. We could play all right. The harder-up the Club got, the
better we seemed to play. In ’7O and ’73, we made seven out of the eleven in
the Victorian teams against Tasmania.
It is but right to say here what all old Jolimonters will remember, that in
those days of small things, Alfred Clarke was the “ Deus ex Machina ” to the
Club, He did everything for it but play; his interest in it was consuming, and
his energy unceasing. It was impossible to tire him. His hand was often in his
pocket to help our weak finances, and he was practically the father of the Club in
those days.
I was only in the Second then, but that Second Eleven was the best in Mel-
bourne, a very hot Second, with Donald Campbell, Riggall, W. McEvoy, C.
Forrester, J. Egglestone, J. Moodie, Carr, J. and Geo. Wilkie, “ Bella ” Kyte,
Tom Hepburn, Jennings, J. Fisher, C. G. Alice, J. Stewart, S. Willis, and Shaw
in it, and we were all as keen, perhaps keener, than the First Eleven fellows. I
always considered our Second Eleven was the main source of the Club’s strength,
and the Club fostered it, and the Third Eleven, too, so much so that the E.M.C.C.
used to be called the “ nursery of cricket.” We acted on the principle of looking


well after the Second Eleven, and letting the First look after itself. I never
had any trouble with the First. Dave Wilkie, Tom Flepburn and Willie Campbell
were a bit casual at times in turning up, that was all.
Dave was our best fast bowler, and with a very graceful style. Ffe was also
very easy and graceful in the field, and once excused himself for not chasing a
ball in the out-held by swearing at a white calf which was browsing in that direc-
tion, and declaring that he mistook it for a fieldsman. “ What the devil does it
get itself up in white for?”
The Club struggled on through the next two seasons, and its member-roll
grew, our arrangement for the admission of Scotch College boys helping in that
respect; but the public interest was still flat, until the Challenge Cup was started,
and this is how that came about. Riggall and I used to spend our Sundays in
whole day walks about the rural suburbs of Melbourne (we kept it up for three
years, never missing a Sunday), and one Sunday evening, returning home through
Malvern, we called in on Alfred Clarke for tea, at “ Coldblo’,” and we talked
cricket, as we always did. The moribund condition of public interest in the
game, and lack of support, were discussed and deplored; and Clarke suggested
trying to arouse it by starting another cup for club competition. He had not
much hope of its success, after the failure of the Coppin Cup, in the early
“sixties,” to revive interest, but we three resolved to try it, and I remember
drawing up a skeleton set of rules there and then, before we left, in Clarke’s
dining-room. I saw Handfield next day, and, though he was' sceptical, I got him
to call a meeting of the clubs in the old M.C.C. pavilion, and to make the
proposal as from the M.C.C. It was finally agreed to by all present, not very
enthusiastically, as, though all agreed something must be done, the cup, as a
means, was adopted only “ faute de mieux.” This was in 1870.
Little did we know how much better we builded than we knew. That cup
was destined to be the foundation from which the First Australian Eleven to
England sprung. It is not necessary to say here what the matches for it did
for cricket in Victoria —all that is fitting here is about the part the E.M.C.C., the
Jolimonters, had in those Homeric contests, the matches and the men. The
feature that stands always strongest in my memory of those contests is the spirit
in which they were played. Melbourne South, and Melbourne East, and Mel-
bourne pure and Simple, were the Titans in the struggle, Handfield, Runting and
myself the contending secretaries; and though the rivalry ran often to a heat
that threatened to burst the thermometer, the personal friendship and feeling
between us, and between all the players of those three Clubs, were increased and
cemented by those matches. The three clubs were wonderfully even in playing
strength, and this was the main reason why the public interest became excited,
and was it not excited! There was but little business done “ under the verandah ”
in Collins Street, on Saturday mornings, in the cricket season, in those days. The
cup match of the afternoon was all engrossing, and every player in the contending
teams a public character, and his “ form ” discussed. Each club had its hundreds
of partisans, and some of the “ barrackers ” went rather far at times; I well
remember occasions when the public blamed the cup matches for scenes and acts
the “ barrackers ” were solely responsible for. The players themselves certainly
never had any part in them, and, for their opponents, always respect and personal
regard. We lived in the days of those cup matches, our eyes clear, our feet quick,
our hands sure, and our hearts thumping under our ribs all the season through,


and so the best of us came out to one another. There was no thought of spite or
malice; we had no time for it.
I remember when cricket was in the doldrums, in the “ sixties,’ the feeling
between the Melbourne and East Melbourne Clubs was not too cousinly, and
although a better understanding was growing up before the cup was started, it
was the latter that brought about that brotherhood and mutual regard that was
so delightful, and is now so pleasant to look back upon.
Many will remember the dinner at Carton’s the night following our great
victory over South Melbourne, on the Hill, when Wardill and Kelly and Verney
Cameron and Butler and the Loughnans and others all rolled up and helped
to celebrate the occasion. I remember how Clarke and I and Mrs. Clarke and
our team left the Hill that day, and how Austin Loughnan saved me, and the
cup in my arms, from obliteration, with a straight left under the chin of a savage
Hooligan of the Hill.
Those Melbourne matches were always a keen pleasure to me. How Dan.
Wilkie and Wardill and Verney Cameron chaffed one another, and bet hats!
And Gaggin and Alice girded and gibed with Gibson, “ Thakambau, as he was
called. He it was who first introduced tea on the ground as a drink for the
players, and they used to roast him properly about it, and his pick handle, too.
Forrester, Wyndham, the Loughnans, and “ Snipe ” Jennings joined in jokes and
horse-play, and Jos. Pickersgill made fun for both sides in the pavilion. I think
Riggall and Horan and I were the staidest of the teams; though I relapsed on
occasion, the “ Lost Ball Match,” for instance.
I remember that “ Lost Ball Match,” and Goldsmith’s oft-reported misadven-
ture, and the Tom Brown-Paul Jones paper controversy, E.M.C.C. v. M.C.C.; It
never made any difference in the personal feeling between the teams; Charlie Alice
always kept us alive, and though I once threatened to cut his throat with a cheese
knife, for missing Willie Ford at the wickets so often, he forgave me on the spot
and missed him again? What a match that was, and what a fine stamp of men
played the game in those days; what good comrades they were! All I have
named, Second Eleven fellows, who, like myself, became First, and Willie Darke
and Willie Campbell, and Peryman and Fred. Marsden, Horan and Boyle, and
Hastings, who came later, and what a skipper Dan. Wilkie was! Boyle was good,
too, but not so many-sided as Wilkie. I have often longed for an over or two
of Dan. Wilkie’s slows, with the East Melbourne team behind him, and believe
they would be effective among the fast-footed batsmen of to-day. In the old
days, I often twitted “ Longstop,” of the “ Australasian,” with being “ laudator
temporis acti.” I am one myself now!
The Clubs we played in the late “ sixties ” and early “ seventies were
M.C.C., South Melbourne, Richmond, Carlton, Collingwood, Commercial, Fitzroy,
Hotham, and Williarnstown, with occasional trips to Ballarat and Geelong (Corio
C.C.), and the players who in memory come to me include Frank Allan (the
bowler of a century), McGan (the slow bowler of the Hill), Wheatley, Heather,
Blair, Osborne, Yuille and Chessel, of South Melbourne; Conway, Mor-
timer, and the Johnsons, of Richmond; Bishop, Horan, Blackham, the James s, and
the McFarlands, of Carlton, and that Club’s two chief supporters, Dedman and
Craven; Whiteoak, Ballard and Gay, of Collingwood Commercial; Healey, of
Hotham - Dan. Sweeney, the Figgises, Cazaly and Brokenshire, of Ballarat; and
then our’ dearest foes of all, the M.C.C. men, Wills, Wardill, B. B. Cooper, V.
Cameron. Kelly, Gibson, Phillips, the Loughnans, and the “old horse,” Sam


Cosstick. It’s good to recall the names of these doers in the days of long ago
they were doers, all of them.
Our own First Eleven changed but little in the years of those cup contests.
Gaggin and Goldsmith, the two “ G’s,” always went in first, and an ideal pair
they were, diverse in style, Gaggin cool and steady as a rock, playing his eye in,
giving a feeling of comfortable confidence to our friends; the brilliant and supple
Goldsmith as likely as not to hit a fourer first ball, and the first batsman I can
remember to defy old-fashioned laws, and play the pull on purpose. I well
remember his pulling Frank Allan from the off and middle to square leg, for
4, on the S.M. Ground, in a cup match, and Allan throwing up his arms in
despair, crying, “Call that cricket!” Willie Campbell, the prettiest batsman
of our time, went in first wicket down; then Horan, the soundest bat we ever
had, and always the hope of the team for a big score; then Boyle, that good
bat and run-getter and great bowler, and one of the best and most agile fields
I ever saw; and Dan. Wilkie, the best underhand slow bowler Australia has
seen, and a batsman who usually got runs when others failed; C. Forrester, our
lion hitter; Elliott, our little wicket-keeper: Darke and Searcey, our bowlers;
Hastings, the pendulum batsman; Riggall, C. Carr, Peryman, Jennings, our left-
hander ; and C. G. Allee, a lively, dangerous batsman, unsurpassed in the field,
one of our best bowlers, and a change wicket-keeper.
We did not turn out “star” bowlers at Jolimont, and never a first-class wicket-
keeper, but batting and fielding we shone in, in my day, and they were good
enough to keep us in the front.
The E.M.C.C. was the first to send teams into the country at holiday times,
and the first of these visits I arranged through J. B. Docker, of “ Bontharambo,”
Wangaratta, to play 15 of the N.E. District, at Wangaratta, during the Easter
of 1873. I do not suppose any who took part in that trip, or in the one that fol-
lowed it at the same time next year, will ever forget them. So enjoyable and
successful were they that the other clubs followed the example, and holiday tour-
ing cricket trips became certain fixtures among the city clubs.
Save for visits to Geelong, or Ballarat, or Bendigo, metropolitan teams had
not gone afield before, and saving teams from those places, no country clubs had
visited Melbourne. The Jolimonters were the first to break the new ground, and
also the first to get the united country team to town. In 1871, the 18 picked from
all over Victoria played the E.M.C.C. on the latter’s ground.
These country visits showed the town players that there was unexpected
talent in the country, and when I was asked by the leading clubs to choose the
Colts’ team, of ’7l, and of ’72 also, I drew largely on the country, and Wardill,
captain of the M.C.C., wondered why on earth I did so, saying, “ They are all
very well on the rough grounds up country, but when they come to town and
play on turf, they take off their boots, leaving them anywhere about on the ground,
and field in their socks. They run into one another in the field, and are not worth
a run at the wickets.” I smiled, and told him that two I had picked in the ’7l lot
would be in the Victorian Eleven next season, and they were. Boyle and Mid-
winter—and the Colts won the match, too. It was, as usual, against the M.C.C.
First Eleven. I also picked Horan and Blackham in that year’s team; the ’72
team had no such stars as these four, though. I have been a bit proud of that
quartette!
V’ith the advent of the cup matches, and the letting of the ground for foot-
ball, the clouds of finance began to roll by. We had as manv as 12,000 people


at a cup match, and football paid us well. We put a high fence round the ground,
raised the pavilion and enlarged it, with steps and seats at the front, about 1872.
We were also able to adorn the pavilion walls with photographs of the founders
and early members of the Club, and with framed yearly lists of the matches and
players’ averages from the beginning. What a hunt I had to get those photo-
graphs ; but the work over the annual averages was my “ magnum opus.” I had
to go back to the first, and for some years work out the averages from old scoring
books of past seasons, up to within a year or two of my taking charge, but it
was all a labour of love, and I like to think of those records in rows round the
pavilion now.
I took up the Secretaryship when there were only 42 members, and the Club
on the verge of extinction, and laid it down after six years with a roll of 400 and
odd, an assured financial position, and the possession of the Cup for the season.
Sydney,
18th January, 1910.
THE LATE H. F. BOYLE
By Dave Scott.
Harry Boyle was a cricketer of note in the Bendigo district in the early
“ sixties,” and first played with a Club called the Sydney Flat, some seven miles
from Bendigo. When he joined the Bendigo United Cricket Club he came rapidly
to the front, under the joint coachship of Messrs. W. Bruce and John Glen, two
of the pioneers of the Club. He first came prominently into notice when he
played in the 22 of Bendigo, at Bendigo, against the Victorian Eleven, season
1865-6, a very powerful team, containing such well-known players as Tommy
Wills, George Gibson, J. B. Turner, and the cream of cricket. Boyle bowled
splendidly, and in the match took eight wickets for 20, such a low cost that
Bendigo won by an innings and seven runs. He continued to do well after this,
but it was not until the season of 1871 that he appeared in Melbourne, and he
made his appearance in the Colts’, against a powerful M.C.C. team, which included
Tommy Wills, B. B. Cooper, T. J, D. Kelly, and others. He made top score and
took four wickets. In the same match three other colts appeared that have since
become world-renowned —Tommy Horan, Jack Blackham, and W. Midwinter.
On his return to Bendigo, he still kept well to the front, and his doings were so
brilliant that Mr. Reginald Clarke, brother of Mr. A. E. Clarke, who was then
in Bendigo, wrote to his brother, telling him about the brilliant Bendigonian. He
played for some time after this in Bendigo, and in 1872 he played his first match
for Victoria v. New South Wales, making second highest score, 27, G. Gibson
being top with 41. He did not bowl, as Victoria won in one innings and 26 runs,
Allan and Cosstick bowling throughout, with the exception of a few balls from
Wills.
Mr. A. E. Clarke then made arrangements for Boyle to play for East Mel-
bourne, and he came to Melbourne every Saturday.
He was selected for the 18 of Victoria against W. G. Grace’s famous team,
and made 30 runs in his only innings, and covered himself with glory by being


the first man in Australia to clean bowl the greatest cricketer the world has ever
seen for 33. The shouts that went up from the throats of 20,000 people might
have been heard at the Post Office; his name was on every tongue, and that night,
at the Theatre Royal, the vast audience rose en masse when he came in. and
cheered lustily for five minutes.
Boyle came from Bendigo some days before the match against England, and
was staying with me, and the match was to commence on Boxing Day. On Christ-
mas Day we strolled on the Melbourne Ground, where the amateurs of the English
H. F. BOYLE
team were practising. He watched W. G. Grace carefully, and said to me, “He
has a weak stroke on the leg, and if I could get a ball in between leg and wicket
I think I could get him; if they put me on I will go for that kind of ball”—and
he got him!
Boyle’s father was on the ground the last day of the match, having come
all the way from Bendigo after his son’s performance on the Saturday, and when
a bit of a stand was being made in the second innings of the Englishmen, Boyle
was again called upon to bowl, and some of the barrackers said, “ Now you will


see how ‘ W.G.’ will clout him, and he will never get a wicket.” Old Boyle was
a regular sport, one of the old brigade, and he pulled out a roll of notes, and
said, “ I will bet a ‘ fiver ’ my boy gets two out of the three wickets that are to
fall.” A friend who was with him took him by the arm, and said, “ Mr. Boyle,
they have not a ‘ fiver ’ in a paddock of them; come away.” He laughed and
came away; but he was right about his boy; he took the three wickets.
His average in the match was four wickets for 25. He then went back again
to Bendigo, and captained the 22 Bendigonians against Grace’s team there. He
was at the time book-keeper for W. Bruce, the brewer, and on my pressing advice
he came to Melbourne, and got into a temporary billet, until Mr. A. E. Clarke,
by his influence, got him into the Mines Office, where he remained till 1879,
when he resigned, and started business with me, as Boyle and Scott, so well known
in Melbourne.
From the time he joined E.M.C.C., up to the time of his death, his whole
heart was wrapped up in his Club, and he was one of the proudest men in Mel-
bourne when the East Melbourne Committee made him and his dearest chum and
fellow-player Life Members of the Club.
He played regularly, with but few breaks, in the First Eleven, till 1895, and
even after that. Wherever he was, he still kept up the same interest in the
doings of the Club as when he was an active member.
His deeds in the cricket world are famous, and his first match, at Lords’
Ground, in 1878, when he took six wickets for three runs, when, in conjunction
with Spofforth, they disposed of the famous Marylebone Club for 19, was the
forerunner of Australian cricketers’ success in England. Mr. Boyle remained
a member of the Club, and was always ready with his advice for its welfare till
his death, in 1907, and we feel sure the action of his widow, Mrs. H. F. Boyle,
in donating £3 3s. every year, for the Harry Boyle Trophy, will keep his memory
green for many years to come, even though he has bowled his last ball, made
his last run, and is now waiting for his old comrades in the pavilion of heaven.
THE LATE HARRY BUDD
A history of the East Melbourne Cricket Club would be incomplete without
a reference to the late Mr. Henry Hale Budd, than whom no greater enthusiastic
loyalist for his Club ever existed. His heart and soul, from his earliest connec-
tion with the Club, until his demise, were for “ East,” for “ East ” alone. The
work that he put in on the Club’s behalf, and the money that he spent in the
same interest, would take pages to record, and a capacious purse to fill.
He was Hon. Secretary of the Club for 13 years, and for many years after
his resignation of the position he was a member of Committee, and one of the
Club’s representatives on the Victorian Cricket Association.
If any money was required to help an “ East ” scheme along, if any new
talent could be secured, or if any special leave of absence for a player was
desired, Harry Budd was first in the field to raise the funds, approach the new
player, or to interview the principals necessary to get the required permission;


moreover, his personal powers of persuasion and address seldom failed him in
gaining his end.
As a cricket politician in his Club's interest, he was a hard and determined
fighter, and his optimistic championing of “ East ” made him some bitter enemies
in other Clubs.
Generous to a fault, and the best of good company among his numerous
friends, he, by his fearless expressions of opinion and bluff manner at times
towards strangers and opponents, often made an unfavourable impression.
Anything he considered expedient for the benefit of “ East,” he would go
for “ bald-headed,” and there are only a very few who know the amount of time
and money he expended in the Club's progress, to the detriment of his professional
career as a solicitor.
Harry Budd was all for cricket in outdoor sports; he was always dead
against the introduction of lawn tennis, believing that it might lure some of the
Club’s players away from his favourite game. He was a keen supporter of
skittles, and a fair player at the game.
For many years he took an active interest in meeting J. C. Williamson’s
theatrical team. It was mainly through the social influence of Harry Budd that
Robert Brough, who was subsequently elected a Life Member of the Club, for
his generous assistance, George Titheradge, myself, and other members of the
theatrical profession were introduced to the Jolimont brigade.
For many years Budd worked hand-in-glove with his boyhood’s friend, Mr.
A. E. Clarke, for the Club, and they carried things along with them to a great
extent. A compact was made between them, that in the event of the death of
either of them the survivor should place a sod of the East Melbourne cricket
pitch on the coffin of the deceased. This was religiously carried out at Harry’s
funeral in the Brighton Cemetery.
Harry Budd was ever ready to promote and carry out a benefit, or to help
a friend. When the Bijou Theatre was burnt down he arranged a football
match on the East Melbourne Ground for the benefit of the stage hands and
employees. A sum of over £3OO was raised for them; and he also promoted a
testimonial in sympathy with Messrs. Brough and Boucicault, members of the
Club, and lessees of the ill-fated theatre. Mainly through his exertions, a cheque
for iiooo was handed to those gentlemen.
For years he acted as Hon. Solicitor to the Club, and he was instrumental
in gaining business concessions and privileges for the good of the Club in many
ways.
In short, as a lover of cricket, and a hard-working enthusiast for “ East,”
it would be hard indeed to find one to beat Harry Budd.
Thirteen Years’ Secretaryship at ‘'East”
By E. B. Manning.
Shortly after my arrival from England, in 1886, I became a member of the
E.M.C.C., and during the season I was fortunate enough to witness the record-
score match, “ Smokers v. Non-Smokers,” in which the leading players of the


visiting English team and of Australia took part on the East .Melbourne
Ground. In October, 1888, I was offered, and accepted, the Secretaryship of
the E.M.C.C., to succeed Mr. G. E. Palmer in that position, and at once got into
harness.
Air. A. E. Clarke was President; Mr. R. Richardson, Hon. Treasurer; Mr.
B. J. Davies, Second Eleven Secretary; and Air. H. F. Boyle, Captain. Mr.
Clarke retained his office throughout my time, but there were subsequent Hon.
Treasurers in Messrs. E. Fletcher, Sam. Gatehouse and W. G. Hickford; Second
Eleven Secretaries, in Messrs. W. S. Moore, W. H. Peers, and F. S. Hilcke; and
Captains in Alessrs. G. B. Gordon and Frank Laver. Amongst prominent repre-
sentatives of the Club at the time of my joining were Alessrs. H. Hale Budd,
R. M. (Alel) Eades, H. M. Gooch, Tom Horan, Charley Alice, George Chapman,
W. W. Gaggin, W. J. C. Brown, J. A. (Jimmy) Clark and Jack Healey.
I found that the great desire and hope of the Club was to win the V.C.A.
premiership, and for some years the Committee spared no efforts in that direc-
tion, going to considerable expense in engaging professionals, paying teams’ ex-
penses, luncheons, entertaining public school teams and partisans, arranging a
match for the Ground with Lord Sheffield’s team, and freely introducing new
players of a promising order.
Mr. A. E. Clarke, the President, was exceptionally enthusiastic and generous
in supporting any movement to strengthen the team, and in addition to the money
that he openly expended, I can vouch for a great deal more which he spent in his
endeavours to advance the interests of the Club, unknown to members generally.
I cannot imagine that any more thorough supporter of a cricket club has ever
appeared in Australia than Mr. Clarke.
In addition to First and Second Elevens in the pennant competitions, ano
two Non-Pennant Elevens playing on Saturdays, we had one of two “week-day”
matches during each week, in addition to non-players’ matches, so we kept the
ball a’rollin’ in no humdrum fashion.
Despite these endeavours, the First Eleven failed for some years to obtain
the coveted position, losing at times just when victory appeared to be theirs. The
North Alelbourne team, including Alessrs. Dick Houston, Harry and George
Stuckey, Jack Carlton, Ernest and George Bean, and W. Mapleston, etc., were
our most formidable opponents. Amongst the Club’s professionals in my time
were A. Gray, Tom Flynn, Jack Harry, A. E. Trott, Bob Horne, J. Lyons, etc.,
but it was not until the Club made a clean sweep of professionals altogether,
strange to say, that the success commenced which has continued in such a magnifi-
cent manner ever since.
It was owing to a sudden collapse in cricket and football revenue together
which landed the Club into severe financial responsibility, that the expense of
professionals was dropped. In one year, pennant cricket was such a draw that
the M.C.C., East, and North Melbourne Clubs cleared about £IOO each out of
gate money; since that year I do not think there has been any gate money at all,
and, as I have previously mentioned, football failed the clubs in the same way;
but the latter game has recovered from the temporary check.
The most prominent of East’s players during my early years were Messrs.
Flarry Boyle, Tom Horan, Charley Alice, Jack Worrall, “Jockey” Drysdale, Percy
Lewis, Flarry Musgrove and Charlie Letcher, in addition to the professionals
already mentioned, whilst, later on, two meteors, in Frank Laver and Peter
McAlister, came to the front, and still continue to shine brightly: whilst Sam


McMichael, Val. Thompson, Fred. Collins, Harry Stuckey and H. Wright were
lesser, though most brilliant, cricket constellations. There are many more, but
I cannot enumerate thetn, and must apologise to them accordingly.
I would like to state that, after many years of English and Australian
cricket experience, I consider Jack Harry to have been the best all-round cricketer,
in the four departments of the game, that the world has produced. He was a
first-class batsman, magnificent fieldsman, excellent wicket-keeper, and most useful
bowler, and he was greatly assisted by being ambidextrous.
Baseball and skittles flourished during my term of office at “ East,” and a
glance at the records of premierships won at cricket and the other two pastimes
is enough to fill any other club with envy; in fact, I do not think the record could
be found beaten anywhere.
Amongst foremost baseballers, I must name R. F. Steel, J. A. Bruce (these
two members, by the way, were worthy captains of the Second Cricket Eleven
for some years), Frank Laver, P. McAlister, A. S. Carter, H. Stuckey, Harry,
Trott and Horne, and many others; whilst at skittles, I must mention W. W. and
George Gaggin, George Chapman, H. Harwood, Ben Davies, W. J. Hickford,
Mel Fades, A. E. Carter, W. G. Stokes, Fred. Capewell, Harry, Horne and
Trott. (Others, please forgive me!)
The most important functions in connection with the Club during my time
were the football match for the benefit of the employees of the Bijou Theatre,
destroyed by fire; the first theatrical carnival; the first ladies’ cricket match;
Robertson and Moffatt’s, and the Caledonian Society’s Sports; the interstate
cricket match, Victoria v. Tasmania; the cricket matches, “East” v. Lord
Sheffield’s team, and Lord Sheffield’s team v. Juniors; the Old Identities’ cricket
match, and the Town and Country Week Social, both promoted by Mr. A. E.
Clarke; the matches and entertainments to the public schools; the Patriotic Fund
entertainment; and the Club’s record-take football match, on a Queen’s Birthday,
—fSn, at 6d. and 1/6, ground and stand charges, respectively.
I cannot proceed without mentioning “ Old Mac.,” who, with his dog, “Jack,”
were part and parcel of the East ground. “ Mac.” was a faithful and skilled
caretaker, and when he declined in years he was pensioned off with £3O per
annum by the Club. He died a few years ago, but his memory will live for many
a day. His successor, Fred. Capewell, who is still with the Club, has filled the
vacancy as caretaker most ably in every respect.
It is most pleasurable to me to record that, during my thirteen years’ Secre-
taryship, I cannot recall any unpleasantness between players or Committee, and
this happy fact was no doubt of great assistance towards gaining success.
During the bad times, I resigned my position as Secretary, and was most
kindly presented by the members with a testimonial of a purse of 112 sovereigns.
I retained the office for a while in an honorary position, and resumed it later,
finally resigning most reluctantly in 1901.
I cannot omit mention of Fielder (Phil) Ware, the Club’s caterer, a most
generous friend and patron. Alas! he has passed away, with Harry Boyle, Harry
Budd, Charley Alice, H. M. Gooch, Ted Fletcher, Val. Thompson and others.
They are hard indeed to replace.
I must refer to my pleasant relationship with the Essendon Football Club,
especially with their President, Mr. A. McCracken, an ideal sportsman, and Hon.
Secretaries, W. J. Smith, Lou. Dallas and W. C. Crebbin. Long may the
E.M.C.C. and the E.F.C. continue to flourish hand in hand.
J


A very enjoyable recollection of my days at “ East ” was my visiting Adelaide,
in 1908, as manager of the Victorian Eleven, whilst my visits with the East team
to Warrnambool and Hamilton, at Easter-time, were delightful experiences. The
kindnesses shown to myself and to our team by Mr. Sam. McDonald and Mr.
George Rippon, the respective Presidents of the clubs in these towns, and by
the ladies there, I shall never forget.
To conclude these reminiscences of my official connection with “ East,” I
am proud and glad at heart to think of the many good friends I made there, and
of my most pleasant relationship with the various members of Committee, and the
members, also with officials of kindred clubs, especially including Major War dill,
of the M.C.C., and Mr. E. D. Heather, of South Melbourne.
I rejoice that “ East ” is now in a splendid financial and sport position, and
that I feel I am almost as closely allied to the present Committee and players
as to those in the past.
Floreat “ East”! Always! is the sincere wish of
E. B. MANNING.
JOTTINGS
By T. Horan.
My first recollection of the East Melbourne Club dates back to the time when
I was a very small boy. In the season 1866-67, my brother James played in
the First Eleven, and I used to go down and watch the practice evening after
evening. I was not much taller than the bat, but I used to “scout” and throw in
the ball, and I was rewarded by being allowed to bowl and bat. What thoughts
and feelings come thronging as my fancy takes flight through the vista of years.
My brother died in March, 1868, but as his old friend and mine, W. W. Gaggin,
was still there, I kept up my visits to the nets, and have to thank him and Dan.
Wilkie for hints, both in batting and bowling. A season or two later I joined
Carlton, and my first match on turf was against East Melbourne, on the East
ground. The Jolimonters were famous then, as now, and as I write I can recall
the flutter of trepidation as I went down to bat against them. As good luck would
have it, I scored 25 (not out), and you can hardly imagine the delight I felt on
reading in the “Australasian,” under Tom Brown’s charming cricket chatter,
that I was a promising bat, with sound defence.
Leaving Carlton, I played with South Melbourne, under the captainship of
the old intercolonial player, Jack Conway, who was a former Jolimonter, but
was now indefatigable in his efforts to secure promising colts for the South. One
match I remember particularly well, and that was when fifteen of us beat the
famous East by seven runs. Dan. Wilkie had played a fine innings, and I had
the honour of capturing his wicket. To this day, Dan. maintains that the wind
dislodged the bail. Another great match I recall was when Gaggin and Goldsmith
collared Allan on the Hill. It was a grand win for East Melbourne. A little
later " Goldie ” was in Clarendon Street, and a lad, stopping him, said, “ That


was a fine innings you played on Saturday, Mr. Goldsmith; I’ve given you a line
in the ‘ Emerald Hill Record ’ for that.” That lad was young Barnes, afterwards
well-known in Boyle and Scott's depot, in Bourke-street. Barnes once got Charlie
Bannerman to show him how to bowl leg breaks. It was a moonlight night, in
Collins Street, just outside the Oriental Hotel, and Charlie kept the young fellow
at it for a considerable time in the open street.
In 1873, I joined East Melbourne, and I did so owing to the return to Mel-
bourne of my friend, W. W. Gaggin, who had been stationed in Port Fairy
for quite a long spell. If he had not gone to the country I would have been a
“blue and white” man much earlier; for ever since my brother played with the
Club, I had always an eager desire to become a Jolimonter. At last my wish was
gratified, and on counting the many years that have passed since I first became a
member, it is absolutely true to say that my whole experience as a Jolimonter
has been one of unalloyed pleasure. Indeed, it would be strange if it were not
so, for a more genial lot of fellows could not be found anywhere.
One trip I have a very vivid recollection of. That was to Sale, in Gippsland,
in the old coaching days, when “ Glue Pot Harry ” flourished as a driver. When
we were about to leave the Albion Hotel, in Bourke Street, where the coach
started from, a cabman said to the coach-driver, “ Where are those young fellows
going to?” And when he heard that they were taking the coach-trip to Sale to
play cricket, he said, “ Anyone who would go to Sale to play cricket would
go to hell for amusement.” The road certainly was very rough, and I don’t
think we had a wink of sleep during the twenty-four hours’ journey. In that
match Dan. Wilkie was bowling, and Curtis Macfarland made a superb catch at
point; the umpire gave the batsman “not out,” and Dan. said, “Catch them
higher next time, Curtis, this umpire can’t see.”
The celebrated batsman, C. Bannerman, came over from Sydney, and played
a fine innings for South Melbourne against East Melbourne. He scored 72, and
was bowled by G. Searcy with a “yorker.” One of the pluckiest cricketers that
ever entered a field was the late Harry Boyle. He created the position of silly
mid-on, and brought off some wonderful catches. Boyle was always singularly
earnest as a cricketer. Even at the practice nets he would measure off his
bowling distance, and, as a consequence, he very rarely delivered a “no-ball.”
He was captain of the First Eleven for many years, and invariably got on well
with his comrades. Another favourite was Charlie Allee, who was a capital all-
round man. He once said to Frank Allan, “ Pitch ’em there, please, that is the
spot I like.” Frank did pitch one or two in the spot indicated, and sure enough,
Charlie banged each ball to the boundary. His death was very much regretted,
and I think a little sod of his well-loved turf was placed in his grave. The late
E. P. Hastings was a fine bat and good field, and acted very ably as Secretary
for some seasons. He and W. W. Gaggin used to make a sort of paste, and
apply it to the palms of their hands, to make chances “stick.” Tobacco, well
chewed, was one of the component parts of the paste.
In those old matches it used to be a treat to watch L. Goldsmith field at
long-leg and cover. He was remarkably fleet of foot, and full of dash, and a
capital thrower. His batting was bright and attractive, and some fine scores
were compiled by him. In those days thousands rolled up each Saturday to see
the Challenge Cup matches, and at the close of a match prominent performers
were called out in front of the pavilion to bow their acknowledgment in response
to hearty and sustained applause. Lady supporters wore the colours of com


peting clubs, and the enthusiasm manifested all round far surpassed anything
witnessed in Club cricket to-day.
“ Old Mac.” ’"as a striking figure at East Melbourne for many years. Small
boys used to worry him by running over his pitch, and one who used to be chased
by him was the now famous Bertram Mackennal. I believe that the well-known
player Mat. Ellis once, as a small boy, rode a calf up and down the pitch, and
“ Old Mac.” was so exasperated that he gave him a great chase, and finally threw
a hoe at him as he was getting over the fence. The hoe just missed Mat., who
looks serious even to this day when he thinks of that narrow shave. W. Riggall,
the well-known solicitor, was very keen at practice, and after his game and shower
would walk all the way to Windsor. I have often bowled at him until the light
failed.
A thing used to be done by players at East Melbourne that I never see now,
namely, putting a bat up in the pavilion chimney to get it seasoned. Gaggin, Alice,
Goldsmith, O. C. Williams, and C. Carr, all put their bats up “ Old Mac.’s ”
chimney, and though I do not know that they were improved by the process, they
certainly had a fine rich colour at the finish. A sterling all-round player in my
time was V. B. Trapp, who was always cheery and bright, even when the pro-
spects of victory were not roseate. A beautiful field was W. Brown, a neat bats-
man and good bowler. It was to him “ Old Mac.” said, “ They have Mount
Mesuvius at the fireworks; you ought to see it, Mr. Brown.” “It isn’t Mesuvius,
Mac.,” said Mr. Brown. Mac. said, “ Well, if it ain’t, you be beggared.” I can
hear Billy’s laugh now.
A veteran who practised as diligently and as long as anyone in the Club
is J. Healy. Many an evening, in summers long bygone, we have together heard
the music of bat and ball. In recent years we have been trying hard to bowl each
other out at the nets, but the sad admission has to be made that there is no
“ devil ” in our deliveries now. So I cannot break through his defence, and he
cannot break through mine. Thus honours are easy, aren’t they? Twenty-five
years ago, and more, he, Boyle, T. Launder, and myself have walked
away from the ground just on dusk, evening after evening. The players to-day
don’t practice nearly so long. I think we often overdid it, and became somewhat
stale. Another man who used to practice very hard was that excellent little
wicket-keeper, Ned Elliott, who died many years ago. Once, when he was keeping
wickets, he tried to snap a chance off Midwinter, who was batting. The big
Bendigonian said to Ned, “ You had better be careful, or I might tread on you.”
Midwinter, Boyle, and Jack Harry were the best trio that Bendigo ever produced.
To catch a train for Melbourne for the Saturday matches, Boyle had to walk
four or five miles from Sydney Flat to the railway station, and return from
Melbourne on Sunday night. He did this regularly until he got an appointment
in Melbourne. No keener or gamer man ever entered a field than this famous
dead and gone warrior of old Bendigo and Jolimont. As a “ length ” bowler he
was worthy in every sense to be bracketed with the renowned Alfred Shaw.
Indeed, more than one great English batsman said that they would rather bat
against Spofforth than against Boyle on a “sticky” wicket.
A player I admired very much was Donald Campbell. He was a noted
Jolimonter, and on his return from Oxford University he made a century (128,
run out) against Lord Harris’s English team. He had a beautiful cover stroke,
which he invariably made with a perpendicular blade. Once, on returning from
one of his stations, he brought a young dingo down to the ground. The dingo


set to work on Ben Terry’s blue and white cricket shirt, and tore it to
fragments. Ben was in a towering rage, and actually blamed “ Old Mac.,” with
whom he had a bit of a row on the morning of that shirt-tearing day. Presently
Ben caught sight of the dingo, still in possession of a portion of the shirt; then
he knew “ Old Mac.” was not the culprit. Later in the day, Campbell made good
more than the cost of the shirt. In fact, Ben said, “ I would not mind having
a shirt torn up every day at the same price.” That dingo took a fancy to Gaggin,
and often followed him into the old Treasury. Soon the dingo took a fancy to
Gaggin’s luncheon, and often sneaked it when W.W. was not looking. Other
luncheons also disappeared; in fact, the dingo, before long, became such a
nuisance that Campbell had to get rid of him. Another Campbell was “ Willie,”
who was a delightful batsman, with the most gloriously executed leg strokes you
could wish to see. It was the witty “ Pick,” Josh Pickersgill, who said, “ Wait
till Willie Campbell gets set,” in that match against New South Wales, in 1874-5,
when the tables were turned, after a long series of triumphs to the credit of
Victoria. Willie did not get set, but T. J. D. Kelly did, and performed brilliantly.
Who that saw it can forget his walk round subsequently, in the beautiful blazer.
A capital and really artistic batsman was Harry Musgrove, who made
beautiful strokes, crisp and clean, on both sides of the wicket. He went to
England as manager of the 1896 Australian Eleven. George Vautin, from
Tasmania, was a remarkably vigorous batsman, and the way in which the ball
travelled to the boundary when he got going was a caution. Attewell, the well-
known English player, from Notts County, told me that he regarded Vautin as
one of the best batsmen he had met in Australia. Another Tasmanian who was
an especial favourite at Jolimont was Vere Harris, a sterling batsman and good
field. Across the water to the golden West, at Southern Cross, I salute the old
blue and white, my friend Vere. A good man and true all-round was John F.
Cody, who used to take great interest, not only in East Melbourne, but in old
Yarra Bend, when W. McLean was to the fore there. Still another name comes
to memory, in C. Letcher, a capital left-handed bowler, who distinguished himself
by catching and bowling W. G. Grace for a “ duck,” when the renowned old
warrior was out here with Lord Sheffield’s team. Charlie, I understand, has
the ball yet with which he performed this feat. George B. Gordon was a fine
free batsman in my time, and a page could easily be written about the doings
of T. U. Groube and Dr. H. J. H. Scott, who went to England as members of
Australian teams. Tom went in 1880, and the doctor, who in his younger days
was known to us as “ Tup,” went in 1884 and 1886. Both were towers of
strength to East Melbourne. P. G. McShane was a very serviceable all-round
man, and did good work with bat and ball for East Melbourne. He was left-
handed, both with bat and ball, and at one stage of his career was a candidate
for Australian Eleven honours. A good many, including myself, thought that
he would have done well in England. In my time, too, we had in Percy Lewis
an able wicket-keeper and excellent batsman. John Hewlett has done good service
with bat and ball, and as for that fine quintette, F. Laver, P. McAlister, S.
McMichael, H. Stuckey and A. Carter, well, they were hard to beat in fighting
for the “ blue and white.” Fred. Collins, too, has performed wonderfully well
as a bowler. We all know how ably A. E. Trott performed before
he left for England, and was it not one of the real old smoke-seasoned bats that
Goldsmith presented to him down on the ground one very pleasant evening, when
all went merry as a marriage-bell.—l fancy I can see Goldie’s fine bold writing on


that bat now.—By the way, Dan. Wilkie has a bat that would be considered of
much value in the old country. It is the bat that was used by the celebrated
Robert Carpenter, when out here with George Parr’s team, in 1863-4. The great
player gave it to Dan. The Club lost one of the most promising players in the
colony when Val. Thompson died. What a grand young fellow he was, too. And
what glorious hair! Verily, his “ sunny locks hung on his temples like a golden
fleece.” Who can forget Jimmy Clark? I venture the statement that no man
breathing could beat him in seasoning a bat. And the care he took in his work,
and the pride with which he would show you the properly seasoned blade at
the finish, were something you never see now. Good old Jimmy; what an
enthusiast from his boyhood days to the very last days of his life. Some of his
old bats should be translated with him to the fields of Asphodel. Who can forget
his mysterious beckonings, when he kept wicket, to get the bowler to send along
one a bit shorter or a bit further up, according to the style of play adopted by
the batsman. It was great, and reminded you not a little of Boyle’s beckonings
to the field when the great old veteran toed the bowling crease.
Very pleasant memories are associated with the Old Identities’ Matches. In
one of them that I remember well, W. W. Gaggin wore an old “ blue and white ”
shirt that dated from his palmy days, when he was noted for the “ same old
scrape ” with the bat, just as the ball was leaving the bowler’s hand. Time had
so changed the famous colours that the prevailing tint in that historic shirt
was a rich russet, suggestive of long years of service and exposure to wind,
rain and storm. How it took one back to the early days to see him, W. H.
Peryman, Ted Fowler, and Ben James in the field together as of yore, when
Ben was famous as a bowler, who used, as the saying went, to bring the ball from
somewhere in the region of his waistcoat pocket. What cheery chats they had
about the golden hours of long ago, when all the world seemed May to them,
and all the leaves were green. I could sit for hours and listen to their old-time
talk of Boake, Gid. Elliot, Jack Huddlestone, Greaves, W. L. Rees, Bill Stewart,
and others who played before my time. Who cared whether the rain came down
or thunder crashed or lightning flashed? There was, in the meeting of old
comrades, in the interchange of chat in the spirit of the hour, a joyous feeling
that po rain or inkiness of cloud could dissipate or dim. By the way, I had
pleasure of meeting W. L. Rees in New Zealand, and he seemed very glad to
talk to myself and Boyle about his cricket days as a Jolimonter. He was a cousin
of the renowned W. G. Grace.
Two good old Jolimonters were C. Forrester and T. Hepburn. Forrester
was called the “ lion hitter,” through knocking up half-a-century in twenty
minutes against South Melbourne, in a famous Cup match. I once saw Charlie
catch Johnnie Mullagh in great style at long on, under the old gum-tree, off Dan.
Wilkie’s slows. Tom Hepburn had a nice style of batting. When he lived out
at Auburn, in the “seventies,” he had a great strawberry garden, and when “old
Gibbie” and I came back from Adelaide, Tom invited the two of us to test his
strawberries. We tested them all right. It was the best feed of strawberries
I ever had, and dead and gone “ Gibbie ” said the same.
The Club had a capital all-round man in Arthur Christian, and his old com-
rades are glad to know that the genial Arthur in the Golden West has lost none
of his old-time form. Jack Godby has been a member for some seasons, and
has acquitted himself with credit as an all-round man. One good Jolimonter was
Jack Eggleston, who used to throw a cricket ball 107 yards from start to finish.


I wonder how far he could throw the ball now! Like myself, he is getting a
bit on the burly side. Even before his time, D. Carson has to be placed; he was
a good bowler, and a fair bat, and I believe he had a game not long ago, some-
where near the Gulf of Carpentaria. Frank Cavanagh was another player well
and favourably known at Jolimont in the days of Hugh Kyte, Maurice Blackburn
and Jimmy Stewart, who came to see me in Scotland. A genuine enthusiast is
our old friend, W. G. Hickford, Hon. Treasurer to the Club. Known to his
numerous friends as “ Hick,” he is a general favourite, and in non-players’
matches he is as keen as anyone, and bowls with the old level arm, reminiscent
of Sam. Cosstick and the old school. Good old “ Hick.” The Rev. E. S. Hughes
for years has taken a deep interest in the Club, and as President he has won the
esteem and regard of all the members.
In the middle seventies there used to be a great time at the skittle matches.
How used the rafters ring at night when Gaggin did a floorer at a critical junc-
ture. Game as a pebble to the last, he was always all there at a pinch, and so
was Harry Boyle, but he was not up to W.W.’s form as a skittler. “ Old Mac ”
played a good game, and George Chapman and Mel. Eades were first rate.
Whisper it gently—we used to play on a Sunday morning, when Harry Budd
and Harry Campbell would come down with J. L. Purves and other shining lights
of those days. Phil. Wing was another old skittler who figured in the East
Melbourne alley. Sometimes, too, H. M. Gooch, the old Hon. Treasurer, would
turn up, and he and H. H. Budd are dead and gone, with many more. Do you
recall sometimes that ever-memorable toast, “ Gentlemen, I ask you to charge
your glasses and drink to the ’elth of our Hancient friend, Mr. ’Enery Budd!”
And how they did drink it! Why with three times three, and one cheer more,
with a “tiger” from Harry Boyle. Budd, as Hon. Secretary, did yeoman service
for the Club, and I remember “Old Mac” placed in the grave, at Brighton, a
piece of the good old turf. Another man who did excellent secretarial work was
E. B. Manning, and, later, S. McMichael acquitted himself admirably in that
office, when the frowns of fortune, from a financial standpoint, were at their
darkest.
How well I recall the stalwart figure of Wyndham, who bowled so well at
times. Once, when W. G. Grace was practising on the East ground, he lifted
one from “Wyndy” clean out of the ground; the ball pitched some yards up the
right-of-way beyond the road, and “Wyndy” simply scratched his head, and said,
“My Gawd, what a hit.” The practice wickets in those days were nearer Rich-
mond-road than they are at present. I should mention that Fred. Capewell, who
for many years has done fine work as Curator, was a crack skittler, but on one
occasion he lost a tournament in a final fight with Frank Tuckwell, who figured
in some of the non-players’ matches with J. Mac Alister and Fred. Hilcke, the
present Hon. Secretary, who was a smiter in his early days with the Club, and
improved much in cricket and skittles as he went along. I must not forget the
genial Fielder Ware, who was caterer for several seasons, and always an ardent
supporter of the Club, and of the “ same old ” Essendon Football Club. Everyone
called Fielder “ Phil.,” and once, when he was signing a receipt, one looker-on
nudged another, and whispered, “ He doesn’t know how to spell his own name;
he’s starting it with an F.” Many a laugh there was in after years over that
little incident. One of the best of the old brigade was Charlie Carr, who was
a capital batsman, with an attractive style, and a fair change bowler. He was
also a grand and absolutely fearless footballer.


What fun and real enjoyment there was in the old days, at the dinner, when
Dan. Wilkie, J. L. Purves, Josh Pickersgill, A. M. Topp, and Dr. Moloney made
really clever speeches, which were wont to set the table in a roar; when Goldsmith
used to give us felicitous quotations from pretty nearly any poet you liked to
mention. I recall one from Longfellow, when “ Goldie ” proposed the toast of
the Ladies—
“ As unto the bow the chord is,
So unto the man is woman,
Though she bends him, she obeys him,
Though she draws him, yet she follows,
Useless each without the other.”
Then there were Jack Jenvey and E. A. Chapman, all there, with their rhyming
references to “ye famous men of Jolimont,” and their doughty deeds on many
a well-fought field. What a pleasant retrospective glance one can take, too, at
the press and theatrical matches in the days of George Coulson, Chapman, G.
Walstab, J. C. Williamson, Verdi, G. S. Titheradge, G. W. Anson, E. B. Manning,
Arthur Redwood, Robert Brough, with Mrs. Brough looking on, and thoroughly
enjoying the game. Why it was good to be alive in those days. If we could only
get back the ashes of those burnt out summers, what urn woul 1 be big and costly
enough to hold them. But if we cannot get the ashes, we can get glimpses of
the glory that has been, and to you and to me they are a solace sweet as summer.
I have mentioned names of those who go far back in the history of the Club, but
there is one who caps the lot. I refer to A. E. Clarke, who was the real life
of the Club, and has followed it with unabated zest, through all its vicissitudes.
The term of fifty years is long, but he seems to invert the order of the years, and
wears them now, to all appearances, as lightly as a flower. He did much to make
the Club famous. It is famous now, and my earnest hope is that good men and
true will keep it famous for many a year to come.
THE “LOST BALL” MATCH
By C. S. Carr.
From the commencement of the season the sixth contest for the Challenge
Cup had been looked forward to by the cricket-loving community to provide the
best cricket to be witnessed in the colony, and a close and exciting contest. The
result bettered the anticipation, and anyone desiring to see finer cricket, a more
keenly contested game throughout, or a closer finish must indeed be hard to
please. The episodes connected with the match also added to its far-reaching
effects in spreading and popularising the game, which had already taken such
deep root in the colony. The match was commenced on the 18th November,
1871. Rain had fallen copiously during the week, and a dead wicket was the
result; but Saturday opened beautifully fine—a perfect cricketing day, while
the ground never looked better. Our big guns, Gaggin, Goldsmith, Willie Camp-
bell and Williams, were all out with the total four for 39. Dan. Wilkie then


put some life into the game, and rattled up 19 before he was dismissed, caught
at mid-on by Wardill off Sam Cosstick. Alice and Riggall followed in quick
succession, and the outlook was anything but promising for us, when Heather
and Peryman stepped into the breach, and brought up 120 before the latter was
dismissed for 25. Dave Wilkie and Darke did not trouble the scorers long, and
the innings closed with the total at 127. Heather played a sterling innings for
40 (not out), and was deservedly applauded for his plucky performance at
a critical stage.
C. S. CARR
R. W. Wardill and Gibson opened the ball for M.C.C., to the bowling of
Dave Wilkie and Darke. The former should have been caught off the first ball,
but shortly after was bowled off his pads by Darke for 3. Kelly joined Gibson,
and a stand was made, until Kelly was caught off Wilkie for 21. J. Phillips,
“the potter,” and Gibson played out time, and the board showed two for 57.
On the following Saturday, Gibson and Phillips resumed to the bowling of
Darke and Alice, and both our bowlers were in great form, and the wily Daniel
having instructed them to “pitch ’em up” to Phillips, the “potter” was clean
bowled in Darke’s second over with a yorker. B. B. Cooper followed, and Alice,


who was told to “put on the pace, and keep them straight,” lowered the off stump
of M.C.C.’s most dangerous batsman with his second ball. Four down for 63.
Cameron joined “ Gibbie,” and some slow play followed. Darke, after bowling
five maidens, dismissed the latter with a good-length ball. The bowling at this
stage was so good, and the fielding so keen, that few runs were made. Allee
bowled six maidens in succession, and off his following five overs only two runs
were scored. With the advent of the veteran, Sam. Cosstick, the game became
much livelier, and too soon went up. “ Bustle up,” cried Dan. “ Look out, at
cover,” said Charley Allee. A wide off ball tempted Sam., and Riggall, at cover,
effected a good catch.
The remaining Melbourne batsmen did not give us trouble, but stayed long
enough to enable Gibson to increase the total, which reached 134, just seven ahead
of us. Gibson carried his bat right through the innings, and his capital innings
of 65 (not out) earned him the applause of both teams.
Goldsmith and Heather opened our second innings. The brilliant “ Goldie ”
did not last long, much to the chagrin of followers of the blue and white. David
Wilkie followed, but had even a shorter life, and two down for 13 was not
exhilarating. Riggall shaped well, until, on reaching double figures, he succumbed
to a “ Sydney grubber” from Kelly, and retired to the pavilion amidst a running
fire of chaff. O. C. Williams filled the breach, and he and Heather kept their
wickets up till call of time, the tally being four for 45. The game was resumed
on the following Thursday, at 11.30 a.m., and Williams and Heather added 44
before the latter was caught at third man off Sam. Williams soon followed.
Both men showed good cricket during their stay, and consultations round “Gibbie’s”
snuff box were frequent. Gaggin and W. Campbell were now the hope of
Jolimont, and a long stand was expected, but, alas! Gaggin was given out to
a very smart catch in the slips, and the unsatisfactory register of six for 91 was
very discouraging. Campbell was joined by his captain, and 13 runs were added
in quick time, when another damper was experienced, the skipper being dismissed
by a long hop from the insatiable Sam. Cosstick. When the “old timer,” Pery-
man, took guard, it was any odds against E.M. reaching 130. Peryman’s style,
however, though plain, was effective, and ten after ten was added. Wardill
and Cameron were knocked off; Clay tried in vain; and M.C.C.’s forlorn hope—
Kelly’s slows—could not effect a separation. “ Pery ” stopped them, and “Willie ”
punished them, until, as 150 was hoisted, Peryman was bowled by Sam. Cosstick
for a plucky and much-needed 21. Campbell was caught shortly after, and the
innings closed for 156. Exciting as were the closing incidents of our innings,
the second M.C.C. innings was the crowning point of the game. None who wit-
nessed that memorable innings will ever forget the intense excitement which per-
vaded players and onlookers alike. With only 150 to get, and the cream of
Victorian batsmen to get them, against a team “ badly in want of a first-class
bowler,” the prospects of a win were not of the brightest, even to the most
sanguine of our supporters.
Wardill and Gibson started the innings, and commenced as though about to
score freely, but great was our joy when, with 8 on the board, the dreaded Gibson
was run out. Phillips, the stonewaller, to the amazement of all, started a forcing
game, and anxiety deepened, until Dan. Wilkie disposed of Wardill by a clever
catch at mid-on. Kelly joined Phillips, and 50 were added to the total, each
four sending our spirits down towards zero. The “potter” was scoring the faster
of the two. Then fortune favoured us again, and he was run out through a


second piece of bad judgment. Kelly was soon after neatly stumped by Alice,
off Dan.’s slows. Four for 81. Cosstick came in only to see Cameron, his
partner, caught by Dan. Wilkie off his own bowling, but the umpire's verdict
was against the bowler. Sam. skied the first ball, but Gaggin could not quite
get to it. David Wilkie relieved Alice, but both batsmen punished him, and
Darke resumed the bowling, and Cosstick was soon after stumped off Dan. Wilkie.
Five for 95. Cooper followed, and was quickly run out —the third wicket lost
to Melbourne in this way. A magnificent ball from Darke just lifted Cameron’s
bails, and Jolimont was jubilant. Austin Loughnan was neatly caught by Dan.
Wilkie in the slips, off Darke, and his brother Andrew, in the out-field, by
Peryman, off the same bowler. Then the culminating point of this unique game
was reached, and subsequent proceedings are best described in the final para-
graph of the Australasian report. I give it in full.
“ Mutual congratulations are taking place all round as Ford comes in, and
35 runs wanted; it’s a ‘ guinea to a gooseberry ’ on East Melbourne; but there’s
a very good time coming for Melbourne, and during the next half-hour such a
scene of excitement was witnessed as has never been seen on any cricket ground
in the colony before. Ford, ‘caring nothing, daring all,’ went in for slogging;
he quickly administered beans to Dan. Wilkie’s slows, struck out to Darke and hit
him away, and the excitement round the ground became intense. Shouts and
counter shouts were deafening, and, to add to all, Alice, at the wickets, missed
Ford at least six times, amidst the yells of the Jolimonters, and the exuberant
delight of the Melbourne men. Marsden, who fielded as substitute for Goldsmith,
also missed Ford at long-on, the easiest chance of all, and seven runs only wanted
to win. The luck that East Melbourne had in the last 15 minutes was dreadfully
disheartening to them. Once Darke hit Ford’s wicket hard, the bail was raised,
and, turning round, fell exactly into its place again, and Allee, thinking it was
down, omitted to stump the batsman, who was almost in the middle of the wicket.
Again Ford went out, and again Allee failed to take the ball; again and again
was this done, until the excitement became almost unbearable, and we verily
believe that the easiest catch would have been missed by any of the men fielding,
so excited had they become. E.M. became quite demoralised, and unless Allee
or Darke could lower the stumps the match was lost. ‘ For heaven’s sake keep
steady, boys,’ shouted Wilkie for the fiftieth time. ‘ How many do they want
to win?’ asked he of the scorers, and the answer came back, ‘Four.’ ‘Now
Darke,’ and Darke bowled, watched by hundreds of eager eyes; out goes Ford
again, and, amid ear-splitting shouts and cries, lifts it to mid-on for two. Again
Darke advances to deliver what all round feel to be the last ball of the match,
and amid that silence which ever precedes a storm, it whizzes on its course. Out
goes Ford again, and the shouts are again on the lips of the Melbourne men,
when, oh! Fortune, fickle goddess! it broke on to his leg, and glancing thence on
to his wicket, the cries that made the welkin ring announced that E.M. had won
the match by one run. The scene that ensued beggars description; it was a case
of ‘ pandemonium let loose ’; the pavilion was rushed, forms overturned, and
every individual member of the E.M. team was hugged and pulled to pieces by
their excited friends to such an extent that the safety of their limbs was endan-
gered. So close and exciting a finish to a big match has never before been
known, and to keep it up it appears that the M.C.C. also claim the match by one
run. When Ford hit one of Wilkie’s slows away square, it went into the road,
and Goldsmith, in vaulting the fence, fell on his head and became insensible, and


before the ball was returned eight runs had been run. At the termination of the
fifth run, however, the E.M. captain and some of the men called ‘ Lost ball.’ This
was unheard by the scorers, who scored eight for the hit. Before the game was
resumed the captain’s attention was drawn to this, and he immediately requested
the scorers to alter it, but they declined to do so unless directed by the umpire.
That functionary, on being appealed to, gave six runs, and the score was altered
accordingly. The M.C.C. captain denies the power of the umpire in this case,
urging that the ball was not lost to view, and so the matter stands. Goldsmith
recovered from the effects of his accident sufficiently to be removed home . .
but as he fell full on his head on the hard ground, and lay motionless, a shudder
ran through the ground before they rushed across to his assistance.”
The contention of the M.C.C. captain, mentioned in the above report, that
the umpire had no authority to decide the number of runs scored for a hit, could
not, of course, hold water, and I do not think it was seriously entertained by
Wardill. It gave rise, however, to some most amusing correspondence between
the captains and partisans of the two clubs, in which all sorts of extraordinary
precedents and hypothetical cases were cited, including even the vagaries of a
team of lunatics, and in which one writer maintained a ball could not be lost, be-
cause it was subsequently found. After all this epistolary warfare it was dis-
covered that the scorers had lost themselves in the concluding excitement as
much as the players, and had made an error of a couple of runs in the score
sheet, which rendered the effect of lost ball or no lost ball nugatory, and we won
by two runs.
BASEBALL
By C. W. Nodrum.
Baseball is not, as many people suppose, a game new to Victoria. It was
played here as far back as 1857, but the matches were intermittent, and there was
no organisation. The visit of Mr. Spalding’s American teams in 1888 was the
real beginning, and although the game has passed through many vicissitudes
since, it is now firmly established and popular.
In 1890, some East Melbourne cricketers were attracted by the game, and
having no team of their own, Frank Laver, Peter McAlister, and F. Lear, joined
the Metropolitan Club, and tasted the delights of baseball. They were evidently
much impressed, for later in the same season they left the Metropolitans, and
started a team at East Melbourne. The services of S. McMichael, J. Harry, P.
Lewis, and others, were enlisted, and in their first match the team scored a fine
victory over Ferguson and Mitchell’s by 17 to 5. It is interesting to note that
Frank Laver pitched in this first game, and Peter McAlister played third base,
positions which twenty years later we find them still well qualified to fill.
Following up this victory, the new team challenged the then powerful Metro-
politans, and were again victorious, scoring 17 to 12.
In 1891, East Melbourne was entered as a pennant club. S. McMichael for-
sook the game for football, and F. Lear also left, but R. F. Steel, H. F. Boyle, A.
Seidel and J. A. Bruce commenced what proved to be a long and honourable


connection with baseball at East Melbourne. The first match (against the
Metropolitans) was lost, and the next commenced a series of keenly fought
struggles with our great rivals of the M.C.C. Melbourne had a powerful side,
including, as it did, such players as W. Bruce, T. and H. Irwin, D. Mcllwraith,
F. Lear and C. Ross, and it was a fine performance of the young Jolimonters to
beat them, 18 to 12. Our team won every match that season except one, and
became the holders of the Spalding Trophy, and winners of the J. C. Williamson
Shield. East Melbourne won the Spalding Trophy again in 1892 (it had to be
won three times to become the property of any club), but the M.C.C. had also two
wins to their credit, and a third premiership in 1894 made the trophy theirs. East
Melbourne were runners up in 1893 and 1894.
The popularity of the game continued to grow, and in 1897 the time was
considered ripe to send a team to America. A good side was got together, includ-
ing four Jolimonters, F. Laver (who captained the team), P. McAlister, A. S.
Carter, and H. J. Stuckey, but the tour was a failure, and this want of success
contributed in some degree to the falling off in popularity of the game which
followed. The wet winters of the late “ nineties,” however, were also much to
blame. They chilled the ardour of all but the most enthusiastic followers of the
game, and one by one the clubs dropped out, until, in 1899, ours was the only
team left. Baseball, however, had taken firm root at East Melbourne, and as
the Club could not find any opponents outside, it divided up its own ranks, and
for a couple of seasons had to content itself with “ scratch ” matches. This was
the critical period in the history of baseball in Victoria, and there is little room to
doubt that had our Club abandoned the game in 1898 and 1900, baseball would
have come to a permanent end as far as Victoria is concerned.
In 1900, East Melbourne, led by Frank Laver, made a great effort to revive
the game, and with the help of a few ardent enthusiasts outside our own ranks,
notably Messrs. W. G. Ingleton, J. S. Milford, T. Smith, and Ivor Evans, a
certain amount of interest was worked up, and a sufficiently good team was got
together to play an interstate match against New South Wales, at Sydney. The
team included four East Melbourne players, Messrs. Laver, McAlister, McMichael
and Nodrum, and that match marked the turning point again in the popularity
of the game. Since that date the number of clubs has grown each year, and
to-day there are about twenty teams playing under the control of the Victorian
Baseball League, and there is also a vigorous competition in the State schools.
It will be seen from the premiership records appended that East Melbourne
has always had a good side. Since the revival of 1900 we have had many great
battles with our old rivals of the M.C.C., and although we were premiers in
1902 and 1906, we have had to be content with the position of runners-up in
1904, 1907-8, and 1909.
Looking back on East Melbourne’s twenty years of baseball, the most note-
worthy feature is the length of time our two champions, Frank Laver and Peter
McAlister, have played the game and remained champions. Both these players
took part in the Club’s first match. McAlister is captain of the First Grade
team to-day, and Laver played regularly until 1908. Laver was, in my opinion,
the finest pitcher we have had in Victoria, and he certainly was the most con-
sistent. His greatest rival would be probably Charles Kemp, of South Melbourne;
but, even supposing their pitching abilities were equal, Laver’s long record must
award him first place. He had command over a great variety of balls, outcurves,
inshoots, drops, and all the combined varieties of the three, and in reserve a

magnificent fast, straight ball, which was the " strike three ” of many a hundred
batsman. The wonder of it is that his arm stood the tremendous strain of
nineteen years’ pitching, and right up to his last game—if it has been played, and
I sincerely hope it has not —he retained all his skill and pace. Like many of the
older players, he made a close study of the game, and got nearer to the American
standard of excellence than most Australians. For ten years I caught Laver’s
pitching, and am probably in a better position than anyone else to criticise it.
When not pitching Laver was a tower of strength at first base, his enormous
reach, and sure hands, making him an ideal player for that position. I think
we can also claim for Laver that he has had no superior in Australia at first base.
Austin Diamond, of New South Wales, was certainly a rival, but Laver’s great
height made it possible for him to take balls that would be far out of Diamond’s
reach.
Peter McAlister is now playing third base for his twenty-first year, and is the
only really first-class third baseman the game has produced here. It is a difficult
position. The ball comes there fast and swerving, and five out of six throws have
to be made to the opposite corner of the diamond. The catches there are mostly
lofty foul flies, which swing in the air in such a manner as only third basemen
and catchers know, and third baseman who are capable of meeting all these con-
tingencies are few and far between. Peter McAlister is one of them—THE one.
Long may he stand there. While commenting on these two players it is interest-
ing to note that the second baseman of the Australian team that visited America,
W. G. Ingleton, of the M.C.C., is also the acknowledged champion of that position.
He, like Laver on first, and McAlister on third, has stood the test of time, and
all ’three have retained their superiority over the host of younger players now
in the game.
East Melbourne had another fine player in C. Lansdown. He was a “ general
utility ” man, could pitch, catch, play first, second, short stop, or the outfield, and
although such all-round pretentions generally mark only moderate ability in any
one position, Lansdown was the exception, and played each position well. As
a batsman we have never had his superior. He was not a big hitter, but invariably
got the all-essential “ base hit.” Lansdown started with East Melbourne in 1898,
and continued until 1909.
In short-stops we have had a number of fine players. J. A. Bruce was the
first, and has been followed by R. F. Steel, A. S. Carter and Geo. Horsburgh, who
plays the position now. All these were players of ability, who made their per-
formances stand out above the rank and file.
Looking back over East Melbourne’s players of the past, one comes to a
great number of men who have served the Club very ably. Amongst them might
be mentioned J. Harry, as first base and pitcher; A. E. Trott, as pitcher; R.
Horne, a really good catcher; Alf. Seidel, catcher, and the cleverest base-runner
East Melbourne has ever had; F. S. Hilcke, a solid and reliable first base; H. J.
Stuckey, who has taken many a brilliant catch in the outfield; and Arthur
Christian, a good pitcher and a hard-hitting batsman. Our weakest spot has, as
a rule, been the outfield, but during the past few seasons this has been much
improved, and missed catches are now rare.
Generally speaking, I do not think that the standard of play has improved
during the past ten years, in spite of the increased numbers of teams, and their
greater evenness. Scores are certainly lower now than they were ten years ago,
but opinion is divided as to whether this is the result of better field-work and


pitching, or inferior batting. I am personally of the opinion that, generally
speaking, the pitching is not as good as in the pre-1900 days, nor is the batting
as good; but that the new “ two foul strike ” rule, combined with improved out-
fielding, is largely the reason of the low-scoring games that now prevail. In the
last decade we had any number of splendid batsmen who hit pitching which was
every bit as good as, or better than, the pitching of to-day, but I think they got
the benefit of greater leniency from the field. In 1893, for instance, the M.C.C.
played 101 innings during the season, and scored no fewer than 353 runs, which is
certain evidence of enormous batting strength, and when one considers that they
were opposed to pitchers of the calibre of F. Laver, C. Kemp, Jack Harry, A.
E. Trott, etc., one cannot altogether blame the pitching. It was then much more
difficult under the rules to strike a batsman out, but this would not entirely account
for the large number of runs scored. Catchers, with two or three notable excep-
tions (such as Jas. McKay, of Metropolitan and M.C.C.), were perhaps slightly
under to-day’s standard, and one notices in the old records a far greater number
of passed balls than are given in present day matches.
Twenty years is a sufficient test of the popularity of any game, and East
Melbourne’s trial of baseball has proved it to be an unqualified success. It stands
by its own merit, and makes such enthusiasts of its devotees as to put its future
beyond doubt. Our triumphs in the field are attested to by the J. C. Williamson
Championship Trophies of 1891 and 1892, which hang in the pavilion, and by
many a weather-beaten pennant in the flag-locker.
The Club’s record in premiership matches is as under:—

SKITTLES
A history of the East Melbourne Cricket Club would not be complete with-
out an allusion to the game of skittles. It occurred to the minds of Messrs. C. G.
Allee, W. W. Gaggin and H. Hale Budd that a winter attraction for the players,
and a means of keeping them in good physical trim during the off season, would
be to form a skittles team. An alley was accordingly provided for in the erection
of the new pavilion, and as the Melbourne, Richmond, South Melbourne, Windsor,
and at one time West Melbourne Clubs also took up the game, the idea proved a
great success, and is still carried on. Anyone who has witnessed the stirring
premiership matches between the aforementioned clubs can testify to the en-
thusiasm and excitement, and good fellowship that prevailed, the games not being
by any means of the “beer and skittles” order, but keen contests, in which a
very great amount of skill and judgment are required. The records of the “ East ”
players are chronicled below, and in mentioning the following names, in connec-
tion with the game, I must apologise to many whom I have forgotten;—Messrs.
