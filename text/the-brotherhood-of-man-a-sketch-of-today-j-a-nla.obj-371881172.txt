Tbe Brotherhood of Man.
A SKETCH OF TO-DAY.
Tramp, tramp, tramp ! they come un-
ceasing, bended backs and weary feet,
Bagged, homeless, hungry, swarming
daily down your quiet street —■
Strong men, sick men, old men, boys scarce
past their childhood, walk the road,
Bearing swag and battered billy—beg-
ging food at your abode,
Camping, nightly, ’neath the bridge, in
ruined hut, in vacant mill,
Ancient dungeon writ with newer omen
on Bombira’s hill—
You who read, nay , you who see them
tramping , begging, camping there,
Save you ever thought the meaning of this
Army of Despair 1
Go where’er you will, you meet them,
not a town but knows the same—
Everywhere their footsteps haunt you—
hunger, hardship, outcast shame
Rise to sight on mountain crest, in fruit-
ful vale, on desert plain—
High-road, by-road, river, station, tell
the story o’er again—
“ Take thy bed and walk” for ever—sun
by day and frost by night—
Torrent rains descend upon them, round
their heads the lightnings smite—
Onwards yet the march unending—empty
bellies, stiffening limbs
(From the churches in the distance peal
the loud thanksgiving hymns).
Seek the city—there in splendour rises
many a massive pile,
But the lanes between are crowded full
of hovels rank and vile ;
And the rich and pleasure-seekers throng
the footpaths bright and gay,
And the shop and warehouse glitter gor-
geous in their wealth’s display,
But the cottage home stands empty—in
the park the mother lies ;
Through those tall New Zealand grasses
you may hear a baby’s cries.
And the father— You have seen him,
he is trudging on the track,
And a wife and baby ivelght the swaq he
carries on his back.
There’s another—she’s a sister of that
boy you lately saw—
He was passing, swag on back, while
yours was playing at your door—
You will see her at the corner—there’s a
stranger at her side—
*S’Ae must keep her baby sisters since her
widowed mother died—-
She is gone—and with the stranger ! You
will see her pass again,
With a bundle for the children, and a
horror in her brain !
There’s her sweetheart, too, is roaming,
and some day ho may come back,
But he knows not yet what’s happened
since he went upon the track.
Have you thought upon the meaning ?
If you never thought before,
Think upon it now, you man whose son
is playing at your door !
Think upon it, husband, brother, mother,
lover ! ponder well
All the terrors of the story that your own
may have to tell —-
And the Writing on the Wall shall rise
once more before your gaze,
Ay ! imprint your sight in letters that
you never can erase,
And you’ll know, unless you turn and
fight the Social System dread,
JEvery man who walks the tSwag Track
can see blood upon your head !
You yourselves are toiling hard from
early dawn to fall of night—
What In com sof your production I Can
you answer this aright ?
Houses empty—-people homeless—lands
on lands that desert lie—-
Cattle, sheep and grain that rot while
men must starve who cannot huy~
Strong men roaming workless —NO work
—no one needs them ! Does their need
Count for nothing ? Why not labor for
themselves—why not, indeed—
And each other ? Men whose toil can
make for every want of man
Die of hunger ! Why ? 0 People, an-
swer I is this Nature’s plan ?
What but slavish bondage only —chains
of Gold and chains of Law—
Can the secret be, forbidding men the
right to Nature’s store ?
What is law but indiscretion ? What is
gold but jealous greed ?
What forbids from joys for all in union’s
strength if each is freed ?
Is the brotherhood of man an empty
dream ? —go ask your hearts !
Is it good or is it evil moves your souls,
and joy imparts ?
Dare to be yourselves and free men !
wheat that’s sown will wheat come back !
Or upon your heads be all the shame and
curses of the Track !
J. A. ANDREWS.
