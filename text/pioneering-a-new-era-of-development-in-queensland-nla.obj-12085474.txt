Foreword
Queensland has only recently completed
the celebration of its one hundredth anniversary
as a self-governing State.
Between the years 1859 and 1959 many
events have occurred which have had a direct
bearing on the progress of this comparatively
young State and on its future destiny.
We who live in this modern age little
realise what conditions faced our pioneer forebears
of the 1850?s and earlier who fought the virgin
wilderness and its primitive inhabitants for their
existence and wrested from the soil a livelihood
which enabled them and the small Colony to
expand and prosper. They built on solid
foundations, they had vision and courage and a
resourcefulness which they handed down to those
who followed them generations later. They
overcame lack of communication, the ravages of
drought, fire and flood, they surmounted the
Hon. E. Evans, M.L.A.
difficulties of distance, separation, transportation and supply and lack of medical services as they
pushed forward the frontiers of civilisation north, south and westward.
? It was an age of heroism in which both men and women, and even children played many
dramatic but unsung deeds of courage and sacrifice as the boundaries of the vast State were being
extended further outwards and history was being made.
Meanwhile those who were responsible for the Government of the young and growing
State had many problems regarding its further growth and development to face up to and decide
upon. The wrong decision could mean calarnatous handicaps later or even immediate retrogression.
Fortunately many of these problems seem to have been solved soundly and with the right type of
vision as considerable progress has been made in the first hundred years although in more recent
eras the tempo of development has not accelerated quite as it should.
Today, as we enter the ?Soaring Sixties? as they have been called, opportunities are
coming fast ?opportunities which if seized and fully exploited can quickly transform the pace of
our development, decentralisation, and population growth. Big decisions will have to be made
and those who make them will indeed require the highest qualities including those of wisdom
and sound judgment so that strong progress will continue to be made in the right direction.
It can be said with all truth, that we are now pioneering a new era of development. It is
not one which calls for the sacrifice, courage and hardship which was required of those in the
1860?s, but it is certainly one which will require courage, vision, statesmanship, commonsense
and judgment so that the future will be soundly and well planned and the foundations well laid
for the tremendous expansion of industries and population which are so necessary to enable
Queensland to reach the peak of greatness.
? This new era, too, will be fast moving and spectacular in its events and will require all our
skill to enable us to keep abreast of the tide of progress.
It is with these thoughts in mind that this brochure has been prepared and I am sure
it will provide food for thought for those who are prepared to read its pages and accept its message
and its challenge. __
Minister for Development. Mines and Main Roads.

THE PATTERN of the Past
In order that one may get a quick but orderly glimpse at the general pattern of events
which contributed to the steady development of the State, this brief review is given.
Early land settlement by a comparative handful of pioneering families was later followed
by the discovery of gold at Canoona in Central Queensland which started a tremendous rush of
new people to this part of the country. The ?rush? left many bereft of money and possessions
as they had sold everything and travelled far to join it. Some stayed in the district but most of
the gold seekers eventually found their way back whence they came. It was not long after,
however, that the major gold discoveries at Peak Downs, Gympie, Ravenswood, Etheridge, Charters
Towers, The Palmer, Coen, Mount Morgan, Croydon, in that order and other minor fields, led
to the rapid opening up of much new country, speeded the development of a number of rural areas
and pushed the frontiers of civilisation ahead much more rapidly than would otherwise have
happened.
History has shown on numerous occasions that in the wake of the mining prospector came
the mining engineers, geologists, storekeepers, businessmen, builders, bankers and all those others
who form the inevitable nucleus of a new community. And so it was in Queensland, where new
centres, around which more rapid rural settlement took place were pioneered by intrepid gold
prospectors who ventured far beyond the bounds of safe, settled areas in their thirst for gold.
It has often been said that the gold mining industry is a pioneering industry as well as a valuable
contributor to the State and National economy.
Land settlement continued apace and brought new and valuable primary industries to
the young State but the growth of secondary industries was small and slow in comparison. Then
the copper mining industry began to play a valuable, if unspectacular, part in the industrial
development of various parts of the State particularly in the Central district, north-west and south
Burnett areas. Mount Morgan became an important copper as well as gold producer, new copper
mines pushed the development of Cloncurry and Chillagoe, Einasleigh and Mount Molloy, and
a number of smaller mines began production at Many Peaks, Mount Perry and other centres of
the South Burnett district. The output of copper from all those centres meant a considerable
increase in economic wealth of the State. Many years later Mount Isa Mines Ltd. came into
the picture as far as copper production was concerned and added vastly to the State?s copper
output and is still doing so in a most spectacular way.
In Queensland, the tin mining industry pioneered the growth of such centres as Stanthorpe,
Cooktown, Herberton, Irvinebank, Mareeba, Chillagoe, Stannary Hills and the Atherton Tableland.
Such men as John Moffat of Irvinebank did much to establish the tin mining industry on a firm
footing in North Queensland and were the pioneers of much growth and development in the areas
in which their operations took them. Today, it is sad to relate that towns such as Irvinebank and
Herberton are only ghosts of their former greatness and many of the famous rich tin mines have
been closed for years. Most of the State?s tin production today comes from two dredges operating
on the Atherton Tableland.
More recently came the development of Mount Isa as a major silver-lead-zinc producer
in 1931 and the subsequent growth of a modern town which today has a population of about
10,000. Here the mining industry was responsible for dramatically turning an inhospitable, barren
wilderness into a thriving busy area. Today, this great mine not only produces most of the State?s
lead-zinc, but is its greatest producer of copper.

The discovery of large deposits of coal in widespread parts of Queensland had been taking
place periodically over the whole century and more and more coal had been mined and utilised
as a source of fuel and power in various areas of the State and was playing a valuable part in
furthering general industrial development, particularly in Southern Queensland.
In 1954 a new era of growth and development began for the North-Western part of the
State, following the discovery of the Mary Kathleen uranium deposit between Cloncurry and
Mount Isa. Within four years, Australia?s most modern town with all conveniences had sprung
up in the arid spinifex country?a town housing about 1,200 people and containing beautiful
lawns, gardens, asphalt roads and a community centre catering for all tastes. The fabulous
Mary Kathleen mine began production of uranium oxide on June 3, 1958, and has ever since been
busily despatching its production of uranium oxide under order to the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority.
In 1956 the discovery of huge deposits of bauxite near Weipa on Cape York Peninsula
was the signal note of a new era to come?this time in the heavily underdeveloped and
underpopulated far northern area of the State. Since then testing operations by Commonwealth
Aluminium Corporation Pty. Ltd. have justified the highest hopes, and fairly soon Queensland
will have an entirely new industry?an alumina industry, which will involve the spending of about
�45 million, and will play a tremendously important role in opening up Cape York Peninsula.
This summarises briefly the general pattern of major mineral developments which have
had a direct bearing on Queensland?s overall growth and development over the hundred and more
years since the first settlers came until the close of its Centenary Year in December, 1959.

THE PROMISE of the Future
Already the pattern of the future can be seen and it includes several developments of
greater magnitude than Queensland has ever known before.
Huge developmental plans have given a strong impetus to the beginning of the new era
of growth and expansion upon which we have entered and some of these are under way.
it The gigantic expansion programme of Mount Isa Mines Ltd. is perhaps outstanding among
these at the moment and when this project is completed in 1964 it will mean that the present
large tonnages of ore produced annually from the mine will be about trebled. At this stage in the
programme the company has already stepped up its daily output of copper and other ores to about
8.000 tons. This production rate, which is continuing to rise, makes Mount Isa the greatest
mine in Australia and among the great ones of the World. Eventually daily output will be about
14.000 tons of ore.
It will be appreciated that a very sharp increase in the output of ores means a similar sharp
increase in the production of concentrates which are produced from the chemical and other
treatment of the ores. This situation posed a major problem requiring an early and satisfactory
solution. It was found that the existing rail facilities between Mount Isa and the port of Townsville
were quite inadequate to cope with these steadily increasing tonnages of concentrates for shipment
as well as the steadily rising production of uranium oxide from Mary Kathleen which also had to
be railed to the wharves at Townsville.
The Queensland Government, headed by its Premier, Honourable G. F. R. Nicklin, M.L.A.,
bent all its energy upon endeavouring to raise the necessary finance, viz., �30,000,000 which
World Bank experts who made an official estimate of the cost and feasibility of the project
considered was the minimum required to do the job properly. The Government made the
attainment of this loan one of its primary Centenary year projects, and kept negotiating with the
Commonwealth Government until eventually �20,000,000 was promised. The Queensland
Government is spending over �9 million itself in the complete rehabilitation of the Hughenden-
Julia Creek section which is regarded as the weakest link in the railway. The Government has
already let a contract for some �3 million worth of contracts for sleepers, rails, locomotives,
rolling-stock and engineering and survey work.
In May it is expected that construction of earthworks where necessary and the relaying
of the Hughenden-Julia Creek section will begin and between 500 to 1,000 men will be employed.
The Queensland Government had to fight the Commonwealth Government most tenaciously
for over 12 months to obtain the loan money for this project which was so keenly sought by it.
The rehabilitation of the railway is expected to be finished about the same time as Mount
Isa's expansion programme is completed?late in 1964, and not only will it allow the transportation
of more minerals between Mount Isa and Townsville, but it will enable greater tonnages of coal
from Collinsville and Scottville to reach the Mount Isa Smelters as additional loops are being built
between Collinsville and Townsville to allow the passing of much larger coal trains than in the past.
Coal is required in large quantities by Mount Isa Mines Ltd. in its ore reduction furnaces
and the mine is supplied by the State Coal Mine at Collinsville and the two collieries owned bv

Bowen Consolidated Coal Co. at Scottville. The latter company is a subsidiary of Mount Isa
Mines Ltd. and operates an open-cut and underground mine at Scottville.
To complete the whole story of Mount Isa?s giant programme, reference must be made
to the large copper refinery recently opened by the company at Stuart, near Townsville. Here,
too, continued expansion is in progress and will continue until many new copper products are
coming from the production line at the refinery which has provided steady work for many in the
district and will also attract numerous other industries to Townsville. So begins a positive advance
in industrial decentralisation, which is so necessary in this State.
Another gigantic project is steadily moving toward a point when it will be able to assume
more positive, spectacular and virile action.
The recognition in 1956 of the vast potential of bauxite deposits, near Weipa on the west
coast of Cape York Peninsula by a geologist of the Australian Mining & Smelting Co. who was
searching for oil, subsequently resulted in the careful testing of these deposits and the formation
of Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty. Ltd., known as Comalco, and finally the signing
of an agreement between that company and the Queensland Government for the development of
the deposits and later production, at least, of alumina in Queensland.

Preparing Bauxite samples at Weipa for shipment south.
The position now is that the company has been joined by other giant partners from
overseas, and is now engaged on a very accurate survey of possibilities of fuel supply for a future
aluminium works. This survey has included potential resources of the Blair Athol and other
Central Queensland coalfields, the possibility of the hydro-electric resources of the Purari River
in Papua and similar hydro-electric possibilities in the South Island of New Zealand.
In the meantime it seems fairly certain that plans are being advanced for the production
of bauxite in the Weipa area and its possible treatment by a plant erected on the spot to produce
alumina. Such a scheme would involve the spending of some �5O million and include the building
of a modern township at Weipa and the provision of first class port and harbour facilities. The
next few months will indicate more clearly the exact trend of events in this all-important project
to Queensland for its fruition will play a conspicuous part in opening up the whole of this sparsely
populated but defensewise nationally valuable area.
It is also important to know that a large Canadian organisation, Aluminium Laboratories
of Canada, more commonly known as Alcan is steadily continuing its prospecting and testing of
what appear to be important reserves of bauxite in an area adjoining that held by Comalco in the
Weipa area. The Canadians are among the World?s largest producers of aluminium and know the
business thoroughly. To date they have not given any significant indication regarding the
Eight


development of the Cape York area which they at present hold under an Authority to Prospect
granted them by the Government. Should they decide to go ahead, a new spate of activity and
development can be expected in the Peninsula, which will be all to the good of the State.
Uranium will play a much greater part in the further development of the North-Western
spinifex country than it has already done through the establishment of the fabulous Mary Kathleen
mine, treatment plant and garden township. The latter is a veritable oasis in the desert and has
to be seen to be believed.
Within a year or two, however, another important uranium show called ?Anderson?s Lode?
on the Geiger Counter Lease will probably be shaping as a major mining project, while several
other leases around the area between Mount Isa and Cloncurry may also be developed. At the
?Anderson?s Lode? site already very large tonnages of suitable grade ore have been outlined by
diamond drilling and Queensland Mines Ltd., a Korman subsidiary, may develop it for the owners,
Australasian Oil Exploration Ltd., or their successors Kathleen Investments Ltd. for a 50 per cent,
interest. Certain preliminaries such as contracts for the uranium have yet to be settled before this
project can get under way. There is enough substance in the proposed venture to say that it is
another development just waiting round the corner as a future project!

if The next exciting prospect holding early promise of development involves the huge pyrites
dumps at Mount Morgan?the famous hill of gold which has produced hundreds of thousands of
ounces of the precious metal as well as thousands of valuable tons of copper, and many thousands
of ounces of silver, and is still producing a respectable output of gold, silver and copper year by
year from the great open-cut mine which took over when the old mine became an unprofitable
proposition.
Due to the efforts of executives of Mount Morgan Ltd. and given every assistance by the
Queensland Government led by the Premier and Deputy Premier it now appears as though a large
fertiliser industry costing anything up to �9 million may be established in Central Queensland.
It is as yet too early to prophesy the outcome of recent negotiations which have been
given little or no publicity, but it is reasonable to hope that there are distinct possibilities that
a nitrogenous and perhaps ancillary industries may spring up in Central Queensland which is
urgently needing more secondary industries.
There are other possibilities for the future?but these will be discussed more fully in
subsequent pages of this booklet.
From what has been said so far, it is quite safe, I believe, to assume that already the future
of Queensland is indeed bright and full of rich promise.


What Queensland Needs Most
To Speed Its Development ?
Having peeped at the past and glimpsed the future let us for a moment consider the
factors which are of primary importance to the orderly, yet speedy development of this huge,
naturally rich State.
The first essential is population but it is pointless to bring in thousands of new people
unless you can immediately settle them on the land or find gainful employment for them elsewhere.
We need, admittedly, many more new settlers and producers of foodstuffs to supply home and
export markets, but we must ensure that we get the right type of settler who will make good in
a new country like this.
To provide more employment we need more industries, and new secondary industries are
being encouraged by the Government in its campaign to attract overseas investment and industry
to Queensland.
The third essential is a more widespread network of regional electricity for rural centres
so that electric light and power will be available to outback areas and enable them to have more
modern amenities and improvements.
The fourth essential to our more rapid development is the discovery of petroleum which,
our experts are now convinced, exists in commercial quantities within certain areas of the
State?s large sedimentary basins. This is a subject which is discussed more fully in a subsequent
chapter.
? A first-class road system is another vital prerequisite to our most rapid growth and
decentralisation. This is a question to which the Queensland Government is channelling as much
money as possible so that its progressive Main Roads Department can push ahead with the
construction of numerous new and vital roads.
The Government is also pressing the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance
so that much new road building in the North and in other areas in which they are badly required,
will be made available for this essential work.
Decentralisation of industry and population is another important factor in the overall
development of the State. This is a problem which requires much time and serious application and
several sections of the Government Departments are engaged on necessary surveys and preparing
reports for submission regarding possible future action.
Finally, good public relations, both in Australia and abroad are a valuable aid to the
speeding up of the tempo of Queensland?s general progress and development.
We have rich natural resources, we have room in which to expand and absorb many
thousands of new Queenslanders and new industries to keep them happily employed?and we have
a story worth telling to the World!

An Imaginative and Vital Plan
of Road Building
I have at all times endeavoured, as Minister for Development and Main Roads, to keep
my dual responsibilities well in mind and to approach Main Roads problems with as much
commonsense as possible but with a full appreciation of works which will aid the development
of any part of the State more than others.
Consequently, while the requirements of roads carrying the heaviest and most constant
traffic, such as the main Highways to Coolangatta, Wallangarra and Toowoomba, have been met
as far as practicable, the Department has also carried out highly important works such as the
Mulligan Highway, north of Cairns, and the road from Cloncurry to the Mary Kathleen Mine.
During my administration, also, a feature of the Main Roads activities has been the
determined campaign to improve the major roads in North Queensland, such as the Gillies and
Cook Highways, which have been widened. The road west from Charters Towers continues to
be steadily improved and a start has been made on the Stuart-Giru Road.
I have given top priority to the completion of the Highway between Brisbane and Mossman
which is so important to Northern and Central Queenslanders both as road users and as
businessmen. Such roads are also encouraging many new tourists to travel right to the North from
Brisbane by car or tourist coach.
In South-west Queensland, the Main Roads Department is pushing ahead with the great
highways to St. George and Charleville which are so necessary to this section of Queensland.
In fact during the year 1958-1959 the Main Roads Department had a record expenditure
of �7,218,842 on permanent road construction. During the year ended 30th June, 1960, the
Department is pursuing a road and bridge building programme aggregating some �9,000,000.
Roads serve people engaged in many industries and their primary object is to permit the
free flow of traffic from points of raw material supply to processing and manufacturing centres,
from which in turn the finished product flows to the consumer.

-fa Roads also serve to improve communications, open up country to closer settlement and
in all cases the object is to permit the conveyance of materials and goods at the lowest possible
cost to the community.
Another road project which is regarded by the Government as one of very great importance
is the provision of a network of roads in the Channel Country and other far western parts of this
State.
1 shall go so far as to say that we think this is of national importance as the scheme
provides for the construction or improvement of a network of over 1,300 miles of roads radiating
from the railheads at Quilpie, Winton, Dajarra and Yaraka as well as the provisioning of suitable
cattle yards, loading ramps and watering facilities at a cost of �3,300,000.
Because of its national importance the Queensland Government has asked the
Commonwealth Government to assist it financially by matching �1 for �1 spent.
You?ve all heard of the Channel Country?that huge block about the size of the State of
Victoria which is traversed by the great Diamantina and Georgina river channels as well as those
of Cooper?s Creek. After flood rains or in good seasons it is excellent fattening country, but it is
also subject to irregular and often prolonged droughts. The idea behind our big road plan is to
be able to move store cattle quickly by road transport into the Channel Country during its lush
periods, or move them out equally quickly in times of drought.
This would greatly stimulate cattle production in Queensland to a great extent and,
according to some estimates, a system of roads such as we propose building could lift the State?s
cattle breeding industry by between �5 million and �lO million a year. Such a network of roads
would have saved the lives of about 200,000 cattle during the 1958-1959 drought alone!
This scheme will also enable graziers to market their cattle at a much younger age and in
much better condition than they would be if obliged to be travelled by the old droving system.
Under existing conditions, in a dry season cattle cannot be moved at all by hoof, because
the stock routes are closed owing to insufficient water. With a proper road network, however,
a regular flow of cattle could be transported to the meatworks and thus stabilise employment.
The Government is also conscious of the fact that cattle from the Channel Country are
being overlanded to South Australian markets, whereas suitable road facilities would doubtless,
win these cattle to Queensland markets.

Finally, the Government believes that with a gradual improvement of road facilities, more
settlers may be attracted to the rich Channel Country and play a new part in its further
development.
Our Main Roads policy will continue to be directed toward assisting the more rapid
development of all parts of the State, for we believe that good roads are the life-blood of
communication and transportation. These make for continued progress and PROGRESS is the
keynote of our development plan!

The MAGIC
of OIL
In every part of the World in which
oil has been discovered an immediate
transformation in the development and
progress of the country in which it has been
found has followed. ?The Magic of Oil? has
changed the face of deserts in Arabia and
dense jungle and swamp lands in the tropics
and elsewhere and has brought prosperity and
progress to those areas in an amazingly quick
time.
So far Australia has not produced any
natural petroleum, and is spending some
�9O million upwards year by year in importing
crude oil for refining here.
We don?t have to think very hard to
imagine just what the finding of local sources
of crude petroleum would mean to this
country?and to Queensland in particular!
ln this State we possess vast sedimentary
basins which are capable of generating and
storing oil. In other words, we have the
foremost pre-requisite to the successful search
for oil, i.e., huge areas of marine rocks
deeply buried below the surface of the ground. These rocks are known to exist in the Great
Artesian Basin, the Georgina, Carpentaria, Bowen, Ipswich and Maryborough basins and are of
the right geological age to be able to produce oil. It steadily flows through the ground (as does
undergro/.nd water) until it strikes an impervious rock which it cannot penetrate and so it wells
up into a reservoir at and around this point.
The task of the oil geologist and petroleum engineer is to locate by the various exploration
tools at their disposal just where these reservoir traps exist below the surface and drill down to
them to tap their riches.
In a huge State like Queensland this is very difficult and requires much money, time and
effort. The search has been going on in rather a haphazard way for the first fifty odd years, but
more recently has been steadily assuming a more widespread and scientific nature. It began
over 60 years ago in Roma, when a bore being drilled in 1900 for the town water supply struck
gas at a depth of 3,683 ft. and flowed with a pressure of 600 cu. ft. per day, eventually building
up to a maximum flow of 72,000 cu. ft. per day. This bore flowed wild for a number of years,
but in 1906 the citizens of Roma erected a gasholder to collect the gas and reticulate it throughout
the town. For 10 days the town was lit by gas light, then the flow of gas suddenly diminished
and practically disappeared, as did Roma?s hopes of a cheap illumination plant.
Since then, a number of strong flows of gas were struck in wells drilled round Roma.
A significant event in September, 1927, is recorded when Roma Oil Corporation struck an original
flow of 600,000 cu. ft. per day, at a depth in its well ft. This flow later increased to over
1,220,000 cu. ft. per day and the gas was so highly petroliferous that an absorption plant put in
by the company recovered about 30,000 gallons of petrol from the gas between 1928 and 1932.
One of the most notable ones from an exploratory point of view was the well drilled at Arcadia,
Sixteen


north of Roma, and between Injune and Springsure. This well was commenced in August, 1936,
by Oil Search Ltd. and took about three years to complete owing to changing drilling rigs and
other factors, but it did have important shows of oil and gas at various horizons, and struck very
considerable flows of the same type of gas at high pressure from sands at 2,537-2,544 ft.,
2,558-2,5591 ft., and 2,671-2,679 ft. below the surface. At the last depth, the greatest flow of
gas occurred, and came in at a volume of between 3 million and 4 million cu. ft. per day at
a pressure of nearly 500 lb. to the square inch.
When it was tested six months later by the late L. C. Ball, Chief Government Geologist,
and the late Dr. Arthur Wade of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee with a new pressure
gauge and apparatus, the maximum volume of gas was found to be 2,418,000 cu. ft. at a maximum
pressure of 455 lb. per sq. in. When analysed it was shown to be highly petroliferous and
containing the higher homologues of hydrocarbons.
Another important gas strike was made by Associated Australian Oilfields N.L. in 1952
in a well drilled by them at Hospital Hill, Roma. This struck gas at 3,700 ft. which flowed at
the rate of 870,000 cu. ft. per day. The same company struck fair flows of gas in other wells
in the Hospital Hill area but so far no attempt at large-scale commercial production of natural
gas from the Roma field has been made, possibly because of its relative distance from prospective
or possible markets.
? The present Government was quick to realise that if we were to encourage large overseas
companies with plenty of capital and ?know-how? to join the search in Queensland so that a
greater area would be more thoroughly explored, it was essential that conditions, particularly
regarding tenure under Authorities to Prospect should be liberalised as much as possible. A
company taking up a large area under an Authority and guaranteeing to spend a large sum
of money over a period in exploration, naturally would seek the most secure terms of tenure
possible. It was in this way that the large Delhi-Taylor Oil Corporation of Texas was attracted
to enter the search in the Central section of the Great Artesian Basin in Queensland and
become a partner of Santos Ltd. which already held certain areas in the Basin.
This policy has paid off, as since the Delhi-Taylor group entered the search numerous
other large independent American oil exploration companies who are major operators in the
United States, have taken up huge areas of Queensland and will soon enter the search in their
usual direct and vigorous manner.
The accompanying map gives an idea of all the areas held in Queensland under
exploration permits or Authorities to Prospect by both Australian and overseas companies. It
shows that practically nothing of the country with oil-bearing possibilities is left available and
gives an indication of the true extent of the search in the very near future.
At the time of preparing this booklet, Associated Australian Oilfields N.L. with which
is associated Associated Freney Oil Fields N.L. and the Papuan Apinaipi Petroleum Co. Ltd.
have struck a flow of petroliferous gas at 3,700 ft. in its Timbury Hills No. 2 well just outside
Roma. Samples have been taken for testing and drilling is proceeding.
In another area, between Beaudesert and Boonah another rig is being assembled to
begin drilling on the South Moreton anticlinal structure for the Queensland American Oil Co.
At Betoota in the far south-west the largest drilling rig in Australia, a National 130 is
drilling a deep test in the Great Artesian Basin for the Delhi-Santos-Frome Broken Hill group
to test the depth of sediments there and also to seek evidence of gas or oil, or both.
The search will continue, despite disappointments, until success is achieved?and I
believe that by the end of next year we shall have had at least some measure of success?
perhaps even sooner.
I do know that the sooner the magic of oil touches the State of Queensland, the sooner
will the tempo of our development assume a tremendous crescendo.

Progress Follows the Power Lines
OVER the past three years great progress has been made in the electrical development of
Queensland, not only in carrying forward the programme of works which have been
necessary to maintain a continuous supply of electricity to industries, to homes, and
to all consumers, but also in planning the future development of power resources to ensure that
the demand for power in future is met in full.
And this demand is growing at a very rapid rate. Over the past three years the usage
of electricity has increased throughout the State at a rate of approximately 10 per cent, per
annum, and in some areas the rate has been as high as 22 per cent, per annum.
This is because electricity today is spreading into rural areas on an ever-increasing scale
to assist the farmer to provide his family with improved amenities, and to enable him to raise
the general prosperity of the country by increasing primary production.
It is turning the machines in rapidly expanding industries, which in turn are providing
rapidly expanding opportunities for profitable and interesting employment, and for private
investment of capital, and creating greater wealth for Queensland and Queenslanders in all fields.
I am pleased as Minister for Development to have been closely associated with this
great expansion; to be able to record that over the past three years �36,000,000 has been
expended on Queensland?s electrical development, and a total payment of �4,700,000 made in
subsidies by the State Government over the period, principally to assist and stimulate the
electrification of the rural and western areas of the State.
Continuous attention has been given to the development and utilisation of the State?s
power resources.
In North Queensland the great Tully Falls scheme was officially set to work on
21st September, 1957, with two 18,000 kilowatt sets installed. Since then two further sets of
similar size have been installed, the Koombooloomba storage dam brought to practical completion,
and the Cairns and Townsville Regions interconnected by 132,000-volt lines, the highest voltage
yet constructed in the State. The total final cost of this scheme will amount to approximately
�18,715,000 towards which the Government has contributed �3,933,500 by direct subsidy.
Growth of demand for electricity in the North was so rapid that investigations proceeded
immediately into further schemes, and in July, 1958, the Government approved construction of
the new Barron Gorge Hydro Electricity scheme at an estimated cost of �10,817,000, the funds
for this being provided initially by the Government,
Work on this scheme commenced in 1959 and is progressing rapidly, the target date
for completion being early 1963.
At the same time approval was given for an expenditure of approximately �20,000
per annum on an orderly programme of investigation into the hydro-electric possibilities of
further Queensland rivers.
Over the same period new generating plant has been installed in the central power
stations at Mackay, Rockhampton, Howard, and Brisbane, with the result that ample generating
capacity exists in these areas to meet all demands for electricity made upon them. As a result
we are enjoying a period free from blackouts as far as generating capacity is concerned. It is
our intention that every effort shall be made to keep it that way, and without blackouts, industries
which depend upon power for their life-blood can thrive and prosper.
Proof of this is the fact that throughout Queensland today the total estimated cost of
works in hand for the electrical development of the State, some of them nearing completion,
some of them just commencing, exceeds �87,000,000.
In order to secure the most economic electrical development within the areas carrying
large population centres and important rural locations, the State has been divided into six
electricity supply regions. These do not yet include much of the Western areas, although over
the past three years the electrification of these has been rapid and extensive and further surveys
are being made.

at Ingham.
Actually, in the past three years �1,550,000 has been spent on electrical development
of Western areas, including the establishment of new schemes, the extension of existing schemes
and the initiation of supply to a number of areas by transmission line. Government subsidies
were paid on this work over the same period amounting to �714,000.

An aerial view of Tara, a typical Western Queensland township now supplied with electricity.
One very important development in Western Queensland during the last three years has
been the installation of larger generating plant to provide an unrestricted supply of electricity
in a number of smaller towns which previously had been getting restricted supplies from small
generating sets. This development has already taken place in Quilpie, Richmond and Julia Creek
where unrestricted supplies of electricity are now available.
In other Western areas another new development has been the construction of transmission
lines to replace local power stations providing a restricted supply of electricity. As such power
stations are being replaced by transmitted supply, the plant, etc., is being transferred to other
areas to meet increasing demand, thus achieving a maximum in economy and development.
Important transmission lines just completed or under construction to serve Western areas
include from Dalby to Tara; from Roma to Wallumbilla and Yuleba, from Mitchell to Amby,
from the New South Wales system of the North-West Country Council to Inglewood and
Goondiwindi; from Barcaldine to Aramac in Central Queensland and in the South-West from
Mungindi on the New South Wales border to Thallon, Dirranbandi and St. George.
In the North-West approval has been given for the construction of a transmission line
from Mount Isa to Cloncurry and planning is now proceeding.
This programme has marked a new approach to electricity supply in Western
Queensland ?a first important step toward ultimate regionalisation.
The total cost of all works in hand for electrical development in Western Queensland
at present amounts to �3,900,000 and covers the areas of 32 Local Authorities. Further big
plans are in hand to build on the programme for it is felt that it is one of the biggest single
factors in encouraging the growth of population in the areas it serves and halting the drift to
the cities.
Expansion in South-East Queensland has been rapid and approved plans in course of
implementation will cater for the demands in this area until 1966.
Other huge schemes for power for industry and other uses are now being carefully
considered in the light of sources of the cheapest supply of coal fuel for power houses and
other significant factors.
Queenslanders can be assured that all care, wisdom, foresight and proper perspective
will be brought into the consideration of such schemes so that in the long run the continued
upward trend of progress by the State will continue unchecked and unabated.

* Private Enterprise and
Government in Co-operation
The full and successful development of a huge State such as Queensland depends largely
on the active and cordial co-operation of the Government and private enterprise.
In the mineral industry, which covers exploration, mining processing and marketing?
one finds a splendid example of this type of co-operation, as although the industry is largely
conducted by private enterprise the Government also actively assists in a number of ways.
For example, the Government operates State Coal Mines at Collinsville and Styx, a
State Coke Works at Bowen and at Charters Towers the Venus Battery, under lease, and at
Irvinebank, the State Treatment Works is maintained to encourage tin and wolfram production
in the far North.
Again, in recent years the Government has undertaken the assessment of the State?s
coal resources on certain fields and the drilling of specified mineral deposits to assist the
operators of the mines concerned in assessing future ore reserves.
Last year the Department of Mines and Development?s Drilling Branch drilled 381 bores
totalling 94,000 ft. at a cost of about �170,000 and this year are drilling at an even greater rate.
In the coal section, this drilling has proved many thousands of tons of good, workable
coal on the Ipswich and Rosewood fields and has also been successfully employed on the Burrum,
Bowen and Nebo fields. Since coal is the State?s basic raw material for supply to electric power
stations, the finding and proving of workable coal seams is of high priority. Working to a
long-range programme carefully planned after consultation with the State Electricity Commission,
the Queensland Coal Board and the Queensland Geological Survey, departmental drills are
nroving reserves of coal at Ipswich, Rosewood, Howard and Collinsville. Drilling programmes
have just been completed at Acland on the Darling Downs and Nebo, near Mackay. Actually,
the departmental drilling branch has proved more than 150 million tons of coal during its
operations.
Drilling for metalliferous ore deposits is also being given increasing importance and one
drilling plant is operating near Charters Towers in search of gold, lead, copper and other
minerals, while another will soon be operating on the well-known Cracow gold field in Central
Queensland. The Department is also drilling near Brisbane in an effort to locate and prove
useful clay deposits, for brick making and other purposes. With departmental assistance, a
group of gem prospectors near Anakie are operating a power-auger type of drill to locate
workable deposits of wash containing sapphires at depths down to 50 ft. below the surface.
The Government has made more finance available so that the Department of Development
and Mines can purchase further drilling outfits in order to push forward this progressive
exploratory programme in the search for more coal and minerals.
There are other ways by which the Government provides considerable interest to mining:?
(a) It encourages exploration bv large well-equipped organisations by granting of
prospecting permits and authorities to prospect;
(h) It carries out systematic geological mapping in conjunction with the Commonwealth
Bureau of Mineral Resources, to provide basic maps for mineral search. The
mapping of about 120,000 sq. miles, or nearly one-third of the potentially
metalliferous areas of the State has already been completed.
(c) It renders financial aid to promote mining ventures, e.g., a Government advance
enabled Mount Morgan Ltd. to commence operations in 1932 and a Government
guarantee assisted Tableland Tin Dredging N.L. to continue operations at Mount
Garnet in 1952.

Zhuiure;
Every age is marked by new trends, new
methods, change and progress, but the need for
minerals will continue, and possibly accelerate as
the future passes into the present. The trend
of modern civilisation is to require more and
more minerals to supply the needs of industry
following improved metallurgical, mechanical and
processing techniques, which science is steadily
providing.
What great mineral discoveries the ensuing
years will bring is anybody?s guess, but one
thing remains clear ?that is, that Queensland is
so richly endowed with mineral wealth, that
we?ve only scratched the surface so far!
it The Mining industry is then, an industry
with a Future ?for it is destined tc play an even
greater part in Queensland?s future than it has
in the past!
This great industry needs more highly trained
men to take over from those who are growing
old in its service. It needs mining engineers,
metallurgical engineers and geologists?and offers
to such young men useful and adventurous
careers in the search for, exploitation and
development of the State?s vast mineral deposits.
The future then offers an attractive challenge
to young men to fit themselves now to qualify
for these professional careers and help to build
still greater things for this rich heritage which
Queensland holds for its citizens both today and
in the future.
