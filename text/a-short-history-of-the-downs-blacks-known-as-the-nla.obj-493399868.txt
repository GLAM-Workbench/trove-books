PREFACE
In placing the contents of this book before my readers I must ask
them to remember that the matters referred to are those which were in
existence before the effects of the contact with the white men had
broken down the “Bora”, and do not refer to late years. It deals with the
pure unalloyed laws of a black race who were not cannibals, and I have
often thought placed Socialism on a higher plane than the white
people can ever hope to bring it with their gold and their tainted
Civilisation.
Writing up scenes which happened over 50 years ago may seem an
easy thing to a young mind, but when one takes the memory back it
calls up so many happenings that it is almost impossible to commit all
to paper. That, in my opinion, is what prevented the old pioneers
writing up a full account of life in the early days.

A SHORT HISTORY OF THE
“CANNING DOWNS” ABORIGINES KNOWN AS
THE “BLUCHER” TRIBE
Unfortunately no attempt was made in the earlier days, when the
Darling Downs was first occupied by the white man, to write up a
record of the manners and customs of this fine tribe of blacks by those
well able to do so, and so I find myself now making an effort to do this
rather than let the subject become a complete blank. Under the
circumstances I regret that the task has not fallen to abler hands than
mine.
KING “BLUCHER’S” TERRITORY
When Patrick Leslie came to the Downs for the first time, in 1840, he
was not accompanied by any of his brothers. After picking out the
country he fancied, which afterwards became Canning Downs and
Toolburra Stations, he returned to Sydney with his faithful servant and
comrade, Peter Murphy, and secured the country. Before returning to
the Darling Downs Patrick Leslie called on the Governor of New South
Wales who was a personal friend of his. The interview being finished
Leslie was saying good-bye when his Excellency asked if there was
anything he could do for him. “Yes”, said Leslie, “may I ask for the
pardon of my faithful friend Peter Murphy”. The Governor at once
consented. Peter, therefore, returned a “free” man and remained with
the Leslies until they left the Darling Downs. When Patrick returned
with his stock his elder brother George accompanied him. George had
a slight impediment in his speech and was of a retiring nature;
consequently Patrick took the lead in all business matters. George
chose Canning Downs; and Patrick, Toolburra. Walter and William
Leslie, the younger brothers, went to India but a few years afterwards
paid a visit to George and Patrick. This was the first time they saw


Canning Downs and, as a memento of their visit, they brought the
celebrated Arab stallion, Tommy, which was a present to their brothers.
When Patrick and George settled down they found that an old
aboriginal was the King of the country they had selected or occupied.
Moreover, he and his tribe were friendly disposed towards the white
man, and this friendship became so firmly established that it was never
broken. On more than one occasion the Leslies were threatened with
extermination by the Maclntyre River blacks, but the Canning Downs
tribe always warned the Leslies and, possibly out of consideration for
their coming to the rescue, Patrick Leslie named the old King
“Blucher”. “Blucher’s” family consisted of Derby (whose wife was a
Maclntyre River gin, and a black virago), Toby, Tommy, Nancy, and
Mary Anne. Derby was always pronounced “Darby”, and I shall use that
form in my notes.
“Blucher”, through old age had to resign the Kingship, and the tribe
appointed his eldest son “Darby” as King. I can never forget the object
lesson of filial devotion and affection given to white people by the sons
of this old King who, 3 years before he died, was unable to walk. The
sons made a rough ambulance litter of a sheet of bark in which they
placed the old King’s opossum rug, and earned their father hundreds
of miles backwards and forwards over the Range. The old man finally
died within sight of the spot where his splendid son Tommy was shot
by Inspector Wheeler’s “Black Lambs”. It is not necessary for me to
refer further to this unfortunate and regrettable occurrence which
ended in Tommy’s death further than to say it took place quite close to
Fassifem Station in the Munbilla district.
THE BORA
As this ceremony formed the bedrock foundation of the laws and
ailes which kept the tribe together, it can be easily understood that


directly the pressure of the white man weakened the functions, and the
blackfellow could no longer exercise them, the tribe literally went to
pieces. Knowing the aboriginal as I did in the early fifties, and late
sixties, one could hardly imagine that they could have become so
degraded in such a short space of time. When I first became acquainted
with them in the year 1853 at the Canning Downs Washpool they were
very honourable if treated fairly and kindly, and no man ever saw King
Darby drunk. I have, however, seen tears running down his cheeks at
the sight of his men taking grog.
I shall now tell my readers how I managed to see the Bora ground
also give the description of the same, which was where this tribe’s final
ceremony was held in the year 1858. The site of this was at Killamey, on
the south side, where the late Mr Charles Mclntosh and Mr J. Dumigan
erected their first saw mill. My father and brother were erecting the first
traffic bridge over the Condamine River for the late Mr Fitzallen, at
Killamey, between the old farm and the Old Watermill Dam and I was
sent out to look for decking for the bridge. I started on horseback alone
for Spring Creek. At that time there was not a tree fallen above Killamey
township, and the Blue Gums on Spring Creek looked grand. As the
late Mr Fitzallen was a man of the same solid principles as most of the
old pioneers I thought that he would not put Blue Gum decking on the
bridge as he really believed in no timber except ironbark. When riding
along admiring the timber about 11 a.m. it gradually became very dark.
I noticed the birds were all flying towards their roosts. As we had no
newspapers to give us an idea of coming events I could not imagine
what was happening to the sun, and in a very short time it became quite
dark. I had never seen an eclipse before this.
When I was sent out to find timber my orders were to look for Box or
Iron-wood, so I rode along the edge looking for Iron-wood when
suddenly I came upon a covered-in avenue leading into the scrub. As
the blacks had previously given me a description of the Bora ground I


at once came to the conclusion that this must be the sacred place they
called the Bora ground ; and having heard old hands say that no white
man or black gin had ever seen the Bora ground when the ceremonies
were to take place made me very inquisitive to get a good look at the
place. However, as I had been told by the old blackfellows that they
would kill a white man if he came near the Bora ground at that
particular time I was rather afraid, but remembering a little incident
which had occured a few days previously, this gave me the confidence
that they would not kill me, which incident I shall now relate: -
The Sunday morning before this I was running in the late Mr George
Burgess’s draught horses, a short distance above the Old Watermill
Dam which was running strong at the time; and seeing a lot of black
piccaninnies (children) clapping their hands and making a loud noise
I cantered over to see what was the matter. The first thing I saw was a
little, chubby, fat piccaninny floating down the stream just above the
breast of the dam; and in a few minutes the little one would have been
washed over the dam and dashed to pieces. I immediately jumped off
the horse, plunged into the water and caught hold of the child, but the
moment I did this the piccaninnies on the bank thought I was going to
kill it and screamed so much that in a few seconds there was a
stampede of gins down the hillside like a mob of emus. By the time
they got down I had reached the bank which was very steep and
slippery; but being handicapped with the wet clothes and boots I had
great difficulty in getting up, so some of the gins took the child from
me and held it down or up by the legs, allowing the water to run out of
its mouth and nostrils; and in a very short time it was right. Needless to
say the gins were very grateful to me; and in my own youthful way I
thought the incident gave me a claim to the tribe’s sympathy and
protection, which I afterwards found to be the case
At all events I hung my horse up and approached the entrance with
great caution, expecting a spear at any moment, but I never saw a
blackfellow. I always thought the darkness coming so suddenly in the
middle of the day had the effect of frightening them as the blacks are


naturally very superstituous at any time.
The entrance to the Bora ring was about 7 feet wide and 8 feet high
having a large tree at either side with the rough bark taken off and
made very smooth. All kinds of animals were painted on the trees in a
rough way with raddle, pipe clay, and emu oil. On the right hand tree
was a drawing of a ship in full sail, the one on the left having an animal
representing the Bunyip or Mochel Mochel, also some huge men with
all kinds of animals painted on their bodies indicating some sacred
symbols in connection with their laws, similar to the sign of the Zodiac,
the meaning of which I never could find out. The centre ring was about
7 feet high, with their tops all bound round with ti-tree bark about the
size of a man’s head. These poles represented the number of young
men that were to pass through the Bora ceremonies. Each pole or post
bore the distinct mark belonging to each “Kippa” (or youth), and the
Councillors knew which Kippa belonged to the different posts. This all
signified order and system.
The centre ring was formed the same as a circus ring, only they had
an outside ring about 8 feet wide. The Kippas all stood in the outside
ring, each youth alongside his own pole. The King and his Councillors
stood in the centre ring watching every movement of the young men
and teaching the art of fighting while a number of men were placed on
sentry around the Bora ground with instructions to kill any man, white
or black, who did not belong to their own tribe. The Bora ceremonies
only lasted about 3 days. The first day every art in fighting was taught,
particularly how to use the Helimon, a shield which was about 2 feet 6
inches long, and one foot wide, with a hand hold at the back. It was
made of timber from the stringing tree which is very light and tough
and would stop any spear; but the war boomerang would split it. The
second day was the easiest day as the Kippas had nothing to do but
listen to the Councillors’ instruction and advice. The first thing they
were taught was to be brave; and the second was to be truthful as


practically all of their messages were carried by word of mouth. This
was a most important command which a good black who had passed
through the Bora would never break. On this day they were also taught
all of the laws belonging to the tribe, and for the first time the full
significance of the “Muddlo” was explained, this I describe later on.
The third day was the day they were most afraid of, as it was then that
they had to stand the test against practically every weapon they made
use of in all their fights.
Opposite every post around the outside ring was a clear track out in
the scrub 40 yards long; and every Kippa had to stand at his post
straight in line with his 40 yards track so that it would be impossible to
get anything to shelter him from behind. All he had to protect himself
with was his Helimon. Each of the best men in the tribe, together with
the Councillors, or the Umpires as we would call them, were placed at
the end of the 40 yards in the scrub with practically every weapon they
used in war which were thrown at the young men, and consisted of
spears, boomerangs, and nulla nullas. In the event of the Kippas
allowing any weapon to draw blood they were condemned as fighting
warriors on the decision of the Umpires, as it was possible for a back
liner to be hit accidentally. The duties of the condemned Kippas were
to strip bark to make gunyahs for the aged members and generally
attend to their wants until such time as they did something which was
considered brave. Then they would get another chance in their own
tribe. This, in my opinion, was the weakest point of this tribe’s laws as it
caused them to be looked upon as cowards and no woman outside
their tribe would marry them. Consequently they usually turned out
criminals or sneaked into another tribe and got a second chance of
passing through the Bora. Should they, however, succeed they had the
privilege of getting back to their own tribe if the King gave his consent,
thus getting their tribal mark; but this matter rested entirely in the
King’s hands. After the Bora was over the young men were called
Kippas, and the King, with his own hands, tied a native dog’s tail


around their heads. That was the proudest day in their lives for the
simple reason that they could call themselves men and had the
privilege of getting married, if a woman chose to ask them, on
completion of the tribal mark and tattooing. No man ever proposed
marriage. Any aboriginal who was crippled, or suffered from a
deformity at birth, was never admitted to the Bora. During the 3 days
test the Kippas made an absolute fast and were under the complete
surveillance of the Councillors.
At the conclusion of the test in the Bora Ring each warrior teacher
brought his Kippa at midnight, or as near that time as they could guess,
to an appointed deep waterhole which was out of hearing of the
female and other members of the tribe. A fire was then made near the
water’s edge and each teacher placed a firestick in it so as to be ready to
throw it into the water after his boy had been submerged. As soon as
the sticks were properly alight the Kippa entered the water and was
submerged three times. After this he walked towards the water’s edge
where he stood in absolute silence with the water up to his armpits.
While here the teacher threw his firestick into the water where the
Kippa had dipped; and if the smoke from it went straight up into the air
the King lectured him to continue in the way he had been going and
always to respect the King and the tribe’s laws which would make him
a credit to the tribe. Should smoke curl or twist about on the surface of
the water it was looked upon as a bad omen, in that he would be
deceitful and not trustworthy if not always on his guard; and for that
reason was cautioned to be always on the alert and to obey the tribe’s
laws, otherwise he would die. This part of the Bora ceremony was
always kept a close secret from the Kippas and they never had the
faintest idea until they had witnessed it at the water-hole. This
superstition held a profound grip on their minds and had a great
influence in their lives, bearing on the laws of the tribe. Possibly there
are still members of the white community who, sixty or seventy years


ago, have seen the aboriginals throwing their fire sticks into the
Brisbane River in front of the steamer they were travelling on. This was
to test whether the white people could be trusted or otherwise, in
harmony with the tribe’s superstition.
As far as I could leam from the King (Darby) there was an equally
strict test carried out by the female Councillors of this tribe, regarding
the duties of the females from womanhood. This test was under
supervision of the King’s wife (or gin). More than this I never knew.
TRIBAL MARK AND TATTOOING
After passing through the Bora there was still another severe test to
complete entrance to the tribe as a full fledged man, viz., to get the
tribal mark, as well as being tattooed. After these operations had been
completed the native dog’s tail would be discarded. The “Blucher”
tribal mark was a hole through the division of the nostrils. This hole
was made by using a very sharp pointed bone on the last night of the
Bora ceremonies. This completed, the Kippas had a week’s rest before
being tattooed.
Previous to the advent of the white man, the tattooing was done by
using the sharp edge of a sea-shell; after that broken glass was used to
cut the flesh. The process was for the Kippas to lie on their stomachs on
the ground with a piece of currajung timber in their mouths, which
they gripped between their teeth to prevent them from crying out.
Should they do this they were at once called cowards an insinuation
they detested. I believe that they would stand being cut to pieces
before giving a whimper. They were a hardy race; and their blood must
have been pure for the wounds to heal so quickly. After their bodies
had been tattooed they filled the wounds with ashes and some kind of
oil which caused the wounds to fester and make proud flesh grow over
them, giving the appearance of lumps. This completed, they were
eligible to be chosen as husbands by their brunette admirers.


LAWS
I now propose to place before my readers a few facts regarding some
of the laws of this tribe of aboriginals; and would ask the thoughtful,
educated, and wise to think over them and compare them with what
they see amongst a civilized, intelligent, educated and Christian
community. I have no hesitation in venturing the opinion that they will
see much to appreciate in the efforts of a race of aboriginals savages,
cut off from all intercourse with the outside world for thousands of
years, to keep up the standard of a strong, virile race, and the natural
laws regarding the internal management working up to that point.
Knowing those men as I did in the very earliest days, before they had
become tainted with the objectionable surroundings of a civilized
people; knowing the object of the Bora ceremonies; and seeing the
symbols on the trees at the Bora ring, I could not help thinking that at
some far back age the original people knew something of the ground
work of the Mosaic Laws, and the signs of the Zodiac. The more I think
over these and compare them with our present day social life the more
I am forced to the conclusion that if ever we hope to become a strong
nation, combining all that is good and rejecting all that has a tendency
to eat into the vitals of our everyday life, we are yet in a position to take
a few hints from the teachings of the despised Australian blackfellow.
No. 1. The King did not inherit his position by descent, but by
proving to the people that he was the best all round man in the tribe
embracing strength of character, manliness, truthfulness, reliability,
and generally a man to be looked up to with respect. The King’s duty
was to see that the laws of the tribe were carried out according to the
recognised customs of the tribe. He decided all disputes and his
decision was final. The King always appointed his own Councillors,
who were the best men in the tribe. Should he have brothers they were
made Councillors. The King had to be a married man.


No. 2. The councillors were appointed by the King; and in the event
of the King’s death the Councillors chose the next King from among
themselves; but he had to be a married man. The rank and file of the
tribe placed all their grievances before the Councillors who inquired
into them and settled trivial matters; but important matters were
placed before the King who, with his Councillors, decided what was to
be done. Once the King’s decision was given the Councillors attended
to the rest.
No. 3. As regards the marriage laws, they were quite different from
those of the white people. The “Blucher” tribe had the three divisions
of relationships which seemed to be recognized by all Australian
aboriginal tribes. I know they were most particular about their
marriage laws when members of the tribe inter married, which was
rare. It was, however, penal for cousins to marry. The woman had the
privilege of proposing marriage to the man but always through a
female friend or relative. The man never proposed. If the man refused
the offer he at once disappeared. These proposals were always made
immediately after the corroborees where the woman had the
opportunity of seeing the men from other tribes and picking out their
choices. As a matter of fact it was “Leap Year” all the time for the belles
of this tribe. If the man was agreeable, a time and trysting place was
arranged, through the third party of course, which sometimes took a
considerable time to fix up. Suddenly the gin disappeared and for
three weeks with her husband kept to the bush on their honeymoon,
when the husband took his wife to his own tribe. If any member of his
tribe objected to the marriage he had the privilege of fighting the
newly married man; and the same applied to the wife’s relatives but in
their case they had to go to the husbands tribe and fight there. Under
these conditions the visitor received a safe permit provided there was
no old grievance. After the fight the visitor returned but never brought
the woman back if he won.


I have known cases of jealousy in these marriages but I should say
not to the same extent as with white people. Jealousy was unknown
before marriage as there was no courtship. Widows and elderly gins
who had not the same opportunities of marriage could marry the men
who foiled to pass the Bora tests; but this was not at all a common
practise.
No. 4. If any man or woman committed adultery or murder within
their own tribe they were immediately condemned to death and had to
escape to another tribe or suffer the extreme penalty. If, however, a
man or woman murdered a member of an adjoining tribe, their own
tribe protected them. This left it to the adjoining tribe to retaliate and
kill the murderer if possible or, failing this, any other member of the
same tribe at the first opportunity. This, in the writer’s opinion, was a
weak spot as it always led up to tribal fights; and in comparison with
our present day brought about very much the same position as that of
Serbia and Austria.
No. 5. Breaking any of the moral laws, except murder and adultery,
was excused twice, with a caution, and on the third occasion the
extreme penalty would be carried out at the first opportunity and
without any warning. Knowing this, the culprit always, when possible,
escaped to another tribe and took his or her chance with them always
remembering that the tribal mark laid them under suspicion. To a great
extent the Native Police were recruited from such men; and the latter
took every opportunity, under the protection of the uniform, to carry
out their villainy with other tribes. When this became unbearable to
their officers they invariably absconded and then encouraged the other
aboriginals with whom they mixed to carry out murders of the whites
or outrages on the white women.
No. 6. As no execution could be carried out without the consent of
the King, it was usual after this had been given for his Councillors to


find a suitable spot for execution. This was generally chosen on the
edge of a scrub or a thickly timbered ridge. The victim was always
included in a hunting party forming the last group which was
composed entirely of Councillors; and, when his position was close to
a large hollow tree which had previously been selected, he was killed
by the man following using his tomahawk and opening the skull. No
one but the Councillors witnessed the execution, a climbing vine was
always used to put around the victims neck, by which he was drawn up
and dropped into the hollow tree. Not a word was spoken by the
executioners during the proceedings. The hunt went on as if no
execution had taken place and was, in my opinion, a very humane way
of despatching criminals.
No. 7. The burial of the dead was strictly carried out on hard and fast
lines. Only the law-abiding members of the tribe were, at death, buried
in the ground with full tribal ceremonies. Criminals and lawbreakers
were always placed in hollow trees. As regards the law-abiding
members, the manner in which the trees adjoining and leading to the
grave were tattooed by tomahawks indicated whether the grave was
that of a male or female, also if the former was a King, as follows: Fora
King each tree was marked on the inside facing each other, that is right
and left along the track the corpse was carried. As well as that, every
alternate tree bore a distinctive mark allotted to Kings only, which was
always placed above the tattoo marks. For a Councillor the same marks
were given except that his distinctive mark was placed by itself on the
opposite side of the tree. Men were always buried between two large
trees. For a woman the trees along the track were tattooed only on the
left hand side of the tree, with a distinctive mark for the Queen, above
the ordinary tattoo marks. These distinctive marks always impressed
upon me the supposition that they had as their origin some reference
to religious symbol such as the “Trinity”. In passing, I may add that this
information was given to me by a Councillor who showed me the
tattoos on a tree leading up to the grave of a member of his tribe, and


whom in life, I knew personally. To be thoroughly understood the
trees should be seen. After the body was buried a post or stake was
placed at the head of the grave, which signified that no member of the
tribe was to hunt or kill game within sight of the grave for twelve
moons. It always struck me as having a distant connection with the
origin of the present practise of Chinese in placing food on the graves
of their dead.
No. 8. No boys or girls were allowed to associate together. After the
boys were 6 or 7 years of age they had to camp with the young fellows
who had not been through the Bora ceremonies.
No. 9. The girls remained in their parents’ camp until they were from
7up to 8 years of age. After that they had to camp with the old women
and widows.
No. 10. It was the duty of the old women and widows to teach the
girls to cook the food and train the children, also to make dilly bags of
all kinds (used to carry their food, etc.), kangaroo and wallaby nets and
particularly opossum skin rugs, as every member of the tribe had one
of these.
No. 11. From the time the boys went into camp by themselves they
were regularly trained by the men who had gone through the Bora in
the arts of hunting, tracking, the use of all implements of war, and the
methods of attack and defence.
No. 12. When camped near water the sexes were not allowed to
bathe together. The males were allowed to bogey in the forenoons and
the females in the afternoons. Any breach of this rule meant death to
the offender. Every aboriginal from childhood was taught to swim.
Further than this each child was taught the art of rescuing a drowning
person; and my experience taught me that is was almost impossible for


the weak person to get away from a stronger one.
No. 13 ■ The law regarding fighting among themselves was that if two
men had an argument which could not be settled the King at once
ordered them to fight it out, during which no person was allowed to
interfere until one was seen to have had enough; then the best man
had to cease at once. Should, however, he persist he was at once
knocked down with a nulla nulla. If a young man and an old man had a
quarrel the old man could use a knife, but not the young man until he
could produce a grey hair in his head. If neither man would fight then
they had broken the King’s instructions, the King walking away;
whereupon the Councillors immediately took control, which
practically meant that the brawlers had been silenced and knew what
the result would be if they persisted, such as indicated in No. 6. As a
rule Kings only fought Kings of other tribes and never fought with, or
drew blood from, any member of their own tribe.
No. 14. No young man was allowed in a married man’s camp; but if a
married man wanted to interview a single man on any subject he could
go into the single man’s camp and converse as long as he chose.
No. 15. The men who foiled to pass the Bora tests had to strip bark for
the gunyahs of the old men, women, and widows, also for themselves.
These men held no standing in the councils of the tribe.
CORROBOREE
After the tattoo marks on the Kippas had quite healed the tribe began
to prepare for a large corroboree which usually followed one of these
functions. The Kippas were now allowed to hunt side by side with the
best men in the tribe. The King picked out a certain number of men
and sent them out in different directions, some to get plain turkeys,
others scrub turkeys and Wonga pigeons, others fish and any kind of


game that came in their way. They had instructions to bring in as much
as they could enough to carry the whole tribe and any visitors
through for two or three days, on the basis of share and share alike. This
was pure socialism. This part of the programme being ready the
corroboree began after dark and took the form of a kind of dance by the
men, commencing about 7 p.m., and continuing until midnight. These
men had all passed the Bora.
The women sat on the ground with their opossum rugs drawn tightly
over their legs and beat time on broken boomerangs and sang to an
accompaniment resembling the music of muffled drums. The men
were all painted alike with pipe clay and put one in mind of a regiment
of Highlanders dressed in tartan, particularly the legs. Their hair was
put up in a large knob on top of their heads with three frills of different
coloured feathers surmounted by a dozen white cockatoo feathers.
These represented their crown of honour, an emblem of purity, and
they would sooner die than dishonour it. You could not insult them
more than by soiling these feathers. They would kill you on the spot.
The old gins always had the place of honour in the front row, at the
men’s backs as they were dancing; and the younger people in the
background all beating tunes on the opossum rugs or clicking two
broken boomerangs together, which was a sight worth seeing,
particularly when several hundred men took part. Those men were as
straight as trained soldiers, all active athletes as full of bravado as the
best white men, at times appearing intoxicated with excitement. To
the white observer the corroboree seemed to be always the same
that is, the movements of the men; but as a matter of feet there were as
many variations in the different corroborees as there are when white
people are playing different pieces of music. The corroborees were
representations of the aboriginal methods of killing their enemies as
well as every form of hunting and capture of game. In other words, they
gave the same enjoyment to the aboriginals as our best operas do to us.


The new corroborees were eagerly sought after by the different
friendly tribes and carried, as I shall indicate further on. The composers
held the same position as ours do in the public estimation.
GOOD-BYE
The next morning the scene is changed as the visiting tribes prepare
to take their departure for their own happy hunting grounds. This is the
time the gins show their affection for each other, standing in groups of
from five to eight, with their arms around one another, resting their
heads on the shoulders and breasts of those they love the best, sobbing
and crying in the most piteous way. This reminded me of a scene
witnessed in the United Kingdom over sixty years ago at the departure
of an emigrant ship for the Colonies.
Before starting in the morning there was a general consultation
among the heads of families as to what distance they would travel and
where they would camp for the night. This was a matter the gins had to
decide and it took some time to settle the business. The men on all
occasions left this to the coloured ladies; and often caused a good
deal of difference in opinion and sometimes ended in unpleasantness,
as the younger people had less to carry than those with young children.
So the latter usually fixed their distance to suit the old women and men
who could not walk as well as younger members.
While the young men were travelling it was their duty to secure as
much food as possible for the night. The lads usually got what old
bushmen called “sugar-bag”or “cubi”, the aboriginal name for a
beautiful clear honey made by the Australian stringless bee, which the
piccaninnies were very fond of. As the shades of night came on they all
drew into camp and fires were lit to prepare the evening meal.


METHOD OF LIGHTING FIRE
Lighting a fire on a cold wet night in the bush is sometimes a great
difficulty to practical white bushmen, with matches; but on this point,
as on many others, the blackfellow excels the white man, as nature
provides him with matches without his own making. They get the old
grass-tree top that is decayed, dry inside, and hollow, and by the quick
action similar to sponging a fowling piece, friction is caused which
makes fire in a few minutes. I have known bushmen in the early days in
the “Blucher” country to get great relief, indeed be saved from
suffering, by this form of fire making.
METHOD OF COOKING FOOD
The blacks roasted all of their food on the coals and in the ashes,
with a yam stick, about 18 inches in depth, into which they put rough
stones and made a large fire over the top of the hole. The hot ashes and
coals felling down through the stones made them red hot. The heat
from the stones cooked the fish in a very short time after they were laid
on top of the stones. They had no utensils of any kind for cooking food;
and they never drank any water until they had eaten their food. As a rule
they were very fond of fresh meat and mutton but had a great prejudice
against salt meat as they were so accustomed to eating everything fresh,
and had no taste for salt. The food the gins prepared for the young
children consisted of scrub yams which, when dug out of the ground,
were very much like sweet potatoes but much drier when roasted in
the ashes.
NATIVE BREAD
The only food this tribe had to represent bread was made from the
cunjevoy, a very poisonous plant when not cooked, as many a white


bushman knows to his sorrow. I knew one white man who died from
tasting it. The blacks were very fond of this root but few would take the
trouble to prepare it properly because it took a long time and a great
deal of patience to do this. In appearance it is very like arrowroot but
looked so nice and juicy, with a large bulb very like a white turnip, that
it would tempt a person to taste; but if he did so, the result was
disastrous. The tongue swells instantly, and the eyes stand out of the
head as if one was going mad, while the pain is intense. It grows in the
mountain scrubs. In conversation with my old and respected friend the
late Dr A. O. H. Phillips, I asked him if he had ever seen this plant. He
said he had not but he had had a case of a man from the bush suffering
from the effects of tasting it; and he told me the man died in the
hospital, the inflamation having gone down his windpipe on to the
lungs. The blackfellow’s method of preparing it was to peel off the
outer skin and then pound it down with a flat stone on a clean rock at
the edge of a running stream where it could be well washed. This
helped to take the poison out, while cooking in the ashes removed the
last traces of poison. As it took from three to four hours to prepare this
food the young people would not go to the trouble, so it usually fell to
the old people to do this work. The paste would then be worked up
into small dampers about six inches in circumference by an inch and a
quarter in thickness. These they would put into the hot ashes, covering
them up in the same way as we would a damper so as to prevent the air
getting in to bum them. When taken out of the fire one could scarcely
tell the difference in appearance from the real damper. I have tasted
them but cannot recommend the food. It tastes very much like bread
made from bran and pollard. The aboriginals were very fond of it,
soaked in water, and gave it to their children.
WAR AND HUNTING IMPLEMENTS
No. 1. The Fighting Boomerang: it will be noticed that I have always
used the word “Boomering” not “Boomerang”, because the latter


word was a white man’s “Cockneyism”.
The fighting bommering is a larger, flatter and heavier weapon than
the others of the same name, slightly bevelled on the one side. It was
always used where great force was required. When thrown it skims
along at an even angle above the ground about the height of a man’s
chest. I never saw a “Helimon” used against this vicious weapon. The
blackfellow’s mode of escape was to throw himself flat on the ground.
This weapon was always used in war, also for killing kangaroos, emus,
and dingoes.
No. 2. The Game Boomering: these were used for killing all kinds of
flying game.
No. 3. The Sporting Boomering: this was much lighter than either of
the above and required skill in making. The fire and stream principle of
bending to bring it to the proper angle was employed. When
completed it was slightly longer at one end, and in shape was more of a
half circle than the other two. This weapon could be thrown so as to
complete a circle and come back to the thrower’s feet. These weapons
were used to train the Kippa candidates and younger boys in the art of
throwing and making boomerings.
SPEAR
No. 1. Spear: this was a large barbed weapon usually from eight to
nine feet long with three barbs, two on one side, and one on the other.
This was used in tribal fights and for spearing large fish. It was made
from myall timber.
No. 2. Spear: this was similar to No. 1. only not barbed. One end was
finer than the other and was specially meant for spearing large
kangaroos. The big end was used for rougher and heavier work. I have


known a man to go into the bush with this spear and within two hours
return with the skin of the largest kangaroo and as much of the carcase
as he required.
No. 3. Spear: this was lighter made and was barbed. It was used for
spearing fish. It was usually from seven to eight feet long, and was also
used for spearing small game. Any spears that were barbed were only
barbed at one end so as to make it possible to take them out from
anything speared.
NULLA NULLA
No. 1. Nulla Nulla: a very heavy weapon similar to the old war clubs
used by our ancestors. It was made from the toughest and heaviest
timbers, weight being essential. After the advent of the white man,
hobnails were driven into the head of this nulla nulla in rows as close
as possible for a distance of three inches from the top. This was indeed
a ferocious weapon, always being used at short arm work and was
never thrown.
No. 2. A similar weapon but lighter. It was principally used in the
kangaroo hunts. It was used for close work or could be thrown. In the
hands of a strong man it was a deadly weapon.
No. 3- A much smaller weapon than either of the preceding. This was
always thrown at wallabies and was much lighter and finer in the
handle. When in the hands of an expert it was usually thrown so that
the smaller end struck the animal and passed through the body.
MUGGIN OR STONE TOMAHAWK
This was made from the blue metal or Whinstone to be found in our
basalt country about the mountain precipices. This was the hardest of


all implements to make as it required a lot of grinding in rough
sandstone rock at the edge of the water. It was also difficult to cut the
groove about the centre of the weapon to hold the vine, which was
usually put on so as to tie on the handle similar to that of a blacksmith’s
cold iron cutter. The material used to complete the tying on of the
handle was leather-wood bark cemented with the gum of the pine tree
and opossum hair. When this was completed it took a very long time to
complete. When finished it would not, at the very best, cut timber and
was not at all a desirable implement or tool with which to square
timber. There were two kinds of tomahawks, one for stripping bark,
with a longer handle than the other, and much lighter.
EAGLE’S CLAW
Prior to the advent of the white man’s knives, this tribe used the
dried claw of the eagle hawk for a close infighting weapon. When
securely tied to a short handle, just sufficient to get a hold, it tore the
body in a frightful way. Our present day shoemaker’s knife displaced
the eagle’s claw.
HELIMON OR SHIELD
This weapon was used for precisely the same purpose as that of our
ancient European warriors. It was made out of stringing tree wood,
which was very light and soft but tough and was about 2 x k feet long and
from 10 to 12 inches wide, according to the strength of the man using
it. In appearance it was very like the shell of the fresh water turtle
without the head and legs, only much larger and thicker. On the centre
of the inside flat surface a hand-hold was cut out, next to the body of
course. Armed with one of these the warrior could defend himself
against any aboriginal weapons except the fighting boomering which
on all occasions would split the Helimon after the second blow. But
the spear, nulla-nulla, and stone tomahawks could be warded off


easily. Once the Helimon was disabled the aboriginal warrior had to
rely upon the trees for shelter, or whatever else he could obtain.
BATTLE AXE
There was another dangerous weapon, the name of which I now
forget. In appearance it was very like the common morticing axe and
was made entirely of wood. The handle was anything up to IV2 inches
thick, the blade being about 2 x h inches wide, sharpened at the point
and both sides like the edge of a boomering. It used to make me think
of the pictures of the old battle axe, only it was lighter and longer.
OTHER IMPLEMENTS
The Climbing Vine : The vine used for climbing trees quickly was
about three quarters of an inch thick and usually about nine feet long,
unless required for very thick trees when it was longer. In appearance it
was similar to a grape vine at the base, throwing out limbs of all sizes
and lengths which could be used for all purposes. Before a vine was
used it was thoroughly tested against a strong young tree by looping it
around like a rope, two men grasping either end and pulling the tree
with all their strength. If the vine stood this test it was considered safe
for any use at any height. The thinner vine was used for climbing after
game or “sugar-bags” (wild honey). When using the vine the
aboriginal, male or female, made a knot at one end which they held
and, placing the vine around the tree, immediately began climbing by
pressing their feet against the tree, raising the vine from different
positions as they ascended. When high enough up they cut a nick or
notch in the tree and, after giving the vine a turn once around the calf of
the leg, secured the right hand end in this nick between the toes by
pressing the foot into the nick, thus freeing the right hand to use the
tomahawk.


They were very expert at stripping bark for gunyahs and showed
great science in performing that work, bringing down as many as six
sheets from the one tree by expert use of the vine without injuring a
single sheet. As very few people know what this means I shall try to
describe it, although it should be seen to be properly understood. The
native knows that the top bark of the tree is thinner than that at the
bottom; and begins operation at the top by going up sometimes forty
feet. After the sheets have been cut top and bottom and once up the
centre in lengths of about six feet they are gradually loosened from the
sap of the tree by the handle of the tomahawk. The aboriginal then
shifts round to the back of the cut and, prizing up the bottom end from
resting on that of the tree, gets the sides on to his vine and, in a series of
jerky movements, descends with his load to the ground. In comparison
the white man could only strip two sheets and cannot compare with
the aboriginal.
NATIVE BUCKET OR COOLAMAN
Before the white man came on the scene with his tinware the
aboriginal had to invent something to carry water when travelling in
waterless country between camps. For this purpose he used the joints
of the palm tree which grows on top of the main range. This tree was
cut in lengths about the size of a paint or putty tin, the bottom being the
original joint division of the tree which runs through from side to side.
Larger buckets could be made according to fancy. To carry these
coolamans a hole was burned and worked into each side by any thing
hard; and a tough vine made into a handle. Besides carrying the water
for drinking, it was always necessary to have it in case of snake bite
when it was used for rinsing out the mouth as described elsewhere.
HUNTING GAME AND DISTRIBUTION OF SAME
Kangaroo Drive: The day a kangaroo hunt was to take place was


looked forward to as a day of great sport and pleasure, owing to the
men and gins being allowed to take part in it. The joy or excitement to
the blacks was on a par with that of the picnic races to the white people
at the present time in the same district, because each gin, young or old,
had the privilege of backing her favourite man to kill the most
kangaroos. The evening before the hunt took place two or three
cautious men were sent out to discover where the largest number of
kangaroos were and also the best position to set their nets. These were
usually placed in the narrow, deep gully where there was a waterhole.
Next morning the strongest and ablest men were despatched with nets
which were about 30 yards long and 4 feet high. These were tied to
saplings or young trees in a half circle around the waterhole about 50
yards back with the inside bark of the Currajung tree. Generally eight
nets were used. On completion of this work one of the men went to the
top of the nearest hill and set fire to a dry grass tree. The under part of
the grass tree is always dry and the upper part green. Consequently,
when set on fire, volumes of very dark smoke are sent up, easily seen
by a signal man who is standing on the nearest hill to the camp. This is
the signal for all hands to form the circle around the kangaroos, starting
at the camp and extending right and left for miles around until the men
guarding each end of the nets are met, thus forming a complete circle.
All being now ready the signal man lights another grass tree which was
bound to be seen by someone in the circle. Signs were then passed
along the line from one to the other, as no one was allowed to speak or
make the least noise but to close in gradually around the kangaroos.
Up to this stage one would not have known there was a person in the
place. Afterwards, however, the yells and screams of the men and
women made a perfect babel of noise. As soon as the kangaroos see the
first man they make in the opposite direction only to meet another
man. They then begin to bound about in all directions meeting men
everywhere, thus becoming more frightened and stupified. The drivers
were then silently but swiftly closing in on the kangaroos and, when in
sight of the nets, the principle driver gave a terrific wild yell which was


followed by the three sides of drivers; but the men near the ends
remained as quiet as mice. The kangaroos, hearing no noise near the
net side, immediately stampeded towards the nets. Now is the time the
real fun starts. The men make a desperate charge, a la Anzac, upon the
kangaroos with heavy nulla-nullas. The kangaroos try the nets and
finding themselves surrounded, the “old men” kangaroos turn on the
blackfellows and show fight. Then the real slaughter takes place. The
gins, young and old, who have been closely following their
champions, now come running in, laughing, screaming and clapping
their hands, completely intoxicated with excitement, but back a fair
distance so as to be out of danger. What with the men clubbing the
kangaroos, the yells and screams of the men and gins, added to the
hissing of the kangaroos not disabled, finding it impossible to escape
and jumping into the waterhole on top of each other whereupon
the men jump in after them, some using waddies, other tomahawks,
until the last kangaroo was killed this is one of the most amusing
scenes in the blackfellow’s programme of life. The kangaroos are
sometimes fierce “old men” measuring from 5 to 6 feet in height and
very powerful. On many occasions the hunters got badly tom about
with the kangaroos hind claws. The slaughter being over they pulled
down their nets, rolled them up, and each one taking as much
kangaroo as could be carried, started off to camp in the best of spirits.
That night a great feast would take place and all the daring deeds
rehearsed and talked over until near midnight. The following day there
was nothing but eat and sleep.
WALLABY HUNT
The aboriginals of the Darling Downs were true Socialists as far as
food was concerned. It was both amusing and interesting to see them
at a kangaroo or wallaby hunt when there would be from 200 to 300
men from the oldest warrior to the youngest boys; but no women took
part in the wallaby drive. The men and boys, who were as naked as the


day they were bom, formed a circle around a point of scrub about 2
miles wide, opposite another point of scrub where there was a stretch
of forest between. When the circle men began to close in on the
wallabies the latter would make a break for the opposite scrub across
the open forest country. Then the fun would begin as the wallabies had
to encounter a line of the smartest young men in the tribe, stationed
about 200 yards from the scrub, with a sufficient distance between each
man to be out of the danger zone as regards nulla-nullas. Next came a
second line, the latter always divided with the drivers. It is most
amusing behind that, with still another line of old men, boys and dogs.
All the men outside the scrub kept as quiet as possible but those inside
it made the most hideous noises. Hearing all this noise the wallabies
became stupified and were easily killed by their pursuers. This was a
sport the darkies delighted in, the faces of the old and young beaming
with excitement.
DISTRIBUTING THE GAME
Now came the distribution of the spoils. The young men in the first
line always had the lion’s share, as they had the first chance. Some of
the most active men would often kill from six to ten each. As the drivers
were mostly young men and, being in the scrub, had not the same
opportunity as those that were in the first line, the latter always divided
with the drivers. It is most amusing how justice adjusts itself even
amongst savages. After they all had a rest and a smoke (even in my day
every man, woman and child did this) they began to pick out the fat
ones exactly on the same lines as a butcher would examine fat sheep.
The first line men always had the pick of the fat wallabies if there were
two coming at the same time,leaving the poor one to be killed by the
second or third line men. The first line men and drivers having picked
out all they required, provided the camp was not too far away, all of the
aged women and widows had the first pick of what was left; and no one
dared touch the game until these were satisfied. The gin always knew


when the drive was over by the noise ceasing. In the event of the gins
not being able to come along the King picked out the best that were
left and made the boys and men carry them along to the camp for the
old gins and what was left then belonged to the old men.
EMU BATTLE
When a flock had been located the blackfellow used a good deal of
strategy and cunning to effect his purpose, which is the death of as
many emus as possible. They were fond of the flesh of this large bird
and have a weakness for the oil. Another choice morsel is the heart
which is usually large in the emu. The hunters of the tribe first of all
approach the edge of the plains with great stealth because, as a rule, the
emu is to be found grazing where the grass and herbage is sweet.
Watching closely, they soon find out which part of the timber the birds
are likely to make for and disguise themselves by hanging and tying
bushes about their bodies so as to look like the surroundings, where-
upon they wait for the unsuspecting emu in the usual half circle
formation. Here again, as in the wallaby drives, the men are spaced
sufficiently wide apart to be clear of the danger zone of the nulla-
nullas. Once the warriors are set, the best mimic of the tribe is placed in
the centre position. This man is an adept at the call of the young and
adult birds when in distress, and uses his powers as a decoy. Directly
the unsuspecting birds are within hearing of the calls they very soon
come to see what is the matter and, when close enough to the pivot
man, the latter makes a raid at the nearest bird with a wild whoop,
which is the signal for the wings to close in and circle the emus. First of
all nulla-nullas are used. After this, should any of the emus get through
the cordon, the war boomerings are brought into use. These are deadly
weapons in the hands of such men as composed the Blucher warriors.
The only escape from these is to lie flat on the ground. The war
boomering was the only weapon which was not thrown with full force
at the “Bora” tests. Moreover, the gins did not participate in the emu


hunts. At the conclusion of the hunt the warriors always took what they
could carry to the camp; and should there be anything left it was placed
in the forks of trees and the camp men who failed to pass the Bora test
were sent to bring it in for the aged members and themselves.
THE PLAIN TURKEY, OR BUSTARD
These birds have a peculiarity in that they always start to walk away
from any disturbing influence; and the usual procedure is gone
through by placing the hunters in a half circle in a crouching attitude,
disguised by bushes. The drivers have to be particularly careful not to
get too close; and have to exercise great cunning to see that none of the
birds have young ones with them. Should this be the case, which is
always recognised by the mother being inclined to squat and hide,
they must be avoided, only keeping the male birds walking towards
the centre hunter. Directly the danger zone for the turkey is reached
the centre man gives the signal; but up to that he has been making the
most pitiful calls of the young bird, the wings then close in and the
birds immediately start to fly. The war boomerings are used against the
birds on the wing and the execution takes place in a terrible way. Of
course these boomerings can only be used with the birds flying and are
never brought into play while the turkeys are walking owing to the
danger they would be to the men themselves.
THE SCRUB TURKEY
These birds live in scrubs and brush; and there were several ways of
capturing or killing them. In the ordinary hunt through scrubs or
jungles in day-time the warrior kills the birds by sneaking up and
making use of the nulla-nulla when the birds have flown up into the
trees. Again they mimic the cry of the birds who, when close enough,
are startled and made to fly up on the limbs. When there is to be a feast,


or something out of the common, another method is used to get a
supply of scrub turkey, the time being a clear moonlight night when a
raid is made on the roosts about 10 p.m., the roosts having been
previously located during the daylight rambles. The signs of a
permanent roost are the droppings to be seen on the ground below.
These roosts are visited by a certain number of men who give the call
and the birds, startled, immediately put their heads up and are cut
down by the boomerings. It must be clearly understood that these
night trips are rare because an aboriginal has a peculiar dread of being
out at night, particularly in a thick scrub. There is still another method,
used by the gins and their children in the time of drought when water
is scarce in the scrubs. The children cut boughs and bushes with which
the gins fence in the water soakages, similar to a small bough yard,
leaving holes for turkeys to walk through. At each of these holes a slip
noose is placed, made of leather wood bark, a material as strong as the
best hemp. After these traps are set the gins and children go away and
root out yams some distance off, looking at the nooses on their way
home in the evening. Should there be no captives the traps are visited
early next morning, which is particularly the case when the aboriginals
are camped near the scrub. At certain times of the year a close watch is
kept to find out the new nests which are made entirely by the male
birds. These nests are huge mounds of scrub leaves, mould and thin
dead sticks. The fine mould is placed on the bottom by being thrown
backwards by the birds, on to the sticks; it then falls through as from a
sieve. It is in this fine mould that the hen lays her eggs, end up, in a
circle around the mound. Then come the leaves and coarse soil on top
of the eggs. After this the main top consists of fairly large rotten timber
and large leaves, etc.. The eggs are hatched by the internal heat of the
mound, which is aggravated by the showers of rain and sun’s rays.
When the young birds are hatched they find sufficient grubs and
insects in the mould to keep them alive as theyworktheirway out from
a depth of 2 or 3 feet. On reaching the top layer the old birds call out
and out jump the chicks which are from that time capable of running or


flying away from danger. The young birds are a great luxury and the
fresh eggs are just as nice as our ordinary turkey eggs.
THE WILD DUCK
In capturing these a great deal of intelligence and cunning was
required; and I received a proper object lesson in witnessing the
process for the first time. Except in flood time, the waterholes and
creeks always had large beds of weeds which grew out towards the
centre of the holes, the roots being under the water. As a rule the centre
of the holes were the only places clear of weeds; and if ducks were
found in the holes they invariably swam out to the centre before flying.
The blackfellow always chose the holes where he could either stand
up or where it was shallow enough to lie down under the water and, at
the same time, under the weeds. Having located the ducks on a
waterhole of this kind, with a bond in the banks, the trappers at the far
end of the hole got themselves ready, unseen by the ducks, and took
up their positions across the hole in alternate rows from side to side.
Before going under the water each man plugged his nostrils with
wood; but in my time rag was used. They also placed a hollow reed,
usually 6 or 8 inches long, in their mouths, after the style of the present
day submarine periscope, the top of the reed through which they
breathed being out of the water. As the top of the reed appeared to be
part of the weeds the ducks did not notice it. The trappers either stood
up or lay prone, eyes open,looking towards the surface. In the event of
anything going wrong with the reed, the trapper pulled a handful or
two of weeds, placed them over his face or nose and, raising them
above the water level, breathed serenely through the weeds.
Everything had to be arranged with a mathematical certainty,
particularly as to when the driver was to begin operations. After the
men in the water were properly stationed and comfortable, the signal
was given to the driver by the man in charge of the trappers. The driver
then made his appearance to the ducks some distance away and the


latter started swimming away towards the trappers. Directly they
passed over the heads of these men they were instantly pulled below
and their necks twisted under the water where the trapper held them
between his legs. What ducks were left approached the next zigzag line
of men to meet the same fete. This description to an inexperienced
reader, may appear fer drawn but, as I said at the beginning of this
article, I had the privilege of witnessing this method, in which two or
more men could take part. There is still another way which requires a
large number of men to carry it out effectively. The blacks always have a
good idea of the places where the ducks are to be found. A careful
scout is sent out to locate the game; then the hunters approach both
sides of the waterhole simultaneously, being careful to avoid being
seen or heard by the ducks; and, at a given yell by the leader, every man
rushes in as near to the top of the bank as possible, making the usual
hideous screams which terrify the ducks and make them fly straight
up in a flock only to be cut down by the game boomerings; and a
number fall in the dense weeds and deep water. Very often a number
are only wounded and not killed outright in which case the efforts of
expert water men are required to capture the birds. The blackfellow
does not attempt to swim in these dense beds of weed but crawls over
them like a water lizard; and from this the white man can easily take a
lesson by remembering that the hand over hand crawl stroke is the
most effective one to get clear of danger of this kind.
FISH
As this tribe of aboriginals had access to the coast through
Beaudesert and on to the Southern half of Stradbroke Island, they knew
all about the use of nets. They made both the large and small nets from
the leather wood tree bark which grew in most of the mountain scrubs
of their country. They also made their own fishing lines from the same
material; but in my time they always used the steel fishing hook. The
nets were used in precisely the same way as below the range, as drag


nets for clearing up any holes, particularly small ones, dragging them
right through. Should a net be snagged they went into the water, and,
by diving, cleared it. The small bag net was used principally by the gins
and children who frequently went into the holes and, by stirring up the
mud and making the water thick, easily scooped up the fish that came
to the surface. They had another style, spearing the fish, particularly the
roney, or swallow-tailed bream. In this sport they had a driver who
brought the shoals along towards the men with spears amongst them
and, as these fish generally swam shallow, the spearmen drove the
spears amongst them. I have often seen them get two fish on the one
spear. Until I showed them how to use a fishing line attached to the
end of a spear through a hole, like a harpoon, they had always had to go
into the water for the spears and fish. As they had, of course, never seen
the harpoon used they considered it a wonderful invention and
immediately made us of it. The large barbed spear was used for big cod
fish in shallow water. The blacks were very fond of fresh water turtle
which they easily killed when basking in the sun on the logs, or during
the laying season when these creatures came out on the banks of the
streams to lay their eggs in the ground. It is not generally known that
the implements were the means of leading up to friendly intercourse
between the tribes in the way of barter. The stone tomahawk was only
made by the tribes who had the suitable stone, which was generally
found along the main range; and these were of great value in districts
where they could not get the material to make them. Again, the
boomerings were made from the booyong (or Blackjack) tree which
was considered the finest timber to be had for that purpose. Both of
these were easily obtained in the “Blucher” tribe’s territority. In
exchange the “Bluchers” received principally spears made out of myall
timber which was particularly adapted for these weapons, as this kind
of timber did not grow in the “Blucher” country.


SUPERSTITIONS
The “Blucher” tribe, as far as I could ever find out, had no religion.
They believed in magic and Devil-Devil and, further, were intensely
superstitious. They believed that certain men who had a grudge against
them had the power to kill them with what they called the Muddlo.
It is necessary for me to explain to the reader what the Muddlo really
is. It is a piece of crystallized quartz and is generally found in the
conglomerate and other formations of the precipices of the Main
Range, being hard to get from these places. Sometimes this quartz can
be seen 200 feet up, sparkling like glass in the sunshine. It was the
cunning old rogues that were supposed to have the Muddlo; and the
young people, being in the camp with the old villains and hearing the
latter relating stories about the wonderful power they had with the
Muddlo, were made afraid to go near places where the stone was
supposed to be found, unless in company with a number of old men.
The stones told the young people by those old rogues put me in mind
of the stories of Wilson’s “Tales of the Border” or in the tales of the
Arabian Nights. The gins had the mortal dread of the Muddlo ; and the
young men had the same fear. The idea the blackfellow had about the
Muddlo was that it was formed in the rock by poisonous water. If a man
got one and placed it secretly in the water hole at night, and if a man or
woman belonging to a neighbouring or their own tribe, having a
personal grudge or thought to be an enemy, were to drink the water
from that hole, he or she would be instantly struck with a pain in the
chest, and would remain sick for a few days, ultimately dying provided
the medicine man did not come along. But it would not affect anyone
except the person it was intended to kill. When an aboriginal got sick
for a few days with a pain in the chest, or anywhere else, he or she
imagined they had come under the influence of the Muddlo. If asked
what was wrong they would say “Pigull, muddlo yacca
warlow,’’meaning that a blackfellow had made them sick by the
Muddlo; and unless a medicine man sucked the Muddlo out they


would die with fear. The medicine man, the rogue, would then come
to the rescue and, by a tremendous lot of sucking and ceremony,
would finally make a grimace and pretend he had extracted the
Muddlo when, as a matter of fact, he had a small muddlo in his mouth
all the time. During the time this operation was taking place there was
no person present except the medicine man and his patient ; and it was
always the finale for the medicine man to let his patient see the small
piece of quartz which had lost all its power only as far as the patient was
concerned. The patient invariably got better.
I shall now give an incident that came under my personal
observation of an unfortunate accident (because it was an accident
pure and simple) in connection with a Muddlo and the tragic after-
effect.
In the year 1858, at the old water saw mill at Old Killamey there was
a blackfellow called Jackie Jackie who was supposed by the young
blacks to have a Muddlo; and they told this to a select few of working
men at the mill. After work was finished, at evening, Jackie Jackie
usually came round cadging tobacco. The men who had tobacco
refused to give him any unless he would show them the Muddlo. He
seemed greatly suprised and denied having one; but after a lot of
coaxing he consented to show the stone. He sat down on the ground
and took a very small packet from under his armpit where he always
carried it, attached to a string over his shoulder. There were six of us
standing around him and, after glancing carefully around to see there
were no blacks about, he opened the packet, unwinding a piece of rag.
I expected to see something wonderful, so did the others; but we were
rather disappointed when it turned out to be a piece of crystallised
quartz. As we were busy examining it up came a young gin from
behind the blackfellow and glancing over the shoulders of the white
men, inquisitive to see what we were all looking at, saw the Muddlo.
She straight away uttered a piercing scream and ran for the camp. Jackie


Jackie sprang to his feet and raced to the scrub for all he was worth.
That was the last seen of him by any white man excepting myself. The
gin took ill and never left the camp until she was taken away a corpse
three days afterwards. The same night that the gin saw the Muddlo two
Councillors were told to watch Jackie Jackie camp; and about 2 a.m. he
came sneaking to the camp, hoping to obtain his implements. Both
Councillors immediately sprang out and gave him a start and ran for
about a mile in the direction of where they knew was a large hollow
apple tree. They knew this tree was beyond the hearing of any person
and, on reaching the spot, closed in and drove their spears through the
criminal’s chest, killing him on the spot. One of the Councillors took
the precaution to have his vine with him, which was instantly placed
around Jackie Jackie’s neck and he was drawn up and dropped inside
the hollow tree. Some six weeks after this took place I was catching
opossums for skins to make a rug when, climbing a large tree which
was very hollow and looking into the hole, in front of my face I saw
Jackie Jackie’s bald head. As it was just twilight my readers will not be
surprised to know that I hurried away from such uncanny and
disagreeable surroundings as quickly as possible.
I shall now tell how I found out about the native execution of Jackie
Jackie; and as the information was obtained from blackfellows of his
own tribe who had passed the Bora ceremonies I knew it was to be
relied upon as the truth.
In passing I would add that if any of my readers should have
occasion to have any transactions with aboriginal men, where absolute
truth was essential, I would recommend them first to find out if these
men had been through the Bora; if not, place no reliance upon their
facts.
Some time in 1869 I was out mustering wild cattle on the head of
Swan, Emu, and Farm Creeks, also the Condamine River, having three


black boys with me, named Boni, Tab, and Carlo. Carlo was a most
amusing character, full of life, fun, and good humour but much older
than the other two. I will refer to him later on but in this instance his
work was to look after the “coachers”, or quiet cattle used as decoys to
trap wild cattle. On one occasion, after we had finished mustering on
the branches forming Emu Creek, we decided to drive our sixty
“coachers” over the high mountain that divides Emu and Farm Creeks.
On the following morning it was found that more than half of our stock
horses had strayed away overnight; so my brother, another white man,
and two black boys went in search of them, intending to shift camp and
follow on with the pack horses, etc., with Tab and me taking the
“coachers” over the high mountain. This proved a difficult job getting
them through between the high precipices where there were no cattle
tracks or pathways. With care and perseverance we managed to get
them on to the head of Farm Creek just as the sun was setting, in the
middle of July, to find that our mates had not arrived there as arranged
with our blankets and food through having been delayed in finding the
lost horses. They had to camp on top of the mountains some miles
from us through darkness overtaking them. Tab and I therefore found
ourselves in a bad position, not having tasted food since early morning,
and none with us; so there was nothing left but to hobble our horses,
light a good fire, gather sufficient firewood to see us through the night,
and generally make the best of a hungry cold night, at an elevation of
4000 feet above sea level in the middle of winter. With a view to sitting
the night out I thought it would be a good idea to get as much of the
customs and laws of the “Blucher” tribe from Tab as possible. The first
question I asked him was did he know Jackie Jackie. He looked very
hard at me for some seconds before making any reply, as if
considering what to say. He seemed very suprised and finally said “You
been know ’em that fellow?” I replied that I did. He then remarked
“that fellow been cabon rogue”, “cabon” meaning big. Evidently it
dawned upon him that we were then between two precipices which he
had previously shown me to be where the Muddlos were to be found;


and becoming nervous and excited, he related the history of the gin
and the Muddlo.
It appears that, after the gin reached the camp and told what had
happened, there was great commotion in the whole camp, the men in
small groups whispering together and the gins as silent as death, as if
afraid to speak. Apparently the Muddlo creates fearful terror in the gin
who has seen it, which aggravates their death unless a medicine man is
on the spot. In this instance Jackie Jackie absconded and his witchcraft
was exposed. When I asked Boni and Carlo they corroborated Tab’s
statement.
In a sense the Muddlo was a strong point in the white man getting
control of the blacks because they considered the Muddlo was also
connected with lightning; and when the white man began to use
firearms the blacks, seeing the flash and not the bullet, connected this
power with lightning to our advantage.
THE BUNYIP OR MOCHEL MOCHEL
I am now touching upon a subject that has always been open to
argument and doubt; and for that reason I propose to give my own
conclusions, after having investigated the matter as thoroughly as
possible on the spot, as it were.
From the first the blackfellows of the “Blucher” tribe were
unanimous in their description of the Mochel Mochel which in a way
corresponded to that of an otter; also that it was only to be found in and
about deep permanent waterholes; further, that it was a very shy animal
which, to get a glimpse of, required great cunning and stealth, owing to
its quickness and alertness. Thus armed, I had my opportunity, owing
to the surroundings of my bush life, to come upon my quarry sooner or
later. I was told that it could both see and hear underwater. That was


particularly the case as regards anything moving about on the bank, in
the vicinity of its home ; further, that it could produce sounds under the
water. At last my opportunity came, in this way. With my brother and
another white man I was bringing a mob of wild horses down from the
head of Swan Creek and when we came to a place known as the
junction of the Gap Creek, being some distance ahead of the horses so
as to prevent them breaking away on either side, I heard a piercing
kind of scream similar to that uttered by a female in terrible distress.
The noise came from the shallow end of the junction hole and I at once
turned in that direction, my horse also having been startled by the
scream. Much to my surprise I saw an animal in shape similar to a low
set sheep dog, the colour of a platypus, head and whiskers resembling
an otter, passing from the shallow water over a strip of dry land to the
deep water. The back view of this creature’s head was exactly like the
bald head of a blackfellow, which I found corresponded with the
figure drawn on the tree at the Bora ground, also with the aboriginal
description “Cumi Patoic,” meaning bald head. When my companions
arrived on the scene they at once saw the frightened look of my horse
and my own excitement and asked what was the matter. On explaining
they were inclined to treat it as a case of leg-pulling but were soon
convinced when they saw the commotion of the water in the hole and
the muddy appearance of it. Before long they were as excited as the
writer; and on my suggesting means of securing the animal they
promptly overruled this, saying “No”, our horses are of more
importance than the Mochel Mochel particularly as there are some
three year old un-branded ones in the mob. Under the circumstances
there was nothing for it but to abandon the idea of seeing any more of
the Bunyip just then, but I had made up my mind to do so later on
should the opportunity occur. This, however, never came. The
impression made upon my mind was that the Mochel Mochel was a
kind of otter. The blacks had a great dread of the Mochel Mochel, and
nothing could persuade them to go near or bathe in a waterhole
supposed to be the home of this animal, neither would they camp in


the vicinity of such a place, because they always connected this animal
as having the same sort of influence as the Muddlo stone. The first time
this dread was forcibly brought under my notice was when my brother
George and I were having a swim in the Condamine not far from the
Canning Downs head stations, when hearing a noise above our heads
on the bank we looked up and saw King Darby and his hunting party.
Darby was in great terror, exclaiming “Georgey, Tommy, come out
quick; Mochel Mochel sit down there, baal junnim longs fellow”,
meaning that the Bunyip lived in the hole and had eaten all the fish in
it, so out we came to the intense delight of our aboriginal friends.
To show that the fear of the Bunyip was to a certain extent shared by
some of the white people I shall give a further illustration. Two men
were sent out from the head station at Canning Downs to Lord John
Swamp to do some bush work in connection with building a sheep
yard on the property now known as “Glenreagh”. They had a camp
with their tarpaulin after which one of them took a bucket and two
fishing lines and went to the Condamine. Baiting a line he threw it in
and, while in the act of placing a bait on the other hook, he turned to
have a look at the cork of the first line when he saw a good sized animal
swimming near the cork which so frightened him that he ran up the hill
to his mate and threw himself on to his sheep skin and blanket
speechless His mate was alarmed and thought his comrade had
suddenly gone mad; but soon afterwards the latter was able to explain
what had happened and remarked that the animal he saw appeared to
have the body of a horse with the bald head of a blackfellow. The result
of this fright was that the victim had to be taken by his mate the next day
into Warwick, where he died three days afterwards.
REMEDIES
Cunjevoy Sting or poison: the remedy the blacks had for this was


to fill the mouth with wet or damp soil free from vegetable matter,
which will give instant relief. I have never known it to fail. I am giving
this cure here as it may benefit some sufferer who has been foolish
enough to taste it. It has always struck me that the juice of this plant
would be an antidote for snake bites, as snakes will invariably be found
where it grows; and I have asked blackfellows if they have ever tried it
for that purpose, their reply being that they knew nothing of its
properties in that direction, only for food.
I have often thought that immigrants coming into the country
should be warned against tasting anything growing in the bush unless
they first see the birds eating it, as instinct has taught the latter not to eat
anything poisonous.
Snake bite: for this there was no antidote except that a ligature was
immediately applied if the wound was where this could be done. The
material used was the loin girdle worn by every gin, which was made
out of marsupial hair. After the ligature had been twitched up, the
wound was scarified and made to bleed, every native present taking
their turn at sucking it, provided, of course, there was nothing wrong
with the gums or mouth, afterwards rinsing their mouths out with
water. This process went until all danger was passed.
Choking Child: as this was not an uncommon event amongst the
piccaninnies the blacks had a very simple, effective way of treating a
child who had tried to swallow something too large, viz., they grabbed
the child by the legs, and sprang into the air, giving the child’s body as
sudden a jerk as possible, which soon had the effect of making the
child vomit up the obstruction.
Wounds and Sores: these were usually treated by the application
of water and soil, or, in the other words, mud. The white people
generally had the wrong conception of the use made of earth, in that
they thought any kind of bad soil was used in making the Bora tattoo


marks fester and stand out afterwards when covered by the natural
skin. For any cut they used pure soil and water with which they made
mud poultices at the edge of the water. They were very careful about
the temperature of the water; and I judged it to be about 75 degrees as
the favourite heat. They could not use very cold water. I have seen all
kinds of ghastly cuts healed in this way, one in particular being a
warrior cut from the buttock to the back of the neck along the edge of
the spine as a result of a tribal fight with the Maclntyre River tribes. That
part of the wound near the shoulder blade exposed the lung, over
which a piece of material was placed by my mother so as to prevent any
of the mud poultice getting inside. This man made a complete
recovery. Whenever possible they were always particular to have the
wound washed by clean water after using the mud poultices. As soon
as the inflamation went down the wounds were anointed with iguana
oil.
SOCIAL EVILS
The first sign of this which I saw amongst the “Blucher” tribe was in
the early sixties when I came upon two of the young blackfellows,
whom I knew personally, camped by themselves in the vicinity of the
“Coal Hole” on Farm Creek. Considering this strange, I wanted to
know the reason; and was reluctantly told by one that ‘Yerilee chung,
cabon muddlo yacca warlow,” meaning the white fellow had made
them sick with his disease. That was my first observation of the scourge
which, prior to the advent of the white man, was unknown to the
aboriginals. Those words, coupled with the most contemptible oath of
the aboriginal, “Chung”, still rings in my ears as the undeniable truth;
and to be told it by the savage in his own expressive way had often
made me think very little of my race. These young fellows told me that
the only remedy they could think of was to use the Coal Hole fresh
water pool as a bathing place because the tribe had no previous
knowledge of the disease or how to treat it. Consequently they used to


lie in this water for hours at a stretch and eventually cured themselves
after a considerable stay at that place with no other treatment.
The “Coal Hole” was so named because a large seam of coal
appeared to form the bottom and walls of the spot and an everlasting
stream of water trickled from the coal seam into the pool. That the
water had medicinal properties of a benefical nature was evident and,
further, that the aboriginals knew this was impressed upon my mind.
No doubt the medical profession know something about the reason
why the water was so effective. As a diversion I shall remark that prior to
this the “Coal Hole” was pointed out to a Scotsman named Bill Murat,
who was an educated man, but like many others at that time was a
working man on Canning Downs. Murat recognised the importance of
the coal seam and tried to persuade the owners of Canning Downs to
work or open it up, also others, but met with no success; and nothing
was done until many years after his death.
It is only a few years back that the first work was done. Now it is the
celebrated Tannymorel Coal Mine, with a large population turning out
one of the finest quality coals of Australia. Moreover, it is in the midst of
a charming prolific agriculture district.
CARLO THE CORROBOREE COMPOSER
Carlo was a great favourite amongst the blacks and was their
principal man in composing songs for the corroborees. Another thing I
found him most useful for was that he knew the names of all the
timbers and places. I also employed him on our mustering trips,
particularly to look after the “coachers”, and recollect my first
experience of his happy nature. We were sneaking to get between the
wild cattle and scrubs, every moment to be as quiet as mice, when
Carlo suddenly broke out with his wild aboriginal songs and spoilt our
chance of getting the wild mob on that occasion. After this Carlo


was put in charge of the coachers and played his part well. In
appearance this blackfellow was one of the finest specimens of
humanity to be found, just the ideal that the teachers of physical
culture love to work up to. He was 6’ 2” high with massive legs tapering
down to feet that would show off No. 8 boots. This man’s head was
large and looked altogether different from that of the ordinary
aboriginal, both in shape and size, being more the shape of a good
white man’s head. The usual black piercing eyes, sparkling with fun
and good humour, made him a most intelligent and agreeable bush
companion, and lit up a splendid athlete.
When the bunya season was on the “Blucher” tribe were regular
visitors to the Bunya Mountains near Dalby, where other strange tribes
also congregated; consequently new corroborees were the order of
the season so far as Carlo was concerned. I was greatly surprised at
seeing his first notes of these which were recorded on the inner bark of
some tree in the shape of figures of men and animals painted with a
kind of pigment mixed with iguana oil. These sheets were carefully
rolled up like brown paper and protected from the wet. From these
notes he composed his corroborees and the tribe rehearsed them until
they were proficient, and then gave them to the visiting tribes after the
Bora ceremonies.
GENERAL
It is a remarkable thing what a healthy appearance the children and
adults had when I first knew them until the white man came with his
measles, whooping cough, and influenza. In the writer’s opinion those
three epidemics, combined with alcohol and finally aggravated by the
evil (the result of our high civilisation) were the means of
exterminating one of the finest and noblest aboriginal races. At the
time I am writing about the social evil was unknown to this tribe and
was not introduced by the convicts but by society men who had the


means and opportunities of visiting Sydney and other large centres. If
the country at the present time was as free from it as in 1855, there
would not be any occasion for the authorities to have to introduce
legislation to combat it, nor for the military to be placed at the expense
and loss of time in dealing with it.
From a rough estimate there were probably 3000 aboriginals on the
Darling Downs 60 years ago; and at the present day it would be hard to
find half a dozen pure blood representatives from that lot.
There are a number of people who have the idea that the blacks
were a very useless race but this is not borne out by the old pioneers
who found them very useful on many occasions. In the early days there
were very few fences and stock could stray hundreds of miles because
there was nothing to check them, with the exception of rivers. As the
blacks were experts at tracking, this was naturally the first work they
were asked to perform; and they saved the pioneer squatters many
pounds in horseflesh, also a great saving in time. In following this work
some of them soon became very expert horsemen and quickly got into
the ways of horse, as they found riding much easier than walking.
There was nothing pleased a blackfellow better than to see a horse
bucking, even if he threw the rider. When this happened the
blackfellow generally landed on his feet because he was so active.
Again, the gins were the first servants that the pioneer white women
had and they were found most trustworthy and honest. Indeed the
children were never so carefully guarded against accident of any kind
by white women as they were by the black gins. One incident that
happened will show the jolly nature of these black women. Mrs.
George Leslie, the wife of the pioneer squatter of Canning Downs, had
as her servants two of King Darby’s sisters named Nancy and Mary Ann.
Mrs. Leslie, not being very well, was resting on the sofa and went to
sleep. In the meantime the two gins saw this and dressed themselves in
old clothes belonging to Mr. Leslie and walked into the room. When


Mrs. Leslie woke up and saw them she imagined they were two strange
blackfellows and became so alarmed that the fright immediately made
her faint. On coming round she was greatly relieved to find that the two
supposed blackfellow were her two maids and further that they were
kneeling beside her crying their hearts out and asking pardon. “Baal
you cry, Baal you tell ’em Master” was all they could say. Mrs. Leslie at
once pardoned them knowing that, had she told Mr. Leslie, both
women would have run the risk of being severely dealt with.
Coming again to the men; in the year 1853 there were about 50,000
sheep to be hand-washed on Canning Downs and the wages paid each
white man were six shillings and six pence with six nobblers of rum, 10
hours per day being the days work. Being September, the water was
very cold and the few white men on the station had the gold fever and
wanted to get away to the southern goldfields, so they said, but were
willing to remain and wash the sheep before leaving provided they got
more pay; but the result was that, after a consultation with the manager,
it was agreed that the price of wool then would not stand any increase
of wages and the men left.
The manager of Canning Downs then asked how the overseer
proposed to get the washing done. The latter replied “by the blacks”;
and he saw King Darby who agreed to find the blacks to help them do
the washing. This was carried out without a hitch, the work done better
than if performed by white men. Darby would not allow grog to be
given to his men.
SMOKE SIGNAL
Long before the white man appeared on the Darling Downs the
aboriginals had signalling mountains belonging to each tribe on which
the smoke was made to rise in prearranged waves, the codes being
perfectly understood by the tribes. The principal station for the


“Blucher” tribe when signalling to the Coastal tribes was the mountain
at the head of Emu Creek, adjoining the Southern end of Mt. Huntley.
The Richmond tribe had Wilson’s Peak, while the Mclntyre River tribe
had Mt. Huntley at the head of Swan Creek or Cunningham’s “Logan
Vale”. In this way the tribes could pass word along over long distances
many days in advance of the white man’s earliest opportunity, and
were always prepared for the whites. Our nearest approach to this is
the Heliograph. I have often watched these smoke signals, with the
permission of King Darby, when the Blucher were communicating
with the Fassifem Tribe.
OTHER SIGNALS
Another favourite method of indicating to friendly tribes or their
own absent members was to place a long stick in the ground pointing
in the direction that the main body of the tribe had taken. If, however, a
branch of the tribe had gone in another direction a small stick was
placed near the large one, also pointing the way they had travelled.
These sticks always had a certain number of notches cut in them which
were read by those for whom they were intended. In this way it was
always known which group the King accompanied and for that reason
they always knew where to find him. The art of tracking always
occupied a prominent place in the tribe and was worked in connection
with the stick signals.
HAND SIGNALS
At corroborees the old gins and married women whose husbands
were alive had the front positions, then came the younger unmarried
women and girls. No talking or whispering was allowed among the
women but,instead, a system of deaf and dumb speaking was known to
each female, by which they conversed at pleasure.


This was taught as one of the women’s parts of their Bora ceremony;
and no male was ever allowed to learn these on penalty of death.
MATERNITY NURSES
In the absence of medical men and white female nurses, some of the
pioneer women were in extreme danger during maternity cases. Then
Darby’s wife came to the rescue directly she was asked and took charge
of the cases at Canning Downs. On more than one occasion she
rescued white mothers from the jaws of death and never lost a case.
SOCIALISM
The general principle among the aboriginals regarding game in the
bush was that, never mind what country they travelled through,
whether their own or that belonging to other tribes, they were entitled
to capture and use what they required. Directly the white man came on
the scene with his flocks and herds and some of the latter strayed and
were not under supervision, the aborigines, acting according to their
own customs, killed some which were used for food. The white man,
in his ignorance of their customs, particularly the shepherds and
overseers, began to shoot the natives for these robberies as they called
them. This led up to reprisals by the Mclntyre tribe, with the result that
they killed the first white man they came across on the principle of “an
eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth”. This was the first cause of the
many horrible tragedies perpetrated by the Mclntyre tribe. Fortunately,
the Leslie Brothers, on the advice of Ernest Elphinstone Dalrymple,
treated the Canning Downs tribe differently. Dalrymple had previously
served as an officer in the Indian army where he got an insight into
native customs and was able to give Patrick Leslie good advice, with the
result that, directly Leslie slaughtered any stocks for the use of himself
and his white employees, King Darby and his tribe always received a


share. This was why Darby’s tribe was never known to kill any of
Leslie’s stock. Further, it cemented an unbroken friendship towards
the Leslies arid their employees.
