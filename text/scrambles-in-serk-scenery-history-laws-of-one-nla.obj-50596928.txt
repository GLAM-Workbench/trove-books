SCRAMBLES IN SERK.
There are from England four points of departure for
Serk London, Southampton, Weymouth, and Tor-
quay, All the routes are via Guernsey. The fares be-
tween London and Guernsey are, both by Southampton and
Weymouth, 31s. and 215., or, return tickets for a month,
455. and 355. The Weymouth steamer leaves at 7a. m.
and has a passage of seven hours. Owing to the early
hour of departure, travellers must pass a night in the
town. The Southampton boat makes a night voyage of
ten hours, leaving at 12 p. m.
Immediately on arrival at Guernsey the boatmen should
be asked whether steamer, boat, or cutter leaves that day
-for Serk. Should it be a ‘ dies non ’ a night must perforce
be passed in the town, and those who wish to avoid that
inconvenience will learn gladly that the Serk cutter is
found at Guernsey more certainly on Tuesday and Satur-
day than other days, meeting usually the Southampton
Monday and Friday steamers. The fare between Guern-
sey and Serk is but Is. 6 d. the distance being seven miles.

On arrival the stranger will do well to ask for Madame
Yaudin’s hotel. There is yet another, but the one named
is the most comfortable. The cost of board and lodging
is four shillings daily for each person. The hotels are
near to each other, one mile from the harbour.

The stranger may have heard of Serk only as the last
and least important of the four geographic names, Jersey,
Guernsey, Alderney, and Serk. He may have accounted
of it as a little islet to be exhausted in a day , for it is but
a strip of granite, three miles long by one mile and a half
in breadth, inhabited by some six hundred souls. Yet if
picturesque and varied scenery, if a table land standing
up on all sides three hundred feet above the sea, if wooded
ravines and wild fantastic caves, a remarkable geological
structure, numerous and rare wild flowers, algce, and sea
animals, and withal a feudal government based on an unwrit-
ten law, if these things constitute interest, Serk will yield
pleasure for weeks and months. The little stronghold has
gathered to itself a peculiar charm, and but few can leave
it without regret. The great and wide sea stretching
round, the waters rising and falling in all the ease of power,
the grey rock walls of granite, the hoarse caves, the scream-
ing gulls, the ceaseless wavesplash, all sights and sounds

freshen the feelings and restore the waning energy. All
is new, you are yourself renewed, and with opened eyes
learn to enjoy a long wander in the green Talleys on the
face of the riven cliffs, amongst the dark caves, or along
the shingle of the mimic bays girt with Atlantic seaweeds.
Let us start then at early morning, and in oldest clothes,
out of the sheltered hollow in which the hotel lies hidden
from the gales of winter. A narrow high-banked lane,
where the male and lady ferns flourish beneath the entwined
blanches of pigmy trees, will bring us to the Coupee road.
Turning to the left we pass one or two tiny farm-houses,
and may note some of the peculiar features of their hus-
bandry. The hedges are rude, and the small inclosures
are divided into long strips of pasture and arable running
side by side. The farm instruments are heavy and clumsy,
and most of the farm work is done by hand. A Serk
farmer is always a fisherman, and w r ill be found in his boat
if not working as a labourer on bis farm. Even in full
harvest, with a bright day after rain, the arrival of a
steamer will cause him and his men to leave the farm for
the boat, aud he will be seen carrying excursionists on
board as eagerly as though the money for to-morrow’s food
had yet to be earned.
The road, after passing between high banks, dips down
suddenly through a soft brown rock, aud we are at once
overlooking one of the most curious and interesting spots
in Serk. The good broad Coupee road has dwindled to a
rough steep path, where the storm waters have worn deep
seams. On either hand is an earthy rock rising to some
height. A few steps more and, leaving the rock behind,


we stand on a bridle road six feet wide, which tops the
ridge of a precipitous ledge of rock, three hundred feet in
height, and one hundred and fifty yards in length, with
the sea rushing in on either side below. This is the
Coupee, and the only means of communication between
Great and Little Serk, the sea having very nearly suc-
ceeded in dividing the island into two yet smaller islets.
Although the passage of this rampart bridge is dangerless,
there are few who will not feel some degree of awe as they
look down the depth. Often the wind gathers and sweeps
across in furious gusts, stayed only by the rocks where
they rise above the pass; and at night the cotters of Little
Serk have sometimes been forced to crawl on hands and
feet, pushing a lantern before them. But a few years
have gone by since a man crossing with a load of wheat
was blown over, and fell lifeless among the rocks. Many
traditions still hang about the place.
There is a wide outlook to sea. Six miles to the west is
the bold rock front of Guernsey falling to the sea-level half-
way along the line of coast, and nearer home the rugged
coasts of Great and Little Serk circle to our feet, and leave
a sandy bay, known as the Grand Greve, lapping the sea
lazily. Here at low water a scramble will be well repaid. A
fine sweep of firm glittering sand is backed by black reefs,
and fairy caves and inlets, where the isolated rock-arches
echo back the harsh note of the sea-gull, and on whose pinna-
cles a few cormorants stand black and motionless. The
black reef on the left covered with seaweed is also worth a
visit, as the favourite haunt of the ormer. The bay on the


Jersey side can be approached only during spring tides and
from Little Serk.
On walking up the rise to this division of the island, we
are at once struck with the barrenness and wild dreariness
that reigns everywhere. Till lately Little Serk was little
better than a rabbit warren, and, although enclosures are
increasing, the crops are still poor and scanty. After
advancing a few hundred yards along the road, a track on
the left will lead us to the brink of a rock, whence a path-
way has been cut down to a curious spot called Le Pot.
There are on the sea-coasts of Great Britain a few huge
fissures in the earth reaching down to the sea, in some
parts known as King Arthur’s Pots. This is one of those
remarkable holes, and there are two others in the island,
of which one, Le Creux Terrible, is far larger and of
greater depth. Le Pot, however, possesses the advantage
of enabling us to pass down through it to the beach at low
water, and it is most beautifully festooned with the dark
ivy, the bramble, and long-fronded fern. It should be
seen also in high tides, as the waves dash through the
caverp into the cauldron, and sweep hoarsely round the
rocky base, in striking contrast with the luxuriant vegeta-
tion clothing the sides higher up. On reaching the bottom
of the pit, we pass through an archway to the beach, where
fine pieces of spar have been sometimes found; and on the
left enter the first of some wild inlets towards the Coupee
Bay. Close to Le Pot will be found a passage into the
rock, one of the entrances to the silver mines worked in
Serk a few years since. It was hero that when a cliffing


party, having entered some distance in darkness, lighted
their candles, the leader found that he had stopped upon
the very brink of a shaft. Past this lode, a little
clambering over rocks, slippery with sea-weed, brings us,
round the projecting cliff passable only at low water, into
an extensive bay with some deep caves. At the further
end is a slight rise over a ridge easily mounted. In the
inlet beyond will be found a very fine grotto, set in pinna-
cle rocks, looking like some desecrated or time-worn cathe-
dral, framing grotesquely a view of some distant headlands.
There are still bays between this grotto and the Cou-
pee, which can be reached only from above, and we must
therefore retrace our steps, and reascend the Pot. From
this point the path will not be found without a guide, for
it is concealed amongst the gorse, and lies over a narrow
ledge of projecting cliff. Before descending, we may look
round on the gloomy-looking precipitous coast, At our
back is a bare and lofty granite cliff, the home of the sea-
birds, and at our feet are huge boulders of gneiss and trap
clothed with sea-weed, imbedded in smaller fragments
stained of a brilliant pink, while at sea the waves are bro-
ken into lines of foam on the many sunken rocks which on
all sides belt the island. After passing through two or
three indents, we arrive at the object of our search, the
east Coupee bay. Here is seen to advantage the form of
that tall rampart raising its long bank so abruptly that it
is said to be but forty-one feet out of the perpendicular at
its base. The greater part of the bay has a rooky floor,
the remainder of a large mass worn away by the sea, but
its special features are two caves to the north and south.


One is never left by the tide, and the changing colours of
the waters, with the light streaming in on the darkness
through the openings, form a striking picture. The cave
to the south is, however, the more imposing, being formed
of two caverns, one of some length leading into a hall,
with a fiat and lofty roof, from- which again extend one or
two short passages. This is one of the largest single caves
in Serk, ranking after the Boutiques, and Gouliots, and
hence, it is said, come the shrieks and painful wails which
have sometimes frightened the Serk fishermen, hurrying
across the Coupee late at night.
On again arriving at the summit of the cliff, we make
across the downs covered with wild flowers for the “ Mi-
ner’s Cottages.” These are the first marks of the lately-
abandoned mines, but from hence to the extreme southern
point, ruined buildings, air towers, shafts, and rusty iron-
work, will be found scattered in every direction. The sil-
ver mines of Little Serk were commenced by a company in
1835, and closed with a loss of about £20,000. in 1846.
Silver was not found in sufficient quantities to pay the ex-
penses. The last of the old Seigneurs, Ernest Le Pelley,
was sanguine of success, and their ultimate failure is a sad
type of the present state of the family. Before, however,
visiting the scenes around the mines, the wildest and most
savage in all Serk, we should clamber down to the little
boat harbour below the cottages, whence there is a fine view
of Dixcart, the Bay Terrible, and intervening indents, and
bold headlands. At low water the rock of La Baleine,
white with foam, and the reef stretching therefrom almost
to our feet, give an idea of the dangerous nature of the


coast. On the right of this inlet are two fine isolated rocks,
the nearer pierced with an archway, while both are covered'
with scanty herbage. It was on the furthermost seawards,
La Moue Brainiere, that one foggy night, some forty years,
ago, an American merchantman struck and was lost with
all on hoard, nor was it till morning dawned that the
islanders knew what a terrible scene had passed, almost
within a stone’s-throw of their doors. It is said that
among the bodies thrown on shore was that of a lad who
had left the island for America a year or two before the
wreck, and in confirmation of this belief, it is stated that
when the father, hearing the report, entered the room
where the dead were laid, blood poured out afresh from the
wounds in body of his son. The claim was unacknowledged,
but on all hands it is agreed that, from that day, no tidings of
the absent one have ever reached his home. Returning to the
cottages, and passing along their front, we shall find a good
road, skirting some fields, having first, however, passed
through the gate opposite the last cottage seawards, to view
some large boulders, which have closely imitated the
appearance of a small cromlech.
A stranger will remark, here and elsewhere, the fine
yield of parsnips, and their abundance throughout the
island. They are the chief food of the cattle, and in their
cultivation great pains are taken. One day’s work spe-
cially is a grand holiday, and goes by the name of La
Grande Charrue, or the “ Big Plough.” Before its arri-
val the ground is twice at intervals ploughed up and har-
rowed, and when all is ready, the neighbours are invited
to attend. Moreover, if the farm be a small one, the


plough, which is to become the great feature of the day, is
borrowed from the nearest owner. The work begins by
the small plough making its way oyer the ground, followed
by the larger one, drawn usually by four bullocks and two
horses, and kept in order by three men ; while behind come
one or two who, with spades, break up the clods. Inas-
much as the big plough cannot get at the corners, hand-
labour is there at work digging the ground up deeply.
Thus in three quarters of an acre, on this day, may he seen
two ploughs, a dozen men, and as many cattle, busily em-
ployed. Hot cider and eggs are brought into the field
during the day, and at night all sit down to a substantial
supper. The neighbours are not paid, but look for the
help of their host on a like occasion.
We have now reached the top of a rise in the road, and
look down on a hare and dreary scene. Half way between
two hills, running to the sea, there rests a narrow table
land, and on it rises a high broad wall, crumbling and
desolate, with glimpses of the bright sea through the shape-
less windows. Around, rising above the gorse and rank
grass, are buildings in all stages of decay, in unison with
the scream of the sea-gull, the hoarse roar of the wave, the
black rock, and uncultivated moorland. Taking the road
down the glen, we soon reach Port Goury, a spur of rock
with the remains of a stage of old, running out into the
sea. Many of the timbers of the pier are yet firmly held
by their iron bands, the last decaying marks of the busy
stir which once disturbed this rough and gloomy shelter.
Now, a fishing-line or two hanging from the opposite side
of the inlet, and a few corks floating on the waves, are the


only signs of man’s handiwork. On our return, nearly
opposite the unprotected shaft, which yawns down deep and
black, is a path running up the side of the hill, and though
the view to which it leads lies out of the way, it will repay
the loss of time.
Still among traces of the ruins, we reach a brow over-
looking a sandy creek, one hundred feet below, and on the
very brink is a ruined tower, through whose crevices is
seen a shaft down into the cave, in which the indent ter-
minates. A naked granite headland, hut a few feet in
width, rises opposite, and runs boldly out, barely covered
with short grass, and the grey and yellow lichens. Mount-
ing a rising ground to reach this island breastwork, we
suddenly find ourselves on a point from which five
huge bluffs, like rugged arms, sprawl out seawards, as
though some giant had fallen, and for ever rested as he
fell. Close at hand peers up through the waves the rude
rock, L’Etat de Serck, almost within grasp of the monster.
If we descend to the water-mark along the first-named
headland, the way will remind us of the battlements of an
old Rhine castle, for the narrow track is closed in, from
the edge of the precipice, by a stone wall, and on the other
hand are piled up square-cut and ancient-looking granite
boulders. In a gale, as the sea, lashed amongst the long
narrow inlets, surges furiously, and throws clouds of white
foam high up on the rocks, the scene always wild and
dreary, becomes terrible. It was at such a time, and from
one of these points, that a miner was washed out to sea and
drowned. Every brow hence to La Baleine should be
rounded, and every inlet entered, for either some isolated


rock-arch, deep crimson rock-pool, dripping fern-roofed
care, or peep at the dark blue sea, through the lights and
shadows of some barely-parted cliffs, will reward the wan-
derer.
From any of the heights above these points, the eye is
drawn to a clump of trees standing out in singular contrast
to the bare ground about them, and there will be found the
hamlet of Little Serk. The farm-houses are well built of
granite, but one cluster of cottages presents a most wretched
appearance. Some consist of a single room, choked by the
family bed; and in one case the fowls flew out at the roof,
when the door was shut, and they feared to be caught.
The coast at the back of the hamlet, between Port Goury
and Les Fontaines, has a singularly rude character. If we
set out for Port Goury we shall soon reach the common,
and a track leading to a fishing level amongst the rocks,
whence there is a good view of the entrance to the mines.
Passing from this point northwards, we round a headland
and find the sea covered with black promontories, about
which the waves are eddying. A deep gully runs in on the
land, to which there is access by a narrow dangerous des-
cent. The beach is covered with a broken mass of black
rock and grey rounded boulders. It is the most desolate
and uninviting spot in Serk. A grand black reef runs out
on one side of the bay. The wild aspect of the southern
extremity of this island is specially remarkable in a storm,
when the waves rolling in whiten on rock after rock, as they
burst and break, till the whole surface is one troubled war-
fare. Here, coasting to the north-west, we look on Brechou
and the south-west coast, which, at the Coupee, meets in


an acute angle the line of Little Serk. The whole range
has the appearance of a large bay, crowded with black pin-
nacles and circles of foam, out at sea. Amongst the rocks,
we may sometimes see the Serk cutter, with her gleaming
sails, making for the harbour of Le Creux.
We have now arrived on the cliff, above the most curious
anchorage in Serk, called Les Fontaines. The name is bor-
rowed from a mineral spring, running by the side of the
path. As we look down, it seems doubtful whether the
tiniest fishing-boat could be sheltered in such a spot, for the
shore is one broad bed of black jagged rocks. It is only
when we have completed the descent that a narrow shore
of level shingle is opened, running down for one hun-
dred yards to the sea, between huge misshapen walls.
Here the mouth widens, while the black reef rises in odd-
shaped pinnacles, and begins to curve ruggedly, yet grace-
fully, to sea. It ends, at length, in a pile of rock, lap-
ping a harbourage, and acting as a breakwater against the
fury of the western gales. 1 Notwithstanding, the force of
the waves is such, that boats have been swept away from
the capstan. Immediately on leaving Les Fontaines, we
shall find naked granite boulders cropping out everywhere
from the down, and one mass is specially remarkable for
its irregular outline. In an inlet, close to Les Fontaines,
towards the Yermande, there will be found, on the side of
the cliff, a very small but interesting “ creux.” It is
named Le Creux Petit, and is at the top about six feet wide,
while it descends perhaps eighty feet to the shore, which
is accessible by a long and-narrow ledge of rock. This creux
is most clearly but half formed, for, looking into it from


above, the bottom of soft earth can be seen, about forty
feet above the shore. As might be expected, there is no
cave in the creek in the direction of the hole, but there is
a crevice, which will doubtless ultimately become the
passage through which the sea will tunnel. At present,
as there is no outlet visible by which the sinking soil can
be washed out, it is a question of considerable interest how
this deep excavation could have been formed.
From the creek above named there is an arch into an
inlet, with three very beautiful and unique caves. The sea
hardly passes the entry, for they have been formed chiefly
by the action of land springs. At their further end, the
roof and sides change from rock to large rounded boulders
and pebbles, bound with earth. Two of these caverns
present a very singular appearance. A streamlet passes
over the arch, nourishing as it descends the delicate sprays
of the overhanging sea-fern, whose torn fronds lie on the
pink stones beneath the shower. Inside, a wall of earth
and pebbles fronts the light, and runs across from wall to
wall half up the height, having a dark vaulted chamber
above. Here, in the twilight, the brilliant glossy fronds
of tfie asplenium climb up the bank, even flourishing be-
neath the stones on the cave floor. As life in the midst
of death, they light up, with a rare weird beauty, the deep
grim shadows of these granite halls. On again reaching
the summit of the cliff, we must notice the character of the
granite boulders. Piled one on another, and clothed with
ivy, they bear a very exact resemblance to ancient mas-
sive masonry, and these walls, sometimes thirty feet in
height, continue, bastion after bastion, turret after turret,


for some distance along the coast. The whole of the cliff
to the Yermande will repay a close examination, although
that harbourage is of itself without interest. Beyond it is
a curious broken creux, a large hole, which can be seen
from the Coupee, forming the extreme point of La Grande
Grhve. We now turn back into the road, and pass within
a yard of a ruined fort, thrown up by the French, who
held the island in the sixteenth century. The site is clearly
marked out by a ditch, a mound, and some ruined stone-
work. As we cross over the Coupee, a broad vein of por-
celain clay and oxides of iron, rich in pinks and bright
orange browns, marks the face of the cliff.




CHAPTER II.
La Seigneurie—Le Port de Moulin — Les Autelets — Les
Sept Moues — Les Boutiques — L’Eperquerie — Les Fon-
taines — Le Creux Balée
We ■will to-day visit the Seigneurie and, by the Port de
Moulin, tracking the north-western coast, reach the Bou-
tiques Caves. This ramble, with a glance at the head-
lands of L’Eperquerie, and the two inlets to the north-
east, will he work for a long summer’s day. Let it be
understood, however, that this sketch points out only the
more remarkable beauties of this island gem. Every one
may find views of soft beauty, of wild majesty, or rugged
savageness, and, according to the bias of the mind, place
themMves in unison with the scenes around them. It is
on this part of the island that we shall find the most com-
plete contrast to the barrenness of Little Serk. Good roads
branch out in every direction, the crops are heavy and
abundant, the pleasant low-roofed farm-houses are gay
with the red fuschia and honeysuckle gleaming on the walls.
A busy mill, the property of the Lord, sings at its work
the harsh Serk patois sounds pleasantly from the lips of
the little ones, as they enjoy their hour out of school, the


blacksmith’s forge hard by rings out the sound of honest
industry, and in the distance the tower of the Seigneurie
rises over all.
The shortest road, by the Rectory, Church, and School-
house, quickly brings us to a stone arched gate, with
seats on either side, forming one entrance into the grounds
of the Seigneurie. As strangers are allowed to pass
freely through the gardens, we might enter here, but
should lose an avenue of trees, meeting over the road.
A simple arched gateway opens, along a shady drive,
to the substantial-looking manor-house, built in 1730, by
the first of the Le Pelleys. The most curious relic in the
island, the ruins of the cell of St. Magloire, was yet visible
within the memory of man. It stood in front of the
angle of the walled garden in the open space before the
house. The grounds are pretty, and peculiar for their
neatness and the admirable intermingling of kitchen stuff,
fruit, and flowers. Their beauty is enhanced by the luxu-
riance of some of our greenhouse plants, growing in the
open air. At the back of the house is a small isolated
tower and tiny battery, in which is a cannon given to the
first Seigneur by Queen Elizabeth. It bears the inscrip-
tion, “ Don de la Eoyne Elizabeth au Seigneur de Serck,
A. D. 1573.” Continuing on our way down shady walks,
and skirting a sheet of water, we pass into a road which
begins to fall suddenly to the shore. On the right are
some cottages, their massive window openings adorned
outside with huge borders of whitewash. On the left, a
streamlet gurgles through a plantation of young trees, and
gives notice of the valley, which widens and deepens before
c


us. Here everything has been done, by tracks and foot-
paths, to make the necessary climbing as little irksome as
possible, and the grandeur of the scenery is a little tamed.
Before descending into the bay, a fine outlook to sea may
be had from a narrow ledge on the face of the precipitous
shale cliffs, that rise three hundred feet from the shore.
We look down on the bold sweep of the hay, met on
one side by a wild and beautiful sienite arch, and on the
other, by an immense isolated rock, called the Tintageux.
This rock is crowned with some scanty herbage, and, per-
haps, at one time, joined the mainland, from which it is
now parted by a narrow passage, leading into the Peganne
bay. It is said to bear a miniature resemblance to Tinta-
gel Castle, and may have been used in early days as a
place of refuge, when the inhabitants were hard pressed,
A pathway by the side of the stream, where the calamint
and other wafer flowers are plentiful, leads us past a tiny
waterfall to a ruined wall, banking up the path. This is
probably the oldest piece of masonry on the island, as it
would seem to have formed part of the works connected
with the monk’s mill, from which the harbour has its
name. A farmhouse, close to the Seigneurie, is still called
the Moinerie ; the platform by the stream is L’Ecluse, and
we learn from the archives of the Abbey of Montebourg
that, one thousand years ago, the monks had here in Serk
a water mill, given in the twelfth century to that abbey
by one William de Vernon.
Arrived on the beach and entering the Peganne, we
find it a chaotic heap of boulders, with treacherous rock
pools, rich in marine, treasures, hid amid the seaweed. A


deep cleft yawns in the cliff, seamed with slanting strata,
rich in bright lichens and its own brilliant colouring. From
this bay there is a fine view of the wild coast southwards.
In many of the Serk bays, and specially in the Port de
Moulin, the most enticing of all, hours may he spent
pleasantly. At low water we wander on from inlet to
inlet, now diving into a cavern, and now tracing a new
vein in the cliff, or gazing at the bold outlying rocks to
sea. If the tide confine us to the central sweep, here are
specimens of granite, trap, soapstone, chalcedony, jasper,
and asbestos ; while the rock pools are full of life, and
the changing seaweeds come to light as the waters fall.
Near the sienite arch there is a smooth black rock, with
the track of the limpet curiously well marked. This crea-
ture was thought to have held fast to one anchorage for
life, but the meandering line of a lighter shade of colour
marks the clearance of the dark lichen with the tongue, as
he takes his daily march, while covered by the sea.
Through the cool archway, with its uneven pink-stained
floor, we enter the choicest surely of islet grottoes. Be-
fore us lies the slippery soapstone, and huge trap boulders
crowd together, with crevices hid beneath the bladder-
wrack. Beyond, the eye wanders to the fairy-like deep
blue sea-basin, with ten feet of liquid clearness, circled in
by a polished mass of rock, ever giving out moisture to the
sun; or to the brown cliff, with its three-mouthed indents,
where the light strays, and wanders, and is lost, and
whence, when the waves run high, comes the loud harsh
voice of their trumpet tongues, sounding above the gale.
Here, too, are the tall isolated pinnacles of the Autelets
o 2


rocks, bathed at this moment in a misty light. The
grimmest and most sunken of the three, paddling in the
waves, stands apart from his companions, who, like some
monk and nun of old Titanic days, stand up closely toge-
ther some forty feet, and, with ludicrous solemnity, bend
to one another throughout all time. The horizontal stra-
tification of the Autelets, and their pillar-like shape, give
them an eccentric and artificial appearance. One glance
at the caves, and irregular outline of the fine bay still in
advance, and again over rock, seaweed, and shingle, we
mount, by the old monks mill wall, to the cottages which
we passed on leaving the Seigneurie.
We now turn up the hill alongside, and, from the seat
on the brow, look out on an extensive view. On the
horizon rises the bold line of Guernsey from the sea,
while, in the mid distance, the rock of Jedthon, with its
belt of reefs, and the shining sands of Hem, detain the
eye, till it wanders along the lines of foam in the troubled
‘ races,’ reaches the rich table land of the island of Bre-
ehou, and slowly travels home past the dark hays, cool in
their half shadows under the glaring sky. We now skirt
the coast towards the north, till the path dwindles to a
track, almost lost in the gorse. At one time it winds
round the brink of a bay, stealthily hid under the brambles ;
and, again, there spreads out a sloping breezy down, with
a few sheep scattered over the short sweet grass. Here,
a wide hedge-bank, and there, a rough stone wall, is cross-
ed, while we look out to Les Sept Moues, steep wide but-
tresses, running up one hundred feet against the sea castle
wall. At length, from an open down, the Point de Nez,


the extreme northern cape, is well in view, and hence a
few yards will take us to the brow above the Boutiques
caves. But first we may descend into some of the nume-
rous inlets, curious, if only for the narrow, coupee-like
ledges of rock, which often part them, and for the large
blocks which have fallen into the shingle from the disin-
tegrated mass. Often the scrambler may be rewarded by
lighting on a rock arch, rich in light, and shade, and
shifting colour, or some long cavern, where, at the fur-
ther end, a sun-ray peeping in at a roof hole, wins for itself a
passage through the dripping darkness to its companions on
the beach. In one of these bays will be found some fine
black rocks, parted from the land and from each other,
bearing the brunt of the waves as they leap along
the jagged and slanting ledges. The down above the
Point de Nez is the largest open space in the island ; and
here are a ruined battery, some rusty cannon, and a humble
shed, the arsenal of the militiamen of Serk. On the
right are the new rifle targets ; and it was off the further-
most headland, a rude bed of granite, that one of the Seig-
neurs, Peter Le Pelley, was, thirty years ago, drowned
with his boatmen. There is a good road to the downs from
the centre of the island.
We must now descend by the fort towards the point till,
on its eastern side, we come abruptly on a yawning chasm,
leaving a narrow footpath on the summit of the cliff. This
chasm forms the easiest entrance to the Boutiques caves,
and on descending the steep and slippery cliff, we find,
about thirty feet above the sea, a hole in the cliff, dipping
deep into the bowels of the earth. Scrambling up to it


amongst the debris, we look down this mouth into a throat
and stomach of grand dimensions. The descent on the
other side is easy, and we then stand in a long lofty cham-
ber, about fifty feet in height aud length. The entrance
is directly under the fretted roof, and the further way lies
down a dark hill of shifting stones, at the bottom of which
can be seen a thin ray of light. There is also another steep
descent to the sea, choked by an immense boulder, which
must have fallen from the roof. The depressing effect of
the gloom is heightened by the silence, sometimes broken
by the distant rush of imprisoned waters. We keep to the
left in descending, and with some difficulty reach the sea-
level, through a narrow cave. Here is a platform, from
which two arched mouths run out to sea, the floor covered
with shallow seaweed pools- The roof drips with water,
and at the sea entry are clusters of bright ferns, in beautiful
contrast with the reddish brown of the quartz-veined rock.
The contrast of light and shade must charm every eye, as
the light streams through into the interior recesses of these
caverns. If we pass out on to the beach through the tun-
nels, ,we shall find it covered with large rocks, and imme-
diately at the cave mouths the earth and stones seem ready
to fall at any moment. With the aid of lights a long
vaulted passage can be explored, and from its further end
at low water we may "pass out on to a terrace, dividing the
extremity of the Point de Nez from the mainland. This
point must be about a quarter of a mile from the hole in
the cliff, at which we entered. Although these subterranean
chambers are not so interesting as the Gouliots, nor so
intricate as the caverns of the Baye de la Yille, they pene


trate more deeply into the rock, and are especially remark-
able on that account.
Again at the arsenal shed, we may at low water pass
down into the harbour of L’Eperquerie, where a few fish-
ing boats lie high upon the reef of rocks. By way of wind-
lass, a rusty cannon or two are fixed, muzzle upwards, in
the soil, and some crab-pots are lying on the shingle. A
small cave lies ronnd the arm of the harbourage to the
north. If there is yet an hour of ebb tide, the flat reef to
the east can be crossed, and an entrance found into the
bay of Les Fontaines. From this part ofthe coast the blue
line of Alderney, and the cliffs and broad sands of France,
are plainly visible. The bay is a very land of seaweeds.
Here, at the lower watermarks, are the dark bladder-
wrack, the glossy Irish moss, and the green and purple
Lavers. The waves, too, have rolled in an “ embarras
des richesses ” during the last wild gale. The stout oar-
weed, a flexible brown stick, with one fringed and fanlike
leaf; the sea-hanger, a brown riband, edged with purple
and white, spotted along its length; the long thin shiny
sea-cord, and many another plant besides, have been forced
on the beach, in one long and rounded cable of all colours.
But if alone, remember that over and between the rocks
the weed is heavy and thick, and hides many a sharp cor-
ner and deep hollow, where a fall might bring death, with
the resistless surging tide. Here, too, are numerous
indents and caves so characteristic of the island, cunningly
hidden among the rocks, and often carpeted some feet
deep with the refuse of the sea.
At the further end of the bay is a cave, some yards in


length, which should be entered. It ends in an inclined
plain of soft yellow earth, leading up to an immense hole,
called Le Creux Balee. This chasm opens on to the sum-
mit of the cliff, and is magnificently fringed with fern, and
the dark ivy, the drooping bramble, and the long dank
grass. It seems yet in course of formation, for the earth,
half choking the opening into the cave, is day by day sink-
ing, and passing out on to the beach with the falling tide.
One of the rock arches is also worth notice. It stands
alone near low-water mark, answering no purpose, black,
massive, and with sharp cut edges, in all points save ugli-
ness, the sea type of our triumphal arches. We are
reminded in such a. scene as this, that where the wave now
splashes idly, the cry of the unhappy seaman has been
lost in the foaming surf, and his body dashed into the
tombs of this grand old island citadel.
From the creux there is an ascent over the rock, by a
bare foothold, to the cliff, close to its upper mouth. The
hollow is, however, so clothed with ivy and bramble, that
it cannot be well seen. It is placed at the bottom of a pic-
turesque dingle, through which runs a path to Le Fort,
by the side of a stream of water. From the extreme edge
towards the sea runs out a narrow and lofty rock. There
is barely room to pass along the ridge, and a dip in the cen-
tre is filled with gorse; but this way lie some fine bold
indents, and a careful step or two will land the scrambler
on a reef at the base of the cliff. Near this spot is one of
the finest seaweed pools in the island, abounding in trea-
sures. The bay eastwards has a singular form, for the sea,
having once worked through the outer granite, has found


but slight resistance in the micaceous schist further inland,
and has formed a long narrow inlet, with curious hollows.
On the further side of a long ridge of granite is a second
hay, with two caves and some hold scattered rocks. A good
climber and hearty lover of the beautiful will now scale the
reef eastwards. Beyond is a mass of black sullen rock,
parted rarely by shingle inlets, so tortuous, that from some
the sea is not visible. They are clothed up their sides with
grass, ivy, and ferns, and frequently a streamlet falling
over the cliff, has hollowed a spot at the head of the bay,
where the asplenium marinum is ever drooping under the
trickling shower. There are, also, a few caves among
these rocky bulwarks, which at length terminate in the
point of La Banquette. On this platform lie some crab-
pots and fishing gear, and from it is a good view of theßaye
de la Ville and the bold slope of the intervening coast.
From La Banquette a path winds up to a cluster of houses
called Le Fort, This hamlet has its name from one of the
forts, erected by the French in the days of Edward the
Sixth. A carriage road leads hence to the Carrefour, and
by the church, or the post-office, to our hotel,


CHAPTER III.
Parsonage — Church —La Ville — Baye de la Ville—Chapelle
Mauve — Dog’s Cave—La Yalette — Mascline —Le Creux
La Collinette.
The bays and caves on the north-east coast, opening
out of the Baye de la Yille, are but little visited ; yet for
singular intricacy and striking beauty they will vie with
anything in Serk. They have but one entry from the
land, and are difficult of access, owing to the abundance of
sea-weed and the many slippery boulders that lie in the
path. The way lies along the high roads, through the
centre of the island, past the Rectory and Church. The
Rectory is of old date, and was the residence of the De
Carterets, the first Seigneurs of Serk. Some adjoining
cottages are, also, of the seventeenth century. The view
hence is a pretty one, over vale and upland, nor is there
sight or sound of the sea that girts us round. The road from
the Rectory to the Church, and the borders of the church-
yard, have been planted with trees and flowers. In a field
near the girls’ school, there stood till recently a cromlech,


the last of many which are thought to have been scattered
over the island. The churchyard is open to the road, and
has a few well-chosen head-stones. Amongst them is one
to the memory of a daughter of the present Seigneur, who
died of diptheria in 1860. The church was built in 1820,
by a late Seigneur, Peter Le Pelley, whose untimely death
is recorded on a tablet inside the building. He was drown-
ed, in sight of the Point de Nez, while attempting to cross
over to Guernsey in a storm, and his body was not reco-
vered. The stone reminds us, that “ The sea shall give
up its dead.” The church has no architectural beauty and is
filled with high pews. A large pulpit leans against the east
wall, having on one side the rector's pew, while the chan-
cel, with the communion table, is crowded into the north
corner. The present building is to be improved as soon as
sufficient funds can be raised. Formerly the islanders wor-
shipped in a barn, near the Rectory.
A few steps past the church bring us to the boys’ school,
built substantially, as are the poorest cottages, of granite.
It is endowed, but the farmers make a payment in kind
to the master, while the poorer children enter free. They
frequently remain till they are fifteen years of age, and
many learn English as well as French.
Turning to the right by the school, and catching a
glimpse of the Seigneurie tower, we reach the Wesleyan
chapel, whence a path through a farm-yard brings us to the
down, overlooking the coast of France, With some trou-
ble a path will be found into the Baye de la Yille, which
is covered with beautiful varieties of granite pebbles,
rounded bj the sea. We pass, by a rock arch and inclined


pinnacles, towards the eastern extremity of the bay. Here,
a huge block of granite lies on the beach, shaped externally
like some giant’s barn. The roof ridge is perhaps forty
feet from the ground, and it has been pierced through by
the sea. The roof is curiously carved, and the rocks
hanging down from it, till their long and narrow edges
catch the eye, have doubtless helped to give this wall of
granite its name of La Chapelle Mauve. As nearly half a
mile of caves and rough climbing is now before us, it is
well to be here at least an hour before low water, for, at
many points in advance, half ebb would cut us off, and
force us to take refuge on the cliff. The sea is again visi-
ble on passing through La Chapelle Mauve, and ahead is a
large heap of debris of disintegrated granite. On the fur-
ther side of the heap there is a descent into a cave of some
length, entered by the sea at high tide. The beautiful
pink colour of the stone, and the fine rockpools at its fur-
ther end, are its chief characteristics.
We are now again by the sea, and, passing a narrow
passage twixt two walls of rock, enter on a wilderness of
sea-weed in a picturesque bay. After a minute’s scram-
bling, we find a cave in the further arm, and are asto-
nished and delighted to see light at the further end, giving
hopes of further discoveries. There would, however, seem
but little chance of getting out, for the sides incline at a
sharp angle, leaving but a very narrow passage with a rise
in the ground. Encouraged by the light ahead, difficulties
are overcome, and on reaching it we find that we must pass
from out of. this prison on hands and knees, for the rock
has nearly met the shelving shingle on the further side.


We are again in a bay, the debris slippery with wet
weed, while the high rocks towering overhead are shut in by
the waves. If we look back, when halfway across, to the nar-
row cleft through which we have just emerged, it is hardly
to be distinguished in that seamed face. Everywhere around
are fissures of greater or less depth in the dark overhang-
ing rock, save where the dreariness of the view is relieved
by a steep grassy slope, rising from the beach almost to the
summit of the cliff. The eye, tired with the gloom and
savageness of the scene through which we have passed,
rests with pleasure on the rough tufts of brittle grass, the
tall bracken, the samphires, catchflies, and other sea-shore
plants. Another cave awaits us when we have crossed
the tangled weed, and scared many a goby and lurking
crab in their rock-pool homes.
Here we seem to have reached the end of our scramble.
The wall of rocks runs far into the sea, and the inner
hollow looks dreary enough, relieved only by the delicate
pink of the rocky floor. But stay awhile, and as you face
the darkness, a thin streak of light is thrown along the
ground. Track it to the source, and there, under a large
boulder, which has nearly fallen to the ground, lies a fur-
ther way. A crawl enables us, at length, to stand upright
in a curious crevice, opening into yet another bay, the
finest and the last. A sea-palace might have stood here;
and these rocks and boulders of fantastic shapes, with their
sharply-cut outlines and the amphitheatre of arch and cave
behind, readily answer to the idea. The recesses of this
bay are all under one huge dome, hung with ferns and
coloured with quartz veins. On one side they are entered


from beneath a rugged arch, through which are seen the
beetling rocks of La Grande Moue, so close that they would
seem to hem the waves upon the shore. The artificial cha-
racter of the rock is further borne out by some sturdy
pigmy pillars, with their dark depths between, the entrance
to a temple of some sea-elfin race.
Near this arch is the Dog’s Cave, thelast of theseinteresting
windings beneath the cliff. Though some 30 or 40 yards in
length, light enters at the further end, for the sides sloping
gradually towards each other, have found themselves yet a
foot or two apart when they raised their heads into the
daylight. But the roof is not open all along its length, for
many a loosened boulder has rattled down the cliff, and
while some have fallen through to the floor, others have
rested on the roof, and thus left but a few gleams of light
to show how the cave w r as formed. Is is well not to tarry
on the return, for the tide rises speedily.
Any one interested in the formation of these caves, will
do well to visit the one last named from above. It is
reached by a pathway leading from the cliff, after passing
the chapel; hut as the holes lie hidden with gorse, ivy,
and brake-fern, it is, perhaps, the most dangerous spot in
Serk about which to scramble without aid. Many of the
islanders know these curious chasms well. The rocks
lying out at sea are here specially bold and prominent, La
Grande Moue, a worn and pinnacled pile, and, further
distant, La Noire Pierre. The tide running swiftly past,
the basaltic appearance of the granite, the dark, almost
black colour given by the lichen just above high-water
mark, in contrast with the red of the rock, and the paler


tints at half ebb, form a singular but wild and beautiful
picture. The openings into the cave are about one hun-
dred and fifty feet above the sea, and are found above
some grand pillars of white rock, which have fallen to the
shore in steep confused masses. On the brink of this
barren precipice, amongst the ivy and brambles, are two
small boulders, which have supported each other as they
fell. Step carefully beneath them, and look down amid
the ferns. We see only a dark subterranean chamber,
about forty feet in height, hut a few stones thrown down
prove that, below, there is yet a further depth. In fact,
the floor of this chamber is the roof up to which we looked
when in the cave on the shore, and it was probably formed
by the rocks falling from the real roof, and stayed in their
descent. A good “ differ ” may readily enter this upper
hall through a hole above a grassy slope. The floor is
uneven, with deep dangerous crevices, and on every side
are large masses ready to detach themselves from the walls.
At the further end the floor abruptly terminates, and the
eye is caught by the glittering pebbles of the cave, one
hundred feet beneath us. There are similar holes of
smaller size higher up the cliff.
The return home may be varied by taking the road
to the left, on reaching the chapel at La Yille. This will
lead us to La Yalette, a cluster of houses overlooking a bay
called La Maseline. The bed of a running stream serves
for a footpath to the shore, but we shall act wisely by
remaining on the cliff, and crossing the stream to the right.
Near the Maseline a bare rock juts out seawards, and from
this spot there is a fine view of the reef named Les Burons,


and the Creux harbour. In simmer-time islanders will
often be found here, watching the excursion steamers, or
the cutters and fishing-boats threading their way between
the rocks which outlie this north-eastern coast. From the
cliff there is a path into the harbour road, which winds
valleywise between two of the boldest hills in Serk. They
are covered up their sides with gold gorse and bracken fern,
and are not lost till they reach the centre of the island.
We have now reached the tiny harbour of Le Creux, and
pass into it through a tunnel in the rook, cut by Hilary de
Carteret, the first Seigneur, three hundred years ago. The
built arch on the harbour side yet bears the date of 1538.
On entering the harbour we are struck by its isolated cha-
racter. In front,' a breakwater leaves but a narrow passage
for the sea, which rolls lazily in on the scanty beach.
Overhead and on all sides are huge overhanging rocks,
looking down proudly on the little beings shouting and
working below. But the Creux should be visited at even-
ing, when the Serk cutter, reaching home, is welcomed by
the islanders, waiting for friends, or goods, or letters. Then
the soft light of the moon, the sough and shifting glow of
the waves, as they fall or are parted by the movement of
the boats, the unusual uproar, the dark gloom of the rock-
shadows, with the lanterns picking out bright bits of colour
in their uncertain gleam, combine to create a beautiful
picture. The harbour is, however, much exposed, and but
a few years since, a storm brought the cutter over the
breakwater into the anchorage. Many of the smaller boats
were sunk and damaged, but the retiring wave sucked the
cutter out to sea, and she was afterwards recovered unin


jured. In tliat gale the Serkese lost forty large boats,
which their poverty has never allowed them to replace.
Another harbour at L’Eperquerie, a much more sheltered
and convenient anchorage, has been proposed, and should
it ever be carried out, will be a great boon to all.*
The harbour beach was, till within the last few years,
the one post-office of Serk, and oftentimes each islander his
own postman, coming down if he expected letters, to look
for them on the shore. Great opposition was made to any
alteration, as a breach of the feudal system. The Serk
parliament adopted as their rallying cry, “ Privilege and
no Taxation,” and so fearful were the inhabitants of some
danger to person or property underlying this connection
with the central government, that many posted their letters
at night, in order that the sender might escape discovery.
The authorities in London were, for their part, not less
perverse in requiring that, spite of winds and currents,
letters should go and come at fixed days and hours. An-
cient custom and red tape alike gave way, however, to the
convenience of to-day. A post-office was established in
1857, and as many as 1400 letters have left the island in
the course of one summer month. We return up the
Creux road, and after a hilly walk of half a mile in and
out amongst the hollows, where the stunted trees bend
their backs against the wind, we pass a cottage or two,
and reach a farmhouse sheltered from the gales. The
Collinette and Post-office are now close by, a cluster of
houses at the meeting of four roads. Through a gate we
enter a road, bright with flowers and evergreens, and soon
are in front of the Parsonage, near the hotel.

CHAPTER IV.
Dixcart Bay — Petit Dixcart — Hog’s Back—Le Chateau-
Creux Terrible — Baye Terrible — Le Loche — Pinarie.
Outside the hotel there are on the left two roads. The
nearer dives down between high hanks, whence the twisted
roots of the orchard trees on either side have thrust them-
selves into the way, while their branches hanging thickly
overhead have shut out sunlight and given a home to the
fern fronds. At the bottom of the hollow is a streamlet
threading its way along the level till presently its pleasant
murmur is lost amongst the trees and underwood hiding
the valley of Dixcart. A path across the common, which
borders on the stream, leads to La Collinette.
The second road rises up the hill and is divided into two
paths. The upper path continues to rise till it reaches
the brow of the cliff, and winds round a house which, un-
sheltered from the gales, fronts the sea. On the further
side of the valley is the ridge of the Hog’s Back ; the naked
granite clothed with yellow gorse as the hill side slopes into
the valley. After skirting the bay of Dixcart, this path


passes down to the shore between the hills. The lower
path winds down through Petit Dixcart, the prettiest hit
of inland scenery in Serk. The gorge, the bracken, bright
heaths, and many flowers, are on the banks above us and
at our feet. Further down is a thicket of underwood and
dwarf trees, closing in a low-roofed farmhouse and sending
up a sound of running waters. The valley turns as it
descends yet lower between the hills, till broken off some
height up the cliffs of Dixcart bay.
As we set foot on the broad stretch of sand, a rock arch,
joined to the cliff and capped with short grass, is on our
right, and through it the bay can be crossed, till at low
water some beautiful caverns, arches, and boulder rocks,
can he reached, which lie together round its western arm.
They abound in the treasures of the sea. The ‘ mes ’ and
‘ crass ’ anemones stud the lower stones, and the sea plants
in the pools are always astir with life. One arch espe-
cially is a very home of the shrimp, the gobies, and the
shy sidling crabs. A summer’s day usually finds a few
strangers in Dixcart, enjoying the strengthening breezes,
and the song of the swell as it whitens the black rock of
L’Etat and the coast of Little Serk. Towards the east is
a bed of sharp rock under the sea-weeds, and there at
spring tides you may spend an hour, with basket and iron
hook, in searching for the ormer, a shell fish, in shape
and size like an oyster, which fixes itself upon rocks near
the surface of the sea.
From this hay we may, by the farmhouse in the valley,
cross the stream and ascend the Hog’s Back close to the
mill. Hence is the best view of the valley ; and Le Cha-
d 2


teau, the furthest point of pinnacled granite, is the best
spot in this part of the island for the enjoyment of the pecu-
liar beauty of the coast. On the one side is the soft charm
of Dixcart, with its sands and green slopes; and on the other,
the eye ranges over the dark stern cliffs, rugged indents,
and rude rocky floor of the Baye Terrible.
If we again descend to the valley, a good road will be
found rising from the farmyard up the hill. The first turn
to the right leads through a field into a meadow with a
steep slope. A footpath by the nearer hedge enters the
gorse towards the sea and terminates abruptly. We are
now on the brink of the Creux Terrible, a round hole one
hundred and fifty feet in depth, and some thirty feet across
the mouth, yawning on the beach below. It is connected
with the sea by two archways in the rock. There is no
trace of the mass of earth and disintegrated granite that
has fallen through, and in its place the beach is covered
with sea-weed left by the waves. This spot should he
visited at high tides during a gale from the west. The
wave-crests then roar through the caverns, rush chafing
and angry into the cauldron, and, lashing the walls, throw
their yellow foam high into the air. Those who are anxi-
ous to descend into the Baye Terrible and look up through
the “ creux,” will find some difficulties in their way. One
glance at the precipitous cliffs, and a very little experience
of the flaky yielding character of the rock, will render the
descent troublesome. We shall first do well to look down
the chasm from its lowest side, as it discovers the strata
and character of the walls. From this spot a raised hank
is seen, across the furze hedge of the meadow, winding


along for some distance. This bank, keeping by the cliffs,
brings us to a cunning opening in the ivy, down which lies
the path to the bay. Half way are two iron rings to ease
the descent.
One chief charm of Serk is the remarkable variety of its
wild scenery, and the Baye Terrible is a good example.
Though we have here, as elsewhere, lofty cliffs of granite
and other primary rooks; pillars, and blocks, cast in chaotic
disorder on the shore, caves and winding indents; it has
also with these its own proper charm and beauty. This
lies in the rude architectural appearance of the lower parts
of the cliff. It is a rough-hewn temple, a first-bom
inchoate idea of nature, teaching us her power. Close by
the track are some isolated pillars, which stand out boldly
when washed by the sea at high water; and a little further
a cave winds through the rock with two passages. In the
centre of the bay is a brown column, whence spring two
arches, and on entering beneath them, we find, at some
distance, a large circular base, as though a second pillar
had been in course of formation. We pass beyond these
pillars, through one passage to another running at right
angles, by which there is again access to the beach.
The Creux, also, whose chasm lies some distance within
the rock, is entered through two beautiful arched grottoes,
rich in colour, and fitting antechamber to the sombre hall,
whence light and air seem buried under the dark overhang-
ing walls. Beyond the Creux, and behind a lofty ridge,
will be found a recessed cove, with arched and isolated
rocks. The coast of Little Serk, the black L’Etat, and
a few smaller rocks, are well seen from here, and on


the left is the remarkable Point Terrible. This promon-
tory is insular in form, and sweeps round harbour-wise,
with some bare pinnacled rocks rising above its steep grassy
slope. The feeling of loneliness induced by these scenes is
hardly lessened by the harsh scream of the gull, and the
grating inroll of an Atlantic swell.
We may pass on along the Point Terrible, as it gra-
dually narrows towards the sea, till we reach a neck of
land, where the point is nearly cut through. It is yet pos-
sible to pass round to the extremity by descending the rock
to the left, only care must be taken, owing to the crumbling
nature of the soil. From Little Serk this headland, and
that of Le Chateau, present a very curious appearance.
Like great holdfasts thrown by the island into the sea, they
seem to steady her against the gales, or as the cruel out-
stretched hands of some giant monster, they watch motion-
less for their prey. On the eastern side of the point is a
bay worth a visit, both for its caves, and because it is the
only inlet between the Creux and the Baye Terrible acces-
sible by land. From this point the path winds along the
cliff,,and every step opens on a new and beautiful picture.
We pass many a picturesque grouping of granite boulders,
covered with grey and yellow lichens, and many a hoarse-
sounding inlet and green headland, till we rest on a flat
and extensive down, overlooking a harbourage, known as
Les Loches. On one of the points will be found a
cannon, one of the many round the coast which are
nearly all unserviceable through long exposure.
A narrow path runs down to Les Loches, and halfway
is a platform, with a view of the Creux harbour, and the


Burons rocks, sweeping round in a bold amphitheatre to
the east. A little lower the path passes over the ridge of
a narrow promontory, having on one side a deep chasm,
where the sea breaks in between the cliffs. Lower yet,
close to the water-mark, is a rock-ledge, whence the moor-
ing ropes stretch out to a dozen little fishing-boats dancing
at their anchorage. In the middle of the bay the cutter
swings lazily, and at our feet a swift current runs through
a dark grim passage. The sea is a clear blue and of great
depth, while amongst the hollows of the cliffs the lights
and shadows play fitfully over the warm colouring of the
rock.
From the down, the coast should be skirted, till the
bleak bold valley is opened, at the bottom of which runs
the harbour road. On the precipice that borders the side
of the valley is a spot overlooking the Creux harbour, four
hundred feet below, and much frequented by visitors, who
gather here to watch the arrival and departure of the cutter
and steamers. From this side large masses of rock have
sometimes fallen into the harbour, sinking and breaking up
some of the smaller boats.
We may now descend into the road, or, retracing our
steps to the down, enter a path running inland opposite
Les Loches. Here we are met by many traces of the fer-
tility which characterizes the interior of the island, and
adds so greatly to the charm of Serk, by its strong contrast
to the bare and sullen majesty of the scenery round the
coast. A farmhouse, called the Forge, lies at the bottom
of a hollow in the road, and it has on one of the walls a
woman’s likeness well painted. The owner of this property


is a character somewhat feared by his neighbours. Amongst
other eccentricities, he is said to sling a cot amongst the
trees of his orchard in autumn, and to give public notice
that no man or lad will trespass twice. The hamlet of
La Pinarie here comes into view, while we are still among
dwarf trees and hedge flowers, and look over on the gorse-
covered valley of the Creux. Passing through a gate on
the left, beyond the Pinarie, we are brought by a bridle
road on to a common. This is one of the highest points in
Serk, and round us are the church, parsonage, and La
Collinette. The cornfields are yellow under an August
sun, and the sea glitters in the distance between the hills.
The down is lost in the dingle; and crossing a stream at
the bottom, we enter a deeply-sunk road, leading under
the trees to our hostelry.




CHAPTER V.
Havre Gosselin — Cave — Brechon — Gonliot Caves — La
Voroque — Cemetery — Port de la Jument-
La Moinerie — Port és Sées.
On the Coupee road, immediately opposite to the cross
road to the hotel, is a gate opening into a field. Close to
this gate lies the way by some cottages to the Port es Sees.
This bay, though somewhat difficult of approach, is well
worth a visit for its picturesque wildness, the colouring of
the rocks, and minor features of beauty peculiarly its
own. Our path, after skirting the first field, turns
sharply to the right, and opens through a gate, held
together and hinged with ropes, on to a sunken dingle.
Directly in front the smiling valley is met at some distance
by the perpendicular fall of the cliff: on either side rise
smooth grassy hills, with a narrow belt of blue sea glitter-
ing in the sun. A wooded hollow skirts the coast, and a
path along its side brings us amongst the trees, through the
farmyard of Beauregard, into the public road. After
passing on the left a pretty Devonshire lane, leading through


the valley to the Port es Sees, we soon reach the common,
where the road comes to an end. We pass to the left,
keeping the way by the hedge, till we enter a sloping sward,
cropped close by a few sheep and tethered cattle. One
step over a low wall, and a view, perhaps unique, lies
stretched around us, and at - our feet.
The scenery of this island has been declared by travel-
lers to he equal of its kind to the most renowned spots else-
where; and in all Serk this is, perhaps, the finest group
of combined rock, sea, down, and dingle. It is true that
all is in miniature, the height of the cliffs nowhere exceeds
three hundred feet, and the outlying rocks, however rugged,
hold, and irregular in outline, are not so huge and massive
as to induce awe or terror. Moreover, the area is of no
great extent, and yet every one is struck with the majesty
as well as the extreme beauty of the scene. The first
impression, perhaps, is that of a natural harbour, formed
by a circular sweep of rock of great extent. The appear-
ance of safety is, however, disturbed by the troubled
waters near the seeming breakwater, showing that there
are jmseen passages through the granite wall. In fact, the
extremity of the line of rocks is formed by the curious and
interesting island of Brechou, or He des Marchands, a
lofty mass of gneiss, covered with rich mould. The bare
sides of this table land are marked with every form of
headland, and dark seams run deeply into the cl'ff. Be-
tween Brechou and the mainland is a large rock, capped
with short grass, called La Moie de Gouliot; and it is in
these passages that the stream runs furiously, marking its
course through the open sea with long lines of foam and


boiling eddies. In bad weather the Gouliot tides are very
dangerous for small boats, and but a short time since,
some visitors perished here while attempting to return to
Guernsey in rough weather. One or two large vessels
have been saved from shipwreck by shooting the Gouliot
streams; a dangerous experiment, owing to the narrow
space between the Brechou and the Moie de Gouliot, and
to the overfall caused by the violent under currents. The
small summer steamers sometimes use this passage, and,
for inexperienced passengers, it is an anxious moment, as
the little vessel steams merrily in between the dark rocks,
and lashing the white current, seems for an instant em-
bayed amongst the jagged points within a stone’s-tbrow of
her decks, till she glides out of the turmoil into the quiet
bay of the Havre Gosselin. From the top of the cliff on
which we stand, there will be seen a large dark cleft in the
headland, running out towards Le Moie de Gouliot; one of
the entrances to the famed Gouliot caves. There are
many other deep seams in the granite, adding in then-
mystery an element of beauty, while they seem natural
adjuncts of these riven rocks and angry waters. Below
are some bare masses, of varied shapes, set in the midst of
the currents, like the unfinished foundation of a gigantic
pier. These are bounded towards the shore by long flat
reefs, black with lichens. In the distance is Jedthou
gleaming in the sun, and Guernsey rises yet further on the
horizon.
A track descends towards a platform, whence the rocks
shelve down steeply for fifty feet into the bay of Havre
Gosselin, and here is a rope to aid the fishermen in gaining


a foothold. The rope is succeeded at high-water mark by
an iron ladder. The descent is not difficult, and from the
ledge by the ladder, covered with rusty rings for fixing
the mooring lines of the fishing-boats, there is a fine view.
Before us is the wide spread of the bay, with its narrow
shore running up to the grass and ferns between the cliffs,
where lie a few gifts of the sea to the island lord, a plank
or two covered with ship barnacles, and riddled by the
teredo, and perchance a broken mast or rudder. The
bay seems land-looked from our ledge, for everywhere
rises the rocky wall, nor is an outlet visible, save where a
gleam of light glints on the other side through the dark
entry of the Gouliots. A large isolated rock to the left
beautifully exhibits the pellucid clearness of the bright blue
wave, for far below is seen the upright base, clothed with
waving sea-weeds. A few boats are at anchor, a sea-gull
is wheeling overhead, and at long intervals there comes the
lowering thunder of the waves, breaking against and filling
some cavern mouth. And now'having enjoyed a first
glance at one of the most beautiful outlooks in Serk, we re-
mount the rope ladder, and take the path at the top, leading
to a black reef close by the water’s edge. Here again
are some isolated rocks with currents between them of
remarkable clearness, darkened by the shadows. On this
reef may often be heard plainly that booming sound as of
distant artillery, common in rough weather along the
coast. There is in the middle of the rock a deep narrow
cleft, admitting the sea, which is just visible under our
feet, whence this sound arises. At some points it is roofed
in, and on the summit of the rock is nowhere more than


two feet in width, presenting the appearance of a long
chamber, with many roof holes. The sea pours in, fills
the entrance, and rushing along, forces the air upwards
with a dull roar. The same effect is produced by the
waves striking and filling the mouths of the caves.
Once again on the summit of the cliff, by the low wall,
the stranger will do well to descend the rocks on the side
of Little Serk, as he will thereby obtain a good view of the
interior of one of the finest sea caves in the island. It lies
to the left of the reef, and is best seen from a platform on
the rock. The arch is bold and lofty, at the end of a long
broad passage, worn by the sea through the midst of a bed
of granite. A boat can be pushed far into the cave, which
is of considerable depth. In the moonlight, or at dark, the
torch lights up with a fitful glare the fretted roof, the trou-
bled waters, and the dim figures of our companions. The
waves rise and fall harshly against the walls with an
unceasing noise, till they dash on the floor of the innermost
recess with a sullen broken roll, which echoes and re-echoes
out into the air. From the mouth of these dark stem halls
the bold outlines of the Port es Sees, the broad sands of the
Grand Greve, and the wild fantastic headlands near the
Vermande, in Little Serk, are all finely grouped. Indeed
a few hours’ pull amongst the creeks of the south-western
coast, will result in a host of picturesque bits. There is
specially one narrow indent, between the Port es Sees and
the Havre Gosselin, which should be seen in rough wea-
ther from the Coupee, on the top of the cliff.
We must now return to the public road, and pass
through the second of the two gates, in which it terminated.


Here the path winds round the head of a pretty valley,
and passes some cottages built against the hill side. This
is the Fregonde, and hence there is a way into the bay of
Havre Gosselin, which we have already seen from the rope
ladder. There is in this bay a large cavern, which can be
entered only at low water. Crossing a stone wall, along-
side the cottage chimneys, a path leads to a gate and cattle
shed on the down. Near this spot is a noble headland of
granite, advancing into the Gouliot stream, called the Saut
de Juan. From its further point we look across the narrow
passage to the Moye de Gouliot, which is again parted
from the steep sides of Brechou by the turbulent Gouliot
stream.
The island of Brechou is well worth a visit. It can
hardly he said to have any bay or harbour, as the waves at
flood rise to the base of the cliff, at the only landing-place.
The outlying rocks are, if possible, wilder than on the
coast of Serk, and near them are some overfalls and cur-
rents. On the side of Brechou, opposite the Havre Gos-
selin, there is a deep chamber in the rock, called the
Pirates’ Cave. It would seem to have earned its title, for
some years since the miners working for copper, discovered
in it some wood, and three feet of red ashes, with other
marks of occupancy. Brechou belongs to the Seig-
neur, and was for a long time a rabbit warren, but now
there are abundant crops, and two resident families. The
western side is peculiarly bold, and is belted with reefs.
It was on a rock off this coast, called Neste, that, one hun-
dred years ago, an East Indiaman was wrecked dose to
the shore. She had treasure on board, affirmed to be yet


in iron boxes on the rocks; and, only some twenty years
back, divers engaged on the government works at Alder-
ney were employed to search for it. Owing to a dispute
with the Seigneur, the quest was soon abandoned. From
the east point, where irregular piles of granite are massed
together, there is a fine view of the coast of Serk. The
Havre Gosselin, and the wide stretch towards Little Serk,
look from one point like two mountain lakes, being enclosed
from the sea by projecting headlands. On the cliff side of
the pathway, leading up from the landing-place, is a
remarkable bed of shingle, cropping out of the soft rock.
It is of considerable thickness, and seems to prove that
Brechou was, at a comparatively recent period, after the
reckoning of geologists, heaved up to a greater height
above the sea. The old beach is, perhaps, fifteen feet
above the present one, and lies back some distance from
high water.
Eeturning to the Saut de Juan, we pass down a gorge,
separating it from a perpendicular cliff, having at the
bottom a long narrow inlet. There is here an echo of
some power. The way now winding round to the south,
passes along an escarpement in the face of the cliff, which
is smooth disintegrated granite, sloping at an acute angle.
A bay, choked with fallen boulders, lies at the bottom of
the path, so walled in on either hand, that a stranger
might come and go without knowledge of the wonderful
palace hidden beneath the rocks. If the sea is at
flood, the path should be nearly descended, till a large
dark hole becomes visible on the face of the cliff, about
twenty feet above the bay. This is the “ chimney,” and


the view from it into the interior of the large Gouliot cave
is at this time always beautiful, and often imposing, and
even terrible. The sloping floor is covered with large
fallen masses, and the sides incline outwards till they meet
a lofty fretted roof, looking into a long winding hall, run-
ning north and south into the sea, while two corridors
pass out westward. The outlet visible from our standing
point looks out on the Havre Gosselin, and here the tide
rushes through with great swiftness and turbulence. The
noise and dash is often most impressive ; the waters cover
the arch for an instant with a curtain, and then, rushing
at our feet through the twilight, pass out of sight along
the windings, leaving a doubled and redoubled roar, as the
waves roll into the passages of the inner Gouliots. The
sides of the cave present a smooth surface, and meet
the floor at an obtuse angle. The effects of light and
shade the rather delight us, as the entrances are all, save
cue, hidden by the devious form of the cave
There is another point of view, which at half ebb is,
perhaps, the best. We reach it by entering the bay and
climbing over one of the rock walls. On the other side the
rock runs up to a large opening of the cave towards Bre-
chou, and we are able to penetrate some distance under the
lofty roof. The darkness, the curious fissures behind our
ledge, where the sea is chafing, the waves and lines of
foam close at our feet, the angry combat of the currents
entering in at either end, whirling up the spray, and the
intense blue of the waters under the sunlight at the arch,
create a scene of the rarest and most wild beauty. A rough
day, and a time when the waves begin to leave the higher


parts of the rocks that crowd the floor, should be chosen.
When the tide is out the cave would he hardly recog-
nized. A bay is then left open from the mouth towards
Brechou, and the whole length of fifty yards is quite dry.
If we pass into it we shall find it not unlike in shape to the
human ear. The walls are covered to some height with
the common red and blue anemones, and there is sometimes
a beautiful glimpse of light, through a long straight open-
ing, into the inner Gouliot cave. This passage is impassa-
ble owing to a deep pool.
The inner caves can be seen only at spring tides, and
then the Gouliots are indeed magnificent and unique. They
have been declared by some of our best naturalists to be
unmatched throughout the British Islands. The way lies
through a curious low double-arched rock, attached to the
cliff at the extremity of the bay. This grotto is covered
with anemones and batches of the yellow eggs of the pur-
pura and whelk, intermixed with spongy masses of red
and orange. This little treasure-house of marine life is but
a foreshadow of the beauty of the larger halls into which
it is the entrance. The sea has left a narrow margin of
shingle, and at its further end is the archway of a narrow
lofty gallery. Before it, the walls are brilliantly coloured
with actinias, but within, hardly a speck of granite is visible.
All is one mass of sleepy life, waiting for the returning
waters. There are three outlets from the main hall, and
each may be said to be inhabited by a distinct class of
marine creation.
As we enter, the red and green anemones, mixed with
the large, dark, ugly shell of one of the balani, reaching
E


high up the rocks, gradually give place to rarer sorts.
Madrepores, corallines, sponges, are on the walls; and
beneath the stones are oysters, the prickly sea-urchin, the
five-fingered star-fish, and many other curious creatures.
But it is hardly possible to give any idea of these singularly
interesting caverns, with their host of treasures. The
contrast of colours is most beautiful. The tints of the
varied life change from browns and greens to warm orange,
deep purple and even bright yellows. And often large
masses of some one colour will be found, where a colony
of some distinct genus has ousted every stranger. There
is specially one such spot at the further end, where
a view opens into the caves just before they wind out to
sea. Here, in a dark corner, close by a pool, is a cluster
of brilliant flesh colour and pale orange. It is the home
of the actinia dianthus, the most beautiful of our English
anemones. They fill a space of about three feet square,
and it would be worth swimming the pool at high water
from the upper Gouliot cave, in order to see their fan-like
tentacles moved by the waves. A dive into the sea-pas-
sages would also be amply repaid, only avoiding the whip-
lash and other plants which are readily seen beneath the
clear blue. We should mention, that it is impossible to
touch the walls without being struck in the face by the tiny
jets of water proceeding from a beautiful little purple
mouth ; and even the pebbles on the floor have on them
some small pure white globes, or a few delicate pink cups.
Our cave is specially called the Tubularia Cave. The
walls are literally covered with masses of light brown brit-
tle tufts, like decayed birch twigs, which stand out a few


inches, with a fungus-like appearance. It is hard to be-
lieve that these are living creatures, but when under water
a delicate rose knob, with minute tentacles, protrudes from
the end of each brown stalk. Here is also the alcyonium
digitatum, a most repulsive creature, thrust forward at
right angles to the rock, and only too like in shape, size,
and colour to the human finger. But the water will
will force us back from the haunts of their king long before
we would, and we hasten to retrace our steps before retreat
is cut off.
We now return to the Saut de Juan, but instead of
passing through the gate, may turn to the left on the
down, passing a ruined building. A track on the gorse
leads to the farmhouse called Le Port, and on the way is
a fine view of the Peganne, Port de Moulin, and the bend
of the coast towards the Point de Nez. This is the short-
est route to Le Port, but it is a scramble, otherwise we must
return to Beauregard, and keeping the public road, we shall
arrive at La Voroque, a hamlet on the Coupee road, where,
amongst the cottages, will be found a blacksmith’s and
also a general shop. There is another at the post-office,
and a third at the Carrefour, on the road to the Baye de la
Ville, We keep on the Coupee road northward till'we
reach the Cemetery, which is hardly divided from the fields,
and is covered with high grass and weeds. Here we leave the
main road for a lane on the left, shaded with the dwarf
trees, and running between high banks, covered in spring
with wild flowers. The farmhouses of Le Port are now
in sight, overlooking a very pretty valley, down which
flows a stream of water to the sea.
% 2


The Port de la Jument, one of the most rugged bays in
Serb, lies under the valley, and the descent into it is easy,
though not readily discovered. At one of the extremities
of this bay is La Moie de Mouton, one of the curiosities of
the island. It is a rock, capped with herbage, sloping with
a hump out to sea, and one hundred and fifty feet in height.
Between it and the mainland there runs up a shingly beach,
which is hindered from entirely isolating the rock by a
narrow belt of soft earth, which, like a small coupee, joins
it to the land. This connexion is, however, broken off
many feet from the summit of the cliff, leaving a deep
ehasm. Thus the Moie de Moulon is inaccessible, though
a few sheep graze there, having been landed from the boats.
They are shot down as they are wanted, and their bodies
recovered from the ledges whereon they may have rested.
At the base of this singularly-formed rock there is a fine
cave, with a very regular outline, somewhat triangular in
shape, the base of the triangle forming the roof. Veins of
feltspar are seen within it, the glitter of which forms a
pleasing contrast to the blackness of the interior passages.
It can only be entered by boat, and but to a small depth.
It was on this rock that, one dark night, a man was landed
by mistake. As he walked carelessly homewards, he was
stopped on the brink of the impassable hollow,and on the
Moie de Moulon he passed the night, hardly daring to
move, with the winds whistling, and the waves roaring
about him. It is well to be able to add that, early the
next day, he was seen in his perilous position, and rescued
from it by some Serk fishermen. A stream of water runs
down the steep coupee, and is wearing deep hollows in its


slope. Before leaving this part of the hay, a cleft in the
rock may be noticed, for the sake of the dark purple lichen
covering the walls.
A scramble over the slippery boulders ends in an inlet
with steep hanks, beautifully clothed with brambles, and
trailing ivy. On one side is a curious, smooth, upright
wall, about twelve feet long, having towards the sea a
square turret. In the north cliff is a cave, and near its
opening a large and beautiful rock pool, with numerous
varieties of sea-weeds. Between the northern and southern
bays, in the midst of the boulders, is a little grotto, with
a sturdy pillar, supporting two arches, coloured with
oxides of iron, and marked with spiral grooves on the sur-
face of the stone. Inside the hollow is a rougher pillar
amongst the shadows. The rude outlines of the rocks
meeting the bold coast northwards, together with their
varied colourings, form the most remarkable characteristics
of these two bays.
Once more on the summit of the cliff, we may pass round
into the valley of the Port de Moulin, or reach a farm
known as La Moinerie, by a path further up the hill. In
either case the walk will discover new objects of interest.
We have now left unvisited only the coast between Dixcart
and the Havre Gosselin. Starting from Dixcart hay we
shall obtain, as we near the Coupee, a good side view of
that pinnacled parapet; and, between these points, there
is a large cave, accessible from the land. The remaining
strip, as far as the Havre Gosselin, is best seen from the
sea. The chief feature is a chasm with a parapet, from
which we look down on the chafing sea, and clouds of light


yellow foam. These coupees, or narrow necks of land,
are numerous in every part of the coast of Serk.
The Port es Sees, which has been already mentioned, is
the only indent of any size in these cliffs. It is well worth
a special visit. The singularly-steep descent is somewhat
dangerous, owing to the yielding character of the orange-
coloured, porcelain-veined rock. This vein, with its
bright oxides of iron, is well seen from the bay. A broad
belt of firm sand is left dry at low water, and, both to the
north and south there are caves and reefs thrown together
in the wildest disorder. The scene is one of the most pic-
turesque confusion and variety. Immediately to the south
is a long cavern, from whose mouth flows a running stream,
which is at once swallowed by the sand. At the further
end will be found a waterfall, which the eye can just trace
up some fifty feet in the gloom. A stream on the top of
the cliff should have flowed on to the brink of the preci-
pice, but finding in its way over the granite a soft vein of
clay, it has passed directly through the earth, forming for
itself a well. After piercing in silence for some depth, the
stream suddenly opened on the roof of the sea-cave, into
which it falls, with an echoing splash, through the dark-
ness.
At spring tides some interesting hollows to the north
which lie hidden here and there among the black reefs, should
be visited. Pools, rich in brilliant sea-weed, where the
waters sparkle as the tiny gobies dart into their corners,
meet us at every step. No artist has ever equalled the
deep rich colouring of the granite cave walls. Standing
beneath the roof, we may revel in the rarest unions of light


and shade, and from one vestibule of these sea-palaces the
eye wanders through the light to another, till it is met by a
diamond point in the distance. On the north are caverns,
parted by rock buttresses running out some distance from
the cliff. They might well form the entrances of some sculp-
tured rock tombs, or subterranean temple. Of these, two
are nearly filled with monoliths, like, in shape and size, to
the huge sarcophagi of old, waiting to be borne into their
dark resting-place within the rock. From the Coupee
cliff there is a fine view of the green valley of the Port es
Sees, with its abrupt terminations, banked by the naked
headland of the Moie des Orgeries, and the rocks of the
Havre Gosselin, as the coast trends towards the north.




CHAPTER VI.
Satgia — St. Sampson — St. Magloire — Earthquakes—Danish
Raid — Normans — Eustache Le Moinc — The Bruce Said—
The French Raid — Serk Uninhabited — Hilary De Carteret
Civil Wars — Charles De Carteret — Sales of Serk.
Serk —of old, Sargia and, later. Sere, and Sercq,
has a history well suited to her wild and rugged character.
The wide grasp of the Eoman, and rude Visigoth, reached
even here, borne witness to in our day by the discovery of
coins of the later empire. Cromlechs yet existing within
the memory of man, stone weapons and tools, and at least
one Celtic name, that of the Tintageux rock, prove that
this island was well known before and subsequent to the
Roman invasion.
It is not, however, till the year 557, that Serk is named
in history, when Childebert, the French king, granted
Sargia, with other islands, to Sampson, then Bishop of
Dol, in Brittany. This apostle was by birth a Welshman,
and, before his expulsion by the Danes, Bishop of St.
David’s, in Pembrokeshire. He was succeeded in his


■Work and office by St. Maglorius, his fellow-countryman;
and, indeed, it is thought by many, that the Channel
Islands were then peopled for the most part by Britons,
forced by the Danes to leave their country. It is at least
certain, that, in the year 787, the chronicle of Fontenelles
mentions the islanders as “ gens Britonumlt is curious
that in these days Guernsey was, in name at least, a
dependent of Serk, being known as Yiss Sargia, both in
King Childebert’s deed of gift, and later, in the Latin
Acts.
But whatever her old renown, the islet, in the sixth
century, entered on a noble career, becoming the centre
of the missionary work, which St. Maglorius appears to
have carried on with the utmost energy. About 565, by
permission of one Nivo, a nobleman, then lord both of
Guernsey and Serk, the bishop crossed over to this island
with sixty-two priests, and established a missionary home,
which would seem to have secured, for eight hundred
years, the prosperity of Serk. In the year 709 the
Channel Islands were visited by a fearful earthquake, in
which the sea is said to have greatly encroached on the
ancient landmarks, and altogether engulphed some dis-
tricts. Similar disturbances occurred in 811 and 842.
But about 856 a yet more terrible enemy, the dreaded
Northmen, began their ravages. Hasting, a Danish
chieftain, is said, by a Jersey poet chronicler of the twelfth
century, to have made a foray, with fire and sword, —
En Aurenem, en Guemesi,
En Sairc, en Erin, en Gersi.
And there is yet a local tradition, telling the stratagem by


which he effected the conquest of this island. Men are
said to have landed as traders, with boxes full of merchan-
dize, and having made this known, they asked all the
natives to meet them in the church, to examine their goods.
The simple folk, astonished and delighted, hastened to the
trysting-place: all, save one old woman, who could not
at the moment leave her bread baking in the oven. When
at last she hurried to the church, she heard the shrieks
and groans of the dying, and thus alone of the islanders
escaped the fury of the pirates.
In the tenth century Serk fell, as one of the Channel
Islands, to William Longsword, the Norman, by gift from
Raoul, the French king, and thereby formed part of the
duchy that subsequently conquered England. It was at
the same time transferred from the see of Dol to that of
Coutances, in Normandy. In the twelfth century we
find Serk mentioned in the ‘Cartulaire’ of the abbey
of Montebourg, when one William de Vernon gave the
chapel of St. Maglorius, the land which he had occu-
pied, and a water-mill, to the monks of that abbey.
In 1214 this island was attacked by a Flemish adventurer
of great fame, Eustache le Moine. He had been in the
service of King John, but on leaving it had attempted
these islands. The enterprize failed, and his uncle, bro-
ther, and fifty-four of his men, were taken prisoners in
Serk, where the monks had probably gathered numerous
followers, else this leader would hardly have detached so
large a force for the service. The following abstract shows
that, in consequence of this event, the island was trans-
ferred to a new warden:


“ 16 John. —Gillingham, Dec. 8, 1214.
“ King orders P. Bishop of Winchester, to deliver the
island of Serk to Philip d’Aubigney, to whom the
king has committed its custody.”
This Philip d’Aubigney was then governor of Guernsey.
The continued prosperity of the island is borne out by
the fact, that in the reign of Edward the First, Serk paid
to the King yearly one hundred livres toumois, about
£6, Is. B d, of our money, equal to about .£2OO of the pre-
sent day; whereas, Alderney, the larger island, paid but
£5. It would seem, from the same rent-roll, that there
were then in Serk about fifty houses, and two hundred
and fifty people.
But times of trouble were at hand. In the fourteenth
century a great and terrible disaster ruined the island.
While Edward the Third was at war both with France
and Scotland, David Bruce, the exiled king, attacked
these islands with a large fleet, in 1336, and would seem
specially to have depopulated Serk; for, in the next year,
we find Edward writing thus, while commanding the levy
of a militia. “ For we understand that certain Scots
lately invaded Serk, with other parts of these islands, and
were there inhumanly guilty of murder, burning, and other
wickedness, and intend there, for the second time, to inflict
like evils.” It is possible the island might yet have reco-
vered this blow, but in the very next year, 1337-38, Serk
was again ravaged by the French. It was at this time,
perhaps, that the king allowed a certain yearly sum “ to
the convent of St. Maglorius, in the island of Serk.” This
second pillage seems, however, to have thoroughly discou


raged the monks, who, in 1349, finally left the island,
after a residence of eight hundred years.
During this period Serk formed one parish with Herm.
The islands, though separated from Normandy, yet conti-
nued under the see of Coutances till 1568, when they
were transferred to thee see of Winchester. The remain-
ing islanders now became pirates and wreckers, the nui-
sance of the Channel, till Serk was depopulated by the
enraged inhabitants of the Cinque Port of Rye, about the
year 1352, Thus, in crime and disaster, closed the first
act of this outworld history, and for two hundred years
Serk was desolate, serving as a common for breeding cattle
to the men of Guernsey. When once more re-settled,
there was found but one poor hermitage, with an adjoining
chapel.
It was not till the reign of Edward the Sixth that a
body of French soldiers landed, threw up two forts at
L’Eperquerie and Little Serk, and became the tenor of
the islands, till driven out by a stratagem of some bold
Flemings. Anchoring off the island, they asked permission
to bury a comrade, and after some demur the request was
granted, on condition that the bearers and mourners should
land without weapons. This was agreed to, and on the
appointed day a boat left the ship’s side, bearing men, and
a coffin filled with arms. We may well imagine the diffi-
culty and anxiety felt in bearing up the heavy load over
the rude rocks, perchance of the Havre Gosselin. Had a
footstep failed, or had a Frenchman lent a helping hand,
all had been lost. At length, in the interior of the island, the
funeral rank was formed, the Flemings, as chief mourners,


in advance, the French behind. When near the church
the mourners quickened their step, and were inside before
the French had reached the door, which they found locked
on their arrival. In a few minutes they had forced an
entrance, only to he met by a deadly fire, before which,
lightly armed, they fled. Meanwhile, the island crew,
which had left for the ship to receive the promised reward,
had been disarmed, and a second body of Flemings coming
to the aid of the forlorn hope, soon completed the conquest
of the island. Sir Walter Ealeigh has some reason for
calling the leader of this expedition a “ bold and ingenious
gentleman.” The Fleming presented Serk to Queen
Mary, but, in disgust at her neglect, he quitted the island,
which for a few years was once again without inhabitants.
Queen Elizabeth, however, had now begun her reign, and
throughout England energy, and the love of travel and
adventure, was awakened. Moreover, it had become very
necessary that Serk should at once be safely colonized ; for
after the expulsion of the French, the Sieur de Glatney, a
Norman gentleman, had obtained a grant of the island from
the king, and the colonists only left on the outbreak of the
war. Accordingly, in 1565, Hilary de Carteret, Seig-
neur of St. Ouen, in Jersey, obtained a grant of the island,
in perpetuity, from the Queen, at a yearly rent of fifty
sols toumois, on the condition that Serk should always be
occupied by forty able-bodied men, and from this time the
islet again prospered. Sir Hilary de Carteret, immedi-
ately on receiving the grant, came over himself to Serk,
accompanied by his wife. They slept for a short time in
a stone vaulted chapel till a rude house was built, which is


now the parsonage. Although all things needful for the
cultivation of the island had to be imported from Jersey,
at great expense, his followers, encouraged by the example
of their lord, soon cleared the ground, which was divided
into forty farms. Queen Elizabeth gave to the Seigneur,
in acknowledgment of his suecess, six new pieces of artillery,
well mounted and supplied, for the defence of the island.
In 1579 we find his son, Philip de Carteret, residing as
Seigneur in his father’s place, and under him Bailiff and
Jurats were appointed, and all laws fashioned like those of
Jersey, to which island there was an appeal in case of
need. As Serk is in the bailiwick of Guernsey, that
island was angered at this preference shewn by her depen-
dency for the laws of her rival, and determined to compel
the Serkese to come under her jurisdiction. An extract
from a quaint petition, sent in 1582 to Sir Philip de Carte-
ret, will shew the nature of the contest.
“ Now, right honourable Lord, we therefore, trusting
upon such hope of good and convenient remedies, we will
show unto you the very truth of the premisses, even so as
the,same to us here did happen, whereby you shall under-
stand, first, that, four or five days before the thirtieth day
of May, arrest was made in Guernsey of all the ships and
boats, and chiefly of those of Jersey, that were suspected
that would sooner bring some new things hither, until the
said day, when did arrive here in the morning the Mr.
Captain of Guernsey, the Bailiff, and four of the Jurats,
with the Procureur, the Clerk, the Prevot, and the Comp-
troller, being accompanied with above forty harquebusiers
at the least, of the said isle, who, at their arrival, were


met by Mr. Messervy, .... being accompanied with a good
number of harquebusiers of this isle, who, perceiving the
said Captain, they did let him come aland, and they did
greet him with some shots of harquebuses, which each did
loose.”
Whether this greeting was a salute, or protest, does not
appear; but the Captain; one Sir Thomas Leighton, an
overbearing man, having mustered the islanders, allowing
some and not reckoning the absent, declared he could not
find the forty men required by the Queen’s patent, and
that therefore the island was forfeited. The Bailiff of Serk,
one Edward de Carteret, was then imprisoned in Guernsey,
and the plea of default of homage was advanced, as another
reason for the forfeiture of the isle to the Captain.
In consequence of these disturbances, commissioners
were sent from England, in 1583, to settle the jurisdiction
of the island. The laws were assimilated to those of
Guernsey, homage was declared to be not due to that
island, and the dispute respecting the muster was compro-
mised. The following extract from a letter written by
Lord Carew, Governor of Guernsey, shews that the mineral
lodes had already attracted attention: —
* “ The lead ore of Serk holds only lead; but in small
assayes so uncertainly, as no judgment certain can be made
of it: wherefore I have written to John de Quetteville to
send me a hogshead of the same ore ; and I pray you to
speak to your nephew, to permit him to dig for it, unto
whom, and to yourself, recommend my best affections.”
The nephew named in the letter was a second Sir Philip
de Carteret, born in Serk, in 1583, afterwards Bailiff of


Jersey, and wbo died in the reign of Charles the First,
during the siege of Elizabeth Castle, which he held for the
king, while his wife defended Mont Orgueil. We Ifearn
incidentally from the above and other circumstances, that
Serk was a favourite residence of this ancient family. In
1629, Dr, Heylin, who accompanied, as chaplain, an expe-
dition sent to strengthen the Channel Islands, thus writes
of Serk;
“ In strength it is most beholding to nature, who hath
walled it in a manner round with mighty rocks, there being
but one way of ascent into it — and that with small forces
easy to be defended against the strongest power in Christen-
doms — a passage, lately fortified by the farmers here,
with a new platforme on the top of it, and thereupon some
four pieces of ordinance continually mounted. In this
island there is a Bailiff and a Minister, but both of them
subordinate, in matters of appeal, unto the courts and col-
loquies of Guernsey.”
The evil days of the civil wars had now come, and this
little spot bore a part in tbe contest. While Jersey
remained firm in her allegiance to Charles, Guernsey sided
with tbe Parliament, and as Serk was under the jurisdic-
tion of that island, though at tbe same time the Lordship
of a Jersey Cavalier, its possession was hotly contested. In
a petition to Cromwell from the men of Guernsey, they
state, “ that they were at their own charges for reducing
and keeping Serk.” They add, “ The island of Serk has
been twice lost: the Guernsey men recovered it, and during
the Civil Wars have, for a long time, kept a garrison there
at their own expense. ” The island must have been captured


very early in the struggle, for one La Place, governor of
Serk, is excluded from a general pardon, published in 1643,
and in 1644 the Seigneur, with his cousin and brother-in-
law, the famous Sir George de Carteret, governor of Jer-
sey, attempted to recover his rights. Four shallops left
Jersey at night, holding one hundred and four men, and
commanded by two captains, Lane and Chamberlain. In
the darkness they parted company, and while Lane, after
making the coast of Serk, and putting the guard to flight,
stood off and returned to Jersey, Captain Chamberlain with
but thirty men, landed, disarmed the guard and captain,
and took most of the Serkese prisoners. In the morning,
as he received no support, the women managed to light a
beacon, whereupon Guernsey sent an armed force, and took
Chamberlain and his men prisoners of war.
In 1651, when Jersey surrendered, it was agreed, “ that
it shall be left to the Parliament’s good pleasure to allow
the Seigneur of Saint Ouen to compound for the island of
Serk,” and, in 1659, Captain Waterhouse, Lieutenant-
Governor of Guernsey, bids “ his respected friend, Mr.
John Le Gros, Judge of Sarke Isle, take care of the
militia, and keep the said isle for his highness, the Lord
Protector of England.” This same Captain Waterhouse,
three months after the Eestoration, in 1660, writes thus
to a friend; “ Seeing a frigate lying under Serk in a storm,
the next morning I sent Somer in his shallop to see what
they were ; it proved to be the Governor of Jersey with
Sir Philip. I have done him right as unto his possession
of Serk, where his brother now is.”
Thus the De Carterets had their own again ; and more-
F


over, the King conferred some new benefits upon them.
It was granted to Sir Philip that his seal, in Serk, should
be valid equally with those of Jersey and Guernsey, and
he received power to raise funds for a pier at L’Eperquerie,
while the jurisdiction overthrown during the civil wars,
was remodelled to the advantage of the Seigneur. But
the long reign of the De Carterets was now nearly at an
end. In 1693, Sir Philip De Carteret, great grandson of
Sir Hilary, obtained a license of sale, which, however,
was not used : but, in 1713, a new power was granted by
Queen Anne to his son, Sir Charles, who died childless
and in debt, the last of the Seigneurs of Saint Ouen and
Serk. The tenure of Serk by this family was but a late
incident in their career, for Sir Charles was the sixty-
second Lord of Saint Ouen, and to the very last they held
high office, and were men of renown.
In 1721, the island passed by sale into the hands of
James Milner, from whom it came, in 1730, (through
Wilcocks, Bishop of Gloucester, who, however, was Seig-
neur only for a day,) into the possession of Susannah Le
Pelley, alias Le Gros. Serk remained with the Le Pelleys
till 1852, when the Seigneurie was transferred to Mrs. J.
G. Ceilings, of Guernsey. It is now held by her son, the
Eev. W. T. Pollings, M. A.




CHAPTER VII.
Government in 1583—Altered 1661—Chefs Plaids—Primoge-
niture—Seignorial Eights—La Ketraite —Clameur d’Haro—
Farming—Language—Character—Dress—Food—La Longue
Veille—Schools—Superstitions—Climate.
Of the laws and customs of the people of Serk previous
to 1565 we know little or nothing; nor was it till 1583
that the jurisdiction of the island was finally settled. The
manner of government is noteworthy as the only feudal
system in Great Britain not effete. The Seigneur; a general
assembly, known as the Chefs Plaids ; and a court of jus-
tice, were the chief authorities. The members of the
court were appointed by the Seigneur, in Chefs Plaids.
This little Parliament could also frame bye-laws relating
to the island. The court of justice could imprison, and
impose a fine not exceeding sixty sols and one denier, hut
it had no authority in criminal matters; while contracts
signed by it had to be authenticated by the seal of the
Bailiff of Guernsey. It met three times a year, and could
frame police regulations, subject, however, to the consent
of the Chefs- Plaids. The members, five in number, were
called Jurats, of whom the eldest was Judge: and there
were four officers, the Prevot, the Registrar, the Conneta-
f 2


Me, and Yingtonier, The Prevot acted as Advocate, She-
riff, Sergeant, and Receiver of Fees; the Connetable and
Yingtonier, as Police Officers and Collectors of Taxes.
These latter held office for a year, the Yingtonier
of one year becoming the Connetable of the year following.
This jurisdiction continued till the civil war, when the
island was held by Guernsey for the Parliament, when all
rights of the Seigneur were overthrown. The extent of
his influence in the Chefs Plaids is not recorded, but it
probably included the right of refusing his sanction to the
local acts, without which they did not become law.
After the Restoration the jurisdiction was somewhat
altered, and the power of the Seigneur increased. Sir
Philip de Carteret was then a gentleman of the bedcham-
ber, and his influence at court doubtless stood him in good
stead. He obtained, in 1661, the right of legalizing
contracts, which had formerly belonged to Guernsey, and
his seal was accounted of equal authority with those in
Guernsey and Jersey : and, in 1675, he received from the
King an equally important boon. The jurats and inhabi-
tants of Serk had become stanch noncomformists, and
would not take the oaths of office; whereupon Sir Philip
received the right of appointing a Seneschal, who in his
own person became the court, and to this day he has com-
plete jurisdiction in petty offences. This officer can impri-
son for three days, and fine to the amount of three sols
tournois. The appointment of the Prevot for life was also
given to the Seigneur, as well as that of the Registrar, or
Greffier. As regards the court, it should be mentioned,
that there is appeal to the court of Guernsey in all ques


tions of inheritance, and in other matters, where the value
exceeds ten sols toumois.
The Chefs Plaids, with its powers of law-making,
remains unaltered. It is convoked by the Seigneur, and
consists of the Seneschal, Prevot, Greffier, and the tenants
of the forty farms into which Sir Hilary De Carteret
divided the island. It may have been at one time a purer
republic, since in the older documents the Chefs Plaids is
spoken of as “ the Seigneur and the inhabitants of Serk.”
The Seneschal presides, but the Seigneur must be present
himself, or by deputy. He has no vote, hut when any
ordonnance is passed, he can refuse his assent, without
which it cannot be registered and become law. The majo-
rity may appeal to Guernsey, whose claim, however, to
insist on the registration is denied: but they can annul
such ordonnances as are contrary to a known superior law.
As two or three farms may have passed into the hands of
one tenant, and as there is a vote for each farm, there is,
some danger of two or three of the largest owners overruling
the rest. Moreover, the Seigneur himself holds two or
three farms, and, as tenant, has a right to vote. The pre-
sent Seigneur wisely abstains from the exercise of his right,
and it has happened, that his nominees, who are left unbi-
assed, have sometimes caused the rejection of some plan
for the improvement of the island.
None of the officers are paid other than by the fees of
court, and their amount may be gathered by the following
anecdote. A few years since, the Bailiff and Jurats of
Guernsey, during an official visit, were met by the Serk
Prevot, who complained bitterly that he had to attend the


court in all seasons, to furnish the prison, and even to keep
the prisoners at his own cost, and that yet he received no
payment for these services. The authorities naturally
sympathized with the grievance, and asked of the Prevot
how many persons had been imprisoned that year. *• Well,”
was the answer, “ none this year,” “ How many last
year, then ? ” “ One.” “ And the year before ? ”
“ Well, I can’t tell, for I have not been Prevot long.”
Again, it is related of a woman, sentenced to the prison
for twenty-four hours, that she desired the constables to
leave the doors open, as she disliked to be closed up at
night, and the constables very considerately acceded to her
request.
The laws of property are also singular. Wheu the
island was colonized, the land was divided into forty tene-
ments, and the first owners desired to divide them equally
amongst their children, as is the custom in the other islands,
but by the 9th of James Ist, the lands were made incapable
of partition. They descend to the eldest son, or if there
be no sons, to the eldest daughter: but if the owner die
without issue, and his next brother be also dead, having
left children, the property does not fell to them, but to their
uncle, the eldest surviving brother. The widow receives
a third of all, and usually stays in the farmhouse, haying
her third room. Thus the forty farms have remained to
this day; though the original purpose of always thereby
having forty male residents has been defeated, as two or
more farms have by purchase gathered under one owner.
In these cases the Seigneur obliges the farmer to keep in
good repair a house for each farm. Besides the forty,


twelve other holdings have at various times been leased out
by former Seigneurs, but the tenants have no voice in the
Chefs Plaids.
Farms can be sold but not mortgaged. In connection
with the transfer of property, there is a curious custom,
known as La Retraite, by which any relative of the outgoer
may, within a fixed time, oust the purchaser, by paying
back to him the purchase-money. In order to effect this,
he must make known his intention in Court within six
weeks after the sale. After two or three weeks, however,
the purchaser can pass the retreat; that is, he can get a
relative of the seller to go to court, and enter his name as
a re-claimant, who by agreement fails to appear on the
appointed day, in which case the other relatives lose their
power, and the property belongs absolutely to the purcha-
ser. If the purchaser neglect to pass the retreat before the
six weeks are ended, he has no power afterwards to do so
till after a year and a day, within -which time any relative
may reclaim.
We now proceed to give a summary of the Seignorial
rights. By the original patent of Elizabeth, she gave to
Sir Hilary de Carteret “ all that our island of Serk, with
all its rights, members, liberties, and appurtenances,”
including the advowson. all' manner of tythes, wracks of
sea, shipwreck, wards, marriages, and rights of tolls. He
is now paid, on the transfer by sale of any land, one thir-
teenth of the purchase- money, and receives also one-tenth
of all grain, peas, beans, apples, sheep, and wool: as well
as ground-rents, and dues of fowls, &c., paid in kind. No
house can be built, nor any liquor sold, without his sane


tlon, though the innkeeper is chosen by the Chefs Plaids.
Moreover, all strangers are, at the end of six weeks, subject
to expulsion at Lis pleasure, unless they Lave obtained his
permission to reside. We have already seen that he
appoints the Judge, legalizes documents, and has a veto on
the deliberations of the Chefs Plaids. He has also the
command of the militia, which received the title of “ Royal ”
from William the Fourth, and includes all males between
sixteen and sixty, numbering about eighty effectives.
Thes men have lately been armed with the Enfield rifle,
and the Government is said to have spent ,£15,000 on the
new weapon in Guernsey, Alderney, and Serk.
There are among the Ordonnances, or Acts, of the Chefs
Plaids, some curious pieces worthy of notice. Thus, no
house may harbour more than one dog, on pain of fine ; and
all the fair sex in that community are to be banished or
killed. There is, also, in 1742, an instance of the Clameur
d’Haro. The origin of this custom is uncertain, though it
doubtless descends from the early Normans ; but the effect
of it is still all powerful in these islands : for by the cry of
“ Haßo, a mon aide, mon Prince,” the offending party is
bound to stay all proceedings till the question is settled at
law. In this case, a Serk sieur, or farmer, stopped by the
Clameur, two workmen diggiqg in his grounds for stone,
under the orders of the Seigneur, and subsequently gained
his cause. In another instance, the Seigneur having dis-
missed the clergyman, who at that time was only his chap-
lain, the latter, for some time, by the Clameur d’Haro,
hindered his successor from entering on his duties.
The farms are of necessity small, the largest not exceed


ing fifty vergees, and of these two and a half make an
English acre. A visitor to Serk in 1673 writes
earth or soil is for the most part hot and sandy, yet fruitful
enough to afford all necessaries to its inhabitants, excellent
for bearing all kinds of roots, as parsnips, carrots, turnips,
&e.; and is very well stored with fruit trees, for the most
planted of late, furnishing us with cider. Fern we have
of most sorts, but not in any extraordinary quantity : our
pasture is but short, yet exceeding sweet, and therefore we
have rare mutton, but no great quantity of beef, and cows
enough to supply us with milk and butter; for our cheese
we generally have from England. Our firing is for the
most part furze, for we have but little wood, and no timber
at all growing throughout the whole island, so that we are
forced either to make shift with old apple-trees, or furnish
ourselves as well as we can with deal.”
Two hundred years have brought few changes to Serk.
We now get all our beef from Guernsey, save that at
Christmas $ few bullocks are killed; but in compensation
we have some picturesque groups of trees scattered over
the island. The customs of tethering the cattle; parting
the land into long narrow slips; and the deep ploughing for
parsnips, called La Grande Charrue; have been already
noticed. There is much waste land, which might readily
be brought under cultivation, and the farms would present
a slovenly appearance to an English farmer. The hedges
are wide banks of earth; the land is little weeded; the
ploughs and waggons are heavy and rude; and a very
simple sledge is in common use for the carriage of light
weights. The manure used is chiefly vraic, or sea-weed,


which is gathered from February to August, and is also
used for fuel. Serk has now but little trade, the chief
exports being grain and a few fatted oxen; while the
imports are mostly flour and groceries.
The Serkese have two sides to their character. While
their enemies rail at them as niggardly, grasping, preju-
diced, and superstitious, their friends would, with more
truth, yaunt their honesty, love of home, independence,
and simplicity. They are probably little changed from
their ancestors, the first colonists. Their language is a
French patois, sprinkled with a few English words. The
islanders are proud of their lineage, and all the farmers
are called ‘ Sieurs.’ They often intermarry, and twenty
years ago there were but twenty-one names amongst seven
hundred people. Every farmer is also to some extent a
fisherman, and for the most part the blue shirt or frock is
worn. A stranger will be struck with the prevailing sober-
ness of dress. Black is the favourite colour with the
elderly women, whilst the maidens are content with browns
and greys. These sober tints form a most pleasant contrast
to the gaudy colours worn by the overdressed women of
the Guernsey capital. The island was not less primitive
than now when, in 1673, the writer of the following letter
found something to laugh at. “ Each man religiously pre-
serves his best blue trunk breeches, and a coat, almost like
a I>utch fro’s vest, or one of your watermen’s liveries. Nor
are the women behindhand with them in their hospital
gowns of the same colour, wooden sabots, white stockings,
and red petticoats, so mean they are scarce worth taking
up. Both sexes on, festivals wear large ruffs, and the


women, instead of hats and hoods, truss up their hair, the
more genteel sorts in a kind of cabbage net; those of
meaner fortunes in a piece of linen, perhaps an old dish-
clout turned out of service, or the fag-end of a table-cloth
that has escaped the persecution of washing ever since the
Reformation.”
The Serkese are frugal in their household management.
But little meat is eaten; and the chief food consists of fish,
potage, and bacon, with cider or hollands. No manufac-
ture is now carried on save a little knitting, which has
almost ceased. In the days of James the Second, two
hundred tods of wool were imported, and the writer of the
letter above quoted gossips thus to his friend: —“ The grand
and almost only manufacture of our island is knitting,
which our people perform with a wonderful dexterity, both
for stockings, gloves, caps, and waistcoats; men, women,
and children being brought up to it, so that you may com-
monly see thirty or forty of them assembled together in a
barn. These commodities, when finished, we vend into
England, having several small vessels for that purpose, and
thence in return furnish ourselves with necessaries.” These
meetings are still sometimes held, and on the fern couches,
common to every house, sit men and women, young and
old, at work, listening to the traditions and tales of some
aged Nestor, or wrinkled Hecuba, There is, on the eve
of Christmas eve, a special gathering of this nature, called
La Longue Veille.
It is to be regretted that no new household manufacture
has been established; as, owing to the law of primogeniture,
some are without regular employment, who yet will not


leave the island; whence listlessness, and a lack of
energy are at present general characteristics. The poorer
class have a good name as sailors and domestic servants.
Perhaps the gravest prevailing vice is drunkenness, owing
doubtless, in a great measure, to the cheapness of all sorts
of spirits.
Pish are abundant, and of many kinds, the long nose and
conger being amongst the most common and the best. The
conger is like an immense eel, long, round, and unsightly,
and sometimes very thick and weighty. Before the New-
foundland fishery, the export of salted conger from these
islands was considerable, and regulated by numerous laws.
The fishing and the tax upon it was known as L’Esperquerie
de Congres, and from it our present harbourage L’Eper-
querie has its name. Lobsters are caught in large quan-
tities, and we have also a delicious shell-fish, known as the
ormer, or oreille de mer. It is found at very low tides,
adhering to the bottom of rocks, and is somewhat larger
than an oyster. Of old, ducks, mallard, teal, and other
wild fowl, were plentiful; but now, a few stray snipes or
woodcopks are the only game. Gulls, cormorants, and
other sea-birds, are found. Babbits are still numerous ;
hut in the fourteenth century, five hundred conies were
part of the revenue paid to the king; and even two hun-
dred years ago, some of the Serkese made twenty pounds
a year by the sale of the skins. Breehou was then little
letter than a large rabbit warren.
Many of the French Protestants fled to these islands at
the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and the Calvinist
discipline existed in Guernsey till the end of the seventeenth,


century. Serk was the last of the islands that retained it.
We find, in 1673, a Huguenot minister in this island, who
had “ lately began to teach grammar to the children, with
writing and arithmetic, erecting a school for that purpose.”
Indeed, until a very recent period, the Guernsey livings
were for the moat part filled by French or Swiss Protes-
tants ; and the present Incumbent of Serk, the Key. J. L.
V. Cachemaille, is a native of Switzerland. We have now
two schools, which owe their existence to the late Seigneur,
Peter le Pelley. The schoolmaster is paid £3O out of the
impot, being the drawback on imported spirits, which is
levied in Guernsey, and given back yearly to the island.
The islanders are somewhat credulous and superstitious,
and every day has its own rumour. Thus, a short time
since, an unlucky antiquarian found one day, in Little
Serk, an old key and some pieces of iron. The stranger
and his treasure became a night’s wonder, and the next
morning brought the owner of the property with a demand
of £25 as compensation. A clever, cruel, and vicious man,
during the late war, became from this cause the terror of the
Serkese, nor, though dead, is he yet forgotten. The old
people, in the long evenings, on the fern couches, love to
tell how he deceived and brought home a young French
lady as his bride, and how basket after basket was sent to
the beach to carry up the silver pieces she had brought for
her dowry, and how he ill-treated her till she died. Then
his long journeys, his escape from Castle Cornet, his un-
canny deeds, and especially a cork boat, which he is said
to have built and used in all weathers, have caused him to
be regarded with a universal dread, which has hardly yet


passed away. Such devices, also, as throwing money to
the witch at the bottom of the churn, when the butter will
not come, and the like, are not uncommon. They have,
also, a curious idea that they are subject to a disease, called
in these islands the 1 Cotes Bas,’ being a fall of the lower
ribs in such wise, that it requires a good kneading from
some old dame to lift them to their right place again.
Serk is one of the healthiest spots in Great Britain.
The temperature is very equal, the air bracing and yet
warm. Invalids from the sister islands sometimes come
hither, and if better known, many might cross over from
England and pass a winter with great benefit to their
health. There is a resident doctor. Ice is but rarely
seen, and in the sheltered spots the winter slips by almost
unnoticed. January is the coldest month. During the
severe winter of 1860, one thermometer, out of doors, but
sheltered from the wind, went down to thirty degrees : and
another, on one occasion, showed twenty-three degrees.
Serk has usually escaped during the prevalence of epide-
mics ; but there were recently some fatal cases of diptheria.
The chief ailments are diseases of the teeth and gums, and
also a troublesome boil, caused most probably by insufficient
nourishment. A death from natural causes in middle age
very rarely occurs.
Thus we have lightly sketched the natural beauties, the
history, laws, manners, and customs of this picturesque
islet, so little known, and yet so full of interest. Our
work is done; but we will promise to the stranger, who
shall adventure himself amongst us, a pleasant sojourn and
ready welcome. Vale.


APPENDIX.
On the 19th of February, 1861, the Rival, the last of
the Serk cutters, was wrecked. She had crossed from
Guernsey in a 'gale, and reached the Creux harbour, out-
side of which lie her moorings. These were missed, and
the cutter was at once thrown on the rocks, and washed
away. The crew and passengers were saved, owing chiefly,
under God, to the energy and courage of Philippe Le
Feuvre, a young Serkese of La Ville. He, while others on
the harbour shore hung back, offered to go alone to the
rock on which they had taken refuge. Joined by three on-
lookers, they together brought off four men and two women,
who for six hours had hardly kept their foothold against
the waves. Captain Carre, the master of the cutier, was
the last to leave her, nor did he quit the rock until his
companions were in safety. Had the harbour been a safe
one, the cutter would have been moored inside the break-
water, and wonld not have been lost. It is to be hoped,
that steps will be soon taken either to improve the Creux,
or, as would seem far better, to begin at once in earnest a

a bronze medal with two sovereigns to P. Le Feuvre, and
two sovereigns to each of his comrades.
