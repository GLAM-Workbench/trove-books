When Teddy saw the Animals he got a Big Surprise,
He gazed up at the Elephant with wide and wond?ring eyes;
He saw so much that pleased him as he wandered up and down;
Yes! He was Very Happy when the Circus Came To Town!

And when he saw the lion in the corner of its cage,
It gave him quite a nasty fright by getting in a Rage,
But Teddy liked the Ponies, some were white and some were brown;
He really DID enjoy them when the Circus Came To Town!
-t- -f- -f-
He thought the Seal so Clever as it balanced a large ball
That wobbled when he waddled, but it never seemed to fall;
He loved the little Fairy Queen who wore a Golden Crown,
Yes! Teddy WAS Delighted when the Circus Came To Town!

He had a great and joyful day he gazed at This and That,
He wandered with his bush-land friends, and little Pretty Pat;
YOU?LL know when you have read about the antics of the Clown,
Why Teddy was So Happy when the Circus Came to Town!

Troublesome Teddy was very
pleased with himself. He had worked hard all the morning
sweeping his house, which was in the hollow of a big gum-tree. He was
expecting a visit from his little friend, Pretty Pat. He always liked to
look nice when Pat came, and now he was busy washing his suit. As he
did so, he hummed a little song which he had made up:
?I rub and I scrub at my Little Red Tub,
As I wash out my Very Best Clothes,
They?ll hang on the line
If the Weather be fine
And dry if a Warm Wind blows.?
?That?s Very Good,? he said to
himself, ?I?ll write it down before I
forget it.?
He went inside and got a pencil
and note-book. Sitting on a stump he
began to Think. ?How does it go?? he
said. ?Oh, I remember.? He began to
write:
?I rub and I ??
He stopped and scratched his head:
?That?s Funny,? he said, ?I forget
how to spell the next Word. I?ll just
have to put in a ?, and fix it up
After.?

He went on writing, but soon came to Another Word he had forgotten
how to spell, so he put in Another ?. When he had finished, poor Teddy
found he had almost as many ?as words. And this is how it looked:
?If I don?t write it all down, I?ll forget it,? he said, ?and if I forget it I
won?t be able to Sing it. I?m afraid it?s another Big Problem. I must
certainly think this all out Most Carefully.? He was gazing thoughtfully
at all the and wondering if he could rub them out and put in the Right
Words in the Right Places. ?Oh dear,? he said.
Just then he heard thump! Thump! THUMP! and Hoppy the Hare came
bounding out of the bush all in a very Great Hurry.
?Hey, Teddy,? he called excit-
edly as he held out a paper; ?Look
at this!?
?I?m very BUSY,? said Teddy
crossly.
?What are you doing?? asked
Hoppy.
?Well, it?s like this,? explained
Teddy, ?I?m washing my best clothes
and I?m Making Up a Poem.?
?What with?? asked Hoppy.
?Soap for the Clothes, and
Words for the Poem,? replied
Teddy.
Hoppy looked puzzled. ?How
do you keep them from getting
Mixed Up?? he asked.


?It?s quite easy,? said Teddy, ?I
put the Soap in the Tub, and the
words in my Book.?
?I see,? said Hoppy. ?But what
are you going to do with the Poem
when it?s Made Up??
?Sing it,? replied Teddy.
Hoppy looked at the book, and
asked: ?But what are all the for??
? They?re GAPS, but I will fill
them all in Presently in fact, soon,?
said Teddy.
?But what if you don?t?? asked
Hoppy.
Teddy looked Very Serious.
?Well,? he said at last, ?every time I
come to a Gap I?ll have to stop Sing-
ing. Then there would be nearly as
many Stops as Singing, and that
would NEVER DO. People might
think I stuttered. Now please go away, Hoppy. You can see how Very
Busy I am.?
He picked up his pencil and had just started to try and fill in the Gaps
when Benny Bunny came scampering out of the Bush. He, too, had a piece
of paper. ?Teddy!? he cried, ?there?s a Real Circus come to Town!?
?A WHAT, Benny?? asked Teddy in excitement.
?A Circus,? said Hoppy the Hare, ?that?s what I?ve been trying to tell
you!?
?Well, why Didn?t you?? said Teddy crossly.
?You said you were Making up a Song so you could sing it Without
Gaps,? explained Hoppy, ?and you said you were Very Busy.?
Teddy told him that was all Very True, but if Hoppy had something
Really Important to say he should have Said It. ?Besides, Hoppy,? said
Teddy severely, ?I?ve got all next week to Fill in the Gaps.?
?I see,? said Hoppy. ?Now Benny, show Teddy the Paper.?
?Wait a minute,? said Benny, ?I?ll nail
it up, and we can see what it?s all about,?
After Benny had hammered his fingers,
he managed at last to get it Fixed Up. It
was all about the Circus, and had pictures
of clowns and elephants and Everything.

Eg
?Gracious,? said Teddy in surprise, ?do you think we could All go??
?If we had some monfey we could,? replied Benny, ?have You got any,
Teddy??
Teddy looked very thoughtful and pulled his pocket Right Inside Out.
?Is there anything there?? asked Benny anxiously.
?Yes,? said Teddy.
?What?? asked Benny and
Hoppy together.
?A HOLE,? said Teddy tear-
fully.
?Did you have something??
asked Benny.
?I Must Have,? replied Teddy,
?because whatever it was, it made a
HOLE.?
?Do you think it was Money??
asked Hoppy; ?perhaps we could
try and find it.?
Teddy thought Very Hard. ?I
know,? he said, ?I remember now.
NUTS! I was saving them up for
Squeaker the Squirrel. He loves
nuts.?
They sat on the ground looking
very unhappy. Hoppy looked at
Teddy and Teddy looked at Benny.
Then They All Looked at Each
Other.


?I know,? said Teddy at last.
?We?ll go and tell Pat all about Our
Troubles. ?I?ll put on my best Clothes
and lock up my house. You two go
on. I won?t be long.?
Hoppy bounded off with his long
legs. ?Long Legs are Very Useful,
Benny,? he said. Benny followed
with his little short ones.
In a few minutes Hoppy was out
of sight, and poor Benny was Out of
Breath.
He sat down and wiped a tear from his eye. He Did want to see the
Circus, and he DID want to hear what Pat would say. Just then Emma
Emu came along. ?Hullo, Benny,? she said, ?you look Very Sad.?
?Well, Emma, it?s like this,? replied Benny, ?there?s a Circus in town
and Teddy has nothing in his pocket except a HOLE. Hoppy and I are on
our way to tell Pat all about it, but Hoppy has Such long legs. I wish I had
Long Legs,? added Benny sadly. ?Hoppy must be half-way there by now.?
?We?ll soon fix that , Benny,? said Emma, ?hop up on my back.? Benny
jumped up with delight and In a Twinkling was on Emma?s feathery back.
?We?ll show Hoppy a Thing or Two,? she said, ?my legs are twice as
long as floppy?s. Besides, I know a Short Cut. Hold on tight, Benny,
won?t you??
?WHOOPEE,? cried Benny, ?off you go, Emma. Go Like Anything!?
What with Emma?s Long Legs and the Short Cuts and All, in very little
time they arrived at Pat?s place. She was surprised to see them!
Page 6


?Hullo, Emma and Benny,? she said, ?what brings you here so early
this morning??
?Pat,? cried Benny, jumping up and down, ?there?s a CIRCUS come to
town!?
?Really!? said Pat, ?how exciting!?
?Yes,? said Benny, ?they?re putting up a Big Tent in the grass paddock
opposite the store, and there?s elephants and ponies and lions and Every-
thing. Then Benny became sad. ?But I don?t think we can go,? he said.
?Gracious, Benny,? said Pat, ?why not??
So Benny told her about the Hole in Teddy?s pocket and All Their
Troubles.
Just then Hoppy the Hare came hurrying in, and didn?t he get a surprise
when he found Benny had got there before him!
?How did you race Me, Benny?? he asked crossly.
?You said Long Legs were Very Useful,? replied Benny peeping
across at Emma.
?But You?ve got Short Legs,? said
Hoppy, glaring.
Benny said nothing. He just
Looked Mysterious.
?Never mind,? said Pat, ?it really
doesn?t matter who got here first. I
have a lot of pennies in my Money-
box and we can all go to the Circus.
But where?s Teddy?? she asked.
?He?s Making Up Songs, and put-
ting on his Very Best Clothes and
Locking Up His House,? said Hoppy.
?I wish he would hurry.?


cxm �?<*??
Meanwhile Teddy had dressed
himself and brushed his fur. He
looked very nice, but was feeling
rather sad, so he said:
?Poor Teddy and Benny haven?t
a penny,
I really am feeling quite blue,
We?re ready to go to see the
great show,
I wonder whatever we?ll do!?
Then he remembered that by
now Pat would know all about
Their Troubles, and would be sure
to help them. He got very excited
and locking the door put the key in
his pocket. ,She tried to open the
but frond he had locked him-
self IN! ?Tut, Tut,? he said, ?I?ll
have to get out by the Window.?
He climbed out and then found he
couldn?t fasten it! So he had to unlock the door, go inside, fasten
the window and lock the door again. ?Ha,? he said, ?it?s locked up at last ,
and Pm Outside!?
He set off down the track to Pat?s place, but after a while he got tired,
and sat down for a rest. Then he began to think:
?It?s a Very Long Way on a hot
Summer?s day,
I wish I?d remembered to bring
To this pretty spot some Jam in
a Pot,
It would have been Just the
Thing.?
He looked up and saw Kanga
the Roo.
?Hullo, Kanga,? he said Very
Hopefully.
?Hullo, Teddy,? said Kanga,
?are you asleep??
?No,? replied Teddy, ?I?m Mak-
ing Up a Poem, thinking of Jam,
and Having a Rest.?
Oh,? said Kanga, ?you are very
clever, Teddy, to be able to do so
many things All At Once.?
Page 8


?It?s Quite Easy,? replied Teddy, ?but you?ve got to Know How. I?m
going to Pat?s place, Kanga, but I?ll tell you WHAT you give me a Ride,
and some day I?ll make up a Poem all about you. Now, what about that??
?Will it be a Very Nice One?? asked Kanga.
?Yes,? said Teddy brightly, ?it will start something like THIS:
?Kanga the Roo got All In A Stew ??
?That?s not at all nice,? said Kanga, ?I don?t want to get into a Stew
I think it would be Most Uncomfortable. You?ve heard of Kangaroo-Tail
Soup, haven?t you?? Teddy thought Very Deeply and at last said:
?You?re Quite Right, Kanga;
The Poem won?t say One Thing
about Stew,
In fact, Every Bit will be All
About YOU.?
?Thank you, Teddy,? replied
Kanga gratefully. ?Now hop up and
you?ll soon be with Pat.?
Teddy enjoyed the ride and be-
fore long, he arrived at Pat?s place.
?Gracious, Teddy,? she said, ?You DO
look nice! I?m just getting some
lunch ready, then we will all go and
see the Circus together.?
Teddy was very happy when Pat
gave him a Whole Pot of Jam all to
himself. After lunch, Pat, Teddy,
Emma, Hoppy and Benny all set out


for the Circus in the big paddock. All around the tent were cages with all
sorts of animals in them. A band was playing and the men wore pretty red
coats and a clown was beating a Big Drum. Teddy got most excited, and
started to run on ahead. ?Come back, Teddy!? called Pat, ?don?t be so
impatient. Here?s a penny?get some nuts at the store for the monkeys.?
Presently they all stood by the cages wondering what to look
at FIRST.
Then Pat said, ?You all wait here while Igo and get the tickets. And
mind you, Teddy, don?t go and get into mischief.? In a big cage was a lion,
but it was in a bad temper. It jumped
at the bars, and let out a loud
?B?RRR!?
Poor Teddy, who was nearest, got
a great fright and went off saying
to himself:
?I don?t like Lions?they get in a Rage
I?m so glad he?s in a Very STRONG
;*5 CAGE!?
He hurried off to see the Monkeys.
They were chattering and making a
great TO-DO.
?Wonder what they?re talking
about?? he thought. ?Perhaps they
want some nuts.?
Teddy had Great Fun feeding
them, and they squabbled and pushed
each other as he handed up the nuts.
Page 10


Presently he had only One left,
and when a big, surly monkey held
out his hand, Teddy pulled the nut
away.
He did this several times, and
the big monkey got Very Cross.
Teddy laughed Like Anything, but
didn?t notice how near the cage he
was. All of a Sudden the monkey
reached out and grabbed Teddy by
the ear and Pulled and PULLED!
Poor Teddy squeaked loudly, but
the monkey hung on, and didn?t let
go until Emma Emu hurried up and
gave the monkey?s arm a very Hard
Peck. Teddy went off rubbing his
ear, saying to himself:
?That monkey has Very Bad Manners, I fear
To twist and pull a Little Bear?s Ear.?
In the paddock was a large elephant. Teddy had never seen one
before and his eyes were round with surprise. ?Gracious, Emma, how
queer,? he said, ?it?s got Two Tails one at Each End!? Then Emma
explained to Teddy:
?The Front Tail is a Trunk. It helps it to Eat With, and Carry Things.?
Teddy walked round and round the elephant, and then gave its tail
a tug.

Teddy promised he would be
Quite Good, and Pat hurried off
home. A clown came into the ring
riding a Donkey. He stopped, and
called out that he would give Five
Shillings to anyone who could stay
on the Donkey for One Minute.
?Gracious!? said Teddy, ?I
could Just Do with Five Shillings!?
Benny, Hoppy and Emma all
told him he might Get Hurt, but
Teddy said:
?Fiddlesticks! It will be Quite
Easy. I had a ride on Kanga this
morning.?
Teddy went down into the ring and told the clown he could do with five
shillings Very Nicely. ?All right,? said the clown. ?Up You Go!?
He helped Teddy on to the Donkey?s back, and Everybody clapped,
and called: ?Good Old Teddy! Hang on tight! Don?t let him Buck you
Off!?
But Benny, Hoppy and Emma were worried. They didn?t Like the
Look of Things At AIL The Donkey went right around the ring, but
Teddy thought it was a Bit Slow, so he gave the Donkey a Smart Slap with
his paw. At once the Donkey started to race around with Teddy clinging
on to his neck, but All Of A Sudden,
when the Donkey jumped sideways,
poor Teddy was thrown into the air,
and landed on his head with a BUMP
into the sawdust! Teddy picked
himself up, and brushed his trousers,
saying:
?That Donkey played a Nasty Trick;
My head must be as hard as Brick.?
But the clown was a Good Chap
and gave Teddy a shilling All for
Himself. Teddy was delighted and
proudly showed it to Benny and the
others as they left the tent.


?Gracious, Teddy,? said Benny,
?what a Lot of Money! What are
you going to do with it??
?Look!? said Hoppy, ?there?s
an Aunt Sally over there. See if
you are a Good Shot, Teddy! You
may get a Prize.? Teddy looked
over. ?That?s a Good Idea, Benny,?
he said. ?You watch. That chap
is going to get a Big Surprise!?
A man in a tall hat was calling
out: ?Come on and try your luck.
Three shots for a penny.?
When they came up the man said: ?Hello, Teddy! See if you can
throw straight!?
Teddy handed over his shilling, and got change. Then he picked up
three balls. ?You see, Benny,? he said, ?I?ll knock them All over.? He
took very careful aim, but missed. He tried with his second ball, and
again missed. ?That?s Not Good,? he said rather crossly, ?I MUST hit
Something with my last ball.?
He tried to throw Very Hard, but the ball slipped out of his hand. He
certainly DID hit something. He hit the man right on the Nose and nearly
knocked him off his feet. ?Come on, fellers,? cried Teddy, ?let?s get out
of this!?
Page 14


They all ran off in a Great Hurry. ?You said you?d give the man a
Big Surprise, Teddy,? said Benny, ?and you Certainly DID.?
As they were leaving the grounds, Teddy caught sight of a Hoop-la
stand. He was just wondering whether he would spend any more pennies
when he saw on the table a Pot of Jam! ?Ha!? he said excitedly, ?that?s
exactly what I have been Looking For!? He paid three pennies, and
picked up a number of hoops. With his Very First shot the hoop dropped
right over the Pot of Jam! ?Hooray!? cried Teddy. ?What do you think
of thatl ?
Teddy threw another hoop, and it went round a Golliwog. He kept on
throwing, and soon had some boxes
of sweets and soap and a Lot of
Things.
?Here?s a penny, You have a try,
Benny,? Teddy said. ?See what you
can do.?
Benny tried Ever So Hard, and
looked very sad when he didn?t get
One Thing.
?Never mind, Benny,? said Teddy,
?you can have this Golliwog ?or
some soap.? Benny still looked sad.
?Thank you, Teddy,? he said, ?but
I?d rather have Something To Eat.?
?All right, Benny,? said Teddy


By the time they got there, Pat had everything
ready. The table was covered with All Sorts of Nice l
Things. She had made a cake for Teddy, and it had ,
his name on it, and there was plenty of Jam which
Later on, when they all felt they just couldn't ||
eat One Thing More, Teddy cut the cake. Then Pat
got some pretty paper and wrapped up a Large Piece J

all his parcels, except the soap. ?I don?t need that,"
