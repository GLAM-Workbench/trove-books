A HINT OF IMPORTANCE
When your oven is in use, cas-
serole your vegetables. Cook in
the ordinary way by putting into
boiling salted water, allowing extra
cooking time, as the oven heat is
not as great as that of an open
flame. Pour off the water when
cooked, adding pepper and butter.
Thus vegetables are served up in
the warmed Servex Casserole, elim-
inating wastage of gas, and extra
washing up.

Tarts are Greatly Improved
if You Use a
SERVEX
Tart Plate
(Nos. 2400 or 809)
3/3 5/6
Here again, you have the plea-
sure of serving a tart in the
attractive plate in which it was
cooked. These are well-tried
recipes.
BANANA AND LEMON.—Three-
quarter cup sugar, 2 tablespoonsful
flour, 2 tablespoonsful cornflour, i
teaspoonful salt, 2 egg yolks
(beaten), 2 cups scalded milk,
grated rind lemon), 2 bananas
(sliced). Mix sugar, flour, corn-
flour and salt well, add egg yolks
and milk. Cook and stir over low
heat (or in double saucepan) until
very thick and smooth. Add lemon
rind. Remove from fire, chill.
Line a tart plate with short crust.
Cover bottom with sliced bananas.
Pour in above filling and cover top
with lemon meringue.
LEMON MERINGUE. —Beat 2 egg
whites stiff, add 4 tablespoonsful
sugar and \ teaspoonful lemon
juice. Place tart in slow oven and
bake until meringue is golden
brown.
BAKE-WELL TARTS. —Four table-
spoonsful currants, 4 tablespoons-
ful sugar, small piece candied peel,
2 tablespoonsful apricot jam. Beat
together 2ozs. butter, 2ozs. sugar,
1 egg. Stir in 2ozs. cocoanut and
pile on tart. Bake in moderate
oven 20 minutes.
NOUGAT TARTS. —Line a Servex
tart plate with thin pastry and
spread very lightly with jam. Then
fill the tart with the following mix-
ture: 2 cups dessicated cocoanut,
1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoonsful bak-
ing powder. Sift these well to-
gether, and moisten with a well-
beaten egg and 1 tablespoonful of
milk. Bake for f of an hour in a
very slow oven. Should be a nice
golden brown.
BAKED FlSH.—Steaks or fillets of
any white-fleshed fish, salt, sour
cream to cover, dry breadcrumbs.
Cover the bottom of a well-greased
Servex tart plate with the white-
fleshed fish. Add salt and bake in
a very hot oven for five minutes.
Add sour cream to cover, sprinkle
with fine dry breadcrumbs, and bake
until the crumbs brown and the
cream becomes a richer colour.
Sour cream adds much flavour
to the fish, as the acid in it takes
the place of lemon, and the cream
supplies the fat which is lacking
in white fish.
POTATO SAVOURY. —Try your
cottage or shepherd’s pie recipe in
your Servex tart plate, with sea-
soned meat in centre, and piled
high right round with mashed
potatoes. It looks more appetising,
and the tart plate can be utilised
when other Servex pieces may be
otherwise engaged.

OVEN TABLE CHINA
his unique "oven table" China is the most
recent . . . and by far the most exciting . . .
development in the sphere of matters domestic!
There was a time when cooking—and serving
—a dish in the same utensil was simply "not
done," or if it was, the utensil was disguised, as
well as might be, by a linen frill, or some other
device.
But now, hostesses would scorn any suggestion
that a disguise should be used. They are proud
to display their Servex China . . . and with very
good reason.
Nothing that science and art have so far pro-
duced, in household china, can rival the charm
of Servex . . . with its delightful colours ... its
artistic and intriguing shapes ... its undoubted
lasting qualities . . . and its perfect culinary
results.

SERVEX GOOD COOKING GOOD LOOKING


Try these “Egg Notions ” in your
SERVEX
Egg Dish
(No. 233—2/9)
How different! . . . How tasty!
. . . Eggs cooked in the Servex
Egg Dish take on a decided
individuality.
BAKED EGGS WITH TOMATO
PUREE.—Butter Servex egg dish,
add some tomato sauce or puree,
break eggs and dust with salt and
pepper, and add sornie knobs of
butter and breadcrumbs. Bake till
eggs are set.
DAISY EGGS. —Six eggs, 6 rounds
of toasted bread, \ cup milk, i
teaspoonful salt, . pepper. Butter
toast and place on Servex egg
dishes. Separate the eggs, leav-
ing each yolk separate in a small
dish; beat the whites until light.
Pile the whites on the buttered
toasted bread, which has been
dipped in cold milk. With the
back of a spoon, make places in
the white of egg and put a yolk
in each; place in a hot oven for
three minutes, or until the egg
are set or baked to your liking.
Dust with salt and pepper. Serve
at once. This makes a very appe-
tising dish.
SWISS EGGS. —Grease a Servex
egg dish, and line it with very thin
slices of cheese. Dust with cayenne.
Carefully break in as many eggs as
will fit the dish. Pour over a little
top milk and sprinkle with grated
cheese. Dot with small pieces of
butter and cook in a moderate oven
till the eggs are set.
EGGS ON MINCE. —Put some well-
seasoned cooked mince into egg
dish, and break eggs on top. Cook
till eggs are set. This is a very
tasty dish.
EGGS MORNAY. —Make a rich
white sauce and flavour well with
pepper, salt, and some grated
cheese. Put a layer of the sauce
in the bottom of a Servex egg dish,
break into it at intervals one or
two new-laid eggs. Cover with
more sauce, sprinkle well with
grated cheese, and a little butter,
bake in a medium oven till the eggs
are well set (about 15 minutes).
Use a Servex utility or pudding
dish for larger quantities.
SAVOURY CUSTARD. —Boil some
macaroni in salted water, and place
in the bottom of the Servex Egg
Dish. Cover this with finely chop-
ped ham. Beat 2 (or 3) eggs, and
add f pint of milk. Sprinke the
ham with seasoning (salt, pepper

erate oven till set.
EGGS with ham or bacon look far
more attractive when cooked and
served in Servex. Omelettes, Loo,
can be cooked to perfection . . .
and as there is no transferring
from pan to plate, there is no risk
of their breaking.
SERVEX MEANS PIPING HOT MEALS


The Modern Idea is —
Use
SERVEX
Individuals
(No. 2779—2/3)
There’s subtle flattery in serv-
ing food in Servex Individuals
. . . and look at the work you
save yourself!
BAKED EGGS.—Butter Servex
Individuals, put teaspoon milk in
each, and break egg carefully on
top. Dust with salt and pepper,
and put tiny knob of butter on
top. Stand dishes in baking tin
half filled with water, and bake
in moderate oven till set. Serve
individuals on plate with teaspoon.
MILK RICE. —About 1 dessert-
spoon rice, little sugar and nearly
fill Servex Individual with milk.
Add little butter. Dust with nut-
meg, and put in oven to cook. This
is especially good for children.
Sago or tapico can be cooked in
the same way.
STUFFED EGGS. Five hard-
boiled eggs, 3 tablespoonsful cheese
(grated), 1 teaspoonful vinegar, 1
cup white sauce, 1 teaspoonful
mustard, 1 teaspoonful salt, few
grains cayenne, 1 tablespoonful
butter substitute. Cut the hard-
boiled eggs in halves lengthwise,
remove yolks, mash, add grated
cheese, vinegar, mustard and salt
and a few grains cayenne. Add
melted butter substitute. Shape in
balls size of original yolks, refill
whites. Place in Servex Individu-
als and pour around white sauce.
Bake in an oven with oiled crumbs.
SPAGHETTI.—About half fill Ser-
vex individual with cooked spa-
ghetti, add skinned tomatoes chop-
ped, cheese and onion grated,
pepper, salt and mustard, and just
enough milk to prevent sticking.
Cook till tomatoes are done.
CHEESE FONDUE. —Take 1 cup
grated cheese, 1 cup breadcrumbs,
\ pint milk, 2oz. butter, 2 eggs,
pepper, salt and cayenne. Boil the
milk, add the breadcrumbs, butter,
cheese and seasonings, beat the egg
yolks and add* them. Beat the
whites to a stiff froth and fold in
lightly the last thing. Bake in
Servex Individuals or in Servex
Pudding Dish, well buttered. They
will take from 20 to 30 minutes in
a moderate oven.
POTATO PUFFS. —Four boiled po-
tatoes, loz. butter, | cup milk or
cream, salt and pepper, 2 eggs.
Mash potatoes. Beat in the butter,
milk, salt and pepper. Beat egg
yolks and whites separately. Add
yolks to potatoes, then fold in
beaten whites, stirring lightly.
Bake in buttered Servex Individuals
in a moderate oven till puffy and
brown.
CUSTARDS. Servex Individuals
make excellent Custard Cups. You
may pour boiling custard into them,
or bake custard in them, and they
may be placed in the refrigerator
without fear of any harm. This
applies to all Servex dishes.
