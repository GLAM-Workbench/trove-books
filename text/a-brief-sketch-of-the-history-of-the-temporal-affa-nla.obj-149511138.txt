A Bf\IEF SKETCH
OF THE
AFFAIRS OF THE DIOCESE OF BRISBANE.
[The following Account has been 'prepared by the Rev. J. Gilbertson ,
at the request of some members of the Church , and is now published
for the information of those interested therein].
THE Bishopric of Brisbane was founded in the year 1859, and its first
bishop, Dr. Tufnell, arrived in the colony in the following year. The
diocese has had to struggle with adverse circumstances from the outset,
circumstances which have never been sufficiently weighed by the Church
Authorities in England, and are not known even to the mass of churchmen
in the diocese itself.
The diocese, as an institution, dates from the period of the separation
of what is now Queensland from the colony of New South Wales. At
that time the Legislature of the parent colony recognised the moral useful-
ness of religion, and gave sites for churches, parsonages, and schools, as
well as grants of money towards the stipends of clergy and school teachers.
It being expected that Queensland would continue this course, the church
authorities were given to understand that sufficient funds would be pro-
vided to allow four or five hundred pounds a year for the Bishop as well
as for part stipends of clergy. Some friends of the Church in England,
through the Colonial Bishoprics Council, contributed and invested in
consols the sum of six thousand pounds to assist the diocese in providing a
stipend for the Bishop. The income of the see being both small and
precarious, the charge was declined by several clergy for want of sufficient
private means. Unfortunately for the church the leading men of Queens-
land were chiefly Philosophical Radicals in politics, and Dissenters in
religion ; and hence it came to pass that the very first Parliament abolished
that system of State aid to religion, which was so necessary for the welfare
of the country, and which had been inherited with the other laws of New
South Wales. On Dr. TufnelTs arrival he found that the State assistance
which he had been led to expect w r as already at an end, and that the whole
of his official income consisted of the interest of the six thousand pounds
invested in England, and was something like two hundred pounds a year.


The abolition of State aid was a serious blow to the Church, for
although the allowances to the clergy then officiating were continued to
them, there was nothing for the Bishop or any new clergy. But even this
was not all, for another blow was aimed at the church in the matter of
■education. At the time of Separation the Denominational and National
systems were in operation. Under that condition of affairs the former
system had, in what is now r Queensland, six Church schools and four of
the Church of Eome, whilst the National had only one , and that one was
what was then known as a non-yested school. The National Board was
established by the year 1848, and it had in 1859 but this one little ewe
lamb in the new colony, and even that, from a “ Nationalists ” point of
view, was a u black-sheep thing.”
The Philosophers and Dissenters, on acceding to authority, established
a National School Board, and left the Denominational Schools without
funds. The Education Act of 1860 was so worked by means of “ regula-
tions,” that for some years the church schools had no assistance from the
State, and but for funds from England would have been closed at once.
Even after the prohibitive regulations had been declared illegal, difficulties
were raised, so that it was some years before any schools connected with
the religious bodies w’ere allowed any money from the State ; but even
that did rot continue long, for school fees were soon abolished, and this
stroke of policy having cast the schools altogether on the State revenues,
the end could not be far off, and came with the present Education Act
about ten years ago.
Under the State Aid Abolition Act of 1860 the two or three Church
clergy then officiating were secured, during official life, the continuance of
the .£lOO per annum they were then enjoying, and the Yen. B. Glennie,
though he has a pension from the Church as a retired minister, still
receives the above sum per favour of the Government.
The State policy, in respect to religion, could not but be highly
injurious to a church, the members of which had not been accustomed to
provide for the support of their clergy. The blow r was as well aimed as it
was maliciously conceived, but it was not so deadly as it was intended to
be; in some measure it paralysed, but it did not kill. For although the
Bishop found himself deprived of the income he had been led to expect,
and seriously crippled for funds, for stipends, church buildings, schools, and
teachers’ salaries, he did not despair; he had brought some seven thousand
pounds from England, collected for the erection of a see-house and other
church purposes, and applying himself manfully to his task was nobly
aided by his friends at home, who remitted to him during the period ending
1865, sums of money averaging over seven hundred pounds a year, which
were not applies! to the increase of his miserable income but to the other
purposes of the church. The members of the church were either too
much occupied with their own needs to help the Bishop, or they were so
struck with the figure of Apostolic poverty and patriarchal simplicity
walking in their midst, that they gazed on the wondrous sight, and went on
their way thinking of Elijah fed by ravens, and of Elisha and the widow’s
cruise. Ultimately the Bishop visited England and obtained permission


to employ the money from the Colonial Bishoprics Council in the diocese*
itself, where a higher return could be obtained than was possible in?
England ; and in order to this end, he consented that his private property
should be made chargeable with the full sum so as to secure the diocese
from any loss. About this period the colony entered on a period of
financial depression which precluded any growth in church finances, and
moneys invested on mortgage could scarcely be realised by sale of the
properties. To add to his difficulties, Dr. Tufnell was unpopular ; he was
a moderate high Churchman, and what was even worse, he would not sub-
mit to spend or invest the money raised by his friends and submitted to
his discretion, according to the fancies of irresponsible advisers who had
done nothing towards obtaining or increasing those funds. Ihe advantage
or propriety of the Bishop’s course in this matter may, in some measure,
be judged from the facts that while his private property could be taken to
make good any loss to the Endowment Fund by his investments, a sum*
raised in the colony, together with six years’ accumulated interest, was
invested by its trustees with such result that out of the sum of £2,200
invested, only £BB3 returned to the coffers of the Church.'* Then again
people who did little or nothing for the Church objected to the Bishop
getting money from England—they were satisfied that the diocese needed
no such aid; it had only to be discontinued, the proper spirit to be evoked,
a popular system inaugurated, the financial affairs to be entrusted to busi-
ness men, and then Pactolean streams would overflow the barren fold.
Such a system has been recently tried—“ Lector , si monumentum requins
circumspice .” The Bishop worried and wearied, gave way, and ceased to
ask help from his friends, so that since 1867 the diocese has not been
burdened, and its energies repressed by other English money than the-
grant from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and even that
has ceased for now nearly four years in consequence of the success of the
General Church Fund. There have been men in the diocese who have-
professed to believe that the benefits of Dr. Tufnell’s episcopacy were not
merely problematical, but, in an unusual sense of the term, vncalcidable ;
they must, however, be few in number who fail to see any value in such,
cash figures as the following, even if they can look no further :

Since his depature, Dr. Tuffnell has sent out the sum of £5OO as a
fund for the repairs of Bishopsbourne.
The Diocese of Brisbane owes the above sum of over fifteen thousand
pounds to the efforts of Dr. Tufnell and his friends, over and above the
sum of £6,000 subscribed in England for the endowment of the See. Of
the money laid out as above, there is more than the full value of seven
thousand pounds in land, buildings, and cash. That the See Endowment
Fund is now about four thousand pounds greater than it was a year or so
•ago is owing to a general rise in the value of property, and the sale of
some land in the Valley. That sale, owing to the peculiar aptitude
of the Corporation for business, is reported to have profited the
purchaser in a few months one hundred and fifty per cent, on
his purchase. The attention of churchmen having been directed to the
necessity of the establishment of some regular form of government for the
temporalities of the church, the churchmen of the Diocese associated them-
selves together in a legal way, as a Branch of the Church of England,
under a constitution agreed to on the eighteenth day of June, 1868. By
fundamental and unalterable provisions it is declared that the church holds
and maintains the doctrine and sacraments of the Church, the Book of
‘Common Prayer, and the Scriptures, &c., as received by the Church in
England. And a further unalterable provision constitutes a Synod of
Bishop, Clergy, and Laity as the governing body, the consent of which
•orders, expressed by their respective majorities on all measures within the
scope of the constitution, being necessary to all regulations binding on the
•church.
It is impossible to reprint that constitution here, so suffice it to say
that it is a well-considered document, and if its provisions are fairly con-
sidered and honestly carried out, it cannot fail to be conducive to the well-
being of the church.
Of course the Synod cannot always be sitting, and therefore a stand-
ing committee called the Diocesan Council is constituted as a Council of
Advice to the Bishop. There is often a tendency on the part of possessors
of authority to seek to extend it, and this course has so marked the
Diocesan Council that its conduct of late has been more becoming the
ministry of a Government than that of a Council of Advice. The proper
■course of business under the Constitution would be for the Council to
advise the Bishop, but the course followed is to decree that certain things
be done. This places the Bishop in a very unpleasant position, for though
he is empowered to refuse his assent to the course agreed upon by the
Council, his doing so is a much more unpleasant matter than declining or
■deferring action, and would place the Bishop in an antagonistic position
towards those who are fixed upon him as his council by the Synod, and
who, with all due deference be it said, are not always the wiser or most
■experienced church workers.
The tendency of the Council, especially of late, is to strain its powers
and reduce the Synod to a condition like unto the ancient parliaments of
France, which were called together to register the decrees already resolved
upon.


After an episcopate of fourteen years, a period of arduous care,
opposition, and hostile criticism, Bishop Tufnell resigned the see, which
was filled by the appointment of Dr. Hale, of Western Australia.
At the time of Dr. TufnelPs resignation, the utmost annual income
obtainable from the endowment was but £420. The insufficiency of this
amount was felt on all hands, and, on the motion of Mr. Drew, the
the Synod resolved to increase the sum for the incoming Bishop to £l,OOO
by the means of annual subscriptions. Hence arose the Bishop’s Stipend
Augmentation Fund, the need for which has now T ceased by the increased
value of the Valley Estate, most of which has been sold. Perhaps it was
time that something was done, for the subscriptions, which were nearly
£5OO after the arrival of Bishop Hale, had fallen to £163 before his
departure.
A public reception was given to the new Bishop, and upon reference
being made to the condition of the Diocese, and the need of funds, the
Bishop was bidden u to cast himself on the laity, who would not fail him.”
The Bishop expressed himself as much gratified at finding “ such a body
of men ” as the Diocesan Council were ; the confidence he had in them
would be a great comfort to him when out in the far interior, and there he
must be, “ for he felt that his place was in the field.”
Dr. Hale soon set out to ascertain by personal inspection the state
and needs of the Diocese, going even as far as Blackall in his quest. At
the Synod of 1876 the Bishop spoke at length, and with painful feeling,
as to the spiritual destitution which he saw on his journey, and also as to
a growing contentedness with that condition on the part of the people, and
he repeated his former saying, that under existing circumstances, the place
of the Bishop was “in the provinces, going from town to town, and from
district to district.”
The report of the Diocesan Council for the year 1876 states that one of
the first steps taken by the Bishop was the inauguration of a system for
collecting a fund under the provisions of the Diocesan Fund Canon, pre-
viously passed, in order to the introduction of clergy, and their partial or
entire support in country districts, the aiding :n the erection of churches,,
parsonages, and other such church work.
The canvas for this fund was taken up with such spirit that in
fifteen months the sum of £2,200 had been raised.
The Bishop set vigorously to work to obtain clergy ; not content with
those obtainable in Australia, he advertised in England, offering passage-
money and a certain engagement at £3OO a year for three years.
It has been said that for a time the Diocese became a very cave of
Adullam ; for at least a dozen men, mostly “ birds of passage,” were soon
introduced at a cost of nearly £BOO. Very few stayed out their three
years, and three of the old clergy were crowded out by the newcomers.
The General Church Fund, as it was called, was general only so far
as it applied to the Diocese at large, not that it was applicable for all
purposes. The fund was intended only for the purposes above indicated,
and confidence would naturally be engendered in the public mind in the
proper application of the funds by a provision of the Canon that no portion.


of the money raised under it might be applied to Synodical purposes, i,e. f
the working expenses of the Synod.
Now, however, the General Fund has become general in the widest
sense. Such a loose method of management was soon adopted, that the
original purposes of the fund hare fallen into such an inferior place that
in 1884 but little more than eighty pounds, out of four hundred and fifty,
expended, were applied to the proper objects of the fund.
One of the first departures from the right way, was the employment
of a paid Secretary who should travel through the country, holding meet-
ings, collecting subscriptions and donations, and forming country associa-
tions and committees. To this end the Men. Archdeacon Glennie was
appointed, and if he travelled at all on behalf of the fund, he confined his
journeys to the precincts of Brisbane. Hence many persons regarded the
appointment, and indeed the office itself, as merely a way of providing for
a venerable clergyman who was too old for parochial work. This view
deiived much support from the creation of the office of secretary of the
Diocesan Council, and appointing the Archdeacon thereto, thereby finding
more work so as to justify the payment of the salary of £2OO a year, and
reducing the secretaries of the Synod to the position of mere occasional
clerks or secretaries of the Synod meetings, and depriving them of the due
influence belonging to their office, and removing a very important check
from any other officer who stood u near the Throne.’’
At the first establishment of the fund, Bishop Hale contributed most
generously a donation of £2OO, and promised an annual subscription of
inciting the flame of generosity in others.
From March, 1876, sc far as can be gathered from the published
accounts up to June 80th, 1878, there had been collected from various
sources the sum of £2,792, of which the Bishop had given £4OO, or say
one-seventh from which it would seem the jieople had not been as deeply
impressed with the needs of the Diocese as the Bishop, but the people had
had another call on their purses which the Bishop had not, for they had
subscribed over £9OO to the Bishop’s Stipend Fund.
The chief sources of the fund for actual gifts have been Annual Sub-
scriptions, Donations, Offertory moneys, and Parochial collections which fell
from £570 in 1878 to £306 in 1880. One cause of this was the discon-
tinuance of the Bishop s annual subscription after the second payment in
the first half of 1878. In 1881 there was a debt of over £1,300, and the
Bishop came to the rescue with an offer of one-half, provided the other
half was contributed in sums of £SO. A special collector was appointed
for this sum, and he collected it and a sum of about £l6O over, being just
enough to pay the cost of the collection of the £650. The sum given by
the Bishop makes up to the end of his episcopate the sum of the annual
subscriptions promised by him, and which convinced the people that he
tvas then in real earnest about the work.
hrom March, 1876, to the end of June, 1884, eight years and a
quarter, by much effort, by threatened resignation of Bishop Hale, by
statements of funds, by travelling collector, by the Bishop’s munificence,
by special and urgent appeals, and other cunning devices, some thousands


of pounds were raised, of which, however, nearly five thousands were con-
tributed by parishes for the stipends of their own clergy, which were paid
through the fund, a system that, among other conveniences, helped to swell
into large figures the money contributed to the fund. The sum of £3.122
represents the amount contributed from the General Fund (proper) to the
clerical stipends paid through it.
The fund in question might fairly be expected to pay a charge com-
mensurate with the expenses incurred on its account ; but as the Parish
contributions, Parochial collections, and offertory moneys formed the bulk
of the money received, the office labor and expenses, fairly chargeable to
the fund, must have been small indeed.
The pleas put forward for the collection of the fund, contrasted with
the uses to which the money has been applied, have brought it unto such
low esteem that although a special claim was put forward during 1883-4
on the ground of the intended sending of a clergyman regularly to visit
the Benevolent Asylum at Dunwich, the receipts from all sources was but
£290, a sum too small even t'o pay the office rent and secretary’s salary.
To pay the deficiency, together with office expenses and the sum of £BO
voted in aid of two clergymen, it was necessary to add £l5O to the exis-
ting debt.
It was suggested years ago that a Church Society, like the one in
Sydney, worked by volunteer laborers, would be less costly and more
effective, for experience shows that people will not continue to give to or
labor for a fund over the expenditure of which they have no control, and
of the benefits of which they never see evidence or hear tell.
The following is a statement of the expenditure from March, 1874*
to July, 1884, viz.—

If, from the amc unt charged as for certain sdpends, the sum con-
tributed by the parishes for their own ministers is deducted, it will be
found that out of /8,000 expended, about one-third, i.e,, £2,680, has
been expended for management.


All the districts opened uo by the General Fund have been aban-
doned. The Bishop’s grounds of lamentation over Leyburn, Charleville,
St. George and Surat, Clermont and Copperfield, Taroom, Goon i-
windi, Wivenhoe, Mount Brisbane and Esk, Caboolture, North ana
South Pine Rivers, and Humpy Bong, sail exist in full force. All
.attempt on the part of the church to provide religious instruction, an
counsel at the gaols and reformatory is given up, and the infirm an
sick at the hospitals and the benevolent asylum are left uncared tor.
Religious consolation and instruction it would seem are deemed by the
council very good things if you can easily spare the money for them, but
.an obliging secretary and an accessible and convenient office are things
of prime necessity. . , . . , ,
No doubt if churchmen are in earnest and arc satisfied with the ex-
penditure of the General Church Fund, they will support it. What
measure of earnestness and confidence exists among them may e
justly measured by the support given to it by those in a position to
know most about it, and an examination of the report for 1884: will s ow
that ot the members of Synod, Bishop, Clergy, and Laity—ninety
persons in all —the names of five only appear on the list of subscriber .
But what are they among so many? The five, though few,were S e^ero^ s
.and proved they were in earnest by the twenty guineas they contributed.
A matter of very serious import to the Diocese is the loose manner
in which its business is carried on in relation to money and other pro-
Pe following instances are facts which are not intended to charge
or insinuate fraudulent intent in any case. They are mentioned to s ow
the great need of care, and how even well-intentioned men go astray in
the management of property which does not belong to them.
When the first paid secretary to the General Fund was engage ,
his salary was fixed at £2OO per annum, and for the first nine mont s
he was paid at that rate. For the remainder of the time, however, ne
was paid £275 a year without any increase of salary having ee^vc^ l j'
No entry of any such vote could be found in the minute book ot e
Council when examined on this account.
The facts of the case, briefly put, seem to be that a sum of £7O was
once paid by the Bishop to the Archdeacon for representing him when
he was away in the interior. The Council, on learning this, apP^ ar °
have made that amount a regular charge on the Bishops
Augmentation Fund as an addition to the £l,OOO a year to the Bis op
which was to cover all charges, and then the treasurer, on finding t e
subscriptions to the fund falling off, deemed himself justified in saddling
the sum of £75 on the General Fund as “ Salary to Secretary.
Ingenious if not ingenuous. . UT ,
The Synod repoit for 1880 makes mention of what is called ine
Warwick Railway Land Account,” whereas it ought to be “ The Warwic
Glebe Land Account,” inasmuch as its subject is money received for
Glebe land taken for the Railway, and which should be invested m
other Glebe land, or in the permanent improvement of the remaining


property. This money was applied for as the property of the parish, but
legal opinion pronounced the projected transfer illegal. Notwithstand-
ing this, however, the Council voted the payment. The money was
paid over, and appears in the accounts as a “ Loan to the Warwick
Trustees.” In the report for 1880 this money is said to be advanced to
“Warwick Trustees,” and in another part of the same report it is
charged to the “Warwick Vestry” In the report for 1882 the money
is called the “Warwick Yestry Land Account,” as if the money
belonged to the “ Yestry ” instead of the estate of the parson of the
parish.
Such a changing of names and consequent concealment of fact,
though strange, is not singular, there being a like case at Dalby.
A sum of £350 was received for Glebe land resumed at that place,.
which money, pending investment, lay in the bank, the interest being
paid to the minister.
Application was made by the parish officers fcr the money, that
they might reduce the church debt therewith, tut Bishop Tufnell refused
this misapplication of the money. Soon after the arrival of Bishop-
Hale, however, Dalby wanted a new church.
Ihe clergyman of that day did not care about the money coming
to him from the Glebe land account, but he did care about a new church,,
so he made no difficulty when application was made to the Council for
the £350 “on mortgage.” The report of Synod for 1876 states that the
Diocesan Council approved of the proposal, and submitted it ffir the
ratification of the Synod ; but no particulars cf a mortgage were sub-
mitted to ffie Synod, nor was any resolution so much as moved on the
subject. Si ch an impediment, however, did not prove a hindrance, the
money was paid away, and is entered in the books as “ Repayment to
Dalby Trustees approved by Synod ” The trustees applied for a loam
on mortgage, and the treasurer “ re-paid ” them money they had never
possessed. What an innocent Hibernicism !
. Glebe moneys, however, have not been denied the comfort of com-
panionship in misfortune.
The wrongful investments of the Bishopric Endowment Fund call
for notice. When Bishop Tufnell handed over to the Synod the money
and property in his hands, the trust deed restricted the investment of
the money to Government securities, bank deposits, and first mortgage
on real property, but the Corporation does not take kindly to these
restrictions, and has refused to be bound by them, e.g.
1. The Stanthorpe Estate.— A clergyman at Stanthorpe in-
duced thereto partly by some kindly words of Bishop Hale,
and partly by opportunity, wanted to buy the house and paddock
which he occupied, so he sought for a small loan from his
Bishop to help to complete the purchase which was to be a
cash transaction. The Bishop felt deeply for his poor brother; he did not
lend the money, but he laid the case before the treasurer and the Council
with such success that the “ Estate ” was bought from and for the See-
Endowment Fund. The investment, it was said, was sure to yield ten


per cent, as the wardens were paying £3O a year for the ministers occu-
pancy at the time. On the completion of the purchase it was found
necessary to spend <£so on repairs, and this being done it turned out that
Stanthorpe was in such a depressed condition that the wardens were
unable to pay rent for the minister’s residence any longer. After years
of unfruitfulness, the land was at last let on royalty for tin mining. When
the mining on the estate was over, and the fence repaired at a cost of £lO,
there was a balance of £7 10s. to serve as interest on an outlay of £3so'
for four or five years.
The marvellous profit on this transaction does not make the venture
to have been within the range of the legal investments of the fund.
2. Loan to Fortitude Yalley.— This loan affords another
instance of the indifference of the Synod Corporation to the conditions
under which they hold money. The sum of £I,OOO was wanted towards
the erection of the church in Fortitude Galley, and this sum was lent
on a joint and several note, mainly indeed on one name. A repayment
of £2OO has been made, and a joint note only taken as security for the
balance. It is satisfactory to know that in this case there will be no loss.
Neither the purpose of the loan nor the solvency or honor of the
gentlemen signing the note are in any way impugned, but the existence
of these conditions does not make a promissory note a bank deposit, a
Government security, or a mortgage on real estate.
3. An equally illegal and a very unfortunate case was the advance of
money to build a new parsonage at Warwick.
From the point of view of the parish, perhaps the matter was well
managed. There was a debt due to the Endowment Fund for an advance
of £3OO towards the stone parsonage built under Archdeacon Glennie.
No interest was paid on this loan, and the Synod was rather sore about it.
In 1877 it was announced that the parish of Warwick had made
arrangements for the early repayment of this debt. The somewhat
estranged Synod opened its heart to the parish, and sanctioned a proposed
leasing of the parsonage and Glebe land, and the purchase from the pro-
ceeds thereof of a piece of land near the church, and the erection of a
rectory house thereon. The land was to cost £350. On application to
the Council the sum of £1,200 was advanced for the new parsonage and
Glebe land fencing, on the security of an undertaking that during the
incumbency of Warwick by the Rev. J. Matthews, the rent of the old
parsonage and the Glebe land should be applied to the payment of interest
and repayment of principal as long as should be required. The old debt
of £3OO vanished, and some mythical trustees are supposed to be bound
to the repayment of £1,200. Seven per cent, interest was to be paid, and
the debt, it was said, would be paid off in seven years. It is being gradually
paid, so gradually indeed that at the rate hitherto prevailing, there was a
prospect that the debt would be extinguished during the second decade of
the next century. Now the leased parsonage and the land, 146 acres, are
let for £77 10s. a year, so that after the payment of £7O as interest on
the debt of £I,OOO still owing, there is £7 annually towards the repay-
ment of the above sum, and he would be an adroit financier who could


guess or ascertain by an amount of labor commensurate with the worth of
the object in how much less time than two centuries that debt
will be paid. From the parish point of view, perhajos the genius who
brought about the present state of things, deserves a rich reward. Cer-
tainly it does not appear that the Warwick conscience has suggested the
righteousness and worldly propriety of making the Rector live in the old
parsonage, that the new one might be let, and the rent of that charming
urban residence applied to reducing the debt, so that in the course of a
generation or two the church might come to her own again. The proba-
bility is that if the present system is continued, the interest will ere long
cease to be paid, and the Statute of limitations will do the rest.
There is another case affecting the same parish of Warwick.
A sum of money for the endowment of schools, raised by collections
in the Diocese, grants from the Bishop of Newcastle, and interest on the
same, was transferred by Archdeacon Glennie in 1878 to the care of the
Corporation of the Synod “ and their successors.”
Of this fund the sum of £621 4s. Id. was advanced to fie u Warwick
Vestry,” but appears in the accounts as part of the loans to the “Warwick
Trustees” of £lß2l 4s. Id., from which it would seem that the Vestry
and the Trustees are the same persons, or that the latter are responsible
for the former, and that the money has been expended on the parsonage.
A sum of £62 appears to have been paid as interest up to 1880 on this
School Endowment money, but no further sum has been paid, and it is
understood that the parish claims the money as its own property. The
Corporation of the Synod, *>., the Bishop, the Treasurer, and the Chair-
man of Committees, and their successors were made the legal custodians
of the money, the interest of which was available for the education of youth in
the principles of the Church of England. The present Corporation have
parted with the money, and there are no persons to make restitution. The
Treasurer has already suggested that the debt of £621 should be wiped off.
Warwick Trustees or Wstry, one or both, or both one, have had
church moneys as follows :
£ s. D.
Endowment Fund Loan
1200 0 0
021 4 1
146 18 3
School Endowment Fund Loan .
Glebe Land Fund Loan
1968 2 4
Of this sum the See Endowment Fund has been repaid £193 9s. 3d.,
whilst for the balance there is no available security. The income from the
leased lands is available only during the incumbency of the Rev. J.
Matthews.
It should be borne in mind that the permitted leasing of the War-
wick parsonage and land, was on condition that a piece of land should be
bought near the church, and the new rectory house erected thereon. If
that condition had been insisted upon by the Corporation, the house and
land would have formed some security for repayment of the money
advanced. The representatives of the parish had a keen eye to business ;


they got the money and spent it. The Corporation were careless, no land
was purchased, but they did not krow it or care about it, and the Rectory
was built inside the church fence, on land which the Corporation knew
would not be touched.
Another example of the disregard of conditions in dealing with
church property which the Diocesan Council and Corporation of the
Synod exhibit, is the case of the Leichhardt Street School lands. The
land in question is strictly tied up for school purposes. The present
system of education renders theTmilding and land unavailable at present
for their proper uses.
The Geueral Church Fund being deeply in debt, the Council were
minded to sell the school land, and devote its proceeds to the General
Fund. To that end a bill was submitted to Parliament, authorising the
sale. A petition to the Assembly, however, led to the defeat of the
project, and then it was asserted on behalf of the Council that they had
not really needed the approval of parliament, and could have sold the
property without asking its consent.
The Constitution, it is true, forbids the alienation of properties from
the uses to which they have been devoted, but then on the other hand, the
Corporation and the Council, it would seem, know but little, and care
even less for the Constitution, when its provisions stand in their way.
The growing disregard for law on the part of the officers who for
year after year have had the management of affairs, and the decline of
the spirit of watchfulness in the annual meetings of the Synod tend to
thorough disorganisation.
The Synod has a model Trust Deed, under which, by the Constitution,,
all properties are to be held, but this was found inconvenient, and in
practice it has been set aside.
Again, a mutilation of Canons by a recent Editor, although proved
before the Synod, has not drawn forth a reprint, or any acknowledgement
of error from the Council under whose auspices it took place, and whose
thanks were voted to the injudicious editor.
Attention needs also ito be paid to the recently enacted Standing
Orders of the Synod, which actually set aside in some matters the pro-
visions of the Canons and the Constitution.
This ignorance and carelessness appears to have [originated in the
short sessions of Synod, and frequent changes of its personel, and by the
absence from the Council of any official charged with the duty of attend-
ing to the legal aspect of things proposed to be done, and who has a
knowledge of the past history and business of the Synod. The present
Standing Orders never could have been agreed to if there had been any
one present when they were made, who had such knowledge and duty
as above.
# The Synod Canon makes the Bishop or his Commissary, appointed by
writing under his hand, President of the Meetings of Synod. Standing


Order No. 2, however, allows an Archdeacon, or the senior clergyman
present, to act as President in case of the absence of Bishop and Com-
missary, so that a sitting of Synod might be held with one order of the
Synod absent.
Again the Canon makes the presence of the Bishop or his Com-
missary necessary to form a quorum ; but the Standing Orders dispense
therewith.
The Canon requires, besides the presence of the Bishop or his Com-
missary, that of five licensed clergy and ten lay Synodsmen to make a
quorum; but the Standing Orders allow of a quorum at the beginning of
business, of any fifteen, so long as there are present five of each order.
Again, the Canon requires the same number and quality for a quorum
all through a sitting of the Synod, but the standing orders allow of a
quorum to consist of one order only, so long as there are fifteen persons
present.
It is a fundamental and unalterable provision of the constitution
that the consent of all three orders, Bishop, Priests, and Laity, by their
majorities, shall be necessary to all acts binding on the Synod ; these
“ majorities” would be most easily ascertained by separate voting, but
Dr. Hale never would take a separate vote unless a division was insisted
on. But the standing order goes further than that in the way of obstruc-
tion, by directing that a motion shall be resolved by a majority of voices
“aye” or “no,” or by a show of hands, and permits of a division by
orders, only on a demand made by the Bishop, by two clergy, or two lay-
men. When that regulation is coupled with the other, allowing business
to be carried on without regard to orders, it is easy to see how a division
by orders might be rendered impossible.
By the previous standing orders it was required that any resolution
intended to be permanently binding should pass through the same stages
as a Canon ; but under the rule of “ legislation made easy” the present
standing orders allow a permanently binding resolution to be agreed to on
a second reading, the first of which is always taken as a matter of form,
so that now a measure equivalent to a Canon may be passed with no more
consideration or formality than is accorded to a vote of thanks to the
Press, and less than that is “ unthinkable.”
The Corporation of the Synod was constituted under the Beligious and
Charitable Institutions Act, on petition to the Governor by the Synod in
1870, and consists of the Bishop, the Chairman of Committees and the
Treasurer. The Bishop is an abiding officer, and is supposed in himself
or by his officers, to be conversant with all the laws and affairs
of the Synod, and his presence in the Corporation is regarded by church-
men generally as a tower of strength, not only on account of his integrity,
but because he is for himself and his successors beneficially interested in
the lawful investment of the Church property, whereas the chairman of
committees and the Treasurer, however high principled and able, have no
such interest as the Bishop, and are creatures of frequent election. It was
quite a revelation to Churchmen, when they were recently told by the


‘Treasurer that the late Bishop never interfered in the doings of the
Corporation, although he was its head, and that he was neither legally
nor morally responsible for its acts.
For years it has been pretty well known that the estimable chairman
of committees, might for the business purposes of the Corporation be
regarded as the “ alter ego ” of the Treasurer ; who thus in effect becomes
a Corporation sole. The statement that a trustee is neither iegally nor
morally responsible, shows an instance of moral and legal obliquity which
is marvellous.
The eia of prosperity which was to follow on the departure of Bishop
Tufnell, appears to have been indefinitely postponed, the diocese at this
moment is in a lower condition than it has been for many years, and there
does not seem even a rift in the clouds which obscure the horizon. But a
change for the better could be brought about if any man should arise in
whom Churchmen could and would confide, and who would not go rashly
to work. The precise measures to be adopted need wise consideration.
Some men consider that the circumstances of the times point to the
need of enlisting the services of laymen in ways that have been but
little tried as yet. Something better at any rate is needed than a repetition
of the old policy, i.e. a sudden introduction of a large number of clergy
and a costly system of maintaining them. The “ General Fund” should
cease at once and for ever. The very name should be blotted from
remembrance.
Something must be done for Home Mission work, but whatever
mode may be adopted in raising and applying funds, it would seem that
the recent method must be abandoned.
It is to be hoped that an experienced financier, and a man of some
originality and vigour of character may be found, willing and fitted to
inaugurate a new method.
The system of sole clerical management which at first obtained in the
Diocese, was deemed unsatisfactory. The system of leaving all to the
laity has been a failure. Perhaps it might be wise to afford an incoming
Bishop a more active share in the affairs of the Church than can be taken
by one who abnegates his headship and voluntarily occupies the position
of chairman of a republican committee—who may not initiate anythino-, or
act in any case of the temporalities, save as he is directed.
No abrogation of Canons or Constitution is needed; let the Diocesan
Council be, as it was intended to be, a council of advice. Give the Bishop
power to nominate as members of the Council some clergy and laymen in
whose judgment he personally has confidence.
Let not the Council seek to prescribe what shall be done save so far
as is committed to them by Canon, but let them give to the Bishop the
benefit of their advice on the matters submitted to them. Under such a
system a Bishop could defer or decline any course recommended, with


which he was not satisfied, without placing himself in the position of
antagonism or submission to the Council which the present mode of
acting necessitates.
The Bishop’s headship should not be forgotten, acknowledging and
acting upon the legal and moral responsibilities which that headship
involves, he would not imperil the funds of the Diocese by a silent
acquiescence in the views of others, and would thus inspire that confidence
in Church affairs which if not new wanting is fast waning.
More than this might be deemed intrusive and impertinent in one
not called on to advise, and at any rate I remember that unasked counsel
is lightly regarded.
