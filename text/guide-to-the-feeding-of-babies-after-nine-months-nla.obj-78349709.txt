Guide to the Feeding of Babies
after Nine Months*
For Breast-fed Babies a special weaning pamphlet is used, covering the
transitional period.
IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER.
Remember that at this stage food tastes and habits are formed, which
may last a lifetime.
Remember too that at 6 months baby should be gradually taught by his
mother to chew a finger of oven-dried (that is, twice baked bread) daily.
This will establish a habit of thorough mastication before thickened foods
are introduced, and will help when baby is teething.
1. Teach Baby to Drink from a Cup when between 6 and 9 months,
gradually discontinuing the use of the bottle.
2. Keep Absolutely to Regular Meal Times. Give nothing whatever
but water and fruit juice and piece of apple between meals.
3, As Baby Takes More Solid and Varied Food he needs less milk,
but do not let him go without a drink at each meal. Remember that
milk is still the child's chief need.
4. It Is Not Wise to Give Milk Unsealded or Undiluted to any
Child. Stir, bring to boil quickly, and cool quickly before using.
5. Introduce All New Foods One at a Time and a Little at a Time.
Never make sudden changes. It is better to go too slowly than too
quickly.
6. Teach Baby to Eat Each New Food That Is Good for Him. Do
not let him start the bad habit of refusing food because he does not
like it. If persevered with, babies like almost anything that is good for
them. They will not want the things that are bad for them if they have
never tasted them. Do not let them acquire a taste for cake or sweets.


7. Active Exercise for Teeth, Jaws, and Salivary Glands Is Absolutely
Necessary. Baby must be taught to chew, not to bolt his food, and, as
time goes on, to take more and more of his food in hard form. Remember
that toast or crusts, with butter or dripping, and a drink of milk, are
just as nourishing, and better for teeth and digestion, than a basin of
bread-and-milk. Always give crusts under supervision.
8. Add No Cane Sugar to Baby?s Food. It is bad for the teeth
and the digestion, and baby gets ample starchy or sugary material in
better form in his cereal foods.
9. Cook All Foods Thoroughly and Serve Appetisingly. Add a
little salt in cooking.
10. Children should not be continually urged to eat if they are
disinclined to do so. Under no ordinary circumstances should a child be
forced or coaxed to eat to satiety ? especially is this so during teething
and weaning periods.
11. If There Is Any Important Article of a simple diet, such as
milk, meat, cereals, or vegetables, which a child habitually refuses, this
should always be given first at the meal, and other food withheld until
this is eaten.
12. Always give the most substantial meal in the middle of the day.
Never give a young child a meal of meat and vegetables before he goes
to bed at night.
Give some raw fruit or vegetable juice daily, at least until the
child is old enough to take a fair amount of whole raw fruit daily.
Orange, Lemon, Grape-fruit, and Tomato Juices are best.
N.B. ?Do not pour boiling water in fresh fruit juices.
Teach Baby to chew his food. Give oven-dried bread (that is, twice-
baked bread) about 10 minutes before meals, not between feedings. Give
water and fruit juice only between meals. N.B.?Use white bread until
Baby is 9 months old, then gradually introduce wheatmeal or wholemeal
bread that has been twice baked in the same way.
Always scald milk and cool it rapidly. When increasing milk
always do so gradually?half an ounce at a time.
Level Spoonsful.? All spoonsful in the recipes in this booklet are level,
not heaped. Fill up and level off with a knife.
When Baby is 6 months old, certain additions to his diet are made in
order to educate him to the taste and feel of foods other than milk, and
also, if artificially fed, to supply his system with extra mineral salts and
vitamins.
The additions suggested should be made one at a time, commencing
with vegetable juice or broth, and as these are educative only, quantities
must not be increased unless special advice is given.
Over Feeding must be avoided. Baby should never have more than
8 ozs. of milk mixture at a feeding, and at 6 months should gradually be
trained to drink from a cup.

the permanent teeth are all through.
Karil may be used from 12 months and onwards.
Solid, Tough, Dry or Hard Food. ?Crusts, and oven-dried or crisp, toasted
bread, and stale bread?all to be given with a little butter or dripping.
Don?t butter toast when hot. Use wholemeal bread.
Cereal Jellies to be continued. Gradually increase the amount of
unstrained porridge into the strained jelly until at 15 months all is

9 months.
Broths. ?Fish broth, chicken broth, bone or mutton broth made thick with
vegetables. Never use broth more than once or twice a week.
Vegetables. ?Spinach, cauliflower, carrot, turnip, marrow, floury potato
cooked in skin, etc., well cooked, rubbed through a fine sieve, and

\ piece of raw, ripe apple after meals, also giving the juice of some
raw fruit or vegetable daily.
Egg.?A yolk may be given three times a week at the midday meal, a
little white being added gradually until at IS months 3 whole eggs
may be given each week.
Fish and Brains may also be introduced at the end of this period,
giving 1 level teaspoon increasing to 1 dessertspoon.
N.B. ?Get Baby accustomed to a dry evening meal ?that is, a meal
without any mushy food. The child?s capacity to chew will naturally
guide the mother in this matter. If baby has been educated to chew
hard foods, such as crusts and oven-dried bread, he should at this
period be able to take most of his food in a hard, dry form. A
semi-liquid diet is unnatural for a child who has teeth.
SUGGESTED MEALS FOR CHILD FROM 12 TO 15 MONTHS.
Early Morning Drink. ?Fruit juice and water.

NOTE. ?The early morning drink may be discontinued as soon as the
child takes sufficient milk with three main meals. A drink of water,
or fruit or vegetable juice, may be substituted, breakfast being made
the first meal of the day.


FEEDING BETWEEN 15 AND 18 MONTHS.
Three meals daily with extra milk drink in the early morning.
If Baby is taking sufficient milk during the day, give fruit juice and
water instead of milk drink in the early morning.
Milk Mixture. ?20 ozs. cow?s milk (scalded) diluted with 3 ozs. of water.
In addition, enough water should be taken to ensure a total intake
of considerably more than this". More fluid should be given in hot
weather, the precise quantity needed depending also on the amount
of exercise taken, etc. Thirst is a clear indication for increasing
the fluid.
Other Foods. ?On same lines as during previous period, but give more
of the solid, dry, tough and hard foods, including wholemeal bread;
milk puddings made with whole rice, sago, tapioca, etc. Always give
a piece of raw, ripe apple at the end of each meal. Continue training
the baby to chew thoroughly, and avoid giving much soft, mushy food.
Egg, coddled or lightly boiled, not more often than 3 times a week.
White Meat. (Twice weekly.) Fish, chicken, brains. Chicken
steamed and well minced. Only a teaspoon of either chicken
or fish should be allowed at first, increasing to 4 level teaspoons
(i.e., 1 tablespoonful) at 18 months.
SUGGESTED MEAL FOR CHILD FROM 15 TO 18 MONTHS.
Arranged on?sa.me lines as for previous-period,' increasing quantities
gradually according to/the age,-activity-'and appetite.-' Give some food
requiring chewing at' each meal* and see - that it is chewed. -- \i there is any
difficulty, give the hard food? first. ?Especially avoid semi-liquid foods at
tea-time. Bread, mostly wholemeal (preferably dried or : toasted), with
milk to drink, and fruit, is sufficient for the evening meal for a healthy
child who has really learned to chew. However, beware of underfeeding
if the child does not take hard foods well. Scald and cool a pint of
milk, add 3 ozs. of water, put aside for Baby?s drinks. You thus ensure
his getting his supply.
MORE POINTS TO REMEMBER IN THE FEEDING OF OLDER
CHILDREN.
1. Cultivate a taste for simple foods, well cooked but not overcooked,
with sufficient variety to prevent distaste arising from monotony.
2. Regularity. Three meals a day. Give no milk and no pieces of any
sort between meals; only water or fruit-juice to drink or * piece of
apple.
3. The importance of ample exercise for jaws and teeth, and consequently
the great need for giving a large part of the diet in the form of
hard, tough, or dry foods. Give the dry foodstuffs in the dry state,
and the fluids as drinks, rather than give semi-liquid foods. For
instance, oatcake or wholemeal bread and butter with milk to drink
is better for health and digestion than gruels or bread-and-milk.


4. The importance of the daily use of fresh fruit and vegetables, especially
of some uncooked fruits, and green vegetables, such as spinach and
lettuce.
5. Tea and coffee are as harmful to children as ample pure water is
necessary and good.
6. Light meats, such as chicken, lamb, brains, tender tripe, rabbit, etc.,
may be given in small quantities, also liver (see recipe), but there
is a general tendency to give too much, too early. Ample flesh-forming
food can be given in the form of milk, eggs and fish. Fish is a
valuable food and should always, if possible, be included in the diet
and be given twice weekly in place of meat and eggs.
7. The undue use of preserved and tinned foods is damaging to health.
8. The practice of sweet-eating must be wholly condemned as being
ruinous to teeth and digestion, on account of acidity produced.
18 MONTHS TO 2 YEARS AND ONWARDS.
Further increase the use of hard and dry foods, including oven-dried
wholemeal bread, oatcake, etc.
Milk is still a most important article of diet. Use at least 1 pint
daily, also supply enough water. Increase the use of vegetables, adding
to the previous list all kinds of young, tender greeri and root vegetables,
onions, young tender corn on cob. Give raw fruit, daily if possible.
If fresh, sound and ripe, any of the ordinary fruits may be used.
Tomatoes are risky if there is any unsoundness; bananas should be both
ripe and sound, and, if used, must be mashed with a fork to prevent
bolting. Apples and oranges are safest and best. Most other fruits
should be allowed only in strict moderation, otherwise they are very liable
to cause irritation, fermentation, and diarrhoea; this applies specially to
fruits with seeds (raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc.).
Encourage a child to drink fruit and vegetable juices, raw and cooked.
Cooked fruits should be prepared with dates, raisins or honey for
sweetening purposes.

RECIPES.
Remember that all starchy foods are converted into sugar during
digestion, therefore do not add sugar to the recipes.
Toasted Bread or Twice-Baked Bread.
Cut bread and place on edge (not lying flat) in oven with door
ajar, and dry until crisp, or cut slice of bread about \ inch
thick and cut into fingers about 3 inches long and � inch
thick, and place in a slow oven till crisped and golden brown.
Bread may be partly dried in the oven and then lightly toasted
until crisp and slightly browned.
(Bread only one day old makes much better toast than stale
bread.)
CEREALS:
Barley Jelly.
Robinson?s Patent Barley?2 level tablespoons; pinch of salt; 7 ozs.
of water.
Mix smooth with about 1 oz. of the water. Gradually add the
remainder of the water (cold). Put on to cook, stirring until
it thickens and comes to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.
Oat Jelly.
Into 7 ozs. of boiling salted water sprinkle tablespoons of Scotch
oatmeal. Cook for 20 minutes over direct heat, then transfer
to double saucepan and cook for U ? hours longer. Strain
through fine wire sieve.
Robinson?s Patent Groats may be used when it is made in the
same way as in the recipe for Barley Jelly given above.
Wheatmeal Jelly.
Make as for Oat Jelly.
In very hot weather a mixture of sago and oatmeal or wheat-
meal may be used?the proportion being one-third sago, two-thirds
oatmeal or wheatmeal.
Flaked Oatmeal Porridge.
Flaked oatmeal, 2 tablespoons; water, 7 ozs.; and a pinch of salt.
Cook in a double saucepan (or in jug standing in a saucepan
with boiling water) for 1 hour, after 20 minutes? cooking directly
over heat.
Prune Juice.
Wash and soak about 7 prunes in about 2 ozs. of water overnight.
Next morning leave them in the same water, cover vessel
containing them, and place in a saucepan of boiling water and
steam till tender?about 1 hour. (Strain through muslin if used
for young babies.)


Prune Puree.
Wash prunes and soak overnight in cold water. Prepare as above.
Press through sieve. (Raisins may be added and cooked with
the prunes.)
Apple.
Bake or steam in skin. Scrape from under skin when first giving
apple, and sieve. If need for sweetening, use natural sugars,
such as dates or honey.
Dried Apricots.
Take about 7-8 dried apricots. Soak in 2 ozs. of water for 24 hours
and gently simmer in the same water until tender.
Fruit Salads.
Salads may be made from grated raw apple and chopped nuts;
mashed banana and orange pulp; peach or apricot pulp, with
finely chopped walnuts; grated raw apple and carrot. Chopped
raisins or dates may be added to the salads, also orange or
lemon juice.
Apple Charlotte,
Stew some apples with a little honey, or a few chopped dates
raisins. Line a buttered pie-dish, with wholemeal bread crumbs.
Fill up with stewed apples, cover with more wholemeal bread-
crumbs, and bake hard in a slow oven. -
Vegetable Juice and Puree.
One carrot, 1 small potato, 3 or 4 leaves of spinach or silver beet
(be sure to use small, young, tender leaves), small piece
cauliflower, sprig parsley. Grate vegetables; cut greens very
fine. Put into boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes, just
covering vegetables with water. Put through sieve. (Note ?
at first, strain clear; later press the cooked vegetables through
the sieve.) A little scalded milk may be added to increase
food value.
Mutton Broth.
Stock for Broth.?Take a mutton shank, well broken up into 6-7 pieces.
Wash well and cook in 1 pint of water. Add salt. Cook slowly
with lid on saucepan until only 8-9 ozs. of fluid remain. This
should take about 4 hours.
To Make Broth.?Bring required amount of stock to boil. Have
ready vegetables?greens cut up and root vegetables either cut
up or grated. Put into fast-boiling stock and cook for 10-15
minutes with lid on saucepan. Press through sieve to make
broth.


Baked Potato.
Scrub potato. Place in hot oven and bake till soft (30 to 40
minutes). Crack the skin to let steam out. Serve with a little
chopped parsley on top. If puree required, cook potato as
above, remove inside, and press it through a sieve.
Vegetables.
To obtain the full food value of vegetables, cook with the least
amount of water possible. Steam or boil quickly with the
lid on the saucepan. The water in which vegetables are cooked
should be saved and given as drinks, or used for making stocks
and gravies. Soda should never be used in cooking vegetables.
Potatoes should always be cooked in their jackets, whether baked,
steamed or boiled.
Root vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, swedes, parsnips, artichokes,
contain most mineral matter just under the skin, so always
scrape as little as possible off. Wash them carefully, cut into
small pieces, place in a saucepan containing a small quantity of
salted water, and cook slowly with the lid on, or steam in
double saucepan.
Almost all vegetables, can. be cooked by the ?casserole? method.
Prepare vegetables and place in the casserole with a little water
and salt. Place lid on the casserole to retain the moisture.
Another method of oven cooking is as follows;? Wrap any root
vegetable in greaseproof paper and place on oven shelf. Cook
in oven of steady heat. Either of these methods requires only
perhaps 10 or 15 minutes longer than boiling, and there is no
waste.
Another economical method as regards heat and the conserving of
all possible value in the vegetables is as follows:?Use water-
proof paper. This is specially manufactured paper, and can
be procured at any big stationers. Prepare vegetables in usual
way, then tie in individual packets in the waterproof paper.
Place in saucepan about a quarter full of water, or in a steamer,
and cook 30 to 40 minutes, according to the type of vegetable.
Any vegetable can be cooked in this way, also several packets of
vegetables may be cooked in one large saucepan without any trace
of flavour from one vegetable affecting another. Meat and fish
may also be cooked in this paper at the same time as the
vegetables.
Vegetables cooked and set with gelatine often appeal to the child who
is difficult with vegetables served in the ordinary way.


Pea Soup.
Two cups of dried peas, 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of fine wheat-
meal, salt to taste, 1 dessertspoon of butter.
Method : Soak peas 24 hours or longer. Put to cook with plenty
of water. Add to it a little fresh mint. When cooked, wash
through a sieve or strainer. Put milk on to boil in a saucepan.
Mix wheatmeal to smooth paste, stir into hot milk, and boil up.
Sir all gradually into peas. Mix well, boil for 10 minutes, and
add butter and salt, and serve.
Raw Vegetable Salads may be made with lettuce, cress, or spinach, a
little finely grated raw carrot, shredded cooked beetroot, or
young raw grated beetroot, tomato or celery. Finely chopped
nuts or a little grated cheese may be added for a change.
Oat Cake.
Rolled oats, 3 cups; flour, 1 cup; salt, i teaspoon; baking soda,
i teaspoon; 2 tablespoons of butter dissolved in 1� cups of
boiling water.
Mix all together, roll out a portion at a time (very thinly) on
a board dusted with oatmeal, cut into pieces; sprinkle a little
oatmeal on the hot oven tray; place cake on this, put in a
warm oven, and bake until slightly brown. If cake is soft
when kept, it can be re-crisped by placing in a warm oven for
a few minutes.
Fine wheatmeal may be used also.
Bran Biscuits.
1 cup of flour, 1 cup of wheatmeal flour, 2 large cups of bran,
1 egg, 2 lb. of butter, � teaspoon of salt, 1 small teaspoon of
baking powder, cold water to mix.
Cook in moderate oven till crisp.
Wheatmeal Crisps.
1 cup of wheatmeal flour, 2 cup of flour, i teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon
baking powder, 2 ozs. of butter.
Rub butter into wheatmeal and flour. Wet with milk. Roll
out thin and cut into fingers. Cook in moderate oven until
crisp.
Wheatmeal and Bran Loaf.
1 cup of wheatmeal flour, 2 cups of bran, 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons
of treacle, a teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of baking
soda, 1 dessertspoon of butter.
Mix dry ingredients. Stir in butter (melted) and milk, in which
the baking soda has been dissolved. Bake � hour.


Brains.
Wash well. Soak in salt and water for half an hour. Put on in
fresh salt and water, and bring to the boil quickly. Strain off
water and remove skin and dark portions of brains. Add a
little milk and butter and steam in small basin till cooked.
N.B. ?Begin with one teaspoon only in a little of the liquid.
Rabbit and Tripe.
These are best steamed or boiled, cooking slowly. Add salt.
LIVER.
It is now known that fresh liver has valuable food properties
enriching the blood. It is often ordered early by doctors in case of
anaemia.
N.B.?Only very fresh young liver should be used.
It can be introduced into soups (grating, say, 1 tablespoon of fresh
liver and cooking it with shank of mutton), or the juice can be
extracted (as in beef tea) and put over the vegetables.
Method of Making:
tablespoons of minced liver, 1 oz. of warm water. Pinch of salt.
Heat very slowly until the juice is extracted. Do not allow to
boil.
Later (18 months - 2 years) it can be finely minced and steamed
and given with vegetables, say twice weekly.
N.B. ?It must not be given unless very finely minced until the child
chews well.
