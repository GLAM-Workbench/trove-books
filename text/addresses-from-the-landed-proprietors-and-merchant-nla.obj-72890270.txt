ADDRESSES
FROM the landed proprietors and merchants
OF NEW SOUTH WALES,
TO HIS EXCELLENCY LIEUTENANT GENERAL DARLING,
PRESENTED, AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY,
ON SATURDAY, JULY 5, 1829.
THE ADDRESS
OF THE LANDED PROPRIETORS AND MERCHANTS
OF NEW SOUTH WALES,
To His Excellency Lieutenant General
Ralph Darling , Governor in Chief,\
Sfc. Sfc. Sfc.
May it please your Excellency ,
We, the undersigned, Landed Proprietors and
Merchants, resident in the Colony, beg leave to ap-
proach your Excellency, with unfeigned expres-
sions of duty and regard, and to state, that although
we have hitherto remained silent, yet it has been with
deep regret that we have long observed every mea-
sure of your Excellency grossly vituperated by
licentious public writers, in a manner calculated to
inflame the minds of the lower orders of the commu-
nity against your Excellency?s administration, and
to produce discontent and insubordination among the
prisoners of the Crown, for no other purpose than to
promote the interested views of such writers. As,
however, we now find that charges against your Ex-
cellency have been forwarded to the Home Go-
vernment, in the form of an Impeachment, we can
no longer refrain from an expression of our senti-
ments.
it is but justice to state, that we have long obser-
ved your Excellency patiently sacrificing your
health and comfort, by an indefatigable attention to
the difficult and arduous duties of the important
charge committed to your care by our gracious So-
vereign.
And it is gratifying to us to acknowledge, amongst
the important results of your Excellency?s labours,
many improved arrangements in the various public
Departments of the Colony.
We are convinced that every act of your Excel-
LUNCv?e ndmimctmtioa emanated from tLo pu
irest motives, and in the particular case upon which
the Impeachment is founded, we feel confident
Jhatthe measures adopted were not only judicious,
but at that time imperative, and the result has been
the most satisfactory.
We deny that the political opinions promulgated
by the opposition journals are those of the more in-
telligent classes of the community, or that these pub-
lication* form any criterion by which the justness of
your Excellency?s measures can be appreciated.
Having thus conveyed to your Excellency our
feelings, we beg to express our sincere wish that
your Excellency?s measures may be justly appre-
ciated by the Home Government, and that you may
long continue in the administration of the high office
you now fill.

HIS EXCELLENCY?S REPLY.
To the Landed Proprietors and Merchants
of New South Wales ,
Gentlemen,
I have received, with sentiments of sin-
cere satisfaction, the Address which you
have done me the honor to present to me.
The public expression of the sentiments of
the independent- Landed Proprietors turd
Merchants of this important Colony, could
not fail to be as gratifying to me, as it i s
honorable to the feeling which has dictated
it on their part.
The Press has undoubtedly indulged it-
self to a most licentious and criminal ex-
tent, in its endeavours to degrade the
Government, and excite public discontent.
None but the ignorant, however, the slaves
of popular clamour, have been deceived by
the specious garb?the freedom of dis-
cussion??which these writers have as-
sumed, They are now making atonement
to the injured laws of their country, and
justice is, satisfied.
It is, I confess. Gentlemen, very gratify-
ing to me, that persons of your character
and estimation, the most extensive Land-
holders, and Merchants of the first consi-
deration, should have come forward on this
occasion to express the indignation you
have felt at the exertions which have been
made to injure my reputation.
As to the ? Impeachment? ?a gross and
absurd compound of base and incredible
calumnies ?it carries with it its own anti-
dote, and furnishes ample means of judging
of the character and motives of the author.
Gentlemen, you have not overrated my
desire or my exertions to discharge the
difficult and arduous duties of the im-
portant trust confided to me by my Royal


fZ/MtHijs i{%e

Master. 1 have allowed no consulerations to disturb the mind of our respected Go-
of private convenience or comfort to nter-
fere with the faithful performance of my
public duty. I pledged myself to this when
I first came amongst you ; and while I am
capable of rendering you any service, the
pledge shall be held sacred*
If, Gentlemen, there is any one part of
your Address more gratifying to me than
another, it is that wherein you ? deny that
? the political opinions promulgated by
� f the opposition journals are those of the
more intelligent classes of the comma-
�f nity. M ?These journals have laboured
incessantly to propagate a belief that they
are the voice of the public, well knowing
that they are not countenanced by any
man of character or common respectability.
The refutation of their assertions, i;i coming
from you, is from the best source?-the foun-
tain head itself; and few will dispute with
them the right or the honor of being the
organ of those individuals whose sentiments
and principles they have so zealously dis-
seminated.
It is impossible, Gentlemen, I should not
feel gratified at the expresion of the wish
with which you have been pleased to con-
clude your Address. ?Allow me to assure
you, in closing my Reply, that as long as
His Majesty shall be pleased to consider
my services desirable here, and they
can be" rendered useful to your
and the general we 1 fare and prosperity of
the Colony, I sh ifl t e happy to devote them
to those favorite and important objects.
1 remain, Gentlemen, with sentiments of
unfeigned regard,
your obliged and
most faithful Servant,
Ralph Darling;.

ADDRESS
To His Excellency Lieutenant General
Darling, Governor in Chief tyc. fyc,
Sfc .
SIH,
We, the undersigned. His Majesty?s
loyal and dutiful subjects, the Landholders
and Resident Proprietors of the district of
the River Hunter, beg leave most dutifully
and respectfully to approach you, our
Gracious Sovereign?s Representative, and
to state, that it is with the deepest regret
and unraixed indignation we learn that an
Impeachment has been forwarded to Eng-
land against your Excellency by people
who, forgetful of the public good, and only
mindful of securing low popularity, while
actuated by motives of revenge and self
aggrandisement, have so often of late en-
deavored to stir the public mind against
the measures of your Excellency's Govern-
ment.
We, feeling convinced that the acton
which the impeachment is founded, ema-
nated from your Excellency with the
purest motives for the public good of this
Colony, and of His Majesty?s forces
therein ?and that it was necessary and im-
peratively called for by the apparent cir-
cumstances of the times, regret that any
person or persons could be found willing
vernoh, whose sole study, intense thought,
and unparalleled application, so directed to
the public affairs of the Colony, deserved a
far better reward?-the thanks of our Sove-
reign and of us?the latter of which we
feel pleasure in unfeignedly offering your
Excellency, in the firm conviction that
you will shortly be honored with the
former.
We could not fail to have admired the
dignified silence with which your Excel-
lency had so long treated the many wan-
ton attacks that were made against the
motives and measures of your Administra-
tion; and we feel convinced, that if your
Excellency were pleased to have added
thereto a contempt of such useless attempts
to lower or bring into disrepute those
measures, that your Excellency would
have thereby foiled every endeavour made
for that purpose, and have also silenced
those factious demagogues who alone are
found willing to impeach any act of yours.
With sentiments of the most profound
respect and dutiful attachment, we are
Your Excellency's most
obedient and humble Servants,
J. Reid, Andrew Lang:,
Francis Moran, M. D. Emanuel Hungcrferd,

HIS EXCELLENCY'S REPLY.
To the Landholders and Resident Proprie-
tors of the lower District of the River
Hunter.
Gentlemen,
I am very sensible of the kind feeling
which dictated the letter you have been so
good as to address to me, in consequence
of the ? Impeachment/' as it is desig-
nated, to which you allude; but which, in
fact, is the act of one solitary individual,
and not, as you appear to suppose, of any
number or body of men.
As to the attacks of a licentious Press,
every man of character must disregard
them* though the public good requires they
should be repressed.?That the public mea-
sures are aspersed by the journalists to
whom you allude, is at least some proof of
their merit.
I assure you, Gentlemen, it is very gra-
tifying to me to find that my exertions to
serve the public are so warmly acknow-
ledged by the respectable inhabitants of
vour valuable district.?The satisfaction I
derive from this circumstance infinitely
outweighs any disappointment I could ex-
perience from the efforts of the infatuated
incendiaries who have attempted to assail
my character, as they have the characters
of many others, and to disturb the Colony.
My endeavours to promote its best inter-
ests will, I trust, defeat their designs;
though I can entertain no hope that such
men will ever cease to condemn the pro-
ceedings of a Government which does not
avail itself of their willingness to espouse
its cause and advocate its measures.
I remain. Gentlemen, with my best-
wishes for your happiness and prosperity,
your sincere friend
and faithful Servant,
Ralph Darling
Government-house, 6th July ?
