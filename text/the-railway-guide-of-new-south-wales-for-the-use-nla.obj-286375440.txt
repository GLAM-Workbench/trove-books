chief ingredient of the JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT is the Eucalyptus, so that all these new-fangled

the healing power of JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT
[Copy of Letter.] “ Gaily Swamp, 25th September, 1882.
“ Gentlemen, — I have much pleasure in testifying to the wonderful curative effects of your Josephson’s Ointment on
my face and arms. About four weeks ago I was standing by 161bs. of blasting powder, when a spark by some means ignited
it, causing it to explode in my face and arms and neck, burning them dreadfully. I was recommended to your Josephson’s
Ointment, and after using seven of your pots, I am completely healed. —(Signed) GEORGE DIGBY.”
[Copy of Letter received from James Ford, of Macclesfield, England.]
“ Dear Sir,— l have to thank you for bringing Joseph,son's Ointment under my notice. About a month ago (March 25)
I burned my hands severely. The first day or two I used lime water and linseed oil, and after that the Ointment. At first I
only used the Ointment on one hand, but the ease which I experienced caused me to have both hands dressed with it. It
allayed the pain quickly, and caused to heal up and the new skin to form, which it has done with remarkable quickness, so
much so that I am starting my work to-morrow. —To Josiah Smale, jun., Bollin Mills, Macclesfield.”

PREFACE.
This Guide Book is intended as a convenient volume of reference for
excursionists and others who travel by Railway in New South Wales.
The Introduction contains a short history of the Railway system
of the Colony, and subsequent chapters furnish an outline of routes,
and all information as to the various Stations. The illustrated Itinerary,
for the use of the traveller in search of the picturesque, includes brief
notices of places of interest which lie within easy reach of the
Railway line, and the Tourists’ Map shows the mountainous country
traversed by the Great Western Railway, from the Nepean River to
Bowenfels.
The papers descriptive of the Fish River Caves, and explaining
the geological formation of the Blue Mountains, contributed by Mr.
C. S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., will be read with interest, as will also the
treatise by Dr. Woods, F.L.S., illustrated by Miss Harriet Scott, on
the Flora of that part of the country. The other illustrations form a
novel and interesting feature of the work; they are pictures from Nature,
reproduced by the photo-mechanical processes recently introduced by
Mr. Richards, ex-Government Printer.
The Compiler has to acknowledge his obligations to Messrs.
Burton, Tingle, Lyne, and Wells, from whose descriptive writings he
has derived much valuable information, which he ventures to believe
is now offered to the public in a compendious and convenient form.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.
The favourable reception which the Railway Guide has met with, and
the increasing demand for it, have made it necessary to publish a
second edition. Advantage has been taken of the opportunity to bring
the information to the latest date, and to include additional illustra-
tions, with the object of making the volume more useful and attractive.
This work will be found to be a convenient and valuable volume
of reference for excursionists and others who travel by Railway in
New South Wales.
The introduction contains a short history of the Railway
System of the Colony, and subsequent chapters furnish an outline of
routes and all information as to the various stations. The Illustrated
Itinerary, for the use of travellers in search of the picturesque, includes
brief notices of places of interest which lie within easy reach of the
Railway Line.
The papers descriptive of the Fish River Caves, and explaining
the geological formation of the Blue Mountains, contributed by Mr.
C. S. Wilkinson, F.L.S., will be read with interest, as will also the
treatise by Dr. Woods, F.L.S., illustrated by Miss Harriet Scott, on
the Flora of that part of the country.
As the Railways are further extended, fresh editions will be
issued, with additional illustrations and descriptions.

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.
I.—RISE AND PROGRESS OF RAILWAYS IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
Early History. —The first combined move-
ment on the subject of introducing Railways
into New South Wales took place in Jan-
uary, 184 G. On the 29th of that month a
public meeting was held in Sydney, and a
Committee appointed, who, on the 26th
August, reported that, from the best ascer-
tained data as to the products, population,
and traffic, they believed that a line from
Sydney to Goulburn might be constructed
at £6,000 per mile, and that a net profit of
8 per cent, might be anticipated on the
capital expended. In the beginning of 1848
a survey of the line to Goulburn was com-
pleted by Mr. Woore. In April, in the
same year, a petition, based on this report,
was presented to the Legislative Council,
and referred to a Select Committee, of which
Mr. Charles Cowper* was Chairman. A
report was brought up, and on the 15th
June the Council passed a series of resolu-
tions to the effect that the period had
arrived for the formation of Railways in the
Colony, and that it was expedient for the
Government to offer some inducements to
encourage private enterprise. The resolu-
tions were transmitted to the Secretary of
State by the Governor-General, with a
recommendation that the encouragement
asked for should be granted. On the 11th
lB4B, a Provisional Committee
was appointed, and in November the
prospectus of the “ Sydney Tramroad and
Railway Company” was issued. The capital
was £lOO,OOO, and interest for ten years at
5 per cent, was guaranteed by the Govern-
ment. The expressed intention of the pro-
jectors was that a main trunk line should
* Afterwards the Hon. Sir Charles Cowper,
K.C.M.G., now deceased.
be carried from Sydney to the point from
which it might afterwards he determined
that the Southern and Western or North-
western branches respectively should diverge.
Eventually it was intended to augment the
capital in order to carry the line to Goul-
burn, and, if found practicable, to Bathurst
also.
On the 13th November, 1849, the first
general meeting of the shareholders was
held, and the Sydney Railway Company
(incorporated by Act of 13 Victoria) then
entered on its duties, and was managed by
a Directory elected by the shareholders.
The survey of the line from Sydney to
Parramatta and Liverpool was completed in
December, 1849, and on Bth January, 1850,
the first report of the Directors was read.
It congratulated the shareholders on their
position and prospects ; and notwithstanding
the apathy of some persons and the undis-
guised hostility of others, the Directors
entertained the fullest confidence as to the
ultimate success of the undertaking. The
sum of £IO,OOO, required by the Act to be
raised before the Company could commence
operations, having been paid into the
Colonial Treasury, the Directors lost no time
in breaking ground. On 3rd July, 1850,
the first turf of the first Railway in the
Australian Colonies was turned by the
Honorable Mrs. Keith Stewart, in the pre-
sence of her father, Sir Charles Augustus
Eitz Roy, and a large concourse of inhabi-
tants.
The financial prospects of the Company,
however, soon become so gloomy that the
, Directors found it necessary to make a


general reduction in the salaries of their
officei’S. The Directors complained of the
obstacles they met with, and stated that, but
for the countenance and support of the
local Government, they should feel disposed
to abandon a post which was beset at every
stage with difficulties and discouragements
of no ordinary kind. In this unpromising
position of their affairs the first contract for
i\ miles from Haslem’s Creek towards Syd-
ney was accepted. The progress of the work
continued satisfactory until the discovery of
gold in the Bathurst district upset the calcu-
lations of the contractor and the Directors,
threatening the former with ruin and entail-
ing much anxiety on the latter, from the
sudden and unexampled rise in the price of
labour and materials. Under these circum-
stances the Directors were induced to release
the contractor from his agreement, without
enforcing the penalties for non-fulfilment.
The offer of Mr. Randal, the contractor, to
carry out the works to Ashfield, and subse-
quently to Parramatta, at a schedule of prices,
was afterwards accepted, and as the attrac-
tions of the Gold-fields continued to diminish
the supply of labour in Sydney, the Govern-
ment agreed to import 500 labourers from
England. An additional loan of £150,000
was obtained from the Government, in the
proportion of three-fifths of public money to
two-fifths subscribed, on condition that the
Government should have the power to name
one-half of the Directors. The Company had
now reached the last stage of its existence,
and its affairs were under the direction of a
Board, partly elected by the shareholders and
partly nominated by the Government.
At the first half-yearly meeting, on 17th
January, 1854, the Directors stated that from
the enormous rise in wages and materials
the cost of the line to Parramatta would be
increased from £218,420, as estimated in
1853, to £320,000, besides £69,000 for the
Darling Harbour works. To provide for
this, the capital was increased by £IOO,OOO,
and an additional loanjof £150,000 obtained
from Government, on the same terms as the
former loan. The estimate of £320,000 for
the line to Parramatta was made in antici-
pation of a fall in the rate of wages ; but
instead of falling they continued to rise, and
in January, 1855, the Engineer had to
increase his estimate to £500,000. This
startling announcement must have satisfied
the shareholders of the hopelessness of carry-
ing out the works at a profit, and prepared
them for a transfer of the property to the
Government.
While the Sydney Railway Company was
struggling with the unprecedented difficulties
of the times, and leaning on the strong arm
of the Government for support, a movement
took place in 1853 for the construction of
a line of Railway between Newcastle and
Maitland.
A Provisional Committee was appointed
on 20th April, and a capital of £IOO,OOO
subscribed on the spot. With flattering
anticipations, and the promise of aid from
the Government, the Hunter River Railway
started into life ; but after an existence of
little more than a year, which was necessarily
exhausted in preliminary arrangements, this
Company had also to yield to the pressure
of the times, and be swallowed up by the
Government.
Railways of N. S. Wales when trans-
ferred to the Government. —Accordingly,
under the Act 18 Victoria No. 40, the por-
perties of both the Companies were trans-
ferred to the Government, the Hunter River
at par, and the Sydney Railway with a bonus
of 7 per cent, added. From the date of these
transfers the Railways became the property of
the Government, and have since been carried
out under the superintendence of Government
officers.
The Railways of New South Wales, though
essentially one entire concern, as the pro-
perty of the Government, are at present
separated into two great divisions, wiz., the
Southern and Western Railway and the
Northern Railway—the one having its prin-
cipal terminus at Sydney, the other at New-
castle, upwards of 60 miles apart. Parliament
has, however, authorized the construction of
a line to connect the Northern with the
Southern system, and the work is now in
progress.


The line from Sydney to Parramatta was
opened for traffic on 26th September, 1855,
just twenty-five years after the opening of
the first Pailway in England—the line from
Liverpool to Manchester —on 16th September,
1830.
Particulars of Construction—Curves,
Gradients, &c. —The standard gauge of 4
feet 84 inches has been adopted in New
South Wales, which gives the Colony great
advantages in ordering rolling stock from
England and America, facilitating the intro-
duction of the most approved types of engines
and carriages, an advantage that has been
overlooked by the other Australian Colonies.
The mixed gauges are already causing con-
siderable inconvenience on the Victorian
border and this inconvenience will be in-
creased when the systems of New South
Wales, Queensland, and South Australia,
meet in the north and far west.
With the following exceptions the whole
of the Railways in New South Wales are single
lines and are worked on the staff and ticket
system. The line from Sydney to Penrith
(34 miles); the line from Sydney to Hurst-
ville (9 miles); from Newcastle to Maitland
(20 miles); and the Bullock Island Branch
(11 mile). Also the length between the
bottom of the Lithgow Zigzag to Bowenfels
(4 miles), on the Western Line. Four lines
of rails are being laid between Redfern and
Eveleigh, necessitating the widening of the
Redfern tunnel.
The rails on the lines from Sydney to
Goulburn and Bathurst, and from Newcastle
to Murrurundi, are of wrought iron, double-
headed and fish-jointed, weighing 75 lbs. per
yard. The chairs are 25 lbs. each, and are
secured to the sleepers with wrought-iron
spikes. , Beyond these stations the rails are
single-headed and fish-jointed, weighing 70 lbs.
to the yard, and are secured to the sleepers
by spikes and screws alternately. Steel
rails have been used in all the more recent
extensions and are also used when renewals
become necessary on the older lines; in fact
the lines over the mountains have been almost
entirely relaid with steel rails of the same
section as the original iron ones. A rail of
55 lbs. per yard was laid on the Richmond
Branch, but it is being superseded by 70 lbs.
single-headed steel rails.
The lines between Sydney and Picton, and
Parramatta and Penrith, are comparatively
level, the steepest incline being 1 in 66 and
the sharpest curve having a radius of 30
chains.
The extensions from Dubbo to Bomkc,
and Junee to Hay are remarkable for the
great lengths of straight and the absence of
steep grades ; but in crossing the dividing
range on all the main lines steep grades and
sharp curves have had to be very largely
used, grades of 1 in 30 and 1 in 33 and
curves of radius as small as 8 chains having
been freely adopted.
The Great Northern Railway as far as
Singleton like the Suburban Railway is com-
paratively level the steepest grade being 1
in 63 and the sharpest curve 30 chains radius;
beyond Singleton the country is more difficult
and in ascending the Liverpool ranges grades
of 1 in 33 and curves of 12 chains radius
have been found necessary.
Capital expended. —The total capital
expended on lines open to 31st December,
1884, was £20,088,240, upon which the
net returns will pay at the rate of 4'20
per cent, per annum. The expenditure on
lines open and in course of construction
was £22,053,226. The cost of construc-
tion per mile of line at the end of 1884
was £10,559, or including rolling stock,
&c., £12,412. This will appear moderate
when the difficulty of the country, the
amount paid for compensation for land, the
high rates of labour, and the heavy nature
of many of the works are taken into con-
sideration. Thus, on the Southern line there
are the wrought-iron girder bridge over the
Nepean at Menangle, the bridge over the
Murrumbidgee at Wagga Wagga, the costly
viaducts at Picton, Wingecarribee, Wollon-
dilly,Mulwarree, Barber’s and Boxer’s Creeks,
and the expensive tunnels at Redbank Range
and Gibraltar Gap ; on the Western line—
the bridges over the Nepean at Penrith; the
viaducts at Knapsack Gully and Lithgow


Yalley, the Clarence tunnel, and the tunnels
at Lithgow Yalley Zigzag, Morangaroo, and
under the Mudgee Road, and the bridges
over Solitary Creek at Tarana, over the
Macquarie River at Bathurst, Wellington,
and Dubbo; on the Northern line—the
handsome bridges over the Hunter at Single-
ton and Aberdeen, the bridge over the Mac-
donald, and the tunnels through the Liver-
pool and Moonbi Ranges.
Summit elevations. —The summit eleva-
tions above high-water-mark at Sydney on
the different lines are 2,357 feet on the
Southern, 3,658 feet on the Western, and
4,525 feet on the Northern.
Zigzags at Emu Plains and Lithgow
Valley . —The principal objects of interest on
our Railways are the Zigzags at Emu Plains
and Lithgow Yalley on the Western line.
Since the opening of the line to Bowenfels
thousands of tourists from all lands have
visited these works, and expressed unbounded
admiration at the rugged grandeur of the
scenery, and the engineering skill and pluck
displayed in designing and constructing these
stupendous works, which are probably not
surpassed on any Railway in the world. But
a description or even an inspection of the
Lithgow Yalley Zigzag gives only an im-
perfect idea of the difficulties that had to be
encountered, and the vast amount of work
that had to be performed, before it was hewn
into its present shape. From the Clarence
Tunnel to the bottom of the valley there is
a descent of 470 feet, through a deep and
rugged ravine, where formerly there was
scarcely footing for the mountain goat, and
where the surveyor’s assistants had occasion-
ally to be suspended by ropes in the perform-
ance of their perilous duties; but human
skill and enterprise have opened a pathway
through these broken mountain ranges for
the railway train that now traverses the
sides of the mountain on a gradient of 1 in
42. In the execution of these works, two
gigantic masses of rock—the one estimated
to contain 40,000 and the other 45,000 tons
—had to be blasted \ and the contractor,
after calculating the cost, determined to call
in the aid of electricity for that purpose.
For the first mass tons of blasting powder
were employed, and the Superintendent of
Telegraphs (Mr. E. C. Cracknell) succeeded
in firing the blast, which tore the mountain
asunder, heaving huge masses of rock into
the valley, and leaving the face of the parent
mountain almost as smooth as if it had been
cut with chisels. The removal of the second
mass—the blowing up of a tunnel —for which
3J tons of powder were used, was successfully
accomplished also by galvanic agency; the
electric spark having been communicated to
the powder by the hand of the Countess of
Belmore, in the presence of His Excellency
the Governor, and a large concourse of spec-
tators who had assembled to witness the
effects of the explosion.
Statistical andDescriptive. —The follow-
ing statistical and descriptive information will
be read with interest. It forms the summary
of the transactions for the year 1885, and is
taken from the Report of the Commissioner
for Railways, Charles A. Goodchap, Esq. Mr.
Goodchap reports that: “ The expenditure for
construction on lines open was £21,831,276.
At the end of December, 1885, 1,732 miles of
line were open for traffic, and 407 miles were in
the course of construction, while an additional
1,282 miles have been authorized. The rolling
stock at the end of 1885 consisted of 390
locomotives, 856 coaching and 7,968 goods
vehicles. The number of employes was 9,933
and the wages paid £1,020,873. The value
of the railway materials, in the conveyance
of which 165 vessels were employed, amounted
to £591,740. During the year 1885, 158,002
trains were run a distance of 6,638,399 miles.
The earnings amounted to £2,174,368, and
the working expenditure to £1,458,153, or
67"06 per cent, of the earnings. The number
of passengers who travelled was 13,506,346,
of whom 2,435,204 were first class and
6,033,348 were second class, and 5,037,794
season-ticket holders. The merchandise traffic
consisted of 2,120,955 head of live stock,
361,118 bales of wool, 1,996,547 tons of
coal, and 1,139,724 tons of general goods.
The average earnings per mile open were
£1,307 ; the average expenditure was £877 ;
the net earnings were £716,215.

and authentic Tabular Yiew r of the Pro-
gressive Utility and Financial Condition of
the Railways of New South Wales, from the
opening of the trunk line to Parramatta in
1855 to 31st December, 1885, will be appre-
ciated by all thoughtful readers.
This Tabular View shows that the expen-
diture for the construction of our Railways
is a wise and profitable investment of the
public funds on reproductive works, which
yield a direct return on the capital expended
while confering on the Colony indirect benefits
which cannot be estimated in money.
It is to be regretted that the result of the
transactions for 1885 does not compare favour-
ably with that of 1884 and previous years;
but, as briefly explained by the Commissioner
for Railways, the causes may be said to be—
(first) the larger capital brought into account,
owing to the great extensions of the Railway
systems that have taken place during the last
few years, and (second) the very disastrous
nature of the season all over the Colony.
The tendency of Railway extension is to
reduce the price of commodities to the con-
sumer and enhance the value of land; to
stimulate production, by widening the area
within which agricultural and garden produce
and animal and vegetable substances can be
brought to market; to accelerate the develop-
ment of our own resources, and by rapid and
constant intercommunication and interchange
of commodities with our neighbours, to extend
and strengthen our commercial relations, to
cement the bond of union between the
Australian Colonies, and to advance the
general prosperity of the country at large.*

II.—ANALYSIS OF RAILWAY ROUTES-MAIN AND SUBSIDIARY BRANCHES, WITH
STATIONS AND PLATFORMS.
Railway System in New South Wales.
—The Railway system of New South Wales
consists of three trunk lines at present,
one of which is unconnected with the other
two: (1) The Great Southern line; (2)
the Great Western line ; and (3) the Great
Northern line. The Southern line starts
from Sydney, and has, as a trunk line, a
southerly direction from Granville; up to
which station it runs in common with the
Western. The Western line also starts from
Sydney, but diverges from the Southern line
at Granville (13 miles distant from Sydney).
The Northern line starts from Newcastle, and
has its terminus at present at Glen Innes.
(1) Taking the Western line first, it may
thus be briefly described :
The Western line (by a north-westerly
turn) passes through Parramatta, and has,
for the most part, a westerly direction till it
comes to Bathurst, 145 miles from Sydney.
Its general direction is then north-westerly
until it reaches Orange, 47 miles further.
Thence the course of this line is due north to
Wellington, and from Wellington north-west
to Bourke. On the Western line there are,
including the termini at Bourke and at
Sydney,* eighty-two stations, and other occa-
sional stopping places, for the distance of
503 miles. At the Blacktown Junction the
Black town to Richmond branch joins the
Western line. This subsidiary branch, 16
miles in length, has a north-westerly direc-
tion from Blacktown, and has four distinct
stations, and one platform or stopping-place.
There is a second branch line from Wallera-
wang Station to Mudgee (85 miles). This
branch takes a north-westerly direction from
Wallerawang, and a third , recently opened,
the Molong branch, running from Orange to
* That is, taking in the trunk line from Sydney
to Parramatta Junction, common to both the
Western and Southern Lines.
Molong, a distance of 24 miles. Beside
these branch lines there are tramAvays that
feed the line at intervals —with road metal
at Emu Plains, shale at Hartley Yale siding,
and with coal at Eithgow and Ivatoomba.
(2.) The Southern line has for about
100 miles (from Parramatta Junction to the
neighbourhood of Marulan) a south-south-
westerly direction. From Marulan to the
station at Bethungra (about 154 miles) the
general direction of this line is, for the most
part, westerly, with a marked southerly
deflection, first for Yass, and finally towards
Albury on the Murray. An important
branch, called the South-western line, starts
from Junee on the Great Southern line, and
thence runs to Hay, one of the most important
towns in Eiverina. The distance from Junee
to Hay is 167 miles, and from Sydney to
Hay 455. In addition there is a branch
from the South-western line, running from
Narrandra to Jerilderie, 65 miles. There are
also three other branch lines, one running
from Goulburn to Bungendore, 43 miles,
being portion of the line to Cooma, a line
from Murrumburrah to Young being its first
section of the line now under construction
to connect the Southern and Western systems,
and a line from Cootamundra to Gundagai.
On the Southern and South-western line there
are 116* stations, and other occasional stop-
ping-places.
(3.) The Great Northern line (the eastern
terminus of which is at Newcastle, about
60 miles north of Sydney Heads) has, for the
most part, a north-westerly direction, with a
south-westerly deflection between West Mait-
land and Muswellbrook. Its extreme length
from Newcastle to Glen Innes, the present
terminus, is 323 miles. On this Northern
line there are —including the termini at Glen
* Including the Suburban line.


Innes and at Newcastle—sixty-one stations
and other occasional stopping-places for the
extreme distance traversed. On this line
there is one main branch—the North-
western—starting from Werris Creek, and
terminating at Narrabri, a distance of 97
miles. This branch has eight stopping-places.
There are also three subsidiary branches :
First , one from Newcastle to Bullock Island,
vid Honeysuckle Point, to the northward,
fi mile; second, one from Newcastle to
Wallsend, on the southern side of the line ;
and third, one from East Maitland to
Morpeth, on the north side of the line, 4
miles. (1.) The first subsidiary line is near
Newcastle, and is used for mineral traffic.
(2.) The second subsidiary branch (Wallsend
Junction), running south-westerly, commences
11 mile west of the Waratah Station, and is
in length 4| miles. The Wallsend branch is
principally used for mineral traffic. (3.) The
third subsidiary branch is the Maitland and
Morpeth branch, which runs from East Mait-
land to Morpeth (north-easterly) 4 miles.
The Railways of the Colony, with one
exception, are owned by the State ; the only
private line in operation is that running
from Deniliquin in the Riverina district to
the town of Moama, on the banks of the
Murray, where it connects with a branch of
the Victorian Railways. This line which
since its inception has been very successful
is laid on the same gauge as the Victorian
system, viz., 5 feet 3 inches. The Govern-
ment Railways are laid to the standard gauge
of 4 feet 8| inches. It is to be regretted
that at the commencement of their Railway
history the adjoining Colonies of New South
Wales and Victoria should have adopted
different gauges ; the inconvenience that this
entails has been practically demonstrated
since the Railway systems were connected
on the banks of the Murray, at Albury, a
transfer of the traffic between the Colonies
being necessary at this junction.
Further inconvenience will be felt very
shortly when the Queensland and New South
Wales Railways will be connected, the
Queensland lines throughout being laid to
the narrow gauge of 3 feet 6 inches, and con-
sequently it will be necessary to have a
changing station at the border of the two
Colonies, and transfer all passengers and
goods.
In addition to the Railway lines open,
which will be fully described, the following
brief particulars will be found interesting
respecting the extensions which are now
(June, 1886) in progress.
Starting from Sydney, the first extension
met with is that from Sydney to the Illawarra
district. The first section is open, while the
remaining portion is under construction ; but
it will be some time before the whole line is
completed. From Homebush the line starts
which is to connect the Southern with the
Northern system at Waratah ; the distance
between the two places is 93 miles, which
is under construction. On this extension
the most extensive bridges in the Colony,
viz., across the river Hawkesbury, will re-
quire to be constructed. The sinking for
the cylinders is said to be the deepest in the
world for bridge work.
On the Southern line the first section (40
miles) of the extension from Goulburn to
Cooma is open, while the remaining portion
is under construction.
The first section of the extension to connect
the Southern and Western Railways, from
Harden to Young, 18 miles, is open; the
remainder is under construction.
The Northern line is being actively pushed
forward from Glen Innes to Tenterfield, 58
miles, and should be ready for opening at
the end of the year.
The above complete analysis of the Railway
system of New South Wales, as it at present
exists, may be illustrated (and will perhaps
be rendered more easily understood) by a
perusal of the Tabular View in pages follow-
ing.






ROUTES.
ROUTES ON THE WESTERN LINE.
Route No. I.—From Sydney to Bath-
urst : 145 miles. —ln this route, as on all
others, remember to be at the station from
which you intend to start (especially should
it be the Sydney terminus) in ample time,
more particularly if you are not alone or have
any luggage. Take the morning train if you
wish to see the varied scenery along the line
on the Blue Mountains* and particularly
that of the First Zigzag near Emu Plains,
and the Great Zigzag near Lithgow. Dine
at Mount Victoria refreshment-rooms. The
whole journey occupies about eight hours.
Route No. 2—From Sydney to Orange:
192 miles.. —Follow directions for Route No.
1, except that you should also take a hasty
“ tea ” at the refreshment-room at Bathurst,
and come provided with a rug to sleep in
between Bathurst and Orange. At Orange
there are several excellent hotels. Omnibuses
at the Orange station will convey you and
your luggage to any of the principal hotels.
Probable time for your journey by this route,
about ten hours.
Route No. 3—From Sydney to Law-
son (formerly Blue Mountain) Station:
58 miles. —You can go by the morning or
evening train to the “Blue Mountains.” A
fine prospect is visible from the station itself;
and there is diversified and beautiful scenery
* The “Blue Mountains” were first crossed by
Europeans in May, 1813, by an adventurous party
consisting of “Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William
Wentworth, and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by
four servants, five dogs, and four horses laden with
provisions, ammunition, and other necessaries.”
They appear to have crossed pretty near the present
line of the railroad, previous ineffectual attempts
having been made much further to the southward.
They got back again to the Nepean on the 6th of
June, having apparently got past the Blue Moun-
tains as far as some of the plains beyond.—See
Journal of a Tour of Discovery, &c., in the year
1813. [The William Wentworth here mentioned
afterwards became the celebrated Australian states-
man.]
on both sides of the line, within 2 miles
distance either way. On the north side are
Dante’s Glen and three waterfalls, each one
of a different character ; and on the south
are the Adelina Falls, the Junction Falls, and
other charming cascades. Excellent roads,
fit even for the restricted exercise of the sick
or aged, lead to the Adelina Falls and to
Dante’s Glen. Comfortable accommodation
can be obtained in the vicinity of the station.
If the time of the visitor be limited he can
make this place his head-quarters, and supple-
ment his excursions by a flying visit to
“Wentworth Falls," 4 miles further on.—
Time of journey by this route, three hours
and a half.
Route No. 4 —From Sydney to Went-
worth Falls (formerly called the Wea-
therboard Platform) : 62 miles. —Should
you desire to go from Sydney direct to the
“Weatherboard Gorge and the Campbell
Cataract”—a grand piece of scenery of
wondrous wildness and unrivalled beauty—
you will have your choice of two plans :
either stop at the accommodation house at
the “Weatherboard,” going up by the after-
noon train, or you can take the ordinary day
train leaving Sydney at 9 a.m., or the special
on Saturdays at 7 a.m., and if your time is
limited return the same day; if not, the
traveller can pick up a subsequent train, and
journey to other points of interest which are
further described. The hotel (Wilson’s) stands
close to where the train stops, and on the
southern side of the line. Having slept there
that night, you can, without fatigue, visit the
Weatherboard Gorge and Cataract early on
the following morning, and if time allows,
you may also visit “The Water Nymph’s
Dell,” on the north side of the line. Both
of these places are within comparatively a
short distance of the accommodation house,
where for a few pence the services of a youth-
ful guide can be secured. You can go back
to Sydney by the “up” train from Bathurst


and Orange, which passes the platform at
Wentworth Falls at an early hour in the after-
noon. You may thus be back in Sydney at
6 p.m., and congratulate yourself upon having
had a short, pleasant, and inexpensive trip.
By starting on a Friday evening, or on a Satur-
day, you can get a return ticket at a reduced
rate, available until the Monday for return.—
Time of journey, rather less than four hours.
Route No. s—From Sydney to Black-
heath (be. “ Govett’s Leap”): 73 miles.—
If you should desire to pay a hasty visit to
the lovely and stupendous gorge and waterfall
usually known by the curiously inexpressive
name of “Govett’s Leap” (and you do not
particularly care whether you see any other
spot on the occasion or not), take your place
in the train for Blackheath. There are several
accommodation houses here. Govett’s Leap
is situated about 1 mile from the line, on
the north side ; an easy walk, and an easy
way to find. Three passenger trains for
Sydney pass Blackheath daily. If you find
yourself comfortable at Blackheath, and time
permits, you can ride, drive, or walk thence
to Mount Victoria and back, so as to see the
numerous breaks of scenery to the southward
—away over the Ounimbla Valley—to the
greatest advantage. But you will find it too
far to visit the Hartley Vale from this stand-
point. —Time of journey from Sydney to
Blackheath, about four hours and a half.
Rouvc„ No. 6—Sydney to Katoomba.—
A short time ago Katoomba was known to
the general railway travellers as an unim-
portant platform; a few, however, were aware
of the glorious views that were found in
the neighbourhood, and occasionally tourists
would come here and make their way to the
waterfalls and dells. Subsequently a few
houses were started, and now as if by magic a
township has sprung into existence. A coal-
mine and saw-mill are worked, and the place
is becoming one of the most important on the
mountains. The traveller can leave town by
any of the Western trains, and after a journey
of about four hours reach Katoomba, where
excellent accommodation may be obtained.
One of the largest hotels in the Colony—the
“Great Western” (now “ Carrington”)—has
been opened here.
Route No. 7—From Sydney to Mount
Victoria: 77 miles. —Everything is clear
before you in this route, according to the
station lists in the Time-tables, until you
arrive at your destination. Mount Victoria
will be for you a good head-quarters, from
which Govett’s Leap, at Blackheath, may
conveniently be visited, either by driving in
a buggy, by walking, or by taking advantage
of the train. The distance from Mount
Victoria to Blackheath is only 4 miles by
road or rail. Near Mount Victoria there is
much beautiful and attractive scenery. The
air, being very bracing and remarkably
pleasant, is much recommended for invalids.
In the immediate neighbourhood of Mount
Victoria are found the Fairy Hell, the
Engineer’s Waterfall, the Little Zigzag (over-
looking the northern part of the Cunimbla
Valley), Mount Piddington, Mount Pidding-
ton’s Waterfall and Dell, and many other
picturesque spots. From the back of Mrs.
Perry’s hotel, past the Protestant Church,
the old road will take you down into the
romantic and secluded vale of Hartley, the
peculiar scenery of which will well repay a
visit. There is at Hartley, near the two
churches, a decent old-fashioned wayside inn,
kept by Mrs. Evans. The little town, or
rather village, of Hartley, on the borders of
the river Lett (a tributary of Cox’s River),
is quaint and pretty; and, from the bridge
over the stream of the brawling Lett, an
excellently kept road winds north-westerly
up the valley towards Bowenfels—passing
on its way under boldly defined and truly
majestic rocks, known as “ Hassan’s Walls.”
Mount Victoria has a number of good hotels,
one of which is very large and handsome,
called “The Imperial.” If you make Mount
Victoria your head-quarters—as many do—a
day can be set apart for visiting the Weather-
board Gorge and Campbell Cataract, Black-
heath, or Katoomba. Excursions are also
frequently made from Mount Victoria to the
Fish River Caves, the distance being about
30 miles.
Route No. B—From Sydney to Lith-
gow and Bowenfels : 96-97 miles.—
Starting from the Sydney terminus, you can
reach the busy, rising town of Lithgow in
six hours ; the train crossing between Mount


Victoria and Lithgow, the highest point
reached by the Western Railway the
Clarence Tunnel—and the celebrated Lithgow
Zigzag. From Lithgow you can make a plea-
sant 10 miles’ excursion by going right round
the mountain to the westward and south-west-
ward—where (thanks to Mr. Henry Cam-
bridge, the road surveyor, and the energy
and forethought of the Public Works De-
partment) an excellently kept road, past
Hassan’s Walls, will bring you down the
valley to Hartley. Or you can go down to
Hartley by a shorter way (about 6 miles)
right over “ Brown’s Gap ” behind the
easternmost end of Lithgow, up Clyde
Valley. From the last road (a very clever
piece of practical engineering by Mr. Cam-
bridge) there is a grand prospect to the
southward, just as you come down into the
valley from the Gap, There are a number
of hotels at Lithgow where accommodation
may be obtained.
Note. Weekly Tourists’ Trains.—
Once a week opportunities occur for conveni-
ently visiting Lithgow and Bowenfels by the
tourists’ trains, which leave Sydney for
Bathurst on Saturdays at 7 a.m., and return
to the Sydney terminus on the following
Monday morning. This weekly tourists’
train is run at very cheap rates : Ist class 2d.
and 2nd class Id. per mile return, and will
enable persons from the Sydney side to visit
either “ Blue Mountains” (Lawson), the
Weatherboard, Blackheath (Govett’s Leap),
Mount Victoria, or Lithgow.
[The above will, it is believed, be found to
be the principal routes for tourists, from
Sydney downwards, on the Main Branch
Western Line. Others may possibly be
suggested, when the different stations and
stopping-places shall, in their respective places
come to be particularized.]
ROUTES ON THE SOUTHERN LINE.
Route No. 9—From Sydney to Goul-
burn : 134 miles. —ln this route, as on all
others, be sure that you are at the station
from which you intend to start (especially
should it be the Sydney terminus) a full
quarter of an hour before the train is to
leave; more particularly so if you are not
alone or have any luggage. Take the
morning train if you wish to enjoy the
varied scenery along the line. You will
be able to dine at Mittagong, which you
will reach about four hours after your train
leaves the Sydney terminus. There is also
a good refreshment room at Goulburn. Be
sure that you get into a carriage that is going
to Goulburn, or to some other place on the
Southern line ; otherwise, you will have
to look out (sharply) at Granville, and
change into a carriage going South. The
guards—uniformly a civil, trustworthy, and
respectable class of men—always warn the
passengers of every necessary change, and
occasional stopping-place ; but passengers
(especially ladies) are often inattentive,
and get “ carried on” in consequence—to
the annoyance of themselves, and the vex-
ation and worry of everybody else. Goul-
burn (a fine, thriving, inland city, the capital
of the south-west, with plenty of good hotel
accommodation) is a healthy and pleasant
place, and one of the prettiest towns in the
Colony. It is the centre of a wealthy and
important district, and lies on the border of
rich and extensive plains.—Time of journey
from Sydney to Goulburn, six hours.
Route No. 10—From Sydney to Gun-
ning : 165 miles. —Follow directions for
Route No. 9. Change your carriage at
Granville for one going on the Southern
line, if you have not (more wisely) got into
your right carriage at the Sydney terminus.
Dine at the refreshment-rooms at Mittagong
or Goulburn. The district of Gunning is
agricultural and pastoral; the country sur-
rounding the town being mountainous, with
undulating plains. Probable time of journey,
seven hours.


Route No. 11—From Sydney to Camp-
bell! own : 34 miles. —A cheap and quiet
but delightful jaunt may be improvised by
any tourist from Sydney to Campbelltown,
on the Southern line—distant from the
Sydney terminus only 34 miles. There are
numerous hotels at Campbelltown. it is one
of the oldest towns in the Colony, and is
situated in a hilly, well cleared, agricultural
district, celebrated for the salubrity of its
climate. The scenery round Campbelltown is
very pretty, especially in the spring and early
summer. From it there are many agreeable
rides and drives, in all directions. The
roads to Camden and to Appin wind, each of
them, through many charming bits of rural
scenery, now, by the general public, neglected
and well-nigh forgotten. A tramway has
also been constructed from Campbelltown to
Camden, 8 miles. The tram runs in con-
junction with the Railway, meeting all
passenger trains. Nine miles to the north-
westward, near Camden (where, in a com-
manding situation, there is a magnificent
Anglican church, built by the MacArthur
Family), the country will be found highly
cultivated, undulating, and extremely pleas-
ing. There is good hotel accommodation at
Camden. The district adjacent to Camden is
occupied by graziers and agriculturists; and
there are also, round it, many dairy farms.
Close to that township there is a fine bridge
over the Nepean. At Appin, 9 or 10 miles
from Campbelltown, in an opposite direction,
on the Illawarra Road, there are two hotels.
Near this secluded village will be found
much curious river scenery, and (a few
miles south from its two churches) a
singularly wild and rocky pass, adjoining
to which is a deep stream with a dangerous
ford. The water supply for Sydney is to be
drawn from this locality, and the extensive
works are now in progress. Time of journey
to Campbelltown from Sydney, rather better
than one hour and a half.
Route No.l2—From Sydneyto Menan-
gle : 40 miles. —(See Route No. 9.) —
This is a station on the Southern Line, G
miles further than Campbelltown. It has
some characteristic park-like scenery, the
country being more open than usual in this
part of the Colony. Menangle is much
visited by Sydney excursionists, and deserves
its popularity. Cultivation and grazing farms
on a limited flat and fertile area. You can
go to Menangle from the Sydney terminus in
a very short time, and return in the evening.
The surrounding country is elevated, and
undulates to the foot of the mountain range.
The steep ridge known as “ Pmzorback” lies
about 3 miles to the westward. The loftiest
peak in the neighbourhood is Mount Hunter.
Time of journey from Sydney to Menangle,
nearly two hours.
Route No. 13 —From Sydney to Pic-
ton : 53 miles. —You can reach Picton by
the train from the Sydney terminus by a
short and pleasant trip. If you require a
cheerful rest and a reviving repose for a few
days, you may secure what you want by a rail-
way trip to this picturesque village, formerly
known as “ Stonequarry.” There are three
hotels here suitable for visitors. The viaduct
over the Stonequarry River is a grand piece
of masonry. The scenery at Picton chiefly
consists of precipitous hills, grassy glades, and
straggling woods. A ramble down the winding
rock-enclosed course of the “ Stonequarry”
has delighted and astonished many an artist
and man of cultivated taste. Near this little
township the train passes through the Gibraltar
tunnel, 572 yards in length. This tunnel is
the longest in the Colony. Time of journey
from Sydney to Picton, two hours and a half.
Route No. 14—From Sydney to Mitta-
gong : 77 miles. —(See Route No. 8.) —
You can reach Mittagong from the Sydney
terminus after a comparatively short and
agreeable trajet. Grand and impressive views
in tins neighbourhood, at the Gibraltar Pass,
and pleasing scenery at Bowral and at Bong
Bong. Near Bowral (a thriving township
with a station 3 miles from Mittagong) there
is a long and admirably constructed tunnel.
Between Bowral and Moss Yale a platform
has been established and denominated Bur-
radoo. The district around is extremely
fertile and pretty, and as it lies 2,168 feet
above sea-level, the air is pure and bracing.
This place is much resorted to by families
seeking change of air. Time of journey from
Sydney to Mittagong, about three hours and
a half.


Route No. 15—From Sydney to Moss
Vale : 86 miles. —(See Route No. 9.) —The
Sydney tourist to Moss Yale had better take
his wayside refreshment at the Mittagong
station, and secure such hotel accommodation
as he may require here on his arrival. Moss
Yale is considered to be one of the prettiest
districts in the Colony. The country around
is undulating, very fertile, and has the
appearance of an immense English park.
Here a country seat has been secured for the
Governor of the Colony, and in the vicinity
are found the country seats of many influen-
tial gentlemen. Good accommodation can be
secured either at Moss Yale or at the township
of Sutton Forest, 3 miles out. Moss Yale, on
account of its climate, is very much resorted
to by invalids, while those in search of the
picturesque will be satisfied by the views of
glen and waterfall that are to be seen with-
in easy distance of the station. Sportsmen
also may, by journeying some little distance
away, get a splendid day’s shooting after either
the marsupials or after the feathered game
that is found in the district. Time of journey
from Sydney, rather better than five hours.
Route No. 16—From Sydney to Bun-
gendore : 174 miles. —The recent opening
of the Railway to Tarago and Bungendore
has opened up a unique and delightful district
to the people of Sydney and the Colony.
The principal want in the matter of scenery
inland is the varied charm that is imparted
to a landscape by the presence of water either
in the form of lakes or picturesque views, but
in one district this want has been supplied
by the splendid sheets of water, known as
Lakes Bathurst and George, which are more
fully described in the itinerary. Trains run
daily from the metropolis to the stations
named, and the locality is one of much beauty
and fertility, the land in the vicinity of
the lakes sloping gracefully to meet their
waters, the lakes being also often thick with
flocks of wild fowl and abound with fish. In
addition to the enjoyment that is derived in
viewing the delightful scenery about the
lakes and from boating, fishing, and shooting
on its waters, the district possesses a splendid
climate and will no doubt attract, as facilities
are offered, thousands of visitors in search of
health, sport, and change of scene.
Note.—Weekly Tourists’ Trains.—
Once a week opportunities occur for con-
veniently visiting Campbelltown, Menangle,
Mittagong, Bowral, Moss Yale, at cheap fares,
by the Tourists’ Trains, which leave Sydney
for Goulburn on Saturdays at B‘3o a.m., and
return to Sydney terminus on the following
Monday morning, at a convenient hour.
This train will enable persons from Sydney
to visit either of the five above-mentioned
places; but the excursionist should wisely
elect before hand as to which of those places
he will stop at, until the return of this train
to Sydney.
[The above will, it is believed, be found to
be the principal routes for tourists from
Sydney downwards, on the Main Branch
Southern Line. Others may possibly be
suggested when the different stations and
stopping-places shall, in their regular and
consecutive order, come to be particularized.]


Lake George.


ROUTES ON THE SYDNEY TO RICHMOND SUBSIDIARY LINE.
(Connected with the Western Line.)
Route No. 17—From Sydney to The
Hawkesbury, Wiseman’s Ferry, and the
Macdonald River, via Windsor: 100
miles. —lf the Sydney tourist wishes to visit
the Hawkesbury* and the Macdonald Rivers,
at a small expenditure of time and money,
he had better get a railway ticket to Windsor
at the Sydney terminus some afternoon—say
on a Saturday—and ho may then, about
two hours afterwards, find himself in the
pleasant old town of Windsor, elsewhere
described. Three miles from the Windsor
Station stands Pitt Town, to the vicinity of
which the tourist may either walk or go by an
omnibus. From that point on the Hawkes-
bury, so reached, a steamer starts. If the
excursionist, avoiding the numerous sinu-
* The Hawkesbury (Deerubbum) is remarkable for
its singularly tortuous course. Its basin has three
distinct slopes in the eastern watershed—a southern,
eastern, and western. The main stream comes from
the southern slope, and is first called The Wollon-
dilly. It successively receives the Mulwarree, the
Cookbundoon, the Wingecarribee, the Guinecor
Creek, and the Nattai and Cox Rivers, and is then
called The Warragamba. When the Cowpasture
River has next contributed its waters the river
becomes known as The Nepean, a name which it
bears until its junction with the Grose, which flows
down into the main river through a cleft in the
Blue Mountains. The river so constituted is, from
that point, known as The Haivlcesbury, a name first
bestowed in order of time on this stream of many
aliases. After receiving the South Creek at
Windsor, and then the Colo and the Macdonald
Rivers, the Mangrove Creek and other minor
streams next become its tributaries ; the Hawkes-
bury finally discharging itself in the Pacific, at
Broken Bay. The entire length of the Hawkesbury
is generally estimated at 330 miles (130 miles longer
than the river Severn, in Great Britain), and it
drains a much disconnected area of about 9,000
miles. Owing to the immense area drained by the
Hawkesbury, and the flatness of the country in the
lower portion of its stream (but chiefly, perhaps, in
consequence of the confined and winding channel
below Windsor, through which the enormous
volume of accumulated waters cannot always with
sufficient velocity be discharged), the lower course
of this river is liable to sudden and dangerous floods.
The Hawkesbury received its name from the first
Governor of this Colony, Captain A. Phillip, R.N.,
in honour of Lord Hawkesbury.
osities of the Hawkesbury, prefers to walk
(or ride) along the road to Wiseman’s Ferry,
he will find his line of transit about half
the distance—from 24 to 25 miles only.
The scenery, both on the river and on the
road to the east of it, is, for the most part,
extremely interesting; but the best way to
see the Hawkesbury is, of course, to see it
from the river itself. Portland Head and
Sackville Reach are much admired; but all
along the banks of the Hawkesbury, from
Windsor to Wiseman’s Ferry, the frequent
farms and flourishing homesteads give a
cheerful British air to the ever changing
scene. A little way off the road the- travel-
ler by land—at a place known as “ Stone
Chimney,” about half way—will find an
excellent stream of water. The “ Maroota”
road, on which he journeys, having been
joined by the Great Northern Road, crosses
the Hawkesbury near its celebrated com
fluence with the Macdonald, at a place called
Wiseman’s Ferry. From the “Ferry” the
Northern Road stretches away northerly,
through a wild and desolate country, to Woh
lombi. Two miles before reaching the
Hawkesbury the traveller, by land, has to
keep along a lofty ridge, which, descending
abruptly to the river, discloses a most enchant-
ing prospect. The Hawkesbury, about a
quarter of a mile wide here, sweeps round in
a semicircle; its calm, deep, lake-like expanse
being enclosed on all sides by forest-clad,
precipitous hills. At Wiseman’s Ferry the
traveller—whether he arrives by the road or
in the little steamer—will find cleared land,
an inn, a school-house, and an old ruined
church. The entrance to the Macdonald
River is about a mile or so below this pic-
turesque but decayed township. The still
waters of the little known Macdonald are
navigable by small craft up to the wharf near
St. Alban’s, about 12 miles from the Hawkes-
bury. The adjacent levels and banks of the
Macdonald are remarkably fertile and beauti-
ful. St. Alban’s—-the only township in the
valley of the Macdonald—is secluded and


picturesque. The houses are built on the
sides of the hills surrounding this quaint
little town, in which will be found a stone
church, stores, a smithy, and a comfortable
inn, known as “ The Settlers’ Arms.” From
this convenient stand-point an adventurous
tourist might, after crossing the “ Ferry,” pay
a visit (via Snodgrass Valley) to the “ Man-
grove,” in the Brisbane Water district. From
the Sydney terminus to Windsor the distance
by rail is 34 miles; from Windsor to Pitt
Town, where the steamer starts on her
riverine voyage, 3 miles; from Pitt Town to
Wiseman’s Ferry {by the windings of the
Hawkesbury) about 50 miles; from Wise-
man’s Ferry to the Wharf near St. Alban’s
(on the Macdonald), rather more than 12
miles. Total distance from Sydney (say) 100
miles. The steamer returns from St. Alban’s
to Pitt Town almost immediately after her
arrival. This route seems to suggest the
cheapest and most convenient way for any
family or party of friends to view the grand
and ever-changing scenery of the Vale of the
Hawkesbury and of that of the Macdonald.
The scenery on the Hawkesbury was much
admired by the celebrated novelist Anthony
Trollope, who considered that it compared
favourably with that of the Rhine. Excur-
sionists from Sydney and Parramatta can
easily reach Windsor by the train, and be
conveyed thence to where the steamer lies —
usually at Pitt Town. Excursionists for the
Hawkesbury may also leave Sydney by
steamer to Manly, then travel overland to
Newport, from whence steamers start at
intervals, and run up the Hawkesbury. The
visitor can then return to Sydney from
Windsor by rail. Time of journey (by rail)
from Sydney to Windsor, about two hours.
Route No. 18—From Sydney to the
Kurrajong Heights, &c., via Richmond ;
41 miles:— The Sydney tourist intending to
visit the Kurrajong Mountains (a north-
easterly off-shoot of the Blue Mountains com-
monly so-called) will do well to possess
himself of a ticket at the Sydney terminus
some fine afternoon, and taking his seat in a
railway carriage he will find himself, about
two hours and a half afterwards, in Rich-
mond, a very pretty little country town,
elsewhere described. At the Richmond
railway station he can readily hire a com-
modious car, in which he may —for a few
shillings—be whirled off, with all due expe-
dition, to one of the many comfortable
accommodation houses to be found near the
top of the Kurrajong, This car, after
leaving Richmond by the cutting near the
Anglican Church, passes over a wide, dreary,
alluvial flat, at the northern limit of which
flows the Hawkesbury River (just after the
junction of the Nepean with the Grose)
and here running easterly. Crossing the
river by an excellent bridge, the traveller
is first taken past the little hamlet of Enfield,
through some miles of an agreeable, undu-
lating country, with homesteads, orange
orchards, and farms; over Wheeney Creek,
past “ Lamrock’s,” and then up the steep
mountain side until he reaches his destina-
tion, Belmore Lodge, or wherever else it
may be that he is determined to go. The
ascent of the road after Wheeney Creek is so
sudden that the alteration of the atmosphere
to a more bracing and healthy climate
becomes very perceptible, and is, moreover,
strikingly evidenced by a concurrent change
in the vegetation. From the windows of his
bedroom on the following morning the tourist
will find himself looking down upon a broad
and partly wooded expanse of hill country,
on the misty plains beyond which the
Hawkesbury is, here and there, to be seen
winding along towards the Pacific. The
towns of Richmond, Windsor, Pitt Town,
Wilberforce, Castlereagh, and Penrith —are
more or less visible; and even the exact site
of the metropolis, with its wide-spread
suburbs and adjacent coast ridge, can be
traced (beyond the blue hills of Parramatta)
in the extreme distance. In fact nearly
the whole of the broad county of Cumber-
land—hemmed in towards the west and
south by far-off shadowy mountains—lies
before the enraptured view of the visitor to
the Kurrajong. At the back of Belmore
Lodge an abrupt ascent brings the visitor
to a well-known sylvan seat, whence the
prospect of the lower country can be seen
to the greatest advantage. On the summit
of the ridge a pretty sheltered path, trend-
ing easterly, leads through the woods to Mr.
Comrie’s residence, from the grounds of
which there is a grand view to the south


ward. When staying at the Kurrajong
the tourist should seize the opportunity of
visiting “the Yale of Avoca”; so called from
the “meeting of the waters” of the Grose
with those of a large mountain stream,
unnamed, flowing out of one of the many
wild ravines of the Kurrajong. The best
way to view this lovely landscape is to hire
a horse and guide on the Kurrajong, and so
to make a day of it. The tourist will first
have to descend the mountain as far as
Lamrock’s, and then to turn off and travel
for several miles in a westerly direction.
The Yale of Avoca should be approached
through a gum-tree forest, on a gradual
elevation from the southward, so that
nothing can be anticipated, and thus the
full grandeur and singular beauty of the
prospect allowed to burst suddenly upon you.
The Grose comes rapidly down its own
dreadful precipitous gorge to the left, and
the nameless stream hastening to meet it
rushes from the heavily wooded crags of the
Kurrajong, down before you from the right.
The last-mentioned stream sweeps onward
past the base of the rock on which the
spectator stands, and a mile or so away
unites with the Grose on its headlong course
to the Hawkesbury. In front, many hun-
dred feet below, a broad densely timbered
green peninsula—the colours softened by the
dizzy distance, as it rises from the water’s
edge into a gentle eminence—contrasts
agreeably with the more sombre outlines of
the rude dark cliffs and lofty, forest-clad
mountains on either side, forming the frame,
as it were, to this charming picture. “The
meeting of the waters” is deemed by all who
have seen it to be well deserving of its dis-
tinguished and poetic name. No tourist
should, if possible, omit to pay a visit to this
locality. There are many agreeable rides
and drives about on the Kurrajong, com-
manding a great variety of mountain and
forest scenery. Time of journey (by rail)
from Sydney to Richmond, about two hours
and twenty minutes.
ROUTES ON THE NORHTERN LINE.
Route No, 19—From Newcastle to
Tamworth : 182 miles. —The tourist who
leaves the Newcastle terminus for Tamworth
will in five hours and three-quarters reach
Murrurundi. If he starts by the first train
in the morning he had better take his break-
fast at Singleton, where there is a refresh-
ment-room, and where all passenger ti’ains
stop for fifteen minutes. If he takes his
departure from Newcastle by the 9 o’clock
morning train (passengers and goods) he may
conveniently dine at Singleton at U 35 p.m.,
before proceeding to Murrurundi —which he
will, in that case, reach at about 10 minutes
past 7in the evening. He will find Murru-
rundi a prosperous inland town, situated on
the Page River, which (conjoined with the
Isis) forms a western tributary to the Hunter.
Leaving Murrurundi he has then before him a
journey of 62 miles, and to pass eight stations
and stopping-places before he arrives at his
destination. The first of these is Temple
Court Platform, 1 mile from Murrurundi;
the second is Doughboy Hollow, a platform
B
5 miles further on; the third, Willow-tree
(or Warrah), a station 8 miles further; the
fourth, Braefield Platform, 6 miles further;
the fifth, Quirindi station, 4 miles further;
the sixth, Quipolly station, 6 miles further;
the seventh, Werris Creek station, 5 miles
further; the eighth, Currabubula station,
9 miles further, 18 miles beyond Curra-
bubula station Tamworth is situated. Of
these stations and stopping-places it may
here be remarked that Quirindi lies on the
northern slope of the Liverpool Range, 24
miles from Murrurundi, on the banks of the
Quirindi Creek, an eastern tributary of the
Namoi River. The line penetrating the
Liverpool Range arrives at Quirindi through
a well-formed tunnel 528 yards long, lined
with brickwork set in Portland cement.
Tamworth stands to the northward from
Quirindi, 38 miles; Breeza is a small town,
west of Quirindi, 25 miles; and Wallabadah,
a pastoral and agricultural settlement, is 16
miles away to the eastward. Time of journey
from Newcastle to Tamworth, eight hours.


Route No. 20—Newcastle to Glen
Innes : 323 miles. —Following the direc-
tions given in Route No. 19, the traveller
will after a journey of about nine hours from
Newcastle arrive at Tamworth. Leaving
Tamworth, the line passes through very
pretty scenery, running along the valley of
the Cockburn until Moonbi is reached. Here
the ascent of the Moonbi Range is com-
menced, and from this station onwards the
line runs almost on a continuous upward
grade, rising over 2,000 feet in 22 miles.
The scenery is wild and diversified through-
out, the mountains clothed with timber
rising bold and majestic on either side. The
Macdonald River, mileage 217, is crossed by
a substantial iron girder bridge. After a
journey of over twelve hours the traveller
arrives at Armidale, the capital and cathe-
dral city of the New England district. From
Armidale onward the line rapidly ascends
until it reaches the culminating point at Ben
Lomond, 4,525 feet above sea level, this
being the highest point that the rails are
laid in Australia. The districts passed
through are fertile, and largely devoted to
agricultural purposes, the climate and sur-
roundings almost leading one to imagine he
was back in England—thus leading to the
adoption of the title “The New England
District,” the produce and fruits common to
England growing here luxuriantly. Glen
Innes is a thriving town, and with the pros-
pect of the railways to Inverell and the Cla-
rence must become an important centre. It
is a clean-looking place, possessing many
good buildings, and the district offers many
advantages to those journeying for change of
air, pretty scenery, or health. It is, further,
an important mining centre, large quantities
of tin being forwarded from here to the sea-
board. Glen Innes is now the terminus of
the Great Northern Railway, but the ex-
tension is in progress to Tenterfield, while
approval has been given for the further
extension to the Queensland border.
Route No. 21—From Newcastle to
Murrurundi : 120 miles. —For directions
on leaving Newcastle for Murrurundi see
Route No. 19 as to dining at Singleton, &c.,
&c. Murrurundi—at an elevation of 1,546
fees above the sea-level—lies 192 miles north
of Sydney, at the foot of the Liverpool
Range, 94 miles distant from the nearest
portion of the coast from the Pacific. This
town, which has a population of 350 souls, is
the centre of an extensive and progressive
district, principally devoted to pastoral
pursuits, but endowed with a varied amount
of mineral wealth not yet fully developed.
The land is in many parts of an excellent
quality, and, year by year, as the population
becomes more numerous, agriculture also
becomes more general, and, what is better, is
found to pay well. The local newspaper is
the Murrurundi Times. There is much fine
scenery in this district, especially in the more
elevated portions of it, for the Liverpool
Range is a magnificent chain of mountains—
o O
from 3,000 to 4,000 (sometimes even as much
as 5,000) feet high—rising, at irregular inter-
vals, into lofty detached peaks, with rugged
cliffs, and traversed by deep precipitous gorges.
Some of these picturesque localities are heavily
timbered, and some are well nigh denuded of
vegetation. Murrurundi Gap is 2,314 feet
above the level of the sea. One of the
highest and most remarkable mountains near
Murrurundi is Mount Murrulla, 3 miles
e.e.s. of the township. Mount Murrulla,
like Mount Wingen, is rather connected with
the Liverpool Range than an actual part of
that chain, which runs across the country to
the north of both. Mount Wingen, 1,820
feet high, lying a few miles east of Mount
Murrulla, is perhaps better known as “The
Burning Mountain,” from the supposed acci-
dental ignition of a large coal seam beneath it.
The places of note near Murrurundi are as
follows :— Blackville, a pastoral settlement,
45 miles distant ; Blandford, another settle-
ment (agricultural as well as pastoral) on
Page River and Warland Greek, 3 miles
south of Murrurundi; and The Willow-tree
or Warrah, the well-known station of the
Australian Agricultural Company, 15 miles
distant from Murrurundi. Ilaydonton is a
suburb, now connected with Murrurundi
(since 1864) by the “ Arnold Bridge.” Timor,
on the river Isis, is a locality situated a
few miles to the eastward of Murrurundi,
and chiefly noticeable for its caves. “ They
present,” we are told, “a series of extensive
chambers, the floors of which are covered
with stalagmites, while stalactites of all ages


depend from the ceilings.” Time of journey
from Newcastle to Murrurundi, rather less
than six hours.
Route No. 22—From Newcastle to
Scone. 96 miles.— The tourist leaving
Newcastle by rail may, if he pleases, in less
than five hours find himself at Scone, having
en route had the option of breakfasting or
dining at Singleton, according to the train
by which he may have come “ down” the line.
(See directions for Route No. 19.) Scone is
rather a pretty little place, situated on the
banks of a stream oddly called the “ Kingdon
Ponds,” which, with the Darkbrook, forms a
western tributary of the Hunter, falling into
that river about 9 miles above the township
of Aberdeen. Scone, at an elevation of 680
feet above the sea-level, is reckoned to be
167 miles north of Sydney by the postal
route. It has a population of 600 souls.
It lies 7 miles west of Page River, and 7
miles north-west of the Hunter. The country
round Scone is mountainous, the adjacent
district being chiefly occupied for pastoral
purposes. Near the township is a plain,
on which are found quantities of fossil
wood, the rooted trunks of large fossil trees
standing in the ground, as if still in their
places of growth. Besides Aberdeen, above-
mentioned, the principal places near Scone
are Bunnan and Rouchelbrook. In the
mountains and highland glens near Scone
there is much wild and picturesque scenery.
A beautiful spot there, called “ Flat Rock,”
is spoken of as well deserving of a visit.
Time of journey from Newcastle to Scone,
four and three-quarter hours.
Route No. 23—From Newcastle to
Musclebrook : 80 miles. —(For directions
as to place of stopping for breakfast or dinner
on this journey see Route No. 19.) The
traveller by rail from Newcastle to Muscle-
brook (or Muswellbrook) arrives at his desti-
nation in about four hours after leaving the
Newcastle terminus. Musclebrook (475 feet
above the sea-level) lies on the margin of the
Musclebrook and the Hunter, that river
skirting the township on its western side.
It is, by postal route, 152 miles north of
Sydney, and contains about 1,100 inhabitants.
There is a very handsome Anglican Church
here, noteworthy as being one of the finest
ecclesiastical edifices at present erected in the
northern portion of the Colony. The visitor
should go and see it, especially the interior.
The country around Muswellbrook is favour-
able to the growth of wheat, maize, sugar’,
tobacco, and the vine. Denman is a small
town, lying 16 miles south of Musclebrook,
about 2 miles above the confluence of the
Goulburn and Hunter Rivers, on the main
road from Maitland to Merriwa, Cassilis, and
Mudgee. The other settlements in the neigh-
bourhood of Musclebrook are Goorangoola,
Grass-tree, Gungal, Kayuga, and Wybong.
Time of journey from Newcastle to Muscle-
brook, three hours.
Route No. 24—From Newcastle to
Singleton : 49 miles. —Singleton, the centre
of the rich and flourishing district of Patrick’s
Plains, is an agreeable, well-planned country
town, on the Hunter River, 123 miles
north of Sydney by the postal route. The
station is 135 feet above the sea-level. Here
there is a good refreshment-room, and trains
carrying passengers stop fifteen minutes.
Singleton is a wealthy, thriving place, with
comfortable inns, several churches, and other
handsome public edifices. The Court-house
is one of the finest buildings of the kind in
the Colony. The town (which has a good
local newspaper) contains nearly 2,000 inhabi-
tants. The district, in which Singleton holds
the chief place, has many advantages for
pastoral and agricultural pursuits. The vine
is largely cultivated, quantities of good wine
being produced ; copper, iron, freestone, and
limestone are found in the adjacent country.
Jerry’s Plains is a township on the Hunter,
19 miles west of Singleton, on the road from
Singleton to Cassilis. Coal abounds in its
neighbourhood, and other valuable mineral
deposits. The noticeable settlements near
Singleton are ;—Belford (on the line 10 miles
south-east from Singleton), Bridgeman, Cam-
berwell, Glendon Brook, Howe’s Valley,
Ravensworth, Scott’s Flat, Sedgefield, St.
Clare, Vere, Warkworth, and Westbrook.
Time of journey from Newcastle to Singleton,
about two and a half hours.
Route No. 25—From Newcastle to
West Maitland: 20miles. —Maitland (by
many once not unfairly ranked next after the


capital of the Colony, for its wealth and im-
portance) is divided into East Maitland and
West Maitland by Wallis Creek, over which
there is an excellent bridge. East Maitland
was the original Government township; but
when “ Maitland” is now spoken of West
Maitland is generally meant-—it being, of the
two, by far the larger and more important
place. Maitland lies low—only 124 feet above
the sea-level. Maitland is 12 miles south
of Paterson, the chief town of the Paterson
District. Maitland is also reckoned to be
95 miles from Sydney, by the ordinary postal
route, 20 miles by rail from the Newcastle
Terminus, and 29 miles from Singleton. West
Maitland contains several good hotels and
fine public buildings, with many commodious
churches and schools. The population of
West Maitland in 1881 was 5,703 souls.
The townships, villages, and settlements
near East and West Maitland are : Anvil
Creek, Bishop’s Bridge, Branxton, Buchanan,
Creswick, Elderslie, Farley, Greta (late
Farthing’s), Hinton, Largs, Lochinvar,
Morpeth , Mount Vincent, Rothbury, and
Woodville. Of these, Lochinvar, Greta, and
Branxton are stopping-places on the Great
Northern Railway, to the west of Maitland ;
and Morpeth is to the north-eastward, at a
distance of 6 miles. Morpeth is the head
of the navigation of the Hunter River, and
steamers constantly ply between it and
Sydney.
Route No. 26—From Newcastle to
East Maitland: 18 miles.—East Maitland
station—reached by the railway traveller
after a trip of rather less than one hour’s
duration—is situated in a pleasant spot, with
rising ground near it, the station itself being
not more than 18 feet above the sea-level. East
Maitland is considered to be one of the best
laid out towns in the Colony, and when the
numerous trees, so judiciously planted, shall
have grown up, it will be one of the most
picturesque. In its wide and well kept
streets there are many excellent and sub-
stantial buildings, churches, banks, hotels,
and shops. The Government gaol and the
adjacent Court-house are both fine and com-
modious buildings, standing on a gentle
eminence to the north-east of the township.
The population of East Maitland in 1881
was 2,302 persons. Courts of Quarter
Sessions and Circuit Courts are held here.
You can go from East Maitland direct by
the subsidiary line, which starts from here
to Morpeth. Near East Maitland (to the
eastward) are Morpeth, Wickham, Woodford,
and Hinton. Time of journey, about fifty-
five minutes.
Route No. 27—From Newcastle to
Waratah : 4 miles. —Waratah is a busy
thriving township, only 4 miles west of New-
castle, and not more than 13 feet above high-
water-mark. It is said to have a population
of about 3,000 souls, the principal industries
being coal-mining, stone-quarrying, and
copper-smelting. Coal is shipped from shoots
into vessels lying in the lower waters of the
Hunter at Point Waratah. At the distance
of about 1| mile west of Waratah the
Wallsend subsidiary line joins on to the
Great Northern Railway. There is no parti-
cular beauty in any of the surroundings of
Waratah, but it is outside of the “ great coal
city” into something like the country, and
the place is consequently a favourite resort
to the citizens of Newcastle, from which it
lies about 10 minutes’ distance, by rail.
Besides Waratah the places near Newcastle
are Stockton, Honeysuckle Point, Hamilton,
Lambton, Minmi, New Lambton, Plattsburg,
Wallsend, Brookstown, Hexham , Alnwick,
Adamstown, Charlestown, Oneygamba, and
Tighe’s Hill. Wallsend and Hexham are
connected (by rail) with the terminus at
Newcastle.


ROUTES ON NORTHERN AND NORTH-WESTURN LINES.
There are three subsidiary lines to the
Northern line, but they are not of such
length and importance as the subsidiary
line from Blacktown to Richmond, or the
line from Wallerawang to Mudgee. 1. The
first of these is the subsidiary line from
Newcastle to Bullock Island ; 1| mile. This
joins the main line at Honeysuckle Point,
just outside Newcastle. It is not much used
for passengers, but is used for the conveyance
of coal and other mineral products. Over
1,000,000 tons of coal are carried over the line
annually and shipped at the steam cranes here.
2. The second of these subsidiary lines to
the Great Northern line runs from New-
castle (westerly) to Wallsend—a distance of
8 miles. There is a morning and afternoon
train every day (including Sundays) and the
trajet is made in 35 minutes. The trains
between Newcastle and Wallsend call, either
way, at Waratah (at Hamilton only if re-
quired) and at Honeysuckle Point. Wall-
send, the terminus of this subsidiary line, is
a busy, rising, incorporated town, with
adjacent collieries. It already numbers at
least 5,000 inhabitants. Wallsend is 20
miles north-east of Cooranbong, by which,
after a journey of 32 miles to the southward,
Gosford, the pretty chief township of Brisbane
Water, may conveniently be reached. There
is a good road, and the telegraph line runs
along the same all the way. Cooranbong can
also be reached by a road southerly from
Maitland. 3. The third subsidiary line—
that fro'm East Maitland to Morpeth—is, in
its extreme length, 4 miles long. There are
several trains on it every day (including
Sundays) and the trajet is made in half an
hour. The trains between East Maitland
and Morpeth call at Northumberland-street,
which is the only intermediate stopping-place
on the line. This subsidiary line is one of
great practical use to the inhabitants of the
towns it connects, especially when it is
remembered that Morpeth is the head of the
navigation of the Hunter River.
ROUTE OF MAIN BRANCH NORTH-WESTERN LINE.
The North-western line leaves the main
Northern Railway at Werris Creek and
runs to Narrabri, a distance of 97 miles.
Werris Creek is 155 miles from Newcastle,
and Narrabri is consequently 252 miles from
the seaport. The line was opened to
Narrabri in October, 1882, but at times
between the 15th March, 1879, when the first
section from Werris Creek to Breeza was
completed, various sections have been opened
for traffic. The line passes through the
well known Liverpool Plains District, which,
although almost entirely at present devoted
to pastoral purposes, may, now that the
Railway has reached the district, be in time
devoted to agriculture, the soil, it is said,
being very suitable for wheat-growing, and
it is confidently expected that a system of
irrigation can be carried out on these plains.
The stations on the North-western branch
are Breeza, Gunnedah, an important town,
containing 1,331 inhabitants, Boggabri and
Narrabri. The line will at some future date
be extended to the river Darling, the Govern-
ment having promised to submit a proposal
to Parliament to construct a line from
Narrabri to the town of Walgett on the
river named, and it is anticipated that little
or no opposition will be rafeed to this
extension.


RAILWAY ITINERARY AND DESCRIPTIONS OF SCENERY.
STATIONS AND PLATFORMS, &c.
I.—SYDNEY TO GRANVILLE.
(MAIN TRUNK LINE.)
N.B. “Suburban Trains” to the Town of Parramatta, i mile beyond Granville to the N.W.
Eveleigli 1 mile ; 70 feet above sea-
level,—Eveleigli, only a short distance to the
left, beyond the Redfern Railway Tunnel, is
reckoned a mile from the Sydney Terminus.
Short as this distance is by rail, this platform
is found to be very convenient for persons re-
siding at Alexandria, Redfern, and Waterloo.
As the passenger leaves the Sydney terminus
he may have a good view of three handsome
stone edifices near the line—the Railway
Mortuary Station, with the Wesleyan Church
to the right, and St. Paul’s Anglican Church
and Tower to the left. The Railway work-
shops at Eveleigli, now in course of construc-
tion, will be when completed the most extensive
south of the Equator, and are to be fitted up
with all the most modern appliances for the
construction and repair of engines and other
rolling stock. The buildings on the left-
hand side are the boiler, steam-hammer, and
smiths’ shops, and foundry, under one roof
300 feet long, in four bays of 60 feet each;
the next block, 550 feet by 300 feet, will
comprise the other worshops in connection
with the locomotive department. The engine
running-shed is 303 feet by 300 feet, and is
capable of accommodating 126 engines of the
largest type. On the right side of the line
are situated the carriage and waggon repair-
ing shops, in a block of buildings 600 feet by
351 feet; also, the railway stores and other
buildings. At night the yard is lit up with
the electric light.
M‘Donald Town 1| mile; 80 feet
above sea-level. —Having passed Eveleigli,
the passenger by the train has, at once,
to the left, a fine prospect of Botany
Bay in the distance, across a level, open,
country, with the church and village of St.
Peter’s on elevated ground to the westward.
On the right of the line can now be seen the
grand architectural outlines of the Sydney
University—to the west of which (on the
ridge of the hill, close to Newtown) stands
the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Asylum—a
curious red brick building, in marked con-
trast to its more pretentious neighbour. The
M‘Donald Town Platform is placed at a
siding, just where the Railroad winds to the
right before it enters Newtown. It is between
Eveleigli and M‘Donald Town that the Rail-
way to Illawarra joins the Main Southern
Railway.
Newtown Station, 2 miles; 96 feet
above sea-level. —The Railroad, ascending
gradually from the terminus, now runs under
a bridge and through the pleasant suburban
township of Newtown. Emerging from the
shadow of a second bridge, the traveller
usually finds that the train halts for a few
moments at the Newtown Station, close to a
pretty Gothic church erected by the Roman
Catholic communion. Appointed time for
train to reach the Newtown Station after leav-
ing the Sydney terminus, about six minutes.
Stanmore, 2| miles; about 100 feet
above sea-level. —This platform stands
about half-way between Newtown and
Petersham Stations, and is for the con-
venience of the residents of Stanmore. In
the neighbourhood is the Wesleyan Training
College, Newington.


Petersham Station, 3 miles ; 100 feet
above sea-level. —Having left Newtown,
the traveller by the train is pleased to observe
an excellent and comprehensive view stretch-
ing away to the northward —to the heights
of the picturesque surburban hamlet of
Balmain, the church towers and houses of
which here first become plainly visible.
Beyond Balmain the North Shore hills
extend in the extreme distance. On the
southern side of the line, houses, villas,
gardens, and slowly developing streets are
successively presented ; where (not long since)
there was nothing but open country, or shady
“ bush.” On approaching Petersham Station
a fine view over the country unfolds itself to
the right—the celebrated “ Blue Mountains ”
becoming visible far away to the westward.
Petersham Station is hoav the centre of a
thickly populated suburban district, and on
the slopes around it are many really delight-
ful villas and gardens. Usual time of trajet
from Sydney to Petersham, about twelve
minutes.
Summer Hill, 4 miles ; about 90 feet
above sea-level. —A few years ago Summer
Hill formed one large estate (Underwood’s).
It was subsequently subdivided and sold,
and from its proximity to the city, com-
manded a ready sale. Houses were soon
built and a platform established, and now
the traffic to and from this place is very
considerable. Quitting the Petersham Station
the Railroad for a while traverses a rolling
country, numerously inhabited. The burial-
ground and Homan Catholic Church of St.
Mary and St. Joseph then stand together for
a moment near the advancing train to the
right; and, after that, the old village of
Petersham comes directly in view, down in
the hollow, lying on the side of the Parramatta
Road. The course of the train brings the
tourist next, somewhat abruptly, by a viaduct
over Long Cove Creek, a stream which flows
along the bottom of the gorge, down which —-
away towards the Parramatta River—is sud-
denly disclosed a long vista of picturesque
woods. The slender spire of St. David’s
Presbyterian Church is seen amongst the
trees to the north-west in the mid distance.
Ashfield Station, 5 miles; 86 feet
above sea level. —A mile from Summer Hill
the important suburb of Ashfield is reached.
After leaving Summer Hill the southern edge
of the old Ashfield Racecourse is gained, with
the old Southern Road from Sydney on the
right hand ; and so, passing under a bridge
and through a deep cutting between houses,
orchards, and gardens, the train comes
thundering into Ashfield. Ashfield is the
centre of a very populous district. To the
left, about 2 miles distant, is the old township
of Canterbury, situated on the Cook’s River.
The suburb contains many residences with
very tastefully laid out gardens, while the dis-
trict around contains many charming drives
and bits of scenery. Time between the
Sydney and Ashfield Stations, about fifteen
minutes.
Croydon Station, 6 miles; 86 feet
above sea-level. —The railway passenger,
on leaving Ashfield Station, is now (for about
a mile) hurried past an agreeable bit of home
scenery, diversified by gardens and trees,
with a wide, uneven space on either side of
the road in the back ground, where Nature
has not yet been ruthlessly improved away.
Streets (for the most part mere lanes) inter-
sect this tract, whereon stand villas and
gardens belonging to Sydney people, displaying
a considerable amount of domestic comfort,
originality, and even elegance of design.
Vistas of pleasant country roadways—green,
and as yet innocent of dust and mire—
stretch up the gentle eminences to the left
and right.
Burwood Station, 7 miles; 68 feet
above sea-level. —After passing Croydon
platform, the railway traveller will at first
only see a continuation of such scenery as
he has been observing between Ashfield and
Croydon. Nevertheless (justbeforehe arrives
at the prosperous village of Burwood) he may
catch a passing view of the Congregational
Church to the right, near the Burwood
Station; and he may likewise—beyond that
pretty little ecclesiastical edifice—observe the
Anglican Church on the Parramatta Road,
with a good view of Balmain and the North
Shore hills in the distance. To the left he
will doubtless notice another handsome


Anglican Church (with an adjacent school-
house) on Burwood heights; also more bush
scenes, presenting a series of gardens and
woodland glades. Near Burwood, on the
line, he may likewise get a hasty glimpse to
the north-west of the hill country near Par-
ramatta. The passenger traffic at Burwood
is largely fed by the residents of Enfield and
Bankstown on the one side, and of the district
between Burwood and the south bank of the
Parramatta River on the other. Appointed
time from Sydney to Burwood, usually about
twenty-four minutes.
Redmyre Platform, 7|- miles ; 60 feet
above sea-level. —A half-mile beyond Bur-
wood, to the westward, is a platform named
Redmyre, for the convenience of residents in
the adjacent houses and villas. The line to
connect the Southern with the Northern
Railway system will join the Great Southern
Railway between Redmyre and Homebush.
The works are now in progress.
Homebush Station, 8 miles; 32 feet
above sea-level. —Between Burwood and
Homebush there is a considerable descent on
the line, amounting to not less than 36 feet.
After passing the Redmyre platform the
railway traveller has a distant view of the
country to the north-west, across an open
range of forest. The hills beyond Parra-
matta now more plainly appear; and there is
also an unexpected prospect of the long
settled country about Ryde across the Parra-
matta River. The tops of the Blue Moun-
tains are again visible to the westward. On
the right the traveller (if a sporting man)
may observe, with some interest, tlae old
Homebush Racecourse—which, before the
establishment of Randwick, was the one
great arena for race-horses, jockeys, and
bookmakers. Homebush, like Summer Hill,
was until recently thinly populated, on
account of the land in the vicinity being
locked up. After the subdivision of the land
in 1878 houses commenced to spring up on
all sides, and Homebush is now fast becoming
well peopled. In the vicinity several works
have been established. A little beyond the
station extensive cattle yards have been com
pleted The yards are capable of holding
1,200 cattle and 12,000 sheep, and have cost
upwards of .£60,000. They cover not less
than 40 acres of ground, and are intersected
throughout by Railway sidings, and every-
thing has been arranged that can make them
convenient. The yards were built under the
supervision of the City Council.
Rookwood Station, 10 miles; 55 feet
above sea-level. —Between Homebush and
Rookwood Station—a distance of 2 miles—
the country adjacent to the Railroad is of a
dreary character, somewhat suitable to the
locality approached—the great Metropolitan
Cemetery or Necropolis, at Haslem’s Creek.
The grounds have been laid out with great
taste, and present to the passing traveller a
cheery picture, taking away the melancholy
thoughts that would arise in viewing the city
of the dead were it not relieved by tasteful
parterres and shrubs and handsome mauso-
leums. The buildings connected with this
cemetery are really handsome edifices—the
Mortuary House, or Station, at the end of the
siding on the ground particularly so. The
Jewish Burial-ground adjoins that appropri-
ated to all the various denominations of
Christians, who here sleep peacefully together.
This station was once known as “Haslem’s
Creek,” but it has assumed the name of
“ Rookwood ” —a name borrowed, it would
appear, from Harrison Ainsworth’s well-
known “ deadly-lively” romance. The trains
reach Rookwood from Sydney in half an
hour. Funeral trains stop at Rookwood,
and are shunted into the cemetery siding—
which is about a quarter of a mile long.
Auburn Platform, 12 miles; about 40
feet above sea-level. —Auburn is a plat-
form recently established. The locality was
formerly covered with scrub, but now build-
ings are going up rapidly, and the scrub is
fast making way for the erection of hand-
some villas and the laying out of ornamental
grounds. A mile beyond Auburn, Duck
River is reached, and here numerous manu-
factories have been started. On the banks of
the river or creek, the extensive range of build-
ings for Hudson Brothers Company have been
erected. These buildings are for the manu-
facture of Railway rolling stock, and are the
largest and best works of the kind in the
Colonies, The erection of these works has


necessarily created population, and now
numbers of workmen’s houses are fast being
put up. There are also in the vicinity other
important works—Ritchie’s Railway Stock
Works, Thompson, Maxwell & Co.’s fell-
mongery, Messrs. Bergin’s tweed manufac-
tory, meat-pi’eserving works, and numerous
brickworks. A platform has also been estab-
lished, denominated Clyde.
Granville Station, 13 miles; 32 feet
above sea-level. —This Junction is 1 mile
from the Parramatta Station, and is a place
which owed its existence originally to the
Railways. Here the Southern Main Branch
joins the Western Trunk Line; the Trunk
Line itself turning to the N.W., to go through
the old town of Parramatta. The suburban
trains go past the Junction into the town of
Parramatta, and stop there; but in all other
trains there is a change here for passengers
or goods destined to go South. The suburban
trains, of course, travel more slowly than
the other trains, but the usual time for the
journey between Sydney and Granville is
reckoned to be rather more than half an hour.
Through the establishment of the works
in its vicinity Granville is rapidly rising to
be a place of some importance, and has been
incorporated.
II.—SYDNEY TO WATERFALL—ILLAWARRA RAILWAY.
In 1881, Parliament approved of the
extension of the Railway to the Illawarra
district, the line approved of running almost
parallel with the coast. The Railway was
soon afterwards commenced, and in 1884 the
first section viz ; from Sydney to Hurstville,
10 miles, was thrown open for public traffic.
Other sections of the line are in progress
but it will be 1888 before the whole is
finished. The route traversed is one of the
deepest interest both on account of the
magnificent scenery passed through, and
for the extensive mineral resources it will
develope. In regard to scenery there is first,
the view at Como on the George’s River,
the Railway crossing the river by a hand-
some iron bridge of 900 feet in length. The
crossing is at a spot where two rocky promon-
tories approach each other, but on either side
the river widens into broad reaches, and from
the bridge a magnificent view is obtained, on
the east of a long stretch of river, the banks
rising in many parts abruptly from the water,
while in other places the river is bounded
by sandy bays; on the west the mouth of
a tributary stream is first discernible at a
sharp bend of the river, which a little further
on appears as if shut in by the rugged hills
that close upon it. Beyond Como the line
touches the National Park of the Colony,
a magnificent heritage of some 36,000 acres,
boasting an excellent port, a river, and glens
that vie, in regard to scenic beauty, with
anything in the world. There arc also the
Bulli and the Illawarra districts, which
are admittedly the natural gardens of the
Colony, while they possess splendid mineral
resources, even now largely worked, and a
large area of cultivated land.
Returning to the opened portion of the
Illawarra Railway it may be mentioned that
the line branches from the Main Railway at
Eveleigh, and the first station reached is
Erskinville, one mile from Sydney. This
proves of great convenience to a large
body of workmen who have homes in the
vicinity.
St. Peters Station, 2 miles; 35 feet
above sea-level— St. Peters proper is a
municipality touching the adjacent boroughs
of Alexandria, Newtown, and Marrickville.
The municipal population of the borough,
which was proclaimed in 1871, is 778 and
the annual value of property, £21,576. St,
Peters boasts of two Post Offices, a Telegraph
Office, Money Order and Savings’ Bank, six
hotels, five places of public worship, two
schools, and a private Lunatic Asylum. St.
Peter’s is the centre of the brickmaking in


dustry and to the left nearing the station may
be seen numerous kilns bespeaking the extent
of the works carried on.
Marrickville, 3 miles ; 13 feet above
sea-level. —The principal features of this
not very attractive Suburb are market gardens
and brickyards. To the west lies the more
populous district of Canterbury. The number
of ratepayers on the Municipal Roll is 1,248,
and the Municipality contains a Public School,
Post and Telegraph Offices, Money Order and
Savings’ Bank and three Churches. There
are also some good gardens in the vicinity,
Graham’s Nursery in particular being worthy
a visit.
Tempe, 4 miles; 14 feet above sea-
level.—Tempe with the adjacent station
Marrickville have the unenviable position of
being two of the lowest Stations on our
Railway lines and at times of heavy rainfall
the surrounding lands are in part flooded.
Near Tempe is seen the majestic block of
buildings known as the Warren, formerly the
residence of the Hon. T. Holt. Cook’s River
also runs near the Station, and in its upper
part it is a picturesque stretch of water, but
at Tempe it widens out into a broad half lake
half swamp necessitating a great deal of filling
up to make a secure road for the Railway;
about two miles from Tempe the river runs
into Botany Bay.
Arncliffe, 5 miles ; 50 feet above sea-
level.—Arncliffe does not present many
attractive features ; most of the country is
scrubby and unreclaimed, but since the open-
ing of the line (the remark applying equally
to contiguoxis localities) land of any quality
has enhanced in value, and residences are
progressing apace. Just beyond the station
the line passes under the Hurstville Road, an
expensive tunnel having to be made at this
spot.
Rockdale, 6 miles ; 55 feet above sea-
level.—At this Station a private Tramway
branches off, which has been undertaken by
Mr. Saywell. This line, 2| miles in length,
leads to the Tea Gardens and Swimming Baths
at Lady Robinson’s Beach, which promises to
be a most delectable and popular resort for
holiday makers. A hotel is to he erected and
will he a large and commodious affair, huilt
on the most approved Continental principles,
and the haths are to he 420 feet long by 90
feet wide. The purity of the w r ater as well
as the beauty of the surroundings at Lady
Robinson’s Beach will constitute attractions
unsurpassed by any other sea-side sanatorium.
The land in the vicinity of Rockdale is fertile
and has attracted the notice of many gardeners
whose labors are shown in the flourishing
nurseries and orchards near the Station.
Choice elevated building sites are also avail-
able and as Rockdale is within a convenient
distance from Sydney a fairly large population
is settling here.
Kogarah, 7 miles; 69 feet above sea-
level.—This is another place which has risen
to importance for residential purposes for
workers in the overcrowded city since the
opening of the Railway to Hurstville. There
are two places of Public Worship, the Church
of England and the Roman Catholic, a Public
School and Post Office, while there are two
hotels for the accommodation of travellers.
At Kogarah Bay is situated the Aborigines
Camp. Since the opening of the line this
place has made more progress than any other
suburb; this may be attributed to the fact
that it is practically a Marine Suburb, being
within easy distance of Lady Robinson’s Beach
and George’s River, views of which can be
obtained from the high lying land around the
Railway Station, from where two lines of
busses ply regularly to Sandringham and Tom
Ugly’s Point respectively. Kogarah boasts
of three places of worship either open, or
being opened, a Bank, several hotels, stores,
etc., while an Oddfellows’ Hall and a hand-
some School of Arts will soon grace the suburb
which already possesses a number of good
private residences, while almost daily new
buildings are seen rising in every direction.
The residents are eminently progressing, and
in view of the natural advantages possessed
by the Suburb, seem determined to make it
the most marked among the many beautiful
localities surrounding the Metropolis.
Hurstville, 9 miles ; 217 feet above
sea-level. —This is a healthy salubrious
locality, situated about two miles from the


George’s River.




magnificent bridge which spans George’s
Paver. There area Public School, Post Office,
Branch of Bank of Australasia, and two hotels
here, while the residential population israpidly
increasing. Between Kogarah and Hurst-
ville the line rises 150 feet, the latter station
commanding an extensive view over Botany,
while the white sands of Cronulla Beach are
seen glistening to the eastward. George’s
Elver is two miles from Hurstville Station.
Como, 13 miles ; 50 feet above sea-
level. After leaving Hurstville, the line
passes through a locality which is commen-
cing to show the benefit of railway extension,
as numerous substantial dwellings have been
or are being erected ; and to provide for the
people in the neighbourhood, a platform is
now being erected at Penhurst, about one
mile from Hurstville. Between this and
Como there are few signs of settlement, and
the land stands in its natural state ; pro-
vision has, however, been made for a platform
at Oatley’s, midway between Penhurst and
Como. Shortly after passing Oatley’s some
pretty glens are seen, the country becoming
more broken, sloping to the river, and the
shrubs and trees more varied. Soon the
river is seen gleaming through the trees, and
the (rain speeds on, bringing the traveller to
the river, which is crossed by a handsome,
iron-lattice bx-idge of 900 feet in length.
The view from the carriage is a very fine
one, the x-iver below and above the bridge
being a majestic stream offering a long,
straight course, which will no doubt, in time,
be the scene of many aquatic contests. On
either side the river breaks into many minia-
ture bays and picturesque woodlands, while
to the right may be seen the junction of the
Woronora with the main river, this tributary
running for many miles back, in places paral-
lel with the railway. Como is situated on
the banks of the main stream, near the
junction, and the land here is the property
of the Holt-Sutherland Company. The owners
have done much to make the surroundings
pleasant, and it is now a favourite pleasure
resort, being within such easy reach of
Sydney. Boats are always obtainable, and
fish are plentiful, and excellent picnicking and
camping grounds are available.
Sutherland Station, 15 miles ; 360
feet above sea-level— At about |-mile
from Como Station the line turns south-
easterly, bringing again ixxto view that
excellent example of engineering work, the
Como railway-bridge, and the enchanting
scenery of the bays and inlets of George’s
River. The line then proceeds southerly,
continuing up a steep incline of 1 in 40 till
Sutherland is reached ; and here the line first
touches the National Park. It contains an
area of 36,300 acres, and extends along the
main lllawarra railway-line from within 200
yards of Sutherland Station to the range 800
feet above sea-level, bounding the southerly
watershed of Waterfall Creek, and 800 yards
beyond Waterfall station, 24f miles from
Sydney. The railway-stations within the
park upon the main line are Heathcote, 630
feet above sea-level at 20 miles, and Water-
fall, 730 feet above sea-level at 24 miles from
Sydney. The situation of the National Pai’k
relatively with Sydney, Botany, &c., is shown
upon the map in appendix. The Pai’k has
7| miles frontage to the ocean {including a
boat-hai’bour at Wattamolla, and inlets with
ocean beaches at Marley Beach, Little Marley
Beach, Curracurrong, and Garie) and 4 miles
frontage to the southerly side of Port Hacking
River. Within the pax’k, Port Hacking
River flows for 9|- miles, including 5f miles
navigable for boats, namely, 4 miles fresh
water above the dam at Audley, and If
miles salt water below that dam. Kan-
garoo Creek, fresh water, flows into Port
Hacking River at Audley, and is similarly
navigable for If mile.
The land in the National Park rises from
sea-level to table-lands, at altitudes varying
from about 350 feet to over 800 feet, and
from which excellent and extensive views are
from many points observable. The table-
lands are partly fair land, and partly bari’en
stony heaths. The table-lands are generally
separated by deep valleys.
The valleys of the principal watercourses,
notably at Port Hacking River and Bola
Creek to a large extent abound in rich
foliage, including cabbage-tree and ban-
galo palms, tree-ferns, Christmas, myrtle, and
other handsome shrubs, numerous well grown
black-butt, woolly-butt, , turpentine, and
other noble forest-timber ti'ees rising, at the


southerly and south-easterly part, above the
confluence of Bola Creek with Port Hacking
River, to heights up to nearly 200 feet, and
bordering adjacent beautiful streams, having
occasionally long reaches of deep and shaded
fresh water.
Principal features in the Park are Port
Hacking River and Kangaroo Creek, each
vastly improved by works instituted by the
park trustees, and carried out under their
directions. One important and very neces-
sary improvement effected is the removal
of thousands of tons of fallen timber and
detached rocks from the streams. Prior to
such improvements, boat-navigation of the
most beautiful parts was very difficult,
except at high tide, and impossible at low
tide. Now, as the result of the removal of
obstructions and construction of the dam
near Audley, a long length of the river and
Kangaroo Creek are at all times navigable
for very large boats and small steam-launches.
Bola Creek, an important confluent of
Port Hacking River, South-west Arm Creek,
and Cabbage-tree Creek, each will repay
inspection, Bola Creek on account of the
richness of the foliage and the other creeks,
mainly owing to the beautiful, bold, and
varied scenery. Further detailed information
will be found under the headings, Loftus,
Heathcote, and Waterfall Stations.
In the park, within |-mile east of Sutherland
Station, a grand, extensive, and very beautiful
view of the waters and valley of Woronora
River is visible, and of the land as far as
Peakhurst Heights. Standing at the easterly
margin of the gorge, 300 feet above, and not
more than 400 yards distant from the river
at its confluence with Forbes Creek, the
spectator cannot fail to be pleased with the
prospect. If time permits, the walk should
be continued to the confluence of Forbes
Creek, where there are excellent bathing
places ; the water (salt) clear as crystal,
shallow or deep as may be desired, with
good diving and landing places.
Loftus 17J miles ; 390 feet above sea-
level.—At 11- mile beyond Sutherland, a
branch line leaves the main line and pro-
ceeds south-easterly, for Imile, over the
clear area of 220 acres recently (April, 1886)
used as the military encampment and review
ground, and from which very beautiful views
are obtained of Redfern, Randwick, Botany
Bay, Captain Cook’s landing place, La Pe-
rouse, the Ocean, Cronulla Beach, Jibbon
Beach at Port Hacking. The branch line
terminates at Loftus Station, 171 r miles from
Sydney, 390 feet above sea-level. At this
place a hotel has been erected, now kept by
Mr. Sebastian Hodge.
Before proceeding to the river, it will
well repay the visitor to walk easterly about
f-mile along the summit or range, between
Port Hacking River and Temptation Creek.
The views therefrom of the river and ocean
are superior, and looking back, the large
cleared area intersected by the branch rail-
way line, and bounded upon the north-west
by the main railway line and the south-
westerly—the upper side—by scrub and
forests presents decidedly an effective picture.
Returning to the vicinity of Loftus Heights,
the visitor should next proceed to the river
by the zigzag pathway laid out for the con-
venience of pedestrians and equestrians.
Upon reaching the river, the use of a
boat should be obtained if the visitor desires
sport with a fishing-line upon the salt
water, or to enjoy an exploration of the
many pretty bends and inlets of the river
and port. As there are several shallow flats
at this part, it is well to look to the tide, as
transit with the tide is naturally more expe-
ditious, and at very low tides the difficulties in
rowing are very largely increased. A |-mile
below the zigzag, upon the left-hand side of
the river, a rocky precipice, prettily marked
with ferns, mosses, &c., rises upwards of 200
feet, and presents a striking appearance. A
mile lower down and opposite Mangrove
Creek—a pretty little inlet—is a remarkably
hollow rock jutting into the stream, and
known as Swallow Rock. One mile still
further down, and most charmingly situated,
opposite Mangrove Island—a pretty islet—
is a substantial hut known as Fountain
Cottage, where a Park Ranger resides upon
the National Park, in the midst of the
deer park. Upon the right-hand side of
the river, 100 yards southerly from the
cottage, a fountain gushes out of the rock
into a miniature bay; boats can readily
come alongside the fountain, and the pure,
fresh water is easily obtained without the


necessity of landing. The fountain and
cottage are within the deer park, upon which
are running and thriving a number of deer—
a donation from the trustees of the Parra-
matta Park. The deer park has a water-
frontage of nearly 2 miles, and contains 135
acres, in the main well grassed, with a never
failing supply of fresh water. In the positions
indicated upon the map, and opposite the
National Park, are the extensive inlets known
as North-west Arm, Gymea, Ewey, Burra-
near, and Gunnamatta Bays, and within the
boundaries of the park are the South-west
Arm and the charming inlet Cabbage-tree
Creek; the latter can, however, only be
entered by boat for about an hour before or
an hour after high tide, as there is a sand-
shoal at the entrance. Persons who may
be able to spare the time are, however,
strongly advised to watch the opportunity
and row up the creek to the head of boat-
navigation, Ij mile—the scenery is varied
and beautiful. After proceeding up a
shallow channel -j-mile, the visitor will be
agreeably surprised by suddenly coming into
a grand basin, nearly circular and about 400
yards in diameter; then the creek narrows
and is bordered by varied foliage, including
a few tree-ferns and some small, elegant
cabbage-tree palms. Half a mile north-
westerly from the entrance of Cabbage-tree
Creek is Port Hacking sand-spit, about 600
yards long, and which adds effect to the
scenery, especially when viewed from the
wmter on a bright day. Half a mile easterly,
beyond the entrance of Cabbage-tree Creek,
Mr. Simpson’s accommodation house, “ Tyreal
House,” is reached ; next, and just beyond
that commanding rise, Cabbage-tree Point,
is the Yarmouth Estate, upon which is
erected the comfortable bungalow of W. W.
Richardson, Esq. On the frontage in this
estate is an excellent beach of hard, clear,
white sand. One mile further easterly is
Port Hacking Point. At the entrance to
Port Hacking, before reaching this point,
there is another beautiful sand-shore known
as Jibbon Beach, upon the frontage of the
Government village reserve of 500 acres.
Points of Interest along the Coast.—
About 3-| miles southerly from Port Hacking
Point there is a Government reserve having
frontage to the ocean at M arley Beach. Partly
within this reserve and partly upon the
National Park is a fine lagoon or lakelet,
formerly a favourite resort for wild duck and
other game; and as shooting is prohibited
upon the park, game should ultimately
again become plentiful in the neighbourhood.
Half a mile southerly is Little Marley, a
small ocean-beach. About If mile further
south-westerly, or 5| miles from Port Hack-
ing Point, the pretty boat-harbour and good
fishing-grounds of Wattamolla are reached.
Within |-mile of Wattamolla, still south-
westerly, there is the ocean inlet of Curra-
currang, and at the south-eastern corner of
the park, and extending for 1-mile northerly
therefrom, is the beautiful ocean-beach Garie.
It is fittingly backed by charming valleys,
bedecked with cabbage-tree palms, tree-ferns,
myrtles, &c. Garie beach, which adjoins Mr.
Collaery’s Garie Estate, is distant in a direct
line 9 miles from Port Hacking Point, 10
miles by road from Simpson’s “Tyreal House”
or from the Spit, and 8 miles by road from
Audley (National Park camp). At frequent
intervals the views from those roads, which
are generally along the summits of ranges
which intersect the park, splendid and ex-
tensive views are visible.
The beautiful bays of Port Hacking, Cro-
nulla Beach, Botany Bay, the Ocean, Bulgo
Mountain, &c., are seen to advantage.
Starting again from the foot of the zigzag
path below Loftus Station, the visitor may
now (as a result of the judicious improve-
ments effected under the direction of the park
trustees, including the construction of the
dam at Audley, Lady Carrington Road, &c.,
and clearing Port Hacking River and Kan-
garoo Creek of snags (fallen timber) and
detached rocks formerly in the channels)
comfortably inspect the beautiful foliage, land-
and water-. scapes of the valleys of these
streams, and of Bola Creek, &c., either upon
foot or riding, driving, or for over 5 miles by
boat—the latter, perhaps, the most enjoyable
means so far as can be availed of. The dam,
300 feet across, solidly constructed of clay,
stone, &c., with a roadway 33 feet wide on
top, is a great advantage; and its suc-
cessful construction, with the result of con-
verting insignificant, salt-water streams, which
could not be rowed over in the smallest boats


at low tide, practically into a charming fresh-
water lake, miles in length, and continu-
ously navigable at all times by the largest
boats or by small steam-launches, is an
achievement in respect of which the park
trustees may well be congratulated. Vege-
tation characteristic of fresh-water rivers is
now thriving, and will in the future afford
fine cover for game, which will increase in
number, as shooting in the park is strictly
prohibited. The trustees have caused to bo
introduced to the river trout and English
perch, obtained from Lake Wendorure, at
Ballarat, thanks to the kindness of the
municipal authorities of that city.
Three hundred yards above the dam, at
the confluence of Kangaroo Creek with the
Port Hacking River, Audley, the main
National Park camp, is charmingly situated,
and is well worthy of a visit. When in the
vicinity of the main camp, the visitor should
proceed about 200 yards up the hill, towards
Loftus, and at a rocky pass, known as
“ The Demon’s Gate,” inspect a very re-
markable, hollow sandstone-rock, which, ex-
ternally, has an appearance of solidity, but
internally is honeycombed in a marvellous
manner. This hollow rock formed an excellent,
dry, gunpowder-and-fuse store when the ad-
jacent park-roads were under formation.
At present, the most comfortable way of
exploring the navigable part of Kangaroo
Creek is by boat; the bordering foliage
of this creek is not so varied as that on the
banks of the main river. There are, however,
on its banks numerous specimens of hand-
some pine-trees, christmas-bush, &c., which
present a pretty appearance. The many
beauties of Port Hacking River above the
dam and its immediate surroundings may be
seen to equal advantage from the road as
from a boat; the road is at a level generally
of about 20 feet above the water. It may
not be amiss here to describe the road along
the right, back of Port Hacking River, from
the dam to the southernmost boundary of the
park. This road is named Lady Carrington
Road.
Proceeding southerly from the dam, the
road which forms a pretty walk or drive,
skirts the easterly margin of a fine flat of
about 10 acres j to the left, the newly con-
structed road towards the deer park and
Garie branches off. At half a mile from the
dam, on Lady Carrington Road, two beauti-
ful canopies of wide-spreading tree ferns
upon the second flat are passed.
At |-mile this road passes under the
picturesque cliff named Gibraltar, and 100
yards further southerly Mullion (Eagle)
Brook is crossed. In the early summer time
the valley of this small brook usually appears
gay with torch-lily plants in flower, a truly
striking spectacle.
At Warrul (Bee) Brook, about 1 mile from
the dam, tall christmas-bushes 30 feet high
are in view, and in some seasons the topmost
branches bend over nearly to the ground with
the weight of the blossoms. At this part
fine views are presented of the luxuriant flat
upon the opposite side of the river, and from
which are growing cabbage-tree palms, tree
ferns, vines, numerous mimosse, myrtle, and
several specimens of the specially beautiful
plant or small tree, aralia panax. Through-
out the road beautiful glimpses of the river
are frequently seen.
Two miles from the dam, Karoga (White
Crane) Brook, opposite a charmingly pictu-
resque curve in the river, is reached. The
road then traverses a pretty jungle at the
base of a fine cliff, and at miles the river
again comes into view, with some splendid
foliage on each bank. Upon the left bank the
vista is especially fine. The cabbage-palms
at this part are very beautiful; the dense,
glossy vines, with occasional tree ferns, the
lillypilly plants, and turpentine trees showing
in becoming contrast. At 3| miles Birumba
(Plover) Brook is attained. Opposite, across
the river, is the patch of rich brush-land
known as the Lower Peach Trees, where forty
years back some sawyers planted some peach
seeds, and for many years afterwards fine
peach-trees flourished ; but nearly all have
of late been destroyed by bush-fires. At
3f miles distant the locality of the Upper
Peach Trees is reached. This also was a
sawyer’s camp. At Dumbul (Crow) Brook,
4 miles southerly from the dam, the river
bends to the south-west, and at 4|- miles
from the dam, in the dense brush upon the
left-hand side of the river, and seen to
advantage from Lady Carrington Road, is
perhaps the finest and most varied foliage
within 100 miles from Sydney. The tall


forest-trees, upwards of 100 feet in height,
are covered with beautiful vines, some of
which bear immense numbers of cream-
coloured flowers towards the end of Septem-
ber. Intermixed are magnificent specimens of
Bangalo palms (seaforthia elegans ), cabbage-
palms, birds-nest ferns, tree ferns, several
specimens of aralici pcinax, with a number
of lillypilly, myrtle, and mimosa bushes.
Through the vines, marvellously long native
canes are in places growing to the height of
about 100 feet, and the spectacle is simply
entrancing.
For some distance further along the road
the scenery, except at the creeks, which are
all crossed by extra-strong, well constructed
bridges, is not specially interesting until
Polona (Hawk) Brook, at 51 miles is reached.
At the easterly side of the road, a few yards
from the creek, stands a handsome, majestic,
turpentine tree, upright as an arrow, and
fully 120 feet high. Between Polona Brook
and Bola Creek Bridge, the latter 6 miles
from the dam, the foliage immediately ad-
joining each side of the road is singularly
varied ; tree ferns, and cabbage-tree ferns are
very numerous, and occasional specimens of
aralia panax come into view, and at all times
the perfume from the shrubs and flowers at
this place is very marked and pleasant.
Upon each side of Bola Creek there are
majestic forest-trees, principally blackbutt
and turpentine. Midway between Polona
Brook and Bola Creek, Lady Carrington
Road diverts from the river bank, and after
crossing Bola Creek over an admirably con-
structed timber bridge of great strength,
built mainly of turpentine piles and girders,
deeply embedded, mortised, and fixed into
the hard, smooth rock at creek bed. The
road still diverts from Port Hacking river,
and keeps for half a mile under the easterly
side of the isolated high hill known as the
Island. At 6 miles, the crest of the saddle
between the Island and the range dividing
the waters at Bola Creek from Port Hacking
River is crossed, and the road by an easy grade
again decends southerly towards that river.
At 61 miles is marked, to branch to the
w r est, a line for a road to cross Port Hacking
River, and to lead to Waterfall Station. At
7f miles from the dam, Lady Carrington
Road crosses by a substantial bridge a lovely
glen, fitly named Palm Creek from the
numerous cabbage-palms growing there.
Within 100 yards southerly from the bridge,
between the road and the river, is an
unusually fine red-cedar tree, upwards of 70
feet high. The red cedar is one of the few
Australian trees which shed its leaves in the
winter; and at 8| miles the southernmost
boundary of the park is reached. Near the
corner tree is a very fine blackbutt conspicu-
ously marked 43 over N.P.R. This road
will, probably, be continued by private enter-
prise through private lands until it reaches
the Illawarra railway at about miles
from Sydney, near Otford, and about 4|
miles beyond the southernmost boundary of
the National Park.
Heathcote, 630 feet above sea-level,
201 miles. —Beyond the junction of the
branch line the main Illawarra railway curves
to the south-west, and proceeds in a direct
line for 21 miles ; then a southerly course is
taken, passing Messrs. Rowe & Smith’s brick-
works at 19f miles, and Mr. Higgison’s
bee-farm, Bottle Forest, at 20 miles, and
Heathcote station is reached 20| miles from
Sydney. The platform is a few yards east-
erly from the main road, where the park
boundary joins Mr, Harber’s estate. Half a
mile farther east, at the northerly side of
Still Creek, there is rich brush-land, partly
upon the park and partly upon Bottle Forest
freehold land. One mile north-easterly from
the platform, upon a hill 700 feet above sea-
level, excellent views are obtained on clear
days. The ocean and Port Hacking are
visible from this hill-summit. Joining the
westerly side of the main road, immediately
opposite Heathcote Station, a Government
village, to be known as the village of Heath-
cote, has recently been surveyed (May, 1886)
in suitable allotments, and extending north-
erly and southerly from Bottle Creek. About
600 acres have been subdivided into 130
suburban portions from about 2 to 10 acres.
The lands surveyed and cleared (by the
unemployed) are at altitudes from about 500
to 700 feet above sea-level, and will form
very healthy residential sites. Early in
September next (1886) the allotments and
portions will be offered for sale at auction
upon the ground.


Waterfalls Station, 24 miles, the
present terminus of the Illawarra Rail-
way, 730 feet above sea-level. —From
Heathcote the line proceeds south-westerly for
I 4 mile to the railway water-tanks at 720 feet
above; thence the direction is southerly to
Waterfall Station at 24 miles 32 chains—the
first crossing, at 23 miles, highest level 780 feet,
of the Illawarra railway. Direct west |-mile
from Waterfall Station is erected the Trigono-
metrical Station, at the altitude of 880 feet
above sea-level, upon the summit of Mount
Westmacott, a most conspicuous land-mark.
Between the railway station and that mountain
a deep gorge intervenes, the base of which is
about 600 feet below the Trigonometrical Sta-
tion. Within the National Park, and imme-
diately easterly from Waterfall Station, is a
source of Waterfall Creek which, after run-
ning |-mile easterly, is joined by a northerly
affluent; thence it becomes a permanent brook
with a succession of fine pools of the purest
fresh water. One of these pools, at mile
from the railway, affords an excellent bathing-
place with a clear, smooth, rocky bottom and
a miniature sand-beach at the lower end.
One mile further easterly the waterfalls are
reached. The first, a sheer fall of 46 feet,
and the second 111 feet. The scenery at
this part is well worthy of inspection, and is
of a bold and varied description. From the
summit of the second fall an uninterrupted
view of the excellent forest in the Yalley
Creek, and extending beyond Port Hacking
River, is obtained. Immediately below the
falls the foliage is richly varied, comprising
tree ferns, birds’-nest ferns, and other ferns,
cabbage-tree palms, coach wood, and turpen-
tine trees, with a few sassafras trees. Three
quarters of a mile northerly from Waterfall
Creek, upon each side of Port Hacking River,
there is probably the finest forest within 100
miles of Sydney. Within it are blackbutt
trees attaining to the height of about 200
feet, and turpentine trees np to 150 feet.
To the waterfalls, and through the forest in
the valley of the creek below, a line for a
roadway has recently (June, 1886) been
marked upon the ground, to cross Port Hack-
ing River and join Lady Carrington Road,
about |-mile north-easterly from Palm Creek
bridge. This road will shortly be cleared,
and doubtless will become a favourite resort
of pedestrians or horsemen.
III.—PARRAMATTA TO BOURKE—THE WESTERN LINE.
Parramatta.
Parramatta Station, 14 miles; 49 feet
above sea-level. —The traveller proceeding
from the Granville to the Parramatta
Station, first (by a sharp turn and deep
cutting) passes through a short hilly piece
of bush country, and then he has before him
a charming view of Parramatta, with its
many fine churches and other public build-
ings. Parramatta* (originally called “ Rose
Hill ”), situated at the head of the navi-
gation of Parramatta River, communicating
directly with the waters of Port Jackson,
is one of the oldest towns in the Colony.
Indeed it was once, by all accounts, and
curiously enough, intended for the capital,
* Parramatta is connected with Sydney by
steamers, plying to and fro daily on the Parramatta
River, By these steamers, Subiaco, Newington,
Ermington, Kissing Point or Ryde, Gladesville,
Villa Maria, Hunter’s Hill, Biloela, Pitzroy Dock,
and other places on the said river (or rather estuary)
may be most conveniently reached.
or at least the chief seat of Government;
in proof of which it is alleged that St.
John’s Church was (somewhat pretentiously
for those early days) built with its two
towers—exactly copied from the “Reculvers”
in Kent—to serve for a Cathedral. For
many years the Governors continued to
reside here, and the town flourished as the
second place in the Colony. Then, for an
interval, it not only made no progress,
but actually appeared to be hastening to
decay. The Railway, however (which is
said to have destroyed some of the old
inland towns) has most certainly given an
invigorating impetus to the existence of
Parramatta; for it is now, year by year,
extending, and becoming more and more a
distant suburb (as it were) of our sea-side
metropolis. Some fine houses have now
been built near the Railway Station. The
present population of Parramatta is about
8,500 persons. It supports three local news


papers (“ The Cumberland Mercury” “ The
Independent ,” and 11 The Cumberland Times”).
There are numerous Government and chari-
table institutions at Parramatta, such as the
Gaol, the Orphan Schools, the Lunatic and
Benevolent Asylums, &c., &c. There are
several good hotels. There are also in Parra-
matta a Free Public Library, a flourishing
Mechanics’ Institute, three Public Schools,
and six Churches. The King’s School, near
Parramatta Bridge, was long the only gram-
mar school in the Colony, and is still a most
useful scholastic institution ; revived of late
years by the Bev. G. F. Macarthur. The
old Government Domain, which is one of the
prettiest in the Colony, is now utilized as a
beautiful park, belonging to the townspeople.
Mr. Purchase’s and Mr. Sheather’s nurseries
are also well worthy of a visit. Parramatta
has been an incorporated municipality since
the year 1861. The villages and places
which are more or less connected with this
town are—Castle Hill, Dural, Enfield, Field of
Mars, Gannon’s Forest, Guildford, Hornsby,
Liberty Plains, Pennant Hills, and Prospect.
Seven Hills Station, 20 miles; 113 feet
above sea-level. —After leaving the Parra-
matta Station the traveller in the “ down
train” (that is the train proceeding to the
westward) passes over a viaduct, and along
an embankment, from which there is a fine
view of the town and of the neighbouring
country to the north of it. The picturesque
old Georgian brick Parsonage may then be
noticed, yet standing on the hills to the left;
whilst nearer still, lying only a few yards
from the Railroad, the old Burial-ground
claims a passing glance, as the resting-place
of that well-beloved “stainless patriot” Robert
Campbell, and of other historical celebrities.
Further on, and to the right, a glimpse is
next caught of the ci-devant Government
House, with the adjacent undulating glades,
gardens, and shrubberies of the Public Park
—scenes of many a gay and festive event,
and of some very sorrowful ones—the oaks,
pines, and other choice trees, reviving pleas-
ing recollections of a distant fatherland.
Then comes a deep cutting, and the train
sweeps past the site formerly occupied as
the show place of the Australian Agricul-
tural Association—when the yearly exhi-
c
bitions of that body were more local than
national ; chiefly confined to ploughing
matches, and manifestations of cattle, horses,
sheep, fowls, and dogs, and farmers’ ma-
chinery. The country now becomes much
more interesting, frequent orange groves of
dark green foliage, decked with “ the golden
fruit of the gardens of the Hesperides,”
imj)arting a new and delightful charm to the
beauty of an ever-changing landscape. In
the centre of this district a platform called
Toongabbie has been established. Well
grassed apple-tree flats, with undulating and
more open country, and farm-houses, gardens,
and cottages succeed ; until after a run of
6 miles from Parramatta the train stops for
a moment, at the quiet little rural station
of Seven Hills—a locality once, by early
colonists (less ambitiously, and, after a comical
outburst of vice-regal impatience, rather
facetiously) designated as “Nowhere.”
Blacktown Station and Junction, 22
miles ; 183 feet above sea-level. —Two
miles from the Seven Hills Station (through
a somewhat uninteresting but useful country)
stands the station of Blacktown ; a locality
owing its name to an institution which was
unavailingly formed here many years ago by
Governor Macquarie, for the education and
civilization of the aborigines. In the
country between Seven Hills and Blacktown,
on either side of the road, numerous herds
of cattle and flocks of sheep are usually to
be seen, browsing in serene and blissful
unconsciousness of their approaching fate ;
as though abattoirs were things that had no
possible existence, and metropolitan butchers
and their hungry city customers were
nothing but nonentities. As you come
along pretty bits of scenery may here and
there be observed ; open, partially wooded,
hills—with occasional signs of cultivation,
farms, ponds, orchards, and flats—appear to
the right, and orange groves and pretty
country residences are unfolded to the left.
There is, however, nothing here calling for
particular remark ; except, perhaps, a quaint
and unexpected piece of the Old Western
Road, with its broken-down wayside inn,
visible for just a moment, before the Railroad
turns abruptly away to the right, so bring-
ing the railway traveller to the Blacktown


Station. At Blacktown there is a miniature
terminus for the Richmond and Sydney sub-
sidiary branch, which here joins on to the
Western Trunk Line. Blacktown is at present
a small place, chiefly depending on the Rail-
way, with two or three stores and inns of a
humble and unimportant character; but as
land in the vicinity has recently been sub-
divided, and Blacktown forms the depot
intended for goods going to the Prospect
reservoir the place is rapidly waking up. As
the train approaches the Blacktown Station
you catch sight of a distant and limited view
of the far-famed Blue Mountains.
Rooty Hill Station, 25 miles; 131 feet
above sea-level. —After leaving the Black-
town station a lovely view of the Blue
Mountains is disclosed to the right, peeping
over the trees across a flat and uninteresting
country. This tract, immediately adjoining
the line, is but partially wooded, huts and cot-
tages appearing occasionally, some with hold-
ings and gardens, and some without. Before
Rooty Hill is reached (after an interval of 3
miles) there is a grand outline prospect of
the Blue Mountains to the westward, across
an open country, with the seat of Walter
Lamb, Esq., in the distance. Large quantities
of firewood are hence despatched to Sydney.
Through the instrumentality of that well-
known sportsman, Mr. Walter Lamb, a
coursing ground has been established about 1
mile from the station, and at certain periods
very successful coursing meetings, under the
auspices of the Sydney Coursing Club, are held.
St. Marys (formerly South Creek
Station), 29 miles; 113 feet above sea-
level.-The country on either side of the
Railroad, after it passes by the Rooty Hill
Station to the westward is, for the most
part, open, flat, and poor. Here and there
the line passes through the bush, but there
are not many trees near it. Before arriving
at the South Creek Station (which is 18 feet
lower than Rooty Hill), the traveller may
get another fine view of the Blue Mountain
Range, which he is now approaching. St.
Mary’s Station is about 4 miles west of Rooty
Hill, and about half a mile away to the north
of St. Mary’s—an old, pleasant, and prosperous
village, on the Sydney and Penrith Road,
chiefly dependent upon agricultural and
grazing pursuits. Dairy farming, and wine
making are also carried on. Large supplies
of timber and firewood are likewise cut here,
and forwarded by the line to Sydney, for use
on the Railway and for sale. Tanning is
largely carried on at this place, and a large
number of bricks are also made. The prin-
cipal hotels are the “ Commercial” and
“ Volunteer” kept by Messrs. Brynes and
Cullen. Metropolitan sportsmen can often
get a good day’s shooting here, as hares, much
to the annoyance of the farmers, are becom-
ing fairly numerous in the district. South
Creek takes its name from a considerable
tributary to the river Hawkesbury, into
which it eventually flows near Windsor,
Parkes Platform, 31 miles ; about 100
feet above sea-level. —After passing by the
South Creek station a fine view of the Great
Western Highlands is gained to the right of
the line and to the westward. There is then
a flat partially wooded country for 2 miles
until you arrive at the Parkes Platform and
Siding, 3 miles from Penrith.
Penrith Station, 34 miles; 88 feet
above sea-level. —Penrith, 12 miles west of
Blacktown, is a quaint old inland township,
the last station reached by travellers in the
so-called “ down” trains before they begin to
ascend the Blue Mountains. In the “ coach-
ing and bullock-driving days”—when the
neighbouring river had to be crossed by
vehicles in a punt—Penrith was a very bust-
ling and flourishing place, and it appears
sufficiently prosperous at present—certainly
far from going back. It is surrounded by
broad pasture lands, and alluvial plains, of a
great extent and singular fertility ; bounded
westerly by the river Nepean, soon to
assume the better known name of the
Hawkesbury. The town itself is a munici-
pality, with ratable property reported to be
of upwards of £120,000 value ; the popula-
tion of the township was in 1881 1,467 ; it
has 45 miles of streets, roads, and lanes.
There are four churches, belonging respectively
to the Protestant Episcopalian, Roman


NEPEAN RIVER, N.S.W.


Catholic, Presbyterian, and Wesleyan Commu-
nions, and a fine Town Hall has recently been
erected. The course of the Nepean runs
parallel to the town, at the distance of about
a mile from the station, where it is crossed
by a boldly designed and admirably con-
structed iron tubular bridge—supported by
four huge piers of solid masonry, the two
centre ones being 58 by 17 h feet at their
foundation, with an extreme height of 59
feet. These piers are 186 feet apart. Alto-
gether it is one of the finest works of the
kind in the Colony, and of itself worth going
to Penrith to see. (See view of Nepean.)
5 miles to the south of the town the river
flows down northerly through a tremendous
gap in the hills; and, the heights on either
side being well-wooded, many charming effects
are produced. The visitor will find good
accommodation at Mr. Squire’s private estab-
lishment, situated on the banks of the Nepean.
A steam launch is kept here, and by it the
visitor will be enabled to take a trip up the
river. The views of river scenery are
unrivalled, and 12 miles from Penrith, near
where the Warragamba flows into theNepean,
you will reach the basin, an immense natural
bath. The depth of the water in it has never
yet been ascertained. A writer says, “It
would be difficult to conceive scenery more
beautiful than that which characterises the
junction of the Nepean with the Warragamba.
The Blue Mountains close in upon the rivers,
while the latter winds round about all the
points and corners as though loath to leave
places so pleasant,” There are several good
inns in Penrith, one of these being not far
from the station. Penrith is the place of
nomination for the Nepean Electorate. The
places near Penrith (besides those already
mentioned as having been traversed by the
line), are Mulgoa, Greendale, Regentsville,
Luddenham, Bringelly, Castlereagh, and
Emu.
Emu Plains Station, 36 miles ; 87 feet
above sea-level. The attention of the
traveller by the train leaving Penrith for the
mountains must (even previous to his arrival
at the tubular bridge over the Nepean) be
agreeably occupied with the scenery before
him to the westward, where he observes
verdant plains, fringed in the distance by the
winding edge of a rolling country, the grassy
knolls of which are pleasingly dotted here
and there with clumps of trees. Beyond this
charming picture the majestic “ Blue Moun-
tains ” rise abruptly, like a vast natural
fortification, overgrown almost everywhere
with sombre foliage, and extending for many
miles from the south to the north towards
Castlereagh, their base being washed by the
Nepean. (See view of the Nepean — evening .)
Along the broken face of this grand barrier,
not cerulean here but dark , green , and grey,
the Railway line may be seen winding up-
wards—past huge rocks and deep declivities,
alternating with dense woods, the noble
viaduct across Knapsack Gully being hence
already distinguishable. The train sweeps
noisily over the tubular bridge above des-
cribed ; crosses the rich alluvial plain beyond
the river and under cultivation—where grain,
fruit, and vegetables appear to be the chief
products—and at the distance of 2 miles from
Penrith, quickly reaches the Emu Plains
Station, where the first ridge of the moun-
tain begins. This station commands a com-
prehensive view of the First Zigzag, by means
of which the heights of Lapstone Hill are to
be gained and passed. The immediate neigh-
bourhood of the Emu Plains Station (having
been successfully occupied as an agricultural
settlement from the earliest day of the
Colony) presents many pretty rural pictures
of gardens, orchards, corn-fields, homesteads,
and villages —assimilating, in many of its
features, to portions of moorland scenery in
the west of England.
Lucasville Platform, 39 miles ; about
700 feet above sea-level. —Lucasville Plat-
form—standing on the upper edge of the
eastern face of the Blue Mountains, where
the line turns off to the westward —is merely
a solitary spot at which the train stops when
signalled for; but between it and the Emu
Plains Station beneath there is a shifting
series of panoramic views of all the lowland
country in the county of Cumberland, such
as for extent and beauty can hardly be sur-
passed. As you leave the Emu Plains Station
and begin gradually to ascend the steep in-
cline—away to the south towards Mulgoa,
Greendale, and Luddenham—your eyes can
first feast themselves for a moment on that


fair prospect in mid distance—the already
mentioned Gorge of the Nepean. Then, a
few yards further on, as the train rises more
slowly towards the First Zigzag, you are carried
past trees and woodland scenery to the left,
with a deep gully (or “ghyll,” as Wordsworth
would have termed it) to the right; after
which, “ as from the stroke of an enchanter’s
wand,” a wide and magnificent expanse of
level county, stretching away far below,
bursts, in all its unexpected glory, upon your
dazzled sight. In this great range of open
plains—the extreme limits of which are faintly
defined by the ethereal outlines of the light
blue hills on the coast—the town of Penrith
(at the distance of 4 or 5 miles) is displayed
to the greatest advantage, with its public
buildings and churches on the other side of
the Nepean. The winding course of this
truly royal stream, stretching for miles and
miles like a broad blue “ garter ribbon,” is
seen traversing the westerly portion of this
unequalled champaign, the land near to its
banks being, for the most part, treeless;
although a long thick belt of forest land-
more or less enveloped in hazy atmospheric
tints of grey, cobalt, or purple—is visible
beyond the plains. All the nearer portion
of the lowlands is either cultivated or laid
out in bright verdant pastures, especially
round about Penrith, along the Nepean, and
to the north-eastward; the open country
being dotted here and there with villages,
farms, homesteads, and orangeries—and in-
tersected by narrow roads and picturesque
remnants of forest. As you continue to rise,
and shift from slope to slope of the “ Zigzag,”
the prospect before you is more and more
displayed,—back to the south-east, towards
Camden, and directly to the southward,
whence the Nepean flows placidly down, from
the junction of the Oowpasture and Warra-
gamba Rivers, on its way to the distant sea.
You have by this time arrived at the Knap-
sack Gully Viaduct (245 feet above Emu
Plains), boldly erected across a steep and
stony gorge by the genius of the Engineer-
in-chief John Whitton. This admirable and
imposing structure (which Imperial Rome,
in her palmy days, might have been proud
to claim), consists of seven successive
arches—five of 50 feet span, and two of 20.
It is of solid masonry throughout, the
stones having been set in the best Portland
cement—built for a single line of railway,
and with an incline along it of 1 foot in 30
feet. The length of this viaduct is 388 feet,
and its greatest height, from the foundation
in the rock to the level of the rails, is 126
feet. Several panoramic views of Cumber-
land increasingly developed are shown to the
traveller and abruptly withdrawn, as the
train proceeds. First, it goes 200 or 300
yards in one direction, rising slowly every
yard until it stops; then, by the co-operation
of the skilled engineer and the watchful
pointsman, the train is quickly “reversed”
and launched back upon another ascending
gradient, in an opposite direction, up to a
corresponding point. From that, the zigzag
mode of progression is once more resumed;
until at length (by successive changes of direc-
tion, and in an incredibly short time) the
train is found to have deftly climbed to an
elevation of nearly 700 feet. The consequent
alteration of climate at the top of the Zigzag
is very remarkable ; exhilarating and sudden,
not unlike what may sometimes be experi-
enced after ascending to the summit of a very
lofty tower, like the campanile of the Town
Hall of Sydney. This mode of ascent inci-
dentally develops in a very striking manner
the beauty and the variety of the scenery.
Glenbrook Platform, 41 miles; 766 feet
above sea-level. —After passing the Lucas-
ville Platform the line is continued, first
westerly, and then with a bend to the north-
ward, until after an interval of rather more
than 2 miles the summit of Lapstone Hill,
near “ The Old Pilgrim Inn,” is attained.
About half way between Lucasville Platform
and the summit of the hill is Glenbrook,
formerly known as Brookdale or Wascoe’s
Siding, where water for the engine is obtained.
This platform is properly the first of the
mountain stations and on the comparatively
level land running alongside the railway
between here and Mount Victoria, numerous
country residences have been erected which
provide a cool and quiet retreat for busy
city workers in the summer time “after the
heat and burden of the day ” Glenbrook
is well laid out and the provision of wide
reserves will in time make this place very
attractive.


Emu Plains, from “Lucasville.”


* Blaxland’s Platform, 42 miles ; 766
feet above sea-level.— This platform, for-
merly designated “Wascoe’s,” is 1 mile north
of Glenbrook. An accommodation house has
been established here for visitors who desire to
make a stay. Many fine views can be obtained
in the vicinity of the platform, and the gullies
abound in choice specimens of ferns and
flowers. Leaving Blaxland (about half a
mile from “ The Old Pilgrim Inn”) the line
directly proceeds to follow the main range,
dividing the tributaries of the Nepean and
the Cox from those of the Grose River, to
the north and to the north-westward. The
Railroad naturally winds considerably as it
follows the top of the range, but takes for the
most part a north-westerly direction, continu-
ing still to rise until it comes to Springwood,
rather more than 4 miles further on.
The Valley Platform, 46 miles ; 1,048
feet above sea-level. —Near this quaintly-
named platform in the breezy highlands
stands “Wyoming,” on the north side of
the Railroad, with its pretty garden and
grounds. Wyoming offers excellent accom-
modation for visitors. Near by is the post
and telegraph office, and the country resi-
dences of Mr. Russell, Mr. John Rae, The
Hon. Geoffrey Eagar, Mr. Deane, and other
citizens, who have sought here the re-in-
* The nomenclature of three of the stations on
the Western line of Railway has recently been
changed, viz., Wascoe’s, now named “Blaxland,”
Blue Mountain, now named “Lawson,” and
Weatherboard, now named “ Wentworth Falls,” to
commemorate the first successful exploration of the
Blue Mountains. “It was not till 1813 that a
route across these mountains was discovered. A
severe drought had aroused grave apprehensions for
the safety of the flocks and herds of the Colony,
which were even at that early date beginning to be
appreciated at their true value. Many an arduous
search for water was the result. At length, when
every resource was apparently about to fail, Mr.
Wentworth, the pioneer of material and social pro-
gress in Australia, in conjunction with Messrs.
Blaxland and Lawson, organized an exploring party
to endeavour to penetrate to the interior through
some of the mountain gorges. After encountering
many difficulties the party were fortunate enough
to discover a pass by way of the valley of the
Grose, which soon led them to the laud of plenty,
and the route was immediately marked out as the
highway to the interior, and has ever since formed
part of the old Great Western Road. The Railway
follows nearly the same course.”
vigoration of mountain air and the refined
pleasure afforded by the contemplation of
beautiful scenery. “The Valley ” derives
its name from a very lovely far-off prospect
commanded herefrom down the valley (which
is beautifully grassed, open, and park-like)
to the eastward towards the Nepean. A
considerable extent of land has of late years
been here taken up on the ridge to the north
of this hamlet, and west of Fitzgerald’s Gfully,
dividing the watersheds of the Grose and the
Nepean. This gully or creek is well worth a
visit, and has the recommendation of being
convenient to the station and easy of access.
Springwood Platform, 47 miles ; 1,216
feet above sea-level. —Leaving the charm-
ing little mountain village designated “ The
Valley,” the Railroad winds away westerly
for a mile, and after rising 100 feet it
brings the traveller to Springwood. The
visitor to Springwood will find excellent hotel
accommodation at the Royal, immediately
opposite the station, or accommodation can
be secured at Martyn’s Hotel, a short dis-
tance off. The chief site at Springwood
is Sassafras—so called from the number of
sassafras trees—or Flying Fox Gully. For-
merly in the fruit season the trees were black
with thousands of those strange creatures,
half animal, half bird—flying foxes—and the
sportsman could have plenty of sport, while
doing a good service to the fruit-growers, but
the flying foxes have recently been so much
hunted that they have sought fresh haunts.
The road to the gully starts from the back
of the Hon. J. B. Hoare’s new residence.
After a walk of about three-quarters of a
mile, the visitor leaves the main track, to take
a not well defined one on the right.—lt would
add much to the convenience of visitors if a
finger-post were placed at this junction and
the road to the gully better cleared.—After
following this track for a short distance the
head of the gully is reached, and the visitor
descends and follows the course of a stream
which increases in volume as it flows on.
From the stream the sides of the gully,
thickly timbered, run up in places to three
or four hundred feet. The gully contains
several small but pretty waterfalls. Some
little distance down there are some large ponds
of water, the largest being at the junction of


Sassafras with Clear Water Gully, and here
the luxury of bathing may be enjoyed. The
gully is the home of many varieties of ferns,
fine specimens of the tree, staghorn, and
bird’s-nest ferns growing here in profusion;
there are also splendid specimens of the
sassafras trees, which unite overhead and
give a grateful shade. In addition to Sassa-
fras there is a pretty glen called Madeline,
opposite and but a few yards from the
station. Springwood is said to be one of
the finest places on the mountains for all
kinds of ferns and lycopods. It possesses an
equable climate—in winter it is not too cold,
and in summer the mountain air, morning and
evening, is fresh and cool. A number of
influential gentlemen have residences here,
including the Hon. James Norton and the
Hon. Mr. 0. Moore.
Faulconbridge Platform, 49 miles;
1,463 feet above sea-level. —Still following
the topmost ridge of the mountains to the
westward for 2 miles further by a sinuous
course, the traveller reaches the Faulcon-
bridge Platform, named from the adjoining
property of Sir Henry Parkes, about 500
acres in extent, and chiefly valuable perhaps
for the salubrity of its situation and the
singular beauty of the scenery it commands
to the southward, —overlooking a rugged and
broken country forming part of the water-
shed of the Nepean. In the neighbourhood
of Sir Henry Parkes’s residence —a pretty
mountain chdlet , the Terraced Gardens, the
Rocklily Glen and the Rocklily Cave, are
very characteristic and charming localities
much admired by visitors. As you pass
Faulconbridge to the westward, the top of
Mount Hay becomes visible about 9 miles to
the north-westward. The scenery on either
side of the road now becomes intensely
interesting, presenting surprises which seem
like gorgeous glimpses of fairy-land, so sud-
denly are they manifested and withdrawn.*
* A recently published work of standard merit,
compiled under authority by Mr. James Tingle,
speaking of the Hartley District, says : “We have
said that this is a remarkable district, and justly
so, because for magnificence of scenery, wealth of
mineral resources, and monuments of engineering
skill, it is probably without a rival in the southern
hemisphere. The Blue Mountains, with their in-
numerable hills and ravines, present extensive
panoramas of the grandest description. As the
Numantia Platform, 52 miles; 1,672
feet above sea-level. —When the train has
passed the platform at Faulconbridge its
course for a few hundred yards is due west;
it runs south-south-west for about a mile,
passes the residence of Mr. A. H. M‘Culloch,
M.P., on the left, and so trending somewhat
westerly reaches the platform at Numantia—
the classical name selected for the mountain
residence of His Honor Sir James Martin,
the Chief Justice. Numantia lies 3 miles
from Faulconbridge,—to the south-west of it.
There are some good views from Numantia
to the southward.
Linden Platform, 62 miles. —This place,
recently established, is more useful at present
to the Department than to the public. The
scenery in the vicinity is singularly wild and
romantic, and the bush abounds in a great
wealth of ferns and wild flowers. Here the
engines take water, the supply being drawn
from a dam romantically lying in the basin
of the hills about a mile from the station.
Woodford (late Buss’s) Platform, 55
miles ; 2,191 feet above sea-level. —As
the traveller proceeds on his journey west-
ward past Numantia, he can catch a lovely but
fleeting glimpse of home view scenery to the
northward; another view—nearly in the same
direction —of the Pass of Broken Back in the
far off Sugar-loaf Range, in the county of
Northumberland ; two views over the rugged
ravines to the southward and south-eastward;
and distant but approaching views of Mount
Hay and Mount King George. The line
after leaving the Numantia Platform takes a
sharp turn to the southward, and continues
on the ridge in that direction for nearly 2
miles, in the middle of which stands a hand-
some stone gate-house where the Old Road
(which has been running parallel with the
Railroad nearly all the way from “Blaxland”)
traveller in the Railway is sped along the summit
of the range, and catches glimpses of the thousand
valleys stretching like ocean waves to the horizon,
on both sides of the line (which for a considerable
distance is laid on a narrow causeway that looks as
if built up for thousands of feet out of awful depths
of precipice and ravine), he finds it difficult to
imagine a nobler representation of the grandeur and
sublimity of nature.”— Sands’ Official Post Office
Country Directory and Gazetteer of New South
Wales for 1878, 1879, page 267.


Residence of A. H McCulloch, Esq., M.P.


again crosses the line. The gate is now but
seldom opened, for the Old Road is practically
superseded, by the Railway. This gate-house
is 53 miles from Sydney. 1 mile south-west
of this gate-house and 2 miles in the same
direction from Numantia stands the Woodford
Platform, about 520 feet higher than Nu-
mantia and Alphington, <fec. Mr. Alfred
Fairfax’s late residence and large gardens
(Woodford), from which the Woodford Plat-
form takes its name, has been opened for the
accommodation of visitors. Before you get
to Woodford there are several fine glimpses
of scenery, and especially the grand unfolding
of a long pale blue broken line of mountains
in the extreme distance to the north-eastward
beyond the Brisbane Water district, and in
the direction of Maitland. Woodford is only
3 miles from Numantia; and, although
perhaps somewhat exposed in wintry weather,
it is noted for its fine bracing atmosphere,
which resembles that of the more elevated
portions of the West of England.
Lawson Station (“ Blue Mountains”),
58 miles; 2,399 feet above sea-level. —At
about 1 mile due west from the Woodford
platform the line takes a turn and runs for
a mile to the west-north-west; then due west
for another mile, and then west-south-west for
a fourth mile; to the “Old Blue Mountain Inn
Station,” now proposed to be distinguished
by the name of “Lawson”—the vague,
equivocal designation of “ Blue Mountains,”
often misleading unobservant travellers.
Lawson has a telegraph station and post
office, &c. Close to the station are establish-
ments where accommodation can be secured.
Lawson is noted for having near it several
views of great beauty and deep interest on
either side of the line, and at comparatively
short distances in places easy of access. This
place is much resorted to by invalids, who
can here without fatigue enjoy the mountain
scenery, and the pure, invigorating air.
There is a fine prospect to the north from
near the station. It takes the railway
traveller about three hours and a half to
arrive here by train from Sydney, and about
two hours to come up to this spot from Penrith.
Here the tourist can conveniently visit the
Adelina Falls (two of 40 feet descent, one of
60, and one of 70 feet), or the Junction Falls
on the south side of the line; with Dante’s
Glen and three other waterfalls on the
northern side—one of 40 feet, one of 90, and
one (the most remarkable of them all) with a
descent of 120 feet. Perhaps a short descrip-
tion of these two adjacent localities may not
be unacceptable to the reader.
The Adelina Falls. —The Adelina Falls
are, all four of them, grouped together,
at a distance of a mile or so to the south-
eastward of the station; and from the plat-
form to the first and most important of
these beautiful cascades (see View) there
is an excellently formed road, by which the
visitor soon arrives at the edge of a line
of rock, whence he can readily descend into
the immediate vicinity of the waterfall by a
convenient flight of rudely constructed steps.
A smooth path leads him from the foot of
the steps straight down to a craig on the
eastern side of a small ravine, over the
rocky (northern) wall of which the clear cold
Avaters of a mountain stream leap headlong
into an abyss. These Falls—the Adelina
Falls —are not less than 70 feet in their
unbroken descent, and are justly admired,
tumbling over a mass of dark shining rock
into the scene of sylvan beauty represented
by our artist. This water-formed chasm (or
“ghwyll” as the Welsh would call it) is
fringed with masses of green brushwood and
long reedy grass, well shaded everywhere by
the white-trunked eucalyptus, the narrow
semi-circular valley itself, into which the
streamlet dashes, being partially filled up
Avith tall straggling gum-trees. Near the
base of the grand cascade there is a fine dis-
play of ferns and such like plants. Ferns
and creepers overhang this beautiful water-
fall like waving tresses, and bedeck the
sombre wall of cliff over which the sparkling
rivulet descends. Near to this Fall are
several elegant coachwood trees and other
arborescents such as are usually seen in
these moist and secluded localities. The air
is deliciously fresh and cool, even during the
hottest summer day. Seated in the shade—
from his dry and elevated look-out on the
solid rock—the visitor may pass many an hour
of delicious repose listening to the murmuring
plash of the water, the faint whisper of the
wind, and the joyous “ sweet jargoning” of


the birds. To reach the three other cascades
on the south of the road, the visitor must
cross the head of the Adelina Falls —an old
track to the westward, here running south-
easterly, being available for that purpose.
The streamlet is one of the many minor
tributaries of the Cox, a river which falls
into theWarragamba, destined, when joined to
the Cowpasture River, to become the Nepean.
Dante’s Glen and Waterfalls.— Leaving
the Blue Mountain or Lawson Station, and
proceeding for a few yards to the north-
north-west, by a well-formed road, the visitor
passes two stone tanks or reservoirs for the
supply of the engines with water ; and then
following a recently cleared downward path,
trending northerly, he arrives (after walking
for about half-a-mile) at the edge of a sloping
reedy marsh draining into the watershed of
the Grose. A little beyond the eastern
extremity of this out-of-the-way and desolate
spot, a rough but well-defined path for
awhile leads him on, until at length by an
abrupt descent he reaches the precipitous
side of a wide and dark tree-shaded valley,
suddenly revealed in all its immensity, and
resounding with the continuous rush of con-
cealed waters in its mysterious depths. _ The
lonely devious path and the steep declivities
of this cavernous glen are difficult enough
and wild enough to remind the student of the
“ selva oscura” mentioned in the opening of
the grand and gloomy poem of the “im-
mortal Florentine,” there being a weird
character about the whole place calculated to
inspire the soul with admiration and with
awe. Hence, doubtless, the expressive name
of Dante’s Glen by which this valley has
lately been distinguished. In Dante’s Glen
there are three waterfalls which can be
reached by an adventurous and active tourist.
The first—about three-quarters of a mile
from the station —is seen to the right, soon
after you enter the glen. The easterly stream
here falls over a ledge of rock to a depth of
40 feet, and becomes invisible during the
rest of its course down the valley. Beneath
this first, a few chains further on, there is a
second waterfall of 90 feet. A small steep
track leads down towards both of these from
the topmost ridge of the valley. The lower
portion of the path thus winding down into
this sequestered locality is thickly wooded,
and ends in two deep precipitous gorges,
uniting at an inaccessible rocky northern
outlet. To the right is the lower (or second)
cascade already mentioned —the largest water-
fall of all three being away in the gully up
to the left. The western extremity of this
intersecting ravine is a huge black cliff,
hemmed in on all sides by tall trees, and
overhung with ferns, creepers, and parasitical
plants. Over this dark precipice a fine
stream falls 120 feet in sheer descent, its
broken feathery sprays being caught and
collected at the foot of the cliff in a basin
like a Naiad’s bath hollowed out of a fiat
rock. The course of this stream, descending
therefrom to its junction with the other, is,
like the rest of the glen, densely timbered
with coachwood, tree ferns, a kind of alder,
and sassafras. There is a rocky shelf beside
the pellucid pool at the bottom of the cata-
ract, curiously over-arched by the cliff, and of
course a favourite haunt for excursionists.
You can pass right under this Fall if you
choose to be so foolhardy, but you had much
better not do so, for the feat is not unattended
with danger. Looked up to from the end of
the over-arched ledge above referred to, the
effect of this waterfall is exceeding solemn and
grand. It has been justly said by an excel-
lent authority (Burton); “There is nothing
more beautiful to be seen in the whole of the
Blue Mountains than this wonderful spot.”
In addition to the views fully described,
there are many other scenes of great beauty
around Lawson —one of these, the Junction
Falls, is reached by following a track leading
from the Adelina Falls j after a short walk
the visitor reaches a lonely glen which is
almost hidden with magnificent ferns. Here
three creeks empty their waters into the
glen forming three separate and pretty water-
falls. Another waterfall and romantic glen
in which some splendid fern-trees are growing,
are reached by following the main road west-
ward for about 2 miles, and then turning off
at a track leading to the left. The track is
not, at present however clearly marked, and
the services of a guide will almost be required
to reach the spot.
Wentworth Falls, or Weatherboard
Platform, 62 miles; 2,856 feet above


Wentworth Falls.


sea-level —On leaving Lawson Station near
the “ Old Blue Mountain Inn,” the line runs
for 2 miles along the ridge to the west-
south-west, and then (by a sharp turn) trends
west-north-west for 2 miles further, when it
reaches the locality generally known as the
“Weatherboard,” where there is a platform
and a pointsman’s house. The railway ex-
cursionist is now on the confines of that
considerable extent of level ground upon the
mountains, about 24 miles in length, and
formerly known by the appellation of “ The
King’s Table-land,” a name given to it (as
early chroniclers inform us) by Governor
Macquarie himself, during an adventurous
vice-regal tour in this direction, when deeply
impressed with the “ majestic grandeur of the
situation, combined with the various objects
to be seen from the spot.” On the south-
west side of this table-land the mountain
terminates, as an old colonial annalist informs
us, “in abrupt precipices of immense depth;
at the bottom of which is seen a glen as
romantically beautiful as can well be imagined,
bounded on the further side by mountains of
great magnitude, terminating as abruptly as
the others, and the whole thickly covered with
timber.” The glen thus graphically described
—and named Prince Regent’s Glen by Gover-
nor Macquarie—appears to be identical with
one of the north-westerly prolongations or
branches of that great Cunimbla Yalley,
which is now known to be more or less con-
nected (at its north-westerly extreme) with
the beautiful Yalley of Hartley. The name
of “ Prince Regent’s Glen” should therefore
now, perhaps be judiciously restricted to a
north-westerly and less extensive ravine,
reaching from its intersection with the great
Ounimbla Yalley back to an abrupt rocky
end in the neighbourhood of the far-famed
Waterfall of the Weatherboard, the true
historical appellation of which, by the way, is
Campbell’s Cataract —a name bestowed upon
it by Governor Macquarie in honor of the
Colonial Secretary of the period. The upper
or north-westerly extreme of Prince Regent’s
Glen is, it may be remarked, of a somewhat
circular form, presenting a grand coup d’cdl
of mountains rising beyond mountains, with
stupendous masses of cliffs in the foreground
and in mid distance, reaching almost round
the vast and deep well-wooded hollow to the
west and to the southward; except, indeed,
where the Prince Regent’s Glen opens out
on to the great sunken valley above-men-
tioned, and so displays a glorious, many-tinted
and distant view of vast shadowy walls of
precipice on the other side of that valley,
many long miles away. This circular termi-
nation of the Prince Regent’s Glen, at its
northernmost end, was named by Governor
Macquarie the “ Pitt Amphitheatre” in honor
of the Right Honorable William Pitt, and is
what is usually referred to by tourists under
the very vague and most inexpressive name
of the Weatherboard. From any good point
on King’s Table-land—such, for example,
as the verandah of Mr. Charles Wilson’s
accommodation house, about 2,900 feet above
the sea-level—the light-house at the Sydney
South Head, on a clear night, looking due
east, is distinctly visible at a distance of 62
miles. The same well-known beacon can,
it is said, at times, be seen from Blackheath,
nearly 500 feet higher, and 11 miles further
away from the coast.
General Description of the Weather-
board.—Mr. C. A. Wilson’s accommodation
house lies about 50 yards from the points-
man’s house, on the southern side of the
Railway, not far from the semaphore, and an
old powder magazine in the open—both con-
spicuous objects. Near the semaphore is a
tombstone—“ Sacred to the memory of James
Ferguson, who was killed by lightning on
21st December, 1859 ; aged 22 years and 10
months.” Foi’merly, as it would appear,
there was a burial-ground now traversed
by the Railway in this secluded spot,
of which this now seems to be the sole
remaining tomb. A few cottages are to
be found in the vicinity. The air is fresh
and wholesome, as might be expected at such
an elevation; but in stormy weather it is
not a locality where there is much that can
be pleasant for the tourist out of doors.
The old Western Road, between the Weather-
board and Blackheath, is now almost wholly
disused, except when fat cattle are occa-
sionally driven over it by night. In many
places this picturesque old road is utterly
dilapidated, torn and worn away by the
wind and rain. At the back of Wilson’s
there is a ruined bridge, through the broken


arch of which a fine stream (Jamison’s Creek)
flows away southerly for or 2 miles to
the neighbouring gorge. The road to the
Weatherboard Falls from the so-called
“ station ” leads by this broken bridge,
through the bush south-westerly to the edge
of that celebrated chasm and most enchant-
ing view. There is also a pleasant walk on
the north side of the line, to the north-west
of the semaphore. North of the Railroad,
but somewhat more to the eastward, lies the
winding track to “ The Water Nymph’s
Dell,” which is difficult to find unless under
the guidance of some resident.
Visit to the Weatherboard Gorge and
Falls. —“ Starting from the accommodation
house with a guide, I crossed,” says a recent
visitor, “ the ruined bridge at the back of
Wilson’s, struck into the bush to the south-
west, and—after walking along a pretty fair
road for about 1|- mile—l reached at the end
of a rather devious path the framework of a
hut erected by the Government for tourists
and others, and wantonly and basely de-
stroyed (like that at Govett’s Leap) by
thoughtless or selfish persons. (A commodi-
ous hut has since been built here.) From the
elevated point thus arrived at on the topmost
edge of this titanic gorge, there is a steep
and almost precipitous descent to the south-
ward, partly shaded with stunted trees, and
terminating—after passing a flight of steps,
cut boldly out of the solid rock—in a broad,
natural platform of waterworn stone, immedi-
ately opposite to “ The Campbell Cataract,”
or Falls, and overlooking that vast amphi-
theatre named after the renowned statesman
William Pitt, which here terminates the
Prince Regent’s Glen. The platform seems
actually to overhang the Great Falls, which
are, however, at some distance from it
to the left (the eastward), across a huge
semi-circular abyss, hollowed out of red and
grey rocks, and overshadowed everywhere with
trees and ferns. In front of the spectator is
the chasm’s edge, stretching along like the
elevated margin of a bay ; and beyond this
rough but well-defined line is that fairy-land
of mountain, cliff, and forest which no pencil
can perfectly depict or pen adequately de-
scribe. To the left is a small tract of barren
and mountainous country, of an immense
altitude, coming up from the southward, and
forming the easterly frame of this vast and
marvellous picture. Its westerly frame pre-
sents rude cliffs and a wooden talus towards
the entrance to the Pitt Amphitheatre ; and
on its upper surface are seen mountain streams
and rivulets hastening to unite themselves to
the main stream coming from the opposite
direction (Jamison’s Creek) and then to dash
themselves into a cylindrical abyss, whose
falling waters resound in your ears like an
everlasting sigh. Approaching cautiously to
the edge of the platform, or (what is perhaps
more safe) lying down to look over, you
see the stream wildly precipitated over
broad stratified rings of grey, red, and black
rock, into the bottom of this grand moun-
tain glen, a distance of (apparently) not
less than 1,000 feet in sheer descent. The
waters of the cataract drain away into the
far off depths of the densely wooded valley
beneath, the lowermost line of which seems
ultimately to indicate a south-easterly direc-
tion. When I first approached this spot at
about 9 a.m., the falls were threefold in
their development, and stood in a deep and
misty shadow. Near the bottom of the first
fall, breaking into feathery spray, long before
it reaches a slightly projecting mass of
broken fragments of stone, about half-way
down, there is to the south a long thin line
of forest trees, the foliage of which looks
dim and soft when seen from the great
height of the platform on the rock. These
trees, half-way down into the abyss, spread
all along the surface of the small projecting
ledge in the precipitous wall on the eastern
side of the gorge; their irregular masses of
greenery contributing greatly to the charm
of the scene. Below these broken masses
of stone and trees and brushwood a second
dreadful precipice descends, and a second
fall may, by a daring spectator be seen, far
below the dizzy altitude—so far that no
murmur from this and the next succeeding
fall ascends to break the silence. It is only
the everlasting sweep of the upper portion
of the cataract which makes itself distinctly
audible. Below, as I have intimated, the
stream follows unseen its appointed course
through the sylvan depths of that enchanted
valley. Anything more sublime and awe-
inspiring cannot possibly be imagined. On


the western side of the gorge of the Weather-
board, at the distance of about \ a mile,
there is a second wall of parti-coloured rock,
with a huge talus of rocks and trees, and a
towering royal crest of trees and under-
growth. Further away to the south-west-
ward (on the north-west side of the amphi-
theatre) comes an abrupt break; and then
more cliffs and declivities, and another wide
valley of low-lying forest and hill scenery is
displayed, enclosed by another and yet more
extensive range of rocky wall and talus, or
slopes formed of detritus or decayed rock.
This range of brightly-tinted cliffs (in which
deep red colour predominates) trends easterly
for some miles, and at last—having almost
traversed the entire picture —ends with an
abrupt descent into the Prince Regent’s
Glen. Beyond the eastern extremity of the
distinct line thus furnished in mid-distance
is another stretch of woodland, dim and
cerulean in its many shadowy gaps and hol-
lows. Beyond that line again comes another
more shadowy tract in bright cobalt; and
beyond that yet again appear the far off
outlines of a mountainous country, wrapped in
a mantle of denser blue, its summits crowned
with cliffs in exquisitely blended tints of
pink and yellow. Over all that again at
intervals (and especially from the ruined hut)
can be seen an ethereal light blue outline of
lofty hills in the extreme distance. On the
rocky platform which overlooks the Falls,
the aspiring mind of Young Australia has
prompted the inscription of names and sur-
names of parties not yet otherwise distin-
guished. These names have been boldly
carved on the ledge of stone, in the vain hope
of thereby securing some adventitious immor-
tality. The whole of the rocky ledge which
overlooks the gorge is public property, but
some of the land in the vicinity has already
been alienated. ‘The Weeping Rock,’ for
instance, is on private property, belonging to
Mr. D. Fletcher, of Sydney. This ‘ weeping
rock,’ an object of great interest to those
who visit the Weatherboard, stands above
the ‘Great Fall,’ on the east side of the
gorge, and well deserves the name which
has been given to it. The continuous flow
of water which trickles over this curious
half-isolated mass of stone is occasioned by
a rivulet breaking away from the main
stream, known as Jamison's Creek —the same
which feeds the Great Fall, or Campbell’s
Cataract.”
Another description of the Campbell
Cataract and the Gorge at the Weather-
board.-—The following description of the
Campbell Cataract and the adjacent gorge is
taken from Mr. Edwin Burton’s Guide, an
admirably compiled and useful little work.
Mr. Burton’s Guide , page 118, says:—“The
Campbell Cataract is, however, the great
attraction to tourists. The water leaps over
the tremendous precipice into the glen below.
The scene has thus been depicted by the
Bev. Dr. Lang:— ‘ At the point where the
rivulet from the Weatherboard hut discharges
itself there is a break or bay in the line of
cliffs on that side, as if a vast portion of the
wall of rock had been quarried out for the
purpose, the two points appearing from behind
like two lofty headlands jutting out into
the valley, and bearing a remarkable resem-
blance to the Heads of Port Jackson. The
rivulet, which in its course of 2 miles and
a half has been swelled by one or two
smaller streams issuing from lateral valleys
to the size of a common mill-stream, preci-
pitates itself all at once over the rocks at the
head of the bay and is lost in the abyss, the
fall being at least 1,000 feet. On gaining
the edge of the precipice the waters of the
rivulet seem to shrink instinciively from the
frightful leap to which they have been con-
ducted in their course down the valley, each
individual drop appearing endowed with
separate volition, and seeming determined to
shift for itself, and the whole mass of fluid
resolving itself into what appears like innu-
merable particles of frozen snow. Many
hundred feet below, the tops of apparently
lofty trees are seen at the bottom of Prince
Regent’s Glen, and so completely do the
cyclopean walls of rock which form the
glen defy all direct communication between
the heights and the hollow, that the shortest
practicable route from the place where the
rivulet leaps over the precipice to the bottom
of the cliffs, over which it falls, is 16 miles.
Governor Macquarie named the waterfall the
Campbell Cataract, in honor of the Colonial
Secretary of that period. At the time we
visited the Fall there was a strong wind


blowing up the glen. The wind caught the
falling waters before they had time to reach
the bottom, and scattered them into mist,
carrying them to great distances. The sun’s
rays falling on the particles produced the
phenomena of innumerable rainbows, the
effect of the whole scene being indescribably
beautiful.’ Connected with this wonderful
place there is a legend about the inhumanity
of the keeper of a ‘shanty’ near by the
precipice, in the ea.rly days of the Colony.
Before railways were thought of, lucky dig-
gers had to use the road, and this ‘ shanty,’
where grog was sold on the sly, was often
resorted to by those who wanted shelter and
rest. As the story goes —and there are
more improbable stories —the keeper used to
lure them to the precipice, rob them, and
then pitch them over into the valley beneath.
The Falls are about \ \ mile from the railway
platform. There is a small accommodation
house near the platform, where a guide may
be procured. Persons may leave Sydney by
the morning train, visit the Falls, and return
to Sydney the same night.”
The Water Nymph’s Dell.— Directly
opposite to the Weatherboard Station (or
rather Platform) there is a very pretty water-
fall, in a curiously secluded narrow glen;
both waterfall and glen being well worthy of
a visit. You cross the Railroad a little to
the west of the pointsman’s house, and turn
down at once into an adjacent scantily
wooded valley, wherein flowering shrubs and
rushes appear as the principal features. A
path leads down a continuation of this valley
to the eastward, on somewhat firmer ground,
for about a mile and a half ; and then, by an
abrupt turn to the right, a winding and pre-
cipitous track takes you down into the upper
end of a deep and rocky gully. The bottom
and sides of this gully are shaded with tall
trees of coachwood and sassafras, everywhere
interlaced with vines; and in the lower
portions of the gully there is an abundance
of ferns, mosses, and lycopods of all descrip-
tions—some of them very choice and rare.
Tree ferns—the Alsophila australis and the
JDicksonia antarctica) display their graceful
fronds on all sides of you, in this cool um-
brageous place; and when you stand upon
the lower ledge of rock, at the base of the
tortuous path, the pleasant rippling sound of
falling water becomes distinctly audible.
Proceeding further still, the noise of a water-
fall is soon heard, and over the grey cliff
opposite, across the gorge (draped in the
glittering, dark foliage of trees and arbo-
rescent plants) a charming cascade comes
down, whispering and murmuring into the
glen. Following the rough and difficult path
to the westward, up this lovely but lonely
place, the end of the gorge becomes suddenly
revealed. At the termination of the path,
and below the cliff, lies a pool of limpid
water, wherein Egeria herself might not have
disdained to bathe. This pool is supplied by
the waterfall, descending at the back of it,
from the precipice, in several broken rills, for
more than 50 feet. The dark sides of the
rock and the edges of the basin in this Water
Nymph’s Dell are fringed and decked with
mosses and creeping plants of a wonderful
beauty and variety. The path down the hill-
side appears to be by no means an easy one,
but the youthful, smiling guide speaks ad-
miringly of the indomitable energy and
daring of the lady visitors to this beautiful
and romantic spot. Another less hazardous
ramble may be found by leaving the sema-
phore near the line, and following up a
bubbling stream, by the edge of a marsh, to
the north-westward. The visitor may do this
for some considerable distance and find his
gravelly path bordered by a profusion of
mountain flowers, ferns, lycopodiums, and
those other plants which, in Australia, appear
to take the place of the heather in the
uplands of Scotland and other parts of
Europe.
Katoomba Platform, 66 miles ; 3,349
feet above sea-level. —Leaving the plat-
form at the Weatherboard, opposite the
pointsman’s house, the line takes a sinuous
course to the west-south-west for 4 miles,
when it reaches the station at Katoomba.
A few years ago Katoomba was an insignifi-
cant platform on the Western line ; one or
two houses only were in its neighbourhood,
and the traffic to and from the platform was
very small. Now, however, from the opening
up of a coal-field, the establishment of saw-
mills, the discovery of numerous picturesque
views in the vicinity, and on account of its


KUNIMBLA VALLEY, BLUE MOUNTAINS, N.S.W.


splendid climate, Katoomba is fast becoming a
township of some importance. Two large
hotels have been established, one of which,
the “Great Western” (Carrington) is equal to
the “Imperial” at Mount Victoria, for the
amount of accommodation it gives, and for the
excellence of its appointments. Biles hotel,
opposite the station, is a well kept and com-
fortable hostelry. A Public and Private
School has also been erected. Probably there
is no place on the mountains where so many
beautiful views can be so easily and con-
veniently seen within a short distance of the
Railway as at Katoomba. The main attrac-
tion is the Katoomba Falls and the views of
Cunimbla Valley. Passing along a well laid
out road, starting from the southern side of
the Railway Station, the visitor, after a walk
of about a mile, reaches the edge of the
Cunimbla Valley. Here, standing on a
rocky promontory, a glorious view of the
extensive valley is presented, the mounds in
the valley thickly covered with timber, rising
like waves in a deep sea ; afar off on the
opposite side groups of rocks are seen, their
heads mantled with a wreath of white fleecy
clouds, resembling some old baronial castle;
and in the centre of the valley the course of
a creek is clearly marked, its waters as they
flow onward being hidden by a thick growth
of brushwood. Just before reaching the
rocky promontory overlooking the valley the
road crosses the creek which makes the
waterfall, and a considerable body of water is
generally flowing. At Katoomba, unlike the
Weatherboard and Govett’s Leap, the visitor
can reach the bottom of the valley, and the
waterfall is seen best from a point in the
track as it leads to the bottom of the valley.
The track, overhung with ferns and flowering
shrubs, is clearly marked, and for some
distance comparatively easy of descent. Some
little distance down a view is obtained of a
section of the valley, and through an opening
in a thick growth of ferns and umbrageous
trees, the water resembling a beautiful bridal
veil, is seen tumbling down upon the dark
depths of rocks below. The pathway then
passes between two massive rocks, the main
walls of the valley on one side and a detached
mass standing alone on the other. This rock
towering up for a couple of hundred feet like
some turreted castle, receives, on account of
its isolated position, the name of the Orphan
Rock. If the visitor is not afraid of a little
exertion, he can follow the track until it
brings him to the bottom of the valley, where
he will reach the coal drive opened up by Mr.
North. A tramway runs from Katoomba to
the mine ; it is on a gradient of 1 in 2 from
the rocks fringing the valley to the mine—
a stationary engine at the top drawing up
by a wire rope the trucks of coal. In addi-
tion to the coal there is a good seam of shale
in the valley, which promises to create a large
trade. A great deal of the prosperity at
Katoomba is due to the enterprise of Mr.
North in developing the coal and shale mines;
and since the tramway has been made, a saw-
mill has been started in the valley, a large
quantity of timber of excellent quality being
obtainable. In the vicinity of the saw-mill
and mine numerous splendid specimens of
fern trees are to be found. There is much
else to occupy the notice of the visitor at
Katoomba. At the proper season mountain
mosses, ferns, and flowers are numerous and
beautiful. Although the main Katoomba
Falls, on account of their volume, attract the
greater notice, there are others smaller but
not the less beautiful; particularly the Leura
and Lurline Falls.
A writer describing Katoomba, says :
Katoomba is situated on the Blue Moun-
tains, 66 miles from Sydney by rail, and
3,349 feet above seadevel. Leaving the busy
Redfern Railway Terminus, in about thirty
minutes we pass the pretty town of Parra-
matta ; then on either side may be seen some
tine orchards and orange groves, lightly tim-
bered grass lands, hills, and small streams.
We arrive at the quaint old town of Pen-
rith ; here the train stops about ten minutes
for refreshments. Proceeding on our journey
we pass the Nepean River, with its romantic
and picturesque scenery, and its massively
constructed iron tubular bridge. We soon
commence the ascent of the Zigzag, and as
we near the top a grand panorama spreads
out before us. The scene is indescribably
magnificent; we begin to breathe the deli-
ciously cool mountain air, being now about
700 feet above sea-level. The language of
the poet can alone describe the splendour of
the scenery which meets our view as we are


whirled along over gullies and hills; the
hurry graphs of scenery that come and go
like the sliding scales of a magic lantern, the
windows framing picture after picture, till at
length we get a fine view on our left of the
Kanimbla Valley; then there is a grinding
of the brake, and the station-master is seen
bustling about the platform, informing us
that we are at Katoomba. The hotels must,
of necessity, be a subject of interest to those
who visit the Mountains. Of these there are
three, all good and respectable, besides boai’d-
ing-houses for all classes—from those who
take their champagne, to those who hire
humble lodgings and take their own pro-
visions.
The “ GreatWestei’n Hotel” which is situ-
ated on a high eminence just above and to the
left of the station, commands the only real
mountain view to be obtained without travel-
ling some distance fx'om the line. design
of the hotel is on the modern American style,
with a lai-ge flat-top roof, from which can be
seen the city of Sydney and its noted harbour.
It has accommodation for seventy to eighty
persons, contains nearly sixty rooms, consist-
ing of a lai’ge dining-room, general ladies’
drawing-room, and gentlemen’s smoking and
reading-room. These are arranged, with
their necessary retiring rooms, at opposite
ends of the building, while the intermediate
space is divided into suites of private sitting
and bedrooms. A remarkable feature in the
planning of the structure is its large, wide,
and lofty cori’idors, which, in wet weather,
serves admirably as promenades, as also a
lai’ge verandah in front of the building, which
faces the east. All the principal rooms have,
therefore, in summer and winter, the benefit
of the cheerful early morning sun. Gas is
laid on, electric bells, and hot and cold water
baths are fitted to all the rooms. An excel-
lent provision for water-supply is now being
made by means of a Blake’s hydraulic ram,
which is situated in a large spring of water in
the valley, about 1,000 yards distant.
Biles’ Hotel, which is situated imme-
diately to the right of the station, is a large,
well-conducted hotel. Mr. Biles, who it will
be found is a most agreeable Boniface, has a
reputation for the abundance and excellence
of his dinners,
“ Katoomba Hotel,” about | of a mile on
the Bathurst road, is a wayside inn, where
every attention is shown to visitors by Mrs.
Curnow.
The principal sights of Katoomba, all of
which are within easy walking distance of
the hotels, are the following :
Katoomba Falls. —The Katoomba Falls
are as pretty,fund as well worth a visit, as
any on the mountains. Although an excel-
lent view is obtained from the rocks over-
looking the valley, the Falls are seen best by
taking the track on the right, and from an
opening near the Orphan Rock a splendid
view of the Falls and the valley below is
obtained. The Orphan Rock, standing soli-
tary like a sentinel on duty, is a prominent
object from the rocks near the head of the
Falls.
The Witch’s Leap.— By following the
winding path at the foot of the Falls you
will pass Maud’s Wonder, from which can bo
had a splendid view of the Falls and the
Glen, and pursuing the path by the first
opening on the left, the excursionist will
come upon M. Q. Any sound produced here
will be reverberated for several seconds.
Another very good view of the Falls can be
obtained from this point. Passing the Or-
phan Rock, and descending the Gully, the
scene changes at every step. On the right
may be seen the coal-tram emerging out of a
cleft in the rock. Descending a little further
(carefully) the valley can be reached, and fol-
lowing the track to the left past the Saw-
mills you will arrive at the foot of the Falls.
The tree ferns hereabouts are very fine.
The Bluff at Engine Point. —To the left
appears the Three Sisters, in front is the
Corowal or Solitary Mount, and on the ex-
treme left of the Mount and near the top is
the Crouching Lion, inclining to the right is
the Ruined Castle, Megalong, Mount Clear,
and in the distance some 50 miles away are
the Picton and Nattai Ranges.
Grace’s Hill. —From this point you can
see Jamison Valley to the south-east. When
stationed on this hill, the Three Sisters, a
portion of the Kanimbla Valley, Blackheath,
Mount Victoria, and the Boar’s Head, &c.,
can be seen.

The Gap and the Neck of Land. —The
sight of this rugged and grand crater-like
abyss should not be missed by the tourist.
Birdie’s Dell or Silver Spray Water-
fall is an enchanting spot, from which can
be caught a glimpse of the meeting of the
waters at Nelly’s Glen.
Nelly’s Glen is a remarkable gorge ex-
tending from the top of the mountain to the
Kanimbla Yalley, sloping rapidly for about
500 feet, and varying in width from 20 to 60
feet. At the top a meeting of two water-
courses forms the cascade. A thrice repeated
echo is heard here,
Leura and Lurline Falls. —A little above
these will be seen some beautiful cascades,
and the meeting of two water-courses which
flow over beds of moss and rock to the verge
of a precipice, down which it suddenly leaps
in an almost unbroken sheet a descent of 800
feet, creating a deep hollow sound, while the
trembling waters shoot up their silvery spray
sparkling and flashing and foaming with the
dancing sunbeams bright and perfect rain-
bows.
The Fossil Rock is another marvel which
should not be forgotten.
The Coal-mine is well worth a visit. The
tramway is one mile and a quarter in length
from the Railway Siding and the trucks are
drawn by a steel cable, measuring miles
and weighing 5| tons.
The Jenolan (formerly called the
Fish River) Caves. —Many inquiries have
been made as to the new route from Ka-
toomba to the remarkable caves which lie
at a distance of about 18 miles in a straight
line, and in a S.W. by W. direction. As
the journey via Tarana and Oberon is
about 90 miles in length from Katoomba,
a shorter cut has long been a desideratum,
and as a step in this direction the hotel-
keepers of Mount Victoria some years ago
constructed a buggy track from that place
to within 2 miles of the caves. The dis-
tance between the two places is 41 miles,
and from one cause or other this track has
not been made much use of by the public.
Of course, from Katoomba this route, though
shorter than that by Tarana, would also be
very roundabout, and several attempts were
accordingly made to find a track direct;
among others by Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick, of
Burragorang, who was connected with some
mining operations near Katoomba, and who
brought the matter under the notice of the
late Premier (Sir A. Stuart) on one of his
visits to that favourite resort. The result
was that first Mr. Eossbach, road surveyor,
and, later on, Mr. W. M. Cooper, Surveyor
of Public Parks, were sent to inspect and
report on the feasibility of the route and to
find the best line for a horse track. Mr.
Rossbach’s inspection was only a prelimi-
nary one, extending over a single day; Mr.
Cooper, who followed, spent ten days on the
work, and marked out a line from end to
end. The number of detours necessary to
carry a track with reasonable gradients
over so mountainous a country caused the
distance traversed to be 23 miles from the
starting point, or from the “Great
Western Hotel,” Katoomba. Special care
was taken to mark the line, so that it could
not easily be mistaken, by blazing trees in
a distinctive manner, and by affixing to the
trees at various intervals, corresponding
to the nature of the ground, squares, or
rather diamonds, of white calico, with black
figures conspicuously printed thereon, run-
ning consecutively from 1 to 105. The
work was completed in April, 1884, and
the following is a description of the route
which has been adopted between the two
places, and of the country passed through
on the way. A number of persons have
already made the journey on foot; any one
accustomed to walking can do it comfortably
in twelve hours; and as the track becomes
opened up, an increasing number of seekers
after health and pleasure combined will pro-
bably follow their example. When the
proposed horse-track is completed it will
be a very enjoyable ride of five hours.
There is a good deal of variety and interest
in the scene en route, and a short account
of its principal features will doubtless prove
acceptable to tourists, whether on foot or
horseback.


Of the nature of the country passed
through it may be generally remarked that
it consists, first, of the great depression of
the Cox Valley, some 7 miles wide and 2,500
feet deep, and then of three spurs of the
Main Dividing Eange of the Colony, the
range itself being followed for about a
mile, but not crossed, and attaining the
summit level of 4,040 feet at 2H miles from
Katoomba.
On leaving Katoomba, the Main Western
Road is followed for mile until the
Explorer’s Tree is reached. This is a
venerable relic of the early history of the
Colony, an old battered W and L cut in its
trunk (the B which was originally also there
having become obliterated by decay) telling
the story of the first successful attempt made
to surmount the hitherto impassable Blue
Mountains and penetrate the unknown in-
terior, by Wentworth, Lawson, and Blaxland.
The tree is fenced round and buttressed
with masonry, and bears the following in-
scription affixed thereto :
This wall and fence has (sic) heen erected hy the
Hon, J. S. Farnell, Esq., Minister for Lands, to
preserve this tree marked by
Blaxland,
Lawson,
Wentworth,
being the farthest distance reached in their first at-
tempt to cross the Blue Mountains in the month of
May,
a.d. 1813.
The expedition, which consisted of William
Charles Wentworth, Gregory Blaxland, and
Lieutenant William Lawson, started from
South Creek, near Penrith, the residence of
Mr. Blaxland, on May 11,1813, and reached
its farthest point on June I. The following
passage from Oxley’s Journal refers to the
state of things at this time: —
They now conceived that they had sufficiently ac-
complished the design of their undertaking, having
surmounted all the difficulties which had hitherto
prevented the interior of the country from being ex-
plored. They had partly cleared, or at least marked
out, a road by which the passage of the mountain
might be easily effected. Their provisions were nearly
expended, their clothes and shoes were in very bad
condition, and the whole party were ill with bowel
complaints.
Tbe expedition completed its return to
South Creek on June 6, having thus been
out less than a month. In order to do justice
to the courage, perseverance, and public
spirit displayed on this expedition, it should
be remarked that many previous attempts to
penetrate the barrier of the Blue Mountains
had returned unsuccessful, the first of which
was undertaken by George Bass in 1796.
Bass reported, on his return, that it was
“ impossible to find a passage, even for a
person on foot.” In consequence of the
success of the former expedition, Governor
Macquarie dispatched George William
Evans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands, to extend
the discoveries. He crossed the Nepean on
the 20th November, 1813, arrived at the ter-
mination of Messrs. Wentworth, Blaxland,
and Lawson’s journey on the 26th, and pro-
secuted his undertaking for about 100 miles
further to the west to the Bathurst Plains.
On December 18 he commenced his return,
and on January 8, 1814, he arrived home
again. The construction of a road across
the mountains was immediately commenced,
and carried on so vigorously that on January
21, 1815, it was completed from Sydney to
Bathurst.
At this point the route to the caves com-
mences, following at first a cart track, which
turns off to the left, and presently turning
off to the left again it arrives (2 miles from
Katoomba) at the head of the Megalong
Cleft. This is a narrow chasm in the great
sandstone wall, which is so remarkable a
feature in the Blue Mountain scenery. It
is quite practicable for travellers on foot,
though steep and slushy, from the constant
trickling of water from its head and sides,
and almost filled with magnificent tree and
other ferns, which thrive luxuriantly in the
constant shade and damp. Halfway down
the steep incline the musical sound of
falling water is heard, and a cascade of
some 30 ft. in height is seen on the left.
The cleft is about 3,280 ft. above the sea at
the top (Katoomba is 3,350) and 2,690 at
the foot, thus making a descent of some
600 ft. in 21 chains, or an average grade of
1 in 2i, which might be improved by zig-
zaging to 1 in 5 or 6. On emerging from this
gorge of gloom, profound even at mid-day,
and from many points further on, striking
views are obtained of the long line of sand-
stone cliffs behind and on each side, the


outlines and the great masses of light and
shade being very bold and varied, and the
colouring of yellow, red, purple, and green
superb. In many places the cliff overhangs,
and one craggy mass to the west of the cleft
bears a strong resemblance to a huge castle,
with its great square towers, battlements,
buttresses, and turrets, even the lines and
joints of the masonry being distinctly visible;
and another to the east, on which has been
conferred the name of the Boar’s Head, is
curiously like the head of an heraldic dragon,
with pointed ears and open jaws. When
flushed with the morning or evening glow,
this mighty natural rampart is a sight worth
going far to see.
Proceeding onwards, a mile or so of rough
ground is passed over, a slope strewn with
angular rocks of different shapes and sizes,
the accumulated wreck of ages from the cliff
above, and covered with rather thick bush
and scrub. After this the track passes
through capital walking country, with sandy
or gravelly soil, open bush, and no scrub.
It is almost level for the next 3 or 4
miles to Megalong Station, where some
huts are seen on the right. After striking
the S.E. corner of the paddock fence the
track runs alongside the fence for about
a mile, and at the S.W. corner (6f miles
from Katoomba, and 1,870 ft. above the
sea) leaves the course of Megalong Creek,
which we have followed from the cleft thus
far, and, bearing to the left, sidles the
sloping ground on the left bank of the
Cox, which foams along its rocky bed far
below. An easy gradual descent for Si-
miles takes us to the crossing, passing on
the way, between marks 47 and 48, some
picturesque granite rocks, which have in
past ages come tumbling down from the hill
above (called the Pinnacle) like colossal
nine-pins; one group, to which, from its
shape, the name of the Toad has been given,
being curiously perched one upon another,
whilst across the river a ridge, with three
prominent knobby peaks, attracts attention
on the right. At 101 miles we arrive at
the crossing of the Cox, at its confluence
with the Gibraltar Creek, the level of which
is only 940 ft. above the sea, so that we
have descended no less than 2,500 ft. since
we left the Western Eoad. The river bed is
D
well worth noticing: it is composed almost
entirely of grey granite, mostly solid, but
with loose rocks and boulders strewn about,
some of them of huge dimensions, whilst the
clear green water forms deep mirror-like
pools among them, or tumbles over in
brawling cascades. A mile or so further up
the stream the valley is crossed by a dyke of
red granite, of a lovely rose colour, well
worth turning aside to see, if time allows,
or it could be taken on the return journey,
and a cut across made afterwards to rejoin
the track above. In its ordinary state the
river can be crossed dryshod, and if the
water should be unusually high a log which
spans the stream a few chains below is
available, but in the case of a flood it would
not be wise for an inexperienced person to
attempt the passage, whilst it is needless to
say that during a high flood nothing can
cross without swimming. Half a mile below
the crossing is the comfortable hut of Peter
Reilly, a free selector, who acts as stock-
rider on the adjacent hills, which are well
grassed. He and his wife are the only resi-
dents on the route, for Megalong Station is
only occasionally inhabited. Any traveller
who spends an evening with Peter will bo
entertained with a number of racy anecdotes
concerning the wild bush life w r hich he and
so many others have led in the days gone by.
The track follows up the Gibraltar Creek,
and after crossing it three times, sidles up
the steep slopes of its right bank. It is easy
going, with the exception of two sharp
pinches, which can be avoided by side cutting
when the track is made, and brings us at 121
miles to a low saddle (2,310 ft.) across the
Mini Mini Range, an off-shoot of the Main
Divide, forming the northern boundary of
the Little River Valley, into which we
descend by an easy spur, and at 131 miles
we reach the bank of the river, 1,830 ft.
above the sea. Here, bordered by low hills,
is a small flat, which will be a capital position
for a half-way house hereafter. Following
the left bank of the clear, pebbly, musical
stream for half a mile, we cross it and com-
mence the ascent of the Black Range, another
off-shoot of the Main Divide,running easterly
from it, and separating the waters of the
Little and Jenolan Rivers. By a long easy
spur we rise 1,400 ft. in the next mile and a


half, this gives an average grade of 1 in G,
so that it is a task o£ no difficulty, except
for one stiff pull, where the grade of the
natural surface is about 1 in I for 60 chains,
and where the going condition of the traveller
is put to the proof. On reaching the top
(15f miles, height 3,200 ft.) the broad and
apparently flat range extends westward for
4 miles, then turns north for a mile so as to
head a gully of great depth, in which rises
one of the heads of the Jenolan River; and,
bending to the west again for half a mile,
joins the Main Dividing Range of the Colony
at 20f miles, and at a height of 8,980 ft,
above the sea. All along the Black Range
an old cart track is followed, used in former
years for the transport of hark to Bindo and
Hartley. Although, as might he expected,
pursuing a very serpentine course, it makes
a capital walking track, quite equal if not
superior to the average Sydney foot pave-
ment, and much better than the Sydney
macadam. Here and there, where the track
approaches the edge of the ridge, extensive
views are obtained to the north, north-east,
and south —deep gullies plunging steeply
down into the great valleys, seas of dull
green foliage out of which rise the blue-
green hills, with light yellow scars on their
distant flanks, plainly denoting the sandstone
formation. About a mile further, at a point
4,040 ft. high, the Main Range, which in this
part of its course forms a remarkable (\)
curve, turns to west and north-west, and our
track leaves it and follows a spur trending
almost due south right away to the caves.
Along this spur runs the buggy track from
Mount Victoria before alluded to, which,
being cleared 10 or 12 ft. wide, and the ridge
being nowhere steep, affords another 3-g- miles
of excellent walking. Some extensive views
to the eastward are to be had from several
points on this part of the route, embracing
to the left Katoomba, with the “ Great
"Western Hotel” standing out against the
sky; to the front the Cox Range, Medlow
Gap, and the striking two-peaked hill of the
Brothers visible through it, reminding the
travelled Australian of the My then on Lake
Luzern; and to the right the profound re-
cesses of the great Jenolan Gorge, termi-
nating in the mount of that ilk, one of the
hills which has the honor of being named
on Sir Thomas Mitchell’s excellent feature
map, still by far the best in existence of
the mountain district within 100 miles of
Sydney. On the west is the deep gorge of
the Jenolan Creek, clothed in luxuriant
timber, and on its further side the long wall
of the Main Range stands up high against
the sky. The descent of the spur we are
on is so easy that at 25 miles we are still
3,770 ft. above the sea; and then commences
the descent to the caves, which are 1,200 ft.
below. The spur plunges irregularly down
to its termination at the caves, so that it is
inexpedient to follow its ridge, and hence a
narrow track has been trenched in its side,
up or down which it is easy for man or horse
to walk except after dark. This brings us
to the Easter Arch of the caves —a natural
bridge of limestone striding over the Jenolan
(M‘Keown’s, or M'Ewan’s) Creek, from the
spur we have come down, to another which is
followed by the road from Oberon, The
top of this archway is strewn with slippery
limestone rocks, and sundry holes descend
to the regions below, so that wary walking is
necessary in this neighbourhood. A track
is, however, marked out which there is no
difficulty in finding by daylight; and follow-
ing this down we come at last, after a journey
of 261 miles, to onr destination. In harmony
with the philosophy of the American, who
said that there was no prospect, however fine,
which was not improved with a good hotel in
the foreground, the traveller who has come
thus far will probably deem the sight of the
accommodation house stretching across the
narrow valley in front of him one of the
pleasantest on the journey, the more so as
for the last 13 miles since leaving Little
River there is only one place where, excepting
just after rain, water is conveniently to be
had. He will be sure to receive every com-
fort and attention from Mr. and Mrs. Wilson,
and under the experienced guidance of the
former or his brother can proceed next
morning to explore the caves, which may
be aptly termed the Australian fairy land,
and to the examination of whose charms
several days should be devoted. For extent,
variety, and wonderful beauty combined, this
series of caves has few equals in the world.
The present writer is aware of only one, the
grotto of Adelsberg, in Carniola, 12 miles

S.E. of Trieste, where the features are very
similar, and command the unbounded ad-
miration of travellers from every part of
Europe. Considering their attractions, it
seems surprising that our caves have not
been visited by every intelligent person in
the colony who possesses the time and means
necessary to enable him to make the expedi-
tion. No doubt a large number have been
deterred by the tedious and roundabout route
at present employed, and the limited number
which the house at the caves has hitherto been
able to accommodate. Both these difficulties
are in course of being remedied to some extent:
the one by the horse track which is in course of
construction along the line marked out by Mr.
Cooper, and th e other by an enlargement of Mr.
Wilson’s house, which has been recently com-
pleted, thoughit appears to be still inadequate
to public requirements on special occasions.
It is understood that arrangements are in
contemplation to exhibit their marvellous
beauties in the only way by which anything
like justice can be done to them, —by lighting
up the caves by electricity. This, if carried
out, will add tenfold to their charms, and
cannot fail to induce a much larger number
of persons to visit what will then certainly
be one of the sights of the world.
In conclusion, we can confidently recom-
mend any one of good health and vigorous
constitution, who has an eye for natural
beauty, and a love of fresh air and exercise,
to take this trip. By starting early, say 6
o’clock in the morning, it can be comfortably
made in the day on foot, and it will probably
be of assistance to him and give an additional
interest to his journey if he will carry with
him these notes and the accompanying map,
showing tbe natural features of the country
traversed by the track. It will be observed
that it is intersected from north to south
and south-east by the great depression of
the Cox Yalley, from 2,000 to 3,000 feet
deep, bounded on the east by the long wall
of sandstone cliffs which is so well known
to tourists in the district. The remarkable
shape assumed by the island-like hills here-
abouts cannot fail to strike the observer —
islands and promontories they once were,
no doubt ; they once bathed their feet in
the surge of the Pacific, and the oceans of
ancient days hollowed out their cavernous
sides, at the time when the coral insects
were slowly building up the limestone ridge
which now contains the wonderful series of
caves that are the object of the journey.
On the west of the valley, and at an average
distance of about 8 miles, it is bounded by
the line of the Main Dividing Eange, about
4,000 feet in height; numerous lateral spurs
rising from it divide the intervening space
into tributary valleys, and along one of
these spurs, called the Black Eange (from a
dark-coloured stone found upon it), the
track is taken to its junction with the Main
Eange. As the range at this point bends
almost back again on itself in a curious (X)
curve, the track leaves it and takes advan-
tage of a spur running southwards right to
the caves themselves.
A sum of £2,500 has been voted by Parlia-
ment for the construction of a horse track
by this route, and the work has been com-
menced at the Megalong Cleft, where a zig-zag
is being cut, partly in solid rock, which when
completed will be usable by horses without
difficulty, the steepest gradient being 1 in SJ.


When you leave Katoomba there are peeps
to the left as you proceed for about 2 miles
further to the westward. Mountains then
become visible to the right, and distant
views are to be seen to the left, with lofty red
cliffs and dark blue and grey ranges. Then
the road—at Pulpit Hill—takes a sharp turn
to the northward, and runs through many
deep cuttings on this prolongation of the
table-land still lying between the two great
watersheds; winding a good deal, and show-
ing many glimpses of blue mountains and
magnificent cliffs of red and grey sandstone.
To the left, over the Cunimbla Yalley, views
are occasionally to be seen of wondrous
beauty, and strangely diversified with rich
varieties of colour and atmospheric effects.
The line passes a pretty Gothic gatehouse
(for the benefit of those drovers who may
still have occasion to use the Old Road) and
soon after you catch sight of the far off
ranges of mountains, which lie in the direc-
tion of Windsor and Richmond, and even of
Brisbane Water—the “ Gap” beyond Coo-
ranbong, in the Broken Back or Sugar-loaf
Range, being readily distinguishable on a
clear day by those who know where to look
for it. Then there are several hastily dis-
played and as rapidly withdrawn views of
the Cunimbla Yalley away to the south-
westward ; and so, after a very pleasant
trajet of 7 miles, the traveller finds himself
arrived at Blackheath, in the immediate
vicinity of Govett’s Leap and Gorge, over-
looking to the north and north-eastward the
Great Yalley of the Grose.
A visit to Katoomba, Blackheath, &c., has
been pleasantly described by Locksley in the
Melbourne “ Argus.” He says :
“ You take the train at Redfern at 9 o’clock
in the morning, and soon leave the city and
its straggling suburbs behind. The day was
bright and sunny when we began our trip,
and the country was fresh and green from the
recent rains. We pass groves of oranges,
where the winter crop of the golden fruit
shines out brightly from the rich green foliage.
The considerable town of Parramatta is
passed, and further on that of Penrith, on
the banks of the fine Nepean River, which
flows just at the foot of the Blue Mountains
which here rise steep and high, a colossal
barrier, right athwart our course. The line
runs straight for them, and soon you feel by
the heavy beats of the engine that you are
labouring up a very stiff ascent. Some
distance further on you come to the first
Zigzag in ascending which you obtain in
various aspects some very charming views of
the plains you have quitted, with the gleam-
ing river winding through them. As you
advance you steadily rise, and climb up to
the higher part of the great mountain mass.
The road presents constant changes to the
eye; now you are looking over miles of blue
hills and bluer valleys, now passing some
wild fantastic glen, now looking onward to a
strange notch in the ridge of a distant hill
through which it seems the line has to pass,
and then suddenly all outlook is cut off, and
the train is clanging along between echoing
walls of sandstone rock rising perpendicular, or
nearly so, to a height of 30ft. or 40ft, These
high sandstone walls between which we so
frequently pass derive from some source
sufficient moisture to nourish green-fronded
ferns or pretty flowering heaths which are
rooted in their crevices.
“By the time we are nearly 3,000 ft. high we
get on our left occasional glimpses of long
lines of red cliffs, and judge that we are near-
ing the place we came to see. But we still
went on till we came to Katoomba, where
there is a large hotel, the “Great Western,”
standing on a hill close to the station and
about 3,400 ft. above sea level. To this
height the railway has brought ns—higher
than the top of Mount Macedon, almost as
high as that of Mount Juliet. Our first
pilgrimage is to the look-out on the roof of
the hotel, whence we can see over a large
extent of the awful gorge of the Kunimbla
and Jamison Valley, outlined by its long lines
of cliffs.
“We soon set off to the edge of the great
valley, and speedily had it outspread beneath
our gaze. It stretched away for miles, flanked
on all sides by these enormous cliffs of ruddy
sandstone descending in perpendicular, and
in some places overhanging, precipices for
hundreds of feet. From the foot of the cliffs,
sloped away for hundreds of feet further, a
huge talus—for one must use the geological
term as no other is available —all ovei’grown
with forest, and this ran down into the depths
of the valley, the broad floor of which was


all covered with small ranges of hills like the
blue, storm-tossed billows of a mighty sea.
But in the midst of the valley right before
us rises a massive hill, level with the ground
we stand on, and showing on its red-tinted
cliffs lines of stratification exactly correspond-
ing to those visible in the bounding-walls of
the valley. This is the Solitary, but its
savagely isolated, inaccessible look, and its
general conformation, first a huge talus, then
a wall of perpendicular cliff, and on the top
a forest-covered table land, reminded us of
views we had seen of the great unscaleable
mountain of Roraima, on the borders of
British Guiana, Below where we stood on a
jutting point of cliff, a huge rock, fantastically
shaped like a colossal natural cathedral, stood
in the valley below. A walk of a mile or
two took us to another point of view, just
over the Katoomba Falls, where a slender
stream leaps as though with fear and reluct-
ance over the lip-edge of a great precipice,
and descends in finely divided, wavering,
lace-like tracery to the depths of the valley
below, where it is lost among the trees of
which we just discern the tops. On the
other side of us rises from the profound gulf
a tall, rudely pinnacle-shaped rock, all
shaggy with trees which found root-hold in
its rugged joints and recesses. But the sight
of all was the long lines of battlemented
cliffs, now redder than ever in the light of
the afternoon sun, while the depth of the
valley was growing bluer, as though by
reflection from the sky above. They seemed
like mighty fortifications remaining from a
time when giants warred with gods, with
their curtains and ravelins, scarp and glacis,
and jutting bastions, the dimensions of which
were not in yards but in furlongs. And so
these enormous ramparts stretched away for
miles down the valley, where, at its lower
end, the strange formation breaks up into
formless disorder, and confused masses of blue
hills bound the prospect.
“ The afternoon air at the altitude of this
magnificent sanitarium for the people of
Sydney is warm and genial, but as the sun
approaches the horizon and the shadow's
grow long the temperature rapidly falls, and
you are glad to get inside the house. But the
air is always light, and fresh, and free, and
as stimulating as champagne. From the
verandah of the hotel the great electric light
in the lighthouse at South Head, which
illumines the whole harbour with its revolving
blaze, can be seen scintillating and flashing,
like a more brilliant Venus, on the horizon.
“ When we rise in the morning the easterly
plains are covered in patches with a low mist,
and seem as though covered with the sea.
From the great valley close at hand rise the
ragged edges of enormous boiling mists, which
dissipate as soon as they ascend above the
sides of the mighty cauldron. We take a
walk of about a mile to the historic tree
where the three gallant explorers, Wentworth,
Blaxland, and Lawson, in their first attempt
to penetrate the huge barrier of the Blue
Mountains in 1813, carved their names before
turning back, as they were forced to do, for
fresh supplies. The tree is now protected by
a wall, built by the Government, containing
a large inscribed stone to commemorate the
circumstance. It then became a question
what was to be the programme for the day.
We could not, indeed, reach the Lithgow
Valley, or even the Second (which is the
greater) Zigzag, and get back to Sydney, as
we wished to do, that night. But we could
go on as far as Govett’s Leap and see the
similar, and it is said even more awful, Valley
of the Grose; or we could go down to the
next station and see the Wentworth Falls,
at the famous Weatherboard. We were
persuaded to choose the latter, in which
I think we made a mistake, inasmuch as
we thereby only saw one of the great
gorges instead of the two. Not that the falls
themselves were anything less than wonderful.
Their depth must be enormous, including the
space where the little stream rushes down for
perhaps one or two hundred feet in white,
foaming, plashing, rapids between the rocks,
then falls for hundreds of feet through the
air in slender threads, projected on the black
background of the overhanging cliff, swaying
in the breeze, and at times caught by the
gusts and whirled wildly about ‘ like a mad
witch’s hair/ and carried right back again to
the top of the fall, but all ultimately descend-
ing in spray and rain among the rich vegeta-
tion at the foot, where it collects again into
a stream before taking its final plunge over
another vast cyclopean wall into the valley
beneath. From this point you undoubtedly see


the valley in its most impressive aspect. The
precipices here are more imposing, the effect of
the mighty containing walls of the gorge
is grander, and the great Solitary looks more
like Rox-aima than ever. When you try to
analyse the impression these sights stamp on
the mind you find a difficulty in resolving it
into its elements. It is too strange for sub-
limity, too overpowering for beauty, too stern
for the fantastic, too severely wild for the
grotesque. The impression, like the scene, is
unique, and will not come in place under any
of the familiar terms of description. The
feeling which rises in the mind as you look
at the scene and give yourself up fully to the
sentiments awakened by the view of these
awful precipices, these vast distances, these
strangely contrasted colourings of bright red
cliff and intensely blue valley, these enormous
depths, that wildly confused floor covered
with hills and forests many hundreds of feet
below, is that you have been brought nearer
than you ever stood before to the workings
of some strange and mighty and unsuspected
forces in the great arsenal of nature.
“ And with this our views of the Blue
Mountains had for the time to end. They
are well and happily named. All of our Aus-
tralian mountains are blue in the distance,
but none I think so blue as these. Their
blueness, or ‘ blueth,’ as some of our old
writers used to write the word, seems a
positive colouring and not a mere effect of
distance. It begins so very close to you, and
deepens into such deep ultramarine farther
away.
One more word about the Blue Mountains.
These are capable of being regarded in many
different aspects. For a long time they were
looked upon as an enormous tract of waste
and useless land, lying like an enormous
obstruction in the middle of the Colony. It
is impossible to regard them in this way now.
They have been proved to be amazingly
rich in mineral treasures of the most varied
characters. Few places rival the famous
Lithgow Yalley in the abundance and variety
of their mineral wealth. And even here,
in these nearer parts we have visited, the
same character of mineral richness holds
good. Just within sight of the picturesque
Katoomba Falls the upper works of a
coal-mine are perched on the very edge of
the vast precipice, and the coal is hauled
from the pit by a wire rope right to the side
of the railway.”
Mount King George, Mount Hay,
Mount Toomah, and Mount Wilson.—
Lying north-eastward and north of the line,
between Katoomba and Blackheath—from 6
to 13 miles away, and in the almost inacces-
sible country which constitutes the water-
sheds of the Grose and the Colo Rivers—are
the four lofty mountains of King George,
Hay, Toomah, and Wilson. Mount King
George, on the north-west side of the Grose
—the Saddle-backed Hill, visible from
Sydney—is 3,620 feet high ; Mount Hay,
on the south-east side of the same river,
2,400 feet; and (more northerly between the
Colo River and the Wollangambe Creek)
Mount Wilson, 3,580 feet. Eastward of all
these stands Mount Toomah, 3,240 feet high.
These mountains, the most conspicuous points
in the whole range, can be seen from Sydney,
and are sometimes spoken of collectively, as
“ The Dromedary.” Some of them can first
be seen from the verandah of the “ Old Blue
Mountain Inn,” at the Lawson Station; but
as the traveller proceeds to the- westward,
they become gradually more and more deve-
loped. “ Mr. Charles Moore, of the Sydney
Botanic Gardens,” says Burton’s Guide (page
121), “has drawn attention to the fact that
on these four hills the soil is of the richest
kind, composed principally of disintegrated
trap, and clad with noble timber trees of a
brush character, the undergrowth being
chiefly tree and other ferns. This is the
more extraordinary from the fact that they
are surrounded in all directions by others of
a sandstone formation, covered by a wretched
and sterile scrub, and some eucalypti of
miserable growth.” Eor long after the open-
ing of the Main Western Road, Mount Hay
was supposed to be inaccessible, until that
indefatigable explorer, Count Strzelecki, suc-
cessfully crossed the ravines and ascended
the summit. “ Some idea,” says Sir Thomas
Mitchell, in his work on Australia, “ may be
formed of the intricate character of the moun-
tain ravines in the neighbourhood, from the
difficulties experienced by the surveyors in
endeavouring to obtain access to Mount Hay.
Mr. Dixon, in an unsuccessful attempt, pene


trated to the Valley of the Grose, until then
unvisited by man, and when he at length
emerged from the ravines in which he had
been bewildered four days, he thanked God
(to use his own words, in an official letter)
that he had found his way out of them.'’
Even Count Strzelecki tells us, that in the
course of his researches he was engulphed in
the endless labyrinth of the almost subter-
raneous gullies of Mount Hay, and was
unable to extricate himself and his men until
after days of incessant fatigue, danger, and
starvation. “ But,” he adds, “ the ascent of
Mount Hay, when these difficulties are once
surmounted, repays richly the exertions and
fatigues which it entails. From its basaltic
top the distant views to the south and
west are somewhat intercepted by King’s
Table-land and other mountains somewhat
higher than Mount Hay; but to the east,
the sea-coast, bordering the interesting basin
through which flows the rivers Nepean and
Hawkesbury, the vicinity of Parramatta
Elver, together with Sydney and Botany
Bay, are distinctly visible. To the north also
the prospect is extensive. In the intervening
space may be noticed the vast gorge at the
head of the Grose River. In a westerly direc-
tion, in the valley, lie the towns of Hartley
and Bowenfels, with Mount Lambie in the
background.” Mount King George, Mount
Hay, and Mount Toomah, form conspicuous
objects in the grand view from the edge of
the gorge near Blackheath, which generally
goes by the odd but well-known name of
“ Govett’s Leap.”
Blackheath Platform, 73 miles; 3,494
feet above sea-level. —The visitor may
either leave the train here, where he will find
good accommodation, or journey onto Mount
Victoria, from which place Blackheath may
be readily visited either on foot or on horse-
back, there being a good road near the line
all the way, a distance of about 4 miles.
On the eastern side of the hotel standing near
the station a road branches off to the north-
eastward, and leads the tourist, after a walk
or ride of 2 miles, to the edge of the gorge.
Mount King George is found rising to the left
of the traveller when he reaches this inter-
esting spot, and Mount Hay appears in front
of him, at the distance of rather more than 5
miles, “as the crow flies.” Between the hut
and Mount Hay there is a general and almost
continuous descent to the extreme depth of
1,850 feet, the vast densely wooded basin
beneath converging towards the gorge of the
Grose, presenting a coup d’oeil which can never
be forgotten. On the right of the ruined
hut, at the distance of about half a mile, is
the “Govett’s Leap,” or Falls, an unbroken
descent of about 500 feet. Far below, in the
valley, is “The Trinity Cascade,” and to the
westward (nearly on a line with Govett’s
Leap) is another waterfall, not so easy to see,
known as “ The Left-hand Fall,” for want
of some more fitting designation. There is
also yet another cascade formed by one of the
minor tributaries of the Grose, away to the
eastward, at the distance of 2 or 3 miles
from the hut. Another track—ending on the
west side of the accommodation house—leads
to “ Perry’s Look-down ” into the Grose
Yalley, near Hat Hill—some miles further to
the north of Govett’s Leap. From “Perry’s
Look-down” the track is continued past
“ Docker’s Ladder,” down to a place called
“ The Gap,” and so on to “ Junction Camp,”
in “the Gorge of the Grose,” properly so
called, 2,150 feet below the Blackheath
platform; but no ordinary visitor should
on any account attempt to visit these last-
named spots without a thoroughly competent
guide.
Govett’s Leap : Waterfalls and Gorge.
—From a bold and rugged mass of rock in a
bay or bend at the southern extremity of
the valley or chasm, and near the ruined
hut at the end of the road, the visitor may
perhaps obtain the best general view of this
wondrous spot. To the right, at the distance
of about half a mile, the Govett’s Leap , or
Fall, pours itself, headlong, over a perpen-
dicular wall of dark tinted rock, 520 feet in
sheer descent, on to a mass of black fragments
of stone which has in the course of ages
accumulated at the base of the cataract.
This descending mass of water—white and
misty as the driven snow—sways, as the
wind blows, to and fro, like the veil of a
bride; the vast height of the waterfall, the
strong contrast of colour, and the undulating
motion so produced, imparting a very singular
and most charming effect. When the sun


attains to a certain altitude, a rainbow plays
for hours around the cloudy folds of this
Fairy Veil. From the neighbourhood of the
hut the other cascades are not visible ; but on
turning a few yards to the westward the deep
whisper of the Left-hand Fall may be dis-
tinctly heard. The whole of this rock-en-
closed valley before the spectator is for the
most part hemmed in with titanic walls of red
and grey rocks from 400 to 800 feet in height,
and from the irregularly defined base of these
outermost and uppermost walls of the valley
there is everywhere a steep rocky incline, or
talus, covered with thick woods down to the
lowest depths, 1,200 feet below the level of
the rock on which the traveller stands. Here
and there in this broad and verdant expanse
of tree-tops, rising and falling according to
the varied surface, may be seen a few grey
patches of half denuded rock ; but for the
most part all these lowest slopes (on either
side of the devious but invisible central
stream) are densely shaded with primeval
forest trees, the tops of which, from the alti-
tude occupied by the spectator, appear
strangely soft and dim in their outlines.
Beyond the “ Leap” —apparently a Cumbrian
provincialism for waterfall, named after W.
R. Govett, a Government surveyor, who first
explored these parts—and round the first
point to the eastward, there is another deep
“ bay” of precipitous rock; and from the
furthest limit of this bay there is a winding
channel leading down to the centre of the
whole tableau. From the easternmost end of
the Govett’s Leap Gorge the rocky walls trend
north-westerly, until, ending sharply as before,
the semicircular barren top of Mount Hay
becomes visible, with long lines of blue hills
in the extreme distance. The Govett’s Leap
Gorge is shut in on the western side of its
northern limit by a boldly projecting termi-
nation of cliff and talus ; and thence inside of
that outer boundary a grand sweep of rocks,
mountains, and declivitous slopes comes back
to the left of the spectator. To the west of
the hut, as you go towards the Left-hand
Falls, there is a most extraordinary echo, by
which short sentences are distinctly repeated
nearly half a minute after they have been
uttered. In the slopes many hundred feet
below, in the vicinity of the Left-hand Fall,
there are large and lovely groves of tree fern
and such like products, the rocks behind
them being beautifully decked with trailing
creepers and arborescent plants. Mount
King George (here assuming the outline of a
couchant lion) overlooks the western side of
the Govett’s Leap chasm—a southern offshoot
of the Yalley of the Grose, the course of
which, by the way, is here from north-west
to south-east. The glorious character of the
entire scene, in all its vastness and sublimity
—cliff, mountain, forest, and shadowy distant
hills—impresses the beholder with admiration
and with awe, the never ceasing sigh of un-
seen and remote waters naturally conducing
greatly to the general effect.
Another description of Govett’s Leap.
—The following description of the Govett’s
Leap Gorge and Falls is from the accomplished
pen of Mr. E. DuFaur, F.R.G.S. : “ Leaving
the Blackheath Platform (73 miles from
Sydney) the tourist follows a road trending
east-north-east, through an uninteresting
scrubby forest, for about 2 miles (having
gradually descended about 320 feet), when
he arrives at the edge of a gorge hemmed in
by perpendicular cliffs of sandstone, lying in
horizontal strata, and varying generally from
400 to 800 feet in depth. From the foot of
these cliffs a steep talus descends to the
centre of the gorge, at a depth of 1,850 feet
from the edge of the precipice. The width
of the gorge varies from three-quarters of a
mile to a mile and a-half, and its length, in a
straight line, to its confluence with that of
the Grose River, is 3| miles. At a distance
of 520 yards from the end of the road a small
watercourse abruptly terminates in the Falls
known as Govett’s Leap, the perpendicular
depth of which has been determined at 520
feet to where the water first touches the
rocks below, while the actual foot of the
Falls, at the basin, immediately below those
rocks, may be considered as 600 feet. From
the head of the Falls, to which an easy track
has been cleared, another similar waterfall is
visible, bearing about north by west, and
distant 920 yards from Govett’s Leap, and
equally accessible from the road; and another
of at least equal depth exists about 1| mile
to the south-east, but is more difficult of
access. The gathering ground of the water-
courses which terminate in these Falls is very


GOBETT’S LEAP, BLUE MOUNTAINS.


limited, being confined to the northern slopes
of the main ridges along which the Railway
passes; but being fed from swamps or
‘ sponges,’ they are perennial, and show little
variation in the quantity of water passing
down them in winter or summer, except im-
mediately after heavy rains. The descent to
the foot of the Falls is at present impracticable
from their immediate neighbourhood. It was
reached for the first time—at least for many
y earg —in the month of October, 1875, from
a sketching camp formed by the writer, at
the junction of Govett’s Leap Gorge with the
Valley of the Grose, to be hereafter described.
That junction is situated about 12 miles
down the Grose Yalley from the Hartley
Yale Siding (80 miles from Sydney), and
2,270 feet below the Railway ; thence, owing
to the roughness of the upper part of
Govett’s Creek bed and the denseness of the
scrub, fully three and a half hours are
required to reach the foot of the Falls,
although the distance, as above stated, is only
about miles in a straight line. As
described by its visitors on that occasion, the
scene at the bottom of the Falls is, if possible,
grander than that from above. From the
top you can see nothing distinctly, only an
awful gulf, with a confused mass of foliage
far below ; but from below it appears a large
amphitheatre, filled with trees of luxuriant
growth, and ferns and mosses. The water
coming down sometimes like falling rockets,
sometimes dissipated by the wind into clouds
of spray before it has half completed its
downward course, is wafted over a large area,
and insures the conditions of perennial
moisture so plainly evidenced by the luxuri-
ance of the surrounding vegetation. Then
again, from below you have a sky-line broken
into many fantastic shapes, and lighted up in
parts with delicate bright hues, while others
are in deep shade, in lieu of the almost
uniformly level horizon seen from above.
Standing at the basin at the foot of Govett’s
Leap, which is only about 25 yards from the
perpendicular wall of rock, it is almost im-
possible to look up at the Falls. The better
plan is to lie on one’s back, and look upwards
to the zenith, when the 700 feet cliffs forming
the ends of the horse-shoe bend in which the
Falls are situated tower above you on either
side, while the waterfall appears to be coming
down from a depression in their centre almost
on to your face. Few persons perhaps could
lie in that position for more than a minute
or two at a time without feeling giddy, the
sight is so grand. Besides the three principal
falls above referred to, there are many others
in this valley and in that of the Grose of
almost equal depth, which have not yet been
closely approached; while some of the minor
cascades—notably the ‘ Trinity Falls’—are
of excessive beauty. Before leaving the
subject it may be as well to record the origin
of the name of ‘ Govett’s Leap.’ Mr. W. R.
Govett was a Government surveyor who, in
the year 1832, under instructions from Sir
Thomas (then Major) Mitcell, the Surveyor-
General, ‘to survey the features of the county
of Cook,’ is supposed to have first discovered
the Falls. He made some unsuccessful
attempts to descend into the gorge ; but his
plans of the contour of the ranges and gorges,
as partly traversed and otherwise sketched in
from above, and which illustrate an area of
some 650 square miles, are proved to be
remarkably accurate, when the early date and
limited means at his disposal, in country
of so remarkably difficult a character, and
entirely uninhabited, are considered.”
Another description of Govett’s Leap.
—Mr. Edwin Barton’s description of Govett’s
Leap and its vicinity will also be read with
interest. That indefatigable litterateur says :
“ One of the greatest natural wonders of the
world is Govett’s Leap, 6 miles from Mount
Victoria Station. The goods train, which
leaves soon after 10 o’clock every morning,
will drop the excursionist at Blackheath
Platform, and a walk of a mile and a half
through some pretty scenery will bring him
to the Gap itself. There was once a stockade
here, and the ruins of the officers’ quarters
may still be seen lying on the* ground, whilst
on the opposite side of the station is an old
graveyard. The track leading to the ‘Leap,’
which is wide enough for buggies, is entered
amidst some tea-tree scrub a hundred yards
or so to the left of the Main Western Road,
and not far from the hotel. Once on the
track the visitor has nothing to do but to
follow it up until he reaches the tremendous
rent or depression in the earth, which is said
to be the deepest chasm with perpendicular


cliffs in the known world. It is almost sur-
rounded with these cliffs, which are believed
to be nowhere less than 3,000 feet above the
level of the sea. The full sublimity and
majestic grandeur of the scene is not realised
at a first glance. After contemplating it for
a time the mind becomes filled with awe and
wonder as it vainly strives to comprehend
“ The vast immeasurable abyss
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild.”
The trees in the valley below, although one
or two hundred feet high, or perhaps more,
are undistinguishable in their individuality.
Standing on the abrupt precipitous wall, one
cannot help feeling a strong desire to reach
the depths of the gorge. But the closer one
seeks for a spot at which a descent can be
made, the more certain does it appear that
such an object is unattainable. It is re-
corded that Sir Thomas Mitchell (formerly
Surveyor-General for the Colony) endeavoured,
first by walking and then by crawling between
the great fragments of sandstone, to ascend
the Gorge through which the river Grose
joins the Nepean, but in vain. Near to the
shed which was erected by the Government
on the occasion of Prince Alfred’s visit, and
which overlooks the ravine, a track may be
noticed winding down 200 or 300 feet, to
where a rock juts out, and on which those
who are fearless enough may recline, and
endeavour, if they can, to form some concep-
tion of this wonderful place. The scenery is
full of grandeur, and to add to its beauty
there are two streams, which are precipitated
into the mighty chasm, and although meeting
with no impediment but the atmosphere in
their descent, they ai’e dissipated into mist
long before their waters can reach the bot-
tom ; and often when the wind is favourable
the spray is wafted upwards and along for a
considerable distance. To a few members of
the New SoutluWales Academy of Art is the
honor due of having explored the valleys which
lead up to this tremendous gorge. For some
days this gallant band made their home in the
ravines, and succeeded in ascertaining the
heights of the hills, and taking a number of
excellent photographs of the scenery.”
The Mermaid’s Glen. —The visitor to
Blackheath should not omit to pay a visit to
a pretty dell known as the Mermaid’s Glen.
To reach it you leave Blackheath platform,
and after following the Railway line in the
direction of Sydney for about half a mile the
word “Cave” will be found written on the
Railway fence (southern boundary), a little
distance beyond the furthest distance signal
from the station. From the fence a well-
defined track leads into the valley. At the
bottom of the glen the track passes between
two rocks into a lovely natural basin, dense
with ferns, into which a streamlet falls.
Leaving this and passing to the right a larger
stream is found running through the valley;
the stream is hidden in many parts by masses
of ferns and shrubs; in places forest trees,
their trunks covered with moss of years’
growth, have fallen across it; while the living
trees, with foliage beautifully green and dense,
throw a grateful shade over the whole glen.
Mount Victoria Station, 77 miles;
3,422 feet above sea-level. —4 miles north-
west from the Blackheath Platform is the
Station of Mount Victoria, not the less re-
markable for the centrality of its position
and for its bracing atmosphere than for the
grandeur of its scenery. Mount Victoria is
a place of some importance, being a very
favourite place of resold for tourists and in-
valids. Already it contains numerous villa
residences, a post office, a telegraph station,
two or three stores, and three excellent
hotels—the “Royal,” Perry’s “Imperial,”
and the “Manor House.” There is also
a Public School and an Anglican Church.
The “Imperial Hotel” is a large castellated
edifice, occupying a commanding situation
between the two other hotels. In the imme-
diate vicinity of Mount Victoria are many
localities of great beauty and peculiar interest
to the traveller. Amongst these are : Moupt
Piddington; the Fairy Dell; the Engineer’s
Cascade ; the Little Zigzag ; the Fairy Bower;
Cox’s Cave and Waterfall, below Mount
Piddington; and the Mount Victoria Pass.
There are few places throughout the whole
Blue Mountain Range where a more pleasant
variety can be found for the lovers of the
picturesque or more comfortable accommoda-
tion. It is usual for tourists to make Mount
Victoria their head-quarters, and thence to
make excursions in different directions—up


and down the line, away into Hartley Vale,
and into the great Cunimbla Valley and
elsewhere.
Mount Piddington. —A favourite much
frequented spot is Mount Piddington, to the
south of Mount Victoria, one of the highest
points in the vicinity, and about a mile from
the Station. Mount Piddington received
its name in commemoration of the enterprise
and public spirit of the Hon. W. R. Pid-
dington, who felled many trees on the summit,
formed the roads, and caused seats to be con-
structed by the Government for the con-
venience of pedestrians. The place is now
vested in the hands of three Trustees (Mr.
Cousins, Mr. Benson, and the Hon. Mr.
Piddington), who have done a great deal
towards making the many places of note easy
of access to the crowd of tourists who visit
here. On Mount Piddington a commodious
hut has been erected, from which the visitor,
protected from sun or rain, may see the glorious
view spread out before him. This grand
eminence, visible from the Railway on the
Sydney side, overlooks a portion of the Vale
of Hartley and the broad Cunimbla Valley,
amongst the undulating hills and forests of
which there are numerous homesteads. To
the south-east are the uplands of the country
near the town of Camden ; and to the north
may be seen the distant ranges which lie
away in the direction of Singleton, on the
Hunter. Much nearer, at the distance of
only a dozen miles or so, may be recognized
the four mountains of King George, Hay,
Wilson, and Toomah. The view from Mount
Piddington (everywhere traversed by admir-
able roads) is extremely fine in the early
morning, when the vailed depths of the whole
Valley of Cunimbla often lie whelmed in a
misty moving sea of blue (cobalt) tipped here
and there with the rosy (or golden) light of
the sun. Mr. E. Vickery’s country residence,
on some far-away hill in the great valley
below, is at all times a conspicuous and
interesting feature in the charming prospect
here unfolded to view. It is near Vickery’s
only 2 or 3 miles beyond it, that the Black-
heath Creek falls into the river Cox.
The Engineer’s Cascade. —The Engi-
neer’s Cascade is a fine waterfall a mile or so
at the back of Perry’s “ Family Hotel,” about
midway between Mount Piddington and the
Little Zigzag—a little to the left of the road
as you go down towards the Pass. Here,
as in many of the other dingles and glens,
wild flowers, mosses, and ferns abound. The
view from this spot to the south-westward is
very highly spoken of.
The Little Zigzag or Cunimbla Pass.—
Not far from the Old Main Road, and to the
rear of “Perry’s Hotel,” there is a bridle-track
laid out by the Roads Department, leading
from the mountain down the face of the
precipice into the Cunimbla Yalley. This is
generally known as the Little Zigzag or
Cunimbla Pass, and is well deserving of a
visit. This pass, formed with much skill on
a series of zigzags, is 46 chains in length.
There are sixteen of these traverses on the
side of the mountain, each averaging about
190 feet in length. The scenery from these
successive terraces (and especially from the
upper ones) is very grand. To the right is
Mount Victoria, with its connecting pass on
the Old Road, in full view, and there is
moreover an unbroken prospect stretching
over all the lower country. Half-way down
this road are some remarkable dssures in the
rocks, known as the Cunimbla Caves. These
extend into the mountain for some depth.
The Mount Victoria Pass. —The Mount
Victoria Pass—about 2 miles from the Mount
Victoria Station, on the Old Road to the
westward leading towards Hartley—was con-
structed many years ago by prison labour,
under the supervision of Sir Thomas Mifcchell.
In the old days, before the existence of
Railroads, it was regarded as a triumph of
engineering skill, and it is still well worth a
visit. After passing through a deep cutting
at this spot the visitor should turn off the
road for a few yards to the right, and he will
then have spread before him a magnificent
panorama of mountain, vale, and forest;
Little Hartley lying at his feet, Great Hartley
beyond, and Bowenfels in the distance. Here
Hartley Vale (containing the measured lands
of the New South Wales Shale and Oil Com-
pany, with Mount York and Mount Clarence
adjoining—in fact the whole upper basin of
the river Lett and other minor tributaries of


the Cox) lies away to the north and west of
this road and pass, hemmed in by the steep
mountain x’idges upon the east and north.
Mount York. —Another pleasant walk
from Mount Victoria may be found along the
ridge to Mount York, one of the most pro-
minent elevations on the western side of the
range. This mountain—which is named after
Her present Majesty’s uncle, the Duke of
York—terminates abruptly to the westward
(at about 6 miles from the Mount Victoria
Station) in precipices of over 750 feet in
height; its topmost point being 3,292 feet
above the level of the sea. On the one hand,
at the base of this mountain lies the Valley
of Clwydd*—extending 6 miles in a north-
westerly direction—and, on the other, the
yet longer and more beautiful Hartley
Valley. Across this last-named romantic
tract of country, in the direction of Bowen-
fels, may be seen the conical summit of
Mount Lambie ; to the left, Mount Tarana—-
at the foot of which the Railway passes;
and in the far distance (beyond the spur of
Tarana) one of the lofty peaks of the Canoblas,
near Orange, is on clear days distinguishable.
Mount Clarence—on the western declivity
of which is the Lithgow Valley—is directly
opposite to Mount York, in a north-westerly
direction. Passing along the Mount York
Road, and at about a mile or so from the
Mount Victoria hotels, the original road—by
means of steep traverses or zigzags—descended
into the adjacent valley, and traces of this pass
may, it is said, yet be discerned by following
along the declivity to the right. This was
the old track down into the Hartley Valley
before the Victoria Pass was designed and
constructed by Sir Thomas Mitchell. The
pass now referred to, being abrupt and
dangerous, has long since been abandoned.
Mount Piddington and the Caves.—
A visit should be paid to Mount Piddington
and the Caves and Waterfall below it. The
Trustees of the locality, the Hon. W. R.
* The Vale or Valley of Clwydd was so named by
Governor Macquarie in 1815, in consequence of the
strong resemblance it bore to a vale of that name in
North Wales ( Wells' Gazetteer.) Often, however,
the Vale of Clwydd (lying, as it does, to the left of
the line) appears to be confounded with the
Valleys of Cunimbla and of Hartlev.
Piddington, Messrs. Cousins and Benson,
have made the place easy of access, and
provided seats at intervals for rests; on the
summit of the Mount a commodious hut has
been erected, which affords shelter from the
sun or rain. Prom this hut a magnificent
view is obtained over the extent of the
Cunimbla Valley. Immediately below the
hut a finger-post is shown with the words
“ To the Falls,” and from this a road leads
down into the Cunimbla Valley. After
following the track for a little distance, a
charming recess—the Fairy Bower, which is
hidden in ferns—-is reached. The visitor may
here rest himself, seats being placed under
the shade of an overhanging rock, and no
matter how oppressive the day the place is
deliciously cool and fresh, the dripping of
water mingling with the soft sighing of the
breeze among the trees making a pleasant
music. Further down a waterfall is reached,
the water leaping from between two peculiarly
formed rocks into a basin, which almost
seems to have been chiselled out by the hand
of man. The fall, about 30 feet, is not
great, but the surroundings are very pretty,
and the whole makes an effective scene. A
little distance further down the visitor will
find a track branching to the right: This
leads to the cave, a ladder giving access to it.
The cave is not extensive, and is open to the
sun, the floor being covered with a luxuriant
growth of large ferns. Seated in the cave
the visitor commands an extensive view of
the valley below. Returning to the main
track, and passing still further down the
valley, the stream is bordered with a number
of tall fern trees, the place being known as
Fern Grove. If the visitor wishes to prolong
his walk, he will by keeping to the right
reach the foot of the Cunimbla Pass, and
can return by it to the hotel.
Mount Victoria, on account of its central
position, the salubrity of its climate, and the
excellent accommodation to be obtained here,
is a capital head-quarters for the tourist who
desires to see the mountains. In addition to
the many local places of interest, the Went-
worth Falls, Katoomba, and Blackheath, are
within easy distance on the one side, and on
the other there is Hartley Vale, Town and
Mine, the Great Zigzag, Mount Wilson,


and Lithgow. The principal hotel is the
“Imperial.” It is one of the largest out of
Sydney, contains seventy rooms, and has
accommodation for eighty people. Opposite
the hotel the proprietor has laid out a recrea-
tion ground for his patrons, tennis-court, &c.
Guides, horses and vehicles, are always to be
obtained, and excursions are now frequently
made from here to the Fish River Caves, the
distance being 31 miles. The oldest estab-
lished house, kept by Mrs. Perry, and the
“ Royal,” are also comfortable well-appointed
hotels, situated in close proximity to the
station. Visitors who desire more private
accommodation can secure it at Manor
House, a private hotel, well conducted and
favourably situated. In addition there are
several other private establishments, so that
a large number of visitors can be here accom-
modated.
Excursion from Mount Victoria to
the Weatherboard. —An artist, or any real
lover of the picturesque, may take a very
pleasant excursion from Mount Victoria to
the “ Weatherboard,” by starting early in
the morning, and walking all the way down
by the side of the Railway, a distance of 15
miles. Much lovely scenery may thus be
observed by a pedestrian tourist, which he
cannot otherwise see, either from the Hne
or the Old Road. At about a mile to the
eastward of Mount Victoria he will come,
always looking to the right, upon a bold
bluff in the foreground, fringed with woods
along its outline; sweeping round from the
Railway range to where it ends, in a cliff
with a well-wooded talus. Beyond this
stands disclosed an enchanting prospect of
the Great Cunimbla Valley to the south-
east—spread out before you as on a model
map. These distant reaches of country are
beautifully diversified in outline and colour,
and when seen early in the morning, or
(better still) in the evening, are full of great
effects of light and shade. Further on, at
the top of a deep perpendicular cutting—
near the staff of the telegraph line—there is
another grand view of the same valley, the
chrome-coloured cliffs in the foreground
lending to it a strange but striking attrac-
tion. Then the tourist has to scramble,
at some risk, past three precipitous cuttings,
and he will at length find himself rewarded
with the unexpected prospect of a curious
grey rock to the west of a great gap to the
southward—best seen from an old disused
road to the south of the line. Another
grand view is next disclosed further on to
the eastward, the Great Cunimbla Valley
appearing over the broken edge of a shelving
semicircular basin of rock, with sloping
woods, set off (laterally) by tall and brightly
tinted cliffs. The next change presents a
modification of the same kind of scene,
dotted everywhere with broken fragments of
isolated grey rock and rough pyramids of
stone; Mount Piddington reappearing in
the distance to the westward. This pretty
well occupies the first 4 miles of the trip;
but (near the Blackheath Platform) there
are still occasional peeps of the Great Valley
worth going many miles to see, and not
visible from the adjacent line. Passing
Blackheath and continuing along the line
towards Katoomba there will be found a
varied succession of views to the south and
south-east —at least six that are well
deserving of the artist’s pencil. Having
reached Katoomba —11 miles from Mount
Victoria—the tourist will find several grand
views of huge parti-coloured cliffs and
shadowy ranges—especially one which he
will open out soon after he has passed the
siding and telegraph station. Good accom-
modation can be had at Katoomba, and
after obtaining refreshment the visitor can
resume his walk to Wentworth Falls, distant
4 miles.
Hartley Vale Platform, 80 miles; 3,318
feet above sea-level. —After leaving the
Mount Victoria Station the Railway takes a
northerly and sometimes even a north-easterly
direction, along a narrow ridge, known as
the “ Darling Causeway,” and dividing the
watersheds. The waters fall into the Grose
to the eastward ; whilst, on the western side
of the ridge, the heads of the river Lett, and
other affluents of the Cox, although eastern
waters, commence their course by flowing to
the westward. As the traveller proceeds
towards Lithgow and Bathurst, he may first
observe a fine view to the left opening up a
deep well-wooded valley—that of Clwydd ;
whilst to the right (the eastward) Mount


King George, with its singularly stratified
cliffs, is seen in mid-distance. Next he
catches, on the same side, a passing glimpse
of a wild and stony country; and then—as
by a magic shift of the camera—a grand and
more distant view is seen of Mount King
George and Mount Hay. After that (still
to the eastwai’d) he has a brief out-look over
the upper portion of the gorge of the Grose,
stretching past the northerly mouth of the
gorge of Govett’s Leap. To the westward
the traveller can occasionally see peeps of the
beautiful Vale of Hartley, which, curiously
enough, gives its name to the next Railway
platform after Mount Victoria, upon the
mountain ridge.
Kerosene Mines in Hartley Vale.—
“The Kerosene Mines in Hartley Vale,” says
Burton, “ are well worth seeing, not alone on
account of the scenery but also because
there is some interest attaching to a success-
ful and important industry. There is a
siding laid down from the Great Western
Railway, about 3 miles from Mount Victoria,
and the goods and passenger trains may be
availed of. Visitors will be put down at the
Hartley Vale Siding if previous notice be
given to the guard. Then a walk of a mile
and a half will bring them to the face of an
almost perpendicular rock 600 feet high, up
which the shale is hoisted by a wire rope
worked by steam. The shale is conveyed to
Sydney, the bulk of it for making oil at the
Western Kerosene Company’s Works at
Waterloo, some for the manufacture of gas,
and some for export. The main road from
Mount Victoria to Bowenfels passes within 4
miles (to the south) of the mines.” The best
seam of petroleum oil coal here is 3 feet 2
inches thick. It has been pronounced by the
Examiner of Coal Fields to be equal to any
known seam in any other part of the world.
It yields from 150 to 160 gallons of crude
oil to the ton, with an illuminating power
equal to forty candles.
The Valley of the Grose. —From the
Hartley Vale Platform, on its eastern side,
the traveller may, with some necessary assist-
ance, find the best track down into the Valley
of the Grose, following that river from its
head down to the “ Junction Camp,” already
spoken of under the section of Blackheath
and Govett’s Leap, a distance of about 9
miles. The Valley of the Grose, says Mr.
Du Faur, “ may be taken as typical of the
character of the ravines by which the Blue
Mountains are intersected in all directions ;
their geological character will be treated in
a separate paper. Possessing at present
but a limited watershed of about 268 square
miles, it is bounded on the south by the
main ridge which has been chosen for the
Railway line; on the west, for about 6 miles,
by the Darling Causeway above referred to;
and on the north by the main ridge along
which ‘ Bell’s Line of Road,’ a route for
stock only, passes over Mount Tomah and
the Kurrajong Hills to Richmond. Its
course in a direct line, from the Darling
Causeway to its confluence with the Hawkes-
bury River, a little above Richmond, does
not exceed 26 miles; yet within this limited
area, through which flows a stream that
may generally be forded, though at times
an impetuous torrent, are everywhere pre-
sent evidences of the silent workings of
Time and Nature on a stupendous scale;
no sudden upheavals of volcanic force, but
the gradual disintegration due to atmos-
pheric and pluvial forces, commenced prob-
ably under very different conditions to those
obtaining at present, but still continuing.
The valley was traversed throughout in 1859
by a party of sappers and miners, with a
view to testing its practicability as a route
for the Western Railway; since that date
it has only been visited occasionally at long
intervals. In 1875 it was determined to
form a sketching and photographic camp at
about 12 miles down the valley, with a view
to roughly illustrating it, in order to bring
it under the notice of artists and lovers of
natural scenery; and also, as previously
stated, to explore a route to the foot of
Govett’s Leap Falls. On a preliminary trip,
made in July, it was found that the sappers’
and miners’ track were so overgrown, encum-
bered by fallen trees, and obliterated in parts
by landslips, that a considerable amount of
clearing was necessary to enable packhorses
to pass down the gorge with reasonable safety.
This having been done, two camps were at
last formed in October—the upper one at
about 7 miles below the Railway, and the


lower at the junction of Govett’s Leap Creek
with the river, under the magnificent cliffs
of Mount King George. The transport of
instruments and chemicals, by hand, down
such a path, and the limited time for which
the services of the photographer (supplied by
the Commissioners for the Philadelphia Exhi-
bition) were available, precluded any hope
of obtaining results of finished excellence.
Each spot, previously selected, had to be
taken when reached, irrespective of adverse
conditions of light or weather, and of chemi-
cals constantly disturbed; and the strength
of the party was altogether inadequate for
making the clearings in timber and scrub,
without which many of the finest views could
not be favourably reproduced by photography.
At the utter camp, at which operations com-
menced, a depth of 1,880 feet had been
reached; but between that point and the
Junction Camp, although the actual difference
of level was only 390 feet in 5 miles, the
track was particularly hilly, passing over the
lateral spurs which descend very abruptly to
the river bed ; in some places also the width
of the gorge is so little, in comparison to the
stupendous heights of the adjacent cliffs, that
the latter subtend a larger angle than can
be compassed by the camera. The scenery
in many parts of the river bed is remarkably
picturesque; the colours of the rocks of most
varied hues ; the foliage on the river bank,
more especially on its left bank, of a luxuri-
ance so seldom met with in the Colony ; while
the rush of the water amongst the obstruct-
ing boulders, and its perfect transparency in
the still pools or slighter rapids, affords fresh
charms to the artist at every turn —charms
which, unfortunately, cannot be reproduced
by photography.”
Mount Wilson Platform, 83 miles;
3,478 feet above sea-level. —3 miles north
of the Hartley Yale Siding, and 6 from the
Mount Victoria Station, stands the Mount
Wilson Platform , erected at the western
termination of the Bell’s Line of Road from
Richmond, between 4 and 5 miles to the
westward of Mount Wilson, from which it
takes its name.
Mount Wilson. —Speaking of Mount
Wilson itself, where the scenery is as striking
as it is uninteresting at the “Platform” of
that name, Mr. Du Faur has remarked on
the beauty of the vegetation, and the fertility
of the soil. That gentleman says—“ The
scanty vegetation and miserably stunted and
gnarled timber which everywhere surround
the tourist on the Blue Mountains and
obscure his view—except when, standing on
the edge of a precipice, he looks down on the
more luxuriant growth which is barely
visible in the gorges beneath him—detract
immensely from the interest of the scenery.
There are but two striking exceptions to this
general condition, viz., at Mount Tomah, on
Bell’s Line of Road (which is unfavourably
situated, owing to its distance from the
Railway), and at Mount Wilson, the position
of which has already been generally described.
A ride of about 5 miles (from the Mount
Wilson Platform) along the northern water-
shed of the Grose, and of about 3 miles
further along a spur trending to the north-
ward’s from Bell’s Line of Road, and leading
down into some of the heads of the Wollan-
gambe Creek and the Colo River (also
affluents of the Hawkesbury River), brings
the tourist to the foot of a ridge, which
on his right hand appears to be bounded
by the usual perpendicular escarpment of
horizontal sandstone of the Hawkesbury
formation; but the denser undergrowth,
the increased size and improved symmetry
of the trees, and the rich black soil beneath
his feet, tell of a sudden change. A few
yards further on, along a rather steep ascent
of about 1 in 7, is disclosed a charming
avenue cut through this dense undergrowth,
on a steep sideling bordered with clematis,
wild tobacco plants, native raspberry, and
other luxuriant shrubs, amongst which tower
lofty blue gums ( Eucalyptus botryoides),
stringy-bark (A. amygdalina ), black butt (A.
pilularis ), and other eucalypti, interspersed
with clumps of sassafras [Doryophora sassa-
fras), acacias, and tree ferns ( Alsophila
australis, and Dicksonia antarctica) of an
unusual height. The cause of this sudden
change is at once apparent. The upper bank
of the road is studded with boulders of
basaltic rock, a dyke of which has burst
through and overcapped the sandstone, and
its disintegration has formed the rich black
chocolate-coloured soil which has favoured


this special vegetation. A rise of 260 feet
in less than half a mile leads to the summit
of the ridge, which extends in an east-north-
east direction for about 10 miles, but has not
been fully explored for more than half that
distance. Bounded on all sides by steep
thickly wooded slopes, penetrable with diffi-
culty by man or beast, and by precipitous
cliffs, this remarkable oasis appears to have
been scarcely visited until ten years ago,
except by Mr. Surveyor Govett, who tra-
versed the western portion of it in 1832.
In 1869 the present road up the mountain
was cut by the Government, and the richer
portion of the land measured for sale; it
remained, however, unnoticed until 1875,
when the sixty-two allotments previously
measured, and containing in all about 1,025
acres, were taken up by thirty-three pur-
chasers. The distance of Mount Wilson
from the Railway,* and the large amount of
available land, barren as it is, within easier
access, has hitherto militated against its
settlement; but there can be little doubt in
the minds of those who have once visited it
that it will eventually become a favourite
resort by those requiring a change from the
relaxing climate of Sydney, as it affords a
climate as bracing as that of Tasmania, and
a vegetation and scenery not inferior to that
of New Zealand. In the winter season occa-
sional falls of snow occur, and ice lies in the
shady spots for several days together—the
thermometer falling at night as low as 22°
Eahr., and for weeks in succession below
freezing point, but the shelter afforded by
the vegetation protects the locality from the
bleakness experienced in the more exposed
parts of the mountains ; and in June and
July it is not uncommon on still bright
mornings to find the thermometer standing
at 60° in the sun, while the frost still lies
unthawed in the shade. The summit of the
ridge is chiefly covered with a dense growth
of eucalypti (the mere trunks of which almost
obscure the horizon), and in the undergrowth
* About 8 miles, by Bell’s Line of Load. After
the turning-off to Mount Wilson, “ Bell’s Line”
continues to take a south-east direction for nearly 2
miles, and then follows up a ridge to the north-east,
between the waters of Bowen’s Creek and the
affluents of the Grose, passing Mount Bell on the
right, and “The Haystack” on the left, towards
Mount Tomah and the Kurrajong.
it is no exaggeration to say that thousands
of tree ferns, ranging up to 30 feet in
height, are visible in every direction • it is on
the southern slopes that the sassafras jungle
is found, in which mosses and orchids luxu-
riate, and festoons of lianes hang from the
topmost branches. There are two peculi-
arities in this vegetation which are worthy
of notice ; (1) that the tree ferns (Alsophila
australis ) frequently bifurcate at a short
distance from the ground, and in many cases
divide into three or four, and sometimes into
five and six stems, from one root; (2) that
tree-ferns (which must be of very ancient
date) are frequently almost entirely absorbed
by the growth of forest trees (Quintinia
sieberii ) which germinating in the axles of
their fronds, send down suckers to the ground,
and enclose within their solid timber the fern
stems from which they derived their first
support. In some cases are seen ferns which,
having attained a growth of 20 feet in height,
have been laid low by the wind, and where
some portions of their heads have touched
the ground a second growth of equal altitude
has succeeded, which, in its turn, has been
subsequently enclosed by a quintinia of large
diameter, while the roots of the original tree-
fern still retain their vitality. The measured
lands on Mount Wilson include the greater
part of the rich basaltic formation inter-
spersed with poorer sandstone soil, which
frequently leads to abrupt precipices form-
ing its boundaries; from the edge of these,
extensive views are obtained over the
broken uninhabited ranges and gorges which
surround it in all directions. This scenery
extends as far as Capertee, 32 miles distant.
From other points the dividing ranges form-
ing the watershed of the Hunter River are
visible (Warra Wolong, distant 60 miles in
one direction, and Werong and Coricudgy, 50
miles in another), while from the cliffs first
mentioned as lying to the right hand of the
traveller when ascending the mountains, the
view has been considered almost unsurpassed
on the Blue Mountains : it embraces Barran-
juey (Broken Bay Heads), on the horizon to
the east, and Mount Jelore (60 miles distant),
to the south; the Flagstaff Hill, Mounts Vic-
toria, King George, Hay, and Tomah, and
the Haystack in the middle distance; and
the northern watershed of Bowen and Wol-


Lithgow Valley Zig-Zag.


langambe Creeks, a succession of broken
ravines more than a thousand feet below the
stand-point, form the foreground.” Mr. E. O.
Merewether, Mr. E. King Cox, Mr. Wynne,
Mr. Stephen, and others, are the owners
of land in this picturesque and beautiful
locality.
Clarence Siding Platform, 88 miles ;
3,658 feet above sea-level. —The line
having made a slight descent between Mount
Victoria and the Hartley Vale Siding, rises
160 feet before it reaches the Mount Wilson
Platform, and continues to rise 180 feet more
during the next 5 miles to the north-west,
when (at the Clarence Siding) its greatest
altitude is attained —upwards of 3,650 feet.
Here there are signs of cultivation, a large
siding and several houses for persons em-
ployed upon the line. At a short distance
to the west of the platform there is a tunnel
539 yards in length, lined with cemented
masonry throughout. The Mount Clarence
Tunnel is about a mile on the Sydney side of
the Lithgow Valley Zigzag. The features of
the country hei'eabouts were such that the
surveyors who marked out the line had to
be lowered down over the rocks with ropes,
the contractor having also to commence his
work in a similar way. Emerging from the
long dark tunnel the traveller finds abundant
occupation in looking about him as he is
whirled, in perfect safety, down the Great Zig-
zag, one of the greatest wonders of the Colony
—perhaps, it may be said, of the world.
The Lithgow Valley Zigzag, 92 miles.
—The Lithgow Valley, or Great Zigzag, 15
miles on the Bathurst side of the Mount
Victoria Station, has been thus compxre-
hensively described by Mr. Burton :—“ Some
of the cuttings through hard stone are from
40 to 50 feet deep, the gradient of the line
being 1 in 42, with the exception of one part
near the reversing station, which is 1 in 66.
The height of the nine arches crossing Ro. 3
Viaduct on the middle line is 76 feet from
the surface to the rail level. Just beyond
the tunnel (about the middle of the Zigzag),
which is 75 yards long and cut through the
spur of the rock, is the scene of a great
blasting operation. Three and a half tons of
gunpowder, deposited in borings made in
E
different parts of the rock to be removed,
were fired simultaneously by means of a
powerful electric battery, by the Countess of
Belmore. The next cutting is 80 feet high.
There are several other cuttings and embank-
ments, which it is unnecessary to particularize.
The fall from the Clarence Tunnel to the
bottom of the Zigzag is 687 feet; and the
length in which this descent has been gained
is 5 miles. A tolerably good view of this
great engineering achievement may be
obtained from the spurs which form the
boundary-line of the gully. The best view,
however, is undoubtedly to be obtained from
the bottom of the gully itself. The cost of
this part of the Railway was between
£20,000 and £25,000 per mile. Visitors
can go from Mount Victoria to the Zigzag
by the goods train in the morning, and re-
turn again by the passenger train in the
afternoon. They will be put down at the
foot of the Zigzag if previous notice is given
to the guards.” Rear the point-house at the
foot of the Zigzag is the entrance to a
picturesque well-watered ravine, running for
some distance back into the mountain, and a
favourite place in summer for excursion pic-
nics. A stream flows out from the spot,
joining Farmer’s Creek about a mile below
the “Lower Points.”
Eskbank, 95 miles; 3,033 feet above
sea-level, —Eskbank is the first stopping-
place arrived at after the train gets clear
of the Great Zigzag, and so enters the
Lithgow Valley. The traveller now finds
himself in a long enclosed valley, with well-
wooded hills on either side of him, and a
pretty murmuring stream (Farmer’s Creek)
running near the line in a westerly direction.
Eskbank is 3 or 4 miles on the Bathurst side
of the Zigzag, and makes a very pleasant
impression on the traveller as he enters it;
the comfortable, old-fashioned mansion of
Mr. Thomas Brown being near the platform*
to the right. Although still in a country
of great elevation, the “Mountains” may
be considered to have been passed ; and
travellers must be pleased to see that the
adjacent roads are all in a good and service-
able state. The industrial establishments of
Eskbank will be treated of under the head
of Lithgow, in which rising township it is


situated, and it is at Eskbank the principal
portion of the Railway business is done, the
Lithgow platform being merely for passenger
and parcels traffic. “ Attention,” says a
journalist, “ has rather despondently been
drawn to the supposed circumstance that an
extension of Railway to some retired inland
towns, both here and in England, not only
fails permanently to advance their relative
importance, but even that such a direct con-
nection with the more stirring centres of
population and commercial activity appears
frequently and actually to cause a sort of
retrogressive effect—especially when the
line passes further on into the depths of
a hitherto wholly undeveloped country.
There is, as in all such generalizations, no
doubt a certain degree of truth in that remark:
but it by no means conveys the true assertion
of an absolute and general fact, for very often
a decaying inland town {like Parramatta, for
example, in this Colony) will, through the
action of a Railway, gradually, and in the
most astonishing manner, revive and receive
a new and healthy impetus ; such an un-
expected reinvigoration as may also be seen
already manifesting itself at Bathurst, Goul-
burn, and elsewhere. Nor is that all; for in
many places (such as Lithgow and Blayney,
for example) which but for the Railroad must
have remained mere picturesque solitudes, the
arrival of the ‘ iron horse’ has shown a really
marvellous tendency to create industrial
centres, thriving townships, and busy
populous communities. We may take Lith-
gow as an instance of this creative action of
the Railway everywhere, and especially in
such a country as New South Wales.”
Another writer, referring to its progress,
writes—“ In no place out of Sydney within
the Colony are there to be found greater
evidence of progress in the past and solid
prosperity in the future than in the little
thriving town of Lithgow—or Lithgow, Esk-
bank, and the Yale of Clwydd, for the three
are in reality one —situated just the other side
of the Blue Mountains, and within easy reach
of Sydney by means of the Great Western
Railway. As in the instance of the won-
derful results which followed the rubbing of
the lamp whose virtues are told in Eastern
story, the wild solitudes of the mountains
have in a marvellously short space of time
answered tire call of Australian enterprise,
and what no longer back than eight years
ago was almost untouched bush, boasting but
one or two inhabitants, is to-day a busy
manufacturing community, who are solving
some of the most important problems connec-
ted with industrial pursuits in New South
Wales. Bountifully supplied as the locality
is with rich deposits of minerals and clays,
and well provided as it is with means of com-
munication by which markets in various
directions can be found, the land lay for some
time uninterfered with, and then, its great
value suddenly becoming better known and
understood, a mania to possess it seized upon
various persons and it was speedily taken up,
principally under lease.”
General description of Lithgow.—
Lithgow, 96 miles from Sydney and 49 miles
east of Bathurst, is now a rising mining and
industrial township, situated in the wider
and westerly portion of that secluded, rocky,
glen into which the Western Railway
abruptly descends by the well-known Great
Zigzag. This town, called into existence
by the Railway, and not above ten years
old, already numbers over 2,000 inhabitants ;
having several excellent hotels, stores, and
dwelling-houses, with a handsome and com-
modious Bank, Telegraph Office, Court-house,
Public School, Insurance Offices, Assembly
Rooms, Club-houses, and such like com-
mercial and social institutions. Everywhere
substantial buildings are in the course of
erection in its long wide streets, and every
day some new sign of the rapid develop-
ment of this Railway township is forced
upon the observation of the astonished visitor,
Lithgow stands in the entrance or more
open part of Lithgow Yalley—a picturesque
locality, enclosed by precipitous, well-wooded
mountains, and is undeniably a place which
but for the Railway would most certainly
have remained to the end of time —as it did
for countless ages after creation, and for
many long years subsequent to the founda-
tion of this Colony—unknown to the civilized
world, and utterly useless and unproductive.
In this town and its immediate neighbourhood
are four collieries in active operation, with
iron works, pottery and terra-cotta works,
copper-smelting works, a lime-kiln, a tweed


factory, a tannery, a brewery, and such like
industries. Coal is of course cheap and
good, and firewood (as yet) abundant; water
also is plentiful and of an excellent quality.
At almost all of the collieries coal is readily
obtained by running “ drives ” into the hill-
sides, which is a decided economy of labour.
Good pipeclay and fireclay are to be found every-
where, and potteries and brick-kilns are there-
fore attached to most of these establishments.
The Lithgow Yalley Colliery Company’s
Works are carried on at the distance of about
a quarter of a mile from the Lithgow platform,
and close to the mouth of the colliery the
same Company are engaged in brick, pipe,
and tile making. The seam of coal operated
upon by the Lithgow Valley Coal Company
is 10 feet in thickness, and is worked from
the adit. There is a tramway with a
siding to the adjacent trunk line, by means
of which the coal can in all weathers be
expeditiously despatched to the market.
The coal, on “ skips” or trucks, is drawn out
laterally from the mine by a small steam-
engine with a tail rope of wire. The tram-
way on entering this mine follows the dip
of the seam for about a quarter of a mile,
and then the skips are loaded from the
workings. The coal is finally transferred
from the skips by a platform and shoot at
the pit mouth into the waggons, in which it
is thence taken away to the line by Govern-
ment engines. The number of men con-
stantly employed on this colliery is twenty.
Two horses are engaged for wheeling the coal
in the skips inside of the mine. The brick
and tile works of the same Company, adja-
cent to the mine, within half a mile of the
Railway, are well deserving of a visit. Here
(by machinery) are made fire-bricks, pressed
bricks, and common bricks. They also make
sanitary drain-pipes (for sewers) of a very
superior quality and of large size—from 3
inches to 2 feet in diameter. Drain-pipes of
a small size, for the purpose of draining land,
are also here made to order for agriculturists.
These are from 2 inches in diameter up to 6
inches. Tiles of various shapes and colours
are here also deftly manufactured. A first-
class machine is here now for tbe purpose of
making bricks by steam, and this enables the
Company to turn out 12,000 bricks per diem,
and to furnish tiles of various descriptions to
order, with equal expedition and perfect
finish. The bricks are made by the dry
process and by the semi-plastic process.
Clay for that purpose abounds ; and the fire-
clay (supposed to be quite equal to any found
in the Australian Colonies) is all obtained
from the shale, crushed by a disintegrator
worked by steam. In the kilns the bricks,
pipes, and mouldings for windows, &c., &c.,
are burnt by the over-draft. The fire-bricks
here made have been well tested, and have
been proved to be of far better quality than
than those commonly sent out from the Home
Country. In the brick and tile works of
the Lithgow Yalley Coal Company there is
a steam-engine of 40-horse power, working
with a wire-rope on a barrel, by means of
which coal is not only brought up for imme-
diate consumption, on a tramway from the
pit mouth, but all the elaborate machinery
is moved for the pipe, tile, and brick making.
The same engine is also connected with a
pump to keep water out of the mine and to
supply the same element for the brick-making,
etc. There are large sheds for drying the
bricks, pipes, and tiles; and hard by also
stand constantly shifting stacks of all that
has been manufactured for sale. The brick-
making machine on a new model (by White-
head, of Preston, in Lancashire) is the
first of the kind ever imported into this
Colony. The new disintegrator works at 500
revolutions per minute, having a double
motion of the wheels. To an inquiring mind
all the details of this elaborate machinery
(including mixing-pan, pug-mill, &c.) for
moulding and making these pipes with a
wonderful speed and precision, are extremely
interesting. The pipes can be made of what-
ever sizes or patterns may be required. The
products of these works are taken down by
a small tramway to the siding of tbe Rail-
way, which runs back from the line to the
mouth of the coal-mine.
The Eskbank Iron and Coal Company’s
Works are situated on the north side of the
line, near to the Eskbank Station. These
works stand near the steep slopes of several
thickly-wooded hills, a locality well adapted
in every respect by nature and by art to
its present appointed purpose. A peren-
nial stream of good water, having its source
in the adjacent heights, flows through the


property of the Company ; the ore operated
upon is found in quantities on the low
flat near the foundry (just beneath the
surface) on a neighbouring hill to the
north-east, but a considerable quantity is
brought from outside sources. Coal may
be readily procured for this Company on
their own ground, and freestone, loam, and
sand are all ready to hand. Here the
Proprietary Company have a large blast
furnace, capable of producing from 100 to
120 tons of pig iron per week, a 70-horse-
power engine, two boilers, and all other
needful apparatus. There is also a foundry
connected with the great furnace producing
castings for the rolling mills. The Company
make their own castings for use, and can
supply whatever may be in demand. They
have likewise a puddling furnace for con-
verting “ pigs ” into malleable iron ; and
their rolling mills, recently erected, are
capable of rolling 100 tons per week. A
recent reliable authority (Essay on New South
Wales, p. 76) states that the ores in the area
of these works consist of—“ (1) Beds of
clayband stone, varying from 6 to 15 inches
thick, cropping out of the surface, and
averaging 40 per cent, of metal; (2) red
silicious ore, of which the bed is about 4
feet, yielding 22 per cent. ; and (3) a bed
2 feet of brown hematite, yielding 50 per
cent. A 10-foot seam of splint-coal crops
out on the property, overlying a seam of fire-
clay, from which fire-bricks have been made
which have stood the severest test of the
Mint Assayer.” Commodious houses for the
miners and other employes of the Company
(quite a neat little village) stand at the north-
east corner of the area of the works. The
Eskbank Iron and Coal Company (who have
here manifested an intelligence, public spirit,
and enterprise beyond all praise) of course
make their own fire-bricks for their furnaces
from the clay found on their land. In
addition to the large area occupied by these
works, the Company have also 1,400 acres
of land containing well nigh inexhaustible
supplies of iron ore; limestone, and coal
within 10 miles of the works, and close to
the Wallerawang Railway Station. The
foundation-stone of these works was laid by
the Hon. John Sutherland, the Minister for
Works, on the 2nd of January, 1875, and
they were completed in December in that
year.
The Eskbank Colliery is in the vicinity of
the pleasant, old-fashioned country seat of
Mr. T. Brown. This colliery (which imme-
diately adjoins the Railway on its southern
side) is worked by a steam-engine, platform,
and shoot, &c., and commands every facility
for sending off the coal pxxxluced. The
engine is of 12-horse power, and the shoot of
an approved construction.
The Eskbank Copper-smelting Works are
carried on close to Mr. Brown’s colliery.
This interesting and valuable industry is
going on prosperously, the ore, here con-
verted into shining ingots of copper, being
forwarded to this spot by rail from different
parts of the country, and chiefly from the
Western District.
Higher up the Lithgow Valley (but still in
the immediate vicinity of Lithgow) are the
spacious slaughter-houses designed by the late
Mr. T. S. Mort, for service in connection
with the well-known enterprising plan of that
lamented citizen and true patriot, for freezing
meat for exportation to England. These
buildings, constructed after an admirable
design, at an immense expense of money and
labour, are not at present in use. The
establishment has engine-houses and engines,
and an unrivalled mechanical apparatus for
ventilating and cleaning these abattoirs,
at which 2,000 sheep a day can conveni-
ently be slaughtered and dressed. The
whole premises are fitted up in the most
perfect manner, and so arranged that the
temperature can always be kept down to
50 degrees Fahrenheit. Meat can here be
kept without damage for eight days, and
then with due care be successfully preserved.
The fan of the engine for driving the air and
ventilating the place can make 2,000 revolu-
tions in a minute. Mort’s slaughter-house
and stores for preserved meat are on the
same side of the Line as the Eskbank Iron-
works.
The Vale of Clwydd Colliery Works stand
on the south side of the Railway, further up
the Valley, and nearer to the Zigzag, at
the edge of a swampy glen, through which
there is now a very fair road leading (by a
short cut) directly over a gap in the moun-
tains to Hartley and Hartley Vale. The


Vale of Clwydd Colliery, though close to
Lithgow, is shut out from it by a gentle
eminence. A sort of village, or rather
hamlet, embosomed iix the hills and woods,
has here sprung up, the miners’ homes in
this spot being perhaps less comfortable than
picturesque. Their habitations axe for the
most part hxxts of mud or wood j but some,
manifesting an Arab-like independence,
apparently prefer to live in tents. In
this colliery there is a perpendicular shaft
sunk to about 250 feet below the sui’face;
and from this shaft there are long drives
in various directions, the prevalence of water
ixx one of them, which runs under a neigh-
bouring swamp, beixxg often rather trouble-
some to the engineer and inconvenient to the
miners. Good limestoxxe is found with the
coal, and is burned on the spot, for use and
for sale. Here also (as ixx the neighbourhood
of Mr. T. Brown’s colliery) copper-sxxxeltixxg
works have been established. A traxxxway
coxxnects this colliery with the Westerxx
Railway.
Oxx tire northern side of the Railway, axxd
conxxected with it by a braxxch line, is the
Bowenfels Coal-mine. This mine is the fur’-
thest xvest of the LithgOAV Collieries, axxd is at
present least actively Avorked.
About a mile or so from Lithgow, oxx the
other (Avestern) side of the township, and
xxot far from the Bowenfels Station, is a
tweed factory, built by Mr. AxxdreAv Btoavxx.
Ixx this long brick axxd stone building (which
contrasts curiously Avith Mr. A. BroAvn’s
pretty rural homestead axxd gardens) about
forty hands find coxxstant axxd remuu erative
employment. Ixx the factory are tAventy-four
power looxxxs, three sets of carding machines,
axxd all the other requisite appliances, £lB,OOO
having beexx here ixxvested ixx the best axxd
xxxost recently devised machixxery. 4,000
yards of good txveed are here manufactured
every week, the beautiful fabric so nxade
finding a ready sale at Sydney axxd ixx the
adjacent Colonies, where (for the ixxtegrity of
its Avorkmanship) it is justly esteemed. The
avool used is of course Colonial- — brought
from the ixxterior to this spot by the Railroad,
axxd here prepared for use. The machixxery
is driven by steaxxx power'. Cottages Lave
been erected for the Avox'kpeople, of whom
forty are employed, xxear to the Avails of the
factory. To the south of the factory, on
the road towards Hartley, at the distance of
a mile or so, and soon after you have passed
the village near the station, there is a
tannery.
Excursion from Lithgow to Hartley.—
A pleasant excursion may be made from
lithgow to Hartley, either on horseback or
in a buggy; starting from Lithgow at an
early hour, and going round the mountain
past Bowenfels. Bowenfels and Hartley, two
small townships on the Old Western Road,
are separated from the Lithgow Valley by a
steep chain of sandstone hills, forming a
spur or off-shoot of the Blue Mountain
range to the westward. These eminences,
on their southern face, terminate abruptly
towards the Valley of Hartley, in boldly
defined precipices, which go by the fanciful
name of “ Hassan’s Walls,” and overhang
the road, south-easterly, to Hartley, for
several miles. The views from the summits
of these grey masses of rock are said to
be grand and extensive; and along the
irregular line which they disclose and guai’d
are several cascades and almost inaccessible
glens, of more wildness perhaps than
beauty. From the heights of Hassan’s
Walls the country in the direction of
Mudgee and of Bathurst is distinguishable
for a great distance. The tourist’s road
from Lithgow lies first to the westward,
along the side of the Railway, for rather more
than a ixxile; he then turns sharply off to
the left (near the schoolhouse to the east of
Coerwull) and so follows down the Old Road,
southerly, as far as Bowenfels, just round
the end of the mountain range. In this road
there is much agxeeable scenery—first, the
tweed factory, away in the fields, with Mr.
A. Brown’s house and gardens; then a
tanneiy, a good country-house, and an old
road-side inn ; then a quaixxt old church and
chux’chyard ; and last, not least, a lock-up.
This is Bowenfels. On gaining the elevated
ground to the west of the end of the sand-
stone range a fine view of the Hai’tley
Valley is obtained. When you get round
into Bowenfels another and more extensive
view is opened up to the south-east—looking
down towards the Victoria Pass. The now
somewhat decayed village of Bowenfels has


still many large houses in it, and is a cheer-
ful, healthy, and pleasantly situated spot.
By a turn in the road, soon after leaving it
en route for Hartley, you come full in sight
of Hassan’s Walls, at an end of which (to
the southward) towers a curiously isolated
rock, presenting a singularly exact facial
outline peculiar to the “ Great Iron Duke,”
but loyally and rather absurdly called “ King
George’s Head”—being probably one of the
discoveries of the Georgian era. Some of
the distant country of the Great Cunimbla
Valley may now be perceived as you come
down the winding road; where, in many of
its essential features of copse, headland, and
streamlet there is a great resemblance to the
scenery of South Devon in England. The
road itself is pretty, and along it are poor
but picturesque homesteads—such as cottages
and gardens, old inns with oak-trees, and
other attractive features—until you reach
the end of the wall of cliffs already men-
tioned. Then there is a dull mile or two
before you come to the edge of the deep
descent into Hartley, standing on the rocky
banks of the murmuring Lett, about a mile
or so above the point where it falls into the
river Cox, draining the whole region from
beyond Bowenfels, until it finally falls into
the Wollondilly. At the foot of the last hill
you pass over the Lett by a very fair wooden
bridge, and so, entering Hartley, you find it
a quaint old-fashioned place. Here you can
put up at the village inn, and either return
by the road you came, or (sending back the
horse or trap) regain the line by walking on
to Mount Victoria ; or you may ride across
the mountain to the north, over the “ Gap,”
and so back again into Lithgow. For an
invalid or an over-wrought jaded man there
can be few more acceptable retreats than
Hartley. It has two pretty stone churches,
a Court-house, and a store or two, but it is
quite a rural village. The distance from
Lithgow to Hartley, as above indicated, is
about 10 miles. Across the mountain, by
the new road over the “ Gap,” it is not more
than 6.
Bowenfels Station, 97 miles; 2,972
feet above sea-level. —Bowenfels station—
-3 or 4 miles north of the town of Bowenfels,
and 1 mile north-west of Lithgow—is by no
means a large place, the majority of the
houses being at Cooerwull, a short distance
from the line. The district is agricultural,
pastoral, and mining. The surrounding
country is mountainous and well wooded.
Between this place and the next Railway
Station —Wallerawang to the north-west—
there is a rather dreary track, with tunnels
and cuttings.
Marangaroo Platform, 101 miles;
3,073 feet above sea-level. —Marangaroo
is a platform, 4 miles west of Bowenfels
Station and 4 miles east of Wallerawang.
It is one of the most elevated spots between
the Great Zigzag and Bathurst. A short
distance beyond the platform the train passes
through Marangaroo platform, 264 yards in
length.
Wallerawang Station, 105 miles; 2,928
feet above sea-level. —Wallerawang is a
small but busy place, being the spot where
the line to Mudgee joins the Great Western
line. Wallerawang has a small street, with
Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian,
and Wesleyan places of worship—and a
Public School, capable of holding 120 chil-
dren. The Inns are—the “Royal Hotel,”
the “ Commercial Hotel,” and the “ Railway
Inn.” 7 miles from Wallerawang is Wolgon,
a sunken valley, which is very beautiful, and
well worth a visit. The district is principally
agricultural, although it possesses mineral
resources which only need developing.
Rydal Station, 111 miles; 3,117 feet
above sea-level. —Returning to the Main
Western line, soon after passing Wallerawang
the line trends sharply to the south-west, and,
rising to a somewhat higher level, passes to
the eastward of Honeysuckle Hill. Before
the line takes its southerly turn the road to
Rylstone (which has been running near to
the rails) branches off to the northward.
Rydal is but a small place, with a quaint-
looking stone church and three inns. These
inns are the “Globe Hotel,” the “Free-
masons’ Hotel,” and the “Commercial Hotel.”
Country adjacent—agricultural and pastoral;
rugged mountain scenery, and heavily timbered.
Near Rydal, on the southern side of the line,
is the extraordinary rock known as “Evans’


Crown.” Within the last few years a great
impetus has been given to the trade of Ilydal
by the discovery of the rich silver mines at
Sunny Corner (Mitchell) 15 miles from the
Station. A large population has already been
gathered to the vicinity, and the field pro-
mises to last for many years giving large
returns.
Sodwalls Platform, 114 miles; 2,850
feet above sea-level.— After passing Ilydal
the line begins to descend, and continues to
do so, following the winding valley of the
Fish River, towards Bathurst. The country
adjoining the Sodwalls Platform is of an
agricultural character, with farms and some
sort of cultivation; —rather pretty. The
traveller has now left the County of Cook,
and is pushing on, westerly, through the
County of Westmoreland. It is hereabouts
that he catches the first glimpse of the Fish
River —a stream which he has to cross nine-
teen times before he finally leaves it, not far
from Macquarie Plains. The Fish River
having joined the Campbell River, a few
miles south of Bathurst, becomes thenceforth
known as “Macquarie,” the native name of
which is “Wambool.” The Macquarie is an
affluent of the Darling.
Tarana Station, 120 miles; 2,561 feet
above sea-level. —At Tarana Station there
is a watering-place for the engines. It is a
pretty place, but dull. The country round
about is partly used for agricultural and
pastoral purposes. In the Isabella District,
50 miles away, a large quantity of tobacco is
grown. There is one hotel at Tarana—
Fawcett’s. Here you can get a carriage or
buggy and go to Mutton Falls, westerly,
about 4 miles off From the Mutton Falls
you can ride or drive to a small township
called Oberon —a good agricultural settlement,
with mineral resources —and go on thence to
the Fish River Caves. Tarana, 35 miles
from the Fish River Caves, is the most con-
venient point of the line to those vast
limestone caverns. There is some nice
scenery along the road in that direction.
The Fish River Caves. —The celebrated
limestone caverns on the Fish River (near
O’Connell in the neighbourhood of Bathurst),
commonly known as the Fish River Caves,
are of vast extent, and singularly attractive;
having a great variety of very intricate
galleries or passages, only to be traversed
safely under the care of the experienced local
guide employed by the Government. The
subterraneous scenes herein disclosed are
indeed magnificent —well worth the time and
trouble of paying them a visit. There is a
whole group of these grand subterraneous
halls and bewildering galleries, and each one
of the series is known by a different name;
the Hew Cave, Lucas Cave, the Bell Cave,
the Lurline Cave, the Imperial Cave, the
Elder-tree Cave, &c. Several objects of great
interest are to be viewed at and in the Fish
River Caves; and amongst these are the
Great Archway, the Carlotta Arch, the
Meeting of the Creeks, the Pinnacle Rock,
the interiors, the outside entrances, the
waterfall, and adjacent woodland scenes.
The Carlotta Arch—a curious natural arch-
way in the rocks —excites much astonishment
and admiration. These caves, so remarkable
for their stalactitic and stalagmiticformations,
are of such an immense extent that whole
days are necessary for their due exploration.
One of these enormous caverns is estima-
ted to be not less than 500 feet in height,
and of a proportionate length and breadth.
The strange forms gradually assumed by
the drippings of the limestone rocks through-
out are almost infinite, and not to be any-
where else surpassed in beauty. In one
place there is the weird, rock-like semblance
of a well-stocked menagerie; and in another
place the pendants from the roof and slabs
below are of a still more fantastic and
extraordinary character. When lighted up
with the magnesium wire these sublime
palaces, “which Nature’s hands have deftly
formed,” present a truly gorgeous spectacle,
being filled with delicate pendants and
drooping sprays, gigantic columns and
shadowy arches—all resplendent with
dazzling, illusive gems. In the “Hew Cave”
the scene developed by the magnesium light
is described (by Burton) as “ one of surpassing
loveliness,” the appearance of a heavy fall of
snow being produced; the rocks in the rear
presenting to the imagination a black, frown-
ing sky. Occasionally a sparkling waterfall
heightens the effect of the scene. The caves


are in the charge of Mr. Jeremiah Wilson,
who receives remuneration from the Govern-
ment. It was found desirable to place
them under control, as visitors often com-
mitted ruthless destruction. The Govern-
ment has had constructed a number of wire
ladders for the convenience of visitors in
ascending and descending some of the caves.
Underneath the Imperial Cave, said by the
late Professor Denton to be one of the finest in
the world, a swiftly running stream of water
has been found, and a visit to the underground
river is one of the most sensational of the
cave sights. To visit the caves comfortably
the best way to proceed is for a number of
friends to form themselves into a party. The
guide, Mr. J. Wilson, has recently constructed
a comfortable cottage on a little grassy plot
near to the entrance to the principal caves.
Mr. Wilson provides, if required, provisions
and attendance for visitors. If requested
(by letter) Mr. Wilson will meet a party at
Tarana with horses or a waggonette. It will
greatly lessen the fatigue of the journey from
Tarana to the Fish River Caves and increase
the comfort of the tourists if the party of
excursionists stop for the night en route ,
either at Mr. Wilson’s house, at Oberon, or
at one of the two hotels, viz., the “Royal”
and “ Welcome Inn.”
A fuller description of the caves, contributed
by C. S. Wilkinson, Government Geological
Surveyor, will be found in the Appendix.
Locksley’s Platform, 130 miles; 2,428
feet above sea-level. —The country in the
neighbourhood of Locksley Platform is on
the whole not interesting, but there are
views on the line near it not unworthy of
some notice. This platform was formerly
known as Locke’s.
Brewongle, 135 miles; 2,476 feet
above sea-level. —Leaving Locke’s Plat-
form behind him to the eastward, the rail-
way traveller passes through an open treeless
country, having only here and there a few
patches of bush. Then undulating plains,
with sheep and cattle feeding, are opened
up ; and so the traveller, after an interval
of 5 miles, finds himself opposite to the
well-built station of Brewongle—being
on the easterly boundary of that singular
tract of country adjoining Bathurst, and
giving to that city one of its distinctive
appellations. A good deal of wheat is grown
in the vicinity of Brewongle. The district
offers good shooting to sportsmen; hares
are very numerous, and excellent sport can
be had at but a little distance from the
station. Brewongle receives traffic for
O’Connell, a township with a population of
about 200, 3 miles distant, and for Wise-
man’s Creek, 7 miles, where a copper-mine
is worked. Tobacco is also cultivated in the
district.
Raglan Station, 140 miles; 2,436 feet
above sea-level. —Raglan is a station in the
midst of the Macquarie Plains, where a road
from the north of that tract joins on to the
Old Western Road. Here you first catch a
distant but impressive view of the city of
Bathurst, to the westward. At Raglan there
is an Anglican Church and a Public School.
Kelso Station, 143 miles ; 2,154 feet
above sea-level. —Kelso Station is the
stopping-place on the Railway for Kelso, a
populous suburb of Bathurst, on the eastern
side of the Fish River, or (as it is here
called) the “ Macquarie.” The Bathurst city
station is 2 miles distant to the south-
westward.
Bathurst Station, 145 miles; 2,153
feet above sea-level. —Bathurst, the “City
of the Plains” and metropolis of the west-
ern geographical division of the Colony, is
situated on the left bank of the Macquarie
River, 145 miles from Sydney. Originally
founded by Governor Macquarie, on 7th of
May, 1815, just after the discovery of the
country beyond the Blue Mountains, it has
gradually risen to its present position of great
influence and established wealth. A whole
book might be written about this city, but
the description of it in an “ itinerary ” must
necessarily be very brief; notwithstanding its
political, social, and physical importance. A
few miles before reaching Bathurst, the
traveller cannot help being struck with the
altered appearance of the country. Instead
of wooded mountains and ridges of sandstone,


the eye rests everywhere on a fine open
tract, about 12 miles square, almost devoid
of trees, and covered with a rich soil. This
treeless character becomes still more con-
firmed when the traveller passes the Bre-
wongle Station, but the aspect of the
country is undulating, and even hilly at
times, though usually and familiarly spoken
of as “plains.” Bathurst occupies a command-
ing situation, on a gradual westward slope
down to the Macquarie, with a beautiful and
extensive prospect in every direction for miles
around. Within comparatively a short dis-
tance of the city gold and copper mines are
worked. The climate, like that of a town in
England, is frequently very cold in the
winter months, but extremely healthy and
invigorating. In some respects Bathurst
is entitled to be considered as next in rank
to the capital. It is laid out in blocks of
10 chains square, with many miles of streets
99 feet wide lighted by gas ; and it is the
seat of a Bishopric, both in the Anglican
and the Roman Catholic Churches. There
are two Cathedrals, with colleges in connec-
tion with each of the laxgest communions,
and a handsome Presbyterian Church ; also
a Wesleyan Church, and other places of
worship. The Roman Catholic Cathedral,
although not quite completed, is a noble
structure, and near it stands the convent
and its school, in buildings of an imposing
appearance. There is a School of Arts, with
4,000 volumes, a fine Hall, excellent stores,
banks, and hotels; local newspapers are
here published, as at all the principal inland
towns. The annual receipts of the Bathurst
Hospital amount, it is said, to over £SOO.
Bathurst also possesses a large gaol and a
splendid range of Government buildings, Post
and Telegraph Office, &c., which are probably
the best out of Sydney. Bathurst enjoys
the advantage of a great variety of local
institutions, and was proclaimed a munici-
pality in 1862. The population of Bathurst
and its environs is now 7,500. At the
Bathurst Station (on the south side of the
city) there is a large and convenient refresh-
ment-room for the use of travellers. Persons
intending either to go inland towards Orange,
or “up” the line, towards Mount Victoria,
will do well to remember this. The places
near Bathurst are—Black Springs, Box
Ridge, Caloola, Cow Flat, Dirty Swamp,
Dunkeld, Duramana (or Back Creek), Evan’s
Plains, Glanmire, The Lagoons, Limekilns,
Meadow Flat, Mitchell’s Creek, Oberon,
O’Connell, Palmer’s Oakey, Peel, Quartz
Ridge, Rockley, Sofala, Trunkey, Turon, and
Wattle Flat. Coaches run from Bathurst to
Sofala, Hill End, and districts.
Perth Platform, 149 miles ; 2,225 feet
above sea-level. —The platform of Perth,
4 miles from Bathurst, presents nothing
remarkable. The adjacent country is of an
open character, with peculiar-looking bare
hills beyond it. Between Bathurst and Perth
several country residences and farms are
passed.
George’s Plains Station, 151 miles;
2,260 feet above sea-level. —There is some
fine scenery, with a wide stretch of arable
country, lying between Perth Platform and
the George’s Plains Station, a distance of
about 2 miles. The Station is the centre of
an extensive agricultural district, and a large
traffic is done. 6 miles from the station are
the Cow Flat Copper Mines, and 13 miles the
Thompson’s Creek or Burraga Mines. Bur-
raga is an extensive and rich mineral district,
and gives employment to a considerable
number of men,
Wimbledon Platform, 158 miles; 2,737
feet above sea-level. —The Wimbledon
Platform is a convenient stopping-place for
the inhabitants of an extensive tract of
agricultural country, 34 miles from Orange
and 13 from Bathurst. Near Wimbledon is
the fine country residence of Mr. Joseph
Smith.
Newbridge Platform, 164 miles ; 2 877
feet above sea-level. —Newbridge, a rising
place, is the nearest point on the Great
Western Railway to the town of “ Arthur”
and the Trunkey Diggings, 16 miles distant.
Situated 19 miles west of Bathurst, and 28
miles east of Orange, Newbridge has already
three hotels and numerous other houses
spi’inging up. Near Newbridge good iron
fire-clay can readily be procured. The Bell
Flat Diggings lie away to the left as you
come in from Bathurst, across a beautiful


tract of cultivated country. Near the Trun-
key Creek Diggings are the Pine Ridge and
the Grove Oaves, &c. There is a fine and
comprehensive view over the whole country
to the north-east, a mile or two to the west-
ward of the Newbridge Platform—on the
line towards Blayney, at the Stringy-bark
Cuttings. Newbridge was formerly known
as Back Creek, The name by which it is
known in the Post Office Directory is the
aboriginal name of Duramana. The roads
lead south by the shortest way to Caloola,
where alluvial gold is still being worked, to
Tuena, and to Trunkey, at one time the scene
of great activity in quartz-mining. Quanti-
ties of wool and live stock also arrive at the
station from the surrounding districts, so
that Newbridge is likely to become a very
important position in connection with the
traffic on the Great Western Railway. An
iron mine has been opened within 300 yards
of the Railway Station, A deposit of asbestos
has been discovered about 2 miles away.
Blayney Station, 172 miles ; 2,841 feet
above sea-level. —Blayney is one of the
new and rising townships owing its prosperity
like Lithgow, to the Railway. It is quite a
new place, and promises soon to be a large
town ; for it is the centre of a great squatting
district, and is closely connected with mining
interests, while in the surrounding districts
large quantities of wheat are grown. The
town possesses four churches, two flour-mills,
a brewery, Court-house, and handsome Post
and Telegraph Office. The principal hotels
are the “ Royal,” 4 £ Club House,” “Albion,”
“Cosmopolitan,” “Commercial,” “Exchange,”
and “Criterion. ” Blayney stands on the Belu-
bula River, 8 miles from the junction of the
roads from Calder and Grenfell. Prom this
station fat stock are sent “up” by the trains,
in large numbers for the Sydney Market.
There are churches for the Anglicans and
Presbyterians; and a Roman Catholic church
is building on the right side of the line.
There are also two large flour-mills at
work. To the right, as the traveller goes
towards Orange, there is (beyond Blayney) a
curious conical hill. Coaches run from Blay-
ney to Carcoar, Cowra, and Grenfell, and
districts. Blayney will in a few years be-
come a place of still greater importance, for it
is from here that a Railway-line is being con-
structed to meet the Great Southern Railway
at Murrumburrah. In addition to this line,
opening up much fertile country, and provid-
ing for many populous districts, it will afford
travellers from the far Western to reach the
Southern districts without the necessity of
first going to Sydney. It will also encourage
communication between Melbourne and the
far distant Western districts, and no doubt
when the line is constructed large numbers of
cattle will be sent from Dubbo, Bourke, and
other pastoral centres to the Victorian capital.
The construction of the line will shorten the
rail journey between Melbourne and the
western towns beyond Blayney to the extent
of 375 miles.
Milthorpe Station, 179 miles; 3,138
feet above sea-level. —This Station is the
most elevated of any on the Main Line
between Lithgow and the Western terminus.
The country around is open bush land,
and used for pastoral and agricultural pur-
poses. Goods are received at Spring Grove
for Icely, Byng, Gulgong, Forest Reefs,
Cadia, &c. Spring Grove is in the centre of
a mining district, rich gold-mines being situ-
ated at Forest Reefs, 6 miles, and extensive
copper-mines at Byng. A large flour-mill is
noticeable after leaving the station.
Spring Hill Station, 183 miles; 3,086
feet above sea-level. —The country here-
abouts is not very interesting. The land,
divided by queer-looking fences, is used for
agricultural and pastoral purposes.
Huntley Platform, 186 miles ; about
3,000 feet above sea-level. —A small plat-
form between the Spring Hill Station and
Orange, about 6 miles from the latter town-
ship. Between Huntley and Orange the Orange
Meat-preserving Company have established
works. Large paddocks surround the works,
in which the stock are kept till required.
The machinery, refrigerators, &c., are of the
latest and most approved kind. The works
are divided into five chambers, capable of
holding some hundreds of sheep and cattle.
The meat is dispatched by special trucks to
Sydney, and loaded without delay into the
refrigerating chambers of the steamers ap


pointed to receive it. A number of ship-
ments of meat from this Company have been
placed successfully on the London market.
At the present time this industry is not in
working.
Orange Station, 192 miles ; 2,843 feet
above sea-level. —Between Spring Hill
and Orange the railway traveller will find
arable land under cultivation on either side
of the line. Orange is one of the most
progressive towns of the Colony, remark-
able, amongst other things, for the unusual
excellence of its hotels, stores, and banks.
It adjoins a fertile and wealthy district,
and is the busy centre of a considerable
amount of trade of all kinds, agricultural, pas-
toral, and mining. The manufactories include
three breweries, three large flour-mills, saw-
mill, boot factory and tannery, brickworks,
timber-yards, &c. The town is well laid
out ; the wide, well-built streets presenting
an imposing and well nigh metropolitan
appearance. The population by last Census
was 2,700. Orange has a School of Arts, a
Masonic Hall, a Hospital, Churches for the
four chief Denominations, and other places
of public worship. There are two large
Schools, a commodious Court-house, and
three local newspapers. The principal hotels
are—-The “Royal,” the “Club-house Hotel,”
the “Occidental Hotel,’’and “Kenna’s Hotel,”
opposite to the Railway Station. Orange is
in the centre of a large and rich auriferous
district, and it was here (at Ophir) the first gold
was discovered in Australia. Ophir is still
worked, and reefing is being carried on with
considerable success in the fields around, viz.,
at Belmore, Lucas Gully, Jaw-bone, Golden
Point, Blacksprings, and at Lucknow. Orange
is surrounded by a reliable agricultural dis-
trict, rust being unknown, and even in the
dry seasons the crops around Orange have
not been affected as in many other parts of
the Colony. Orange is also the centre of
a large and important pastoral area, goods
being received here for Parkes, Forbes, Con-
dobolin, stations on the Lachlan, Cudal,
Cargo, Cadia, &c. A large portion of this
traffic will however be lost when the Railway
line to Forbes is constructed. Orange possesses
a handsome Railway Station, the appearance
of which is much enhanced by the well-kept
garden, gay with flowers, immediately in
front of the Station-house.
For some time Orange was the terminal
station for the Western line. In June,
1880, the extension westward was opened to
Wellington, and since then extensions have
been opened to the Western Terminus,
Bourke. A railway has been approved of
by Parliament from Orange to Wilcannia, on
the Darling, via Forbes.
Extension, Orange to Molong. —The
extension from Orange to Molong was
opened at the close of last year (1885), and
it has proved a great boon to the many
settlers in and about the district. The
extension joins the Western Pailway two
miles from Orange, and is about 22 miles in
length. The line passes through a country
well watered by the Cheeseman’s, Boree, and
Molong Creeks, and the district is largely
devoted to agriculture. The country is of
basaltic formation and the timber principally
box. There are stopping places between
Orange and Molong at Amaros, Borenore,
and Cargo Road, provided for local traffic.
Molong is a town of some importance, num-
bering over 1,000 inhabitants, and is a
municipality. It possesses ample hotel accom-
modation and a considerable business is
transacted. As the district is well settled
principally by farmers, the crops grown
being wheat—in connection with which there
are two flour mills —oats, maize, and Hay,
while a large variety of fruits grow par-
ticularly well in the district, including grapes,
cherries, apples, and plums. This place also
possesses mineral resources, being the centre
of a gold-field, and in addition silver has
lately been discovered and copper. Splendid
flagging is obtainable and abundance of lime.
Molong being the terminus of the line
receives a large quantity of goods. Forbes
(partly), Parkes, Obley, Cummock, Buckin-
bar, Yarra Bell River, etc., drawing supplies
from this station. The district is not devoid
of the picturesque. The country is hilly, and
some splendid views are to be had of the
Conoblas and in the Continubul mountains.
Mullion Creek, 203 miles : 2,827 feet
above sea-level. —After leaving Orange a
fair amount of cultivated land is seen on


each side of the Railway, but the greater
portion of the country is devoted to pastoral
purposes, grass being plentiful in good seasons.
11 miles from Orange, Mullion Creek is
reached, the line crossing the creek by a
bridge of three 26-feet timber openings. The
Railway between these two places is com-
paratively level, Mullion Creek being only
16 feet lower than Orange. The only signs
of population about Mullion Creek are the
Railway Station buildings and a few scat-
tered hamlets in the vicinity. The station
only receives a small local traffic, principally
agricultural.
Warne, 217 miles: 2,072 feet above
sea-level. —After leaving Mullion Creek the
line commences to descend from the higher
table-lands towards the lower interior plains,
there being a fall of nearly 800 feet between
Mullion Creek and Warne, a distance of 14
miles. The cuttings between these two
stations are both numerous and heavy, and
some of the gradients severe, running as
steep as lin 40. The line passes through a
rough, broken country, of a poor description.
At Kerr’s Creek, 7 miles beyond Mullion
Creek, a large dam has been constructed, for
storing water for the use of the locomotives,
Warne is but a small village, but the station
is the centre of a rich agricultural district,
stretching to the west towards Molong, and
on the eastern side the district is occupied by
sheep runs. The only inn at Warne is the
“Warne Hotel,”
Ironbarks, 227 miles : 1,780 feet above
sea-level. —After leaving Warne the charac-
ter of the country changes, being more open
and lightly timbered, presenting the appear-
ance of an extensive park. The line passes
through a solely pastoral district. As the
traveller nears Ironbarks he will notice on
both sides of the line the ground turned over
in every direction, the place having the
appearance of being covered with an immense
number of large ant-hills. The reason of
this is that Ironbarks was once a flourishing
alluvial diggings, and in the early days of
gold-mining many rich finds were obtained
here. Mining is still carried on, but it is in
the shape of reefing, the quartz-reefs in the
vicinity being worked and giving payable
returns. The township is but a small one,
containing a couple of hotels, the Railway
Station being the centre for a limited pastoral
district.
Springs, 240 miles.— After leaving Iron
barks the traveller, if journeying at the
proper season of the year, gets passing views
of waving wheat-fields, agriculture being fol-
lowed to a considerable extent in the districts
bordering the line. To the north of the
Railway a bold range of hills, from which
some fine views are obtained, is seen running
almost parallel to the line. Goods are re-
ceived at Springs for a number of agricul-
turists on the Bell and Macquarie Rivers,
and for miners working in the Burrendong
and Tigmalarie districts. A copper-mine has
been opened up on Burrel Creek (3 miles),
which promises well, and splendid limestone
is obtained in the vicinity. The vine grows
luxuriantly here, and several good vineyards
have been established.
Wellington, 248 miles: 895 feet above
sea-level. —After leaving Springs the line
passes for a few miles through an uninterest-
ing country; at 246 miles a platform is passed,
and then the appearance of a number of
cultivated fields ushers the approach of the
traveller to an important western town—
Wellington. According to the Census of
1881, Wellington contains 1,563 people; it is
a municipality, possessing a number of sub-
stantially-constructed buildings ; the town,
lying on the banks of the Macquarie, is very
prettily situated, nestling at the foot of some
high, heavily-timbered hills, which slope
gently down to the plains through which the
river runs. The town possesses a number of
works, the principal being the Bell Brewery,
Kan car row’s steam saw-mills, wheelwright
and joinery establishment, &c., Aaron’s steam
flour-mill and general station factory, Fergu-
son’s flour-mill, Matthews’ flour-mill, and Dr.
Boehun’s vintage. In the district there are a
large number of farmers; wheat growing and
the cultivation of the vine and tobacco is also
folloAved. Wellington is the centre of an
important pastoral tract of country, and goods
are received for Apsley, Buckinbar, Cobbora,
Culgong, Gobolion, Mundooran, Montefiores,
Mitchell’s Creek, Obley, etc. In the


vicinity of Wellington there is much that
is interesting and beautiful to be seen.
There is first the celebrated Wellington
Caves, 6 miles out on the Ironbarks Road.
A writer in speaking of them says,—“The
Wellington Caves have always had a large
amount of interest attached to them, not
only on account of their natural beauty and
peculiarity, but because of the strange remains
of a bygone time that every exploration of
their depths brings to light. Remains of
men have been found there, and strange tools
and weapons ; grotesque drawings, indicating
a poetic conception and stirring times, tell of
a people who have passed away as entirely as
has the time in which they lived. Save the
deeply graven lines on the face of the rock,
the strange and petrified forms of tools and
utensils for household use, the footprints of
ages ago firmly fixed in a clay that has long
since turned into rock, no record remains
of the people or the period when the Welling-
ton Caves were places of common resort,
either for purposes of security or comfort.”
A little distance from Wellington the waters
of the Bell and Macquarie unite, the place
receiving the poetic name of the “ Meeting
of the Waters.” Towering above the town
is a majestic hill called Mount Arthur, from
which a splendid view of the rivers is obtained,
as they wind like streaks of silver over the
plain. The scenery along the banks of the
river is in places very pretty, and the rivers
themselves furnish plenty of sport—the cod
and silver bream, delicious fish, being caught.
Wellington is also rich in minerals, and
should ere long become a more important
town. Copper is obtained here. A coal-field,
the Belmore, is situated 15 miles away; and
in the district are the gold-fields of Woola-
man, Goodrich, and Mitchell’s Creek. Ample
and good accommodation can be had here;
the principal hotels being the “ Royal,”
“Exchange,” “Occidental,” “Commercial,”
“ Bridge,” “ Railway,” and “ Telegraph.”
Railway refreshment-rooms have been estab-
lished at Wellington, and as the train passes
through at seasonable hours the refreshment-
rooms prove a great convenience to travellers.
Maryvale, 254 miles; 1,000 feet above
sea-level. —A little distance beyond Wel-
lington the Railway crosses the Macquarie, by
a handsome iron bridge, of 3 spans of 150
feet each and two of 60 feet each, with brick
abutments, &c. The total length of the
bridge is 648 feet. The height of the rails
above the level of the river is 70 feet. It
will be remembered that this is the second
time the Macquarie is crossed by the Rail-
way, and further west, at Dubbo, the line
again crosses the same stream. In the
vicinity of Wellington the land is largely
under cultivation, a considerable quantity of
wheat and oats for hay being grown. Mary-
vale is in the centre of wide-stretching
wheat-fields, and a large quantity of produce
is annually sent from this platform. At 267
miles there is another platform, Murrum-
bidgerie, from whence a large quantity of
timber—principally Railway sleepers, which
are obtained in the vicinity—is despatched.
Dubbo, 278 miles ; 865 feet above sea-
level.—The country between Maryvale and
Dubbo is uninteresting, and is used almost
entirely for pastoral purposes. The line
between Wellington and Dubbo generally is
level, although at one point there is for a
short distance a gradient of 1 in 40. The
sharpest curve is 40 chains radius. Dubbo
is an important trucking place for cattle,
and just before reaching the station the
train passes extensive trucking yards. The
town is situated on the edge of the salt-bush
or pastoral country, and is the centre of
one of the richest mineral and pastoral
districts of Hew South Wales. The popula-
tion of the town, according to the Census of
1881, was 3,324, and of the surrounding
district 12,000. Dubbo is, though one of
the most recent of the new townships which
have sprung up during the last twenty years,
one of the most flourishing. Its buildings
are handsome and substantial. Some splen-
did stores are to be seen. In public buildings
the most noticeable are the Church of England,
Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and Wesleyan
Churches. The first three are built of white
sandstone, taken from the quarries at West
Dubbo, 2 miles from the town. The supply
of this stone is unlimited. The Govern-
ment buildings—viz., the Court-house and
Post Office—are soon to be replaced by struc-
tures more in accordance with the present
wants of the place. The Railway Station is


an imposing building, erected in 1880. It is
constructed of stone. There is a nice Station-
house attached, around which a well
arranged garden has been planted, in which
the choicest plants and flowers are bloom-
ing in all seasons. The Masonic Hall—
a roomy building—is also one of the most
prominent edifices. It possesses a fine hall,
a roomy stage, and besides there is one
of the best lodge-rooms in the Colony.
There are three Banks—Commercial, Joint
Stock, and New South Wales. Dubbo is
the circuit town for the whole north-west,
as far on one side as the Queensland boun-
dary, north and south-west. There is a firm
wooden bridge spanning the Macquarie at
Dubbo ; it is 300 feet long. About half-a-
mile higher up the river, the Railway bridge
(a very fine bridge) is in course of construc-
tion. The educational requirements of the
town are well attended to. Besides private
and denominational schools, there is a large
public school with an average attendance of
about 400 pupils. The leading hotels are
the “Royal,” “Macquarie View,” “Great
Western,” “Post Office,” and “Imperial.”
The district in years past was principally a
pastoral district, but within the last fifteen
years a considerable quantity of land has
been taken up for farming purposes. How-
ever, the soil seems best for the pursuits of
grazing and farming combined. The climate
and soil are admirably adapted for the growth
of the vine, and at two vineyards—Eumalgo,
7 miles away, and Mount Olivet, 2 miles
distant—some excellent wines are made.
The Dubbo district is rich in minerals. 20
miles, on the Tollragar or Erskine, is the
Baltimore Coal-mine. A very rich seam of
excellent coal is being worked. About 25
miles from the Railway siding at Tranjie, on
the extension to Nevertire, is the Caroline
Copper-mine ; and at Girilambone, 25 miles
from Nyngan, is the Girilambone Mine.
35 miles from Dubbo are the auriferous
quartz-reefs of Tomingley. About a dozen
claims are on gold, and the Mint returns
are very promising. There are on the
West Bogan, west of Tranjie and Never-
tire, some as yet undeveloped copper-mines.
The wool traffic is large—about 40,000
bales being loaded at Dubbo. The whole
of the Castlereagh traffic comes to Dubbo,
and the Railway returns show that there has
been a great revenue collected at this station.
The towns which will make Dubbo their
station are as follow: —Cobbora, Obley,
Coonamble, Collie, Gilgandra, Garalgambone,
Mundooran, &c. Warren will be served by
Nevertire, and on the line is Narr amine,
which will be used by the middle Macquarie
residents. Tranjie will serve the Upper
Bogan inhabitants.
Nyngan, 377 miles.— ln October, 1882,
an extension from Dubbo to Nevertire, 63
miles, was opened, and on the 9th June, 1883,
the line was completed to Nyngan. After
leaving Dubbo the line runs over the Mac-
quarie, which is crossed by a substantial iron
bridge. Between this and Nyngan no en-
gineering difficulties have been met with, but
numerous cuttings are passed through ; from
the largest of which, near 283 miles, 27,292
loads of stuff were taken. A number of
creeks are crossed, timber openings allowing
their waters to run under the line. The
steepest gradient on the extension is 1 in 50,
but this only occurs for a distance of 30
chains. Generally the line is comparatively
level ; the country for some 10 miles out of
Dubbo is fertile, but then poor land covered
with stunted pine and ironbark is passed
through. At Narramine, 300 miles from
Sydney (22 from Dubbo), the great western
salt-bush plains are entered upon. The plains
extend for miles, in many places devoid of
trees, or covered with small scrub, varied by
occasional patches of myall. A platform is
passed at Trangie, 320 miles, and at 341
miles Nevertire is reached. There is no town-
ship at Nevertire, the nearest place being
Warren—ll miles off—a pastoral centre with
a population of 429 soiils. The line between
Nevertire and Nyngan is of a light charac-
ter, being straight and almost level. The
Western District is very rich in copper;
some mines—the Great Cobar especially —
showing ore in sight that will furnish
employment to thousands of miners for years
to come. This mine has led to the founda-
tion of the town of Cobar, which contains
some three or four thousand inhabitants.
To provide for the trade of the district a
railway has been approved of from Nyngan,
and no doubt before long it will be com


menced, as the working plans, &c., have been
prepared, and only await the final approval
of the Legislature.
Giralambone, 405 miles; 637 feet
above sea-level. —When the extension was
opened to Byrock, in September, 1884, a
wayside station was opened at Giralambone,
around which some settlement had been
gathered by the development of some copper
mines ; but at the present time the mines are
not being worked. The station is now kept
up by the produce from the sheep stations
known as Murrawombri, Gradweed, Boora-
mugga, Budgery, Sussex, and Wilga Downs,
and the goods to these runs. The district is
an uninteresting one being very sparsely
settled, level, and used exclusively for pastoral
purposes.
Byrock, 455 miles; 499 feet above
sea-level. —Byrock is a town of mushroom
growth called into existence by the opening
of the railway to it in September, 1884, and
judging by appearances does not seem destined
to have a long life as its buildings have been
designed apparently for merely temporary
purposes. At present a fairly large number
of cattle are trucked from here, coming via
Brewarrina, and the station receives the Bre-
warrina goods; but an agitation has been set
on foot to have a branch railway to this town
from Byrock.
Bourke, 503 miles; 349 feet above
sea-level. —The Great Western Railway is
an immense chain uniting Sydney and Bourke,
and being in length 503 miles. Its links
have taken many years to form, but the final
one was completed in September, 1885, and
the line was opened on the 3rd of that month
to Bourke, the most important town in Cen-
tral Australia. It lies on the River Darling,
but it is only at uncertain periods that the
river is navigable, and in times of drought the
town has almost been reduced to famine,
stores being so scarce and transit so difficult;
but the railway puts an end to all such con-
tingencies, and the Bourke people are now
brought within a day’s journey of the me-
tropolis. The town is not particularly pic-
turesque, lying on a long flat stretching back
from the river, but it is the centre of an
immense district, and transacts a large busi-
ness, and is every year rising into more
importance. It is a municipality, proclaimed
in 1878, and contains a population of 4,140.
It offers excellent hotel accommodation. The
traffic from Bourke is entirely of a pastoral
nature, wool and cattle being sent away in
immense quantities, as Bourke is the entrepot
for a pastoral district that stretches through
the heart of Australia away to the far north
of Queensland ; and at times wool is brought
by river to this station. At the present time
Bourke is dependant for grains and green-
stuff's upon the more favoured stations on the
Western Line, such as Wellington or Orange,
where wheat can be grown to advantage; but
if a system of irrigation and water conservation
can be perfected, as it is believed it can,
it will add immeasurably to the wealth and
productiveness of these western districts.
IV.—EXTENSION WALLERAWANG TO MUDGEE.
The history of the Railway Extension to
Mudgee shows a splendid proof of the success
of persistency. For many years this exten-
sion was fought for determinedly by the
Mudgee people; but various Governments,
deterred by the heavy estimates given
as to the cost of the line, and the dim
prospect of a remunerative return, would not
for a long time listen to the appeals of those
interested, until at last one Ministry, seeing
beyond the mountain barrier a wealthy land
of promise and the opening up and develop-
ment of mineral resources and wide areas of
land, determined to propose the line, a pro-
position which met with the approval of the
then Parliament. Accordingly the line was
proceeded with, and in September, 1884, the
Mudgee people heard the whistle of the iron
horse as it gaily made its way across the
plains bordering the quiet Cudgegong. The
line starts from Wallerawang, which long
enjoyed a greater share of prosperity by


reason of its position as the junction of the
Mudgee road with the Western Railway.
Piper’s Flat, 110 miles; 3,187 feet
above sea-level. —The line runs north-west
from Wallerawang outwards to Piper’s Flat,
the first station ; tlie country is uninteresting,
the land being poor and timbered with stunted
specimens of white gum. The station is kept
busy only by the mineral traffic, the Wallera-
wang Company’s Coal-mine being in the
vicinity, which, in 1884, had a contract to
supply the Government with some 75,000
tons coal at the remarkably low rate of ss.
per ton. The district is essentially a mining
one, near the station coal is in abundance,
and spread over the locality are extensive
deposits of lime, which is principally shipped
from the next platform, Ben Bullen, at 121
miles.
Capertee, 127 miles; 2,739 feet above
sea-level. —The line fz-om Ben Bullen to
Capertee is uninteresting until within a short
distance of Capertee, when, after emerging
from the darkness of the Capertee tunnel,
the traveller sees spread before him a gloi’ious
panoramic view of Capertee Valley. The
railway skirts round its edges, and down
below him extends the valley, its uneven and
thickly timbered surface heaving, it would
appeal-, like mighty waves. Far back stands
a frowning battlement of dark bold rocks
forming a head and crown to the body of
the valley below, these cliffs wonderfully
square and regular being aptly termed the
Crown Ridge. The train in the fall of
the year clears this spot towards sunset,
and the long golden sunbeams of the evening
as they gleam across the waving tree-tops
in the valley, light up this crown with a
golden refulgence of light smoothing down
its forbidding sternness and setting gems
over its rocky face. The railway runs round
this valley for some distance on its way to
Rylstone, and between the steep cuttings
a fair vista of this picturesque valley is every
now and again seen. The valley contains
good timber ; but of course the difficulty of
transit militates against any use being made
of the forests. Good sporting is to be had
in among the tall grey-gums, game being
plentiful in the valley, and the kangaz-oos are
as thick as sheep on a good run. Capertee
cannot be called a thriving place; it boasts
of one inn and occasionally sends a little
traffic over towards the Turon (14 miles),
where some gold seekers are working.
Ilford, 149 miles; 2,450 feet above
sea-level. —Between Ilford and Capertee
the line runs for some distance as already
mentioned along the head of the Capertee
Valley, the line crawling as it were along the
side of the cliffs that drop down into the
valley. The cuttings are both numerous and
extensive, and at times an uneasy feeling
creeps over the traveller, that one of the
overhanging rocks above him will fall across
the ironway. The nature of the country at
this place is that known as “rotten,” and in
order to make traffic secure, and to prevent
the probability of danger, the trains always
run through in the daylight. The scenery is
bold and striking, the mountains towering-
hundreds of feet overhead and the passing
views are sufficiently varied to show a long
succession of panoramic views as the trains
sped onwards.
Rylstone, 158 miles ; 1,993 feet above
sea-level. —From Ilford the line becomes
more even and the country better grassed,
the line running into the large squattages
bordering the Cudgegong River. Rylstone is
a clean and thriving little township, the
Cudgegong running round it, and its fertile
flats giving opportunity for the cultivation of
good crops of grain. Near Rylstone is the
head of the “ Colo” Valley, through which a
route is being surveyed for a Railway to
connect with the Western Line near Penrith,
The line can, it is thought, be made success-
fully and without any very sharp curves or
steep gradient, consequently the already ovez’-
burdened mountain line can be relieved, and
the far western traffic be greatly expedited.
Rylstone boasts of three churches, and an
equal number of hotels, and a few thriving
stores, &c. In its vicinity a little mining is
carried on ; but it is dependent for its
prosperity on the pastoral and agricultural
interests. In the wool season a large
number of bales of wool are sent away;
while it is not uncommon to find 4,000 sheep
trucked here in one day for the Sydney


market. Rylstone is elevated, and is ex-
tremely healthy, while in its neighbourhood
are many charming views of river, valley,
and of mountains.
Mudgee, 190 miles ; 1,635 feet above
sea-level. —Mudgee, the terminus of the
line, is perhaps one of the best known towns
in the Colony, although, until recently, diffi-
cult to reach. It is at once a centre of two
great enterprises —gold-mining and wool-
growing—for within comparatively a short
distance lie the well-known gold-fields of
Gulgong, Meroo, Hill End, Tambaroora,
Home Rule, Windeyer, &c., and on the other
hand, its wool has before now gained the
diploma of honor—the highest award in the
world’s exposition. The country between
Rylstone and Mudgee is mostly river flats
bordering the Cudgegong, and although well
adapted for cereals is used principally for
pastoral purposes, the line running through
or near the great estates of the Cox’s,
Crossings, Lawsons, &c., whose valuable flocks
are often passed. The line runs through this
river valley, being bordered on either side by
gentle sloping hills, the valley widening out
as it were to make room for the establishment
of the thriving town of Mudgee. Mudgee
is a municipality with a population of 3,000
and ratable property valued at £350,000.
It has 14£ miles of streets, and many hand-
some buildings, both public and private,
ecclesiastic and scholastic. The district has
a population of 12,000, and in the immediate
vicinity of Mudgee farming and vine-growing
are followed with success, 21,250 acres being
under cultivation. In the town a number of
fairly prosperous industries are established,
such as flour mills, coach factories, tanneries,
soap works, &c., which give employment to
many persons. The town boasts of two
newspapers, and the district is represented in
Parliament by three Members. Ample
hotel accommodation is available at Mudgee,
V.—GRANVILLE TO ALBURY.
(THE SOUTHERN LINE.)
Note. —The first 13 miles on the Railway
out of Sydney, to be traversed by the tourist
intending to travel on the Southern line, are
necessarily upon the Main Trunk line, used
for suburban travelling, and including the fol-
lowing stations and stopping-places: Sydney,
Eveleigh, McDonaldtown, Newtown, Stanmore,
Petersham, Summer Hill, Ashfield, Croydon,
Burwood, liedmyre , Homebush, Rookwood,
Auburn, and Granville. These stopping-
places and stations will be found already
described in the “Itinerary,” under the head-
ing of “Sydney to Granville” —Western Main
Trunk Line. The Itinerary for the Southern
line proper must therefore commence from
Granville, where the Southern Railway sepa-
rates from the Main line—continued on (past
Parramatta) to the westward.
Granville Station, 13 miles ; 32 feet
above sea-level. —The Railroad, after
leaving Granville, runs nearly due south for
some miles, and then takes a turn to the
westward. Several handsome residences are
F
passed, and as a large portion of the land
between Granville and Fairfield lias been
recently sold, before long no doubt many new
residences will be erected.
Merrylands Platform, 14 miles ; about
70 feet above sea-level. —A platform, 1
mile south of Granville, and 2 miles distant
from the Guildford Platform.
Guildford Platform, 16 miles ; 88 feet
above sea-level. —Guildford is at present a
rather sparsely populated locality, in the
neighbourhood of the southern end of the
Old Dog-trap Road, here connecting Parra-
matta with the Old Southern Road.
Fairfield Station, 18 miles ; 30 feet
above sea-level. —Fairfield is a pretty
sylvan, low-lying place, with a small popula-
tion of farmers and fruit growers. Nearly
opposite the station is a park-like place called
Orchardleigh which is much resorted to by
picnicers. In the vicinity of the station


the soil is well adapted for fruit-growing, and
some thriving vineyards and orangeries are
here to be found. A large quantity of firewood
is sent from this station to the metropolis.
A large reservoir in connection with the met-
ropolitan water supply is to be made at Pros-
pect, about 3 miles from this station, which
will cover an area of over 2 square miles.
Canley Vale Platform, 19 miles ; 40
feet above sea-level. —This is merely a
platform, from which there is not at present
much traffic, 1 mile to the south of Fairfield.
Cabramatta Platform, 20 miles; 52
feet above sea-level. —Cabramatta Plat-
form, on a creek of that name, is a rural
place, 2 miles north-east of Liverpool. In
the vicinity several country residences are
situated. There is a village of this name
about 10 miles to the westward, with which
this place must not be confounded.
Liverpool Station, 22 miles ; 50 feet
above sea-level. —Liverpool, one of the
oldest towns in the Colony, is 10 miles from
Parramatta and 12 miles from Campbelltown,
by rail. Population—l,76B. Four churches
—belonging to the four principal Denomina-
tions, one Public School, and two Denomina-
tional Schools, and one College for Theolo-
gical Students—“ Moore’s College”—at a short
distance from the town (Church of England).
There is a large Benevolent Asylum for the
Aged and Infirm, accommodating between
800 or 900 inmates; a Town Hall and
Post Office; also, a number of industrial
establishments, amongst which are several
complete wool-washing establishments and
two large paper-mills. Liverpool stands at
the head of the navigation of George’s Biver.
It was formed into a municipality in 1872.
Denham Court, Glenfield, and other settle-
ments are in the immediate neighbourhood.
Those who have means and leisure may
here make a pleasant boat excursion down
George’s River to Sans Souci, and thence
go by road and rail to Sydney. The
river scenery is picturesque, and many
beautiful views are to be had on some of the
wide reaches of the river. The principal
hotels are the “Horse and Jockey,” the
“Golden Fleece,” “Tattersall’s,”the “Royal,”
“ Foresters’ Arms,” “ Commercial,” and
“ Woolpack.”
Owing to the extensive works at Liver-
pool a large amount of traffic is done at
this station, the goods inwards being equal to
1,400 tons per month ; goods outward (prin-
cipally paper, firewood, and bricks), 2,250
tons per month ; wool received for washing,
2,000 bales per month.
Liverpool Paper-mills. —The property
consists of 13 acres, with frontage to that
extent to George’s River. Buildings cover
an area of acres, built of stone and brick;
machinery, four 50-horse power steam-boilers ;
five steam-engines from 10 to 50-horse power ;
twelve rag engines ; six rag and fibre boilers ;
one very large high-pressure fibre boiler; bleach
house, capacity for 30 tons weekly; paper-
making machine, 84 inches wide, speed 100
to 123 feet per minute; patent cutting and
repping and winding machinery ; four sets of
calender rolls; one set chilled American rolls;
two water-filtering pounds (the largest in the
Australian Colonies); pumping engine,
capable of drawing 100,000 gallons per hour.
Manufacture—22 to 25 tons weekly news
printing, in sheets and in reels 3 to 4 miles in
length, for the continuous web news-printing
machine; engine-sized writing papers ; royal
hand and brown wrapping-papers. Humber
of hands employed in the works, 115 people,
with agents all over the Colonies.
Established in 1869 by the Australian
Paper-making Company. Eight years in the
present proprietors’ hands, who have greatly
improved the property and machinery.
The Company yields a revenue to the
Government Railways exceeding £2,500
annually ; and the works are connected by a
branch line of rails which runs into the works.
Material used —Cotton rags and canvas,
with 50 to 65 per cent, fibre, indigenous to
the Colony; an important feature in the
manufacturing of news printing, when it is
computed that not less than 200 tons is
required weekly in the Southern Hemisphere.
Material used for brown and grey wrap-
pings—Rope, old woolpacks, bagging, and
waste paper, of which there is an ample
supply, and a full demand for the manufac-
tured paper.


menangle Bridge.


Coal, 90 to 120 tons weekly required,
which is obtained from Eskbank Colliery, on
the Western line, of easy access to the works,
the quality of which will compare favourably
with some of the English coal.
The Collingwood Wool-scouring and
Fellmongering Establishment is situated
on George’s River in close proximity to the
town of Liverpool; the works cover an area
of several acres, and are very complete, the
machinery employed being very extensive
and capable of scouring, packing, and sending
away about 250 bales of wool weekly. The
fellmongering establishment is also admirably
adapted for the work, consisting of large
soak-pits, sweating-sheds, and pulling-houses.
About 4,000 skins are fellmongered weekly;
the best of the pelts are sent to be tanned
into basils, and the remainder are made into
glue at a manufactory on another portion of
the premises. A branch of the Southern
Railway runs into the premises, and wool is
received and loaded into the railway trucks
at the wool stores. The works give employ-
ment to about seventy hands.
Messrs. Haigh & Son have also, on the
opposite side of the river, and in close proxi-
mity to the town, an extensive fellmongering
establishment, fitted with very complete
appliances for the work,
Glenfield Platform, 25 miles; 38 feet
above sea-level. —After leaving Liverpool
the train rapidly passes the works of the
Paper Company and the Collingwood Fell-
mongery, and for some distance runs parallel
to the George’s River. 3 miles from Liver-
pool Glenfield is reached; it takes its name
from the large and beautiful estate of Glen-
field. There is a populous and picturesque
neighbourhood here, bounded on the south by
the George’s River.
Ingleburn, 28 miles ; 74 feet above sea-
level.—At the Macquarie Fields there is fine
open country, dotted over with trees. There
are hills and slopes on either side of the line.
The country here much resembles that near
Rooty Hill on the Western line.
Minto Platform, 31 miles; 140 feet
above sea-level. —Minto is a very pretty
sylvan locality, 3 miles out of Campbelltown,
on the Sydney side. In the vicinity are a
number of farmers, who find the platform
very convenient for forwarding their produce.
Campbelltown Station, 34 miles; 210
feet above sea-level. —Campbelltown, a
very old township, is named after a gentleman
who was Colonial Secretary of New South
Wales in the days of Governor Macquarie.
It is the centre of an agricultural district,
and contains about 700 souls. In the town
are three churches —one for the Anglican
(St. Peter’s), and the other two for the Roman
Catholics and Congregationalists. There are
also several inns, and one Public School.
The surrounding country, consisting of hills,
valleys, and plains, is devoted to grazing and
cultivation, and is eminently healthy and
picturesque. In the neighbourhood (10 miles
to the south of it) lies the pleasant little
village of Appin, with much fine scenery not
far from it—at Broughton’s Pass, Jordan’s
Pass, Pheasant’s Nest, the Friendly Falls,
and Bulli Pass. The Pheasant’s Nest Pass,
which is at the junction of the Nepean and
Bordeaux Rivers, forms the starting-point of
the extensive works for the supply of the
Metropolitan district with water. A tunnel
nearly 5 miles long will connect the waters
of the Nepean and Cataract, and the united
streams will feed a tunnel about 2 miles in
length, and by a series of aqueducts the
water will be brought to a storage reservoir
at Prospect, near Fairfield, which, when
completed, will have an area of about 2
square miles, and contain over, 11,000 million
gallons of water. Parliament has authorized
the necessary expenditure for the carrying
out of this great project, and the work is now
under construction. From Campbelltown a
Tramway has been constructed to Camden,
passing through Narellan. From Campbell-
town tourists start southwards for the Illa-
warra District. (See Routes.)
Menangle Station, 40 miles ; 270 feet
above sea-level. —At Menangle the Southern
line crosses the Nepean by means of a fine
tubular bridge, the vails being 63 feet above
the ordinary level of the river. This
bridge and the adjacent viaduct consists “ of
wrought iron, continuous box girders for a


double line, 498 feet in length, extending
over three openings of 150 feet clear span
each, resting on stone piers, the masonry
being set in Portland cement. The height
of the bridge from the level of the river to
under side of the girders is 65 feet. The
approach on the Sydney or northern side is
978 feet long, in spans of 26 feet each. The
approach on the southern side is of timber,
432 feet in length, in spans of 26 feet.” In
the vicinity are numerous fine grazing farms,
with agricultural patches laid out on the
alluvial flats. Menangle has an Anglican and
a Roman Catholic Church, and two schools.
21 miles from Menangle is the Camden Park
Estate, the residence of the late Sir William
Macarthur. The house is surrounded with
extensive grounds, containing a series of hot-
houses, stocked with the rarest plants. The
open gardens are also well laid out, and are
not to be surpassed in the Colony. Close by
the station is a small nursery. Some pleasant
views are to be obtained near Menangle,
along the banks of the Nepean. There is a
grand and comprehensive view of the country
from the line on the Campbelltown side of
Menangle—about a couple of miles from the
bridge, with Razorback in the distance.
Douglass Park Station, 45 miles ; 396
feet above sea-level.— Douglass Park is an
agricultural settlement, named after the late
Hon. H. G. Douglass, M.D. In the vicinity
is Nepean Towers, at one time the residence
of the late Dr. R. L. Jenkins, who was cele-
brated for his noted herds of pure-bred cattle,
which have on many occasions won the prin-
cipal prizes at our agricultural shows. A. good
deal of traffic has lately come to Douglass
Park, on account of its proximity to the works
in connection with the Sydney water supply.
There is at present no township at Douglass
Park, but it is understood a township has been
laid out. There are many charming views in
the vicinity of Douglass Park.
Picton Station, 53 miles; 549 feet
above sea-level. —Picton (formerly called
“ Stonequarry”) is a prettily situated town,
at a distance of 13 miles from Menangle. It
lies in a valley, through which flows the
Stonequarry Creek, and consist of Upper
and Lower Picton. The buildings are sub-
stantial in character, and good accommodation
is provided for travellers. There are churches
for the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and
Wesleyan denominations ; a Court house, and
Public School. Amongst other institutions,
the most worthy of notice is the “ Home for
Consumptives,” provided and maintained at
considerable expense, by the kind liberality
of Lieutenant and Mrs. Goodlet. The land
in the neighbourhood of Picton is extensively
used for pastoral and agricultural purposes.
The geological formation is chiefly sandstone
and Wianamatta shale. The scenery is
pretty and interesting. The hills rise on all
sides of the town in gentle undulations, with
rounded tops and grassy slopes, enclosing
many smiling valleys amongst them, which
either under crop or covered with herbage
impart a pleasant and peaceful aspect to the
surrounding country. From the summit of
some of the higher hills many beautiful views
can be obtained, in which the Picton Yalley,
with its winding stream, cheerful homesteads,
and pretty orchards, forms the foreground,
and a succession of hills flanked by far-away
mountain chains the background. One of
the highest of the hills in the immediate
vicinity of Picton is “ Vault Hill,” situated
to the right of Lower Picton, proceeding from
the Railway Station. This receives its name
from the fact that its brow is occupied as a
burial-ground by the family of Major Antill.
The Railway Viaduct at Picton is a work of
considerable importance, built of masonry,
set in cement, and consisting of five openings
of 40 feet each. The length is 276 feet, and
the height from foundation to rail level, 78
feet. The tunnel to the south of the town—
through the Redbank Range —is 198 yards
in length. The Stonequarry Creek contains
scenery both varied and interesting—particu-
larly downward from the town to its junction
with the Hawkesbury River. It seldom
ceases to run even in the driest seasons, but
when low, its waters, though clear, are
slightly brackish. In its course downwards
to the Hawkesbury it flows through a narrow
ravine or glen, and its bed is bestrewn with
boulders and huge fragments of rock that
have fallen ages ago from the sides of the
glen. Here and there however the stream
bed widens, forming reaches and pools, often


fringed with reeds and covered with water-
lilies. Ferns are also plentiful in places —
one portion of the glen being in consequence
known as “Fern Valley.” Natural caves
are to be found in the rocks on either side of
the glen. One of these called the “ Salt
Cave” is somewhat remarkable, owing to the
fact that the rock of which it is composed is
largely impregnated with salt, and lumps of
the mineral in a pure state have been found
imbedded in the decomposed sandstone of
which its floor is formed. Other mineral
substances, such as kerosene shale and oxide
of iron, are to be found in the vicinity of this
creek. Perhaps the most pleasant trip that
can be taken from Picton is to Burragorang,
a series of valleys and uplands, amongst which
is some of the grandest and wildest scenery
that is to be found probably in the Colony.
Burragorang lies to the north-east.
Picton Lakes Platform, 59 miles; 1,074
feet above sea-level. —After leaving Picton
and passing through the Bedbank Tunnel,
the line during the next 7 miles rises much
more rapidly than it did previously, until at
a place known as “ Picton Lakes,” it reaches
a height of 525 feet above the level of the
station at Picton. Here there is a platform,
with a watering place for the engines. The
water is pumped up from several large lagoons
situated to the west of the line, in a singular
precipitous valley about half a mile distant.
These lagoons or lakes, when in flood, form
one long body of water extending for a distance
of about 5 miles, in an oval-shaped valley,
and enclosing a wooded hill in the centre,
and have an average width of about half a
mile. During low-water the higher portion
of the valley becomes dry, or forms a reedy
swamp, while the lower portion forms a chain
of lagoons partially subdivided by the immense
rushes which fringe them on all sides, and
extend across the shallower parts of the
water. Even in the driest seasons these
lagoons contain a considerable body of fresh
clear water, having a length of from 2 to 21,-
miles, with a depth of from 10 to 30 feet. A
peculiar feature in connection with this sheet
of water is the fact that it has no perceptible
feeders, and even in flood-time is not supplied
with any stream of importance.
Mittagong Station, 77 miles; 2,069
feet above sea-level. —Mittagong—also
called Nattai—lies in an elevated region,
being over 2,000 feet above the level of the
sea. Around it is a pastoral and agricultural
district. Its mineral resources are coal and
iron; the Fitzroy Iron Mines being imme-
diately adjacent to the town. The iron ore is of
the finest quality, and apparently of unlimited
extent. Some years ago a large amount of
capital was expended by the Fitzroy Iron
Company in erecting the necessary plant and
appliances for smelting the ore, but owing to
the high rate of labour, and other expenses
connected with the carrying on of the works,
operations have been suspended for some
considerable time past. This suspension
cannot, however, prove otherwise than tem-
porary, as one of the difficulties (that of finding
coal of suitable quality and within easy
distance) has been overcome by the opening
of a fine seam of coal, a few miles from
the town, within the last twelve months.
Without doubt Mittagong will eventually
become the scene of an important industry.
The scenery in the neigbourhood is of a
varied and interesting character. Fine views
of the surrounding country can be obtained
from many of the mountains in its vicinity.
A favourite one with visitors as well as
the townspeople is that from a cliff known
as the “Gib.” This is a peculiarly shaped
rocky cliff situated about 2 miles on the
southern side of the town, and derives its
name (of which Gib is an abbreviation) from a
fancied resemblance to the rock at Gibraltar,
The road to this cliff leads over several grassy
slopes, most appropriately named the “Green
Hills,” and forms a pleasant and by no means
fatiguing walk. From the top of the cnff an
extensive view of the town of Mittagong and
its surroundings is obtained —one of the most
conspicuous objects in which is Mount Jellore,
the culminating point of the Mittagong Range.
In all directions round Mittagong romantic
glens and ravines are situated, in which ferns
and other cryptogams grow in great variety
and luxuriance. The ferns in particular are
most numerously represented, as many as
thirty varieties having been collected in the
neighboux-hood. Most conspicuous amongst
them are the species Lomaria jjrocera, Pteris
comans, Doodia as'pera , Todea Fraseri, As


plenium palcatum, and Adiantum assimile ,
while Lindsaya microphylla , Aspleniura
fiabellifolium, and other rarer species are
obtainable. In addition to the cryptogamous
plants the flora is of an interesting character,
nearly every species peculiar to the mountain
system being here represented. The waratah
grows profusely, also the Clematis aristata,
and many other beautiful climbing plants.
In some of the glens a Christmas bush grows,
which has oblong leaves and whitish blossoms
tinted with the palest mauve. The smaller
wild flowers are well represented by orchids,
epacrids, plants of a papilionaceous character,
and others not specially classified, though
bearing in some instances local names of an
appropriate nature. In the geological for-
mation a good deal of variety also exists;
the coal measures are widely distributed, the
Devonian beds with their extensive deposits
of iron ore are well represented, and basaltic
trap is plentiful. Several fine freestone
quarries have been opened up, and chalybeate
springs are common. One of these, situated
a short distance from the town, flows into a
small well, bricked round, for the convenience
of invalids who may wish to drink the water.
Two miles on the southern side of the station
at Mittagong the train passes through the
Gibraltar Tunnel, believed to be the longest
in the Colony, being over 572 yards from end
to end. The tunnel is cut through sandstone
and shale, and is lined throughout with brick-
work and cement. The trains passing through
Mittagong stop twenty minutes to allow
passengers time for refreshments.
The Joadja Kerosene Mine. —To any
one interested in the industrial progress of the
Colony and the development of its natural
resources, a visit to the Joadja Kerosene
Mine would prove highly interesting. The
works are about 16 miles from the Mittagong
Railway Station, and can be reached by
means of a light tramway which the Company
has constructed. This tramway commences
from the mine, and is worked by a locomotive,
16 miles.
The mine is situated in a most picturesque
valley, through which runs a stream known
as the Joadja Creek. The valley is almost
surrounded by high mountains, and acces-
sible only by foot passengers, by means
of a path down a very steep descent, along
which for the purpose of hauling up the
shale a tramway has been constructed. The
trucks are lowered by a steel wire rope,
controlled and worked by a fixed engine at
the head of the incline. The distance from
the engine-house to the foot of the mountain
is over 3,000 feet, —the incline for 1,500 feet
being 1 in 2, and the remainder of the way
varying from that to 1 in 20.
The entrance to the mine is prettily situa-
ted on the brow of one of the hills, at an
elevation of about 500 feet from the bottom
of the gully. The distance into the main
drive of the mine is 680 feet; the other
tunnels, which branch off right and left, vary
from 150 to 200 feet in length. These
drives and tunnels are well ventilated by the
air being drawn through the mine, and regu-
lated by a large furnace and air chimney.
The valley is rendered most interesting
not only through its natural beauty, but also
by the substantial retorts, purifiers, and other
buildings erected by the Company. There
are about 150 persons employed on the works.
The Manager is provided with an excellent
house, and the miners, mechanics, and others,
with very comfortable cottages. There are
besides these buildings a store belonging to
the Company, a post-office, two butcheries,
two bakeries, and a schoolhouse is now being
erected, making a total of seventy-five houses
and huts on the estate, Near the mouth of
the mine very good coal is being worked for
local purposes. Altogether the village bears
a busy and cheerful aspect.
The operations consist of shale-mining,
extracting oil from the shale and refining it,
timber-sawing, erecting buildings, and all the
mechanical operations necessary to carry on
the works. Some fifty men are engaged in
winning 350 tons of shale or mineral per
week, which is either exported or treated for
oil extraction. The lower division of the
seam is 10 to 14 inches thick, and that of
the upper one 7 to 10 inches thick. The shale
obtained from the lower division, being the
most valuable, is exported, and contains about
three-fifths of the whole.
When the oil is extracted at the works
the shale is put into the retorts and dis-
tilled at an extremely low temperature. The
oil being carried down by gravitation to the


purifying works, is received into a tank, and
with an addition of sulphuric acid for the
purpose of purifying it by chemical action,
brings off a black viscid tar, composed of the
basic substances of the oil. The liquid then
passes into another tank, where it is treated
with a solution of caustic soda and sent on
for a second and third distilling. After being
treated each time with the acid and soda
the kerosene is finally re-distilled, and then
put into store tanks, filled into 4-gallon
tins, and placed in cases ready for market.
One month is necessary to make good burning
oil, but during its manufacture other valu-
able substances are extracted and brought
to market, as is evidenced by the following
figures 100 tons of kerosene shale produce
10,000 gallons of crude oil, or 5,000 gallons of
good burning oil, 3 to 5 per cent, of gazoline at
670°, 1| to 2 per cent, of paraffine, 6 per cent,
of tar, and 10 to 15 per cent, of lubricating
oil. In extracting the oil from the shale
fourteen men are employed ; and two boys, by
means of American machinery, are enabled to
make 400 tins per diem for holding the oil.
The water used at the works is brought
from a distance of mile, and is very
'clear and good. The estate has an area of
1,887 acres. About sixty-six bullocks and
fifty-six horses are worked upon it.
There is more to be seen at Joadja than
at any similar mine in the Colony. The
processes of extracting and refining the oil
are particularly interesting, and to the lover
of grand scenery the locality has scarcely
a rival, A very large sum of money has
been already expended, and doubtless more
will be required before the Company can
hope to receive the rich reward which is
unquestionably before it, and which it
deserves for its spirited and unostentatious
enterprise. The expenditure of such a large
amount of capital, and the consequent loca-
tion of a numerous industrial population, will
have a most beneficial effect upon Mittagong
and the surrounding districts ; and it is to be
hoped that the people most interested will
rightly appreciate the great manufacturing
undertaking carried on in their vicinity.
There can be but little doubt but that as
soon as J oadja Creek becomes better known
it will have many visitors, who will be well
repaid for the visit.
Bowral Station, 80 miles ; 2,171 feet
above sea-level. —Bowral is a pretty little
town, situated about 3 miles from Mittagong
and 6 from Moss Yale. There are several
business places, and a number of well-built
private residences. The principal means of
support until lately was derived from traffic
with the Kangaloon farmers. Within the
last year or two, however, the character for
healthiness which Bowral can justly claim
has attracted numbers of city folk, who make
use of it as a place of residence during the
heat of summer. The scenery between Mitta-
gong and Bowral is of a most picturesque and
romantic nature ; but within the immediate
vicinity of Bowral the country becomes less
wild and broken ; and open meadows, grassy
slopes, and gentle undulations are seen, giving
a pleasant and homelike character to the
neighbourhood.
Burradoo Platform, 82 miles • 2,168
feet above sea-level. —This is a platform
for the convenience of persons residing 2
miles to the southward of Bowral. Burradoo
is a charming summer retreat, and a couple
of days can be spent there with much pleasure
and benefit.
Austermere Platform, 85 miles ; 2,180
feet above sea-level. —This is a small plat-
form, 3 miles from Burradoo and 1 mile
from Moss Yale Station. Here the Hon.
John Lackey has a fine estate, extending for
some miles along the Wingecarribee River.
Moss Vale Station, 86 miles; 2,205
feet above sea-level. —Moss Yale is a town
of rapidly increasing importance, commanding
the traffic of Berrima (on the Old Southern
Road), Sutton Forest, Burrowang, and the
Kangaroo Valley—towards the district of
Illawarra—occupied by prosperous settlers.
Moss Yale is, as its name denotes, situated
in a valley, though during the last few years
it has been spreading over the slopes of the
surrounding hills. It is the centre of an
extensive area of land, well suited for agri-
cultural and grazing purposes. It has
numbers of stores and hotels the latter of
which are always well filled during holiday-
time. The scenery about Moss Yale is pretty
and interesting. The country is undulating


and lightly timbered, and abounds in verdant
valleys, grassy slopes, and open forest land.
The Fitzroy Falls.—About 12 miles from
Moss Yale, towards the sea-coast, is situated
a magnificent cataract—or rather series of
Avatcrfalls, called the Fitzroy Falls. A Avell-
defined road leads from Moss Yale to the
falls, over which the mail-coach travels daily
on its way to places situated further eastward.
The country through which this road passes
is of a similar nature to that surrounding
Moss Yale, being gently undulating ; so that
the view of the deep sunken valley or glen
in which the falls are situated comes on the
spectator with startling suddenness. Doavii
this valley a tributary of the Shoalhaven
falls in a sheer descent of about 400 feet
before reaching the rocks below. It then
pours over a shelving ledge of rock in a foamy
torrent for a further distance of nearly 200
feet, making a total depth from the top of
the upper fall to the bed of the creek of
upwards of 600 feet. These are distinguished
as the Upper Falls, and the spot is one well
Avorth going many miles to see. After
reaching the bottom of the glen, the water
continues to course doAvnwards in a series of
rapids and cascades for a distance of about
a mile, when another fall upAvards of 200
feet in depth occurs. The scenery connected
Avith these falls is of the most picturesque
and wildly beautiful character that could Avell
be imagined. A platform has been erected
in connection with the bridge that spans the
stream immediately above the falls. From
this platform a grand vieAv of the Upper
Falls and the glen itself can be obtained.
Facing the spectator is a gorge upwards of
half a mile in width, nearly 1,000 feet in
depth, and stretching for miles in the direc-
tion of its length. As this glen trends east-
Avard it widens considerably, and traversing
its centre is a table-shaped mountain-—called
Mount Meryla—behind Avhich glimpses of
mountain chains are seen outlined against
the sky. The sides and bottom of the glen
are covered with the richest vegetation,
which with its glistening foliage adds greatly
to the beauty of the scene.- At the spectator’s
feet the Avater dashes downwards, breaking
first into thousands of drops, that flash in the
sunlight like a shoAver of diamonds, and
then changing into feathery spray so light
that quantities of it float for hundreds of
yards down the glen. A pathway has been
formed by which tourists can descend into the
glen just below the first falls, and thence by
a circuitous course downwards to the lower
falls. The descent throughout is rendered
most interesting by the extreme beauty of the
vegetation, amongst which messmate trees,
cedars, and fern trees, form a conspicuous
feature, with here and there a cabbage palm,
while hanging in graceful festoons are various
species of climbing plants. In the under-
growths are many beautiful species of ferns,
besides mosses, lichens, and rocklilies.
Amongst the ferns, polypodicums and various
species of lomarias are plentiful. The
descent to the lower falls can be made in less
than half-an-hour, but the ascent, without
including stoppages—which, owing to the
perpendicular nature of some portions of the
pathway, are imperative—occupies about an
hour. The spot however well repays the
visitor for the exertion of reaching it, and
should not be omitted from the list of places
worthy of notice by the tourist. Owing to
greater facilities being afforded lately for
reaching these falls, they are fast becoming
a popular resort for visitors in search of
beautiful scenery ; and no doubt in the course
of time a house of accommodation Avill be
pi’ovided, by means of which they will be
enabled to increase the length of their stay.
The Berrima Coal-mines. —At about
equal distances from Berrima and Moss Yale
an extensive seam of coal has been opened
and the new industry thus inaugu-
rated seems well calculated to materially
advance the interests of the district
generally. The coal-seam is situated
about 7 miles from Berrima, in a tract of
land in the form of a peninsula, lying
between the Wingecarribee River and its
tributary the Medway. The scenery in the
neighbourhood of the mine is wild and
picturesque, the bed of the river being in a
deep and tortuous glen, here and there strewn
with huge boulders, while the sides are lined
with tree ferns and oak trees. The descent
to the opening into the ravine is made down
a steep incline leading through a tunnel, and
onward through strong iron doors. On
emerging through these a fine view of the


FITZROY FALLS.


river can be obtained as it winds its tortuous
way amongst the rocks, forming numerous
rapids and cascades on its way. The car-
boniferous deposits in this district are of a
very extensive character. For many miles
the course of the coal-seam just opened out
can be traced quite exposed to view. To the
eastward of the mine it sinks below the
surface, but again rises to view about a
mile distant, near the bottom of a waterfall
upwards of 200 feet in depth. The works,
which were commenced about two years
since, are under the able management of
Mr. Atkinson. The property and plant
consist of 680 acres held under mineral
conditional purchase, and 276 acres of free-
hold ; an engine-house, a 30-horse power
hoisting engine, engineer’s residence, tanks,
&c., with 7 miles of railway, extending to
Austermere on the Southern line, and so
gauged that the trucks may run to their
proper destination without the necessity of
unloading the coals. One of the first orders
received by the Company was to supply up-
wards of 12,000 tons of coals for use on the
Government Railways. The coal-beds have
been estimated by Mr. Wilkinson—the Gover-
nment Geologist —to yield about 5,000 tons of
marketable coal to the acre, from a seam 5
feet in thickness, so that before this portion
of the seam is exhausted it will have produced
upwards of 5 millions of tons of coal. Other
branchesof industry cannot fail to be developed
in this district through the opening of this
mine, amongst which one of the most im-
portant vail doubtless be the setting in motion
of the Fitzroy Iron-works at Mittagong.
In addition to the Falls, &c., there are
many interesting drives around and about
Moss Yale. To Berrim a township, 5 miles—
Burrawang, an important farming centre, 10
miles, and Robertson, 18 miles. A short
distance beyond Robertson from Mount Look-
out, a glorious view is obtained; the whole of
the Illawarra district lies stretched in one
vast panorama before the visitor ; the ocean,
with passing ships, is seen, and bordering
the sea-coast the townships of the Illawarra
district.
Bundanoon, 95 miles ; 2,202 feet above
sea-level. —This village is the centre of
an agricultural settlement, having a rich
deep soil adapted for cultivation. The
settlers are also engaged as dairy far-
mers. There is a good supply of water and
plenty of timber hereabouts, several saw-
mills having been started in the vicinity. In
the neighbourhood there is some magnificent
scenery—thickly timbered ranges, and bold
perpendicular cliffs.
Cable’s Siding Platform, 102 miles ;
2,163 feet above sea-level. —Cable’s Siding
is a platform between Moss Vale and Maru-
lan; 7 miles south of Jordan’s Crossing, and
12 miles north of Marulan.
Marnlan Station, 114 miles; 2,105 feet
above sea-level. —Marulan (sometimes called
“ Mooroowoolen”) is the township of a
small pastoral and agricultural settlement,
on a creek of the same name, 20 miles east
of Goulburn. Marulan is best known on
account of the quantities of marble, lime,
and slate that are obtained here, but the
visitor may well spend some little time in
viewing the wild and magnificent scenery
that is to be seen in the Shoalhaven Gullies.
Within 2 miles from the station Barber’s
Creek falls into the head of the gully; the
water rushing over is at times considerable,
and as the unbroken fall is very great the
sight is well worth seeing. The district is of
granite formation, the soil being poor,
although in parts patches of good ground are
met with. The agricultural districts of
Bungonia, Longreach, and Greenwich Park
forward their produce to this station. Marulan
is but a small township, containing two hotels
(“ Royal” and “ Terminus”), a few general
stores and shops, a tannery, and a couple of
churches. The sportsman can here find
plenty to engage attention. Wallabies and
kangaroos are numerous in the district, and
on the Wollondilly ducks of various kinds,
plover, quail, snipe, &c., are often to be
obtained.
Garrick Platform, 122 miles; 2,036
feet above sea-level. —Carrick is a small
settlement 8 miles west of Marulan and 12
miles east of Goulburn. The platform is
for the convenience of the inhabitants, who
are not very numerous.


Towrang Platform, 124 miles ; 2,049
feet above sea-level.— A small place on the
Southern Railway, 2 miles west of Garrick
and 10 miles east of Goulburn. It is some-
times called Manna Fields.
Goulburn, 134 miles ; 2,071 feet above
sea-level. —Goulburn, a city of some import-
ance, is the thriving capital of a large and
influential district. It is situated near the
junction of the Mulwarrie Ponds with
the Wollondilly River, and occupies a
site on the edge of an extensive upland
plain. The climate, owing to elevation,
is temperate, and generally speaking very
healthy. It is the seat of an Anglican
and Roman Catholic Bishopric. The Rail-
way Station is a very handsome and com-
modious building; and, with the exeception
of the one lately erected at Albury, is the
best on the Southern line of Railway. The
city of Goulburn is well laid out in rect-
angular blocks with broad thoroughfares.
The buildings are substantial in character,
some of them being handsome and spacious
structures which would bear favourable com-
parison with buildings of similar character
in the metropolis. The most important of
the buildings for public purposes are the
various churches, amongst which the new
Church of England stands prominent, the
Hospital, the Convent of the Sisters of
Mercy, the Mechanics’ Institute, St. Patrick’s
College, the Gaol, and Court-house. Goul-
burn was declared a municipality in 1859,
and a city in 1865, The present value of
ratable property is upwards of 45300,000,
and there are about 30 miles of streets and
roads. There are three local newspapers —
the Goulburn Herald, the Southern Argus,
and the Goulburn Evening Post. Amongst
the industrial concerns are the City Flour-
mills, the Argyle Flour-mills, Gillespie’s
Tannery, Wood & Company’s Tannery, Gil-
lespie’s Boot and Shoe Factory, the Goulburn
Brewery, and Hunt & Company’s Jam Fac-
tory. Goulburn is the centre of an extensive
agricultural and grazing district. Wheat
forms the staple crop; but oats, barley,
maize, and potatoes are largely grown, the
last-named being of very flue quality.
Dairying is also extensively carried on, and
fruits—especially those suitable to cool
climates—are largely grown, and are of ex-
cellent quality. Gold-fields of moderate ex-
tent are situated in the district, but the
mineral wealth still remains to a considerable
degree undeveloped. Amongst those known
to exist, besides gold, are copper, marble,
slate, and lime. At Mummel a good copper
lode has been discovered, and the mine (of
the same metal) at Currawang, 14 miles dis-
tant, only requires the expenditure of capital
to become the scene of a busy industry.
The places in the neighbourhood of Goulburn
are Bannaby, Big Hill, Binda, Boro, Bun-
gonia, Crookwell, Currawang, Curraweela,
Fullerton, Golspie, Greenwich Park, Gunne-
dah, Jacqua, Jerong, Laggan, Longreach,
Manna Field, Merilla, Pejar, Middlearm,
Mummel, Mutbilly, Tarlo, Myrtleville, Far-
rago, Taralga, Woore, and Woodhouselea.
The scenery around Goulburn is pretty and
pleasant looking. To the north-east the
country is diversified by lateral spurs from
the mountain system while to the south-west
stretches an extensive upland plain, through
which the Southern line passes on its way to
Wagga Wagga and Albury.
There is now under construction from
Goulburn the branch line to Cooma, on the
Manaro tableland. The first section of the
line extending to Bungendore, 40 miles, is
open.
Lake Bathurst, 153 miles, 2,217 feet
above sea-level.— Shortly after leaving
Goulburn the traveller reaches the junction
of “Joppa,” so called it is said from its
proximity to “ Jerusalem,” a farm in the
vicinity. The line passes through a pretty
rolling country of park like lands, largely
owned by the Chisholm and Faithful families,
and devoted by them principally to pastoral
uses although some of the land is now being
turned into cultivation areas, the soil being
well adapted for fruit and cereals. The first
station, Lake Bathurst, is the nearest point
to the lake, a branch line of about a mile in
length running to its shores. It is a most
picturesque sheet of water, surrounded by
well grassed hills that slope gently to
meet its waves. Large flocks of wild fowl
frequent the place ; but the absence of
cover renders it difficult to have any
success with them. The district is well


Lake Bathurst.


settled and farming, with pastoral pursuits,
are largely followed. The tableland here
boasts of a further lake, viz., “ George,”
which is elsewhere described, and the locality
might fitly be termed the lake district of New
South Wales. In addition to these fine sheets
of water, it possesses a splendid climate and
beautiful scenery which will no doubt induce
very many of city folk to take a run to this
charming region, which hitherto, for the
want of facilities, has been too little known.
Tarago, 157 miles, 2,255 feet above
sea-level. —Leaving Lake Bathurst a short
journey of 3 miles brings the traveller to
Tarago, a station important for being the
depot for the trade of Braidwood, and a large
district running down to the Southern coast.
A railway is to be made from here to Braid-
wood.
Bungendore, 177 miles,— The line from
Tarago passes through a country fertile and
varied; but the principal sight is seen shortly
before reaching Bungendore. To the right a
silvery streak beams at first dimly in the
distance ; but before long it is seen to be a
long stretch of water lying quietly in the
basin of a large plain, but behind it rises the
dark background of a range of lofty moun-
tains. This water is recognized at once as
Lake George, concerning which the following
description by Mr. H. C. Bussell, the
Government Astronomer, will prove inter-
esting :
“ Lake George.—Some of the surroundings
of Lake George are of very great interest,
viewed in the light of discussions as to the
possible change in the amount of rainfall in
the Colony during long periods, and although
I cannot now stay to discuss them at length,
I cannot pass them without a short reference
to their bearing on the question. The lake
itself is situated in a depression between two
ranges of hills, some of which, on the western
side, rise to 1,500 feet above the lake. On
the eastern side the hills generally stand
some little distance from the water, but on
the western side, at least in a part of it, the
hills seem to rise abruptly out of the water
at an angle of from 30° to 45°. The hills are
composed of hard metamorphic rocks, the
fragments of which are carried down into the
lake by every shower, and are very soon
polished into gravel by the action of the
waves ; and the enormous deposits of gravel
at both ends of the lake, where the ground
is flat, as well as along the sides, point to a
duration of present conditions which is very
hard to realize. At the present time there
is a gravel ridge a short distance from the
water at the south end. It is a mile and a
quarter long, has been tested for ballast for
the rail way, and found to be at least 15 feet
thick where deepest, and has a base of about
100 yards. This is one of a number of such
deposits at the south end of the lake. * *
In the absence of levels it is impossible to
say what was the extreme size of the lake
in its wet period, but, I should think, at least
forty miles long and ten or twelve wide.
The steep hills which bound the lake on the
west side are deeply furrowed by water, and
afford striking evidence of a time when rain
must have fallen in vastly greater abundance
than it does at the present day. Each of
these gullies, when examined, is found to have
a more or less extensive delta, which has
spread out laterally and into the lake, forming
there a projecting point opposite the gully.
These are now covered with trees, and add
very much to the beauty of the lake by their
picturesque effect. In many cases, especially
at the south end of the lake —that is, near
Douglas House—these deltas are cut through
by the water-course which serves to carry off
the rains of the present day, and these reveal
distinctly the character of the deposit through
which they run, showing that it is made up
entirely of loose stones scarcely rounded at
all, lying now just as they were washed off
the hills and down the gully thousands of
years since. I will not attempt to say how
many thousands; but when we find from the
evidence of the lake dwellings in Europe how
little change has taken place in the level of
the European lakes during the historic period,
the change which is manifest in Lake George
points to a very remote period. Herodotus,
b.c. 500, speaks of the lake dwellings; and
the modern antiquary assigns to those of
Switzerland a date 1500 b.c. Yet so little
has the level of the Lake of Zurich changed
in that time that the dry winter of 1853-4,
by lowering the water in the Lake one foot
below previous levels, revealed to Dr. F.


Kellar the artificial arrangement of some of
the pieces of wood laid bare by the receding
water ; and thus led to his remarkable dis-
coveries. This persistence of level is very
strong evidence in favour of the view that
there has been no great change in the rainfall
there for thousands of years, and probably
the same may be said of Australia. But to
return: Some of these watercourses are 10
to 12 feet deep, and the gravel that is moved
in them by rain now is very small indeed
compared with some of the stones which
appear embedded in the delta they have cut
through. One of the largest of these deposits
is at Douglas House, and as you stand on the
side of the hill you can see its rounded form
starting at something like 50 feet above the
level of the lake. It spreads out some 400
yards to the lake, and about as much laterally.
It is now covered with large trees two or
three feet thick, but its form shows clearly
that it is a deposit from the gully above,
which extends only half-a-mile, and does not
seem to drain more than a square mile of the
hills. All about the surface of the delta, as
well as in the section referred to above, are
indications of the loose and stony character
of the deposit. The gully, cut as it has been
out of hard metamorphic rocks, bears witness
to the tremendous power of water. In
January this year seven inches of rain fell
here in two days, yet the gully scarcely ran
at all through the delta, what water did
come down finding its way to the lake by
soaking through the gravel ; in fact, the
heaviest rain now only makes a little stream
three or four feet wide and a few inches deep.
The greater level of the lake in that long
past period is not difficult to understand,
when looking at the evidence of tropical
rains which the gullies afford. At the same
time the obvious insignificance of the present
rainfall as compared with that which formed
the deltas and filled up the lake, and the
enormous duration of the present order and
condition of things as proved by the discover-
ies in the European lakes, show how ground-
less were the fears gravely expressed in 1871
that the lake would rise up and cover
Bungendore and Collector. The rainfall on
the lake in 1870 was 50 inches, double the
average rainfall, which is 25 inches, and it is
not to be wondered at that the lake rose at
an unusual rate. Still this rain, heavy as it
was, only served to cut little gutters in the
older deposits which had been brought down
the gullies. * * * * *
Bungendore is a bustling little place at
present, lying at the foot of the lake, and
possesses three good hotels. The country
around is fertile and as the rainfall is generally
good farming can be carried on with success
while all round thousands of sheep are
depastured on the rich grasses. The line is
noAv under construction to Cooma, 90 miles
further on.
Yarra Platform, 141 miles ; 2,228 feet
above sea-level. —Yarra is a settlement on
the Southern line, with a platform for the
inhabitants, 7 miles west of Goulburn.
Breadalbane, 149 miles; 2,280 feet
above sea-level. —Breadalbane is the centre
of a pastoral and agricultural district, goods
being received here for Collector, Currawang,
Parkesbourne, &c. Collector is a thriving
settlement, containing three hotels. There
is but one hotel at Breadalbane.
Fish River Platform, 161 miles ; 1,871
feet above sea-level. A platform at a spot
near part of the Fish River, 27 miles west of
Goulburn.
Gunning Station, 165 miles ; 1,893
feet above sea-level. —Gunning is a town
with a station on the Great Southern Rail-
way, 22 miles on the Sydney side of Yass,
and 27 miles west of Goulburn. Gunning
lies on the Meadow Creek. The industry
principally followed in the district is farming,
and in the town several flour-mills have been
established. The principal hotels are kept
by Mr. H. Best and Mrs. Lawless. Two
Protestant Churches are here and one Public
School. Population, 300 souls. Places near
Gunning : Collector, Dalton, Gundai’oo, and
Wheeo. The Railway line here takes a turn
to the south-westward, until it crosses Man-
ton’s Creek, when it trends to the north-west
towards Yass.
Jerrawa Platform, 175 miles; 1,950
feet above sea-level. —A settlement on the
Jerrawa Creek (with a Railway platform),
10 miles south-west of Gunning.


Yass Station, 187 miles ; 1,657 feet
above sea-level. —Yass is an important and
thriving town, prettily situated on the banks
of the Yass River, and in the counties of
King and Murray—the electoral district
being Yass Plains. The town is well laid
out, and consists of one main thoroughfare,
intersected by numerous cross-streets. There
are 33 miles of streets and roads, and a
population for the town of upwards of 2,000
persons, the district nearly 7,000. The town
is incorporated, and has ratable property at
an estimated value of £70,000. It has many
fine buildings. Has churches for the four
principal denominations, a fine Court-house
(erected at a cost of £12,000), a Mechanics’
Institute (which has a well selected library,
containing upwards of 2,500 volumes), a
Hospital, and a well built Public School.
The places round about Yass are : Bogalong,
Cavan, Blakeney’s Creek, Good Hope, Green-
field, Mylora, Murrumbateman, Nanama,
Reed’s Flat, Talina, Tanmangaroo, and Wool-
garlo. The town is well sheltered by heavy
ranges, the formation of which is granite,
limestone, and slate. The district is to a
large extent fn agricultural one, upwards of
12,000 acres being under cultivation. The
staple crops are wheat, maize, and oats,
barley and potatoes being also grown to a
considerable extent. There are valuable
mineral deposits, of which silver, copper, and
lead are the principal; but the resources of
the district in this respect are as yet un-
developed. The river, which divides North
Yass from the main portion of the town, is
spanned by a fine bridge of iron lattice-work.
O’Connelltown is also included within the
town boundaides.
Bowning Station, 194 miles; 1,804 feet
above sea-level. —Bowning is a settlement
taking its name from Mount Bowning and a
creek of the same name 7 miles north-west of
Yass. The Mount is a conspicuous object
behind the Station, rising 1,000 feet above
the level of the surrounding country. It is
covered with splendid timber, and from its
summit a grand view of the country, with
the Murrumbidgee and Yass River, is ob-
tained. Bowning is chiefly a pastoral district,
but the soil is rich and well adapted for
cereals. Near Bowning are some extensive
lime-kilns. The hotels are the “Commercial”
and “Bowning.” Goods are received here for
Gundagai, Tumut, Adelong, Grahamstown,
Coolac, and Bookham.
Binalong Station, 208 miles; 1,568
feet above sea-level. —Binalong is a small
post town in the Burrowa district, 14 miles
west-north-west of Bowning and 21 miles
from Yass. Binalong stands on an eminence
with wooded hills sweeping in graceful undu-
lations around it. Here are several hotels,
a Church, a Public School, and a lock-up.
It is surrounded with good alluvial land, and
is 15 miles from Burrowa, the chief place of
the district. Burrowa is a township with a
population of 650. It contains two Hour-
mills, and in the vicinity are the Progmoor
Copper-mines.
Galong Platform, 216 miles; 1,641
feet above sea-level. —A spot where there
is a platform 8 miles to the north-west of
Binalong. Near Galong is the residence of
The Hon. John Nagel Ryan. A branch
Railway is to be made from this place to
Burrowa, 12 miles.
Cunningar Platform, 225 miles ; 1,479
feet above sea-level. —A settlement (with
a platform) 9 miles to the north-west of
Galong Platform, and 38 miles from Yass.
Harden Station, 228 miles ; 1,351 feet
above sea-level. —A station in the District
of Young. Murrumburrah (230 miles) was
the original centre, but owing to the steep
gradient goods trains cannot stop here, and
Harden Station consequently receives the
traffic. The passenger traffic principally goes
to Murrumburrah. Murrumburrah possesses
three churches, a number of stores, two banks,
six hotels, post and telegraph office, steam flour-
mill, two coach-building establishments, &c.
The population is about 1,000. Harden is
situated in a picturesque undulating district,
lightly timbered, and is likely to become a
township of some importance, as it is to be the
j unction of the Railway to connect the Southern
with the Western Railway system, A section
of this line, viz., to Young, 18 miles, is now open.
Harden, although only a township of recent for-
mation, has now a settled population of about


250. A large traffic is now done here, goods
being received for Young,—unimportant town
with apopulationof 1,500, and containing four-
teen hotels, two large flour-mills, and several
manufactories, Grenfell, Marengo, Wombat,
Morangerell, &c. The Young District is noted
for the quantity and quality of wheat grown,
the soil being especially suited for this cereal,
which in good seasons will in parts average
30 bushels to the acre. Harden is the centre
of a large pastoral area, over 10,000 bales of
wool being forwarded from this station during
1881. At 1J mile from Harden there is a
large “ opening” over Murrumburrah Creek,
spanned by a timber bridge 250 feet in
length. This bridge is 24 feet below the
level of the neighbouring station. The line
then ascends on a gradient of 1 in 40 for If
mile, reaching a height of 1,480 feet where
there is a heavy cutting of 50,000 yards and
39 feet deep. From this point the line
begins to descend again, and continues de-
scending to Demondrille Creek, where there
is a bridge of four openings 26 feet span.
Connaughtman’s Creek is the next water-
course in the way, and that is crossed by a
brick bridge. Close to this creek is the
Wallendbeen Platform.
Extension to Young. —The extension,
Murrumburrah to Young, is the first section
of the line that is destined to connect the
Southern Railway with the Western. The
line to Young was opened in March, 1885,
running from Demondrill Junction, a short
distance beyond Murrumburrah. The dis-
tance is 18 miles, making Young 249 miles
from Sydney. Accommodation is provided
at Corrowong, but the traffic here is in-
considerable, the bulk of the business being
transacted at Young. The town first sprang
into importance during the early days of
gold-mining, the place being then known as
“ Lambing Flat,” and was the scene of a
historic riot, the military having to be sent
from Sydney to quell the affair, which arose
out of the determination on the part of the
miners to drive the Chinese who had come
here in thousands from the field. Mining is
still carried on in the vicinity, and even in
the Railway Station yard traces are seen of
the old workings. Young is pleasantly
situated on a large flat, well-wooded hills
rising at some little distance from the town,
which being 1,416 feet above sea-level has a
very agreeable climate. Within the town
are several large stores and well-kept
hostelries, a large business being transacted
here, as Young is the centre of a rich pastoral
and agricultural district; in fact wheat from
the locality has obtained a premier prize in an
International Exhibition, and it is anticipated
the traffic in agricultural produce from this
place, now that the Railway gives facilities,
will be large. The principal inland townships
drawing supplies from Young are Grenfell,
Marengo, Morangarell, and Monteagle.
Wallendbeen Platform, 241 miles; 1,514
feet above sea-level. —A village, with a
Railway Platform, in the District of Young,
13 miles south-west of Murrumburrah, and
54 miles from Yass. The soil increases in
richness after Wallendbeen is left behind,
until it can be seen in the cuttings several
feet deep; and in the fields its capabilities
meet the eye in the flourishing condition of
the farms which are passed as the train goes
by, on each side of the line. The last 5 or
6 miles of country between Wallendbeen and
Cootamundra is tolerably level.
Cootamundra Station, 253 miles ; 1,079
feet above sea-level. —The station of Coota-
mundra (formerly Cobramundra) is in the
District of Gundagai, 12 miles south-west
of Wallendbeen. Cootamundra (a thriving
place) forms part of a rich and fertile dis-
trict, many miles in extent. From Coota-
mundra to Wagga (a distance of about 50
miles) there is much good land. A good
deal of it is formed by the disintegration of
granite; but many of the cuttings show a
great depth of rich, chocolate, loamy soil,
just the very thing for wheat-growing and
vineyards. An immense tract of this part
of the country remains untilled. Coota-
mundra, according to the Census of 1881,
had a population of nearly 1,000. In 1871
the population numbered only 237. The
increasing importance of Cootamundra is
due in a great measure to the Railway,
and Cootamundra will become a yet more
important station as a line has been
opened from this place to Gundagai. The
discovery of the celebrated Temora Gold-field


has also had a marked influence upon Coota-
mundra. The gold-field is situated about 30
miles from the station, at which most of the
goods for Temora are received. Temora is
probably the richest field discovered in the
Colony in recent years : alluvial working has
principally been canned on, but attention
is now being given to the reefs, and it is the
opinion of the Government Geological Sur-
veyor that quartz-reefing will become a per-
manent industry in the district. The reefs
met with have proved rich. The soil in the
vicinity of Temora is also of good quality, and
suitable for grain. The population of Temora
(1881) was 3,254. The country becomes
uneven after leaving Oootamundra, and the
earthworks between that place and Bethungra
are consequently heavy. The highest point
on the line between Murrumburrah and
Oootamundra is at a distance of 243|- miles
from Sydney, at which place the height is
1,667 feet above the level of the sea.
Then the line descends on a 1 in 40
gradient for a distance of If mile, and
reaches the Oootamundra Flats ; 3 miles on
the Goulburn side of Oootamundra there is
a water-station. The Station buildings at
Oootamundra are of timber with galvanized-
iron roofing, and comprise a general waiting-
room, a ladies’ waiting-room, ticket office,
and porters’ room. There is also a goods-
shed, 60 feet by 30 feet; and a turn-table for
the engine, and a residence for the Railway
Station-master have also been constructed.
The Southern Railway has, without doubt,
here tapped a fine wheat-growing district of
very considerable area; but in addition to the
agricultural population there, many of the
people are becoming small squatters, and in
this way making Oootamundra a wool-produc-
ing district as well as a grain-growing one.
Near Oootamundra are some fine bluestone
quarries. The principal hotels in Coota-
mundra are the “Albion” and “Royal.”
Cootamnndra to Gundagai, 31 miles.—
This extension was recently publicly opened
(June 1886), and is the first portion of the
line which is ultimately to extend to Tumut.
The distance to Gundagai is 33 miles, and at
intermediate points there are stations to take
the local traffic, viz., at Drawlir, Multana
(once a flourishing mining centre), and Ooolac.
All have a fair local traffic, largely agricul-
tural, as the country is well watered and the
soil fertile. Gundagai is one of the oldest of
the southern townships, and is built near the
Murrumbidgee River; in fact its proximity
to this stream was the cause of a serious
catastrophe many years ago. The original
town was built on the flats bordering the
river, notwithstanding, it is said, the warn-
ing given by the blacks that sooner or
later the site would be inundated. For
a long time the residents were not troubled,
but at last, in 1882, the river overflowed
its banks, causing one of the most dis-
astrous floods on record in the Colony,
completely inundating the whole town and
causing the loss of about 80 lives. This
bitter lesson taught the people to be more
cautious, and the present township is now
situated on a rise back from the river. The
population is estimated at 1,500 persons, and
the town contains numerous substantial build-
ings and possesses good hotel accommodation.
Agriculture and pastoral interests are fol-
lowed, the river flats giving in good seasons
prolific crops, maize yielding as high as
100 bushels to the acre, and wheat 30. It
has also been proved that hops will grow
splendidly at Gundagai; and in view of the
demand for this article, and that at present
we have to import what we require, it is to
be hoped that enterprise will be shown in
cultivating this suitable crop. All the
“Home” fruits also grow splendidly, and
should form a large item of traffic. Tobacco
is also grown. The district is well known as
a mining one, the gold reefs of Adelong being
among the best known in the Colony, while
the rare mineral asbestos has been found
here. A slate quarry is also working it is
said with profitable results. A large traffic
is done at the station, goods coming to hand
principally from Adelong, Tumut, and Tum-
berumba. The country, it may be mentioned,
is basaltic, and in parts is heavily timbered.
Fish—Murray cod and bream—are plentiful
in the river, and good shooting—wild fowl—
can be had. Beyond Gundagai the country
is mountainous and very picturesque.
Cungegong Platform, 262 miles; 1,269
feet above sea-level. —A Platform 9 miles
from Oootamundra, and 6 from Bethungra.


After leaving Cootamundra the line passes
through a fairly fertile land, and at intervals
cultivated areas are seen. A creek—Salt
Clay—is also crossed twice. At one of the
crossings the deplorable Cootamundra acci-
dent happened in January, 1885, when seven
persons lost their lives, the line being washed
away and the train wrecked in the creek.
Bethungra Station, 268 miles; 1,051
feet above sea-level. —Bethungra is a
pastoral settlement (with a Station on the
Railway) in the District of Gundagai, 15
miles south-west of Cootamundra and 81
miles (by rail) beyond Yass. Bethungra is a
Station of small importance, and possesses
two hotels.
Illabo Platform, 276 miles ; 881
feet above sea-level. —This Platform on
the Southern line, was formerly called Billa-
bong, from the Billabong Creek, over which
there is a 10ft. culvert for the Railway to
pass.
Junee Station, 286 miles; 985 feet
above sea-level. —Junee, 10 miles west of
Bethungra, is a pastoral settlement in the
Wagga Wagga District, on the Houlahan
Creek, in the midst of a fine undulating
country. It is 23 miles north of Wagga
Wagga. Gold and limestone are found in the
vicinity. The original township is 5 miles
away from Junee Junction, but now in the
vicinity of the Station a new township has
been formed. It contains several hotels, two
brick-yards, timber-yard, gas-works (for sup-
plying the Railway carriages), and a flour-mill
is proposed. Population, about 1000. The land
in the vicinity is well adapted for agricultural
purposes, and a good deal of farming is carried
on. Junee is an important Junction, the
South-western Railway branching from the
Southern line at this place, and running
to Hay. Travellers to Hay and stations on
the South-western line must change carriages
here. Substantial Station buildings are
erected, and the largest and most complete
refreshment-rooms on the Railway has been
established here, ample time being allowed by
all passenger trains for travellers to obtain
refreshment.
Harefield Platform, 294 miles; 830
feet above sea-level. —This platform stands
between Junee and Wagga Wagga—B miles
from the former place and 14 miles from the
latter.
Bomen Station, 304 miles ; 739 feet
above sea-level.— Bomen is on the out-
skirts of Wagga Wagga, being situated on
the north bank of the Murrumbidgee, Wagga
Wagga being on the south. A considerable
quantity of agricultural produce is grown in
the District around about and sent from this
station. There are also here extensive live
stock yards.
Wagga Wagga, 309 miles ; 607 feet
above sea-level. —After leaving Bomen the
principal object of interest is the viaduct
over the Murrumbidgee. The approaches on
both sides are of timber, and comprise on the
north side 215 spans of 29 feet 6 inches each
for the escape of flood-waters and 51 spans
on the south side, the height of the timber
varying from 9 to 24 feet, the total length of
timber framing being 7,900 feet. The main
channel of the river is crossed by a substantial
iron bridge, having two continuous wrought-
iron lattice girders of 636 feet each in length.
The bridge is divided into four spans,
of 150 feet each span, being supported on
two cast-iron cylinders 9 feet in diameter.
Wagga Wagga stands on the south side
of the Murrumbidgee. The view of the river
as the traveller passes by, its banks covered
with a garment of bright green and fringed
with some specimens of fine trees, is very
pretty. Wagga Wagga is one of the most
progressive and prosperous towns in the
southern division of the Colony. It is the
centre of the rich pastoral district of the
Murrumbidgee and commands an extensive
trade, the Railway receipts at this station
during 1884 being =£32,130 The station, a
handsome and lai’ge edifice, is built on the
eastern side of the town, which possesses
many good buildings, including four Churches,
four Banks, Post and Telegraph Office, some
large stores and hotels ; the principal hotels
are those conducted by Messrs. Brynes,
Macalister, Phillips, Moxham, Monk, Brown,
Maher, &c. The manufacturing industries of
the town are fairly numerous, embracing a


soap manufactory, three aerated water manu-
factories, four brick-works, one wool-washing
establishment, two saw-mills, two flour-mills,
three breweries, and one tannery. Several
important towns in the districts around
Wagga draw their supplies from this station,
among which may be mentioned Adelong,
Tumut, and Tumberumba. These places are
important centres, but their resources are
not fully developed, owing to the want of a
better means of conveyance for products
than they now possess. To obviate this, the
people concerned are agitating for a Railway
from Wagga Wagga to Tumberumba, and
the approval has been given for the con-
struction of the line. Although the dis-
trict is principally a pastoral one, it is well
adapted for agriculture, and a considerable
quantity of wheat, oats, and barley is grown ;
it is suitable also for tobacco and the vine.
A large future seems to be in store for
Wagga Wagga as it will always be tlie centre
of a rich and extensive district. It will
probably be the junction of Branch Railways,
and as the rich and fertile areas in the
district are occupied and cultivated, the
prosperity and influence of the town will
correspondingly increase. Wagga Wagga
is a municipality, with a population of 3,975
souls, and is lighted with gas. It supports
two newspapers —the Express and Advertiser.
Trains generally wait here for a few minutes,
and light refreshments can be obtained,
Sandy Creek, 318 miles; 658 feet
above sea-level. —Shortly after leaving
Wagga Wagga extensive cattle sale-yards are
passed and the country is cultivated and
open. From 310 to 313 miles almost con-
tinuous cuttings are passed through, the
steepest gradient—l in 60—occurring at 311
miles. The line generally from Wagga
Wagga to Albury is level, necessitating a
large number of flood openings. The works
are comparatively light; the largest cutting
is about 32,000 cubic yards and the largest
embankment about 50,000 cubic yards. The
longest viaduct is that which crosses the
Billabong Creek at Culcairn, and consists of
nine 26 feet 9 inch spans; the sharpest
curve is 50 chains radius. Sandy Creek is
an unimportant station, receiving goods for a
few settlers and squatters in the vicinity.
G
The Rock, 327 miles ; 708 feet
above sea-level. —As the line approaches
this Station the appearance of the country
improves, the foliage of the trees, which are
principally peppermint, being fresher and
more luxuriant, and the soil apparently rich.
The Rock receives its name from a great
overhanging mass of rock on the mountain
range which is seen on the west side of the
line near the Station. The highest point is
about 2,000 feet; and although the ascent of
the range is somewhat difficult, the traveller
is well repaid by the grand view that is
obtained from the summit over the sur-
rounding country, with the Murrumbidgee
winding through the plain in the distance. On
the ranges wallaby and kangaroo are numerous,
and in the vicinity wild ducks and other game
are plentiful. The Rock is the nearest station
to the celebrated run Brookong—one of the
largest sheep stations in the Colony. Coaches
run to Brookong and Tirana. There is one
hotel at The Rock—the “ King’s Own.”
Yerong Creek, 336 miles; 703 feet
above sea-level. —Between The Rock and
Yerong Creek the country is uninteresing,
being covered principally with pine scrub.
Yerong Creek is an unimportant settlement.
Culcairn, 356 miles ; 710 feet above
sea-level. —The country passed through
between Yerong Creek and Culcairn is
wholly used for pastoral purposes. At Dudal
Cooma, a few miles from Culcairn, there are
large tanks for supplying the locomotives
with water. Culcairn is the centre of a
somewhat extensive district, receiving goods
for Tumberumba, Germantown, Cookadina,
Round Hill (so called from the peculiar shape
of a mountain in the vicinity), Morren, lire.
Wheat is grown to a large extent, but the
pastoral is the principal industry.
Gerogery, 368 miles; 799 feet above
sea-level. —After a journey of 12 miles
from Culcairn Gerogery is reached, the
country intervening being well suited for
pastoral purposes, for which it is principally
used. On both sides of the line run moun-
tain ridges, one of which is known as the
Table-top from its peculiar formation.
Within a short distance of the station is


Morgan’s look-out and cave—so called after
the notorious freebooter Morgan, who held
this district in terror some years back. Goods
are received at this station for Jindera, Wal-
bundria, Howlong, Walla Walla, Moorwatha,
&c. In the district a large extent of country
is under wheat. The only hotel at Gerogery
is the “ Missouri Tavern.”
Yambla. —This is a platform, 378 miles
from Sydney. In the district a considerable
quantity of wheat is grown, and there are
also some important sheep stations. The
township of Bowna is 4 miles from the
Railway Station ; Bowna contains two hotels
—the “White Horse” and “Crown.”
Albury, 386 miles; 531 feet above
sea-level. —As the train draws near to the
federal city the character of the country
improves; waving wheat-fields are passed
and numerous vineyards, the valley of the
Murray being celebrated for its suitability
for the cultivation of the vine. At Etta-
mogah (a platform 5 miles from Albury) the
extensive vineyard from which the Platform
derives its name is seen; and then 3 miles
further on the noted Murray Valley vine-
yard (Fallon’s) is passed. Owing to a cutting
occurring at this point the full extent of the
vineyard, which covers no less than 130 acres,
cannot be seen. As the train draws nearer
to the station the view is a very pretty one—
Albury nestles at the foot of many hills, those
in the vicinity of the town being vine-clad,
while others stretching back are dark with tall
trees. Albury is 190 miles from Melbourne,
and is the most important town on the border
between the two Colonies of New South
Wales and Victoria. It was here that the
Hume-Hovell expedition first struck the
river Murray, and the Union Bridge—a
wooden structure of great strength —now
spans the stream a few hundred yards from
the spot where it was first crossed in a punt
by white men. The principal industry is
that of the vine, although since the imposition
of almost prohibitive duties on the grape and
its produce by Victoria, the vignerons have
been heavily handicapped and injured, and
many of the smaller ones have converted
their vineyards into areas for the cultivation
of cereals and garden produce. In the
vicinity of Albury there are, however, four
or five of the most valuable vineyards in the
Murray Valley. These are J. T. Fallon’s,
Greer Bros’., G. Fleming’s, R. Phelps’, and
the Ettamogah vineyard owned by Messrs.
Harbottle, Biddulph, and Alsop. The first-
named vineyard, together with the capacious
cellars in Kiewa-street, Albury, containing a
number of the enormous 25,000-gallon vats,
made from timber grown in the district, is the
principal object of interest. A considerable
area of land is under cultivation and the
district supplies the Melbourne market with
large weekly consignments of sheep and
bullocks. A large percentage of the farmers
—and Albury is the centre of a very large
“ free selecting” district —also keep orchards
and bring in fruits of all kind in season.
There is also some tobacco grown, and among
the hills spoken of as closely surrounding the
town are some small colonies of miners, who
earn a fair living in the reefs of the Black
Range, Nail Can, Hawkes’ View, and others.
Among the public buildings the passenger
Railway Station stands pre-eminent. It is
built at the end of Smollett-street, about |
mile from the Post Office, and is the hand-
somest structure of its kind in the Colony,
It is constructed of red and white bricks of
exceptionally excellent manufacture, dressed
with cement, roofed with slate, and sur-
mounted by a clock tower 80 feet high. It
is 300 feet in length and 46 in width. The
Post Office, at the corner of Dean and Kiewa
Streets, the Gaol, Hospital, Convent, Me-
chanics’ Institute, and the places of worship
of the respective denominations, form the
public buildings. There are four Banks—
New South Wales, Australasia, Australian
Joint Stock, and the Commercial Banking
Association, two breweries, two mills, and a
large number of hotels, among which may be
mentioned “ The Globe,” “ Rose,” “ Club,”
« Albury,” and “ Exchange” as the principal
ones, A botanic reserve newly laid out
affords a pleasant place of recreation for the
local public on the southern side of the town
and near the river, where also is situated the
cricket-field. The population at the 1881
census was reckoned at 4,080, and the
borough, which returns a Member to Parlia-
ment, comprises property having the assessed
value of £29,000.


In June, 1883, the Railway extension be-
tween Albury and Wodonga was opened for
traffic, so that uninterrupted railway com-
munication is now given between Sydney
and Melbourne. The Murray is crossed by
a permanent structure of iron. The opening
of the through line has had much influence
in increasing the passenger traffic by rail
between the two capitals, and a daily expx*ess
train, which does the journey under twenty
hours, is largely patronized.
VI.—JUNES TO HAY.
(THE SOUTH-WESTERN LINE.)
Until quite recently the immense pastoral
riches of the greater portion of the Riverina
district—the grandest pastoral district in the
Colony—was, on account of the want of
trading facilities between it and Sydney,
diverted to Melbourne, and the goods used in
the district were almost entirely Victorian.
In February, 1881, however, the commercial
supremacy held by Victoria was weakened by
the opening of the first section of the line
which was to be made to Hay. This section
extended from Junee, 287 miles from Sydney,
to Narrandera. At various dates, succeeding
sections were opened, and on the 4th July
the Railway reached its present terminus,
the town of Hay, on the river Murrum-
bidgee, and the trade is now fast coming
to our own metropolis. Hay is distant from
Sydney by rail 455 miles, and this, it may be
mentioned, is the longest line in any of the
Australasian Colonies. The line runs on the
north bank of the Murrumbidgee, but the
river is not visible from the Railway. The
line passes through vast plains which stretch
as far as the eye can reach, and are in many
places quite treeless. The industry of the
districts passed through is almost entirely
pastoral, 37,300 bales of wool being sent from
the various stations along the line for the
wool season of 1884-85, and succeeding
seasons will show, it is anticipated, a much
larger return. A good timber trade has
recently sprung up, principally at Devlin’s
Siding, Coolaman, and Narrandera, In
the construction of the line no engineer-
ing difficulties had to be encountered; the
sharpest curve is 60 chains radius, the
steepest gradient - 1 in 50, and all the works
necessary are occasional openings to carry off
flood-waters. At one part the line runs
straight and almost level for 30 miles. There
is a descent of 680 feet between Junee and
Hay—l 67 miles—but it is so gradual that
the train appears to run for the whole dis-
tance over a level plain. The rails used
throughout weigh 70 lbs. to the yard. The
Stations on the line are as follows :
Old Junee, 292 miles; 833 feet above
sea-level. —This Station is close to the site
of the original Junee township. The district
is a pastoral one, and in the wool seasons a
good quantity of wool is despatched from this
Station. The soil is suited for cereals, but
agriculture is not largely followed. The
country around is open well-timbered, and
park-like.
Coolaman/310 miles; 820 feet above
sea-level. —Between Coolaman and Old
Junee the platform of Marrar (301 miles) is
situated. Coolaman is only considered to be
a platform, but a fair amount of traffic is
forwarded from here, principally wool and
timber—three saw-mills being at work in the
vicinity. A fair amount of land is also being
brought under cultivation in the locality, and
it is anticipated grain will soon form an
important item in the goods despatched.
Grong Grong, 335 miles; 535 feet
above sea-level. —Grong Grong does not
present an inviting appearance from the
Railway line, the Station-house, &c., being
the only building in the vicinity. A town-
ship has, however, been surveyed here, and
when the land is sold a township will soon
spring up. Grong Grong receives the pro-
duce from several large sheep stations in the
district, and the wool from a large wool-
washing establishment on the Murrumbidgee,
7 miles away. Since the construction of the


Railway a good many selections have been
taken up and farming actively commenced.
A large quantity of timber, principally pine, is
sent from Grong Grong from two saw-mills
in the neighbourhood. The district possesses
good indications of gold, but at present
nothing is being done in connection with
mining.
Narrandera to Jerilderie. —This line,
running from Narrandera to Jerilderie, a
distance of 65 miles, was first opened for
traffic in September, 1884, the Murrumbidgee
at Narrandera being crossed by a substantial
iron bridge. The line runs through a pastoral
country purely, and the traffic outwards from
it is wool and live stock, the inward traffic
being principally station supplies. The line
presents no engineering features of notice, and
is, generally speaking, without any particular
scenic views, the Railway running through
the heart of immense plains, partly salt bush,
and admirably adapted for the purpose for
which they are used. There are two stations
only in the extension, Colombo and Jerilderie,
distant respectively 377 miles and 412 miles
from Sydney. This extension, as previously
mentioned, deals with purely pastoral traffic,
the wool, however, previous to the advent of
the Railway, going to Victoria; but this
season, 1885-86, it is expected it will come to
Sydney. The plains offer excellent facilities
for shooting, turkey and kangaroo being plen-
tiful, while wild fowl are numerous where
water is found.
Jerilderie is a town of some importance,
situated on the Edwards River. It lies
close to the Victorian Border, and it will be
remembered as being the place that was
“ stuck up” by the notorious Kelly gang of
bushrangers. The town affords good hotel
accommodation, the principal business being-
done with the Victorian merchants, owing
to its nearness with the Victorian capital ;
locally the business relation exists princi-
pally with Deniliquin, Murray, Hay, Tocum-
wall, &c,
Narrandera, 348 miles; 547 feet above
sea-level. —Narrandera is a progressive town,
situated on the north bank of the Murrum-
bidgee, and contains a population of 1,142
souls. In 1871 the number was only 142,
so that an increase of no less than 1,000 has
taken place within ten years. The pastoral
is the principal industry, but a large timber
trade is done here, five steam saw-mills being
in active and continuous work in the town.
The banks of the Murrumbidgee are thickly
timbered with splendid red gum, and on the
ridges forests of excellent pine are found.
Some good stores are open in Narrandera,
and nineteen hotels, the principal of which are
the “Royal,” “Royal Mail,” “Australian,”
“ Tattersall’s” and “ Star,” The only manu-
factory in the town is a brewery. Narrandera
is nicely situated on the Murrumbidgee, along
which some pretty views are to be found.
The most noteworthy natural objects in the
district however are Lake Cudgellico, Lake
Tirana, and Lake Coolicumpalmer. Lake
Cudgellico is a very picturesque sheet of
water, being studded with charming little
isles, and lying as it does in the centre of a
large plain, it affords a very pretty picture.
These lakes abound with fish, and are the
resort of large numbers of wild fowl, so that
sportsmen can here find plenty to engage
their attention. In the Murrumbidgee, a large
quantity of fish—Murray cod and bream—is
caught and sent to various stations along the
line. A large wool traffic is done at this
station, and a fair amount of general business.
Whilton, 376 miles; 433 feet above sea-
level.—At 358 miles a platform. The Quarry
is passed, and at 376 miles the train draws up
at Whilton. Whilton is situated 6|- miles from
the Murrumbidgee, and receives the produce
of a number of sheep stations situated between
the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers.
Beyond a few stores there are no buildings at
Whilton ; a township has however been laid
out. The district is purely a pastoral one.
Darlington, 386 miles; 412 feet above
sea-level.— The Darlington Railway Station
is situated about 8 miles from the township
of Darlington Point on the Murrumbidgee,
the principal traffic being for that township,
and the produce sent away is principally
wool from the pastoral district surrounding
the station. At Darlington Point is Waran-
gesda, a large mission establishment for the
aboriginals, under the superintendence of the
Rev. G. Gribble. Darlington possesses two
hotels.


Carathool, 420 miles ; 353 feet above
sea-level.- -Carathool is 34 miles from the
terminus of the line, Hay. The station is
in the centre of a pastoral area; the traffic
from the station being principally wool, skins,
&c. Traffic is received from Gunbar, Hillston,
Cobar, and Mount Hope. Two hotels at the
station, the “ Carathool,” and “ Carathool
Railway Hotel.” On the plains near the sta-
tion good shooting is obtained, wild turkeys
and kangaroo being numerous. Between
Carathool and Hay are several platforms for
receiving wool, &c., from the large stations
in the vicinity.
Hay, 454 miles; 305 feet above sea-
level.—After the long run of 454 miles from
Sydney, the discomfort of which however can
be greatly relieved by travelling a considerable
portion of the journey overnight in one of
the palace sleeping cars, Hay is reached.
It is pleasantly situated on the north bank
of the Murrumbidgee, which is here an im-
portant river. Previous to the opening of
the Railway line the traffic of the town and
district was done by river steamers, and the
scene presented on the river by the steamers
loading and unloading their cargoes at the
various wharfs was a busy one. The extent of
the traffic can be judged when it is mentioned
that for eleven months of 1880, seventy
steamers, with an aggregate tonnage of 17,270
tons, cleared outward at the Custom-house,
Hay. The river is crossed by a fine bridge,
which carries the road traffic between Hay
and the more Southern districts, and Victoria.
Hay is a municipality, and has a popula-
tion (1881) of 2,073. It is said to be one of
the best laid-out towns in the Colony ; it has
fine wide streets, well kept and planted with
ti'ees, and Avater is laid on from the Murrum-
bidgee all over the toAvn. The district around
does not present many striking vieAvs, the
country being generally flat and timberless,
but well adapted for pastoral purposes. Along
the banks of the Murrumbidgee, hoAvever,
there is some splendid timber. The indus-
tries of Hay are wool scouring and washing
establishments, a soap factory, brewery, cor-
dial manufactory, and coach factory. The
principal hotels are “Tattersall’s,” the “Cale-
donian,” “Commercial,” “Criterion,’’“Royal,”
“CroAvn,” and “South Hay.”
Hay is, and from its central position is
likely to be, the most important town in the
South-western District, receiving the large
portion of the traffic from the settlements and
stations along the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan
Rivers and surrounding districts, while
copper is received from the extensive mines at
Nymagee andMountHope. Hay might almost
at one time haA-e been called a Victorian
town; many of its residents Avere Vic-
torians, and its trade Avas done entirely Avith
Victoria, Sydney goods being quite unknown.
Since the opening of the Railway, however,
Sydney goods are fast pushing the Melbourne
articles out of the Hay market. The large
clips of avool are being dispatched to Sydney,
and the people feel themselves more closely
identified Avith the progress of their own
Colony and metropolis.
VIL—SYDNEY, viâ BLACKTOWN, TO RICHMOND.
(SUBSIDIARY BRANCH OF WESTERN LINE.)
Note. —The first 22 miles on the Railway
from the Metropolis to Richmond are upon
the Main Trunk line, as far as Granville;
and then on the Western line, properly so
called, as far as Blacktown. The folloAving
stations and stopping-places have therefore
to be passed : Sydney, Eveleigh, McDonald
Toion, Newtown, Stanmore , Petersham,
Summer Hill, Ashfield, Croydon , BurAvood,
Redmyre, Homebush, Rookwood, Auburn ,
and Granville. Then (on the Western line)
Parramatta, Seven Hills, and BlacktoAvn.
All these stations and stopping-places have
already been described elsewhere. The Itin-
erary for the Blacktown and Richmond branch
line will commence at Blacktown.
Blacktown Station, 22 miles from
Sydney ; 183 feet above sea-level. —The
Railway traveller intending to visit Richmond
(or any place on the Blacktown and Richmond
subsidiary line) must change from his car in
the Western train into one of the carriages
of the branch line at Blacktown. This


subsidiary line leaves Blacktown in a north-
westerly direction, and passes through a
pleasant and diversified country, for 6 miles,
until it reaches Riverstone Station.
Riverstone Station, 28 miles ; 78 feet
above sea-level. —Riverstone is a small
agricultural settlement, whence wood is pro-
curable in considerable quantities for firing.
It is 6 miles from Windsor by rail.
Mulgrave Station, 33 miles; 42 feet
above sea-level. —Mulgrave is a small agri-
cultural settlement on the eastern bank of
the South Creek, 1 mile from Windsor. It
is principally used by the inhabitants of Pitt
Town, and the farmers living to the south-
east of that township.
Windsor Station, 34 miles; 41 feet
above sea-level. —Windsor, “ the capital of
the Hawkesbury,” is a very old town situated
on that river, near its junction with the
South Creek and the Rickaby Ponds. The
Hawkesbury is crossed here by an important
bridge, supported by iron cylinders; an iron
bridge also crosses South Creek. Windsor
contained in the early days of the Colony the
country seat of Governor Macquarie; the
house in which he resided is still standing,
and is an object of much interest. The soil
of the country around is wonderfully fertile,
and, but for the floods to which the low land
is subject, would prove invaluable for farming
property. As it is, there is much wealth
here accumulated by the industrious in
favourable seasons. Splendid timber is also
obtained in the district. In regard to its
relative position, Richmond lies 4 miles to
the west, Wilberforce 4| miles to the north-
west, and Pitt Town 4 miles north of Windsor.
Windsor was proclaimed a municipality in
1871, and has ratable property valued at
£68,456. Amongst the public buildings are :
A Court-house, a School of Arts, Post and
Telegraph Office, a Hospital and Benevolent
Asylum, Churches in connection with all the
principal denominations, and a Public School.
The manufactories comprise a number of
leather-works, coach and buggy factories,
wine-making, &c. The principal hotels are the
“Royal,” “ Fitzroy,” and “Railway.” Here
local newspapers are published. Population
(1881), 2,000. The Anglican Church is a
quaint old edifice in the “ Georgian” style of
architecture. In its churchyard are some
curious and interesting tombs. There is a
fine park at Windsor, and the town now
contains many beautiful and commodious
buildings. From Windsor the tourist may
go by a small river steamer (starting usually
at Pitt Town) down the Hawkesbury to
Wiseman’s Perry and St. Albans—a most
delightful trip. (See Route No. 17.)
Clarendon Platform, 36 miles; about
50 feet above sea-level. —Clarendon is a
platform on the edge of the Richmond
Common, 2 miles from Windsor and 2 from
Richmond. Here the Hawkesbury Turf
Club have established a racecourse, and the
race meetings are largely patronized by metro-
politan and local visitors.
Richmond Station, 38 miles; 61 feet
above sea-level. —Richmond is a pretty
township, 4 miles west of Windsor. It was
proclaimed a municipality in 1872, and pos-
sesses ratable property to the amount of
£BB,OOO. Of late years (as in the neigh-
bouring town of Windsor) there has been a
great improvement in Richmond. The town-
ship contains several good buildings, including
the Churches of the four principal denomina-
tions, the School of Arts, the Court-house,
and the. Railway Station. There are several
good Hotels, principal “ Royal” and “ Post-
office.” Population, 1,239 souls. The sur-
rounding flats are under cultivation. At
Richmond Mr. Andrew Town has his celebrated
stud farm, where a large number of the best
bred horses in the Colony are to be seen. At
Richmond the tourist can hire a car and drive
(at a comparatively small charge) to the
Kurrajong Heights, where the scenery is
lovely in the extreme, consisting of waterfalls,
gorges, dells, and forests. The Vale of Avoca
(a meeting of the waters of the Grose and a
fine mountain stream) can readily be reached
from the road between Richmond and Kurra-
jong, turning off, to the westward, at Lam-
rock’s. This picturesque locality should be
visited by the tourist. At the Kurrajong
there are several houses at which the tourist
can board and lodge. Behind one of these
(“ Belmore Lodge”) at the top of the Big


Hill, there is a magnificent view of the
County of Cumberland, and much of the
adjacent country in the distance. The road
from this spot is continued over the moun-
tains to Mount Wilson’s Station, on the
Great Western Railway. This track, chiefly
used for cattle, is known as Bell’s Line of
Road, and abounds with grand and beautiful
scenery. The tourist had, however, much
better not attempt to travel over it without a
guide. The distance from the Kurrajong to
the Mount Wilson Station is about 26 miles.
VIII.—NEWCASTLE TO GLEN INNES.
(GREAT NORTHERN TRUNK LINE.)
Note. —The Great Northern Trunk Line,
between the City of Newcastle and Glen
Innes, is at present unconnected with the
Western and Southern Lines, and their Sub-
sidiary Branches. The Parliament has, how-
ever, determined that these two Trunk Lines
shall be joined by a Line of Railway so as
to form one complete Railway System, in-
stead of two unconnected ones ; and the con-
tract for the construction of the Sydney
Railway has been let and divided into four
contracts; No. 1, Messrs. Amos & Co., 36
miles; No. 2, the bridge over the Hawkes-
bury River, Union Bridge Company ; No. 3,
Mr. George Blunt, 13 miles; No. 4, Messrs.
Amos & Co., 50 miles. The total length of
Railway will be 95| miles, 20 miles greater
than the direct sea route. The opening
up of this line will greatly increase the
prosperity of Newcastle and the surround-
ing districts. Already nearly the whole
of the land along the line of rail has been
taken up, and a considerable impetus has
already been given to different industries,
owing to the facilities which will shortly
exist for speedy communication both with
Newcastle and Sydney. The reader will ob-
srve that in this Itinerary for the Northern
Trunk Line the miles are measured from its
Terminus at Newcastle. Newcastle time is
observed at all Stations.
Newcastle Station, 2 feet above sea-
level.—Newcastle, the second City in New
South Wales, is situated on the southern bank
of the entrance to the Hunter River* (formerly
*The Valley of the Hunter —that extensive allu-
vial tract, traversed by the Hunter River—appears
to have been first explored about the year 1825.
The following deeply interesting account of its first
discovery (from the pen of Mr. G. T. Loder) recently
appeared in the columns of the Maitland Mercury.
known as the Coal River, or in aboriginal
parlance, “ Coonanbara ”), and is 75 miles
north of Sydney. Newcastle was settled
early in the history of the Colony, but
has rapidly advanced as a city and seaport
during the last few years. It is princi-
pally known as the port of a coal dis-
trict, unsurpassed in the Australian Colonies.
The port is at the mouth of the Hunter
River, and is the entrepot for the great trade,
mineral, pastoral, and agricultural, of the
Hunter and New England Districts. Large
sums of money have been expended by the
Government in improving the harbour and
Mr. G. T. Loder says : —“ The late Mr. John Howe,
of Morpeth, was the leader of the party who—
starting from Windsor overland —first discovered
the valley of the Hunter, then called ‘ Camilaroy. ’
His associates were the late Mr. Benjamin Single-
ton, a most enterprising man ; the late Mr. George
Loder (Mr. Howe’s son-in-law); the late Mr. Thomas
Dargin, two or three white men, and two black-
fellows as guides and interpreters. They did not
come over the Bulga the first time, but came down
Douglas Creek, above Jerry’s Plains, on to the
Hunter, and followed it downwards for a few miles.
On account of Mr. Howe’s health not being good,
and the blackfellows refusing to go any further, the
party returned to Windsor. Some time afterwards
Mr. Howe was leader of another party. His
associates were Mr. Singleton, Mr. George Loder,
Mr. Andrew Loder, and others, two or three
servants, and two blackfellows. Instead of keeping
their former track they left it at Howe’s Valley,
and came over the Bulga and on to the Hunter.
They followed the river downwards and reached the
level ground between Baroona and Neotsfield, on
St. Patrick’s Day—from which circumstance it was
called St. Patrick’s Plains. From there they
followed the river down as far as where West Mait-
land stands. On their return home a horse belong-
ing to one of the party, named Cock fighter, got
bogged in the creek not far from Wambo, hence the
name Cockfighter’s Creek. Three places on the
Bulga Road are called after Mr. Howe to this day—
Howe’s Valley, Howe’s Waterhole, and Howe’s
Mountain.


making it safe for shipping. The principal
Avork is the Southern Breakwater, which
extends 1,600 feet from the foot of Nobby’s
Head. Excellent wharfage accommodation
has also been provided for the great number
of ships that annually come to the port, and
on Bullock Island a number of powerful
hydraulic cranes, some of them capable of
lifting 25 tons, have been erected. The
engine-house, Avhich supplies the poAver for
the cranes, is fitted with the neAvest and most
approved machinery, and is well Avorth a visit.
The harbour fortifications on Allan’s Hill,
near the mouths of the port, are iioav com-
pleted. The plans are by Mr. G. A. Morell,
C.E., and approved of by Sir W. Jervois and
the late General Scratchley, C.E. The arma-
ment consists of three 9-inch muzzle-loading
rifle guns, Avith a casemated battery of rifled
80-pounders, the Avhole to be enclosed by a
ditch and palisading Avith the necessary loop-
holes for armament. The range of the guns
is so directed as to command any portion of
the coast to a distance of 2 \ miles from the
entrance to Nobby’s. They Avill also co\ r er the
lines of torpedoes which are intended (when
necessary) to be laid in a line from about the
parallel of the pilot boat-shed in a direct course
right across the harbour to Stockton, and in
such a manner that they can be fired instan-
taneously ; and should one line not ha\'e the
desired effect, another can be immediately
exploded. A carriage drive round the base
of the hill is in course of formation. The
city—Avhich is the seat of an Anglican
Bishopric—is, for the most part, substantially
built. The most remarkable buildings are
the Custom-house, the Post Office, the
Court-house, the School of Arts, the Banks,
the Churches (nine), the Hospital, the
Asylums, the Grammar School, the Market-
house, Borough Council’s neAv buildings,
Town Hall, and several Hotels, the principal
being -the “Great Northern,” “Terminus,”
“ Criterion,” and “ Ship” Inn. The Ter-
minus of the Great Northern Raihvay is
just opposite to the Custom-house, and within
a few feet of the harbour—an arrangement
possessing many advantages. Proclaimed a
municipality in 1859. Ratable property,
valued at £326,000 ; Avith 16 miles of roads
and streets. Communication daily by steam-
ers and ships Avith Sydney, and by Railway
with the interior. There are two daily papers.
Newcastle is lighted with gas, and arrange-
ments are being made to give Newcastle a
never - failing water supply. Newcastle
possesses some good recreation grounds, and
many social associations. It is essentially a
business city, and as the district is one of
immense resources, and the port has a direct
import and export trade with foreign places,
Newcastle will maintain and increase its in-
fluence and importance. Indeed, the progress
which the former city has made of late years
is unprecedented, or at all events in Colonial
annals. Twenty years ago the export of coal
Avas only 131,203 tons ; last year, 1885, it Avas
1,359,505 tons. In 1861 the value of imports
Avas but £35,932, but in 1883 it had reached
£658,601, and the exports Avere valued at
£1,438,172. During this lapse of time the
annual tonnage outwards had increased from
128,257 to 737,772. The value of avool
exported last year was £663,832. UpAvai'ds
of £700,000 has been laid out upon break-
Avaters, cranes, Avharfs, &c., including the
famous hydraulic machinery at Bullock Is-
land. These hydraulics are capable of raising
from 15 to 25 tons, and are often employed
day and night, in addition to other steam
cranes on the Queen’s Wharf, in the shipment
of coal. The average output of coal is 30,000
tons Aveekly, and there is every probability of
this rapidly increasing. The financial position
of the Municipality of Newcastle is also
highly satisfactory. At the last valuation
the municipality household property was
valued at £112,284 18s. ; landed property,
£197,218 14s. ; total, £309,503 12s. The
revenue is as follows; General rate, Is. in £,
£5,550 19s. ; gas rate, 3d. in £, £1,387 ;
Avater rate, 3d. in £, £290 ; market property,
estimated revenue, £5,200; total, £12,427
19s. Registered electors, 1884-85; Electoral
district of Newcastle, 3,538 voters ; electoral
district of Northumberland, 3,800 voters;
total, 7,282. Population, as per Census,
June, 1881, 31,000.
Stockton. —The village of Stockton is
situate about 1 mile from Newcastle, on the
northern side of the harbour, and conse-
quently has no connection Avith this line.
The population is now about 1,000. During
the past years the locality has increased in


commercial importance and population, by
reason of the valuable industries that have
been developed there. Principal among these
must be ranked the Patent Slip and Ship-
building Yards of Messrs. T. O’Sullivan & Co.,
whose establishment is as extensive as any in
the Colonies. Here ships of the largest ton-
nage trading to these waters can be thoroughly
overhauled and repaired. But even these
works are being eclipsed by the Stockton
Coal Company, recently formed. For a long
time past it has been known that under the
whole peninsula lie vast coal-seams. This
fact has been fully corroborated by the dia-
mond drill, and the company have put down
a shaft from which several hundred tons of
magnificent coal has already been raised.
Honeysuckle Point Station, 1 mile
from Newcastle ; 2 feet above sea-level.
—Leaving Newcastle, a perfect network of
sidings is passed until after a journey of 1
mile Honeysuckle Point is reached. Here
the Government workshops are located, some
of the buildings being the largest and finest
o o o
out of Sydney, with first-class machinery, and
a large staff of hands capable of executing
almost any work required to locomotives or
rolling-stock.
Hamilton Platform, 2 miles ; 3 feet
above sea-level. —Hamilton is a thriving,
well laid out suburban (mining) township, 2
miles west-north-Avestfrom Newcastle. Popu-
lation, 3,500. Churches, Post Office, Council
Chambers, stores, and a Mechanics’ Institute.
Proclaimed a municipality in 1871, and has
ratable property val ued at £325,224. Between
Hamilton and Honeysuckle Point lies the
municipality of Wickham, an important in-
dustrial centre with a population of 2,400
persons. Here is Hudson Brothers large Bail-
way Bolling Stock manufactory, also copper-
smelting works, sawmill, soap factory, and
two splendid collieries. It has eleven hotels,
churches, good stores, and a handsome School
of Arts, and is the nearest and most im-
portant suburb to the city. The branch
Bailway to Bullock Island and the hydraulic
cranes passes through the town, and carries
the bulk of the coal shipped.
Waratah Station, 4 miles; 13 feet
above sea-level. — An important mining
township, west-north-west of Newcastle, with
a population of 1,600 souls. Proclaimed a
municipality in 1871. Batable property,
£128,597. The Waratah coal mines are
situated at Baspberry Gully, and there is an
important copper-smelting works, and in the
vicinity are some good vineyards, gardens,
and recreation reserve. Waratah is the centre
Station of an important district, and from
the rapid development, and number of hand-
some residences, together with the erection
of premises for the Sydney Soap Company,
at a cost of £40,000, it is becoming an
important and fashionable suburb. To the
north-west is Wallsend and Plattsburg,
the chief mining townships in the district,
connected with the Northern line by a
branch private Bail way. The population of
Wallsend is 3,720 ; of Plattsburg is 3,300.
Hei’e are branch Banks, Churches, numerous
hotels and stores, and two splendid Schools of
Arts. West of the Station are the mining
townships of New Lambton and Lambton.
The latter has a population of about 3,765,
and derives its importance from the Lambton
Coal Colliery. Lambton is a municipality,
with ratable property valued at £164,968.
There ai'e maxxy good buildings and halls ixx
the township. Coxxnected with the line at
Waratah is the braxxch to Poi't Waratah on
the Hunter, where coal is shipped and a
copper-smelting works has beexx established.
Sandgate Platform, 7 miles; 2 feet
above sea-level. —A short braxxch or siding
leads into the Newcastle Cemetery lixxe,
whereby funeral trains are exxabled to await
and return persons attending burials.
Hexham Station, 10 miles; 2 feet
above sea-level. —For some distaxxce after
leaving Wax’atah the line passes through
some pi’ettily timbex’ed country, axxd then
enters oxx the well-known Hexham Swamps,
box’dex’ing the Hunter Biver. Hexham is a
small village, with a popxxlation of about 200.
Near Hexham is Minmi, a mining township
with a population of 1,400. The- coal from
mines Ixere is shipped on the Hunter at
Hexham.
Tarra Platform, 12 miles; 2 feet
above sea-level, —Besidents of Hexham


township make use of this platform, and a
large amount of the Newcastle milk supply
and produce is hooked here.
Woodford Platform, 14 miles ; 32 feet
above sea-level. —Woodford is sparsely
populated, hut to the west of the line is the
Woodford (Alnwick) Colliery, A large
proportion of the colliery timber, props, &c.,
used in the Newcastle district is cut in this
district.
Victoria-street Platform, 17 miles;
34 feet above sea-level. —This is a platform
for the use of residents in the southern and
eastern portions of East Maitland, and is also
a convenience for several whose profession
and business require attendance in N ewcastle.
East Maitland, 18 miles ; 34 feet above
sea-level. —About 1 mile after leaving Vic-
# o
tona-street the Railway Station at East
Maitland is reached. This is a junction, the
branch line to Morpeth connecting with the
Great Northern Railway at this spot. East
Maitland is well laid out, and is separated
from West Maitland by Wallis Creek, which
flows into the Hunter. To the east of the
line near the Station, and occupying a very
commanding position, is the Maitland Gaol,
one of the largest of such establishments out
of Sydney. District and Circuit Courts for
the Hunter District are held here twice a
year. The town is incorporated, and has a
population of 2,400 souls. In the principal
streets tree-planting has been carried on,
which gives the town a pleasant appearance.
East Maitland possesses a number of creditable
buildings, five Churches, Post and Telegraph
Office, Mechanics’ Institute, a large Bank
and Store, Public School, &c. East Maitland
is not a large business centre, but is more
exclusively filled by private residences.
West Maitland, 20 miles; 18 feet above
sea-level. —Leaving East Maitland a number
of well-cultivated fields are seen, and the
traveller obtains a view of the Hunter run-
ning near the line. 1 mile from East Mait-
land the train draws up at High-street, which
is simply a passenger station for the con-
venience of persons having occasion to travel
to and from the eastern portion of the town.
A little distance further on is the principal
Station, a handsome new building, for pas-
senger and goods traffic generally. Maitland
is the centre of an important district, the
extent and richness of which cannot be esti-
mated by the mere transitory view that is
obtained from the train as it passes through
the town. A writer referring to this matter
says : —“ Pamiliar as those accustomed to
travel along the Great Northern Railway
may be with evidences of the prosperity
which exists from Newcastle to Tamworth,
the knowledge of this that is gained by
mere Railway travelling is very little indeed
compared with what is gathered by leaving
the Railway line and traversing the country
through the various towns and settlements,
for then the active and well-to-do character
of everything and everybody is apparent in
all its fullness and all its force. To view
Maitland, for instance, from High-street or
Elgin-street Station, is but to see a very
small proportion of a very large city and a
very flourishing and populous district, but
leave the train and drive through the rich
agricultural suburbs which lie adjacent to
Maitland, and there is a tenfold aspect of
town and country life. West Maitland in
one direction, East Maitland in another,
Morpeth in a third, Hinton in a fourth,
Largs in a fifth, and between them farms or
grazing paddocks brilliant with young or
ripening crops or plentifully stocked with
cattle.” The principal street in Maitland is
High-street, about 1 mile in length, and con-
taining a large number of business houses
which do a large trade, not only locally but
with the whole of the northern district. The
town is somewhat irregular, being formed
along the banks of the Hunter, which has on
several occasions overflowed its banks and
caused considerable loss. Maitland is a
municipality with ratable property valued
at .£568,234, and a population (1884) of
5,800 souls. It possesses numerous fine
buildings, including a Masonic Hall, Post
Office, Hospital, large stores and hotels, and
many churches. The town is lighted with
gas. Some splendid drives may be taken
from Maitland, particularly through East
Maitland and around by Morpeth, through
Hinton and Dunmore, or to the Paterson, a
tributary flowing into the Hunter near




Singleton Bridge.


Morpeth, The scenery along the banks of
this river and in the vicinity is extremely
pretty. The soil of the district around Mait-
land is very fertile, and no more pleasant
sight is to be seen anywhere than that
obtained from some of the hills overlooking
Maitland, with the flats bordering the Hunter
green with rich and extensive fields of lucerne
and maize.
Farley Station, 22 miles; 44 feet above
sea-level. —This is a station 2 miles west of
West Maitland, placed where the Wollombi
Road joins on to the Northern line of Rail-
way. Between Maitland and this station
a considerable extent of land is seen under
cultivation, and a good deal of produce is sent
from this station.
Lochinvar Station, 26 miles ; 210 feet
above sea-level. —Lochinvar is 6 miles from
Maitland, in a pastoral and agricultural dis-
trict. A good number of vineyards are in
the vicinity, including the “Kaloudah.”
Between the Wollombi Road and Lochinvar
Stations there is a considerable rise in the
line, not less than 166 feet. Two churches
(Anglican and Roman Catholic) and a Public
School, one hotel, “ The Red Lion.”
Allandale Platform, 28 miles ; 200 feet
above sea-level. —Soon after the line leaves
the Lochinvar Station it takes a turn to the
north-west, and (allowing for sinuosities)
maintains that direction generally as far as
Singleton. Allandale is a platform 8 miles
from Maitland, and is also part of the wine
growing district,
Greta Station, 32 miles ; about 150
feet above sea-level. —The two well-known
coalmines “Greta” and “ Anvil Creek” are
situated here, but are somewhat handicapped
on account of their distance from the sea-
board ; but the coal being of an entirely
different character from the Newcastle, and
adapted for special purposes, is much sought
after. In addition to mining, agriculture
and the cultivation of the vine is also carried
on. There are several good stores here, four
Hotels, Public School, &c. About 1 mile
from the station from a hill-top a magnifi-
cent view of the Hunter Valley is obtained,
its many farms and vineyards with the
winding river presenting an unequalled view.
Branxton Station, 35 miles ; 136 feet
above sea-level. —Branxton is in the centre
of an agricultural district. Population, 1,200
souls. 3 miles distant from the Hunter
River. Churches, a School of Arts, and a
Public School. There are some large vine-
yards here producing excellent wine, and in-
cluding the well-known “ Kirkton” and
“ Dalwood.” Pour of the principal roads of
the Maitland District converge at Branxton.
Belford Platform, 39 miles; 169 feet
above sea-level. —After passing the Belford
Platform the line turns first to the south-
west and then to the north-west. The dis-
trict may be classed as pastoral, agricultural,
and also dairy farming.
Whittingham Platform, 46 miles; 117
feet above sea-level. —The Whittingham
Platform (late Faulkner’s) is 3 miles south-
east of Singleton, and is close to the fine
country seats (Baroona), the residence of
A. A. Dangar, Esq.; Neotsfield, owned by
W. J. Dangar; and Minnimbar, Mr. D.
F. Mackay’s splendid residence and estate.
Singleton Station, 49 miles; 136 feet
above sea-level. —Singleton is approached
through some extensive well-grassed plains
belonging to the Dangar family and others,
whose palatial residences are seen some little
distance out of Singleton, among them
Baroona and Neotsfield. Singleton is the
chief town of the Patrick’s Plains District,
so called on account of its being discovered
on the day devoted to Ireland’s patron saint.
Singleton is the centre of a district of varied
resources, agricultural, pastoral, and mineral.
The wool and stock of the district have long
been well known, and the soil along the
Hunter is very fertile and suitable for the
growth of grain. Heavy crops of wheat are
obtained, but unfortunately the harvest can-
not always be depended upon, as rust some-
times attacks the crops. Large yields of
barley are obtained, reaching 60 bushels to
the acre, and this grain is becoming exten-
sively grown. The farmers are now, however,
paying more attention to the growth of


tobacco, which is found to thrive here exceed-
ingly well, and to pay handsome returns.
Perhaps the Hunter valley is known best by
its vineyards; and here two of the most
celebrated (Greenwood and Bebeah, the pro-
perty of Mr. Alex. Munro) are situated.
Mr. Munro’s wines have received general and
well-merited recognition, having taken over
100 prizesat Colonial Exhibitions, and a grand
prize at the Paris Exhibition against the
world. A writer, referring to the cultivation
of the vine on the valley of the Hunter, says,—
“ Of all the industries existing in the Hunter
District, none is more extensive or more
important than that of vine-growing and the
making of wine. The land is admirably
adapted for it, and the vineyards are nume-
rous, and in many instances large and choice.
As for the wine, the excellence of much of it
has long been known to Australians; and if
the opportunity afforded by the honors
awarded to samples of Hunter River vintages
at the late Paris Exhibition were taken
advantage of, for the introduction of Aus-
tralian wine into England upon a much
larger scale than hitherto, its excellence
might soon be as well known to people of the
old country. Many persons, and more par-
ticularly some who have recently arrived
from Eui’ope, and whose close acquaintance
with the European wine trade cannot be
doubted, see not far distant the commence-
ment of a great future for the wine industry
of Australia. The vineyards of Europe are
old, and the soil is said to be fast becoming
exhausted, and, moreover, the ravages of the
phylloxera and other scourges are making
havoc among the vines. But the vineyards
of Australia are young, and, with the excep-
tion of the oidium, free from disease; and
when the European supply of wine becomes
insufficient for the demand on the Continent
and in England, Australian wines will meet
the deficiency, and their merits be properly
appreciated.” Singleton has good mineral
resources; coal of excellent quality being
found in abundance, and a considerable quan-
tity is used locally, or sent aw T ay for use at
townships further north, and supplied to the
Railway locomotives. Copper ore, iron ore,
and limestone are also obtained here. Single-
ton was incorporated in 1866, and in 1884
contained 2,500 inhabitants. It has 11|
miles of streets, and through the enterprise
of Mr. Alex. Munro is lighted with gas.
The streets are well kept, and planted with
graceful shade trees. The principal buildings
are the Hospital, Mechanics’ Institute, Court-
house, Oddfellows’ Hall, three banks, various
churches, and some good business houses.
There are twelve hotels here, the principal
being the “Caledonian,” “Royal,” and “Com-
■ mercial.” There are a number of manufacto-
ries at work; and here annually an Exhibition
is held, which attracts thousands of visitors.
Some splendid timber is got in the district;
at St. Clare in particular there are forests of
cedar, ironbark, blue, red, and flooded gum,
box, &c. Here Mount Royal is situated, so
called from the proportions of thousands of
the forest giants growing upon and about it.
The principal settlements near Singleton are
Jerry’s Plains, Warkworth, Broke, Glendon,
Goorangoola, Scott’s Elat, New Freugh,
Darlington, Belford, Bulgoa, and St. Clair.
Travellers will do well to remember that
there is an excellent refreshment room at
Singleton, and time is allowed for meals.
Glennie’s Creek Platform, 58 miles;
245 feet above sea-level. —After leaving
Singleton the line tends north-west, and some
of the steepest gradients, 1 in 33 for some
distance, have to be surmounted. In conse-
quence trains from Newcastle have to be
divided at Singleton, and lighter loads sent
onward.
Ravensworth Station, 62 miles; 245
feet above sea-level.-— Ravensworth is in
the centre of an agricultural and pastoral
district. The country round about is level
and well watered, and the soil fertile.
Ravensworth possesses two Churches, Public
School, and Post and Telegraph Office.
Liddell Platform, 65 miles; 250 feet
above sea-level. —A platform on the Great
Northern Railway, 3 miles from the Ravens-
worth and 10 miles from the Grass-tree
stopping-places.
Grass-tree Platform, 75 miles ; 579
feet above sea-level. —A settlement with a
platform on the Great Northern Railway, 10
miles from Liddell and 5 miles from Muscle-
brook,


Musclebrook (or Muswellbrook) Sta-
tion, 80 miles ; 475 feet above sea-level.
Musclebrook—on the Muscle Creek and the
Hunter River—is a town containing (in
1884) 1,074 inhabitants, and possessing a
local Hospital, School of Arts, two Churches
(Anglican and Presbyterian), flour-mill, and
six hotels. Musclebrook is the centre of an
important and large agricultural and pastoral
area. During 1884, 4,025 bales of wool were
received at this station for transmission from
some large sheep runs in the district. Goods
are received here for Cassilis, Merriwa, and
Denman, all townships of note. The soil is
rich, and in favorable seasons good crops of
wheat, maize, and hay are gathered.
Aberdeen Station, 87 miles ; 610 feet
above sea-level. —Aberdeen is a small town-
ship on the Great Northern Railway, between
Musclebrook and Scone. Population, 200
souls. Anglican and Presbyterian Church,
and Public School. Good agricultural land,
but mainly a pastoral district.
Scone Station, 96 miles; 680 feet above
sea-level. —Between Aberdeen and Scone
the appearance of the country is pleasant
Shortly before reaching Scone the line
passes through splendid-looking country,
cleared and well grassed. 9 miles from
Aberdeen Scone is reached. It is pleasantly
situated on the margin of the Kingdon Ponds,
7 miles west of Page River, and 7 miles north-
west of the Hunter River. There are Anglican,
Roman Catholic, and Presbyterian Churches ;
a School of Arts, a Public School, flour-mill,
Court-house, police barracks, and numbers of
hotels and stores. The population is 600
souls. Agriculture is carried on to some
extent in the vicinity, farmers combining
grazing with agriculture, and there are also
some large sheep stations in the district. The
principal places in the vicinity are Moonan
Brook, Denison diggings, Gundy, and Park.
In the neighbourhood of Scone are several
fine freehold estates of considerable extent,
generally used for pastoral purposes. Among
the finest of these is Turanville, the property
of Thomas Cook, Esq. It is situated about 4
miles south of Scone, extends on both sides
of the railway line for a considerable distance,
and consists of upwards of 10,000 acres of
splendid land. The residence is situated
about half a mile from the line, on the brow
of a gentle slope. At the rear is an extensive
natural shrubbery, preserved with great care
by Mr. Cook, and some distance behind this
rises a spur from the Liverpool Range, To
the front of the residence stretches a splendid
extent of beautifully undulating country,
through which at some little distance winds
a never-failing stream—a continuation of
that known in Scone as the “ Kingdon
Ponds,” and which shortly after finds its way
into the Upper Hunter, The banks of this
stream are here and there dotted with trees
—principally acacias and willows—and the
surface of the water is in places covered with
water-lilies; and, as the water is beautifully
clear, its presence adds greatly to the pic-
turesque as well as utilitarian character of the
property. Mr. Cook has greatly improved the
many natural resources of the land, preserving
the native trees in picturesque groups, and
planting others where these were wanting.
The land used for pastoral purposes is
partitioned off' into paddocks of various sizes,
and as the conservation of feed is thus secured
its carrying capacities are largely increased.
The grounds attached to the house are
beautifully laid out, and the parterres of
choice flowers, amongst which statuary is
judiciously placed, the numbers of fruit and
ornamental trees, vines, &c., are very pleasing
results of the excellent taste and judgment
displayed by the fortunate possessor of this
very beautiful property.
Excursion to the Flat Rock. —At the
distance of about 6 miles from Scone, out
amongst the mountains, is a wild and pictu-
resque spot known as the Flat Rock, which
is spoken of by a recent tourist as well
deserving of a visit. This lady tourist (an
accomplished writer, whose description of the
glen of the Flat Rock has been published to
the world in the Maitland Mercury under
the nom de plume of “ Gipsy”) says : —Our
way became tortuous and rugged, and to
avoid too much climbing we kept in the bed
of what has been—and will be again some
day when there is rain enough —a creek.
After walking in this for some distance the
glen took an abrupt turn, and we suddenly
came upon what seemed to me an enchanted


region. As far as natural scenery is con-
cerned, it was one of the grandest sights
I ever saw in my life. The sides of the
glen rose to the height of several hundred
feet, in some places sloping and in others
abrupt, but everywhere covered with the
most luxuriant vegetation. What seemed
to me a most remarkable thing was that
the vegetation on either side had its dis-
tinctive characteristics, and even the rocks
appeared of a different nature and forma-
tion. On one side could be seen the Moreton
Bay fig-tree, with its glossy leaves, the Sting-
ing Tree with its graceful foliage, and the
Acacia—besides several other beautiful trees,
for which I could find no name, some of
them having long slender stems crowned at
the top with a tuft of foliage, and looking at
a distance much like palms. Intertwined
among these were several kinds of creepers,
forming numbers of the most beautiful
natural arbours one could imagine. In the
undergrowth I noticed a species of holly,
very like the English variety, and an elder-
bush with the berries nearly ripe. Among
all this luxuriance the rocks were tumbled
about in ‘ most admired disorder,’ assuming
all sorts of fantastic shapes, and covered
with mosses, ferns, rock lilies, and cacti;
while on the other side of the glen the
iron-bark and the tea-tree reigned supreme,
forming with their sombre foliage, a com-
plete contrast to the vivid green of the
opposite side, and thereby adding greatly to
the effect. At our left the ravine had
widened, the surface being composed of smooth
flat rock several yards in dimensions, which
forms the lunching place for sight-seers, and
has suggested its rather unromantic name.
The whole view formed a picture to go into
raptures over, and once seen never to be
forgotten.” The writer of this lively descrip-
tion of a lovely spot named it the Fairy Dell,
by which it will probably henceforth be
known. The rocks in the neighbourhood
assume quaint fantastic shapes ; and amongst
them there are pinnacles known as “ Moses ”
and “Aaron,” and a tall white one whim-
sically distinguished as “ Lot’s Wife,”
Park Platform, 101 miles; 720 feet
above sea-level. —Park is a platform on the
Great Northern Railway, 5 miles from Scone.
Wingen Platform, 106 miles; 1,002
feet above sea-level.— There is a platform
on the Northern Railway near the Burning
Mountain, known as Mount Wingen, 10
miles from Scone and 14 from Murrurundi.
Mount Wingen is 1,820 feet high. A writer
speaking of Mount Wingen says—“ Mount
Wingen, the only active volcano on the
Australian continent, stands just below the
elbow formed by the first westerly course
taken by the range after running south from
the borders of the adjoining Colony of Queens-
land. The burning mountain is of course a
great source of interest and wonder to the
people and a constant attraction to sightseers.
All the year long volumes of smoke issue
from the sides and top of the mountain, and
the fumes descending, make a desert in the
midst of a bright and beautiful country.
From the geological formation and other
indications, it is evident that the mountain is
permeated with a seam of coal in course of
slow combustion, and at a considerable dis-
tance from the surface.
A writer, in “a trip to Mount Wingen,”
says : —“ Leaving Scone, we went by the
evening train to the little township of
Wingen, where we were fortunate in getting
comfortably housed for the night.
“ Early next morning preparations were
made for our ride to Mount Wingen, and at
about 10 o’clock we started. A short canter
brought us to very hilly country, over which
we made our way, generally in single file, now
skirting a spur of the Liverpool Range, and
again along the tortuous course of a ravine,
with only here and there the semblance of a
cattle track in the shape of road. Our guide
had, however, been over ‘ every inch of the
country for many a mile round,’ so we were
in some degree independent of roads, A
firm seat in the saddle, and coolness in
guiding our steeds, where a single false step
might prove disastrous, were matters of
necessity. But with all its drawbacks for
the inexperienced of our party—and these
formed the majority—the ride was both
pleasant and exhilarating.
“ Glimpses of the continuation of the
northern line were occasionally obtained from
the crest of a hill, and now and again a
pretty view of a settler’s clearing and home-
stead would suddenly present itself, while in


the distance the high ranges of the Liver-
pool mountains were distinctly outlined
against the sky. The country, as far as
we could see, was fairly but not thickly
timbered, well grassed, but almost destitute
of undergrowth. The trees were almost
confined to the eucalyptus family—box and
white gum prevailing.
“ After an hour or two of steady riding we
found ourselves ascending the sloping side of
a higher mountain than any we had yet
crossed. In a depression near the top we
dismounted, and, after fastening the horses
by the bridles to some trees, we continued
the ascent on foot. As yet we saw no fire,
though a light haze of smoke floated round the
crest of the mountain, and a strong odour of
burning sulphur saluted our olfactory nerves.
On reaching the summit we saw smoke issuing
from about a dozen different cavities, but no
flames could be seen even on a close approach.
On looking into some of the larger chasms,
however, they presented the appearance of a
glowing furnace. The ground under our
feet felt quite hot in places, and all along the
brow of the mountain for some hundreds of
yards great transverse rents or chasms were
to be seen, some of which seemed made quite
recently, while others appeared of long
standing.
“Ho trace of volcanic agency was apparent,
the fire simply proceeding from a vast bed of
coal, which had become ignited, and as it
became consumed creating large cavities, into
which the surface fell. What length of time
has elapsed since Mount Wingen first became
a burning mountain is not known, but it is
believed to have been in a state of ignition
prior to the advent of the white man—
certainly so before his settlement in that part
of Hew South Wales. Ho doubt, some day
a scientist will come along who will make a
calculation on the basis of the amount of
consumption per day, and so reduce the
mystery to a very simple arithmetical ques-
tion, to be worked out by the ‘ rule of
three.'
“The course over which the fire has
travelled in times past can be distinctly traced
along the brow of the mountain for upwards
of a quarter of a mile, though the fire in the
initial part of its course has long become
extinct.
“ The surface of the ground in close
proximity to the fire was covered in places
with a substance resembling yellow frost, but
which upon examination proved to be a com-
pound in which sulphur was the basis. One
of our party took up a piece of the calcined
earth crusted with it and applied a lighted
match to it. It at once caught fire, burning
with a bluish flame and emiting a pungent
odour; but instead of being consumed it
turned into a fluid state, the colour being
dark amber.
“Another of our party took up the dried
branch of a tree and thrust it into one of the
glowing fissures, when it caught alight and
burned furiously.
“Some of the transverse chasms extended
downwards on one side into a ravine, though
there were no indications that the fire under-
neath extended so far. One of the largest of
these was made in the rock—a species of trap
—the upper side of which hung over like a
leaning wall.
“ On the lower side of this last, which was
shaded from the sun, we sat down to lunch,
with the very best of appetites, after which
some of our party descended by a slanting path-
way and inscribed our names on the rocky wall.
“Though presenting a certain weird and
somewhat picturesque appearance, Mount
Wingen would most probably prove rather
disappointing to those in search of the
wonderful, and there is nothing whatever
about it suggestive of a volcano. However
a visit to it simply as a burning mountain
cannot be otherwise than interesting, and the
view of the surrounding country to be
obtained from its summit is in itself worth
the trouble entailed in gaining it.
“To the north-west some of the highest
summits of the Liverpool Range canbe seen, the
most prominent—from its proximity—being
Murrila, or ‘ Murlow’ as it is locally named.
“ Spurs from the main range (of which
Mount Wingen itself is one) stretch in all
directions, while amongst them glimpses of
valleys occasionally catch the eye.
“ On coming back we took a shorter but
somewhat rougher way, and reached Wingen
in time to catch the rekirn train to Scone.”
Blandford Platform, 115 miles ; 1,382
feet above sea-level. —Blandford is a pas


toral and agricultural settlement on the Page
River and Warland’s Creek, about 3 miles
south of the town of Murrurundi. There is
a platform on the Railway here. The highest
mountain in the district—Mount Murrulla—
is 3 miles west-south-west of Blandford.
Murrurundi Station, 120 miles ; 1,546
feet above sea-level. —Up to Murrurundi
Station the line has been running through a
valley extensive at starting but gradually
hemmed in by the mountain ranges until the
line comes to Murrurundi, where the head of
the valley is reached, and the mountains
stand as if barring the further progress of
the traveller into the fertile regions of the
Liverpool Plains and New England. Mur-
rurundi is beautifully situated at the foot of
the Liverpool Range, which contain peaks
towering up from 2,000 to 4,000 feet in height.
Mount Murrulla, the highest district point
in the Liverpool Range is situated above 3
miles from the Railway Station, from the
top of which a splendid view is obtained.
On ordinary days without the aid of glasses
the spectator, as he stands upon the summit,
distinctly sees the towns of Musclebrook,
Aberdeen, Scone, Wingen, Blandford, and
Murrurundi, and all the surrounding country
for many miles. On the mountains adjoining
may be found the largest tree fern, a great
variety of fern being found in all the valleys
and mountains adjacent to the town. To the
north-east of Murrurundi, beyond the moun-
tain, is located large deposits of kerosene shale,
to work which some time ago an influential
Company was formed, and a considerable
amount of tunnelling completed, A large
quantity of shaleof the first quality is stored at
the mine but from the great expense attendant
upon the haulage of same to the Railway depot,
the company have for the present suspended
operations. Situated at “ The Iris,” 17 miles
from Murrurundi, are considerable silver
mines, which were working some years back,
but on account of the heavy cost of sending
ores to Newcastle for the extraction and
treatment of the silver, operations were
suspended until the early part of the present
year, when by the advent of three fresh com-
panies work has been vigorously resumed.
It is proposed to erect proper machinery on
the grounds and thus obviate the cause of
failure to which the first parties had to
succumb. At Boyd’s Creek, 2 miles north
of Murrurundi, Mr. James Seivl has a siding
at which he has erected a substantial slaughtei’-
house establishment, carcase beef in van
loads being daily sent for the supply of the
various large marketsalong theline. Regular
shipments being sent to Newcastle, Gunnedah,
Quirindi and the mining townships, the under-
taking was commenced in the early part of the
year and promises to assume some magnitude.
The river Page runs by the town, and as it
crosses from range to range on its way to
join the waters of the Hunter, it forms a
very pretty picture. The scenery in the neigh-
bourhood of the town is of a more varied
character than perhaps any other spot on the
Northern line until the Armidale district is
reached. To the right of the town—going
north—is a spot known as the “ Rocks,” from
which an extensive view of the surrounding
country can be obtained. It is reached after
a pleasant quarter of an hour’s walk. A
climb along a winding path amongst the
rocks then brings the tourist to the summit,
where he is more than rewarded for the
exertion of reaching it in the view that pre-
sents itself. In the quiet valley at his feet
nestles the town, through which the river
winds its silvery way, while in every direction
range after range of mountains extend till lost
in the distant horizon. Murrurundi contains a
population of 460soulsandhas a local Hospital,
a School of Arts, Churches for the four prin-
cipal denominations, Court-house, six Hotels,
and a Public School. The Murrurundi
Times is the local newspaper. Haydonton,
population 469, is regarded as a suburb of
Murrurundi, with which it is connected by
the Arnold Bridge, opened in 1864. The
industry principally followed in the district is
the pastoral, but it possesses mineral resources
in the shape of coal, shale, and copper. Places
near Murrurundi: Blackville, Timor (notice-
able for its caves), and Wallabadah,
Temple Court Platform, 121 miles ;
1,609 feet above sea-level. —A platform 1
mile from Murrurundi. At f of a mile from
Murrurundi, a cutting of 14,000 yards and
24 feet deep at its greatest depth begins ;
and | a mile further on, after passing various
small cuttings, there is one of some 10,000


yards. The view as the traveller ascends the
Liverpool Lange is striking and beautiful,
and worth going a long distance to see.
Below the traveller are the townships of
Murrurundi and Haydonton, and the valley
with the course of the Page marked through
it by a band of greener verdure, while stretch-
ing away until it is lost in the distance is the
Liverpool Range, its mountains clothed with
a thick growth of forest-trees.
Doughboy Hollow Platform, 126 miles;
2,070 feet above sea-level. —A platform 6
miles from Murrurundi. Passing Doughboy
Hollow Platform the line is carried throug \
several small cuttings, and after running up
gradients, varying from 1 in 40 to 1 in 50,
at miles from Murrurundi there is another
cutting of close upon 14,000 yards.
Willow-tree or Warrah Platform, 134
miles ; 1,438 feet above sea-level.—A
small settlement on the Great Northern
Railway, 14 miles from Murrurundi, and
situated on the borders of the extensive dis-
trict known as the Liverpool Plains. Willow-
tree is surrounded by the A. A. Co.’s well
known Warrah Estate. The district is
almost wholly a pastoral one. Goods are
received here for Nundle. There is one
hotel, the “Railway.”
Braefield Platform, 140 miles ; 1,275
feet above sea-level. —A platform on the
Great Northern Railway, 4 miles on the
Murrurundi side of Quirindi. Crossing the
Page River the ascent of the mountain range
to the Tunnel is commenced; and for a dis-
tance of 3| miles there is a continuous gradient
of 1 in 40, passing through some very heavy
cuttings and over some high embankments.
One of these cuttings—at a place 4 miles
from Murrurundi and before the Tunnel is
reached—is set down at between 80,000 and
90,000 yards, with a depth up to 51 feet.
Another cutting of 12,000 yards is met a
quarter of a mile further on ; and before the
Tunnel is entered a number of others—some
of hard rock—are passed ; showing on the
plans 12,000, 14,000, 15,000, and 18,000
yards. The cuttings were enlarged in some
places to provide sufficient stuff for the em-
bankments ; and in others to make the slopes
H
safe, and prevent, as far as could be done,
the blocking-up of the line by landslips.
The cutting where the Tunnel is entered is
very steep, and of very considerable depth.
The Railway here runs through a Tunnel 528
yards long, lined throughout with brickwork
and set with Portland cement. This is the
place where the Liverpool range is pierced
by the Railway. At the north end of the
Tunnel the summit of the range is reached ;
and as the train emerges from the Tunnel it
passes through a very deep cutting, of the
same nature as that on the Murrurundi side,
and one that has had to be considerably
increased to strengthen the soil on the slopes.
The line descends rapidly from the Liver-
pool Range on gradients of from 1 in 40 to
1 in 50 for nearly 44 miles, passing through
extensive cuttings, which in their construction
presented great difficulties to the contractor,
and over some heavy embankments. The
foot of the gradient is reached at a place
called Chilcott’s Creek, which is crossed by a
timber bridge of five 26-feet openings.
Within 2 miles of Quirindi only are there
any heavy cuttings and somewhat steep
gradients to be met. At that point two
heavy cuttings are situated, and the gradients
are 1 in 40 and 1 in 50. 8 miles south of
Quirindi the line crosses Collie Creek. After
leaving the gradients last-mentioned, the
Quirindi Creek is crossed by four 26-feet
timber openings.
Quirindi Station, 144 miles ; 1,328 feet
above sea-level. —Quirindi is a settlement
on the Quirindi Creek, 24 miles north of
Murrurundi. It is surrounded by good
agricultural land, and large quantities of
wheat are grown here, keeping two mills
fully employed. It is also the centre of a
large pastoral area, and sends away annually
large quantities of wool and live stock, 30,000
head of cattle being sent away during the
last quarter of 1882. Quirindi has a popu-
lation of 300 souls; four hotels, stores, &c.,
are situated here, and goods are received for
Coonabarabran, Wallabadab, Spring Ridge,
Yarraman, Bundella, Coolah, &c. The last
embankment before reaching Quirindi Station
is of great length, made up from side cuttings,
and containing over 20,000 yards. Quirindi
Station is then reached. Prom Quirindi


Station the Railway commences to ascend on
various gradients, the greatest of which is 1
in 66 for a distance of about 2 miles, passing
through several cuttings, and then descends
for a distance of about a mile and a half.
For a quarter of a mile it again ascends,
descending again for a mile and a half, and
then making a further ascent for a distance
of about 3 miles. Another descent for about
2 miles brings the Railway to the junction
with the Werris Creek and Gunnedah line.
Quipolly Platform, 150 miles ; about
1,300 feet above sea-level. —A platform 6
miles from Quirindi, and 5 miles from Werris
Creek Stations.
Werris Creek Station, 155 miles;
1,244 feet above sea-level. —Werris Creek
Station is 11 miles north of Quirindi, and
27 miles south of Tamworth. Werris Creek
is important principally as the junction of the
North-Western line; there are a few runs
in the vicinity, and some farmers growing
wheat. One hotel. Passing the Werris Creek
Creek Station another large cutting is now
met with. It has been made through hard
rock, and contains some 22,000 or 23,000
yards of stuff. Again the line ascends for
a short distance, and again descends on a
gradient of lin 40 for about a mile. Then
there is an ascent for a distance of between
4 and 5 miles on gradients varying from 1
in 40 to lin 80—1 in 50 being most frequent
—through several hard cuttings, some of
them representing as much as 20,000 yards
of stuff. When this point is reached the
line again descends, passing through small
cuttings for a distance of about 2 miles; and
thence into Timbumbera the line follows
the natural surface of the ground as near as
possible, and there, of course, few excava-
tions are required. Timbumbera Creek is
crossed by a timber bridge of four 26-feet
openings; and from this point to Tamworth
the intervening distance is about 11 miles.
From Murrurundi to Tamworth the rails
are single-headed, fish-jointed throughout,
weighing 70 lbs. to the yard, and secured to
the sleepers by spikes and screws alternately.
From Werris Creek (as already intimated)
the Branch line to Breeza and Gunnedah
begins. There are two timber bridges over
Werris Creek, each having five openings; one
bridge k. carry the Railway, and the other
for the road approach to the Railway Station.
It should be noted that there have recently
been established at Werris Creek handsome
and commodious refreshment-rooms, which
vie in their appearance and appointments
with the splendid rooms at Junee, on the
Southern Railway. Ample time is allowed
here by all trains for dining.
Currabubula Station, 164 miles ; 1,408
feet above sea-level.— Currabubula station
is 18 milesfrom Tamworth,onthe Murrurundi
side. Here are a couple of hotels, store, &c.
A considerable quantity of wheat is grown
in the district around the station. Through
Currabubula Station the line passes by a
30-chain curve, crossing the road to Goonoo
Goonoo at 165 miles ; then another 30-chain
curve brings it across Currabubula Creek,
where there is a timber bridge of three 26-
feet spans; thence round the base of the
Sugar-loaf Mountain, whence its direction
takes a north-easterly course and enters the
estate of the Peel River Company, and so
over Timbumbera Creek to Tamworth,
Tamworth Station, 182 miles ; 1,242
feet above sea-level. —Tamworth—one of
the most progressive townships in the northern
portion of this Colony—lies 182 miles north-
west of Newcastle, and 251 miles from
Sydney by the postal route, its least distance
from the coast being 116 miles. For some
time the station at Tamworth was situated
in the western portion of the town, this
station (West Tamworth) being from October,
1878, to January, 1882, the terminus of the
Northern line. A contract was let for a
further extension to Uralla, and in January,
1882, a section to Moonbi was opened.
After leaving West Tamworth the line runs
on a long timber viaduct f mile in length
over the flats bordering the river Peel. The
river itself is crossed by an iron cylinder
bridge. At 183 miles the Railway Station—
a handsome and commodious building—is
reached. Tamworth lies in a fertile valley,
near the confluence of the Cockburn River and
Peel, and is surrounded by a prosperous
grazing and agricultural community; large
quantities of wheat, the quality of which has


MacDonald River and Bridge


received general commendation at the principal
Exhibitions, being grown here. Tamworth
is the centre of an eastern portion of the
pastoral district of Liverpool Plains. It has
Churches for the four principal denomina-
tions, Mechanics’ Institute, a Temperance
Hall, a Public School, two Denominational
Schools, large stores, hotels, branch banks,
two breweries, three flour mills, two coach
factories, boot factory, and tannery. It is
a proclaimed municipality. An Agricultural
and Pastoral Association meeting is held here
periodically; and there is a flourishing
Jockey Club. The local papers are the
Tamworth News and the Tamworth Observer.
Population, 1884, 4,700 souls. The nearest
places are : Attunga, 10 miles north ; Goonoo
Goonoo, 15 miles south; Moonbi, 15 miles
north ; Manilla, 30 miles north-west; Car-
roll, 35 miles west; Bowling Alley Point, 28
miles south-east; Nundle (on the Liverpool
Range), 36 miles south; Hanging Rock, 43
miles south; and Barraba, 60 miles north.
The remaining places near Tamworth are
Bective, Bundella, Colly Blue, Dungowan,
Keepit, Pine Ridge, Quipolly, Tally-ho, Tarn-
bar Springs, Somerton. Gunnedah is 50
miles to the westward of Tamworth. A
considerable amount of pastoral produce is
annually dispatched from Tamworth, and there
are extensive sheep and cattle yards here.
Moonbi, 194 miles ; 1,381 feet above
sea-level. Leaving Tamworth, the line
follows for some miles the course of the Cock-
burn River, which flows into the Peel, near
Tamworth. The country bordering the line
is exceedingly picturesque, the mountains
covered with timber, sloping gracefully to the
valley, which is very fei'tile; and the traveller
is rapidly carried past green and rich fields
of wheat, oats, and maize. After leaving
Tamworth, and travelling northwards, the
scenery along the line is ever varied and
beautiful, partaking at times of the rugged
grandeur of the Western Mountains, at others
showing cultivated fields and fertile areas,
well grassed and covered with splendid timber.
The Railway Station at Moonbi is situated
about 2 \ miles from the old township of
Moonbi. Coaches leave here for Bendemeer.
Agricultural and pastoral industries are
followed in the district. Moonbi was the
Northern terminus from the 9th January to
2nd August, 1882. At this Station the line
leaves the plains and commences to climb
the Moonbi Range, the works on the extension
being some of the heaviest in the Colony.
Walcha Road, 222 miles, 3,386 feet
above sea-level. —After leaving Moonbi
signs of cultivation are still passed, but they
are not so general as before. At 197 miles
a dam, to afford a water supply for the
locomotives, has been constructed across the
creek near the line, which then continues
along the course of the Swamp Oak and
Jamaeson Creeks. The view here is both
wild and pretty. The line runs in a narrow
valley ; from the valley the mountains, dark
and bold, tower up hundreds of feet above
the line. At 202 miles a tunnel 165 yards
in length is passed through, and at 216| miles
a second tunnel occurs. From Moonbi to the
Macdonald River the train is climbing up for
the whole distance a steep gradient which runs
for miles 1 in 40. The cuttings are numerous
and heavy, the earthwork excavated from them
ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 cubic yards,
and the principal banks contain from 20,000
to 75,000 yards of earthwork each. At 217|
miles the line crosses the Macdonald River by
a massive, although light-looking, lattice iron
girder bridge with 150 feet spans, supported
on brick piers about 40 feet in height. The
country in the neighbourhood is very pictu-
resque ; the river lined with fine specimens
of oak, sweeping over rocky bars, and re-
sembling the mountain streams of America.
It is said a number of trout have been put
into the river and are thriving, so that at
no distant date the trout-fisher may have the
pleasure of angling for his favourite fish in
a climate and amid scenes that will recall
British experiences vividly to his memory.
At the Macdonald River water-tanks have
been set up for supplying the locomotives.
Travelling on to Walcha Road the line still
ascends, Walcha Station being at an elevation
of 3,386 feet above sea-level, which is within
a few feet of the height of Mount Victoria on
the Western line. The township of Walcha
—population about 200—is 12 miles away
on the Apsley River. It contains five
hotels, two flour-mills, three churches, School
of Arts, Court-house, &c. There are a


number of important sheep stations in the
district, from which a considerable quantity
of wool is annually forwarded ; and a number
of agriculturists, evidence of which is found
in the two Hour-mills at work in Walcha
town. As soon as the many natural beauties
and glorious scenes around Walcha are better
known, it will become a regular visiting-
place for tourists and invalids desiring a
bracing and pure climate. The residents of
Sydney wanting change of air, or desiring
to view mountain scenery, have the Blue
Mountains convenient to them; and now that
the Railway has penetrated the mountain
ranges and reached New England, the dwellers
in the northern lowland plains and cities
will be able to view scenery as pretty and
get air as salubrious and bracing as ever
obtained by their southern neighbours on the
Western Mountains. A splendid view is
obtained from the Walcha platform, situated
on the side of a mountain which rises to a
considerable height behind the station and
ends abruptly in a plateau almost destitute of
vegetation. About mile from the station
is a mountain known by the no means poetic
name of Crawford’s Nob. It rises abruptly,
its sides thickly timbered, but the summit is
bare, and consists of an irregular arrange-
ment of many thousands of basaltic columns.
A glorious view is obtained from the summit.
To the southward lie the grand chain of
mountains known as the Liverpool Range,
while rising like many islands are the heads
of mountain ranges which stretch as far as
the eye can see. In the spring-time the
mountain is gay with many flowering shrubs
which shed a sweet fragrance through the
pure air. Some distance from the station one
of the prettiest waterfalls in the Colony is
to be seen. The fall, situated on the river
Apsley, is about 700 feet deep. The visitor
can pass under this fall and see the seething
water as it dashes over the rocky ledge above
into the rocky watercourse at the foot of the
fall. Splendid timber, including cedar, is ob-
tained in the district, large numbers of sleepers
also being got here for the Railway. Mining
is carried on in the district, the Glen Morri-
son reefs being situated about 16 miles from
the station, and there are also good indica-
tions of gold not far distant from the Railway
Station.
Kentucky, 236 miles ; 3,475 feet above
sea-level. —After leaving Walcha Road the
line still continues to ascend until at 2311-
miles the highest point (3,642 feet) on the
extension to Uralla is attained; this is within
a few feet of the highest point on the Western
line, viz., 3,658 feet. From this to Kentucky
there is a slight descent, and a number of cut-
tings, principally of earthwork, are passed
through. The country bordering the line is
diversified and pretty. Kentucky is a station
of small importance, but there are a few large
sheep stations in the vicinity, viz., Kentucky,
Terrible Yale, and Rimbanda ; there is also a
fair timber and agricultural traffic here.
Uralla, 245 miles; 3,335 feet above sea-
lev el. —From Kentucky to Uralla the country
is uninteresting, and devoted chiefly to pastoral
purposes. The Railway Station is an attrac-
tive brick structure, provided with extensive
station arrangements. Uralla is an incor-
porated town, and had in 1884 a population
of 400 souls. It possesses a number of hotels
—principal, “Royal,” “Uralla,” “Great
Northern,” —and “Court-house,” Post and
Telegraph Office, four Churches, Banks, stores,
and a new Court-house is to be erected. The
soil around Uralla is in places very fertile, and
well adapted for the growth of cereals and
fruit. In the district are some important
sheep stations, Gostwyck (6 miles) being
one of the largest and best managed in New
England, 3 miles from Uralla is the once
famous Rocky River Gold-field, which in
days gone by yielded handsome returns to the
thousands of diggers who were at work there.
The ground is still worked, two Companies,
the Bullion and Long Tunnel, carrying on
operations here. The tunnel driven into the
mountain by the latter Company is a remark-
able piece of work, some 2,000 feet in
length.
Armidale, 260 miles ; 3,313 feet above
sea-level. —There is only a difference of 22
feet between the height of Armidale and
Uralla, and the line between the two places
is comparatively speaking level; the smallest
curve is of 30 chains radius. The railway
runs at some little distance from the main
centre of the city ; the station buildings are
extensive, built in view of the large traffic that


is and will be transacted here. The station
is one of the most attractive and commodious
on the Northern line. Armidale is the seat of
an Anglican and Roman Catholic Bishopric,
and contains two handsome cathedrals. A
splendid view of the city and surroundings is
obtained from a hill near the gaol, or from an
elevated site in the racecourse. The view is
an extremely pretty one, the dull outlines of
the buildings being relieved by the green
foliage of the trees which have been plenti-
fully planted throughout the city. Adjoin-
ing the city are many farms, and on the
mountain sides patches of green fields and
orchards are seen. Fruit-growing should
become a profitable industry here, the soil
and climate being well adapted for the
growth of many fruits. 4 miles out is pro-
bably the largest orchard in the colony, 90 acres
of land being planted with fruit trees, princi-
pally cherry and pear. The manufacturing
industries are not numerous; at present
there are at work a few tanneries, four flour
mills, brewery, &c., but no doubt the difficulty
of transit that has long existed, but which
has now been removed, has had the effect of
retarding industrial operations. Armidale is
a municipality, and had a population in 1884
of 2,000. A handsome Town-hall is in course
of erection, to seat 800 people. Armidale
from its elevated situation possesses a pure,
bracing, and cool climate, and no doubt many
will be attracted here for change of air during
the summer months. The New England
district is one of extreme beauty and fer-
tility ; in it lies hidden great mineral wealth,
principally tin and gold ; its grasses support
immense flocks of sheep, and from its soil
crops of grain and fruit to supply the wants
of the Colony could be raised. Into this
splendid district the Railway has penetrated,
and its great resources will now receive full
development.
Eversleigh Station, 266 miles; 3,490
feet above sea-level. —ls in the centre of
an agricultural district, with a population of
300. The place boasts of two Public Schools
and an equal number of Churches.
Boorolong Station, 281 miles; 4,328
feet above sea-level. —ls a small station
situated in the centre of. the New England
Tableland and on the summit of the range of
mountains of the same name. Along this
range the line has been carried for some dis-
tance, rising about 900 feet in the 15 miles—
from Eversleigh to Boorolong. The land in
the neighbourhood of the station is very
suitable for agricultural purposes, wheat,
barley, and other grains being extensively and
successfully cultivated, as are also the different
varieties of English fruits. The climate is
very mild and the district offers inducement
to tourists and others in search of bracing
air and picturesque scenery. From a hill
about half a mile from the station a good
view of Armidale (21 miles away) can be
obtained and there are also several falls in the
neighbourhood, formed by the head waters of
the MacLeay Fiver.
Guyra Station, 287 miles ; 4,328 feet
above sea-level. —ls situated on the Great
Northern Railway, distance, 27 miles from
Armidale and 37 miles from Glen Innes.
The Railway Station is erected on the eastern
side of the Mother of Ducks Lagoon. It is
a watering place for the locomotives, the
supply being pumped from the lagoon. The
climate is all that can be desired for a summer
residence. The greatest heat recorded by the
thermometer during the last summer, 1884,
was on February sth, when it rose to 92 in the
sun and 73 in the shade ; the usual reading is
between 60 and 70 in the shade and 80 and
90 in the sun. In the winter it is universally
conceded to be the coldest part of New
England. In August, 1882, a fall of snow
covered the ground for an average depth of 3
feet 6 inches. During the summer months
the fall of rain is so regular as to keep the
feed green and plentiful. The Mother of
Ducks Lagoon is about 13 miles in circum-
ference and is covered with all sorts of water
fowl, offering excellent shooting for sportsmen.
The country is to a great extent broken,
consisting as it does of hills and valleys, the
soil mostly of a dark brown colour, generally
being suitable for agricultural purposes, even
up to the tops of the ridges. The principal
productions are wheat and potatoes. In fruits,
cherries, plums, gooseberries, blackberries, and
currants grow particularly well. The chief
trade of the station, apart from that arising
from the selectors and others living in the


vicinity, is carried onwithTingha andlnyerell,
especially the former. Tingha is the centre of
a rich tin-mining country, the places around
comprising Gilgai, Cope’s Creek, and others.
It is a town of 1,500 inhabitants, about two-
thirds of which are Chinese. It is 40 miles
from Guyra and a mail-coach passes via
Ollera, Wandsworth, and Kangaroo Camp
thrice a week. The whole of the trade of
this town and a portion of that from Inverell,
16 miles further on, comes in at Guyra. The
amount of tin-ore sent from Guyra during
the month of January, 1885, was 145 tons
10 cwt.; this can be taken as an average.
Ben Lomond, 302 miles; 4,471 feet
above sea-level. —This is noted as being the
highest point on the Great Northern Kailway
and in fact the highest elevation attained by
Railway in this or any of the Australian
Colonies. It is an agricultural and pastoral
district, the principal cattle stations being
Llangothlin and Ollera, and the sheep stations
Greenbank and Moredon. There are two
public-houses in the vicinity. The Ben
Lomond cutting, about one mile distant from
the station, is the largest rock cutting on the
Great Northern Railway. Ben Lomond, the
highest mountain in the northern district, is
2 miles distant from the station.
Glencoe Station, 310 miles ; 3,794 feet
above sea-level. —ls 14 miles from Glen
Innes, the present terminus. From Ben
Lomond there is a fall of 677 feet to Glencoe,
some of the gradients being very steep, while
numerous cuttings and embankments occur
owing to the very hilly nature of the country,
the line traversing the main ridge of the
Great Dividing Chain for 3 miles before
reaching Glencoe; the railway however crosses
a well Avatered fertile flat, surrounded on all
sides by lofty hills, the imposing square-top
of Ben Lomond terminating the view to the
southward, the highest point on the northern
tablelands, visible about 2 miles north-west of
it. The station is very nicely situated on a
moderate elevation, Avhich is intended for the
township expected to arise at no distant date.
There is some pretty scenery in the neighbour-
hood, the place being Avell Avatered, and
numerous settlers have found comfortable
homes and profitable holdings on the adjacent
slopes and in the valleys amongst the hills,
the soil being well adapted for wheat or fruit
growing, and the pasture is excellent. This
fact is evinced by the presence of large herds
of cattle belonging to several well managed
stations in the vicinity. Owing to its prox-
imity to Glen Innes and its facilities for
communication Avith Armidale and other large
centres, coupled with its splendid climate, this
place must steadily progress.
Glen Innes, 324 miles; 3,slßfeet above
sea-level. —The station is a very handsome
building commanding a very pretty view of the
town. The district is agricultural and pastoral
and the lowlands consist of a mixture of rich
red and black soil, farm produce, wheat, barley,
oats, &c., and nearly all kinds of fruits are
groAvn in the district, and from the hills and
valleys minerals such as gold, silver, and tin-
ore are obtained. The extension to Queens-
land border is being rapidly constructed and
the line, Glen Innes to Inverell (westward),
and Glen Innes to Grafton (southward), are
authorised, and when these are open for
traffic, Glen Innes must become one of the
most important centres in NeAV South Wales.
It is sure to be a favourite resort for pleasure
seekers and tourists, the climate being most
enjoyable. It has three banking establish-
ments, two local papers, three churches, a
public school and convent, seven hotels, the
principal being Barry’s “Commercial,”
McCormack’s “ Tattersall’s,” and Goodyer’s
“Royal,” tAvo flour-mills and a brewery, a
court-house, a gaol, Post and Telegraph Office
and a fine hospital which is nicely situated on
a hill overlooking the town. A School of Arts
and Lands Department head quarters. The
extension from Glen Innes to Tenterfield is
as mentioned, being rapidly proceeded with,
and also a further extension nortlrward, from
Tenterfield to the Queensland border, a distance
of about 13 miles. The Queensland Govern-
mentare also ready to extend their railway from
Stanthorpe to our border (25 miles), so that
within a short time a union will be effected
betAveen the New South Wales and Queens-
land Raihvay Systems. As the connecting
line between Sydney and Newcastle is now
being constructed uninterrupted railway
communication Avill therefore be established,
between the three important metropoli—


Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. Unfor-
tunately however, a break of gauge takes
place on the borders of Queensland and New
South Wales and New South Wales and
Victoria, Queensland having the narrow
gauge of 3 feet 6 inches, New South Wales
the standard gauge of 4 feet 8|- inches, while
Victoria has adopted the broad gauge of 5
feet 3 inches.
IX. —SUBSIDIARY BRANCH LINES TO NORTHERN LINE.
The three Subsidiary Branch lines to the
Great Northern line of Railway do not
appear to call for any particular description
in the way of an Itinerary—being all very
short. The first —from Honeysuckle Point
to Bullock Island—has but one Station, 11-
mile from the Main line, and is chiefly used
for mineral traffic. The second —from the
Waratah Tunnels to Wallsend—has also but
one Station (Wallsend). It is miles long,
and connects Newcastle with the rising town
of Wallsend, as elsewhere pointed out. The
third Subsidiary Branch line to the Great
Northern Railway—from East Maitland to
Morpeth numbers three stopping-places ;
East Maitland, Morpeth, and Northumber-
land-street. The first-named has been else-
where described, but the last-named presents
no feature calling for any special notice.
Morpeth Station, 22 miles from New-
castle by rail, is an important township sit-
uated on the Hunter, about 30 miles by river
from Newcastle. A branch line, 4 miles in
length, connects the township, joining the
Great Northern Railway at East Maitland.
The navigation of the Hunter by ocean
steamers is only practicable as far as this
point, and it is this fact that mainly renders
Morpeth such an important and thriving
town. The greater part of the goods for the
Northern Districts are consigned to this
place, and it may be considered the shipping
port for a large area of the Northern District.
The droghers belonging to the Steam Com-
panies convey the produce down the rivers
to the Morpeth wharfs, where it is tran-
shipped to the ocean-going steamers. The
town and vicinity have a population of 2,500
souls, and boasts of a municipality. The
ratable value of property in 1876 was
£88,284, and the revenue for the year £9BB.
There are amongst the buildings a School of
Arts, five Churches, and four Schools. The
Paterson, perhaps the most important of the
tributaries of the Hunter, joins the main
river at this point ; and opposite Morpeth is
found the pretty little township of Hinton.
The country around Morpeth is chiefly
agricultural, and is said to be the richest
cultivable land in the Colony ; and there is
no prettier sight to be found in the district
than that along the banks of the Hunter and
the Paterson near Morpeth, where the green
fields, stretching for miles, maybe aptly termed
the garden of the Hunter. Unfortunately
the lands here lie very low, and it has been
the scene of many disastrous floods. Of late,
however, the seasons have been good, and
there have been no floods, consequently the
district is in a very prosperous condition.
X. —WERRIS CREEK TO NARRABRI, 97 MILES.
NORTH-WESTERN LINE.
Breeza, 170 miles, 951 feet above sea-
level.—After leaving Werris Creek the line
passes over a comparatively level country,
prettily timbered. Werris Creek is spanned
by a timber bridge with six openings of 29
feet 6 inches. At 4 miles from Werris Creek
the Gap, a large cutting between two hills,
is reached. At this point are some extensive
cuttings, 65,000 cubic yards being taken
from the heaviest. Leaving the Gap, where


a platform has been erected, the line runs
across a black soil plain which, when well
grassed in good seasons, presents a pretty
appearance. The soil in this and similar
plains along the line is rich and well suited
for the growth of grain, but owing to the
uncertain rainfall rendering the pastoral
pursuits more profitable, agriculture has not
been carried on to any great extent. The
line subsequently runs at the base of a
mountain range into Breeza. Breeza is a
township of small importance, possessing
about thirty houses. It is on the edge of a
great plain known as the Breeza Plain. In a
good season when the grass is fresh and green
it is a splendid sight, the plain quite treeless
stretching away for miles, while in the distance
and forming a background to the picture, lie
a long range of dark blue mountains.
Gunnedah, 196 miles, 874 feet above
sea-level. —The line from Breeza leaves the
plains, which in wet weather are almost im-
passable, and skirts some lightly-timbered
ridges with occasional well-grassed flats.
There is a platform at Curlewis (185 miles),
from which a considerable quantity of timber
is dispatched. There are no engineering
difficulties met with in this length, the
steepest gradient being 1 in 55. As Gunne-
dah is reached the country becomes more
open and free from scrub. Gunnedah is a
promising town, which has increased in popu-
lation from 459 in 1871 to 1,331 in 1881.
It is situated on the Namoi, and is in the
celebrated pastoral district of Liverpool
Plains. From this station large quantities
of wool and live stock are annually sent
away. Although the district is well adapted
for the growth of wheat not much is grown,
but in order to meet local wants a flour-mill
has recently been erected in Gunnedah. A
brewery is also erected here, and in the town
are a number of stores and hotels, the prin-
cipal being the “Court-house,” “Caledonian,”
“Freemasons,” and “Carriers’Arms.” A great
deal of traffic is received here for a large area
of country. The station buildings are hand-
some and commodious, and for the large live
stock traffic extensive cattle-yards have been
established.
Boggabri, 220 miles, 822 feet above
sea-level. —A pleasant pastoral country is
passed between Gunnedah and Boggabri, the
line passing over rich level alluvial flats on a
continuous embankment, the country present-
ing the appearance of an immense well-
grassed park, and on no other part of the
Railway lines of the Colony are such mag-
nificent stretches of plain met with. On the
edge of the plains fine forests are growing,
and behind this again rise the mountain
ranges. Boggabri is situated on the banks
of the Namoi, which runs not far distant
from the Railway. The population of the
township is 453 souls. It contains four hotels,
a neat brick Post and Telegraph Office, Court-
house, and Public School. In the vicinity of the
town are many pretty scenes. Nyngindoon,
a mountain which presents at a distance the
appearance of some old ruined castles and
forts ; the Rock Mountain, a perpendicular
wall of rock, under which a township nestles;
Bynalong, an isolated peak rising abruptly
from the plain, resembling a helmet placed on
a table. Along the banks of the Namoi,
also some picturesque views are obtained,
and from its waters numbers of fish are
taken. At Boggabri a water supply for the
locomotives and township is obtained from
the Namoi. Near the station the line
crosses Cox’s Creek, which is bridged by
twenty timber openings of 26 feet span each.
Narrabri, 252 miles, 697 feet above
sea-level. —The terminus of the North
western line is now situated at Narrabri on
the Namoi, but an agitation is on foot to
have the line extended to Walgett, near the
junction of the Darling and Namoi. Narra-
bri, on account of its present position, com-
mands the trade of an extensive tract of
pastoral country drained by the many tribu-
taries of the Darling. Goods are received
here for Walgett, Moree, Wee Waa, Pilliga,
and Mungindi. In this large area millions
of sheep are depastured, the wool from which
forms a large item in the outward traffic
from Narrabri. The district possesses a very
rich black soil, but owing to the uncertainty
of the seasons and the distance the district is
from the principal markets, agriculture has
not been largely carried on. After leaving
Boggabri the line passes through some
broken country, and numbers of cuttings
are passed through. The country is covered


with forests of pine, excellent timber being
obtained throughout the districts adjacent to
the Railway. At 240 miles Turrawan Plat-
form is passed. Narrabri is a town with
832 inhabitants. The Railway Station is
2 miles from the main centre of the town;
between them flows the Namoi, which is
crossed by a substantial timber bridge.
Narrabri possesses some good stores and
hotels, the principal being the “ Victoria ”
and “ Commercial.” A soap-manufactory is
established here, and to supply local wants
a flour-mill is at work.
The following descriptions of a trip between
Tamworth and Armidale and Werris’ Creek
to Narrabri are from the pen of a well-known
writer :
11 From Tamworth to Armidale by Rail.
“As the train moves out of the Tamworth
Station, a passenger, by looking to the right,
will obtain a good view of the town and its
surroundings. In the distance the prospect
is bounded by the Turi Range, between which
and the spectator lies the valley of the Peel
River. Scattered over the alluvial flats
which border the river are farms with their
homesteads half seen through the shading
trees. According to the season the fields
are green with young wheat or yellow with
the promised harvest; in either case the
view is pleasing both to the lover of the
picturesque and to the thoughtful citizen who
recognises in such scenes the true mode of
settling population upon the land. This kind
of country continues for some miles, even
after the course of the railway has entered
the valley of the Cockburn River.
“ Glancing occasionally to the left as he
pi’oceeds, the traveller may discern the lower
spurs of a mountain range, at the foot of
which the railway has been constructed.
This range, known from very early times as
the Moonbi, occupies the angle lying between
the Peel and theMaluerindi rivers, and, though
steep and rugged, was formerly the principal
means of access to the New England portion
of the northern table-land. It was doubtless
with a view to avoid, as far as practicable,
this formidable barrier that the railway was
carried along the level country at its foot.
Little increase of elevation is accordingly
perceptible in traversing the 11 miles which
intervene between the Tamworth and Moonbi
stations. From this point, however, the
valley rapidly contracts. Low conical hills
appear on the opposite side of the river, and
being sparsely timbered and grassed to the
very summit, they form a very characteristic
portion of the scene. The Moonbi Ranges
also approach closely to the line, and exhibit
their rocky and precipitous faces in such near
proximity as to exclude all other objects on
that side from the traveller’s gaze.
“ An iron building on the right may cause
some speculation as to the use of such a
structure in that locality; and unless the
train passed at a particular hour, few would
surmise that it is a well-attended school—a
good example of the all-pervasive influence of
the Public Instruction Act. At a short dis-
tance from the school the train stops for a
supply of water to the engine at a very pretty
spot where, the river having been artificially
dammed, a fine reach has been formed. After
a long journey through a dry country the
sight of this sheet of water shaded with over-
hanging trees is a relief to the eye, besides
being an agreeable variation in the scenery.
Leaving this interesting spot the train moves
onward, and in a short time passes through a
tunnel. Judging by the nature of the rocks
visible in the cuttings, the work of forming
the line in this portion must have been ex-
ceedingly heavy.
“ It now becomes evident that the course
of the railway lies in a narrow gorge, through
which flows a tiny streamlet. In following
the windings of this gorge the way frequently
crosses the stream, and is carried through
cuttings and along sidings made on the faces
of steep and rocky mountains. In fact, for
more than 10 miles the railway has been
driven through the very heart of the Moonbi
Range, climbing as it -were from one vantage
point to another, and reaching an elevation
of 3,000 feet above the sea-level. Compared
with the country previously passed through,
the scenery possesses a rugged grandeur
seldom witnessed by the ordinary traveller.
Lofty and precipitous mountains rise on each
side and in front, apparently barring the way
in every direction ; their summits are pointed,
and their sides often bare and exposing the
granite of which they are formed. As the
evening shadows begin to fall the traveller


may dimly discern through the gloom the
bottom of the gorge apparently at an im-
mense depth below, while the peaked summits
of the mountains far above are still tinged
with sunlight. This portion of the journey
undoubtedly possesses greater romantic in-
terest than is to be found in any other part of
the railways yet constructed in New South
Wales ; and the tourist who has been accus-
tomed to the flat-topped elevations with their
horizontal strata, so abundant on the Western
Line, will be delighted to see here real moun-
tains. In contour, colouring, and grouping,
the mountains of the Moonbi Range differ
entirely from the Blue Mountains.
“By the time the necessary elevation has
been gained, the railway enters the water-
shed of the Maluerindi, or, as it is called, with
the fatal facility for misnaming localities and
things so prevalent in New South Wales, the
Macdonald River. Rocky cuttings and huge
granitic boulders strewn about in all directions
still attest the ruggedness of the country, but
the rise and fall of the road are not remark-
able, and the traveller feels some surprise at
the stoppage of the train, after crossing a
bridge, by the side of a considerable stream.
There are few to whom the seldom-heard
music of running and falling water will not
be welcome ; and while the engine is receiving
a fresh supply of water, he can indulge in a
few minutes’ quiet enjoyment while he listens
and notes the various points of the surround-
ing scene. The river, visible through its
screen of casuarinas, which it is hoped no
vandalism will be permitted to destroy,
sparkles in the sunlight. On a rock in the
stream stands a blue crane watching patiently
for his prey, and an occasional plunge indi-
cates the presence of a platypus. Further
up the stream the valley widens out, dis-
playing a considerable stretch of pastoral
country, which forms an agreeable contrast
to the wooded district through which the
traveller had lately passed.
“From his contemplation of this scene he
is aroused by the shriek of the engine whistle,
announcing that the train is again on the
move. After traversing 5 miles of undulating
country, in the course of which curves and
deep cuttings are of frequent occurrence, the
line reaches the Walcha Road Station, At
the foot of the station-grounds (which have
been made by levelling the hill side) lies
Surveyors’ Creek, which, except in rainy
weather, appears to be almost dry. Besides
the station buildings there are in the incipient
township an inn and a store, and other dwell-
ings not visible from the train are scattered
about the neighbourhood. In the season the
goods-shed and platforms are seen to be piled
up with bales of wool, to account for the pre-
sence of which a stranger to the distinct would
be mightily puzzled, unless he happened to
observe a loaded dray descending the steep
hill which rises upon the opposite side of the
creek. This hill forms the watershed between
the eastern and western streams, or, in other
words, between the tributaries of the Macleay,
which flows eastwards into the Pacific, and
those of the Peel, which runs westward to the
Darling, and thence into the Southern Ocean.
Along this road is conveyed the produce of a
large extent of country stretching as far to
the east as the edge of the table-land, and
including a pastoral region lying to the south-
ward. By the same road merchandise is
carried to Walcha, the nearest town to the
eastward, and also to the numerous stations
situated in that direction.
“ Leaving Walcha Road, and passing on the
right the humble little school which, useful
though it be, is not likely to attract the
attention of a casual traveller, the route pro-
ceeds through a somewhat mountainous
country, in which long and deep cuttings in
granite have to be traversed, and where
boulders of the same rock are the most con-
spicuous objects visible on each side of the
line. The country continues to be of this
kind until the little platform at Wolleen is
reached, when the line enters a region appro-
priated in all appearance to sheep. Tolerably
level, partially cleared, but studded thickly
in places with gaunt, ugly dead trees, the
country presents an aspect devoid of interest.
Flocks of sheep may occasionally be seen
scattered over the slopes or nibbling near the
line ; but in more than one spot the traveller
is liable to mistake a crop of peculiar weeds
for these animals from the curious way in
which the plants are dotted over the pad-
docks. The signs of settlement in this part
of the country, and visible from the line, are
very rare, though it is possible that at some
little distance population may be more


abundant. At the Kentucky Station, for
example, which is the next stopping place,
not many habitations can be seen, though
judging from the size and appearance of the
Public School buildings, there must be a con-
siderable number of children in the locality.
“ Proceeding onwards through undulating
country, which would be in some degree
interesting if not disfigured with dead stand-
ing timber, the traveller may notice the
peaked hills in the distance, bare of trees,
but grassed to the summit. On each side of
the line he may also observe a luxuriant
growth of native flowers, yellow everlastings,
the pretty but noxious Darling pea, and
masses of blue flowers of two or three dif-
ferent kinds and as many tints. Occasion-
ally glimpses may be obtained of cultivated
grounds, the various tints of the green crops
chequering the general landscape pleasantly,
though a farmer who understood his business
would deplore the abundance of sorrel which
in some paddocks causes the prevailing hue
to be a dull red. In fact, this prolific but
undesirable weed seems to be spreading over
the district, and threatens to become as great
an evil as the Bathurst burr of former days.
“ The next stopping-place for the train,
Uralla, as viewed from the station is a pretty
little town situated upon the sides of hills
which slope down to the Rocky River.
Upon the opposite bank of that river rise
two conspicuous hills, locally named Mount
Mutton and Mount Beef, the former, con-
trary to the expectation which their re-
spective names would lead one to entertain,
being the more lofty. The once famous
Rocky River Gold-field occupied this neigh-
bourhood, and the search for the precious
metal is still carried on to some extent.
Some picturesque views of the town and dis-
tant mountains may be obtained from the
railway line, which at this place is elevated
above the adjacent lands.
“ From Uralla the line gradually ascends,
passing through a piece of granite country,
huge boulders of that rock being scattered
on each side of the track. At the distance of
a few miles the line crosses the carriage road
to Armidale, and as the engine whistles to
signal the gatekeeper, if the traveller looks
out on the right-hand side he will notice a
swamp of considerable size. Probably a flock
of ibises will rise as the train passes; and, by
many, birds of this species will be seen for
the first time. But the swamp in question
possesses greater interest as being actually on
the watershed of this part of the country.
In rainy weather the waters overflow on two
sides of the swamp, feeding streams which
flow eastward to the Pacific and others run-
ning west to the Darling, and ultimately into
the Murray. From this point the line
traverses a stretch of tolerably level country
apparently devoted to pasturage. Sheep may
be seen in all directions, and but for the
abundance of hideous dead timber, the scene
might be considered almost pretty. Under
the circumstances the eye gladly rests upon
the young growth of the gum, which, in the
sunshine, appears of a dark but brilliant
purple.
“As we advance, the flowers which grow
on the sides of the railway line are seen to
be more numerous and of brighter tints,
indicating a change for the better in the
character of the soil. Cultivated farms are
of frequent occurrence, and with their pleasant
homesteads sheltered by willows, elms, and
poplars, and their fields and gardens enclosed
with green hedges of white thorn, present a
picture of rural beauty rarely surpassed in
Australia. The cattle and horses feeding in
the rich pasture add to the impression that a
corner of Old England has been transplanted
bodily to the New. As the train approaches
nearer to Armidale the evidences of settle-
ment become more scanty, until at length a
fine view of the city is obtained. The sta-
tion, a handsome and commodious building,
is situated about a mile from the centre of
the city, to which passengers may be conveyed
in the omnibuses and sociables that for such
purpose await the arrival of trains.
“ The foregoing description was written
from observations made in spring and early
summer, and, to be correctly understood,
must be regarded as applying to those seasons
only, and to a railway journey undertaken by
day. In winter the aspect of the country
will be materially changed, especially as re-
gards colouring. The mountains may be white
with snow, the streams ice-bound, and the
deciduous trees leafless. Even at this season,
however, the journey from Tamworth will be
full of interest to the intelligent traveller.”


“From Werris Creek to Narrabri by Rail.
Once a day the little station at Werris Creek
Junction is relieved from its wearisome
monotony and becomes the scene of as much
bustle and animation as can be excited by the
arrival of three trains from long distances
and various directions. For a brief half
hour all is life and movement; but after the
trains have departed on their several ways
the accustomed quiet returns. One of the
trains proceeds to Newcastle, another to
Armidale, and the third to Narrabri.
It is hardly to be expected that a traveller
will take a seat in the last-mentioned train
unless impelled by some motive more urgent
than the search for the picturesque. The
country through which this line passes, not-
withstanding the flourishing towns situated
along the route, is known to be applied, for
the most part, to pastoral purposes, and to be,
in consequence, but sparsely inhabited. Its
formation, in general terms, is that of an
immense plain, separated into portions by the
occurrence of mountain ranges which are
either offshoots from the great Liverpool
Range, or isolated elevations apparently
thrown up above the ordinary level by some
convulsion of nature. As inequalities of
surface are unfavourable to railway construc-
tion the lines are, as a rule, carried through
the tamest portions of the country, avoiding
hills and streams and other natural objects
which might contribute to give variety and
character to the scenery. Such is pre-
eminently the case with the Narrabri line
which, while following the general course of
the Namoi River, keeps at a distance from
its banks, and at the same time from the
elevated ground which forms its watershed.
The result is that, for the greater part of its
length, this line is distinguished by a mono-
tony that, to most persons, is oppressive in
the extreme.
In early spring, however, especially when
the season is favourable, even the traveller
who has no stronger impulse to visit the
district than sight-seeing, may derive pleasure
from a trip by rail to Narrabri. At such a
time the vast expanse of green, bounded at
a distance by fantastic ranges of mountains
which are seen in strong relief through the
transparent atmosphere, presents to the eye
of a stranger unaccustomed to such scenes,
a prospect which, besides the charm of novelty,
possesses many of the elements of pictorial
beauty. The luxuriance and diversity of the
natural grasses and herbage will also excite
his curiosity and even his wonder; and in
the form and colouring of the foliage of the
forest trees he will, if gifted with the observ-
ing faculty, notice a great difference between
those growing upon the plains and those
found in other districts.
But as the great majority of railway
passengers travel when they must, and not
when they would, the following description
of the journey applies to the summer season
mainly, when the country is certain to appear
at its worst. Diverging from the main line
at a somewhat acute angle, the Narrabri
branch bends round rapidly in a westerly
direction towards a range of steep and rocky
hills, of no great elevation at this point, but
peaked at their summits. This range, pro-
bably an outlying spur from the Liverpool
Range, consists of but a single ridge and
occupies but a narrow space. Passing quickly
over four miles of level plain, the train stops
when midway through a gap in the ridge.
This platform is known as “ Gap,” a name
which is appropriate enough were it not for
the immense number of places throughout
the country which are similarly designated.
As no habitations are in view from this
place the population must be located at a
distance.
Emerging from this little defile the train
runs out upon a plain which extends in one
direction as far as Breeza. On the left the
view is limited by rising ground covered with
forest j but on the right the prospect is much
more open and extensive. In spite of the
haze which partially obscures the view the
plain may be seen stretching out towards
the Nandewar Range, which occupies the
horizon to the north-west. The plain reminds
the traveller of the ocean on a calm day, the
distant hills resembling islands, while the
haze helps to render the illusion complete.
At particular points, which must be watched
for if the traveller desire to catch the finest
views, the mountains which do not approach
within sixty miles of this part of the line,
present a striking appearance, and their pro-
file constantly varies as the train moves on.


Nearer the line the outlook is somewhat
dismal, the scantiness of verdure imparting
a desolate appearance to the landscape. On
the track itself the motion of the train
causes thousands of small white butterflies
to take flight from the earth and together
with the thistle-down scattered by the same
agency, to fill the air with showers of white
substances, not a few of which find their way
into the carriages. So far, not a bird or beast
has been seen, and no human being has been
visible, except the solitai’y passenger that left
the train at the Gap. The feeling of solitude
which the traveller has up to this time
experienced is now relieved by the appear-
ance of a homestead on the left hand, and
shortly after the village of Breeza is sighted.
Crossing by a long wooden bridge, the water-
less bed of the Conadilly River, the train
pulls up at the Breeza station, where a short
stoppage takes place, and the traveller can
look around him at leisure. His first reflec-
tion will probably be that the assemblage of
so many people in such a place is altogether
inexplicable, but on second thoughts he will
remember that a similar mystery hangs over
the existence of the great majority of country
towns and villages. The Breeza Plains have
been noted for the luxuriance of their grasses
and herbage from the time when Liverpool
Plains were first occupied ; but so denuded
are they now of every trace of vegetation,
that a faithful description of their present
appearance would read like a paragraph ex-
tracted from the book of travels through the
desert places of Arabia. The village seems,
nevertheless, to be flourishing, if its condition
is to be judged by the number of habitations
visible from the train.
On leaving Breeza the railway crosses the
foot of a hill, and here occurs one of the few
cuttings to be seen on this line. Though
carried through a level country, the line is
kept clear of river flats which are subject to
inundation, but which sustain the greatest
amount of population. On this account the
principal streams will never be found to run
at a distance from the railway, and invariably
out of sight, with the exception of such
points as are occupied by towns through which
the line must neceasarily pass. Most of the
land traversed is forest land, there being
occasionally open country devoted to pastur-
age, of agricultural operations hardly a trace
is visible. To a traveller visiting tlie great
plains for the first time the appearance of
the foliage will not bo devoid of interest.
While the dreary eucalyptus will not be
wanting he will observe an abundance of
other trees which in shape and especially in
the brilliant green of their leaves, will remind
him of the deciduous trees of other countries,
and which impart to the general effect of the
scene a degree of lightness and warmth of
tone rarely seen in the “ bush” of other parts
of the country. At intervals he will notice
extensive tracts occupied chiefly and even
wholly by a species of pine, which is im-
pressive from its novelty and from its sombre
hue. The timber of this plant, though
possessing some defects, is extremely useful
for building purposes, and saw-mills have
been established with a view to render it
available to the residents in more settled
districts. One of these establishments with
its engine and mill-pond is placed near the
line, and will not fail to attract the attention
of passengers, even if the train should not
stop at the platform.
At Gunnedah, the next station, the train
will probably be detained sufficiently long to
enable the curious traveller to take note
of the surroundings. He will be in some
measure surprised at the prosperous appear-
ance of the town, and may even be struck
with the air of newness visible in the buildings,
from which he will justly infer that a rapid
increase has taken place in the number of
structures erected for various purposes in the
town within the last few years. As the
centre of a pastoral and agricultural district
of considerable extent, Gunnedah bids fair to
become a place of some importance.
For the next 20 miles the line traverses
country of a similar character to that already
passed through, and exhibiting the same kind
of vegetation. On nearing Boggabri, how-
ever, a more open tract will be seen, and this
little town will be found lying on the right
of the line and extending to the banks of the
Namoi, the existence of which river is indi-
cated, not by a visible stream but by a fringe
of trees. The impression a traveller would
be likely to form of Boggabri by merely
viewing it from the station, can easily be
imagined; he would pronounce it to be a


quiet respectable village with some resources
for its support in the immediate neighbour-
hood.
Proceeding on our journey, and crossing
a hill-side which required cuttings of com-
paratively great size for this line, we enter
upon another extensive tract of forest land,
which presenting no novelty of any kind
fails to awaken any interest. It is therefore
felt to be a relief when the train, after a run
of 10 miles, draws up at the little platform at
Baan Baa, to set down half-a-dozen children
returning from school at Boggabri. The
provision of the law which permits such
children to travel free is undoubtedly a great
boon, as it enables them to secure a few
hours schooling under circumstances in which
it would be impossible for them to obtain
instruction by any other means. They dis-
appear into the forest with business-like
alacrity, and we proceed upon our solitary
way. Not another human being comes within
sight till 20 more miles have been passed.
Occasionally a kangaroo makes its appearance,
hardly troubling itself to hop a few yards, as
if assured of its own safety in the wild
solitude. One noble fellow of the red species
stood gazing at the train which it regarded
with a sort of languid interest, but another
which had contrived to get upon rails ex-
hibited more animation, and attempted for a
short distance to race with the engine, but
relinquished the unequal contest in time to
secure its safety. Such incidents appear to
indicate that the country is sparsely popu-
lated, at least in the vicinity of the line.
After another run of 10 miles, the Turra-
wan platform is passed, and then evidences
that the land is occupied begin to appear.
Roads may be seen, cleared spots abut upon
the line, and sheep and even cattle come
within view. All these signs are multiplied
as the train approaches Narrabri, where the
noise and bustle speedily reminds us that we
are still within the bounds of civilization.
Wool abounds everywhere—in trucks, in the
goods-shed, on the platforms, and in heavily
laden drays. The station-yard and the roads
in the vicinity are crowded with teams, and
the general air of the place seem to denote
great activity. The traveller who imagines
that his journey is ended will be surprised
to learn that in order to reach the town he
has yet 2 miles to travel by omnibus. The
original town of Narrabri is situated upon the
other side of the Namoi, and is approached
by a good macadamised road, along the sides
of which a new town has rapidly sprung into
existence. Crossing the Namoi and an ana-
branch thereof by long wooden bridges, the
traveller will find himself in a town of con-
siderable extent, in which the vast majority
of the houses, old and new, are constructed
of timber.


APPENDIX.
THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.
The Blue Mountains of New South Wales have
special interest for the geologist. In the precipitous
ravines, and in the deep and widening valleys, are
exposed, in splendid natural sections, some of the
most interesting as well as important geological for-
mations of New South Wales. Interesting are these
rock formations, as revealing momentous changes
that have taken place in past geological times; and
important as yielding, in some of them, vast de-
posits of mineral wealth—coal and iron.
Standing on one of the many ranges and looking
down into the valleys which stretch out in various
directions before us, we may see in their order of
superposition, the different series of stratified rocks;
indeed we may almost determine from the changing
aspect of the land surface, from the flat-topped hills
and precipitous cliffs, from the gentle slopes and
steep inclines, the nature of the formations which
give rise to such varied scenery.
From the crest of the range we now stand on is a
perpendicular fall of more than 500 feet over a
jagged cliff of yellow rock of the Hawkesbury forma-
tion ; beneath which that thickly wooded steep decli-
vity is formed of the Upper Goal Measures, some 500
or 600 feet thick. Then descending we pass over 150
feet or more of sandstones and conglomerates be-
longing to the Lower Goal Measures, till we come to
the bottom of the valley, and find the clear spark-
ling rivulet flowing over the hard shales and Spirifer
sandstones of the Devonian formation. In another
valley we see suddenly rising up huge massive boul-
ders of granite. Again, from base to summit, another
range is clothed with a denser growth of vegetation
than occurs elsewhere; the reason of this is, that a
rich chocolate soil has resulted from the surface de-
composition of a basaltic trap dyke, which has burst
through all the sedimentary rocks, and in places
overflowed them, as at Mount Tomah. Besides
these formations there is yet another to be mentioned,
the Wianamatta Series, which, though in the Blue
Mountains it may only be found in occasional thin
patches capping the Hawkesbury rocks, yet in other
parts of the Colony attains a thickness of 700 feet.
We have therefore here seven different forma-
tions, which occur in the following order of super-
position :
Cainozoic or Tertiary— (a) Basaltic Trap.
' (b) Wianamatta Series.
(c) Hawkesbury Series.
(d) Upper Coal Measures
(plant beds).
(e) Lower Coal Measures
(marine beds).
(/) Devonian.
iq<7) Granite.
Palaeozoic or Primary
(a) The Basaltic Trap may be seen in several
parts of the Blue Mountains, as at Mount Wilson
and Mount Tomah. Wherever it occurs the rich
soil it produces supports a most luxuriant growth of
vegetation—a harvest field for the botanist.
(b) The Wianamatta shales have little special
interest beyond that of containing the remains of
fossil fish, the Palceoniscus.
(c) The Hawkesbury rocks are seen in those rugged
escarpments of yellow rock which form such pic-
turesque mural precipices, as it were walling-in the
valleys and cresting the ranges, and imparting such
wild grandeur to the scenery. These rocks form
Govett’s Leap, over which the water falls perpendicu-
larly 520 feet. This formation has also yielded a
fossil fish— Cleithrolepis granulatus —obtained in a
railway cutting over 3,000 feet above sea-level, by
Mr. T. Brown.
(d) The Upper Coal Measures contain several
seams of coal; the lowest, which is 10 feet 6 inches
thick, is worked at the various Collieries in the
Bowenfels district. Then there is the Kerosene Shale
or Petroleum Oil Coal Seam worked in the Hartley
Valley, below Mount Victoria.
Besides these all-important combustible materials,
there are rich bands of brown hsematite; this iron ore
is now being smelted at Lithgow Valley. The fossils
from the Upper Coal Measures are all plant impres-
sions, of which may be mentioned the Phyllotheca aus-
tralis, Vertebraria, Sphenopteris, Conifers, and Glos-
sopteris; this latter is the most characteristic fossil.
(e) The Lower Coal Measures in the Western
Mountains have no coal seams. Their chief fossils
(marine shells) are the Productus, the broad-winged
Spirifer vespertilio, Euomphalus, and Conularia.
(f) The Devonian beds form the lowest visible
rock in parts of the Blue Mountains ; they crop out
in the bottom of the deep Wolgan Valley; but near
Bowenfels they rise to a considerable height, and at
Mount Lambie are over 4,000 feet above the sea-
level, forming the south-west margin or lip of our
great coal basin. The Devonian strata in this dis-
trict I have ascertained to be at least 10,000 feet
thick; they contain beds of sandstone full of
Brachiopoda, chiefly Spirifers and Phynchonellce ;
the Lepidodendron nothum also occurs in the series.
These rocks also yield extensive deposits of iron
ore—the brown hsematite and magnetic oxide of
iron, and small quantities of gold.
(g) The Granite occurs chiefly in the valley of the
Cox River, below Mount Victoria. It was in some
of the granite debris near Hartley that the vener-
able geologist, the Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A., F.G.S.,
F.R.S., discovered gold so far back as the year 1841.
The vastness of the depth and extent of the preci-
pitous gorges and valleys of the Blue Mountains in-
spire one with feelings of silent awe and wonder, and
impress the minds of some persons with the notion
we hear so frequently expressed, that such enor-
mous ravines in the mountains must have required
violent convulsions in the earth’s crust for their
formation. But if we examine the rocks on all sides
of the valley, we see no breaks nor signs of violent
disturbance as suggested. The various beds of
rock in horizontal strata may be seen to continue


uninterruptedly around the sides of the valley, and
the succeeding layers of rock, as we descend one
side of the ravine, gradually approach the corres-
ponding layers on the other side, until at the bottom,
in the bed of the watercourse, we find that they
actually join, which they would not do if the sides
of the ravine had been violently torn asunder. We
perceive, therefore, that the various out-cropping
strata must once have been continuous right across
the valley or ravine, and that they have been
removed by some agency without disturbance of
the underlying beds. What then is this agency ?
Rot volcanic fire but running water. Look at the
sloping surface of any earth-cuttings or embank-
ments that have been exposed to rain action ; see
the miniature ranges and intervening valleys that
the water draining off it has furrowed out. Notice
the miniature precipices left where the harder
earth material has resisted the action of the run-
ning water, also at the bottom of the embankment,
where the incline ceases and the water flows gently,
how it deposits in miniature alluvial flats the earth
it has scooped out and washed down from above.
Now, could we look down from a considerable
height, and, as it were, take a bird’s-eye view of
the Blue Mountains, exactly similar features would
be presented to us as we observed in the earth
embankment. Wherever the soft clay strata of the
Coal Measures exist, there are sloping surfaces ;
where the harder Jlawlcesbury rocks appear, there
are cliffs, while the easily disintegrated clay-beds
have been washed away, even to undermining the
over-lying sandstone. The latter has resisted to a
great extent the denuding agencies and been left in
projecting masses which, at last, having the support-
ing soft strata removed, break away and roll in great
bosses down the sides of the hill, perhaps as far as
into the bed of the stream below, a perpendicular
cliff being left where they broke away from the main
mass of rock. It may be objected that the effects
of the present streams are not sufficiently powerful
to have worked such changes ; but then it must be
considered that these forces have been operating
through an immense period of time ; and moreover
that, in the later Tertiary epoch we have geological
data indicating that this part of the continent was
subject to a much heavier rainfall; again, in the
earlier Tertiary period a great portion of the conti-
nent was covered by the sea. It was probably
during this later epoch that these valleys first began
to be marked out as the sea-water receded ; and the
subsequent draining off from the land of the rain-
water gradually scooped out and deepened the
drainage channels, till, after a vast lapse of time,
they were shaped into the valleys as we now see
them.*

REMARKS ON THE FLORA OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.
As the traveller passes rapidly by train over the Blue
Mountains, and catches here and there a glimpse of
some stately tree or pretty shrub, he feels anxious
to know something of the vegetation which meets
his view.
Taken as a whole, the flora of the Blue Moun-
tains, especially that part through which the train
passes, is somewhat monotonous. The large orders
Myrtacece, Leguminosce, Rutacece, and Proteacece, are,
Telopea speciosissima.
(Greatly reduced.)
however, well represented; but as the geological for-
mation from Emu to Blackheath is for the most part
of sandstone, there is considerable uniformity in the
appearance of the plants. In the deep gullies where
the sun scarcely penetrates, and in those places
where the basalt rises above the sandstone, there is
a marked difference in the vegetation. Graceful
ferns, rare orchids, gigantic climbers, mosses, and
lichens, abound in such spots ; whilst the trees and
shrubs differ materially from those prevailing in
other parts of the range. Thus, for instance, at
Mount Tomah, which rises 3,400 feet above the
level of the sea, and also, to a limited extent, at
Mount Hay (3,270 feet), and Mount King George
(3,378 feet), where the basaltic formation lies above
what the late eminent geologist, the Eevd. W. B.
Clarke, F.R.S., termed the “ Wianamatta beds,”
there is a striking peculiarity in the flora. At Tomah
especially, such trees as “ Sassafras” (Doryphora
sassafras), “Light Wood” (Ceratopetalum apetalum
and Schizomeria ovata), Quintinia sieberi, and
Cargillia australis, flourish in all their native
luxuriance ; whilst, amidst the dense foliage of the
forest, or in the adjacent gullies, there may be seen
epiphytal orchids (Dendrobium and Sarcochilus)
and various species of ferAs, including the splen-
did tree-fern Piclcsonia antarctica, the climbing
Polypodium tenellum and P. scandens, several
species of Lomaria and Asplenium, and Todea
Jraseri, one of the most delicate and admired of
Australian ferns. Here also Allan Cunningham
discovered the curious climbing rooting stemmed
Fieldia australis, a plant which adheres to the


trunks of tree-ferns and covers also fallen timber;
and likewise a jasmine {J. simplicifolium), which
twines round the branches of trees. At the Kurra-
jong the cabbage-tree palm (Livistona australis ),
three species of tree-ferns ( Alsophila australis, A.
Leichhardtiana, and A. Cooperi), and Panax mur-
rayi, a fine slender tree growing to the height of
60 or 70 feet, and throwing out palm-like fronds,
may be found closely associated together. Amongst
the trees which render the flora of the mountains
interesting the following may be mentioned, viz.,
the musk-tree (Olearia argophylla ), the largest com-
posite tree in the world; Prostantherd lasianthos,
the only known tree of the Labiate family ; Atkin-
sonia ligustrina, a terrestrial mistletoe; Litscea
k
-Ml
dealbata, a fine tree of the
Laurel family; Alphi-
tonia excelsa of the
Rhamnese, a tall hard-
wooded timber tree;
Elceodendron australe, a
graceful tree with bright
red berries; Olea pani-
culata, a native olive;
Achras australis, a fine
tree, sometimes called
Illawarra apple, &c., &c.
As the traveller leaves
Emu on his way to the
Zigzag, he may notice
on the mountain slopes
several species of Euca-
lyptus, popularly known
as gum-trees, iron-bark,
blood-wood, and stringy-
bark ; but of these only
one, the mountain blood-
wood (E. eximia), differs
from the species near
Sydney. The turpen-
tine (Syncarpia laurina)
occurs frequently, and
also the tree called red-
gum (Angophora lanceo-
lata), both of which
attain considerable size;
and as the traveller pro-
ceeds, he may see two
gums (E. stellulata and
E. coriacea) and the
mountain ash (E. Sieberi),
which prefer elevated
situations. To these also may be added three
species of shrubby gums (E. microphylla, E. stricta,
and E. obtustiflora), which form dense brushes on
the higher parts of the mountains. Near Spring-
wood, Acrophyllum venosum , a rare shrub of the
Saxifrage family, was found by A. and R. Cunning-
ham on some dripping rocks not far from the
place where the Railway now passes. This is an
elegant plant with leaves in threes, and pinkish
flowers m dense auxiliary clusters. It is described
in th e Mora Australiensis from Cunningham’s speci-
mens, and little was known of it for many years,
until at length it was re-discovered by the writer
1
of these remarks, and forwarded to Baron Mueller,
the eminent botanist of Victoria, for identification.
The flowers which are most attractive on the way
over the mountains belong principally to the Rutacece
and Proteacece. Of the former, some species of
Boronia, Eriostemon, and Corrcea are great favourites
with collectors, particularly the “Native Rose” (B.
serrulata), and the “ Native Fuchsia, ” C. speciosa ;
of the latter, the “Waratah” or “Native Tulip”
(Telopea speciosissima), the “Wooden Pear” (Xylo-
melumpyriforme), the “Honey-flowers” (Lambertia
formosa), and numerous species of Banksia, Grevillea,
Persoonia, Hakea, and Lomatia, appear in their pro-
tean character and present features of interest. Sym-
phyomma montanum grows plentifully near the line
between the Weather-
board and Blackheath,
and here and there several
species of Gonospermum
with blue or white
flowers. OftheMyrtacese
or Myrtle family, exclu-
sive of Eucalyptus, Mela-
leuca, Leptospermum,
Calythrix, Bosckia, and
Darwinia are all repre-
sented by various shrubs
or small trees; but Back-
housia myrtifolia, Tris-
tania nereifolia, and Eu-
genia smithii, belong
rather to the creeks and
gullies, where also the
rare straggling shrub
Palmeria racemosa of
the Monimiacese, and
several climbers of the
genera Vitis, Sarcopeta-
lum, and Marsdenia,
occur in wild profusion.
In similar localities also
the fine tree called
“blue-gum” rises above
100 feet, and affords
excellent timber for
building purposes, such
as scantling, battens,
flooring-boards, and
ships’ planks. This spe-
cies is now referred by
Baron Mueller to Euca-
lyptus saligna. The Le-
guminous order prevails both in the gullies and
on the ranges. Gompholobium, Pultencea, Dill-
wynia, Jacksonia, and Daviesia, are all papilion-
aceous, and have yellow or orange flowers, whilst
Kennedya, Indigo/era, Mirbelia, and Hovea are of
the same kind but with purple flowers. _ To these
must be added many species of Acacia, which
belong to another division of the Leguminosse, and
are very showy at certain seasons of the year. _ A.
data and A. dealbata are amongst the most admired
species, but several of them yield a bark useful for
tanning purposes. It is difficult in a short sketch
to give an adequate idea of the extent and beauty
Boronia pinnata.


of the mountain vegetation, or to particularize those
smaller shrubs which abound even in the most
unlikely soils. The Epacrids are very lovely,
and in this part of the world occupy the place of
heaths. Some twelve species of Epacris and many
Epacris longiflora.
of the allied genera may be collected in different
parts of the mountains. Of the Iris family, Pater-
sonia and Libertia are very elegant with their
purple and white flowers, whilst the lily family is
represented by Dianella, Arthropodium, Blandfordia,
and Alania. Some of the Goodenia family and
several species of Lobelia are interesting objects for
examination, but perhaps to strangers the grass-
trees, especially Xanthorrhcea arborea, appear
amongst the most characteristic features of the
mountain vegetation. Veronica perfoliata, which
is considered to indicate the auriferous formation,
occurs near the locality in which the Rev. W. B.
Clarke first discovered gold; and the little fern
Grammitis ruti/olia, which generally shows the
proximity of granite, has been found in the same
neighbourhood. Notwithstanding the exertions of
enterprising botanists, much remains to be done in
marking the limits of known species, and probably in
bringing to light some which have hitherto escaped
observation. Through the labours of Cealey, Fraser,
Sieber, and the two Cunninghams, many of the most
beautiful species on the Blue Mountains have long
been known to science, and their specimens have
been accurately described in the Flora Australiensis,
the joint elaborate work of Bentham and Mueller,
but the late researches of Mr. Fitzgerald, F.L.S.,
show that some of the tender and transient orchids
have escaped observation. Adenochilus nortoni, so
named in honor of its discoverer, Mr. James Norton,
Adenochilus nortoni.
* From Fitzgerald.
has hitherto been found only in one spot near Mount
Victoria, within a mile of the Railway ; and from
Mr. Fitzgerald’s artistic illustrations of Australian
orchids it appears that much is yet to be learned
respecting the habitat and variations of the smaller
kinds. The same remark is applicable to the crypto-
gamous botany of the mountains ; for although the
last volume of our Flora has given a fair outline of our
ferns, yet the mosses, lichens, and fungi afford a wide
field for investigation. These are abundant in some
of the deep gullies and in the moist shady woods. A
kind of Spliceria (Pielus swainsoni) is known to exist
at Mount Tomah, for it was found there some years
ago by the late Mrs. Calvert, a lady who did much
to illustrate the natural history of the Blue Moun-
tains, and also recently at the Kurrajong by Mr. H.
Selkirk, of the Survey Department. The prospect
of finding something new therefore may serve to
encourage naturalists in their rambles amidst the
dark recesses of the mountains, and to cheer them
with the hope of associating their names with the
flora of a country which is destined to play an
important part in the world’s future history, f

THE FISH RIVER OR JENOLAN CAVES.
(By C. S. WILKINSON, L.S., F.G.S., Government Geological Surveyor.)
These limestone caves rank amongst the finest in
the Colony, and as they afford some of the most
interesting sights connected with the grand natural
scenery to be obtained within accessible distance
from the line of the Great Western Railway, it was
deemed advisable in the public interests that an
examination and survey of them should be made,
not only to serve as a guide for the hundreds of
tourists who yearly visit them, but also to ascer-
tain what steps were necessary to be taken for the
preservation of the caves, and for the convenience
and safety of visitors.
The so-called “Fish River” or “ Jenolan Caves,”
though only about 6 miles from the Fish River,
are not on the falls to that river—a tributary of the
Macquarie River which flows north-westerly to
the Darling River—but are actually on the eastern
watershed of the Great Dividing Range, and occur
in a deep valley, which contributes its waters to
the Cox River, an affluent of the Nepean and
Hawkesbury Rivers which reaches the coast at
Broken Bay.
The Caves are situated about 36 miles in a direct
line south-east from Bathurst; but they are only
about 35 miles by road from the Tarana Railway
Station ;* and though there is a well-made road
from Bathurst via Oberon, tourists usually prefer the
shorter route from Tarana, which also passes near
Oberon. The greater distance, however, involved
by taking the Bathurst Road is somewhat compen-
sated for by the fine scenery to be obtained from
the Macquarie Plains, the Fish River Valley at
O’Connell, and the extensive view of the country,
so diversified with plains and hills, to be seen
towards the north when ascending the “Mount.”
The road from Tarana is also not without natural
objects of much interest. Within 2 miles from
Tarana are some huge bosses of granite perched on
the summit of the hill known as Evan’s Crown,
These remarkable rocks, which stand out very con-
spicuously amidst the forest-covered ranges, are
splendid examples of atmospheric denudation.
They are the remaining portions of the mass of
granite that once surrounded them, and are the
silent witnesses of the enormous denudation which
eroded the present valleys and swept away that
granitic mass; they therefore teach instructive
lessons in physical geology.
Shortly after leaving Tarana the road crosses the
Fish River at the Mutton’s Falls Bridge, and then
for 6 miles it ascends granite hills until an elevation
of 3,511 feet above sea-level, or 950 feet above
Tarana, is attained. The next 10 miles, over undu-
lating country of silurian schist and sandstone
formation, bring us near to the village of Oberon.
There is also a good road to the Caves from Mount Victoria,
via Hartley and Bowenfels. This route has already been de-
scribed by Mr. John Lucas, M.P., in his account of a visit to the
Caves, which was published in the Sydney Morninq Herald,
June 5, 1863.
Just beyond this point, and where the road passes
Mr. Charles Whalan’s residence, there is a pictu-
resque view looking down into the valley of the
Fish River Creek. The grassy hills and alluvial
flats here seen afford rich pasturage, and mark the
site of one of the earliest settlements in the district,
made about forty years ago.
If we except the scenery on the Fish River Creek
and the Duckmaloi River (two clear running streams
forming the sources of the Fish River), and the
Great Dividing Range, which is crossed at an altitude
of 4,120 feet above the sea, there is little else than
a forest of gum-trees to engage attention, until the
road suddenly comes to the end of a high range, at
a spot called the “Top Camp.” From this point,
looking towards the east, a fine view may be
obtained. Immediately in the foreground lies a
deep valley, and in it, not a mile distant, are seen
craggy masses of grey limestone, in which the caves
are situated; beyond this the valley gradually
widens, with wooded hills rising, as it were, one
behind the other, up into high ranges on either side;
whilst in the extreme distance appear the Blue
Mountains, marked with that horizontal line of yel-
low sandstone cliffs which indicates the Hawkesbury
sandstone formation overlying the Coal Measures.
The finest view of the valley of the Cox (Kunimbla
Valley), and one which cannot be seen from any point
on the Blue Mountains, is obtained on the road from
Hartley to Oberon, on the range leading up from
the Cox River to Mount Binda. These are views
instructive indeed to either artist or geologist.
From the ‘ ‘ Top Camp” an excellent road has
been formed down the side of the steep range to a
running creek, where there is a small patch of level
ground convenient for camping upon, just above the
entrance to the Grand Archway. The actual descent
in this distance is 1,200 feet, and we are here 2,450
feet above sea-level. This creek— *‘ Camp Creek”—
is a south-western branch of M ‘Ewan’s Creek, which
latter comes from a north-westerly direction.
Only about 50 yards above their junction these
creeks emerge from two large archways or natural
tunnels. The arch, known as the “ Grand Arch,”
under which the Camp Creek flows, is 450 feet long,
from 35 to 180 feet wide, and from 40 to 60 feet high;
its width and height vary according to the irregular
projections of the sides and roof. On the floor are
scattered here and there huge fallen masses of the
limestone rock, some of the exposed surfaces of which
have been highly polished by the traffic over them
of wallabies and other wild animals, and exhibit
fine sections of the fossil corals and shells of which
the limestone is composed. It is not uninteresting
to reflect that the limestone, now a compact grey
marble, was once a mass of living corals, “ stone
lilies,” and molluscs, revealing the former exist-
ence, in the Siluro-Devonian epoch, of conditions of
marine life somewhat resembling those which sup-
port the beautiful living forms which build up the


reefs in the coral seas of the present day ; and it
is significant of the vast changes that this part of
the surface of the earth has undergone, when we
see fresh-water streams, at an elevation of several
thousand feet above the sea, now flowing through
rocks that were originally formed beneath the waves
of the ocean at a very remote period of the earth’s
history. These silent rock-teachings give addi-
tional charm to the many interesting features of
these caves.
The floor of the Grand Archway is in some parts
of red earth, the thickness of which has yet to
be ascertained. The above-mentioned worn and
polished edges of the rocks indicate that, for a long
time, this cave has been the resort of wild animals,
and probably of man also, whose remains will
doubtless be found here. Masses of breccia occur
in places, consisting of large and small pieces of
limestone and other rocks cemented together with
carbonate of lime. Thin veins of nitre or saltpetre
occur in this breccia, and also filling crevices in
the solid rock of the wails. This nitre has been
chemically formed, by oxidation of the ammonia
given off during the decomposition of the excrement
of animals. Nitric acid is thus produced, which,
combining with some of the potash and other
alkalies present in the earth and rocks, forms an
impure variety of saltpetre.
There are several small chambers leading off
from this Grand Archway, such as the “Bacon
Cave” and the “ Dormitory”—an opening high up
in the eastern wall, in which visitors generally camp
at night; but these are of minor importance. After
very heavy rains the water of the Camp Creek flows
through the Grand Archway, but at other times it
disappears from the creek bed just above the upper
entrance, passes through some unknown under-
ground channel, and comes out again in the bed of the
creek a few yards below the lower or north-eastern
entrance. This entrance is much larger than the
upper one, and consists of a lofty and wide arch.
Its dark gray roof and walls, with the huge fallen
masses of rock piled irregularly on the ground, pre-
sent a very imposing sight, especially when the early
morning sun enters, and lights up the dark rocky
recesses. There are very few stalactites in this cave.
The other great arch is the “ Easter Cave,” for-
merly called the “Devil’s Coach-house.” This is
also a long natural tunnel, and through it the
McEwan’s Creek flows. It is of considerable height
in its northern portion, but towards the southern it
is divided, as it were, into two stories. The upper
one forms a fine and spacious cavern; and on the
western side there is a recess in which are some fine
stalactites and stalagmites of very grotesque forms.
Near these is a large and deep circular opening in
the floor, of which visitors should beware. From
the centre of the cavern an ascent is made by a wire
rope ladder to a height of 37 feet on to an over-
hanging ledge where there is a narrow entrance into
another cave, known as the 1 Bell Cave, ” which, on
the left hand, about 60 feet towards the south, has
a wide opening on to the side of the hill ; while on
the right a long narrow passage leads off to the
“Belfry”—a small chamber in which are five or
six singular stalactites hanging close together.
K
These stalactites, when struck, give out sonorous
musical tones resembling a chime of bells. In this
cave there is an interesting thin stalactite, reaching
from the roof to the floor, and of almost uniform
diameter throughout its entire length. From the
southern entrance a pathway steeply ascends the
side of the range, and, before reaching the summit,
passes under the Carlotta Arch, a beautiful natural
arch, about 60 feet high and 40 feet wide, having
its span ornamented with stalactites. It forms a
narrow bridge connecting two prominent portions
of the rugged limestone ridge which, like a huge
stone dam, extends across the Camp Creek and
McEwan’s Creek valleys. One high point on this
ridge is called the Pinnacle, aud forms a con-
spicuous object in the landscape ; its large craggy
masses of white and grey limestone, with the
various kinds of trees growing amongst them, give
it a very picturesque appearance.
The limestone forms a belt from 200 to 400 yards
wide, extending almost directly across the main
valley ; and we thus see that the two principal
creeks which drain the valley, instead of. cutting
down this barrier of limestone during the erosion
of the valley, found it easier to excavate subter-
ranean channels for their waters, and so formed
these natural tunnels.
The erosion of the present valleys took place
chiefly during the Pliocene Tertiary epoch. There
is no reason therefore why we may not expect to
find in the loam and gravel deposits in the caves,
remains of the Diprotodon, Thylacoleo, and other
extinct animals of the Pleistocene period, together
with the earliest traces of man on this part of
Australia.
The limestone is of Palaeozoic Siluro-Devonian
age, and iuterbedded with strata of sandstone and
shale; its strike is north sto 10 degrees west.
Amongst the fossils which it contains are the genera
favosites, cyathophyllum, heliolites, and othoceras,
besides crinoids and bivalve shells, too imperfectly
preserved for identification.
Near Camp Creek, about 10 chains above the
caves, an intrusive mass of porphyritic greenstone
occurs between the limestone and shales ; the latter
are very indurated in the vicinity of it.
Mr. Charles Whalan states that the caves were
discovered about the year 1841, when his father, the
late Mr. James Whalan, and two mounted police,
were in search of the notorious bushranger McEwan,
whom they captured in a small hut not far from
the caves.
The Lucas and Elder Caves are described as fol-
lows by Mr. Lament H. G. Young, C.E., F.G.S.,
Geological Surveyor, who, with Mr. Cambridge,
surveyed them: —
The Lucas Cave, as will be seen by the plan, is
the larger; the entrance to it is situated on the east
side of the belt of limestone that runs in a north
and south direction through the surrounding
country. The entrance of the cave is spacious, but
narrows almost at once, and then opens out again
into a very large chamber. As the Lucas Cave is
principally composed of a series of large chambers
connected by narrow passages, a description of this
first one will apply to the others, which have all


the same characteristics, more or less modified.
The caves were at the time of our visit exception-
ally dry ; and from the stains on the stalagmitic
formations and the scarcity of forms undergoing
accretion, it would appear that in places some time
has elapsed since the period when active growth
was taking place. The limestone seems to have been
quite washed out of situ and carried to considerable
distance before being at all liberated from solution,
as but few stalagmites, and scarcely any stalactites
are to be seen ; only here and there are exceptional
stalagmites, generally of very massive form, but
still quite dwarfed by the height of the roof above
them. Round the walls however are numerous
fringes and mantels of carbonate of lime, ‘ ‘ curtain
stalactites, ’’and from their banded appearance when
viewed by transmitted light, it is evident they have
been deposited in long thin lines, and not as the
pointed varieties by drop accretions. This would
not be at all singular were the different coloured
bands strictly horizontal or of unequal breadth
throughout, as then it would be easy to imagine a
line of dependent moisture slowly depositing the
lime it held in solution, but these bands are often in
places quite vertical, gradually rounding off at their
lower extremity, and of equal breadth throughout
their entire length. For this appearance it may be
supposed that the growth of the mantel is very slow,
and that the edges were never laden with water, but
merely moist. The various tints of the bands are
doubtless due to the greater or less amount of iron
held in solution by the water at different periods.
The floors of these chambers are more or less
covered with blocks of limestone, often of consider-
able size, that have fallen from the roof and sides,
and have afterwards been wasted, and cemented
together by carbonate of lime deposited from perco-
lating waters. In many places the ground is
covered with a red clay-like substance, and in one
instance, namely the Bride’s Chamber, there is
plainly to be seen an infall of red clay of extremely
plastic nature, coming in from above, where it has
doubtless been accumulated in some older fissure.
Occasionally one meets with evident deposits of
bat-droppings. At several spots, high above a
man’s height, are to be seen old water-lines, so
strongly marked, that it is certain the level of the
water must have remained constant for considerable
periods of time. In the lowest portion of the Lucas
Cave there is a pool of exceeding clearness; it
appears to have little if any flow, and several ex-
periments we made gave no satisfactory result.
The well-rounded but small entrances and exits
to these larger chambers, the absence of propor-
tionally large stalactitic growths, the waterlines high
up on the wall, the large blocks, and fine mud on
the floors, and the still pools in the lowest portions
of the caves, all seem to show that these large
chambers have been the successive reservoirs of
pools of water, which while lying in them have
rapidly deepened the chamber by taking up the
limestone forming their bed into solution, at the
same time that they heightened it by the water
creeping into the natural joints of the rock, and
causing large blocks to fall down from the sides and
roof. As the lime-laden waters gradually found
their way through those portions of the rock (form-
ing their basin) which were most easily attacked,
they must have enlarged these, and finally reached
some fresh portion of the limestone deposit, in
which, whether from its being less easily attacked,
or some other reason, a fresh chamber has been
formed.
In many places the floors of the chambers and
galleries give a hollow sound on being tapped, and
a proper inspection of these might lead to the dis-
covery of organic remains. In reference to this it
might be interesting to note the successive deposits
laid open in the celebrated Kent’s Hole Cave, near
Torquay, Devonshire, England. “ The cavern con-
sists of a number of branching chambers of various
shapes and dimensions. The complete succession
of deposits from above downwards, is: (a) fallen
blocks of limestone, cemented by carbonate of lime;
( h ) dark mud,, chiefly composed of decayed veget-
able matter (black mould); (c) a layer of granular
stalagmite; (d) charred wood, &c. (black band);
(e) cave earth; (f) crystalline stalagmite; {g)
breccia. The series is not always so complete as is
here stated; but wherever all the deposits are
found in one and the same vertical section the order
of superposition is clear and invariable, and else-
where the succession, though defective, is never
transgressed.
‘ ‘ The highest beds contain bones of animals still
living in Devonshire; but when we reach the granu-
lar stalagmite, we come across the remains of
animals which are no longer found in Britain.
Here we find hysena, rhinoceros, bear, lion, and a
host of other animals, and with them the remains of
man. In the crystalline stalagmite and the breccia
the remains are often exclusively those of the bear,
but occasionally bones of the lion and the fox
occur. Here, too, remains of man are found, but
his implements are of a decidedly ruder type than
are those found in the hyaena beds above.”*
There appear to have been two distinct periods
during which stalactitic growth formed; one of
comparatively remote age, and very local in charac-
ter, being chiefly confined to the caves known as
the Lurline and Bone Caves, and another but re-
cent, and still in operation. The older growth is
essentially of a stalactitic type, and the stalactites
are remarkably thick ; though, in one or two cases,
as in Chamber No. I, a huge stalagmite is to be
seen. The newer growth exhibits every fantastic
and beautiful form known, from the thin hollow
reed and transparent veil, to the snow-white dome
stalagmites, the crystal-fringed pool, the wave-
lined floor, and the crooked-fringed shapes that are
turned in all directions.
Though on the plan the chief features of the
caves are indicated, it is very possible that many
other places exist of a size worthy of being repre-
sented, for the sides of all the chambers and
galleries are lined with numerous cavities and cracks
which might easily lead to large apertures, and
even chambers. It is in these small crevices, and in
some of the passages, that the newer growth above
referred to is taking place, and as it is of a more

(Section C).


brittle and much whiter character than the older
and more massive deposits, the official guide should
pay particular attention to its preservation; a
small and beautifully white stalactite is much more
attractive as a specimen than a portion of an old
yellow one (that it takes two men to girth); and
that such is the universal opinion is in places very
practically demonstrated ; still, as a whole, the con-
tents of the caves have been properly respected
as regards appropriation, though in many places the
most beautiful of the growths have been sadly dis-
figured by having names written across them. It
may be suggested that in one or two spots, removed
from any stalactitic growth, spaces be reserved
where those visitors who wished might inscribe
their names.
In the cave known as the Bone Cave fragments
of bones have been found ; but the special bone to
which the guide Wilson generally calls attention
is so covered with a stalagmitic growth that it is
impossible to say whether it is a bone or not. The
Bone Cave, as before remarked, and the caves in
its immediate neighbourhood, have a distinctive
character, that is, they are splendidly draped and
pillared by massive stalactites and sheets of
stalactitic growth. On the floor of this cave, which
is the one in which Mr. Hart took his admirable
photographs by the magnesium light, is a peculiar
woolly-looking growth —tufts of carbonate of lime,
so to say—which appear to cover an earthy
deposit.
The prettiest spots in the Lucas Cavern are the
Bone and Lurline Caves above mentioned. There
is a pretty group in the Bride’s Chamber, and
though it is very small, the forms are various and
very perfect. It is in the neighbourhood of this
spot that a profusion of the transparent hollow
reeds and curling finger-like shapes are to be seen.
Not far from the Bride’s Chamber, and before
coming to it, there is a place where, across a deep
cleft, is to be seen a large white mantel, most
beautifully folded. On leaving the chamber from
which the Bride’s branches off, there are, on the
right hand, some fine sheets of stalactite, that can
be lit up from behind and thus made to show their
semi-transparency. Close to the entrance of the
gallery leading from the first large chamber there
stands an enormous stalagmite that is worthy of
notice. Another spot that is unique in its way is
the end of the passage that leads from the Bone
Cave, where there are some very pretty pillars.
The entrance into the Eider Cave is on the crown
of the ridge, about 70 yards north-west of the
Oarlotta Arch, This cave is highly interesting, as
it is filled in places with a pebble drift of the most
varied kind ; the pebbles differ in size from \ of an
inch to 1 foot in diameter; they are in places
covered with a deposit of carbonate of lime, and
are cemented together very compactly by the same
material. Some consist of quartz, granite, quartz
porphyry, Lydian-stone, slate, and sandstone. The
bottom of this cave is very difficult of access, but
the drift is seen to be at least 30 feet thick. This
drift should certainly be prospected. Near the
bottom of this cave are some very white stalactites
and stalagmites.
The sides of all the caves, where free from
stalactitic growth, were much corroded, though
not in the grooved manner exhibited by the lime-
stone where exposed to the rain ; they gave one the
idea of having been kept constantly covered with a
film of water, and doubtless the moist atmosphere
of the interior of the caves, when they contain
pools of water, is favourable to such a state. In
many places numbers of fossil coralline forms stand
out from the mass of the rock, no doubt from being
less easily dissolved by the carbonic acid in the
water; and in one place where there was a wallaby
track occurs a most highly-polished surface of rock.
It is almost startling to observe how crowded with
fossil forms it is. This rock would make very
ornamental and interesting paper weights, &c.
If visitors wanted a souvenir of the caves they
could desire nothing better than a piece of this
beautiful rock, of which there is a boundless
supply, and which can be so easily worked up into
articles of virtu.
It is a difficult task to name the points of special
attraction in these caves, where there is so much
both to interest and please ; the more so perhaps
as the relative excellence of a series of forms of
beauty must always be decided by individual
taste ; still one might point to the Easter Cave
as perhaps the most beautiful, as it certainly is
the grandest. This cave, too, possesses the double
advantages of daylight and an easy access, and
derives no small part of its charms from the
contrast between the wooded hillside, that is seen
framed by one of the massive arches, which give
this spot its grandeur; and, the stalagmitic
depositions which have been profuse, and which,
whether as the pinnacled column of stalagmite or
the gracefully folded “curtain stalactites,” and the
boulders covered with ripple-marks, that reflect a
thousand jets of light from the facets of the
crystals forming their surface, combine to form an
harmonious and pleasing picture. At one moment
the vastness and silence under the dome fix the
attention of the observer on the mute but beautiful
forms that Time has slowly amassed under it; at
the next the wild song of the lyre-bird re-echoes
through the vault, and draws the eye to the sunlit
forest slopes without.
And here it is perhaps not out of place to trace
some steps in the course of Time that are forcibly
presented to us. What a circle in the laws of nature
is suggested by this scene ! First, the decaying
vegetation of some ancient forest is invisibly dis-
tilling the gas known as carbonic acid ; then a
storm of rain falls, clearing the air of the noxious
gas, and distributing a thousand streamlets of acid
water over the surrounding country, and which as
it drams off, not only wears the rocks it passes over,
but dissolves them in minute quantities, especially
such as contain much lime, and then, laden with its
various compounds flows off to the distant sea,
where reef corals, lying in fringing banks round the
coast are slowly absorbing the lime from the water
around them, and building the fragile coatings that
protect them during life. Slowly as the land
sinks the coral bank increases in height, for


reef corals can only live near the surface of the
water; and soon a considerable thickness has been
obtained ; while below the upper zone of live corals
lies a vast charnel-house of dead coral coverings ;
then comes a change : suitable temperature, or
some other essential condition, fails, killing out all
the corals, and through long ages other deposits
accumulate over them, gradually crushing and
consolidating the coral bank into a firm rock. At
last a convulsion of the earth’s crust brings it up
from the buried depth in which it lies, leaving it
tilted on its edge, but still, perhaps, below the
surface of the ground ; rain, frost, and snow slowly
removes what covers it, until it lies exposed again
to the sunlight, but so changed that only for the
silent but irresistible testimony of the fossil forms
of which it is composed, it were hard to believe
that this narrow band of hard grey rock was once
the huge but fragile coral bank glistening in the
bright waters with a thousand hues. And now the
process is repeated ; the decaying vegetation of the
surrounding forest produces the carbonic acid,
the rams spread it over the ground, which is
now the most favourable for being dissolved, and
the consequence is that the acid water saturates
itself with the limestone rock, and whenever the
least evaporation takes place, has to deposit some
of its dissolved carbonate of lime in one of the
many stalactitic forms, before it can flow off to the
sea and distribute its remaining contents to fresh
coral banks.
Thus the old coral reef melts away far inland,
and the lime that formed the coatings of its corals
is again utilized for the same purpose. What a
simple succession of causes and effects, and yet
before the circle is completed long ages of time
have come and gone ; and what a fine example of
the balance between the waste and reproduction
that takes place in nature.
The huge arches under which the streams flow,
and the airy span of the Carlotta Arch, cannot fail
to excite the admiration of all observers.
