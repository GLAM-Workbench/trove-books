THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.
?'Euda /xcucdpcou
[Ntttrous] wKeavlfies
A upcu Trepnrveova?iu.
Pindar. Olymp. ii. 128.
On Albion?s shores, while blending shades of Eve
Their star-spread mantle in the twilight weave,
And whilst in peace it folds earth?s wearied breast,
And pales the amber glories of the West;
What if our thoughts, at that soft tranquil hour
That yields us captive to sweet Fancy?s power,
Transported from the fading scene, should run
The self-same course with the departing sun,
Should whisper then, that while he thus restores
Night?s gentle blessings to our heated shores,
To quench his fiery thirst he drinks the dew,
Deep in the plantain groves of Oahu. 1
That while our hills a length?ning shadow fling,
The wand?ring sea-bird, from his dripping wing,
1 Oahu and Morokai, two of the largest islands of the Sandwich
group. Oahu is remarkable for its fertility.


Scatters the briny drops of sun-lit spray
Over the coral rocks of Morokai. 1
Thus, as to musing thought these isles expand
In smiling contrast with our dark?ning strand,
They rise, as when night's shrouding pall withdrawn,
They hail?d the blush of young Creation?s dawn,
Beat back the envious billows? circling foam,
And rose rejoicing in their Ocean home.
Beautiful Isles! whose aery presence seems
To float before us in these waking dreams,
With what strange tales of Nature?s wondrous powers
Your wave-worn cliffs might charm the willing hours,
Could they set forth the story of their youth,
Or foil conjecture with the light of truth.
Whether creation?s throes disclosed their birth,
A common offspring with their kindred earth;
Or Nature?s self, in her impatience, check?d
The toiling worm,- ?her fairy architect?
Nor waiting till late ages should display
The growing isles that in her bosom lay,
Bade fire 3 and earthquake from the deep repair,
To cleave their upward pathway to the air,
2 The coral insect, whose operations are less conspicuous in the
neighbourhood of the Sandwich Isles than in that of many other
Islands of the Pacific.
3 Of the agency of fire in their construction, Ellis informs us that
" the whole island of Hawaii, covering a space of four thousand square


And led them forth?her pride?her latest boast ?
The youngest born of Ocean?s countless host.
But these are nature?s secrets, ?and they lie
Inscribed, where Roa?s 4 peaks assail the sky, ?
Traced in the torrents? path,-?on rifted rock
Graved by the lightning?s scath,?the earthquake?s
shock,
Or stamped still deeper on primeval stone
In characters to all, save One, unknown.
Nor less does humbler speculation fail
To knit the fragments of their broken tale,
Of whose past life, amid th? unconscious main,
Their graves the only records now remain.
Yes ! the lone chieftain, wandering by the sea
That binds the towering steeps of Hawaii, 5
Is now as silent of the dreamy past,
Or where his sires? less happy lot was cast,
As of the land where first the winds arose,
That bear their freight to Mouna 6 Kea?s snows,
miles, from the summit of its lofty mountains, perhaps fifteen or
sixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea, down to the beach,
is, according to every observation we could make, one complete mass
of lava, or other volcanic matter, in different stages of decomposition.?
Polynesian Researches, vol. iii. ch. 10.
4 ? Roa,? or ?Mouna Roa,? one of the loftiest mountains of Hawaii.
5 ? Hawaii,? in the old orthography ? Owhyhee,? is the largest
island of the Sandwich group.
0 In Cook?s Voyages, Captain King states that the peaks of Mouna


Or of the climes that first the seedling bred
Of the fair flower he crushes with his tread.
Strange that no legend, or memorial lay,
Though rude its music, should recall the day
When the light bark, that erst his fathers bore,
Grated its prow on pebbly shore, ?
When, willing exiles from their native land,
Or press?d by famine, or the spoiler?s hand,
Taught by the shell-borne Nautilus?their sail
Aloft they spread before the driving gale,
Sped o?er the waves, that wash?d them with their
spray,
No chart, ?no compass, marshalling their way,
And ending here their toils, ?forgot to roam?
And ?mid the waste of waters found a home.
How oft the summer?s heat, the winter?s showers,
Blest their long sojourn in their island bowers.
Kea appeared to be about half a mile high, and to be entirely covered
with snow.
? U Puna,? the sontli- western district of Hawaii, itself the most
western of the Sandwich Isles, to which, both on account of its situa-
tion and superior elevation, colonists are likely to have been attracted,
it it be true, as Ellis states, ? that the evidences are strongest in favour
of the derivation of their inhabitants from the Malayan tribes in-
habiting the Asiatic Islands.? See Polynesian Researches, vol. i.
c. 5.


Of these we know not, for the march of time
Pass?d unrecorded in that drowsy clime.
Lull?d in the haven of a calm repose,
Exempt from dangers, and secur?d from foes,
Supinely blest, no wants ?no cares had they
Beyond the cravings of the passing day ;
Enough for them that Nature?s bounty pour?d
Her wealth around them, ?an exhaustless hoard ;
For sustenance they neither sow�?d or till?d,
Or sought it but as wayward nature will?d :
Year after year, in that sweet solitude,
They saw her boon of summer fruits renew?d,
Watch?d the soft Uru?s 8 golden rind expand,
Till the ripe meal hung ready to their hand;
Stripp?d from the Auti?sS bark their warp and woof,
Found in the palm?s dark leaves a graceful roof;
Or where the Cocoa?s husky fruits decline,
Drank from its cup their unfermented wine.
Lords of those happy lands, where plenty yields
Spontaneous harvests from uncultur?d fields,
For them the beasts upon the mountains stray?d,
For them the wild fowl throng?d the forest glade;
?Twas theirs to snare the songsters of the wood,
To net the scaly tenants of the flood,
Urn,? the native name of the celebrated bread fruit.
9 For a description of the Auti, or cloth plant, and its uses, see
Poly. Res. vol. i. ch. 2.


Or guided by the torch, at close of day,
In dusky shallows to transfix their prey.
Yet light these labours, ?for they left them free,
To rove, as fancy willed, o?er land and sea, ?
To wander through the pathless wood, ?to lave
Their swarthy limbs in stream or crystal wave, ??
To dash in sport amid the blinding surf, ??
To thread the dance upon the moon-lit turf, ?
At morn to twine their hair with dewy flowers,
With song and jest to wake the drooping hours, ??
At noon to seek beneath the Aoa?s boughs,
A screen from heat, ?a shelter for repose. 10
Thus by no loftier joys or hopes inspir?d,?
Urged by no wants, ?by no ambition fir?d,
The current of their being pass?d away,
Like the still waters of the coral bay, 11
Scarce ruffled by the blasts whose fury hurl?d
Conflicting tempests o?er a troubled world.
10 For this description of the mode of living in the Islands, reference
maybe again made to the Polynesian Researches.?For their methods
of hunting and fishing, more especially by torch light,?their frequent
bathing, and the use of flowers in the decoration of their persons,
see vol. i. c. 6. For the use made of the leaves of the Palm tree in
thatching their houses, vol. i. c. 7. The amusement of swimming in
the surf, &c. is described, vol. iv. c. 14.
11 ? The surface of the water within the coral reef is placid and
transparent; while that without, if there be the slightest breeze, is
considerably agitated ; and being unsheltered from the wind, is ge-
nerally raised in high and foaming waves.? Poly. Res. vol. i. cap. 1.


Such was their lot that imaged forth the time
Of the world?s infancy and golden prime,
Had erring nature that sure pathway trod
That leads to happiness,-?that points to God.
But superstition?s phantom garb array?d
Wild shapes that scar'd them in the midnight shade,
As oft they saw, careering in the storm,
Borne on the blast, Tairi?s 12 meteor form,
Or watch?d the clouds whose bright?ning passage
Of Pele?s 13 revels in her mountain hold.
From thought of these, dark tree and rugged stone
Assumed rude shapes of terror not their own, ?
For these the Heiau?s gloomy fabric stood,
Deep?ning the horrors of some lonely wood ;
Nor e?en the whispering oaks in Mona?s dell,
Of darker rites, ?of sterner deeds could tell,
Than those reveal?d by the foul altar?s light
That gleam?d portentous on the brow of night;
12 ? The natives were very desirous to shew us the place where the
image of Tairi the war-god stood, and told us, that frequently in the
evening he used to be seen dying about in the neighbourhood, in the
form of a luminous substance like a flame, or like the tail of a comet.?
?Poly. Res. vol. iv. c. 5.
13 The natives believed the volcano at Kirauea to be the abode of
their goddess Pole.?For a description of the beautiful effect produced
upon the clouds that passed over it by night, when seen from a dis-
tance, see Poly. Res. vol. iv. c. 9.


When of the band of thronging priests around,?
Of idol forms with sacred cinet 14 bound, ?
Of those rude walls that caught the lurid glare,
Scarce aught seem?d human, save the victim, there.
Hence oft fell omens urg?d the kindling fight,
The strife of subtlety and savage might,
And Pari?s 15 ridges echo?d back the yell
Of those who struggling fought, or yielding fell.
Then was their burst destructive as the tide
Of fiery desolation, from the side
Of that tall mount, 16 whose giant shadow lay
Dark?ning the morn on green Kairua?s bay.
And if at times their passions, lull?d to rest,
Slept like the fires within the mountain?s breast,
No soft?ning impulse in their hearts arose,
As round the crater?s edge no verdure grows:
In such a soil affection withering died,
For all its springs were clos?d, ?its fountains dried.
No social bliss could cheer life?s dreary span,
For woman was the powerless slave of man :
14 The cinet with which the idols were covered, was a species of
rough matting made of the fibres of the bark of the Cocoa nut tree.
15 � T}, e p a n 0 f Aniianu was an important position in times of war,
and the parties in possession of it were usually masters of the island.
In its vicinity, the independence of Oahu was lost in or about the
year 1790.? ?Poly. lies. vol. iv. c. 1.
Mouna Huararai, in the side of which is situated the volcano of
Kirauea.


Few joys of offspring check?d the wish to roam,
Or cast a spell around his sullen home;
His infants? claims provok?d guilt?s foulest stain,
And stamp?d his portion with the curse of Cain.
Oft as the sleeping babe unconscious smil?d,
A mother?s yearnings pleaded for her child,
Yet heedless of her tears,- ?her prayers to save,
A father?s hand consign?d it to the grave,
To wake no more, until its spirit stand
In sweet communion with that glorious band
Of cherub angels, 1 ? who before the Throne
For that frail sinful race make aye their ceaseless moan.
Nor is that cry in vain,?though voiceless all
Heaven?s angel host, yet Mercy hears their call:
And Mercy?s answer is the whispering gale
That smooths the folds in yonder swelling sail,
And speeds in safety through the salt sea foam
That goodly vessel to its destin?d home.
Yes ! from the bosom of the Eastern wave
The ministers of Mercy come to save, ?
To those benighted islands to proclaim
The joyful tidings of a Saviour?s name.
Their fervent zeal has mark?d with deep?ning awe
How long those isles have waited for His law. 18
17 For the idea contained in these lines, the writer is indebted to
the author of ? The Pelican Island.?
18 ?And the Isles shall wait for His law.? Isaiah xlii. 4.


They come, ?for blessed promise to prepare
The glorious way to glad fulfilment there.
High are their hopes, as even now they keep
Their midnight watch upon the star-lit deep,
Still waiting till the Orient shall display
Its glowing presage of that brighter day,
Whose dawning beams on those fair lands shall quell
The powers of darkness and the fiends of Hell.
How blest these hopes,?what ample fruits repaid
Their after toils, through Mercy?s viewless aid,
Let the wild echoes of Raima tell,
Or Kona?s cliffs that breast the ocean?s swell,
For they have found a voice responsive there
To Christian accents breathing praise and prayer,?
Praise of the one true God, where once there stood
Tane?s altars reeking with the captive?s blood,
And prayer in solitudes, that heard alone
The victor?s shout, ?the victim?s dying groan.
Their Heiau?s walls, by native hands laid low,
Their purpose changed, a holier office know, ?9
And dark Idolatry no more may claim
Those temples sacred to Jehovah?s name.
19 At Kairua, Ellis relates that, while he was there, ? upwards of
fifty persons were employed in carrying stones from an old Heiau,
which they were pulling dorvn, to raise the ground, and lay the foun-
dation of a place of worship.??Poly. Res. vol. iy. c. 15.


Religion's soothing voice at length imparts
Her softening lessons to their savage hearts;
Oft, as the spirit of a breathless calm 20
Sleeps in the unsway?d shadows of the palm,
Beneath the grateful shade they sit, ?and tell
How Rono 21 thither came, ?how Rono fell; ?
And gentler promptings teach their lips, though late,
To bless his coming,?and bewail his fate.
What if no cenotaph enshrines his bones,
A nation?s gratitude their crime atones ;
Though with his laurels twine no poet?s bays,
A nobler anthem may proclaim his praise;
For oft the mariner, at close of day,
While mid those Isles he tracks his dark?ning way,
Hears, softly stealing through the twilight dim,
From yonder shores, the holy evening hymn,?
Wafting a happy presage to his ear,
That genial hearts and helping hands are near,?
That there a friendly welcome would be found,
Where Christian faith, and Christian laws have bound
In one wide brotherhood, ?one vast embrace, ?
The swarthy savage and his paler race,
?Links of that heavenly chain that Mercy wove.
To compass peace and harmony and love.
20 ? pei/ vqvepov ?yaAdyas."? .ffisch. Agam. 717.
21 ?Rono,? the name by which the natives designated the un-
fortunate Cook ; of whom they assert, that ?they thought he was
their god Rono, worshipped him as such, and after his death re-
verenced his bones.??Poly. Res. vol. iv. c. 5.


But twilight, scenes like these recall once more
Their parent mnsings on our island shore;
Albion ! to thee once more our thoughts incline,
From lands of which Discovery?s meed was thine,
In that proud day that bade a nation leap,
As ?twere a new creation, from the deep,?
That fill?d a blank on Nature?s living page,
To stand thy record to a distant age.
Yet is a loftier boast within thy power,
Than the chance glories of one happy hour ;
Fire from his centra! hearth the Grecian bore, 92
Who led his followers to a foreign shore;
But Albion?s sons to these lone isles have brought,
A gift that far surpass?d the Grecian?s thought, ?-
Fire from His shrine, whom earth and heaven obey,
And worlds to last when these have pass?d away;
No earthly flame that warms th? insensate clod,
But fire from altars of the living God.
22 Among other customs observed at the departure of colonists,
they were wont to take fire from the Prytaneum of the mother-
town ; and if ever that fire happened to be extinguished in the
colony, it became necessary to go back to the mother-city to rekindle
it. ?See Lurcher?s Notes to Herodotus, book i. chap. 14G ; book v.
chap. 42.
