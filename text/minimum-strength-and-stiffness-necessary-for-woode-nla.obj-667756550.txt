MINIMUM STRENGTH AND STIFFNESS NECESSARY FOR WOODEN
FLOORS IN HOUSES
By J. D. BOYD*
[Manuscript received July 6, 1964]
Summary
Factors influencing the satisfactory performance of wooden flooring in houses
are discussed, including the variability of its strength and the probabilities associated
with the loads that may be applied. Thus the necessary load-bearing capacity is
determined, and from an examination of data on the ultimate strength of flooring
materials, it is possible to indicate those with adequate strength. An alternative test
made by applying a fixed proof load to the flooring is shown to be unsatisfactory. The
assessment of the comfort of a floor, through the measurement of its stiffness, is also
considered. A proposed specification for testing and assessing the adequacy of flooring
is detailed in an Appendix.
I. INTRODUCTION
The use of suspended wooden floors is traditional in house construction in
Australia. Most houses are of one storey, and almost invariably the floor and
supporting system at ground level consist of three integrated, horizontally arranged
layers. The top layer is generally of flooring boards, which are laterally connected
by the interlocking of tongues and grooves, and nailed to joists. The joists are usually
at about 18 in. centres and supported from wooden bearers. Bearers are generally
at about 5 ft centres and carried by strip, pier, or stump footings, that in effect suspend
the floor above the ground. As a result of experience of satisfactory service during
long and widespread use of such floors, certain thicknesses and spans of flooring
have become widely adopted.
There is no Australian standard specification stating the details of flooring to
be used in a dwelling, or defining the performance required of a satisfactory floor,
but two factors of primary structural importance are generally recognized. The first
of these is the capacity of the floor to support the most severe loads likely to be
applied in service. The second factor is a subjective assessment of the “feel” or
acceptable stiffness of the floor.
No critical examination of the strength and stiffness necessary for flooring in
domestic buildings in Australia has been published since the study by Isaacs (1946)
at the Commonwealth Experimental Building Station (C.E.8.5.). He estimated and
discussed the most severe loads likely to be applied to a floor in a home, and the
required strength of flooring to ensure that it would not fail. The loads which he
proposed should be applied to test the flooring were substantially greater than the
expected maximum loads in a house; they included an allowance assessed by him
for the variability of timber, and one for the duration of the load. At that time, no
significant data on the actual strength of flooring, or on inadequate performance of

floors in service, were available to check the suitability of his suggested criteria of
adequacy.
Approximately 300,000,000 lineal ft of flooring (on the basis of 4 in. average
width of boards) is used annually in houses in Australia. A rational specification of
its necessary performance characteristics is therefore important. This was made
clear recently when, in the absence of a suitable standard or basis of assessment, some
building regulatory authorities ruled against the use of certain types of flooring that
had been used extensively in the past. Such rulings could have a significant effect on
the well-being of the timber industry, the cost of housing, and the national economy.
As no tests were made and no evidence of inadequate performance was offered to
support the discrimination, it appeared that the action had been taken on the suspicion
of insufficient strength or stiffness.
Since 1946, this Division has obtained considerable data from the application of
the C.E.B.S. proof tests which are described in the next section. In the circumstances
referred to above, it seemed desirable to make an immediate examination of all of
the test results, and also of evidence on acceptable strength and stiffness of different
types of flooring in houses. Subsequently this study was extended substantially to
include a re-examination of the necessary strength characteristics of flooring. In
addition, many more tests were made, this time to provide precise information on the
ultimate strength of the several types of flooring (rather than on its capacity to pass
the C.E.B.S. proof test). This investigation facilitated the making of rational judge-
ments on the structural adequacy of particular flooring materials, and on an efficient
test procedure to provide data for such assessments in the future.
II. THE C.E.B.S. PROOF TESTS OF FLOORING
Isaacs (1946) suggested that the strength of flooring should be such that any
part of it would withstand a localized live load of 400 lb, applied through the flat end
of a cylindrical tool of 0-80 in. dia. (0-5 sq in area) for 15 min. He also stated that
the test load should equal 1-75 times the localized live load, i.e. 700 lb, and this
should not cause any clear signs of incipient fracture or permanent deformation
within the 15 min period of its application, except that local indentation to a depth
not greater than in. or 10% of the thickness, whichever was the greater, would be
permissible. He specified that if there should be permanent deformation under the
load of 700 lb, then a load equal to 2 - 2 times the localized live load, i.e. 880 lb, should
be applied and sustained for 5 min without final failure occurring.
In respect to stiffness, Isaacs stated that the ratio of deflection of the flooring to
its span should not exceed 1 to 600, under a load of 80 lb per sq ft, but that for tongued
and grooved flooring, this load should be regarded as 80 lb per lineal ft of span and
carried by two boards.
From this C.E.B.S. specification it can be inferred that flooring would be
classed as adequate if it conformed with the requirements of strength and stiffness at
each of an unspecified number of points, whereas any lesser performance at even
a single point in the floor, no matter how many points were tested, would be regarded
as indicating inadequacy of the flooring generally.


III. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATION OF DATA FROM THE C.E.B.S. TEST
AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE
It was found that commercial qualities of Australian T. & G. hardwood
flooring of the standard | in. thickness invariably passed the proof test, even when
the joist spacing was increased from the conventional 18 to 24 in. In some tests, the
load on such flooring was increased beyond the C.E.B.S. acceptance level until
failure occurred, and it was then evident that the actual strength was substantially
greater than required. Similarly, it was demonstrated that, when supported by joists
at 18 in. centres, jarrah and “Tasmanian oak” flooring, which had been reduced
from the standard thicknesses to -fa in., would generally sustain the proof load,
although its stiffness on 18 in. joist spacing was not sufficient according to the C.E.B.S.
specification. Jarrah, mountain ash, alpine ash, and messmate stringybark (the latter
three species being marketed as Tasmanian oak or Tasmanian ash) have been used
extensively and very satisfactorily for flooring, although they are among the weakest
of Australian hardwoods so used.
End-matched flooring* of jarrah, of §§ in. thickness, failed to pass C.E.B.S.
tests made in 1947. Recently, additional tests were made on the current output of
end-matched flooring of radiata pine (D strength groupt), and also that of hardwoods
in C strength group including some of the species referred to above. These indicated
that such flooring did not have the strength required to pass the C.E.B.S. proof test.
These results of tests on end-matched flooring, particularly those of the various
hardwood species, are incompatible with a reputation of such flooring being com-
pletely satisfactory in service extending over some 25 yr. Indeed, the high standing
of end-matched jarrah and ash flooring of | in. thickness is such that many architects
specify this material in preference to standard T. & G. flooring. Experience with
end-matched radiata pine is less extensive, but this flooring also appears to have
given satisfactory service. The evident incompatibility of the C.E.B.S. test results
and the performance of flooring in service indicates the desirability of reassessing
strength requirements for flooring.
IV. PROBABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE OF FLOORING
Usually, a floor has certain zones which are weaker than the remainder; these
include narrow strips along the edges of T. & G. boards, areas on and around certain
types of defects, and discontinuities such as at end-matched joints. Thus in the
case of T. & G. flooring 4 in. wide, the probability of failure when a concentrated
load is placed within about \ in. of the edge of a board is greater than if it were
similarly located in respect to the span, but nearer the middle of the board. Ignoring
the effect of defects, these relatively weak edge-zones would occupy about 25 % of
the area of the flooring, and the corresponding probability of a single load landing
on such a zone is approximately 25%. Similarly, with defect-free T. & G. flooring
the position near mid-span tends to be weakest, but there is only a small probability
* End-matched flooring is T. & G. flooring that also has tongues and grooves on the meeting
ends of boards, so that end joints need not be located over joists.
t Australian timbers are classified in strength groups as defined in the Timber Engineering
Design Handbook (Pearson, Kloot, and Boyd 1962).


of the load being in this critical position. In a like manner, there is only a small
probability of the load being located at a weak discontinuity such as an end-matched
joint.
Because of the variability of defect-free timber, and of the kinds and sizes of
defects, and of the quality of the machining of the tongues and grooves and even
the boards as a whole, the weak zones will themselves vary in strength. Therefore
whether a particular load is likely to over-stress the floor depends on its magnitude
in relation to the minimum strength of the weak zones, the number of times it may
be applied, and the area of flooring which may be subjected to such applications.
In respect to the probability of critically loading a minimum strength zone, it should
be noted that successive applications within a small area of the floor, such as due to
variations in the location of a piano or sofa, will not appreciably increase the chance
of a critical load landing on a minimum strength zone; the significant probability
is that relating to the floor as a whole.
To make a precise estimate of the adequacy of a floor, it is necessary to have
sufficient test data to define the overall variability of its strength and the extent of
the weak zones. Then if the characteristics and probabilities of occurrence of the
maximum loads to which the floor may be subjected are known, it should be possible
to assess the probability of failure. To ensure good timber utilization, it is desirable
that the minimum acceptable strength be set as low as is possible while ensuring
a high probability of satisfactory performance of the floor in service.
V. MAXIMUM CONCENTRATED LOADS ON FLOORS IN SERVICE, THEIR DURATION AND
PROBABILITIES
(a) Types and Magnitude of Loads
Isaacs considered the most severe loads which were likely to be applied to
timber floors in houses. Some of the equivalent modern furniture loads may be
lighter, while others such as large refrigerators may be heavier, but the latter are
likely to be spread over larger areas. The concentrated loads were shown to be more
critical than probable distributed loads in respect to the strength of the flooring.
These loads included:
(i) a heavy person carrying a heavy load—3so to 400 lb total load;
(ii) an overcrowded sofa—3oo to 350 lb per front castor;
(iii) an upright piano—2oo lb per castor;
(iv) a player-piano—2Bo lb per castor;
(v) a piano trolley carrying an upright piano—2so to 350 lb/wheel;
(vi) a piano trolley carrying a player-piano—3so to 450 lb/wheel.
(b) Duration of Loads on Flooring in Service
After its initial location in a home, a piano is likely to remain in the one position
for a long time, often for many years. However, all the other severe loadings referred
to above are of short duration. The period for which a heavily loaded man has his
weight on any one small area of flooring is likely to be measured in seconds or less.


If he were stationary, his weight would tend to be well distributed over his feet, and
the intensity of loading would be comparatively low and unlikely to be critical.
A crowded sofa involves discomfort, and the duration of any extremely heavy
loading due to it is likely to be measured in minutes. When moving, a loaded piano
trolley will apply load to an individual small part of the floor for generally less than
a second, and it is unlikely to be stationary under load for more than a few minutes.
(c) Probability of a Load of Critical Intensity Being Applied to a Weak Zone in a Floor
The most likely of the above loads in the average house is that due to the
heavily loaded man, but the probability of its occurrence at the magnitude stated
above is quite low. However, a heavily loaded man may take a considerable number
of steps anywhere in a house, so there is a possibility, though not a high probability,
that he will step on a zone of minimum strength. Similarly, the occurrence of a castor
loading from a sofa that is as heavy as indicated above is likely to be rare and
restricted to the largest room in the house. The sofa may be moved occasionally,
but not while loaded, so that of the total area of the room in which it is placed, only
a few spots are likely ever to be subjected to the maximum loading of 350 lb on one
castor. The probability of this extreme load being applied to a weak spot in the
floor is therefore small.
As only about 500 to 600 new upright pianos are now sold in Australia each
year, whereas approximately 80,000 houses are built annually, the probability of
there being a piano in any particular modern house is small. Further, it appears that
most of the new pianos are appreciably lighter than the instruments considered by
Isaacs. Also, pianos are not often changed in location in a house, and so the
probability that their castors will land on a zone of minimum strength is not high.
The same argument applies to piano trolleys, and in addition their wheels are much
bigger and broader than castors, so the intensity of loading will be reduced accordingly.
In their permanent location in homes, the castors of pianos are now almost
invariably set on load-spreading cups, so that the intensity of loading of the floor
is very much less than would be applied by castors. Also, it is common now for
houses to have floor coverings, such as thick underfelt and carpet or paper underfelt
and linoleum, particularly houses likely to have pianos and large sofas. A few check
tests have indicated that such coverings tend to increase the effective area of dis-
tribution of castor and other “near point” loads, and thus reduce the probability of
damage to the floor. For the foregoing reasons, a high margin of safety against
damage due to the load of a piano or sofa is unnecessary.
Of all the new pianos sold in Australia each year, less than a dozen have the
automatic-playing mechanism. Because of its rarity, the effect of castor cups and
floor coverings in spreading the load, and the small chance of it resting on a low-
strength zone in the floor, the castor load of a player-piano can be regarded as non-
critical in the assessment of the adequacy of flooring generally.
The area of 0-5 sq in for the test tool proposed by the C.E.B.S. appears
satisfactory for a castor load on an uncovered floor. However, it seems highly
improbable that a man carrying a heavy load would apply the total load over an area


anywhere near as small as this, because full transfer of the weight of a heavy load to
one foot tends to occur only when that foot is substantially flat on the floor. If the
man were to apply the full load over an area as small as 0-5 sq. in., then it would be
likely to be effective for only a very short time in comparison with the usual duration
in a static load test. Thus the effective load-bearing capacity of wooden flooring
would be considerably increased, and the probability of failure would be very
significantly reduced. Consequently, whatever the probability and frequency of the
critical load at the level stated for a man, it is unlikely the intensity of loading over
a significant period would ever reach the value suggested by Isaacs, and it would of
course be very much below that of the C.E.B.S. test load.
VI. MINIMUM LOAD-BEARING CAPACITY REQUIRED OF FLOORING
Despite the qualifications of load intensities in the foregoing section, it will be
assumed in this section that the critical loads already listed may be applied to an
0-5 sq. in. area of the floor. On this basis, it appears that a floor would be adequate
if, at any point, it could sustain without damage a near-point load of 400 lb for
a few seconds, 350 lb for up to about half an hour, or 200 lb indefinitely.
For convenience, the load and duration combinations listed above will be
adjusted to the corresponding values of load for 2 to 3 min duration of test, i.e. the
duration likely in a simple test in which the load is increased steadily, as with a typical
testing machine. This will be done in accordance with the relation of strength of
wood to duration of load that was established by Wood (1951). The three critical
service loads therefore become test loads (of up to 2 or 3 min duration) of 360, 385,
and 360 lb, corresponding respectively to the heavily loaded man, the over-crowded
sofa, and the piano.
VII. MINIMUM STIFFNESS REQUIRED OF FLOORING
A satisfactory test of stiffness for flooring is more difficult to define precisely
than one for strength, as the level of acceptance depends on a subjective rather than
an objective evaluation. The recommendation made by Isaacs resulted from tests
made with the flooring fixed to joists supported throughout their length. He stated
that a variety of people walking over flooring of in. thickness concluded “that there
is little to choose between the comfort conditions of any of the floor joist spacings
from 15 to 26 in. for hardwood and 18 to 22 in. for cypress pine”. This lack of
definition is comparable with that observed in limited subjective tests made at this
Division with floor joists of long span.
There are indications that part of the limitation on definition in subjective
response is due to an interaction of stiffness and vibration characteristics of the floor
system. This was noted by Russell (1954), Hansen (1958), and Barnhoff et al. (1962);
it has also been observed in the tests made at this Division. The vibration factor
appears to become of increasing importance as the span is increased. It should not
be overlooked also, that with the conventional floor of a house, the feeling of comfort
or satisfactory reaction is subject to an interaction between the stiffness of the flooring
across the span between joists and the stiffness of the floor system as a whole, the
latter being influenced particularly by the deflection of the joists under load. Thus,

although general guidance on the minimum desirable stiffness of the flooring may
be helpful, certain limits on the application of such recommendations should be
recognized, i.e. any proposed criteria of sufficiency should not be interpreted as
independent, precise, or rigid.
Flooring boards of a wide range of species and stiffness have been used in
Australia, but there is no evidence that, in ground floors, any of the usual floorings
fixed to conventional subfloor members have inadequate stiffness. Therefore, at this
point in the paper it does not seem practical to set a minimum acceptable value based
on experience in service, for comparison with the test results.

VIII. TEST MATERIAL
The test material included flooring of several species and of standard T. & G.,
end-matched, and finger-jointed types. The boards were secured with two 2 in. by
12 S.W.G. nails to joists at 18 in. centres, so as to form test panels approximately
7 ft 6 in. long by 3 ft wide. Various widths and thicknesses of flooring boards were
tested, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2.

Species represented in the standard T. & G. flooring were mountain ash
(Eucalyptus regnans ), jarrah ( E. marginata ), radiata pine (Pinus radiata ), and cypress
pine ( Callitris calcarata ).
The end-matched T. & G. flooring was of jarrah, radiata pine, and Tasmanian
oak, which could have included mountain ash, alpine ash (E. gigantea ), and messmate
stringybark (E. obliqua). The lengths of boards varied from 30 in. to 12 ft.
Species represented in the finger-jointed flooring were radiata pine, alpine ash,
and Tasmanian ash. The glues used included P.V.C., casein, resorcinol, and urea.
The quality of the flooring boards varied somewhat with the species and the
date of supply. The T. & G. mountain ash flooring was supplied about 16 years ago.
Of this, boards of 2\ and 4J in. widths were classed as “merchantable” grade, and
the 5J in. boards were classed as “select” grade. The standard T. & G. jarrah flooring
was supplied in accordance with the Australian Standard Specification No. 27. The
T. & G. radiata pine was obtained from South Australia and classed as “first grade”,
while the cypress pine was “select”.
End-matched jarrah flooring was supplied about 15 years ago, and in accordance
with the Australian Standard A.S. No. 0-10 to 45-1948. The end-matched ash
(Tasmanian oak) flooring was supplied in 1962 by two different manufacturers, and
its quality was “select”. End-matched raidata pine flooring was supplied in 1962,
and in accordance with Specification A.S. 0-73 (1960).
The finger-jointed radiata pine was supplied in 1962. This was of standard
quality boards 3$ and 4 in. wide, and included finger-jointed lengths as short as 8 in.;
it was glued with P.Y.C. An additional sample of similar quality 4 in. wide boards
of finger-jointed radiata pine was received in 1963. However, this material was
deliberately obtained without any of the joints glued, although otherwise it was
regular production flooring. A normal production sample of first-grade finger-jointed
“ash” flooring was received in 1963, and another batch of jointed but unglued ash
boards of like quality was obtained at the same time. The alpine ash flooring was of
similar quality, and was manufactured several years ago.
At the time of testing, all the flooring was well seasoned; for example, the
jarrah boards were at 11 *O% moisture content, while the radiata pine ranged from
12-4% for the 6 in. boards to 12-9% for the 4 in. boards.
The thickness of the nominal H in. jarrah T. & G. boards was within 1 % of
0-85 in. Thickness of the T. & G. mountain ash boards was up to 5/ Q greater and
1 % less than the nominal § in. Other flooring tested approximated the same tolerances
on thickness.
IX. METHOD OF TEST
(a) Strength Tests
The test load was applied to the floor through the flat end of a cylindrical tool
of 0-5 sq in cross-sectional area. In general, the loading force was supplied by
means of an hydraulic testing machine, the moving cross-head of which was in
contact with an off-set beam through a knife edge, as indicated in Figure 1. A four-
to-one lever system was used with the off-set beam, and the load applied to it was


registered by the normal load-indicating system of the testing machine. The inden-
tation at the point of loading was indicated by the dial gauge shown in the figure.
For the standard T. & G. flooring, the load was applied at the centre of the
span between joists, and either over the centre of the board, or over the T. & G.
joint between boards. With due consideration to avoiding any effect of adjacent tests,
the maximum practical number of points of critical strength, i.e. those at the mid-span
positions between joists, were loaded to failure. The strengths of boards in the end
spans, and those of the edges of the panels, were included in the test data.
Fig. 1.—Strength test on flooring panel with off-set loading beam and testing
machine.
With the end-matched boards, a similar plan of testing was followed. Generally
the loading was applied in the immediate vicinity of the end-matched joints, and
although most of those tested were located at mid-span, some were located near the
joists. However, in the case of the end-matched flooring of radiata pine, some
additional tests were made half-way between joints at mid-span and the joists.
The finger-jointed flooring was tested by loading at the joints, when these were
at or near mid-span, and at mid-span or on the joint when the joints were near the
joists. Joints near the edges of the panels were included in the tests.
(b) Stiffness Tests
Generally a distributed load of 120 lb was applied by means of 20 lb and 10 lb
shot bags laid over two adjacent boards and between two adjacent joists at 18 in.
centres. The deflection of the flooring at the centre of this area was measured by


means of a dial gauge supported above the floor. In the case of end-matched flooring,
the uniformly distributed load was applied to two lines of boards, but these were
selected so that the end-matched joint in one line of boards was at mid-span, and that
in the adjacent line of boards was within 4 in. of mid-span.
The deflection pattern across a number of boards, as a result of the application
of the concentrated load, was measured by a group of gauges such as shown in Figure 2.
On some other flooring, tests of deflection as a result of a concentrated load were
compared with similar tests with the distributed load.

X. TEST RESULTS
(a) Strength Tests
(i) Standard T. &G. Flooring.— The results of strength tests on standard T. &G.
flooring, with the concentrated load applied at the centre of the span, are shown in
Table 1. Also included are estimates of the standard deviations and the 1 and 5%
lower probability limit values.
Generally there is some difference in the results for positions of loading over
the T. & G. joints as compared with the centre of the width of the boards. Where
significant differences exist, data for the two positions have been shown separately,
otherwise results for different positions in the test panels have been combined to
obtain the mean values and the lower probability limits. However, nowhere are the
values for the two positions widely different.
It will be noted that the mean strength and the minimum values in the critical
load positions, even in the case of the -j|- in. flooring, are very considerably in excess
of the test loads corresponding to the most severe service loads (Section VI). For all
of this material, the variability in the maximum load is similar to that for standard
tests on the same species (Bolza and Kloot 1962).


(ii) End-matched Flooring. —For end-matched flooring, similar data to that
referred to in (i) above have been shown in Table 2. In addition, values of the load at
first evidence of distress in the floor (“first failure”) have been noted. Table 3 includes
the lower probability limit values for the data in Table 2.
For the end-matched jarrah flooring, the strength at an end-matched joint
just clear of the joist was found to be significantly higher than the strength with the
joint at the centre of the span. Therefore lower probability limits have been given for
each of the positions, as well as for the combined data.
For end-matched radiata pine flooring, the mean strengths are given for all
points tested, the positions of tests being illustrated in diagrams {a) to ( g ) in Figure 3.
Fig. 3. —Test load positions for end-matched T. & G. radiata pine flooring.
The 1 and 5% lower probability limits given in Table 3 were calculated from the
values obtained at position {a), and also from {a) and ( b ) combined. This was done
because positions {a) and ( b ) approximated the weakest position in the floor, many
more data on strength were available for (a) than for any other point, and the number
and distribution of points in the floor area, for which test data were obtained, could
not be claimed to represent the probable frequencies of strength that were fully
representative of all points in the floor. The combination of all data constituted
a non-normal distribution, and therefore lower limits for this combination have not
been quoted. The tabulated probability values were obtained from a logarithmic
transformation of the data.
To facilitate comparison of the foregoing data on radiata pine with data from
two panels of flooring of this species which were subject to the C.E.B.S. proof test
only, the results of the latter are given in Table 4.
It appears from Table 2 that end-matched flooring of all species has adequate
strength, as the minimum values of ultimate loads for each species listed are con-
siderably greater than the required basic test loads as determined in Section VI.

data contrast with those for radiata pine in Table 4, the latter indicating that according
to the C.E.B.S. test this flooring has insufficient strength. It was mentioned in Section
* See Figure 3.


11l that end-matched jarrah and other C strength group hardwoods similarly failed to
pass the C.E.B.S. test, but Table 2 shows that such flooring has strengths considerably
in excess of the required basic test loads.
As might be expected, in view of the sharp discontinuities at unsupported joints,
the data in Table 2 for several critical test positions combined have somewhat greater
variability than those from standard tests of defect-free timber. However, data for
a particular test position, such as (a) in Figure 3, show comparatively little variability
even with a material as intrinsically variable as plantation-grown radiata pine.
No doubt this is due to defects generally being eliminated from the region of the joints.
(iii) Finger-jointed Flooring. —ln no case in which the C.E.B.S. test was applied
to finger-jointed flooring (see Table 4) did this material fail to pass; the reason has
been made evident by the data on strength given in Table 5. Although there was
a relatively low load of 500 lb at first distress in one joint in Tasmanian ash, the
lowest load at ultimate failure had a very big margin over the required basic test
load determined in Section VI. The minimum ultimate load for radiata pine also
showed a large margin over the basic load.
Tests made on both ash and radiata pine, that had been finger-jointed but not
glued, showed that this material was likely to have adequate strength for house floors.
(i b) Stijfness Test
The results of the C.E.B.S. tests of stiffness of various types of flooring are
shown under (a) in Table 6. It will be noted that with the exception of the in.
thick jarrah flooring fixed to joists at 18 in. centres, the average values generally have
an ample margin over the acceptance level of the ratio of deflection to span (1 in 600)
proposed by Isaacs. Most of the minimum values also have a good margin over the
acceptance level.
Of the standard floorings, T. & G. radiata pine boards of 6 in. width have the
least margin over the minimum suggested in the C.E.B.S. specification, but the 4 in.
boards are only a little stiffer. The T. & G. hardwood floorings each have a wide
margin above this reference value, although they are little stiffer than the finger-
jointed flooring materials; the end-matched hardwood and radiata pine floorings
occupy intermediate positions of apparently ample stiffness. It may be noted also
that the finger-jointed flooring that was deliberately left with the joints unglued has
adequate stiffness according to the C.E.B.S. criterion.
If the performance of all flooring were assessed on the basis of the application of
a distributed load of an intensity of 80 lb/ft on a strip 12 in. wide, the values given
under (Z>) in Table 6 would be indicative of the relative stiffness of the different
materials. These are not experimental values, and probably they do not allow
precisely for differences in each floor in the reactions of adjacent boards loaded only
indirectly through the side joints; however, they suggest that even the in. jarrah
flooring may have adequate stiffness.
Some deflections of flooring were measured under concentrated loads applied,
as in the strength tests, to the point at mid-span between joists and on the side joint
between two lines of boards. In the glued and unglued finger-jointed flooring, and

in the end-matched flooring, there were joints in three adjacent lines of boards, and
in each case the load was applied to joints in two of these adjacent lines that had
end-joints at mid-span. These data, summarized in Table 6, were obtained only for
radiata pine and ash boards between 3 and 4 in. wide.
In the case of the T. & G. and the finger-jointed flooring, a concentrated load
of approximately f of the C.E.B.S. distributed load produced the same deflection.
On end-matched boards, it appeared that a concentrated load of approximately of
Table 6
STIFFNESS* OF FLOORING
the distributed load produced the same deflection. For the range of loads used in
this test, the variability arising from experimental errors plus the normal variation
in the flooring was considerable—as much as i 15% of the mean concentrated load
for a deflection corresponding to that given in the C.E.B.S. test. Similar variability
was noted in tests using the distributed load. For flooring with unsupported joints,
* These estimates of stiffness are ratios of maximum deflection to span, when (a) the flooring
is loaded on two boards with 80 lb per lineal ft over the span between joists, and ( b ) where the fore-
going stiffness values are adjusted in the ratio of 12 to 2 by width of boards, i.e. on the assumption
that the test load intensity of 80 lb/sq ft is spread over 1 ft width instead of two boards.
t Concentrated load (lb) applied at centre of span to cause a deflection to span ratio of 1 in 600.
t These finger-jointed boards were deliberately left unglued, though otherwise machined and
assembled as for normal finger-jointed flooring. Five of the eight tests on radiata pine were made
on two adjacent boards with joints near the centre of the span.


such as in end-matched boards, it was shown that any system of determination of
deflection that involved preloading, as with the off-set beam illustrated in Figure 1,
could lead to an incorrect classification of the flooring with respect to loads likely to
be significant in a subjective test.
XI. DISCUSSION
(a) Strength of Flooring
Where dependable structural performance is required, as in flooring, the average
strength of the material is of less importance than the distribution of strength values
and the probabilities associated with the occurrence of low values. To obtain adequate
data on the variability of strength of flooring, a considerable number of points must
be tested to failure. Further, the flooring to be tested must have been properly
selected, usually by a random process, to ensure that it is representative of the
population of material of its particular type. In addition, the test floors should contain
a proper representation of zones as weak as could be experienced occasionally in
houses. By using the data from such tests, an estimate may be made of the probability
of the flooring having a strength such that damage is unlikely under a given test or
service load.
With some classes of flooring, it is highly probable that the lowest values of
strength are associated with a special feature of the flooring, such as end-matched
joints. This will be clear from comparisons of data in Tables 1 and 2, and also from
the values of strength obtained at various positions in the end-matched radiata pine
flooring. For such materials, not only would it be necessary to make tests at a very
large number of points selected at random, but the distribution of strength for the
whole floor would be unlikely to be normal, and therefore it would be difficult or
impracticable to obtain dependable lower probability limits.
If the distribution of strength is unlikely to be normal, it is prudent to con-
centrate testing on the weak areas. When sufficient points of likely weakness have
been tested, it is possible to estimate their mean strength, variance, and lower prob-
ability values. Estimates may then be made of the probability of critical service loads
being applied to the weak zones. Thus the minimum acceptable strength of such
areas may be determined.
The probability of critical stresses being developed, and the likelihood of
failure occurring in service, cannot be estimated accurately; however, experience of
timber structures generally, and also the performance of flooring under service
conditions, can provide considerable guidance. It is convenient to discuss the most
unfavourable situation first in respect to the weakest flooring material.
It is clear from the tables and the other results given, that the end-matched
flooring is the weakest of the several types examined, with the radiata pine being
somewhat weaker than the hardwoods. From the results for end-matched radiata
pine given in Table 2, it is apparent that of 53 joints located at the most critical position
(or 60 joints if the strength at positions (a), ( b ), (c), and ( d ) (Fig. 3) are considered
to be of the one population), the weakest (540 lb) had a very substantial margin of
strength over the critical test load of 360 lb suggested in Section VI. The 1 / Q lower
probability limit value for ultimate strength at positions (n) and ( b ) also has a margin


of about 50% over this somewhat generously assessed reference load. Similarly, in
respect to the load at first failure, the 1 % lower limit has approximately a 20% margin
above the critical test load.
In the design of major engineering structures to be built with timber, a sub-
stantial probability of failure of any single member cannot be accepted, as it could
lead to the failure of the whole structure, with a possible hazard to the life of persons
in, on, or near it. Yet, for the material in such structures, it has been found generally
satisfactory to use the 1 % lower probability value for its intrinsic strength, when
deriving working stresses. That is because the satisfactory performance of structures
designed with such basic stresses shows that this probability, when combined with
all the other probability factors operating simultaneously, leads to an improbability
of failure during the service life, i.e. the overall probability of failure is so low that
it is readily acceptable. Some of the factors and their probabilities for flooring have
been discussed in Sections IV and V. The interaction of similar factors in timber
members of structures has been discussed by Wood (1958). Although precise values
cannot be given for most of the individual factors, it seems probable that their com-
bination for flooring would be comparable with that for scantling as discussed by
Wood.
In houses, an isolated local failure within a floor, due to puncturing or similarly
limited damage to one comparatively weak board subjected to an unusual load,
would be of considerably less consequence than the failure of a major engineering
structure. It would be relatively simple, and not costly, to repair such a failure of
a floor, and meanwhile generally it would cause little inconvenience. On the other
hand, an effort to obviate its occurrence in unusual circumstances would require an
excessive margin of strength generally, i.e. the specification of an unduly high com-
bined probability against failure of flooring would seriously affect the economy of
building.
If we disregard the effect of all other probability factors that are operating, it
will be clear from the test data and what already has been said, that the 1 % lower
probability limit calculated for the minimum strength positions (a) and ( b ) (Fig. 3
and Table 2) in end-matched flooring of radiata pine, for example, would considerably
over-estimate the probability of failure in both a more general load test and in service.
This is because there would be a high probability of the load being applied at positions
of higher strength than (a) and (b). Thus if the 5 % lower probability limit for the
weak zones were taken, this would more nearly represent the desirable probability
in respect to the strength of the floor as a whole, if the latter were set at the 1 % value.
Insufficient data are available to check the precision of this substitution, but use of
the 5 % value is unlikely to involve any significant risk of inadequate strength. Apart
from this, it could be argued that the acceptance of a small risk of local damage to
the floor should not be unreasonable. Indeed the acceptance of such a risk is implicit
in the acceptance of general building practice and site hazards,* as they affect the
* Limited failures occur occasionally as a result of very difficult foundation conditions, poor
workmanship or methods in the construction of houses, or for causes other than inadequate strength
under normal conditions; for example, local failures may result from decay due to insufficient
subfloor ventilation, or from termite attack due to insufficient protection.


nerformance of houses in general, and flooring in particular. Relative to the parallel of
engineering structures, the above considerations may well justify an appreciably less
conservative lower probability limit for the weak zones in flooring than the 5 / 0 value.
It might be thought that for a flooring of sheet material such as plywood, in
which there may be no obviously weak zones, the full justification outlined above
for the use of the 5% lower probability limit may not apply. However, considering
all the factors, there seems to be little doubt even in this case, that the use of the 1 / G
value would be unduly conservative, and the 5 % value not unreasonable.
For the weakest standard flooring of end-matched radiata pine, the 5 % lower
probability limit indicates a quite substantial margin of strength m respect to the
basic test loads discussed in Section VI. This is apparent both at the point of ultimate
failure and at the load corresponding to first evidence of significant damage to the
flooring. End-matched flooring of other species has a rather higher strength. C ear y
too, finger-jointed flooring has a large margin of strength, and standard T & G.
flooring has very considerable strength in excess of the basic reference load. If it
were desirable to be so conservative as to check that the 1 % lower probability value
was in excess of the basic test loads, the above general remarks on adequacy of the
several types of flooring would not be altered.
The view that the strength of end-matched flooring of radiata pine and C
strength group hardwoods is adequate for houses, as deduced herein from con-
sideration of severe loads that might be applied in service, the measured strength of
the flooring, and estimates of the probabilities associated with its satisfactory-
performance, is well supported by practical experience. Indeed, in many thousands of
houses a total of many millions of lineal feet of end-matched flooring has been used,
and these floors have apparently been satisfactory in service extending over many
years. From the strength data it seems quite possible, and indeed probable, that
flooring of somewhat lower strength than the weakest now used extensively in houses
would be satisfactory. However, this cannot be stated positively, without evidence of
substantial tests of such a material in regular use, to supplement deductions from
data such as are given herein.
(b) Stiffness of Flooring
The stiffness test has been proposed as a means of classification of flooring
according to the subjective feeling of comfort when walking across it, or possibly
according to a reaction to somebody walking across an adjacent section of the floor.
It is convenient to discuss the acceptable stiffness first in connection with material of
comparatively low rigidity. As in. hardwood flooring has been used virtually
in an experimental sense and in a very limited number of houses, it cannot be used
as a general guide, although there is some indication that it is acceptable. T. & G.
flooring of radiata pine, in i n - thickness, is used extensively in South Austra la
particularly, and although its stiffness may be low in comparison with | in. hardwood
floors, as indicated in Table 6, apparently it is quite acceptable. It provides the
best available guide on a lower limit of acceptability which is based on substantia
practical experience. The stiffness of this flooring, when used over an 18 in. span,
approximates the minimum value of 1 in 600 recommended in the C.E.B.S. test.


It is not clear from his published recommendation whether Isaacs intended that
the mean or the minimum values of stiffness should be given more weight in deter-
mining the acceptability of flooring. However, in respect to structures generally
the mean is used in estimates of deflection, and, as normal variations from the mean
are not likely to be critical in an inexact subjective assessment, it is reasonable to
adopt the mean for the classification of flooring. In a private communication, Isaacs
stated his agreement.
In the C.E.B.S. paper, it is stated that the load of 80 lb per lineal ft that is
applied in the stiffness test should be concentrated on two adjacent boards. This
leads to an intensity of loading on boards of 2 in. width, that is, three times that on
boards of 6 in. width. It is difficult to see the justification for such a proposal, as the
distributed load could be effective in indicating the grading in a subjective test, only
if it were a proper substitute for a concentrated load. Further, it is unlikely that two
concentrated loads of high intensity would fall as close as 2 in. apart in a subjective
test, as appears to be implied by the C.E.B.S. restriction on loading of narrow boards.
Numerous data (unpublished) on load distribution in flooring have been
obtained by this Division. These show a significant transfer of forces to boards
adjacent to those subject to a concentrated load. Deflection measurements indicate
that, for different widths of boards, the effect of the force distribution from a con-
centrated load is evident 5 to 6 in. to each side of the load; a similar distribution
could be expected to the side of a distributed strip load. If the fully effective transfer
were half this width to each side of the uniformly loaded strip, then the load applied
to two 6 in. boards would be effectively carried by a strip of flooring 18 in. wide,
whereas with 2 in. boards, the same total load would effectively be carried by a strip
10 in. wide. Therefore if the deflection due to a distributed load were effective in
assessing the comfort of flooring, the real index may more nearly approach ( b ) than
(a) in Table 6.
However, any subjective feeling of excessive springiness or discomfort of
a floor generally arises from its deflection and the vibrations occurring in it, when
someone walks on it. For some types of flooring and some locations thereon, it is
debatable whether the deflection under a uniformly distributed load would provide
a realistic index of that feeling. Therefore it may be more rational to assess the
stiffness of flooring in conjunction with the application of a concentrated load, which
might be taken to represent the critical part of the foot of a person. In such cases,
the concentrated load should be applied to the most flexible positions in the floor,
independently of the width of the boards. There would be an obvious advantage if
the loading tool for the strength tests could be satisfactorily used in the stiffness test.
Although data on stiffness obtained from the application of concentrated loads were
limited, they showed that generally there was a good correlation with the data from
distributed load tests. However, it was indicated that a concentrated load may cause
a relatively greater deflection at a discontinuity such as a poor end-joint, and this
might well be coincidental with a feeling of excessive local springiness of the floor or
discomfort when stepping on this point. Such a test may therefore direct attention
to a characteristic weakness, or to the necessity of better quality control during
manufacture of flooring, which on average stiffness values could be adequate when


assessed with either the distributed load or the concentrated load test. This suggests
that, although it may be best usually to estimate the stiffness of flooring as the average
of a substantial number of values, consideration should be given to extreme values
if these are likely to be appreciably below the general acceptance level.
As it is practicable, when making the strength test, to measure deflections and
simultaneously assess stiffness, there would be merit in adopting this procedure as
standard. In this way, sufficient tests should be made to obtain dependable results,
despite the fact that with simple equipment and measuring techniques the variability
over the range of loads that is important in the stiffness test may be of the order of
±15% of the mean, for floors of relatively uniform quality.
Material which is very thin and springy, for example, \ in. thick plywood
supported at 18 in. centres, would not generally meet the desires of people for a good
“solid” floor, although it may support most loads. On the other hand, if the flooring
were made very stiff, as with the typical combination of subfloor and “finish” floor
which is generally used in North America and elsewhere, the floor system as a whole
would not necessarily be acceptable. If there were excessive deflection of the joists
in such a system, it would produce a feeling of considerable springiness. Russell
(1954) discussed this problem but Barnoff et al. (1962) concluded that further research
was required. Similarly, no means of assessing the significance of vibrations in
a floor system has yet been proposed.
Pending the availability of data from a more comprehensive study of the several
factors influencing the feeling of comfort of floors, the stiffness of the flooring alone
might best be regulated by setting a standard likely to give results which are generally
comparable with those of the C.E.B.S. test. A test with a concentrated load of 75 lb
applied through the tool used in the strength test is therefore proposed. The pro-
visional acceptance level is that on average this test should not cause a deflection
greater than 1/600 of the span of the flooring between joists.
Meanwhile it is clear from the general performance of the flooring in service,
and in line with the test data discussed above, that end-matched and T. & G. floorings
of radiata pine, when supported on joists at 18 in. centres, are generally acceptable
with usual spans of joists in ground floor construction; in Australia, these joists
are usually designed for a deflection of not more than 1/360 of span with a floor
loading of 40 lb/sq ft. At the same time, it is seen from Table 6 that there may be
a very wide difference in the stiffness of different samples of radiata pine flooring
that cannot be explained by the type of flooring. Similar differences with this species
have been noted in other tests, where generally it has been shown that material cut
from fast-grown, immature trees tends to be low in stiffness; the low values for the
6 in. and 4 in. wide T. & G. boards tested some years ago may be explained in this
way. The finger-jointed flooring proved to be adequate in the concentrated load test,
even when the joints were deliberately left unglued. However, it is unlikely that
quite as good a result would have been obtained if the joints had not been well
machined and tightly fitted.
It should not be overlooked that a subjective assessment of the performance of
a floor can be affected by any sound it may make in use. Thus badly machined or


fitted end- or side-joints, even in flooring more than sufficiently stiff to pass a load
test, could give rise to a bias against its use.
XII. General Conclusions on a Rationalization of Tests of Flooring
On the basis of the foregoing investigation, it is possible, as discussed below,
to suggest a rational approach to the testing and assessment of flooring. In accordance
with this, Kloot (see Appendix) has developed a practical procedure for the purpose.
(a) Strength Tests
A proof-test procedure of the type suggested by Isaacs is not generally satis-
factory for research laboratories, or for those persons interested in a precise knowledge
of the properties of the flooring. Not only does it not provide as much information
as test to failure, but it is not an efficient type of test for ensuring that only unsatis-
factory types or qualities of flooring are rejected. This is well illustrated by the fact
that this test would reject end-matched flooring which, according to experience in
use, and also the assessment of probable loads and strength as discussed herein,
appears to have more than adequate strength. On the other hand, the ability of
a substantial number of specimen floors to pass a go or no go proof test, in which
the test load is not set with consideration to the number of points tested and the
variability of the material, does not provide an assurance of satisfactory strength.
It does not even offer the assurance of a high probability that other floors of the
particular type will be satisfactory, or that they may not contain zones weaker than
those that have been proof tested.
A test of this type may be useful for purposes of quality control of a particular
material, especially if testing equipment to provide more information is lacking.
At best, however, the result can be regarded only as indicative. Further, it will be
useful only if the value of the fixed load is set after extensive studies of the variability
of the material, as has been illustrated herein.
To estimate the adequacy of a new type of flooring, about 25 tests at the points
of greatest probable weakness are the least that should be undertaken as a basis of
calculating reliable lower probability limit values, although a considerably lesser
number may indicate the potential adequacy of the flooring. The suitable number
for either purpose depends on the variability of the material, and the apparent margin
of strength over the maximum probable service loads.
For floorings of sheet materials which have no obvious zones of weakness, for
example, plywood or boards of reconstituted wood,* the points of application of
the load should be selected at random, except of course they should not be over the
joists or similar supports. With such materials, the strength and variability of small
specimens loaded in a testing machine may give a reliable indication of the variability
of the sheet, when it is subjected to a concentrated load test, providing all joints in
* For flooring materials other than those for which considerable knowledge of satisfactory
performance in service is available, it may be necessary to do additional special tests to assess their
probable long-term performance. In addition, joining and fixing may have to be considered to avoid
the development of squeaks due to a moving load.


the floor are fully supported. This would reduce the amount of testing required to
establish its load-bearing capacity in the panel form, and thus the number of tests to
determine the acceptability of the product as proposed for use as flooring material.
For certain classes of flooring, the foregoing methods may be extended to
facilitate a relatively quick assessment of their potential serviceability. Thus, according
to different coefficients of variability of the material, as may be approximated from
the results of only a few tests on the flooring, it is possible to determine a provisional,
minimum, acceptable value of the mean load-bearing capacity. If this provisional
value were exceeded in the few exploratory tests, it would indicate the probable
adequacy of the flooring, although this would be subject to confirmation in a more
extensive investigation to establish lower probability values.
(b) Stiffness Tests
The stiffness of the flooring material has sometimes been considered as con-
trolling the comfort or acceptability of the reaction of the floor. However, such
a subjective assessment is influenced also by the stiffness of the subfloor system,
the vibration-damping characteristics of the floor, and any tendency of the joints to
squeak with a moving load. As inadequate data are available to determine precise
acceptance levels for any of these factors taken separately, and also in combination,
a provisional recommendation will be made only in respect to the stiffness of the
flooring in a conventional ground floor construction.
While the C.E.B.S. test using a distributed load can provide a basis of classifying
the stiffness of floors on average values, a concentrated load test is likely to be more
sensitive to poor or loosely fitted joints. It will thus indicate any need for improved
quality control during the manufacture or fitting of the floor, as well as providing
a means of assessing its stiffness from the average deflection of a number of points
tested.
It is recommended that the stiffness test be made with the standard loading tool
applied at a considerable number of points in the floor. Where there are obvious
points of comparative weakness, such as over T. & G. joints, at end-matched joints
or finger-joints, these should be tested. A considerable number of such tests should
be made at mid-span between joists. Preferably the total number of points so tested
should be comparable with those subject to the strength test, i.e. of the order of 25,
but a lesser number may be sufficient, as precision in the estimate of this property
is generally of less consequence than precision in the estimate of strength. Provision-
ally it is considered that under a load of 75 lb, the average deflection at the most
flexible positions in the floor should generally be less than about 1/600th of the span.
Individual values as low as 1 /450th of the span could point to the need of better
quality control.
XIII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
(a) A test made on an area of 0-5 sq in, with the load increased steadily to
cause failure in a period of approximately 2 or 3 min, provides a sound basic means
of assessment of the minimum acceptable load-bearing capacity of floors.


(b) The test should be applied at a sufficient number of points, in the weakest
zones of the floor, to enable the calculation of dependable lower probability strength
values for such zones.
(c) On the basis of theoretical argument, the load-bearing capacity of the
flooring may be adequate if the 5 % lower probability value for the critically weak
zones in the floor is greater than 360 lb, but judged on experience of floorings in
service, it is clearly adequate if the 5 % value for such zones equals 590 lb, and the
corresponding value for first failure equals 470 lb.
(d) A proof test with a fixed load can be misleading in assessing the adequacy
of the flooring, especially if the test is made on only a few points.
(e) Insufficient data are available to assess the critical levels of all factors
affecting the comfort of floors. However, a concentrated load test is more useful
than a distributed load test. It can determine both general acceptability of flooring
in conventional ground floor construction, and also the need of quality controls to
improve the efficiency of jointing.

APPENDIX
SPECIFICATION FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURAL
ADEQUACY OF FLOORING FOR DOMESTIC USE
By N. H. KLOOT*
1. Scope
This specification deals with means for assessing materials to determine their
serviceability, from the point of view of strength and stiffness, for use as domestic
flooring.
It will be noted that the specification envisages two stages in this assessment.
The first or exploratory stage is intended to assist a manufacturer interested in the
development of a new flooring material when some initial assessment of the potential
of the product is desirable. Alternatively, the first stage may be used as a specification
testing procedure for a material previously proven to be generally adequate structurally,
to ensure that a particular batch or batches of this material complies with the specifi-
cation. The second stage provides for a full-scale set of tests to establish, for the
benefit of local building authorities and others concerned with the standard of
performance of domestic structures, that a particular material has sufficient strength
and stiffness for its use as flooring.
Compliance with this specification alone does not necessarily mean that a
particular flooring material will be totally adequate. Resistance to abrasion and
indentation, and the effect of wetting or high humidity are not considered, nor is any
reference made to tests for serviceability over a long period. Such tests have been
omitted to avoid precluding the use of any material, the intrinsic properties of which
may not be entirely adequate alone, but when used in combination with other
materials, could provide a satisfactory floor. For instance, a material with a relatively
low surface hardness, if properly treated or covered with carpet or vinyl tiles, could
well give an acceptable performance. The difference between good and bad building
practices could mean the difference between a long and short service life for many
flooring materials. It is therefore emphasized that characteristics other than structural
adequacy of a flooring require to be assessed in the light of the likely service conditions.
2. Sampling
(a) For Initial Assessment or Lot Acceptance
The amount of material supplied for testing shall be sufficient to enable a
minimum of six strength tests and three stiffness tests to be conducted in accordance
with Clause 3. In the case of sheet materials, samples of sufficient size shall be
provided from at least three separate sheets.
* Division of Forest Products, CSIRO, Melbourne.


(b) For Final Assessment Purposes
The amount of material supplied for testing shall be sufficient to enable a
minimum of 24 strength tests and 12 stiffness tests to be conducted in accordance
with Clause 3. In the case of sheet materials, samples of adequate size shall be
provided from at least 12 separate sheets.

If on fabrication of the test panels, the testing authority is not satisfied with the
uniformity of the surface of any panel, it may require the surface to be sanded to its
satisfaction.
Fig. 5. —Construction of test floor: sheet flooring.
3. Methods of Test
(a) Support Arrangements
The flooring shall be supported in a manner exactly similar to that intended in
practice, for example, on a system of joists or some other bearer system. Thus,
tongued and grooved flooring materials shall be nailed to a series of joists (Fig. 4),
square-edged sheet flooring shall be nailed or otherwise fixed to joists and nogging or
cleats (Fig. 5) so that all edges are supported.


The spacing of the supporting members and the fixing of the flooring to them
shall be as required for the particular form and thickness of the flooring material.
For test purposes, the supporting members shall be of uniform depth and
placed on a level solid base to ensure that they do not deflect when a load is applied
to the surface of the test floor.
(, h ) Size of Test Panel
The smallest area of sample floor shall be of a length equal to the spacing of
the supporting members as referred to in Clause 3 {a), and of width not less than 36 in.
in the case of sheet materials, or five board widths in the case of normal strip flooring.
(c) Position of Test
The flooring shall be subjected to test at the centre of a span, i.e. midway
between joists and, where applicable, also midway between noggings, it being pre-
arranged that any inherent or potential weakness in the flooring be located at this
Fig. 6. —Position of concentrated load test.
position (Fig. 6). For example, in the testing of finger-jointed or end-matched timber
flooring, a finger-joint or end-matched joint shall be deliberately positioned midway
between the supports. Further, in the case of floor boards end-jointed in these or
other ways, the board on one side of that to be tested shall also have a joint at the
same mid-span position, and the board on the other side of the test board shall have
a joint located anywhere within the middle third of the same span (Fig. 6).
No test shall be required within 5 in. of the edges of each test panel.
(d) Test Loading
(i) Strength Test
The strength test shall consist of determining the maximum load that the floor
is capable of carrying when loaded at the test position on an area of \ sq in by means


of a loading tool 0• 8 in. diameter as specified in Figure 7. The load shall be applied
at a rate of between 200 and 400 lb/min. The maximum load for each test shall be
determined with an accuracy of ±2%.
(ii) Stiffness Test
The loading procedure for the stiffness test is to be identical with that specified
for the strength test. Both tests may therefore be conducted concurrently. Deflection
measurements are to be taken from the underneath face of the loaded panel and at
a point directly below the load point (Fig. 8). The deflection is to be recorded for
each increment of 100 lb of applied load up to 400 lb and shall be measured to the
nearest ±O-002 in.

4. Certification
No certificate of adequacy shall be issued in regard to the results of any explor-
atory tests conducted in accordance with this specification.
A certificate may be issued by the testing authority indicating:
( a ) That in full-scale tests conducted to this specification, a material has been
found to meet the necessary requirements. Such a certificate shall show, in addition
to the test results, the following information:
Type of material and trade name (or species of timber);
thickness, and span over which the test was made, and method of securing
flooring to supports.
( b ) That a batch of material requiring to be check-tested has been found to meet
the requirements set out in Clause 4(a). A certificate to this effect may be issued only
after the testing authority has sighted a certificate certifying that this particular type
and make of material has met the requirements of the full-scale tests.
