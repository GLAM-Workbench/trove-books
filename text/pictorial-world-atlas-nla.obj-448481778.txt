Introduction.
. Even from the earliest times, when Maps were first
designed, they have never held so strong a fascination as
they do to-day. Geographical knowledge is an essential
part of modern education, but how much more intriguing
the study of this subject can be when there is contained
in one volume, not only an excellent series of Maps, but
also interesting facts about each country. More import-
ant still, provision has been made for the inclusion of a
unique collection of Picture Stamps which have been
carefully chosen to illustrate the topographical, agricul-
tural, industrial nd domestic features peculiar to each
country. These colourful pictures are to be found in
every Nestle’s penny Milk Chocolate tablet.

ELIEVED to be one of the oldest of the land masses, Australia occupies an area of 3,000,000 square miles, and is divided into
9 ■ three sections —the Great Plateau in the west, which varies in height from 600 to 4,500 feet above sea level; the Central Lowlands ;
9-C and the Eastern Highlands, known as the Great Dividing Range. The centre ot Australia and most of the western pkteau receive
9 verv little rain but in the Central Lowlands there is a large region known as the Great Australian Basin, where the underlying
9~ 9 rocks retain large quantities of water. Artesian wells have been bored, and a very large area has thus become rich cattle and sheep
rearing countrv. Australia is rich in minerals and these have played an important part in her development, particular!) the discovery
of gold about *lB4B which was responsible for an influx of white settlers. Australia has many strange animals, including the duck-tulled
platypus the quaint koala bear, the gentle, harmless wombat, the kangaroo, and the dingo or wild dog which preys upon sheep and
poultry. Rabbits were introduced by white settlers, and are now very numerous. Although a vast country, Australia is thinly populated and
offers great opportunities for agricultural developments. The aborigines ot Austraha, a very backward race of hunters and fishers who are
difficult to civilize, are believed to have come originally from the Malayan Peninsula, and are rapidlv diminishing in numbers.

n -y-i EW ZEALAND consists of two large islands, and its most important physical feature is its mountains. I hey arc particularly
I prominent in South Island and have a great influence on the weather. Thus the western side of the highlands has a heavy
I I rainfall, whilst in the east there is little rain. In the dry pastures of Canterbury Plain in South Island, sheep farming is carried
on extensively, but whereas in the past sheep were kept for their wool, they are now reared for supplying the world, especially
|HH Great Britain, with enormous quantities of frozen lamb and mutton. Downland, in North Island, is also suitable for sheep
■ farming, but it enjoys a warmer climate, and in many parts dairy cattle are more important. From the Kauri pine in the
north of New Zealand is collected the gum used for making varnish. New Zealand has numerous lakes and rivers, which assist in
generating electricity. Mining and forestry are occupations only second in importa'nce to agriculture and cattle rearing. There are extensive
road and railway systems, and many fine ports. Wellington in North Island is the capital, but Auckland, also on North Island, is the largest
town. In the volcanic region of North Island where geysers and hot springs abound, earthquakes still occur. The hot springs have
remarkable curative properties, and have so attracted toitpsts and invalids that the district is now reserved as a sanatorium. In the
majestic Southern Alps there are seventeen peaks reaching a height of over 10,000 feet, the summits of which are perpetually covered in
snow. Here are many large and beautiful glaciers, the most extensive being the Tasman Glacier, which is 18 miles long and 1 1 miles
wide. It is named after the Dutch explorer, Tasman, who in the year 1642 first discovered New Zealand. Not until the arrival of
Captain Cook in 1769, who charted the entire coastline, was New Zealand explored. Later it became a resort for whalers. New Zealand s
animal life consists chiefly of birds, including the quaint kiwi, now becoming rare, kea, cormorant, petrels and kakapo, the owl parrot.

INDIA is a triangular - shaped
country, jutting out from the main-
land of Asia, bordered on its
western shores by the Arabian Sea
and on its eastern shores by the
Bay of Bengal. The southern-most
point, Cape Comorin, reaches almost to
the Equator, but the northern limit is
well within the temperate zone. India’s
climate, therefore, varies considerably
throughout her length and breadth and
as a result she produces an equally varied
assortment of crops, including rice,
millet, wheat, barley, maize, pulses and
oil seeds, sugar-cane, cotton, jute, tea,
tobacco and cocoanuts and some rubber
and coffee. It is one of the most densely
populated countries, with about 340
million inhabitants, nine-tenths of whom
are engaged in agriculture. There are
three climatic seasons : from November
to the end of February is the cool season ;
from March to the middle of June is the
hot season ; and from the middle of June
to October is the wet season, when the
monsoon blows from the south-west.
In the north, the Himalayan mountain
range extends for 1,500 miles, and includes
Mt. Everest, the world’s highest mountain,
which is over five miles high. The
mountains in the north of India are a
formidable barrier, but they can be
crossed by various passes, the most
famous of which is the Khyber Pass
connecting India with Afghanistan.
India’s, wild animals include the tiger,
leopard, cheetah, jackal, elephant, rhino-
ceros, bear, wolf, wild boar and deer.

BURMA has a population of fifteen millions, about three-quarters of whom are engaged in agriculture. Rice is the staple food of
the Burmese, and the principal export. The country also produces cotton, sesame, tobacco, teak, a very hard wood used
extensively for shipbuilding since it neither warps nor shrinks, petroleum from the Irrawaddy valley, and tin, silver and lead ore.
From the mines of Mogok come the world-famous Burmese rubies. Rangoon is the capital and chief port. It is situated about
20 miles from the sea on a tributary of the Irrawaddy river, which is navigable for about 700 miles. On the Irrawaddy nver
itself is Mandalay, a city of beautiful temples and pagodas. The wild animals found in Burma include the elephant, rhinoceros,
buffalo, bison, tapir, leopard, tiger and bear. Ceylon, famous through centuries for its spices and gems, is an island, but is almost joined to
the mainland of India by a series of sandbanks and submerged coral reefs known as Adams Bridge. The total area or Ceylon is 25,000
square miles, one-fifth only being under cultivation. Crops, in order of importance, are cocoanut, rice, tea, rubber, cinnamon and various
grains. About four-fifths of the total population of 5,300,000 are Sinhalese, the rest are chiefly Tamils, some of whom came from India to
work on the rubber plantations. Colombo, the capital, has a fine artificial harbour and is on the main trade routes to the far east.

S~' lAM, in area 194,000 square miles, with a population of over 15,000,000, lies south-east of Burma and, with French Indo-China,
forms the broad northern section of a peninsula that stretches south to end in the Malay Peninsula. Malaya itself almost reaches
the Equator. Siam consists mainly of lowlands upon which heavy rains fall from June to September. It is thus assured of a
good crop of rice, the staple food of the people. Upper Siam is more mountainous, and huge quantities of teak are obtained
from the forested hills, the logs being floated down the Menam river to Bangkok, the capital and principal port. Malaya has a
climate especially suitable for growing rubber, and for the past twenty years this industry' has brought considerable wealth to the
country, for she produces nearly half of the world’s supply. Tin mining is another important industry, the chief mining districts being
the coastal plains, where it is found in deposits washed down from the mountains. Most of the Malayan trade passes through Penang
to Singapore—an important market and one of the world’s great ports. The Malay Peninsula is very widely covered with thick tropical
vegetation, as dense on the top of the hills as on the lowlands. Except, where the ground is kept clear by man, the forest is supreme
everywhere. With the exception of North Borneo, nearly all the islands in the groups known as the East Indies belong to Holland.
Java, the most important, has a population of 42,000,000 and exports cane-sugar, rubber, coffee, cocoanuts, cinchona bark (from which
quinine is obtained), tobacco and manioc (tapioca). There are important tin deposits in the small islands of Banka and Billiton, and oil
and coal are found in both Borneo and Sumatra. One of the sights of Java is the Borobudur, a sacred monument dating from the
eighth century. It is believed to be the finest specimen of ancient Buddhist architecture in the world. North-east of Borneo are the
Philippine Islands, with a population of 13,000,000, which supply most of the world’s cocoanut oil and copra (sun-dried cocoanut kernels).

AFRICA, the second largest of the five continents, is an enormous plateau with terraced tablelands that rise one above the other.
The plateau is higher in the south than in the north. Between Cape Verde and Ras Hafun, Africa is 4,650 miles broad, and
it is 5,000 miles long, making a total area of 11,000,000 square miles. Africa is, for its immense size, thinly populated. In
the north are found Moors, Arabs and Egyptians, whilst south of the Great Sahara Desert, which acts almost as a racial barrier,
live black-skinned peoples. Three-quarters of the continent lie within the tropics, where the temperature is always high, and the
year is divided into wet and dry seasons. In the south, maize, the vine, sugar, and tobacco are the principal crops, whilst in
the western regions round the equator the extraction of palm oil, obtained from the crushing of palm nuts and used in the making of
soap and margarine, is an important industry. Ebony and bananas are also produced, and tin and coal are mined in Nigeria. The Gold
Coast supplies a greater portion of th; world’s cocoa than any other country. From North Africa we get dates, one of the best known
centres for these being the oasis of Biskra. In the Nile valley, cotton and maize are grown, but the crops are dependent on the
overflow of the Nile, one of the world’s greatest rivers. Cotton is rapidly increasing in importance in the Sudan, where the Sennar Dam
has been built and a large area is irrigated. The mineral wealth of Africa, particularly in the south, has been largely responsible for its
rapid development. Gold is mined on the Witwatersrand in the Transvaal; the diamond mines of Kimberley are world-famous, and
the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia are becoming increasingly important. Rhodesia is associated with the name of Cecil -Rhodes,
one of the great personalities in the development of South Africa. Animals found in Africa include the lion, hippopotamus, rhino-
ceros, elephant, leopard, hyena, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, camel, antelope, ostrich and monkey, whilst in the large rivers crocodiles arc numerous.

THE Chinese Republic,
covering a large area in
eastern Asia, is divided into
China Proper and Outer
Territories, the latter in-
cluding Tibet and Mongolia.
The northern limit of China proper
is marked, approximately, by the
Great Wall (1,400 miles long) which
was built 2,000 years ago. In order
to feed a population of over 400
millions, the Great North Plain and
the rich valleys have to be carefully
cultivated, for the rest of China is a
mountainous country. Rice, wheat,
barley, peas, millet and beans are
important food crops, whilst much
tea and cotton are grown. China also
supplies one quarter of the world’s
silk. The Empire of Japan consists
of five principal islands. It is ex-
tremely mountainous and the little
land suitable for cultivation must be
carefully tended. Rice and silk arc
the important products, and wheat
and barley (in the colder north) and
tea are also grown. Having very
little grass land available for sheep
farming, Japan is obliged to import
large quantities of wool from Australia
for making clothes. Fish, a staple food
of the Japanese, is plentiful, and fishing
forms an important industry. Japan
has many volcanoes, and earthquakes
frequently occur. Fuji-yama, the sacred
mountain of the Japanese and world-
famous for its beauty, is an extinct
volcano, 60 miles from Tokio, the
capital. Although it is on the coast,
Tokio has no deep water, and
Yokohama is, therefore, the chief port.

THE British Isles —Great Britain,
consisting of England, Scot-
land and Wales, and Ireland—
enjoy a climate more temperate
than most countries so far
north of the Equator, because
they are in the path of the northern drift
of the warm Gulf Stream, Britain’s
geographical position has played an
important part in her progress. Her
coastline, which is much indented, offers
excellent harbourage and is largely
responsible for her growth as a maritime
power. The chief ports are London.
Liverpool, Glasgow, Hull, Bristol,
Southampton and Plymouth. Cargo
boats from all over the world sail up
the river Thames and unload their great
variety of produce in London’s dockland.
Rich deposits of coal have contributed
largely to Great Britain’s prosperity,
and around the coalfields have grown
up industries which rely on coal for their
driving force, such as the iron and steel
works in Middlesborough, Sheffield,
South Wales, the Midlands and Lanark-
shire. The river Clyde is famous
throughout the world as a shipbuilding
centre. The cotton industry is mainly
confined to Lancashire, wool to the
West Riding of Yorkshire and linen to
Belfast. Rich fishing grounds are found
off the Dogger Bank. British farmers
grow about one-quarter of the amount
of wheat needed and the rest is imported,
as are large quantities of meat, dairy
produce and fruit. The population of
about 44,000,000 is chiefly industrial.

EUROPE, although the second
smallest continent, is the most
thickly-populated, with about
480,000,000 inhabitants, or,
roughly, 126 to the square
mile. France, after Russia the
largest European country, grows
wheat and sugar-beet extensively in
the eastern districts. The hills near
Rheims are famous for the vines from
the fruit of whidh champagne is made
in the town. Iron and steel works
have grown up round the coalfields
farther north. Spain and Portugal arc
separated from the rest of Europe by
the . high Pyrenees. Rich in minerals,
the northern coast of Spain is come-
?uent)y the most thickly populated.
)ranges. lemons and the vine are
widely grown in the south. Much of
Holland is below sea level and great
dykes have been built for protection
from floods. Dairy farming and bulb-
S owing are two important industries.
:lgium is primarily an industrial
country. Germany is as rich in
minerals as Britain, with great coal-
fields in the Ruhr and Silesia. Her
industries include iron and steel
engineering and brewing, and she
produces cotton and woollen goods,
and chemical and electrical apparatus.
About half of Switzerland is covered
by the Alps. Dairy farming is a very
important occupation in this country,
from which we git the famous Swiss
cheeses and tinned milk. South of
the Alps is the Italian Peninsula where
nearly three-quarters of the land is
cultivated. Italy’s products include
wheat, maize, olive oil, wine and silk.

THE U S S.R. stretches from Europe across the Ural Mountains into Asia and extends to the Pacific Ocean. Rich deposits of
platinum gold Copper and iron ore are found in the Ural Mountains. There are large forests of pine and similar trees in the
north but in the centre of the country what was once forest land has been cleared, and there are now large areas under
cultivation whilst in the south are the Steppes where the soil is excellent for growing wheat. The oilfields near Baku and Grozny
supply about one-eighth of the world’s output, the larger part, however, being used in Russia itself. Poland is an independent
republic. Her exports include coal, timber, wood-pulp, paper and considerable farm produce, whilst the chief crops are oats barley,
rye and potatoes. Timber and its subsidiary industries of wood-pulp and paper are the mam occupations of Finland, Norway and Sweden.
Norway also has an important fishing industry, and Sweden is famous for matchmaking. Dairy farming is Denmark s chief trade. n
Rumania sheep-farming is carried out extensively, whilst maize and wheat form the principal crops. The country is also rich in forest land
and oilfields. Greece is so mountainous that only one-fifth of the land can be cultivated. All kinds of fruit are grown and currants form
the chief export. Until recently, farming conditions in Turkey were almost primitive, but modern methods are now being adopted.

N ORTH AMERICA occupies an area of over 8,000,000 square miles, and includes the United States, Canada, Alaska, Newfoundland
and Mexico. Reaching from the Yukon River in Alaska to New Mexico, are the famous Rocky Mountains, a series of ranges
which form the watershed of the American continent. Peoples of all races are to be found in the great cities. Canada, where
British and French predominate, has "made enormous progress in the last half-ccntury, due largely to her development as one
of the world’s largest producers of wheat. Only fifty years ago Winnipeg had 1,000 inhabitants; now its population is over
a quarter of a million. Another important industry in Canada is forestry. Forests cover an area of 1,000,000 square miles,
of which three-quarters are accessible for profitable use. Within recent years Canada has jumped into fifth place amongst the commercial
countries. She has been assisted in this amazing growth by the power supplied to the leading industrial towns of Ottawa, Montreal,
Quebec, Toronto and Hamilton from many waterfalls, including the famous Niagara Falls. Her fishing grounds, too, are very valuable ;
salmon are caught and canned off the west coasts, and cod are obtained from the waters near Newfoundland and off the coast of Labrador,
and dried. The United States of America cover about the same area as Canada, but have a population over ten times as large. Vast coal
and mineral deposits have made the United States one of the world’s richest nations. She supplies two-thirds of the world’s output of
oil. From the south-eastern states comes about half the world’s supply of cotton. The cultivation of- wheat and maize is a source of
wealth, tobacco is an important crop, and some sugar-cane and rice are also grown. Pittsburg has rich coalfields, near which great iron
and steel industries have grown up, other important centres for which are Cleveland, Buffalo and Chicago. The iron ore is obtained
around Lake Superior. The mineral wealth of Mexico is her most important feature, for she has rich silver, copper and oil deposits.

THE West Indies, a group of islands off the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, were so named by Columbus in the belief
that he had actually arrived at the famous Spice Islands which we know now as the- East Indies. They are actually the peaks
of a submerged mountain range and are about 100,000 square miles in area. The volcanoes in Martinique and St. \ incent
were active as recently as 1902. Among the more important groups of islands are the Greater Antilles, comprising Cuba and
Hispaniola (Haiti and Santo Domingo), Puerto Rico and Jamaica. Cuba is a republic that has been considerably developed by
the United States, the principal industries being the production of tobacco and about one-third of the world’s supply of cane-
sugar. Jhe tobacco industry is closely associated with Havana, the capita) city. Haiti, although very rich in mineral sources, is mostly
undeveloped. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people, and coffee the most important product, although the cultivation of
sugar-cane and tobacco is increasing. Puerto Rico, which also specialises in sugar-cane and tobacco, belongs to U.S.A. Forming part tit
the British Empire, the Bahamas consist of about twenty inhabited and many other uninhabited islands, many ot them little more than
rocks. Sponge and turtle fisheries are the major industries. Barbados, to the east of the Windward Isles, produces sugar, molasses, rum
and a little cotton. It has a very pleasant and remarkably healthy climate. Trinidad is famous for its pitch, used in the asphalting of
roads, which is obtained from the Pitch lake, believed to be inexhaustible. Jamaica was discovered by Columbus in 1494. It is the
largest of the British West Indies. The eastern, quarter of the island is occupied by the Blue Mountains, the highest peak of which
reaches nearly 7,400 feet. The soil is rich and fertile, and is well-cultivated. Sugar-cane is, after bananas, the must important • product,
and cocoanuts, coffee, cocoa, ginger, grapefruit and oranges are also widely grown. Rum is one of the principal Jamaican manufactures.

SOUTH AMERICA-** separated
from North America by the
Isthmus of Panama, through
which runs the famous canal
built by the United States at a
cost of £100,000,000. Brazil
occupies the largest portion of South
America, although only a narrow
strip of this country along the Atlantic
seaboard has been developed. Owing
to the great area of the country there
are, of course, many variations between
the equatorial climate of the north
and the tropical conditions of the
south. The Amazon, 4,000 miles
long, drains nearly half of South
America arid is the world’s largest
rivet, for with its vast system of
tributaries its total length is 30,000
miles of navigable waterways. Climate
plays an important part in the wealth
of the Argentine, the most progressive
of the South American States, and,
next to Brazil, the largest. Conditions
here are ideal for growing wheat and
maize, which are exported in huge
quantities. Excellent grassland offers
pasturage for the cattle bred for the
enormous chilled meat exports and
subsidiary industries. In the Peruvian
coast region sugar, cotton and fruits
are widely cultivated. The great
mountain range of the Andes is rich
in copper, silver and tin, and has wide
plateaus and valleys which offer fine
grazing land. The llama is useful
here both for its wool and as a means
of transport. Chile has large supplies
of nitrate, as well as copper and iron ore,
and is connected with the Argentine
by a railway passing over the Andes.

•("' VER since the first Arctic voyage of the old Vikings, man has
ft endeavoured to learn the secrets of the Polar Regions. From the
fifteenth century onwards many English and Dutch explorers
B sailed into these unknown seas in an attempt to locate the
supposed north-eastern or north-western passage that would
shorten the long voyage to India and China. Not until April 6th,
1901, was the North Pole actually conquered. The American, Lieut. Peary,
made the successful journey with a few
companions and about 50 Eskimos and 200
dogs. In recent years the aeroplane, airship and
even the submarine have been used in Arctic
explorations, culminating in the successful
Soviet aerial expedition of 1937, when two
Soviet planes made the journey to America,
flying directly over the Pole. Four Russian
scientists lived for nine months in 1937 on an
ice floe, which began at the North Pole and
drifted down the cast coast to Greenland.
Although Eskimos dwell within the Arctic
Circle, conditions are so rigorous that there
are not more than about 16,000 of these people
in the whole of the Arctic. They live chiefly
on seals. Birds arc more numerous in the
Polar regions than animals, and many of them
have taken to water life, like the penguin which has learnt to swim with
its wings and can no longer fly. The principal animals are seals, walruses,
and of course, the polar bear. There are no human beings in the Antarctic,
for here climatic conditions are much more severe. Actually, this region is
an ice-covered mountainous continent, one and a half times the area of
Europe, with an enormous glacial tableland more than 1,000 miles across.
The Antarctic was unknown until Captain Cook’s voyage of 1774. Various
expeditions were carried out in the nineteenth
century, the South Pole being Anally conquered
in 1911 by Amundsen. He was followed only
a month later by an Englishman, Captain Scott,
whose tragic death on the return journey is one
of the epics in the history of exploration. Some
of the mountain peaks reach a height of fifteen
thousand feet and there are also active volcanoes,
one, Mount Erebus, being 12,500 feet high. For
many years whaling has been a profitable in-
dustry, both in the Arctic and Antarctic, but
with a greater yield in the latter region. Nearly
the entire carcase of a whale is used com-
mercially, the oil in the making of soap, candles,
margarine and lubricating oil ; whalebone for
brushes ; and the prepared flesh for cattle food.
The ground-up bones provide valuable fertilisers.
