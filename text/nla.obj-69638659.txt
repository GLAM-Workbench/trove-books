STAR ; Story of a Bengali {Baby
PART I
AVE YOU ever watched the sky on a clear, mild evening and noticed the way of the stars ? There
they twinkle and glimmer m their setting of soft dark blue, and perhaps you go back in imagination
to your childhood days when you thought they were gimlet holes in the floor of heaven, or baby angels
sent out to play in the sky. So often as you look, it seems as though one star drops from its place,
and shoots across the sky before you, then drops into darkness and is seen no more ?where it has gone
you cannot tell, it has dropped into the ?abyss.? There are human stars, and this is the story of
one of them :
We first heard of her from the Doctor of the local hospital in the town of Pubna, and this is how
it came about. One day we received a letter from the Doctor, in which he told us that a little baby
girl who had been born in the hospital a few days earlier was in grave danger. Her mother, a widow,
wanted to dispose of the child, and was in touch with evil women with a view to selling them the baby,
who would be trained for a life of wrong. The Doctor, though a Hindu, was a good man, and cared
enough about that wee helpless mite to write and ask us if we would be willing to take her, and, if so,
begged us to come for her soon, and save her from that ?terrible thing.? We wrote back at once,
saying we would take the child, and agreeing to call for her at the hospital the next afternoon.
When a new little one is coming to a home what a lot of preparation there is ! And preparation
had to be made in our Pubna home that day, for the wee sister who was coming to find her place
m the love and circle of our big family. One of the first things was to find a big sister among the girls

who would be willing to look after the baby. 1 his meant giving up a Jot of time which she would
otherwise have to herself; it meant wakeful nights perhaps, and many extra duties. So we decided
to ask for a volunteer among the big girls. Every Sunday evening it is our custom to sing hymns
with the girls for a while, and after the singing is over they beg for a story. It was a Sunday afternoon
that we received the Doctor?s letter, and after our usual sing-song a story was told, and it was the
story of the little baby, but told as a story, so that no one guessed she was a living reality.
Some of us will not forget that evening in a hurry. On warm nights a big mat is spread on the
grass in the school grounds, our little portable organ carried out, and several lanterns are also placed
in the centre. Around these, seated in a circle, sit the girls, their bright faces just touched with the
light from the lanterns.
On this particular evening as the baby?s story was told the girls? faces became grave; the
silence and intentness of their listening was a thing to be felt. At last, as the story closed in this manner,
?and that little baby is in our own town, that Girls? School is this school, and those missionaries who
long to take the baby girl, but who want a big sister to look after her, live in this house. Is there
any girl here to-night who will be willing to give her time and love in being big sister to that little
baby ? Then there was a chorus of soft Ohs,? and instantly seven arms shot up in eager response.
We chose the one who we thought had first raised her arm, and with hearts full of thanks to God that
our girls were so ready to do their part, we and the girls bowed our heads in prayer. Out there, sitting
on the grass under the shining stars, we gave thanks to God for all His love, and the hope of another
wee life to be given to our care on the morrow. Meanwhile we committed that little lamb to His
care and protection, who so long ago took the little children in His arms and blessed them. However
big our family already may be, it is beautiful to see the joy of the girls when a new little brother or
sister is brought along. At the time of which we are speaking our baby Chanu was 13 months old.


is
Her crib had been long since discarded and packed away in a store room upstairs. Chanu, having
become a little girl, had put away such baby things, and she had well worn out the mattress, pillows,
and bedding of her crib. So next morning we travelled upstairs and brought down the little dress-
basket crib once more ; there was so much to be done that one of the girls, Labanya, who could machine
nicely, had to leave her own classwork and, with her deft little fingers, come to our aid. What a lot
there was to do ! We had to get the carpenter to mend the mosquito net rods on the little bed, then a
new mattress and pillows had to be made. While one of us cut out tiny sheets, pillow cases, and old
flannel for little blankets, Labanya?s machine wheel turned merrily. Out of an old mosquito net we
managed to get enough good material to make a small one, and a journey upstairs to view the contents
of our Christmas box (God bless the workers at the home end) discovered three tiny singlets, bootees,
and even a miniature patch-work quilt, which seemed to have been made to just fit that little crib.
With what glee we showed our find to the girls, who were following all the preparations with
a joy and eagerness no less than our own. After a few wee frocks had been run up and the crib made
up, even to its tiny patch-work quilt, we looked with satisfaction and perhaps some pride on the work
of our hands, and thought with joy of the dear little warm human who would soon be nestling therein.
Then It was the girls said, Masima (Auntie), what are we going to call the new little sister ?? Then
and there we decided we would name her after God s sky lamps ?Tara (meaning star). So Star she
was to us, even before we had seen her. Did I say all was ready for her ? No, not all.
Little babies need careful, and I might say prayerful, feeding, as we know who have struggled
and wept to rear some particular baby when it seemed that no food at all would suit it. So the last
baby s bottle was hunted up from the cupboard, and, with measuring glasses, sterilised, while fresh
milk was ordered from a Mohammedan neighbour who owned a
healthy cow ! At last all was
Three

really ready ! Leaving the girls all aquake with excitement, in the afternoon we set off to the hospital
to get the baby. Our hearts were very full of joy that it was possible for us to take such little mites as
these and save them from the thing we hardly dared to think of. Somehow, even then, there seemed
to be something different about this little Star baby ; it seemed as If we knew her then, although we
had not actually seen her. Perhaps it was, as one of our teachers said when the crib was packed away,
?It doesn?t seem right for this to be empty.? It was months since our baby Chanu had got too big
for it.
With joyous hearts we sped to the hospital that afternoon. Arriving at the building it did not
take us long to find the mother and child. The woman in her widow?s garment was sitting by the
doorway of her room. She seemed to be expecting us, and called out, ?Have you come to see my
baby? here she is.? We went to her and she held up the child for us to see. We gasped ! for never
anywhere did we think we had seen a more perfect infant. The mother was very fair, and the child
was like some lovely pink and white flower. Round and dimpled with beautiful creases at the wrists
and ankles, soft, silky black hair, a perfect little face, she was a babe for anyone to covet. For a few
minutes we could not speak ! We could hardly believe she w r as to be ours ?she was so beautiful.
Then we turned to the mother. ?And so you are going to give your little baby to us?? Quickly
the sharp brown eyes were lifted to ours as she replied, ?Oh ! that depends upon how much you are
going to give me for her. The women from such and such a place (mentioning a name of evil) have
offered me Rs. 40, another place they have offered me Rs. 20. If you like to give me more than that
you can have her.?
We were thunderstruck. We understood from the Doctor that the child was ours if we came
for her. And to be met with such a statement ! Gradually the ugly fact began to take shape in our
minds that the woman meant what she was saying. We felt dazed. We explained that it was quite


jSpiilf 1
impossible for us to give money for little children, that we never did so. If baby came to us she would
be cared for, loved, kept from evil, and trained to be a good girl?surely, surely, her own mother would
prefer that she came to us and have that than go to that other life, too awful to be thought of. The
woman sullenly replied, ?I must have money, therefore I must give her to the ones who will give me
that.? With hearts spurred on by this new fear and dread we pleaded long with the mother, trying to
appeal to her love for the child ?if she had any. For the sake of a few rupees for herself would she
sell her child's soul and doom her from babyhood to a life of suffering and of sin unthinkable I And
as we pleaded, oh ! how we prayed that God would melt that mother?s heart. We waited. After a
few minutes the woman repeated doggedly, ?I can?t help that, I must have money.?
We looked at that lovely flower child and thought of her beautiful purity being trampled in the
dust, and the innocent little face being turned into one of those faces which cause us to turn away
with an ache unutterable in our hearts, and we felt as if we were fighting against Satan and all his
powers of evil for that little soul. No, no ! She must be saved. God give us wisdom,? we cried.
Just when we had exhausted all our pleadings the Hindu Doctor came into the hospital, and
brought fresh hope. Surely his authority in the hospital would count for something, and the woman
might listen to him. We told the Doctor how matters stood, and he came along to interview the
mother. What folly is this ? said he. Why don t you hand your baby over to the missionaries like
a wise woman ? You know it will be educated, cared for, and well brought up, and what more can
you want ?? The woman became sullen, saying again she wanted money. At this the Doctor spoke
very sharply, trying to do something through fear. Money 1 he said, ?you want money for your
child ! It is only evil people who will give you money for her, and mind you, I know you have been
in touch with them, and if they come on this Compound again there will be trouble. I have told the


police about the matter, and if you are not careful you will find yourself in jail for illegally selling your
child to such people.?
Never shall we forget the tension as we waited the effect of his words. The woman, with her
baby in her arms squatting in the doorway, angry and defiant, the big Doctor standing on the verandah,
and ourselves beside the woman near the door?three people and God against Satan and all his hosts ;
and the centre of it all that wee, innocent babe, sleeping so peacefully in her mother?s arms. The
woman seemed a little impressed by what the Doctor said, and perhaps a little afraid, for she took a
different line altogether. ** lam not going to give the child to anyone, she suddenly said; lam going
to bring her up myself.? The Bengali Doctor, who knows his own people so well, soon met her.
?Bring it up yourself! You know as well as Ido that is impossible ; you haven?t a home, you beg
from door to door, and how are you going to carry round a baby with you ? I know better than that.
You think again and be a wise woman ; give her to the missionaries. With that he turned away,
and we followed him, saying, ?Can nothing be done ?
We did admire that big burly Hindu Doctor because of his concern and genuine desire to help
save the little one. He looked perplexed and said, I fear there is nothing more we can do at present.
Yesterday when I wrote to you I thought the woman would hand her child over, but those evil women
have got in touch with her again and probably made an alluring promise. If the child s own mother
absolutely refuses, I cannot lawfully take the child from her, but I will notify the police. The woman
cannot leave the hospital for another seven days, and the women cannot take the child while she is
here.? With this our hearts seemed turned to stone.
The mother turned her back on us now and hid the baby from our sight. We spoke
to her again and said, ?If ever you change your mind, remember there is always a place for your little
baby in our home at the Mission House.? The woman did not reply, and with hearts too heavy and


(^^
sad for words we left the hospital and walked back to the Mission House. How different the walk
back from when we set out with glad hearts to claim our little treasure! And now we had seen her
and loved her, that babe so pure and beautiful. Could it be, could it be ? No, no, no ! every bit of our
being cried out. ?There must be a way. Oh ! God who loves all little children, help us to find the
way and deliver her ?the little babe we had named Star.? Could a star shine in that darkness ? Never !
Reaching home we were met by a cluster of eager bright girls. ?Oh ! Auntie, where is the baby ?
then a blank look of disappointment as we managed to say, ?The baby has not come, girls.? So
understanding were those dear girls? not another question, just looks of loving sympathy, and they
quietly slipped away. There, confronting us, was the little crib, with its fresh fittings and the tiny
garments all laid out ready. Need we be ashamed to own it ? With eyes that were hot with tears,
and running over, we gathered together all those little things and put them out of sight in the store-
room once more.
We were a quiet sad household that night; each mind was full of one thing, and each heart carried
its ache and its prayer. At evening time one of us went into the school to interview the head teacher.
On the way some of the girls, quiet and subdued because they understood so well, stopped the
missionary and said, ?Auntie, don?t give sorrow a place in your mind any longer. God can ?can?t
He ? And we are going to ask Him every day to bring little Star to us, so don?t have sorrow any
longer, will you ??
The missionary, rebuked by the faith of the girls, and not a little comforted by their love and
sympathy, went on her errand, which was to ask the head teacher and one other if they would be willing
to go round and interview Star?s mother in the morning. Being Bengalis they might have more
influence with the woman than we had. The teachers were only too ready and anxious to do anything
they could. So the next morning at 10 o?clock a gari was called and the teachers went in it to the
Seven


'Ol o
Ik www $-
hospital. It was hard for us who were waiting to settle down to any work, and the girls all had one
ear opened for the sound of the returning gari. In less than half an hour we heard it, and hurried
out on the verandah, hardly daring to breathe, while the teachers alighted from the vehicle, but ?they
came home alone. Soon we heard from them that they arrived at the hospital only to find that early
in the morning the people who were evil had been round to the hospital, and after giving her mother
Rs. 40 had carried off the little baby which was to have been ours. This second attempt to save her
had been fruitless, and now, humanly speaking, little Star was lost ! In India a' little baby once sold
into that life is, humanly speaking, lost for ever ; chains stronger than any bands of iron bind and keep
her until finally her mind is trained to evil by those who seek her destruction, and she has no wish to
leave. We tried to realise it! Our little Star ! For we had felt so sure she was ours ; gone to that
life. Had Satan won ? How we had prayed that she be saved ere it was too late ! We could not
understand, and could only pray as our girls were praying, that somehow, some time, God would
save her, or else, ere the taint of sin could smirch her He would take her to Himself. How many
times as we heard the girls speak of her, and the little ones pray for her at night we upbraided ourselves
for our lack of faith. Oh !it was so hard to let her go ! We couldn t, but held on to her by prayer.
A week passed, and after church on the following Sunday one of our Christian men came to us
and said he wanted a word in private. It was this : The day before he met a Hindu man who informed
our friend that he knew the child we had been trying to save was in a certain house in the Bazaar.
The Hindu begged that his name be not disclosed, nor would he say how he found out the whereabouts
of Baby Star. We did not feel that this scanty information helped a great deal. However, by it we
did know that the little one was still in the town. Accordingly we wrote a letter to the Magistrate,
who is supposed to guard the law. and telling him the facts, suggested that, as we had the clue and
Eight


l^r
the child had been unlawfully sold to these people, he should act in the matter. After several days
we got a curt reply saying that the letter had been sent on to the Superintendent of Police. Once
more we sighed this hope, too, was gone. hat did a big Mohammedan Magistrate care about the
crushed soul of a wee flower baby girl ?
It was about a fortnight later, when we reckoned that little Star would be three weeks old. On
that morning footsteps were heard upon the front verandah of the Mission House, and a polite cough
(the Indian mode of knocking at the door) followed. Upon going out we found a big tall policeman,
and he had something to say. This is what he said : This morning a woman came to the police
station on the other side of the town asking if we could direct her to your house. As she did not
know the way at all I came with her, and she is coming along the road now. The woman has a baby
she wishes to hand over to you. I think you will need to give her a little money for the child, as she is
anxious to return to her village home, but has not enough money for her ticket.? We thought?could
it be ? Oh ! could it be an answer to our prayers about Star ? As we were explaining to the policeman
that we could not and would not give money for a baby, he said, ?Here is the woman now.?
Our gate opened, and in walked a woman. And wonderful, wonderful is our God ! it was the
mother of our little longed-for, praycd-for baby. And in her arms she carried a bundle. Star?s
mother was in a very much softened frame of mind now ; she wanted to hand the baby over to us
and get back to her own village. But she had not any money. We suggested that she should not
necessarily be parted from her babe, but should stay with us and start a new life together with her little
girl. She said, ?No, no ! I must return to my village, but you can take the baby and bring her up."


So little Star was handed into our arms, and the hearts which had been aching for her almost since
her birth. Oh ! the joy of the girls as they realised the little one they had prayed for so faithfully
had come. The mother would not stay, so after looking up the exact price of a train ticket to her
home, we gave it to her, making her fully understand that this Rs, 7 was a gift to her because she was
in need, and not in any way payment for her baby. The woman did not linger, but seemed anxious
to be off. As she was going away it seemed as if some feelings of mother love stirred within her, for
she stopped, turned, and called back to us, You will take care of my little baby, won?t you, and let
me see her sometimes ?? Then she was gone, and Baby Star was with us. Oh ! the wonder of it
seemed almost too much, to feel the dear baby?soft and warm in our arms after all those days?yes,
and nights, too, of prayer, fear, and yet hope that was, at times, very dim. Yes, she was ours. God
and evil had contested long, but God had won, and handing little Star to us He had said : ?Take this
child and nurture it for Me.?
Though our hearts were full of joy because of another baby Star caught ere it fell, we thought
sadly of the mother, and we wondered, and shall never cease to wonder, how, having once sold her
child, she managed to get hold of her again, and why, when she was in need of money the mother
did not try to once more sell the child to those who are only too eager to get hold of a little one who
promises to be beautiful. We only know that God did it in answer to prayer, and because He is the
Shepherd who seeks for the little lost sheep.


PART 11.
And so Star came to live in our Mission School; how the girls, and perhaps some older folks,
too, hung over her crib and loved her ! The struggle we had for her alone would have inspired love
had she been a less attractive babe, but when our baby at two months of age looked up at us and
laughed, well?she took all our hearts by storm, and her little personality made itself felt even then.
Visions come back to memory of other toddling babes who had not long before vacated that crib?
and who came to pat the wee hands and talk in dear, broken baby language to ?our little, little sister,?
as they called her.
In those early days there were many problems to be faced. The change of food upset our
baby at first, and with a horrid fear creeping around our hearts we saw those beautiful round dimpled
limbs become less round, but though she became thinner in the body her face remained always the
same, and the bright smile was ever ready. Oh! how we prayed to be guided and shown the right food
which she needed, and for wisdom to rear this little one to love and serve the Good Shepherd who
had gone into the miry clay to rescue her. Several foods were tried, and though she was always bright
and seldom cried, we could not shut our eyes to the fact that our baby was slowly but certainly losing
weight, and becoming weaker. You who have watched like this over a little one whose very life seemed
bound up in your own will understand the pain, the chill dread which we hardly dared to face, yet was
there always. Oh ! surely God would not take her from us when He had given her to us in answer
to prayer.
One day when Star was four months old she seemed to have a cold, and a nasty little cough
followed. We at once took her around to a Bengali Lady Doctor then in the town. She pronounced
the trouble to be an acute attack of bronchitis. The Lady Doctor looked serious, and something
round our hearts seemed to tighten. We did everything that we humanly could do, and prayed that
Elbve.n


the Heavenly Father who loved her even better than we could would do the rest, and, if He willed it,
spare to us our bright little Star. Bronchitis turned to pneumonia ! Baby was weak from artificial
feeding, and she was only four months old ! Ihe next month cannot be written about. There were
days when hope ran high, and others when we feared that our little Star would the next day shine in
Heaven. When nasty medicine had to be taken or painful things had to be done to her, our baby
was wonderful ; such a poor, wee, pitiful scrap of humanity now, yet she took all treatment so patiently,
and afterwards would smile up into our anxious faces as if to say, Do not be too anxious ; I know all
about it, and will yet bring joy to your hearts by getting well.?
Then one wonderful day the Lady Doctor came and pronounced her much better, and advised
us to carry the crib out on the verandah so that our little patient might get the early morning sunshine
before it became too hot. What a glad day was that when we fixed up a sheet to act as a screen and
to keep any wind off our babe. She lay out there all wrapped up, so quietly looking around her,
then w'e thought she slept. A little later one of us peeped at her and found her hands and feet quite
cold and the little face blue.
Those next few minutes as we worked, and prayed as hard as we worked, can only be realised
by the One who worked with us. There was one thing we urgently needed in our fight for the life of
our baby. That thing belonged to one who had gone out preaching and wouldn?t be back for a long time.
We knew where it was always kept and that case was locked. Upstairs we flew! Yes, the case was
locked, but the thing we needed was in a drawer which was open ; the article had not been put in its
accustomed place, because, as the owner told me afterwards, she was in ?too much of a hurry.? How
well our foreseeing Heavenly bather knew we were going to need that very thing that day. We used
it, and after a long, long struggle which seemed an eternity, the little limbs began to get warm, and
we felt, we knew our baby had been given back to us, and soon, just as soon as ever she was able she
Twelvb


xxy
smiled at us. Star was a weak, sick little baby for a long time, but she began to improve and we
could only look up with hearts full of gratitude and thanks to the One who had a second time given
her to us. *
Jt was during her convalescence that one day suddenly Star?s temperature rose again and remained
up. Ihe Lady Doctor was summoned, and declared that though Star was recovering from her former
trouble, a new disease-the dreaded Kalazar (Black Fever) was in her system ; it had probably been
inherited. Star weakened by her illness, this dormant trouble was making its presence felt. The
only apparent cure for this disease is a course of hypodermic injections. We looked at those tinv
thin arms, and shuddered ! Could we send her away from us to a hospital in Calcutta one hundred
miles away, to strangers to suffer still more pain ? She knew us one from another now, and had a
special welcome and smile for those who attended her most. Just at this time her temperature used
to rise and the dear, wee mite, with burning head, and eyes that quivered with the height of the fever
would he oh so patiently, and take in the same manner all we had to give her. When the fever abated
for a while she would open those wonderful big brown eyes of hers, shaded by their unusually long
black lashes and give to us a loving look ; and when we were near her would hold on tight to a finger
with her tiny thin hand. s
On the days when the fever left her it was hard to think she was so very, very ill, she would
play with our bangles and laugh merrily at their jingle or coo away to us all manner of things in her
baby language How could we bear to send her away to that Calcutta hospital. She would miss
us so. fret, and perhaps-oh !we couldn?t send her ; yet-if they could cure her ! Well we would
write and see, perhaps they wouldn?t be able to take her, and that would end it. There is only one
hospital in Calcutta where there is a Baby Ward ; we knew that this was almost always full, with a
croud waiting their turn to enter. We wired ; immediately a reply came : ?Send your baby at once,

As one of us held her and the girls crowded round to get a glimpse, Baby awoke, and seeing a crowd
of faces staring at her she did not whimper or cry or seem in the least afraid. After one look she gave
us one of those wonderful smiles of hers, and began to coo and laugh at everyone in turn. The girls
declared she remembered us all and was trying to tell us how happy she was to be home once more.
It was 9 p.m., and after her food (the right food now, discovered by the hospital folk) Star was carried
off by her didi (the girl who had looked after her before) to her little bed which had been prepared for
her from early morning.

we have one bed empty.? So she was to go. We had prayed so earnestly for guidance and we felt
the guidance had come. One of our teachers, together with our Manager Babu, took the long journey
to Calcutta with our little one. We committed her to Him who gave her, and waited. When the
teacher and man returned they told us many details. One was that when the English Doctor came
along to examine Star, he picked her up and said, ??Oh ! what a sweet little baby.? She also won the
heart of the Sister at once, so we thanked God that there were those who would be loving and kind
to her though far away from us. We had requested a report from the Matron after Baby?s admission,
but no report came ?even after waiting more than a week. Oh ! how anxious were those days for
the girls and ourselves who were waiting. We wrote for news, none came. With fearful hearts ?we
wondered ; wrote again, still no reply. Almost a month went by and then one of our number happened
to be passing through Calcutta and so called at the hospital. We hardly knew what we would hear.
God had been kind to us, and the visitor found our baby well, after her course of treatment, and ready
to return to us. After all those weeks of not knowing, how wonderful it was to know, and how joyfully
we sent off to Calcutta to get her. It was night time when the party returned by motor bus from the
station. Our baby wrapped up in her little bundle of shawls was asleep. We earned her into the
office and held her, oh ! so close ?our baby ?our little Star, given back to us again the third time.


&
It was on a Saturday night that Baby Star came back to us. The next day being Sunday
we had decided that, instead of having our ordinary Sunday School in the morning, we would make
it a Thanksgiving Service. The girls were most eager, and we decided to make it very special. The
little Hindu and Mohammedan girls who always came to Sunday School would come as usual, and we
would invite a 1 the Day School Teachers to come also. Instead of going into classes three of our
Sunday School Teachers, as well as the leader, would tell briefly stories of very little children from
the Bible.
On Sunday morning the girls were busy at dawn. This was no ordinary day to them. From
each heart was rising a song of thanksgiving all the time, yet we felt we must say ?Thank you? in a
vejy special manner. All seats and desks were taken out of the room where our Sunday School is
held. W hen the room was quite empty the floor was covered with rugs, and big vases, full of bright
flowers, were pLced m the centre. Little maidens carried heavy palms in pots from the house and
these were stood about Flowers and festoons decorated the walls, and right in the very centre a tiny
ed was made up on the floor Round this, as if growing there, were scattered flowers. One seat

What a happy, happy, never-to-be-forgotten hour that was. One of our teachers briefly
told the story of Baby Moses, and how God saved him. Another told of Baby Samuel, another of
Mephibosheth, and the leader the story of Jesus blessing the little children. And our own precious
baby for whom we had so often cried to God ?sometimes with such fear ?was lying there before us,
* well, happy, and radiating smiles in every direction. During the service one girl came forward and
placed a tiny garland of flowers round Star?s neck (baby-like she soon chewed them, and her didi had
* to fly to the rescue). Afterwards all the children wanted to hold baby ?just for a minute? in turn?
but she didn?t seem to mind anything.
Yes, God has given her back to us, our dear, bright, happy Baby Star, and we thank Him (again)
upon every remembrance of her.
She is one of the little stars which, falling, shot across our vision towards darkness ?that abyss
too terrible to think of alongside our baby. Love and prayer caught her ere it was too late, and she
is with us. We pray and believe that she will grow up to be a bright Star to shine for her Saviour
here. But she is one ?there are others ; so many little human stars falling?falling. There was
another very like Star ?and though w?e strove to save her she fell into the abyss.
Oh ! lovers of little children, when you lift your eyes to the heavens on a clear night, think of the
little falling stars of India, and pray for them ?as we prayed for Star.
