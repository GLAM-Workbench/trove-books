r great activity of the spirit of colonization is among the
most conspicuous features of the times. From the earliest
period of history, the English people have been essentially rest-
less and migratory. Themselves a colony, they seem never to
have lost the habits of their Saxon ancestry; and when the dis-
covery of a New World opened a more extended field for the
exercise of that migratory disposition, it is not at all surprising
that the British nation took a lead in what Bacon called the
? heroic work? of planting new colonies. In this, their insular
position, and consequent maritime habits, gave them superior
facilities; and that of these they have availed themselves to a
remarkable extent, the great American republic alone is ample
evidence.
Recently the spirit of colonization, under a new impulse, has
acquired an entirely new character. Emigration is no longer
confined to the most wretched portion of the population?to the
mere labouring masses. The light of science has shed a brilliant
ray on the modern practice of colonization, and new countries,
which recently were merely receptacles for the superabundant
portion of the hard-working millions, have now become attractive
to the more enlightened portion of the community. In short,
colonization has taken the place of mere emigration ; the removal
of society, that of mere masses; and men of refinement and edu-
cation may now emigrate, without any material disturbance of
their previous habits.
A complete revolution in the state of opinion respecting emi-
gration has in fact taken place. If this be set down as a conse-
quence of the superior attractiveness of colonies at the pre-
sent, compared with former times, it also re-acts as a cause.
As to the change itself, it is impossible to go into intelligent
society without meeting with some evidence of it. People to
whom the idea of severing themselves from their native country
was insuperably repugnant, now speak familiarly of emigration
as a possible contingency, either not to be dreaded, or to be
desired. Among the educated portion of the middle class, where
families are numerous, it is now not unusual to find some one or
more of the sons seeking fortune in our distant possessions.
Young women, too, of refined education no longer object to emi-
grate if circumstances favour that step ; and even the younger
portions of the aristocratic class, who have hitherto been content
to accept a miserable pittance at the hands of government in the
shape of some paltry office, adapted rather to that slothful inac-
tivity, which is the result of the useless education they usually
receive, than to their pampered wants, are now catching some of


the energy and enthusiasm of the class habitually trained to
activity; and we find them no longer playing the part of office-
seekers in some of our old and ill-governed colonies, but honour-
ably striving for wealth and distinction as active settlers in the
more attractive of the Australian colonies, and in New Zea-
land.
Supposing colonies to be only tolerably attractive, it is easy to
perceive the strong motives to emigrate which prevail among all
but the wealthy. Of the misery of the great bulk of the people
no one entertains a doubt. It is the universal topic of the press
?the one fact on which none are found to differ. Our millions
expended in the shape of legal provision for the poor alone bear
witness to the insufficiency of the wages of the working popula-
tion. Some small sections of the industrious classes may be able
to secure a tolerable remuneration for their labour, but the inherit-
ance of the masses is ?insufficient wages and excessive toil.?
It was only last session that the Duke of Buckingham?who
claims to be the friend of the labourer?spoke of nine shillings a
week as ? good wages ! ? at a time, too, when good wheat was
upwards of seventy shillings per quarter.
Now although this unfortunate declaration raised the indigna-
tion of such as really have some sympathy for the people, it
excited but little notice among the noble personages to whom it
was addressed. The Duke himself probably believed that nine
shillings a week was quite enough ? for an agricultural labourer;?
and such of his hearers as had any feelings on the subject w 7 ere
benevolently glad to hear the people w 7 ere ?so very w r ell oil.? Be-
tween a peer and a peasant there can be no feeling of comparison.
The peer should not be expected to place himself in the peasant?s
fiosition, and, hearing the Lancashire weaver sometimes works
lard for five shillings a week, he would naturally think nine
shillings ?good wages? in his own county.
Of the motive to emigrate from the misery inseparable from
the ? good wages? of the Duke of Buckingham, there cannot be a
doubt. In most of our colonies the wages of common labourers
are four or six times as great as in England, whilst wheat is often
not more than half the price. An impediment to emigration must
therefore be sought, not in the absence of an' adequate motive
to remove, but rather in the difficulty and expense of re-
moving.
Whilst the labouring class are thus perpetually subject to ?in-
sufficient wages and excessive toil,? the middle class?that is, all
between those who, having nothing but their hands, work for
hire, and those whom wealth removes from the necessity of exer-


tion either bodily or mental ?are carrying on a perpetual struggle
to maintain their position in society. Ihe author of ?England
and America?* ?a work upon which we shall presently draw
largely?calls them ?the uneasy class.? Take the professional,
agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial classes, it will be
found that all but a wealthy few are engaged in a perpetual
struggle to maintain themselves in the position in society to which
they belong, but from which numbers are continually thrust by
the superior energies of their fellows. That there is not rooni
for all is obvious to all, and this necessarily induces a struggle of
painful intensity.f
? The difficulty of providing for a family ? is a form of com-
plaint in which the uneasiness of even the more fortunate and
wealthy portion of the class in question is frequently made mani-
fest. A difficulty which even brings the aristocracy within the
uneasy class.
? What,? says the author of ? England and America/ ? what are
the sons to do when grown up, if grown up ? The army ??pay for
a commission, and then, unless you belong to the spending class, look
on promotion as hopeless. In the navy candidates for promotion are
quite as redundant as in the army. The church ??buy a living, or

host of needy competitors for miserable curacies. The law, medi-
cine, trade ??all full?overflowing; while the last, whether agricul-
tural, manufacturing, or commercial, requires a large capital, or it
will bring uneasiness, perhaps bankruptcy. A place under govern-
ment ??yes, perhaps, if you are the parasite of a great man. I say
perhaps, because the class of parasites wanting places has greatly
increased of late, like all the other classes, whilst the number of
places is become somewhat less. At best your son will obtain but

f We are informed that ninety-seven barristers attended the Summer
Assizes at York. The cause list contained only eighty-nine causes, and the
calendar fifty-one prisoners. Many of the causes were ?undefended causes;
and two or more prisoners being sometimes joined in one crime, the criminal
trials were under forty. As the leaders were said to be ?in everything,
it follows that there were not many briefs to be distributed among the junior
members of the circuit. Yet among these juniors are many of distinguished
ability and great learning, and if some of them are fortunate enough to get
an opportunity, and do make their way, many must necessarily suffer dis-
appointment, and swell Mr Wakefield?s uneasy class.


a small place, all the great ones, both at home and in the colonies,
being kept for young people of the spending class. At any rate, the
pain of being a parasite brings you within the uneasy class. There
was a way, indeed, by which a man of small income could obtain
places for his sons without cringing to any one; by connecting him-
self with a rotten borough as alderman, bailiff, returning officer, or
crier; but the glory of rotten boroughs has passed away, and if
reform should go no further, only the spending class and their para-
sites w T ill obtain places under government.
(t But if a man of fixed income, his income being small or mode-
rate, be troubled to provide for his sons, how to provide for his
daughters is a more perplexing question. The first, no, the second
point, is to get them married ; the first point is to prevent them from
marrying into a lower, which commonly means into a poorer rank
than that in which they were born. The first point is generally
effected during childhood, when every day and almost every hour
of the day something happens to impress them with a fear of such
degradation as attaches to imprudent marriages. The second pur-
pose being subject to the first, becomes extremely difficult. If the
girl had a fortune she would belong to Captain Hall?s spending
class; w r e suppose her to have no fortune, except beauty, tenderness,
modesty, and good sense. Who will take her as a wife that she will
take as a husband ? She may by chance, or rather her mother may
by dint of great toil and management, catch one of the spending
class; but "this would be an exception to the general rule. The
general rule with the daughters of men of small incomes, whether
fixed or not, is a choice between celibacy and marriage with one of
the uneasy class. Now a great proportion of young men of the
uneasy class dread marriage, unless there be fortune in the case, as
the surest means of increasing their embarrassment. This is one of
the most important features in the social state of England. . . .
There is not in the world a more deplorable sight than a fine brood
�f English girls turning into old maids one after the other; first,
reaching the bloom of beauty, full of health, spirits, and tenderness;
next, striving anxiously, aided by their mother, to become honour-
able and happy wives; then fretting, growing thin, pale, listless,
and cross; at last, if they do not go mad or die of consumption,
seeking consolation in the belief of an approaching millennium, or in
the single pursuit of that happiness in another world which this world
has denied to them.??P. 101-105.
Now this is surely a state of things to fly from, if with a rea-
sonable prospect of effectually escaping it. The motive to remove
is clearly as potent among the uneasy class as among the labour-
ing class; and all that is necessary is to make the colonies
attractive, as well to the former as to the latter ?attractive, not
only to the mere money-seeker, but to those also whose education
and habits render a refined society necessary to their happiness.


The principles of colonization first laid down by Mr Wakefield
in the works quoted in a former note ?successfully adopted in
South Australia and New Zealand, and partially, but, as it should
seem, grudgingly adopted by the government in all the Austra-
lian colonies?propose to render colonies attractive by trans-
ferring society, and not merely masses, from old to new countries.
For the purpose of explaining how this is brought about, we shall
detain the reader through a few pages while we contrast the old
with the new system.
Before we do this, however, let the reader mark the difference
between what are called old and new countries. In old countries
capital and people are abundant, land scarce, and therefore dear.
In new countries, on the other hand, everything, including labour,
is scarce and dear, whilst land is cheap, so cheap indeed that it
might be had by asking for; that is, the government were in the
habit of making grants of land to all who applied for it, and who
would agree to fulfil certain trifling conditions. The first conse-
quence of this improvident system of land-granting was, that no
man would work for hire. Every labouring man who went out
to a new country had been in the habit of associating the idea of
wealth with that of owning land. In old countries his experience
had taught him that to own land was to be wealthy and powerful;
to be a land-owner, therefore, was the settler?s first wish. The
capitalist going out at the same time, instead of being able to
command such assistance as would render his capital productive,
has not unfrequently been compelled to confine his operations to
just so much land and capital as he could work with the few pair
of hands constituting his own family. It was as if two men
should go forth to settle in a new country, one of whom had two
spades and the other had none. He of the spare spade would not
lend it to him who had none, because he had a large plot of land
which he wished the spadeless labourer to help him to dig; whilst
the latter, having just as much land as his spade-owning neigh-
bour, w?ould rather poke up the surface with a stake, and retain
the character of an tc independent freeholder,? than become the
hired servant of any man. The consequence of want of co-ope-
ration between the spade capitalist and the labourer would be,
that the spare spade?the unemployed capital?w T ould rot: and the
sum of production, instead of being the result of the labour of
two men working amicably and in combination with two good
tools, was simply that of their isolated exertions, the one only
working with the good tool, and the other with some rude help
to labour which would really amount to no tool at all. The loss,
by reason of want of combination, would be incalculable; they
could effect none of those operations which absolutely required


the combined operations of two persons. This is a type of plan-
less colonization which proceeded on the supposition that the
removal of mere masses was all in all.
The last colony deliberately founded on this principle was the
colony established at the Swan River in 1829. It turned out the
most signal failure of modern times, though, under the wise
management of Mr John Hutt, the present governor, it will,
doubtless, be completely resuscitated. Its first failure, clearly the
result of the excessive cheapness of land, is thus described by Mr
Wakefield in his evidence before a select committee of the House
of Commons on the disposal of waste lands in the colonies :*?
? 590. Chairman. What do you consider the most striking prac-
tical evil resulting from too great a profusion in granting land ???
The most striking, because it happens to be the last, is the new
settlement of Swan River in Western Australia.
??s9l. In what way is that the most striking?? That colony,
which was founded with a general hope in this country, amongst
very intelligent persons of all descriptions, that it would be a most
prosperous colony, has all but perished. It has not quite perished,
but the population is a great deal less than the number of emigrants;
it has been a diminishing population since its foundation. The greater
part of the capital which was taken out (and that was very large)
has disappeared altogether, and a great portion of the labourers taken
out (and they were a very considerable number) have emigrated a
second time to Van Diemen?s Land and New South Wales. The
many disasters which befel this colony (for some people did actually
die of hunger), and the destruction of the colony taken out to the
Swan River, and the second emigration of the people avlio went out,
appear to me to be accounted for at once by the manner in which
land was granted. The first grant consisted of 500,000 acres
to an individual, Mr Peel. That grant was marked out upon the
map in England; 500,000 acres were taken round about the port or
landing-place. It was quite impossible for Mr Peel to cultivate
500,000 acres, or a hundredth part of the grant; but others were of
course necessitated to go beyond this grant, in order to take their
land. So that the first operation in that colony was to create a
great desert, to mark out a large tract of land, and to say, ? This is
a desert ?no man shall come here; no man shall cultivate this land.?
So far dispersion was produced, because upon the terms Mr Peel
obtained his land, land was given to the others. The governor took
another 100,000 acres, another person took 30,000 acres, and the
dispersion was so great that, at last, the settlers did not know where
they were; that is, each settler knew that he was where he was, but
he could not tell where any one else was ; and, therefore, he did not

know his own position. That was why some people died of hunger;
for, though there was an ample supply of food at the governor?s house,
the settlers did not know where the governor was, and the governor
did not know where the settlers were. Then, besides the evils re-
sulting from dispersion, there occurred what I consider almost a
greater one, which is, the separation of the people, and the want of
combinable labour. The labourers, on finding out that land could
be obtained with the greatest facility, the labourers taken out under
contracts, under engagements which assured them of very high
wages, if they would labour during a certain time for wages, imme-
diately laughed at their masters. Mr Peel carried altogether about
three hundred persons, men, women, and children. Of those three
hundred persons about sixty were able labouring men. In six
months after his arrival he had nobody even to make his bed for
him, or to fetch him water from the river. He was obliged to make
his own bed, and to fetch water for himself, and to light his own fire.
All the labourers had left him. The capital, therefore, which he
took out, viz. implements of husbandry, seeds and stock, especially
stock, immediately perished; without shepherds to take care of the
sheep, the sheep wandered and were lost; eaten by the native dogs ;
killed by the natives and by some of the other colonists, very likely
by his own workmen ; but they were destroyed. His seeds perished
on the beach; his houses were of no use ; his wooden* houses were
there in frame, in pieces, but could not be put together, and were
therefore quite useless, and rotted on the beach. This was the case
with the capitalists generally. The labourers, obtaining land very
readily, and running about to fix upon locations for themselves, and
to establish themselves independently, very soon separated them-
selves into isolated families, into what may be termed cottiers, but
having, instead of a very small piece of land, a large extent of land,
every one was separated, and soon fell into the greatest distress.
Falling into the greatest distress, they returned to their masters, and
insisted upon the fulfilment of the agreements upon which they had
gone out; but then Mr Peel said, ? All my capital is gone ; you have
ruined me by deserting me, by breaking your engagements, and you
now insist upon my observing the engagements, when you yourselves
have deprived me of the means of doing so.? They wanted to hang
him, and he ran away to a distance, where he secreted himself for a
time, till they were carried off? to Van Diemen?s Land, where they
obtained food, and where, by the way, land was not obtainable by
any means with so great facility as at Swan River.??P. 53-4.
Excessive cheapness of land then produces a body of pauper-
landowners scattered over a wide extent of country, scarcely
knowing their neighbours, and rendering combination and co-
operation?the main-springs of civilization?impossible. The
capitalist is deterred from proceeding to such a country. He can


offer no inducement to the labourer to work for him, and the latter,
unaided by capital, cannot draw from the soil half so much as his
share would amount to in case he could be brought to co-operate
with the capitalists.
The statement of the evil in itself almost conveys a suggestion
of the remedy. Cheapness, or rather excessive cheapness, being
the evil, the remedy of course consists in putting an uniform
price per acre upon all land without exception, and by devoting
the proceeds to the removal of labour from the country in which
it is in excess to that in which it is deficient.
But uniformity of price is not all that is necessary. The object
is to render the new country attractive to the capitalist, by pro-
viding for a supply of labour; and to the labourer by keeping
wages high :?to preserve, in short, a due proportion between
land, labour, and capital. The price, says Mr Wakefield, must
be ? sufficient, but not more than sufficient.? Between the high
price of land in old countries and excessive cheapness of land in
new countries, there is room for every possible degree. Though
some price be demanded, though it be ?fixed and uniform,? it
may be too low to fulfil the condition of a due supply of combin-
able labour; or it may be placed so high as to defeat the object,
either by creating too great a proportion of labour, and so re-
ducing wages, or by promoting that unauthorized occupation of
land, which in America is called squatting, as so producing dis-
persion and its consequent barbarism. In countries like Aus-
tralia and New Zealand for instance, where there is abundance of
unoccupied land, if the price were fixed so high as to threaten to
entail upon the population the evils of an old and thickly-peopled
country, the people would undoubtedly seek to avoid those evils
by squatting?and they would do right. Too high as well as too
low a price, therefore, would ultimately produce the same evil-
dispersion ; and, in both cases, capital would cease to flow into
the country. The ?golden mean? must besought, the price
must be ? sufficient, but not more than sufficient.? Before the
committee of the House of Commons, Mr Wakefield was pressed
to say what price he deemed sufficient, but he very wisely de-
clined. Such a price could not be legislatively fixed, but it could
easily be determined by a land board, apprised of all the cir-
cumstances connected with labour and employment in each co-
lony. Such a board would have perpetually before it two obvi-
ous beacons to enable it to avoid each class of evils, and when
no capitalists wanted a labourer and no labourer wanted employ-
ment at high wages ?when there was no disposition to squat ?
when the moment a labourer became a capitalist and purchased
more land than he could work with his own hands, he also could


find a labourer to aid him, then it might be safely affirmed that
the board had hit upon the golden mean.
? This golden mean obviates every species of bondage; by pro-
viding combinable labour, it renders industry very productive, and
maintains both higher wages and higher profits ; it makes the colony
as attractive as possible both to capitalists and labourers, and not
merely to those, but also, by bestowing on the colony the better
attributes of an old society to those who have a distaste for the primi-
tive condition of new colonies heretofore.?*
As the proceeds of the sales of land constitute a labour fund,
the efficiency of that fund of course materially depends on the
mode of expending it. The object is to relieve the population of
the old country, and augment to the utmost that of the new. As
the faculty of continuing the race can reside only in a por-
tion of the" population?as it is that portion also which contin-
ually competes in the market and so reduces wages, it follows
that the fund can be efficiently employed only in diminishing that
portion.
For argument sake, let us take two extreme cases. If we
were to expend the labour fund only in removing the aged and
imbecile ?those who had long ceased to add to the population,
or to compete for wages, and who in the common course of na-
ture could not long continue on the scene, we should do not the
slightest good, but merely inflict the pain of removal uselessly
and improvidently. If, on the other hand, we removed ail who
annually attained the age of puberty, in time we should wholly
depopulate the old country and rapidly fill the new. By simply
selecting emigration, both as to age and sex?by confining the
expenditure of the emigration fund to equal proportions of both
sexes between certain ages?say eighteen and thirty-five?we
give the greatest relief to the old country and provide for the
rapid population of the new ?we convey the greatest germ of
increase at the smallest cost.
These, then, are the two great principles of colonization :
1. That the waste lands in our colonies be sold at a fixed, uni-
form, and sufficient price.
2. That the proceeds be expended in conveying young per-
sons of both sexes in equal proportions to the colony which fur-
nishes the fund.
The effect of these principles is permanently to establish soci-
ety in the colony brought under their operation. To the mere

capitalist, considered abstractedly, we have shown that they ren-
der the colony highly attractive; and when we consider the
varied forms in which capital exists, and moreover the diversity
of intelligence necessarily attached to particular forms of capital,
we must at once perceive, that to be highly attractive to capital
is to be attractive also to intelligence, to enterprise, to science, in
short, to all the elements of civilized society. That capital, for in-
stance, which requires perfect modes of communication from place
to place, attracts the surveyor, the engineer, and an attendant train
of superior artizans and mechanics. The ship?the steam-boat?
the i-ailway?the public building?all of them mere forms of
capital, cannot exist without corresponding phases of intelligence;
and as morality is the offspring of intelligence and abundance,
the colony thus constituted may be said to start at the point of
civilization of the mother country, and to have a tendency to
surpass it; that is, taking the average standard condition of the
public mind.
It is a conviction that the new principles are efficient for this
purpose, which has produced the great confidence that exists in
the colonies established thereon. This confidence has now gone
a point further, it has extended to some colonies which, though
not wholly undeserving of it, certainly deserve it less; in short, it
is the parent of that activity of the spirit of colonization which we
began by describing.
The disposition to colonize being given, the very first question
which arises is the relative value of the several fields for choice.
On the British colonial empire the sun is said never to set.
Extending from the tropics to the poles, our colonies present
every variety of soil, climate, and production; and although
they may individually be grouped into a few clusters, agreeing
together in their broader features, the choice of a field is a diffi-
culty by which the intending colonist must necessarily be met at
the very outset; and his choice is not unfrequently determined
by some accidental circumstance which either ought not to have
influenced him at all, or at most only slightly. To direct his
choice is the object of this article, and although the space which
we can afford to each of the colonies to which emigrants repair
must necessarily be small, we shall endeavour to obviate that
inconvenience by referring to the best sources of information.
The circumstances which should affect the emigrant?s deter-
mination in choosing his colony are chiefly the following :
1. The principles on which the colony has been and continues
to be settled should, from what we have already stated, weigh
against a multitude of other advantages, when combined with a
bad system of colonization. Besides their effect in rendering


the colony attractive both to capitalists and labourers, the supe-
rior character of the population they establish especially recom-
mends them to the settler of intelligence. We shall see the effect
of good principles triumphing over comparative disadvantages, as
well as the effect of natural advantages unable to sustain a co-
lony against the operation of vicious principles, when we come to
compare South Australia with Western Australia.
2. Soil, climate, supply of water, and peculiar natural produc-
tions, should be carefully weighed before a choice is finally made.
To say that one colony is absolutely better than another is to tal
nonsense. The soil of one colony may be superior to all others,
and its climate may especially adapt it to the growth of wheat;
but if it happened that sheep were found not to thrive there, it
would be madness in the shepherd to go there. A neighbouring
colony, on the other hand, may be well adapted to sheep-farming,
whilst, from poverty of soil and liability to drought, tillage is
precarious. The shepherd may find fortune in the one, the hus-
bandman draw wealth from the other. Would it not be absurd
to condemn either because it does not contain the advantages ot
the other, as well as its own. Each of our colonies seems to
possess its own peculiar advantages, and it is by fairly weighing
these, and suiting them to the circumstances ot individuals, that
a prudent choice can be made. . ~
8. Position for external and internal trade, navigable rivers,
and harbours, are features which should never be lost sight ot
bv the emigrant. It may be that he is in no way connected with
trade, and has, therefore, nothing to do with it as a direct ques-
tion; but whether as a consumer or a producer, he cannot be
indifferent to commercial facilities. A position well adapted tor
commerce would compensate for the sterility ot a rock, and a
Gibraltar will unquestionably be better supplied with all the
obiects of desire than an oasis in the desert, lo the mercantile
emiirrant a commercial position is all-important, and should o
course weigh against all other advantages. It is also ot obvious
advantage to all classes, and should never be lost sight of by the
settler of any class when balancing the relative advantages of this
and that field for colonization. . c
4 Distance from the mother country is worthy ot considera-
tion? chiefly as affecting the cost of conveying emigrants to the
colony In treating the subject of colonization, we do not con-
template the return of the settler. Some may go out with the
idea of making a fortune and returning, but the majority all,
indeed, but a few-go out to settle; and it is tor them we write
Distance, then, is worth regarding, not with a view to facility of
returning, but to facility of reaching a colony. It must neces-


sarily influence, though it ought not wholly to determine, the
choice of the poorer class of settlers.
5. The character of the population , European and native, is
another consideration which should be well weighed by the in-
tending emigrant. We have already spoken of the new principles
of colonization as having a tendency to establish a population
intelligent and moral in a high degree; but there are other cir-
cumstances which the intending emigrant should take into
account, many of which will be passed under review in our exa-
mination of the several colonies considered as fields for coloniza-
tion. In some ot our colonies the aborigines are intelligent and
capable of civilization, in others they are crafty and intractable.
Some of our colonies have a mixture of races; others owe a large
proportion of their population to transportation from the mother
country. A population composed chiefly of convict slaves and
their masters cannot be favourable to civilization, and the intend-
ing emigrant will not fail to examine carefully into the effects of
convictism on the colonies subject to its influence.
6. 1 he character of the government is another important item
in the account, and the emigrant will do well to examine, not
merely the existing government, but the species of government
which seems likely to be established. In one colony, for instance,
there may be a w*ell established popular government, whilst in
others the very form of government is obviously provisional. In
the last case it will be proper to inquire the existing circum-
stances likely to determine the form of government which must
at no distant period be established. South Australia has a legis-
lative right in expectancy to a representative assembly; New
Zealand will expect no less, and the penal colonies are now
asking for a representative constitution; but the description of
franchise which the Imperial Parliament will be disposed to
bestow on these several colonies will in all probability be very
various, and the great Australian jails will require checks upon
the elective franchise, which to the people of South Australia and
New Zealand would be unnecessary and even insulting.
These leading considerations we have thought it necessary to
enumerate as briefly as possible; there are many other minor
circumstances which will necessarily operate upon the mind and
affect the decision of the intending emigrant, but they will suffi-
ciently appear as the several colonies are passed under review.
For the purpose of comparing the several colonies it will be
convenient to consider them in two groups. First, the British
North American colonies, comprising the Canadas, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Prince Edward?s Island, and Newfoundland;


and, second, the Australasian* colonies, consisting of New South
Wales, Australia Felix or Port Philip, Van Diemen?s Land,
South Australia, Western Australia, and New Zealand.
The British American colonies enjoy the very great advantage
of being within a comparatively short distance from the mother
country. The ordinary length of passage to Quebec, which is
the most distant of the British American ports, is from thirty to
forty days. Thirty-five days in the spring of the year may be
considered an average passage, though the writer of this article
was once fortunate enough to go from Portsmouth to Quebec in
twenty days. The passage home is from twenty to twenty-eight
days. The passage to the lower ports, as they are called, that is the
ports of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, is a few days shorter, and
there is a further saving of two or three days if the vessel sail from
Ireland. Reckoning the passage to Canada at forty days, it is
not more than one-third of the length of the Australian voyage,
which is usually considered to average four months; and as the
shorter voyage requires less provision against contingencies, the
difference of expense is more than in the above proportion. The
price of a steerage passage to Australia is 21/., whilst the passage
to British America is seldom so high as 61., and more frequently
costs under 5/. But in the American trade it is usual for steer-
age passengers to find themselves in provisions, and this not
unfrequently reduces the passage from Ireland to Canada to less
than 31. per head.
From England the ordinary rate of passage, without food, is
from 21. 10s. to 31., the ship finding only water and fire. At
30s. to 355. a head a family may be provided with much better
food than our labouring population is accustomed to, consisting
of flour, oatmeal, biscuits, potatoes, butter, sugar, coffee, pork,
bacon, herrings, together with a little spirits, with vinegar, salt,
pepper, and other small articles. This makes the passage, with
food, range from 4/. to 4/. 15s. From Ireland the passage-money
is less, and as the people are habituated to a lower description
of food, they content themselves with very miserable fare.
Ships frequently have taken emigrants from Ireland as low as
30s. each ; and considering the wretched manner in which they
victual themselves ?with nothing but potatoes, red herrings, and
the minimum quantity of biscuit allowed by law, namely, seventy
pounds for each adult?their food cannot cost much more than

probably not often over 3/. But their state is so filthy and
squalid/ and they are often so shamefully treated on board the
ships, nothing being done for their comfort but what the law
enforces, that a government or public body conducting emigra-
tion could not resort to so low a standard, and 4/. a head should
be the lowest rate at which human beings should be conveyed to
America. For that sum a degree of comfort might be provided
to which the Irish peasant is a stranger, and the sea voyage would
in that case improve rather than deteriorate his habits.
With so low a rate of passage it is not surprising that the spirit
of emigration ?at first almost exclusively confined to the desti-
tute class?first displayed itself in our American colonies. Pre-
vious to 1828 the Australian colonies were almost exclusively
penal; free settlers seldom thought of proceeding thither. Al-
lowing as many to have settled in the United States as in Canada
from Great Britain and Ireland from 1823 to 1828, the whole
force of the disposition to emigrate was up to that time extremely
feeble. The following is a statement of Canadian immigration
from 1823 to 1839: ?
The effect of cheapness is to attract the poorer class of emi-
grants towards Canada. I his is proved by the large propoition
of Irish compared with Scotch and English. Out of the 100,000
who emigrated to Canada in 1831 and 1832, for instance, no less
than 62,000 were Irish; and of the 12,658 who emigrated in
1839, no less than 8,989 were Irish; whilst out of 33,000 who
emigrated to the United States, less than 3,000 weie Irish, and
out of nearly 16,000 to the Australian colonies, under 2,000 were
Irish. The recent determination of emigration towards the
Australasian colonies is only because they have become attractive
to a wealthier class. # .

its soil. Nearly the whole country was originally one vast forest;
and although some portions of Lower Canada lying towards the
sea may not promise a high degree of fertility, there is compara-
tively but little that is wholly unfit for tillage or pasture, and
much that will yield a large return for a moderate degree of
labour.
In so vast a country,? says a writer in the * British Farmers'
Magazine? for May, 1832, ? great variety of soil is to be found ;
this variety, however, is considerably less than in what Americans
call old countries. Brown clay, light and rich, runs through the
two provinces ; loam also abounds; marie is to be found occasionally,
though in small quantities, in every district, as also calcareous earth.
In many parts of both provinces the soil is sandy, fertilized in some
cases by the admixture of other ingredients, particularly vegetable
matter; in others it is perfectly arid and sterile. Gypsum is every-
where plentiful, though I am not aware of its having as yet been
used as manure. Limestone is also to be found everywhere ; in some
places rising above the surface, particularly in Lower Canada, and
more especially in the district of Quebec, Lastly, on the shores of
many of the smaller lakes, and along the courses of some of the
rivers, considerable tracts of rich alluvial deposit are to be met with.
? These component parts are combined in endless proportions;
but in a country reclaimed from a state of nature, in which so re-
cently all was forest, the whole must of necessity be fertilized by the
decaying clothing of the vegetable world. . ...
? A deep rich black, loamy soil, containing abundance of vege-
table matter, predominates in the southern parts of the New Castle,
Home, and Midland districts; in the peninsula of Prince Edward,
and about Kingston, the soil is more clayey; partial alluvial tracts
are to be met with along the courses of most rivers; and on the north
shore of Lake St Peter?s (formed by the widening of the St Lawrence)
is to be found one of great extent and inexhaustible fertility.* On
the whole the quantity of land incapable of tillage in Canada is ex-
ceedingly small.?
It is quite unnecessary to heap quotation upon quotation to
prove what no writer on Canada disputes, namely, that the soil
of Canada is rich in the extreme; that the good soil bears an
unusually large proportion to the inferior, and that, therefore.
. chantage enjoyed by the Australian colonies. Certainly they require less
labour at the outset, but this advantage is purchased at the expense of a
comparatively poor soil. This we shall hereafter further explain!
? Note by the author of the article.??An extensive proprietor in that
neighbourhood informed me that he is now cropping land that has been
cropped for forty years in succession, without manure. The soil is cer-
tamly twenty feet deep in some parts, so that deep ploughing is all that is
wanted to get at a new virgin soil.?


COMPARATIVE PROSPECTS OF OUR NEW COLONIES. 147
the return for a moderate portion of labour is generally large.
It is not even necessary to use the plough at first?not, indeed,
until the first pasture is broken up. The seed is at first merely
harrowed in, and a good crop is the certain result. Ihe quan-
tity of seed sown, too, at first is very small, never, indeed, moie
than a bushel and a half of wheat per acre, and the ciop is moie
certain and equal than in any other country. A
The severity of the Canadian climate is certainly a drawback,
considered in reference to the feelings of the settlers, but it is
certainly not unfavourable to agriculture; on the contrary, the
severity is more than compensated by the great steadiness and
certainty of the seasons. That the climate is highly favourable
to health, too, there is no doubt. Canada is subject to very few
diseases, and they are not of a fatal character. Almost the only
prevalent disorder is the ague of Upper Canada, which, however,
seems to fly before the progress of settlement. The writer we
have already quoted gives the following summary of the climate
of the Canadas ?
?Canada, though situated many degrees southf of England, is
subject to an intensity and duration of cold unheard of even in t e
northern countries of Europe. From the beginning of December to
the end of April the Avhole of Lower Canada is under snow to the
depth of several feet, and all the out-door occupations of husbanc iy
are suspended. In Upper Canada, however, the winter is both
milder and shorter; in the most favoured parts being not more than
half as long as in the district of Quebec; indeed, even the island of
Montreal, and in the southern parts of the districts of Montreal and
Three Rivers, some mitigation of the extreme duration mentioned
above is experienced. This severity of winter appears, at first sight,
much worse than it really is. The great fertilizing power of the
snowt is some compensation to the husbandman; and the gicat
heat and steady weather which prevail during the summer months
produce a rapidity of vegetation, which never fails to astonish and
delight the recent European settler. . ~
?Mr Philemon Wright, an extensive proprietor and very able
farmer at Hull, one of the Lower Canada townships on the Ottawa,
assured me, that the snow so effectually prevents the frost from
fretting into the ground, that he can commence his field-work m the
spring, sometimes as much as three weeks earlier than in the southern
parts of the state of Vermont, whence he originally came, though there
the winter is there, apparently, much shorter. 1 bus much may be

said of the influence of the Canadian climate on agriculture and
agricultural industry. First, everything which will grow in Great
Britain will arrive at perfection in Canada, but in a much shorter
time. Second, many tilings which either will not succeed in Great
Britain, or, at all events, not very well, and only at a great cost,
arrive at perfection in Canada without difficulty; witness tobacco,
Indian corn, rice, melons, peppers, &c. &c. Third, the out-door
employments in winter being so few in number, the farmer is driven
to become a manufacturer also; hence the distribution of employ-
ments (division of labour) is very incomplete, and all the advantages
which spring therefrom are lost to Canada. Fourth, all live stock
must be housed, a circumstance which necessarily increases farm
buildings to an alarming extent, and prevents the adoption of one of
our great modern agricultural improvements, namely, feeding off a
turnip crop. The singular anomaly exhibited by America in point
of climate, when compared with the same parallel of latitude in
Europe and Asia, has been ably discussed, and, I think, satisfactorily
accounted for, by a gentleman who has done more for the agriculture
of the colony of and for which he wrote, than all other societies and
individuals taken together. I allude to John Young, who, by means
of pseudonymous letters,* subsequently acknowledged, written in a
manly, nervous, and Junius-like style, succeeded in arousing the
farmers of Nova Scotia from ignorance and apathy, and in raising
the agriculture of the colony from the very lowest state to one of
respectability at least.
? He shows, that two thousand years since the climate of Europe
was precisely similar to that of America at the present day; in sup-
port of which he quotes many authors of antiquity.f Of this fact
there can be no doubt; it remains only to account for the change
which has since been brought about. Here, X think, Mr Young has
been particularly successful. He attributes the change-first to the
extirpation of the forests and the draining of the morasses; secondly,
to the increase of population and consequent evolution of animal
heat, and the warmth communicated to the atmosphere by the fires
within the houses: thirdly, to the extension of tillage, the process of
putrefaction alone generating considerable heat.
? The_ same causes,? Mr Young infers, ? will work the same
changes in the American climates, but much more rapidly, as the
progress of settlement by civilized people is infinitely quicker than
it could have been in Europe in the barbarous ages, indeed the expe-

rience of a life is now sufficient to mark the most important changes;
even within the last few years the climate of Canada has certainly
become considerably milder. There is nothing, therefore, in the cli-
mate, either of Upper or Lower Canada, to prevent the most unli-
mited extension of almost every description of produce capable of
being raised from the earth.?
Owing to the vast extent of country, of which the great chain
of waters emptying itself into the ocean by the Gulf of the St
Lawrence is the natural outlet, the commercial position of the
Canadian ports is unrivalled. The reader has only to turn to a
map of North America, and he will find three great chains of
water communication, which, with their tributaries, divide between
them the whole of the North American continent, and bring
almost every acre thereof into practical communication with the
old world. These three great arteries are the Mississippi dis-
charging itself into the Gulf of Mexico, the great American
Lakes, and the river St Lawrence, flowing into the Atlantic
Ocean, and the Hudson communicating also with the Atlantic
Ocean at the great central commercial emporium, New York.
The head waters of all these rivers spread themselves over the
great western country, comprising those vast fertile tracts which
are as yet but thinly settled, but which, for all practicable pur-
poses of colonization, may be deemed almost inexhaustible. The
several tributary streams of these mighty rivers seem to compete
for the conveyance of the produce of the ocean to the interior of
the country; and it is the great, the unexampled facilities of
internal communication which they afford, which must render
New Orleans, New York, and Montreal, three of the most im-
portant commercial cities in the world.
Throughout America, too, a thorough conviction prevails, of
the great importance of improved facilities of water communica-
tion, and the fact that nature has done so much seems rather to
stimulate man to add to the facilities, than to render him idly
content with those which exist. The improvement of inland
navigation perpetually occupies the American legislatures.
Canals and railroads connect most of the navigable streams in
the settled parts of the country, and even at times anticipate
colonization by acting as its pioneer. In this disposition Canada
largely participates. Where the rivers are obstructed by rapids,
canals have been constructed to avoid them. The Welland Canal
connects the Lakes Ontario and Erie, avoiding the Falls of
Niagara. The Rideau Canal connects Lake Ontario with the
Ottawa River, and by the Grenville and 'Lachine canals with
Montreal. The Chambly Canal connects Lake Champlain with


the River St Lawrence. The Laprairie railroad does the same
by another route. Canals and railways are in progress in every
part of Upper Canada, and now that tranquillity is restored, they
will be prosecuted with fresh vigour. The ? Edinburgh Cabinet
Library? gives ample details respecting the internal communica-
tions in the Canadas, and moreover gives a list of votes of money
to be raised by way of joint-stock associations or loans, amount-
ing to upwards of 930,000/. in the year 1837 alone.
As the population of the Canadas, now upwards of 1,100,000,
and of those parts of the United States lying on the great lakes
increases, the commerce of the country will necessarily increase
also. A large internal trade will also be carried on between the
Canadas and the adjacent states, and the country will become at-
tractive to the merchant and tradesman as well as to the agricul-
turist.
The population of Lower Canada, as our readers must be
aware, is chiefly of French extraction ; that of Upper Canada is
wholly of British descent. Until the late troubles, which were
certainly brought on by fostering a minority against the interests
and wishes of a popular assembly, the two races mingled together
in perfect amity. The French of Lower Canada are a simple,
kind-hearted people, wanting, however, that restless energy which
characterises the English people. They have been grossly op-
pressed during the suspension of their constitution, but now that
tranquillity is restored, and a representative constitution once more
established, the Canadians, being represented and backed by a
considerable number of members who sympathise with them from
Upper Canada, will be secured from the brutality of a dominant
faction, and the good understanding which formerly existed be-
tween the two races will be gradually re-established.
Canada has suffered as much as any one of our colonies by the
improvident granting of land. Certain reserves for the use of
the church and the crown were scattered through the country ;
individuals obtained large grants of land which they could not
cultivate; two land companies, established on the worst possible
principles, obtained large tracts for a mere nominal price, so that
there was scarcely any new country less attractive to the capi-
talist. It was also as little attractive to the labourer; and it was
only the poorest class, who could not go elsewhere, who went out
to Canada.*

A further evil is to be found in the forced timber trade, which, as we
have already shown, inflicts as much evil on Canada as upon the mother


As a proof of this, wages in Canada are not so high as one
might be led to expect in a new country. Ten dollars a month,
with board, are ordinary wages in Canada. This is equal to
18s. Bd. currency, or not over 15s. 6d. sterling a week. Sixteen
dollars a week would be called high wages for a good farm la-
bourer ; which is only 255. Bd. per week, or 21s. 6d. Mechanics
will earn 6s. or 'Ts. a day. This is much below the rate of wages
in the Australian colonies. Within the last ten years, however,
some improvement has taken place in Canada. have
been more sparingly made. Since the year 1881 the principle of
sale has-been in force in Canada, and land has generally risen in
value. Capital has consequently flowed into the country, and,
with the present prospect of tranquillity, it is probable that emi-
gration thither will not be confined to the poorest class.
The attention of capitalists has often been directed towards
Canada and New Brunswick ; but their operations have been
carried on with a total disregard of principle, and with the dis-
advantage of being surrounded by a vast territory administered
in defiance of system. The Upper Canada Company, the Lower
Canada Land Company, the New Brunswick Company, are in-
stances of want of success from the causes we have named.
At this moment, we happen to know that there are men ot
capital and intelligence, many of whom have been successful
colonizers of the Australian colonies, ready and willing to embark
capital to any amount, and to apply a sound system to Canada,
which all must admit to be an excellent field. So long, how-
ever, as a bad system is continued in the administration of the
waste lands, ?so long as they are the objects of favouritism, capi-
tal will be kept out of the country, and both wages and profits
will be absolutely low. Ihe class of capitalists we have alluded
to are cognizant of a better system, and they will not locate then
capital where it will be surrounded by lands administered on the
worst possible plan.
If Government would give them the guarantee of a sound
system, they would at once embark their capital and energies,
which have been so effective in the Australian colonies, in the
colonization of Canada; but until that is done, they will abstain
from so doing, and Canada will remain as a receptacle for the
poorest class of emigrants, who, after all, only make the St Law-
rence the high road to the higher wages of the United States.
Enough has been said of Canada generally to show that it is
country. See ? Westminster Review,? vol. vii, p. 126 ; and ? London Review,
vol. iv, for October, 1836.


not an ineligible field for colonization. It has suffered much
from mismanagement, but under a better system it undoubtedly
possesses the elements of prosperity, and the means of comfort
and happiness. Society is there considerably advanced. Ihe
cities of Quebec and Montreal have each a population of about
30,000, and both Upper and Lower Canada have many thriving
towns and villages. This is alone a considerable attraction to
such as have been accustomed to the society of towns. But, as
we have already stated, the facility of reaching Canada is the
feature which will always give it a preference among those whose
limited means necessarily circumscribe their field of choice.
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward?s Island
are in character so similar in most respects to Canada, that we
shall simply refer our readers to the volumes of the i Edinburgh
Cabinet Library,? already quoted. As places of settlement, they
are generally less attractive than Canada; yet they enjoy peculi-
arities which may render them more so to some persons. Hali-
fax, in Nova Scotia, enjoys a splendid harbour, and has become
a great emporium for the inter-colonial trade. r l he fisheries of
Nova Scotia also flourish, and the coal mines are a fruitful source
of wealth. New Brunswick is at present too exclusively occu-
pied with the timber trade; but in the absence of that pernicious
occupation, it is calculated to become a great grazing country.
Newfoundland does not properly come within our province as a
field for colonization; it is merely the seat of the cod-fishery,
and may be deemed a trading station rather than a colony in the
proper sense of the word.
We must now direct our reader?s attention to the southern
hemisphere, where the peculiar features exhibited by our Aus-
tralian colonies, and particularly the great difference in the re-
spective social states of countries differing but little in their phy-
sical character demand especial notice.
Australia is the general name given by modern geographers to
that great insular continent lying immediately south of Asia, in
the Pacific Ocean, and comprising what was formerly known as
New South Wales and New Holland. It extends from the tor-
rid to the temperate zone ?from latitude 9� to 38� south, and
from 112� to 150� east longitude. It is 3,000 from east to west,
and 2,000 from north to south; its circumference has been esti-
mated at 8,000 miles, and its superficial extent is nearly equal to
that of Europe.
Very little is known of the interior of the country; the northern,
north-eastern, and north-western portions of the coast are very
imperfectly known, and our settlements occupy a mere broken


belt of territory, extending around the southern portion of the
continent, and not reaching the 30th degree of south latitude, on
either coast.
These settlements are now four in number, namely. New
South Wales, on the eastern coast; Port Philip, a dependency
of New South Wales, situated at the southern extremity ; South
Australia, immediately adjoining it, to the westward; and
Western Australia, including the colony of Swan River, on the
western coast, a little further north. An inspection of the map
will make the situation of these colonies clear. New South
Wales and Western Australia are in nearly the same latitude on
the western and eastern coasts, the only difference being that the
former comprises a greater extent of country than the latter.
South Australia corresponds with the southern portion of New
South Wales, Adelaide being about one degree south of Sydney,
and Port Philip lying south of all.
Van Diemen?s Land is an island situated to the south of Aus-
tralia, and separated therefrom by Bass?s Straits. It extends to
43� south latitude, its length from north to south is 200 miles,
and its breadth is about 160 miles. It has been computed to
contain about fifteen millions of acres, which is about the super-
fices of Ireland.*
New South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land are convict colo-
nies ; Port Philip has been voluntarily colonized by free settlers
from both of these colonies, and latterly from England; South
Australia deserves notice as the first field chosen for the applica-
tion of the principles of colonization described in this paper; and
Western Australia is chiefly remarkable for that notable blunder
in colonization already noticed.
Compared with other countries, Australia furnishes the concep-
tion of a country in an imperfect state of formation.- Vast and
nearly barren plains cover a large portion of its surface, volcanic
action has been extremely sparing, and it seems to want an uni-
versal upheaving?a complete breaking up of the surface?to
render it an eligible habitation for man. The whole animal race
differs from that of other countries, and appears to connect the
present with a former world. Man is there in his lowest known
stale.
The mountain ranges are few, the country is extremely ill-
watered and unsheltered, and the fertile portions consequently
bear a small to the whole extent of country as yet

the Suffolk street Gallery.

land.


traversed, which is computed to be only one eighth of the whole
surface. As this is the temperate portion, it is probable that the
greater part of the country to the north is not habitable.
Within the last nine years our knowledge ot the whole of that
portion of Australia lying to the southward of the thirtieth parallel
of latitude, has been greatly extended by the enterprising exer-
tions of Sir Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General of New
South Wales.
A runaway convict, named George Clarke, alias ?the barber,?
who had for some time eluded the police, had, when arrested, given
an account of a large river to the northward, which he called the
Kindur. He also described vast plains lying north of the then
limits of the colony, together with other rivers, especially the
Nammoy, and a burning mountain which he had seen when ap-
proaching the sea. As vague accounts of ?a great river beyond
Liverpool, plains ? had often been received, and as Sir Thomas,
then Major Mitchell, had for some time contemplated a general
survey of Eastern Australia, the verification of ? the barber?s ?
accounts was not inconsistent with his original plan ; and the first
of three expeditions* was accordingly undertaken in 1831-2.
The result of this expedition was the determining of the courses
of several rivers, which, pursuing a north-westerly direction,
empty into the Darling, the general course of which is south-
west, until it falls into the Murray.
In a second expedition, undertaken in 1835, the whole course
of the Darling was traced, with the exception ot fifty or sixty
miles a little to the northward of its junction with the Murray.
The Bogan had been previously traced, as it was by that route
that Major Mitchell proceeded on his second expedition.
In the following year the rivers Darling and Murray were
again visited; the greater part of the southern portion of Aus-
tralia, called by Major Mitchell Australia Felix, traversed. The
Glenelg was at this time discovered.
We have been favoured by Messrs Boone with the smaller
map from the second volume, which will serve to render this brief
and imperfect account of the several routes intelligible; but we

regret to say we are precluded from doing the work full jus-
tice by the peculiar character of this paper. Major Mitchell?s
general summary, however, we find admirably adapted to our
purpose, and we shall not hesitate to draw largely from it.
? Released from the necessity for recording each day?s proceed-
ings,? says Major Mitchell towards the conclusion of his second
volume, ? I may now add a few general remarks on the character
of the country traversed in these various expeditions.
?It has been observed that the soil of IVew South Wales is good
only where trap, limestone, or granite rocks occur. Sandstone,
however, predominates so much more than all these as to cover
about six-sevenths of the whole surface comprised within the bound-
aries of nineteen counties. Wherever this happens to be the surface
rock, little besides barren sand is found in the place of soil. De-
ciduous vegetation scarcely exists there ; no turf is formed, for the
trees and shrubs being very inflammable, conflagrations take place so
frequently and extensively in the woods, during summer, as to leave
very little vegetable matter to return to earth. On the highest
mountains, and in places the most remote and desolate, I have always
found on every dead trunk on the ground, and living tree of any
magnitude also, the marks of fire; and thus it appeared that these
annual fires extend to every place. In the regions of sandstone, the
territory is, in short, good for nothing, and, besides, very generally
inaccessible, thus presenting a formidable obstruction to any com-
munication between isolated spots of a better description.
? Land near Sydney has always been preferred to that which is
remote, where the quality may have been equal; yet throughout the
wide extent oftwenty-three millions of acres, only about 4,400,000 acres
have been found worth having, while the owners of this appropriated
land within the limits have been obliged to send their cattle beyond
them for the sake of pasturage.??-Vol. ii, p. 325.
After expressing an opinion in favour of convicts working in
gangs, but not amalgamated with the people, as the only means
of constructing roads from one fertile district to another, whereby
? even the sandstone wastes, extensive though they be, might be
overstepped, and the good parts being connected by roads, the
produce of the tropical and temperate regions cotild then be
brought to one common market,? Major Mitchell thus continues:
? Where there is so much unproductive surface, the unavoidable
dispersion of population renders good lines of communication more
essentially necessary, and these must consist of roads, for there are
neither navigable rivers, nor, in general, the means of forming canals.
This colony might thus extend northward to the tropic of Capricorn,
westward to the 145 th degree of east longitude, the southern portion
having for boundaries the Darling, the Murray, and the sea coast.
Throughout the extensive territory thus bounded, one third probably


consists of desert interior plains, one fourth of land available for pas-
turage or cultivation, and the remainder of rocky mountain or
impassible to productive country. Perhaps the greater portion of
really good land within the whole extent will be found to the south-
ward of the Murray, for there the country consists chiefly of trap,
granite, or limestone. The amount of surface comprised in European
kingdoms affords no criterion of what may be necessary for the
growth of a new people in Australia. Extreme differences of soil,
climate, and seasons, may indeed be usefully reconciled and rendered
available to one community there, but this must depend on ingenious
adaptations aided by all the facilities man?s art can supply in the
free occupation of a very extensive region. Agricultural resources
must be ever scanty and uncertain in a country w'here there is so
little moisture to nourish vegetation. We have seen, from the state
of the Darling, that all the surface water flowing from the vast
territory west of the dividing range, and extending north and south,
between the Murray and the tropic, is insufficient to support the cur-
rent of one small river.??P. 3 26.
The country which appears to be most eligible for settlement
is that portion lying to the southward of the Murray, which Major
Mitchell named Australia Felix. It is much more mountainous
than any known part of Australia, is better watered, and the fer-
tile tracts bear a much larger proportion to the desert plains than
in the country to the northward. We do not wish the reader to
feel satisfied with the following summary, as no part of Major
Mitchell?s book is more interesting than his third expedition, in
which he traversed this ? happy ? district.
? The country,? he continues, ? southward of the Murray, is not
so deficient in this respect (alluding to the scanty agricultural re-
sources above described), for there the mountains are higher, the
rocks more varied, and the soil consequently better; while the vast
extent of open grassy downs seems just what was most necessary for
the prosperity of the present colonists, and the encouragement of
emigration from Europe.
? Every variety of feature may be seen in these southern parts,
from the lofty Alpine region on the east to the low grassy plains in
which it terminates on the west. The Murray, perhaps the largest
river in Australia, arises among these mountains, and receives in its
course various other rivers of considerable magnitude. These flow
over extensive plains, in directions nearly parallel to the main stream,
and thus irrigate and fertilize a great extent of rich country. Fal-
ling from mountains of great height, the current of these rivers is
perpetual, whereas, in other parts of Australia, the rivers are too
often dried up, and seldom indeed deserve any other name than
chains of ponds.
u Hills of moderate elevation occupy the central country between


the Murray and the sea, being thinly, or partially wooded, and
covered with the richest pasturage. The lower country, both on the
northern and southern skirts of these hills, is chiefly open, slightly
undulating towards the coast on the south, and, in general, w T ell
watered.
? The grassy plains which extend northward from these thinly
wooded hills to the banks of the Murray are chequered by the
channels of many streams falling from them, and by the more per-
manent and extensive waters of deep lagoons, which are numerous
on the face of these plains, as if intended by a bounteous Providence
to correct the deficiencies of a climate otherwise too dry for an in-
dustrious and increasing people, by preserving in these abundant
reservoirs the surplus waters of the large river; and, indeed, a finer
country for cattle stations than this can scarcely be imagined.
? In the western portion, small rivers radiate from the Grampians,
an elevated and isolated mass, presenting no impediment to a free
communication through the fine country around its base. Hence
that enormous labour necessary in order to obtain access to some
f�arts, and for crossing continuous ranges to reach others, by passes
ike those so essential to the prosperity of the present colony, might
be in a great degree dispensed with in that southern region.
? Towards the sea-coast on the south, and adjacent to the open
downs between the Grampians and Port Philip, there is a low tract,
consisting of very rich black soil, apparently the best imaginable for
the cultivation of grain in such a climate.
?On parts of the low ridges of hills near Cape Nelson and Port-
land Bay are forests of very large trees of stringy bark, iron bark,
and other useful species of eucalyptus, much of which is probably
destined yet to float in vessels on the adjacent sea.
? The character of the country behind Cape Northumberland
affords fair promise of a harbour in the shore to the westward. Such
a port would probably possess advantages over any other on the
southern coast, for a railroad from thence along the skirts of the
level interior country, would require but little artificial levelling,
and might extend to the tropic of Capricorn, or even beyond it, thus
affording the means of expeditious communication between all the
fine districts on the interior side of the coast ranges, and a sea-port
to the westward of Bass?s Straits.
? The Murray, fed by the lofty mountains on the east, carries to
the sea a body of fresh water sufficient to irrigate the whole country,
and this is in general so level, even to a great distance from its
banks, that the abundant waters of the river might probably be
turned into canals, for the purpose either of supplying natural de-
ficiencies of water at particular places, or of affording the means of
transport across the wide plants.
? The high mountains in the east have not yet been explored, but
their very aspect is refreshing in a country where the summer heat
is often very oppressive. The land is, in short, open and available


in its present state for all the purposes of civilized man. We
traversed it, in two directions, with heavy carts, meeting no other
obstruction than the softness of the rich soil; and in returning, over
flowery plains and green hills, fanned by the breezes of early spring,
I named this region Australia Felix, the better to distinguish it
from the parched deserts of the interior country, where we had
wandered so unprofitably and so long.?? Mitchell, vol. ii, p. 328.
The interior of South Australia and of Western Australia is
at present but little known, the scientific examination of those
colonies by competent persons having been conducted merely in
contemplation of the immediate wants of the colonists. All that
is accurately known, therefore, must be understood as being con-
fined to the narrow limits of the present settlement. So far the
accounts are favourable as to the soil and climate of both these
colonies. Around Adelaide, the principal town of South Aus-
tralia, a large proportion of the soil is fit for cultivation or pasture,
and some of it is represented as extremely fertile. Still there is
the same paucity of water which Eastern Australia exhibits. The
only accounts of the interior have been furnished by those enter-
prising men who have driven flocks and herds from New South
Wales; and from the excessive sufferings of some of these, we
may infer that the country preserves the same character as Major
Mitchell found to prevail in those districts which he traversed. If
we were to take the representations of those who have written from
the colony, we should be inclined to say that South Australia has
rather the advantage of Eastern Australia in point of soil; but,
making some allowance for their very limited opportunities of
observing, and correcting them by such accounts of the unsur-
veyed country as have reached us, we believe our inference of
the similarity of South Australia to Eastern Australia will be
much safer than an implicit reliance on the accounts from the
colony. These accounts will be found carefully collected and
arranged in Stephens?s South Australia,* certainly the most com-
plete work on the subject.
Of the salubrity of the climate of South Australia, there can-
not be a doubt. The extreme heat of summer is the greatest
inconvenience, and during November, December, and January,
a disease of the eyes is very prevalent; but, with this exception,
the climate is especially favourable to health, and the mildness of
the winter renders it an eligible place of residence to the con-
sumptive.

COMPARATIVE PROSPECTS OF OUR NEW COLONIES. ]
Since the establishment of the colony in 1836, they have not
experienced such severe droughts as have almost spread famine
in New South Wales; but it is nevertheless true that, during
the summer, the colony always suffers from deficiency of water.
As yet but few useful and fertilizing streams have been dis-
covered, though a careful examination of the country may possibly
unfold many such to the northward of the Murray, and flowing
either into that river or into St Vincent?s and Spencer?s Gulfs.
Much has certainly been written about South Australia, but thereal
evil respecting it is that the name South Australia represents at pre-
sent but a small extent of examined country. The accounts, there-
fore, give us the appearance of knowledge rather than knowledge
itself; and until a more systematic survey of the colony is under-
taken, it is impossible to say whether it is capable of supporting
a large or only a small community.
As settlement spreads, it will possess a great advantage in the
River Murray, which is certainly the finest river yet discovered
in the Australian continent. This river flows within the limits
of the colony, and hereafter it will be rendered available for the
purposes of commerce and of irrigation. But this must be a
work of time. At present it is distant from the seat of settle-
ment. If the Murray had flowed into the sea by a broad and
navigable embouchure , it would have imparted an entirely dif-
ferent character to the province; but the river is lost in a salt
lagoon, called Lake Alexandrina, which struggles into the sea at
the head of Encounter Bay, through a narrow and shallow outlet,
which is not navigable even for boats, and, as far as present evi-
dence goes, can never be made so. As the colony makes pro-
gress, and under the excellent system which there prevails it
will do so rapidly,?the Murray may be made to communicate
with Gulf of St Vincent by means of a ship canal, as the
distance is under fifty miles and the country quite practicable for
the purpose.
Thus much may be safely said of South Australia, that, as
far as our limited knowledge at present extends, the colony
enjoys a fair share of the elements of prosperity, and is capable of
establishing a much larger population than can possibly occupy
the country before it is better known; and although it is certainly
inferior in physical advantages to Australia Felix, there is every
reason to believe it is equal to the older portions of New South
Wales. v
Ihe view we take of the physical character of South Australia
is fully borne out by a very recent letter, which appeared in the
?Colonial Gazette? of the 14th October. It is dated April 2,
and the ? Colonial Gazette? tells its readers that it is ? from one of


the most intelligent and respectable among the best-informed
among the settlers,? and that it ? gives a very good summary of
the present state of South Australia.? .... ? Others, also, among
the best informed and most influential of the colonists share in
the opinion expressed by the writer, as to the style of culture
which is likely to prevail in the settlements?
?As a colony, we are proceeding steadily and successfully". The
streets are not paved with gold, but there is an ample field for the
employment of capital and industry to very great advantage. Those
who have declared that we never could grow corn, are somewhat
astonished at the returns from some of the tillage farms this last
harvest, and will be much more astonished next year, for a good deal
of land will be under the plough. Indeed I expect that the imme-
diate neighbourhood of Adelaide will, sooner or later, be all culti-
vated as corn land, the complaints of the barrenness of the soil in
this particular being positively disproved by facts. Our progress in
exploration has not been equal to our wishes. After you travel a
hundred, or a hundred and twenty miles to the north-west from
Adelaide, your progress is interrupted by a belt of thick scrub, which
stretches away to the eastward until it reaches the Murray, and runs
along the northern bank of that river for a considerable distance.
This belt has never been penetrated to the northward, and therefore
our country beyond is, as to its character, quite conjectural. To
the west, on the other side of Spencer?s Gulf, it is, as far as we know,
very indifferent, no rivers running into the sea all along the coast,
from Port Lincoln to our western limit.
u I have had a trip in the bush myself, having travelled along the
north bank of the Murray eastward as far as our boundaries extend.
It is a noble river, and the scenery along its banks very beautiful; but
the good land is very limited. The natives are much finer men than
those about Adelaide, more intelligent, more ingenious, and more
warlike and daring. We had to keep a good look out night and day.
For one quarter of an hour only were we at any time off our guard,
and during that solitary occasion they stole three blankets and a
bundle of small things tied in a handkerchief. We never slept
without a guard, and every man with his gun loaded at his side.
I never had my clothes off except to bathe. With due precaution,
however, there is no need for alarm, or any danger of attack ; and I
believe the whites are uniformly to blame. The overland parties
generally contain two or three or more runaway convicts of the worst
class, and these fellows get into mischief on account of the women.
I believe it false that the natives disregard this promiscuous inter-
course. It is true that we had several offers of the kind from the
natives; but they were uniformly more ready to remain with us, and
to lay aside their fears, when they found that their ladies did not
find favour in our eyes.
? Our town is increasing rapidly in size, and improving in appear-


ance. Good two-story brick bouses and stores are superseding our
earlier and ruder efforts, and many bouses bave been pulled down
and rebuilt in handsomer style. I assure you that there are a dozen
shops in one street that would by no means disgrace the Strand or
Cheapside, Our exports this year will be considerable. The revenue
from the customs alone is now 30,000/. per annum. We have two banks,
and you may form some notion of our transactions by the fact that the
profits of one of them have been 10,000/. per annum, and that with six
clerks; the pay counter on a Saturday is quite as crowded as a
London banker?s. I say nothing about politics, for * * * my
opinions may savour of prejudice. But I may say that the money
he [the Governor] is spending will do the colony infinite service,
if anybody mill honour his hills. His positive instructions are to spend
about 20,000/. per annum. His actual outlay exceeds 200,000/. If
anybody will pay the piper, so much the better; but I suspect they
will not, and then away goes our colony into the hands of the Colo-
nial Office, and our fine theories to the winds. I feel sorry, how-
ever, after so much has been done to prevent this, such should be
our end ; and I feel vexed sometimes to hear the assurances of his
Excellency?s toadies that he intends no such thing.?
The physical character of Western Australia differs consider-
ably from that of South Australia, in the manner in which the
country is watered. In South Australia, as the above letter
states, ? there are no rivers running into the sea, all along the
coast from Port Lincoln to our western limit,? * whilst along the
whole coast of Western Australia, from latitude 30� south, the
northern limit down to 35�, where the south coast tends to the
eastward of King George?s Sound, a great number of small but
fertilizing rivers empty themselves into the ocean. The line of
coast between the limits we have named, and extending eastward
and inland about four degrees, has been tolerably well examined,
and an inspection of the map of Mr Arrowsrnith will show that
it is a most promising country for colonization. Speaking of the
rivers, bays, and harbours, a recent account says :
? The principal rivers of Western Australia are the Swan, the
Avon, the Canning, the Murray (not the larger Murray, to which
we have repeatedly alluded), the Harvey, the Preston, the Collie,
with its tributary the Brunswick, the Yasse, the Blackwood, the
Donnelly, and the Klagan, which last is situated to the south-west
of the settlement. It is not to be denied, however, that, if we except
a river recently discovered by Captain Grey to the north of the
settlements, and which has been named, after the present Governor,
the ? Hutt,? no rivers of magnitude have yet been observed in
Western Australia.
* This leaves ample room for the discovery of rivers flowing into Spen-
cer?s and St Vincent?s Gidf and the River Murray.
Vol. XXXV. No. I. M


? Of bays, inlets, and harbours, the most notable are Shark?s Bay,
Breton Bay, Melville Water, Gage?s Roads, Owen?s Anchorage,
Cockburn?s Sound, Safety Bay (or Warneborough Sound) Peel
Inlet, Koombanah Bay and Leschenault Inlet, Geographe Bay,
Flinder?s Bay, Tor Bay, King George?s Sound, and Doubtful
Island Bay.?*
Besides the rivers above named, there are several which have
been met with inland, and imperfectly traced, and a considerable
number of mere brooks pouring into the sea along the whole line
of coast.
The mountain ranges which the maps exhibit sufficiently ac-
count for the existence of these rivers, so indispensable to fer-
tility. There are also to be found, ?
(t Dense forests of the majestic mahogany tree * * and gigantic
gum trees (Eucalyptus) of several species, 150 feet high. * * Valleys
and luxuriant pastures spread themselves through various districts,
and especially in those of the south-west, where pools of fresh water,
springs, rivulets, and brooks, are of frequent occurrence, their pre-
sence being attested by the lively verdure of the vegetation. The
banks of the rivers are, in many places, picturesque, and flowers of
all hues paint the landscape, charm every eye with their beauty, and
beguile the fatigue of the traveller. In many places the shores are
covered with rushes of great height and thickness. Prodigious
thistles and ferns are met with eleven or twelve feet high. Thickets of
accacia and cypress contribute to variegate the scene. The summits
of the hills are studded with magnificent Angophoras , and the botanist
notices in his rambles the different species of Leptospermum , Metrosi-
deros, Melaleuca (or Australian tea-tree) Viminaria , Daviesia, An-
thropodium and Anigozanthus , with many other plants and flowering
shrubs.?? Western Australia , p. 32, 33.
A country exhibiting these features cannot be deficient in
fertility. Sir James Sterling speaks highly of the soil, and other
writers agree with his testimony.f ?In Western Australia,?
says the ? Perth Gazette,? ? the numerous rivers, inlets, or lakes
and lagoons are generally bordered by slips of rich alluvial flats,
and frequently backed by some extent of stiff loam, which, though
of difficult cultivation at first, is reducible to tillage with manure.
Tillage and pasturage should be combined.? . . . . ? Crops in

COMPARATIVE PROSPECTS OF OUR NEW COLONIES. 163
general,? says a Swan River farmer, <e were very abundant last
harvest; wheat, on the best soils, in several instances averaged
thirty-two bushels per acre on land that had been only once
ploughed, and without manure.? . . . . ? It is in the
4 Third Annual Report of the Western Australian Agricultural
Society,? ? says Mr Buckton, 44 that, by recent explorations, the
existence of extensive pastoral districts in the interior has been
ascertained.? . . . . 44 The whole of the country around Les-
chenault,? says another writer, 4 ? seemed to be of a very superior
quality, and extends in one unvaried mass for twenty miles from
the sea coast into the interior, connecting itself with the Basse
district to the south, and that of the Murray to the north.
Further north, too, the country promises well when settlements
extend towards the tropical regions:?
44 The recent arrival here of Mr Grey,? say the Western Agii-
cultural Society, 44 who has been engaged in examining the north-
west coast of the colony, has given us the very agreeable intelligence
of the existence of a country most peculiarly suited to the growth of
cotton and sugar. Several rivers of considerable extent and magni-
tude, large tracts of soil of the most fertile character and a natural
vegetation of the most luxuriant description, situated in the suitable
latitude, and within easy access of a supply of Indian, Malay, and
Chinese labourers, present a combination of advantages rarely to be
met with in the British dominions, and which, it is believed, the
British government will not long continue to overlook. ?Buckton,
p. 43.
Our limits compel us to content ourselves with these general
extracts respecting the geographical character of the Australian
colonies. It should be observed, that what is there called fer-
tility is something very different from the extreme richness of
America. In Australia, sandstone, as we have seen, prevails
universally ; and as there is a general scarcity of streams the land
is unsheltered. There is, consequently, but little decayed vege-
In America the absence of wood is the criterion of sterility?
its presence is, therefore, deemed indispensable to fertility. It
has been either ignorantly or dishonestly urged in favour of Aus-
tralia, 44 that it does not require clearing:? the expense of clear-
ing is more than compensated by the superior productiveness of
the first year?s crop, Australia is, in fact, a pastoral, not an agri-
cultural country. There is no country in the world better
adapted to the rearing of sheep and their rapid increase, and the
few casualties to which they are subject constitute the clue
attractiveness of the country. All the Australian colonies seem
sensible of this, and great individual enterprise has been displayed


in driving flocks overland from New South Wales to the country
about Port Philip and to South Australia. In three years South
Australia had accumulated 120,000 sheep. Western Australia
has about 30,000, and Port Philip perhaps nearly 100,000.
The exportation of wool from Sydney and Van Diemen?s
Land goes on steadily increasing; in 1830 the quantity exported
was nearly 2,000,000 lbs.; in 1835 it exceeded 4,000,000 lbs.;
and in 1839 it was 8,000,000 lbs. Thus doubling itself in
periods of less than five years.
Now, in the production of wool, Australia enjoys an advantage
which is somewhat analogous to the rent of the most fertile land in
old countries. The demand of the consuming countries greatly ex-
ceeding the power of supply possessed by Australia, and no
other country being able to produce so cheaply, the price is kept
up to the European cost of production. Thus they enjoy a spe-
cies of monopoly price. This has hitherto been the case with
the cotton of America. It is now scarce sixty years since cotton
was first exported from America, and this year the production is
about 600,000,000 lbs. The following has been its progress in
round numbers:?
1790 - - 1,000,000
1800 - - 35,000,000
1810 - - 85,000,000
1820 - - 160,000,000
1830 - - 350,000,000
1840 - - 600,000,000
Ihe price of cotton, owing to the large demand created by our
continually improving machinery, has generally exceeded the
cost of production. I his has greatly stimulated production, and
yet not so rapidly as the demand increased ; hence the cotton of
America has gone on displacing successive portions of eastern
cotton until the former now occupies nearly all the channels of
consumption. And so it will be with Australian wool. The
consumption of foreign wool alone is in England 50,000,000 lbs.
The greater portion of this will probably be displaced by the wool
of the Australian colonies. In like manner it will gradually
cease to be worth while to raise sheep for their wool in many of
the countries which now produce it. T here are some of the finer
qualities which, at present, Australia cannot produce. The great
bulk of the wools of medium quality consumed in Europe will,
we have no doubt, be supplied by Australia, and so large is the
demand that it is difficult to conceive a limit thereto.
With this increased facility of production it is not impossible
that the manufacture of woollens will greatly increase in this
country; ?that England will, in short, enjoy that pre-eminence
which she has attained in the case of the cotton manufacture,
partly from the cultivation of the raw material in America,


Having dwelt upon the similarity of physical character exhi-
bited by all the Australian colonies, we must detain the reader
for a short time on their social varieties.
We have already stated that New South Wales and Van Die-
men?s Land are convict colonies, and that South Australia, until
within the last few months, stood alone as a colony settled on the
principles laid down by Mr Wakefield.
One of the effects of transportation, or rather of the assignment
system, was to place a body of convict slaves at the disposal of
the employers of labour. A readier recipe for rendering labour
disgraceful, for keeping down wages, and for separating the po-
pulation into the two classes of slaves and their tyrant masters,
could not have been devised. The description of society which
transportation could not fail to establish was detailed at length in
the first number of the ? London Review,? published in April,
1835, and we shall content ourselves by stating here that it was
such as no well-wisher of his race could desire.
It had, however, the effect of rendering the two penal colonies
attractive to capitalists, for the convict masters grew wealthy with
great rapidity. Wool-growing itself is a lucrative operation ;
but when the labour by which it is carried on is compulsory, and
unpaid beyond the mere keep of the labourers, who might be
ill-fed and ill-treated to any conceivable extent, it became doubly
profitable.
Transportation still continues, but the assignment system is
abolished, and the flock owners and other capitalists are already
complaining of the withdrawal of labour. Wages, now relieved
from the competition of unrewarded labour, are advancing, and
these colonies, considered merely in reference to wages, are
becoming attractive to the labourer. But wages do not alone
constitute happiness, and it will require a considerable transfusion
of a sounder population before the colonies in question will be
highly attractive to any class of persons. At the present moment
convictism pervades every institution, influences every custom,
modifies the very habits of the people, and affects the tone of
society at large. This, no doubt, will be corrected in the course
of time, but the process of correction will necessarily be slow?
a disadvantage which is worthy the consideration of all who are
engaged in choosing a country. There is good reason to believe
that much improvement has been for some time going on. The
proportion of convicts is much smaller than it used to be, and the
large emigration from Great Britain to the Australian colonies
within the last three years must considerably have diluted the
tone of convictism there. Government has recently set a fixed
and uniform price upon the land, and if the proceeds, or even a


large proportion of the proceeds, be devoted to the conveyance of
labourers, the necessary transfusion will proceed more rapidly,
and the colonies in question, now becoming attractive to labourers,
will continue to be attractive to capitalists.
In point of social condition, South Australia undoubtedly stands
first in rank among the Australian colonies. This is certainly
not owing to any superiority of soil, climate, or other physical
advantages. In the two essential features of soil and supply of
water, South Australia is surpassed by Australia Felix and West-
ern Australia. Climate must also be somewhat influenced by the
character of the surface of the respective colonies ; and although
the salubrity of that of South Australia is undoubted, we cannot
think it is as favourable to production as that of Australia Felix,
the country watered by the southern tributaries of the Murray,
and tempered by the influence of the Australian Alps. It is
to the principles on which South Australia is colonized she
owes her prosperity?a prosperity unexampled in the previous
history of colonization. It is not four years since this colony was
first settled, and her population already numbers upwards of
15,000. The town of Adelaide alone has a population of up-
wards of 6,000, with churches, chapels, schools, a college, three
or four newspapers, and various societies connected with science;
a bank, an exchange, a theatre, shops and warehouses, together
with numerous institutions, bearing witness to the completeness
of the society there established. It was urged against those prin-
ciples that their tendency was to keep down wages : there is not
one of the Australian colonies where wages are so high as in
and around Adelaide; and so they must continue as long as the
system is pursued, or until the eligible land is fully occupied.
At present a cloud hangs over South Australia. The governor
has spent about ten times as much as he was expected to do; the
commissioners have refused to honour his drafts; a loan which
they had attempted to negotiate in the city has not been taken
up, and emigration has been put a stop to. This is perhaps the
proper remedy. Colonel Gawder?s extravagance has been coun-
tenanced by the people of the colony, and it is but right they
should be warned of the evil of extravagance by feeling its con-
sequence in a scarcity of labour.* Until this question is satis-
factorily settled, and emigration recommences, we should say it
would be extremely dangerous to the small capitalist to settle in
South Australia.

the subject of a notable blunder in colonization. The extract
given in the early portion of this paper from Mr Wakefield?s
evidence before the Committee on Waste Lands in 1836, de-
scribes or characterises this failure. The Western Australian
Company alludes to the difference between South Australia and
Western Australia in the following manner:?
? The colony of Western Australia?possessing a fertile soil and
a salubrious climate?evidently affords greater facilities for com-
merce than the other Australian colonies, from its greater proximity
to Great Britain, the Mauritius, and the Cape of Good Hope, and
from being within easier reach of the densely-peopled and productive
countries of Asia and the rich Indian Archipelago ; yet, notwith-
standing these manifest and acknowledged advantages, Western
Australia has almost remained stationary, whilst the comparatively
recent* colony of South Australia has risen into a degree of import-
ance, and attained a state of prosperity not less astonishing than
advantageous to those who embarked in the formation of that settle-
ment. Its principal town, Adelaide, already possesses streets, squares,
churches, markets, banks, seven or eight hundred stone or brick
houses, with six thousand inhabitants, although less than four years
ago its site was a desert distant six hundred miles from any habita-
tion of civilized man. This greater progress of the younger colony,
with less natural advantages, proves the superiority of the method
of colonization pursued with respect to it, over that which had been
adopted in Western Australia.
?A new era for the latter colony has now, however, commenced.
Her Majesty?s government have determined to apply to the older
colony the principles of colonization, which have had such eminent
success in South Australia; and the Western Australian Company
has been found to co-operate in those views by the investment of
capital in the acquirement of land and the conveyance of emigrants
and settlers to the most favourable point which could be selected
upon the western coast of the continent of New Holland, within the
boundaries and under the jurisdiction of the colony of Western Aus-
tralia.?
The spot at first chosen for the field of the company?s opera-
tions was a district lying in the neighbourhood of Port Lesche-
nault, to the northward of Geographe Bay. This district was well
enough suited for the purposes of the company, but, by one of
those fortunate accidents by which human plans are sometimes
changed for the better, the company have been compelled to shift
the scene of their operations to a much more eligible field.
The first site of Australind had been acquired of one of the
first grantees : and by a land regulation of 1829, there was reason

to believe that it had become forfeited to the Crown.? The
opinion of the law officers of the Crown here was against the
forfeiture, and the Colonial Office sanctioned the sale to the
company; but, in the meantime, the local government of West-
ern Australia resumed the land, and there was reason to fear that
they might have sold portions of the land before the company?s
commissioner could take possession. A knowledge of this cen-
tre temps reached the company in October ; but at the same
moment a remedy was placed within their reach, in a country
just discovered by Captain Grey, lying north of Swan River,
and possessed of natural advantages far superior to those of Port
Leschenault, or indeed any other part of Western Australia.
This country lies between Gantheaume Bay and Arrowsmith
River, and is laid down in the annexed map, with which we have
been favoured by the Western Australian Company. It is de-
scribed by Captain Grey as being more fertile than any other
portion of Western Australia. The country is elevated to the
very sea-coast, a feature which is generally the concomitant of
fertility. There is also an abundance of limestone?another
evidence of fertility; and the country is well wooded, which is
the American test of soil, and, we believe, a pretty sure one.
In one part Captain Grey saw ? gently sloping hills and
valleys, affording good food for sheep and cattlein another,
they ? travelled three miles south by east, through a country of the
nature above described, and found a spring of water nearly every
half mile then they ? passed several ponds of water, and saw
several emus and kangaroos.? ? The country next became
densely wooded (a mark of good soil) with a species of tea-tree.
* * * * For the next four miles,? says Captain Grey, ? we tra-
velled south by east along the native path, which ran through a
low country, composed of rich soil, and which produced abun-
dantly the barren or native yam, which always grows in the most
fertile tracts.?
Like the rest of Australia, this district is without any navigable
river; but it enjoys a considerable number of small fertilizing
streams, and is throughout well supplied with water. The dews
are also abundant, and from the general character of the country,
droughts seem to be out of the question.
But the grand feature of this part of Western Australia is un-
doubtedly the magnificent port, which has been named after its
discoverer, Port Grey. Port Leschenault, though very service-
able in a maritime point of view, is, in fact, only a roadstead, ?
well sheltered, it is true, but still a roadstead. Now Port Grey
is a well-protected harbour, and is in every respect well suited
for the location of the future commercial capital of the western

coast, the more especially as it enjoys a great extent of fertile
back country.
With regard to the country around Port Grey, we can only
afford a short quotation, so limited is the space which, in this
very general article, we can devote to each colony.
? The country between these two ranges was an open grassy
valley, thinly wooded, and it appeared to be one of the most exten-
sively fertile portions of country which I had yet seen in Australia.
u After travelling for another mile over the sandy downs, we
reached another romantic glen-like valley, bounded both to the north
and south by steep limestone cliffs ; we descended these cliffs, and
at their base found, as in the last valley, we had crossed extensive
flats, through which wound a water-course ; we had to scrape a hole
in the bed of this, in order to obtain water; all the hills I could see
in the vicinity consisted of limestone, and for the whole distance I
could see to the eastward (about seven or eight miles) the country
appeared to be of the most fertile and picturesque character; the
hills were slightly wooded with large timber, and the valleys were
nearly bare of trees, and covered with grass.
? On ascending the limestone hills to the south of the valley, we
found ourselves once more on open sandy downs: after travelling
three miles across these in a south by east direction, we again came
to a valley of the same character as the one above described; it ran
from the same direction; to the eastward we saw a fertile country,
and it was as picturesquely wooded as the valley we had before
crossed. After crossing this valley, we found ourselves once more
on open sandy downs resting on limestone, and four miles in a due
south direction across these, brought us to a valley of the same cha-
racter as those just described ; in the water-course in it we found
plenty of water in pools, and we halted for some time immediately at
the foot of Mount Fairfax.
? We continued our route in the evening over the sandy downs,
which, at the distance of half-a-mile from the sea, terminated in
cliffs, beneath which lay an under-cliff, which fell gradually until it
met the dunes on the coast. There appeared to be good feed all
along this under-cliff. After travelling three miles we halted for
the night.?
On the subject of climate we cannot do better than make a
short extract from a speech delivered by Mr Wakefield at a
meeting of the purchasers of land and settlers under the com-
pany to consider the change of site. In answer to a question,
Mr Wakefield said,?
? Although latitude, no doubt, exercised a most important in-
fluence, there were many other circumstances which modified the
effects of latitude, and the chief of these circumstances was the gene-


ral elevation of the country. He should illustrate this position by
calling their attention to Mexico, because what he should state was
well known. In parts of Mexico, in the course of a few hours?
drive, you may pass from the climate of the tropics to the region of
snow. In the plains above Vera Cruz sugar is to be seen growing
with tropical luxuriance ; proceeding inland, the traveller first passes
the climate of the mulberry and the olive?the climate of Naples.
Soon he reaches the district where the currant and the gooseberry
may be cultivated?fruits which will only thrive in a temperate
climate. At length he approaches those higher regions, where no-
thing is to be found but the hardy pine. (Cheers.) Thus, then,?
he continued, ? we must look to elevation as well as latitude; and,
finding that the country around Port Grey was considerably ele-
vated, he came to the conclusion, without requiring further testi-
mony, that the climate cannot be oppressive. (Cheers.) He was
further confirmed of this by what was going on in Eastern Australia
or New South Wales. There the disposition of the colonists was
decidedly in favour of what has been named New England, which
was nearly in the same latitude as Port Grey. He would also men-
tion that Captain Grey?s testimony was to the effect, that the climate
of Port Grey is both agreeable and salubrious. He was, therefore,
strengthened in his opinion that the resumption of the original land
was a happy accident. (Cheers.)?
On the whole, it is evident that the change is greatly to the
advantage of the company; and we have no doubt but that
Australind will, in a few years, be a most thriving colony.*
Of the Australian colonies generally, we must remark that the
recent adoption of a fixed and uniform price for land has alone
introduced an element of prosperity. All the colonies are com-
plaining of a scarcity of labour. The convict colonies, in par-
ticular, deprived of the slave labour to which they have been
accustomed, are naturally the most clamorous. Hence a con-
siderable portion of the land fund must be expended in emigration,
or sales will entirely cease. By fair management, these colonies
may be rendered much more attractive than they have ever been.
The example of South Australia and New Zealand shows that
there is no good reason why a colony should cost the mother
country one shilling. A self-supporting colony has an irrefra-
gable claim to self-government; and as the first-named condition
?the only condition on which colonies can be deemed sound in
principle?is as important to the mother conntry as the last-

named is to the colony, let the former be the purchase-money,
so to speak, of the latter. The mother country would then hold
her colonies?
? With chains so light,
?Twere not worth while to break ?em.?
New Zealand now demands our notice, and we approach the
last colony on our list with a feeling of regret that the multiplicity
of topics into which we have been compelled to enter leaves us so
little space to devote to what must certainly be deemed the most
remarkable chapter in the history of British colonization.
The position of the islands of New Zealand in reference to Aus-
tralia will be best understood from the annexed map. As a field for
colonization, they enjoy every possible physical qualification. Situ-
ated about fourteen degrees nearer the equator than Great Britain,
their climate is considerably milder; and whilst it has been found
that the soil and climate? generally are admirably adapted to
the culture of grain, and especially wheat, the productions of
southern Europe?the vine, the olive, the fig, and the mulberry
?attain remarkable perfection. Droughts, such as occur so
frequently in Australia, are utterly unknown in New Zealand.
The surface of the country is uneven ; in the centre of both
islands there are snow-clad mountains, from which descend a mul-
titude of fertilizing streams. The stately forests of New Zea-
land bear witness to the richness of the soil.* The remark-
able luxuriance of vegetation has been noticed by every one wdio
has visited the country, and the salubrity of the climate is equally
conspicuous.
We must leave particular description for the present, and con-
tent ourselves with a reference to the best sources of information,!

and proceed at once to place before our readers a very brief nar-
rative of the colonization of the island.
All that was known of New Zealand, from the time it was first
visited by Cook until the year 1814, was most discouraging to
any scheme of colonization. In that year, however, an enthu-
siastic missionary, named Marsden, with that union of benevo-
lence, courage, and perseverance which must vanquish all obstacles,
set foot in New Zealand for the purpose of christianising and
civilising a population then deemed the most ferocious savages in
the known world. He succeeded in establishing a mission, and
if all his successors had possessed his sincerity and his disinterested-
ness, the New Zealanders by this time would have been a com-
paratively civilized people.* Unhappily, however, many of the
servants of Christ have sought their own aggrandizement rather
than the welfare of the native inhabitants, and have been foremost
in despoiling the natives of their land, without caring for the
consequences that ensued.
About the same time, or shortly after, fear of the cannibal
natives having become considerably weakened, New Zealand
became a receptacle for runaway convicts from the penal
colonies. This irregular and lawless colonization went on un-
checked until the present year. As law had not established
its dominion in New Zealand, the country well suited those who
were habituated to the indulgence of their passions; and in 1839
the Bay of Islands, the spot where those outcasts of an outcast
population had established themselves, was described as ,f a hell
upon earth.?f
Many years ago, therefore, the question of the colonization of
New Zealand had been practically settled?had become wholly
inevitable. In 1839, nearly three thousand persons of European
descent occupied the northern island, and all that remained to be
decided was, whether colonization of the worst kind, tending to
the utter annihilation of the natives, should be permitted to go on
unchecked, and anarchy be thereby perpetuated, or whether it
should be so systematically undertaken as to plant in New Zea-
land an energetic and moral people, capable of neutralising the
foul influences which had been for some time at work.
For the purpose of promoting colonization of the best kind,
without any expense to the mother country, a considerable num-
ber of gentlemen associated themselves together in 1837, under
* A generation having elapsed, there has been just time, by operating

Durham.? Smith and Elder. 1839.


the title of the New Zealand Association. This patriotic body
consisted of two classes of members, those who were desi-
rous of emigrating, and those who were willing to promote the
colonization of New Zealand on public grounds only. Their
object was to get a bill through Parliament, or to obtain a char-
ter from the Crown, to colonize the islands in the same way that
South Australia was established?by means of commissioners to
administer the land fund, without profit to the undertakers, with-
out charge to the mother country.
A consequence of this scheme would have been toput a complete
stop to the irregular colonization which had for so long a period
been carried on, together with the wholesale jobbing in land, or
land-sharking, of which the Church missionaries have been the
leaders. In a pamphlet published by Mr Wakefield in 1837, and
in the evidence given before the Lords? Committee in 1838, ample
details were given of the numerous and extensive acquisitions of
territory by the Church missionaries from the native chiefs, so
that to introduce systematic colonization was only, in other
words, to put an end to missionary gains.
This result seems to have been shrewdly foreseen by Mr Dan-
deson Coates, the lay secretary of the Church Missionary Society;
and he therefore very prudently (humanly speaking), but not
very humanely, determined to use the whole power and influence
of the society to thwart the plans of the New Zealand Associa-
tion. Missionary land-sharking, in short, was to be preserved at
all hazards, even ft) the extent of denying its existence against
the most solemn testimony.
Unfortunately at first for the success of the New Zealand Associa-
tion?and we may emphatically add, unfortunately for the cause
of humanity?Mr Dandeson Coates had the ear of the Colonial
Minister of that day, Lord Glenelg, who was, we believe, a
member of the Church Missionary Society, and like all men who
adopt class biases, he seemed more desirous to screen the delin-
quent members of that body than to purge the society from the
contamination of unworthy members. Accordingly, the part of
the land sharks, lay and clerical, was vehemently taken against
the association by the Colonial Office, and it would probably
have continued to this day, had not Lord John Russell pos-
sessed sufficient firmness to take the matter into his own hands.
When Lord Glenelg was applied to by the association for the
sanction of the government to their proceedings, they were told
their wish could not be complied with, as they were not a trading
company; and as all idea of profit was entirely repugnant to the
views of the association, they did not feel themselves in a situa-
tion to accept hjs lordship?s offer. They then applied to Parlia-


meat, had a bill brought in, modified that bill to suit the views of
Lord Howick, and had the mortification of seeing it thrown out
after all. Thus, then, for a time missionary opposition was effec-
tual, and missionary land-sharking continued triumphant.
Some individuals who belonged to the emigrating section of
the association were not to be daunted by this first defeat. They
passed a resolution, that they would not abandon their project,
and in the autumn of the same year they were again organised,
and endeavouring to bring their darling scheme to maturity.
Their first efforts were unsuccessful; they failed to get up the
company; they had few members in addition to those who were
connected with the old association, and some of their leading
men were beginning to evince a disposition to abandon the scheme
in disgust, when Mr Wakefield took part in their measures, and
the present New Zealand Company is the result.
The New Zealand Company commenced its operations in the
spring of 1839, by dispatching a vessel, the Tory, to purchase
land of the native chiefs. The independence of the chiefs had
previously been solemnly recognised by the government; a flag
had been sent out, and a mockery, called a declaration of inde-
pendence, was gone through at the Bay of Islands. It there-
fore became evident, that so long as this independence was
recognised, British subjects might purchase land of the native
New Zealanders just as they might in France?(provided there
was no alien law against it) ?of Frenchmen. The difficulties to
which this declaration of independence would give rise could not
have been contemplated, or ? the Office? would in all probability
have pursued a different course.
The course which ought to have been pursued, in conformity
with well-established principles of international law, was simple
enough. Her Majesty?s sovereignty ought to have been asserted
throughout New Zealand, by virtue of prior discovery and occu-
pation. This right of sovereignty should be understood to have
force only against all European powers; but the rights of the
chiefs should be in all cases guaranteed. The only restriction
on the right of the chiefs should be a prohibition against their
selling lands to individuals. The Crown should enjoy the sole
pre-emptive right, and no individual should be permitted to ac-
quire a good title, except from the Crown or the Crown?s grantees.
But the Colonial Office willed it otherwise; and from that time
until very recently, the existence of New Zealand as a ? substan-
tive independent nation? has been insisted upon against reason,
against humanity, and we may add against law.
Neither the New Zealand Company, nor the energetic body
of men who were about to embark their fortunes in the colony,


were persons to be daunted by this doctrine. They wisely de-
termined to take advantage of it, and treat the chiefs as sove-
reigns in their own territory, well perceiving that at no very
distant period they would convince the under-secretary that he
was incapable of looking one day in advance?that he could not
trace an event to its more immediate, to say nothing of its re-
mote, consequences.
In the instructions given to Colonel Wakefield, who went out
in the Tori/, his attention is particularly directed towards Cook?s
Strait, as forming part of the great highway between the Austra-
lian colonies and Great Britain. As, however, our space is
extremely limited, we must content ourselves with referring our
readers to the appendix of Mr Ward?s 4 Information,? where the
instructions will be found at length, and by stating that in this
respect he has completely fulfilled the wishes of the directors, by
acquiring the whole of the southern portion of the northern
island, and the northern portion of the southern, sometimes called
the Middle Island, comprising both shores of the strait. It
should be observed that he acted entirely on the doctrine laid
down by Mr Stephens of the ? substantive independence? of
the chief. He did not acquire the sovereignty of any portion of
New Zealand for the Crown ; he simply acquired the land under
the native chiefs, and according to the custom which they recog-
nised.
There is one feature in the instructions which cannot be over-
looked. Up to the date of these instructions the history of colo-
nization has been a record of perpetual injustice towards the
aboriginal races. Civilization having been found difficult and
extermination easy, the latter has been openly practised. Very
recently in Van Diemen?s Land a small body of aborigines were
hemmed in, and shot down in cold blood by a few Europeans;
and when the government took some steps to bring the monsters
Avho perpetrated it to justice, the press raised an outcry against
punishing men for shooting ? monkeys and an intimation was
held out, that if this course were persevered in, it would be
necessary to find some more secure mode of getting rid of the
? vermin.? The mode recommended was to dose wheaten bread
or cakes, of which the natives are very fond, with arsenic! and
we learn from a letter from a private friend that the method in
question is actually adopted around Port Philip. He says ?
� Some of the white people here treat them (the natives) most
shamefully; for the slightest offence they kill them and drop their
bodies in some creek, and some have been known to leave about
dampers , a species of bread baked in the bush, in which arsenic has
been previously put, for the very purpose of destroying the blacks.?


Even in South Australia, where a better system of coloniza-
tion has planted a much sounder and more moral population, and
where the natives have been in some respects better treated, they
have been unceremoniously robbed of their land; and it was left
for the New Zealand Company to put in practice a plan by which
the native population may be made to partake of the advantages
of colonization, and derive therefrom the blessings of civilization.
The views of the New Zealand Company in this behalf will best
appear from the following extract: ?
a It may be doubted, whether the native owners have ever been
entirely aware of the consequences that would result from such ces-
sions as have already been made to a great extent of the whole of
the lands of a tribe. The danger to which they are exposed, and
which they cannot well foresee, is that of finding themselves entirely
without landed property, and therefore without consideration, in the
midst of a society where, through immigration and settlement, land
has become a valuable property. Absolutely they would suffer
little or nothing from having parted with land which they do not
use, and cannot exchange; but relatively they would suffer a great
deal, inasmuch as their social position would be very inferior to that
of the race who had settled amongst them, and given value to their
now worthless territory. This consideration was first suggested by
the New Zealand Association of 1837, and it has great weight with
the present company.
? One-tenth of the land-orders will be reserved by the company
for the chief families of the tribe by whom the land was originally
sold, in the same way precisely as if the lots had been purchased on
behalf of the natives. The priority of choice for the native allot-
ments being determined by lot, as in the case of actual purchasers,
the selections will be made by an officer of the company, expressl}'
charged Avith that duty, and made publicly responsible for its per-
formance. Wherever a settlement is formed, therefore, the chief
native families of the tribe will have every motive for embracing a
civilized mode of life. Instead of a barren possession, with which
they have parted, they will have property in land, intermixed with
the property of civilized and industrious settlers, and made really
valuable by that circumstance; and they will thus possess the means,
and an essential means, of preserving, in the midst of a civilized
community, the same degree of relative consideration and superiority
as they now enjoy in their own tribe.?
The company have acquired about 20,000,000 acres. Out
of this wide territory, they first allotted 110,000, of which 11,110
were reserved, and were worth, at the moment they were drawn,
as many pounds; they are now worth in London upAvards of
30,000/.
The natives of New Zealand evince a much greater aptitude


for civilization than any other aboriginal people known, except
the South Sea Islanders of the same race. They never were
hunters, as the North American Indians are, because, strange
to say, New Zealand possessed no animals before Cook left
there the pig, the dog, the cat, and the common Norway rat.
The circumstance, therefore, which in all probability made them
cannibals, made them also cultivators?a state somewhat removed
from utter barbarism. A consequence of their being cultivators
enabled them to exist on a smaller breadth of land, and their
destruction was not a necessary consequence of the limitation of
the quantity of land. They readily embrace other employments;
they become expert whalers, skilful seamen, and readily learn the
use of mechanical tools in ordinary use. They have frequently
built boats after the European fashion, and even schooners of consi-
derable tonnage; and there are some small vessels owned in the
Bay of Islands and Sydney, manned wholly by New Zealanders.
They understand the contract for wages, and work willingly for
hire; and, since the recent settlement of Port Nicholson, they
have become most useful and willing assistants of the colonists.
Another circumstance greatly in favour of the ultimate civiliza-
tion of the native tribes, is the comeliness and the attractiveness
of the women. Many Europeans are married to native wives,
and they are universally allowed to make good wives and mothers.
It is : necessary to mention, however, that chastity is not much
cared for whilst they remain single. This is probably the result
of their intercourse with the abandoned class of Europeans, who
have been the chief colonizers of New Zealand. It should be
observed, that this want of chastity does not carry with it any
moral degradation; they are not thought ill of by otheis, and they
therefore do not lose their self-respect. Indeed they have the
reputation of always doing what they believe to be right; they
are conscientious, and it is only because they do not think it
wrong that they are unchaste. All that remains, therefore, is to
alter thdiropinion respecting the value of chastity, and that same
conscientiousness which is so conspicuous in other respects, will
effectually render them chaste.
In bringing about improvement in this respect, the mission-
aries have certainly done much good. T hey have introduced
the Christian rite of marriage, and have its duties.
In like manner they have created a change of opinion respect-
ing the savage virtue of revenge, and have thereby converted
some of the most warlike and ferocious tribes into peaceful
communities. .
The first sale of lands, intended to constitute the first settle-
ment, took place in July, 1839. It realized 99,990/., of which

75 per cent., or 74,992/. 10s., was immediately available for the
purpose of conveying' people to the colony. Ihe company ac-
cordingly took up five ships, and subsequently two more, besides
which, before the year had expired, the Coromandel was sent out
on private speculation. Ihe number of passengers thus con-
veyed to New Zealand in 1839, was 1,123. On the 30th of
October, Mr Wakefield stated, that 2,274 persons had been sent
to New Zealand, and the company have still one more ship, and
some private traders are about to depart; the number, at the end
of the year, will most likely reach 2,600. The natives now working
for the settlers at Port Nicholson, and, we may say domiciliated
among them, amount to 800, and the number of settlers who have
arrived from the Australian colonies are, perhaps, between 300
and 400. But this mere statement of numbers cannot impart an
adequate idea of the nature of the colony. Many of the settlers car-
ried out with them considerable capital in the shape of every imple-
ment calculated to be useful. Mill machinery, both for sawing and
grinding, steam engines, agricultural implements, the frames of
houses, mechanical tools, and goods of every description, have
found their way to Port Nicholson, and it is difficult to conceive
a serious want which the settlers will be without the means ot
satisfying.
The moral and intellectual wants of the colony were also at-
tended to. A literary and scientific society was established here
previous to the departure of the first colony, and connected with
it a public library, to which the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Hinds,
and several other friends of the colony, contributed. Arrange-
ments have also been made for an infant school, open to the
children of the natives as well as of Europeans. This is beginning
the work of civilization in the most rational and proper manner.
Besides these measures, the first number of a newspaper,
entitled the ? New Zealand Gazette,? was published here, with
the intention of publishing the second number in New Zealand
as soon after the arrival of the first colony as possible. This in-
tention has since been fulfilled, and we have now before us
numbers 2 to 6, printed on the western beach of Port
Nicholson, the site of the future capital, Wellington.
We give a slight sketch of this magnificent harbour, with a view
of showing the exact position of Wellington ; but our nautical
readers will do well to provide themselves with an excellent chart
of Port Nicholson, published by Mr Wild, of Charing cross, in
which the bearings of every rock and shoal are accurately marked.
We may also mention, in this place, that a paper, ? exclusively
devoted to the colony of New Zealand,? was commenced in Lon-
don in February last, and now enjoys a considerable circulation.

It is published once a fortnight, and is now at its twenty-second
number.
The ? New Zealand Journal ? of London, in noticing the
second number of the Gazette ?the first published in the colony
?thus describes its contemporary :
? The second number of the ? New Zealand Gazette/ published at
Port Nicholson on the 18th April last, has just reached us, and
affords abundant evidence of the remarkable vigour of the new
colony. The paper itself is but little short of a miracle. The
colony has scarcely had time to empty itself and its motley
upon the beach of Port Nicholson, when forth there issues a pe-
riodical equal in appearance to any, and superior to most, of our
colonial journals.
? The impoi?tant portion of the * New Zealand Gazette? we have
extracted and remarked on in another place; here we have to do
with the ? minor excellences? of this curious production.
? The advertisements first attract our notice. First, we have the
great merchants?the Willises, and the Hunters, and the Partridges
?the future Barings of a future Britain ?advertising their dealings
to the little world around them. Then come the auctioneers, gene-
ral agents, and smaller dealers, offering, as it should seem, to supply
every possible want. One man announces ? the first shop opened
in Port Nicholson/ another ? has arranged to have a weekly
market on Monday and Saturday evenings.? Several partnerships
have been formed; and the advertisers of ? land for sale ? may suit
themselves with, at least, three buyers, who want land a little lower
down.
? A baker tempts his customers with the announcement of ? dishes
covered and baked on the same principles as in London, and on
moderate terms.? I F. Brady, boot maker, from the Old Kent
road/ carries on business in the ?bespoke line/ and it seems is
doing well, for he wants ? a town section of land?an early choice /
and John Turner, ? on the river side/ undertakes the making of all
kinds of clothes.
? Then the ? Gazette? wants ? two youths as apprentices to the
printing business/ and ? a compositor and pressman/ together with
< a person to cut, in metal or wood, a plan of the harbour.?
? Further, ?sundry inhabitants of Port Nicholson, not having
the fear of the long advertisement of the New Zealand branch of the
Union Bank of Australia before their eyes, advertise a public meet-
ing i to consider the propriety of establishing a Local Bank / and
lastly, as we make it a rule to tell the whole truth, poor Mr Lis-
combe tells the world that he has had a ? desk, a coat, and sundry kind
of hardware stolen from his tent,? and he offers a ? suitable reward?
for information as to their whereabout.?
In the several works we have quoted relative to New Zealand,
a large mass of evidence, relative to the eligibility of the country


as a field for colonization, was laid before the public before the
first colony departed. We are now in possession of the settlers?
first letters, and of the reports of the company?s officers, so that
we are now enabled to describe New Zealand out of the mouths
of the witnesses. An enlarged number of the ? New Zealand
Journal,? the sixteenth, is now before us, filled with letters of this
description from persons of all classes and both sexes, many of
whom never dreamed that their productions would appear in
print. Genuine letters, written to near relations and friends,
and conveying the vivid impressions of observant witnesses, they
arc, perhaps, as highly trust-worthy as anything of the kind in
existence.
We shall begin by offering some extracts relative to the pro-
ductiveness of the soil, and general features of the country.
Mr Duppa, a gentleman intimately acquainted with both the
theory and practice of agriculture, says :
? The soil is perfectly wonderful: the rapid growth of anything
planted in -it is something extraordinary. Every one appears to agree
that it is as capable of producing from five to seven quarters of wheat
per acre as any of the most highly-manured lands in England. A dense
forest, which has enriched the soil for ages, covers the country in
this district. The enormous expense of clearing?calculated at 40/.
per acre?is the greatest apparent drawback; but as wheat fetches
10Z. per quarter, and is likely to remain at that price for the next five
or six years at least, it .will amply repay for the outlay of capital.
The native potato-grounds show what the land is : they grow enor-
mous crops by merely scratching the ground with a sharpened stick,
and returning the smallest potatoes to mother earth when they grub
up the large ones. So far for the soil. Sheep and cattle farming is
altogether out of the question for the present; for you must first
clear a spot of ground in which your cow can turn round, and then
scour the country round to find food for her. Wheat, Indian corn,
potatoes, &c., are the crops from which a settler must expect to pay
for an outlay of capital, and they will pay right well.
? As an agricultural district, it (Port Nicholson) will not answer
for many years, inasmuch as it requires too great an outlay of capital
to do anything with it; and I question much whether there is the
hundred thousand acres of level land for those who have come out.
You will therefore say that the whole is a failure: but not so, for at
Taranaki, distant overland about sixty miles, there are millions of
acres of level land, which will not be nearly so expensive to clear,
with a much better river running through it, but unfortunately a
very poor harbour. The soil there is equally gcod as here?so report
says. Previous to making up my mind for a removal thither, I in-
tend going there myself; and if it should prove satisfactory, I shall
choose my town acres here, (for this will always be the principal


town,) and my country section there. * * ? * * For
an agriculturist, the first four or five years are those which will pay
best, as we shall not be able to supply ourselves until the expiration
of that time; and I well know that Sydney will not be able to spare
us any in the meantime. Wheat is now selling there at 10/. per
quarter, and was much higher a short time back. Oaten-hay itself,
which can certainly be harvested here twice, and probably three
times, in the course of the season, sells at 18/. the ton.?
As to the harbour of Port Nicholson and the country around,
the same writer says :
? The harbour resembles rather an inland lake than an inlet of the
sea, particularly when it is perfectly calm; which is not always the
case ?it being so squally and changeable a climate, as far as the
wind is concerned, that we are frequently threatened with an upset
when sailing about in our boat to bring our goods, or when on a
fishing excursion : but she, I mean the boat, is very stiff, and I have
acquired the art of managing her to such an extent as to secure my
safety in her. But to return to the harbour: it is surrounded with
mountainous hills, for that is the only way to describe them?being
a species of neither mountain nor hill, and yet both. They are partly
covered with a sort of bastard flax and long grass, which gives them
rather a barren appearance ; but it is fully compensated by the richest
description of forest timber which covers the remainder. At the
further end of the harbour is the mouth of the three rivers on which
the town is to be built. They flow down a valley of level land,
which is from four to six miles in breadth, and surrounded by hills
most densely covered with timber; as is likewise the valley itself,
excepting on the banks of the river, which have, at one time or other,
been cleared by the natives for potato-gardens; but those gardens do
not extend further than one hundred yards or so inland. The scenery
of these rivers, as you go paddling up them in a canoe, is most
enchanting: the principal river is as broad as the Thames at Rich-
mond, but too frequently interrupted by snags, which have in many
places formed bars, which must be removed before it can become
navigable for a boat of any size ; but a canoe, which does not draw
more than one and a half to two inches of water, can of course go
anywhere, and enable you to see it all, and a beautiful sight it is.
Picture a most enchanting serpentine river, overshadowed by trees
of richest verdure, emblossomed by every colour, enlivened by the
deep mellow and quaint notes of the ptui, or mocking bird, besides
those of hundreds of others equally rich and curious ; and every now
and then paroquets of the brightest greens and reds fluttering from
bank to bank, and adding their chattering notes to the general
concert.?
As to the favourableness of the climate to production, we have
the following testimony :
? The first two days after our arrival were rainy ; after that we


had a fortnight?s continued fine open harvest-weather. The three or
four last days have been alternately rain and sunshine?what would
be called fine growing weather in England. lam keeping a journal
of the weather, so that I shall be able to let you know exactly what
the climate is all the year round. April and September are the two
seasons for sowing; although I am given to understand that you
may sow all the year round with every chance of success, for there
is no such thing as frost in this latitude. I have had some land
grubbed up, and have sown some potatoes and garden-seeds, which
I expect to harvest before the wet season sets in, about ten weeks
from the present time.?
But the fact to which all the settlers bear witness, is the extra-
ordinary salubrity of the climate. We extract the evidence of
many witnesses:?
? 1 lam most thoroughly satisfied (says Mr Revans) with the
people and place ; indeed, I never attached myself before to any place
out of my own country, although, as you know, I have seen many of
our colonies, and not a little of other countries. lam really fond of
this place. lam in rude health ; I rise at five, and go to bed at
eight, and work and talk, and walk incessantly.?
? ? I am now living (says Mr Partridge) in a tent which I have
bought, for the house is not yet landed; and lam very well con-
tented that I have not yet been obliged to sleep with an umbrella over
my head, as most others have done. The climate is so fine that
everybody laughs at such things. My tent is full of goods, furni-
ture, pots and kettles, and all sorts of bedevilment.?
? ? My life (says Mr M?Gurk) is very different to what I led in
London?rise at five, breakfast and out to the woods at six o'clock,
returning home at six in the evening. It is very hard work, and I
am generally wet all day, as we have to cross over swamps; yet I
have not felt the least ill effects from it, and I like this sort of life
amazingly.?
? ? The climate (says the same) is salubrious; of that, I think, I
am a fair judge. I was swamped in a canoe the first day I came on
shore, and slept all that night in my wet clothes, not being able to
get off to the ship. Since that time I have been wet almost every
day, being obliged to do so in my vocation. Up to this time, I have
slept in a tent upon the sand; yet I have had no sickness, not even a
slight cold. Try the like of that in England; but before you do so,
go to the cemetery and choose your grave.?
? ? I am better in health (says Mr Duppa) than ever I was in my
life, although obliged to be exposed to all weathers, and though, living
in a tent, experiencing the most sudden changes of temperature.
Every one has thought fit to put on so healthy an appearance, that the
doctor who came out with us is in a terrible fright lest he should have
nothing to do: I, however, console him by making a calculation of
the number of births which are likely to take place in the course of
the year,?


u ? I have received your letter, per favour of Captain Smith (says
Dr Dorset), and am very much concerned at your illness ; and yet,
afterwards, I was rather pleased, as it is the most powerful thing I
can avail myself of to induce you to come out and join me. I con-
sider you, as well as myself, to have a permanent weakness of the
chest; and as long as you are exposed to the exciting cause (which
is the climate of England) you will have periodical attacks, one of
which may carry you off, or, at the least, make life anything but a
blessing. Well, now, to put a parallel case, which I consider my own
is, I can say that I never in my whole life enjoyed such health as I
have since my residence in this favoured land ; and I think I may
safely promise you the same riddance of your troublesome complaint,
W'hich, I again say, rests all with the purity of the air you have to
breathe ; and this climate will just suit you, judging from myself.? ?
The following passages relate to the prospects of the emi-
grants. Colonel Wakefield says :
<c ? February 12.?The energetic and combined movements of the
Orientals have quite changed the appearance of the banks of the
Hutt. Rows of native houses, single settlements, tents, and rick-
covers, already afford shelter to the whole of the passengers. The
Roxburgh emigrants have also united themselves in forming an ad-
joining settlement on the river. Furthest north are the Scotch party,
rather separated from their friends, and eyeing with satisfied looks
the rich land into which they are eager to thrust their spades. All
parties concur in praising the soil, which the best judges pronounce
capable of yielding the largest crops of wheat, and almost every
other produce. A scientific agriculturist decides on its superiority
to that of West Hoo, one of the most fertile spots in Kent.?
? ? The cannie Scots in the ? Bengal Merchant? (says Mr E. J.
Wakefield) are a capital set, landing every day, and wmrking away
at clearings and houses during the rain, while no other complaint
escapes them except the remark, in a good-humoured tone of voice,
that the weather?s ? rayther saft.?
?? No distinction (says Mr E. J. Wakefield) is made as y r et be-
tween different classes of labourers; the wages of all are 28s. a-week
in private employment; 20s. a week in the Company?s, 11s. sd. of
wEich is served out in rations.? ?
Those of the settlers who are in better circumstances appear
to be taking a fair share of the labour of settling.
? ? This day and the 23d (Feb.), (says Mr E. J. Wakefield) I
w r ent up the river, as far as the surveyor?s lines extend, and saw
Molesworth, Petre, Hopper, Sinclair, and an old schoolfellow', at
Bruce Castle, Mantell. They are all working away, in excellent
spirits, at houses made of flax, bark, and rushes, chiefly by native
architects, and at small clearings for potato-gardens, &c.?
? ? Molesw'orth, Sinclair, and Petre, and the aristocracy (says Mr


Partridge) arc setting a good example by working away. Fustian
coats and thick shoes are very fashionable, and you would laugh to
see officers, doctors, and dandies?digging, thatching, and chopping,
with great frenzy. The climate is glorious, and the country like a
paradise.?
? s A number of respectable people (says Mr Marjoribanks) are
here now?among others, Lord Petre?s son, Sir William Moles-
worth?s brother, and Sir George Sinclair?s eldest son. There is no
distinction of ranks here. All are seen carrying wood, trunks, boxes,
driving pigs, and, in short, doing many things that they would not
do at home. A new colony is a strange place.? ?
We could extend these extracts to a much greater length;
but the paper is already much longer than we intended; we must,
therefore, content ourselves with saying, that every settler of
every class seems perfectly satisfied with the country, climate,
and people, and there seems but little doubt that New Zealand
will immediately become the favourite colony of the Southern
Hemisphere.
We have still a few words to add, notwithstanding the length
to which our paper already extends, relative to the political ques-
tions affecting the colony. We have already stated, that the
colony was established without the sanction of the Government,
but it has since been acknowledged as a British colony;
and, more than that, the Colonial Office has voluntarily with-
drawn its opposition, and is at this moment availing itself of the
co-operation of the company to effect the systematic colonization
of these beautiful islands. The ? New Zealand Journal ?of the
sth Dec. contains the terms of a charter about to be granted to
the company, most favourable to the future prospects of the
colony.*
* We copy the particulars from this Journal, an ably conducted news-
paper, published every fortnight, by Chambers, 366 Strand. �.
? First. With respect to the adjustment relatively of the claims which the
Company has established to favourable consideration for themselves and
for the emigrants whom they have sent to New Zealand, the Company
having invested large sums of money in the purchase of lands in New Zea-
land from the native chiefs and others ; in the taking up, chartering, and
dispatching of ships for the conveyance of emigrants thither ; in the
maintenance of such emigrants before and during the outward passage ;
in the purchase and transmission of stores for the public use of the settlers
on their arrival ; in surveys ; in the erection of buildings, and the erection
of other works dedicated exclusively to the public service of the settle-
ment ; and in other heads of expenditure, or absolute liabilities unavoid-
ably required or reasonably incurred for the before-mentioned purposes,?
it is agreed that an estimate be forthwith made of this outlay, under the
different heads thus enumerated. In making this estimate, no items shall
he admitted which shall not be found to be just and moderate in amount,


The settlers, on their arrival, provided for the establishment
of the supremacy of the law and the effectual prevention
of anarchy. Even before their departure, they entered into
and fairly demanded by the exigencies of the service to be performed.
The above-mentioned estimate shall he made by one or more accountants,
to be named by Lord John Russell, and paid by the Company.
? When the amount of the above-mentioned expenditure shall have been
ascertained, the Company shall be secured by a grant from the Crown to
them, under the public seal of the colony, of as many acres of land as
shall be equal to four times the number of pounds sterling which they
shall be found to have expended in the manner and for the purposes before-
mentioned.
? The lands shall he taken by the Company in the neighbourhood of
their respective settlements at Port Nicholson and New Plymouth.
? Then follow ample provisions, in detail, as to the mode of selection.
? The Government will complete the survey of the external lines of
every-block of land assigned to the Company ; and the Company will be
allowed, in account with the Government, credit to the amount saved to
the Government, by leaving the interior survey of such blocks to be made
by the Company.
? The expense of surveys to be settled by a general scale.
? The Company to forego all claim to any lands purchased or acquired
by them in New Zealand, other than the lands so to be granted to them,
and other than any lands which they may hereafter acquire from the
Crown, or other persons deriving their title from the Crown.
? Out of the lands granted to the Company on account of their past ex-
penditure, the Company are to fulfil their contracts for the sale of lands to
settlers and others.
? The native reserves made by the Company to be sanctioned by the
Crown.
? Secondly. With regard to the incorporation of the Company, her Ma-
jesty will be advised to grant a charter for the term of forty years. The
charter to contain all such conditions as may appear to her Majesty?s Go-
vernment to be necessary for the good government of the Company, and for
the security of the public in dealing with them ; and to contain provisions
enabling the Crown to resume the charter, and purchase the lands and
other property of the Company on just and equitable terms, in case the
public interest should require such resumption and purchase.
? The objects of the incorporation to be the purchase, sale, settlement,
and cultivation of lauds in New Zealand, and the advancement of money
on the security of lands situated there, for promoting the cultivation of
such lands.
?As incidental to these main objects, the Company to be authorized to
purchase and hire ships, and to engage with emigrants for their passage
to the colony. Such management of emigration to be superintended by
the Government or its officers in this country and the colony.
? The Company to be expressly prohibited from engaging in banking, or
any other commercial undertakings.
? Thirdly. With regard to the powers of the Company, and the terms
on which the Government will hereafter deal with them, the Company may
acquire by purchase, except from the natives, any land in New Zealand
which they may think proper to buy.


a voluntary agreement to submit to law administered by func-
tionaries chosen by themselves ; but they were advised, as British
subjects, they could not legally do this. What, then, was to be
done? submit to anarchy? Not while there was a remedy; and
as New Zealand had been declared a ?substantive independent
nation,? the settlers took authority from the sovereign chiefs, and
so established that law which best suited them. That law was
British?it was the sanction only that was derived from the
chiefs.
In the meantime. Captain Hobson, who had been sent out as
Consul to the substantive and independent state of New Zealand,
with power to call himself Lieutenant-Governor over such terri-
tory as he could get the sovereignty of, obtained a cession of
the country north of the Frith of the Thames in January last.
Finding this plan of sovereignty by instalments would not do, he
at length, on the 21st day of May, wisely determined to de-
clare the whole of the island British territory, and thus cut the
gordian knot of all the difficulties about sovereignty. By thus
declaring sovereignty without waiting for the formalities of cession,
Captain Hobson necessarily reverts to the Crown, as acquired by
original discovery and occupation?a right, the assertion of which
necessarily invalidates the doctrine of the substantive nationality
of New Zealand. Let it be observed, however, that the right
declared is a right of sovereignty only, and not a territorial
right. All territorial rights must be acquired by purchase, and
that too with the reserve of one-tenth?the principle laid down
by the company.
Acting on Captain Hobson?s proclamations. Lord John Russell
has nobly come forward to promote the colonization of New Zea-
� When the Company shall at any one time purchase from the Govern-
ment 50,000 acres of land, and pay for the same in ready money, a certain
discount, together with allowance for surveys, shall be allowed on every
such payment.
? For the present, her Majesty?s Government engage that all sums of
money which shall be paid by the Company for the purchase of land in
New Zealand, shall, whenever such money shall be paid in this country,
be laid out in the removal of emigrants to New Zealand ; it being left to
the Company, from time to time, to determine whether such monies shall
be so laid out by the Commissioners of Colonial Lands and Emigration, or
by the Company themselves, under the superintendence and with the con-
currence and sanction of those Commissioners.
? Finally. Lord John Russell will instruct the Governor of New Zea-
land to recommend to the Local Legislature the enactment of a law having
for its object to incorporate as a municipal body, with the usual powers,
settlers who have, at the charge of the Company, resorted to Fort Nichol-
son, and settled themselves there or in that vicinity.?


land, and in so doing 1 will, as we have already said, avail himself
of the co-operation of the company, towards whom the Govern-
ment had certainly, up to a late period, placed itself in the false
position of an opponent and rival. But instead of fostering that
bitterness of spirit which such a rivalry sometimes generates in
official minds. Lord John Russell has taken a more magnanimous
part, and the result, we trust, will be that mutual confidence and
general good feeling between the Government, the New Zealand
Company, and the colonists, which must tend to accelerate the
prosperity of this most promising colony. H.S.C.

IF governments would keep two maxims in view?the respice
jiuem and the carpe diem ?if they knew themselves what
they meant, and seized the fit occasions to give effect to their
meaning, politics would not be the chaos of absurdities and con-
tradictions which they are.
An empire which, some hundred years ago, was great, alarm-
ing, invading, conquering, has, in the course of irresistible
events, been tottering to pieces. The Turkish power, which was
long the terror of the Christian world, has, under the weight of
its own corruptions and oppressions, been gradually sinking
into helplessness. Some provinces have been wrested by am-
bitious neighbours, others have fallen into uncontrolled anarchy;
some have become mere deserts by depopulation and decay;
some have been emancipated from the Osmanli intruders by the
more vigorous hands of their native races; while others have
been separated by negotiations and protocols, though left
seemingly connected by the flimsy thread of dependence upon
Ottoman sovereignty.
Whatever may have been the policy, it has been the practice
of the various states adjacent to the Turkish empire to seize upon
and to appropriate such portions as they could detach, and either
