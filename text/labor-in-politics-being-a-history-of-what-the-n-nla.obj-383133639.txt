HISTORY OF WHAT THE N.S.W. LABOR PARTY HAS DONE
AND WHAT IT HAS PREVENTED, FROM 1891 UNTIL
TO-DAY.
By George Black.
PREFACE.
[The opening chapters of the following work were written towards the end of 1893.
iblished first in the Workman, the demand for copies was so great that* 1 Labor in Politics
is issued as a pamphlet. A general election intervening, the brochure in nine months ran
rough several editions and had the phenomenal sale of about 90,000 copies, As the demand
atinues it has been decided to revise the already published portion, to eliminate therefrom
>st matters of ephemeral interest, to further develop some of the arguments, and bring the
»rk as a record of the doings of the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor party right up to date.]

While denying the allegation of total failure,
I assert that, even if the “ class representa-
tion ” description be fair, it contains nothing
that we need be ashamed of. We were elected
as a protest against purely class representa-
tion by that section of the community on
which all the others are built jup, in order
that barbarous laws might be repealed ; in
order that the “ jobs,” by means of which
the people’s rights and territory were yearly
circumscribed, might be exposed and defeated
in order that measures might be passed for
the protection of human life, as well as of
private property, and to compel governments
to cease aggregating huge estates by laftd
alienation, while building gaols for the
confinement of men made criminal by the
cruel conditions of a class-ruled society.
* * *
Admitting that we have partially failed,
our failure is by no means due to the weak-
ness of our cause. It is due partly to the
fact that we are not sufficiently numerous,
but chiefly to circumstances over which we
have no control, that is an irresponsible-
governing force altogether outside the arena
of our operation and influence. As to the
paucity of our numbers—it being ad raitted
that Parliament can only be deemed com-
plete when representation is general and
voting is on an equality, then it must be
conceded that as the wage-earners, and those
whose interests are indissolubly bound up
with theirs, constitute 80 per cent, of the
community, Labor cannot be fairly repre-
sented with less than 112 out of 141 members.
After the secession of Sheldon, we numbered
thirty-one.
Year after year, the daily papers have sat
tamely by, without a word of protest, while
lawyers introduced measures to make it more
difficult to become a member of that close
corporation, and to increase the cost of liti-
gation. They have quietly seen landlords
log-roll laws which placed tenants more
completely at their mercy; merchants and
manufacturers legislating for their own
aggrandisement; owners of barren acres
voting for unpayable railways, to increase the
value of their property, and charging the
State that thus enriched them £25 an acre
for the use of land that had cost them 20s an
acre. Only the other day, they witnessed in
silence a Ministry, largely composed of bank-
shareholders, introduce a measure which
made the State responsible for the solvency
of a number of insolvent banking institu-
tions. In silence, they saw the perspnally-
interested on both sides of the House unite to
make this measure law, and yet no word was
one of the strong points in the American
Constitution that no bank-director, nor
holder of bank-stock, should sit in either
branch of the legislature ; but in New South
Wales bank-directors and bank-shareholders
can control the legislature for their own
selfish ends, and, in place of condemnation,
the class-animated papers praise their
patriotism, while the leading spirit is testi-
monialised by the chief participants in the
robbery. In short, the “governing classes”
—2O per cent, of the community—might go
on till doomsday, legislating for their own
benefit, and the Press would find no words of
condemnation. But no sooner did the too-
long voiceless multitude (80 per cent, of the
whole population), open their lips in Par-
liament, than a shriek of execration went up
from every organ professing to be representa-
tive of “ the respectable portion of society.”
It was right and proper that 20 per cent,
should rule 80 per cent., but subversive of
law and order that the latter should attempt
to assist the former to govern. Yes, we
represent a class—a class so great that its
woes and wrongs, aspirations and needs,
rights and demands, are those of all
humanity. It refuses longer to be trodden
on and robbed in silence. The Labor party
represents its protest.
* * *
Says Walter Bagehot, a correct and careful
writer on Constitutionalism, whom no Con-
servative, however ignorant, would accuse of
being an agitator :—“ Parliament should
know what each section in the nation thinks
before it gives the national decision. This
is the true reason for admitting the working-
classes to a share in the representation. A
great many ideas, a great many feelings have
gathered among artisans —a peculiarly intel-
lectual life has sprung up among them.
They believe that they have interests which
are misconceived or neglected ; that they
know something which others do not know ;
that the thoughts of Parliament are not as
their thoughts. They ought to be allowed
to try to convince Parliament; their notions
ought to be stated as those of other classes
are stated; their advocates should be heard
as other people’s advocates are heard. , . .
As long as a great class, congregated in
political localities, and known to have
political thoughts and wishes, is without
notorious and palpable advocates in Parlia-
ment, we may prove on paper that our
representation is adequate, but the world
will not believe it It is vain to
demonstrate that the working-classes have no
grievances : that the middle-classes have done
all possible for them, and so bn, with a
Dr. Waugh's Baking Powder—Seldom Equalled, never Excelled


■crowd of arguments which I need not repeat,
for the newspapers keep them in type, and
we know them by heart. But so long as
there are no evident, incessant representa-
tives to speak the wants of artisans, there
will be a diffused dissatisfaction. Everybody
must say now, ‘our representative system
must be imperfect, for an immense class has
no members to speak for it.’ .... The
Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder—Purest and Best
way to stop the complaint that artisans have
no members is to give them members —to
create a body of representatives, chosen by
artisans, believing, as Mr. Carlyle would say,
‘ that artisanism is the one thing needful.’ ”
To quote from a very different source, one
of the American Knights of Labor states
that:—“Labor has never assumed govern-
mental control because it believed its cause
just and its means of securing justice ade-
quate. The cause remains just, but the
means have failed. A political party, or-
ganised for the express and specific purpose
of permanently settling the difficulties exist-
ing between capital and Labor, without any
alliances or entanglements with any other
party, will not only be certain of success, but
will be of inestimable benefit to peace and
social perpetuity. - ’
Such arguments will fall dully on the
general ear. The bulk of the wage-earners
are apparently not concerned about their
fate and the employing class are not accessible
to reason, while the Press will always uphold
the rights of property against the rights of
human life, until the publication of a Labor
daily compels the use of more circumspection
in the interests of a falling circulation.
So far I have dealt only with attacks from
■the outside : attacks have been made from
within. The conceited and ignorant—an-
noyed possibly at not being personally selected
to represent labor—have denounced our
apathy and cowardice. They have bragged
that, if sent to- Parliament, they would
have achieved more than have all the Labor
members combined. Having heard several
feeble and disjointed utterances from these
ill-ballasted boasters, I feel confident that
not one of the present Labor members has
shown such a terrible disproportion between
his personal valuation of his qualifications
and that set on them by the House, as would
have fallen to the lot of these critics had
they been returned. It is easy for the irre-
sponsible to make vague charges and strong
assertions out of doors. In Parliament it is
necessary to create opportunities. That
difficulty got over, the denunciator is confined
within narrow limits by the rules of debate
and, finally, if his charges be not substan-
tiated by fact, they will be listened to with
scant attention and doubtless forgotten ere
he has ceased to speak. Nothing would so
speedily let the gas out of these cock-sure
critics as to be pulled up a dozen times
inside ten minutes on “ points of order ” or
by the Speaker, whilst a notice to discontinue
speaking would probably reduce them to
their proper political level in brief space.
As Holyoake puts it, the citizen who thinks
he knows everything from the beginning and
previously, will grow pale in Parliament with
dying purpose on discovering how slowly
the mills of the gods grind—when he turns
the wheels.
We are also charged with “living on the
game.” Possibly certain Labor members
never before earned £5 15s per week—to be
fairly exact as to amount. It is just as true
that no Labor member had ever before so
many calls on his earnings. The expendi-
ture for stamps, telegrams ; expense of all
night sittings ; donations to charitable insti-
tutions. “ society ” picnics, concerts and
socials for the relief of the suffering and the
indigent; subscriptions to football, rowing,
sailing, cricket and other clubs : the daily
calls from widow and orphan ; the hourly
appeals for monetary aid from the man who
“ hasn’t slept in a bed for a week and hasn’t
had a meal for twenty-four hours are apt
to run away with half the total sum. That
is, unless the man thus besieged be as hard
as flint and callous as a bank-director. This
charge of “ living on the game ” was never
heard until Labor members got into Parlia-
ment, and would not have been heard so
often since if they had swallowed the baits
of the “right-thinking persons” who pull
the wires ■of the other parties. Now we are
told that it might have been right to pay the
rich, but is decidedly wrong to pay poor
representatives, and so, after two years’ trial
of a Parliament elected on payment of mem-
bers, it is pronouneed a failure for not achiev-
ing all that forty years of the gratis system has
left undone. The gratis system is responsible
for the lawyer who makes Parliament a
machine to advertise his business and collect
his debts; for the man who has used it to
get the information that has enabled him to
dummy all the best land in the country ; for
the men who used filthy language to each
other across the table of the House, and who
fought on the floor of the Assembly, in the
lobby and in the gutter outside : for the
gentleman who chews tumblers up in private
bars with his teeth ; for the crowd who used
public money to improve their own estates ;
for the legislator who quarters al I his poor
relations and his small creditors on the public
service ; and the “ jobber ” who allows the

Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder—Purest and Best
Government to resume his land and charges
• them 500 per cent, above even its boom value
for resumptions. All these things went on
during many years and no paper objected,
but Oh! what a difference when a number of
men were elected who didn’t seek office, who
never wasted time by moving motions of
censure or trying to engineer political jobs
through the House. They were at once
denounced because they took State pay for
their services, while the other crowd who also
took pay, and in addition paid themselves by
the promotion of monstrous public swindles,
were never mentioned. It is wrong to be
poor, live within your fflCome, and pay your
debts • right to seem rich, live beyond your
means, and pay nobody. Some time ago the
S. M. Herald's London correspondent
declared that one of the problems of Imperial
polities was : “ How is Irish representation
at'Westminister to be maintained ?” said he,
“ The coffers of both sections of the once
united Irish Parliamentary party are empty
and one of the leaders recently admitted that
the only hope of maintaining an independent
Nationalist party was by the legislation of
the principle of payment of members.” There
are many men here who have for years
contributed to the Home Rule party and
would gladly sec its members saved by
payment of representatives from the indig-
nity of begging in order to live in Parlia-
ment, but many of these men are the ffrst
to howl whenever a Labor man show his
head “ What about the six quid a week 1”
No doubt they’d like to make it six shill-
ings a year.
• ♦ •
Here, by the way, I may refer to the
charge of Epps and Co,, that it was through
the dread of a general election on the part of
Labor members (they make no distinction
between the many who voted for dissolutions
and the few who didn’t) that the country
hasn’t been appealed to before now. I have
no hesitation in styling this a deliberate lie,
and want to know why the National Associa-
tion has not denounced Wilkinson of Balran-
ald (one of its members and a pronounced
freetrader) who by his vote and his abstention
from voting assisted to save the Dibbs
Government on the occasion of the Broken
Hill and Parkes’ motions of censure. I
might also enquire why no attack was made
on other freetraders, whose votes absolutely
saved the Dibbs Government from defeat and
dissolution on several occasions? Everyone
knows why they are not thus attacked and
why Labor members are. It is simply be-
cause the political behaviour of the latter
throughout has been so irreproachable that
Charges against them had to be manufactured.
That we split is undeniable, and it would'
be sheer hypocrisy to deny that a similar split
exists outside. (We had evidence of it when
ex-Mayor Manning was xeturned for South
Sydney.) Labor members would be more
than human if they could remain united
when these who returned them are divided.
To-day we are told that sectarianism is dead
in New South Wales, but as a matter of
fact it only masquerades under another
name. As a Labor member said to an
interjoctor not long ago, “I’ve heard your
accent; you needn’t tell me your politics.”
Here I assert that the man who takes his
political opinions from either parson, priest,
or the boss of a sectarian society, is just as
much a slave as if he walked to the hustings
in leg irons at the point of the bayonet.
The body can never be free while the mind
is shackled, and the man who fails to leave
his religious differences at the shrine of his
faith is at once a slave and a slave driver.
He will neither free himself nor permit,
others to be free.
"The workers’ cross is disunion.” True,
and if one arm of the cross be Sectarianism,
the other as truly is Distrust. When the
ordinary toiler is told that someone has
spoken or written on his behalf, he too often
begins to question the motives of the writer
or speaker. This distrust is part of a heritage
for which its heirs are not wholly responsible
from which even the more intelligent
workers are not free. The other day I
heard a prominent unionist say of a man
who was devoting all his time and ability to
the cause of Labor iu return for a sum that
would have been quadrupled had he thrown
his energies into the other scale : “ Oh, I
know his game ; he wants to get into Par-
liament.” It is such suspicions that dis-
hearten many who espouse the cause of
Labor from conviction. The workers have
been often deceived by mere self-seekers, but
that any number of them should distrust
those who have given up all to stand on
their side, and should attempt to sow the
seeds of suspicion among others, furnishes
more reason for despair than all the attacks
that come from the camp of the enemy.
The foe can be faced, the false friend may
hand over the keys of the citadel when its
defenders depend on him to keep watch.
Curiously enough, the workers most thor-
oughly doubt men of their own class. Thus
the workers’ cause is crucified on a cross of
disunion, constructed of the sectarianism and
distrust that arise from ignorance. As J, W,
Sullivan, late of the “Twentieth Century,”
wrote me months ago : “ If the workers had
a tithe of the brains and backbone of the

exploiters, the world mould be reformed in
twenty-four hours.” Whilst ignorance and
suspicion go hand-in-hand, the Labor party
cannot -do too much propaganda work.
Confidence will follow in the wake of
•enlightenment.
The Labor party has been unceasingly ex-
horted to take pattern from that best known
of all third parties—the Home Rule party—
and select a Parnell. It would, doubtless,
have been well had our party been as able
and autocratically led as was the Irish con-
tingent by its distinguished champion. It
must not be forgotten, however, that the
leadership of Parnell—coming long years
after the party was a recognised entity—was
more the result of his undisputed annexation
of the position than of his election by the
rank and file. Having demonstrated his
fitness, the death of Butt settled the matter.
Had any man in our camp displayed a
similar capacity, allied to a like iron-handed
ambition, our leader would long ago have
elected himself. In view of the unsparing,
and oftentimes venomous criticism that we
have unceasingly encountered from both
friends and foes, every likely leader ought to
be thankful that he was not chosen as the
scape-goat to bear the sins of the multitude.
Moreover, the battle is not won even when
the man takes hold of the marshal’s baton’
In every army are malcontents. Self takes
precedence of the cause with many a patriot.
To some Horae Rulers even Parnellocracy
was so irksome that they rent his kingdom in
twain, and discrowned him on the first
pretext. The dethronement may have killed
Parnell ;it did not kill Home Rule. Split
onto factions which, at the last election,
“fought like devils for conciliation, and
hated each other for the love of God,” the
Home Rule party is to-day, notwithstanding,
nearer its Promised Land than at any
moment during the many years of its
existence. Docs not this furnish a proof
that when the justice of a cause is recognised
by the body in power and adopted as their
policy, that an accredited leader is no longer
an absolute necessity for the party of initia-
tion I
The N.S.W. Labor party did not need to
wander wearily through a desert of divisions
and a wilderness of political non recognition
for forty long years, while miraculously
sustained on the Heaven-sent manna of
voluntary contributions, until they arrived
within sight of Canaan. Moses Parkes and
Joshua Dibbs, in turn, have led them on.
Legislative avowal that our claims were just
Hollowed quickly on the heels of our swearing
in. It is not our fault, but our misfortune,
that we have since been fruitlessly besieging
our Jericho—the Legislative Council. Nor
do its walls show any signs of tottering,
although the ram’s-horn of Dibbs is ap-
parently pitched in a similar key to our own.
Most of us shrewdly suspect, however, that
Dibbs would not be quite so democratic were
there no Council in existence, and believe
that his open threat that he would get the
Menindie Irrigation Bill killed in the Upper
House because of the insertion of the lease-,
hold principle was a result of confidence
communicated by prior stranglings therein,
according to his wish, of numerous measures
of Reform. We will never fully achieve our
ends until this, the stronghold of class
selfishness, is overthrown. Nevertheless,
inside two years, we have done more than the
Home Rulers have accomplished in fifty
years. I do not wish to depreciate their
splendid struggle, nor to magnify our feeble
attempts. Our difficulties were fewer, our'
opportunities greater —that is all.
* * *
Here I cease to trace any parallel between
the two parties, in order to show the N.S.W,
wage-earner what a splendid example is set
him by the never-failing trustfulness and
magnificent self-denial of the Irish people.
Already many of those who returned us are
dissatisfied at our apparent want of success,
and disheartened because we have not yet
been able to reform the whole social system.
It was not thus in Ireland. •Ignorant in
some cases, often-tiraes poverty-stricken and
plague-persecuted, these people, undaunted
by long-continued failure, have generation
after generation, not only cast their votes for
Home Rulers but also furnished their cham-
pions with the sinews of war. Their pence
were given as freely as their votes. Needless
to say that their trust in their representatives
was full and free. They were not misled by
the misrepresentations, distortions, and sup-
pressions of an antagonistic press’; they had
faith in the justice of their cause and in the
sincerity of their leaders when all the world
doubted both. Are the wage-earners of New
South Wales cast in an inferior mould ? Have
they less determination, less courage, less
heart ? Shall the negative success of a few
months do more to dishearten them than as
many years of positive failure had power to
do in Ireland ? The next general election
will show.
On the success or failure of the local ex-
periment depend even weightier issues
than the partial autonomy of Ireland. • Out

Our failure would simply sound the knell of
Government by representation, and give the
energies of Labor’s best and noblest to whet
the sword of revolution and light the fuse of
anarchy.
Were the toilers to assert their rights as
freemen and make a united effort on election
day, they would no longer be the governed
but the governing body. When the workers
of New South Wales understand that they
can never gain their political, social, and
industrial salvation by self-crucifixion, the
future is theirs. Barrabas will suffer in-
stead.
There is little doubt that Labor members
coming before their constituents during re-
cess and at the next general election will be
asked, “ What have you done 7” It was
only the other day that one of the bogus
working men who write on the note-paper
supplied by the National Association, defied
with fine scorn anyone to show anything that
had been effected by the Labor party during
their brief existence. With far greater
reason he might have asked the Freetrade
Association to name anything of legislative
value done directly during a similar period.
Their record (prior to Mr. G. 11. Reid taking
office) was even more barren of result. Our
services, like theirs, must be estimated chiefly
by what wc’vc made other people do or re-
frain from doing. To begin with, we have
exercised an educational effect on our Par-
liament which can only be gauged by future
political events. Coming into Parliament
wc got from Parkes a strongly-expressed
belief that it was no part of the duties of
Government to find work for those unable
otherwise to obtain it. Eighteen months
later he tabled resolutions, in which the
Dibbs’ Government was strongly censured for
neglecting the unemployed question. Other
instances might be given. For instance, I
have heard Messrs. Dihbs, Lyne, Copeland,
and Suitor oftentimes declare that they had
no belief in assisted settlement and would
never give away the lands of the country for
such Utopian schemes. As all the world
knows, they have since made room for co-
operative and assisted settlement on the
Statute Boob. I might enumerate other in-
stances, but will now name some measures
introduced by the Labor party, others in
consequence of the Labor party, and a few
others killed through the agency of the
Labor party:—Workman’s Combination Laws
Act Amendment Bill (Laugwell); Em-
ployers Liability Act Amendment Bill
(Kelly); Marine Board Reconstruction Bill
(Davis) ; Apprentices Bill (Houghton) ;
Conciliation and Arbitration Act Amendment
Bill (Cann). These bills were uncere-
moniously dismissed, with one exception, by
the Legislative Council, but have since, with
the exception of the Marine Board Recon-
struction Bill, become law. This result was
only attained by the insistence of the Labor
party. As for bills introduced in consequence
of the party here are a few: —two Concilia-
tion and Arbitration Bills ; three Election
Bills; two Coal Mines Regulation Bills
two Mining on Private Property Bills;
Labor Settlements Bill; Asiatic Races Re-
striction Bill, and a Progressive Income-
Tax Bill. Many of these measures were
thrown out by the Council, some were other-
wise impeded, but all, with one exception,,
have since been legalised by the perseverance
of the Labor members. As for the work of
prevention, the Labor party either killed or
blocked, the Australian Banking Co. of
Sydney’s Bill (giving that corporation the
right of note issue) ; Disorderly Conduct
Suppression Bill (for Hogging children) ; the
Australian Gaslight Co.’s Electric Lighting
Bill; the Colo Valley Water-Bights Bill. I
might mention many others of equal danger
to the public welfare but space forbids.
* * *
Daring the last Session of 1893 the Houap
sat for 117 days—five more than in the pr*
vious Session—and never was counted out*
An entirely new experience for the Parlia-
ment of New South Wales, whose sittings,
under the old regime, often lapsed because
there was not a sufficient attendance. (There
were 39 counts-out in the ’B7-91 Parlia-
ments). The average duration of each sitting
was about nine and a half hours, and, as
figures prove, after 10 o’clock at night the-
House was kept together, almost without ex-
ception, by Labor members. No doubt, if
payment of members were abolished, some of
the Labor members would endeavor to retain
their seats ; that they could also devote as.
regular an attendance to their duties is im-
possible. They would be compelled to adopt
other means of getting a livelihood and,
ceasing to be “ professional politicians —•
the name given by the capitalistic press to
those who devote all their energies to the
country’s work—would become, like the
others, “ commercial politicians.” It is the
constant practice of the commercial politi-
cian to give all his best force and ability

time of the House before going by speaking
lengthily at an hour when he will be “ projv

sufficient advertisement, he retires, convinced
that the country is once more saved. But
he has wasted time and the House has to sit
until the small hours to make up arrears.
Payment of members ensures the regular
attendance of the “ professional ” politician,
but docs not exert a similar beneficial influ-
ence over the “ commercial politician.” The
abolition of payment of members would not
cause the latter to attend more frequently,
and would inevitably compel the former
to attend less frequently. If there be
anything in deductions drawn from un-
deniable facts, the conclusion to be arrived
at is not that payment of members should be
abolished in order to expel those who place
the country’s welfare first, but that payment
should be continued and votes so given in
the future that a greater number of “ profes-
sional” and fewer •* commercial ” members
shall be returned. The man who takes poli-
tics up either as a diversion or as a means
of furthering “private industry,” and who,
while regularly pocketing his pay for doing
nothing, complains because these people who
really do all the work are paid, should be
thrust forth into the outer darkness, where
no one is forced to accept £3OO per annum
against his will. That such men should ob-
ject to take money for doing nothing shows
that they are not utterly callous ; that they
should object to those who do the work re-
ceiving it, is proof positive that they are
utterly conscienceless. If they were sincere
in their denunciations of payment of mem-
bers they would, after drawing their allow-
ances, pay them into the Consolidated
Revenue. It cannot yet be forgotten that
Mr. Bruce Smith, who, on conscientious
grounds, refused to draw his salary, took it
out in a lump not so long ago. So much
for conscience!
In the second session of the first Parlia-
ment pervaded by a Labor party, 436
divisions were taken. One Labor man, G.
D. Clark, scored the highest possible and out
of the 31 highest records eighteen were made
by Labor members ; the other eight being
registered by Ministers of the Crown, highly
paid for attendance and compelled to attend
if they would retain place and power. The
records then established by the Labor party
have ever since been on the whole kept up,
though 1 know from the figures that none of
the parties succeeding it, "have attended so
continuously and fought so hard as did the
first Labor party— the most maligned, the
least understood, the most heavily burdened
of all.
Mr. Bavister ouce pointed out that 60 per
cent, of the constant attenders were Labor
members, while of the low vote 45 per cent,
were lawyers. Excluding from the list of
Labor members all seceders from or those
erroneously accounted of the party, and in-
eluding Messrs. LangweU and Schey, it will
be found that the 31 members referred to
gave 8842 votes, an average of 285 votes per
man. The 109 members remaining—omit-
ting the Speaker in the House and the
Chairman m Committee—gave 18 096 votes,
a fraction over 165$ votes per head. This
shows an average excess per man of 119$
votes given by Labor members over those
given by the other sections of the House.
It is perfectly true, as the Telegraph ex-
plains in an elephantincly humorous man-
ner, that though G. D. Clark has voted nearly
five times as often as Sir Henry Parkes,
he is not by so much the more an intel-
lectual and expert Parliamentarian. But,
inasmuch as the country’s legislation is pre-
ceded by deliberative discussion and vote-
taking. he is by that proportion so much
more faithful in the performance of the
duties he has sworn to carry out. Everyone
who has attended late at Parliament House
knows that the work of the country lias been
done throughout by not more than 15 mem-
bers—including the Ministry—besides the
Labor party.
It was continually argued against the
Labor party that the Dibbs Ministry was
kept in power by its members who, fearing
to go to the country, were anxious to conserve
that £3OO which has proved such a sour
bunch of grapes to many an outside fox.
Now the first motion of censure faced by the
Dibbs administration, on December 11, ’9l,
was the means of splitting the Labor party.
Nearly half the party voted with Dibbs, and
gave him the 71 votes against 68 that
secured him the enjoyment of £2OOO yearly,
a trip to England, a title, and a hat full of
sovereigns. But that was before Dibbs had
cast his alleged opinions as a snake casts its
skin, before he had arrested the men who
were compelling the Government to keep
order at Broken Hill, before he had twisted
the Jaw to assist the bank shareholders,
before he had given full proof of his inability
to administer the law justly, and shown his
loyalty to Imperialism.
The vote on the next motion of censure
was taken on the 30th September, 1892. On
that occasion Mr. Cotton proposed to amend
Mr. Reid’s motion by adding a special

Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder—Purest and Best
censure of Bibbs’ appropriation of £lOOO for
the purposes of a European tour without
Parliamentary sanction, and Mr. Cann
desired to alter the latter amendment by
making special reference to the trouble at
Broken Hill. It being argued that if Mr,
Cotton’s amendment were carried, no straight
vote could be taken over the Broken Hill
matter, a difference of opinion took place ;
the Labor party gave a split vote, and there
was a majority of 30 against Mr. Cotton’s
amendment. Then the vote on Gann’s
amendment was taken, with the result that
37, including all the Labor members, voted
for and 99 against it. This brings us to the
original motion. This time, Dibbs had a
majority of 4, including the votes of 8 labor
members—Messrs. Scott, Fitzgerald, Morgan,
Sheldon, Sharp, Kelly, Johnston, and
Newton ; but of these, Messrs. Morgan,
Sheldon, and Newton had voluntarily
seceded from the party. But it was not the
votes of Labor members or alleged Labor
members that saved Dibbs—it was the votes
of seven Freetraders.
Then came the motion of censure on the
Financial Statement of December, 1892, and
decided on the 22nd of that month. This
time the majority of seven included several
Freetraders, as well as a number of Labor
members. Now we arrive at Parkes’ series
of propositions, dated 3rd February, 1893.
On this occasion the Ministry kept its grip
on the Treasury by three votes, and nine
Labor men voted with them ; whilst several
Freetraders, including Wilkinson, refused to
vote against the Government. The Elections
Bill was before the Council, and the debate
over the “ thrift ’’vote had been diplomati-
cally adjourned until the vote in the Assembly
was taken. The “ thrift ” clause was inserted,
as everybody knows, and only removed later
under pressure of the Income Tax, when
sent back by the Lower Chamber. But it
was impossible to foresee these results, and
so some Labor members voted for Dibbs in
order to save the Elections' Bill, while a
greater number voted against him, arguing
that the insertion of the “thrift ” clause was
a foregone conclusion.
Chapter 11.
PAYMENT OF MEMBERS.
The argument that a paid Parliament is
more tempted to avoid dissolution than un-
paid Parliaments seems untrue if figures are
to be relied on. The last five British Par-
liaments, beginning with the one that
assembled on December 10th, 1868, have had
the following longevity : 20th Parliament—
-5 years 1 month 16 days ; 21st—6 years
and 20 days; 22nd—5 years 6 months 20
days ; 23rd—5 months 14 days ; 24th—
nearly 7 years. These figures speak for
themselves. Unpaid members are just as
little desirous as paid members of un-
necessarily facing the turmoil and expense
of a general election.
Dealing with N.S.W. Parliaments, it may
be pointed out that the Ist Parliament sat
for 19 months ; 2nd—l3 months ; 3rd—ls
months ; 4th—2 years 10 months ; sth—3
years 9 months ; 6th—2 years ; 7th—2
years 7 months; Bth—2 years 8 months;
9th —2years; 10th—2 years ; 11th—2 years
10 months ; 12th—1 year 3 months ; 13th—
-1 year 10 months; 14th—2 years 3
months; 14th (the first Parliament of
N.S.W. elected under payment of members) —
lasted for 2 years and 9 months; and the
15th for 10 months.
Dibbs once stated that, by abolishing
payment of members, the country would
save £40,000 annually, or sufficient to pay
interest on a borrowed million. The House
now contains 125 members, and the joint
salaries of its Ministers, Speaker, and
Chairman of Committees, amount to
about £16,000, while members’ salaries total
about £34,000. Therefore, if it be a good
thing, by the abolishing of private members’
salaries, to pay interest on a borrowed
million, it will be equally beneficial to
abolish payment of ministers in order that
interest may be found for a loan of half-a-
million. “ But the cases are not on all-
fours,” shrieks someone, “ ministers give all
their time to the country’s work ; private
members don’t." But, if the honor of
serving the country ought to be enough for
me, by no process of reasoning can Dibbs
excuse his receipt of £2OOO a year, nor his
acceptance of a fat purse weighted with
several thousand sovereigns for doing what
was either his duty or a piece of rank
jobbery. If the latter, then he no more
served the country with honor than for honor.
It was some time ago stated by Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, on the floor of the Assembly, that
it was entirely owing to the assistance of the
Labor party that he and others were enabled
to reduce the Estimates by £600,000. It has
been asserted by Mr. Houghton and others
that it was owing to the stand made by the
Labor party that Dibbs’ £lOOO was paid into
the Treasury (without interest), by the
“ patriotic gentlemen.” The first assertion is
capable of proof; the second is highly feasible.
Here let me quote ex-Governor Jersey’s
statement to a Pall-Mall Gazette interviewer
that the N.S.W. Labor members had saved
Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder—Seldom Equalled, never Excelled


l>r. Wauolr« Baking Powder—Purest and Beat
the country a million of money or thereabouts
by forcing the Government to retrench. The
Labor party’s existence being due to pay-
ment of members, the suddenly economical
ex-Premier was fitly asked : Is it better that,
by abolishing payment of members, you
should save a sum sufficient to pay interest
on a borrowed million or that you should,
through the existence of a paid Parliament
and Labor party, be involuntarily saved from
the necessity of borrowing the million ? It
must bo better to save the million, especially
as it does not mean a saving of one million
only, but a saving of at least a million per
year. According to Dibbs, you can’t abso-
lutely save the £40,000, it must be expended,
either as salary or interest. Abolishing the
salary to pay interest, it will only meet that
due on the first million; the country will
have to “ abolish ” other expenses to meet
the interest on succeeding millions, borrowed
because the safeguard was removed against
extravagance—allegedly abolished to find
interest on the million that Dibbs was com-
pelled to save in ’93.
Opposing legislation whose ostensible
reason was “ to provide employment,” but
whose real motive was to exploit the national
estate and monopolise privileges which ought
to be retained by the community, the Labor
party was so roundly abused by the Dibbs’
Government and the capitalistic-controlled
press that certain of its members quite lost
faith in one of its basic principles. As I
stated in the House, we might almost as
reasonably have supported proposals to burn
down Sydney on the plea that its rebuilding
would give work, as some of these measures.
As the Bulletin argued, the Government’s
doublefaced ness in securing support on this
specious pretext was evidenced when they
used every discreditable dodge known to
legislators' to block the Menindie Irrigation
Bill after Mr. Langwell’s leasing clause was
inserted. The promoters were satisfied with
the alteration, three of the Ministers,
Copeland, Kidd, and Suttor, had voted for it,
but, nevertheless. Dibbs—once an opponent
of land alienation—and Lyne were deter-
mined not to establish the principle. They
preferred to bolster up declining revenue by
raising £30,000 through the sale of 25,000
acres at 25s—though the Minister of Lands
admitted, with the experience of Mildura
fresh in his memory, that the promoters
might, at no distant period, be enabled to
retail these lands to others at £3O an acre—
rather than retain them as a constant source
of revenue .mder State control. It can
never be deemed right for the Labor party
to do an everlasting wrong for the sake of a
temporary benefit.
LABOR REPRESENTATION.
I have advocated an abbreviation of the
Labor platform in order that there may be
fewer points of disagreement and a clearer
statement of principles without attempt at
the enumeration of details I feel sure that
such a course would widen our following and
have an attractive and cohesive influence. It
is necessary that it should be understood we
are striving for a betterment of the circum-
stances of all wage earners, and that the
head-worker’s condition is just as much an
object of solicitude to us as that of the hand-
worker. Brain and brawn are to-day some-
what at variance. One section of the wage-
paid despises and is distrusted by the other.
White hands and brown do not often meet
in the grip of brotherhood. When they make
common cause then a new era will dawn.
Meantime, the monopolist in his greed con-
tinues to bite off more than he can swallow,
and can only be temporarily rescued from
choking, at State expense and by the trache-
otomy of Bank Issue Bills.
The Labor party has come to stay. All
over the world the principle of direct Labor
representation is established. In New Zea-
land there are 22 Labor members out of 72 ;
in South Australia, 16 out of 54 ; in Queens-
land, 17 out of 72 ; in America, the People’s
party has established a sure foothold, and in
Germany the Socialists largely control poli-
tical feeling. As Wilhelm Weitling, a Ger-
man Communist, said many years ago ;
“ There will be neither equality nor justice
so long as those who toil are poorer than
those who govern.” To this I would add
that those who toil always will be the poorer
until they govern for themselves. The bour-
geoisie dread the coming of that day, but in
the countries where, it has to some extent
arrived nothing but good has resulted. For
instance, a late D.T. cable from New Zealand
tells us that : “ The prosperity of the colony
and the surplus are unparallellcd. That New
Zealand has not been affected by the recent
financial panic is a proof of the prudence
displayed in conducting public and private
finances.” Furthermore, the Ministry are
so satisfied with the success of their efforts
to legislate for human lives and not wholly
for property that they intend to introduce
legislation of a more Radical character. There
is a rift in the cloud and sunshine begins to
break through. As an American writer states,
it was by the efforts of a few much-abused
men that a movement was started there
which only censed with the abolition of racial

the party united under Mr. Cook signed the

to run, and Messrs. G. D. Clark and Darnley
by running for the same seat made the return
of both impossible, or for that matter either
of the two. Of the remainder, Messrs. Bavis-
ter, Black, Cook, Edden, Fegan, Gardiner,
Hollis, Newman, and Nicholson were re-
turned. Only nine of those who were mem-
bers of theL.P. at the time of dissolution failed
to come back, and at least four of those owed
their downfall to their vote over the Broken
Hill trouble. On the other hand, the Soli-
darity party ran 73 candidates, of whom 16
were returned. Including Messrs. Brown,
Schcy, and Wood, who ran as unpledged
Labor men, the Labor party, pledged and
unpledged, numbered 30 in a House of 125
when the numbers went up in 1894, as
against a reputed 35 out of a House of 141
in 1891. The Solidarity members returned in
1894 were Messrs. Cann, Davis, Ferguson,
Griffith. Hughes, Kirkpatrick, Law, Lough-
nane, Macdonald, M'Gowen, Sraailes, Sleath,

These, with 56 Freetraders and 39 Protec-
tionists, constituted the '94 Parliament,

of 1893-4 and other matters having died out,
and the pledge having been considerably
modified by the conference of 1895, Messrs.
Black, Brown, and Edden threw fn their lot
with the pledged Labor party of that year.
Two seats were gained by the return of
Messrs. Daocy and Thomson for Botany and
Newcastle West, and two lost, at Grenfell and
the Tweed, Otherwise the party remained
unaltered. Those who ran unpledged, as at
the ’94 election, were also returned, except
Mr. Gardiner, who, by splitting the Labor-
vote at Ashburnham with Mr. Hutchinson,
lost the scat. In support of my assertion
concerning the '95 pledge, I reproduce it for
the purposes of comparison :
“ 1 hereby pledge myself not to oppose the
selected candidate of this or any other Branch
of the Political Labor League. I also pledge
myself, if returned to Parliament, on all oc-
casions to do my utmost to ensure the carry-
ing out of the principles embodied in the
Labor Platform, and on all questions, and
specially on questions affecting the fate of a
Government, to vote as a majority of the
Labor party may decide at a duly constituted
caucus meeting.”
The Parliament of 1894 is chiefly remark-
able for two things—first, the maimer in
which Mr. Reid adopted the Labor plat-
form ; second, the avidity with which the
Council nullified the work of the people’s
representatives. The bills slaughtered by
the Legislative Thugs in 1894 were simply
resurrections from the graveyard of the
prior Parliament. Here are a few of them—
Coal Mines Regulation Bill; Navigation
Act Amendment Bill ; Parliamentary Elec-
tions Amending Bill (mainly to reduce the
time of residence necessary for “ right” sub-
stitution from three months to one) ;
Trades Disputes Conciliation and Arbitra-
tion Amendment Bill; Mining on Private
Lands Amendment Bill ; and the Land and
Income Tax proposals. The Council having
practically negatived all the work of the
first Parliament headed by Mr. Reid, and
provided him with an excellent election
cry, he went to the country on Direct v.
Indirect Taxation and Reform of the Upper
House. He was returned triumphantly, as
were all his Labor allies, while every one of
his Freetrade rivals and many of his most
potent Protectionist foes had to bite the
dust. Altogether there were returned 61
Freetraders and 15 Protectionists, and so the
Labor party, 19 in number, for the third
time held the balance of power.
A RECAPITULATION.
To recapitulate : The constructive work
inside the walls of Parliament of the first
Labor party was, at its dissolution, chiefly
represented by an Electoral Act. Its main
features were the one-man-onc-votc pro-
vision which abolished plural voting by
making residence the voter’s qualification ;
single electorates ; voting by means of rights
obtainable after twelve months residence in
the colony and three months in any par-
ticular electorate thereof ; and an extension
of the voting hours. All these things were
part of the Labor platform ; going into the
House I never expected to gain them inside
five years, yet, having won them in two, w«

to think that most of our detractors know
little of our aims and still less of our
achievements, or arc dishonest enough to
shut their eyes to all recollections of either.
The work of the second Labor-permeated
Parliament was largely in the direction of
bombarding the Legislative Council with
measures rejected by them during the life
of the ’9l-4 Parliament. These they as
promptly throw back, and the ’95 House
was elected avowedly for the purpose of
cannonading the entrenchments of privilege
with the same legislative missiles. We have
been firing away at them with the old
ammunition ever since our election in July,
’95, with the result that up to the close of
the session ending in. November, 1896, the

following measures had been passed into
law:—Land Tax (falling on unimproved
values at the rate of Id per £ with an
exemption up to £240) ; Income Tax (6d
per £ with an exemption up to £250); Fran-
chise Extension Act (the sole credit for this
act, which extends the suffrage to the police,
has been claimed for Mr. Hogue, but it was
a plank in our first platform, and was con-
tinually forced to the front by the Labor
party whenever electoral matters came be-
fore the House) ; Mining Act Amendment
Act (the chief provision of this act was the
reduction of miners’ rights to 2s 6d for six
months —to be in force, contrary to prior
practice, for six months from date of issue,
svith the right to mine therewith for minerals
other'than gold. It is said that the cost of
miners’ leases has been reduced also from
£l7 10s to £3 7s) ; Mining Laws Amendment
Act; Navigation Act Amendment Act (re-
duction of pilotage rates to a maximum ol
£2O, &c.); Workshops and Factories Act
(a workshop being defined as a place where
four employees are at work and a shop as a
place where goods are sold—registration of
these is made compulsory, periodical inspec-
tion insisted on, also sanitation and ventila-
tion, fencing of dangerous machinery, belts.
&c., hours are fixed for meals ; employment
of children under 13 prevented, and females
and lads under 16 permitted to work only 48
hours weekly); Coal Mines Regulation Act
(this measure makes daily inspection by
managers compulsory ; insists on the ap-
pointment of certificated inspectors, the
cancellation of the certificates of incom-
petent managers, arbitration in disputes,
coroner's inquiry in accidents, notices of
abandonment, fencing of abandoned shafts,
payment by weight, appointment of check-
weigher by men, impulsion to the working-
face of not less than 100 ft. of air per
minnte for each man, boy and horse in mine ;
it prohibits the employment of women
and boys under 14, and public-house pay-
ments, also single-shaft mines, shafts in all
cases to be not less than fifty yards apart, &c.).
I will not pretend that the four measures
last detailed contain all that we demanded
or expected. It is true also that they
were shorn of their best features by the
Upper House. But it is incontrovertible
that they contain many reforms of high im-
portance to the people, and that those who
advised us to refuse them utterly because
they did not go far enough, gave evil advice.
Legislation is largely a matter of compromise;
the motto “Refuse all until you can get
everything" is that of vainglorious fools,
and has no recommendation for sensible
people.
ONE MAN ONE VOTE,
Misled by Mr. Barton, who was in charge
of the Electoral Bill, the Labor party con-
tented to % clause which had the effect
of temporarily disfranchising thousands ol
electors. For instance : A man had forfeited
his right to vote by removing ; having been
in his new residence only 11 weeks and six
days before the Revision Court sat, he could
not acquire a new right until the next court,
met—six months later. Which was to say
that a man—-the voting qualification being
residence in the colony and electoral divisions
being only established for convenience sake
—by removal might suspend his citizenship
for three-fourths of a year, and, by frequent
and ill-selected removals, might never be m
a position to vote at all. This was evidently
monstrous and so the Reid Governmen ,
towards the end of ’96, passed an Act which
made the right to vote continuous; the
riaht to vote for a past residence being good
until a fresh one was acquired by means ot
a month’s new residence. It was also pro-
vided that the fresh right should be legalised
by being placed on the Provisional List,
which is revised every month while the
Revision Court sits only in October. The
Amendment Act of ’96 also provided for the
obtainal of Electoral Rights by post—a great
convenience in the bush.
The Labor party, although not the intro-
cmcers, may also claim the bulk of the credit
for the second reading of the Women s
Franchise and Abolition of Capital Punish-
ment Bills, in the Legislative Assembly. 1
make no claim on their behalf for the initia-
tion of the Public Service Act. Such a
measure was badly needed, and was sure
to prove objectionable to a considerable
section of the community, and Mr. Reid s
courage and fearlessness entitle him to ah
the kudos attaching thereto. Nor will I a»K
for the party anything but the credit of
supporting the last Land Act. Its intro-
duction was solely due to Mr. Carruthers.
It asked : By what other means have the
Labor party served the State 7 I would reply :
By consistently opposing the Sydney Elec-
tric Lighting Bill until carried without a
leasing clause ; By securing the abolition ot
sub-letting on Government contracts ; By
bringing about the substitution of day for
contract labor on Government works—for
instance, at the Government Printing Office,
the Post Office tunnel, and on certain Rail-
way deviations ; By so democratising the
N.S.W. Assembly as to change it from one
of the most Conservative lower chambers in
Australasia to one of the most Radical; By
so persistently advocating the Referendum,

are we losing ground.
Wc are continually told that the Labor
natty is losing voles. Let us see if this is
founded on any basis ot truthfulness. At
the June election of ’9l, out of 428,000
votes. Labor received 103,787 ; Breetiade,
177,769 ; Protection, 135,555, The Labor
party, split by the wirepullers, went to the
poll in ’94 only 19 strong. Out of about
200,000 votes recorded, 51,200 votes returned
16 pledged and 12 unpledged Labor men, or
a total ot 28 to leaven a House of 125, as
compared with the 35 who were included in
the 141 members of *9l. The stupid or dis-
honest daily papers immediately began to
chuckle over the apparent declension in the
Labor vote, and were only silenced when 1
pointed out an even greater declension in the
vote given to the older parties—the Protec-
tionists’ vole having declined to 66.631 (an
apparent loss ot 66.924), and the h reetraders
to 78.613 (an apparent reduction of 99,156).
Therefore, Labor and Protection, according
to figures, had fallen away rather more than
half, while Freetrade had been reduced to
the extent of nearly three-fifths. As 1
pointed out, there was no real loss. The new
Electoral Act had purged the rolls ot 33,(XKJ
plural votes and of 2000 churchyard votes,
while it is estimated that of 41,817 non-
delivered “rights,” three-fourths were not
claimed because, either by death, removal, or
other causes, their accredited owners had no
existence. In addition to these reductions,
by the establishment of single electorates
and the residential qualification, every vote
was given an equal arithmetical value, and
no man might legally vote for more than one
candidate. By these means, nine electorates
were abolished where a man might quadruple
his voting power by voting for four candi-
dates ; ten where he might treble it by voting
for three ; twenty where he might double it
by voting for two. Thus were the howlers
at the Labor party silenced, and the “ loss ”
shown to be a gain.
The '94 Parliament, having shown the
falsity of the statement that paid Parlia-
ments always hang on to pay for the full
lerm of existence, by going to the country in
’95 about 10 months after being called into
existence, the Labor party stood for 45 seats
and won 19 altogether—s without contest.
Out of a total vote of 153.000, Labor polled
19 870, or, with the 5,500 usually polled by
Labor in five constituencies won without
contest, 25,370. The total vote had there-
fore fallen off by one-fourth since 04 (due
chiefly to emigration to West Australia and
the refusal of the Council to amend the
Electoral law prior to the election), but the
Labor vote bad been reduced by one-half.
Naturally, the exodus had been mainly of
miners and other Labor voters, while those
disqualified by removal are usually the
poor who vote the Labor ticket, but I also
attribute this declension to several internal
circumstances, and chiefly to one external
fact. The internal causes I shall deal with
later—the external one is the adoption,
almost in its entirety, of the first Labor
platform by Mr. Reid. The electors at
large see that certain reforms have come
to them through the agency of Mr, Reid,
therefore he is to them the all-sufficing
factor. They forget that the Labor party,
by constant propaganda in and out of Par-
liament, gave these reforms great prominence
and sufficiently popularised them to admit
of Mr. Reid taking them up with some
chance of success. They forget that it was
the advanced policy of the Labor party that
forced hidden Conservatives either to un-
mask or join the Liberal forces; that forced
sham Liberals either to give earnest of their
convictions by votes or make way for men
in earnest, and that thus the Labor party
has democratised Parliament, In Opposition,
the task of the Labor party would have been
infinitely easier. To from a Tory Govern-
ment, year in year out, to gird at its errors
to condemn its Conservatism, and pick holes
in its policy, would have meant a consoli-
dation of the Labor vote, a growing popu-
larity as the other side grew unpopular.
But it has been the misfortune of the N.S.W.
Labor party to achieve too much—by the
aid of friendly governments. It has got
none of the credit for Mr. Reid’s reforms,
but it has shared with him all the odium
of his more unpopular acts. Nor can it
escape from the position. To turn round
and support the incapable, clumsy and Con-
servative would be madness. To attempt to
outbid Mr. Reid just now by declaring for
reforms which he dare not adopt would be
madness. The Labor party must play a
waiting game. It must organise; it must
expouud its policy; it must rebut attacks.
It. achieved its greatest power in a moment
of class antagonism ; when the gulf again
opens the wage earners will once more vote
solidly. Now, Distrust, Sectarianism, Ig
norance, and Bad Generalship, divide them.
To be divided is to be conquered. The

Labor party’s weakness lies in the failure of
its natural adherents to recognise its limita-
tions, to acknowledge its successes.
DISINTEGRATING INTERNAL IN-
FLUENCES.
It is the policy, organisation, and diplo-
macy of a political party that makes it
strong—or otherwise. To throw discretion
aside, to particularise unduly, to aim at the
unattainable, is to court failure and achieve
defeat. At all events, it is in such direc-
tions that the Labor party has most ob-
viously damaged its influence. It has ob-
viously been weakened by apathetically
permitting its conferences to be constituted
by a principle of membership entirely at
variance with its political demands. Plural
voting and the equal representation of
States in a Federal Senate, are not a cir-
cumstance, as far as Conservatism is con-
cerned, to the numerical inequalities of a
Labor conference where the delegates from
ten leagues, with an average membership of
twenty each, can outvote nine delegates who
each represent on an average five or six
hundred votes. Professed democrats are
even now found to uphold this condition of
affairs.
The conferences not being representative,
it follows, of course, that their work also has
been unrepresentative. If, therefore, the
amended platform of the Labor party is
only representative of a small section of the
wage-earners—those the extremists—as a
natural consequence the party must lose
strength thereby. In politics, men arc not
led by a mere word ; they must be in
agreement with that which lies behind the
word.
Furthermore, you can only unite men for
lengthy periods on broad grounds and on
great principles. Petty details and minor
principles always disintegrate. It may be
difficult to get a battle-cry of equal potency
to “ One Man One Vote,” but we might at
least refrain from emblazoning on our ban-
ners mottoes which, not expressing the aims
of the bulk of our supporters, can only be
provocative of wholesale desertion. To be
premature, to be extreme, is simply to fur-
nish our enemies with an effective war-cry.
If our movement is to succeed, it must be
run on democratic methods and dominated
by our best brains. Those who push them-
selves to the front by no force—either of
character or intellect —other than that of
unscrupulousuess, must be relegated to the
background. Otherwise, failure may be
prognosticated.
Chapter 111.
DIVIDING INFLUENCES.
The Labor leagues can only flourish in
times of electoral excitement. Those per-
sons who used their hibernation during the
political cold solstice as an excuse for howl-
ing down the first Labor party were as short-
sighted as they were inexperienced. Leagues
are called into existence for a specific object
—the election of certain men to Parliament.
This opportunity having passed, their reason
for existence disappears until another elec-
tion is imminent. The struggle over, all that
a league can do before temporarily disband-
ing is to confirm in office its chairman,
treasurer, and secretary, and select its dele-
gate for the next conference. The simple
members of the leagues readily recognise
this, and religiously stay away until the
political pot is once more aboil. Nothing
will induce them to attend—debates, smoke
concerts, lectures, readings, and hundreds of
other expedients have been tried unsuccess-
fully. The excitement evoked by an appeal
to the country is the only magnet that will
draw. The league that meets in season and
out of season, as a rule, achieves nothing, is
usually a weariness to itself and a nuisance
to other people. The men who consistently
avoid league meetings in the piping times of
peace are wise, the fellow who exhorts them to
roll up” is foolish. The league once formed,
having a live man for secretary, has all the
needed machinery, ready to be set in motion
when occasion arises. To keep the furnaces
alight when there is no work on hand is to
waste fuel and wear out the cranks to no
purpose. Every league, like every society,
lodge, union, or club, is always run by a few
enthusiasts. These men are always prepared
to disseminate literature, or to arrange pub-
lic meetings when those seem necessary.
Numbers arc only essential when votes are
required, either for the selection of a delegate
to a conference, or of a member to run for
the constituency I don’t wish to be misun-
derstood —I have no desire to curb the zeal of
those leaguers who meet all the year round,
i simply say that it is not essential.
THE CONSTITUTION OF CONFER
ENCES.
The annual P.L.L. conferences so far have
had a disintegrating effect; they will con-
tinue to alienate our clearest brains from
the movement while conducted on methods
distinctly antagonistic to our avowed prin-
ciples. The harm done in '93 by packing

O n
the conference with representatives of
bogus leagues, with proxies, and all the
members of the Central Committee—who
sat there by virtue of their office while
Labor members who had accepted no dele-
gation were excluded —cannot be effaced.
Wiser counsels have since prevailed, but
much yet remains to be done ere the con-
ference system can show a surplus of good
over evil works. The conference requires
reconstitution. How ? Well, I am of
opinion, firstly, that annual meetings are
not always necessary, because conferences
should not meet to discuss abstract questions,
or to add impossible planks to an already
over-timbered platform, but in order to
formulate plans of campaign and to discuss
matters of organisation just prior to elections;
secondly, that, as it is impossible for proxy
delegates to properly represent districts
which are unknown to them, group confer-
ences, attended by delegates from ten or
more electorates, should be held, whereat
suggestions might be made to the Central
conference, or, funds permitting, local dele-
gates appointed, according to numerical
strength, to attend it ; thirdly, that, as it is
absurd to see constituencies which consis-
tently return Labor members continually
out-voted in conference by delegates from
leagues which never returned Labor men to
Parliament and therefore do not feel called
on to frame a policy calculated to keep them
there—therefore, all future delegation shall
be proportionate to membership ; fourthly,
that no league, which cannot show by
receipt-butts that at some time subsequent
to the prior general election, it had a member-
ship of at least 100 holders of rights for the
electorate, shall be entitled to representation;
fifthly, that, election times, leagues being
then at their strongest, shall be the period
chosen, when possible, for the selection of
delegates—such appointments to hold good
until cancelled by a general meeting numeri-
cally equal to the one of selection ; sixthly,
that all Labor members shall be entitled to
sit on a conference by virtue of their position
—if a man is fit for Parliament surely his
assistance must be valuable at gatherings of
less moment ; seventhly, that, unless a
general election is impending, conferences
shall be biennial.
THE DANGERS OF DETAIL.
A crowd of men, no matter how many-
minded, can always be united on broad prin-
ciples ; when any body of men begins to
discuss details and minor points, then dis-
cord arises, petty minds find opportunities
for disturbance, and the seeds of disunion are
invariably sown. 14 Refortners, 3 says William
Mart, “ are best united by a negation. Pre-
senting detailed plans to them, •you excite
controversies and sow divisions ; you repeat
the mistake of the French Socialists, who
scattered their redoubtable forces because
they tried to frame formulated systems.”
When most persecuted, reformers are most
drawn together, but, when they have time
to sit down and discuss details, or have
breathing space to define and discriminate,
then they are apt to split up into factions,
fraternal in nothing but reciprocal dislike.
The fewer the planks in the Labor platform,
the better foothold it will give to the many
who, not being poured when plastic into a
mould and turned out according to pattern
have varied opinions on most subjects. A
whittling of the broad platform of general
belief into the matchwood of defined detail
reduces its standing ground—leaves no room
for the multitude. Toleration is the strongest
bond of union ; definition is the most certain
source of dissension. The Labor party was
originally brought together on a series of
negations. For instance : A denial of the
right of property-holders to.. plurality of
votes ; a denial of the right of land-owners
to keep out of use land for speculative pur-
poses or the mineral wealth they had no de-
sire to raise to the surface of their land ; a
denial of the right of employers to risk
human life by compelling their employees to
work unduly long hours, with dangerous tools,
or under unhealthy conditions. There, we
were on the safe ground of widely-spread
opinion. Since then, we have shown a
tendency to branch off into unknown
labyrinths, to scatter our forces in the
rairky side-avenues of conflicting opinions.
We have been squabbling in the bye-lanes
over minute points of doctrine or procedure,
and non-essentials, when we might have
been marching along the high road to pro-
gress behind the banner of unity. Thus, a
once mighty army is in danger of being
reduced to the dimensions of a corporal’s
guard. So let us call a halt to consider the
order of our going and the easiest method of
attaining our ends.
WHERE AND WHENCE.
It is hardly necessary for me to give a
synopsis of what has been already succinctly
said. Suffice it to say that the Labor party
sprang into being as a protest against the
political inaction of weary years, as a
claimant for reforms long denied the wage-
earners. As I have shown, much of its work
has been accomplished. To my mind, the
party would be more popular had all its
Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder —Seldom Equalled, never Excelled


Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder—Purest and Best
demands been resisted ; for the reforms, won
solely through its existence, have come
■directly from other hands. The dominant
party has been crowned with laurel, the
power behind the throne has been forgotten.
Were we in opposition, fighting the forces of
Conservatism, having accomplished nothing,
having all to do, our popularity would be
great. Our success has been our undoing.
As it was with the platform of the
Chartists, our demands, once described as
“extreme,” will eventually become the
political commonplaces of the day. Ere that
occurs, we shall either have become the
Government or be amalgamated with the
Liberal party that supports it. In either
case, we shall have ceased to be the entity
now known as the Labor party, and the time
for a cyclic change will have arrived, the
moment for the evolution of a new party of
reform. That, probably, will be a Socialist
party, but it is not yet. The womb of time
may even now be quick with such a political
organism, nevertheless, the hour for its
advent is not yet at hand. It is for the
future ; the present is ours.
THE DIFFICULTIES OF LABOR
MEMBERSHIP.
The Labor representative has a more
difficult task, a more conspicuous place than
any member other than a Minister. His
position has more complexities than that of
men elected on distinct party lines, and
many moments arise when his course is so
circumscribed by artful motions and amend-
ments that it is impossible to move in any
direction without in some way apparently
voting against some of the party’s cardinal
principles. The dangers are greater and the
difficulties are more numerous ; therefore, for
successful Labor membership, a correspond-
ing increase of judgment, courage, and
endurance is necessary. For their failures
are never lightly passed over. THeir actions
and speeches are as keenly watched —though
not so lengthily reported—as those of
Ministers. Firstly, by those most interested
—their constituents; secondly, by those who
believe that if the ends of Labor are to be
thwarted, its foremost men, in and out of
Parliament, must be “downed” and who,
with that class purpose in view, by sneer,
suppression, inuendo, distortion, mis-state-
ment, or the deliberate concoction of lies,
lose no chance of prejudicing the public
mind against those they fain would drive out
of politics ; thirdly, by the respectable daily
Press which rarely gives them prominence,
unless in some matter which may be made to
appear discreditable ; fourthly, by the
jealous, who conceive that the men chosen to
represent Labor are less worthy than they.
The impossible has been demanded of the
Labor member. It is not essential that he
should have been either a head or hand
wage-earner ; it is a necessity that he should
be in sympathy with the cause, should know
its adherents’ wants, and have an intelligent
idea how they may be satisfied. But more
than sympathy, more than intelligence, more
than a warm heart and a well-developed
head, is necessary. The Labor member
requires an enthusiasm bordering on fanati-
cism, an energy equal to all demands, an
intellect that rises to all occasions, a
sincerity that seeks self-sacrifice, a courage
akin to heroism, an unassailable honesty, and
a Spartan plainness of life. In short, the
wisdom of Solomon, the determination of
Moses, the patience of Job, and the self-
denial of John. Even then he will not
escape calumny, and, therefore, it would be
well that to all these high qualifications
should be added impassibility. But that is
not necessary before election. Every Labor
member must go through the tanning pro-
cess, and the hide of a hippopotamus will be
his in time.
Possibly the best democrats are those who
have espoused the cause from conviction
against environment. The poor man, who
is not a sincere and careful student of social
conditions, is apt to imagine, should he better
his conditions, that poverty is a personal
fault and that the man is to blame for it and
not his circumstances. The men needful to
us, therefore, are those having logical reasons
for the faith which is in them, and neither to
be cajoled nor intimidated by good or evil
fortune The man who would do great
things for Labor must do nothing for himself,
seek nothing for himself, expect nothing for
himself. The true democrat must hold
aloof from all that is likely to color his
judgment, to detract from the force of his
utterances, or to deter him from action. He
must be prepared to be misunderstood,
maligned, misrepresented, cast down from
the dizzy heights of popular adoration into
an abyss of contumely, clinging closely all
the time to his ideal, never blenching, never
wavering, ever holding it aloft—“ a pillar of
cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night”—
until the multitude have made it theirs.
It is hardly necessary to say that men such
as I have sketched are not now in the Labor
movement, nor, for that matter, in any other.
But they are far more needed by us, for
our central idea is the most momentous
of all, our task the most difficult, the
solving of the problem that has racked the

THE FEDERAL ELECTION.
LABOR’S DEFEAT: ITS LESSONS.
HAS THE LABOR VOTE DECLINED ?
HOW SECTARIANISM CUT DOWN THE VOTE.
THE P.L.L. MUST BE REORGANISED.
The strong gather strength from defeat;
the weak are blind to its teachings. There-
fore, it is time for the leaders of the politi-
cal Labor movement to look back if they
would not be classed with those who never
acknowledge blunders, and are incapable of
improvement. Only the foolish would attri-
bute our lack of success in the Federal
campaign solely to ulterior circumstances.
To my mind the causes of failure were
three—Sectarianism. Bad Generalship, Lack
of Bold Advertisement.
It seems to me that a fair proportion of
the leading twenty candidates owe place to
the publicity given them by the Press. This
publicity was either given la part return for
the cash payment of lengthy manifestoes
and advertisements, and partly because of
their connection with the advertising or
newspaper directorial class. In my own
person I give proof that within a confined
area, by daily contact and nightly reply, a
man may break down and utterly defeat the
combined opposition of the entire Press.
With the whole country for a constituency
the case is different; no political organisation
is complete enough to reply daily daring an
election in every town and hamlet to every
sneer, accusation, and innuendo. Throughout
the late Federal election the power of the
Press to magnify the allegedly mighty and
to cast down the already humble and weak
was practically unlimited. And their work,
performed with nnsoiled and delicate finger-
tips, was well done.
As for the tactics; If we lessened our
chances by running a bunch of ten, we
therein showed our sincerity. Our views in
at least two or three essentials were held by
no other candidates; therefore, supposing
we had run only five men, those who be-
lieved in our policy would have been com-
pelled by givivg five votes for and five
against it, to arrive at no decision, to affect
no result on these points. Unfortunately, the
conscientiousness of the constituency
appealed to was not equal to ours. Voters in
the main utterly disregarded opinions, and
voted for purely religious and personal
reasons. Possibly our end might have been
gained had we run five men and induced
our supporters, as did others, to “ waste ”
the remaining five votes on those who had
no possible chance. This, to my mind, was
one of the greatest blots on the late election,
and in future whole-colony-one-constituency
elections its evil influences must be guarded
against. Most of the criticisms that fol-
lowed our bunching would have been
avoided had we run independently. But
our poverty and the expense of such a con-
test made that impossible. It has been said
that internal jealousy alone—the desire of
every man to nave a “ go ” —was responsible
for the running of the Democratic Ten, Of
that I knew nothing : I made no effort to
be selected, and was quite willing to stand
down. I am certain that Messrs. Gann and
Edden—possibly there were others —could
have been of the number had they so desired.
To my mind, in running a bunch of ten we
evinced an honesty not often shown in
things political, but made our lack of diplo-
macy painfully evident. As to other matters
Dr. Waugh’s Baking Powder—Seldom Equalled, never Excelled


Dr. Waugh’s 'Baking Powder -Purest and Best
generalship : Our crude, bumptious mani-
to, and the vague vaporinga published
,er in its support, undoubtedly did ns
.rm. It was never intended to declare
at if we could not have all our programme
a would take none, but inexperience made
ir manifesto so read. The wisdom of
ich a declaration was on a par with that
£ the candidate who said, at a Conservative
meting : “ If you can’t vote for all the Ten,
on’t vote for any !” Had his advice been
, niversally adopted, we would have polled
i About 3000 votes each. Id would appear
f aat had we run only three men, the Car-
dinal might not have been induced to come
out. Therefore, that less false enthusiasm
would have been manifested, and doubtless
fewer votes recorded. Under such circum-
stances probably 80,000 would have be.-n the
highest poll, and the three, by concentrating
the Labor vote and getting some outside
support, might have polled from 35,000 to
50,000 votes each. Founding an estimate
on the figures of the late contest, such a
result probably would have meant a triple
return.
It is true, as the daily papers have
asserted, that the members for Red fern,
Gipps, Waratah, and Lang were 9th, 11th,
13th, and 22nd on the poll in their respective
eleotorates. From the nature of the confiiot
and because right-holders bad on this occa-
sion a roving commission, the fact furnishes
no indication of their strength therein. For
instance, I polled 508 votes in Gipps and
received 678 in King Division, where ordin-
arily I would not get 300. The non-closing
of offices, shops, and warehouses on polling
day told heavily in many electorates to the
apparent detriment of the sitting members.
But the daily papers are silent as to
other significant facts, namely, that the
members for Sturt, Wilcannia, and Young
easily topped the poll therein. Which
brings me to the fact that unionists, and
particularly miners, were less susceptible
than other workers to the warring cries of
the sects. And so the assertion that unionism
is only a clog on “ labor in politics ” must
be abandoned, with other phases of the
“economic ” boom. Here let me point out
that the Alma-Broken-Hill-Sturt vote went
solidly for the ten thus : Ferguson 2281,
Watson 2252, M‘Gowen 2198, Sleath 2145,
Black 2128, Hughes 2098, Griffith 2050,
Flowers 2023, Holman 2015, Spence 2013.
An average vote of 2120 l-3rd per man ; the
difference between first and last being only
368. As the next on the poll, Mr. G. H. Reid,
only polled 628, there we would have got
the bunch in. *Had the result depended on
Kahibah, five would have been returned. In
Wilcannia, the ten received a vote which
would have returned every man of them.
In Cobar eight would have been returned ;
in Condobolin, five. We also got noble
support in Hillgrove, Wyalong, Woronora,
and Wallsend. In all other labor centres
the vote was disappointing. For this my
first quoted cause of failure was responsible.
It is uncertain whether Cardinal Moran’s
candidature was prompted by a desire to
awaken interest in the election and split
the labor vote, or whether he was misled by
the greasy offerings handed him by Messrs.
Slattery and Copeland and certain members
of the National League. In any case the
result was the same. The splendor of his
isolated dignity as a prince of the Church
and a silent power in the State has been
tarnished by an overwhelming defeat,
indicating that he is far from being regarded
as first in the, land, while the votes of over
100,000 electors have declared that religious
interference from any source in State affairs
is not to be tolerated. The Catholic vote is
about 26 per cent, of the. whole, and,
therefore, out of 150,000 rights used at the
Federal election, from 36 to 40,000 Catholics
went to the ballot box. Bat the Cardinal
did not get a solid Catholic vote. Possibly,
a thousand or two of his co-religionists,
chiefly working-men, resenting his entrance
into politics, voted for the ten most likely to
defeat him. Some Catholics attempted to
plump for him by throwing away their
other votes on nine unlikely men. He
possibly polled 35,000 R. C. votes, and se-
cured the balance from other sources. The
Catholic vote in the main went solidly
to the Cardinal, and Messrs. Barton,
Lyne, O’Connor, Abbott, See, Copeland and
Crick. The other two-tenths were distributed
among Messrs. O’Sullivan, D. O’Connor,
Heydon, Norton and the hopeless chances
previously alluded to. Of course, a number
of Catholics remembered that they were also
democratic, and voted the laboi ticket.
Some dropped one man, and inserted the
Cardinal.
Obviously, the Protestant working-man in
most constituencies was just as easily
overcome by the blandishments of sec-
tarianism as was his Catholic brother. Three
at least of the elected owe their places to the
running of the “ Protestant Ten ” —which
afterwards also became the Orange bunch,
and Mr, Barton, his unpopularity of three
years ago forgotten, topped the poll because
selected both by Catholics and Protestants.
I honestly believe that the Cardinal’s fate
would also have been that of the Primate,
or any other clergyman that might have
run. Many Protestant wage-earners voted

for the Ministers and seven labor men, but
as the seven were not invariably the same,
■we did not much benefit. In my opinion,
the chief lesson of the Federal election is to
be gained by the Churches.
It is asserted that the labor vote has
seriously declined since last election. Now,
in 1895 we contested 45 electorates, and
gained 18 seats. In five constituencies—
Alma, Broken-bill, Kahibah, Sturt, and
Wiloannia —there was no contest; in the
remaining 40 we polled 19,870 votes out of a
total record of 153,126. In the last Conven-
tion election we polled 18,700 votes ont of a
total of nearly 140,000, The proportions
are nearly similar. Of course, from the
totals for 1895 are deducted about 5500 votes
which would have been polled for labor in
five uncontested constituencies, but against
these must be placed the 2500 anti-labor
votes usually polled there, and the anti-labor
vote of about 4000 strong usually polled in
the also uncontested seats of Bowral, Graf-
ton, and Lismore. The figures here favor
us. But I will be reminded that in 1897 we
got a labor vote from the 80 constituencies
which we did not contest in 1895, and
which therefore did not swell our total for
that year, That is true, but then the weak-
ness of the labor vote in these electorates is
shown by the fact that we did not contest
them in 1895, Reading their names, and
remembering the few labor votes cast in
some of them on former occasions, and look-
ing at those just cast for us therein, in
assessing their value to us at 5000 votes, the
amount seems over-estimated. On this
basis of computation, however, we should
have polled more votes in 1897 than in 1895,
So we would, but for the sectarianism,
which, in my opinion, cut down the labor
vote by about one-half.
If we are to gain strength, the Political
Labor Leagues must be re-organised ; their
methods must be altered. So far, every
P.L.L. conference held in Sydney has done
harm. The wire-pullers have controlled
them by the aid of bogus leagues, and leagues
hurriedly organised for the occasion, in
centres where a Labor League is as much
out of place as the proverbial fly in amber.
Those adopting such methods have soothed
conscience with the excuse that the end
justified the means. But the end —the boss-
ing of the political labor movement by
intrigue—has always appeared to me even
worse than the means by which it was
attained. Some of the gentlemen who first
instituted these methods, circumstances being
altered, now most bitterly resent them. In
truth, it is peculiar that men who represent
nothing weightier than a five-shilling
affiliation fee, and who do not control ten
votes, should, out of the depths of their
ignorance, intolerance, and stupidity, be
permitted to dictate a political policy, not
only to those elected by thousands of votes,
but also to many thousands of voters. When
the policy thus dictated is not palatable to
the voters, their votes are lost on the next
opportunity afforded of transferring them
to the promulgators of a more practicable
policy. 1 pointed out these things in 181)4,,
when others were silent, and then showed
that impossibilities were demanded of the
first labor party. The labor parties who
came in with 1894 and 1895 have since dis-
covered, among other things, how impassible
it is to attain “ the splendid moral effect of
voting solidly on all occasions,” and that the
limitations of the first party are also theirs.
But yon can’t provide every extreme enthu-
siast with the tempering influence of a Par-
liamentary education.
Experience is a capital thing for the
person who acquires it, but may be gained
at too much cost to others. Nevertheless, it
is a good thing that the diplomacy hitherto
devoted to private ends will in future be
applied to public purposes. For four years
there has been a dissipation of force in the
field, and a misleading influence in council.
The change is tardy ; mayhap it comes not
too late.
If new tactics are to be adopted, it must
not be forgotten that the opinions of most
of us are many years ahead of our time, and
that, after all, advanced thinkers are very
much in the minority. Most of us, having
become possessed of some idea for the
betterment of things generally, are prone to
imagine that if. will be generally adopted if
we give it sufficient publicity, and place it
on our platform. But ideas permeate the
mass slowly—except in moments of electri-
cal excitement —and reform, moving almost
imperceptibly, is a thing of gradual accre-
tions rather than of sudden increase. And
as it is the mass that we hope to benefit by
reform, we can gain nothing by leaving them
far in the rear. Thus isolated, we alienate
support, and lose touch with them and they
with us. Nor can anything of weight and
moment be accomplished unless the bulk
march in unison and to the same tune.
This does not involve an abandonment of
principles nor a neglect to promulgate them.
It simply means that political strivings for
the unattainable, often rendering moderate
reforms impossible, will be suspended in
order that the moderate, when accomplished,
may be used as stepping-stones to things
otherwise impossible. Wiser councils pre-
vailing, the future need supply no terrors.
