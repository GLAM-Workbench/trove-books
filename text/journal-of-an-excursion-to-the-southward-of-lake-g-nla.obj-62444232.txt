JOURNAL,
22d May, 1823. Set out in company with
Brigade-Major Ovens from Bong Bong (Mr.
Throsby?s farm), taking with us Joseph Wild (a
constable of the district of Argyle, well known as
a bushman on similar excursions to the one we
were about to take), for the purpose of showing
us the way to Lake George; and as he was also
known and much respected by the natives, we
considered he would be an useful attendant beyond
the hitherto explored part of the country. Towards
evening crossed the Wollondilly River, where we
halted for the night?distance twenty miles. Fine
clear weather?wind west. Passed through a
country partly brush and partly forest.
23d. Weather cloudv. Passed Messrs. H. and
?/
C. M?Arthur?s stock-station. Diverged from the
road to visit the Sugarloaf Rocks?a curious mass.


which, although perfectly firm, has the appearance
of heaps of small stones resembling worn gravel.
Crossed the Cookbundoon River twice; and rested
for the night in a barren brush at the foot of the
range of mountains bearing the same name. Di-
stance sixteen miles. Weather squally?hail, snow,
and rain. Wind SW.
24th. Heavy squalls of wind, with occasional snow
during the night. At daylight, fine weather with
sharp frost. Therm, at 10 a. m., on the top of
Cookbundoon Range, 34�. Passed through a bar-
ren country, and encamped at Mulwarry, the com-
mencement of Goulburn Plains, after again cross-
ing the Wollondilly. Distance fifteen miles. Wind
SW. At sunset moderate.
25th. At daylight drizzling rain. Wind west.
At noon in the middle of Goulburn Plains. Passed
over Goulburn Plains, twelve miles in extent; but
they should rather be called downs than plains.
Soil partially good and bad?white flint-stone and
granite in places. Encamped for the night about
four miles to the SW. of the plains. Distance
twenty miles. Wind still westerly, and weather
unsettled.


OF LAKE GEORGE. 371
26th. Cloudy at daylight. Wind west. At
noon drizzling rain. Passed up a valley by a
chain of ponds for about five miles, leaving be-
hind the last and most distant stock-station from
Sydney in this direction, and then through gulleys
and over stony ranges to Lake George, where we
encamped on the banks of a creek for the night.
Killed three emues on a plain near the lake, which
afforded excellent coursing, equal if not surpassing
the same sport with the hare in England; and
which were very acceptable, for having calculated
on them and kangaroos, as the principal part of
our food, and the whole of that of our greyhounds,
we had provided ourselves with but little salt meat;
flour for the purpose of making what are termed
dampers (i. e. a flat cake, being merely a mixture
of flour and water, baked in wood ashes) forming
our chief stock. Distance sixteen miles. Wind
still west, and blowing very hard.
27th. Raining hard at daylight, which con-
tinuing with great perversity at 10 a. m ., and
promising to last throughout the day, induced us
to remain stationary. Sent the cart back, it being-
impossible, from the trackless and mountainous
li B 2


state of the country, for it to proceed further, and
we being provided with three pack-horses to carry
our provisions and the trifling luggage we had
with us. Latitude of this encampment (which is
on the east bank of the lake about eleven miles
north of the south end) by sun?s meridian altitude,
35� 6' 1" south. Both uplands and meadows on
this side of Lake George very rotten, and riding
bad. Killed two emues and three ducks. Saw an
immense quantity of the latter, and black swans,
on a lagoon near the lake. Sunset fine; wind still
westerly.
28th. At daylight rain?detained all day by
the rain. Ceased raining at sunset.
29th. Fine weather at daylight. Longitude of
our encampment, by chronometer (the rate of which
owing to our detention I have been enabled to
ascertain on the spot with its accustomed exercise
in the pocket) and simple altitude, 149� 46' 21"
east from Greenwich, being 0 h 5 m 50 5 ,6 or 1�
27' 39" west from the government-house at Sydney,
which differs somewhat from that assigned to the
same spot by Mr. Oxley; but as his is probably
(from various circumstances) nearer the truth, I


have retained his position of Lake George on my
sketch of this tour. Proceeded on our journey. In
crossing the creek on which we had encamped,
one of our pack-horses was nearly drowned, owing
to the bottom being soft: he became frightened,
and fell on his side: another was afterwards bogged.
Passed through a rotten, boggy country to the SE.
corner of the lake, making about a SSE. course ten
miles. Whole distance about fifteen miles. Wind
west.
30th. At daylight fine weather?calm?sharp
white frost. Passed through an inferior country,
a little to the southward of the lake, and by a
considerable plain?afterwards over stony ranges.
Saw an extensive plain to the southward, and the
Morumbidgee Mountains to the SW. partially
covered with snow. Made about SW. fifteen miles,
but from our zig-zag track in all about twenty miles.
31st. Cloudy with small rain. Passed through
an indifferent country and over stony ranges, and
encamped by the side of the South Fish River (as
called by our attendant Joseph Wild), on the edge
of Lime-stone Plains, having crossed that river
about three miles east of the plains. Killed two


kangaroos on the way with the greyhounds, but
they did not show so good a course as the emues,
neither are they such good eating. At Bp. tn .
cloudy. Made about west ten miles ?in all about
fifteen.
Ist June. Daylight, foggy. Crossed Lime-
stone Plains, and travelled through a fine forest
country to a beautiful small plain, which we named
Isabella?s Plain, after Miss Brisbane. It is situated
about six miles from the others SJW. per compass,
on the right bank of the Morumbidgee. Went up
the bank of that river four miles, searching for a
crossing-place without success, in doing which we
passed through a fine forest country, and encamped
for the night on the right bank. Killed an emu.
Made about SSW. eighteen miles.
2d. At daylight, cloudy with showers of small
rain. Passed through a fine forest country, inter-
sected by stony and lofty ranges; in crossing one
of which we observed, considerably to the westward
of us, a very singular and remarkable rock, of an
oblong form, standing erect and alone on the sum-
mit of another range. Saw several pine-trees, of
about two feel diameter, growing on stony ranges.


Encamped by a small run of water in a fine forest
vale, not being yet able to cross the Morumbidgee.
Killed a kangaroo. Made about south eight miles
?in all eleven. Latitude of this night?s encamp-
ment, by meridian altitude of Arcturus 35� 33' 12",
and by moon?s meridian altitude 35� 33' 13" south.
3d. Fine weather at daylight. Passed through
a forest country, and near several stony ranges, to
a rather extensive plain, which proved to be the
commencement of a very long chain of down
country. Crossed this plain, or rather these downs,
and encamped a little more than a mile beyond,
on the bank of a gulley. Killed an emu. Made
about twelve miles, and SSW. one mile, but
in all about fifteen miles. Latitude by moon?s
meridian altitude 35� 44' 5" south.
4th. Foggy, with a sharp white frost. Passed
through a chain of clear downs to some very ex-
tensive ones, where we met a tribe of natives, who
fled at our approach, never (as we learned after-
wards) having seen Europeans before; however, we
soon by tokens of kindness, offering them biscuits,
&c. together with the assistance of a domesticated
native of our party, induced them to come nearer


and nearer, till by degrees we ultimately became
very good friends; but on no account would they
touch or approach our horses, of which they were
from the first much more frightened than of our-
selves. From these natives we learned that the
clear country before us was called Monaroo, which
they described as very extensive: this country we
named Brisbane Downs after (and subsequently
by permission of) his Excellency the Governor.
The soil was of various sorts, some good and some
indifferent ?the hills for the most part stony. The
country is tolerably well watered. Made about S.
by W. ten miles.
sth. Foggy at daylight. Proceeded along the
Morumbidgee to a convenient resting-place on its
right bank. Killed an emu. Rode to the top of
a hill, and observed a continuation of downs to the
southward clear of timber. Made about SE. by
E. four miles ?in all six. Found lime-stone and
iron-stone where we encamped, the former in great
abundance
* It is in about this meridian, that lime-stone has also been
discovered in latitudes 31 � 15', 32� 20', 32� 30', 32� 48', 33�
12' and 33� 35', ? Editor.


6th. Crossed the Mommbidgee. Rode to the
southward and observed the same sort of down
country to a very considerable extent, say forty
miles to the southward of our encampment, bounded
on the west by the snowy range of mountains, and
on the east by what may probably turn out (when
the country hereafter is more explored and better
known) to be the coast range of mountains. Found
iron-stone in considerable quantities in the neigh-
bourhood of the lime-stone. Caught a considerable
quantity of fish in the river, resembling the rock-
cod of Port Jackson. Found bullrushes growing
on the banks of the river. Day very fine. Lati-
tude of encampment by sun?s meridian altitude
35� 58' 40" south, and longitude by chronometer
149� 7' 10" east from Greenwich, and 0 h 8 m 14 5 ,6,
or 2� S' 39" west from the government-house at
Sydney, which I feel satisfied is not very wide of
the truth, and which will place the northern part
of these downs from Port Jackson, south 39� 15'
west, 164 nautical miles. We now regretted much
that our provision had become so short as to pre-
clude the possibility of our penetrating further
south, to ascertain the real extent of the country


before us, which we were naturally anxious to do,
from its interesting nature connected with the sub-
ject of sheep-grazing, so essential to the staple
produce of the colony. That these downs are
very considerably elevated above the level of the
sea I have no doubt, and can only regret an acci-
dent which prevented Sir Thomas Brisbane?s lend-
ing me a barometer, whereby that point might
have been set at rest.
7th. Hazy morning. Set out (on our return)
intending to pass by Lake Bathurst, and persuaded
one of the natives to accompany us to show us the
way; but he left us in the night, when we had
encamped, which we did about four miles to the
south of where we lay on 3d June. Distance
twenty miles.
Bth. Hazy at daylight. Shot four ducks. Pro-
ceeded still on our old track; but about half-past
10 a. m. we were fortunate enough to fall in with
two natives, who, like the others we had met, were
much frightened; indeed more so than those, for
they fled like deer the instant they saw us, and
being pursued by us on horseback, ran with great
agility to the tops of trees, whence it required no


small degree of persuasion to remove them; but
succeeding at last in getting them down, we com-
pelled one of them to go with us to show us the
way to Lake Bathurst, they being invariably well
acquainted with the best passes in the hills ?the
other returned to his tribe not far off in the bush.
Passed through a fine forest country, and some
scrub, but all well watered, and tolerably good soil.
Met with large rocks of limestone. In one place
the rock formed a natural bridge of one perfect
Saxon arch, under which the water passed. En-
camped for the night on the banks of a run of
water, which we supposed to be the rise of the
South Fish River. Made about eighteen miles
NNE.
9th. At daylight, small rain. Passed through
a little scrub and some fine forest country, but had
innumerable gulleys to encounter near the South
Fish River, on which we eventually encamped
close to the place where we crossed it in our out-
ward journey. The native, whom we pressed
yesterday, contrived to slip away from us, in coming
over one of the steep hills. Wind NW. fresh. Made
fifteen miles.


10th. At daylight, white frost. Passed over a
fine forest country bounded by stony ranges, to the
south end of Lake George. Killed a kangaroo
and two emues. Made about NE. eighteen miles.
11th. At daylight slight frost. Passed through
a rotten forest country to the Mulwarry Creek.
It is worthy of remark that all the country about
Lake George, and between it and Lake Bathurst,
is very rotten, making the riding bad, and unsafe
for pack-horses. Distance eighteen miles.
12th. Cloudy at daylight?sharp white frost.
Reached Goulburn Plains, and encamped on the
same spot as we did going out. At noon, rain. At
sunset, heavy rain and strong wind from the west.
Distance twenty-four miles.
13th. At daylight rain. At Ba.m. it cleared
up, when we proceeded and encamped to the west
of Stony Range. Distance twenty-six miles.
14th. Reached Bong Bong again, a distance of
twenty-five miles. Reckoning our present distance
from Port Jackson at 83 miles, our outward journey
hence at 197, and our homeward hitherto at 164,
our whole excursion will have been 527 miles.
