Report by the Chief Medical Officer of the Government on
Allegations made by a Deputation from the Sydney
Labour Council, respecting the Insanitary Condition
of Ships’ Forecastles, &c.
The Chief Medical Officer of the Government to The Honorable The Premier and
Treasurer.
17 December, 1906.
In accordance with instructions comprised in the statements made by a deputation from the
Sydney Labour Council, which waited upon you on 27th April, and in the reply made by you, which
were referred to me for action on 8th May, I now have the honor to submit the following report and
recommendations:-
2. The specific matters to which the deputation drew attention have been abstracted from the
shorthand report of the proceedings, and are given in detail in Appendix A hereto. In brief, they were as
follows:
(a) Bad sanitary state of forecastles (insufficient cleansing, bad ventilation);
(b) Better accommodation wanted for all sections of crews (inadequate sleeping-room, insufficient
lighting);
(c) Defective privies (position near sleeping-quarters; want of water in port; use by waterside people
in port, as well as by crews);
(d) Carriage of offensive cargoes and animals on deck close to forecastles;
(e) Presence of paint-lockers in forecastles.
These specific complaints are dealt with separately below.
3. The general result of the inquiry is to show that statutory requirements are, on the whole, met;
that the conditions under which crews live are at least equal to average conditions in other parts of the
world. Yet it has also shown that the complaints mentioned above were well-founded—some of them as
regards a majority of ships, others as regards a small minority only. It has shown, further, that the
matters complained of have, in some cases, no origin in construction, but are rather connected with manage-
ment; while others which have to do with construction, or rather with internal fitting, could be remedied by
owners at no great cost. It was learned that in all probability owners would willingly remove these
defects of management or of fitting if they were pointed out, and that they had not resulted either from
studied neglect or from any other kind of active interference. I conclude, then, that the regular
sanitary inspection which the deputation asked is wanted, and that an expert sanitary inspector would in
no long time succeed by persuasion in securing amelioration of the existing conditions in ways which would
not merely contribute to the comfort of crews but also tend to preserve health. lam also of opinion that
the powers conferred under the Public Health Act, Part VII, Nuisances, would suffice in other important
relations, at all events to begin with. Seeing the source from which such an inspector’s powers of entry
and other legal powers would be derived, he should be attached to this Department; and, while his duty
would be primarily the sanitary inspection of ships, he would also be able to supervise the fumigation of
ships for the destruction of rats, which is at present demanded by other States, and which is now
otherwise carried out. The work would occupy the whole time of one man, and could not be undertaken
by the staff at present , my command - 1 recommend, therefore, that one additional sanitary inspector be
added to my stall for this purpose. I would point out that the essential qualification which the appointee
must possess is expert knowledge in the methods of modern sanitation ; but if that necessary qualification
could be found combined with possession of a marine engineer’s certificate, it would be highly advantageous.
4. It seemed probable that the complaints mentioned above might not have included all the
matters which required supervision, and ultimately this turned out to be the case. I thought it necessary
therefore, to direct a general inspection of the coastal and interstate vessels which enter this port. It
proved to be impossible to get hold of the whole number, at least without delaying too long to report
because so many enter at comparatively rare intervals. It is believed, however, that the 124 vessels
which were inspected include all which quite regularly return to Sydney (as well as some others), and at
all events that they furnish a trustworthy estimate of the general conditions under which crews pursue
their avocation.
5. Chief Sanitary Inspector Getting, and Mr. Sanitary Inspector Lloyd of this Department, were
told off by my direction for this duty. They made the inspections in accordance with a plan drawn up
beforehand, of which the results have been tabulated as far as possible in Tables I, IIA, and IIB, which appear
as Appendix B. Chief Sanitary Inspector Getting has also furnished a general report on the ascertained
results, which constitutes Appendix C. I have pleasure in recommending to your notice the highly
efficient way in which these officers have carried out my instructions.
6. The total number of vessels inspected was, as mentioned above, 124, of which 103 were built of
iron or steel, the remaining twenty-one having been small wooden craft. Forty-nine of them were of a 1,000
tons burden or over, fifteen were between 500 and 1,000 tons, and sixty were under 500 tons. Passengers and
cargo were habitually carried by seventy-two, cargo only by thirty-four, coals by seventeen, and there was
one


one tug-boat among them. The extent of voyages was confined within State limits in the cases of seventy-
two vessels, within the limits of the Commonwealth in forty-four, and exceeded the latter in fifteen cases ;
while the duration of voyages was twenty-eight days or over in thirty-two, up to twenty-eight days in
twenty-eight, up to seven days in thirty-four, up to three days in twenty-three, one day in three, and not
stated in four cases. Seventy-two vessels were registered in New South Wales, twenty-five in Victoria,
eleven in South Australia, six in Queensland, and ten in the colony of New Zealand ; they were owned by
thirty-five firms. They were inspected while lying at twenty-four wharves ; and the inspection was
generally carried out within a few hours of arrival in port, when their condition gave a fair idea of their
state at sea. , . , ~
7. The foregoing summary furnishes a general idea of some of the conditions under wJncti tne
investigation was made? No statement of the average condition of all the ships would be useful in relation
to any particular vessel ; yet it is not practicable to make any other detailed statement concerning
particular vessels than has been given in Tables I, lla, and llb, Appendix B. Those tables, though they
record important matters of fact, do not and could not furnish any clear idea of the actual conditions ot
life on board any vessel ; I am obliged, therefore, to give an account of the matters which the inspection
has shown might be made the subject of skilled supervision and regulation with advantage.
Bad Sanitary State of Forecastles.
(Insufficient cleansing ; bad ventilation.)
8. I find on the evidence before me that a general complaint of a bad sanitary state of forecastles
would be an exaggeration, but that such state is bad in some cases; that the complaint of insufficient
cleansing of forecastles is (with exceptions) well-founded ; and that the methods of ventilation are susceptible
of improvement in many cases without great cost.
9. Cleansing. —This was found to be often insufficient. When seamen have separate quarters from
firemen their quarters are cleansed by one of their number who works in ship s time, while on some of the
larger vessels a seaman is told off by the master to do this work regularly; the latter is the best, and a
good arrangement. When firemen, who are divided into three watches, have separate quarters, those who*
come off watch at 8 a.m. devote some time to cleansing the quarters; they are thus working in their own
time, and that is a bad and inefficient arrangement. In port, however, the chief engineer usually tells off
one fireman to this duty who then only, therefore, works in ship’s time. When seamen and firemen occupy
the same quarters the work chiefly falls on the seamen, and is often not satisfactorily done. Stewards and
cooks do not usually have and are distributed among spare officers’ and passengers
berths; but in twenty-five vessels out of the 124 separate quarters were assigned them, and it was found
that under those conditions they usually pay one of their number to attend to this work. In eighteen
such cases each member of this staff contributed from Is. fid. to 2s. a month to the man who agreed to do
the work ; but in seven cases the work was done by this staff in ship’s time. From this statement it
appears (a) that owners would do well to come to some agreement under which a uniform system of
cleansing crews’ quarters which should not trench on the men’s time, might be generally enforced, and (o)
that in the interests of owners, as well as of crews, regular inspection by external authority should be
authorised. . . . ,
10. Ventilation. —Several factors are involved in a judgment whether ventilation is good or bad.
In the case of crews’ quarters the more important are first their position in the ship ; secondly, cubic
space; thirdly, floor-space ; and fourthly, inlets and outlets for the air under the different conditions
indicated by the terms “ fair weather at sea,” “ heavy weather at sea,” and “in port.” The factors
mentioned evidently stand in relation to construction as design and to construction as fitting, while the
conditions imply that under certain circumstances ventilation hardly can be good, though in the same ship
under other conditions it may be all that can be desired. The position of quarters is fixed by the origina
plan ; it may be designed to be forward, and either in a top-gallant forecastle or below deck, oi
to be in the waist, or aft. Wherever they may be situated the amount of cubic and floor space to be
allotted as a minimum to each man—in other words, the number of men who may be quartered in any
cabin—is fixed by the Merchant Shipping Act, and by the same Act it is required that the authorised
number shall be exhibited on the cabin for general information. Now, in the first place, no
indication of the statutory notice of the number of men who might be quartered in any cabin
could be found on seventy-seven of the 124 vessels inspected. Secondly, not one quarters afforded
less than the statutory 72 cubic feet of space per man when the measurement was divided by the number
of men actually carried. It is true that this statutory limit is generally regarded as much too small, and
that in 1894 the Royal Commission on Labour (England) recommended that the minimum should be
increased to 120 feet. But, on comparing the measurements observed with the statutory limit, it was
found that the latter was always exceeded ; in as many as ninety-seven ships out of the 124 the recommended
minimum of 120 feet itself was exceeded ; while in the remaining ships twenty-one quarters gave between
100 and 120 feet, and six only gave as little or less than 100. Then, as regards floor-space, of which the
statutory minimum per capita is 12 square feet, on only three vessels were seamen and firemen, kept.short
of it; on eighty-three vessels the allowance lay between 12 and 24 square feet, and in the remainder it was
over 24 square feet. Stewards’ quarters were less roomy ; of twenty-five special quarters for this staff, no
less than six afforded less than 12 square feet per capita , seventeen afforded between 12 and 24 square feet,
and only two exceeded 24 square feet. Head-room in quarters is another measurement of considerable
importance ; this was found to be less than 6 feet in only five vessels (of small size ; in one of them it was
but 4 feet 6 inches); in the remainder it was sufficient, or even ample, having been between 6 feet and
6 feet 6 inches in thirty-five, from 6 feet 6 inches to 7 feet in thirty-nine, from 7 feet to 8 feet in forty-two,
and over 8 feet in three. These measurements, which on the whole are satisfactory or even good, must be
taken in conjunction with the number of men present in them at one time. This, in the case of seamen, is
half the authorised number ; of firemen, two-thirds ; and of stewards, the whole in all cases while at sea.
But in port all hands maybe present in quarters at the same time at night. On the other hand, it must be
noticed that the occupation at sea is continuous, and that the quarters are never empty, stewards’ excepted.
Speaking generally, then, these fundamental data were found to be satisfactory ; but, in particular cases,
amendment was needed. The next point of most importance in relation to ventilation is the situation of
quarters. This in the case of seamen and firemen was most favourable in eighty-four cases in which they
were


were placed in the bows and immediately under the forecastle head ; but often, especially in the smaller
coasting steamers, the space thus indicated was devoted to passengers, so that in twenty-nine other cases,
although they were placed in the bows, they were situated beneath the main deck. In seven ships these
quarters were ?n the stern, and in four they were in the waist on deck. The mechanical means of
renewing the air in quarters consist of the door of entrance, ports, bell-mouthed cowl ventilators, swan-
neck ventilators, hollow mooring bits, and occasionally sky-lights. The door of entrance is of most value
in the case of top-gallant forecastles ; it can be kept open almost always. W here the quarters are below
the main deck and entered by a scuttle, the latter has to be kept closed in heavy weather, and at the best
is but moderately useful ; dependence is then on the cowls, for in such weather side-lights must also be
closed. The cowl ventilators, therefore, have greatest importance as being most steadily in use, top-
gallant forecastles excepted. These ventilators pierce the upper deck, and can do so only in situations lett
available by other deck fittings ; hence perforce they appear through the ceiling of the quarters they
supply in positions which would not be selected, and often discharge their strong current of air immediately
over berths. This leads, of course, to their being blocked by the men who occupy such berths. But it was
observed that much might be done at small cost by insertion of baffles to direct the incoming stream away
from such berths and it is evidently important that this should be done, for although the occupant is
obliged to protect himself from what would otherwise be a nuisance, and indeed a great danger to him, he
can "do so only at cost of depriving the occupants in general of fresh air they would otherwise get. It was
further found that ventilating sidelights (which can be kept open in almost any weather), and pivoted side-
lights, which deflect the air inwards while under weigh, were not as much used as should be the case.
Lastly, it was found that in port (when ventilation is, of course, unassisted by the ship’s motion,
and is almost always deficient) sidelights were almost always kept closed, but that the A.U.S.N. Company
(only) had adapted open wire-gratings to them which allowed of their being kept open. Under this head,
then, it again appears that much might be done to improve the conditions of life in crews’quarters by
arrangement with owners, and by skilled supervision constantly maintained.
Better Accommodation Wanted for all Sections of Crews.
(Inadequate sleeping-room ; insufficient lighting.)
11. Inadequate Sleeping-room. —This complaint would appear to be well-founded as regards stewards
only, and again only as regards stewards on ships where special quarters are not provided for them. Such
special quarters were provided on twenty-five ships out of the 124 inspected. On the remainder, the
stewards were distributed among officers’ and passengers’ spare berths, and consequently, when the ships
are full, have to sleep where they can, on settees in saloons, for instance, and elsewhere.
12. Insufficient Lighting. —This matter must be spoken of as by day, and as by night. Lighting
by day : This is done almost always by ports or sidelights ; but in some forecastles, and in some other
quarters, the door of entrance stands open, and in the day admits much light. The actual lighting, judged
by the usual method (ability to read newspaper type with ease) was found to be satisfactory in ninety-
five cases, fair in eleven cases, and bad in eighteen cases—total 124. Lighting by night: This was by
electricity in sixty cases, but in port, when dynamos are not always kept going, kerosene was substituted.
Kerosene was exclusively used on sixty-three vessels, and candles alone on one. Lighting at night was
classified as satisfactory in seventy cases, fair in fifty-one cases, and bad in three cases—total, 124.
13. It seems clear enough that there is room for improvement under both these headings of sleeping-
room and lighting in some, and not very numerous, instances; and improvement could be effected in two
ways—use of light-coloured paints would reduce the dinginess of many quarters on the smaller coasters, and
rearrangement of berths, together with substitution of iron for wooden berths, which would be useful in
other relations (see below), would also be useful in this. Here again, then, the supervision and advice of
a skilled inspector would probably suffice in the long run to secure important improvements.
Defective Privies.
(Placed too near quarters ; leant of water ; use by wharf-labourers.)
14. Position. —ln 101 vessels it was found that the privies were situated on deck, and were either
satisfactorily separated from quarters by iron walls, or entirely isolated from forecastles by standing in a
separate deck-house. In seventeen instances they were placed on deck, but were quite insufficiently
separated from quarters by timber partitions, and were thus a nuisance to the crew. In other six cases
the accommodation was insufficient or ill-arranged, but not necessarily a nuisance. A few were defective
in structure, but a large majority were satisfactory in that respect.
15. Cleanliness. —There were serious defects under this head. Actually in as many as sixty-four
cases there were no means of flushing at all, except the occasional discharge of a bucket of water by hand
when circumstances compelled it. On the remaining sixty ships the water service was present; but it
was constantly available in only twenty-eight of them, the water being cut off in port in thirty instances,
while in two others water flowed only when the refrigerating machinery was in use. There seems to be no
reason why all steamers should not have a constant supply while under weigh, nor why the larger steamers
on which subsidiary engines are at work should not have a constant supply in port.
16. Wharf labourers. —Waterside labourers do often have to use the ship’s accommodation, and this
is an aggravation of the circumstances described above, which operate in the cases of all vessels, except a
few of the largest size, as soon as they enter port and begin to discharge. The remedy for this would seem
to be provision of abundant accommodation for labourers within such a distance of the ship’s side as
would not completely withdraw the men resorting to it from supervision of their gangers, &c. Into the
question whether such accommodation was sufficiently provided, some inquiry was made of the Harbour
Trust Commissioners by the Treasury. The Commissioners’ acoount, however, was not fully utilisable, and
eventually I desired the Medical Officer of Health for the Metropolitan District (Dr. W. G. Armstrong,
M. 8., D.P.H.) to cause a return to be made in a certain form as to wharves which had, and those which
had not, sufficient accommodation of the required kind in the necessary situation. This return appears as
Appendix D. It shows, I believe, that, notwithstanding many improvements made by the Commissioners
during


during the past five or six years, sufficient accommodation is not provided in the neighbourhood of all the
more constantly used wharves to avoid necessity for resort to ship’s accommodation by waterside
labourers.
17. Under this head, also, it is plain that a competent inspector constantly employed could perform
very useful and important duties, and in the course of them would gain a much more accurate notion of
the conditions than any person, I think, has at present, except the men themselves.
Carriage op Offensive Cargo and of Animals near Forecastles.
18. The complaint under this head applies chiefly to the smaller coasting steamers. It is well-
founded as far as it goes; but passengers are the more constant sufferers (under weigh) from this cause,
for the stock are carried aft of the forecastle and forward of passengers’ quarters. The animals must be
wedged together to avoid falling, and that makes it difficult to cleanse the pens; the vessels are small, and
much space is not available. If any alteration be practicable and were effected, passengers, I believe,
Avould be at least as glad as the crew.
Presence of Paint-lockers in Forecastles.
19. On eighteen vessels no paints were carried, or else were carried in a box lashed on the boat
deck. On seventy-seven vessels good paint lockers were found, so placed that no nuisance was caused by
them; on nine vessels the lockers were not satisfactory, but could be easily altered ; on twenty vessels the
lockers were not at all separated from the crews’ quarters, and in them removal is urgently required, and
should be insisted upon.
Lavatory and Bathing Accommodation.
20. This matter was not mentioned by the deputation, but is well worth attention. It was found
that, out of the total of 124 vessels inspected, on only six was there bathing accommodation such as might
be described as good, while on six others it might be described as sufficient. On the remaining 112,
however, there were but fifteen in which there was so much as a place provided. This was known*as the*
“ wash-house,” but no water was laid on to it. About ninety-seven vessels had no washing provision at
all. This want is especially felt by the firemen, and is a cause of dirtiness in their quarters which might
be avoided. It is to be understood that on most ships stewards are permitted (;o use passengers’ baths.
Storage-room for Oilskins.
21. This also, though omitted by the deputation, is a point of importance. Oilskins are usually
hung in the restricted space of the quarters, thus occupying air-room, and contributing to the impurity of
the air. This plan should be avoided whenever practicable. On only fifteen out of the 124 vessels
inspected was a place outside quarters provided for oilskins, but such a place could be furnished on a very
much larger number. J
Construction and Situation of Berths.
22. This, again, is an extremely important detail, to which attention should he turned. Ill-
constructed berths act detrimentally on ventilation, lighting, and comfort. It was found that iron berths
were in use in seamen’s and firemen’s quarters on fourteen vessels only; the other 100 had old-fashioned
berths of wood. Both kinds were almost always fixed against the side, and when the construction of the
ship prevented them from being against the side in their whole length, so that a space was properly left
between them and the side, through which the air might circulate, that space was very often so blocked by
occupants as to make a kind of locker, in which their smaller goods were stored. These wooden berths
were also almost always “ over-wooded,” that is, unnecessarily heavy and box-like, so that circulation of
air was as much as possible obstructed by them. Substitution of tubular iron berths should be insisted
upon, and gradually brought about. This would practically allow more air, afford better way for circulation
ot air, reduce obstruction to light, diminish vermin, and lessen accumulation of unobserved dust and dirt,
lurther, it would in many vessels be possible to fix such berths away from the side, in or towards the
centre of the quarters \ and such rearrangement would be very favourable to health.

APPENDIX A


APPENDIX A.
The specific complaints made by various speakers who were members of the deputation from the
Sydney Labour Council which waited on the Premier on 27th April, 1906, as shown by the shorthand
report, were as follows :
Forecastles.
( a) Bad sanitary condition of ships’ forecastles.
(b) Forecastles of interstate ships are not washed out as long as they are in port—four or five days.
(c) The majority of local boats are not washed out in port, and often only accidentally during heavy
weather at sea.
(d) In a number of cases no ventilation can get down forecastles.
(e) When hatches over lower forecastles are closed during heavy weather no air can get down.
A ccommodation.
( f) Better accommodation wanted for seamen, firemen, stewards, and cooks.
(g) No adequate sleeping accommodation.
(A) Men on some of the colliers live more like pigs than human beings; they are housed in pitch-dark fore-
castles.
Firemen.
(i) Firemen have failed in endeavours to get a man told off to clean up.
(k) Firemen should have a place set apart for undressing in ; in some ships this is provided.
Water-closets.
(, l) Water is stopped in port j they are used by wharf labourers, coal-lumpers, &c., as well as crew, and
become offensive.
(rn) In many cases closets are badly placed alongside sleeping accommodation—referring especially to small
interstate and coasting vessels.
(n) Water-closets should be locked in port, and accommodation provided ashore.
Offensive Cargo.
(o) Pigs, cattle, hides, and fruit, carried within a foot or two of forecastles ; offensive smells therefrom.
(p) The stock and cargo nuisance might be abated by clearing a space of 12 or 15 feet aft of forecastles.
Faint Lockers.
(q) Should be removed from inside forecastles.
G moral.
(r) Deputation does not discriminate between local and interstate ship 3.
(s) Desire appointment of sanitary inspectors in the interests of crews and public.
(/!) Owners could appoint boys to clean forecastles and water-closets; they could also bring firemen their
food, and clean eating utensils.

APPENDIX C.
Report from Chief Sanitary Inspector to the Secretary.
Subject.—Systematic Inspection of Vessels.
Department of Public Health, New South Wales,
Sydney, 30th October, 1906.
I herewith submit a summary report and tables on a systematic inspection of steamers carried out by
Sanitary Inspector Lloyd and myself, by direction of the Chief Medical Officer of the Government.
The work has been unavoidably protracted for various reasons, the principal one being the length
of time which must necessarily elapse before the different vessels can be inspected in the port of Sydney,
another one being the very comprehensive details which had to be collected in respect of each craft, and
also the subsequent compilation and tabulation.
In all 124 vessels were inspected ; 54 by myself, and 70 by Mr. Lloyd.
No serious opposition was shown by owners, agents, or ships’ officers to the carrying out of the work,
although most of them considered it quite superfluous, as almost all vessels on the coast had been passed by
the Board of lrade officers in Great Britain. The members of the crew, on the other hand, welcomed the
inspection, and on all sides the hope was expressed that they would now get some amount of the
consideration they thought themselves entitled to.
As far as possible, the inspection was carried out within a few hours after arrival, so that a fair
estimate could be made as to what conditions actually existed whilst the vessels were at sea.
. Table A shows that 103 vessels with steel or iron hulls were inspected, whilst the remaining 21 were
built of timber. The latter were all craft of small tonnage.
The subjoined table will show their distribution as to tonnage :
The vessels are owned by the undermentioned thirty-five firms :
These steamers are registered as follows :

As to the trade the different steamers arc engaged in, they have been divided as shown in subjoined
table:—
Of course, a little variation must be allowed for, as some vessels at times carry passengers in
addition to cargo, and again passenger steamers may be used as colliers when the trade requirements
demand such action.
The extent of their voyage is shown below :
Length of voyage :
Location of Quarters.
Although on a number of the ships inspected the seamen’s and firemen’s quarters are located aft,
the rule is still to provide accommodation for them in the bows of the vessel, and thus we found 113 so
situated; 7 have the quarters in the stern, whilst on 4 they are housed in waist abaft well-deck. On 84
vessels the quarters were found immediately under forecastle head, and these naturally have the benefit
not only of easier means of access but were better lighted and ventilated. Very few vessels possess the
old windlass, with its accompanying hawse-pipe nuisance, and are now supplied with improved mechanical
appliances. But there are still some 29 lower forecastles to be found. On the smaller coasting boats
carrying passengers it is quite common to find the fore-cabin on the main deck immediately below forecastle
head and above crew’s quarters.
Of the 25 “glory-holes ” (stewards’ quarters) inspected, 3 were situated on main deck forward,
10 amidships, and 12 in after part of vessel. On most vessels the cooks and stewards were distributed in a
number of rooms amongst passengers and officers, and they were not taken into consideration when
making the inspection.
It is almost impossible to classify the vessels as to their general sanitary condition, as there are so
many points involved. Some little defect exists on almost every vessel inspected, but these defects are in
themselves not sufficient to classify the ship as insanitary.
Although the iron walls and ceilings on very few vessels are insulated by wooden linings or
granulated cork, very few complaints were made by the crews as to “sweating.” A few leaks by defective
ports and ventilators were found, but these were rectified almost immediately,

Air and Floor Space.
This is, no doubt, one of the most serious complaints which has to be considered in connection with
the proper accommodation of crews.
It must be admitted that the stipulation of 72 cubic feet per man, as demanded by the Merchant
Shipping Act, is not sufficient, especially when one takes into consideration that no allowance is made for
bunks, food-lockers, ic.
As far back as 1894 the Royal Commission on Labour recommended 120 feet per man.
It is quite clear that increased “sanitary ” supervision is necessary whilst a vessel is in the hands
of the builders. Little or no difference is made between vessels intended for trading in cool climates and
those whose ultimate headquarters will be located in tropical or subtropical regions. It would, lam
certain, cost little more to provide accommodation for crews in accordance with “sanitaiy ideas tmn to
follow the old rule-of-thumb methods.
As regards the seamen’s and firemen’s quarters, improvement is noticeable on a great many vessels,
but this is, in many instances, due to a reduction in this class of labour. On the other hand, as the number
of passengers is being yearly increased, a correspondingly larger number of stewards have to be housed.
Here great difficulty is experienced, and it therefore frequently happens that the junior hands at least have
no definite habitat allotted to them, but make use of any spare berths or cabins.
On perusing the individual reports it will be found that on 77 of the 124 vessels inspected, no
indications could be traced over door or on beams of the number of seamen which could be permitted under
the Act. .
After measuring up all quarters and then striking the average according to actual number ot hands
carried, it was found that not one vessel had less than the stipulated 72 cubic feet per man, whereas on six
the air-space was between 72 and 100 cubic feet per man ; on 21 between 100 and 120 cubic feet, whilst
all the rest—97—show over 120 cubic feet per man. A few instances where abnormally high figures are
reached are—“ Palmerston,” 594 cubic feet; “Commodore,” 538 cubic feet; “Illaroo,” 504 cubic feet;
« Helen Nicoll,” 470 cubic feet; “Wallarah,” 376 cubic feet; “ Sphene,” 360 cubic feet; and “Wallsend,
312 cubic feet. .
As to floor-space the figures are not quite so satisfactory. Here the stewards accommodation
shows out in the least favourable light, as of twenty-five “glory-holes” inspected, six have less than the
12 square feet of floor-space ; but as is seen by separate reports this is accounted for by the location of the
quarters in stern of vessel, where the lines are very fine and where no portion of the floor is taken up y
the berths, as these are built on the sloping walls of the ship. Seventeen “ glory-holes had from 12 to
24 square feet per man, and only two over 24 square feet. .
On three vessels only firemen and seamen were short of their allowance, viz., “ Bega (J t .),
“ Eden ” (10 ft.), and “ Oonah” (10-5 ft.), whilst on eighty-three the average lies between 12-24 ft. ; on
remaining the average is over 24 square feet, reaching as much as 64 feet on s.s. “ Kadina, 66 6 ft.
on “Palmerston,” 47 ft. on “Wallsend,” and 42 ft. on “Wallarah.” _ .
Another matter which naturally is of much importance to the welfare of the seafaring classes is the
amount of headroom in their quarters. Only five showed less than 6 feet (“ Narara, ’ 4 ft. 6 in.); thirty-five
6 ft. to 6 ft. 6 in., thirty-nine 6 ft. 6 in. to 7 ft., forty-two 7 ft. to 8 ft., and three even over 8 ft. Ihis
must be considered as most satisfactory.
The low average of air and floor space has no doubt been permitted by the Board of Trade, on the
assumption that the proportion of men actually occupying the quarters at one and the same time is much
smaller than the number certified. This is true at sea; but in port, where the atmospheric conditions are
less favourable on account of polluted roadsteads, swampy foreshores, and the obstruction to light and wind
by wharves and stores, just the opposite is found.
Seamen work generally in two watches whilst at sea, firemen in three, thus half of the. former and
two-thirds of the latter are to be found in their quarters at a time; and with stewards it is still more
accentuated, as they all turn in for the night at sea or in port, except one watchman.
In port, seamen and firemen alike are at work all day.
Lighting of Forecastles.
The lighting of crews’ quarters is a very important matter. Compared with the dingy and pitch-
dark forecastles in olden days, when a scuttle or hatch was the only means of light, very great improvement
has taken place in more recent years. The proportion of bad lighting is very small, as will be. seen irom
the table given below. The mode of illuminating these compartments by means of “ dead lights has
given way almost entirely to side ports, and these have of late years been increased in diameter. The
overhanging bows of former years have almost entirely been quitted, and straight stems, with almost veitical
sides, have taken their place. The rays which formerly were reflected from the water in an upward
direction to the ceiling are now permitted to enter the quarters at a more satisfactory angle. Still, it
would in most cases be possible to improve the lighting by a rearrangement of the bunks, as pointed out
elsewhere. ,
Of the 124 vessels treated in this report, 60 have electric-light installations. Of course, the
dynamos are not always going when the vessel is in port, and in that case kerosene lamps are used.
Kerosene lamps are exclusively used on sixty-three vessels, whilst in one candles are the sole illuminant
The free use of light-coloured paints would do much to cheer up the dinginess of some of the
forecastles as found in the smaller coasting boats.
Construction


Construction of Bunks.
This is an item where considerable improvement could be reasonably expected; but the old wooden
fixtures are by far the more numerous than iron-framed berths. On 110 vessels the bunks of seamen and
firemen were made of wood, whilst the remaining fourteen were provided with the more modern iron
tubular berths. Timber berths are in almost every instance “ over-wooded.”
bunks ° f the tWenty ' five “S loi 7- holes ” reported on, nineteen had iron, and the remaining six timber
Iron berths not only permit of better lighting of quarters, but are much more easily cleansed than
the wooden fixtures, which in many cases are a splendid harbour for vermin. The movable berths have the
further advantage that, should the number of occupants be reduced, they can be easily dismantled and
stowed away in a very small compass, thus giving the crew more elbow-room.
Only in a very few instances were the bunks built close into the ship’s side. The framing in iron
ships which are not lined prevents this. It is, however, a common occurrence to find the space between
ship s sides, framing, and bunk to be boarded over to serve as a receptacle of small articles of clothino- and
toilet necessaries. Ihis practice prevents a fresh current of air sweeping around bunks along ship’s sides a
closed 18 m ° Sfc essentlal ’ es P ecial, y in close > niu ggy weather, and when the side ports have to be kept
In very many instances a great improvement could be effected by locating the berths elsewhere
than alongside of ship s side. This would not only permit free access of light to all parts of the
compartment, but also render the berths less liable to changes of temperature. Of course, this could
hardly be done on small vessels, but on larger craft there would be very little difficulty. This is more
apparent when one peruses the sketches attached to each individual report.
Food Lockers.
In the coasting trade in Great Britain the crew generally provides itself with sufficient food for the
trip. In Australia, however, the owners or captains provide the rations, and these are supplied to the
crew ready-cooked ; bread, butter, and sugar being drawn daily from storeroom. Lockers as understood
in the Home trade are therefore not to be found in Australia. In most instances these lockers are
used for keeping plates, mugs, and cutlery in.
• are usually consumed on deck by seamen and firemen, whilst the stewards have their meals
in the pantry. Very few vessels have tables where the men could have their meals, and even where tables
are provided, very little use is made of these commodities, seafaring men preferring, apparently, to partake
oi their tare seated on deck around the hatch nearest their quarters.
Storage for Oilskins.
c .°. vessels which are in and out of port almost every second or third day, it is not possible
to hang oilskins in any other place but inside seamen’s quarters, where they are under constant super-
vision and safe from theft by unscrupulous visitors and wharf prowlers. If a separate room can be
provided, it must of necessity be in direct communication with the quarters to be of any practical use
at all.
r a * n . fceen vessels °ut of the large number visited are oilskins kept elsewhere but in quarters
In five cases they are hung up in lobbies just outside quarters; in two on upper landing; in two in
wash-house ;in one ship the privy is availed of; on three they are kept under forecastle-head; whilst only
two have what may be termed rooms specially set apart for this purpose. J
ver y raa ny instances sufficient room could be found for the proper storage of these necessary
artic es of seamens equipment. This is more particularly the case on large steamers which were originally
intended tor the carrying of passengers, when more men were to be found on the ship’s articles, and which
have now been converted into purely cargo vessels.
Ventilation.
On board ship ventilation, or the changing of air from impure to pure, can be effected as on shore
by automatic or mechanical appliances. On the ordinary class of vessels the former means are generally
.adopted ; but on some of the newer and larger vessels mechanical means, such as blowers, &c., are added.
Inlets as well as outlets are required, as no apparatus can act in two capacities at one and the same time.
All outlets should be placed as high as possible, and the apparatus cannot be too simple in its construction
as long as it is effective.
The usual form of ventilation to be found on board ship is the bell mouthed cowl ventilator which
can be turned around in any desired direction. For smaller apartments swan-necked pipes are provided
and m cases where the quarters are placed in a sheltered spot, skylights are used to advantage. Hollow
mooring bits, the tops on which can be screwed off and on, are also utilised for ventilating purposes.
The position of all these ventilators is restricted to a considerable extent by necessary deck-fittings
and we therefore found that they often discharged immediately over or near the bunks. In such cases
the occupants block them with pillows, rags, or even wooden plugs.
Summarised from individual reports, the table below shows at a glance the actual condition found
at time of inspection, and also an estimate of the efficiency the existing appliances would show in foul
w ca trier.
Much could bo done by putting in baffle-plates or deflection boards, so as to diffuse the fresh air
coming in, without causing a draught to the occupants of one or two bunks.
Pivoted sidelights are very valuable, as they scoop the air into or direct it out of the quarters at
will when the is in motion. Ventilating sidelights with floats also are very valuable, admitting air
in all weathers. The doors giving access to quarters are a most valuable adjunct for efficient ventilation
as they can be kept open in almost any weather.
In port when lying alongside wharves it is for various reasons impossible to keep ports open, and the
air in crews quarters becomes very stagnant. The free down draught attainable whilst under weigh is
restricted by high wharves and sheds contiguous thereto, but the provision of wire-netted appliances as
used

used by the A.U.S.N. Company would be a great improvement and would release the master, to my mind
at least, from the necessity of complying with the by-laws of harbour authorities to keep ports closed while
alongside any wharf, so as to prevent rats having free access to the vessel.
Mode of Cleansing.
This is a subject which calls for some definite action, as it is at present left too much to the
individual fancy of the ship’s officers. Very few owners or managers lay down rules for the guidance of
their masters in this respect.
For comparison it will be necessary to take each class of ship’s labour separately. Commencing
with stewards, we found that nine of the “glory-holes” inspected were cleaned up by the occupants in
ship’s time, and by each man in his turn, whilst in eighteen instances each occupant paid from Is. 6d. to 2s.
per month to one of their own number, generally the night-watchman, to do all necessary scrubbing and
sweeping. As to cleanliness, twenty-three may be classed as good and two as fair.
On sixty-eight vessels seamen and firemen occupy separate quarters, whilst on fifty-six they have
combined accommodation. The latter number includes nearly all the State coastal boats of small tonnage.
On ships where seamen have separate quarters, cleaning is done by one of their number in ship’s
time, viz., between 6 and 8 every morning. On larger vessels one of the ordinary seamen is specially told
off for this work. This is obviously the best arrangement, and gives most satisfaction. On three vessels
the seamen pay 2s. a month to the watchman to do this work, whereas on six the cleaning is done both in
port and at sea in the men’s own time.
Firemen being divided into three watches carry out the cleansing in a different manner. In port a
man is usually told off by the second engineer for two or three hours daily, whilst at sea men coming off
watch at 8 a.m. devote from one to two hours to putting things straight in their quarters. Much laxity
thus creeps in on the firemen’s side ; but taken on the whole, and making a certain allowance for the dirty
nature of their work, the quarters compared favourably with those of seamen.
In combined forecastles the greater portion of the cleaning falls on the shoulders of the seamen, and
these men usually devote one or two hours daily to this duty, mostly in ship’s time. Irregularity is very
rife, due, no doubt, to the many calls made on the spare time at the disposal of the seamen when entering
or leaving port.
Rules should, in my opinion, be drawn up by the owners to be observed by all their officers, so that
a uniform system of cleansing could be brought into effect.
State of Cleanliness.
Privy Accommodation.
According to the reports on individual ships, we found that 101 vessels had closets which were
located on deck, and were satisfactorily partitioned from crews’ quarters by means of iron walls, or by
being located in deck-houses entirely isolated from the walls of the forecastles. Seventeen were located on
deck, and were divided from crews’ apartments by timber partitions which were not sufficiently tight as to
prevent any offensive odours penetrating. On one steamer the crew were compelled to use the convenience
of steerage passengers. On three, viz., “Narara,” “ Narooma,” and “Trilby” (all small coasting traders),
a shute extended through ship’s side which discharged direct into the sea.
The “ Magdalena ” had a pail closet, and one was found to have lost the convenience overboard in
heavy weather.
On the smaller vessels all conveniences are naturally cramped, but the number found defective, as
far as structure is concerned, is very small.
The cleanliness of closets, however, is a matter which requires very great improvement. Any
deficiency in this respect is, however, due to the absence of efficient methods of flushing the pans. Over
half—sixty-four—had no means of flushing, on thirty the sanitary service was cut oft* in port, whilst on
only twenty-eight was there a constant supply of water available for this purpose. On two the flushing
was restricted to such times as the refrigerator was being used, as the overflow from these appliances was
led to W.C’s.
I cannot see any valid reason why all steamers should not have a constant supply of water whilst
under way, but it would be a rather stringent matter to require constant supply in port, on small vessels at
least, as a separate pump would have to be fitted up. On large vessels where hydraulic and electric
machinery is almost constantly in use there would be no difficulty in obtaining such a boon.
It is the practice in many vessels to take a pipe from the overflow of circulating pump to closets,
and this, at least, should be insisted on in every case.
Although much has been done by the Harbour Trust to provide closets for the use of waterside
workers, I must emphasise the fact that the accommodation so far presented at this date is not nearly
sufficient. There is also the great difficulty of connecting closets contiguous to wharves to the low-level
sewerage scheme. Another matter which is lost sight of by almost all persons complaining is that of losing
control


control of labour. Much time would be wasted to employers by compelling all employees to make use of
shore conveniences. Then, again, there is no wharf where sufficient accommodation exists for shore-hands
and crews combined.
If the lavatory and bathing conveniences mentioned elsewhere were provided, I think that with
few exceptions there would be sufficient closets on the vessels inspected.
Lavatory and Bathing Accommodation.
Good baths with abundant water supply are provided for seamen only on “Warrimo” and
“ Westralia” ; for firemen on “ Cooeyanna,” “ Warrimo,” and “ Westralia ” ; for stewards on “ Waikare,”
“Warrimo,” “ Wimmera,” and “ Wyandra.” On s.s. “ Dunmore ” there is a bath with no water. On
“ Kanowna,” “ Kyarra,” “ Navua,” “ Newcastle,” “ Pilbarra,” and “ Ysabel,” showers are put in for
crews’ convenience.
Thus out of a total of 124 vessels inspected, only six have bathing accommodation which could be
described as good, six have provisions which may pass as sufficient, while the remaining 112 have no
appliances at all. This lack of accommodation is particularly felt by the firemen on account of
peculiarly dirty nature of their work.
There are only very few ships where stewards are not permitted to use the baths provided for
passengers, and thus they are better placed than their seafaring comrades of the deck and stoke-hole
departments. Stewards’ work is necessarily more cleanly than that of seamen or firemen, but, on the other
hand, they come in direct and close contact with passengers, and must, therefore, keep themselves clean
and tidy.
On vessels with a large complement of firemen it would be almost impossible to provide sufficient
bathing accommodation in port when work is performed during the daytime. All hands knock off together,
and there would be a rush for the bathroom. As the men are all anxious to avail themselves of as much
time as possible whilst in port to visit their friends and places of amusements, they resort to washing
themselves wherever they can. In warm and fine weather this is done on deck, but in cold and stormy
weather such shelter as can be obtained is eagerly sought after, and thus the entries in tabulated summary
in column “space used” as privy, stoke-hole, tfec., is easily explained. Moreover, the firemen have an
opportunity of obtaining hot water in the stoke-hold, which is not procurable elsewhere.
It is principally due to insufficient lavatory and bathing accommodation for firemen that their
quarters are not so presentable as those of seamen.
Their clothes are much soiled by grease, soot, ashes, &c.; and as no separate room is provided for
their storage, they are compelled to bring them up to their sleeping quarters. Were a sufficiently large
wash-house provided, a set of pigeon-holes could be arranged wherein the actual working-clothes of each
man could be kept.
It can be easily understood that opposition is raised by the owners to a free use of water (especially
hot) on sailing vessels; but on steamers trading coastwise, where water is cheap and the means of
heating a reasonable quantity for washing purposes easy, no such excuse as economy can be advanced.
Nine vessels are classed as having no lavatory accommodation at all, fifteen have fair wash-houses
without laid-on water, whilst only twenty can be said to be satisfactory in this necessary detail.
It has been advanced by owners that even if proper bathing and washing appliances are provided,
the crew do not make use of same; but this indifference is only the result of apathy into which the older
men have fallen, but which will not be tolerated by the younger men.
Paint-lockers.
With a little consideration for the comfort and well-being of the crew, not much difficulty would be
found to locate the paint-locker in an isolated position, or at least cut off in such manner from the crew’s
quarters as to prevent the fumes and odours from “ open ” paints finding their way into the living and
sleeping apartments. On small vessels a strong box would be sufficient for such a purpose, and this could,
and in many instances is, actually lashed on boat-deck. Some of the vessels are in port so frequently that
they do not carry any paints, but store them on the wharf. Of course, this cannot be done in vessels
whereon much of the painting is done at sea.
Summarising individual reports, it will be found that seventy-seven vessels have good paint-lockers
which are so constructed and placed as to prevent nuisance or inconvenience being caused to the crew.
Nine have lockers which can be classed as fair, and which could be so altered as to satisfy all reasonable
demands. Twenty, on the other hand, have lockers which are not at all isolated from the crews’ quarters,
and where improvement is absolutely necessary. Eighteen vessels have no lockers at all; this number
includes those where no paints are carried, as previously mentioned.
Carrying of Stock.
Of 124 vessels inspected, about seventy usually carry live stock. Of these, five have been regularly
employed in the cattle trade, and therefore utilise the space to the utmost extent possible.
Amongst the other vessels carrying stock are to be found all the steamers trading along the coast of
New South Wales. These steamers are necessarily small, on account of the harbours they have to enter,
and much cramping has to be resorted to. The crew are, however, in most instances, no worse off than
the passengers; in fact, their lot is often better as far as offensive odours are concerned. The crew’s
quarters are located in the bows, and the passengers amidships or aft. Unless the wind is dead aft, and
fairly strong at that, the odours are carried into passengers’ quarters, and away from crew. Passengers
travelling on these vessels often complain, but on analysing these complaints one finds that they emanate
rather from city than from country people. The latter are satisfied to put up with a considerable amount
of personal discomfort, provided they are assured that their stock is carried safely to market.
Much, of course, could be done to ameliorate the crews’ life on vessels carrying stock, by compelling
owners to leave a space of, say, 15 feet from entrance to quarters to nearest hurdle or stall. Of course,
this would curtail the already small carrying capacity of the ships engaged in this particular trade.
In shipping pigs, sheep, and other small animals, they must be herded together closely on account
of labouring of the vessel in a seaway. This renders cleansing operations very difficult. Much is,
however, done in this direction by hosing down decks every morning, in some instances even twice a day.

On the larger vessels, which are fitted with stalls for horses and other large cattle, less trouble
exists. Of course, it is impossible to cleanse such decks as completely as a stable on shore, where the
stock can be moved about freely. , , . , ~ • j
Although the Summary shows a good number of vessels whereon stock is not generally cai r ed,
there is hardly°a steamer which does not at times carry one or more horses. These are necessarily put m
portable boxes, placed abreast of fore-rigging, and attended by men in the employ of their respectne
owners. No nuisance is therefore experienced from stock carried in this manner.
Offensive Cargoes.
Very little cause for complaint exists as far as the carrying of offensive cargo is concerned. Hutes,
bones, bonedust, and other artificial manures are no doubt shipped, but they are put down the no ( s o
vessels (a course rendered necessary, as such material has to be kept quite dry), and tarpaulins are sti etched
over the hatches, which almost entirely prevent the escape of offensive odours. <{ , „
Peculiar ideas of offensive cargoes were met with during the On the b.s. Ou
one man complained of the smell emanating from the cargo of raw sugar from Queensland to Mdbou e,
whilst on the “ Navua ” the stewards raised objections to the odour from ripening bananas.
As almost all vessels on the coast are now constructed of iron, and the crew s quarters entirely
isolated by iron bulkheads, little room for complaint exists, although it is almost impossible to rem ei
decks, bulkheads, &c., perfectly air-tight, on account of the constant straining of the vessel m a sea way.

Q- Department of Public Health, 15 November, 1906.
I have the honor to attach for the information of the Chief Medical Officer a detailed report
on an inspection by Sanitary Inspector Cresswick of the privy accommodation on the wharfs. J o
privies enumerated are classified in relation to their accessibility to waterside workers. Accordm to s
report the number of privies available to the public on the various wharfs is 109. lhat figure is thirty-fn e
less than the total as set forth in the Harbour Trust list. The difference is c ue nearly entirely to the privies
attached to the ferry jetties being included in the Harbour Trust list as public conveniences, whereas they
are only accessible to passengers by the Sydney Ferries Company’s steamers There are a few other slight
discrepancies between the two lists. Privies shown in Mr. Cresswick s list and not mentioned in tie
Harbour Trust list are starred. 1 have ’ &c -’
