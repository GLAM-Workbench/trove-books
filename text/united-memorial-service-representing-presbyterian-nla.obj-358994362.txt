HYMN —Our
rNUR God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home:
God, our help.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the
Before the rising sun.
night
Under the shadow of Thy throne,
Thy Saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream.
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last.
And our eternal home.
Amen.

President Baptist Association of Queensland
HYMN —Nearer My God to Thee
BARER, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
Even though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song would be,
“Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!”
Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams Fd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!


There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven,
All that Thou send’st to me
In mercy given
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise, —
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
“Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!”
— Amen.

ANTHEM—“Hark, Hark My Soul ”
HYMN. —will he done ”
MY God, my Father, while I stray,
Far from my home, on life’s rough way,
O teach me from my heart to say,
“Thy Will be done.”
Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its guest
My God, to Thee I leave the rest;
“Thy Will be done.”
If Thou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prize, it ne’er was mine;
I only yield Thee what was Thine;
“Thy Will be done.”
Renew my will from day to day,
Blend it with Thine, and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
“Thy Will be done.”
Then, when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I’ll sing upon a happier shore,
“Thy will be done.’ —Amen


ADDRESS
Rev. PERCIVAL WATSON, B.A.
Wharf Street Congregational Church
HYMN. —Abide with Me.
A BIDE with me! fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, 0 abide with me!
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see:
0 Thou who changest not, abide with me!
Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word;
But, as Thou dwell’st with Thy disciples, Lord,
Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me.
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death’s sting? where grave thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes,
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
In life and death, 0 Lord abide with me!
Amen.
