PREFACE.
Probably, the first complete Biblical Historical Compilation, in
a condensed form, that has yet appeared. Nothing traditionary
is admitted where reliable record is available. Commencing
with the pre-historic period down to the late revision, it comprises
all that is, or, in all probability, ever will be known concerning
the external testimony of the Sacred Volume.
History one-sided, however truthful, is not honest, and tends
to an issue misleading. Facing facts however unpopular, estab-
lishes a sound basis no criticism can set aside.
The materials selected are extracted from the works of the
most learned Christian or Jewish scholars of this or any preced-
ing age. And the authority cannot be questioned, for the reason
that there is none other to draw from. The matter is not
intended to be critical, and may be perused with interest by the
most enthusiastic Christian or orthodox Jew, as well as contain-
ing very many interesting facts not generally known.
To the Bible student it must prove unusually interesting,
being authentic, historic, comprehensive and concise.
The authorities drawn upon in the compilation of this history
are principally the following—amongst whom are numbered the
brightest scholars, the most learned and devoted theologians the
world has yet produced—viz., Drs. Lightfoot, Davidson, Irons,
Reuss, Gaunsen, Westcott, Powell, Rule, Giles, Blunt, Colenso,
Smith, Kitto, Kennicott, Ellicott, Alford, Millman, Sayce,
Mahaffy, Maunders, Brittens, Conder, Layard and Smith —
Rawlinson and Wilkinson, Ragozin, Brugsch-Bei and others;
Egyptian and Babylonian explorers and Oriental and British
Museum Antiquarian scholars.


In the compilation of this work, the author hopes that his first
attempt shall receive impartial consideration. The endeavour is
an honest one to elicit all the evidence we possess, touching a
subject of immense importance. The Book placed in our hands
in the cradle, which we carry to the grave, we know less about
than any other ; nor are we aware that there is any occasion fqr
such acquaintance.
Heretofore, too much has been accepted on trust, vouched for
by individuals, however learned, yet subsidised by powerful
agencies, emanating from civil as well as ecclesiastic policy.
But the facts embodied in this publication are such that the
power, logic and eloquence of united churchmen cannot shake
or subvert; this has been a first charge on the research of the
Editor.

TO THE LATE
Revision, Oxford & Cambridge.
PART 2nd.
CHE little that is known concerning Biblical or Jewish His-
tory became inseparable up to the Christian era. Soon
after the death of Solomon, the Hebrew State was separated
into two hostile kingdoms, which produced reciprocal exhaustion,
and, by reason of being situated betwixt the Syrians and
Assyrians on their northern frontier and the Egyptians on their
southern, are compared to the Nether and Upper Millstone.
The strip of territory known as Western Palestine measures
about 40 miles by 120, and has ever been used as the high-way
betwixt the Eastern and Western nations of the old world.
For five centuries during the short existence of the Hebrew
monarchy until their final destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, their
national existence was a continuance of international strife,
aggressive and defensive, rarely combining to resist foreign
invasion. These contests and this disunion disfigure the history
of the Hebrew kingdoms.
From 1044 b.c. to 1187 a.d., Jerusalem was invested by
regular seige on twenty-two separate occasions (six times levelled
to the ground), besides numerous other occasions by assault.
For 200 years b.c. the Jewish nation, in their struggles with
foreigners, as well as by internal revolt and factionist conflict,
were in continual convulsion. Jerusalem and its neighbourhood
became the centre of an infuriated, maddened community.
Obstinacy, cruelty, revenge, an insatiate thirst for slaughter
sapped constitutional and social existence—the very earth reeked
with the life-blood of the disputants. Such a terrible record no
country, people, or place has ever presented, and the history of
the subsequent and preceding millennium record such reckless
sacrifice of life that seems shocking to contemplate —a red blot
on the pages of the world’s history.
After the first Captivity under Shahnanezer, 721, a mixed
and entirely new race sprang up in Samaria. Thousands of
Assyrians and their captives were imported to replace the
thousands of deported Hebrews.


One hundred and forty years after the Captivity of the Ten
Tribes, Judea was laid desolate under Nebuchadnezzar (called by
Jeremiah “ the hammer of the whole earth ”). Those who
remained and had escaped the sword and capture were the poorer
classes, and had intermixed with the invaders.
Sixty years later on, 588 b.c., Babylon surrendered to Cyrus,
the Persian conqueror, who gave permission to return to those
who so chose.
Very few of the original stock who were carried away could
have survived to accept the oiler. The Hebrew type their
character, language, customs, and religion, from this time for-
ward, must necessarily, by reason oi this forced infusion, become
Hebrew-Assyrian. Now, also, commenced the era of a new
Jewish state as well as history. Thence forward, to the
Maccabean period, the same red-stained page of successive strife
and cruelty is ever presented, and which became incessant,
caused by internal revolt and their struggles with their Syrian
neighbours.
The Roman army under Pompey, 68 b.c., put an end to the
Maccabean rule, establishing Hyrcanus on the throne ; to be
recaptured by the Syrians, aided by the Parthians, JO b.c., its
province being governed by Antigonas. But, three years latei
on, the Romans established Herod as a dependent monarch, who
ruled with an iron will and hand with effective results, which
marked the morning of the Christian era. The influence
exercised by the administration of the Jewish Government by
Rome through vassal princes, followed by the establishment of a
procuratorship on the death of Herod, which system lasted until
the collapse of the Jewish State, conferred many inestimable
advantages on the Jews, by dissolving factions and extending
commercial enterprise.
After the victories of Alexander over Persia, 881 b.c., to the
settlement of the Ptolemies, Palestine changed masters four or
five times in twenty years. Alexander took Syria, when he
built Alexandria (called the brain of the world), to which place
he brought many Jews. He died in Babylon, 828 b.c. His
empire was broken up and divided amongst his four generals.
Syria being allotted to Egypt, under Ptolemy-Logas, who, in
820 b.c., transplanted many thousands of Jews, said to number
forty, to the new colony, where he built a temple and restored
the ritual. They were called Hellenists. In 312 he added
Palestine to his territory, which he and his descendants governed
for 100 years. Here the Jews settled, learned and spoke the
Greek language, which was that spoken at and
which, eventually, became transferred into a new dialect—Greek
in body; Hebrew in spirit—known afterwards as Hellenistic.
Ptolemy and his descendants were great patrons of learning,


and we have the authority of Philo and Josephus that the Greek
translation and compilation of the Bible was wholly or in part
made in his reign, and by command of his son Philadelphus.
There are some critical questions arising concerning the dialect,
grammatical and peculiar idiom found in that translation. Many
learned writers contending that the original was not in Hebrew.
With this rough sketch of Jewish history, we now come to the
first link of the “ History of the Old Testament,” viz., “The
Alexandrian Translation.”
There are several accounts of the Seventy Translation,
276-278 b.c.
Some suppose it was so called, having been approved by the
Jewish Sanhedrim, composed of 72 members. A second, on
account of the 72 individuals having been employed making it.
A third, that it was the work of 5 Elders.
There exists no one version of the affair accredited. Its
history is veiled in obscurity—few historical notices of its origin
are extant, and even such as have come down to us are suspected
as spurious.
In the absence of reliable data, writers have had recourse
to various hypothesis; in many points contradictory to each
other, and all of them resting on slender and unsatisfactory
grounds.
To enumerate all those accounts would result with little
benefit.
The first writer who alludes to the Septuagint is Aristobulus,
the Jew, about 200 b.c., mentioned by Clement and Eusebius,
who asserts that before the time of Ptolemy-Philadelphus and
Demetrius Phalerus, there existed a Greek translation of the
Pentateuch, and formed the ground-work of the Ptolemy’s
translation. Demetrius took an active part in the work, but
died before its completion.
This account must be accepted or we cannot accept any.
The next historical testimony respecting the Septuagint is
the prologue of Jesus, the son of Sirach; particularly interesting
because it contains the judgment of a Palestine Jew respecting
the ancient version. From this we may infer that “the Law and
the Prophets ” and the rest of the Books were at this period,
180 b.c., translated into Greek. This writer comments on the
variations he noticed in the handling of Scripture between the
Egyptian and Palestine Jews.
The next account comes from Aristeas, an author who pre-
tends to be a Gentile and an officer in the body-guard of the
King of Egypt. He writes to his brother, relating that Ptolemy
Philadelphus, when founding a library at great expense, applied,
through his librarian, to the Jewish High Priest for a copy of
the book containing the laws of the Jewish nation, in order to


complete the collection of the laws of all countries. The request
was accompanied with valuable presents.
In compliance with, and by the advice of the Sanhedrim, a
copy was sent, 277 b.c., written in golden letters on skins artfully
joined, together with 72 interpreters chosen out of the twelve
tribes. The king assigned them an abode in the Palace of the
Isle of Pharos, where, after consultation, they finished the
translation in 72 days. They were subjected to public approval,
and deposited in the Royal Library. The elders were sent back
loaded with presents, and the chiefs of the Synagogues permitted
to make copies, and this version soon afterwards became common
amongst all Greek-speaking countries. Josephus quotes this
story, but Philo, who was a contemporary, dissents in many
particulars. Philo states that the interpreters came from
Jerusalem, but were shut up from communication with each
other ; that the result was so many distinct versions, which, on
comparison, were found to agree in every word ; which remark-
able circumstance Philo attributes to direction from the Holy
Spirit. And that a yearly festival was afterwards kept up at
Pharos in memory of this miraculous event.
These accounts were all accredited by the Early Fathers and
others down to the latter half of the 17th century.
Dr. Davidson says : “ Although these statements are very
justly regarded as fabulous and repugnant to historical truth,
yet some truth may, probably, lie at the foundation, though
subsequently encrusted with so many absurd traditions.”
It is most likely that the Jews, who formed a numerous
colony at Alexandria, would endeavour to procure a copy of their
sacred writings and have it reduced to their newly-acquired
dialect.
There are good reasons for supposing that this translation
was effected by Alexandrian—not Palestine—Jews familiar with
the phraseology of Egypt.
The great majority of modern scholars are agreed that the
Pentateuch is the best translated, that the other books were
subsequently translated at different times and different occasions.
The Greek is Hellenistic with a Hebrew colouring, and the
various readings are marked in the respective books. There is
no doubt both Ptolemies took great interest in enlarging their
libraries ; and at their instance the Jewish books were collected
and transcribed, Palestine being then a dependency.
Some of the earliest Christian writers, as well as Josephus and
the Talmudists, say the Seventy translated the Pentateuch only.
Modern Commentators are agreed that a period of nearly 200
years must have elapsed before the last translations were com-
pleted and added to the Scriptures. The same authorities also
assert that the translators had to decide which of the sacred


books appertained to the law, and which were to be considered
as inspired and prophetic. They rejected a large portion as
unscriptural.
The Apochryphal books were all received by the Alexandrian
Jews as equally cannonical with the other Scriptures, as they
are still by the Roman Church and most of the Greek Church,
as they were not long since by the Reformed Church of England
(see quotations from the Book of Homilies, from Book of Wis-
dom and Apochryphal Ezra in the 2nd Book of Esdras).
Jewish authority also supports their authenticity—The books
of the Hebrew Old Testament are not arrayed in the same order
of time. The Talmudic differs from the Masoretic.
The Septuagint was the work of different persons at different
times, and their arrangement was finally disturbed by the
Reformers who re-classed them.
The early Christian Fathers consulted the Seventy version,
not being Hebrew scholars, but Christ quotes from more than two
versions and makes use of others not found in either two versions.
The Old Testament Books rest solely on the tradition of the Jews.
Origen and Jerome knew Hebrew indifferently and were
dependant on the Jewish Rabbins for their lists of Books.
Some of the Books of the Old Testament were not written till
the Maccabean period 165 b.c., Daniel, about twelve of the Psalms,
and some of the Apochryphal books. They were separated into
three classes. Portions of the latter class never being satisfac-
torily received by either Jews or Christians. Even in the 4th
century the Jewish Rabbins had not settled their Canon, and
from time to time the text was always undergoing alterations
and modifications, even as early as Jeremiah’s time, who accuses
the Scribes of falsifying the law by their lying pens, which pro-
cess the Jews themselves continued until a very late period.
The Jews divided and recognised their Holy Scriptures into
twenty-two books, the number of letters in their alphabet.
The English Bible contains thirty-two books, being the order
followed by the Greek translators. Fourteen books of the Seventy
version accepted by the early Christians and Council of Trent,
are rejected by modern Protestants.
The Palestine Jews differed with the Alexandrian Jews as to
the Hebrew Canon, urging that some of the Septuagint Books
were recent and lacked prophetic sanction. The latter were
fluctuating and constantly enlarging, believing the spirit of
prophecy still existed, whilst the former tenaciously clung to old
associations and considered prophecy extinct.
The Alexandrian Jews grew with their Greek ideas.
The Palestine Jews contracted their religion within the
narrow limit of their traditions, which helped to quench its
spirit and reduce it to a skeleton.


Strictly speaking, it is not known from what originals the
Seventy translation was taken.
It is particularly noticed by commentators that the Seventy
used the greatest care in their translation of the Pentateuch, the
text differs materially from our Hebrew versions, and in only a
very few cases gives the original reading.
Previous to the Christian era then, there existed three
distinct versions of the Hebrew Scriptures—the Palestine, the
Alexandrine, and the Samaritan versions.
It is a little more than 200 years that the Samaritan Pentateuch
first became known in Europe, and there is not the slightest
information to be found in any ancient authority concerning the
character in which it is written, whilst the language approaches
the Hebrew Bible. The book came to be identified as a genuine
remnant of antiquity. The letters resemble the letters on some
Jewish coins.
It is not known, nor can it be proven, what particular dialect
of Hebrew was spoken at Jerusalem in the Ist century. Certain
it is that it was Hebrew, but probably with a Chaldean mixture,
and more marked in Gallilee, from the early and large admixture
of Assyrian invaders and their war-captives, settled there to
replace those carried into captivity.
The Samaritan Pentateuch rejected all the other books of the
Jews, yet received the Pentateuch with many and important
variations from the Hebrew copies. There is no evidence that
the Samaritan existed before the Septuagint, 285 b.c. There is
a difference of about 1000 years in the date of the Deluge, betwixt
the Hebrew and the two mentioned versions.
This difference seems not the result of error, for the ages of
the Patriarchs are shortened by 1000 years to account for. It
is supposed the Septualgint translators wished to harmonize with
Egyptian chronology.
The Samaritan is evidently the ancient Hebrew.
Dr. Kitto says the Samaritan character is the same as existed
at the date of the exile. There is no evidence of the existence
of the Samaritan version before the captivity. None of the copies
of the Samaritan Pentateuch are older than the 10th century.
The characters are square, whilst the modern Hebrew are rounded.
The Samaritan Pentateuch and character must have been received
at a very late date. The coins of the Maccabees are Samaritan.
Certainly no proof has ever been shewn that their Pentateuch
existed before, and certain it is, both versions have been wilfully
corrupted and interpolated, and the same applies to the Seventy
version ; the hatred of the two countries impelled them to alter
the text.
Dr. W. Smith says the bulk of testimony favours the opinion
that the Seventy translated from the Samaritan, or that both


must have been derived from a different rescension to the Jewish
copy, and that since then both have been considerably altered and
interpolated. In more than a thousand places where the
Samaritan disagrees with the Hebrew it agrees with the Sep-
tuagint, and as many where the Septuagint agrees with the
Hebrew and differing from the Samaritan. No trace of either
versions show an earlier date and the Samaritan does not claim it.
The Talmud mentions the Samaritan as a clumsily forged
document.
To within the past 250 years, no copy has ever reached Europe,
nor was the cunieform characters known till the 17th century.
There exists now sixteen MSS., but none of a higher date than
the 10th century.
A fragment of a Pentateuch synagogue roll in the St. Peters-
burgh library recently discovered, unpointed, from Lev. xxi. to
Numb. i.-l. traced to 580 a.d. If so it is the oldest Hebrew
MS. in existence. This MS. has caused much discussion amongst
Hebrew scholars.
For 200 years after the introduction of the above MSS., the
most fierce controversy on record existed as to the merits of the
Samaritan and Hebrew texts, which differ very much. Up to
1815 the balance of opinion was in favour of the Samaritan, but
the question was at last decided as against the value of this
rescension.
The Samaritan recognised the five books of the Hebrew
Cannon only, but their other literature is such that the historical
books of the Hebrew may have been compiled from the Samaritan,
or the Samaritan from the Hebrew.
The Samaritan was the ancient Hebrew, and was a mixture ol
Chaldean and Syriac. The Hebrew, Samaritan, Chaldee, and
Syriac, are each derived from one original stem— the Oriental
Semitic—the parent of most all other languages in the world.
Arameac entirely supplanted the Hebrews before the Ist
century in Palestine, the former being called Hebrew nevertheless,
and toward the close of the 2nd century had ceased to be spoken.
Josephus who writes towards the close of the Ist century
makes it very plain that at the time of the Seige of Jerusalem,
the Greek language was not in general use, and Hebrew con-
tinued to be the common language up to Hadrians time, 185 a.d.,
from which period the Roman or Italic would have come into
general use. There are conflicting opinions concerning the
official language used during the Ist century in Palestine, but
there can be no doubt Hebrew was the common tongue.
The Apochryphal books composed in the Chaldee, the language
brought by. the captivity from Bablyon to Palestine. This
language was called Arameac, and remained the written language
of the Jews until the 18th century.


The Samaritan is a mixture of Hebrew and Chaldee, and the
ten tribes were the first to lose their tongue, but which was
afterwards called the old Hebrew. We have no positive examples
of the Hebrew character before the captivity. The oldest portions
of the Old Testament contain the purest Hebrew.
Dr. Irons of St. Paul’s, 1866, says, “ Our Lord quotes from
the Septuagint version frequently, and at times employs a version
differing from both it and Hebrew. Let it be remembered that
the present Hebrew text is only historical to the middle ages.
For the period of one thousand years previously—viz., to the
parchments used and known by our Lord and His disciples—the
character is Chaldee, and there are certain points placed below
and about the letters to denote the vowel accents, without which
it would be difficult to read the Old Testament at all with any
certainty.
These Masoretic points, as they are called, have been part of
the Hebrew Bible since their general acceptance by the Jews in
the 10th century, and they cannot be traced to a higher antiquity
than the 7th century.
Previous to the 6th century a.d., then, the Hebrew Bible was
read traditionally—that is, the sense was made to agree with
the tradition.
After the return, two important branches of Jewish litera-
ture sprang up : the Mishna and the Targums. The Mishna, or
Second Law, which forms the first portion of the Talmud —a
digest of the Jewish traditions and a compendium of the whole
ritual law, reduced to writing by Eabbi Hanassai, an influential
Jew in the 2nd century, who made the collection—being very
concisely written, and requiring notes. The Gemara was con-
structed to supply this defect, and this supplement, which forms
the second part of the Talmud, is generally known as the
Talmud.
The Targums were explanations, and when first designed, in
the 2nd century, were used orally and committed to memory,
and in the third or fourth century were committed to writing.
The Talmud (compiled about 800 a.d.) was divided into three
parts and treated of a variety of subjects —their ceremonies, their
Civil and Canon law, including every-day life —and profess to be
as old as Moses, who received it orally at Sinai, delivered it to
Joshua from him to the elders, to the prophets, and from them
to the men of the great Synagogue. It became necessary after
the dispersion to have all their oral and traditional laws pre-
served in book form.
Judaism is built on the Talmud. The history of the Talmud
is the history of the people from Ezra’s time to the final com-
pletion of the Gemerah at the close of the sth century, which,
with the Mishna, formed the Talmud.


Dr. Blunt says: “ The difficulties of understanding the
Gemerah are so great that no one can understand them unless
he has drawn Gemerah with his mother’s milk.” The whole
affair is a mass of confusion to understand, and means a
thorough knowledge of the Hebrew Bible.
Ancient copies in Europe are rare ; one or two only known
in consequence of the chequered fortunes of the Jews.
The Targums are embodied in the Midrash, were a collection
of the written portions of the Hebrew Scriptures before the 2nd
century, and were orally transmitted. They now embrace
nearly the whole of the Old Testament.
Dr. Davidson says : “ The word Targum signifies interpreta-
tion. There are eleven of them extant. The reputation of these
versions among the Jews has always been great, and abound with
Kabbinical fables. Some improbable accounts of their origin
have been fabricated in order to heighten their credit, but such
incoherent tales must be rejected by the sober enquirer.”
Like the Seventy, the Samaritan, and the Talmud, the Targums
have suffered through improvers.
The most extensive collection was made between the 7th
and 11th centuries. The evidence relating to their date is con-
flicting. The general opinion is, they are compiled from the
Masoretic text.
The Hebrew Bible is admitted by the Jews themselves to have
been corrupted in thirteen places designedly.
The Jewish traditions and the Talmud were compiled by the
Palestine Jews about the 6th or 7th century; and ancient authors
say that the Jews, within a comparatively short period, revised
the Hebrew text five times before the invention of vowel points
by the Masorets.
That the Jewish sacred books were plagarised or compiled
from Persian and Babylonian legends and literature. Those
who so choose to compare, will find sufficient evidence which
strongly point to the conclusion that the originals existed ages
before the formation of the Jewish Canon.
The Masorets from Massowrah —a collection of traditions,
and the Masorets from those who collected were a council of
Jewish Doctors of the Law, who settled or defined tfie text;
said to have existed from considerable antiquity—as far back as
Ezra’s time. At any rate, they are known from the 6th century
to have exercised great zeal in fixing the reading and interpre-
tation of the Hebrew Scriptures by affixing marginal notes, and,
when finally determined, settled the pronunciation by vowel
points and accents. Their criticism was so close that the centre
verse and letter of each section was noted and counted. This
system put an end to additions and interpolations, and settled
the real meaning for the future. One copy was afterwards set


apart to act as a standard for to regulate future editions.
Before this system was adopted each translator, according to
his own opinion, inserted his meaning in the margin ; and those
notes were often inserted in the text without any fraudulent
intent. Extensive corruptions may have taken place through
this cause.
When it is known that, hitherto, the Hebrew language could
hardly be translated without being accustomed to Jewish customs
and traditions, the difficulty and danger will be apparent.
That those points did not exist before the 6th century we
know from Jerome, who of all the Early Fathers was the best
Hebrew scholar (and he was not very perfect for he had a Jewish
scribe to assist him). Origen and Epiphanius are also mentioned.
Borne Jewish inscriptions attest the absence of vowel-points,
and it is also asserted that on the present Synagogue Rolls of
the Sacred Books they are also absent.
We have the first Hebrew MSS early in the 11th century from
which date at least they are established, and that they were first
used between the 6th and Bth centuries. All our Hebrew MSS
are Masoretic; those of older dates have either been destroyed or
not renewed. The Synagogue MSS, when through age or use
become unfit are carefully laid aside (buried or burned), seldom
fall into the hands of Gentiles, and are distinguished by their
beauty and uniformity of text.
The vandals and the latter crusaders and the fanatics of the
Middle Ages destroyed three parts of that which remained of the
Alexandrian Library. The Royal Library of the Ptolemies at
Alexandria is said to have consisted of 700,000 volumes ; 400,000
deposited in the Bruchion quarter, destroyed during the war of
Cmsar, 47 b.c. ; the other (containing 800,000 volumes) in the
Serapeum escaped. This was increased from age to age, till
finally burnt by Caliph Omar, 642 a.d. The order to his general,
Amius, ran thus : “If those books agree with the Book of God
(the Koran), there is then without them all that is sufficient. If
they contain anything against them, order them to be destroyed.”
The Emperors Constantine and Theodosius, in the same strain,
make the same order against all writings adverse to Christianity.
The works of Porphyr, a.d. 270 (thirty volumes), were fired by
Theodosius. His reputation was so great that other writings
ascribed to him were substituted in the interests of Christianity.
Cardinal Ximens (the Spanish Minister), a.d. 1482, delivered
to the flames in the Squares of Granada 80,000 Arabic MSS
translated from Classic authors. And, in 1490, the Inquisition
caused all the Hebrew Bibles to be burned, except a few MSS
used in the Synagogue of a recent date.
In 1780, 692 MSS of the Hebrew Bible were collated. Of all,
only two —one 1019 and one 1088 —and three of the 12th cen-


tury, the others range to the 16th century. The oldest is the
Bodelin, fifteen centuries from Ezra.
One of these Hebrew MBS preserved at the Vatican weight
8251b5., and takes three men to carry it. In 1512, Pope Julius,
then in great financial straits, refused to sell it to a rich syndi-
cate of Venetian Jews for its weight in gold ; which would place
its value at about £25,000, and that, too, when gold was worth
at least thrice what it is now.
Jews and Christians, from the earliest period, believe in the
authenticity and inspiration of the Scriptures.
The late Bishop of Lincoln, who translated Justyn’s work,
says : “ It is admitted on all hands that we possess no pure copy
of the Septuagint version previous and up to Origen’s time.
Justyn charges the Jews with corrupting the text, and mentions
the instances known in his time.
This the Jews admit; and the Christians themselves seem not
to have clean hands, not excepting Justyn himself.
This corruption is ascertained by comparing quotations from
the Septuagint text by Christian authors before this period.
The Seventy translation is the parent of every ancient version,
except the Samaritan and Peshito (Syrian), and was the sole
standard during the first four centuries. Nearly all the New
Testament quotations are from the Septuagint. The Early
Christians used the Seventy Translation. None of the First
Fathers were good Hebrew scholars.
The history of the earliest version of the Bible is lost in
complete obscurity. It is certain, however, it was first made in
Africa. In alluding to the numerous versions of the Bible
immediately after Christianity, we rarely find any clue to the
translator.
A Greek version of a portion of the Pentateuch is indicated
earlier than the Ptolemies ; quoted by Clement Alexandria and
Eusebius.
In the second century, a.d. 160, Acquilla (an apostate Chris-
tian), instigated by the Jews, made a new Greek translation.
The Fathers accuse him of mutilating a portion of Isaiah.
Modern scholars believe this charge founded. It was highly
esteemed by the Jews, and publicly read in the Synagogues.
Symmachus, an Ebionite, published his version soon after (the
exact date is not determined), and all the ancient writers class it
as written in pure and elegant language.
Theodotian, also an Ebionite, about the same period made
another. He follows the Seventy more closely than the two
former. The Early Christians using his translation of Daniel in
preference to the Seventy.
Origen, travelling in Eastern countries, found three other
imperfect Greek versions ; each only contained portions of the


Old Testament. One found at Nicopolis, another found at
Jericho (found in a cask), not before known to exist; one edited
by a Jew, the second by an Ebionite, the third uncertain.
Previous and up to this period there were three recensions
from the Septuagint known to exist.
The greatest name of the Eastern Church, in this or, perhaps,
any age, is that of Origen, for his iron industry, his piety, and
his ascetic life. The most eminent of Christian teachers since
the days of the Apostles—the most laborious of Christian
writers, he bore the opposition of the powers of the Church, as
well as the persecution of the State. His name was branded
with heresy by the one, whilst his body was mangled by the
other. But his name survives for all time as the father of that
Biblical criticism which is the scientific foundation of Christian
truth.
The original Septuagint translation had become much per-
verted, so that Origen, with a view of forming a correct copy of
the Scriptures, took upon himself the task of purifying the
Seventy version by issuing a first edition, comprising four
separate columns (called the Tretapla) containing the three first
mentioned versions side by side with the Hebrew text; and,
afterwards, a second edition, called Hexapala, in which the
latter versions were placed. From a comparison of all these
translations Origen revised the Greek text.
This Hexapala recension, consisting of nearly fifty volumes,
does not appear to have been copied by reason of its magnitude,
and is supposed to have perished along with the famous Library
of Pamphilus, when Cesarea was destroyed by the Saracens, 658 a.d.
Origen was exiled because he stoutly denied the perpetuity of
hell torments; even condemned devils would be forgiven.
Origen organised and taught at Alexandria large classes of both
sexes, whom he trained as copyists ; whilst one read aloud, the
rest wrote. By this means, large numbers of MSS copies were
multiplied and regulated to a uniform standard, which had much
to do with the circulation and acceptance of Origen’s version.
He revised both the Septuagint and the four Gospels. What
the Scriptures were from this time, Origen is credited with
establishing much of their permanence. But we possess no pure
copy of the Seventy version previous and up to his time. He
taught without reward, and lived by the sale of his works, which
are said to have been very numerous, but of which scraps only
now exist. Those that are preserved attest the fact that many
of his theological views are opposed to Modern Christianity, and
in strong sympathy with the Alexandrian School. Like all the
Christian Fathers, he constructed his own theological platform ;
forged, oftentimes, on the anvil of sincerity, but more often on
ignorance,


He says all Scripture has two meanings—one spiritual the
other temporal; the last, for those that are not prepared to
know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. And, as a safe-
guard against the temptation or scandal which might arise in
consequence of teaching both sexes, he made himself a euneuch
for the Kingdom of God’s sake. (Read Matt. xix. 12).
For 800 years his writings influenced the Christian world
until condemned by the Council of Constantine (544). Strictly
speaking, Origen was the only Christian theologian produced in
the 2nd and Brd centuries. Bishop Marsh remarks: “ Such was
the idolatrous adulation paid to the authority of Origen, that
alterations of the text suggested by him were taken as part of the
New Tastament, though he acknowleged there was no MS to
authorise such alteration. Our oldest copy does not reach
within two or three centuries from Origen.”
Neither must we forget that we are solely dependent upon Bishop
Eusebius, Constantine’s secretary and spiritual adviser for all that
we know concerning Origen, and, indeed, everyone else previous to
his time (825 a.d.) — who, if so inclined, by reason of his power
and resources, could have altered the history of Christianity to
such an extent none other could have attempted, and who is
repeatedly so charged ; nor is the proof wanting.
The result of his twenty-eight years’ labour was to cause
confusion, and leave the text worse than before.
About the same time Lucian, the martyr at Constantinople,
and a presbyter at Alexandria, published two more. By reason
of this intermixing of all these elements of error, the original
Seventy version is gone past recovery.
The Peshito (or Syrian) first mentioned 878 a.d., though
classed much earlier. The translator occasionally uses the
language of the Seventy. This version scholars class: if not the
best, one of them,
The Philoyenian, or New Syriac (616) is a compilation from
the Peshito and Alexandrine (a few fragments only preserved),
and has little value.
The Palestine-Syriac (written at Antioch, 1380) is classed as
originally belonging to the sth century, and is also fragmentary.
This version shows a strong leaning to the Chaldean dialect.
But we possess no originals of the above versions. None of
the copies are entire ; several are limited to few leaves. Their
primitive reading rests with successive transcribers.
After the Conquest of the Saracens, Arabic was mostly the
tongue of Christian countries, which caused many Arabic versions
to be made; and it is not doubted that the Hebrew or Samaritan
was the original. From the great liberties taken by the trans-
cribers, and its adherence to the Masoretic text, its value in
criticism is small.


The Egyptian version: After the Saracen Conquest, the Arabic
predominated. The Coptic, a mixture of Greek and Egyptian,
was used as it still is in the Churches. The fragments preserved
are derived from the Seventy in the old, and partly from the
Vulgate in the new.
The Ethiopia, Georgian, Slavonic and Gothic, are generally
acknowledged to be the product of Alexandrian and Greek
originals ; fragmentary only.
An entire copy of the Ethiopic Scriptures fell into the hands
of the Church Missionary Society some years ago. It is con-
sidered an early and valuable MS, but critics have not been
permitted to examine it in detail.
There exists a valuable Gothic MS (known as the Codex
Argentus—portions of four Gospels) in letters of silver ; initial
letters golden. The letters are so faded as to be hardly recognis-
able. And follow the Constantinople MSS.
The principal MSS of the Seventy version are the Codex
Alexandrian, Yaticanus, Sinaiticus and the fragment Cotonius ;
the latter is considered the nearest to the Seventy yet known,
because it differs the most from the others.
The compilers of our authorised version had not the benefit
of those early MSS ; only that of the Bezae, 7th century
portions of Gospels and Acts—written in Greek by a Latin,
which gives it an insipid character, and missing portions being
replaced by a hand of the 10th century, alterations are numerous
—(and four other MSS of lesser and later authority).
The first traces of the Italic version is 220 a.d., by Tertullian,
but it, probably, was in use earlier.
Jerome (892), who was instigated by Pope Damasus to revise
the Scriptures, whilst professing to render a faithful translation
from the Hebrew, by the aid of his Hebrew tutor, he followed
the Seventy where they did not greatly diverge; errors multiplied
by re-copying marginal notes, so that it is hopeless to say what
were the alterations made by Jerome.
A large portion of Jerome’s first translation was stolen by a
friend.
The term Vulgate was first used in connection with the
Septuagint version, and, afterwards, Jerome’s version was known
by the same term, which led to some confusion in after years.
Jerome, who was Secretary to Damasus, speaks of the false
readings of the Latin version (the Italic) existing before his
time. “ There was,” says he, “ almost as many forms of text
as copies—that every man had a gospel of his own.”
Jerome’s Old Testament version was a compilation from the
Septuagint and Hebrew, and, for many centuries, was the only
Bible used; it was, without doubt, the real parent of all the
vernacular versions of Western Europe (the Gothic and


Slavonic excepted): the lost Books of Bede, the Psalms of the
Bth and 9th centuries, and also of Wycliffe’s version, which is a
literal reading.
Jerome’s work was afterwards interfered with by half-learned
monks, and corrected by the Italic and other sources.
Charlemagne, in 802, ordered it to be corrected “from the most
ancient sources; ” and Sanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury
(1080), undertook the task of further corrections, for the avowed
purpose of “accommodating them to the faith of the orthodox.”
In 1150, Cardinal Nicolaus found as many copies as MSS,
and endeavoured to make a new emendation.
About the same time, the Paris theologians carried out several
corrections from the original language and MSS, with critical
remarks, which practice continued until the first printed edition,
without date or place. The first dated was printed at Mayenoe,
1462.
In 1546, the Council of Trent pronounced the Vulgate authen-
tic. Pope Sixtus announced it by a Bull (March Ist, 1589),
as well as forbidding the collecting of materials in future lest
the authenticity of the version should be undermined. But, in
consequence of the errors it contained, Gregory the 14th (who
succeeded him) ordered a new revision, which was announced by
Clement the Bth (1592).
The Bull issued by Pope Sixtus from St. Peter’s Chair, in the
plentitude of Apostolic power, threatens with all the pains of
excommunication any who should dare or presume to alter the
text in the least particular. But Pope Clement, within three
years after, issued a new edition differing in several thousand
places, and even contradicting it in many ; he also pronounced
excommunication against all who should dare to alter even the
most trifling particulars in future.
This historic fact with regard to infallibility is unanswerable
argument. Great endeavours were made by the Jesuits to
destroy this evidence, but sufficient remains to attest the truth.
Clement, the following year (1503), issued a second edition,
altered in many places from the first. This is the Book now
universally used by the Roman Catholics.
With Luther’s translation, the Vulgate had great weight;
which, in its course, had weight with Tyndale’s Old Testament
version.
The Psalter of the Prayer Book is nearly a literal copy of
Jerome’s ; passing through the Great Bible version of 1540, and
differing from the Hebrew.
The critical labours of Jerome were received with a loud out-
cry of reproach. He was accused of disturbing the repose of the
Church, and shaking the foundations of faith. Nor was his
version generally received until two centuries afterwards, or until


the Greek language died out. And up to the Bth and 9th
centuries, the new and old versions clashed in the reading.
Jerome was occupied from his 60th year to his 75th year in
this work. He died a recluse near Bethlehem.
The Old Testament, as might be supposed, is a version from
the Septuagint as a basis.
The oldest known portion of the Hebrew Bible is a copy of
1056, and two others a little later. There is a Hebrew MS of
the Prophets only, dated 916 ; its vowels and accents are placed
different to any other, and is highly valued.
And it is recorded: by order of the Jewish Senate all the
Hebrew MSS, before the 7th and Bth centuries, were destroyed
on account of their many differences from the declared genuine
copies.
The Syriac version from the Hebrew dates from the earliest
Christian age. Certainly, it was in existence before Jerome’s
time, as we have the text existing before the 4th century.
There exists now numerous other Biblical MSS, scholars
affirm, previous ages had not the benefit of, and now lay stored
up in the various museums a dead letter.
Dr. Wiseman enumerates twelve distinct versions of the Old
Testament.
The history of the English translation of the Bible connects
itself with many points of interest: in that of the Nation and the
Church ; the lives of individual translators ; the long struggle
with the opposition of men in power, and the religious condition
of the people.
The first version in the Anglo-Saxon was the Psalms in the
Bth century ; and soon after, Bede completed, during his last
illness, the Gospel of John. The scene at his death whilst
translating the last verse, is described as very affecting.
In the next century, Alfred had the Ten Commandments and
a few fragments from Exodus prefixed to his laws, and at his
death was engaged in a translation of the Psalms.
In the 10th century, the Pentateuch, four Gospels, and parts
of other books were translated for public use. All these, with
the possible exception of Bede’s, were second translations from
the Latin; copies of which are preserved. In 411, the midnight
slumbers of Rome were alarmed by the trumpet notes of Alaric’s
hosts proclaiming the overthrow of the mighty Empire.
In the Bth century, the Goths, Vandals, Huns, Normans and
Turks had established various kingdoms on its ruins. They broke
up the schools, abolished arts and manufactories, destroyed
monuments and churches, and inaugurated a reign of brute force
and mental darkness.
All Christian countries were reduced to the level of the
barbarous. Education belonged to a distinct trade ; poor and


rich alike were trained to arms. The alphabet and pen were
mysteries uncalled for. A few men, known as clerks, belonged
to the priesthood, and monopolised the profession as a special
class of artists, and who only taught their business to their own
class and apprentices. No one knew how to read or write, nor
was it expected or necessary. Nor had each chronicler much
conception of the world beyond his own horizon: his outlook
generally was from a confined cell, with all the events dim and
disjointed.
Even kings, in many cases, when required to sign a contract
stamped the. parchment with their smeared hand; which was the
origination of “Witness my hand,” and also brought seals into
requisition.
Monks in their seclusion were the chief conservatories of
religion and science, and through them were preserved and
copied the Sacred Books which they passed on to the generation
which followed.
Every monastery had its writing-room or scriptorium, where
MSS were copied by the monks. This state of affairs lasted for
about seven centuries, and is now called the “Dark Ages”; and
immediately before the morning was remarkable as being the
darkest.
King Alfred, in the 9th century, who founded Oxford
University, lamented that there was hardly a priest in his
dominions who understood Latin; and even centuries later, the
majority were marksmen.
And the historian “Mosheim,” of the 4th century, makes the
same declaration concerning the Christian bishops and presbyters
of that period. What a state of ignorance must have existed
amongst the common people.
An English translation of the Bible took place in 1290, but
the author is unknown. Two or three copies have been pre-
served.
John de Wycliffe, “the Morning Star of the Reformation”
(born 1824, in Wycliffe, Yorkshire), who was compared to a
“Voice crying in the wilderness,” was a Catholic priest, and the
original Father of the Reformation. He is honoured as the first
translator of the Bible into English (1880). It was revised
three or four times.
A manuscript book was expensive, slowly multiplied, and only
possessed by persons of wealth. In his time, there were but two
professions, the Army and the Church. Lawyers, physicians,
and even statesmen, were ecclesiastics. He first rose against
mendicant friars interfering with the settled priesthood, who
fattened on the thrift of the pious. He next counselled Edward
the 111. against payment of tribute to the Pope, to whom he was
sent as an ambassador. On his return to England, he denounced


the Pope as Anti-Christ and a robber. He was cited for this
language by the Church, but, through the influence of his friend
John of Gaunt, he was not tried. About this time, a great
schism broke out (1878), by the election of two Popes, which for
several years paralysed the papal power.
Wycliffe improved the occasion by calling upon all Chrisendom
to pull down the whole fabric of Romish dominion ; that Christ
had cloven the head of Anti-Christ, and made the two parts fight
each other.
Wycliffe showed no desire to interfere with the faith of the
people ; he opposed the temporal power as not in accordance
with teaching. He was in favour of the principles of the
Primitive Church, free offerings of their flocks, and equality
between bishops and presbyters, and opposed to establishments
and endowments.
He gathered around him a number of poor priests, who, as
missionaries, diffused his doctrine. “Go and preach,” he said
to them. “It is the sublimest work; but imitate not the priests
whom we see after the sermon sitting in the alehouses, at the
gaming-table, or wasting their time hunting. After your sermon
is ended, visit the sick and the aged, the poor, the blind and the
lame—succour them according to your ability.”
He wrote an immense number of tracts (200 are said to have
been burned), but his greatest work was his translation of the
Bible for the first time into Englsh, and which he multiplied by
the aid of transcribers. His missionaries recommended it to
their hearers, and in whose hands it became an engine of won-
derful power. Men were flattered with the appeal to their
private judgment. This translation gave form and permanence
to the English language, and will ever remain a mighty land-
mark in its history*
All through the mediaeval age, Churchmen objected to the
Scriptures being placed within the reach of the vulgar.
Wycliffe declared his object was to place the Scriptures within
the reach of all classes, in their native tongue. The whole of
the clergy took alarm and rose en masse to oppose the imparting
religious knowledge to the common people, whom they wished to
keep in ignorance on such matters.
An attempt was made in Parliament, in 1890, to prohibit its
publication, but was defeated by the influence of John of Gaunt,
Duke of Lancaster. But, twenty years afterwards, the clergy,
under Bishop Aurendal, succeeded in their object.
Wycliffe’s, as well as every other translation of the Scriptures,
was prohibited, and all who were known or suspected of reading
such books, were subjected to bitter persecution, which continued,
without intermission, until Henry the VIII., a period of 120
years.


Wycliffe’s zeal and perseverance during that work has never
been sufficiently honoured. His translation was made from the
Vulgate, and far from pure, the meaning in many places obscure
by reason of its literal adherence. Wycliffe’s version was revised
some years afterwards by Purvey, but was not improved on until
the publication of Tyndale’s, a period of a century-and-a-half
later; during which time, the Church successfully resisted his
work from being placed in the hands of the common people.
The copies preserved seem to have been owned by persons of
rank.
His memory, his manuscripts, and, above all, his version of
the Scriptures, gave life to the Lollards, whom no prosecution
could extinguish, and whose faith at last triumphed to the
supremacy of Protestantism.
After his death, his works, and as much of his Bible as could
be bought, were consigned to the flames as heretical, and his
bones to be cast on a dunghill.
Thirteen years afterwards, the Bishop of Lincoln, by command
of the Pope, had his remains disinterred and burned and cast
into the river Swift, which runs into the Severn and thence to
the ocean. Thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the emblems of his
doctrine, which is now dispersed all over the world.
In 1520, according to Fox, the zeal of the Christians in those
days seems to be much superior to our time. People sat up all
night reading and hearing the Scriptures read. Forty pounds
was the price of a book, and some gave a load of hay for a few
chapters of James or Paul in English. Those who were found
with copies without a license were punished. The church regis-
ters of Norwich and Lincoln attest this.
At Windsor Forest, in 1519, Dame Hawkins, mother of
several children, was burnt for possessing a parchment contain-
ing the Lord’s Prayer, Creed, and Decalogue.
Before the end of the 15th century, Bibles were printed in
Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch, German, and Bohemian, whilst
in England as yet only a few copies of Wycliffe’s version in
manuscripts were in circulation.
The Hebrew text of the Old Testament was issued as early as
1488, though few, except Jews, could use it. The first Hebrew
professor (Oxford) dates 1580.
The Greek text of the New Testament was not yet printed, but
public attention was beginning to grow in its favour, and scholars
were being educated with this end in view.
Erasmus about this time (1522) published the first Greek and
Latin Testament, which the common people could not under-
stand, and Tyndale says : “ This thing moved me to translate
the New Testament.
In this work Erasmus laboured under great difficulties: he


was confined to the “ Bezae,” a very imperfect MS, and four other
MSS of late date. Very many sentences and verses in his work
are not found in any other earlier MSS, and the reading in the
authorised version shows a strong adherence to Erasmus. He
omits John 5,7, the worst authenticated in the Bible, and not
found in any of the earlier MSS ; for which he received a storm
of public censure, and was forced to insert it in the second
edition, which, with many others, are consecrated by use.
With Tyndale (a Cambridge scholar of promise) commences
the history of the English-printed Bible. His remarkable
declaration “ that, if God spared him, ere many years he would
cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more of the Scrip-
tures than the clergy then knew.” The boast was not an idle
one.
The English Reformers, quickly taking advantage of the print-
ing press, with the assistance of Tyndale, who was a Canon of
Oxford, who had become a refugee in Antwerp, had determined
to bring out an English translation.
Tyndale carried out his desire under great difficulties. He was
hunted from place to place, and those patrons who succoured
him, suffered through him ; he had to fly from England to
Hamburgh. He says “he left his native country for ever to
suffer (as he says) poverty, exile, bitter absence from friends,
hunger, danger, and fighting, and yet achieved his purpose.”
He completed at Worms two editions of his work. Luther at
this time was also engaged on the New Testament.
Henry ordered all the copies of Tyndale’s that could be found
to be burned as heresies, which made the people the more eager
to procure them.
This version went through six editions in as many years. So
fierce and systematic was the work of persecution, that of the
fifteen thousand copies issued, there remains of the first only one
fragment, and of the others only two or three copies, which are
not entire. Thomas Garrett and an accomplice named Barnes
(both curates) had much to do with the circulation of the books
on their arrival in England. They were hunted from place to
place in their illegal traffic. Both were martyred together (1540).
Tyndale’s first issue was smuggled into England in spite of the
extraordinary efforts made to prevent them, and were the first
printed copies of any part of the Scriptures in the English language.
The chiefs of the Catholic party, to meet this difficulty, bought
up all the copies procurable, and had them burned ; but Tyndale
was equal to the occasion—brought out a fresh revision, and
kept up the supply in the face of the prohibition.
Tyndale studied hard at Greek for his revised edition of the
Old and New Testament. One of the first copies struck off in
vellum, beautifully illustrated, was presented to Anne Bolelyn,


who used her influence to protect one of the Bible merchants.
This delicate work is preserved in the British Museum. The
Queen took further interest in the work of Tyndale, who had, at
an earlier time, a perilous adventure from lending to one of her
maids a copy of Tyndale’s “ Obedience of a Christian Man.”
This Queen suffered death, as he himself did the same year, 1586.
He worked in exile thirteen years, had sacrificed everything
for the cause he had striven, and when his work was completed,
sealed it with his blood by being strangled. His last words were,
“ Lord, open the eyes of the King of England.”
More than any other man, Tyndale contributed in a large
measure to the originality of our English version, establishing a
standard which his followers copied. The greater part of his
translation remains intact in our present Bible. He used a
simplicity of dialect which endowed it with permanence; striking
betwixt the Hebrew and English idiom, and enriching our
language with the characteristics of the Semitic mind.
When, in 1586, Tyndale was strangled and his body burned,
the act was at least intelligible, but when his brother, being
convicted of reading the little octavo Testament of 1585 (the
cause of all the trouble), was sentenced, by Sir Thomas More,
“ to be thrown into a great fire which should ruin him,’ then
something of the incongruous at once asserted itself, and the
Testament acquired a reputation it would never have gained had
it been left severely alone.
Nevertheless, Sir Thomas More’s plan of expressing abhorence
and detestation of evil books was regarded in such favourable light,
that the hangman was very soon at work, and bon-fires began
to blaze in all the centres of culture and learning.
In 1588, the Inquisition seized upon Grafton’s (Paris) Bible,
which was being secretly put in type, and burned almost the
entire issue. The workmen fled, as well they might; and when,
the following year, the few copies saved were completed by
Whitechurch, at London, they were bought up on the instant to
pass through hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hands, and to be
read and re-read until they were thumbed out of recognition.
Between the. Church and the Printing-Press there was war to
the knife. In the words of the Vicar of Croydon: “We must
root out printing, or printing will root out us. And the Bishop
of London (1474), at a Council of his Clergy, said : “If we do
not destroy this dangerous invention, it will destroy us.”
During the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII., there was
muck to be done, and Catholic as well as Protestant books were
sent to the flames wholesale.
Henry burnt Catholic books, whilst, in Mary’s time, it was
Protestant books that suffered; Elizabeth contented herself with
burning political pamphlets. All this burning was done by the


hands of the public executioner. Although the touch of that
functionary was held to bring contamination with it, yet in
actual practice anything, whether quick or dead, which came
under his ban acquired immortality from that very hour.

(John xxi. 5.)
Ttnuale, 152 G Sayde vnto them Syrs have ye eny

Wycliffe, 1389: —“Therefore Jhesu seith to hem—Children

In 1534, a Convocation, under Cranmer, petitioned Henry for
an authorised translation, to be made by men nominated by the
the king. Coverdale, in the meantime, on Tyndale’s lines, had
completed a translation, under the patronage of Sir T. More and
Cromwell, and dedicated the work to Henry, who, however,
remained neutral, not permitting its circulation.
In 1537, Coverdale’s revised edition was licensed by Henry,
and, for the first time, the printed Bible was permitted to be
circulated freely, and the clergy were enjoined by royal authority
to place an English Bible in every church, ready of access for
everyone to read.
Mathew’s Bible was next issued, but, owing to ecclesiastical
objections it was not reprinted.
The Great Bible under the patronage of the bishops was under
the supervision of Coverdale, on the basis of Mathew’s, was next
published, and which proved so unsatisfactory that Henry issued
an order prohibiting future issues, until the king and clergy had
agreed upon a new translation.
By the King’s Proclamation (1540), Bibles were ordered to be
set up in every church for the convenience of the common people.
Only a limited number were allowed to congregate for this
purpose, to prevent disorder. This privilege caused great joy all
over England.
Taverner’s Bible was issued in 1539, went through a second
edition in 1551, but this version proved a failure.


In 1546, the King prohibited every edition excepting the Great
Bible, as well as ordering all and every other Scripture to be
destroyed, and the order was but too well executed. Some few
copies were preserved from the inquisitors, but the title-pages
were taken off to prevent identification. Whilst this was being
carried out Henry died.
Our English Bible contains thirty-nine books, following the
order of the Septuagint translation, and were originally written
without any breaks. The Jews, from a very early period, classed
them into greater and smaller sections (termed the Law) the
greater and lesser prophets, but it was not until the 18th century
that they were first divided into chapters as they now exist.
Subdivided into smaller sections, and marked in the margin
ABC, &c., at equal distances ; and, latterly, in 1551, Stephens
adopted the verses.
All modern Commentators are agreed that the division of
verses has not been judiciously made : the sense at the close of
the chapter being often broken, and, still oftener, in the verse.
But those inaccuracies must still remain : to alter would cause
serious inconvenience in all attempts to quote the Bible.
Edward was, however, devoted to the Bible, and the work of
printing the Scriptures was carried out, during his reign, with
great activity. Bibles were found and the public invited to read
and listen. No fresh revision occurred during Edward’s reign,
n©r during the reign of Mary, who followed. The copies set up
in the churches were burnt, but they were not sought out or
confiscated.
At the close of Mary’s reign, a new revision was published at
Geneva, 1557, which had a wonderful influence on our own
authorised version. This Genevan version was principally
extracted from the Greek as a basis, and was the most complete
of any available for the English reader.
A new revision took place and was dedicated to Elizabeth, who
ordered the Bibles to be set up in the churches once more. One
of the most active promoters of this work was Bodley, the father
of the founder of the Bodlein Library.
The Bishop’s Bible appeared in 1568; by whom revised is not
known, as the manuscripts only contain the initials of the
revisers. Eight bishops are, however, recognised as having taken
part in it, and from them it derives its title. The Queen was
petitioned to patronise it, but there is no evidence that she ever
did so. During the latter part of her reign, there were two rival
Bibles—the Bishop’s and the Genevan,—and this rivalry con-
tinued till the accession of James, who took a deep interest in
ordering an authorised version.
As there were now four different English translations, having
gone through several editions, some of these from the Latin,


and all differing from each other, both in language and inter-
pretation.
The present authorised version was the result of the celebrated
“ Hampton Court Conference,” in the reign of James I. (1604),
who ordered the translation in consequence of the many disputes
from the above cause. The King objected to all the versions as
being bad, and the Genevan (the most popular) the worst of all,
so said James.
James ordered and nominated a Commission, composed of all
the leading learned men in the kingdom, and numbering fifty-
four (the names of forty-seven, however, only appear on the
records), to undertake a new translation, which was the ninth
version of the printed English Bible.
The conditions under which this new version was to be carried
out were issued 1607. The first clause stipulated that the Bible
known as the Bishop’s was to be adhered to as close as possible;
and the 14th, that where the translation did not agree with the
Bishop’s, then to use the next best—the choice to be made from
five other versions, which are mentioned. Nothing was ever
known how close they adhered to those instructions, excepting
what the Preface states, but the work occupied two years and
nine months.
From this time forward, this revision (known as the King’s
Bible) has been the acknowledged Bible of the English-speaking
nations throughout the world. A copy of this version was
ordered to be placed in each church. One of this issue can be
seen, with an oaken cover, chained to the reading desk in
Comnur Church, Leicestershire.
Of the separate translations of the printed English Bible, all
went through two, and some six, editions. And on the Continent,
as many as twenty-four foreign translations, in a printed form,
were issued ; each successive translator more or less improving
on his predecessor, no two of any of the series completely
agreeing ; the general sense, however, remained.
The Rhemes version, New Testament (1582), and Douay
version, of 1609 (called the Douay Bible), profess to be a second
translation from Jerome’s work, and, comparing it with the
authorised version, the translators must have made good use of
it, from the large number of Latin words adopted. It is to this
version that we owe the final and most powerful action of the
Vulgate upon our present version.
King James’s version suffered most from the corrupt form of
the Greek text, which was severely handled in the first few
centuries of the Christian era. James’s translators only had
access to the Bezae, a very imperfect old manuscript of the Bth
century, and four others of late date. Since this date three or
four better authenticated manuscripts have come to light. The


text is confessedly imperfect, and the question of revising the
authorised version has, during the past century, been continually
agitated. When compared with other manuscripts of equal
authority, as well as those found since that date, the authorised
version labours under manifold corruptions.
The Greek and Latin versions carry us back to the earliest
age of Christianity, and, compared with Hebrew, involves the
latter in much confusion.
“ The Codex Sinaiticus ” (nearly entire) ranks first, St.
Petersburgh, 1859; 4th century. Corrected in the 4th, 6th and
7th centuries.
“Alexandrine,” sth century; British Museum, 1628 (nearly
entire). Corrected at various dates up to a late period.
“Vatican,” 4th century; Vatican Catalogue, 1475. Corrected
sth and 11th centuries. Has several gaps, and is much muti-
lated and interpolated. The majority of critics who have ex-
amined this MS have pronounced it, if not the very earliest, one
of them.
“ Syrian,” sth century ; Paris. No book entire. Corrected
sth, 6th and 9th centuries.
“Bezae,” Bth century ; Cambridge, 1581. Gospel and Acts,
with fragments of the Epistles of John. Some of the best critics
assign it to the 7th century. It is written in Greek by a Latin.
Both languages are much abused. Contains many gaps and is
much mutilated ; the text altered in many places, and other
readings introduced.
The remaining MSS, from the sth to the 10th centuries, follow,
most of which are only fragments, all of which are altered by
different hands and ages.
The Codex Alexandrine was presented to King Charles by the
Patriarch of Constantinople (1628). Nothing definite is known
concerning its earlier history. A tradition is inscribed upon it
in Arabic that it was written by Theda, an Egyptian Princess,
who lived not long after the Council of Nice.
The Trustees of the British Museum have placed such high
value on this MS'that they voted £30,000 for the purpose of
having a number of fac shfiile copies published, and presented
each of the principal libraries of Britian with a copy. One of
this issue can be seen at the Keference Branch of the Public
Library, Sydney. As a work of art, it is a splendid specimen of
the printer’s handicraft, and is worth inspection.
Although the “ Sinaic ” is classed first, and the “ Vatican,”
if not the first, one of the first, there are other considerations
which detract the real from the imaginary antiquity of the
former. And although the “ Sinaic” and “Alexandrian” profess
to have been the work of scribes of the 4th and sth centuries,
yet there is strong presumption that both those MSS may have


been only facsimiles of the issue of those dates in, perhaps,
appearance and style only. Concerning the “ Vatican,” this
suspicion is not so well grounded, and it is generally conceded to
be an undoubted relic of Christian Antiquity. To Tischendorf
we are indebted for the finding as well as the translation of the
“Sinaic Codex” (who is also credited with several other finds).
Like the “ Alexandrian,” it has been well preserved. Both
being reputed transcripts of 15 centuries ago, must have kept
well, when we consider their cumbrous nature as compared with
a fragment, continuous usage and liability to damage through
damp receptacles. Neither have an earlier history than the date
of presentation.
The oldest Christian MS, professing to be a copy of a document
of the 2nd century, preserved at Milan, and known as the
“ Muratori,” which was found in the monastery of Bobbia;
There is evidence that it was in use in Ireland in the 7th century,
and critics are agreed that its claim to be the oldest is established.
Dr. Westcott, who examined it, declares “ that it is a mass of
errors, erasions, omissions and corruptions, and was evidently so
in the copy from which it was obtained.”
Two or three MSS as early as the 6th and 7th centuries are
rescriptions, the original writing erased and written over, whilst
there are others which are known and classed quite as old, but
critics have not been permitted to examine them. With the
exception of the three first-mentioned, all the MSS previous to
the 9th century are fragmentary. One MS, the Codex Ravianus,
Berlin (Greek), is more than suspected as a clever compilation,
purporting to be of early date, in support of the contraversy
favouring I John 5,7, against Erasmus. There were certain
marks, however, which bore undeniable evidence of its being
constructed not earlier than the 15th century, and with fraudu-
lent intent. It is now no secret that copyists followed the more
ancient style of lettering and other marks of antiquity to increase
the value of their work, which, before the introduction of letters
and verses, became a task of great magnitude and nicety.
Taking our MSS as a whole (the majority, no doubt, possess-
ing great age), there is no real guarantee that can stamp them
with the age they are credited with. Certain it is, their sacred
character did not prevent theologians of every age making alter-
ations and improvements showing much boldness of execution.
The very limited number of MS copies at any time—and those
few in the hands of monks—the work of interpolation was not
difficult.
This, the concluding paper of the Old Testament series, professes
to deal with history only. Who will dispute the fact: * 4 That no
book ever suffered so much through forgers, improvers, and
priestly theologians claiming inspiration ?”


We may shut our eyes and endeavour to persuade ourselves
that all the interpolations and suppressions charged against the
Early Fathers are not proven. We must believe when we see
and handle the original documents that are handed down to us
not earlier than the fifth century (probably, much later), and
which are shocking undeniable evidences of the religious frauds
perpetrated by early Christian monks and their successors, until
stopped by the printing press— mild in character and results
compared with the fictitious gospels and epistles which all
writers record swarmed Christian communities during the 2nd
and 3rd centuries. During this period, upwards of fifty sects of
Christians existed, all collating books to suit their own particular
tenets, causing bitter dissension until the Civil power welded
all together, decided their “ confession of faith,” formulated a
sacred Canon, and organised an orthodox Church.
Dr. Wordsworth in his preface to the Greek Testament says :
“ It never can be granted that there are any, even the least errors
or inaccuracies in the New Testament.” And the Principal of
the “ Birkenhead College,” addressing a class of Divinity students,
says : The Bible, every word, every syllable, every letter, is just
what it would be if God had spoken from Heaven without any
human intervention.” Whilst an accomplished Church scholar,
Bishop Ellicott, declares “ It is in vain to cheat our own souls
with the thought that those errors in the authorised version are
either insignificant or imaginary.”
CURIOSITIES OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE.
The Bible was first so called in the sth century. Biblos was
the name given to the papyrus plant—Biblion, a book. The
Genevan version, 1560 (called the Breeches Bible), continued
the popular version for 100 years. It went through many
editions during that time, and was the first in England which
used the division of verses. The “ Breeches verse ” appeared
first in a version (Pentateuch and Gospels) printed in 1482, in a
work called the “ Golden Legende,” which although not classed
as a version of the Bible, it has strong claims for such distinc-
tion. It also appeared in three later versions : “ And thus they
knew that they were naked, and they take figleaves and sewed
them togeder for to coere they re members in manner of breeches.”
Coverdale’s Bible, 1550 (so says the Preface), was printed and
sold at the sign of the White Horse, Paul’s Churchyard, in
Edward’s time. Mathew’s Bible, 1551 (called the Bug Bible);
Psa. xci. 5 : “ Thou shalt not nede be afraid of any bugges by
night or the arrow, &c.” Coverdale’s and Traverner’s Bible had
the same translation. The Bishop’s Bible, 1568 (called Treacle
Bible, from Jer. viii. 22, “Is there no trycle ” —for balm). In


the Douay Bible, it is “ rosin.” The Douay Bible was translated
by some English exiles in opposition to the Protestant Reformer’s
Bible.
The 1611 version of James, in the original issue, reads:
“Appointed to be read in churches.” The term, “ authorised
version ” crept in by subsequent use. This version has thus
become the repository of the English language and the English-
speaking people —a marvel of perfection, simplicity and beauty
of its expression, considering that at this time there was
neither an English Grammar or Dictionary in the English
language. The credit is due to Tyndale.
The first or standard issue of the authorised version was called
the He Bible : Ruth. hi. 15 —“ Six measures of barley and laid
it on her, and he went into the city.” The second copy had
site went. These were the two standard copies of the 1611 issue.
The 1681 edition, A.Y., called the wicked Bible from having
left the “it ” out of the Seventh Commandment. The printer
was fined £BOO. In the three first cases, the translations were
considered the most appropriate by the revisers.
In 1887 four million copies of the Bibles were sold. The
British and Foreign Bible Society have printed and issued in no
less than 874 languages, 59 of which are tongues spoken in
Europe.
The revised version of 1881 was the result of a Convocation of
Bishops, held at Lambeth, for the use of the Colleges of Cam-
bridge and Oxford. The revision occupied ten years and a half,
viz., four days every month. During that time, the committee
consisted of about forty members of the most learned divines in
England and the United States ; twenty-seven of whom were
English, and composed of five different denominations. Nothing
was done hurriedly—the alterations agreed at one meeting, were
held over for confirmation at the next, and any word contrary to
the authorised versions had to be carried by a majority of two-
thirds. In the New Testament, the revisers have added nearly
a thousand words, and in nearly as many cases have omitted.
Dr. Lightfoot, Divinity Professor Cambridge (late Bishop of
Durham), President of the Revision Committee, speaking on
behalf of himself and the majority of the committee, says,
in answer to those who opposed the work : “ That revision,
not translation, is the object of all who have promoted the
new movement. To use the words of Jerome: their object
being not to make a new translation, nor a bad one a good
one, but a good one a better.” He further says: “ That
there are some spurious words and interpolations which have
been proved so, and which should have been enclosed in brackets,
as in the case of the first two printed versions, where the type
was also different.”


Dr. Lightfoot and the majority of his associates contend
“ that an authorised version is necessary, not merely of policy
but of truth ; that as long as those errors and defects remain,
so long may we not hope to allay alarmists ; that it will be an
unmixed gain to rid ourselves of an alliance which is a constant
source of weakness and perplexity : no more serious damage can
be done to a good cause than by summoning in its defence a
witness who is justly suspected, or manifestly perjured.” Dr.
Lightfoot enumerates several portions which are untenable and
indefensible, being the additions of successive copyists and trans-
cribers ; important omissions are also noticed.
Within the past few years, large quantities of ancient,
historical record have been discovered, which have placed at the
disposal of Biblical scholars much original and indisputable
evidence relating to the Book of Genesis and the History of the
Hebrews. The work of exploration and translation are still in
progress. The results are, that a new and bright light is being
thrown upon many portions of the Old Testament, which have,
hitherto, baffled all attempts to unravel, and which must interest
every student of the Bible.
The Compiler of this History has collected all those ancient
records, up to the latest discoveries, which corroborate or have
reference to the Old Testament.

THE PRE-HISTORIC EYIDSNCSS OF THG ORIGIN
OF THE
OLD TESTAMENT BOOKS
PREVIOUS AND UP TO THE ALEXANDRIAN TRANSLATION.
Comprise a series of five papers, opening with the “Assyrians
and Babylonians ” (their relation to the Hebrew Scriptures), and
closing with “ The language, literature, and religion of the
Hebrews,” and will be issued in three parts.
It is asserted—and upon good grounds—that all our Old
Testament critics and commentators have been theologians
subsidised from one school—either Church Dignataries or
University Professors —whose adverse criticism would imperil
both their caste as well as emoluments. Yet, even with this
social barrier, a large number of scholars have pointed out the
disease, but firmness to come forward and face
assured odium. If
Commentators cling tenaciously to the internal evidence
(exhausted by ecclesiastic usage), leaving the external testimony
to take care of itself. This, with the fact that there are few even
on those lines competent to deal with the question, the fact
remains that Old Testament criticism is not dealt with upon
historic data as a basis. And it is equally strange that popular
sentiment, through all ages, has been hostile to critical analysis.
The masses still clamour against any attempt to disturb existing
credulity, darkened by centuries of gross ignorance, schooled by
designing priests.
Within the memory of the present generation, an English
clergyman (a B.A. of Cambridge) suffered a long imprisonment
for propounding four questions touching the authenticity of the
Four Gospels. And, not very long since, a learned and devoted
Episcopal Bishop was hounded to his grave for writing a Critical
Commentary on the Pentateuch. And an English Justice,
holding a high position on the Bench but a few months back,
was forced to retire through a similar cause. Just a little earlier,
those two distinguished churchmen and this eminent jurist
would have suffered the extreme penalty.
Part 111 will contain a critical examination of the “ History
of the New Testament Canon.” R.B.


Supplementary Summary, Old Testament History,
Antecedent to Alexandrian Period.
UP to the last half century there was
no confirmation of the Book of Genesis
or Historical Books earlier than Alex-
ander the Great. Decent discoveries
have been opened up disclosing undoubted
records of past ages, the most reliable
that we possess, for the reason they are
national memorials contemporary with
the events they portray, being now
in the same state as when first cut 2,500
years ago, and must claim stronger
priority to being original, giving as they
do the name and date of the originals and from'whence obtained ; this cannot be
said concerning any of the written documents that have passed down to us.
Copyists, revisers, half-educated monks, and fanatical theologians of all ages when
books and readers were few and far, have so completely altered the originals as to-,
be virtually re-constructed. Herein consists their value, and the distinction is a
momentous one to the Christian world. Within the past few years by the aid of
the pick and shovel and the spirited enterprise of the Trustees of the British
Museum many thousands of those imperishable leaves, including several libraries,
numbered and classed, have been exhumed from amongst the ruins of Fortress
Palaces of the old world, and are now being deciphered by the Antiquarian Scholars
of the British Museum. The readings up to the ime throw a new and
interesting light upon the origin as well as the inte r pr - of the Old Testament,,
and scholars are watching future developments with i . ase interest.
This history properly speaking commences with the Alexandrian translation,,
which we call the external testimony. We now add a few remarks dealing with
the internal evidence contained in the Book itself, which brings us back three
centuries earlier —here the Jewish record is exhausted. Immediately before the
Christian era there existed three distinct versions of the Old Testament, viz., the
Hebrew, Samaritan, and the Greek, each differing in many important particulars..
The first originally comprised five books, but when the Canon was settled about
the sth century a.d., 22 books; The Samaritan five books only; the Greek,
called the Septuagint, according to Josephus and other early writers, endorsed by
all modern scholars, contained only five books, the remainder being added by
various compilers in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, b.c., subsequently drawn into the
Vulgate of the 4th century, a.d., and later on into our authorised version of 1611. In
1825 a violent controversy took place touching the inspiration of the Apocryphal
books resulting in their publication being discontinued. It has never been shewn
by whose authority the original Canon was compiled, or who it distinguished
the genuine books from the spurious, and the same applies to the rejection of 14
books by modern Protestants. Concerning others the Church is still troubled.
The Jewish Doctors suffered the same conflict of opinion and did not finally
decide until their language ceased to live, and their sacred books threatened with
a similar fate. Our oldest copy dates from the 11th century, a.d. Neither has
any attempt been made to shew from what originals these versions were drawn.
These are questions which those who have to do with the Church of the future
must face and the sooner the better; it is no answer that they are “Holy and
inspired a multiplicity of such phrases proves nothing. Whilst every other of
the ancient nationalities have left us a monumental history, the Hebrews have
left us completely in the dark. Amongst the numerous explorations recently
undertaken by the British Government and people to explore Palestine, particularly
Jerusalem, during the last 25 years costing £BO,OOO stg., not a single sentence or
letter could be found engraven on those magnificent ruins to indicate when by
whom or for what purpose constructed. Shafts up to 100 ft. have been sunk,
galleries driven hundreds of yards along the Temple foundations and outer walls~


Every square foot of Palestine has been surveyed, every likely locality carefully
examined but not a scrap which would indicate any connection with the Mosaic
code ; nor indeed do we know of any Hebrew letters except the undated Siloam
one and an inscription on a castle 176 b.c., earlier than the 2nd century a.b., but
numerous evidences were exhumed, principally terra-cotta-ware, which clearly
-establish the fact that the inhabitants of the Temple date were idolaters, that
their religious practices were identical with the Phmnecians. The cromlechs
circles and stone pillars so often met with in Palestine by the English topographic
engineers leave no doubt concerning the practice of the original inhabitants, setting
up Bethels and anointing them continued until a late period and still survives in
India. Captains Conder and Warren, K.E., of the Palestine survey attest this,
whilst Orient scholars identify both languages with Assyrian, difficult to distinguish
—so alike—all three nationalities being kinsmen descending from the same Semitic
stock. An important discovery in Moab 1868 establishes the same identity : the
Moabites and Jews (896 b.c.) worshipped Yahveh, sacrificed the first-born and spoke
the same dialect—this is the earliest as it is the only instance we have of Old Hebrew,
as it is also the first specimen of the Phmnecian alphabet.
We are wont to believe the Hebrews of the Exodus were an inoffensive and
-defenceless host. About 6GO-*.c. Ba Ck»l4*en priest and historian entitled
to respect, gives an account which agrees with Egyptian tradition and which main-
tains a conclusion directly opposite. The only difference betwixt the Hebrews and
the Canaanites whom they dispossessed being, the former were reclaimed and
trained to arms by reason of their long contact with a highly civilised people whilst
the latter were rude nomads and uncult, forming numerous tribes and known as
the Hittites, who existed as a fighting unsubdued race as far back as the Elamite
invasion (2,200 b.c.) a circumstance and event without parallel in the old world history.
Sculpture or tracing on bricks seems to have supplied the place of writing
until a very late period in the history of mankind, the exception being the papyrus
of the Egyptians exclusively. In Homer’s time (880 b.c.) the Greeks were then
ignorant of writing, Herodotus mentions the first use of skins for this purpose
484 b.c. Throughout the Book of Genesis there is not a single allusion to
the practice of writing. The Book of Jasher, the Book of the Chronicles,
the wars of Jehovah, Ac., are quoted evidence their existence, but none
when and where. In the 6th century it would seem that clay was used as a
writing material in Judah as in Babylon. In Joshua’s time they wrote on plastered
stones, probably cemented. Ezekiel mentions writing on sticks, and Ezra, in Esdras,
says he wrote the Pentateuch from memory on tables of boxwood. Job mentions
an iron stylus on lead. The laws of Solon were written on wood, and wooden
tablets were in use until a late period called a codex. The decipherment of the
arrow-headed characters at the British Museum has thrown a flood of light over
the origin as well as the translation of the Old Testament books. According to
Professor Sayce, of Oxford, one of our best Orient scholars, very much of the
■existing version has been guess-work, the original text mutilated to an extent none
can now determine, for instance, the literal rendering in the A.V. Isaiah viii. I
should have been, “ Take thee a great slab and write upon it with the graving tool
of the people, hasten, spoil, hurry, booty.” Up to the present no one has challenged
this scholar. In the year 624, b.c., Josiah who was eight years old when he
began to reign, the regency being guided by the priesthood, Hilkiah (the name of
Jeremiah’s father ) officiated at the temple, Josiah sent his secretary a message to
Hilkiah who told Shapham he had found the Book of the law, having read some,
lie took it to the King and read it to him, who rent his clothes commanding Hilkiah
and others to make enquiries of Jehovah concerning the words found in the Book;
they went to the prophetess Huldah the wife of Shallum (the name of Jeremiah’s
uncle) and communed with her. Her reply was, “ Tell the man who sent ye, thus
saith Jehovah,” Ac., repeating a sentence which sure enough was found in the
Book and attesting its genuineness. The King was troubled and gave orders to
have the idolatrous vessels in the temple cast out, the groves erected by Solomon
.and the Kings of Judah (four centuries previously) destroyed/ The Book was found
by the High Priest during repairs and was supposed to have been the original roll
said to have perished at the destruction by Nebuchadnezzar eight and a half centuries
from Moses’ time—the chronicler does not say it was the identical one. Colenso
remarks “It is scarcely possible to resist the suspicion that the writing, placing,
And finding were contemporaneous events.” Until the latter days of the Jewish


monarchy the Jews never doubted the existence of other Gods. The fact of the
proves, high places, and sacrificial pyres erected and kept up by royal patronage,
the continuous mention of the worship of the Sun God and Moon Godess, Moluch,
and Askeroth at Mount Olives, the preservation of the brazen serpent up to
Hezekiah’s time, and the sacrifice of the first-born up to Zedekiah’s time, confirmed
from other sources, and the continual allusion to idolatry by the prophets in scathing
language are shocking evidences which warrant only one conclusion, viz., that the
nation up to the Reformation was steeped in paganism, and so continued more or
less until their conquest by the Greeks and Romans. Higher ideas were intro-
duced after the captivity and the worship of Jehovah (the Heb and Bab Yahveh are
identical) as the sole God became the state religion in Josiah’s time under coercion,
but after his death the sacrificial pyres and groves were once more in full blast.
Amongst phrensied turbulent spirits rooted in idolatry the change was too sudden
and sweeping to be successful, but during the life of the existing generation the
fighting inhabitants of Judah were almost extirpated, the residue becoming blended
with ideas contracted in Babylon, the result was inevasible.
A remarkable circumstance in connection with the stories narrated in the O.T.
the localities are neither in or near Palestine, but on the shewing of the Jews
themselves belong to the Euphrates valley and Babylon in particular. The Creation,
•Fall, Flood, Tower, Patriarchial and Angelic names Disruption in heaven as well as
many of the Psalms shew as originals in Babylonian literature. The most super-
ficial reader will notice all through Genesis two separate accounts—the work of
two distinct compilers, and Biblical scholars detect the hand of a third editor filling
in the gaps from a priestly basis, and it is a singular as well as a significant
coincidence that the Babylonian libraries furnish us with both originals. It i&
amazing to find the Temple was constructed from the Phoenecian model, that the
fittings ordered by Jehovah were the exact counterpart of the Assyrian formula,
the pillars, palms, lillies, laver supported by twelve bulls, mercy-seat and cherubims
(a triad) ordering of priests, circumcision, scapegoat, ark, sacrifices, fasts, shew-
bread, serpent, Sabbaths. Sculptured originals, including all the ritual used in
Babylon, may be seen preserved in the British and Continental Museums.
Many commentators say Deuteronomy was written during the Josiah period.
Colenso, a talented Hebrew scholar, points to Jeremiah as the author—the theories
in support have been unanswerable. The Book of Kings is also classed as his.
According to the Talmudists, followed by the older theologians he was the com-
piler of Chronicles, his name appears in three separate places. The Greek
translators call them a collection of things omitted. If we leave out Chronicles
there is no evidence that the ceremonial law was practised from Joshua’s time,
nor any mention of the Book of the Law until after the return from exile, and their
many years contact with the Babylonians. Jeremiah was the greatest political
and religious agitator that ever appears in Jewish history ; his unpopularity forced
him to take refuge in the King’s Court, was several times imprisoned, and eventually
fled with Zedekiah’s family to Egypt. In 1886 an important discovery has brought
to light the palace occupied by the Hebrew Princesses, its local name Tell-Defeneh
identified as the Tahpanhes of Jeremiah. The locality agrees with the Prophet’s
account, and where his last writings date from. Numerous relics and inscriptions
attest the genuineness of this disclosure. It is remarkable that having lived at or
near Jerusalem several years before and after the finding, he never alludes to the
■circumstance. The Jews held a strange tradition about the restoration of the
Pentateuch which stands recorded in the Book of Esdras where Ezra is introduced
as saying, “ Thy law is burnt therefore no man knoweth the things that are done
of Thee, or the words that shall begin, but if I have found grace before Thee, send
the Holy Ghost into me and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since
the beginning which was written in thy law,” and Ezra says his prayer was heard,
receiving a command to retire into a private place with five men, swift writers,
to write on tables of boxwood. In this way Ezra is supposed in the tradition of
the Jews of that age to have recovered by a miraculous strengthening of his
memory the original which he knew once by heart. The early Christian Fathers
corroborate the belief in this accouut. The Book of Esdras was accepted as a
genuine work by both Jews and Christians. It is a century and a half from Josiah’s
time to Ezra’s, hence the difficulty to reconcile both statements regarding one
book. Ezra a High Priest himself, son of a High Priest, came from Babylon, says
he returned with the Book of the Law in his hand. Nehemiah, another Priest and


blfbUO
F 774 V
Reformer, came later on as Persian Consul to enforce the new code. Both were
missionaries and companions trained at Babylon, voluntary coming to Jerusalem
from the Persian Court, to which place Nehemiah returned, and very possibly Ezra
—the evidence pertaining to their identity is veiled in traditional obscurity.
O.T. history ends with Jaddua High Priest (322 r.c.) Additions were made
subsequently by the collectors of the canon—the first was made by the High
Priest Simon (300 r.c.) who added Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther and Malachi. Some
of the later prophetic books written in Hebrew shew undoubted proof of having
been translated from Chaldee originals, notably Daniel whose several editors are
conflicting as to dates and events, and outside the Babylonish sphere. It contains
the first direct allusion to the Resurrection—of Persian origin—and the Maccabean
period. The Jews knew nothing about future rewards and punishments previous
to the Reformation. Nor is it denied that Isaiah had several authors whose identity
has not been established, and not a particle of evidence for their authority to
prophesy. Neither were known to exist before the Reformation, although cast at
various periods covering two and a half centuries, nor do their compilers shew how
they came by them. —Enc. Brit. If Biblical scholars are correct in this exegesis then
the gift of prophecy is much simplified. Comparing the Alexandrian with the
Masoretic version of Isaiah there is a difference of several chapters and verses,
amounting to nearly 3000 words, neither claim to be the earlier. It is worthy of
remark that the witch who vouches for the Book of the Law was the wife of a priest,
that all the prophets and compilers were priests schooled at or under Babylonish
influence, and that this outcrop of anonymous writing was contemporaneous with or
immediately after the return from exile, bringing with them the Messianic doctrine
first promulgated in the East, wbout Certain it is, the earliest version
of the Gospels is traced to Armenia in the Euphrates valley, not from Palestine-
as generally supposed. The Babylonians, even the common people, could read and
write, and their acquaintance with scientific subjects was wonderful. The Jews
instinctively were an exclusive people held tightly by the priesthood, who only were
educated, and up to a late period what they did know was orally transmitted to their
own sept. Their written language was expressed by consonants only, purposely
omitting the vowels, reducing their language to a skeleton, conserving their interests
as well as being a successful barrier to Gentile intrusion ; “ Henceforward the-
descendants of this remarkable people have survived to the present day a distinct
race amongst every nation with distrust, obstinately opposing everything novel,
pertinaciously adhering to rites and ceremonies passed down to them, living
mummies of the old world.” Back far as we can reach through the mists of antiquity
we find the priesthood as they ever have been found, either guiding or ruling the
world, the better qualified by reason of their social position and education, nor
have the craftsmen of the present day lost their ancient cunning, still
evade facts, twist and suppress history so as to baffle and confound any who may
question what they vouch for. It is they who have flooded the world with
literature employing all the logic and sophistry education and ingenuity can conceive,
to bolster up evidence which rests on myths and traditions of their own creation.
The age of miracles and prophecy has served its purpose, refusing to vegetate-
where the process of investigation and criticism can be applied. The well kept
watchmen on the tower cry, “ All’s well, sleep on,” but in face of the facts just
mentioned, is there not some cause to arouse and see whether or not we live in a
fool’s paradise ?
