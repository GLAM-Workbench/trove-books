PREFACE.
In compiling this series of Queensland School Readers, several
objects have been kept in view;
(1) To instil into the minds of pupils such a love for
literature as will last beyond school-days and be to them a
source of permanent profit and delight. To this end, the
lessons have been chosen from a very wide field. Fiction,
travel, history, science, art, biography—all have been laid
under tribute; and the result is a collection of extracts that
may well illustrate all that is best in written English. Special
attention has been devoted, in all the books, to Australian
subjects, and to the poetical pieces. Many of the latter can
easily be learned by heart, and will prove a “joy for ever” to
the diligent scholar.
(2) To impart useful information. A glance at the
contents of each book will show that the Readers are more
than pleasant literary extracts: they are a treasury of useful
knowledge as well as of beautiful thoughts.
(3) To provide matter of such variety and interest that
the valuable art of reading aloud may be fostered, and become
a pleasure and not a task to both reader and audience.
(4) To teach pupils to use and to write good English. It
is hoped that not merely the lessons themselves but also the
copious notes, exercises, etc., may furnish material from which
senior classes may learn to appreciate what is meant by an
author’s style, and may be taught thereby to improve their own
methods of composition.
(5) To secure a gradation of lessons, so that each book —
in itself adapted as far as possible to suit the school curricu-
lum —may naturally follow its predecessor by an imperceptible
ascent in standards.
Book I. of the Queensland School Readers contains forty
lessons, covering class-work for six months. Sixteen pieces are in

poetical form —pleasant, wholesome rhymes that are easily stored
in the memory to make music there in after days. The twenty-four
prose pieces, all revised and some specially written for this series,
have been collected with a view to the tender age and the wakening
sympathies of the pupil. Seldom does a word appear of more than
two syllables, and the lessons are as easy to understand aa they are
to read. Some of the fables that never grow old are here —“The
Fox and the Cat,” “The Tortoise and the Eagle,” “The Ass in the
Lion’s Skin. ’ ’ To omit such would be robbing childhood. Pupils
who rejoice in pictures from Nature will find an interest in almost
every lesson, and those whose instinct bids them make pets of
animals will read with delight the stories of the Emu, the Frog, the
Opossum, and the Magpie. Many of the readings convey simple
moral lessons in a form suitable for children. Peeps of future fields
of thought appear in several of the selections, such as the “Children
of the Clouds,” “Books,” “The Locomotive’s Story,” “The Flag
of the Empire, ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ The Australian Flag. ’ ’ Fairy stories, such
as “Mother Hulda,” appeal to the growing imagination, and
appropriately combine with the other selections in preparing the
pupils for the world of fancy and fact that awaits them in succeeding
Readers.

1. “ Dear me, little girl, do look
where you are going! Your pony nearly
stepped upon one of my pretty chicks.
Yes, they are little dears, with brown and
white stripes of down upon their bac|is.
2. “ You people are a great trial to my
family. A few weeks ago, a boy found a
nest which my wife bad made upon the
plain. In it were five dark-green eggs.

THE EMU.
3. “ The boy picked them up and took
them away in a bag, although he must
have known that they did not belong to
him.
4. “ A .horse that once lived in a city
told me that he had seen some emu’s eggs
in a window, with pictures cut upon them.
I am sure my wife never meant that her
eggs should be used in that way.
5. “ However, we made a second nest in
a place which could not be seen so easily,
and she laid ten eggs in it.
6. “If you will count the chicks, you
will know that the eggs were all good
O O o
ones. I sat over them for many days.
The sun rose in the sky nearly sixty times
before the chicks came out of the shell. I
was growing a bit tired, but now I am
very proud of my family.
7. “My wife has laid more eggs, and
she is taking her turn of sitting over this
hatch. It is as much as I can do to mind
the chicks. I show them what fruits,
grass, and roots are good to eat.
8. “No, I cannot fly. I have two small
wings, but they are quite useless for


flying. I can run fast, and I am sure
that your pony, could not catch me if I
ran away.
9. “ My legs are stout and strong, and
I can kick hard at anyone who tries to
hurt me or my chicks. I can look over
your head while you sit upon your pony.
10. “My feathers are thin, and long,
and grey in colour. An eagle told me
that he had seen a band of soldiers with
emu feathers like mine in their hats. 1
wonder where they found them ?
11. “What did you say? That was
your thimblg ? Dear me! I thought
when you dropped it, that it was good
to eat. I found a bright round thing
in the grass yesterday, but it kept saying,
' tick, tick/ so I left it alone.
12. “It was your silver watch, and
you have come to look for it? Well, it is
over there, by that tuft of grass. No need
to thank me!
13. “ Did you hear that booming noise ?
That was my wife calling for me. I expect
she wants to count the chicks. I am
glad you found your watch. But I must
go now. Good-bye, little girl.”

1. The mice were in trouble. They lived
in a fine, large house, they had plenty to
eat, they were all good friends, and they
could have been quite happy but for the
cat—“ that dreadful cat ” they called her.
2. One night they met to talk about
their trouble, and to see if they could not


find a way to end it. Brown-back, Grey-
ear, White-whisker, and many other mice
were there. They all agreed that some-
thing must be done.
3. “We are not safe anywhere,” said
Brown-back. “If I slip into the pantry to
get a bit of cheese or a scrap of bacon, down
comes the cat. If I steal into the dining
room to pick up a few crumbs, she is sure
to be there.
4. “ She watches, too, at every hole we
make. lam afraid to work lest she should
hear me. Fancy not being able to gnaw
even a bit of wood in peace! ”
5. “ What is the best thing to be done ? ”
asked Grey-ear. “ What if we all ran at
her at once, and bit her ? Or shall we make
noises, and give her a fright ? ”
6. “ No,” said White-whisker ; “ she is so
bold that we could not hurt or frighten
her. But I have thought of a good plan.
You see this bell; let us hang it round her
neck. Then if she moves, the bell will ring,
we shall hear it, and so we can keep out of
her way.”
7. “Yes! yes! yes!” cried all the mice.


“ That is just the thing. Let us bell the
cat. Hurrah ! Hurrah ! ” White-whisker
looked quite proud.
8. After the noise had gone on for some
time, the mice stopped to rest, and Brown-
back asked, “ Who will hang the bell round
the cat’s neck ? I can’t do it myself; I
have my little ones to look after. Will
you do it, White-whisker ? ”
9. “I am afraid not,” was the reply; “ I
am lame. It needs someone who can move
quickly. One of the young mice would be
able to get away faster than I could.”
10. “ Will you, Grey-ear ? ” asked Brown-
back.
“ You must excuse me,” said Grey-ear.
“ I have not been well since that time when
I was nearly caught in the trap.”
11. “Well,” said Brown-back, “If it is
such a good thing to do, someone ought ti>
do it at once. Is there any one who will ? ”
12. Not a sound was heard. Even puss,
who just then peeped in, could hear nothing.
When the. mice caught sight of her, there
was a rush for their holes. The bell was
left on the floor.

little robins built their nest
Upon an apple-tree ;
The hen at all times stayed at
home,
The little ones to see;
And all the little robins said,
“ Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee. wee.”


2. One day the sun was warm and bright,
No clouds were in the sky,
Cock-robin said, “My little dears,
Tis time you learnt to fly;
And all the little young ones said,
“ Well try, well try, well try.”
3. I know a girl, and who she is

When mother says : “ Do this, or that,”
She says, “ What for ? ” and “ Why ? ”
She'd be a better girl by far
If she would say “ 111 try.”

1. We know that the noise made by
one kind of beast is not the same as that
made by any other kind. A lion roars, a
horse neighs, a cow lows, a sheep bleats,
anVi an ass brays.
2. There was once an ass who was very


vain. He thought that ho would deceive
the other beasts, and make them think he
was a lion. So he put on a lion’s skin.
3. The silly cows and sheep mistook
him for a real lion. They ran away from
him in great fear. This made the ass
still vainer, and he ran after them, braying
loudly.
4. Soon he met a fox. But the fox was
wiser than the sheep and cows, and did
not run -’. ay. He waited to receive the
5. The ass was surprised, and said:
“Run for your life! Don’t you see I am


a lion, the strongest of all beasts? Either
run or be eaten up!”
6. “ I shall do neither,” replied the
fox. “You cannot deceive me, you silly
creature!
7. “ I might have mistaken your looks,
but I shall never mistake the braying of
an ass for the roaring of a lion.”
8. Those who pretend to be what they
are not are laughed at when they are
found out.

And yet we all agree,
That every broken plate was cracked

He puts damp wood upon llie fire,
And kettles cannot boil;
His are the feet that bring in mud ;
And all the carpets soil.'-
That creaking hinge will always creak,
For you can plainly see,
We leave the oiling to be done
By Mr. Nobody.
The finger-marks upon the door
By none of us are made ;
We never leave the blinds unclosed
To let the curtains fade.

Weren’t torn by you or me :
There is no doubt they were the work

1. Peck was a magpie. His parents
built a nest in the fork of a gum-tree near
a house. It was not a very tidy nest, but
a «/ '
looked like a bundle of sticks.
THE PIPING CROW (MAGPIE).
d. The nest was lined with hay and
feathers, and in it the mother magpie


laid four pale-green eggs, spotted with
brown.
3. After the nest was built, the magpies
seemed to think that they owned the
garden and the fields around it.
4. If one of the fowls strayed from the
yard and went near the tree, a magpie
would chase it home again.
5. One day, indeed, a man on horseback
rode under the tree, and one of the birds
flew down and knocked his hat from his
head.
6. When the eggs were ,hatched, the
magpies were very busy. They searched
through the garden and fields, and found
hundreds of insects and grubs with which
to feed their babies.
7. Just before the young ones were able
to fly, a great storm of wind blew one of
them out of the nest.
8. A boy found the poor little bird and
took it home. He fed it with bits of meat,
and it soon became quite tame.
9. When it was fully grown, its wing
feathers were cut, and it was given to a
boy in town, who named it Peck.

1. One day a cat met a fox in the wood.
“ Ah! ” she thought, “he is wise, and
people think much of him. I will speak
to him/’
2. So she said, in a very friendly way,
“ Good morning, dear Mister Fox, how are
you ? ”
3. The fox, full of pride, looked at the
cat from head to tail, and would hardly
speak to her.
4. At last he said, “ Oh, you poor little
hungry mouse-hunter, you old gray tabby,
what are you thinking about, to ask me
how I am? What have you learned, and
how many tricks do you know ? ’*


5. “ I know only one trick,” said the
cat, meekly.
“the hounds had taken him,”
6. “Well,” said the cat, “if the hounds
are behind me, I can spring up a tree out
of their way, and save myself.”


7. “Is that all ? ” said the fox. “ Why,
I know a hundred tricks. I have, besides,
a sackful of cunning. But I pity you,
puss; so come with me, and I will teach
you how to get away from the hounds.”
8. Just then a pack of hounds was seen
coming. The cat quickly sprang up a
tree, and seated herself on one of the
branches, where the thick leaves quite
hid her.
9. The cat looked to see the skill and
cunning of the fox, but the hounds had
taken him, and held him fast.
10. “ Ah, Mister Fox,” cried the cat,
“ your hundred tricks are not of much use
to you. If you had known my one trick,
you would not so soon have lost your life.”
11. We should never boast of what we
know, or of what we can do. Those who
can do most boast least.

wound
1. There was once an old and very deep
well, from which people drew water by


means of a rope passing over a small wheel.
To each end of the rope a bucket was made
fast.
2. A strong pull brought one bucket to
the top, while at the same time the other
bucket was lowered to the water. They
always passed each other on the way up
and down, but they never had time to
speak.
3. At last the rope became so worn,
that it was unsafe to use any longer, and
a new rope had to be put in its place.
While this was being done, the two
buckets were left standing together near
O O
the well.
4. “ What a dull life we have! ” said
one bucket to the other. “J am quite
tired of it. No matter how full we come
up, we are always sent down empty. I
think it is very hard! ”
5. But the other bucket laughed, and
said, “ What a funny way you have of
looking at things! To me, there seems
nothing to grumble about. Don’t you
see, that whenever we are sent down
empty, we always come up full ? ”


6. Boys and girls sometimes talk like
these two buckets. You may hear one of
them say, “ Just as we are having a good
game, we are made to stop, and go in to
work again/’ “ Yes,” the other will reply,
“ but as soon as work is over, we always
get out to play.”
7. There are two ways of looking at
things. If you wish to be happy, look
at the bright side.
12.—The Tortoise and the Eagle.
tor-toise gruni-bled through

eag-Ie seized beau-ti-ful
1. A lazy tortoise lay
basking in the sun,
and loudly grumbled
because her life was
not what she wished
it to be.
2. “ Look at those
birds,” said she, “ how
lightly they fly through
the air, while I can
only crawl about on
the ground. Oh, that
T, too, had wings! ”


3. An eagle flying near heard what she
said.
“ What will you give me,” he asked, “ if
I take you up into the air ?”
“ Anything in my power,” was the reply.
4. The eagle seized the tortoise in his
claws, and flew up with her to a great
height. But the heavy creature slipped
from his grasp, and fell to the ground.
5. Her beautiful shell was broken into
many pieces, and as the poor tortoise lay
dying, she faintly cried, “ Ah, fool that
I was! I was formed to creep upon the
earth, and not to fly in the air. I have
had my wish, but it has cost me my life.”

2. “ A nice little girl is that,” said he,
“ But, oh ! how cold she must be, for see!
She hasn’t a single feather! ”
So each shivered to think of the other
poor thing,
Although it was sunshiny weather.

1. “No, I am not ugly! Look at my

When I sit among the leaves of the vines
I am very hard to find, for my skin is just
the colour of the leaves.
2. “Where did I come from? Well, I
was an egg at first. Now do not laugh,
for many living things besides birds come
from eggs.
3. “ There was no shell upon the egg
from which I was hatched. It was just
like a ball of jelly with a black dot in the
middle of it.
4. “ When I came from the egg, I


thought 1 was a fish. 1 could swim well,
and I caught and ate many small insects
in the water. Some boys, who took one
of my playmates away in a bottle of water,
said that he was a tadpole.
THE COMMON FROG.
5. “ I soon found that I was not a fish,
for two tiny legs grew close to my tail, and
then two more grew out of my chest.
6. “My tail became so short that it
could no longer be seen, and I learned to
hop upon the grass and hunt for small
flies.


7. “ Once some boys tried to' catch me,
but I dived to the bottom of the creek, and
stayed there till they went away. I do
not like boys who throw stones; bnt
perhaps they do not think that the stones
give us great pain even if they do not kill
us.
8. “My brother met with a very sad
end. He was sitting by me, and we were
talking about going for a long hop, when
a horrid snake caught him by the leg. He
began to scream, but the snake would not
let him go, and ate him up.
9. “I hopped away in a great fright till
I came to this house, and hid in the vines.
The snake came to look for me, but a man
hit him with a big stick and killed him.
10. “ I am going to keep this vine free
from grubs, and will catch the flies and
other insects which do harm. Good-bye!
Croak! Croak! it is going to rain.”
Though lessons may he hard to learn,
It does no good to cry ;
Bravely work and do your best,
And try, try, try.

So she took the baby, and rocked it

4. Then, stepping softly, she got the
broom,

room;
Busy and happy all day was she,
Helpful and bright as child could be.

2. “ Oh, no,” said the little mouse,
“ mother told me that I must keep away
from all cats, big and little.”
3. “ What a pity! ” cried the big cat,
who was called Tabby. “Why does your

such darling kittens as mine ? ”
4. “ Because,” said Mousie, “ she says
that you will kill and eat me.” “ That is
not true,” replied Tabby. “My children
just want to play witli you. Do come, and
I will show you the pantry, where the
cheese and pies are kept.”
5. Mousie thought that would be nice,
for she loved cheese very much. “ I will
go and ask mother,” she said.
6. “ There is not time to ask mother,”
said Tabby; “lam in a hurry to get back
to my children.”
7. Mousie knew well that her mother did
not wish her to go, but she kept thinking
of the fine cheese.
8. “ Come, my dear Mousie,” said Tabby
again, “ you are such a pretty mouse. I
never saw one as pretty as you before.”
9. This pleased the silly mouse very
much. So she said, “ I will go with you
for a little time.” And she went, though
her mother had told her not to go.

1. Well, Tabby brought the little mouse
to the room where her kittens were. They
were playing with a cotton reel.
2. One pussy would put her paw on the
reel, and it would roll away. -Then they
would all run after it, and the one that got
to it first won the game.
3. When Tabby saw what they were
playing at, she was pleased, and said,
“ You are good children. You are learning
your lessons well.
4. “ Now,” she said to them, “ I am
going to change the game a little bit—just
for fun, you know. Mousie here is to be
the reel, and when you touch her she runs.
Then whoever catches her first keeps her,”
5. The kittens said, “ Mew, mew.” So
Mousie ran, and they ran after her. She
was soon caught by Blackie,




6. “ Oh ! Oh !" died Mousie, “ yum- claws
hull me. Fdo not think that, tins is fun
at all.”
7. But Tabby said, “ I brought you here
to please the kittens, and they seem to like
it. You must just let them have their own
way.”
8. The cats played with her, and
scratched her, and at last they killed and
ate her. Poor Mousie ! why did she not
do what her mother told her?

LOSE by a cool and shady creek
An old duck made her nest
Of straw, and leaves, and withered
grass,
And down from her own breast.
2. And there she sat for four long weeks,
In rainy days and line,
Until the ducklings all came out —
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.


One peeped out from beneath her wing,
One scrambled on her back;
“ That’s very rude,” said old Dame Duck,
“ Get off! quack, quack, quack, quack !”
“ ’Tis close,” said Dame Duck, pushing
ouf~
The egg-shells with her bill;
“ Besides, it never suits young ducks
To keep them sitting still.”
So, rising from her nest, she said,
“_N_ow, children, look at me ;
A v dl-bred duck should waddle .so,
From side to side—you see!”
“ Yes,”-said the little ones, and then
She went m to explain—
“ A well-bred luck turns in its toes
As I do—try again.”

1. High above our heads we see the
Clouds, now white as wool, now dark and
angry, now shining like gold.
2. Rain is their eldest child. At times
he is mild and gentle, falling softly and
lightly on the parched ground, cooling the
dusty streets, and giving water to the
thirsty plants and flowers.
3. Then again he comes, flying before
the wind, beating against the panes and
clattering on the roofs. Sometimes he is
very wild and rude ; he fills the creeks and
rivers till they break over their banks,
cover the fields, and do much harm in their
rage.
4. Snow is Rain’s sister. She does not
often visit our sunnv land ; but, in manv


parts of the world, she spreads a soft, warm
blanket of white over the bare, brown earth,
and keeps the little seeds alive and snug
all the winter through. Boys and girls
love to play with her.
5. Hail is Snow’s brother. He is a
spoiled child, and works great mischief.
Broken windows, vines and fruit trees
robbed of their crops, and grain beaten to
the ground, show where he has been.
6. Dew is the baby of the family.
He steals forth by night, and sprinkles
diamonds on the flowers and grass. In
winter he sometimes bites and pinches,
and then we call him Frost.
7. Rain, Snow, Hail, and Dew are the
four' children of the Clouds. Old Ocean is
their grandfather, and they often visit him,
travelling in many ways.
8. After they have stayed for a time with
their grandfather, they ride merrily home
again upon the sunbeams.

Went flying through the sky ;
But, as they went, it grew so cold,
That both began to cry.

“ O, never mind, my dears,
I’ll send my little fairy folk
To dry your falling tears.”
3. One fairy came in violet,
And one wore indigo ;
In blue, green, yellow, orange, red,
They made a pretty row.
4. They wiped the cloud-tears all away.
And then from out the sky,
Upon a line the sunbeams made,
They hung their gowns to dry.
5. And when they saw dear Mother Earth,
They laughed with all their might,
And all the children shouted out —
“Oh, see the rainbow bright!”

1. Look at the first picture in this book.
How happy the children seem! Do you
know why they are so pleased ? It is
because they have just been placed in a
higher class, and have been given new
books to read.


2. Of course, books cannot be always
new. They are not only for show, or to
be kept on a shelf and rarely taken down.
They are given to us to be used.
3. But books, however much they may
be used, should show that they are taken
care of. Broken backs, torn leaves, soiled
covers, are signs of abuse, not of right
use.
4. Books are our friends, and we should
treat them as friends. As we grow older,
we shall find out, more and more, what
good and true friends they are. We
think it a shame to ill-treat a friend;
should we not also think it a shame to
ill-treat a book?
5. Our friends, the books, do so much
for us, that the half cannot be told here.
Boys and girls soon find out, however,
without being told, how much help and
pleasure are to be got from books.
6. Books tell us what the wisest men
and women have thought, and what the
best have done, in all parts of the world,
and at all times. In this way, books help
us to grow up wise and good men and
women.

this town last night. You were asleep.
I saw the lights in the houses go out one
by one.


2. Even the flowers were asleep. Only
the river was awake. I heard her talking

in this way because I am out of breath.
I have been running very fast.

My master is on his way home to see his

that baby as he does of me. I cannot
see why he should, for the baby could
not move a single car.
4. How do I work? I ought to tell you
that we have a giant who does most of
it for me. You cannot see him when he
is at work. We keep him locked in.
He is playing now.
5. Would you like to see him? There
he is, down between the wheels, whistling
and singing. Don’t stand very near him.
His breath is as hot as fire. He is a good


old giant. He is always ready to work
if you give him enough to eat.
6. His work is to push, push, push with
all his might. That helps me to turn my
wheels and pull my load. We carry his
food in the tender. I call it his lunch
basket.
7. I hear that we are growing old, and
that there is a new giant who can do our
work.
I hear, too, that he does not need any
tender, and that he lives in a wire over
the cars or in a rail beneath them.
8. Some of the stories about this new
giant seem very strange to me. I am
told that he can carry a message across
the sea faster than a bird can fly.
Perhaps this is quite true. Still, it is
not wise to believe all that one hears.

HE Blue Eyes had a secret to
keep—
They were only flowers you
know;
And their home was near by the
river-side,
Where the reeds and lilies
grow.
2. For Jenny Wren came one early morn,
And her voice was sweet as a bell:
“ Eve a nest just down by the old elm
tree,
But little Blue Eyes—don’t tell.”
3. And then she flew far away, away
Far over the sunlit hill;
And the Blue Eyes nodded their heads
and smiled,
“ We’ll guard it, of course we will.”


Now, just that morning, the miller’s
boys
Came down by the river-side ;
They were playing truant, and thought
the wood
Might be a good place to hide.

“ I’m sure there’s a nest just in by here,”
Said Tom, and they peered around ;
They broke the lilies, and climbed the
bank;
“ It’s here and it must be found.”


G. Then the Blue Eyes shivered. “ They’re
coming near,
Keep close and don’t let them see.”
And they stretched so high, and tried
to hide
The trunk of the old elm tree
7. And each little flower did her best
To guard it, and seemed to say —
“ Yes, boys, we know, but we cannot tell,
We promised—so go away.”
8. When the sun went down, all was quiet
and still,
Save the river murmuring by;
And the mother came singing home
again—
Ah! what is that faint low cry ?
9. One little Blue Eye had raised her head :
“ Your birdies are safe and well,
We’re bruised and broken, and nearly
dead,
But, Jenny, we didn’t tell.”

1. “I will not go to school/’ said little
Tommy ; “ I will stay in the bush and play
all day long.”
Just as he said this, he looked up into
a tree, and saw an old crow sitting there,
with a number of others.
2. “ Here’s a pretty fellow,” said the
crow; “he says he won’t go to school.;
here’s a pretty dunce!
“ What! you do not like work ? ” said
the crow again. “ 0 you idle boy, you are
worse than a bird ! I build my nest, what
do ;fou think of that ? ”
3. “ I dare say it is a very nice one,”
said Tommy, “ but I should not like to live
in it.”
“No, because you are only a boy, and
not so wise as a crow,” said his new friend.


4. " Do you know why a crow is wiser
than a hoy ? ” asked the crow.
" No,” said Tommy; “ I thought boys
were wiser than crows.”
5. “You thought!” said the crow; “a
great deal you know about it. Can you
build a house for yourself, pray ? ”
“No,” said Tommy, “but when I am a
man, I shall be able to build one.”
6. “ And why can’t you do it now ? ”
said the crow, turning his head to one
side, and looking at Tommy with one eye.
“ Why, I have not learnt,” said the
little boy.
7. “ Ho, ho! ” said the crow, flapping
his wings and hopping round and round,
“ he must learn to build a house! Here’s
a pretty boy! Here’s a wise boy I
8. “No one taught me to build my
house,” said the crow. “ I knew how to
do it at once, and a nice house it is; I
brought all the sticks it is made of myself.
I am not like a little boy I know;” and
the crow shook his head, and looked so


hard at the boy, that Tommy felt as if his
teacher was looking at him.
9. “ But there are other things in the
world besides houses,” said Tommy.
“ Yes, indeed,” said the crow, “ you
want clothes, as well as a house.”
“ That we do,” said Tommy, “ and new
ones very often ; but you birds can't wear
clothes.”
10. “ Who told you that ? ” said the
crow, in a very sharp tone. “Look at-my
coat, if you please, and tell me if you
ever saw a finer suit of black than mine.
Could you make yourself such a suit ? ”
“ No,” said Tommy, “ but I can learn.”
11. “Yes, yes, you can learn; but that
is the way with you silly boys. You have
everything to learn, and yet you are too
idle to set about it. Why, I have always
had this black suit. It is true, when first
I came out of my shell, my coat was only
of yellow down ; but I grew these black
feathers at once, and I have always been
well dressed since.”

1. Tommy felt that the crow had the
best of it. “ Dear me,” he said to himself,
“ I never thought crows were so wise
and clever.”
2. “ There is more for you to learn
yet,” said the crow. “ How about your
food, Master Tom ? Who gives you food ? ”
■>
“ Why, mother does,” said Tommy.
“You are a baby, then?
“ No, indeed, I am not,” said Tommy;
“ and I will throw a stone at you if you
call me one.”
3. “ Boys should never throw stones,”
said the crow. “We never throw stones.
I only asked if you were a baby, because
when a crow can go alone he finds his
own food.”
“ I shall do that when I am grown
up,” said Tommy. “ I shall learn how.”


4. “ Dear me,” said the crow, “ you
have a great deal to learn before you can
be as wise as a crow.”
“ That is true,” said Tommy, hanging
his head ; “ but there is plenty of time.”
5. “ I am not sure of that,” said the
crow. “ You are as big as twenty crows,
and yet you are not as wise as one. A
pretty fellow to come and lie on the grass
all day, when you are such a dunce! Go
to school! go to school! go to school! ”
6. All the crows took up the cry, and
made such a noise, that Tommy picked up
his books to throw at them: but they flew
up to the highest tree, and cried, “ Caw,
caw, caw,” till Tommy could bear it no
longer, but ran off to school as hard as
he could.
7. As he passed by the tree on his way
home, the old crow was sitting there, but
he did not look at Tommy. “ Come, come,”
said Tommy, “ do not be cross, old friend ! ”
But the crow looked as if he had never
said a word in his life, and had never seen
Tommy before.
8. So the little boy went home, and


“he ran OFF to SCHOOL AS HARD AS HE COULD.”.
told his mother about the talk with the
crow; but she said that crows did not talk,


and that he must have fallen asleep and
dreamt it.
9. But Tommy does not think so; and
now, when he feels lazy, he always says
to himself, “ Come, come, Master Tommy,
you must work hard; for you are not yet
as wise as an old black crow.”

1. In a field of young, green wheat a
lark had made her nest. In this nest
were four little baby larks. The mother
had to fly away every day to get them
food.
2. As the days passed, her little ones
grew larger and stronger, while all round
them the wheat grew tall and began to get
ripe.


3. Time went on, and the mother lark
was afraid that men would come and cut
the wheat; but she hoped they would not
do so till her babies could fly and take
care of themselves.
4. Every morning before she left the
nest, she would say to her little ones, “If
any people come here while lam away,
Irv to hear all thev sav> and tell me
when I come back.”
5. One day two men came to the field,
and the little larks heard one say to the
other, “ 1 think this wheat is ripe; go
now, my son, and ask our friends to come
to-morrow and help us to cut it.”


6. The little birds were in great fear.
They could hardly wait for their mother
to come home. When she got back to
her nest, they at once told her what they
had heard.
7. “ There is no need to move just now,
my children,” said the mother; “we are
quite safe here. If the man waits for his
friends to help him, the corn will not be
cut yet. But listen when he comes again,
and tell me what he says.”

1. The next morning the farmer and his
son came again to the field, but no friends
were there to help him.
2. After waiting for some time, the
farmer said to his son, “As our friends
have not come, go and ask your uncles
and cousins to come and help us, for our
wheat is ready.”


3. This the little birds heard, and told to
the old one when she came home.
“We mnst move at once!” said the
jmung larks, “or the men will come and
kill us.”
4, “Do not fear,” said the mother, “we
need not move yet. The man who waits
for others to help him to do his work is not
to be feared. But watch and listen when
he comes again, and tell me all he says.”
5. Next day the farmer came once more,
but there were still no helpers. Then he
said to his son, “My son, I see we shall
have to cut the corn ourselves. So you
and I will come at dawn of day and begin
work. We will trust to no one else.”
6. When the birds told this to their
mother, she said, “ Ah! now we must be
off! The farmer no longer trusts others
to do his work, but means to do it himself.
It is sure to be done now.”
7. By this time the little larks could
fly; so the next day, when it was very
early, they all left their nest and flew
away to a new home.

I almost can tell what they’re saying.

The long grass wave, when the breezes

I’m just as glad, as glad can be,
And the flowers are glad, too, it seems

I. On the King’s Birthday and other

our school grounds the Union Jack, the
flag of that Empire “on which the sun
never sets.”
2. This flag of the British people is
sometimes spoken of as “ the red, white,
and blue ” because it is made up of these
three colours.
3. It is formed of three flags —the flag
of England, the flag of Scotland, and the
flag of Ireland. Because these three flags


are made into one flag, it is called the
Union Jack. The word “Union” means
a making into one.
4. The English flag is white, with the
red cross of Saint George on it like
this, The Scottish flag is blue, showing
the white cross of Saint Andrew, from
corner to corner of the flag, like this, X
5. When Scotland joined England, about
two hundred years ago, these two flags
were made into one, the cross of Saint
Andrew being united with that of Saint
George.
6. Nearly a hundred years after this,
Ireland came into the Union, and its flag
was added to the Jack. The Irish flag is
white, with the red cross of Saint Patrick
from corner to corner, like the cross of
Saint Andrew.
St. George. St. Patrick. St. Andrew.
7. In the Union Jack, the great upright
red cross of Saint George is seen in the
centre, from top to bottom, and from side


to side, on a white ground. The red cross
of Saint Patrick runs from corner to
corner on a white ground. The white
cross of Saint Andrew is seen on a blue
ground, which forms the field or ground
of the whole flag.
8. In all times the flag of a country
has been dear to the people of that
country; they have fought for it, and
died for it. The flag of a country stands
for the country itself, and those who
insult the flag insult the people.
9. Boys and girls in our sunny land,
no less than those in other parts of the
Empire, should love and honour the
Empire’s flag, and be ever ready to
defend it

H LITTLE song for bedtime, when,
robed in gowns of white,
All sleepy little children set sail
across the night,
For that pleasant, pleasant country
where the pretty dream flowers blow
’Twixt the sunset and the sunrise—
For the Slumber Islands, Ho!

heavy lids droop down
To hide blue eyes and black eyes, grey
eyes and eyes of brown,
A thousand boats for Dreamland are
waiting in a row,
And the ferrymen are calling—
For the Slumber Islands, Ho!


3. Then the sleepy little children fill the
boats along the shore,
And go sailing off to Dreamland, and
the dipping of the oar
In the sea of sleep makes music that
the children only know
When they answer to the boatmen’s

1. In a former lesson we were told about
the Union Jack, the flag of the great
Empire to which we are proud to belong.
In the present lesson we shall learn about
another flag —that of the country in which
we dwell.
2. It is only since the year 1901 that
Australia has had a flag of its own. Here


is its picture
3. This flag is blue; and in its upper
left-hand corner is a Union Jack, to show
that Australia is part of the British
Empire.
4. In the lower left-hand corner is a
large star with six points. This star
is meant to show that the six States
of Australia are united—that is, joined
together, so as -to form one country.
5. The five apaaller stars on the flag are
in the shape of the Southern Cross. On
most fine nights there can be seen in the
sky the well-known group of stars called
bv this name.


6. “ Three crosses in the Union.
Three crosses in the Jack,
WeTl add to it now the Cross of
the South,
And stand by it, back to back.”
7. Queensland, the State in which we
live, was so named in honour of our good
Queen Victoria, who died in 1901, after
she had been on the throne for nearly
sixty-four years.
8. The flag of Queensland, as a single
State, is here shown; and we see that,
like the Australian flag, it has the Union
Jack in the upper left-hand corner, while
in the lower right-hand corner is a Maltese
Cross with the Queen’s Crown at its centre.

1. There was once a widow with two

was pretty and fond of work; but the
other, who was called Netta, was not only
ugly but also very lazy.


2. As Netta was her own child, the
widow treated her very kindly, while
Thora, who was a step-child, had to do
all the hard work of the house. She was
always kept busy, and at times she had
to spin so long that her fingers bled.
3. One day, as Thora knelt at a well
by the way-side to wash the blood from
her spindle, it slipped out of her hands,
and fell into the water.
4. She ran crying to her step-mother,
who was very angry and said: “As you
have been so careless, you must go at once
and get your spindle out! ”
5. Thora went back, not knowing what
to do. At last, in her fear of being
scolded again, she jumped into the well.
6. She woke up in a lovely meadow,
with the sun shining brightly upon the
crowds of flowers growing around.
7. After walking, on and on, through
the meadow, she came at last to an oven.
Voices from the oven cried, “ Take us out!
Take us out, or we shall burn! We have
been baked long enough! ”
Thora at once opened the oven, and


drew out loaf after loaf until it was
empty.
8. Farther on, she saw a tree with its
branches bending under a load of apples;
and the tree cried, “ Shake me! Shake
me ! My apples are all ripe! ”
So Thora shook the tree, and the apples
fell by hundreds, till there were no more
left to fall. Then she gathered them in
a heap, and went on.
9. At last she came to a small house.
At the door stood an old woman with two
such big front teeth that Thora was afraid
when she saw her.
10. But the old woman called out, very
gently, “ What are you afraid of, my
child? Stay with me, and, if you do my
work properly, you will have a nice home
here. But you must be careful to make
my bed well, and shake it so hardens to
make the feathers fly. Then, in the
world, people will say, ‘lt snows! ’ for I
am Mother Hulda* ! ”
11. Because the old woman spoke to
her so kindly, the girl took heart, and was
glad to enter her service.
* In parts of Germany when it snows, people say, ‘ ‘ Mother Hulda
is making her bed. ’ ’

1. Thora did everything just as Mother
Hulda wished, and shook her bed until the
feathers flew about like snow-flakes.
2. Her life was now a happy one.
Instead of cross looks there were kind
words, as well as plenty of nice things to
eat every day.
3. But, after a time, she grew sad and
begun to long for home; and one dav

she said to her mistress, “ Though I like
this place very much, I feel that I cannot
stay any longer; I must go back to my
own people.”
4. Mother Hulda replied, “ I am glad
that you do not forget your home. I
thought that vou would wish to return.
As you have served me so well, I shall see
that you get back safely.”
5. She took Thora by the hand, and
led her to a great gateway. The gate

opened, and, as tlie girl passed through,
there fell upon her a shower of gold,


which hung on her clothes so that she was
covered with gold from head to foot.
6. “ You shall have all this, because
you have worked so hard,” said Mother
Hulda, giving her at the same time the
spindle which had dropped into the well.
7. All at once the gate was shut with
a bang, and Thora found herself again in
the world, not far from her own home.
8. As she came into the yard the
cock stood on the wall and crowed-
“ Cock-a-doodle-doo
Our golden girl has come home too,”
9. So she went on into the house, and
told her story: and, because she had
brought so much gold with her. she was
kindly received.

DREAMT I lived in Dolly-Land,
Where all around were toys,
And such a lot of little girls,
But hardly any boys.
2. I thought the toys were made of gold,
So lovely did they seem,
But O! how very sad I was
To find it all a dream.
3. I thought I saw a pretty house,
That reached up to the sky,
Just packed quite full of wonders,
From floor to roof on high.
4. I walked into this pretty house,
All by myself—alone,
And in my dream, it seemed to me.
To be my very own.
5. Then in came crowds of little girls,
Who chose me for their queen,
Decked me with rings and jewels rare,
And fairy robes of green.

I. When her step-mother heard the
wonderful story that Thora told, she
wished her own child to have the same
good fortune.
2. So she made Netta sit by the well
with her spindle. Now, Netta was too
lazy to spin; so, in order to stain her
spindle, she scratched her hand in a thorn
bush. Then she threw the spindle into
the well, and jumped in after it.
3. Like Thora, she came to the lovely
meadow, and walked along the same path.
But when she reached the oven, and heard
the voices calling, “Take us out! Take

us out, or we shall burn!” the lazy girl
replied, “ I don't want to dirty my hands
thank von!” and went on.


4. Soon she came to the apple tree,
which cried out as before, “ Shake me!
Shake me! My apples are ripe! ” but
she only said, “ That is all very fine!
Suppose that one of you should fall on my
head! ” and went on her way.
5. When she came to Mother Hulda
and saw her big teeth, she was not afraid,
for she had been told all about them; and
like her sister, Thora, she was engaged by
the old woman.
6. On the first day she worked well,
for she thought of the gold that was to be
her reward. But, on the second day, she
began to be idle ; and, on the third day,
she was still worse, and refused to get up
early; nor did she shake Mother Hulda’s
bed so as to make the feathers fly.
7. “ This girl is no good to me! ” said
Mother Hulda. “ I must send her home! ”
This was just what the lazy girl wanted.
“Now it’s time for the shower of gold!”
thought she.
8. Her mistress led her to the gate;
but as she passed through, instead of the
shower of gold, a great kettle of pitch was
poured over her.


“ That is your reward! ” said Mother
Hulda, as the gate closed.
9. So lazy Xetta came home covered
with pitch, and the cock on the wall
crowed—
“ Cock-a-doodle-doo!!
Our dirty girl has come home too! ’
10. The pitch would not wash off, and
it stuck to her as long as she lived.

Sailed on a river of misty light

The old moon asked the three.

We have come to fish for the herring-

Said Wynken,

The old moon laughed and sang a song,

And the wind that sped them all night

Ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring-fish,
That lived in the beautiful sea.
Now cast your nets wherever you wish,

All night long their nets they threw
