FORM OF SERVICE.
PSALM 100.
ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
Him serve with mirth. His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
Know that the Lord is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make :
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
O enter then His gates with praise.
Approach with joy His courts unto :
Praise, laud, and bless His name always.
For it is seemly so to do.
For why ? the Lord our God is good.
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure. Amen.


Then shall the Chaplain say: —
S~\ come, let us worship and bow down; let
V/ us kneel before the Lord, our Maker:
For He is our God, and we are the people of
His pasture, and the flock of His hand. To-
day, oh that ye would hear His voice I”
Ps. xcv, 6, 7 (in Rev. Vers.)
rp O the Lord our God belong mercies and
I forgiveness, though we have rebelled
against Him : Neither have we obeyed the voice
of the Lord our God, to walk in His laws
which He set before us.”
Dan. ix., 9, 10.
“ "CENTER not into judgment with thy ser-
X-J vants, O Lord; for in Thy sight shall
no man living be justified.”
Ps. cxliii., 2.
Let us Pray.
A GENERAL CONFESSION TO BE SAID BY ALL.
ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father:
We have erred and strayed from Thy
ways like lost sheep. We have followed too
much the devices and desires of our own hearts.
We have offended against Thy holy laws. W#


have left undone those things which we ought
to have done; And we have done those things
which we ought not to have done; And there
is no health in us. But Thou, O Lord, have
mercy upon us, miserable offenders. Spare
Thou them, O God, which confess their faults.
Restore Thou them that are penitent; Accord-
ing to Thy promises declared unto mankind in
Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most
merciful Father, for His sake; That we may
hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,
to the glory of Thy holy Name. Amen.
Prayer to be said by Chaplain only.
ALMIGHTY and merciful God, the Foun-
tain of all goodness, Who knowest the
thoughts of our hearts, we confess unto Thee
that we have sinned against Thee, and done
evil in Thy sight. Absolve us, we beseech
Thee, from the stains of our past sins, and give
us grace and power to put away all hurtful
things, so that, being delivered from the
bondage of sin, we may bring forth worthy
fruits of repentance. O Eternal Light, shine
into our hearts. O Eternal Goodness, deliver
us from evil. O Eternal Power, be Thou our
support. Eternal Wisdom, scatter the dark-
ness of our ignorance. Eternal Pity, have
mercy upon us. Grant unto us, that, with all
our hearts, and minds, and strength, we may
evermore seek Thy face : and, finally, bring us.


in Thine infinite mercy, to Thy holy presence.
So strengthen our weakness, that, following in
the footsteps of Thy blessed Son, we may ob-
tain Thy mercy, and enter into Thy promised
peace; through the same Jesus Christ, our only
Saviour and Redeemer, Amen.
ALMIGHTY God, the Father of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, who desirest not the death
of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from
his wickedness and live; and who pardonest
and absolvest all them that truly repent and
unfeignedly believe Thy holy gospel ; grant us,
we beseech Thee, true repentance and Thy
Holy Spirit; that those things may please Thee
which we do at this present; and that the rest
of our life, hereafter, may be pure and holy :
so that, at the last, we may come to Thy
Eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
A men.
Then shall all say the Lord’s Prayer.
OUR FATHER, which art in Heaven ; Hal-
lowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven.
Give ns this day our daily bread. And forgive
us our trespasses, as we forgive them that
trespass against us. And lead us npt into
temptation, but deliver us from evil. For
Thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.

Thou art the everlasting Son : of the Father.
When Thou tookest upon Thee to deliver man :
Thou didst not abhor the Virgin’s womb.
When Thou hadst overcome the sharpness of
death : Thou didst open the Kingdom of
Heaven to all believers.


Thou sittest at the right hand of God : In the
Glory of the Father.
.We believe that Thou shalt come : to be our
• Judge.

trust is in Thee.
O Lord, in Thee have I trusted : let me never
be confounded.
Then may be said the Apostles’ Creed by the
Chaplain and People.
I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth :
And in Jesus Christ His only Son Our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born
of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius


Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried, He de-
scended into Hell; The third day He rose again
from the dead, He ascended into Heaven, and
sitteth on the right hand of God the Father
Almighty; From thence He shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy
Catholick Church; the Communion of Saints;

HYMNS.


HYMNS.
ADORATION AND WORSHIP.
Morning Service.
(Tune, “ Dresden.”)
“I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go
into the house of the Lord.”
AGAIN the morn of gladness.
The morn of light, is here,
And earth itself looks fairer.
And heaven itself more near :
The bells, like angel voices,
Speak peace to every breast;
And all the land lies quiet
To keep the day of rest.
“ Glory be to Jesus!”
Let all His people say;
He rose again, He rose again,
On this glad day!
2 Again, O loving Saviour,
The children of Thy grace
Prepare themselves to seek Thee
Within Thy chosen place.
Our song shall rise to greet Thee.
If Thou our hearts wilt raise;
If Thou our lips wilt open,
Our mouths shall show Thy praise.


3 The shining choir of angels
That rest not day or night,
The crowned and palm-decked martyrs.
The saints arrayed in white,
The happy flock of Jesus
In pastures fair above, —
These all adore and praise Him
Whom we too praise and love.
4 The Church on earth rejoices
To join with these to-day;
In every tongue and nation
She calls her sons to pray;
Across the Northern Snow-fields,
Beneath the Indian palms,
She makes the same pure offering,
And sings the same sweet psalms.
5 Tell out, sweet bells, His praises 1
Glad-hearted, sing His name !
Still louder and still further
His mighty deeds proclaim,
Till all whom He redeemed
Shall own Him Lord and King
Till every knee shall worship.
And every tongue shall sing.
“ Glory be to Jesus!"
Let all creation soy;
He rose again. He rose again.
On this glad day! Amen.


(Tune, “ St, George.”)
“ The first day of the week.”
rp His is the day of light :
_l Let there be light to-day;
O Dayspring, rise upon our night.
And chase its gloom away.
2 This is the day of rest:
Our failing strength renew;
On weary brain and troubled breast
Shed Thou Thy freshening dew.
3 This is the day of peace;
Thy peace our spirits fill;
Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease,
The waves of strife be still.
4 This is the day of prayer;
Let earth to heaven draw near;
Lift up our hearts to seek Thee there.
Come down to meet us here.
5 This is the first of days :
Send forth Thy quickening breath,
And wake dead souls to love and praise,
O Vanquisher of death ! Amen.
(Note. — The tunes indicated are those com-
monly used, as found in the hymnaries of the
Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Congre-
gational, and Baptist Churches. The Chap-
lain will, of course, select the tunes found most
fitting.)


(Tune, “ Hanover.”)
••Bless the Lord , omy soul. 0 Lord my
Clod. Thou art very yreat; ±hou art
clothed with honour and majesty.
O WORSHIP the King
All glorious above,
O gratefully sing
His power and His love,
Our Shield and Defender,
The Ancient of days.
Pavilioned in splendour.
And girded with praise 1
2 O tell of His might,
O sing of His .grace,
Whose robe is the light,
Whose canopy space.
His chariots of wrath
The deep thunder-clouds form
And dark is His path
On the wings, of the storm.
3 This earth with its store
Of wonders untold
Almighty, Thy power
Hath founded of old.
Hath ’stablished it fast
By a changeless decree,
And round it hath cast,
Like a mantle, the sea.


4 Thy bountiful care
What tongue can recite T
It breathes in the air;
It shines in the light;
It streams from the hills;
It descends to the plain;
And sweetly distils
In the dew and the rain.
5 Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail,
In Thee do we trust.
Nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies how tender.
How firm to the end !
Our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend ! Amen,
(Tune, “ St. Peter’s, Westminster.”)
“ Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not
all His benefits.”
PRAISE, my soul, the King of Heaven,
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Who like me His praise should sing.
Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise the everlasting King.


2 Praise Him for His grace and favour.
To our fathers in distress;
Praise Him still the same for ever.
Slow to chide, and swift to bless;
Praise Him, praise Him,
Glorious in His faithfulness.
3 Father-like, He tends and spares us.
Well our feeble frame He knows;
In His hands He gently bears us.
Rescues us from all our foes;
Praise Him, praise Him,
Widely as His mercy flows.
4 Frail as summer’s flower we floftrish,
Blows the wind and it is gone ;
But, while mortals rise and perish,
God endures unchanging on:
Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise the high Eternal One. Amen.
(Tune, “ Intercession.”)
‘ Hear Thou in heaven , Thu dwelling-place."
WHEN the weary, seeking rest,
To Thy goodness flee;
When the heavy-laden cast
All their load on Time;


When the troubled, seeking peace.
On Thy name shall call;
When the sinner, seeking life,
At Thy feet shall fall;
Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry.
In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.
When the worldling, sick at heart,
Lifts his soul above;
When the prodigal looks back
To his Father’s love;
When the proud man from his pride
Stoops to seek Thy face;
When the burdened brings his guilt
To Thy throne of grace;
Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry.
In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.
When the stranger asks a home,
All his toils to end;
When the hungry craveth food,
And the poor a friend;
When the sailor on the wave
Bows the fervent knee;
When the soldier on the field
Lifts his heart to Thee;
Hear, then in love, O Lord, the cry.
In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.


4 When the child, with grave fresh lip,
Youth, or maiden fair;
When the aged, weak and grey.
Seek Thy face in prayer;
When the widow weeps to Thee,
Sad and lone and low;
When the orphan brings to Thee
All his orphan woe;
Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry,
In heaven. Thy dwelling-nlace on high.
Amen.
(Tune, “ Shropshire.”)
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the
earth."
OGOD of love, O King of peace,
Make wars throughout the world to
cease;
The wrath of sinful man restrain;
Give peace, O God, give peace again.
2 Remember, Lord, Thy works of old,
The wonders that our fathers told;
Remember not our sin’s dark stain;
Give peace, O God, give peace again.
3 Whom shall we trust but Thee, O Lord?
Where rest but on Thy faithful word ?
None ever called on Thee in vain;
Give peace, O God, give peace again.


Where Saints and Angels dwell above,
All hearts are knit in holy love;
Oh, bind us in that heavenly chain;
Give peace, O God, give peace again. Amen.
(Tune 195, A. & M.)
OLORD our Banner, God of Might,
Who wast with Joshua in the fight,
And Moses on the hill,
Be with Thy servants far away,
Their shield by night, their guide by day.
To succour them from ill.
For husband, brother, son and sire,
We raise up hands that never tire
On this our mount of prayer;
Thou knowest, but we dimly guess,
The day’s long toil, the night’s distress,
And all they do and bear.
The battle’s issue hangs on Thee;
In Thy firm hand the scales we see
Of mortal loss and gain ;
And tidings carried swift as thought
’Twixt land and land to Thee are nought
But thine own will made plain.


Giver of strength, O bless and aid
Thy servants ’gainst the foe arrayed
Go forth with them to fight!
In battle’s storm their shelter be.
Thy spirit grant, of unity,
Of counsel, and of might.
Watch o’er the wounded in the field.
Am’, where the sick and dying yield
Their souls, do thou be nigh !
Give peace within the heart distressed,
And peace on earth, and, last and best,
Thy peace beyond the sky. Amen,
(Tune, “ St. Anne.”)
“ Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from
one generation to another
OGOD, our help in ages past,
Our Hope for years to come,
Our Shelter from the stormy blast.
And our eternal Home;
Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy Saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone.
And our defence is sure.


Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
O God, our Help in ages past.
Our Hope for years to come.
Be Thou our Guard while troubles last.
And our eternal Home. Amen.
CHRISTIAN FAITH, STRUGGLE, AND
VICTORY.
(Tune, “ Hollingside.”)
JESUS, Lover of ray soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the gathering waters roll.
While the tempest still is high.
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past :
Safe into the haven guide.
Oh, receive my sou! at last.


2 Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave—ah ! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed.
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
3 Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound,
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart;
Rise to all eternity. Amen.
(Tune, “ Petra.”)
T> OCK of ages, cleft for me,
I V Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double eurej
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
Not the labours of ray hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite know.
Could my tears for ever flow.
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.


8 Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the Fountain fly—
Wash me. Saviour, or I die !
4 While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death.
When I soar to tracts unknown.
See Thee on Thy judgment-throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me.
Let me hide myself in Thee ! Amen.
the good fight with all thy might.
Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy
right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.
2 Run the straight race through God’s goor*
grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek Ilis face;
Life with its path before us lies,
Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.
3 Cast care aside; upon thy Guide
Lean, and His mercy will provide;
Lean, and the trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.


4 Faint not, nor fear, His arm is near,
He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee. Amen.
AUSTRALIA’S BATTLE HYMN*
(Tune, “Australia.”)
GOD, that made our fathers strong,
Lead us when the dangers throng:
God, that made our mothers pure,
Make us steadfast to endure!
On the wave or tented field,
Be our sword and battle-shield!
Hail, our Empire spreading far,
Great in peace as dread in war!
Banner brave, as in the past
Float on fort and tower and mast:
Let thy blazon flutter free.
South and north, on every sea!
Here thy sons shall guhrd the gates
Of thy southward shores and straits;
On wide ocean we shall meet
One unsundered flag and fleet,
And the pathway of the sea
Prove our broadening destiny.

Oh, for peace or battle-fray
Nelson’s signal points the way;
Duty’s claim and country’s call
Shall be conscience for us all!
Set that signal high, and then
Forward ! Quit yourselves like men !
REFRAIN.
God, that watehest through the day.
Guard each seaward coast and bay!
God, in love’s unsleeping might,
Keep our homes through darkest night!
“ I will go before thee, and make the crooked
places straight: I will break in pieces the
gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars
. i „
lIFT up your heads, ye gates of brass,
J Ye bars of iron, yield,
And let the King of Glory pass;
The cross is in the field.
2 That banner, brighter than the star
That leads the train of night.
Shines on their march, and guides from far
His servants to the fight.
3 Ye armies of the living God,
His sacramental host,
Where hallowed footstep never trod.
Take your appointed post.


4 Follow the cross; the ark of peace
Accompany yonr path.
To slaves and rebels bring release
From bondage and from wrath.
5 Though few and small and weak your bands,
'Strong in your Captain’s strength,
Go to the conquest of all lands;
All must be His at length.
6 O fear not, faint not, halt not now-
Quit you like men, be strong;
To Christ shall every nation bow.
And sing with you this song :
7 “Uplifted are the gates of brass;
The bars of iron yield;
Behold the King of Glory pass !
The cross hath won the field.” Amen.
(Tune, “ University College ” (Gauntlett) or
“ Clarion ” (Eimbault).)
“Fight the good fight of faith.”
MUCH in sorrow, oft in woe.
Onward, Christians, onward go !
Fight the fight, though worn with strife,
Strengthened with the bread of life.


2 Onward, Christians, onward go,
Join the war, and face the foe;
Faint not! much doth yet remain.
Dreary is the long campaign.
3 Shrink not, Christians ! will ye yield ?
Will ye quit the painful field ?
Will ye flee in danger’s hour?
Know ye not your Captain’s power ?
4 Let your drooping hearts be glad;
March, in heavenly armour clad;
Fight, nor think the battle long,
Victory soon shall tune your song.
B Let not sorrow dim your eye.
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not fears your course impede,
Great your strength, if great your need
6 Onward then to battle move;
More than conquerors ye shall prove;
Though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go ! Amen,
(Tune, “ Vigilate.”)
“ Watch and pray.”
“ /CHRISTIAN ! seek not yet repose,”
Cast thy dreams of ease away;
Thou art in the midst of foes;
“Watch and pray.”


2 Principalities and powers,
Mustering their unseen array.
Wait for thy unguarded hours :
“Watch and pray."
3 Gird thy heavenly armour on,
Wear it ever night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one;
“ Watch and pray.”
4 Hear the victors who o’ereame;
Still they mark each warrior’s way)
All with one sweet voice exclaim,
“Watch and pray.”
5 Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His Word,
“ Watch and pray.”
6 Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray, that help may be sent down :
“Watch and pray.” Amen,
“ A good soldier of Jesus Christ,”
STAND up !—stand up for Jesus
Ye soldiers of the Cross;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss.


From victory unto victory
His army He shall lead,
Till every foe is vanquished,
And Christ is Lord indeed.
Stand up ! —stand up for Jesus !
The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes;
Your courage rise with danger
And strength to strength oppose,
Stand up ! —stand up for Jesus !
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you.
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armour,
Each piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls or danger.
Be never wanting there.
Stand up !—stand up for Jesus !
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s song.
To him that overcometh,
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of Glorv
Shall reign eternally. Amen.

“ My heart and my flesh crieth out for the
living Ood.”
NEARER, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee;
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song would be—
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
2 Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me—
,>■ . My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
3 There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven,
All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
4 Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praiaa.
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee,


5 Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly.
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee. Amen.
(Tune, “ St. Gertrude.”)
“Be strong and of a good courage . . . and
the Lord, He it is that doth go before
thee.”
ONWARD ! Christian soldiers.
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ, the Royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See ! His banners go.
OmcardJ Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war.
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
2 At the sign of triumph
Satan’s legions flee;
On then, Christian soldiers.
On to victory !


Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.
3 Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod.
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.
4 Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise.
And that cannot fail.
5 Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blond with ours your voices
In the triumph song,
“ Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King!”
This through countless"ages
Men and Angels sing. Amen,


“ All hail the power of Jesu’s name / ”■
ALL hail the power of Jesu’s name !
Let Angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem
To crown him Lord of all.
2 Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,
Who from His Altar call;
Extol Him in Whose path ye trod.
And crown Him Lord of all.
3 Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,
Ye ransomed of the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.
4 Sinners ! whose love can ne’er forget
The wormwood and the gall;
Go ! spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.
5 Let every tongue and every tribe
Responsive to the call,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.
6 O that, with yonder sacred throng.
We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all! Amen.


(Tune, “ Morning Light ” or “ St. Theodolph.*’)
“In His days shall the righteous flourish;
and abundance of peace so long at the
moon endureth.”
HAIL to the Lord’s Anointed,
Great David’s greater Son I
Hail, in the time appointed.
His reign on earth begun !
He comes to break oppression.
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression
And rule in equity.
2 He comes with succour speedy
To those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy.
And bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for sighing,
Their darkness turn to light.
Whose souls, condemned and dying.
Were precious in His sight.
3 He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth;
And love, joy, hope, like flowers.
Spring in His path to birth;
Before Him, on the mountains,
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains.
From hill to valley flow.


4 O’er every foe victorious.
He on His throne shall rest,
From age to age more glorious,
All-blessing and all-blest;
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His name shall stand for ever,
That name to us is—Love. Amen
FOR THOSE AT SEA.
(Tune, “ Melita.”)
ETERNAL Father ! strong to save,
Whose arm hath Bound the resheis
wave,
Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep;
Oh, hear us when wo cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
2 O Christ, Whose voice the waters heard
And hush’d their raging at Thy word,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep.
And calm amid the storm didst sleep :
Oh, hear ns when wo cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.


3 O Holy Spirit! Who didst brood
Upon the waters dark and rude,
And bid their angry tumult cease.
And give, for wild confusion, peace;
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
4 O Trinity of love and power I
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe.
Protect them wheresoe’er they go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
Amen.
FOR EVENING SERVICE.
(Tune, “ Lux Benigna.”)
“ I am the light of the world: he that followeth
Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall
have the light of life.'”
LEAD, kindly light, amid the encircling
gloom
Lead Thou me on;
The night is dark, and I am far from home;
Lead Thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.


2 I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Shouldst lead me on;
I loved to choose and see my path; but now
Lead Thou me on.
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears.
Pride ruled my will: remember not past
years.
3 So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone,
And with the morn those Angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost
awhile. Amen.
(Tune, “ St. Oswald, Durham.”)
“ One hope of your calling.”
T THROUGH the night of doubt and sorrow
Onward goes the victor band,
Singing songs of expectation.
Marching to the Promised Land.


2 Clear before us, through the darkness,
Gleams and burns the guiding light;
Brother clasps the hand of brother,
Stepping fearless through the night.
3 One the light of God’s own presence,
O’er His ransomed people shed,
Chasing far the gloom and terror,
Brightening all the path we tread;
4 One the object of our journey,
One the faith which never tires;
One the earnest looking forward,
One the hope our God inspires;
5 One the strain that lips of thousands
Lift as from the heart of one;
One the conflict, one the peril,
One the march in God begun;
6 One the gladness of rejoicing
On the far eternal shore.
Where the one almighty Father
Eeigns in love for evermore.
7 Soon shall come the glad awaking,
Then the rending of the tomb,
Then the scattering of all shadows
And the end of toil and gloom. Amen.


(Tune, “Hursley,” or “Abends.”)
“ The Lord God is a sun and shield .”
OUN of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
kJ It is not night if Thou be near :
O may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant’s eyes.
2 When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour’s breast.
3 Abide with me from morn till eve.
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh.
For without Thee I dare not die.
4 If some poor wand Ting child of Thine
Have spurn’d to-day the voice Divine,
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
Let him no more lie down in sin.
5 Watch by the sick; enrich the poor
With blessings from Thy boundless store;
Be every mourner’s sleep to-night
Like infant’s slumbers, pure and light.
6 Come near and bless us when we wake.
Ere through the world our way we take;
Till in the ocean of Thy love
We lose ourselves in Heav’n above. Amen


25
“ Abide with us; for it is toward evening,
and the day is Jar spent ”
ABIDE with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me
abide;
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee.
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Chknge and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, Who changest not, abide with me.
3 Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy
wings,
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.
4 Thou on my head in early youth didst smile;
And, though rebellious and perverse mean*
while,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee :
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.
5 I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s
power ?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide
with me.


6 I fear no foe with Thee at Hand to bless;
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness;
Where is death’s sting? Where, Grave, thy
victory ?
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.
7 Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the
skies;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain
shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with mo.
Amen.
(Tune, "Stella.”)
" The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting
light.”
O SAVIOUR, bless us ere we go;
Thy Word into our minds instil.
And make our lukewarm hearts to glow
With lowly love and fervent will.
Through life's long day and death’s dark
night,
0 gentle Jesus, be our light l


2 The day is done, its hours have run.
And Thou hast taken count of all,
The scanty triumphs grace hath won,
The broken vow, the frequent fall.
3 Grant us, dear Lord, from evil ways
True absolution and release;
And bless us, more than in past days.
With purity and inward peace.
4 For all we love, the poor, the sad.
The sinful, unto Thee we call;
O Ut Thy mercy make us glad;
Thou art our Jesus, and our All. Amen.
(Tune, “ Ellers,” or “ Benediction,” or
“Pax Dei.”)
“My peace I give unto you.”
SAVIOUR, again, to Thy dear name we
raise
With one accord our parting hymn of praise;
We stand to bless Thee £re our worship cease.
Then, lowly kneeling, wait Thy word of peace.
2 Grant us Thy peace through this approaching
night;
Turn Thou for us its darkness into light;
From harm and danger keep Thy children
free;
For dark and light are both alike to Thee.


8 Grant us Thy peace upon our homeward way;
With Thee began, with Thee shall end the
day;
Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts
from shame.
That in this place have called upon Thy
name.
4 Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly
life,
Our balm in sorrow, and our stay in strife;
Then, when Thy voice shall bid our conflict
cease.
Call us, 0 Lord, to Thine eternal peace.
Amen.
HYMN OF FAREWELL.

AT THE FUNERAL SERVICE FOR A
DEAD COMRADE.
(Tune, “ Requiescat.”)
NOW the labourer’s task is o’er.
Now the battle-day is past,;
Now upon the further-shore
Lands the voyager at last.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
2 There the tears of earth are dried;
There its hidden things are clear;
There the work of life is tried
a juster Judge than here.


S There the Shepherd, bringing home
Many a lamb forlorn and strayed,
Shelters each, no more to roam,
Where the wolf can ne’er invade.
4 There the penitents who turn
To the cross their dying eyes
All the love of Jesus learn
At His feet in Paradise.
6 There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace;
Christ the Lord shall guard them well.
He who died for their release.
6 “ Earth to earth, and dust to dust,”
Calmly now the words we say;
Left behind, we wait in trust
For the resurrection day. Amen.
The End.
