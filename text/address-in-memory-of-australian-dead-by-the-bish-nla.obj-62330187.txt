,/B \V After the words that but a few minutes ago have fallen from the I A
? 8 of one of your Chaplains in the pulpit, it behoves me, knowing } 4 J
little of your beautiful language, to be silent. But if I give no f 'y

IV | would fail in the fulfilment of a triple duty which my conscience dictates to me ? fpq
IV] the duty of Prayer for your numerous fallen resting in peace in my land of ?
I Oil! l" Picardy and on the borders of the Somme; the duty of gratefulness for the 1 ?*<>'^7
Vj*!J liberation of my Diocese from the enemy?s yoke; and the duty of admiration Jnf*T' -
j�v\ for your heroism which has placed you in the foremost ranks amongst the f
L| bravest in this unique war. j S WJ
Together we have prayed for your fallen, and their immortal souls have \f
appeared before God who has judged them. As our human praise expires on >5
the brinks of their tombs we are powerless to grant them the glory to which P :
they have a right. For that reason we pray the Lord to grant them a reward H :
j ? < h*�\ worthy of their sacrifice. May He make them perfectly saintly and beautiful that ( }.*,
jl I they may one and all without delay have a right to an eternal Crown and a f ?' H.
\X J glorious immortality.
I: W As Bishop of Amiens I owe you and your illustrious Dead my heartfelt \S ;* j
thanks because the land of my Diocese has been your field of battle and you J
have delivered it by the sacrifice of your blood. }r \
M ? ? S'k.iT During the painful days of the invasion you made a rampart of your breasts, (
I behind which you shielded and saved the last shreds of my territory; later, when y
\ Victory at last began to smile upon our arms, the Australian Army distinguished p / Wf
f W itself by the audacity of its attacks, by its utter disregard of Death, by its <� I
D.. ?*_, B doggedness, and by the rapidity of its advances. y : y
I -i t?/?is In the name of my Clergy and of my People I offer you my heartfelt I - 1 ' A

1* ~ Why did you leave your far-away Australia? Because of your sentiments / f
HL of loyalty towards the British Empire, whose Banner has protected the British \
Empire and the development of your country, its existence, its economic future 1 ' \
? and its civilisation ?for these were in jeopardy as well as the destinies of France. |
tB It was necessary to save from German military violence the hegemony of the I, ..tdUm
I ' u i- 1 World. For that reason you left your shores and crossed oceans ?for the s'
,1 v j . J honour of your country, and for its future. \ Jfs L
I It takes blood to cement the foundation of a country, and you could not !_ Jr W I
I \ f refuse it in the World War, to the cause of Christianity. You have indeed 1
