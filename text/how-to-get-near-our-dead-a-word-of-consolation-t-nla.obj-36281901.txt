How to Get Near Our Dead.
Ye believe in God believe also in me. John xiv., 1.
Abide in me. John xv., 4.
But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were tar
off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. Ep. ii., 13.
One of the features of the time in which we
live is that modern scientific appliances have,
to a large extent, annihilated space. The
locomotive and the turbine steamer have made
it possible to move from place to place in an
amazingly short period of time. Flying pro-
mises to help us considerably in this respect.
Then, again, the telegraph, the telephone, and
wireless have brought those far away very
near. We read messages from them just a
short time after they were written, and we
hear their voices speaking in our ears when
they are miles distant. We do not think it
wonderful to talk to people five hundred miles
away. Yet there is one case in which all
'these modern arrangements break down, and
that is when a loved one dies. The locomotive,
the ocean liner, the telephone, the telegraph,
and wireless are of no avail in bringing us near
to those who have been severed from us by
death. Those who have lost loved ones at
the Front are keenly alive to this. They feel
that they have gone to a place which is be-
yond the reach of all these appliances.


I-—Getting near to God means getting near to
the departed.
But still the human soul craves nearness to
the objects of its love, and instinctively feels
that when all scientific appliances fail there is
still a means of getting near its loved ones.
And so there is. God is the means. If we are
near to Him, we are near to them. And so,
instinctively, these sorrowing- ones have been
getting nearer to God, and finding that in so
doing they are nearer to the dear departed.
Why is this so? Are they actually able to
communicate with them? I think not, but
what happens is this:—
(a) Jn getting near to God they discover
that the love which they have for the dear
departed is only a spark of the Divine love of
God; only a drop from the ocean of His love.
They discover, in short, as John did, that God
is love (1 John iv. 8), and, like Paul, they go
on discovering that nothing can separate them
from the love of God—“neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature” (Rom. viii.
38-39). God's love follows all His creatures to
all parts of His universe. It is distributed over
all, and withdrawn from none. Thus the love
of parent and friend flows into the great ocean
of God’s love, where they feel no separation,
but, rather, that they touch everything that
God’s love touches.
(bl In getting near to God they further dis-
cover that God, in addition to His love going
out to all things in His universe, is actually
near to all things in His universe. They find
that if they could travel to every part of the
universe they would still find God. Like the


Psalmist, they realise the omnipresence of God.
and sav; “Whither shall I go from Ihy Spirit ?
or whither shall I flee from Thy Presence?
If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if
I make my bed in Sheol, behold Thou art
there” (Ps. 139, 7-8). And they argue from
this that God is in touch with their loved ones
wherever they are, and that if they get near
to God they get near to them; that their chief
business is to abide in the presence of God,
and in so doing they reach the nearest point
to their loved ones. God is a kind of Red
Cross Agency in touch with every part of His
universe, and through Him they reach those
who have gone. Longfellow, in his “Foot-
steps of the Angels,” has drawn a picture of
one netting near to God, and so feeling the
nearness of the departed—
When the hours of day are numbered,
And the voices of the night
Wake the better soul, that slumbered,
To a holy, calm delight;
Ere the evening lamps are lighted,
And, like phantoms grim and tall,
Shadows from the fitful firelight
Dance upon the parlour wall;
Then the forms of the departed
■ Enter at the open door;
The beloved, the true-hearted,
Come to visit me once more.
(c) In getting near to God, they further dis-
cover that God not only loves and is able to
communicate with all beings in His universe,
but He also uses His omnipotence to plan and
prepare the best for all. They have sent
comforts to the ones away so long as they were
in the flesh. If this is so, how much more


will God, with His supreme love and all-per-
vading presence and power, plan and prepare
for those who have been taken from them. We
see how God thinks of us here, how suitable
our bodies are to their purpose, and how they
are placed in a suitable environment. He
who has done things so well here will think of
all that is needed in the future. Sometimes
we look upon the glories of the sea and sky and
hill about us, and remember how those who
have gone loved it all, and the first impulse is
to feel sad to think that they are missing it
all. But. then, comes the thought: If God
has thought of all this here, will He not think
of and prepare all that we need in the future?
“What now, O son of Hur? Knowing so
much, shall I dispute with myself or you about
the unnecessaries—about the form of my soul ?
Or where it is to abide? Or whether it eats
or drinks? Or is winged, or wears this or
that? No. It is more becoming to trust in
God. The beautiful in this world is all from
His hand, declaring the perfection of taste;
He is the Author of all form ; He clothes the
lily, He colours the rose, He distils the dew-
drop, He makes the music of nature; in a word.
He organised us for this life, and imposed its
conditions, and they are such guaranty to me
that, trustful as a little child, I leave to Him
the organisation of my soul, and every arrange-
ment for the life after death. I know He
loves me.” (Ben Hur, book 7. chap. 3, p.
347.) Yes, God thinks of us here, and He
will think and plan for us in the future. Christ
assures us of this when He says: “I go to pre-
pare a place for you” (John xiv. 1), and Paul
believes this when he says; “Eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
the heart of man, the things which God hath


prepared for them that love Him.” (Cor. ii.
9.)
Thus, as we get near to God, we get near to
the departed. We follow them with His love,
we reach them with His omnipresence, we plan
for them with His omnipotence. It is in this
way, through Him, that we have the commu-
nion of saints, the “mystic sweet communion
with those whose rest is won.”
(d) In coming near to God they further dis-
cover that Christ was nearest of all to God.
He of all others knew and set forth the love
of God. He above all others realised and set
forth the omnipresence and omniscience of
God. He above all others realised and set
forth the omnipotence of God. The blood of
Jesus makes us nigh, because it is especially
in His sacrifice on the Cross that the love,
omniscience and omnipotence of God are set
forth. They come to find that nearness to
Him, especially as He is crucified, means near-
ness to God, and to all our loved ones. They
believe in God, and so feel near to the depart-
ed, but as they come to believe in Christ, they
get nearer still, and come to understand better
what Jesus meant when He said: :“Let not
3 r our heart be troubled; ye believe in God. be-
lieve also in Me.” (John xiv. 1.)
The following poem beautifully expresses
what I mean :
“Beside the dead I knelt in prayer,
And felt a Presence as I prayed,
Lo, it was Jesus standing there,
He smiled: ‘Be not afraid.’
“‘Lord, Thou hast conquered death, we know;
Restore again to life,’ I said,
‘This one who died an hour ago.’
He smiled: ‘She is not dead.’


"'Asleep, then as Thyself didst say;
Yet Thou canst lift the lids that keep
Her prisoned eyes from ours away.
He smiled; ‘She doth not sleep.’
“'Nay, then tho’ haply she do wake.
And look upon some fairer dawn.
Restore her to our hearts that ache.’
He smiled: ‘She is not gone.’
“Alas! too well we know our loss,
Nor hope again to feel that breatn,
T ill we ourselves the river cross.
He smiled: 'There is no death.’
“'Yet, our beloved seem so far.
The while we yearn to seem them near,
Albeit with Thee we trust they are.’
He smiled: “And I am here.”
" ‘Dear Lord, how shall we know that they,
Still walk unseen with us and Thee,
Nor sleep, nor wander far away V
He .smiled: ‘Abide in Me.’”
Thus, in the valley of the shadow, we find
the lover of our souls waiting for us. Thus
many are finding that although the graves of
loved ones, with their wooden crosses, are far
away in Gallipoli or h ranee, yet, when they
draw near to God in Christ, they are near to
them —perhaps, even nearer than when they
were living. These, having tasted of the joy
of being near to God, and how that part of
that jov is that the sense of separation from
departed loved ones is, to a large extent, wiped
out, are prepared to sing;
“Nearer ray God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me.”


ll.—Getting near to God brings us near to the
living.
And what will be the result of this getting
near to God? It will not only bring us near
to the departed, but it will bring us nearer to
the living, and eventually solve all our separa-
tion —domestic, social, ecclesiastical and na-
tional. After all our scientific attainments,
even up to the discovery and development of
wireless telegraphy which has brought us near
to one another, so far as mere physical dis-
tance is concerned, there is still much separ-
ation of soul from soul. In the same family
we will find great gulfs fixed; in the same so-
ciety there is the gulf between labour and
capital; in the Church of God there are de-
nominational differences; and what separation
there is between nations with differing ideals.
If netting near to God bridges the separation
between the living and the dead, will not get-
tin- near to Him bridge the distance between
the living and the living? Yea, verily. If
those who through sorrow have got near to
God, and find inn it brings them nearer to the
dear departed, will sing “Nearer, my God, to
Thee,” and strive to be nearer, what will they
discover? —
(a) They will discover that the love of God
is a much wider thing than they anticipated.
The love which we have for the departed is the
love which God has for all. All men are the
family of God, and His love extends to all. “God
so loved the world that He gave His only-be-
botten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him
should hot perish, but have everlasting life”
(John hi. 16.) He loves the black sheep of
the family. He loves the capitalist, and He loves
the labourer; He loves the Anglican and the


Presbyterian, and those of every creed; He
loves the Briton and the German, and those
of every nation. He ‘‘hath made of one blood
all nations of men for to dwell on all the face
of the earth, and hath determined the times
before appointed, and the bounds of their
habitation.” (Acts xvii. 26.) No matter how
thev err Pie still loves them, for His is the
love that will not let the nation or the indivi-
dual go. When they do well He loves with a
love that makes Him glad; when they do ill He
loves with a love that makes Him sad. When
they discover this love they will also feel how
far short thev come of that love, and will pray
that thev mav have it given unto them. And
once that love for all mankind comes, we will
feel that separation is at once broken down.
Whether they do evil or good, we will love
them, and nothing can separate ns from them.
We are drawn nearer to our own, and to those
of another class, and of another denomination
and of another nation.
(b) With this love of those who differ from
us will also come the desire to communi-
cate with them, just as there is the desire to
communicate with the dear departed. And
here, again, will come the assurance that this
is possible through nearness to God. He is
near to them, even at their heart’s door. We
can pray to Him for them.
“He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small:
For the dear God Who loveth us,
He made and loveth all.”
—S. T. Coleridge, Ancient Mariner, Fart v.
In prayer we can not only get
into touch with the members of our own fam-
ily, but with the whole planet. We have


often experienced that when we have written
a letter to an individual, the very next day one
arrived from him. So when we think of an-
other person in prayer, that person is probably
thinking - of us, and there is an approach to a
mutual understanding and a mutual helping.
Through the Spirit of God, acting upon the
sub-conscious, we have reached the object of
our prayer. Thus, the craving to annihilate
physical and psychical space is, to a large ex-
tent, satisfied by prayer. Intercessory prayer
brings us into contact with those for whom
we pray. "We have in intercessory prayer a
mode of communication swifter than the tele-
graph or the telephone. God is near to us
and equally near to them. We can send them
our message through Him, and that with the
certainty that no time will be lost on the way,
and that it will infallibly reach the ears for
which it was intended.” (Hastings’ Christian
Doctrines of Prayer, p. 119.) The fervour and
intensity of the prayer is the fruit of the love
which prompts it.” (Ibid.) “He who prays
much for individuals and keeps a record of
intercession has a vast accumulation of evi-
dence that for affecting others nothing is so
potent as prayer. (Christian Doctrine of Prayer,
by Hastings, pp.. 127-128). Not only is this
so, but out of intercessory prayer will come
a desire to know the point of contact, and even
a knowledge of the point of contact. We are
praying for victory over Germany, not for the
purpose of crushing her and making Europe’s
political map “a chessboard of complicated
ambitions and sanguinary struggles during the
next hundred years to come” (‘‘D.T.,” Jan. 27,
1917), but for the purpose of uniting her on the
basis of love and righteousness, and not on the
basis of force. We are thus getting a point


of contact with Germany, viz., unity, and can
go on after the victory is won to show that
the only true basis of unity is love. What
is true of nations is also true of families and
individuals. Intercessory prayer leads to a
knowledge of the point of contact. Then, the
next time we meet, we will be able to speak
along the line of contact. Thus, we will dis-
cover the kindred spirits in family, society,
church, and nation, and be led deeper than we
have ever been into the communion of saints.
Not onlv so. but we will also discover the an-
tagonistic spirits and the line of demarca-
tion and antagonism between good' and evil
will be more clearly drawn.
(c) Coming with this sense of the love of
God for all men, and the nearness of God to all
men will come still further the assurance that
God plans for all men. If he prepares a place
for the departed ones in His House of Many
Mansions in Heaven, that love which goes out
to all men, and that power of His which is
near to all men, will provide for all men here
on this earth. He has a place and a Avork for
each member of each family. He has a place
for the labourer and the capitalist. We will
discover that God has not only made of one
blood all nations to chvell on the earth, but He
has determined “the bounds of their habita-
tion” (Acts xvii. 26). There is, therefore, a
sphere for Britain and her Allies, for Germany
and her Allies, and for each neutral nation.
We will not only see this, but we will feel it
our bounden duty to co-operate Avith God the
Father in helping every individual and every
social unit and eveiw nation to find the allot-
ted place; in short, to bring on earth the
Father’s FTouse with its many mansions, where
each individual and each social and national


unit will line! its work and sphere; in other
words its mansion. We will feel impelled on
to do work like that of Sheldon Jackson of
Alaska, Grenfell of Labrador, McKay of Ug-
anda, and Robertson of Erromanga. Coupled
with this will also come the co-operation of
the people who are near God for the purpose
of overthrowing the forces of evil. ‘‘lt is also
to be expected that after the war a stronger
faith will be cherished in the possibility of
coping with other malignant evils. We have
learned what a great people can do when it
devotes itself with one heart and mind to the
organisation of victory; and it will seem a
matter of course that the same energy, earnest-
ness, and method should be applied to the per-
ennial warfare with ignorance and destitution,
vice, and crime, and that the spirit of brother-
hood so signally exemplified in arms, should
be equally realised in the arts and avocations
of peace.'’ (Prof. W. P. Paterson, D.D., in
“E.T.,” Oct.. 1917, p. 12.)
(d) All these attributes are to be seen in
Christ in their fulness. This is the next dis-
covery. Abide in Him, for abiding in Him
gives life, and life brings us into communion
with other branches of the Vine, and produces
the fruit which attracts and wins those who are
afar ofif in our families, in society, and in other
nations —the fruit which gives the point of con-
tact and enables us to communicate with men,
and work for men. Abiding in Him, we ‘“live
and love and make the world other” (Tenny-
son).
The feeling of separation from loved ones
drives us nearer to God, and, coming nearer to
God we feel our need of coming nearer to
Christ. Thus, we prove the power of Christ’s


2i>'sJ
words, spoken to those who were face to face
with the keenest separation—“ Let not your
heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe
also in Me.” (John xiv., 1.)
“All the aim of life is just
Getting back to God.
Spirit easting oft’ its dust,
Getting back to God.
Every grief we have to bear,
Disappointment, cross, despair,
Each is but another stair
Climbing back to God.
“Step by step, and mile by mile—
Getting back to God.
Nothing else is worth the while—
Getting back to God.
Light and shadow fill each day,
Joys and sorrows pass away,
Smile at all, and, smiling, say:
Getting back to God.
"Do not wear a mournful face
Getting back to God;
Scatter sunshine on the place
Going back to God.
Take what pleasure you can find,
But where’er your patli.s may wind
Keep the purpose well in mind—
Getting back to God.”
Song of the Spirit (E. W. Wilcox).
