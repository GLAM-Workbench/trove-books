COMPLIMENTARY DINNER
COUNCILLOR M. LARKIN.
(Exlract from the ? South Melbourne Citizen'' of Saturday ,
May nth, iBBg.)
COMPLIMENTARY dinner was tendered to Councillor
Larkin, in the Supper Room of the Town Hall, on Thursday
evening, ?in recognition of his past services to the City. About
150 gentlemen assembled to do honor to the guest of the evening,
and Mr, George Gray presided.
The Chairman (Mr. Gray) proposed ?the guest of the
evening.? This proposition met with hearty applause. Mr. Gray-
said ? He was glad that the toast met with such a hearty reception.
He could wish the toast had been placed in abler hands, but
whatever he lacked in eloquence in dealing with it would not be
wanting in sincerity. (Loud cheers). There would be nothing he
would say that he would not be prepared to take his oath to.
Councillor Larkin was a busy man, and there were many things
that would pay him better than attending to the duties of a
Councillor. During the last three years he had proved himself to
be a very energetic Councillor. Many works had caused con-
siderable discussion and comment, but Councillor Larkin had
done his duty to the satisfaction of everyone in the City of South
Melbourne. His services could not be undervalued. One thing
struck him (Mr. Gray) as almost wonderful, that was the appli-
cation of Councillor Larkin to the duties of a magistrate, which
he had fulfilled for the last eight years. When appointed he was


only 28 years old, the youngest magistrate in Victoria. Ihis
fact showed that Councillor Larkin had good metal in him, and
he bad shown this in every capacity in which he had since been
placed. During his seat on the Bench he had transacted the
business before him to the satisfaction of everyone, and in many
instances to the entire satisfaction of those who were unfortunate
enough to have been brought before him. (Laughter). He (the
speaker) had no wish to understand the nicety of the position,
but one thing made it comfortable, and that was to know that if
any misfortune befel, it would be comforting to feel that we were
brought before gentlemen who had the courage of their opinions
and a great sense of justice. In fact, there were few men who
had been brought before Councillor Larkin who would not, in
their sober senses say ? serves me right.? There were many other
things that redounded to the credit ot the guest of the evening.
The Building Society with which he was connected redounded to
his credit. The South Melbourne Permanent Building Society
was one of the most successful institutions in South Melbourne,
and its prosperity was due solely to the energy of the Secretary,
Councillor Larkin. For many years the Hibernian Society had
mentioned Councillor Larkin?s name in a way that any man would
feel justly proud of. He had been an able and earnest worker for
the Society, and had helped in its success. Socially he was the
President of the Rowing Club, and was also President of the
Albert Park Bowling Club, and would be so probably for all
time to come. (Cheers). As an ordinary business man Councillor
Larkin was punctual, honest and straightforward, and by his
ability and integrity had earned golden opinions. As a friend
everyone knew his virtues and his charitable disposition and
kindly manner. Those who knew him had the deepest respect
and affection for him, and there was not one of his acquaintances
who were not pleased and proud to call Councillor Larkin their
friend. (Loud cheers). Mrs. Larkin also ?(cheers) ?had been fore-
most in works of sympathy and charity, and deserved the thanks
of the whole community. But the old saying, that ? A good son


makes a good father,? was exemplified in Councillor Larkin.
(Cheers). As a son he possessed more filial affection than most
sons, and if he (the speaker) ever wanted a son he would wish to
have just such an one as their guest. ( Cheers). One thing was
not pleasant, that was the failure of Councillor Larkin to procure
a seat in Parliament. They all knew how anxious and confident
they felt as to the result of the recent contest. His opponent on
this occasion was a A VERY INFERIOR BEING, and it was
satisfactory to know that Councillor Larkin was not rejected for
any lack of ability, nor would he (the speaker) like to say what
the main cause was. He hoped the doy would not be far distant
when the same battle would be fought over again, and with
triumph to their guest. If they could think what a perfect gentle-
man should be, Councillor Larkin was the embodiment of their
imagination.?
Councillor Larkin, on rising to respond to the toast, was
received with loud and prolonged applause. He said ?That
neither wit, words, nor worth of his could in any way be applied
to liquidate the obligation laid upon him by the kindness displayed
on that occasion. To thank them would more than satisfy him
that evening, but a month ago he would have done it in a decent
form. To express gratitude was different from addressing them
at election times. The Chairman had enumerated a number of
virtues which he had no idea he (Councillor Larkin) possessed,
and he would be wanting fin feeling if he did not express his
gratitude for the kindly reference. For 33 years he had lived in
South Melbourne, and had performed various duties imposed
upon him, according to his lights. If his actions had evoked the
good opinions of the general public, he could not but feel proud,
and more than satisfied. As a magistrate he had often to sustain
defeat. When compelled to put a man ? away,? however, he always
did so in a scientific and gentlemany manner. As an instance,
during the late election campaign, he gave a man six months for
being drunk. The prisoner asked ?As he was a voter why was he
sent up. When told that he deserved it, the prisoner remarked


? Blowed if I don?t,? With regard to his (Councillor Larkin?s)
character, parents, and the method of his bringing up, he had nothing
to say. He was born of poor, but honest, parents, who, he was pleased
to say, were still living and to the fore, and he hoped they would
long remain on this mundane sphere. He had never caused his
parents a blush or ever cost them a tear. He had always
interested himself in local clubs. With respect to the parliamentary
contest, the battle was fought at a high pressure, and all that
could be done was done to secure his return. If they had not
achieved the victory, they had done more, they had deserved it.
The poll, however, showed them to be on the wrong side, and
although the defeat was a heavier one than had been expected, he
had not felt it as keenly as his friends had done. There would
always be feelings of regret and disappointment in things of that
kind. If this evening, the company were celebrating a defeat, he
wondered what it would have been like had they met to celebrate
a victory ? He tendered his grateful thanks for their attendance
that evening, and the compliment to him being unexpected, was
all the more pleasing. The demonstration that evening was so
spontaneous that it could not possibly be lost on any man who
possessed a brain or a heart.? Councillor Larkin concluded his
reply by saying, ? With a heart as full as the glasses in which you
have toasted me, I again return you my sincere thanks.? (Loud
and prolonged applause).


THE BOOK OF MATTHIAS.
CHAPTER I.
A ND there came to the shores of Victoria, in the early fifties,
* a couple with an only son, and who took up their abode by
the road side, in the old town of Emerald Hill.
AND behold! this only son was the joy and one bright spot
in the hearts of doting father and mother.
AND it came to pass that the fond parents of this only son
had him baptized in their own faith, and he was ever afterwards
known as Matthias.
AND as time rolled on Matthias gave up his boyish
frivolities, and employed his leisure hours in herding his father s
kine, and distributing the liquid abstracted from them to the
surrounding neighbours.
AND, behold ! this filial son was soon looked upon as
belonging to things heavenly, not earthly.
AND all the men and women of the neighborhood used to
bid their own offspring to emulate the good deeds of the holy
Matthias.
AND the fond father, watching the boy?s progress and
aptitude, said unto him : Matthias, thou art getting to an age that
thou must soon be thinking to depend upon thyself?thou
knowest that I have ever done my duty towards thee, and now
thou wilt have to reward me and thy poor old mother in our
declining days.
AND the son answered, and said : Father, tell me that
which thou wouldst wish me do, or suggest what in thy wisdom
thou wouldst recommend ?
AND the father spake unto his son, and said : Thou wouldst
make a good saddler, Matthias. And so it accordingly came to
pass that Matthias was put apprentice to learn the art of a
saddler.
AND, behold ! as Matthias waxed his thread and plied his
awl, his busy brain foreshadowed that he was born to greater
things than stitch, stitch all the day.


AND he utilised all his leisure hours until he had mastered
the science of finance, and history has recorded that he financed
with a vengeance. And Matthias, being highly favored of his
people, became, in process of lime, the mightiest financier in
South Melbourne.
AND, as the voice of Matthias had great charms, he used to
go into the highways and by-ways, sympathising with the poor
and ignorant of his people, showing unto them how they could
multiply and increase their little savings.
AND so it came to past that the multitude, placing their trust
in this filial son, who ? never cost his aged parents a moment?s
anguish,? allowed him to attend to their financial matters.
AND Matthias said : I will establish my name in the
hearts of the people, and which name shall descend to my
children?s children, and from generation to generation.
AND, behold ! Matthias emulated the high priests of his
church, and whithersoever he went he carried with him a volume
of Holy Writ. ,
AND, lo ! in his vest he carried at all times the finger New
Testament, which he fondled caressingly with his- fingers as it lay
hidden in his vesture.
AND at divers times he brought forth that small and sacred
volume, and showed it unto his brethren of the Finance Com-
mittee in the Council, saying : Behold, I carry with me the Grace
of God.
THEN did his brother Councillors cross themselves, and
say: How are the righteous exalted; blessed, and upright and
holy is Matthias !
BUT in the latter days Matthias parted with the holy volume
unto an ex-mayor, and behold it has now fallen into the hands of
a good citizen named Henry, who treasures it for the sake of the
holy Matthias.
BUT it came to pass that a serpent, more subtle than the
beasts of the field, crossed the path of Matthias, and sorely
tempted him to diverge from the strict path of virtue trodden by
him (?)
AND the serpent said unto him : Matthias, thou art born to
greater things than living a life of drudgery.
AND Matthias answered and said unto the serpent: Show
me which way you would have me put my talents into operation.
AND the serpent said unto Matthias : ? Lend me your ear.?
And Matthias lowered himself down unto the serpent, and the


serpent beguiled him into appropriating the funds of his employers
and friends, to his own personal use. ?
AND the serpent further said; If thou canst not con-
veniently do this by thyself thou mayst have a confederate, but
under no circumstances must thou impeach thy companion.
AND Matthias answered the serpent and said : Thou art my
idol, and I will harken unto thee all the days of my life.
AND it came to pass that Matthias did the bidding of the
serpent. He filched all the moneys the society had, and said :
Behold, this place has not sufficient scope for me, I must send
for the President and tell him I cannot consent to remain any
longer in such a miserable and depleted institution. The funds are
all gone, and a fresh supply must be provided if my presence is
to grace the future history of the institution.
AND, behold ! the President and Vice-President waited
upon Matthias and gently but humanly declined to accede to the
wishes of dear Matthias.
IT afterwards came to pass that one Fleming, an emissary of
the law, hearing of the expertness of Matthias and one Patrick,
surnamed Cleary, afterwards designated St. Patrick, and being
jealous of their great power, took them under his protecting wing,
and presented them to a bench of Justices.
AND it came to pass, after due deliberation, that the said
Justices said unto Matthias and St. Patrick : Thou hast hearkened
too long unto the voice of the serpent, and thou wilt be recom-
mended to the tender mercies of Colonel Bull
AND behold on the Fifth day of the week, in the bright
sunshine of December, Matthias and St. Patrick were taken from
the Justices, and away from a vast multitude and cast into prison,
and there kept until the 15th February.
(The allusion to the filial son not costing his aged parents a
moment's anguish , will be explained in reading Mr. Gray's speech
when proposing Larkin's health at a Complimentary Banquet ,
tendered to him in the Town Hall , on 9 th May , 1889/1 and
Larkins reply.)
CHAPTER 11.
VT OW, as Matthias Sagrado,. which being interpreted, means
the holy Matthias, and his companion St. Patrick, girded
up their loins before entering into the chariot, which conveyed
them to prison, the Philistines, who called themselves the investors,
gathered together in a great multitude.


AND they laughed Jehu, the driver of the chariot, to scorn,
saying : Wherefore get you not a hansom for these holy pilgrims ?
BUT the Jehu waxed wroth and put forth his chin.
AND, behold ! as the holy Matthias came forth from the
centurion?s office to the chariot, he smiled upon the multitude,
and looked merry.
AND O?Mega, son of Taurus Hibernicus, stood out from
among the Philistines, and said with a loud voice: Arrah, now
d?ye moind the dhevil is shmiling. Oh, the two ends and betune
part of a thavin vagabond. Shure he scoops the pool as clane as
Biddy Murphy?s cat would lick the platter. Oh ! the mealy-
mouthed murtherin spalpeen, lave me at him till I take a twist
out av him.
AND the multitude cried out in anger : Bate him with a
shtick, O?Mega, and their bellowing was as the roar of many
lions.
AND 10, a widow of the house of McGuinness, came forth from
the multitude and waiving her ? Sara Gamp,? smote at the holy
Matthias, saying : I would have his ear, that I might ever pour
into it my troubles. And the multitude sought to take the ear
of the holy Matthias
BUT the centurion and his soldiers cried out to the multi-
tude, Move on ! and they parted the crowd in sunder, and put the
holy Matthias and the saintly Patrick into the chariot.
THEN the centurion said unto the Jehu : Stimulate thy
horse, and get thee hence quickly with thy chariot, less the
Philistines overset thy apple cart, and do thee and thy passengers
grevious hurt.
AND the Jehu said : Cl?k, git aape?and he departed.
AND as the chariot rattled along the highway, the sainted
Patrick stuck out his chin and said to the holy Matthias : Matthias,
thou art a traitor and a hypocrite.
AND Matthias answered, and said : You can?t get away
from that. But wherefore dost thou upbraid me, have I not made
thee a sainted Patrick for historians to write of? whereas, but for
me, thou wouldst have ended thy career as a common steward of
accounts, unknown to fame and all the world.
BUT, 10, Patrick waxed very wroth, and said : Matthias, thou
art worse than the serpent that beguiled thee. The serpent told
thee thou should not impeach thy confederate. Thou knowest
that without my aid thy swindles would have long since been
discovered. Bah ! I would sooner have worked the job with
Ned Kelly, for he would have better heeded the serpent, and
would not have so chucked his mate over.


AND Matthias smiled, and bade Patrick calm himself, and
keep his hair on. And he said : Lo, Patrick, wherefore dost
thou get thy wool off? It is not meet at such a time as this that
we twain should quarrel. For, behold ! the 15th February will
soon be upon us, and in the meantime we have much to think
about.
BUT the sainted Patrick would not be comforted, and at
length Matthias said : I did but tell Swindley, in secret, that thou
wert with me up to the neck in this business, and Swindley, with
a ready tongue, spake it to the multitude.
THEN did Patrick fall upon the neck of the holy Matthias
and weep, and lifting up his voice cried : Alas, I have wronged
thee Matthias. Thou thyself hast been betrayed by that
blathering Vice-President.
AND in due time these two men, the holy Matthias and the
sainted Patrick, were given into the charge of the Governor of
the prison, and the Jehu, having fulfilled his charge, departed.
THEN did Matthias petition the Governor that he might be
left alone for a brief space, that he might think, and the Governor
did as Matthias wished.
AND Matthias knit his brow and thought, and murmured,
this is a darned awkward fix, Mat, and you can?t get away from
that.
AND the sainted Patrick, over-hearing the murmur, said :
True, too true, alas ?boo hoo !
BUT Matthias said : Patrick, weep not! whoso is simple let
him turn in hither and stay here, but as for us let us put our
heads together and devise a way to get out. This place is an
abomination in my sight, and I like it not.
AND Patrick said : Verily, as the prophets have written,
cursed is the man who trusteth in man. But as yesterday we two,
trusting in the dulness of man, wallowed in riches and freedom,
to-day we are prisoners in H.M. Gaol.
CHAPTER 111.
AND behold when the holy Matthias had been taken away the
** investors bewailed their misfortune.
AND a poet from among the multitude came forth and
called the young men and maidens to bring forth their cymbals.


AND 10, they brought forward cymbals and harps, and with
lamentations sang this song that the poet gave them :
ONLY a cowshed?with a boy working: hard in there, with a willing
hand and beaming face, and nice black curly hair.
ONLY a cow?but a good and faithful thing, and a boy at his work
with a large milk can, as happy as a king.
ONLY a milk can?and this bov trudging bravely on, laden with milk
for his customers, who call him a dutiful son.
ONLY a lad?with his way in life to fight, determined he is to make a
change, and his father thinks he?s right.
ONLY a vouth?he works in a saddler?s shop, with hope as an anchor
of his soul, prompting him not to stop.
ONLY a man?with a good and honest name, beloved by all his friends
and kin. and on the road to fame.
ONLY a scribe?but with intellect bright and clear, making a living and
doing much good, on five hundred and fifty a year.
ONLY a self-made man?who can count his friends by the score, and he
joins the city council, to jump up one step more.
ONLY one of the wealthy?or one who is reckoned as such, buying on
contracts of thousands, and buying a deal too much.
ONLY a politician?and the hustings now he mounts, the ? Citizen ?
knocks him backwards ; from this his fall he counts.
ONLY a building society?run by the self-made man, conducted with all
propriety, according to Larkin?s plan.
PAYMENTS on lands now running, continually falling due ; now for
his tact or cunning, excelled or equalled by few.
ONLY a tap for some hundreds?then onlv a few thousands "more, and
then he draws like water, for over three thousand score.
ONLY an aged man?going down to his grave in tears, with a knowledge
that his most dutiful son may be in prison for years.
ONLY some friend^?who look at the things like a dream, while
smiling through their tearful eyes, ask IC Are things what they seem ? ?
OH ! for the man, that one in ten thousand to find, who can deal with
other persons? cash, and leaveja good name behind.
CHAPTER IV.
behold ! when evil had fallen upon Matthias and he had
been cast into prison to await his trial, many were the
sayings of men concerning him.
AND 10, some said, there were born unto him sons and
daughters.
AND others said, his substance was also of ponies two, one
horse, one cow, a phaeton, and one Abbott buggy and per-
ambulator. Large lots of land, a large house, with women


servants and men servants, and a great and glorious household,
so that this man was the greatest man of all the great men of
South Melbourne.
AND his friends went and feasted in his house, by the day
and night, and the friends of those friends were sent for and
called in to eat and to drink with him.
AND it was so when the days of their feasting were gone
about that Mat sent and condemned them for not rising early in
the morning to whisky with him on their march to the Beach,
and thus did Mat condemn them continually.
NOW there was a day when certain of the Directors, who
were above Mat, came to present themselves before him, and
Satan appeared among them, standing on the right hand of Mat.
AND Satan said, I have come from going to and fro in the
earth, and from walking up and down in it.
HAST thou not considered that I hold my pitchfork and
my sceptre, and I here present my sceptre to thy servant Mat,
whom I honour above priceless gems and pearls, and do
acknowledge his supremacy.
AS the fires are all heated let him take the cake also, and
then bake it until it doth burn to a cinder.
AND behold, as Satan spoke, there came a great wind,
which did change the countenance of k Mat like unto the counten-
ance of him who reigns below.
AND when Mat?s friends heard of these things which had
come uponjhim, they came everyone to Mats own house, for
they had made an appointment together to come to cheer and
comfort him.
AND when they lifted up their eyes and saw the sceptre
near hand they wept and rent everyone his garments, and
sprinkled asphalt upon their heads, and Satan again appeared.
AND they halted to show allegiance because of that sceptre?
but they sat down with Mat and spake unto him, and considered
that his ventures were very great indeed.
AND two friends said unto him, if we essay to commune
with thee wilt thou be grieved, but who can withhold himself
from speaking ?
BEHOLD thou hast instructed many, and thou hast
strengthened the weak hands, and now it is come upon thee Mat
that thou art changed into the king of demons whom Satan doth
acknowledge; and at this time Satan vanished.


THEN said one of the other of the great men of South
Melbourne: Wilt thou oh Mat accept this sceptre, or wilt thou
wake with us to find this but a dream ?
BUT Mat took the sceptre, and said : My brethren, my
sins as scarlet are, I have been deceitful as a Brook, and as the
stream of Brooks let me go on for ever.
FOR my Branch shooteth forth in South Melbourne to shed
seeds of misery among mankind, let me therefore, I pray thee,
go on for ever.
AND when he had done speaking there arose another and a
stranger man, who took Mat, and he was cast into prison until
the day of his trial and his judgment.
AND the children of the people cried aloud as with one
voice, verily is the King of the Infernal Regions now cast into
our prison, for could not the scene have been viewed from Dr.
Stewart?s back yard ?
LET us therefore rejoice with exceeding great joy that this
infernal king can no more for a season come from going to and
fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
CHAPTER V.
A ND it came to pass in the dog days of the first month, which
are known far and wide for their blue blazing heat, a vast
multitude assembled at the Palace, which upon completion was
christened by the holy Matthias ? Lake View.? Owing to recent
events it was deemed desirable to find a more appropriate name,
and one in accord with the fitness of things, hence ? Fraudville,?
the Palace in which Matthias dwelt for a brief season.
CHARIOTS rolled up to the Palace in great grandeur,
bearing the high and mighty of the land, and a multitude walked
thither bearing their staffs in their hands.
AND when they arrived at the Palace, lo Matthias was not
there, and the multitude said: Alas, where has he gone, and what
has he done with the money?
AND a certain Scribe stepped forth and said unto Cheif
Ruler Baragwanath, a son of Rechab, who stood in the portico :
Good day, old man. And the Chief Ruler answered, Good day.
AND the Scribe said : Has there been any row yet ? For
behold I was informed that things were likely to take a lively turn.


But the Chief Ruler shook his head sorrowfully and said ; There
has not been any row.
THEN did the Rosser, a man of fluent speech, �{. ep h � r ig
and say unto the multitude : Behold, this I alacc
in it is for sale. Who among you are buyers ?
AND a great silence fell upon the multitude, none anng o
speak.
BUT Rosser, who acted for Gemmell, Tucket and Co, ati
tioneers, cried out with a loud voice ; I will sell this Palace and
all that is in it, therefore hearken you to my words.
AND he read from a long document certain grange mings
which'he cdleJ the sale, and the multitude heeded
h ? m ' FOR behold, said he, the highest bidder Adi become.Jhe
How much therefore will ye give for it.
AND one C'chin laid :

THEN behold the multitude swarmed into the Palace to
purchase the stolen goods and chattels that had not been re-
stolen from the Palace, and many called out for Matthias, the
prince of prigs, usurper of the Palace.
AND a rough fisherman called out: Why do you call for
Matthias when he is in gaol.
AND the multitude called out: Long may he stay there.
THEN did they walk all through the Palace, into all the
bed-chambers, into the tower, into the billiard-room, and into all
the rooms, and gazed curiously upon the stolen chattels therein.
AND behold there were women there in great numbers, and
thieves took away their purses.
AND 10, one woman who had had stolen from her a purse of
�S lifted up her voice and wept. And to her friends she said : I
was told before I came hither that the place was called Fraudville,
and behold I was told truly.
AND it came to pass that a well known medico, believing
that Matthias had rolled up many thousand talents of gold in a
napkin and had buried them in the earth, took a spade and dug
many days all around the palace, but could not find what he
thought Matthias had planted.
AND Gemmell, Tuckett & Co. sold all the goods and chattels
in the place, and obtained altogether for them 1,500 talents ot
gold, and the place fell to the hands of the Philistines, but 10, the
beautiful things of the Palace were distributed among many, and
were scattered as before a great wind, to the four quarters of the
earth.
CHAPTER VI.
to his Directors who dwelleth in South Mel-
bourne?Peace be unto you all, more particularly Marshall
and Gray.
HE that hath ears to hear let him hear.
AND from Joseph Stead, one of the tribe of Larkin?s Society
?who was my faithful friend, and whom I dearly loved I have
so basely robbed him of his peace of mind. *
I HAVE also helped to ease him of some superfluous cash
which I have scattered and squandered God knows how.
LIE, with all the tribe, hath worshipped and idolised me as a
prince and a ruler among men.


BEHOLD, I have endeavoured to distribute my favors
eauitably amongst the followers of the tribe. And one of the
elders, named Gray, a son of the tribe of Slater, stood fore
as a lamb, and trusted me accordingly. I sharpened up y
shears and fleeced him before the eyes of the elders. And his
fleece weighed heavily.
And the elders, who had been pretending to watch the
movements of Matthias, said unto him. e o , ? A
mightiest of the mighty, thy operating hand hath a charm,
aliened out with a loud voice : Wilt thou operate on u .
AND Marshall, another of the elders, and one of the tribe: of
Caxton said unto Matthias : Behold, I t
desires to be shorn ; but thou must remember that my fleece
of shorter growth, and not of the same density as my brot er,
elder Gray.
AND Matthias said unto this elder; Bill, if thy be
carefully scoured before shearing it will yield heavi
canst imagine. Give unto me carte blanche upon thy Savings
Bank account, and I will perform a miracle.
AND Bill, the elder, did as he was bad, and received the
wisdom, honor, glory and blessing of Matthias.
ANOTHER of the elders, by name Heather, one of
of Library, a son of Cricket, fell down before the great Matt ,
and begged to be a participator m the rich spoils -h
dispensing in. .
AND Matthias said: Truly if I do bestow mine favor upon
thine head, thou must be a faithful and dutiful steward m.M me.
Thou must hearken unto me, and stand firml> y
Council table.
AND the son of Cricket answered, and said : Matthias, t y
will be done. , ,
AND so it came to pass this lamb lay down and was shorn,
and ids fleece carefully weighed and placed on the shearing table.
AND Matthias called out in a loud voice: Teddy, thy fleece
has turned oufby far the best. But then thou art the youngest
lamb, and the growth more vigorous.
AT the close of the shearing Matthias laid himself down to
rest, aid being weary and fatigSed. soon fell into a peaceful
slumber. . ,
AND behold in his slumbers his Satanic Majesty* w � wa
ever at his elbow, appeared unto him, saying: ? er here-
borne unto great things. Thou must no longer slumber here


be up at once, and appear before the whole tribe of South Mel-
bourne. Thou hast done great things, but those are nought to
what thou wilt do. &
AND Matthias answered and said: Satan, lam thy slave ?
command, and I will obey.
AND it came to pass that Satan said unto Matthias : Thou
must play thy cards at the Council, in order that thou mayst gain
name, fame, and popularity.
AND Matthias said unto Satan: Behold, Satan, if I could
only get the War Horse, a son of Cyclops, one of the tribe of
auctioneers into my confidence, all would go right.
T Satan answered and said : Matthias, leave that to me
The Old Horse is a downy card, but I will work the oracle by
giving him a tempting bait, and the rest will be made easy.
THEN did Matthias prick up his ears, and say unto Satan :
u? l and /f the 01d Horse m y soci ety will advance him gold
bnght gold, on the York-street property; and I will so manipulate
the books that he will never be called upon to pay either interest
or capital.
AND it came to pass that the Old Horse did get gold, and
was not called upon to pay either capital or interest, and he did
always sit upon the left hand of Matthias at the Council and
supported him through thick and thin. ?
CHAPTER VII.
B U T beh � ld as time rolled on ? Matthias, much to his discom-
fort, became alive to the fact that he was not gaining
strength, and again sought the counsels of Satan.
AND Satan responded to the call of duty, and hearkened
unto the woes of Matthias, and then retired to think.
? � ND � atan f hou S ht well > and whispered into the ears of
Matthias : What about Boyd, one of the sons of Cleaver couldst
thou but do his people a graceful act, he would ever swear bv
thee. 3
AND Matthias answered and said : Verily, verily, do I say
unto thee that Boyd hath known me, boy and man, these thirty-
five years, and will stand by me as firm as the Rock of Ages.
THEREFORE did Satan bid Matthias sit down and discuss
the situation j and they both thought and spake seriously.


AND Satan commanded Matthias to Bet8 et P�? 1 d s ? n ht � f s b of
Society to lend moneys to Mtsses and A Boyd, dang
Cleaver, on a terrace of cottages in Wngh
unto �� "^^hea^l

coffers.
AND the days went on; weeks and months passed away,
but no^day was ever known to take place between
the maidens and Matthias Society.
? THF son of Cleaver, in conjunction with War Horse, were
always die strongest supporters cit Matthias at the Counctl. and
this sorely puzzled and perplexed the multitude.
AND at sundry and divers times hath the son of Cleaver
Stood beL the multitude and declared with trumpet tongue that
all the people should call Matthias blessed. # .
AND the son of Cleaver acted as a messenger ; and m join-

AND the days went on. a

AND it remained so until the funds of the institution would
not hold out any longer, and then Matthias threw up t e spong
and the bubble burst.
AND behold three kings of the opposing tribe of depositors:
Dodds Shaw and Boyd (not the son of Cleaver) gained the con-
fidence of all their tribe, and took Matthias sorely to task, so
much so that they were able to cast him into prison.
AND whilst he remained in prison, the books of the institu-
tion were examined by an expert, which revealed the disclosures
of this and preceding chapters.


CHAPTER VIII.
A ND it came to pass that the Hillites divided themselves into
various tribes, which afterwards became known as the Lark-
inites, Grayites, Marshallites, Boydites, Millsites, and numerous
other ites, and they were henceforth known as the kings of their
various tribes.
AND the king of the Grayites, one bright morning in
November, 1891, rose early, and approached the king of the tribe
of Larkinites. and begged him to protect his interests in the
scramble that must inevitably take place shortly. Ihe Grayite
briefly said: Thou knowest, O Larkinite, that I have made
myself responsible for vast sums in building up thy palace, now
known to fame as ? Fraudville,? and I do beseech thee to give
me some preference over others.
AND the king of Larkinites said ; Wherefore thou art great,
0 Grayite, more so than other kings, that I will stand by thee.
1 have never forgotten the words thou gavest utterance to on the
9th of May, 1889, that if thou ?should?st desire a son it would
be such an one as me.?
AND the king of the Grayites spake up, and said: Then
thou, O king of hosts, will do my bidding. I only spake as
I felt on that memorable night.
AND the king of the Larkinites paid due attention to the
demands of the Grayites, and said that if the king of the Mar-
shallites would put his glasses to his blind eye and witness his
signature, he would transfer propert) in Young-street that
originally belonged to Scanlan for the benefit of the tribe of the
Grayites.
THEN did the king of the Grayites vouch that the king of
the Marshallites required only to be commanded to do so. and
he would accordingly obey the command.
AND it came to pass that the king of the Marshallites did as
he was commanded, and the property was forthwith transferred
jO the king of the Grayites.
AND 10, the king of the Grayites, having possession of the
transfer, journeyed without loss of time to the Titles Office, and
had it accordingly registered on the following morning.
AND the musty volumes in that sanctuary shows that another
title was issued to the king of the Grayites, declaring him, before
the whole world, to be the registered proprietor.
WHEN all this was done the king of the Marshallites ap-
proached the king of the Larkinites, and bade him extend his
mercies, saying : Mat! oh Mat! hast thou still got those 10 acres


of land at Gisborne that I transferred to thee on the 13th Decem-
ber, 1889.
AND the king of the Larkinites answered the Marshallite
that he had, an 1 that he would re-transfer the same to him.
AND it so came to pass that the 10 acres left the possession
of the king of the Larkinites, and the king of the Marshallites
stood once more possessed of his country block of land.
AND the musty volumes also record the fact that the Mar-
shallite put on all steam in journeying to the Titles Office to have
the same registered.
AND all were happy until it occurred to the king of the
Grayites that there was just a possibility that things might not
appear as safe as what they seemed. He reasoned that should
the king of the Larkinites be compelled to seek the protection
of the Insolvent Court, the transfer would be questioned.
AND it came to pass that the king of the Larkinites did file
his schedule, and this much concerned the king of the Grayites.
But the king of the Grayites had solved the problem, and decided
upon a plan that would defy all opposing claimants.
THUS did the king of the Grayites put on his considering
cap, and declared that the only safe cure would be to introduce
another king of the tribe of followers, and who would be sure to
work the oracle.
AND accordingly the new king was brought forth from the
wilderness of Rosedale, a dealer in ladies? garments, commonly
known as a draper, and carrying the high-sounding name of
John Green.
AND the king of the Grayites was observed to laugh and
chuckle in his sleeve when standing before the font, and christen-
ing this new king the king of the Greenites Behold, how strange,
said he, ?tis but a change in the color from Gray to Green.
AND, behold, a large and formidable document (now known
as vol. 2394, folio 478693) was prepared, setting forth that the
king of the Grayites did, at 2.13 p.m., on the 29th day of Decem-
ber, 1891, mortgage all that piece of land that he had so recently
stood possessed of, from the king of the Larkinites, unto the king
of the Greenites for the sum of �l2OO.
AND the formidable document being duly registered, nothing
more remained to be done but to notify the tenants that the
king of the Grayites was the possessor of the property and de-
manded the rents.
But 10, an evil hour had come unto the kings of the Grayites
and the Greenites. Two warriors, Baragwanath and Fraser, rose


up and told the tenants that the rents must he paid unto them
for the benefit of the unfortunate creditors.
AND it is now recorded that a great war is raging between
the warriors and the king of the Grayites as to who shall stand
possessed of the property, and the multitude will in due time be
apprised as to the rightful owner through the medium of the
Supreme Court.


TRIAL OF LARKIN & CLEARY.
T ONG before the arrival of the ? Black Maria.? with its living
freight, consisting of Larkin and Cleary, a vast multitude
of people filled the large quadrangle to catch a glimpse of the
worthy pair, that have been awaiting their trial since the 17th
December last, for conspiring to defraud the funds of the South
Melbourne Building Society. About twenty minutes to ten
? Maria ? arrived, and the pair left the carriage, being braceletted
together. They were soon hurried along the corridor to the cell
beneath the dock, and then temporarily lost to the gaze of an
excited crowd. Many were the remarks heaved from the young
and old of both sexes, and if the culprits had been let loose the
exasperated crowd would have torn them to pieces. Indeed, one
poor old man who said he had in his old age been reduced to
poverty by their peculations, said he would freely do seven years
to have the opportunity of silencing Mat Larkin for ever. The
scene upon the opening of the Court was evidence that public
excitement had not abated. The front row of the large gallery
was occupied by ladies, who remained in the Court all day.
The presentment, which contains 21 Overt Acts, and which
we give in extenso, was read over to the prisoners on Friday last,
26th inst., and to the astonishment of many both Larkin and
Cleary pleaded, in a clear voice, NOT GUILTY !
Upon their names being called by the Associate, both
prisoners ascended the steps and entered the spiked dock.
Larkin was the first to make his debut, and his companion Cleary
soon followed in the rear. Larkin was scrupulously attired, great
pains being taken in putting on a fine glossy finish on his linen,
whilst the shire cuffs stood out a pink of neatness below the
sleeve of his coat Apparently he had a brand new rig, thinking,
no doubt, that there is nothing like a smart turnout to fetch judge
and jury. Cleary, on the other hand, did not look so prim. He
appeared to have an uneasy and unsettled look, as if the position
he was placed in had been working on his mind. Remarks were
freely passed one to another as the pair faced the crowd. The
general opinion was that Larkin had improved much upon the
discipline he had been subjected to during his incarceration. His


enforced denial of the celebrated brands of Moet, Roederer, King
or Cliquet, having restored his appearance to that remembered by
some of his former companions.
THE COUNSEL ENGAGED.
Mr. C. B. Finlayson, instructed by the Crown Solicitor and
Messrs. Braham and Pirani, prosecuted on behalf of the Crown.
Mr. W. E. Johnston, instructed by Mr. Day (of Messrs
Gillott, Croker, Snowden and Co.), appeared to defend the
prisoner Larkin.
Sir Bryan O?Loghlen, QC, instructed by David Gaunson
(of Gaunson and Wallace), appeared to defend Cleary.
Sir Bryan had for his junior, Mr. Dunckley, an old school-
mate of Cleary?s, who came from St. Arnaud to give his assistance.
THE JURY.
The empannelling of the jury took a very considerable time,
and no less than 33 men were challenged. Of these the Crown
challenged 10, Cleary 11, and Larkin 12. At last, however, the
jury was empannelled, and the undermentioned were the jury-
men :
Charles E. Sinn, Beach-street, Port Melbourne, fruiterer.
James Kerwick, Ivan-street, North Fitzroy, tailor.
George Denton, Buckley-street, Footscray, storekeeper.
James G. Holden, Capel-street, North Melbourne, steward.

Neil Butterley, Graham street, Port Melbourne, bricklayer.
Richard Hall, Chestnut-street, Richmond, stable keeper.
John Scully, Dudley-street, Melbourne, driver.
William Dean, Buncle-street, Hotham Hill, laborer.
John Delaney, Union-street, Brunswick, laborer,

The latter gentleman was elected foreman.

OPENING THE CASE.
The Crown Prosecutor?s Address.
Mr. Finlayson, opening the case on behalf of the Crown,
said the facts were few and simple, and, although it might be
necessary to call 20 or 25 witnesses, their evidence would be
mostly of a formal character. Larkin was connected with this
society from its formation in 1875, and was then a member of the
committee. In 1877 the services of the then secretary were dis-
pensed with, and Larkin was appointed to the position, and from
that time to August, 1889, the end of the period of the alleged
conspiracy, he continued to act as secretary. The duties of the
secretary, as defined by the rules, were to attend all the meetings,
sign cheques, have the custody of the common seal, documents
and so on. The business of the society was very large and ex-
tensive, and was transacted by the society under the supervision
of a committee ; but in this and other similar societies the secre-
tary had much larger powers than those which usually fell on sec-
retaries of ordinary institutions. He had the power of affixing the
seal, in the presence of the president of the society or of the
solicitor, and he had the power of signing cheques, which had to
be countersigned by two members of the committee. Larkin was
a man in whom the committee had confidence, and no doubt they
allqwed him to perform his duties with less supervision probably
than they would have exercised over a younger man, or a man of
less prominent position and standing. Larkin also carried on the
business of auctioneer and land agent, and Cleary assisted him in
that business and also in the business of the society, although he
was not in the employment ot the institution. This society had
what were called borrowing shares, and on the 4th of March,
1888, a documem was received purporting to have been received


by an officer of the society ?Larkin?and purporting* to be an
application for a loan by one Patrick Cleary, sen. The ap-
plication was correctly filled up, and described the property as
being situated in Howe-crescent, South Melbourne, and was
for 60 shares, or, in other words, for an advance of
Although the document purported to be by Cleary, the whole of
the document, including the signature of ? Cleary,? was in the
handwriting of Larkin. The ordinary course with such an appli-
cation was to refer it to the survey committee and then to the
solicitor, and then for it to come before the society, but the ap-
plication did not come before the society until two months after
its date, viz., on May 2. On March 13 ?before the application
came before the society?a cheque for filled up by Cleary
and signed by Larkin, was presented to two of the committee
without any authority from them, and signed by them. In these
two facts would be traced an acting together of the prisoners, and
Larkin must have known that this had never been passed
or authorised by the society The next cheque was dated 20th
March for and this was filled, signed and given under
the same circumstances, without authority, as the cheque for
�IOO. Why did the committee countersign a cheque for which
there was no authority ? The only reply that could be given was
that the committee had the utmost confidence in Larkin. This
might be wrong on the part of the committee, but he (Mr.
Finlayson) was not going to express an opinion. They might
be lax, perhaps criminally lax ; but that could be no answer to the
charge. On the contrary, it put Larkin?s conduct in a worse
light, because he must have known that unless he had had the
full confidence of the committee?unless he could use the com-
mittee as tools ?the transactions could never have taken place.
Larkin took advantage of his position and of his knowledge
of the committee. Here was �I6OO advanced by the committee
without any application having been submitted to them; and
further, at the time the charges were signed, the Howe-crescent
property did not belong to Cleary; he had not a sixpence worth of
interest in it. As a fact, Cleary was* only in negotiation with the
owner, Mrs. Corrie, for the property; so that he obtained
without any security whatever. The negotiation, however, fell
through, and Cleary refunded the society For some
reason or other he retained the �IOO, which, as it was never
returned, must have gone into either Larkin?s or Cleary?s pocket.
Thus matters stood on the 20th March. On the 2nd of May, the
business sheet, in the handwriting of Larkin, to be submitted to
the committee, contained the application of ?P. Cleary, sen.? ?
although the application was that of P. Cleary?for 1500 and
That was the legitimate course through which the ap-


plication should have gone before any advance was made at all.
The applications were passed, and the cheques subsequently
signed by the committee. The next step, after the application,
should have been to send it to the survey committee to be
reported on, but in this instance a committee?s report was drawn
up in the handwriting of Larkin, dated 6th March, 1888, valuing
the property at and giving all particulars, but not signed
by any surveyor. Members of the survey committee would say
they never knew anything about the property at all. At the
last moment, however, Larkin did not venture to submit the
document to the survey committee for signature, so that on the
2nd of May they had the general committee approving of some-
thing they knew nothing about. The second cheque was one given
to Cleary for and dated April 14, a fortnight before
anything had been before the society, without any surveyor?s
report, solicitor?s endorsement, and, as a matter of fact, without
Cleary being in possession of any property. This was
practically a renewal of the previous cheque which had been
returned by Cleary, and a receipt was given by Cleary in the
name of some person purporting to be Patrick Cleary, sen. That
cheque was paid by Cleary to Hurry and Major, the solicitors, who
then got Mrs. Corrie to execute a transfer to the South Melbourne
society of the property' in question. Such a transfer ought to
have been sealed with the seal of the society, but the society knew
nothing whatever of Mrs. Corrie, and before the seal was fixed
by the solicitor he should have examined the title and reported
on it, and have had the authority of the committee to the trans-
action. Everything, however, was wanting. The seal was fixed
by Larkin in the presence of the solicitor without the knowledge
of the society ; and the transfer, which should have been signed
before the money was paid to Cleary, was lodged, or should
have been lodged, in the strong-room of the society. At the
beginning of the month of May �1,600 was obtained, with which
the property was bought, and the property was transferred to
the society. And now, without making any application or send-
ing in plans and specifications and so forth, as the rules demanded,
Larkin and Cleary commenced to build on this land, and 11
cheques, amounting to �2, 322 is. nd., were advanced to Cleary
for this purpose, without the authority of the society in any shape
or form. Receipts were regularly given by Cleary; but the two
members of the committee who signed the cheques never au-
thorised them, nor had they any application for them. And of
this �2322 is. xid., only actually went on the building,
and must have actually gone into the pockets of Larkin
and Cleary. Unless these two men had acted in concert this
money could not have been obtained from the society. Re-


turning to the history of the Howe-crescent property, after the
transfer was presumably lodged in the society?s strong-room, the
next step in the drama was a sale of the property, or half of it,
on June 25th, 1888, without the authority of the committee.
No interest or instalments had been paid on the advance, and
yet the prisoners went on to sell to one James Redfearn for
what was really the property of the society. The seal
was affixed by Larkin in the presence of the solicitor; and he
(Mr. Finlayson) could hardly conceive a solicitor assisting at a
transfer for which there was not a scrap of authority. That
money, though dishonestly obtained, was honestly applied to the
reduction of Cleary?s indebtedness to the society. The last act
in the drama was on the 30th July, 1889, when, without any
communication with the society, the remaining half of the property
was sold for To whom ? To Patrick Cleary. Leaving
out interest and fines and every other consideration, Cleary was
indebted in the sum of 18s. ; and yet for � 1600 he
obtained the transfer, signed by Larkin, and the seal affixed as
before. Not a farthing of that �I6OO was paid to the reduction
of Cleary?s account. That transfer should never have been
removed from the strong-room. On the 31st July this very pro-
perty was mortgaged to Mr. Murray Smith for �I BOO, so that
the mortgage must have been secured before Cleary purported to
buy the property for and Larkin knew of all this. If a
mortgage was got for /1800 they might depend upon it that the
property was worth a third more; and Larkin must have known
that it was worth odd. Having robbed the society of this
transfer, not a penny of the went to reduction of Cleary?s
account. There was a savings bank branch of the society,
wffiere small sums were received on deposit. No overdrafts were
allowed, but Larkin allowed Cleary to overdraw to the extent of
/1473 IS 4ck On the 31st of July, the da) of the mortgage,
and the day when the auditors would be at the savings bank, the
whole of the was put in the savings bank to Cleary?s ac-
count. That money should really have gone to the borrowing
account. Whether Larkin was concerned in the savings bank or
not, he (Mr, Finlayson) could not say; but would a secretary
allow a clerk in his office to overdraw to that amount unless he
had some interest, or would he have allowed that money to be
appropriated to the account unless he had some benefit ?
DIVIDED IN THEIR HOUR OF TRIAL.
On the application of Sir Bryan O?Loghlen, Cleary was
permitted to take his seat alongside of Mr. David Gaunson, his
attorney. During the address of the Crown Prosecutor both
accused had taken voluminous notes of the proceedings. The
charges against them were followed with much interest by both.


Larkin, for whom no such application was made, stood in the
dock behind the spikes, and occasionally glanced at Cleary as he
lounged on the comfortable leather cushions. As the time pro-
gressed he essayed to sit down, but Mr. jailer soon came upon
the scene and ordered him to stand up, which it is needless to say
he complied with.
THE EVIDENCE.
Joseph Stead, South Melbourne, gentleman, examined by
Mr. Finlayson, said. I was a member ot the committee of the
society, and became president in 1888. I joined the society in
1877, in August of which year Larkin was appointed secretary. 1
never knew of the application for the by Cleary until the
commencement of these proceedings. Whatever cheques were
presented to me by Larkin or Cleary I signed.
To Mr. Johnston. ?I presume at your meetings it was custo-
mary to read the minutes of the preceding meetings ??Yes.
On May 2, 1888, there is an entry to Cleary ? Yes.
To Sir Bryan O?Loghlen. ?I was present at the meeting on
the 2nd of May, and I see the entry of �IOO to Cleary. I signed
the minutes containing those entries of the and the 100.
At the meetings the secretary read the minute book of the finance
committee, which contained the items referred to as passed. The
previous meeting of the committee had been on March 7, and on
May 2 advances amounting to �47 1 000 were passed.
If those entries were read out how is it you did not know
anything about them ? ?I have no recollection of them.
At the time you may have known everything about them ??-I
knew nothing of the advanced to Cleary.
That is you don?t remember??No. _
Would that entry pass without inquiry ? ?lt might; probably
half the entries would be passed in that way.
How was it you confirmed them ??Because they were read
out by the secretary, and they had been checked by the finance
committee. . , , . ~ ,
In the interval between the meetings had the secretary acted
as the company ??Not to my knowledge.
You had signed those cheques six weeks and two months be-
fore they came before the committee, and he was paying them ?
Not without the sanction of the committee. ~
Did not Larkin receive applications and deal with them.
Not without the sanction of the committee. It would be im-
possible to say whether other cheques had already been paid to a
large number of people besides Cleary on the 2nd of May.
Was that not the practice ? ?No, it was not.
Would you be surprised to know that a number of those
cheques were signed before that date. Here is C. P. Counsel,


cheques signed by you on April 9. Was it for an advance
on property??lt was. If it was, it ought not to have been.
Was not Larkin practically the society, and did he not do
everything? Did you not trust him ??I trusted him as much as
one friend could trust another.
And whatever he told you to do you did ??Oh, no.
Did you not sign a cheque to Counsel for on the 9th
of April ? ?I could not say.
And the same with an advance of to one Roach ??I
could not say.
Were not the cheques signed away before ever the committee
met? ?Never to my knowledge.
Did you ever inquire into them at all ?- -I did occasionally.
Will you say that on May 2 you did not pass a sum of
and that the cheque was not signed four days before ??I could
not say.
And as to another advance of xJioo ??I could not say.
Did you make any inquiry as to any cheques ??I could not
say as to what cheques inquiries were made.
How was the society carried on between March 7 and May 2 ?
?I suppose it went on in its usual way.
There are items amounting to odd, and you know
nothing about them ? ?I may have known about them at the time,
but I don?t recollect now.
What did the other directors do in connection with those
advances ??The finance committee met once a month before the
ordinary committee meeting.
But this time you did not meet for two months ??I do not
know the reason.
The savings bank branch was a very small affair, or
? ?Yes.
Do you know the South Suburban Land Company ? ?Yes. I
was chairman of that company.
Did that company ever overdraw its account at the savings
bank ? ?Not to my knowledge.
But you would sign the cheques ? ?But I did not know of
any overdraft at the savings branch.
What bank were the South Suburban cheques on ? ?The
English and Scottish Bank.
* But had they no account with the South Melbourne Building
Society ??I think they borrowed an amount from it.
??Yes ; but they had no current account.
Had they not a current account beyond the ??I
don?t know that.
* Do"you know anything about it at all ??I don?t know that
they had a'current account.


But you were president and a large shareholder of the South
Suburban Company ? ?I don?t know that they had a current ac-
count.
Would you be surprised to hear that they were over-
drawn at the savings bank ??I never knew they had a penny in
the savings bank.
Did you never hear of it before now ??No,
Never ? ?No.
Did you ever look at the books of the savings bank??No,
sir. I never examined the books of the savings bank branch.
Did you ever examine the books of the company ? ?I looked
at them occasionally.
Were they not open to you ??Yes.
Had you not the books of the savings bank branch at the
committee meetings of the Building Society?? No. I did not see
them.
Then ,�20,000 or �30,000 might have been advanced by
that branch and the committee know nothing about it ??-Well, I
don?t know ?they might. I never knew of �9OO overdrawn, or
that the Suburban Company had a current account.
Did you supervise the society in any shape or form ? Did
you look after it in any way ? ?I frequently had conversations with
the secretary, but I never minutely examined the books.
You looked on the secretary as the society??l had con-
fidence in Larkin.
And whatever he did was right??l did not always agree
with what he did.
Mr. Finlayson. ?Whatever you did or did not know about
the Suburban Land Company, you did not know that Cleary had
an overdraft on the savings bank ??No.
Edward D, Heather, a member of the committee of the
society for about nine years, said ?I was never aware of the trans-
fer and the re-transfer of the Howe-crescent property, or that ad-
vances had been on that property, or that Cleary had an overdraft
on the savings bank. Three of the eleven cheques produced were
signed by me, but I did not know they were advances on the
Howe crescent property.
How came you to sign those cheques ? ?Because they had
been signed by the president.
In whose handwriting was the entry of Cleary?s application
for �l5OO ??Larkin?s, I believe, but the handwriting of Larkin
and Cleary are very similar. In some of the other documents
connected with the Howe-crescent transactions I could not say
whether the handwriting is that of Larkin or Cleary, but there are
others which I can identify.
By Mr. Johnston. ?I was not aware of the fact that Cleary


had got the and the until the criminal proceedings
commenced.
What is your business ??I am secretary of the South Mel-
bourne Cricket Club and of the South Melbourne Mechanics?
Institute and of the Free Library.
What other offices do you hold ? I am secretary of several
other clubs and things.
Do the finances of these bodies pass through your hands ?
Yes.
Were you a member of the finance committee of the Building
Society?? Yes; our duties were to see that we had receipts for
cheques paid away.
And therefore you must have seen Cleary?s receipts for these
cheques ??ln passing such a large number of accounts we did not
look closely at all the receipts.
Do you mean to say you did not look to see what the money
was for ? ?I did not.
To Sir Bryan O?Loghlen.?On May 2 the finance committee
checked the cheque blocks with the receipts ??lt was my duty to
take the blocks, Mr. Fraser taking the receipts, and the other
member of the committee the book. The and the
are mentioned in the book, and I have no doubt they were before
us at the meeting on May 2.
You made no inquiry as to where the went??l did
Would Cleary?s receipts be the receipts produced at that
meeting ??I think so.
Did you ever inquire what any of the other cheques were for ?
?What the committee did was to check the blocks with the re-
ceipts.
Did you ever make any inquiry ??lf I was in doubt I did.
Did you make any inquiry about those items in question ??I
did not. I was satisfied so long as I had receipts for the cheques.
How was the society to go on in the two months between the
meetings of the committee ? Could the survey committee pay
away without the consent of the full committee ??I believe there
is a minute to the effect that the survey committee can advance
three-fourths of the amount.
Is that in accordance with the rules ??I cannot say that it is.
And were such advances ever made ??I believe so.
Was it the'practice of Larkin to pay away money and get the
committee?s sanction afterwards ??Only in emergency cases.
That is, where the party wanted money ??Yes.
And the sanction was obtained afterwards ??Yes,
Were you aware of overdrawn accounts in the savings bank ?
I was not.


Why, what did the finance committee do ??Ever since there
was a finance committee all they did was to see there were receipts
for the cheques paid away.
What did you do with the savings bank account ? ?See that
we had receipts for money paid away.
Are you a member of the South Suburban Land Company ?
Yes.
That company had an advance from the building society ?
I know nothing about that, not being a member of the committee
of the company.
Did you know they borrowed �5OOO from the building so-
ciety??No, I did not.
When did you first hear of the overdrawn account ? ?This
morning.
William Marshall, a member of the committee, said he also
was a member of the Suburban Land Company, but until that day
he knew of no overdraft from the building society?s savings bank.
Corroborative and formal evidence was given by John Dur-
ham, C. J Durham, Thomas William Swindley, Thomas Smith,
M.L.A., and John Danks, members of the committee ; John
Petherick, ex-committeeman; Patrick Derham, clerk in Larkin?s
office ; W. Bird Jacobs, estate agent ; John Arthur Armstrong,
and James Swift, manager of the Commercial Bank, South Mel-
bourne.
Mr. Fraser, a member of the committee, in answer to Sir
Bryan O?Loghlen, said that after August, 1889, Cleary handed
certain securities to him.
John Lord, jun., clerk to Mr. A. D. J. Daly, solicitor to the
building society, said he had often witnessed the affixing of the seal.
Mr. Finlayson.?You have witnessed the affixing of the seal ?
?I mean I was often in the office when it was witnessed.
Was it ever affixed without Mr. Daly?s presence ? ?Certainly it
was.
What ? Attested after it was put on ??He attested it. He
was not supposed to be in.
Do you mean to tell me that you have seen the seal attested
by Daly without its being affixed in his presence ??I have.
And attested by him after it was affixed ? ?Yes. He attested
the signature of the secretary.
He does not, sir. He attests the affixing of the seal ? ?Well,
it is a common practice.
I trust not in any other office ? ?I know another.
Herbert Kertz, managing clerk to Smith, Emmerton and
Johnston, solicitors, gave evidence as to the mortgage of a portion
of the Howe-crescent property to Mr. Murray Smith and another
by Cleary on the 31st July, 1889.


Arthur D. J. Daly, one of the solicitors to the South Mel-
bourne Building Society in 1888 and 1889, was examined by Mr.
Finlayson.
Was the seal of the transfer from Mrs. Corrie to the South
Melbourne Building Society affixed in your presence??l cannot
say from the length of time that has expired ; but I believe it was.
What does the attestation say ??The attestation says that
the seal was affixed by Mr. Larkin and attested by me.
Was the seal of the society affixed to the transfer to Redfearn
in your presence ??lt was attested by me.
Is the transfer of the property from the society to Cleary
attested by you ? ?lt is attested by me.
In that transaction, for whom were you acting ??I must
have been acting for both parties.
Before the seal was fixed did you satisfy yourself as to the
consideration ??I cannot remember just now.
Surely you must know whether you saw the ?I
cannot remember.
Were you acting in the matter of the mortgage to Messrs.
Cooper and Murray Smith from Cleary? The witness of
Cleary?s signature is my managing conveyancing clerk, and I
have no doubt I was acting for him.
Did you receive the proceeds of the mortgage ? ?I cannot
remember.
The witness was not cross-examined.
George Gray, architect, gave evidence as to preparing plans
for the buildings on the Howe-crescent property.
To Sir Bryan O?Loghlen.?The cost of the buildings was
� 1799 15s-
Robert H. Howard, builder, said he contracted to erect the
buildings planned by the last witness for Cleary. Witness re-
ceived something over for the work.
To Sir Byran O?Loghlen ?He used to consult Cleary about
the work at the office of the society.
William Simpson, accountant, said ?I was engaged for some
time investigating the affairs of the society.
Mr. Finlayson.?Excepting the minute' of the 2nd May is
there any reference in the books to the Howe-crescent pro-
perty or to advances to Cleary??No, except the amount in
the finance committee?s report.
And that, too, is on the 2nd May ? ?Yes.
What was the state of Cleary?s account on the 30th
July, 1889? Bs. 2d. debit balance.
What was the amount exclusive of interest and fines ?
l3s. 1 id.
What is the date of Cleary?s last transaction with the


society ? The last transaction was a credit or receipt of money
by the society, 18th May, 1891, �2\.
What is the balance of indebtedness, exclusive of fines ?
2352 tBs.
What was the state of Cleary?s savings bank account on
the 30th July, 1889?? A debit balance of /1473 is. 4d.
Was there a payment made on the following day?? Yes,
/1786 was received by the society, leaving a credit balance of
lBs. Bd.
To Sir Bryan O?Loghlen. Cleary is debited with -�3 lOO in
March and April, 1888?? Yes.
On the credit side there is an entry of ?Yes;
posted after the 16th July.
Have you traced the transaction ??The society did receive
I s��-
The was practically returned?? Yes,
And then a cheque given again for ??Yes.
So that up to July 31, 1889, there had really been ad-
vanced only � 1600 ??Yes ; until the other cheques for
and so on.
Before the year closed on July 31 what was paid to Cleary?s
3s. and �4 3s
Cleary is said to have robbed this �l6OO. Now he has
paid What was the balance against him at that date??
l4s.
In the succeeding year there were a number of payments
made on account of the building ??They were not all on account
of the building.
Have you not heard it alleged that they were paid for the
builder ??The money was abstracted from the society
lam not talking about that. Have you heard it alleged
that they were paid for the builder ? Well, I will take it another
way. Have you not found that Larkin was the society ??No.
Have you not found that large sums of money were advanced
before being sanctioned by the committee ??Yes, many.
For all purposes, and entered in the books ??Yes.
There is no secrecy about them ??They appear in the
books.
Have you heard that these payments were for the building
purposes ??No ; I traced the money to the builder.
What credit is there to Cleary after the 31st July, 1888 ?
�s 2 � 13s. Bd., on the 28th July, 1890. It has been some
other sum at some other date It might be �330 altered to
�320, but I cannot say what the date is.
Has the society credited Cleary for that sum in any writ ?
I have not heard of any writ.


What other items are there besides the ?There is
nothing until 15th December, 1890, when there are 6s.
(repayments), and �177 14s. 6d (fines) on the credit side.
Is not fines another name for interest on advances made ? ?I
think it is, and these fines appear to amount to about 9 per cent.
Up to April 20, 1891, the total of Cleary credits came to
.somewhere about �603 17s. nd. ?Yes.
You have said that these fines were in effect interest charged
on advances ??lt was charged, but never paid, and went on in-
creasing year by year. The number of fictitious debits increased
from > ear to year.
As a fact, was not interest charged on accounts in those books
in the place of fortnightly repayments ? ?lnterest was charged on
numbers of suras which had no existence as assets.
Has interest been charged on debit balances in the books ?
There are many debit balances charged with interest once a year,
nine per cent, and some ten.
His Honor ?Do you say you found no authority in the rules
or the minutes for such a procedure ? ?None whatever, your
Honor.
Sir Bryan O?Loghlen,?Were they not empowered to advance
money on freehold and leasehold property, and to vary the terms
and conditions of such loans ? ?I know there is such a rule.
Where the accounts of the society audited from time to time ?
?No, they have not been audited for years.
Was any process gone through which was called auditing ??I
have heard so, but the process has not been gone through.
His Honor.?You have heard people say the process was gone
through ? ?Yes.
But you found no evidence of theprocess ??I found evidence
to the contrary. The process could not have been gone through.
Sir Bryan O?Loghien.?Are there no evidences in the books ;
no ticks, or anything?? There are some ticks, but the ledgers
have never been called over with the cash-book for years.
When did Cleary's savings bank account commence? ?In
1889.
Was it occasionally in debit in 1887 and 1888 ??lt was gene-
rally in debit.
What was his credit on July 9th, 1889? ?�800, but I believe
it is a fictitious credit. A debit was transferred to a credit 22
days before the balancing on the 31st July.
Why should he care for a balancing if there were no audit-
ing ? ?lf the shareholders found when the balance-sheet came
before them that the savings bank was in debit instead of credit, it
would open their eyes.
Look at July, 1890 ??Yes ; there was then the same process.


Was that published ??Details were not published.
Would that reason not apply to the succeeding year ??But
there were other entries at this period which counterbalanced the
effect.
These statements are suppositions of yours ? ?No, they are
not. They are demonstrable to people who understand books.
That is, you have satisfied yourself ??I would engage to
satisfy anyone who will take the trouble to go through the books.
Any one referring to the books would see it was very much
out ? ?They would.
Will you swear that the �BOO was not paid in by cheque on
the Commercial Bank ??I will not. I should have to trace where
they got the funds from at the Commercial Bank.
You have gone through Cleary?s private account at the Com-
mercial Bank ? ?I have had to refer to it.
Can you say this was not a cheque on that bank ? ?I cannot
say.
And yet you swear this �BOO is a sham credit?? Yes
Why do you say it is a sham credit ??Because at every
balancing time the same process of cooking the accounts had been
gone through for years.
How can you swear it is a sham credit when you did not
make inquiries ??My reasons are the period at which the entry is
made, and that although a credit was created it was all gone in a
day or two, leaving only �45 2s. rod. on the 31st July.
Was the account not constantly operated on like an ordinary
banking account, in and out of credit?? Yes. Very much out
and very little in !
David Braham, solicitor, deposed to having a conversation
with Cleary on the 7th December, 1891. Cleary said the bor-
rowers? account was in his handwriting, except the first three credit
entries, and that the society held no security for the balance. He
admitted the Howe-crescent property was the one the proceeds of
which had been paid to the savings bank account. He said his
father?s name was not Patrick.
This was the case for the prosecution.
Sir Bryan O?Loghlen submitted to His Honor that there was
no evidence to support several of the alleged overt acts, and these,
therefore, ought not to be considered by Tie jury,
Mr. Finlayson addressed the jury on the whole case.
Mr. Johnston addressed the Court on behalf of Larkin.
Sir Bryan O?Loghlen addressed the jury on behalf of Cleary.
THE JUDGE SUMS jUP.
His Honor Mr. Justice Hodges opened his address to the
jury 'at five minutes to 11. They had to deal with the prisoners


through what evidence they had heard in their presence. He
asked them in fairness to the prisoners, and in justice, to approach
the subject with free minds, and only on the evidence. The
prisoners were charged with conspiring together to cheat the
society out of money amounting to If they entertained a
doubt about the existence of the conspiracy it would
be their duty to acquit the prisoners, but the Crown had under-
taken to show that there was no reasonable doubt. To conspire
there must be two parties, and they could not convict one without
the other. His Honor then commented on the various ways in
which an agreement or an act of conspiracy could be proved. In
such cases they had generally to rely upon subsequent acts, and
it would be for the jury to say if the subsequent acts of the accused
showed them to be guilty of conspiring to defraud. The first act
relied upon was the application in Cleary's name, but in the hand-
writing of Larkin. Looking at that document alone it did not
affect Cleary at all, and was only evidence as against Larkin, and
even then of very little weight unless followed by subsequent acts.
The application was for 60 shares and contained a valuation on
which the loan was to be made. The valuation of the property in
Larkin?s writing was �I9OO ; but that valuation was not signed by
the survey committee. It therefore appeared that the properly
purchased at �I6OO was a few days afterwards valued by the sec-
retary to the society at �I9OO. The point as to whether it was
over-valued was of importance. The survey committee was
authorised to advance three fourths of the valuaxinn, and if it was
honest the �I9OO valuation was difficult to account tor. The next
act in the case was the contract of purchase signed ? P. Cleary.?
There was drawn a cheque for �IOO, which was used for the pur-
pose of paying a deposit upon the contract for the land. To that
cheque was attached Larkin?s signature, but the block was in the
writing of Cleary, who also gave a receipt signed ?* P. Cleary,
senior.? Here the accused were brought together. There was no
authority so tar as they had heard for the advance of the �IOO,
and though it was contended Cleary?s savings bank account was
then in credit, the �IOO was entitled to rank, not as payment of
money to which he was entitled, but as a loan to Cleary. It had
been contended that the accused could have taken the money, but
on the other hand the application would have been useful if the
directors had inquired about the loan. They next came to the
large amount, �ISOO, and there was evidence that both prisoners
were connected with it. The cheque was signed by Larkin, the
block was in Cleary?s writing, as well as the receipt signed
similarly to the other one, ? P. Cleary, senior,? who, so far as the
court was aware, was non-existent. Cleary?s father?s name was
not Patrick, and Cleary could not be P. Cleary, sen,, himself, or
he could not have signed ? for P. Cleary, senior.?


Sir Bryan interjected that there was was no evidence of this.
His Honor, continuing, said that if it was a fact that the
father?s name was Patrick Cleary, senior, then it was remarkable
that Patrick Cleary, senior, had not been called. They had Mr.
Braham?s evidence that Cleary?s father?s name was not Patrick.
The defence could easily have had the witness called if they chose,
and if such a person existed, then if was a material fact to be kept
back. It would be simply outrageous to allow material facts to
remain unspoken and statements uncontradicted of an important
character. It would have been better for Cleary that his father?s
name was Patrick, and had given him authority. It was an im-
portant fact if his father?s name was Patrick, for if it was so, then
it was not a non-existent person, but if this latest allegation was
true, why was the application merely ? P. Cleary,? and the receipt
for the money ?P. Cleary, for P. Cleary, senior.? The only evi-
dence they had was that Patrick Cleary, sen., was a fictitious per-
son. It would be a serious thing in the administration of justice if
the defence had a fact like that to prove, and did not prove it, be-
cause at the present moment they had no evidence that the father's
name was Patrick. Even if it was the name, what was the mean-
ing of this double dealing ? The facts indicated the existence of
an agreement between the two men. The general committee of
the society gave no authority whatever to the transaction ; they
signed the document as a matter of course. The real transaction
was the cheque for �ISOO. Up to the 14th April, when this
cheque was drawn out, there had been no sanction of the com-
mittee for the advance of this money or any part of it. On the
2nd of May there was an entry in the minute book, which showed
these applications in order, and that was passed by the committee.
But at that time the money was out of the hands of the society,
and into the hands of Cleary or Larkin. Moreover, the land had
been bought and transferred to the society. This showed, accord-
ing to the defence, that there was never any intention to defraud
the society, but the Crown said the transfer to the society was
made lest some awkward questions should be asked. The jurX
would have to say whether, though these transactions were very
irregular, they showed any dishonest intention. A number of ad-
vances were made to Cleary while these transactions were going
on, amounting to �2273, that His Honor did not think there was
one scrap of evidence whatever to make those advances. Not a
scrap, not a scrape, not a tittle of evidence. On the contrary,
there was evidence to show that the advances were in direct
conflict with the rules and principles of the society. There was
not a scrap of testimony to show that the usual forms regulating
advances were complied with. The surveyors had to certify that
the security was equal to 75 per cent of the advance, but they had
not a single surveyor?s report for this large sum of �2300. He
would ask their attention to one act which to a large extent was


consistent only with one mind, and that a mind of wrong. What
was that act??lt was in the presentment what was called the
eleventh overt act, and was the making of a cheque for �l5O, part
of the transactions arising out of the Howe-crescent property.
The cheque was signed in the ordinary way ; the block signature
was in Cleary?s handwriting. The receipt was given in Cleary?s
name by a clerk, and the amount was debited in the office to the
Howe-crescent property. Larkin?s name was on this document.
Cleary?s receipt was in the block in Cleary?s handwriting, and they
had evidence of the two parties being mixed up in this, and the
money going into the pockets of Larkin,. It did not go to the
builder or contractor ! Whyj wherefor, or for what purpose it went
into Larkin?s account there was no explanation whatever. He
(His Honor) had waited patiently to hear an explanation if the
transaction was honest; ff honest, it ought to be explained; and
if not explained then how could it be consistent with honesty.
There were the two taking money out of the society for their own
wants. 1 his was one of the amounts advanced by the society
which did not go to the builder, and there were other cheques of a
like character. Some evidence should have been given by the
defence on the subject, but it was clear that the money was not
being obtained in accordance with the rules. The act was one
utterly inexplicable, and they would be asked to say whether that
did not show the two were engaged in a common compact
to cheat the society out of the money. The whole building
cost �1670, and with architect?s commission �iqoo. The amount
passed was �2300, so that �ss� a t least of the amount received
was not spent on the building. Without any authoritative docu-
ments �2300 was passed, and �SOO did not go into the building.
�l5O of ic, without any circumlocution, went straight into Larkiffis
pocket. Then the property was mortgaged, and the proceeds of
the mortgage paid into Cleary?s account in the savings bank. It
was said the payment of the amount was evidence that Cleary did
not intend to defraud. It was evidence that he did not intend to
defraud the society in everything, but they might say he got the
money by fraud, and the payment of it back, did not alter the
way in which it was obtained. Even if he intended to pay the
money back, and the jury were satisfied the accused put their
heads together to get the money improperly, then it was conspiring
to get the money by fraud, no matter whether they were to pay it
back when rich. The fact remained that the society had lost its
money by fraudulent means. They knew very well at the time
they were not authorised to take the money, and if the jury thought
this was the case then they would find conspiracy. If there was
any doubt the accused should get the benefit of it. There were
acts of a bad color, which had not been explained. If they con-
spired, then the prisoners should be found guilty, if the jury
thought the prisoners knew the means taken to obtain the money


were unlawful. There must be no mere mistake, but clear fraud
and dishonesty.
His Honor concluded his address at ten minutes past 12
o?clock, and the jury then retired to consider their verdict.
At twenty minutes after four o?clock the jury were sent for
by His Honor, who said he had sent for them only because he
thought they had had reasonable time allowed them for discussion.
He thought it might assist them in their deliberation if they heard
some of the evidence in the case read over. His Honor desired
the subject to be fully discussed by the jury, and he did not want
to say that anyone of the jury should yield up a conscientious
conviction. If any man had a conviction that there was doubt so
far, he should stand by it, but if there was any part of the evidence
they would like to hear read, he would read it to them.
The foreman of the jury said that some of the jurors would
like to hear the evidence referring to the �l5O cheque read over.
That cheque was signed by Lari in, debited to Cleary in the
Howe-crescent property, and the money paid to Larkin?s account
at the bank.
In reply to the foreman His Honor said it did not appear
who had paid the cheques into Larkin?s account. It would be
difficult to suppose Cleary would pay that away without instructions.
A juror asked if it was possible the cheque of �l5O was a
mere return of money lent. His Honor remarked that it was
physically possible, but if it was a return for a loan, he supposed
some evidence would have been brought by the defence to prove
that it was so. The accused had an opportunity of making a
statement, but did not, neither was there any explanation of the
payment of the cheque other than that the cheque was drawn
apparently for the building, and was applied to Larkin?s own use.
His Honor reminded the jury that the suspense of the
prisoners was fearful, and if possible he would like a verdict after
fair and not obstinate discussion. He wanted them to do their best.
Just as the jury were leaving the box one of the jurors rose
and complained that just after the Crown Prosecutor concluded
his address, one of the jurors declared he was going straight for a
conviction. It was no use trying to argue against that sort of thing.
His Honor addressed the jury strongly on the point, and
urged that no man should be so unreasonable as not to weigh the
evidence generally.
At 6 p.m. they were sent for for the second time, and not
oeing able to agree, they were discharged. An intimation was
then given that Larkin and Cleary would be again tried at the next
Sessions.
In answer to an application for bail, His Honor fixed bail
for Larkin in three sureties of �lOOO each, and his own in �1000;
and for Cleary three sureties of �5OO each, and himself in �5OO.
