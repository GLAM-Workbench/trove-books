INTRODUCTION.
The City of Sydney, the capital of
New South Wales, is situate in the
county of Cumberland in 33 deg. 51 min.
41 sec. south latitude, and 10 h. 4 min.
36 sec. east longitude, and stands at the
head of Port Jackson, about six miles
from the entrance to the port. Under
an order in Council dated December 6th
1785, from the administration of Pitt,
Thomas Townshend, Viscount Sydney
being the principal Secretary for the
Colonies, the ‘ first fleet ’ consisting of
H.M.S. frigate ‘Sirius,’ Captain John
Hunter, H.M. armed tender ‘Supply,’
Lieut. Henry Lidgbird Ball, with three
store ships and six transport vessels were
commissioned in the course of the follow-
ing year to proceed to New South Wales
to establish a colony. Captain Phillip
having hoisted his flag as Commodore of
the Squadron, set sail from the Isle of
Wight, on the 13th May, 1787. The
‘ Supply ’ having on board Governor
Phillip and Lieut. Gidley King, R.N.,
sighted the coast of New South Wales on
the 3rd January 1788, and anchored in
Botany Bay on the 18th of the same
month. The ‘Scarborough,’ ‘Friend-
ship,’ and ‘Alexander’ transports arrived
on the 19th, and the frigate ‘ Sirius ’
and the remainder of the convoy on
the following day, the total number
of persons landed then being 1030.
Finding the place ineligible, Governor
Phillip, accompanied by Capt. Hunter,
and others embarked in boats for another
bay designated by Capt. Cook as Broken
Bay, and entered a place on the way
marked on the charts as ‘ Port Jackson,’
where they selected Sydney Cove (so
named after Lord Sydney) as the place
for the new settlement. The site of the
future ‘ Queen of the Pacific ’ was
selected on the 22nd January, and
Governor Phillip returned to Botany on
the 24th, quitting Botany in the ‘ Supply ’
with the whole of the fleet on the 25th,
HAND BOOK TO THE CITY OF SYDNEY.
and on the 26th the British ensign was
for the first time hoisted near the site of
the present Custom House on Circular
Quay. For seven months after the
establishment of the colony there was a
great want of food, and the return of the
‘ Sirius ’ from the Cape of Good Hope
with supplies in May, 1789, caused great
rejoicing in the colony. Shorty after-
wards the Governor, with Capt. Hunter
and party carried out their original inten-
tion of exploring Broken Bay, the
Hawkesbury was ascended, and the
Windsor and Richmond bottoms ex-
amined. In the month of July, 1790,
Governor Phillip laid down the lines of a
regular town, the principal street extend-
ing from the landing place for the length
of a mile. The first Governor however, who
divided the City of Sydney into districts
and named the streets was Major-General
Macquarie, the proclamation bearing date
the 6th October, 1810. It will be seen
from the appended itinerary that seven
of them are named after the children of
George 111, viz, George, York, Clarence,
Kent, Cumberland, Sussex, and Cam-
bridge ; five, viz, Macquarie, Hunter,
Phillip, Bligh, and King, after Governors
of the territory ; and several, as Pitt,
Gastlereagh, Liverpool, Goulburn, Argyle,
Harrington, and Bathurst Streets, have
been named after famous Imperial states-
men. Elizabeth-street was named after
Mrs. Macquarie, while Bland, Went-
worth, Nicholson, and other streets have
received their names from local notabili-
ties. It is worthy of passing note that
the first six streets in Woolloomooloo
were named by the late Sir James Dow-
ling, who opened them in 1834, because
they were on his own land. Victoria was
so named after the Princess (now Queen)
Victoria ; Brougham-street, after Lord
Chancellor Brougham ; Dowling-street,
after himself; and Forbes-street, after
Sir Francis Forbes, Union-street, so


common in the street nomenclature of
every town in England, does not seem to
find much favour in Sydney, there being
but one small street of that name in
Pyrmont, with a lane leading from the
top of Brickfield Hill to Pitt-street
which has the name of Union-lane ;
Union-street, off Erskine-street, has been
transformed into Day-street; and Union-
street, Sussex-street, has been changed to
Fowler-street. A recent revision in the
names of the streets has been made
under the authority of the City Council,
and the names of some of the ‘ highways
and byways ’ have been dignified by
the appellation of Oxford-street, Regent-
street, Bond-street, High Holborn, and
other more assumptious titles. Unlike
the City of London where the aristoc-
racy are located at the west, and the
commercial and industrial classes at the
east end, the case was altered at the
antipodes on the division of the city—the
Belgravians of the period affecting the
east, and the lower classes the west end,
or the ‘Rocks,’ where some of the
humbler tenements exist at the present
time.
The original intention of Governor
Phillip was frustrated by the action of
succeeding governments in encouraging
this concentration of population in Sydney
north. We learn from ‘ Stockdale’ that
the form of the streets was laid out by
Phillip in such a manner as to ensure the
‘ free circulation of air. ’ The principal
streets, according to Phillip’s design,
would have been two hundred feet wide.
The ground proposed for them to the
south was nearly level, and was altogether
an excellent situation for buildings. It
was proposed 4 that when houses are
built here, the grants of land shall be
made with such clauses as will prevent
the building of more than one house on
one allotment, which is to consist of
sixty feet in front, and one hundred and
fifty feet in depth,’ These regulations,
it was said, 4 will preserve a kind of
uniformity in the buildings, prevent
narrow streets, and exclude many incon-
veniences which a rapid increase of popu-
lation might occasion hereafter.’ It was
a great misfortune that other governors
did not maintain these regulations. The
first plan of the city and Sydney Cove
was published in 1789. The coast-line
was drawn by Lieutenant Dawes, who
was in charge of an observatory founded
by the Governor at Dawes’ Point, and
the soundings by Captain (afterwards
sleep ;
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
Governor) Hunter, R.N. At the time of
drawing (July, 1788) a small house was
building for the Governor somewhere
near the present junction of Pitt and
Hunter streets, Lieut.-Governor Hunter’s
house being situate to the westward.
The first huts that were erected for the
officers were composed of very perishable
materials, the soft wood of the cabbage
palm, being only designed to afford
immediate shelter ; the huts of the prison-
ers were merely composed of wattle and
dab. In building the Governor’s house,
lime was made from oyster shells found
in the neighbouring coves. The abund-
ance of freestone and clay for making
bricks was not for some time available in
consequence of the scarcity of the above
material, the bricks, &c, having to be
laid in clay, which rendered it necessary
to give great thickness to the walls with-
out imparting to them that firmness that
could be wished. A specimen of Sydney
clay, which proved to be of a fine
texture, and ‘ will be found very useful
for the manufactory of earthenware, ’ was
sent home, and was modelled into a
medallion by Mr. Wedgwood. A vignette
engraved from this medallion figures in
the title-page of the first narrative of the
voyage of Governor Phillip and history
of New South Wales. The design is
allegorical; it represents Hope encourag-
ing Art and Labour, under the influence
of Peace, to pursue the employments
necessary to give security and happiness
to an infant settlement. In allusion to
this medallion, Dr. Erasmus Darwin
wrote the following lines :
Where Sydney Cove her lucid bosom swells,
Courts her young navies, and the storm repels;
High on a rock amid the troubled air.
Hope stood sublime and waved her golden hair—
Calmed with her rosy smile the tossing deep,
And with sweet accents charmed the winds to
To each wild plain she stretched her snowy hand.
High-waving wood, and sea-encircled strand,
“Hear me,” she cried, “ ye rising realms ! record
Time’s opening scenes, and Truth’s unerring
There shall broad streets their stately walls extend.
The circus widen and the crescent bend ;
There, ray’d from cities o’er the cultur’d land.
Shall bright canals and solid roads expand ;
There the proud arch, colossus-like, bestride
Yon glittering streams, and bound the chafing
tide;
Embellished villas crown the landscape scene,
Farms wave with gold, and orchards blush
between.


There shall tall spires, and dome-capped towers
ascend,
And piers and quays their massive structures
blend;
While with each breeze approaching vessels glide.
And northern treasures dance on every tide !”
Then ceas’d the Nymph ; tumultuous echoes roar,
And Joy’s loud voice was heard from shore to
shore—
Her graceful steps, descending, pressed the plain,
And Peace, and Art, and Labour, joined her
These prophetic inspirations have been
wonderfully realised, but with one excep-
tion, viz, a bridge to the North Shore,
within the compass of a century. At the
first ‘ muster,’ or census, in June, 1788,
89 deaths were reported to have occurred
among the 1044 persons who originally
left England. On the 30th June last
the total population of the colony
was 711,719, viz, 396,325 males and
315,394 females. The first bank was
established in the colony in 1817 ; in
1879 there were eleven with a capital
of £8,423,428, the amount of deposits
reaching £16,722,452. The revenue
of the colony in 1878 was £4,983,864 and
the expenditure, £5,674,154. At the
muster of the Ist May, 1788, there were
in the colony 1 stallion, 3 mares, 3 colts,
2 bulls, 5 cows, 29 sheep, 19 goats, 74
pigs, 5 rabbits, 18 turkeys, 29 geese, 35
ducks, and 142 fowls. In 1792 the
number of horned cattle was 23, sheep
35, and pigs 43. In 1805 there were 203
horses, 3264 head of cattle, 16,501 sheep,
and 14,300 swine. The number of live
stock in the colony on the 31st March
last (1879) was as under; Sheep,
23,967,053; horned cattle, 2,771,583;
horses, 336,468.
The first shipment of wool to England
in 1807 weighed 524 lbs, and in 1820,
when it obtained its highest price,
namely, 10s 4d per lb, the quantity ex-
ported was 112,616 lbs. Last year the
quantity exported was 111,833,017 lbs, of
the value of £5,723,316. The first farm
at Farm Cove on the site of the present
Botanical Gardens contained about nine
acres, laid and sown in corn of different
kinds with the plants and fruit trees
brought out from Brazil and the Cape in
1788. Later accounts speak of six acres
of wheat, eight of barley, and six of
other grain, as raised on the public ac-
count, and in a very promising way; in
the Governor’s garden were ‘ excellent
cauliflowers and melons very fine of their
kinds. The orange trees flourish, and
49 Market Street Sydney.
the fig trees and vines are improving
more rapidly. ’ 'ln a climate so favour-
able’ adds the publisher, the cultivation
of the vine may doubtless be carried to
any degree of perfection ; and should not
other articles of commerce divert the at-
tention of the settlers from this point,
the wines of New South Wales may, per-
haps, hereafter be sought with avidity,
and become an indispensable part of the
luxury of European tables.’ Forty years
afterwards, in 1828, Mr. Gregory Blax-
land, while on a visit to England, was
presented with the * Gold Ceres Medal’
by the Society of Arts, London, for
wine, the produce of his colonial vine-
yard. The yield of our vineyards, com-
prising 4237 acres, was 684,733 gallons,
2540 gallons of brandy and 1102 tons of
fruit in 1878, and if the projected assimi-
lation of duties is carried out by the
Imperial Government a great impetus
will be given to this branch of colonial
industry. The land alienated on the
30th June, 1879, was 31,676,437 acres, of
which 613,642 were under cultivation,
yielding 3,439,326 bushels of wheat and
4,420,580 bushels of maize, 53,590 tons of
potatoes, 7,932 cwts. of tobacco, and
3,398,445 dozens of oranges. Indica-
tions of copper were found when sinking
a cellar for the public stock of spirituous
liquors in Sydney in 1788. In other
parts of the colony extensive deposits of
that metal and tin have been found,
and our export of last year (1878)
amounted in value to £338,250 for copper,
and £397,157 for tin. Governor Phillip
strongly discouraged any search for the
metals, “conceiving that the discovery
of a mine would be the greatest evil that
could befall the settlement !” In 1814
some convicts who were employed cutting
a road to Bathurst, were said to have
discovered gold in a considerable quantity,
and were only compelled to keep silence on
the point by menance and flogging ! Gold
was also discovered in Fish River in Febru-
ary, 1823, and two years afterwards a con-
vict was flogged in Sydney on suspicion,
of having stolen gold, which he stated
he had discovered in the bush ! ! At a
later period, (1839), Count Von Strzlecki
discovered gold bearing quartz, in the
district of Wellington. Having subse-
quently mentioned to Sir George Gipps
the existence of a gold field i» the dis-
trict of Bathurst, he was requested by
the Government to keep the matter
secret for fear of the consequences, which,
considering the condition apd population


of the colony, were to be apprehended
by the fact being likely to arouse the
cupidity of the prison population.
For the same reasons the late Rev. W.
B. Clarke was induced to keep two dis-
coveries of 1841 and 1844 from the public
knowledge, and it was only after the dis-
covery of gold at Summer Hill by Mr.
E. H. Hargraves, on the 12th of February,
1851, that the first proclamation notify-
ing the existence of gold in Australia,
was issued by Sir Charles Fitzroy. Two
years previously Mr. Smith, of the Fitz-
roy Iron Works, near Berrima, had
apprised the Colonial Secretary that gold
bearing quartz had been found by him
and offered on certain terms to reveal the
locality. In the month of January, 1852,
two tons of gold, the produce of the co-
lony of New South Wales, were exported
to England in one vessel. The total
amount of gold coined at the Mint and
bullion to 31st December, 1878, represent-
ed a money value of £44,490,307. The
export of our coal mines will come up to
about £900,000. The number of miles of
railways open, (exclusive of the recent
extension to Gunnedah) on the 30th
June 1878, was 748 J, with over 7000
miles of telegraph line. W~e should
not omit to state as an evidence of the
prosperity of the industrial classes that
on December 31st, 1878, the Savings
Bank of New South Wales had 32,644
depositors, nearly half of whom were
credited with £2O and under, and there
were 120 who represented £86,024. In
the Government Savings’ Banks there
were 69,932 depositors, having £480,024
to their credit. There are numerous
private colonial undertakings of a mone-
tary character that are working with ex-
traordinary, if not unparalleled, success,
viz, the Australian Mutual Provident
and other kindred societies, and the
Australasian Steam Navigation Company ;
the value of the fleet of the latter is
nearly £400,000; plant, patent slip,
machinery, and engineering works over
£50,000 ; freehold and leasehold property
near upon £215,000.
The completeness of Darwin’s fanciful
picture has, to a large extent, been
further realised by the erection of the
Garden Palace, whose * dome-capt towers
ascend’ in the Inner Domain, to which
each breeze
“ approaching vessels glide,
And northern treasures dance on every tide’’
to grace our International Exhibition,
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
The Palace (which before the Exhibition
closes will involve a cost nearly equal to
that of the Crystal Palace, Hyde Park,
London, the first International Exhibition,
of 1851 *) is of magnificent proportions.
The nave of the main building is 800 feet
long, crossed by a transept 500 feet long,
50 feet wide, and 60 feet high, surrounded
by a gallery 25 feet wide on either side.
The total area of floor space in the main
building is 383,750 superficial feet, and in
the two towers 10,000 feet in addition ;
and a total enclosed space of upwards of
11,104,000 cubic feet. A moiety of the
Outer Domain, comprising an area of about
35 acres, has been reserved for the Inter-
national Exhibition grounds.
A separate pavilion has been constructed
for the reception of the various pictures
and works of art, forwarded for exhibition
by Her Majesty the Queen, by the Society
of Arts at Kensington, various Foreign
galleries, and many of the leading artists
of Great Britain. The halls for the ex-
hibition of machinery, the display of live
stock, poultry, dogs, and floral, horticul-
tural, and agricultural products are spread
over the Outer Domain. The Inner
Domain in which the building is erected
covers a space of 56 acres, and except for
review purposes, in the earlier days of
the Volunteer movement, was strictly re-
served for vice-regal purposes. The
Exhibition was opened with considerable
eclat on the 17th of September by His
Excellency Lord Augustus Loftus, G.C.B,
and in the presence of their Excellencies
the Marquis of Nonnanby (Governor of
Victoria), Sir W. D. Jervois (Governor of
South Australia), and F. A. Weld, Esq,
C.M.G, (Governor of Tasmania). The
attendance of Sir Hercules Robinson,
C.M.G, (Governor of New Zealand) was
prevented by political circumstances, and
the indisposition of Sir A. M. Kennedy
(Governor of Queensland) caused his visit
to be deferred to a future period. The
history of this Exhibition, the arrange-
ments of which are not yet perfected, has
to be written at a future period. The
newspaper accounts up to the present,
from the state of chaos which prevailed
during the early days of the Show, are
discursory and fragmentary.
The Outer Domain comprises an area


measures three miles and three hundred
and seventy-three yards, and was finally
completed, according to an inscription cut
upon the rock overhanging a rude seat
known as ‘Lady Macquarie’s Chair,’from
the road having been planned by that
lady, on the 13th of June, 1816. There
are three principal entrances to the
Domain, one in Macquarie-street, opposite
the Free Library, inside of which is the
statue erected in memory of Sir Richard
Bourke, another between Hyde Park and
St. Mary’s Cathedral, and a third at the
foot of Palmer-street, Woolloomooloo.
Hyde Park, which has Park-street
running eastward right through it, is
tastefully laid out, and is encircled by a
dwarf stone wall and iron palisading.
At the end of the northern avenue stands
the statue of Albert the Good, late
Prince Consort, unveiled by Sir John
Young (afterwards Lord Lisgar) in 1866.
In the south-eastern division of this
Park, and directly opposite the Australian
Museum, stands the statue of Captain
Cook, executed by Woolner of Loudon,
the figure of the illustrious navigator
standing 13 feet 6 inches high. It
stands upon a massive pedestal of polished
Moruya granite, and was unveiled by Sir
Hercules Robinson, on the 25th February,
1879. In the early part of the agitation
which culminated in the erection of this
noble statue, Captain Watson, formerly
a chief pilot of this port erected a statue
to Captain Cook at his own cost at Rand-
wick. It was unveiled by Commodore
Goodenough in 1874, and presented by
the gallant ‘ Old Salt ’ to the Borough
Council. Cook and Phillip Parks, divided
by College-street, on the east of Hyde
Park, have recently been dedicated for the
use of the public. The remaining re-
serves for recreation are Belmore Gar-
dens, Prince Alfred Park, containing
about 18 acres, on which the old Exhibi-
tion Building is erected, the Flagstaff,
where the Observatory and Signal Station
are situated, Victoria Park, between the
Glebe and Newtown, (26, acres), and
Moore Park, the original proclamation of
the area, (500 acres) of which, as Sydney
Common, was unearthed by Mr. John
Sutherland, M. P. It is called after Mr.
Charles Moore, who occupied the position
of Mayor, when the contracts were taken
for re-forming it on a design submitted by
Mr. C. Bell, a late City Engineer. Here
the reviews of the Military and Naval
Forces are periodically held. The two
“barrow like” eminences at the South,
49 Makket Street, Sydney.
are respectfully named Mounts Renny
and Steel, after ex-Mayors, who took an
interest in the reclamation of the Com-
mon. The highway to Randwick, runs
through a noble avenue of trees, to the
suburb of that name, and Coogee Bay.
Wynyard Square is neatly laid out with
shrubs and flowers,' but inaccessible to
the public; Green Park, Darlinghurst,
and several smaller reserves have been
vested in the Municipal Council of the
city.
The Governorship of the colony is at
present confided to the Right Hon. Lord
Augustus Loftus, G.C.8., an experienced
diplomatist, who, on relinquishing the
distinguished position of H.M. Ambas-
sador to the Court at St. Petersburg, suc-
ceeded Sir Hercules Robinson, K.C.M.G.,
on his removal to New Zealand.
Sydney is divided into two electoral
divisions—East and West—each return-
ing four members to the Legislative As-
sembly. George-street is the dividing
line of the electorates. The present
members are—John Macintosh, John
Davies, James Greenwood, and Alexan-
der Stuart, for East Sydney ; James Mer-
riman, Angus Cameron, Daniel O’Connor,
and John Harris, for West Sydney.
There are two Police Courts—the Cen-
tral and Water Police Courts. The Cen-
tral Police authorities have jurisdiction
extending from King-street on the north,
to College-street on the east, and the
Water Police deal with offenders from
King-street northerly, including Woolloo-
mooloo, Darlinghurst, &c, the North
Shore, Balmain, and the waters of the
harbour. At the Central the presiding
magistrate is W. Crane, Esq., J.P., at
the Water Police Court Mr. J. M. Marsh.
The regulation and management of the
public vehicle traffic of the city and
suburbs is presently entrusted to a Board
of Commissioners, at present consisting
of the Mayor of Sydney, Mr. Fosberry
(Inspector-General of Police), and Aider-
man Chapman, the only elective member
thereof. The office is in Phillip-street.
The Marine Board of New South Wales,
Captain Hixson (President), Lieutenant
Lindemann, R.N, (Secretary), and six
Wardens, have the management and
regulation of the harbour traffic, and are
entrusted with all the powers necessary
to inquire into the causes of wrecks on
the coasts, and deal with other cases and
persona which come under their review.


General Directions for Strangers.
Nos. of Streets run from NORTH to SOUTH —or WEST to EAST.
In the book the even Nos. invariably occur in the first column of the page, as that
is the left-hand side of the Street from the commencement.
Pedestrians should keep the RIGHT-HAND side in passing anyone coming
in the opposite direction.
Vehicles and Horsemen keep the LEFT-HAND side.
Never block up the Pathway by standing talking to anyone —Keep moving.
Never throw Orange-Peel or shreds of Fruit on the Pathway.—Penalty Two Pounds.

The main mercantile artery of the city
was so named by Major-General Mac-
quarie, who held the reins of Government
from the Ist January, 1810, to the Ist
December, 1821, in honor of George,
Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV,
eldest son of His Majesty King George
the Third. It is one of the oldest, and is
the longest, of the streets of Sydney,
being 4362 yards, or about 2% miles in
length from Dawes’ Battery to Bay-street,
Glebe, the south-western boundary of the
city. The street is divided into George-
street north, that is from Dawes’ Battery
to King-street; George-street south from
King-street to Harris and Regent-streets ;
(George-street from Bathurst to Goul-
burn-street is commonly known as Brick-
field Hill); George-street west (late Parra-
matta-street) from Regent and Harris
Streets to the Newtown Road. Since our
reader is now in possession of the division
made in the name or portion of George-
street, we will commence at the Boats
Stairs, Dawes’ Point; Sydney Harbour,
with the battery named after Lieutenant
Dawes, who arrived with Governor Phillip,
and volunteered a second three years’
service in the colony. We have the
Mercantile Rowing Club Station on the
one side and the Corporation Baths with
the
Permanent Artillery Barracks
on the other. We then arrive at the
Bus-stand for the Glebe Point and Forest
Lodge, and pass Lower Fort-street, Cum-
berland-street, and Gloucester-street,
without observing anything of interest
until we reach the wharf of the A. S. N.
Co. (late Campbell’s), which runs along
the northern shore of Sydney Cove and
abuts into the harbour of Port Jackson,
and affords accommodation for a numerous
fleet of ocean-going steamers and sailing
vessels of the largest tonnage and capacity.
This was the first private wharf erected
in Sydney, and was built in 1824. The
property was recently disposed of to the
A. S. N. Company by the Campbell
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,


family for £lOO,OOO. Adjacent thereto
is the
Mariners’ Church
whose minister, the Rev. Thomas Gain-
ford, works with zeal and energy for
the spiritual welfare of the many sailors
visiting the port. A little further south
is the Sailors’ Home and Reading Room,
a neat and commodious building, with
spacious day-rooms and well-ventilated
dormitories, opened in 1865, and now
under the resident superintendentship
of Mr. Charles S. Ohatfield ; the build-
ings on the left being the Ordnance
and Imperial Pension Department and
the Naval Brigade Barracks, fronting
the Queen’s and Commissariat Stores,
which face the Circular Quay. On the
opposite side of the way and to the south
of the approach to the Queen’s Wharf
several extensive ship chandlers, such
as Mitchell & Co, and a number of
outfitters, shipping butchers, &c, are
located. From the many Chinese mer-
chants and artisans that are congregated
in this part of the street it is not inap-
propriately called the “Chinese Quarters,”
and some of the houses of the former do
a great deal of business with the Flowery
Land, They extend almost to Bridge-
street. On our way thither we pass
Essex-street with its old associations and
the famous region of * the Rocks,’ the
latter of which extended west of George-
street near to Church Hill, now Char-
lotte Place, and from thence along
Clarence-street, including Kent and
Sussex-streets, to Cockle Bay, for which
the name of Darling Harbour was sub-
stituted in 1826. The Barracks were
situated on ground bounded northward
by a line from Clarence-street on the east
side to the west side of George-street,
the line running immediately along the
southern boundary of ‘ Petty’s hotel’ and
Dr, Lang’s Church and College buildings.
The old Treasury stood where Margaret-
street now runs through, and the boun-
dary extended to what is known as Bar-
rack-street on the south side. Before,
however, reaching Essex-street on the
west side of George-street, you pass the
site of the old Gaol, where scores of
bushrangers, highwaymen, and other
criminals were executed in the early
days,—Essex-street then being known as
Gallows Hill. Crossing to the south side
of this street we come upon the spot on
which stood a house from whence, after
three weeks’ hard labour by excavating
49 Market
across the street at night, a man named
Tom Blackstone and his confederates
effected an entrance into the Bank of
Australasia on the eastern side, and stole
£750 in British silver, 2030 dollars, a
large number of notes (£14,500) and bills.
The robbery was committed in September,
1828, and Blackstone and his comrades
were convicted and sentenced to trans-
portation for the offence. We next pass
Lyons’ Buildings where the Agricultural
Society of New South Wales and several
branch Insurance agents have quarters,
the stores of Messrs. R. Towns and Co,
and the French Consulate intervene.
The ‘ Metropolitan hotel’ on the opposite
comer is kept by W. Camb, of Fire
Brigade celebrity. From this point the
buildings begin to assume a more opulent
character. The
Bank op Australasia,
comes first, then crossing Jamieson-street
we come to the
London Chartered Bank
and the new premises of the
Mercantile Bank op Sydney
which show very imposing fronts, while
opposite, at the corner of old Robinhood-
lane, corresponding piles have lately been
erected by Mr. A. W. Sutton, the to-
bacconist, and Mr. W. Foy, galvanized
ware manufacturer. New features of
architectural improvements break the
vista from the Squatters’ Exchange,
at the corner of Margaret-street, and
the various places of business on both
sides are lavish in the display of articles
of luxury and wealth. On the one side
we have a host of merchant clothiers and
musical instrument depots, where all the
latest improvements in imported goods
are available ; on the other, jewellers’
shops, resplendent with gold and gems of
the most brilliant character and artistic
setting, manufacture, and display. We
have, in this locality, several large
warehouses —amongst which may be
noticed those of Messrs. W. and S.
Gardiner, Prince Ogg and Co, next to
which comes Denison House. Turning
our gaze to the westward the two great
monetary institutions of the colony are
before us, the
Bank op New South Wales,
with its sharp angular features, and the
Commercial Bank
with its fluted columns and classical
frieze. The former has branches in four
Street,
Sydney.


of the Australian colonies and New Zea-
land, and transacts the business of the
Government in London. The latter,
which was started in 1834, has been pay-
ing dividends at the rate of 25 per cent,
per annum; the profits realised by the
Bank of New South Wales, which was
established in 1817, have been propor-
tionately great. At the corner of Wyn-
yard-street the
Mutual Life Association of Aus-
tralasia
has reared its characteristic banner. Nearly
opposite is the Temporary Railway Parcels
and Ticket Office in St. Martin’s Lane,
which must piove a great convenience to
business folk, saving them the unnecessary
trouble and delay of sending small par-
cels to the Redfern Terminus as hereto-
fore. We now arrive at the principal
public building in this portion of the
city, the
General Post Office,
a portion of which only has yet been car-
ried out, but Parliament has voted a sum
towards its completion, when it will ex-
tend from George-street to Pitt-street.
It is built of Pyrmont stone in the Italian
Renaissance siyle with an open arcade,
the groined roof of which is supported by
polished Moruya granite columns running
on both frontages. The key-stone of the
central arch in George-street was set by
H. R. H. the Duke of Edinburgh in 1869,
The whole of the front is elaborately en-
riched, and when finished will have a
length of 353 feet by a width of 78 feet.
At present the accommodation is too
limited to supply full conveniences for
the bureaux at present located within the
building—namely, the whole of the
Postal, Telegraph, Money Order, and
Government Savings’ Bank Departments.
The building, which is universally ad-
mired, is one of the many designed for
the Government by our talented colonial
architect, Mr. James Barnet. The un-
pretentious building opposite is occupied
by a well-known firm, Messrs. David
Jones and Co. A few doors further on
we find Messrs. Gordon and Gotch’s news-
paper and advertising agency, where files
of European and Intercolonial journals
may be consulted. The elegant building on
the west, previously occupied by Messrs.
Isaacs and Co, is that of Mr. George
Robertson, the enterprising publisher of
Victoria, South Australia, and New
South Wales, and is admirably adapted
Excelsior Steam' Printing Works,
for the purposes of his extensive trade.
The next building less massive, but in no
wise less distinguished by correctness
and elegance of architectural detail is that
of the
English, Scottish, and Australian
Chartered Bank,
established in 1852. The ‘ Exchange
hotel’ occupies the south-eastern corner
of George and King-streets; directly
opposite is Tidswell’s ‘ Great Britain’
hotel, and which is almost contiguous to
the
Australian Joint Stock Bank,
established under another colonial pro-
prietary in 1853. This bank was vic-
timised to a large amount in 1857 by the
notorious swindler Francisco, or the
Count Miranda, who on false representa-
tions obtained a letter of credit from the
Bank, on the Bank of Australia, Mel-
bourne, for upwards of £19,000, which he
drew out in gold, and was never heard
of afterwards, though a rumour once
found breath that he had taken up a
domicile at Callao, and had been killed
in a drunken brawl In the neighbour-
hood are Maddock’s circulating library,
also the Depository of the Religious
Tract Society. Anew ‘Coffee Palace’has
recently been fitted up under the auspices
of a public company, under the secretary-
ship of Mr. S. E. Lees, next to which is the
Wesleyan Book Depot. Nearly opposite
is the ‘ Royal ’ Hotel, the head quarters of
Australian magnates ; adjoining we have
the George-street entrance to Farmer
and Company’s establishment, as also
Campbell’s Royal Furnishing Arcade.
At the corner of Market-street is the
famed ‘Crown and Anchor Tavern,’ kept
by Mr. C. W. Roberts, who carries on the
business so successfully established by
C. J. Roberts, Esq, our popular Mayor.
Ere we reach Market-street we have the
enterprising firms of Messrs. Holdsworth,
Gardyne, and Co, directly opposite being
F. Lassetter’s splendid edifice. A visit to
either of these establishments will fully
repay the reader for his time and trouble
—these being among the largest iron-
mongery establishments in New South
Wales. Crossing Market-street on the left
we have the
Waterloo Stores,
the head of which is Sir Daniel Cooper,
Bart, who has been for many years an
absentee, and who has on many occasions


rendered good serviee to our colony. In
the same building is the firm of
Messrs. Holdsworth & Macpherson
(entrance in Market-street) who are also
among our large wholesale ironmongers,
&c. Next to these stores we have a fine
range of shops, erected by enterprising
men, in which are the offices of the City
Mutual Fire Insurance Company. Op-
posite are the
City Fruit Markets,
the street fronts of which are occupied by
a number of business men. The space
between the Markets and Druitt-street
is occupied as the
Central Police Office
and watchhouse, erections which are
simply a disgrace to the metropolis. A
range of very fine buildings runs along
the opposite side of George-street to
Park-street. The ‘Swan with Two
Necks,’ at the southern corner of the
street above-named, is the rendezvous of
the Associated Trades Unions, and has
been noted as the nucleus where many
important changes in the social history of
trade have been matured. The large and
elegant stone building opposite is the
Town Hall,
the foundation stone of which was
laid by his Royal Highness the
Duke of Edinburgh in 1868. The style is
Italian, and entrance is obtained under a
handsome portico with highly orna-
mented entablature and pediment, from
its own grounds, formerly the old Ceme-
tery. Crossing the front corridor, access
is obtained to the vestibule or ante-
chamber, one of the largest and most
elaborately finished rooms in the city.
The great hall, magnificent in design has
not yet been commenced, though the
basement has for some time been com-
pleted. The clock tower is 189 feet high,
and the panoramic view from the campa-
nile is remarkably striking. In the next
enclosure and filling up all the space
thence to Bathurst-street is
St. Andrew’s Cathedral,
The style of this building is the perpen-
dicular Gothic. It is about 160 feet long
and 62 feet broad, the dimensions of the
transept being 110 feet in length by a
width of 14 feet. The grand stained
glass windows are mostly the gifts of
private individuals, the organ cost £2OOO,
Christ Church,
Police Station
49 Market Street, Sydney.
and was purchased by subscription, and
Bishop Barker gave £lOOO towards the
encaustic pavement. The Deanery, a
plain Gothic building, with its well-kept
lawn, stands in the Cathedral close. There
are cab stands north and south of the
Town Hall and Cathedral enclosures. On
the opposite side of the street which is
here at its widest proportions, though
not nearly so wide as contemplated in the
first instance by Governor Phillip. At
one corner of Bathurst-street, is the
‘Emu Inn,’ a great house for politics,
and the Bank of New South Wales has
a branch at the opposite corner. At this
point Brickfield Hill, as it used to be
called, and is now commonly known,
commences. This part of the city has been
very much improved, and a large amount
of trade is being done. Crossing Liverpool
and Goulburn Streets we arrive at the
Haymarket Square,
the property of the Corporation of Sydney.
The hideous structure which formerly oc-
cupied this valuable frontage has been
superseded by an elegant block of build-
ings, on a plot of land leased from the
Council by the late Mr. Watkins, for a
term of twenty years, at a gross rental
of £30,000. At the corner of Campbell-
street is a branch of the Australian
Joint Stock Bank, adjoining which is a
branch Post, Telegraph, and Money Order
Office, and at the corresponding corner
of Hay-street the ‘ Palace ’ hotel, with
several commodious business places inter-
vening. At the next corner is the
southern branch of the Commercial Bank,
also built on leased Corporation ground.
From thence to Christchurch are a
number of elegant shops including the
premises of Messrs. Hordern and Sons,
with their palace show rooms, and the
branch Savings’ Bank, and the ever-
memorable
which has long held the name of the
aristocratic Anglican place of worship,
and is amongst the oldest display of
architecture we have, immediately ad-
joining which is the
at the conjunction of the street with
Pitt-street. Crossing the Railway
Bridge we have the branch Bank of New
South Wales. Here commences George-
street West. From thence to the
boundary of the city several great im-
provements have been carried out.

PITT STREET.
Omnibuses plying through Pitt-street have the following coloured lamps, and thus
enter the street
From the Circular Quay— Darlinghurst (green) ; Darling Point and Double
Bay (red) ; Railway (use a whistle) ; Strawberry Hills (green and black).
From Bridge-street (Macquarie-place and Exchange Corner)—Bondi (white) ;
Coogee Bay (brown); Edgecliffe Road ; Glenmore Road (red); Moore Park
(blue); Paddington (red) ; Randwick (brown and white) ; Rifle Butts (blue);
Surry Hills —Crown and Bourke Streets (blue) ; Waverlev (red and white) ;
Woollahra (red).
Named after William Pitt, son of the
Earl of Chatham, is 2836 yards—upwards
of If miles—in length. The street is dis-
tinguished as
Pitt-street North and Pitt-street
South.
Pitt-street North from the Circular Quay
to King-street, and Pitt-street South from
King-street to the junction of George and
Devonshire Streets—the entrance to the
Railway Terminus. It was near the north-
ern end of this street that Governor
Phillip landed, January 26, 1788, and set
up his camp on the banks of a creek, after-
wards called the
Tank Stream
from the tanks formed on its banks to
conserve the water. Over this creek or
stream a bridge was constructed, from
which Bridge-street derives its name, near
the site of the present Exchange. The
Tank Stream has long since disappeared,
and its bed been converted into one of the
main sewers of the City, emptying itself
into the Harbour.
Pitt-street, although of less business
importance than George-street, certainly
carries the palm for wholesale establish-
ments and splendid edifices—indeed from
Bridge street to King-street is an almost
continuous line, on both sides, of magnifi-
cent structures. To particularize might
be considered invidious, and to do justice
space will not admit. Commencing at the
Circular Quay there are several fine build-
ings, both right and left of the street, to
Bridge-street, of an important business
character. Several Insurance and Assur-
ance Offices, and a few of the most pro-
minent may be mentioned. First, the
Exchange and Chamber of Commerce
facing Bridge-street, is a noble structure,
in a fine position for its purpose, and
well deserving a visit; among its offices,
on the Pitt-street side, are the Royal Fire
and Life Insurance Company, and others
of a similar character. The Australian
Mutual Provident Society’s Offices come
next, with their new offices opposite in
course of erection. These give the street
a splendid appearance. The Victoria Fire,
and General Insurance Company’s Offices,
the Pacific, and the Imperial, a few doors
from it, with the Liverpool, and London,
and Globe Insurance, next claim attention.
Crossing Spring-street, with fine build'
ings on each side of it, the
OrientiL Bank
comes next. Not only is it a fine building,
but it is fitted up in the most costly
manner in the interior. On the right-hand
side stands the
Bank of New Zealand.
The next in order is the Sydney Fire Insur-
ance Company’s Offices, facing Hunter-
street; and on the opposite side of Pitt-
street are the
Sydney Morning Herald, Echo, and
Sydney Mail Office
replete with machinery of modern and
the most extensive character. The Herald
is the oldest and largest of our daily
newspapers.
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,


Crossing Hunter-street the
Union Bank oe Australia
is reached, next door to which is the
Illustrated Sydney News Office, and from
this onward the splendid buildings of
Vickery and Co., Dalton Br< 'thers, Hoff-
nung and Co., and Newton Brothers are
passed till we reach
The City Bank
which forms part of a fine block of build-
ings. Opposite is an open space, the rear
of the General Post Office, intended for
the formation of St. Martin’s-lane, leading
to George-street, and the continuation of
the General Post Office to Pitt-street;
the great difficulty in completing the
scheme has been in obtaining the block
of houses adjoining, for the purpose of
making the thoroughfare of sufficient
width. A portion of the ground already
cleared was valued at £6OO per foot.
Passing another fine block of buildings on
the left, we reach Trickett’s ‘lnternational’
hotel with its comical-looking tower,
reminding one of the ancient legend of
Bluebeard. This fine Hotel is kept by Mr.
Edward Trickett, who ; it will be re-
membered, became champion sculler of the
world by defeating Sadler on the Thames
June 27, 1876. Since then he has beaten
Michael Rush, who tried to wrest the
honor from him on the Parramatta River.
He was next matched to row Lay cock,
another native, for the championship and
£2OO a-side and won. Opposite Trickett’s
is the well-known Hostelry of ‘Jim
Punch,’ as he is termed by the ‘ Corn-
stalks,’ in that familiar style with which
they refer to public men whom they de-
light to honour. It is in a great measure
due to the enterprise of Mr. Punch that
the Champion Sculler’s laurels now rest
on the brow of an Australian. Nearly
all aquatic contests, of any importance,
are arranged under the roof of ‘ Genial
Jim.’
Crossing King-street, we come to the
Office of the
Evening News and Town and Country
Journal Office
the Proprietors of which lay claim to the
largest circulation in the Colony for both
papers. On the opposite side of the street
stands the
Victoria Theatre
an unpretentious looking building with
iron gates, and so mixed up with the ad-
joining places of business as to be easily
49 Market Street, Sydney.
passed during the day without being ob-
served, but not so at night. Across the
street
Thiodon’s Royal Polytechnic
and Mechanical Exhibition holds its own
against all competitors, and well deserves
a visit. Again crossing the street a
massive building, supported by Moruya
marble pillars, attracts attention. The
building is of singular construction, and
certainly original in design, of immense
magnitude, and extending to George-
street. It is known as Messrs. Farmer
and Co.’s Victoria House, and gives em-
ployment to a small army of assistants
and work-people.
Crossing Market-street, on the left-hand
side, we arrive at
Cobb and Co.’s Booking Offices
where travellers can be booked, by rail
and Telegraph Line of Coaches to almost
any part of the Colony. Auction-yards
for the sale of horses, &c, as well as for
the sale of new and second-hand furniture
abound in this part of the City. A short
distance farther on ‘ Tattersall’s ’ hotel is
situated, the celebrated rendezvous of the
‘Australian Jockey Club,’ and is generally
well patronized during the racing season,
A few doors brings us to the
Mechanics’ School of Arts
which has lately undergone considerable
alterations, to its great improvement.
With its noble reading-rooms, library,
concert-hall, and class-rooms it is indeed
a splendid institution, and must be visited
to be thoroughly appreciated. Kearey’s
coach factory now appears on the left-
hand side, and at the corner of Park-street
the ‘ Young Men’s Christian Association’
have their Rooms and Offices. In the
same building the Australian Accident
Assurance Association’s Offices are found;
at the opposite corner is a branch of the
English, Scottish, and Australian Char-
tered Bank.
Crossing Park-street the next building
is the
Pitt Street Congregational Church
the largest Nonconformist place of worship
in New South Wales, a beautiful struc-
ture, well designed and fitted up, with
large school-rooms adjoining. Opposite
this Church is the
New Temperance Hall
possessing ample accommodation for public
meetings (besides large rooms for meet-


mgs of a semi-public character) and a well-
supplied restaurant. In the same build-
ing the Sydney Freehold Land and Build-
ing Society is found. Next door are the
fine stores of Messrs. Macintosh and Sons.
Crossing Bathurst-street, (the Office of
the Balmain Cemetery being at No. 344,)
no building of any consequence is passed
except St. Andrew’s Church of England
Denominational School, until Liverpool-
street is reached, where Dunn and Came-
ron’s Tobacco and Cigar Manufactory
(previously known as the Old Sugar
Works) at the corner, claims attention,
not only from the magnitude of the works,
but the number of the hands employed.
From Liverpool-street to Campbell-
street there is only one place worthy of
mention, and that is Mr. J. Robertson’s
coach manufactory, where vehicles of very
superior workmanship are constructed.
Between Campbell and Hay Streets are
the
Belmore Markets
where the vegetables for Sydney are sold
by the Market Gardeners three times a
week—Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
This place is seen in its most lively state
from about two o’clock until eight o’clock
on the morning of these days, and on
Saturday night, from about six o’clock
to twelve o’clock, when it assumes the
name of
‘Paddy’s Market,’
and during that time resounds with one
incessant din of sales-people—male and
female, varied ever and anon by the
vociferous shouts of sundry stump-orators,
&c, in the vicinity.
Leaving the Markets, at the corner of
Hay and Pitt Streets, is the
Presbyterian Church
a plain building, with low archway en-
trance, of small dimensions in the interior,
and utterly destitute of any exterior orna-
mentation. The school-room adjoins the
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
church and has Belmore Cardens at the
rear. Opposite the Church the Royal
Alfred Australian Volunteer Fire Com-
pany, No. 1, is situated. Adjoining are
several Gasometers, belonging to the
Sydney Gas Works, which are filled
through the day from their works, near
Kent-street, for night consumption at the
south-end of the City. A little farther
on are the Christ Church Church of Eng-
land Schools. It is at this point the
Tramway crosses Belmore Gardens, which
joins Pitt-street at the same place. On the
left-hand stands the House of the Good
Shepherd, with the convent and chapel
attached. The next building, the Female
Refuge, is under Protestant control. Both
institutions are nearly self-supported by
the work of the inmates. Opposite is the
rear of Christ Church, the main entrance
to which is in George-street. Then comes
No. 2 Police Station, while opposite is
the Morgue, which adjoins the
Benevolent Asylum
one of the oldest of our charitable institu-
tions, and built, in what like others of
that period (1810—21), may be character-
ized as the * Macquarie style of architec-
ture.’ This building is doomed to early
destruction, the site being required for
railway purposes. When founded it was
considered the outskirts of Sydney, but
it is now the extreme end of Pitt-street.
The Tramway will convey the stranger
back to the Terminus, Hunter-street, and
he may there take our ‘ Hand Book’ and
travel along some other street, noting its
many features of interest; or he may
take the train to Parramatta, and saunter
among the streets, and through the Do-
main, of what was in former days, a very
important town of the Colony, and known
then as Rosehill. Returning by steamer
to Sydney, and noting the lovely scenery
on the Parramatta River, he will have
spent a very pleasant day.

This street was named after Lord Castle-
reagh. It has not much traffic and is
consequently one of the cleanest streets
in the city. It was well laid out in the
first instance, but the intentions of the
Surveyor has been considerably marred
in carrying out the project, its continuity
being interrupted at several points. The
street commences at the Circular Quay,
directly opposite
The Prince Alfred Stairs,
the ‘Paragon’ hotel being No. 1. On the
opposite corner facing the Quay is the
Custom House,
rather antiquated in appearance, being
built in the year 1844, since which time
no outward demonstration in regard to
ornamentation has been attempted. The
succeeding houses on the right hand side
are mostly occupied by Custom House
agents, the left-hand side being large
bonded stores ; opposite are the new and
capacious wool stores of Messrs. Har-
rison, Jones and Devlin, and from this
point to Bridge-street the street is best
known as Macquarie Place. It passes
between the
New Lands’ Office
and the Colonial Secretary’s Office, the
* The public of Sydney have a plethora of pub-
lic amusements of a theatrical character. The
Royal, the Victoria, and the Queen’s Theatre
are now open, the Hall of the School of Arts, the
Guild Hall, are regularly open, and the Masonic,
and Protestant, and two Temperance Halls are
available for concerts and other performances.
The introduction of the drama in New South
Wales was almost coeval with the foundation of
the colony, the first play (Farquahar’s comedy,
“ The Recruiting Sergeant”) in Australia being
performed by some prisoners at the temporary
Barracks on the King’s Birthday at Sydney on
the 4th June, 1789. It was during Governor
Hunter’s Administration, namely 16th January,
1798, that the first theatre, erected at a cost of
£lOO, was opened in Sydney. According to
David Collins’ account of the History of New
South Wales, compiled from the manuscript of
Lieut. Governor King, R.N., London, 1798-1802.
George Barrington, the celebrated pick-pocket,
wrote the following prologue that was delivered
on the occasion ;
From distant climes, o’er wide-spread seas we
come,
Though not with much iclat, or beat of drum;
True patriots, all, for be it understood,
CASTLEREAGH STREET.
Audit Office
Theatre Royal,
49 Market Street, Sydney,
first is one of the most magnificent pieces
of architectural displays of which Sydney,
with her abundance of freestone, may
well be proud, and is then met by Bent-
street where the
Australian Club
is situated. Directly opposite Castle-
reagh-street North, passing up Bent-
street, we arrive at Bligh-street, which
leads ns to Castlereagh-street proper,
commencing at Hunter-street, at the
comer of which is situated ‘ Bowden’s
Club House’ hotel, next is the
and late the head quarters of the
Victorian Club. The extensive sites on
the left-hand side from this point to
King-street are expected to be occupied
by a new Railway Terminus whenever
the Suburban Railways are extended to
the city. The
erected on the site of the remains of the
old Prince of Wales Theatre, which was
twice destroyed by fire and inflicted irre-
mediable ruin on Mr. Laycock, father of
the now famous sculler, who lost over
£40,000 by the calamity, is on the oppo-
site side.* Adjoining are several Caf6s,
We left our country for our country’s good:
No private views disgrac’d our generous zeal,
What urg’d our travels, was our country’s weal;
And none will doubt, but that our emigration,
Has proved most useful to the British nation.
But you inquire, what could our breasts inflame
With this new passion for theatric fame ;
What, in the practice of our former days,
Could shape our talents to exhibit plays ?
Your patience, sirs, some observations made,
You’ll grant us equal to the scenic trade.
He who to midnight ladders is no stranger,
You’ll own will make an admirable Ranger.
To seek Macheath we have not far to roam,
And sure in Filch I shall be quite at home.
Unrivalled there, none will dispute my claim.
To hitrh pre-eminence and exalted fame.
As ©ft on Gadshill we have ta’en our stand,
When ’twas so dark you could not see your hand,
Some true-bred Falstaff, we may hope to start,
Who, when well-bolstered, well will play his part.
The scene to vary, we shall try in time
To treat you with a little Pantomime.
Here light and easy Columbines are found,
And well-tried Harlequins with us abound—
From durance vile our precious selves to keep,
We often had recourse to th’ flying leap;
To a black face have sometimes ow’d escape,


some of them of very pretentious appear-
ance. During the performances this
portion of Castlereagh-street has a very
lively appearance. There are some fine
buildings at the corners, near which is
the publishing office of the genial
Sydney Punch.
Passing from King-street to Market-
street we next notice St. James’ Church
of England Schools. Beyond this point
there are no buildings of consequence
until we reach Kiss’s and Cosgrove’s
horse bazaars, in the vicinity of which
the veterinary surgeons mostly congre-
gate. The Day and Sabbath Schools of
the Jewish persuasion, forming the
western division of the Great Synagogue
Buildings, have a commanding appear-
ance, and Park-street is next reached.
Hence to Bathurst-street the principal
buildings are the
Guild Hall,
a few doors from which is the
St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church
(being considered one of the most perfect
specimens of architecture in the city),
and Messrs. Dixson and Son’s tobacco
factory. On the eastern corner of Bathurst-
street is the ‘Hyde Park’ Hotel, kept by
James MTnerney, where the Trades and
Labour Council meets. Hunter’s Boot
Manufactory, which is a very fine and
roomy building, comes next, adjoining
which is an extensive building of brick
and stone known as the
Protestant Hall,
erected by a public company at consider-
able expense, and proving, it is believed,
a remunerative speculation. This is the
head quarters of the Loyal Orange Institu-
And Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of
crape.
But how, you ask, can we e’er hope to soar
Above these scenes, and rise to tragic lore ?
Too oft, alas 1 we’ve forced th’ unwilling tear,
And petrified the heart with real fear.
Macbeth a harvest of applause will reap,
For some of us, I fear, have murdered sleep ;
His lady too, with grace will sleep and talk,
Our females have been used at night to walk.
Sometimes, indeed, so various is our art,
An actor may improve and mend his part;
“ Give me a horse,” bawls Richard, like a drone,
We’ll find a man would help himself to one.
Grant us your favor, put us to the test,
To gain your smiles we’ll do our very best;
And without dread of future Turnkey Lockits,
Thus, in an honest way, still pick your pockets.
[The price of a seat in the gallery—the most
commodious and fashionable part of the house—
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
tion, and its rooms are also available for
the meetings of Templars and other
kindred societies. From the Protestant
Hall to Liverpool-street there are no
buildings worthy of note. Crossing
Liverpool-street on the right-hand side
we have the
Particular Baptist Church,
neat but not ornamental; thence we
cross Goulburn-street, and on the right
we pass the Eoman Catholic Vicar
General’s Office, opposite which is the
Foresters’ Hall. A little further on and
we arrive at Campbell-street; on the
left is
St. Francis’ Church and Schools.
and opposite this is the Belmore (Paddy’s)
Market.
Castlereagh-street is again interrupted
by the Becreation Reserve known as Bel-
more Gardens, and the old Cemetery,
which has been closed to the public for
many years past, on the other side of which
Castlereagh-street again commences, and
crossing Devonshire-street on the right is
Prince Alfred Park,
in which is the Exhibition Building,
used more especially by the Agricultural
Society for their annual show, and fre-
quently rented to hold concerts, balls,
&c.
Chalmer’s Church
being directly opposite ; a little further
on on the right the Cleveland-street Pub-
lic School is reached ; Castlereagh-street

factory.
was fixed at a shilling’s worth of spirits, flour,
meat, or other articles of general use. After the
theatre had been opened a short time it became
very popular, and every device was practised by
the worst class of convicts to obtain the means
of admission. One fellow killed a flne_ grey-
hound belonging to an officer, and aiter skinning
it succeeded in palming its joints off for kan-
garoo flesh, at the rate of 9d. per pound. Crime
increased to such a marked extent that the
Governor issued an order for levelling the place
with the ground.—l79B.]
The performance consisted of the tragedy of
“ Revenge,” “ The Hotel” as an afterpiece. In
1833 Mr. Barnet Levy, owner of the Royal Hotel,
fltted'up the saloon of that establishment as a
theatre, and it was licensed by Major General
Sir Richard Bourke, under the name of “ The
Royal.” Five years afterwards the Victoria
Theatre was built; it was opened on the 17th
March (St. Patrick’s Day) 1838.

This street was named after Mrs. (lady
of Governor) Macquarie, and embraces a
length of 3436 yards to Cleveland-street.
It commences at the Circular Quay, at
the wool warehouse of Messrs. Maiden,
Hill, and Clarke, and continues, passing
the wool stores of Messrs, A. Hinchclifi'e
and Co, to Bridge-street, the buildings
along its course being used as bonded
warehouses.
Crossing Bridge-street, on the eastern
boundary of the
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
we find the ‘ Civil Service’ hotel, erected
for the convenience of the army of
officials who pursue their daily avoca-
tions in the neighbourhood, and passing
through Raphael-street, so-called from
the property of a charitable member of
the Jewish fraternity recently deceased,
we reach an enclosed drinking fountain
and a cab stand, opposite to which are
the buildings occupied by the Registrar
of Brands, the Inspector of Stock, and the
Department of Mines.
From this point we pass either along
Phillip or Bligh-street to Hunter-street,
where Elizabeth-street proper commences,
the terminus of the
Government Tramway
commences near one of the oldest hostel-
ries in the colony, the ‘Sir Maurice
O’Connell’ hotel, of which the genial J. T.
Solomon is the proprietor. On the other
side is the building known as the
Academy of Art, where the nucleus of a
National Gallery is being formed under
the auspices of an association of private
gentlemen, aided under certain conditions
by a Government subsidy. The members
of the Royal Society also hold their meet-
ings and converzationes in this building.
From this point the character of the street
becomes entirely changed. With the
exception of a few respectable boarding
houses and educational establishments,
and the extensive workshops and timber
yard of Mr. Alexander Dean, builder,
ELIZABETH STREET.
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
the houses are divided into nests of
chambers occupied by members of the
legal profession ; indeed, the street up
to St. James’s schools may be designated
the Chancery-lane of the metropolis.
Many of our most distinguished legal
luminaries, on and off the Bench, have
occupied dingy rooms in the locality.
On the western corner, near the junction
with King-street, is Stephen Court and
Temple Court, the ground floor of the
former being leased by the Government
as a waiting room and ticket depot for
the tramway, passengers being here set
down and picked up by the cars.
On the roadway on the other side of
King-street is another cab stand extend-
ing along the blank and dreary walls of
the
Supreme Court.
Adjoining, and before we reach the inter-
section of St. James’s-road is a very
handsome building of the Tudor style,
the Registrar-General’s office. The road
just mentioned separates a unique con-
glomeration of buildings from Hyde Park.
The houses on the opposite side are also
occupied by members of the learned pro-
fession, the London Loan and Mortgage
Company, the first established in the
colony, occupying the premises adjoining
the St. James’s Church schools. These
buildings are of the old colonial style,
and, in our opinion, form the most
eligible site for the erection of our future
central railway terminus. The property
could be easy of acquirement by the
Government. Upon the erection of the
proposed new Law Courts near the St.
Mary’s gate, the site of the present
Supreme Court buildings might very
properly be given in exchange for the
schools, and a central station worthy of
the city might be erected without en-
croaching, as the Engineer-in-chief for
Railways once proposed to do, upon the
people’s domain —Hyde Park. From the
schools to Market-street, where Mr. T.
Punch keeps the ‘ Albion ’ hotel, there is
a continuation of the carriage, cab, and
van stand. The eastern side, from St.


James’s-road to Liverpool-street, is occvr
pied by Hyde Park, which has a dwarf
wall and iron railing enclosing it. From
Market-street to Liverpool-street, both of
them tramway stations, several imposing
terraces of houses have been erected,
upon the destruction of a number of
tumbledown shanties that formerly dis-
figured the street, and just before reach-
ing the intersection of Park-street we
have the
Oddfellows’ Hall,
a magnificent structure erected by the
Independent Order of Oddfellows work-
ing under dispensation from the Man-
chester Unity, and then the
Great Synagogue,
erected in the Saracenic order of architec-
ture by the Jews. The building is
enriched by two highly decorated towers,
the eastern oriel being remarkable for
its delicate tracery and richness of detail.
Crossing Park-street, which is the
principal thoroughfare leading to the
populous suburb of Woolloomooloo, we
pass the old factory of Messrs. W. M.
Alderson and Sons, whose freehold rights
have for many years obstructed the foot-
path to a considerable extent; but the
property has at length been brought to
the hammer, and will no doubt be occu-
pied by buildings of a more imposing
character. The next building of import-
ance, near another tramway station, is
the ‘ Royal Hyde Park ’ hotel, erected
some years ago by Mr. Shalvey, and now
conducted by Mr. J. B. Olliffe, President
of the Licensed Victuallers’ Association.
From its commanding and healthy posi-
tion, and the enchanting views to be
obtained from its fiats, this hotel, since
its erection, has been a favourite resort
for visitors from the country. On the
other side of the road (which, throughout
49 Market Street, Sydney.
its length to Liverpool-street west, forms
the unbroken side line of Hyde Park) is
the Thornton obelisk, erected during the
mayoralty of that gentleman. Passing
along by Clarendon-terrace, &c, a num-
ber of palatial residences chiefly occu-
pied by members of the medical faculty,
the Liverpool-street siding is reached,
and the eye will be caught by the new
Unitarian Church and Lyon’s-terrace in
the eastern distance.
Pursuing a southerly course we pass
Goulburn-street and the New or Evan-
gelical Church, and on arriving at Camp-
bell-street pass the Church and schools
of St. Francis, which owe their erection
to the painstaking efforts of the Very
Rev. Dean Sheridan, now Vicar-General
of the Catholic Church. Belmore Gardens
commence at Hay-street, and are faced
on the east by the Albion Estate, formerly
known as Terry’s Gardens, where several
local manufacturers have taken up their
positions, and Messrs. Toohey and Co.
have erected the Standard Brewery.
Gipps-street West, running from Pitt-
street, by the House of the Good Shep-
herd, the new Tramway enclosure, and
Carter’s Barracks (the mounted police
depot, &c.), separates the Gardens from
the old cemetery. Between this portion
of the street and Cooper-street i the
‘ Rising Sun ’ tavern, in the racket court
of which the international hand ball
matches frequently take place. From the
junction of Devonshire-street, a little
higher up, the street is occupied by neat
cottage residences interspersed with
houses of greater importance until Cleve-
land-street, the boundary of the city, is
reached. It continues its course to Red-
fern, passing the site of the old Albert
Cricket Ground, the cutting up of which
is now regretted, as the Exhibition pro-
ject has completely settled the Domain
practice ground for some time to come.

ELIZABETH

Sydney,
49 Market
Street,


Was named after Capt. A. Phillip, R.N.,
who was the first Governor of the colony,
filling that office from January 26, 1788,
to the 10th December, 1792. Its length
is 044 yards, and it extends from the
Circular Quay on an uninterrupted line
to King-street. Commencing on the east
side from ‘Belmore’ hotel, kept by Thos.
C. Muir, it is intersected by Alfred-street,
in which is situate the
Water Police Office and Station
(J, M. Marsh, Esq. W.P.M.) and flanks
the street as far as the lock-up, the first
range of buildings being occupied as
the Fire-engine Station of No. 2 Volun-
teer Fire Company. Directly opposite
the Water Police Court are the commo-
dious wool stores of Messrs. Mort and Co,
next which are some bonded warehouses.
The vacant piece of ground at the rear of
the Treasury is temporarily occupied
as a Police Barrack for Exhibition pur-
poses. Crossing Bridge-street we come
to the Phillip-street front of the new
Public Offices,
and that portion intended to be devoted
to the accommodation of the Department
of Lands and Works. We think this is
One of the finest pieces of masonry of
which Sydney can well boast. From hence
along both sides of the street to the next
intersection there are several offices mainly
occupied by the Railway, Roads, and
Harbours and Rivers Departments, the
Government Printing Office
PHILLIP STREET
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
a gigantic establishment under the super-
intendence of Thomas Richards, Esq,
Government Printer and Inspector of
Stamps, being at the corner of Bent-
street. Proceeding southward and leaving
the ‘Union Club’ embowered in foliage, on
the right hand side we pass the ‘Blue
Bell Inn,’ another of the oldest taverns
in the city, kept by Benjamin Yeend.
There are several houses of the ancient
Sydney style of architecture on both
sides of the way before we reach Hunter-
street, which here forms the most conve-
nient approach to the Parliamentary Build-
dings. On crossing Hunter-street the
first building of importance is the Office
of the
Inspector General of Police
(E. Fosbery, Esq.), and opposite are the
Offices of the
Comptroller-General of Prisons
(Harold Maclean, Esq.) A few steps
farther on, on the same side as the latter,
the pedestrian will pass the Metropolitan
Transit Commissioners’ Offices,
and which are nearly opposite the
Diocesan Registry and the Church
Society’s House.
There are several Loan Offices estab-
lished in this neighbourhood. The street
here terminates in front of St. James’s
Church.

MACQUARIE
Proclaimed by Governor Macquarie, is
3972 yards in length to Albion-street.
Starting from the Fort the road is taken
round the cliffs of the Inner Domain,
where steps and terraces with orna-
mental palisades have been formed, open-
ing up a magnificent prospect of the har-
bour and the North Shore. On the right
hand, on the rise of the hill, we pass the
top flats of stores, whose basements line
is the Circular Quay, access to which is
afforded by Talbot’s steps, with urinals,
&c, underneath. The first building of
importance is the Treasury, which stands
at the corner of Bridge-street, facing the
Domain Gate, the chief approach to
Government House,
whose quaint chimney stacks and gables
peep through the distant trees. The
buildings in the rear of the sentry box
and military guard-house are the vice-
regal stables and orderlies’ quarters. On
the other side of Bridge-street are the
New Public Offices,
the Macquarie-street frontage being oc-
cupied by the Department of the Chief
Secretary. The elevation is a noble and
highly ornamental one, the design reflect-
ing high credit upon the genius of the
Colonial Architect, James Barnet, Esq.
The next house was built by Sir Daniel
Cooper, Bart, and was then designated
“ The Speaker’s House.” It is now oc-
cupied as the ‘ Reform ’ Club. Immedia-
tely in front of that portion of the Domain
occupied by the International Exhibition
Buildings are a number of large and com-
modious mansions, which are occupied by
the elite of the metropolis, the Council of
Education, and the International Exhibi-
tion Commissioners. At the eastern ter-
minus of Bent-street is the
Free Public Library,
a curious building of the Corinthian order,
with a lending branch in the basement.
Directly opposite is the approach to the
Outer Domain, and are the principal en-
trances to the
‘ Garden Palace,’
near the statue of Sir Richard Bourke,
in the immediate vicinity of which is a
mounted piece of ordnance taken from
the Russians during the siege of Sebas-
49 Market
STREET
topol, and presented to the colony by the
War Department of the Imperial Govern-
ment. Another entrance to the Palace is
at the top of Hunter-street, near the
vacant site of the School of Industry and
the Domain Terrace. Notice of the re-
sumption of this ground and the adjoin-
ing buildings has been recently given to
the owners by the Government, as it is
intended to be appropriated as a site for
the new Houses of Parliament. On the
western side of the street, extending as
far as King-street, there are a number of
fashionable and commodious buildings oc-
cupied by members of Parliament and
others, and some of them as high-class
boarding houses, with the
Parliament Houses, the Infirmary,
and Royal Mint
on the opposite side. A portion of the
Infirmary, facetiously designated by the
late Dr. Lang—as the ‘ Rum Hospital’—
has been demolished. It is proposed to
build another Hospital on this site, but
it would be far better to exchange the
site for one on Phillip Park which is
more adapted for the purpose. At the
head of King-street a hybrid collection of
buildings are attempted to be dignified
by the appellation of the
District and Coroner’s Courts,
and a circular plantation in the centre
faces the Church of St. James, the oldest
ecclesiastical edifice in the colony. The
days of the Hyde Park Barracks, erected
in 1819, by Governor Macquarie, are
happily numbered, as they, with the Vo-
lunteer Drill Shed and Colonial Archi-
tect’s Offices, are intended to be taken
down to make room for the
New Law Courts,
one wing of which will front upon Mac-
quarie-street and another on St. Mary’s
Road. At the head of the avenue, where
stands the statue of Albert the Good,
Macquarie-street enters Hyde Park and
traverses it under umbrageous shades of
indigenous and exotic trees, variegated
by clumps of shrubs, &c, both sections
by Liverpool-street, where, as Macquarie-
street South, it crosses Goulburn and
Campbell streets and Terry’s Gardens,
terminating at Foveaux--street.

Taking its designation from the second
son of George 111, commences at Church
Hill, now called Charlotte Place, at the
junction of Gloucester-street, and extends
to Druitt-street, on the north side of the
Town Hall. It is 1146 yards long.
Passing a small planted reserve at the
comer of the hill the first building to be
seen, of a very antiquated character, is
the
Scots Church,
associated immemorially with the name
of the late Rev. Dr. Lang, having been
built in 1824, shortly after the arrival of
that gentleman. It is situate at the head
of Jamieson-street, above a number of
first-class boarding-houses. Directly op-
posite the Church is ‘Petty’s’ hotel, a
high-class family hotel, and principally
noted from the demise of the scion of a
Royal House, the Prince de Conde,
within its walls. About Margaret-street
the visitor will find several boarding-
houses of a first-class character, some of
them models of architectural construc-
tion. The street then runs along the
western boundary of Wynyard Square,
beautifully laid out as a reserve with
shrubs and plants and neat walks, sur-
rounded by a dwarf wall and iron railing.
Near Frskine-street is a fine block of
buildings, occupied by Messrs. Cowan
and Co, and Messrs. Horace Woolnough
and Co. Passing the ‘ Occidental’ hotel,
usually pretty well crowded with visitors,
we have a number of solid and substan-
tial business places, which have been
erected within a short space of time,
among which may be noticed John Frazer
and Co, The Daily Telegraph, Robert
Gray and Sons, Messrs. Wm. Collins and
Son, Messrs. D. Jones and Co’s carpet
and bedding warehouse. In this vicinity
the * Post Office’ hotel, on the western
side of the street, has always been a
very famous house of call. At the
corner of King-street east there is a
good and comfortable inn, the ‘Forbes’
hotel. Here we have the Temperance
boarding establishment of Mr. Thomas,
which has lately undergone considerable
changes. The old houses on the space at
the opposite corner have been taken
down, and a new music-hall is to be
erected on the site for Messrs. Kelly
94 Market
STREET
and Leon, the professors of the mimic
art, who have met with such liberal
encouragement in Sydney as to induce
them to make a permanent settlement
in the mother colony of Australia. The
handsome elevation which next attracts
the eye is that of the stores of Messrs.
Macarthur and Co, Alderson and Sons,
and others of considerable importance. A
little further on, on the same side, is the
Wesleyan Centenary Chapel,
the largest meeting-house belonging to
that connection in the colony. The
Queen’s Theatre,
formerly the Lyceum, and the scene of
many of the best impersonations of the
late Mr. G. V. Brooke, a short distance
away ; and there are several large ware-
houses of the leading ironmongers, Messrs.
Drysdaleand Roberts (successors to Messrs
P. N. Russell and Co), and F. Lassetter
and Company (limited), on both sides of
the thoroughfare, also Messrs. Saber and
Sons. From the corner of Market-street,
and in front of the branch station of the
Volunteer Fire Company, No. 2, and the
atelier of Mr. Mitchelson (the Inspector
of Weights and Measures), run the pre-
mises of Messrs. Friend and Co, Martin and
Pain (successors to W. G. Ainsworth and
Go), agricultural implement importers,
&c, and the Freemasons’ Hall, a portion
of which is kept by Mr. Hook as an hotel.
The hall is frequently let for public
meetings, bazaars, concerts, &c. Messrs.
Dixson and Sons’ tobacco manufactory
comes next. At the corner of the next
right-of-way is Mr. W. Beattie’s ‘ Gar-
deners’ Arms ’ —the well-known house of
call for market-gardeners, bird-fanciers,
and sporting men of all classes. Adjoin-
ing is the printing and publishing office
of the Freeman''s Journal. On the site of
the old Synagogue a magnificent suite of
offices has been erected by the Industrial
Provident Building Society, the business
of which, as a financial institution, has
attained unexampled importance. An old
house (the Police Office Hotel) and a van
and dray-stand in Druitt-street terminates
the thoroughfare, the left side being occu-
pied by the Central Police Office, and the
public entrance to the lock-up.

CLARENCE
Taking its name from William Henry,
Duke of Clarence (afterwards King
William IV), also commences at Char-
lotte-place, with a fine lot of houses called
Grosvenor-terrace, near the junction of
Princes-street, and, strictly speaking,
terminates in Druitt-street. It has a
length of 1137 yards. On the east side are
St. Phillip’s Church and Schools,
the former being surrounded by a neat
palisading and shrubbery. The structure
is Italian-Gothic, and it is replete with
ornate ecclesiastical decorations. It has
a fine peal of bells, having the most per-
fect musical tones in Sydney, and which,
as they were presented by the Hon. John
Campbell, M.L.C., ring out merrily
throughout the anniversary of the birth-
day of the donor. The communion ser-
vice was presented in 1803 by the King.
It bears the following inscription :
“This service of communion-plate was
presented by His Majesty King George
111, for the use of the chapel at His
Majesty’s settlement at Sydney, in New
South Wales, in 1803. 1.H.5.” It
arrived in the colony on Anniversary
Day, 1804. The majority of the houses
in this street are of a tumble-down
character, but as fast as the old leases
and freeholders die out the sites in the
course of time will be appropriated to
more noble and economic purposes. It is
at the juncture of King and Clarence
streets, where the buses for several of
STREET
Masonic Temple,
49 Market Street, Sydney,
the suburbs have their stand. Crossing
King-street we have the factory of Messrs.
Macarthur and Co. Opposite is Messrs.
Triggs, Marr, & Taylor’s well-established
iron foundry and Mr. Saywell’s tobacco
factory. Some new warehouses and stores
have been erected recently at the south-
ern end, and just before we reach Druitt-
street we see the western front of the
Masonic Hall, built in the modern style.
Directly opposite is the
built under the auspices of the Grand
Lodge of New South Wales, working
under a constitution somewhat at variance
with, and independent of, the constitutions
of the English, Scottish, and Irish lodges.
Crossing Druitt-street into the Town
Hall enclosure —a part of the old burial-
ground now planted with indigenous and
exotic trees—the continuation of Clar-
ence-street is reached. At the southern
fane the Deanery premises intervene
between the Cathedral, the imposing
western front of which, with its lofty
towers, completely eclipse the more pri-
mitive and unpretending buildings com-
prising St. Andrew’s Scots Church, the
Lyceum schoolroom (where many candi-
dates have been successfully ‘ ‘ coached ”
for passing the Civil Service examina-
tions), and the Baptist Church, the latter
of which has latterly been renovated and
almost rebuilt with some claim to archi-
tectural effect and beauty of design.

This street was named after the father of
Her Most Gracious Majesty, His Royal
Highness the Duke of Kent. It runs from
the foot of the waters forming the eastern
indentation between Dawes’ and Miller’s
Points by Windmill-street, and is 2266
yards in length. Starting from the ‘ Lord
Nelson ’ inn, at the corner of Argyle-
street, the scene of many a turbulent
electioneering meeting, the houses are
mostly of a respectable, but unostenta-
tious, character. At the corner of Argyle-
street and Kent-street is the old watch-
house. The first building of importance
from this is
St. Bridget’s Church
so secluded that many persons might pass
without noticing it. There are several
fine terraces of houses on both sides of the
street. Next we come to St. Bridget’s
school, opposite the Flagstaff Hill, the
steep precipice of which has been railed
in, thereby preventing the recurrence of
fatal accidents; many occurred before
these preventive measures were taken. A
flight of steps at Agars-street, leading to
the Observatory, has recently been con-
structed. Gas-lane leads to the extensive
works of the
Australian Gaslight Company
which was founded in the year 1835, and
is one of the richest corporations in Syd-
ney. Crescent-street, Charlotte-place, and
KENT STREET.
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
Margaret-street next intersect. There are
a large number of hotels—some of a
highly respectable character along the
whole line of this street, and low lodging-
houses abound. With the exception of
the Lion Mills, an extensive block of
buildings lately erected by Messrs. Blair,
Lyons, and Co, as a flour, spice, and rice
mill, and the extensive rope works of
Messrs. A. Forsyth and Co, adjoining,
there are no places of interest on the
route until Market-street is passed, when
St. John’s (R.C.) Church and Schools,
separated by some intervening buildings
are passed. On the opposite side of the
strreet are the wine and spirit stores of
M. De Lissa. Between Druitt and Bathurst
streets several houses boasting some re-
mains of gentility (Dr. Rutter, a late
coroner, occupying the comer one) struggle
to maintain an air of respectability in the
neighbourhood, but all of them are now
kept open as cheap boarding-houses. The
Scots Church manse, and what was
formerly St. Andrew’s model school, and
an old watch-house, fill up the space to
Bathurst-street. The
City Night Refuge and Soup Kitchen,
under the superintendentship of Mr. H. B.
Lee, working by direction of an influential
committee of philanthropists, is situated
on the west side, just before Liverpool-
street—the terminus —is reached.

Derives its name from one of the Queen’s
uncles, His Royal Highness the Duke
of Sussex, the seventh son of George the
Third, who was for many years the chief
light and ruler of the English Freemasons.
It is about one mile in length—being
1766 yards to its terminus at Hay-street.
It has an enormous traffic, running
parallel with all the wharves on the skirts
of Darling Harbour, Commencing at the
Grafton Wharf, the place of embarkation
for the Tasmanian steamers, and the
Richmond River line of steamers, it
passes the Clarence and Richmond River
Company’s Wharf premises, and the
wharf formerly occupied by the Aus-
tralian Steam Navigation Company, now
leased by Messrs John Frazer and Co,
the flour-mills of Messrs. Boylson, and
the ‘ Royal Standard ’ public-house being
situate on the eastern side. The ap-
proaches to the wharves are all on the
western side. After passing Margaret-
place is the Brisbane Wharf. Next this
is the wharf and extensive timber-yards
of Mr. John Taylor, ex-mayor of Balmain,
and now alderman of that flourishing
suburb, and of the City of Sydney. At
the north-eastern intersection of Erskine-
street is the * Blue Bell, ’ of well known
celebrity, kept by Mr. John Longford,
a very old colonist. At the foot of Ers-
kine-street is the Phoenix Wharf (the pro-
perty of the Illawarra Steam Company),
the Victoria Wharf, the Balmain, Pyr-
mont, and Lane Cove Ferries, with
Bethel Wharf, the site of the first church
for mariners. The adjoining wharves are
occupied by the Manning River, and the
Newcastle Steam Navigation Company,
near which are the extensive stores of
Messrs. Potts and Paul, ship chandlers,
and Mr. Robert Craig, sailmaker ; on the
opposite side of Erskine-street is Mr.
Charles Halliday’s engineering establish-
ment of many years standing. A few
yards southerly from Erskine-street, on
the eastern side, is a neat, yet handsome,
structure,
St. Luke’s Church of England.
49 Market
SUSSEX STREET
Street,
Sydney.
A short distance from this, on the oppo-
site side of the street, is the entrance to
Mason’s Patent Slip Wharf ; and by way
of the next intersecting thoroughfare—■
King-street—access is obtained to the
Parramatta River Steamers’ Wharf ; the
Caledonian Wharf, occupied by the New
Manning River Company ; and on the
opposite side the Commercial Wharf,
used by the Clarence and New England
steamers ; and the Melbourne Steam
Navigation Company’s (Struth’s) Wharf.
At one corner of King-street is Yeend’s
‘ Commercial ’ hotel, a celebrated political
and commercial resort; at the other the
Western Branch of the City Bank.
The intervening spaces on both sides of
the road are occupied principally by
produce salesmen and commission agents.
Near Market-street we have Captain
Broomfield’s warehouse, and next to it
the firm of Messrs. Milne Brothers,
brass founders and coppersmiths, turning
out work of a very superior description ;
then Bradley’s ironworks, &c, facing the
Corporation Reserve, cattle sale-yards,
Market Wharf, and the Corporation
Stores, built by Mr. A. Kethel, which
forms the southerly flank to the capa-
cious wharf of the New Hunter River
Steam Navigation Company.
Wharf-street, which is a continuation
of the intersection of Market-street, leads
to Pyrmont Bridge. The principal place
of business in this street are the well-
known premises of Messrs. Buzacott and
Armstrong, ship-chandlers.
The ‘Dundee Arms,’ opposite the Globe
stores, north of the Cattle Saleyards, was
formerly noted as being kept by “ Jock
Robertson,” who is reputed to have lived
the best half of a decade over a century.
Along the western side of Sussex-street,
from Market-street to Bathurst-street,
access is had to the Baltic, Albion, and
Street’s shipping wharves, the line of stores
only being broken by the ‘ Labour in Vain,’
—a hostelry of some importance some 20
or 30 years ago. On the eastern side are


the ‘ Governor Bourke ’ inn, a few lodg-
ing-houses are succeeded by timber-
yards, and Ainsworth’s agricultural
implement depot, a terrace of good-look-
ing shops, with a resident apothecary of
considerable skill succeeding. A foundry
established by Mr. John Smith (one of
the original members of the Amalgamated
Society of Engineers who migrated to
t.hia colony at the instance of the late
Rev. T)r. Lang) now flourishes under
fresh management, and a number of
ancient, dilapidated, single-storied tene-
ments at the comer of Druitt-street have
been taken down, and a neat row of shops
are being erected in their stead. There
are several old-fashioned public-houses a
little higher up, but nothing worth notice
until Bathurst-street is reached. At the
north-eastern corner is the ‘ Lighthouse’
hotel, an airy and well-furnished house,
kept by Mr. Ricketts ; and at the oppo-
site angles the * Robert Burns ’ tavern
and bakery of Messrs. Jacobs Brothers,
and the ‘ Sir Walter Scott ’ inn. Passing
Jacobs’ bakery, the next establishment
of importance is the vinegar works of
Mr. Monk, and the lane leading to the
Woollen mills of Mr. Vicars, whose
fabrics have won world-wide reputation
by carrying off prizes at the London,
Paris, and Philadelphian Exhibitions.
Next door is the private residence of Mr.
S. J. Fletcher, of the Markets, rendered
conspicuous by having a well-constructed
aviary, sometimes crowded with every
variety of feathered songster and birds of
plumage rare, in the side area. Opposite
are a range of buildings, principally the
property of Lady Lisgar, widow of the
late Sir John Young ; and a back slum,
also the property of her ladyship, and
called St. John’s-place, which, in common
with many other lanes in the locality, has
been severely condemned by the Health
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
Commission and City Health Officer.
A bright and healthy oasis intervenes in
the shape of the
SIJSSEX-STREET PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
built by the Council of Education in the
year 1875, and has a large attendance of
children. At the south-east corner of
Liverpool-street is the
Mission Chapel,
which owes its erection to the self-deny-
ing and self-sacrificing efforts of the late
Rev. Nathaniel Pidgeon, who devoted the
best years of his life and all his means to
evangelical efforts in this portion of the
City. Religious services are performed
every Sunday, and on week evenings in
the chapel, and the school-room under-
neath affords evening accommodation
for those who are engaged in the Temper-
ance cause. Before reaching Goulburn
street we pass the iron-works of Mr.
Wright, who, as the manufacturer of
ploughs, has taken numerous Exhibition
prizes and certificates of honor. The old
Oddfellows’ Hall, where the first Public
school was held, has fallen into decadence
since the erection of the more majestic
temple of the fraternity in Elizabeth-
street, and is now occupied occasionally
as an assembly-room. Before we reach
the Commercial Steam Flour-mills, there
is a vacant space which marks the former
site of the murder of “ Kangaroo Liz,” by
William Henry Scott ; and the more re-
cent outrage which had a fatal result and
led to the conviction of Joseph Cooper
for the crime of manslaughter. The other
side of the street forms the back premises
of several establishments in George-street;.
and the street terminates at Hay-street
with the old-established wine store of
Messrs. Cooper, Nathan, and Co.

Haying thus traversed the leading
thoroughfares, we may content ourselves
with a brief reference to the cross streets
of the city, commencing with Margaret-
place, which runs from the A.S.N. Go’s
old wharf to Clarence-street, and is then
styled Margaret-street, continuing its
course to George-street. The next corres-
ponding intersection is Charlotte-place,
receiving its name from the consort
of George 111, the principal building in
which is St. Patrick’s (R. 0.) Church, a
stately edifice at the junction of Harring-
ton-street, which runs on to the intersec-
tion of Argyle-street near the Ragged
School. Gloucester and Cumberland
streets, farther westward, have a north-
erly course and run over bridges to the
end of Lower George-street; andPrinces-
street, intersected by Essex-street, termi-
nates at Caraher’s steps, leading to Lower
Fort-street, just beyond Argyle-street.
At the head of Essex-street and Upper
Fort-street stands the Fort-street Model
Public School, an attractive but old-
fashioned building, formerly used as a mili-
tary hospital. Upper Fort-street, skirting
the Flagstaff Reserve, runs northerly,
and, taking an oblique turn, terminates at
Argyle-street, by Watson’s-road. The
Government Observatory stands on the
above-mentioned reserve, and is presided
over by Mr. Russell and competent assist-
ants. The Argyle-cut—an excavation and
tunnel in the sandstone—was made in the
olden time to connect the city with the
rocks. Near the junction of Lower Fort-
street stands Holy Trinity Church, a
structure of remarkably pleasing style,
and in contiguity therewith, at the top of
the steps, in Princes-street, is the Good-
enough Naval House, an institution
founded as a retreat for seamen by sub-
scription as a memorial to Commodore
Goodenough, R.N., who was fatally
wounded by a Polynesian native during
a cruise. Argyle-street, from its junction
with Kent-street, forms the principal ap-

proach to Windmill-street, Moore’s-road,
and Miller’s Point, where are the large
and capacious wharves of Messrs. Dibbs
and Co, Captain Smith, and Moore’s
wharf, the depot of the P. and O.
Company’s boats.
The north-eastern division of the city
from George-street by Hunter-street, is
bounded by the Circular Quay (Alfred-
street, late Albert-street) on the north,
and on the east by Government House
grounds, the Parliamentary-buildings, &c,
and the Garden Palace and the
Inner and Outer Domains. Bridge-street
runs in an easterly direction up to the
gates of Government House, past the
Exchange, the new Lands Offices, &c,
on the southern side, and the Crown
Lands Occupation Office at the junction
of Macquane-place. In the latter stands
an obelisk from which the various road-
distances of the colony take their
measurement. Gresham and Spring
streets fill up a triangular space, with
the Exchange at the northern angle, em-
bracing many edifices of princely pro-
portions, occupied by mercantile
firms of the highest standing, em-
bracing the agencies of the Pacific
and the Orient Steam Navigation Com-
panies (Gilchrist, Watt, and Co), the
Oriental Telegraphic Agency, the premises
of Messrs. Bradley, Newton, and Go’s
extensive auction mart, Messrs. Mason
Brothers, Cohen & Co, and the Liverpool
and London and Globe, and London and
Lancashire Insurance Companies, and the
Bank of New Zealand. Bent-street com-
mences at the head of these streets near
O’Connell-street. The principal build-
ings are the Australian and Union Club
Houses, the Government Printing Office,
and the Free Public Library. Bligh-
street, which takes its name from a late
Governor, the cause of the mutiny of the
‘ Bounty, ’ takes a southerly course from
Bent-street towards Castlereagh-street,
and also terminates in Hunter-street.


There are many substantial shops and
places of business in this street, which
terminates on the eastern side of George-
■treet.
The western block is bounded by the
waters of Darling Harbour, on the north
by Margaret-street, and on the south
by Liverpool-street West. The inter-
secting streets are Erskine, King, Market,
Druitt, and Bathurst Streets. Erskine-
street runs from the Balmain Ferries
as far as York-street, and there is a
large traffic by these and the Pyrmont
Ferry. King-street extends from the
Corporation Wharf, now occupied by the
Parramatta River S. N. Company to the
District Court and other buildings in
Macquarie-street. On its southern line
are St. James’s Church, the Insolvent
Court, and the Supreme Court. On the
opposite side are the * Oxford ’ hotel
premises—occupying a considerable por-
tion of Enmore-terrace. From the point
of junction with Castlereagh-street several
extensive buildings, such as Temple-
court, Vaughan’s-chambers, &c, have
recently been erected. Towards the
foot of King-street are branch Post and
Telegraph Offices and a branch of the
City Bank. It should be mentioned that
Barrack-street and Wynyard-street
chiefly occupied by mercantile houses—
are short intersecting streets between the
streets of Margaret and King. In the
former, which faces the Post Office clock,
is the Savings’ Bank of New South Wales
(head office), and the office of the newly-
launched candidate for public favour,
the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Market-
street runs westerly from Hyde-
park. The chief places of interest
are the City Markets. Wharf-street com-
mences at the foot of this street, and
conects it with Pyrmont bridge. Druitt-
street, with its severe pinch of road, com-
mences at Chapman Brothers’ engineering
works and finishes at the Town Hall.
This street is noted for being the ‘ ‘ ton-
trial ” for horses sold with a guarantee by
most auctioneers. Bathurst-street extends
from Elizabeth-street, in front of the
“ Thornton Smelling Bottle,” The Bank
of New South Wales has a branch at the
corner of George-street opposite the
Cathedral. The next building, sur-
mounted by an elegant campanile, is the
Sydney Fire Insurance Brigade station,
the members of which, under the super-
intendence of Mr. C. J. Bown, are always
at their post when the alarm sounds in
token of a conflagration. The land situate
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
in Barker-street between Sussex-street
and the harbour was once a busy hive of
industry, being occupied by the enter-
prising firm of Messrs. P. N. Russell and
Co. as an iron foundry and railway car-
riage manufactory ; but they have with-
drawn their capital from the colonial
market. Liverpool-street West commences
at Messrs. Chadwick and Co.’s wharf.
This firm has extensive saw-mills in the
locality. As Liverpool-street East it is
continued from College-street to the
heights of Darlinghurst. The principal
buildings are the Unitarian Church (just
completed) opposite Hyde-park, and the
splendid mansions known as Lyons’-ter-
race. College-street, one of our most
fashionable streets, forms the eastern
boundary of Hyde-park, and extends
from Liverpool-street to St. Mary’s Cathe-
dral. The Sydney Grammar School and
the Museum stand near and at the junc-
tion of Park-street, which in turn inter-
sects Hyde-park. The statue of Captain
Cook has a commanding position opposite
the classical front of the Museum. Park-
street ceases at this building, and the
thoroughfare takes the name of William-
street, which will be further spoken of
under the head of Woolloomooloo. A few
hundred yards from the bottom of Liver-
pool-street are Harbour and Dixon-streets,
the former of which passes the works of
the Sydney Food and Ice Works, estab-
lished by the late T. S. Mort, Esq. (a man
of Mancastrian origin), the Darling Har-
bour Railway Depot, and Mr. Zollner’s
tin and zinc works. Both these streets
communicate with Hay-street, where the
Castlemaine Brewery, Messrs. Harris and
Go’s produce depot, the cooperage of
Messrs McCormack, and other large
places of business, are located. Goulbum-
street commences at Dixon-street, oppo-
site Kidman’s flour-mills, and continues
to Little Brisbane-street, from whence it
runs to Surry Hills. Campbell-street is
to the north of the Belmore Markets and
Haymarket Reserve, and takes a similar
direction. Hay-street, east of George-
street, terminates at Elizabeth-street,
passing at the Pitt-street junction Dr,
Fullerton’s Presbyterian Church and
schools, and the Wesleyan Chapel.
Woolloomooloo, a populous suburb,
chiefly inhabited by the more respectable
classes of society, commences, strictly
speaking at St. Mary’s-road, the northern
boundary of the new Cathedral now in
eourse of erection, and running into


Woolloomooloo-street, shortly after pass-
ing St. Mary’s Seminary and the Pro-
Cathedral. Boomerang-street runs down
from the head of College-streetto W illiam-
street, between Cook and Phillip Parks.
The principal streets commencing from
the Domain, and the Cowper Wharf at
the head of the Bay, are Riley-street
(from Woolloomooloo-street only), Crown-
street, Palmer-street, Bourke-street,
Forbes-street, Brougham-street, Victoria-
street, and Macleay-street, leading to
Potts’ Point the most aristocratic
portion of the City and its environs.
The principal gentlemen’s seats are
‘ Grantham ’ —Mr. H.C. Dangar’s, a castel-
lated mansion, and ‘ Clarens ’ the delight-
ful and highly embellished residence of
Sir James Martin (C. J.) At the head of
Macleay-street, William-street branches
off into two sections—William-streets
(North and South) bothleadingto theboun-
dary of the City at Rushcutter Bay, where
a public reserve is now gazetted, and
a considerable extent of ground is
being reclaimed for the purpose of a recrea-
tion ground. In William-street, at the
head of Forbes-street, is a handsome
Wesleyan Church. The Bank of New
South Wales has a branch at the corner
of Palmer-street, and at the intersec-
tion of Boomerang-street is the Hospital
for the Indigent Blind. Opposite, at
the corner of Yurong-street, are the
Public Schools. On the space between
that and the Museum, it is intended to
build a new Free Public Library and
Gallery of Arts —the plans of which were
approved by Mr. John Sutherland, M.P.,
when he filled the office of Minister of
Public Works. Riley-street, Crown-
street, and Bourke-street, further extend
in a southerly direction, still preserving
the order named, across Oxford-street, to
Surry Hills. This street (Oxford-street)
runs in a south-easterly direction, from
College-street to the heights of Darling-
hurst. On the right hand side, at the
commencement, is the Cambridge Club
Hotel, one of the finest establishments in
the City, with a view from the the north
east of the whole of Hyde Park and
the principal edifices of the City ; photo-
graphed impressions from the upper
portion of the premises would command,
as a novelty, a ready and extensive sale.
Hardy Brothers have a very large and
■ornamental furniture emporium at the
corner of Brisbane-street, and the
shops along the line of route carry
on an extensive business. To the right
49 Market
and left, at the crossing of Bourke-street,
are the commodious hotels of Mr. John-
ston, Mr. Cassidy, and Mr. J. E. Kelsey,
directly opposite Darlinghurst Court
House. At the junction of Bourke and
Forbes-street is the Lunatic Receiving
House and the Darlinghurst Police
Station, and the gloomy walls of the
Gaol frown on Forbes-street. The
Church of the Sacred Heart is seen in the
distance on the road to Paddington, and a
a little further on is the Victoria Barracks
within that borough. The street above
Bourke-street is Botany-street—it leads
direct to Moore Park gates, where Park
Road takes a turn to the left of the main
Road to Randwick, and Dowling-street
goes in a straight line to the South.
There is a Congregational Church in
Bourke-street, and a Public School, and
Municipal Reservoir in Crown-street.
The most important bye-streets are
Albion, Fitzroy and Foveaux-streets, the
latter extending westwards from Park
Road to Elizabeth - street opposite
Belmore Gardens. Devonshire-street com-
mences between the Benevolent Asylum
and the Redfern Railway Station, passing
the Presbyterian, Church of England,
Congregational, Wesleyan, and Hebrew
Cemeteries on the left, and terminating
with Bourke-street on the Surry Hills
continuation. The Churches of St.
Simon and St. Jude, and St. Michael are
in this suburban locality. The review of
the eastern portion of the City, may
conclude at Regent-street, just beyond
the Railway Bridge. This street runs
to Cleveland-street, passes the Mortuary
Chapel on the west flank of the Railway
Station, and the capacious and ornate
Wesleyan Chapel of Chippendale. The
railway tunnel passes under Botany-
Road, just before we pass the Church of
England Denominational School of St.
Paul, the Church itself and the
Parsonage, it continues thence past
Goodlet and Smith’s Pottery on Surry
Hills to the Dowling-street boundary of
Moore Park.
The space between Hay-street and
Harris-street, on the western side of
George-street, is becoming densely popu-
lated owing to the establishing of the
Atlas Foundry and other manufactories
in the neighbourhood. Harris-street
branches off through the Ultimo Estate,
and runs through that property and
Pyrmont a crowded suburb, though yet
considered to be a portion of the City.
To the left, at the commencement of the
Street,
Sydney.


above street, is a commodious Baptist
Chapel, on the right the Government
Railway to the circular iron wharf at the
head of Darling Harbour. The inter-
secting streets are Thomas, Ann, Macar-
thur, William, Quarry and Allen Streets.
In the vicinity of the latter are the cele-
brated quarries from which all the build-
ing stones used in Sydney—a superior
sandstone—are hewn. At Quarry-street,
Pyrmont-street running parallel to Harris
street commences and continues to Point
street. Crown and Jones streets are
parallel thoroughfares to the southward.
They are intersected between Allen and
John Streets by Union-street, which is
connected with the City by Pyrmont
Bridge. At the foot of John-street, and
bounded on the south by Mill-street, is a
point of land facing Jones’ Bay and Dar-
ling Harbour, on which are situated the
patent slip, ship building yards, foundry,
&c, of the Australian Steam Navigation
Company, where a large number of work-
men are constantly employed. The Colo-
nial Sugar Company have erected an ex-
tensive establishment at Pyrmont, and
there are a glassworks, sawmills, &c,
along the water line. The Apollo Stearine
Candle Company have a manufactory and
warehouse near the Bridge. Pyrmont is
bounded on the south by Black Wattle
Swamp, an extensive area of which has
been reclaimed by the Government and
dedicated to public recreation under the
name of ‘Wentworth Park.’
In concluding this brief and imper-
fect sketch of the Metropolis of this
important and still growing colony which,
though discovered by Captain Cook
nearly 110 years ago, was not taken
possession of by England until 18 years
afterwards, we may point with congratu-
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
lation to the satisfactory evidence of its
progress and the fulfilment of the most
ardent anticipation of its founder. When
in 1814, George 111, who had been sitting
in darkness and mental alienation,
awoke to a momentary consciousness he
was told that the great enemy (the first
Bonaparte) was hunted down and caged
at Elba; that the allied sovereigns were
then in London, being feted by his son
the Regent. When the King sank at
length in death in 1820, the historian
records “that he yielded the sceptre of
a far mightier empire to his son than he
had himself received. In Canada, on
the immensely extended territory of
British India, at the Cape, over a
hundred spicy isles in the Western and
Southern Seas, and over broad Australia
stretched the wondrous rule of England.
** * Australia intended only as a
substitute for the lost convict lands of
Kentucky and Maryland —was already
putting forth germs of promise beyond
conception, and bidding fair to be
greater, more loyal, and enriching
beyond America.” Since the acces-
sion, and during the benign sway
of that most gracious Queen who now
‘ ‘ rules over the land that the great Mace-
donian could not conquer, and over a
Continent of which Columbus never
dreamed : the Queen of every sea and
nations of every zone,” concessions were
granted to the Colonies that were neces-
sary to preserve them to the Mother
Country, as well as to ensure their pro-
gress and prosperity. And the Colonists
have not been slow in a spirit of enter-
prise, and with indomitable perseverance
to develops those resources which Dame
Nature has so lavishly bestowed upon the
country, and to achieve for themselves a
greatness among the nations of the earth.

Under the provisions of the Act 23rd
Victoria No. 3, an Act to consolidate and
amend the laws relating to the Corpora-
tion of the City of Sydney, which came
into operation on the Ist August last, it
is enacted the Municipal Council shall
consist of 24 aldermen, three of whom
shall be elected for each ward, and from
whom the Mayor shall be elected. On
or before the first day of July in each
year a list shall be made by the Town
Clerk of all persons capable under the pro-
visions of the Act of voting in and for
the election of Aldermen and Auditors,
and no citizen owing rates shall have his
name retained on such list. Revision
Courts will be holden at stated periods to
amend and settle the lists in each ward,
and no citizen will be allowed to vote
whose name is not on the roll. The Act
enacts the principle of the cumulative
vote, on the following scale : —Every
citizen that pays rates upon property as-
sessed at the annual value of £25 shall
have one vote; exceeding £25 and not
exceeding £75, two votes; £75 and not
exceeding £l5O, three votes ; exceeding
£l5O, four votes ; and no citizen shall be
entitled to more than four votes in any
one ward, or to vote otherwise than in res-

pect of the aggregate or collective value
at which his property in any one ward is
assessed. On the first day of December
in the present year eight aldermen shall
be elected, one for each ward, in order
that the Council may be composed of 24
aldermen, the eight aldermen that should
have retired under the old Act holding
office until the year 1880, when they must
resign and eight others be elected in their
places, the other eight to retire in 1881.
In 1882 the aldermen elected in Decem-
ber next will be the first to retire.
Written nominations of aldermen will be
received with the consent of the persons
nominated, until noon of the fifth day
previous to any such election ; and
two days before the election, and on
the day of election the lists of persons
nominated will be published in two daily
newspapers. The voting will be in the
usual way by ballot, and immediately
after the ballot boxes have been de-
livered by the several presiding officers
to the returning officer, the ballot papers
shall be examined and the votes counted
by the Returning Officer, and such other
presiding officers and scrutineers as may
attend, and the result of the election
shall be thereby ascertained; and the


Mayor shall on the second day after the
election declare, in the Gazette to be pub-
lished for that purpose and in two daily
newspapers, the names of those aldermen
that are elected. The Mayor must be
elected by the Council on the 9th Decem-
ber in every year, and shall enter into
office on the Ist January thereafter -en-
suing. The disqualification clauses re-
main as in the old Act. The commission
of any acts of bribery, as defined in the
44th section, will disqualify the person
by or for whom they were committed
from holding any municipal office for
three years. Disputed elections or exer-
cise of office when incapable to be referred
to the Supreme Court, but no rule or
order of the court shall be granted if at
the time of the application for such order
more than one month has elapsed. The
Council may determine the rates of re-
muneration of the Mayor and auditors.
The Council, after due notice given to
occupants to pave the footpaths of the
city, may perform the work themselves
and charge the expense to the tenant,
the amount being held to be a rate
and be recoverable in the same way
as the city rate. The tenant how-
ever may recover the amount from the
landlord if no covenant exists to the con-
trary. Dangerous buildings and en-
croachments may be taken down or re-
moved at the owner’s expense. Persons
blasting without a license will be liable
to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds nor
less than one pound. Cellars or openings
in footways are not permitted under
penalty of not less than ten pounds and not
more than fifty pounds, and if two justices
order the removal of such works the
offender shall be liable to a fine of ten
pounds for every day the order remains
uncomplied with. Provision is made
with regard to the assessment which is
to be made according to the fair average
annual value of the property, with a
reduction therefrom for outgoings not in
any case exceeding ten per cent. On the
assessment so made the Council may fix
a rate exclusive of lighting not exceeding
two shillings in the pound which shall be
designated “ the City Rate.” In assess-
ing the average annual value of unoccu-
pied land the value shall be deemed to
be a sum not exceeding six per cent, per
annum, on the estimated capital value
of such land. Notice of the assessment,
against which an appeal may be laid,
must be served upon the respective pre-
mises whether occupied or not. No
Excelsior Steam Printing Works,
land vested in trustees for pur-
poses of public recreation, and no
Hospital, Benevolent Asylum, or other
building used solely for charitable pur-
poses, or any building used solely for
public worship, or any school under the
Public Schools Act, will be liable to
be assessed or rated. Power is given to
the Corporation to erect new markets,
cattle sale yards, &c, with power to
charge fees and to lease the same. The
water-rate is fixed as heretofore at ss.
per room, and a fine of not exceeding
£5O will be indicted where closet pipes
communicate directly with the main. If
the owners of property do not fix closet
cisterns they will be liable to a penalty,
and the tenant after due notice can fix
the same and deduct the charge from the
rent. The powers and duties of the
Health Officer are extended, and licenses
can be granted to remove night soil.
The Council are to cause cesspits to be
emptied, and any tenant not giving notice
of any nuisance or connection with such,
shall be liable to a fine of not less than
£lO. In certain cases, after notice from
the Inspector of Nuisances, the Council
may fill up any gutter, drain, closet, or
well —reasonable expenses to be repaid
by owners. Power is given to the
Inspector of Nuisances to enter premises
where he suspects the existence of a
nuisance. Until Parliament has passed
an act to transfer the control of the
sewerage to some other authority, the
powers of constructing drains and sewers,
and the power to collect sewerage rates
is vested in the Council. The Act enacts
that a temporary endowment of £25,000
a year shall be paid out of the Consoli-
dated Revenue Fund to the Council, and
the Council are relieved from further
indebtedness for sewerage, water, and
general purposes. The proceeds of auc-
tioneers licenses are to go to the City
Fund, and the Council may grant licenses
to persons for hawking and selling in the
City any poultry, fish, vegetables, garden
produce, and such other articles as may
be provided in any by-law to fix the
fees payable therefor, to fix the periods
and conditions on and under which such
licenses shall be in force, and for regulat-
ing such hawking generally. On the
expiring of the ten years during which the
temporary endowment (£25,000 per an-
num) will be paid, the Council may raise
money on mortgage of the rates, provided
that no money borrowed under such
mortgage shall exceed the entire revenue


of the Council for five years. All penal-
ties under the Act or By-laws passed
thereunder must be paid to the City Fund.
Power is given to the Council to make
by-laws, not only for the regulation of
their own proceedings, and the duties and
salaries of their officers and servants, the
mode of holding and determining the
validity of elections, the collection of all
rates, and the preparation of the rolls, but
the suppression of all nuisances, and of
houses of ill-fame and disorderly houses,
the promotion of public health and
public decency, the keeping of all

bathing for the sole use of either sex
respectively, and for requiring persons
bathing to wear appropriate clothing,
the erection and use of baths or bathing-
houses or machines and charging license
and other fees for the same, and the

such by-laws, fix the maximum penalty
for every offence against such by-laws, or
any of them, not exceeding the penalty, if
any already lawfully fixed for the same
offence, and in any other case not exceed-
ing ten pounds.
Another important Act, conferring
many new powers upon the Council, was
passed last session of Parliament, viz,
the 42 Victoria No. 25 —An Act to make
better provision for the construction of
buildings, and for the safety and health of
the inhabitants within the City of
Sydney, or
The City of Sydney Improve-
ment Act.
Non-professional readers may be in'
formed that the law provides for the ap-
pointment of a body styled an Improve-
ment Board, to consist of not less than
five members, one of whom shall be a
professional architect, another a practical
builder, and a third a medical practi-
tioner, who shall have the power of deal-
ing with any complaints in the way of
appeal against any officer under the Act.
The members of this board are entitled to
a fee of one guinea each on every
reference or appeal made to them,
to be deposited in the first instance
by the party making the reference. If
the members of the board agree to sit
for the consideration of the same, the
fee to be paid will be two guineas each.
The City Council have the power of li-
censing persons to perform all work with
drainage and sewerage, no person to com-
mence any work in connection therewith
except so licensed or under the control
of a person so licensed. Breaches of the
provision in this respect will render un-
licensed persons liable to a penalty of not
less than forty shillings nor more than £5
per day for every day during which such
unlicensed person is employed thereon.
No land is to be laid out or sold for build-


ing purposes except with, the approval of
the Council. The Act provides for the
appointment of a City Building Surveyor
to receive notices and carry out all regula-
tions, &c, in the Act, and who shall on
"behalf of the City Council be empowered
to collect building fees for the inspection
of newly erected buildings, &c. Any
buildings begun without notice to the
City Surveyor shall be declared a common
nuisance, and second and third-class
buildings shall not be commenced before
the plan has been approved by that
officer and the Health Officer. The Board
may order surveyors to repair, &c, any
building in any ruinous or dangerous
state at the owner’s expense, and if the
Mayor, Surveyor, Health Officer, and In-
spector of Nuisances shall be of opinion
that any room or building is unfit for
human habitation due notice shall be
given to the owner, and if he persists in
letting them he will be liable to a penalty
of £2O, and not less than £2 for every
day and night during which such build-
ings shall be occupied. Closets and
stables not built as the Act provides will
be treated as a nuisance and may be
altered or removed, and no stables are to
be erected only on a site chosen by the
officers, and particulars of every proposed
awning or portico must be sent for ap-
proval to the Surveyor. All buildings
not in conformity to the Act, or danger-
ous to a neighbourhood, to be deemed a
nuisance and proceedings to be taken
thereupon, and it is rendered illegal to
manufacture within the city articles
liable to sudden explosion or inflammable
substances. Manufacturers carrying on
such manufacture will be liable to a fine
of a sum not exceeding £2O nor less than
£lO for every day on which the business
is carried on. A penalty of a sum not
exceeding £5 and not less than £1 may
be inflicted on a chimney taking fire
through neglect; and any person em-
ployed upon any building, doing or caus-
ing any work to be done contrary to the
provisions of the Act, will be liable to a
penalty of a sum not exceeding forty
shillings, or to imprisonment for any
period not exceeding one month if the
penalty be not paid immediately upon
conviction. In case of any fire within
the City of Sydney the City Treasurer, on
the order of the Mayor, may pay the turn-
cock whose water becomes first available
a sum not exceeding twenty shillings, to
the first fire-engine keeper who brings a
fire-engine to the spot a sum not exceed-
ing forty shillings, the second engine
thirty shillings, and the third engine
fifteen shillings. The Act allows of
appeals against the recovery of penalties,
and gives power to the Stipendiary
Magistrate or justices to appropriate any
portion of the penalties imposed by them,
under the provisions of the Act, to the
compensation of the parties sustaining
any damage or wrong for the infraction
of the law. The schedules are volumin-
ous and merit the careful consideration
of landlords and tenants, the owners of
property, contractors, professional men,
and practical builders. The appointments
under the section constituting the Im-
provement Board have been made. The
Board now consists of Mr. Thomas
Garrett, M.L.A., Alfred Roberts, M.D.,
Mr. B. Backhouse, Mr, Bailey, J.P.,
and Mr, Frank Senior, J.P,
BATHS
The provisions for bathing are liberal.
Robinson’s private baths for ladies and
gentlemen now under the management of Mr. Wilson, as agent for the Trustees, are
situated on the western shores of Woolloomooloo Bay—access being had from the
outer Domain, as also the public baths for ladies and gentlemen, erected by the
Corporation. The Council have also erected baths at Dawes’ Point, now leased by
Mr. Ricketts, and also at Pyrmont, which are extensively used and regarded as a
great boon by the inhabitants of that populous locality.
The other private institutions are the Turkish Baths in Bligh-street, originally
erected by Dr, Brereton, and now under the superintendence of Mr. Macadardy, and
the Russian Baths of Mr. Momberg, in Hunter-street. The former are generally used
for the cure and prevention of fibrous and muscular inflammations, and the latter,
under the skilled treatment of Professor Momberg, have proved more than ordinarily
efficacious in the treatment of the majority of chronic and accute diseases. At each
institution the form of process exhibits considerable contrast, but are strongly advocated
in certain cases by the medical faculty.

To be had of the Printers and Publishers, 49 MARKET STREET,
and from all Booksellers.
Hanebooks to the city of Sydney are
becoming numerous. The latest addi-
tion to the list is a publication by Messrs.
Lee and Ross, 49, Market-street, which
is so compiled as to be a street directory,
showing at a glance the position of any
particular building ; as, for example, a
short description of Pitt-street and its
principal buildings is given, and then,
scattered over half-a-dozen pages, comes
a representation of the street itself, like
a surveyor’s plan. “ Herald and Echo,”

Street Directory and Handbook.
—Messrs. Lee and Ross, 49 Market-
street, have sent us a specimen sheet of
a complete “Handbook and Street
Directory of the city of Sydney.” The
book appears to be a most valuable
vade mecum, both to strangers visiting
Sydney, and to the residents. The pub-
lic buildings and the private houses, the
shops and the theatres are all put before
one disentangled from the maze which
usually surrounds them. The clue to the
streets is perfect : and the price is only
one shilling. Go and buy. “ Protestant
Standard,” Sept. 13.
Publication Received. —We have re-
ceived from the publishers, Messrs. Lee
and Ross, 49 Market-street, a specimen
copy of what promises to be a very excel-
lent and useful publication. It is a
“Handbook of the city of Sydney,”
being a complete Street Directory, show-
ing at a glance the exact position of any
number or house, public building, etc.
The compiler, Mr. G, E. Addison, must
have bestowed an imxne nse deal of patient
and painstaking labour upon this work,
and he has succeeded in supplying a want
long felt. In an introductory preface it is
stated that the Handbook is to be issued
quarterly, so that removals may be noted,
and also that subscribers can have their
name and business inserted in the Street
Directory, with copy of the book, for six
shillings per annum. It is also intended,
as the work progresses, to include the
suburbs.—“ Catiiolic Times. ” Sept. 4.
Handbook to the City of Sydney,
—We have been favoured with advance
sheets of what is to be a publication cal-
culated to assist not only strangers who
may come amongst us, but also many of
our citizens who really are puzzled to
find a particular number of any street in
the metropolis. This Handbook will, no
doubt, lead many of our visitors to ask
who had a hand in numbering the houses
of our streets, for the manner in which it
has been done indicates that no system
has been adopted, and the “whole
thing” tends to mislead even those who
are best acquainted with the city, much
less strangers. It will be published at a
popular price, and will, no doubt, meet
with a large sale. As to its usefulness
there can be no possibility of a doubt.

Handbook, —We beg to acknowledge
the receipt of an eight-page specimen
sheet of the “ Handbook to the city of
Sydney,” published by .Messrs. Lee and
Ross, 49 Market-street, Sydney, We
have no hesitation in pronouncing it the
most useful piece of printing done in the
Great Metropolis ; at all events, within
our recollection, which extends to a
quarter of a century. It must prove a
great boon to all persons unacquainted
with the city of Sydney, for this reason,
that strangers have nothing more to do
than sit down and study the little work
for a short time, after which there can-
not be the slightest difficulty in such a
person entering the city with all confi-
dence, and going direct to the place in-
tended when starting from home. We
wish the spirited enterprisers every suc-
cess, and further add—we strongly ad-
vise all to possess themselves of the
work, as they will find it more than
useful. “ Queanbeyan Times,” Sep. 13.
Handbook to the City of Sydney.
—A specimen issue of eight pages of this
publication is before us. A new style of
Street Directory is introduced, being a
combination of both plan and directory.
The system adopted shows the incon-
veuient irregularity existing in the ar-
rangement of street numbers, such as No.
IG4 being opposite No. 215, etc., in Pitt-
street, while George-street is known to
be as bad or even worse. From the
specimen to hand it is impossible to
judge fairly of the real utility of the
publication. In a brief introduction
reference is made to “the principal
streets.” If, however, all streets are not
treated fully, we fail to see that the
Handbook will realise the hopes of the
compiler. Certainly a complete plan of
the whole city should accompany the
Handbook, as it would be next to impos-
sible for a stranger to find his neax-est
way from one pare of the town to another
from the manner in which the streets are
necessarily chopped up in order to accom-
modate them to the length of the octavo
pages.—-“ Goulburn Telegraph.”
Yesterday’s post brought us a speci-
men sheet of Messrs. Lee and Ross’s
“Handbook to Sydney,” which will be
shortly published. It promises to be a
useful work to set strangers in Sydney in
the right path. That city of bullock-
tracks and no-order is puzzling to new
arrivals, and an elaborate Handbook with
explanatory maps has long been a desider-
atum. We recollect that, during our
nrst residence in Sydney, we wished to
buy a Guide-book, and with that pur-
pose entered a well-known stationer’s
shop in Pitt street, not a thousand miles
from the Sydney Herald Office. We
asked an assistant for a Hand-book show-
ing the streets of Sydney. He replied,
“ We have not got one, but we have an
excellent map of New South Wales.”
Visitors to Sydney, and people whose
bump of locality is small, can soon pro-
cure a Jidus Achates for one shilling, and
tradesmen will find the new “ Hand-
book” an excellent medium for adver-
tising. That the “Handbook” may
gradually swell to the size of the London
directorv is the wish of the “ Yass Even-
ing Tribune,” Sept. 9.
Handbook of Sydney. —W r e have re-
ceived from the publishers, Messrs. Lee
and Ross, 49 Market-street, a specimen
sheet of a “Handbook to the city of
Sydney,” which it is intended to pub-
lish quarterly. This Handbook, if pro-
perly filled out, which we believe it will
be, will prove a boon to country visitors
to the Metropolis, as it will furnish them
with a complete Street Directory, and a
quantity of useful information in a small
compass. Every facility is afforded, in
the careful arrangements of the principal
hotels and business places in each street,
for successful search, without pestering
others with questions, and just the sort
of information required by visitors can
be obtained by a glance within its pages.
We have no doubt that this really useful
work will have a large circulation.—
“ Bathurst Free Press,” Sept. 13.
We have received from the publishers,
Messrs. Lee and Ross, 49 Market-street,
a little work, entitled, “ Handbook to the

Directory, showing at a glance the exact
position of any given number or house,
public building, etc.—“ Melbourne Daily
Telegraph,” Sept. 9.
From Lee and Ross, printers, 49 Mar-
ket-street, Sydney, we have received
specimen pages of a “ Handbook to the
city of Sydney,” about to be issued quai-
terly by them. The work will form a
complete Street Directory, showing at a
glance the exact position of any given
number or house. The arrangement of
the streets is novel, but such as a child
might understand. The work ought to
prove invaluable to residents of Sydney
as well as to visitors. The price is one
shilling.—“ Inverell Herald,” Sept. 13.


Handbook to the City of Sydney.—
This is the title of a new, what we may
call, Stranger’s Guide, to the streets, and
all that in them is, of the metropolis. It
is to be issued by Messrs. Lee and Ross,
printers, 49 Market-street, Sydney, and
we have no hesitation in saying, from
the specimen of the book to hand, it is
the best work of the sort-which has yet
been offered to the public. Up the centre
of a page is given a column to represent
a portion of the street (in this case, Pitt-
street), and on each side is shown the
numbers of houses, cross-streets, lanes,
principal public buildings, hotels, busi-
ness places, offices, and so forth. The
book also includes descriptions of public
institutions, churches, places of amuse-
ment, banks, and other affairs more or
less interesting. Armed with the Lee
and Ross’ Hand Book, we venture to say
the most absolute stranger could com-
fortably find his way about the very
crooked and badly-made streets of the
city of Sydney. The price of the book
is but one shilling, and it will, doubtless,
find a ready sale, more particularly
during the coming Exhibition season.—
“ Tenterfield Star,” Sept. 13.
We have received the specimen sheet
of the “ Handbook to the city of Syd-
ney,” compiled by Mr. G. R. Addison,
and published by Lee and Ross, 49
Market-street, Sydney. This little work
is a complete Street Directory, showing
at a glance the exact position of any
given number or house, public building,
etc., and contains a complete list of the
principal hotels and boarding-houses,
where situated, and the charge for ac-
commodation. The work ought to be a
valuable companion to visitors to Sydney
during the exhibition, and should, owing
to its usefulness, command an extensive
sale. “ Jerdderie and Urana Gazette,”

Review. —We have received a speci-
men sheet of a new “ Handbook to the
city of Sydney,” compiled by Mr. G. R.
Addison, and published by Messrs. Lee
and Ross, 49 Market-street, Sydney.
The plan of the work is decidedly novel,
and from its simplicity should be of great
service to strangers visiting Sydney.
Besides a complete Street Directory it
contains a large amount of good infor-
mation. The book is to be issued quar-
terly at the low price of one shilling, and
promises to be a cheap as well as very
valuable work of reference. “ Cooma

Handbook to the City of Sydney.
—Messrs. Lee and Ross, of the Excelsior
Steam Printing Works, 49 Market-street,
Sydney, have mailed us a specimen of
their ‘ * Handbook to Sydney. ” It is a
complete Directory, giving the numbers
of houses in the various streets, and
plainly denoting the public buildings, &c.
Any place can, with the aid of this book,
be readily found by a stranger. We
would advise the residents of Manaro
who intend visiting the big fair to invest
a shilling in the purchase of the Hand-
book, an infallible guide to the stranger
from the country.—“ Manaro Mercury,”
Sept. 10.
We are in receipt of a specimen sheet
of a “ Handbook to the City of Sydney;”
a handy street directory, published by
Messrs. Lee and Ross. This work will
fill a want long felt by visitors from the
country, and save them much trouble. In
a manner that a child can understand it
gives the street, number of the house,
name of occupant, and relative position
to public buildings, so that anyone know-
ing where he wants to go, with this book
in his hand, may find the place without
stopping people to ask questions and re-
ceive directions that would puzzle the
medical faculty to understand. We con-
gratulate Messrs. Lee and Ross upon their
enterprise in meeting the want, and on
the efficient manner they have done it in.
—“Barwon Argus,” Sept. 17.
City of Sydney.—We have received
a pamphlet from the offices of Messrs.
Lee and Ross, publishers, 49 Market-
street, Sydney, and we think it will
prove a success. It is descriptive of the
city and designed to supply a want long
felt by strangers visiting Sydney, of
being able to find any part without the
inconvenience of asking questions ; and
likewise enabling them, on knowing the
name of the street, to discover the exact
locality they may be in, and how to reach
any other part of the city. I'arkes
Chronicle,” Sept. 10.
We have received from Messrs. Lee
and Boss, 49 Market-street, Sydney,
advance sheets of a “Handbook to the
city of Sydney,” which they intend
shortly publishing. This work, which
will be sold at the small price of one shil-
ling, is designed to show at a glance tne
position of every house in Sydney, and
cannot fail to prove most useful to
strangers visiting the city during the
Exhibition.— “Guudagai Times,” fcep. 9.


The “ Hand Book to the city of
Sydney, ” being a complete Street Direc-
tory, showing at a glance the exact
position of any given number of house,
public building, &c., will supply a long-
felt want. f| We speak from experience
when we say that it is just what visitors
to Sydney require. The bushman almost
dreads the metropolis, because he cannot
find out, without much trouble, the per-
sons with whom he wishes to transact
business. As a rule, if you ask a person
in the street where So-and-so lives, he
will hardly deign to answer, and the
visitor has often to submit to a snub
from some puny-looking paper-collared
fop, whose head and pocket are alike
empty. The Handbook, which is only
one shilling, will obviate all this, and the
stranger, whether on business or pleasure,
who does not arm himself with a copy is
undeserving of sympathy if he comes to
grief. The printers and publishers are
Lee and Boss, 49 Market-street, Sydney.
—“The Oddfellow,” Sept. 11.
From Messrs. Lee and Ross, of the
Excelsior Steam Printing Works, 49
Market-street, Sydney, we have received
a specimen sheet of a new ‘ * Handbook
to the city of Sydney,” which is now in
the press, and will shortly be published
at a very moderate price. The arrange-
ment is a novel one, and such as at a
glance to enable a stranger or a country
visitor to Sydney at once to discover any
particular establishment he desires. This
“Handbook” promises to be of more
lasting usefulness than a mere Exhibition
convenience—although it will equally
prove the latter—and when completed
will be eminently serviceable to every
visitor to the metropolis from whatsoever
direction he may arrive, and whensoever
he may visit Sydney.—“Yass Courier,”
Sept. 9.
Handbook to the City of Sydney.—
The firm of Lee and Ross, publishers, 49
Market-street, has rendered good service
to the colony by issuing, just at the right
moment, an excellent handbook to the
metropolis. Business directories have
been published for many years past, but
these directories do not supply the want
which has called the “Handbook” into
existence. Then again, the high price at
which the directories are necessarily sold,
and the bulk of the volumes (for they
include the whole of the Australasian
colonies) prevent their circulation amongst
the masses of the people. The * ‘ Hand-
book, ” on the other hand, confines itself
to Sydney, may be purchased for a shil-
ling, can be carried in the pocket, and
gives its information in such a terse and
explicit style that “he that runs may
read.” The first sheet has been sent as a
specimen to this office. The arrangement
is really excellent and reflects great credit
on the compiler, Mr. G. R. Addison. In
the street directory every house with its
proper number and side of the street on
which situated is given, and also the
intersections of the streets and to which
they lead. Country visitors to Sydney
for the Exhibition would do well to pro-
cure a copy of this handbook before going
to Sydney, as by means of it they will,
when in town, be able to effect a great
saving of time and trouble.—“ Western
Independent,” Bathurst, 9th Sept.
Lee and Ross’s Handbook to Sydney.
—We have received the specimen sheet
of a handbook to the city of Sydney,
which is about to be published by Messrs.
Lee and Ross, printers and publishers, 49
Market-street, Sydney. The book will
form a complete street directory, and one
on a very clear and concise principle, the
streets being shown in diagram on the
pages, with the several places of business
all marked clearly along the sides with
their respective numbers, so that each
locality can be “spotted” at a glance.
The compiler, Mr. G, R. Addison, gives
in addition a short but comprehensive
description of the various places of in-
terest. This Handbook, appearing at
this time, cannot fail to fulfil a most use-
ful purpose, and we think its modest
price, as well as its undoubted excellence
of quality, will cause it to be in great de-
mand as soon as it appears. The direc-
tions given for the benefit of strangers, to
enable them to find their way about the
metropolis, will be a great advantage to
outsiders during the next six months, and
even after that we are sure this Hand-
book, which will be re-issued quarterly,
will be found a necessary adjunct to all
residents in Sydney.—“ Border Post,”

the publishers deserve to meet with en-
couragement for their enterprise.—

questions is obviated, hotels, restaurants,
places of amusement, &c,, being easily
found. The book will be a handy size,
will be revised and issued quarterly, and

apart from its value as a book of reference
for the residents.—“ Riverine Grazier,”

hand page is divided into two columns,
representing the numbered houses on the
two sides of a street, with names of prin-

small space running down the centre, re-
presenting the roadway. We feel assured
the publication will be well patronised.

published by Messrs. Lee and Loss, 49
Market-street, Sydney, and compiled by
Mr. G. R. Addison. There is some
novelty in its arrangement, which con-
sists in giving plans of the streets and
arranging the names of residents and
public buildings on these plans instead of
merely giving a street and alphabetical
directory. This is a decided improve-
ment on the old plan. The Handbook
also contains historical, typographical,
and statistical information, as well as
general directions for the benefit of
strangers.—“ Southern Argus,” Sep. 11,
Publication Received. —We have re-
ceived copy of the following speci-

Handbook to Sydney.— Messrs. Lee
•and Ross, publishers, 49 Market-street,
are about to publish a Handbook and
complete Street Directory, which will be
extremely useful to strangers visiting the
metropolis. The following is an outline
of the contents. (We omit notice in full
for want of space). —Bega Gazette, Sep-
tember 11.
Handbook of Sydney.— We have re-
ceived a few specimen pages of a hand-
book of Sydney, in course of publication
by Messrs. Lee and Ross, of that city. It
has been for many years in contemplation
by -the compiler, Mr. G. R. Addison, and
is intended to supply a want long felt by
strangers of being able to find any part
without the inconvenience of asking
questions; and likewise enabling them,
on knowing the name of the street, to
discover the exact locality they may be
in, and how to reach any other part of
the city. The book contains a complete
street directory, giving the numbers of
each house in the principal streets : the
relative positions of the cross streets are
also shown. Each street has a prefatory
notice, with its length, and some of the
principal buildings therein. The book
will undoubtedly be a great acquisition,
and will supply much information that
probably was unknown to many resi-
dents.—Launceston Examiner, Sept. 13.
Handbook of the City of Sydney.
—We have received from the publishers,
Messrs. Lee and Ross, of the Excelsior
Steam Printing Works, Market-street,
Sydney, some specimen pages of a Hand-
book and Strangers’ Guide to Sydney,
about to be issued by that enterprising
firm. The publication contains a com-
plete street directory, arranged upon an
entirely new, and at the same time very
simple plan, which will enable strangers
visiting our metropolis to find any desired
number, house, or public building with
the least possible difficulty. In order
that new buildings may be added, and
removals and other changes noted, the
publishers purpose issuing the Hand-
book quarterly ; and in due course the
suburbs will be included. Subscribers
may have their names and business in-
serted in the directory and receive a copy
on payment of six shillings per annum.
The Handbook is under the editorship of
Mr. G. R. Addison, the veteran “alman-
acist,” who has evidently spared neither
time nor pains in the compilation of a
work that must prove of especial value
during the International season—a time
when there will be so many ‘ ‘ strangers
within our gates.” — St. Leonard's Re-
corder, 13th October, 1879.

Handbook to Sydney. —We are in
receipt of specimen sheet of the “ Hand-
book to Sydney,” to be shortly published
by Messrs. Lee and Ross. The book
will supply a want very urgently felt by
strangers in Sydney, and will prove of
considerable value to business men.
Mr. G. R. Addison, the compiler of the
work, has for many years contemplated
publishing something of the sort, and
taking into consideration the number of
strangers who will visit Sydney during
the Exhibition, the time chosen for its
publication is most judicious. It will no
doubt meet with a large sale and prove
an excellent advertising medium.—
Macleay Chronicle, September 2bth.
The City of Sydney Handbook.—
Specimen sheet to hand. Just what is
wanted by visitors to the city ; of handy
size, free from dry statistics and brimful
of useful information. The letterpress
is excellent, and highly creditable to the
publishers, Lee and Ross, Market-street.
