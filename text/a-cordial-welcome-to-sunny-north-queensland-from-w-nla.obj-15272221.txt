Cohere is Yungaburra ?
Yungaburra is the recognised centre for all
sightseeing on the Atherton Tableland. Roads to all
beauty spots radiate from this centre. Many business
men make it their temporary headquarters to travel
the Tableland. The distance by rail from Cairns is
75 miles, from Kuranda 54 miles, from Tolga Junc-
tion 10 miles. It is the first township of the Table-
land touched by the Cairns-Yungaburra Range Road,
distance from Cairns being 43 miles. Yungaburra is
in a north-easterly direction from Cairns and approx-
imately 30 miles as the crow flies. (See Locality
Map.) There are two public Tennis Courts and a
9-hole Golf Links quite close to the Hotel, also
several nice walks.
HOW TO GET TO YUNGABURRA.
There are two ways—by rail, via Kuranda and
Tolga Junction, or by the White Car Service direct
from Cairns, over the Cairns-Yungaburra Range
Road, one of Australia’s grandest roads.
Always ask for the White Car Service, careful and
skilled drivers, unfailing courtesy and attention.

Tours
During the Boats Stag in Port.
In the Tourist Season the Melbourne-Cairns
boat is usually met at the Wharf by a special train
for Kuranda. The departure of the boat from
Cairns this season will be not earlier than 6 p.m.
on the third day. In, this space of time visitors can,
by following’ No. 1 and No. 2 Round Tours (as
hereinafter described) see the Barron Range,
Barron Falls, Kuranda, the Maize growing and
Dairying lands of the Tableland, the Corn Silos at
Tolga and Kairi, the milling of Northern Timbers
at Yungaburra, the Crater Lakes of Yungaburra
(Lakes Eacham and Barrine), portion of the great
timber belt, the rich tropical jungle, traverse that
wonderful highway the Yungaburra-Cairns Range
Road, passing through the Sugar Cane growing
districts of Gordonvale and Edmonton, inspecting
the Sugar Mills (when crushing) and spend between
four and five hours in Cairns before departure of
the boat. These Tours are most enjoyable, the times
of arrival and departure are convenient, no early
rising, no late nor hurried meals, the comfort of the
Lake Eacham Hotel, and the efficient service of the
White Car Line all combine to make the Tableland
Tours an outstanding and happy feature of the
visitors’ stay in North Queensland.
No. 1 ROUND TOUR.
FIRST DAY (day of arrival) —Leave Cairns
for Kuranda by special train.
SECOND DAY.—Leave Kuranda for Yunga-
burra by the daily train (about 9 a.m.) changing
into the Rail Motor at Tolga Junction and arrive
Yungaburra for lunch (1 p.m.). In the afternoon
the White Car Service runs trips to Lake Eacham,
visiting the Wishing Pool, Vision Falls, and
)iiiiiiiiiiitiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimtii:iiiii
1111111111 l


111111111111111111111
returning by the Appian Way, where the true jungle
growth of the Tableland is seen to its best
advantage.
THIRD DAY (day of departure).—Leave
Yungaburra for Cairns at 10 a.m. by the White Car
Service, arriving Cairns for lunch.
The approximate cost of these Tours would be:

Motor Car fare to Lake Eacham 7 6
ditto to Cairns 1 0 0
Hotel Tariff (per day) 18 0
In the season when the Sugar Mill at Gordon-
vale is crushing, the White Car Service will arrange
an inspection, providing full car loads can be
obtained. Extra cost of this inspection, including
lunch, would be 5/-. There is ample time to do so
on the 10 a.m. trip and arrive in Cairns in good
time before the departure of the boat.
No. 2 ROUND TOUR.
FIRST DAY (day of arrival). —The White Car
Service meets the boat and leaves for Yungaburra,
via the Yungaburra-Cairns Range Road at 7.30 a.m.

JfTe Yungaburra-Cairns
Range Road'
A GEM IN THE GLORIOUS NORTH.
A TRIP WHICH FOUR THOUSAND SOUTH-
ERNERS MAKE ANNUALLY.
Once any Australian has travelled the road
which ascends the range lying between Gordonvale
and Yungaburra, he no longer pauses to wonder
why from three to four thousand southerners annu-
ally leave their homes on a northern trek in which
the Range Road represents one of the chief portions
of their tour. To the southerner who comes beyond
the Tropic of Capricorn, to live for any time in
these parts, the frequent mention of “the Range
Road” and repeated references to its glories causes
him to delay very little when the opportunity pre-
sents itself for his eyes to witness the views about
which his friends have spoken with such marked
enthusiasm and to judge upon the subject himself.
Gordonvale is the base from which the high-powered
White Car Motor Service attack an ascent of some
2000 feet in 12 miles. The rising grade asks the
engine for more power soon after the gate (through
which traffic is allowed to proceed in one direction
only for stated intervals) disappears behind the
number plate. And then begins a serpentine journey

- which reminds one very much of the trip across the
“ famous Blacks’ Spur of the Dandenong Ranges,
| which Victorians proclaim as one of the chief
| beauties of their State. Clinging to the face of the
| hills, the road winds and winds and winds, and, as
| it does so, there passes before the eyes of the tourist
- a series of kaleidoscopic scenes of unsurpassed
| grandeur. Glorious vistas appear. There are great
| valleys, flanked by hills which proudly rear them-
selves majestically skywards, much as the spires of
| great cathedrals, and capped with clouds, on which
| the early morning sun plays with dazzling brilliance
| and sets up in bold relief all the verdant tropical
| undergrowth and scrub covering the ranges. Water-
| falls abound, their descent to the waterways below
| cutting into the blue line of the thickly timbered
| ranges like long, silver daggers. The streams they
r feed possess all the brilliant colour whicli seems to be
such a marked feature of the whole countryside, and
i the noise of the rushing waters, interrupted now and
| again by the cry of some native bird in the nearby
| scrub breaks pleasantly upon the ear of the traveller
as he revels in the scenic feast before him. In some
| parts, long valleys of cultivation present themselves,
| like a great green sea, and the home of the farmer
| appears like a doll’s house in the view. Then much
r as a magician says, ‘ ‘ Hey, presto! ’ ’ and the guinea-
| pig or whatever his dexterous hands are manipulat-
| ing vanishes, so the valley disappears, to be replaced
| by another scene of an altogether different nature.

to see a view which can be compared with any of
the multitude already seen as being exactly similar.
Away below the valleys stretch and grow and grow,
with the hills, as it were, mounting guard over all
this grandeur. Rearwards, like a great white serpent,
the road stretches to Gordonvale, and other cars,
following miles behind, look but toys. Still the
features of the surrounding countryside continue to
change and the tropical vegetation becomes even
more prolific and charming to tired eyes seeking rest.
Great boulders flit past as though they were mile-
stones. Eventually, but all too soon, the top of the
range is reached, and the car, freed of the burden
of the steep inclines, speeds over a splendid road
through typical dairying country, reminding one of
the famous Northern Rivers district of New South
Wales. And so on to Yungaburra, the centre of happy
jollifications and the Mecca of many a northern
pleasure seeker. A few more miles and the journey
closes. But one more surprise awaits the traveller
at the Lake Eacham Hotel. There are few hostel-
ries of similar size in the Commonwealth so well
equipped as that establishment; but the greatest joy
the guest derives is probably more due to the admir-
able management than any other factor.
One looks back upon the Range Road trip with
pleasure and satisfaction. The tour is an outstand-
ing experience—one of the most notable of life’s
many happy memories.

BRIEF PARTICULARS OF RANGE ROAD.
One way traffic is enforced on this road and is
controlled by Gatekeepers, who take all particulars
and times of cars passing through the gates.
The Top Gate opens from | The Bottom Gate opens from
The speed for all motor traffic is limited to
12 miles per hour under a heavy penalty. The con-
struction of this road was carried out by the Queens-
land Main Roads Commission and cost approximately
£130,000. In the 12 miles of road there is roughly
612 curves. The highest point above sea level is
2,667 feet, and is about one mile distant from the
Top Gate. Patrol men are constantly employed by
the Main Roads Commission. One outstanding feat-
ure noted by the Editor of “The Australia Hand-
book”: “Tribute, and heartfelt tribute at that,
must be rendered to the Main Roads Commission
which has forbidden advertisements of any kind to
mar the splendour of this wonderful highway. No
jarring note is struck by the reading of somebody’s
patent corn cure on some rocky headland or tree
trunk. To the men who comprise this Commission
our grateful thanks for their preservation and
enhancement of the beauties of their glorious
country. ’ ’

JKe Crater Lakes ofYungaburra
“LAKE EACHAM.”
The natural surroundings of Lakes Eacham and
Barrine have been preserved the better to maintain
permanently their uniqueness and beauty.
Lake Eacham is four miles distant from Yunga-
burra, and is reached by a beautiful driving road
which leads at first past well established farms and
picturesque homesteads, and later through primeval
scrub in which hundreds of varieties of birds, large
and small, brilliant and demure, talkative and
musical, have sanctuary.
The lake is almost circular in shape, and is
entirely surrounded by dense scrub timbers and
undergrowth growing to the edge of its abruptly
rising banks. Its surface is aquamarine in colouring,
but its waters are fresh and absolutely pure. They
have been fathomed to a depth of 240 feet, with an
average depth of 220 feet. That they are contained
within a crater is a scientifically accepted fact; that
they have subterranean connection with the waters
of Lake Barrine, which is miles away, is perhaps
mere superstition of the aborigines.
The wild nomadic race which originally roamed
the rich Tableland had a superstitious dread of the
lakes, and of Lake Eacham in particular. Even the
civilised blacks of the present period superstitiously
dread Eacham, and cannot be tempted by the offer

of any reward to enter its waters. Those waters
Z are entirely free of weeds and lily growths. A small
~ species of fish swim in them. They are, in a sense,
I I the waters of a dead lake, but in their perfect fresh-
| ness they are totally unilke dead lakes elsewhere.
Eacham is 130 acres in extent; Barrine, out of
| which flows Barrine Creek, covers a space of 256
acres.
No matter how heavy are the rains, or how
extended the rainy season, Eacham never overflows,
and, indeed, gives little indication of having risen
| above its normal level. But, oddly enough, campers
| there in fine weather have measured a regular daily
| rise and fall of four inches in its surface, and,
| although the freshness of the water remains unim-
| paired, it is suggested that the lake must be in
I some peculiar, unseen way subject to tidal influence.
I A similar rise and fall is noticed in Barrine.
The aspect of both lakes is entirely beautiful,
and the forethought which has preserved intact all
their natural surroundings has assured that their
beauty shall remain. — Queensland Tourist Bureau.

THE VISION FALLS APPIAN WAY.
YUNGABURRA TO LAKE EACHAM.
A writer thus describes these Falls: “A fairy-
like cascade of water falling into a limpid pool
surrounded with exquisite ferns and vegetation,
make a picture of entrancing beauty in the secluded
depths of the jungle.” And again another writer:
“One portion of the drive was named ‘The Appian
Way’ following the visit of The Australian Pro-
vincial Press Association Delegates. One would cer-
tainly have to be dead to every beauty in Nature
not to want to traverse this route again and again.
The Lake and bush country around it are full of
enchantment, and the Vision Falls, to which all
tourists are taken, are unique. The sun never blazes
down on these falls. They lie in the heat of the
jungle, into which only slender rays of sunshine ever
penetrate. ’ ’
ROAD THROUGH FIG TREE
YUNGABURRA TO LAKE EACHAM.
This Fig Tree is on the road to Lake Eacham
and it is an interesting sight to see a number of cars
passing through this tree, the roots of which form
a natural arch.

Lake Barrine was made in the early morning l , and
stands out as one of the special delights of the
Queensland tour. At a quarter to seven we started
out from the hotel on a five-mile motor-spin to the
lake. It was a radiant morning, clear and a trifle
sharp, and the road trailed invitingly up hill and
down, through a lovely stretch of jungle and then
to the lake itself. Lake Barrine is an exquisite
| stretch of water at all times, but at seven in the |
morning it held a beauty incomparable. Like Lake |
| Eacham, its waters are clear, deep, and still, and |
| this morning the lake resembled an expanse of |
| mother-of-pearl ringed with jade. We entered a |
| launch and gently skimmed its pearl-like surface |
close to the shore round the entire compass of the |
| Lake. The surrounding jungle was glorious |
| with its foliage still bespangled with the |
| glittering dew of night. Faint clouds of |
gossamer—morning mists—rose from the mir- |
| rored surface of the lake, drawn by the warm, |
| caressing rays of the mounting sun. Our boat at |
| times took us right underneath the overhanging |
| boughs of giant fig trees. There were Eugenia trees |
| with their bright red clusters of leaves, and numer- |
| ous umbrella trees; tall black pines, maple, and silk- |
| wood trees mingled with a tangle of smaller shrubs. |
| Wild mangosteens grew close to the water’s edge, |

| in wondrous profusion. The creeping liana vine, the
| same as that found in the South American jungles,
= trails where it wills. Wild duck skim the lake’s
surface, brown pigeons flew in the woods which
echoed repeatedly with the fluted notes of birds.
| The lake is a sanctuary for both fauna and flora.
| For three miles we encircled that expanse of loveli-
| ness, piloted by a guide who knew and loved every
| bit of Nature’s prodigal beauty. As the sun rose
| higher the lake assumed deeper hues of blue and
| green, and the writer has happy memories of a delic-
| ious plunge and a brief swim in its pellucid depths.
| The lake is ideal for swimming, the water being

I by crocodiles, but there are none either in Lake

I of Kauri Pine grows close to the borders of the
| lake, with a girth of some 27! feet and 70 clear feet
of straight trunk to the first limb. There are also
| other fine examples growing round the lake.”

who ascend it a most magnificent view of the Table-
land. After picking out the various townships,
mountains and ranges, the visitor walks a few feet
further on and is spellbound to see in the centre of
this mountain a circular shaped crater, approxi-
mately 10 acres in extent, 500 feet below, sloping
gradually away from the top of the mountain. Vege-
tation of all kinds meet the eye down the slope.
At the bottom reeds grow in profusion, thus confirm-
ing the general opinion that it is a huge swamp. To
reach the mountain, visitors can take a car or walk
the three miles along the Yungaburra-Atherton Main
Road. This road alone, winding as it does through
the jungle, is admitted to be, from a scenic point of
view, one of the best of its kind in North Queens-
land. Leaving the Main Road a detour is made
through Pulver’s Tropical Plantation, which is on
the ascent to the mountain. After passing through
the Plantation a track of easy gradient follows the
main spur of the mountain for a distance of a”mile
to the top.

stream of crystal water, in the background of which
rose a giant Fig Tree—the octopus of the forest.
When I saw this tree I almost overlooked the beauty
of the stream. I had heard it was called the Cathe-
dral Fig, but from the outside there was nothing
suggestive of cathedral architecture about it. Climb-
ing down through a small opening in one side, I
found myself in an immense chamber at least 12 feet
in diameter, and almost circular, in which I saw
much reminiscent of a cathedral. This type of fig
tree preys on giants of the forest. Quite a small
plant at first, it sends its roots down along the bark
of the giants until they obtain a firm hold in the
ground. Then it thrives, with ever-increasing rapid-
ity, gradually enfolding its victim in tentacles of
ever-increasing size until death and then rot ensues.
The rotting tree ultimately disappears entirely, leav-
ing the fig triumphant—a solid wall of root-like
limbs remaining like a gigantic framework around
the cavity where its victim once flourished. I esti-
mated the height of the ‘ ‘ cathedral ’ ’ at about 35 or
40 feet, while the branches above probably extended
another 25 feet upwards.”
There is a much shorter route to this Crossing
through the prettily situated Golf Links. All visitors
enjoy this walk.

Dairvinji, and Agriculture
on the Tableland ~
Yungaburra, so well known as a Tourist Resort,
| is at the same time the centre of a splendid tract of
| agricultural and dairying lands. Dairying is the
| principal industry for which the country is so highly
| adapted owing to the richness of the soil, its altitude,
which gives it an equitable climate and sure rainfall,
| which for a period of years averages 51 inches. The
| principal crop grown is maize, but lucerne, cow pea,
| sugar and cow cane, wheat, barley, oats and sorghum
| and practically all other agricultural products can be
| grown to advantage. The pastures are composed of
| Paspalum, Rhodes’ Grass, Couch, Kikuga, Panicum
| and sundry local grasses. The cattle are principally
= Illawarras, whilst there are some fine herds of Jer-
| seys, Fresians and Ayrshires. The pasture will easily
| carry a beast to two acres the year round without
| hand-feeding. The country is well watered with
| springs and running creeks, scarcely a farm being
| without a permanent water supply. There are four
| Butter Factories operating, three Co-operative and
| one Proprietary. The output of the principal Co-
il operative Factory (which is also the pioneer
| factory) is as follows:
Commencing 1914, 239 tons of butter manu-
| factured. Turnover, £29,152. 1929, 1052 tons of
| butter manufactured. Turnover, £209,532.

Average amount paid suppliers for 12 months
ended 30th June, 1929, £406/9/8.
This industry is only in its infancy as far as
production is concerned. With hand feeding the
present herds can be brought to a higher state of
production and at the same time there are
thousands of acres of land not yet producing.
MAIZE GROWING.
Maize is the principal crop grown on the
Tableland and is confined to the country
around Atherton, Tolga, Kairi and Yungaburra.
The average yield is about 60 bushels to the acre
although returns have been received of 120 bushels.
A Maize Pool is in operation which markets and
treats the maize in Silos at Atherton, Tolga and
Kairi. The latest official figures showing the increase
in acreage and crops harvested on the Tableland
are:—Year 1923, 10,411 acres, 447,294 bushels: 1928,
21,408 acres, 901,624 bushels.
PIG RAISING.
Pig raising on the Tableland has increased
considerably in the past five years and is controlled
by the Northern Pig Board. Their operations for
the year ending June, 1929, were 11,248 pigs and
186 vealers handled, of which 9.594 pigs and
186 vealers were sold to the North Queensland Co-
operative Bacon Association Ltd., and the balance
sold alive to butchers. The average price paid for

to Atherton in 1903: to Yungaburra in 1910. The
Yungaburra Cairns Range Road was opened in 1926.
Timber plays an important part in the com-
mercial life of the Tableland and creates a large
amount of employment. The principal marketable
timbers are:—Ballygum, Beantree, Beech (white),
Blue Gum, Caloon or Quandong, Crow’s Ash, Crow-
foot Elm, Johnstone River Hardwood, Kauri Pine,
Oak, (Silkly and Bull), Red Cedar, Pencil Cedar,
White Cedar, Penda, Maple, Spurwood, Walnut and
Water Gum. There are also many valuable forest
timbers, which are used for wharf construction,
bridges, etc. Scrub timbers as a rule will not last
in the water or the ground. There is a large export
trade in log timber from Cairns. Despite this fact
Sawmills throughout Cairns and the Tableland are
kept fully occupied in cutting local and export
orders. The number of Sawmills operating are as
follows:
One at Cairns, Stratford, Mount Molloy, Tolga,
Kairi, Yungaburra, Malanda, Tarzali, Millaa Millaa,
Tumoulin, Ravenshoe and two at Mareeba. There are
also several smaller mills cutting railway sleepers,
etc.
