PREFACE.
This account of the beet sugar industry in Victoria is a slightly
enlarged edition of a paper read by me before the Victorian
Society of Chemical Industry, on 24th September, 1901. It is
not an exhaustive account, but is sufficient for present purposes.
There is, however, one other important fact which it may be well
to mention here. It has been said that, during the two campaigns
of the Maffra factory, the roots left in the ground until after the
autumn rains deteriorated considerably and became unsuitable for
sugar extraction. I have been through the laboratory books at
the factory, and find that the roots deteriorated in one respect,
namely, in the per cent, of sugar, which decreased considerably
after the rains set in ; but in another respect they improved, for
the purity was higher in both campaigns after the rains than
before, the average purity in the second half of the campaign,
being higher each year than in the first half of the campaign
The fact is the roots at first were inordinately dry, and the effect
of the rain was that they absorbed moisture, and the sap became
diluted. In other respects the roots were improved.
I earnestly recommend the beet sugar industry to the public of
Victoria as one specially suited to the natural conditions of certain
parts of the State.

THE BEET SUGAR INDUSTRY IN
VICTORIA.
The beet sugar industry of the world was started as a move-
ment hostile to England, and consequently there has always been
a certain vein of prejudice in British opinion about it. Napoleon
Bonaparte having closed European ports to British trade, and
thereby cut off the sugar supply, took advantage of Margraf’s
discovery and Achard’s experiments, to supply Europe with
sugar from beet. His measures were so vigorous that by the year
1813 there were no less than 334 beet factories in France, each
having an annual average capacity of tons of sugar. After
Napoleon’s overthrow the young industry almost died out; but its
merits were such as to insure its survival. By the year 1830 it
was firmly established, and since 1840 it has, under the stimulus
of bounties, grown with rapid strides, so that now it furnishes
two-thirds of the world’s visible sugar supply, and controls the
sugar market. The enormous development of the beet sugar
industry during recent years is shown by the following figures :
From the above figures it will be seen that beet sugar has-
become the one great factor in the sugar industry of the world.
In the early days sugar-cane was cultivated with slave labour ;
and with cheap labour, and with high-priced sugar, a cane
plantation, notwithstanding ignorant and wasteful methods, was
a highly profitable investment. But since the abolition of
slavery, and especially since the tremendous fall in prices conse-
quent on the competition of bounty-fed beet sugar, the conditions
have changed to such an extent that in some of the sugar-cane
countries it has within recent years become a question as to
whether or not the cane industry can survive without some form
of assistance, fiscal or otherwise. The beet industry was con-
ducted with the aid of science from the outset, and the know-
ledge acquired thereby has within recent years been applied to
the sugar-cane industry with manifest advantage. But no
amount of science has yet been able to overcome the labour diffi-
culty. The sugar-cane is naturally grown by coloured races;
but the beet industry is, and has been from the outset, a white
man’s business. The beet sugar question of Europe is no longer
one between Napoleon and the English, it is between the white


man and the coloured man. Shall the white man grow his own
sugar in his own country, or shall he obtain it by exchange from
tropic or semi-tropic regions ?
In the end, he will probably do that which is most profitable ;
or rather, one would say, which is most to his advantage, for
many things go to make up the sum total of advantage which
cannot be set down in a balance-sheet as £, s., and d. It is an
advantage, for instance, for a country to have a dense population,
and it is an advantage for that population to have variety of oc-
cupation. We may suspect there are more reasons than one why
European nations tax themselves in order to foster the beet in-
dustry. One of these reasons appears to be that the beet in-
dustry effects an all-round improvement in the agriculture of the
district in which it is successfully conducted.
In Consular Report No. 452, of 1898, there is a survey of agri-
culture in Germany by Mr. F. Ph. Koenig. After a glowing
account of agriculture in Saxony, Mr. Koenig -writes :
“ And now we come to the question as to what is the origin of
all the successful high-class farming in Saxony ? The answer
is that for the last 50 years or more Saxony has grown to be the
finest agricultural province of Germany, and to serve as a model
for the world, under the influence of sugar beet-root cultivation.”
And again, “ The effect of growing sugar beet-root and the
cultivation necessary for securing a good crop has been of the
utmost value to the soil. The land has almost doubled in value
* * * The cultivation of sugar beef in Germany has
made many a man’s farm pay which previously was only kept
afloat with difficulty. A good crop of sugar-beet means three
or four consecutive good crops of anything you like to grow
* * * Whereas formerly yields per acre varied largely ;
wherever sugar-beet has been successfully cultivated it has been
found that yields (of other crops) are less variable and increase
largely. This is due to the deep cultivation of the soil and
the incessant hoeing necessary to produce that crop.”
Mr. Koeing’s whole report is written in a somewhat optimistic
tone ; and it is not necessary to accept everything one reads
without question, even though it appear in a consular report.
But from our own experience here we know that regularly good
beet crops cannot be obtained unless the soil be thoroughly well
cultivated and kept free from weeds. A soil so cultivated must
necessarily produce better crops of all kinds. If the growth of
beet-root result in increasing other crops by 50 per cent, then it
is easy to see that it may be profitable to grow the beet-root crop
itself even without profit for the sake of the increased profit
obtained on the other crops. I shall endeavour presently, how-
ever, to show that we can here grow the beet crops themselves
at a good profit altogether apart from the incidental advantages
winch follow.


Beet-root growing in Victoria is no new thing. The Victorian
beet sugar question is 35 years old. The movement in favour
of introducing the industry began in 1866. It may be thought
we have been a long time in bringing 'the matter to a success.
But that is nothing. In the United States of America it took
them 64 years to bring it to a success. The fact is the industry
is not well adapted to the conditions of a newly-settled country ;
it requires a certain degree of agricultural development for
success.
The first effort in Victoria was in 1866, when a factory was
started at Saltwater River for distilling spirit from beet-root,
and articles appeared in the Melbourne press in favour of estab-
lishing the beet sugar industry. The factory was under the
direction of Mr. Nathaniel Levi, now a member of the local
Legislative Council. The Company imported seed from Europe,
which was distributed amongst farmers. The company them-
selves grew beet-root on 40 acres, which produced 15 tons an
acre one season, and 25 tons the next. At the Model Farm,
Royal Park, it is stated that 40 tons an acre were obtained with
perfect cultivation. In 1870 Mr. Levi obtained letters-patent for
the manufacture of sugar from beet-root in Victoria, and in the
same year published a book on the subject, containing a lot of
matter which we often see put forward to-day as new. In 1873
an old wool-shed at Anakies, near Geelong, was converted into a
beet sugar factory, but the machinery arrived late from Europe,
and was not completed till long after the beet crops were harvested.
The beets were stacked in the open, cattle had access to them,
and, although some sugar was produced, the undertaking was
necessarily a failure. The plant was subsequently purchased by
Mr. J. Murray Ross, who built a mill for its accommodation at
Rosstown, and constructed a railway to bring beet from the
neighbouring market gardeners and more distant farmers. But
neither the market gardeners nor the farmers could be induced to
grow the beet-root, and the dismantled mill and railway stand to-
day as a land-mark in the history of the beet sugar movement in
Victoria. People sometimes point to that mill with a sneer.
But there is really nothing in it to be ashamed of. One has
only to look up the history of beet sugar in the United States
to learn that there have been there not one but several such
abortive attempts before success was attained.
In 1887, soon after my arrival in this country, I gave attention
to the growing of beet-root, considering it eminently desirable to
introduce into the agricultural system of the country a crop so
valuable in many ways. Mr. G. W. Robinson undertook to
manage some experimental plots at Narre Warren. Ten plots
¥ ’jyth acre each were laid out, manured in various ways, and
sown with seed which the Department of Agriculture had

imported two or three years previously for distribution. Beet
crops were grown on these plots four years in succession. Only
the first year was good seed used; the other years we had to be
content with seed bought in the Melbourne market. The
experiment was particularly interesting, because conducted in a
naturally very poor soil.
The following were the results obtained;—
The medium dressing of manure per acre consisted of—2 cwt. nitrate
of soda, 4 cwt. superphosphate, 200 lbs. potash chloride, and 200 lbs.
gypsum.
The light dressing was half as much, and the heavy dressing one
and a half as much as the medium dressing.

Calculating from the above figures the amount of total sugar
per acre, we get the following results :
The first year the average yield on the unmanured plots was
4'06 tons per acre, the second year it was only 1 ton, and the third
year ton. But with manure there were crops of 15, 16, and 17
tons per acre in the first year ; the second year was unfavorable,
but the manured plots gave an average of 9 tons, w r hich was equal
to the average of Europe in some years ; and in the third year all
the manured plots, except the plot without phosphoric acid, gave
heavier yields than the first year, the highest being 19 tons. The
fourth year Mr. Robinson removed from Narre Warren before the
crops were harvested, and they could not be weighed. Analyses
in the second and third years were carried out on the small,
medium, and large-sized roots. The second year the medium-sized
roots averaged 13'41 per cent, sugar, and the third year 12’24.
The crop on plot 10 in the third year contained sugar at the rate
of 2J tons per acre. A difficulty was found at the outset in
determining when the crops should be harvested, as owing to the
mild winters in this country, no distinct change could be noticed
in them. In 1891, periodical analyses were made to determine
the time of maximum richness, with the following results :
The month of August, if will be seen, especially the middle of-
that month, gave the maximum per cent.
In 1892 I showed these results to Mr. Eastick, an old fellow-
student of mine, who was manager of the Australasian Sugar
Refinery, at Port Melbourne. Mr. Eastick brought them before
the Chamber of Manufactures, with the result that the beet
sugar question was again revived.
In 1893 experiments were commenced on the late Mr John
Goldie’s farm, at Port Fairy, also at Riddell’s Creek and Chil-
ders. In all 112 analyses were made of roots from these plots.
The following table shows one set of analyses of the Port Fairy
roots, and also the yields per acre on the 30th June, 1894 :

The results, it will be seen, were in many respects better than
those obtained at Narre Warren. Three kinds of roots were
grown, namely, Yilmorin’s Improved and Heine’s Vilmorin, from
small lots of seed given to me by Mr. Eastick, and for the bulk
of the plots ordinary Melbourne seed. The sugar in the ordi-
nary roots was not much higher than that obtained in 1889 with
the same kind of seed at Narre Warren, the Port Fairy being
13'86 per cent., and Narre Warren 13'28 per cent., but the yield
per acre was 50 per cent, higher, namely, 13’8 instead of 9 - 0
tons. The Port Fairy yield was very good under the circum-
stances, for the seed was sown late and it was a dry season, there
having been scarcely any rain for six weeks after the seed was
sown.
The results showed many interesting facts. They showed in
a striking manner the importance of improved seed. The Vil-
morin’s Improved gave 1-57 per cent, more sugar, and the Heine’s
Vilmorin 2'28 per cent, more than the ordinary Melbourne seed.
They showed also in a remarkable degree the effect of different
kinds of manuring on the per cent, of sugar. Thus ; —■
The phosphoric acid and potash only caused an increase in
the sugar contents as compared with no manure, but when
nitrogen was added, there was a decrease, as compared with no
manure, there being a difference of over 2 per cent, in the sugar
contents caused by a difference in manuring.
One of the most important facts brought out by these experi-
ments was that the roots could be kept in the ground for a long
period without deterioration. The roots were tested at intervals
from the 6th May to the 22nd June, that is over a period of
seven weeks, and in no case showed any serious change. This
will be seen in the results of Yilmorin’s improved, shown in the
table. But the fact was shown in a more striking manner in
the case of some ordinary roots, left in the ground till the 26th
September. In May the roots of that plot had contained 14 per
cent, sugar, and the roots, gathered on the 26th September, four
and a half months later, contained 14'2 per cent. That was a
fact of considerable practical significance.
In Europe the roots have to be harvested in October, before
the winter frosts set in, and stored in silos. They have there a
very short harvesting period. If the harvesting is commenced
too soon, the crop contains less sugar ; if the crop be left in the

ground too late, the storing quality of the roots is damaged by
frost. And in any case, it is found that the roots suffer somewhat
in the storing. Hence, not only is the harvesting season limited,
but also the working season at the factories is made as short as
possible, namely, from three to three and a half months. Here in
Victoria, with a fact such as that brought out by the Port Fairy
experiments, the cost of storing in silos and of double handling
would be saved, and the working season of the factories could be
prolonged to five or six months, thus enabling the factories to earn
interest on the capital outlay for a longer period. That would be
one distinct advantage presented by the Victorian climate.
Well, then, there was another encouraging fact brought out by
these experiments ; the yield of sugar per acre was very high,
notwithstanding the dry season. The average yield of all the
plots, taking good and bad together, and reckoning on the
percentage of the ordinary roots only, was T9l tons sugar per
acre; plot 6 contained 2TI tons of sugar per acre, and plot 1,
2'61 tons. If the whole field had been planted with Heine’s
roots, and had given the same weight of crop, it would have
contained 2’37 tons sugar per acre. Now the question arose as to
how these figures compared with the results obtained in Europe,
the home of the beet sugar industry. An examination of Euro-
pean statistics gave the following results :
The Port Fairy results you will see were in every respect
superior. They seemed to indicate that we had a climate here
unusually favorable for beet sugar production, a climate which
would, under proper conditions of practice, enable us to
obtain about twice as much sugar to the acre as was being
obtained on the average in Europe, and also enable us to nearly
double the length of our working season.
I have here quoted European statistics, and will refer
to this question of statistics again presently ; but before
doing so will explain the meaning of two terms used in
this table of the Port Fairy results. Under the line of
averages are given figures showing the purity and saline
co-efficiout of the roots. If beet-root contained no soluble
matters other than sugar the extraction of the sugar would be a
comparatively simple matter ; but there are many other soluble
substances, both organic and inorganic. Some of these can be
precipitated from the juice, and separated by filtration. The

precipitates carry away a portion of the sugar mechanically.
Other substances cannot be precipitated from the Juice, they
remain in solution together with the sugar ; and several of them
exert an important influence on the sugar. They are divisible
into three classes, namely, those which prevent the cr}-stallization
of sugar, those which are indifferent, and those which favour it.
Those which prevent the crystallization are called melassigens,
or molasses producers ; and the more of these that are present
the greater will be the proportion of molasses and the less the
proportion of crystallized sugar obtained in the process of manu-
facture. According to the investigations of Marschall, the fol-
lowing substances are in these groups :
It would not be practicable in manufacturing work to
determine the quantity of all these different substances con-
tained in the roots, and thus to estimate accurately their effect
in causing losses of sugar in the process of manufacture. A
rough and ready method is therefore adopted. The total dis-
solved matters, including the sugar, contained in the juice is
determined, and the percentage proportion of the sugar to the
whole is calculated, and this proportion is called the purity.
Thus—
The 80 and 85 per cent, in the bottom of the above figures would
be what is called the purity. It is roughly assumed that the sugar-
producing value of the roots varies in direct proportion to the
degree of purity. The purity should not fall below 80°. The
average purity of the Port Fairy roots varied from 82-4 to 83-8,
and was therefore good.

In France, according to Gallois and Dupont’s Note-Book for
Sugar Manufactures , special stress is placed on the saline im-
purities. It is assumed that every per cent, of saline matter
prevents 3| per cent, of sugar from crystallizing. The amount
of ash obtained in the analysis of the juice is divided into the per
cent, of sugar in the juice, and the quotient is called the saline
co-efficient. Thus, if there were 12 per cent, sugar and - 6 per
cent, ash, - 6 divided into 12 goes 20 times, 20 would thus be the
saline co-efficient. The higher the saline co-efficient the better
are the roots. I do not know what is the average saline
co-efficient of European roots, because such information is not
published. Some Austrian figures of 1892 show that the roots
of one factory contained 13 per cent, sugar and - 7 per cent, ash ;
the saline co-efficient would therefore be 18’5. Gallois and
Dupont place their scale of saline co-efficients from 10 to 25.
Evidently then 25 is regarded as a working maximum. Now, it
will be seen that the saline co-efficients of the Port Fairy roots
were very high—2B for the ordinary roots, and 38 - 2 and 39 for
the better quality roots.
The Riddell’s Creek and Childers experiments were less
successful so far as weight of crop was concerned. But the roots
had a high richness and purity. On the average they contained
as follows ;
The small amount of saline matter in the Riddell’s Creek roots
was remarkable.
Besides these official experiments, several farmers in various
parts of the country grew beet-root in their own way, and sent
samples for analysis. But the samples generally could not be
considered representative. As a rule, they sent large roots
weighing between 2 and 4 lbs., no doubt thinking the small roots
unfit to send, not uuderstanding that the small roots are the more
valuable. The average of the analysis of 30 of these samples gave
the following results :

The weight of these crops was not known, but several farmers
stated they obtained 20 and 30 tons per acre. The saline
co-efficient, it will be noticed, was low. Several samples were
received from the Maffra district, and these gave the average
results shown above. The general purity it will be seen was
good, but the saline co-efficient was very low, a significant fact
which should have received recognition when determining upon
the erection of a factory in this district. Some of the samples
contained over 1 per cent, of ash.
The Port Fairy results were very good. Every one admitted
that. But'the next step was to see if such results could be
obtained on a larger scale. I therefore arranged for the growth
the following season of 27 acres of beet-root —8 at Port Fairy,
5 at Bacchus Marsh, 8 at Lilydale, and 6 at Boulgar Park, near
Maffra. The crop at Port Fairy averaged tons of dressed
roots per acre, and o t tons tops and collars. The average of the
analyses of the crop gave the following results: —
This crop contained tons of sugar to the acre. The crop at
Bacchus Marsh was almost identical in quantity and quality, the
saline co-efficient being lower. I have not at hand the details of
the Lilydale and Boulgar Park crops. To the best of my recollec-
tion they amounted to 18 tons per acre, -with 13£ per cent, sugar,
containing therefore about 2\ tons of sugar per acre.
From these large experiments it was possible to determine the
actual cost of growing the crops. Mr. Goldie’s actual expendi-
ture at Port Fairy was as follows :

The manure was a heavy item. Subsequent experience has
shown that 15s. would he an ample outlay on manure. The cost
may, therefore, be reduced by £1 135., making it £9 ss. 3d. per
acre. Now what would be the value of such a crop ? In
Germany the average price paid the previous year for roots of
less richness was 19s. 9d. per ton. At such a price this crop
would have been worth £2l 4s. 7d. an acre, without the value of
the tops and collars, which as fodder would be worth os. a ton ;
and without valuing the improvement of the ground. Even if
sold at only 13s. the crop would have been a very profitable
one, thus :
These experiments indicated that the effect of the Victorian
climate in certain districts was such as to make it possible for a
factory to buy roots at a less price than they had . pay in
Europe. That was the second advantage of our climate. It
was an advantage superior to the bounties of Europe.
Now we have been comparing these results with those obtained
in Europe according to published statistics. My use of statistics
has been publicly called in question. It has been said that my
statement of the average amount of sugar contained in the beet
crops of Europe was incorrect, and should be increased by 50
per cent. That criticism, however, was based evidently on a
misunderstanding of the character of the sugar statistics of
Europe. There are no statistics showing the average per cent,
of sugar contained in the roots according to analysis. All that
we have given to us is the number of acres in crop, the number
of tons of roots harvested, and the number of tons of sugar
obtained in the manufacture. If we divide the number of acres
in crop into the number of tons of sugar produced, we shall get
the amount of sugar obtained by manufacture from an acre on
the average. Thus, if there were 3,000,000 acres in crop, and
4,000,000
4,000,000 tons sugar produced, then ~ qqq"qqq' gives us T 33 tons
sugar per acre. But the figure thus obtained would give no account
of the loss in manufacture. If the statistics gave simply the amount
of refined sugar produced fit for the table, which is about

two-thirds of the original amount in the raw material, we should
have to increase our figure by 50 per cent, to get a true estimate
of the amount per acre of sugar originally contained in the roots.
Our 1'33 tons would become 2’oo tons per acre. But,
as a matter of fact, the sugar statistics are of such a
character that they give almost exactly the amount of sugar
originally contained in the roots. They do not refer, as might
be supposed, to the refined sugar ready for consumption. They
refer to the total sugar obtained in all forms, including that which
remains in the molasses, and the Germans express the whole in
terms of raw sugar of 88 degrees, that is to say, sugar which on
refining would produce 88 per cent, pure sugar ; while the French
express them in terms of pure sugar. If the French figures are
increased by one-ninth, they correspond pretty closely with the
German figures.
In the actual process of manufacture the following may be
taken as an illustration of the various losses and products ob-
tained. I take the illustration from Gallois and Dupont’s Hand-
book. Assuming the roots to contain 11*34 per cent, sugar and
71 per cent, ash, the course of products would be :
Out of the original 11 - 34 per cent, sugar in the roots 8'36
would be obtained in various forms of crystals, and 2TB would
be in molasses. The total sugar obtained would be 10 - o4 of
pure sugar, but it would not be in the form of pure sugar. We
have to calculate it all into terms of 88° raw sugar. 88° raw
sugar contains about 93 per cent, pure sugar. The 8'36 per

cent, of sugar in crystals then would form 9 - 00 of 88° raw
sugar, supposing it to be all in that form ; and 2-18 of sugar in
the molasses would form 2-34 parts of 88° raw sugar. Hence,
the whole sugar obtained, if reckoned as 88° raw sugar, would
be :
The total 1T34 is very nearly the same as the original 1T54
contained in the roots. Hence the published statistics of the
sugar obtained in manufacture correspond very closely to the
sugar originally contained in the roots. 8'36 sugar obtained in
the form of raw sugar would not produce 8 - 86 if refined, but
only about 7 - 60, which would be 66 per cent., or two-thirds of
the original sugar contained in the roots. Hence the statement
made by my critic that only about two-thirds of the sugar was
obtainable by manufacture was correct, so far as it referred to
refined sugar ready for the table, and not including sugar which
may afterwards be extracted from the molasses. But you will
see also from the above demonstration that my use of the
statistics was correct.
The average produce of sugar per acre in Germany was
in—
According to a valuable paper, read by Mr. Martineau before
the Royal Statistical Society, and lent to me by Mr. Fenton, the
following was the production per acre in various sugar-
producing countries, from both cane and beet, in 1897-8 :
The picked spots of the world for sugar production are
evidently Java and Hawaii. If in Victoria we could in practice
get results like those obtained at Fort Fairy in 1895, Victoria


would be another of the picked spots of the world. Of course, in
Europe there are individual crops which yield much better than
the average ; and I have heard of experimental plots in Europe
yielding as much as tons of sugar per acre. Recent experi-
ments in the British Isles have seemed to indicate that parts of
Ireland and southern and midland England are more favorable
for sugar production than the continent of Europe. But I have
not heard of 8-acre and 5-acre crops like those at Port Fairy and
Bacchus Marsh, grown by farmers who had not cultivated
beet-root before, yielding crops containing tons of sugar per
acre.
In 1894 and 1895 the beet sugar question in Victoria was
thoroughly alive ; and those interested in it were divided into
two camps. One party advised that we should go slow in the
matter, educate the farmers in the growing of beet-root for sugar,
by means of prizes and so on, and thoroughly test the different
parts of the country, in order to determine the best locality for
starting the industry. The other party urged that farmers would
not trouble much about the matter unless there were a visible
outlet for their produce, and advised the putting up of a big
factory at once, arguing that if the country were once com-
mitted by a heavy expenditure it would be obliged to see the
matter through. Two gentlemen were identified with these
views. Mr. Van de Velde urged the more cautious policy ; Mr.
Salatnay went for immediate outlay. There were good reasons
on both sides. My sympathies were with the more cautious
view ; and my action at the time, although it was caustically
criticised by both parties, was really in the direction of a slow
nd sure policy. ■
My action was, briefly, as follows : —lt having been demonstrated that
certain districts of Victoria were specially favorable to sugar-beet grow-
ing, some farmers asked if they could not begin work on a small scale,
instead of having only one or two large factories, which could serve only
limited districts. I said, No. But, being pressed to reconsider the matter,
I consulted with Mr. Eastiok, manager of the Australasian Sugar Refinery ;
and, as a result of the consultation, prepared a sample of evaporated beet
juice, which was submitted to Mr. Eastick, who stated his company
would be prepared to buy 24,000 tons annually of such material, valuing
it on the same basis as raw sugar. Valued in this way such material would
have varied in price from £7 to £l3 per ton. He stated his company
would be prepared to spend £5,000 in providing additional plant for treat-
ing such material. Such a transaction under ordinary circumstances would
have been impossible. But the circumstances w’ere not ordinary. There
was a large refinery only partially employed ; there w'as a protective duty
of £6 per ton on refined sugar ; there was a Government bonus of £2 an
acre for every acre of beet-root grown for sugar production ; and there was
a bonus of £5 a ton for every ton of sugar produced, up to £SOO ; and in
addition there was the favorable climate which had been shown in certain
districts to readily admit of unusually large yields of sugar per acre.

Assuming a small factory to extract only 70 per cent, of juice from the
roots, and to evaporate this down to one-fifth, and that the juice were
valued at £8 per ton, then a farmer growing 20 tons of roots would have
obtained the following returns :
I advised, therefore, that an experimental plant should be produced to
test the practicability of the scheme. An experimental plant was designed,
consisting essentially of a Champonnois rasper, a hydraulic press, and an
evaporator. The evaporator I specially invented for the purpose. It con-
sisted of two hollow cylinders, each 5 feet in diameter, revolving on
horizontal axes, and heated internally by steam. The juice was taken up
as a thin layer on the exterior of these cylinders on the one side, and
removed in an evaporated state by scrapers on the other side. In the trial
it was found that from 75 to 85 per cent, of juice was extracted from the
roots, and samples of the evaporated juice were analyzed in the Govern-
ment Agricultural Laboratory, also by Mr. Steel, chemist in Sydney to the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co., and also by the chemist of the Maft'ra Beet
Sugar Co., the last-named having analyzed the material after three years’
storage in the open air. The following were the results obtained in each
case :
The scheme was strenuously opposed by both parties then interested in
the beet sugar question on the grounds that small factories had been
found unprofitable in Europe ; that such material could not be worked up

at a refinery; that the hydraulic press would not in practice yield more than
60 per cent, of juice ; and that the sugar in the juice would be nearly all
destroyed in the evaporating. The first objection was irrelevant, as the
circumstances here were quite different from those in Europe ; the second
had been already met by the intention of the Australasian Sugar Refinery
Co. to provide additional plant for the purpose ; the third and fourth were
completely answered by the results of the trial. Had the scheme been
practically applied it would have enabled farmers in various localities to
work in a small way, and thus acquire a practical knowledge in beet-
growing for sugar, and it would have resulted in the thorough testing of
the different districts of the country in order to determine the best locality
for commencing the industry on a large scale. The scheme fell through,
however, owing to the amalgamation of the two sugar refining companies,
after which the offer to purchase the dried juice was withdrawn.
Those who advocated putting up a large factory at once gained
the day; and the Maffra district, not through any special fitness, but
through being favoured by having an energetic leader, succeeded in
arranging for the first factory. A. splendid factory was put up,
although imperfect in one respect, namely, that no provision was
made in if for extracting sugar from molasses. As the analysis
of beet-roots grown in the district had shown that they contained
a high average of saline matter, and might therefore he expected
to yield an unusual amount of molasses, this was an important
omission, and seriously affected the fortunes of the factory.
The views here given of the factory will sufficiently indicate
that everything was good of its kind. A detailed description at
present is unnecessary, since everything at this juncture hinges
on the field work. Given profitable crops in the field, and an
abundant supply of roots, and the factory work can be managed
well enough. A few years may be needed for studying the
idiosyncracies of the locally-grown roots, and for getting the
factory hands into thorough training, but these are matters of
detail which will soon right themselves.
There was everything in the factory to insure a reasonable
measure of success had there been a full supply of roots ; but
the whole thing fell through for want of raw material. The
factory had a capacity of 400 tons of roots a day. To keep it
going at only half its capacity for 100 days would have required
20,000 tons of toots. It is not an easy thing under any circum-
stances to grow straight aw 7 ay 20,000 tons of roots. To do this
with growers who are not in thorough training to the work
is a very difficult undertaking at any time ; to undertake it
with such growers in a district liable to severe droughts is to
run grave risks. It was most unfortunate, not only for Maffra,
but for all districts of Australia interested in this beet sugar
question, that at the start of the Maffra factory the district should
be visited by two of the worst seasons it had known. Had the
ground been as well prepared as it should have been, and at the

proper time, namely, in the autumn, and had the seed been sown
early enough, there would have been good crops, notwithstanding
the had seasons. But, unfortunately, this was not the case.
The first year 1,554 acres were put in, but only 1,287 were
harvested, and these yielded 9,109 tons of roots, being at the rate
of 7'oß tons to the acre. The second year was worse than the first.
1,789 acres were put in, of which only 1,509 were harvested, and
these yielded 6,271 tons, or only 4T5 tons per acre. The effect
was disastrous, of course. The factory had to he shut up, the
G-overnment, which had advanced £62,000 towards the under-
taking, foreclosed. For a time the beet industry and every one
who had taken part in it was discredited. No one, except a few
who saw beneath the surface of things, would believe in it. The
failure was really due to bad crops. Yet even during these bad
seasons two or three good crops had been grown. It was not on
account of specially good soil that they were good, for the soils
are fairly uniform throughout the district. They were good
because of the method of growing them; and it was evident that
if all the crops had been grown in the same way there would
have been good crops throughout the district, and the industry
would have been successfully started.
It remained then to convince the public that good crops could
be grown at Maffra. Mr. Van de Velde was called upon by the
Government to report on the situation. Amongst other things
he proposed that prizes and bonuses should be offered to the
farmers of the district for growing 2-acre lots of roots under
proper conditions. This was duhe. The crops were analyzed and
weighed in March, 1900, and yielded the following results :
The results were good, they were not brilliant or startling; but
they were such as would have enabled a factory to work. The
maximum crop was very good, better than the Port Fairy crop
of 1895 ; and many of the others also were good. Eleven of the
growers obtained over 15 tons of roots to the acre, but
thirteen obtained less than 10. At prices offered by the Maffira
factory when working, only eleven of these crops would have
been worth more than £lO an acre. It is doubtful if farmers
could be induced to grow beet-root regularly for less than £lO an
acre. Either then the crops would have to be better than this,
or the price offered would have to be higher.

Gain in Six Months
©
05
per cent.
In August, 1900, I was instructed to take over the work. It
was too late to attempt much ; and there was not much enthusiasm
either amongst the farmers of the district or any one else to
attempt anything. However, I arranged for growing J-acre lots,
with bonuses and prizes. The ploughing should have been done
in autumn. It had to be done a week or two before the sowing.
The sowing was late, and there was a dry spring, two months
with a total of only 1 inch of rain succeeding the sowing. The
conditions were unfavorable for obtaining the best results. How-
ever, 33 farmers’ crops were put in. Besides these an elaborate
set of experimental plots was laid out in the factory grounds.
When going down to arrange matters at Maffra, I noticed one
important fact. Some of the crops, which had been reported
upon in March, were still in the ground. It had been the belief
in Maffra that crops left in the ground until spring would be
completely spoilt for sugar production. I had the crops sampled,
and was surprised at the result. It is here shown :
The crops had gained nearly 40 per cent, in sugar contents by
being left in the ground for six months, while the purity remained
practically the same. Had all the crops been left in the ground
to the same date, and had they all improved in the same measure,
the yield of sugar per acre obtained in Mr. Van de Yelde’s opera-
tions would have been 2| tons instead of only 1| tons. Had the
harvesting operations been extended over five months there would
have been an average of 2 tons sugar per acre. Mr. Martin’s
crop was remarkable. I never before heard of a crop of 4| tons
of sugar per acre from beet-root.
The next season’s crops I determined to have tested from
month to month. The analyses were commenced in March, but
few of the farmers could keep their crops in till after June, as
owing to the dry season, fodder was scarce. The results of three
months’ analyses, April, May, and June, are here shown :

There were many good crops, 17 out of 29 having been worth
more than £lO per acre. But there were some poor crops. Why
should the crops have varied from a maximum of 2o J,- tons down
to a minimum of 4-| tons ? The difference is enormous. There
will always be bad farmers in any community: in the end these
drop out and give no further trouble. But all who got poor
crops this season were not bad farmers. They simply were new
at the work. They could not realize that when they were told
the land was to be deep ploughed and loosened to a depth of 14
inches, it must be worked to a depth of 14 inches. They all
stated they ploughed 12 inches, but I am sure some of them did
not plough deeper than Bor 9. They could not understand that
when they were told the plants were to be thinned to 8 inches
apart, there must be just one plant every 8 inches. Some of
them left three or four plants clumped together, none of which
could, of course, come to anything. Then they were told the
crops must be kept free from weeds if they were to succeed. In
two or three cases the beet-roots for a time could scarcely be seen
for weeds.
The crops at the top of the list were all well cultivated, clean,
even and regular. And, if the Maffra factory is to succeed, there
must be settled around it a sufficient number of farmers of such a
class as can be relied upon to properly cultivate the beet ground,
and keep the crops clean, even and regular. That is the whole
secret. If this be done the beet sugar industry will be a success.
It was not possible to analyze all the crops up to June ; some
dropped out each month, having been harvested for fodder.
But, taking the average of 23 crops, the results for the four
months were as follow :
Some of the crops were tested for six months consecutively.

Average value of seven crops for six months— £13.
* Computed averages for the seven crops.


The purity was the same at the end of the period as at the
beginning, while the average per cent, of sugar is a little higher.
The sugar at the beginning of the period was 1-87 tons per acre,
and at the end 2-62 tons, there being a gain of 40 per cent., the
same gain in fact as we saw to occur in Messrs. Martin’s and
Linton’s crops the year before. In the money value of the crops
(at Maffra factory prices), the gain was more than 40 per cent.,
being £lO Os. lOd. in March, and £l4 2s. sd. in August. The
average of these seven crops, had harvesting operations been
extended over the six months, would have been £l3. If the 29
crops in the district had been harvested between the months of
April and August, we can calculate, from the above results, that
the average yields of the district would have been 14| tons roots,
containing 2T5 tons sugar per acre. That is not a bad average,
considering that it includes the good and the bad together.
Now, I should like to show you in detail how the factory
experimental plots have taught us that the farmers could by
simple means have got a better average than that. On the next
page is a plan of the factory plots.

N, means nitrogen ; P, phosphoric acid;
and K, potash.
These plots were designed to test matters of manuring, width
of drills, distance of thinning, depth of cultivating, effect of
rolling, and effect of different amounts of hoeing. The same
experiments are being repeated this year, and I prefer not to
discuss the results in detail until the second series of experiments
is completed. But some of the results already throw useful
light on the matter.
For instance, in the manuring experiments, it was found that
the manure did not operate much until July and August, when
the winter rains had washed the manure dotvn to the roots.
Hence it appears that manure given at the time of late sowing
cannot act, if a dry spring follow. The manure should be either
ploughed in in autumn, or given at the time of early Sowing.
An unmanured plot in September yielded 2T2 tons of sugar
per acre. An adjoining plot which had received 90 lbs. per acre
concentrated superphosphate yielded 2'67 tons of sugar. Had
the farmers manured their crops, the general average of the dis-
trict might perhaps have been 2'67 tons sugar per acre.
Another result obtained at the factory plots reminds us of
what was obtained in the Port Fairy experiment of 1893-4, as
regards the effect of nitrogen manuring ; thus :
Then as to different modes of cultivating and planting : Tables
D, E, F, and Gr, contain figures showing the tons of roots per
acre (Table D), the per cent, of sugar in the roots (Table E), the
purity (Table F), and the tons sugar per acre (Table Gr), ob-
tained in the different “ cultivation ” plots. The tables contain a
lot of figures, a full discussion of which would occupy much
time, and need not be entered upon now ; but these figures will
give some idea of the amount of work involved m experimenting
of this kind. Altogether, nearly 750 analyses were done in con-
nexion with the Maffra experiments in 1901, most of the analyses
having been done by Mr. Easterby, now in charge of the sugar-
cane experiment station at Rockhampton, in Queensland.

There are just two features in these tables to which attention
may now be directed. The first is the effect of distance of
drills. Each of the plots from 17 to 25 was divided into two
sections, one section, as for instance No. 17, was of 16-in. drills,
and the other, as for instance No. 17a, was of 24-in. drills.
Farmers had asked if the beet could not be grown in 24-in.
drills, so as to make it possible to substitute horse hoeing for hand
hoeing. Taking the average of all the plots for four months—
There was not very much difference between the weight of roots
per acre ; there was a greater difference in the per cent, of sugar,
and there was a difference in the purity. Reference to tables E
and F will show that in every case the per cent, of sugar and the
purity was lower in the 24-iu. drills than in the 16-in. The
16-in. drills contained one-third of a ton more sugar per acre
than the 24-in. drills. The relative money value of the two
kinds of crops at Maffra factory prices would have been :


The difference in cost of cultivating would be only about 6s. ;
hence it is evident that the saving effected by the 24-in. urills
would not be a profitable one.
Then I would direct your attention to plots 20 and 21. Plot
20 was simply ploughed to a depth of 10 inches, and then
harrowed. Plot 21 was treated the same except that, in addition
to the ploughing, the subsoil was loosened to a depth of 14
inches. Now, you will see that plot 20, with plougliing only,
yielded an average of 1T95 tons of roots, but on plot 21, with
the subsoiiing, the yield was 14-81 tons. But this is not all.
Observe (Table D) how the crops on plot 20 remained constant
in weight after the month of May, while the subsoilod plot con-
tinued to grow.
If we look at the yield of sugar per acre (Table G), these
facts come out still more strikingly. The subsoiled plot continued
to increase its crops of sugar from month to month, thus :
Subsoiled ... P 96 2-05 2'12 2-27
While in the plot not subsoiled, the crop increased during the
first month, but afterwards fell back again, thus :
Not subsoiled P 65 P9O 1-67 1 74
These facts mean a great deal. They mean that if the roots
once get well down into the subsoil they are independent of
variations in surface conditions. They become to a great extent
independent of the weather.
We can understand that if we consider the character of a beet-
root.
The accompanying plate, Fig. I, shows some samples of well-
formed roots. These roots were able to go straight down into the
subsoil. One of them when pulled up was 4 feet long, and no
doubt went still deeper. What we see in the picture is not the
whole of the root. The feeding portion consisted of a ramification
of fine threads throughout the subsoil. If the roots can once get
down to depths of 3 and 4 and o feet they thrive and go on grow-
ing through the driest weather. But if the subsoil be not loose
they cannot readily get through, and the sort of thing shown in
Fig. 2 may take place.
Such roots as the latter would be bad in a double sense :
they would be bad at the factory because they would be difficult
to clean, and the dirt they would carry with them would cause
fermentations and loss of sugar ; and they would be bad in the
field,, being surface feeders, and therefore affected by every
change of weather.
Now there was no subsoiling when the Maffra factory was at
work ; there was late ploughing, there -was late sowing at the
beginning of two extraordinarily dry spring seasons, and there
were other irregularities. These facts completely explain the
failure of the crops. The beet crop always repays good atten-
tion. But in a treacherous climate like that of Maffra, not only

does it repay proper attention, but one cannot count on a crop
without that attention. Plough in autumn, subsoil, use manure,
sow early, thin regularly, keep away the weeds, and one can
count on crops like the 20 and 25 tons we got the last two years.
Plough late and shallow, use no manure, sow late, thin irregu-
larly, and let the weeds grow, and one can count on crops like
the 5 and 6 ton crops we got this year.
Now, I do not know what may be the impression on your minds
produced by all these facts I have laid before you. The impres-
sion on my own mind is distinctly favorable and encouraging.
The facts 1 have adduced, and the results of experiments, seem to
me to have proved that we have here in this country no natural
difficulties in the way of establishing the beet sugar industry ;
that, on the contrary, we have a climate which, if only things be
done in the right way, will show itself peculiarly favorable.
These are the facts, so far. There has been nothing sensa-
tional in them ; they have been simply good, promising, en-
couraging.
But I have now to finish up with a piece de resistance which is
really sensational. It is not my fault if the facts are sensational.
I give them just as they are. When visiting Maffra last year, I
found that Mr. Lee, who is in charge down there, had put in a
number of small plots, sown at different periods, the first being
sown on the 18th June, the second a week later, and so on for
twelve weeks successively. The interesting part about these
plots when I saw them was that the seed sown in midwinter
had germinated, and the plants had grown vigorously, even
through ice in times of frost.
These roots were growing in small raised beds of well-
prepared soil, just like a Chinaman’s garden. They were in
drills only 12 inches apart, not 16 inches as usual, and they
were only o inches apart in the drill. There were thus 12
inches by 5 inches, which is 60 square inches, to each root.
In the ordinary way there would be 16 inches by 8 inches, that
is 128 square inches, to each root. Thus in these small beds
there would be more than twice the number of roots per acre than
in a crop sown in the ordinary way. In the ordinary way, if
there were no failures, and there were a plant at every 8 inches
in the row, there would be 49,005 roots in an acre, and if each
root weighed 11b., such a crop would amount to 2P9 tons per
acre. With roots 12 inches apart, and plants 5 inches in the rows,
there would be 104,544 roots to the acre, and with roots of 1 lb.
each the crop would weigh 46'7 tons. If these roots contained
15 per cent, of sugar, the yield of sugar per acre would amount
to 7 tons. Would it be possible to get such a yield of sugar to
the acre 1 I have heard of one or two special cases where there
has been a yield of 8 tons of sugar per acre from sugar cane, so
(hat one need not primd facie regard it as an impossibility.

Now, in these small plots there were no misses ; every place
had its plant. On the 15th December samples were taken from
the four earliest plots and were analyzed. They contained on an
average 13'15 per cent, of sugar, and weighed on an average Jib.
At that rate there was an average of 4| tons of sugar per acre in
those small plots before Christmas. That was in the middle of
December ; hence we have here another most important advan-
tage presented by our climate, namely, that we can extend our
harvesting operations from December right up to August.
In the middle of June the plots were all sampled and analyzed.
I ought to say that in the first six plots some plants had by this
time gone to seed. In the earliest plot -'7 plants had gone to
seed ; in the second plot seventeen plants had seeded ; in the
third only ten, and so on. The last six plots were free from
seed. From these early plots we have selected for propaga-
tion a number of plants which did not go to seed, and we hope
thus to get a variety of beet-root which will bear the earliest
sowing in the Mafira district. The results of analysis are shown
in the following table :


Are not those astonishing results? Five, 6,7, 8, 10 tons of
sugar per acre ! If we take the average of the last six plots in
which no plants went to seed, the result is 61 tons of roots and
tons of sugar per acre. Such a crop at factory prices would
be worth £43 an acre. The figures are surprising. Even if we
discount them by 30 per cent, and get only tons of sugar per
acre, they still represent a notable achievement.
Now do not let any one run away with the idea that 1 put
forward such results as samples of what could be got in practice
on the large scale. lam not quite so foolish as that. But Ido
say this, that if we cannot make use of such highly suggestive
facts as these to guide us in the improvement of our industrial
practice, then we do not deserve to be called a practical people.
The answer to the beet sugar question in Victoria appears to
mo quite simple. Settle on the land around that Maffra factory
150 or 200 beet growers —men of the market-garden type of
cultivator—who will make beet-growing their primary business,
and adapt all the rest of their farm economy to the requirements
of the beet crop, and the beet sugar industry in Victoria will be
straightway a success. We shall need no bounties—Nature will
be our abundant bounty ; and Victoria may reasonably hope in
the end to rank amongst the foremost sugar-producing countries
of the world.
