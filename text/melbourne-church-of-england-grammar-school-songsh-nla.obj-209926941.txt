Carmen Melburniense.
Alexander Pyne.
Libros chartas anferamus,
Diem faustam concinamus,
Quas labori sedet meta
Nosque mittet domum lasta.
Chorus —
Eamus, Eamus, o sodales,
Clamate, clamate qui vocales ;
Sequamur frater fratrem
Canentes Almam Matrem.
Jam nunc campus est petendus,
Pilse ludus excolendus ;
Sic Anglorum proles crevit,
Sic Melburnii vigebit.
Chorus— Eamus, &c.
Date gratias magistris,
Gens togata floreatis,
Mores emollitis, mentes
Feras esse non sinentes.
Chorus —Eamus, &c.
Illi deinde collaudentur,
Qui Minervse dedicentur,
Fallant dolos Qusesitoris,
Pleni prodeant honoris.
Chorus —Eamus, &c.
(For Tenors and Basses only.)
Pila folle qui certatis
Quique remum fatigatis,
Civitati propugnate,
Palmam Scotis denegate.
Chorus —Eamus, &c.
(Trebles as before.)
Semper saeculi prioris,
Prisci memor sit splendoris
(Etas nostra, secutura
Tot res gestas, baud victura.
Chorus —Eamus, &c.

Nobis hsec sit lex diurna !
Sic Victorias sit Salus
Nostra domus, crux Australis.

♦The first two lines of the last Chorus to be sung slowly
and softly ; the third line slowly and forte ; the last line
crescendo, and same time as in former verses.
Games Song.
Play together, dark blue twenty,
Long and little marks in plenty ;
Get your kick, let none prevent ye,
Make the Leather roll.
Mark your men, keen effort straining,
On the ball and show your training;
Still though short the time remaining,
Get another goal.
Chorus —
None our ranks shall sunder,
Who will shirk or blunder ?
If all are true
To our dark blue
Our foeman must go under.
Honour ye the old School’s story,
Those who played and won before ye,
Bear the dark blue flag to glory,
Grammar to the fore.
Bat with patience unremitting,
Yorker, shooter, break outwitting,
All the loose ones freely hitting,
That’s the game to play.
Skill the bat and ball in wielding,
Smartness, judgment in the fielding,
Iron nerve and pluck unyielding,
Scarce can lose the day.
Chorus —None, etc.
Row the race boys, swing together,
Sinews tough as cords of leather,
Strong, yet light upon the feather,
Lift her, make her go !
Get the catch at the beginning,
Churn the tide in eddies spinning ;
Now a spurt; you gain ! you’re winning,
Melbourne Grammar, row.
Chorus —None, etc.
Some, in strife of sterner omen,
Faced the Empire’s Afric foemen ;
Fought, as erst their sires—her yeomen,
Won a deathless name.
Praise ye these, who stood for Britain —
These, by rebel marksmen smitten —
Praise them, for their names are written
High in storied fame.
Chorus —
None their ranks could sunder,
Who could shirk or blunder ?
So stood they true to the Old Dark Blue
And all their foes went under.
Honour ye the Old School’s story —
Heroes, who —her sons before ye —
Died or lived —but fought for glory,
Honoured evermore.


Forty Years On,
(From the Harrow School Book).
Forty years on, when afar and asunder
Parted are those who are singing to-day,
When you look back and forgetfully wonder,
What you were like in your work and your
play—
Then it may be there will often come o’er you
Glimpses of notes, like the catch of a song ;
Visions of boyhood shall float them before you,
Echoes of dreamland shall bear them along.
Follow up ! Follow up !
Till the field ring again and again
With the tramp of the twenty-two men —
Follow up ! Follow up !
Routs and discomfitures, rushes and rallies,
Bases attempted, and rescued, and won,
Strife without anger, and art without malice —
How will it seem to you, forty years on ?
Then, you will say, not a feverish minute
Strained the weak heart and the wavering knee,
Never the battle raged hottest, but in it,
Neither the last nor the faintest, were we!
Follow up! &c.
O the great days, in the distance enchanted,
Days of fresh air, in the rain and the sun,
How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted —
Hardly believable, forty years on !
How we discoursed of them, one with another,
Auguring triumph, or balancing fate,
Loved the ally with the heart of a brother,
Hated the foe with a playing at hate !
Follow up ! &c.
Forty years on, growing older and older,
Shorter in wind, as in memory long,
Feeble of foot, and rheumatic of shoulder,
What will it help you that once you were
strong ?
God give us bases to guard or beleaguer,
Games to play out, whether earnest or fun ;
Fights for the fearless, and goals for the eager,
Twenty, and thirty, and forty years on !
Follow up ! &c.
Willow the King.
(From the Harrow School Book).
Willow the King is a monarch grand ;
Three in a row his courtiers stand ;
Every day when the sun shines bright,
The doors of his palace are painted white,
And all the company bow their backs
To the King with the collar of cobbler’s wax.
So ho ! so ho ! may the courtiers sing,
Honour and life to Willow the King !
Willow, King Willow, thy guard hold tight;
Trouble is coming before the night;
Hopping and galloping, short and strong,
Comes the Leathery Duke along ;
And down the palaces tumble fast
When once the Leathery Duke gets past.
So ho ! &c.
“ Who is this,” King Willow he swore,
“ Hops like that to a gentleman’s door ?
” Who’s afraid of a Duke like him !
“ Fiddlededee ! ” says the monarch slim :
“ What do you say, my courtiers three ? ”
And the courtiers all said 11 Fiddlededee ! ”
So ho ! &c.
Willow the King stepped forward bold
Three good feet from his castle hold ;
Willow the King stepped back so light,
Skirmished gay to the left and right :
But the Duke rushed by with a leap and a fling,
“ Bless my soul ! ” says Willow the King.
So ho! &c.
Crash the palaces, sad to see ;
Crash and tumble the courtiers three !
Each one lays, in his fear and dread,
Down on the grass his respected head ;
Each one kicks, as he downward goes,
Up in the air his respected toes.
So ho ! &c.
But the Leathery Duke he jumped so high
Jumped till he almost touched the sky ;
“ A fig for King Willow,” he boasting said,
“ Carry this gentleman off to bed ! ”
So they carried him off with the courtiers three
And put him to bed in the green baize tree.
So ho ! &c.
‘‘ What of the Duke ? ” you ask anon,
‘ ‘ Where has his Leathery Highness gone ? ’ ’
O he is filled with air inside —
Either its air, or else its pride—
And he swells and swells as tight as a drum,
And they kick him about till Christmas comes.
So ho ! ho ! ho ! may his courteirs sing,
Honour and life to Willow the King !
