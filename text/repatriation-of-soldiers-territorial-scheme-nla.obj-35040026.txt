Repatriation of Soldiers: Territorial Scheme
Voluntary Co-operation in Contribution and Services
for the Repatriation of Returned Soldiers and
the Dependents of Fallen Soldiers.
1. Just as the authorities have divided the State into Territorial Divisions for the raising
of the new army, this scheme aims by a complete voluntary co-operative effort on the part of
the whole community at making provision within such territories for the soldiers raised therein.
2. All sections of the community are being appealed to. Firstly, land owners and land
users are being asked to aid substantially.
(a) Wheat growers to definitely set aside a section of their land to be cropped by them
during the season 1916. The total yield to be delivered by the grower, free of expense,
at the nearest railway station to the Government Wheat Pool, which in its turn is
being asked to receive, control, and convert same into money without charge, and
hand it over to the Banks. The Railways are being asked to co-operate by carrying
the wheat free of charge. The agents of the Government Wheat Scheme have
generously agreed to handle the soldiers? wheat without charge. Similar conditions
to apply to oats, barley, maize, hay, etc., and the like arrangements to be made


with the growers of potatoes, onions, fruit, etc. The dairyman?s contribution of
a cow to the soldier?s wife will be welcomed. Land owners who do not cultivate their
holdings and have no plant are asked to set aside an area and provide seed wheat,
and a working-bee of district farmers will put in and take off the crop.
Pastoralists, graziers, and stock owners are asked to contribute from their flocks and
herds, such stock to be immediately appropriated to the Repatriation Fund by being
branded ?R.S.? (Returned Soldiers). The stock to be delivered at the nearest
sale yards without charge. The Agricultural Societies and Pastoralists? Association
can assist in this connection. The auctioneers will also materially assist by stimulat-
ing the branding scheme ; and finally, when a locality has a good head of stock
subscribed, a date will be fixed for sale, and the local auctioneers will be asked as
their contribution to hold special sales, at which the stock will be delivered and
sold, the proceeds without any deduction to be paid into the Banks to a fund specially
created, and account sales handed to the local Committee. The Country Press has
kindly undertaken to advertise such sales without charge.
Those engaged m trade, commerce, professions, and financial undertakings are looked
to for direct monetary contributions. The requirements of the War have opened
up new, and stimulated many former, industries, and vast millions have been dis-
tributed locally for war requisites. Those whose business abilities and powers of
organisation have enabled them to handle huge war undertakings are asked not to
forget the soldier, who sacrificed his opportunity.


Since the outbreak of war the value of ready money has appreciated considerably.
Financial institutions have profited accordingly. The private lender has vastly in-
creased his income, and much is hoped for from both. Distributors have been busy.
Ship owners, above all others, have enjoyed exceptional advantages. Their sub-
stantial assistance to Australia?s heroes should be forthcoming. A new era has been
reached, and the mines of Australia wifi henceforth be appraised at a new value.
Thousands of miners are to-day on the Nation?s Honour Roll. Mine owners should
loom large in the Repatriation Fund.
3. All contributions in money, as far as possible, to be paid in direct to the Banks by the
donors, each donor getting a special official receipt (none other to be recognised) from the Bank.
Where this is impracticable the Municipal Councils have undertaken to receive contributions
and issue receipts. Lists will appear in the Press.
Public-spirited and thoroughly representative committees to be formed in each town and
centre to systematically canvass monetary contributions. Public servants and bank officials
have already set a splendid example by devoting a fixed percentage of their income to War Fund.
This scheme aims at the whole community co-operating in voluntary gifts and services to a com-
plete Repatriation Fund.
4. SERVICES. ?Many are unable to make monetary contributions, but by brains and
work almost all can assist in voluntary services. Where business expansion is possible, sums


will be set aside out of this fund to give a start in some small business undertaking to those so
fitted. There will be many cases where widows will be left with young children, and aged mothers
without supporters, with no knowledge, experience, or aptitude for business. In such cases
the scheme will aim at providing a small home. Already promises of vacant allotments in
many centres have been made. The Fund will supply the building materials, and will look to
the voluntary services of public-spirited workers to be organised into ?'working-bees' ? to erect
the cottage, fence the block, and put up small sheds. Over-furnished houses can spare useful
articles of furniture. In addition, the provision of a milch cow and some poultry will materially
assist such a family.
There is a huge field for voluntary work, both in the town and country. This can be
developed, thoroughly organised, and utilised to best advantage by District Committees. On
the farm of a fallen soldier, district farmers by forming a ?working-bee' ? could put in and take off
the coming season?s crop.
5. The scheme aims at the utilisation of the lands, business organisations, skill, know-
ledge, and services of the whole community in a great co-operative effort to place the soldier
and his dependents in at least as good a position financially as his pre-war condition. The
soldiers are taking out a Policy of Insurance for the nation on the battlefield. The families of
those who have paid the premium by giving their lives to the cause, or been disabled, must not
be left in want and suffering. Already 6,000 of our best men have fallen. The needs of their


dependents are with us to-day. The scheme should be put into immediate operation.
Non-combatants owe these gallant men and their dependents a debt that money cannot
repay, but it certainly can help to ameliorate their sufferings. What monetary gift can compare-
with the supreme sacrifice already made by brave men and noble women!
6. The Victorian Government is assisting this scheme by the gratuitous services of the
Wheat Commission, and in addition has agreed to take at call the funds to the credit of the
scheme and allow 4 per cent, interest on the daily balance.
The Commonwealth Bank and the Associated Banks have generously agreed to open a special
account at their branches to receive all moneys, keep accounts free of charge, issue a special
receipt, keep our books, and render statements, and thus obviate the necessity for a clerical staff;
compute and charge interest to the Victorian Treasury. The Commonwealth Bank has, in addi-
tion, by way of assistance to the scheme, agreed to allow interest on any funds whilst temporarily
in the Bank.
7. ADMINISTRATION. ?Care will be taken that in its operation this scheme will not
overlap or conflict with existing funds and organisations which have done magnificent work. This
is essentially a Repatriation Scheme.
It will be administered by Territorial Committees, with Local Sub-committees, in co-operation
with the Federal Parliamentary War Committee. The local knowledge, free services, and
sympathetic administration of District Committees will make for quick and effective action.


The funds will be under the supervision of the Auditor-General. They will bear interest from the
day donated, and the aim is that no deduction whatever shall be made for services rendered in
the administration of this scheme.
The greatest care will be exercised by the Local Committee, who have first-hand knowledge
in classifying the soldiers and the dependents of fallen men, also in personally conferring with
them before taking action on their behalf.
Practical absorption is aimed at ?in business and on the land ?not in undeveloped and
unimproved propositions, but in going concerns.
WE DO NOT AIM at Community Settlements on land or in industry of the returned
soldiers ; but, on the contrary, seek their absorption, as far as possible, in the district from
which they enlisted, where many willing and strong hands will be ready to assist them.
8. CO-OPERATION. ?Now is the time for a practical test on national lines of true
-co-operation, profit sharing with the nation?s soldiers in business and industry, and share farming
on the land. We should aim at promptly and advantageously placing and absorbing our returned
soldiers?not grouping or isolating them. Every industry can assist. It is the duty of all.
9. The Municipalities are doing the preliminary organisation work.
10. A generous Press is rendering much assistance.
