PREFACE.
In view of the present ruinous condition of the coal
trade of the Northern District of New South Whies, and of
the fact that the opinions of the Press, on many subjects, read
to-day, are forgotten tomorrow, it has been thought advisable
to republish, in the form of a pamphlet, the following leading
articles and the letter signed Argus, which have appeared in
the Newcastle Chronicle , a journal published in Newcastle,
New South Wales, and one in a position to speak with
authority on the subject contents. It is earnestly to be hoped
that this pamphlet may be carefully read and attentively
studied by shareholders in coal-mining properties in the dis-
trict referred to, as it is believed that, in the main, the great
body of them are ignorant of the causes that, lately operating,
have been so terribly injuring their property and depreciating
its value.

THE COAL TRADE.
Newcastle Chronicle, December 9, 1871.
Whatever the future may have in store for Newcastle,
though in years to come our export trade may become varied,
great and prosperous ?our output of coal then representing
only a portion of it?at present we have to look to the coal-
trade as our mainstay and support Anything, then, promis-
ing to improve the prospects of colliery owners and miners
should receive our warmest commendation and support. Any-
thing, to the contrary, threatening hostility to the interests
of the masters or the men, and thereby threatening the per-
manent welfare of the whole community, dependent on the
successful working of the mines for the means of obtaining
a livelihood, and for satisfactory returns on moneys invested,
ought to meet with the greatest reprobation and opposition.
Now, for a considerable time past, coal-owners have had
good cause to be dissatisfied with the very poor returns yielded
by their mines?not that any complaint as to falling off in quan-
tity or quality of the coal was heard of, or that the demand was
diminishing, but because of the low rate at which the article
was selling, the margin left for profit being almost inappreci-
able. But what were they to do? To raise the price to too
high a figure, and to do it too precipitately, would have been to
bring the competition of the southern fields about their ears.
They had already witnessed Bulli coal being shipped in this
port under their very noses, and were by no means anxious that
the trade they had hitherto enjoyed should pass into the hands
of others. The price had been higher, the returns better a few
years before, when the different owners were content to sell at


the one uniform rate, and to let the best coal find the best mar-
ket, although even in thus combining it was permitted to own-
ers putting out an inferior coal to take lesser value for it. It
was well understood that coal must be had, and that consumers
must come to Newcastle for it. The difference of one to two
shillings per ton in the cost did not deter purchasers, though it
made a vast difference to coal-owners. But little doubt can ex-
ist that, had the higher price been maintained throughout, it
could still, in the present day, ha-ve been obtained without a
murmur, and �70,000 per annum would have been saved to the
district, instead of being, as now, presented to strangers. There
came, however, a time when owners commenced to mistrust one
another, one firm, in particular, entertaining?so it would appear
?a belief, that all others interested in the coal trade must be
thoroughly dishonest, and that they were surreptitiously under-
selling the doubters. As a remedy for this, and in some mea-
sure to foil their rivals with their own weapons, the firm we
refer to ?biting off their noses to spite their faces?suddenly
lowered the price of coal. The compact was broken, each owner
was again at liberty to sell at his own price, and did so. As a
natural consequence, the exceedingly sagacious individuals who
had been the first to lower the price?not of their own, but of
their employers? coal?were driven to lower it again. Being un-
able to bring themselves to understand that other coal was pre-
ferred to theirs, and, therefore, commanded the greater market
?still believing that to chicanery were they indebted for the di-
minution in their output, hoping to get their custom back again,
which, in the first instance, they had taken from others ?this
near-sighted firm again sought refuge in the lowering dodge
(other word to express our meaning fails us) to be again fol-
lowed by the other owners, and to be again out-manoeuvred.
With many buyers, however, it has been found that coal is
simply coal. So long as there happens to be a difference in the
price of a few pence per ton, these persons give the preference
to the cheaper article. It thus followed that, for a while, the


only honest (in their own estimation) dealers, having cut down
prices, succeeded in increasing their output at the expense of
their rivals?in other words, they sold a larger quantity of coal
at a smaller profit, doing neither their proprietors nor the gene-
ral public any good, but, on the contrary, positive harm, that
the stranger might profit, and that they themselves might be
able to report to the directors how, by judicious management,
they had marvellously increased the company?s business; that
the directors might be enabled to report the same to the share-
holders, together with their intense satisfaction with the steps
taken by their energetic representatives and manager in the far
distant land, where lay their most valuable property; that the
shareholders might?not having opportunity of knowing better
?be equally satisfied with decreasing dividends for the present,
and fallacious hopes for the future prosperity of the mine in
which their money had been invested. So rolls the ball.
Now, were it but the one company or the one lot of pro-
prietors that suffered, or were it possible, by reduction in price,
to so increase the export of coal as to more than make amends
for the first loss, we should not trouble ourselves about the mat-
ter. But this has not been found to be the case. A reduction
made by one company has hitherto necessitated corresponding
reductions by others, so that in the end, the price and output ?
equal value of coal being always taken into consideration?have
regained and maintained their relative positions, and the original
reducers have benefited nothing in the way of Increased output,
whilst all have lost as regards profit. Neither has the export in
any way increased in consequence, as a glance at the statistics,
yearly published, most clearly shows. The coal trade cannot be
forced ; there is an annual consumption to be supplied, that
must be supplied, but that the difference of 6d. per ton in cost
cannot increase or diminish. The markets for our produce are
certain and well ascertained; they want our coal and would take
as many tons at 10s per ton as they will at 7s. 6d.; whilst as
to the amount of business done by the different coal-owners,


that?prices being uniform throughout?will depend entirely on
the superiority or inferiority of that which they offer for sale, so
that these successive reductions, whilst materially injuring the
whole of the coal interest, will never answer the purposes of
those originating them.
There is yet another matter in connection with this ques-
tion of reduction which we, writing in the interests of the whole
district, dare not pass by in silence. There is the effect such re-
duction is likely to produce on the prospects of the mining po-
pulation. It cannot be supposed that proprietors are going to
work for nothing. Their profits hitherto, at Bs. per ton, have
been nothing worth speaking of, and but for the pull they have
had on the small coal would, we suspect, have been less than no-
thing. All expenses of get, transit, and wear and tear, taken
into reckoning, coal put on board at 8s per ton must be almost
profitless, yet, in future, 7s. 6d. is to be the price. Who, then,
shall bear the burden? The proprietors will not ?cannot. There
arc left the miners only upon whom this loss must fall, out of
whose pockets must ultimately come this sixpence per ton, whilst
they will not obtain one extra hour?s work in consequence. How
this will affect these men, who for long past have barely man-
aged to eke out a living*, they themselves best know. If they
have a fancy for being ground down to the earth that others
may prosper at their expense, they must have imbibed it but
very lately. They have their rights. Labour has its rights.
These are threatened with invasion. Some time since we pro-
tested against any attempt on the part of the men to raise the
price of coal, believing then, and still believing, that any such
attempt would be futile. Wc should most certainly not protest
against any attempt made to prevent reduction ; on the con-
trary, our warmest sympathy and support would be with the
miners, should they endeavour, in the present instance to defeat
the attempt now making to reduce for it must come to that
their wages by sixpence per ton on their get of coal. If they
intend to fight this battle, they must do so remembering, that it


is a contest on the issue of which depends the future of thou-
sands?of themselves, their wives and families, of every man,
woman and child in the electorates of Northumberland and
Newcastle.
In conclusion, we must say that we cannot see anything
but folly in the course the Lambton Colliery, as represented by
Messrs. Morehead and Young?and Mr. Croudace, we presume
?have chosen to follow. If these gentlemen were paid so
much per ton for every ton got out, and cared only for their
own selfish ends, then could we understand their object in
thus trying to force an increase of business at the expense of
the shareholders. But this is impossible; such a charge
could never be laid at their door. Or were they endeavouring
to work the mine into their own hands, then could we con-
ceive no better way of doing it, for it is being rendered
practically valueless to the present proprietors. But this,
again, cannot be, for irrespective of the unimpeachable
characters borne by these gentlemen, they would know of
their own experience how difficult it would be to again raise
the price of coal to a paying point. It can only arise from an
error of judgment, but such an one as should be made known
?not to the directors, not to the local shareholders?but to
the shareholders of the company at home, whose property is
being jeopardised by the insensate proceedings of their local
representatives, but who, of themselves, know nothing about
their mine and its management, excepting that which Messrs.
Morehead, Young and Croudace, tell them through their
directors.
Newcastle Chronicle, December 16, 1871.
One of the greatest drawbacks to the prosperity of New-
castle hitherto, has been an occasional scarcity of tonnage.
Circular after circular has been despatched complaining of it,
advertisement after advertisement, for more, has remained un-
answered, until freights have risen to fancy figures, and still
there were no vessels seeking them. The fault, we were told,


lay with the governing powers. Over and over again we have
been assured that the imposition of new and higher customs
duties had diminished our imports, had thinned the foreign
shipping in our harbours, had left us in Newcastle without
carriage for our staple product. We were given to understand
that, unless we threw open our ports, and declared for ab-
solute free trade, our glory would depart from us. Large
fleets, inward bound to Sydney, freighted with the produce of
distant lands ?so it was endeavoured to be shown?meant
large fleets, coal-laden, outward bound from Newcastle.
Nothing was said about return freights of wool and station
produce from the capital, and the export of coal thence ; but
fearful were the prophecies as to the calamities threatening
to overtake us, one even going so far as to describe the board
and the writing thereon ?? This port to let,? ?which, before
long, was to be hung out at Nobby?s.
But no such notice yet swings to the breeze. Our harbour
is not yet destitute of shipping, neither do we find ourselves
quite so dependent on Sydney for it, as some would have us
believe to be the case. The ghost raised in the School of Arts
when our member met his constituents has been exorcised, and
discovered to be of the most ordinary sort ?a scooped out
turnip, a farthing dip, nothing worse ?nothing to be frightened
at. The carrying trade of the world is self accommodating.
Ship owners must perforce find employment for their vessels
Where there is anything requiring transport there will vessels
congregate. If British bottoms, better suited for the carrying
of perishable cargoes, get the pick of the trade, and disdain the
more modest loading we have to offer, what then ? Are there
not other maritime nations who are ready and willing to build
cheaper vessels, sail them more cheaply, and carry more cheaply
our imperishable cargoes, and to make a tidy profit out of a
business others would only lose by ? If that which we hear
be correct, namely, that only iron vessels can command grain
freights from California, and that, therefore, a large fleet of


wooden vessels is compelled to go seeking, we may reasonably
expect, with the constantly increasing demand for coal on the
North Pacific seaboard, that the numerous fleet now engao-ed
7 DO
in the supply, may not only remain permanently on the line,
but by degrees become even still more numerous. The Stars
and Stripes are holding out much greater promise to us than
our own flag is doing. American ships are already rendering
us, to a great extent, independent of the Sydney traders.
Possibly, by-and-bye, we shall find them entering on other lines,
and competing with our own vessels in the China and Straits
trade, until, at length, Newcastle coal carrying becomes to
them a settled occupation, not spasmodic, as it has been for
years, and regarded merely as a pis alter , a last resource for
freightless vessels. We trust it may be so. The prospect of
its being so is good.
fn the face, then, of this increasing demand, in view of a
plentiful supply of tonnage in the future, how particularly
absurd does the late reduction in the price of our coal appear.
At the other side of the world an increased demand is held to
justify an enhancement of value ; at this side the reverse of the
proposition would seem to obtain. Had there been a falling
off in the export, had it been alleged that this arose out of a
too long price demanded, and that serious and dangerous com-
petition threatened, then, perhaps the agents for the Lambton
Colliery shareholders might have put in a plea of necessity,
which might have been accepted. But it is apparent to all
that this is not the case; the prospects of the coal trade, and
consequently of our community, never looked brighter, and
the reduction can only be regarded as most wanton and arbi-
trary. In vain do we seek justification for the late action of
Messrs. Morehead and Young, who not content with injuring
themselves, are dragging down with them the interests of
thousands, even as Sampson, when he brought down the
Philistine temple, gave death to himself and the whole multitude
assembled. In a previous article on this subject we showed


how, in the end, the Lambton Colliery proprietary, so far from
gaining aught by this step, must inevitably suffer, and how,
they suffering, the whole people dependent on the coal-trade
must also suffer. How greatly this reduction must before
long affect the district, may not yet have impressed itself on
men?s minds; it is well that this should be understood. Taking
then, in round numbers, the export for the year now expiring
at 750,000 tons?to our thinking a moderate computation
?and deducting from the price thereof 6d. per ton all round,
which deduction the miners must hereafter be at the loss of,
we find that the actual weekly decrease of expenditure now
looming in the distance will amount to no less than �360.
Whilst none but strangers will benefit; this will be our loss.
We have heard it said by some that there is no intention on the
part of the management of the Lambton Colliery to lower the
miners? wages. Possibly not. There may be no present in-
tention, but a future necessity there is bound to be ; nothing
can prevent this. Against this, when it comes, the fatherly
interest evinced by the manager in all that concerns the men,
the liberal subscriptions and the picnics, will hardly prove an
acceptable set-off. Still, must it be confessed, that the whole
affair has been throughout most admirably managed; the union
has been sapped and weakened; the Lambton men have divided
amongst themselves their union money ; the string has been
loosened from the bundle of sticks; the men had begun to believe
in the integrity of their employers ; and the time had come to
drive in the thin end of the wedge of further imposition with
impunity, for it was thought that the men were helpless. How
strange, that just when the wire informed us of the great strike
at Newcastle in England, having terminated in a victory for the
men, they having won for themselves shorter hours and better
wages, there should have appeared in Newcastle, New South
Wales, this mischievous circular. Strange, too, that in Eng-
land, the working man should, year by year, better his position,
whilst his fellow in the coalmining districts of New South Wales
should be doing the very reverse. But?
The best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agee,


and so may, moreover, this move of the Messrs. Morchead and
Young, which, we feel convinced, is no new thing. It is all
very well for them to plead that others were underselling them,
and they found themselves bound, in self defence, to lower their
rates. The plea is wanting in genuineness. Did not Mr.
Croudace, at the luncheon on the bars of the new furnace,
when speaking on the prospects of the district, state that ? he
had every reason to believe the price of coal would be lower
before it was higher ?? Was not the luncheon on the bars given
long antecedent to the alleged underselling, and did not Mr.
Croudace speak oracularly ? To us it is patent that the inten-
tion had long existed, and all that restrained its execution was
a certain want of preparation?a preparation which, it was
fondly thought, was completed when disunion, to all appear-
ance, reigned amongst the men, and the will and the power to
act together had departed from amongst them. In this, how-
ever, the Lambton Company will probably find that they have
reckoned without their host. The men are commencing to ap-
preciate at their true value, the various kindly acts of their
employers. They begin to sniff at the mess of pottage, and to
doubt as to how far they would be wise in exchanging for it
their birthright?the right to a fair day?s wage for a fair day?s
work. There are those amongst them who have seen and
known in time of old the game now playing, and the conse-
quences invariably following in its train, and who are hardly
likely to sit still and see the ground slipping from under their
feet without making an effort to save themselves and all that
they hold dearest in the world. Closely must and will these
men watch the course of events. No matter how determined
the other companies may be to keep the price up to Bs. per ton,
they must be ultimately forced to lower their rates, and these
coming down, the wages also must diminish all round. Too
late then, for successful opposition, the mischief will be beyond
recovery ?all being in the one sinking boat, none shall be able
to help his neighbour. Too late then for regret?too late, when
some �20,000 per annum are being kept back from our own


people and given unto strangers. It behoves the men in all
patience to wait and watch, and when the time for action comes
then must they act with promptitude and decision, remembering
that u It is not meet to take the children?s bread and to cast it
to the dogs.? Nothing should we more regret to see than a
strike ; it is with the men, to a very great extent, to prevent
this, by at once warning the masters of the consequences of the
course they are now pursuing being persisted in. If, however,
the masters will have it, then let the strike be hearty and with a
will. We are not quite sure but that the men just now could
better stand the racket of a turn-out than could the coal-owners
themselves. ? Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just.?
Justice is on the side of the men. In the end their cause
would most certainly prevail.
Newcastle Chrovicle, December 19, 1871.
Hitherto, in noticing the late reduction in the price of
coal, the produceof the I.ambton Colliery, we have done so more
with a view to lay before the public generally and the miners
particularly interested, the almost certain consequences that
must ensue on the suicidal course thus initiated being persisted
in. We have brought the question home to the miners? hearth,
to the storekeepers? counter; with them now the duty to further
agitate, unless they are content to sit still and patiently submit
to the great trouble threatening them. In the present instance
it is with the coal owners we would speak, desiring to show
how injuriously this cloud, no, bigger than a man?s hand at
present, is likely to affect their prospects.
Well, although?and we are glad to hear it?other col-
lieries have expressed an intention not to lower their prices, we
very much doubt their ability to fulfil this intention. For their
own sakes, of the ill, a comprehensive reduction
would work to the district, they will doubtless endeavour to
maintain their price; but can they contend with the competition,
the determination of the Lambton Colliery to do business at


any cost? There is great cause to fear their being unable to do
so. They have large sums invested in their mining properties,
large sums that they dare not let lie idle. The work must go
on if the returns but cover expenses. They must wait and hope
for more prosperous times, and in the meanwhile keep steadily
jogging along until, in the end, the evil will have cured itself,
and the Lambton managers shall be found asking for their
produce the 10s. per ton it not long since commanded. That
time will come ; but in the meanwhile, what are we, dependent
on the coal-miner not the coal-owner, to do; what is the
miner to do ? How are we to get along whilst New Lambton
and the Co-operative Colliery are being gradually pushed out
of existence; and how are the other companies to do; how
the shareholders, when half-yearly meeting after half-yearly
meeting shall be held, and they shall be informed that owing
to adverse circumstances over which ? your directors have no
control,? the earnings of the mine will not permit the declara-
tion of a dividend ?
How greatly is it to be desired that the mutual dependence
of labour and capital on one another should be more thoroughly
understood than at present they seem to be. Their interests
are so thoroughly identical that one cannot suffer without the
other. Happy, contented, and prosperous workmen, make
happy, contented, and prosperous employers. The converse of
the proposition may be accepted as theoretically correct, but is
not practically so, inasmuch as the employed has his capital
limited to health, strength, and the full use of his limbs, whereas
the employer may invest his means, limited by his bank account
only, in various enterprises at one and the same time. He may
prosper, whilst some of his workmen may be skirting the
borders of starvation. He may even invest one portion of his
means in a coal-mine, another portion, say �30,000, in a cop-
per-mine, whilst these two may be supplemented by run-holding
and stock and station agency, dhese he may pit one against


the other, and by manipulation, may succeed in getting a
return for his investments ; but what are his men, on whom he
is virtually dependent, doing in the meanwhile? This are they
doing : They are becoming discontented and unsettled; they
are living from hand to mouth, taking no interest in their work,
thus diminishing their employers? profits ; they are ready to
leave their service at a moment?s warning, when a chance of
more satisfactory employment offers; they are becoming bad
servants to bad masters. A feeling of mistrust has been
engendered on the part of labour that, in the end, attacks and
sickens capital. Once the tension on the spring becomes
excessive, then the recoil comes. When labour has asserted its
rights, then the blow comes ; then the masters ascertain to their
cost that they have ignored social economy to some purpose,
and have lost, during one strike, not so much as a few hundred
pounds unearned, but the position they have only attained after
years and years of patient and laborious toiling. The men are
in the ascendant. The whole process has to be commenced
de novo .
How foolish, then, of any proprietary in this district to
risk anything of the kind as they have just done in this Lambton
reduction. How foolish to tamper with that which to them is
of more value than all their plant?the manual labour, without
which their plant is valueless; as foolish, as to put lead into
the stamper boxes of a quartz crushing machine.
But there is another most important consideration that
would seem to be entirely overlooked by the proprietors. This
we will endeavour to explain as briefly as possible. The cap-
ital stock of these coal companies has been converted from hard
cash into coal deposits. The mines have to be worked out of
returns, and dividends paid out of profits. Every ton of coal
put on the bank represents so much capital stock gone out of
the possession of the shareholders, for coal-mining, unlike the
generality of ventures, is not reproductive, docs not feed on its


growth, but is self exhausting. Every extra foot added to a
tunnel?s length makes the get so much the more expensive,
whilst there is so much the less coal to turn out. By-and-by,
a time will come when the seams, now being worked, will
have been worked out: it will then be necessary to sink down
to the next, the underlying seam. New and stronger hoisting
gear will be required, more underground machinery, and more
traction power. A -very heavy outlay will be absolutely
necessary ; the get will be yet more and more expensive; the
profits, at the reduced price, reduced to zero, will not only put
an end to all prospects of dividends on the stock already called
up and expended, but will make shareholders think twice before
they submit to any further calls being made. What then ?
This then : The mines will have either to close altogether or
fall, wonderful bargains, into the hands of those who will,
taught by the bitter experience of the original holders, work
them with a spirit of liberality to themselves, their workmen,
and the district.
That the attenuating process now going on will conduce
to this end may be regarded as a certainty, but that the valu-
able coal deposits of this district will remain for any length of
time unworked does not enter for one moment into our calcula-
tions. The danger does not threaten in this direction, but in
another totally different one. We must look for it in the com-
petition we may, ere long, expect on the part of the other coal
fields of the colony. We are leading now with a good strong
lead, the race is all our own. Should we stumble, should we
relax our exertions, should we once feel the breath of our com -
petitors on our shoulders, the task of again shaking them off
would be hard indeed. The time for a spurt would have passed;
the virtual monopoly of the trade we now enjoy would no long;er
be ours. We should have to divide it with others, and with
them fight over and over again the battle of prices. Unfortunately
the late reduction at Lambton is the first and a most important
step in this direction. If persisted in to any extent the result


thereof may be easily predicted ; Newcastle must lose her pre-
eminence. Other ports, drawing prosperity out of her troubles,
will absorb the greater portion of the trade that should be her
own, and, when all too late, it will be discovered that the price
of her coal, so easily depressed, is not so easily to be raised
again. We, however, have serious doubts as to how long the
Lambton management will be permitted to continue to thus de-
press the trade of the district. We have great hopes that the
home proprietary will be induced to take the matter in hand,
for their interests are as much jeopardised, if not more so than
our own, and that the next orders dispatched from England
will be of so peremptory a nature that the local manager shall
have no option but to obey them, come to an understanding
with the other companies, regulate the annual output with them
according to scale, raise the price of their own, and conse-
quently enhance the value of all other coal, or ?resign. The
Lambton proprietary have now no other course open to them,
if they wish to avoid the absolute ruin of their property. The
other companies are ready and willing to work with them. Let
them, then, cast in their lot with the other companies ere it be
all too late.
Newcastle Chronicle , January 27, 1872.
On the 10th of November, at the London Tavern, the di-
rectory of the Scottish Australian Mining Company submitted
to the proprietary their half-yearly report, for the term ending
the 30th June, 1871. In the absence of the chairman of the
board, through illness, Mr. A. L. Elder occupied the chair.
The report was the same as that published by this journal in
its issue of the Oth instant; it showed a profit sufficient to au-
thorise the declaration of a dividend at the rate of five per cen-
tum per annum.
At this half-yearly general meeting, at which this report
was taken, as read, the chairman made the following remark-
�s


able admission in reference to the Lambton Colliery, that is to
say, remarkable, when read collaterally with the late proceedings
of the company?s management here in New South Wales. He
said:?? They must not shut their eyes to the fact,
THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE COMPANY DEPENDED ON THIS
PROPERTY, AND IT MUST, THEREFORE, BE DEALT WITH IN
THE MOST CAREFUL MANNER POSSIBLE.? In Other words, that
the whole of the capital of the company, invested in no matter
what other way, had to depend upon the efficient working of
the Lambton Colliery for profit; the shareholders must look to
this alone for dividends. Now, has this property been dealt
with in the most careful manner possible ? The directory hold
that it has. We much regret being compelled to take a totally
different view from them upon this subject, holding, that so far
from its having been carefully dealt with, it has been brought
down to the verge of destruction by a spirit of competition,
which has threatened to blight the prosperity of the whole of
this district, and to involve its coal proprietors in one common
ruin. The local management, with a view, doubtless, to fur-
thering the interests of those whose money has been invested
in the company, and who wish ? to know the cause of the di-
minution in the dividend? to five per centum, have, singular to
relate, at about the very time this report was being considered,
reduced the price of the company?s coal by sixpence per ton ?
a reduction, apparently insignificant, but sufficing, as we have
already shown, to sweep away all dividend whatever. Further,
it is rumoured, that persisting?obstinately persisting?in the
suicidal course they have chosen to take, the company?s repre-
sentatives determined, at all hazards, to recover the trade
which has slipped from them?consumers best know why?
contemplate a yet further reduction of another sixpence per
ton. This will simply involve the company in an actual loss
of some �3500 per annum. Thus, all gain on its transactions
must, in future, be set down as a minus quantity.
Will, then, the management succeed in this their endea-


vour, coute qui coute , to recover their trade ? No. It is im-
possible that, by any such policy, they can do other than injure
themselves. They have already tried the experiment and have
failed signally. The local management, despite the chairman?s
statement at this meeting, that ? they had tried to keep up the
price of coal by combination, but had not succeeded,? have,
for years past ?the fact is patent to us out here? attempted, by
declining to combine with other colliery proprietors and by cut-
ting into their prices, to secure a trade that has been gradually
but surely abandoning them. That management has thereby
inflicted grievous injury on the district, great loss on the pro-
prietary, to the end that?what ? Do those concerned know
themselves? Yes, now they do?but they never foresaw what
was before them, what they have now learned. They having
done evil that good might ensue, like all who hold that the end
justifies the means, have discovered that the evil remains, but
the good has been unattainable. As a consequence, their trade
has not returned to them. Forced now, with only themselves
to thank for it, to work at a loss, what will the company pro-
pose to do ? Will they call upon the shareholders to pay up
yet more money, when the whole capital of the company is paid
up ? Shall they raise, by loan, the means to continue their ope-
rations, when their stock is quoted at a discount, and they are
notearning the wherewithal to pay intereston borrowed money?
Shall they, having dug a pit for others and fallen into it them-
selves, collapse, or what will they do ? Even were they to attain
their desideratum?the largely increased output, and to which
they have sacrificed so much?in what will it profit them, see-
ing that their working expenses, proportionally increased, must
conduce to a still greater loss, and that every ton of coal put on
the bank can but represent just so much capital stock gone for
ever from their possession ? To us, the compound faith of this
unfortunate company appears marvellous in the extreme.
The shareholders believe in their directors; they, in their
turn, in the local management; the local management in?
themselves. Wonderful faith ! Touching, but costly !


Time was when the management of this Lambton Colliery
scourged the other coal proprietors as with a whip of scorpions;
but the tables are turned?they are now flagellating the share-
holders of the Scottish Australian Company. They it was, who
brought the price of coal down to eight shillings; circum-
stances most singularly favoured them in thus reducing it, but
not in assisting them to the goal they strove to reach. The
price descended ; their trade rose?not at all. This was when
it might have been said with truth, that ? the coal trade of New
South Wales was overdone.? Mais , nous avons changetout
cola ; that trade is no longer overdone ; on the contrary, such
improvement has it of late manifested, that quite possibly the
current year?s export may touch nine hundred thousand tons.
The other proprietors can now ignore the doings of the Lambton
management, who, if they continue to compete as they are now
doing, must end by destroying the company they represent and
which atrophy now threatens.
In favour of this view, we adduce the few following
reasons : ?Allowing, for the sake of argument, that the Lamb-
ton Colliery, by their reduction in piice, should succeed in
recovering their trade. The utmost output they could compass
?and in this we are dealing most liberally with them?woidd
amount to four thousand five hundred tons weekly, or, deducting
two weeks for holidays, etc., two hundred and twenty-five
thousand tons annually ; an increase on their present export of
ninety thousand tons. But this would merely increase the
impossibility, if we may so express it, of paying any dividend
whatever, and?as we have already shown?must diminish
their capital stock by the value of those ninety thousand tons ; "
whereas, to the other companies, accepting, say, nine hundred
thousand tons as the current year?s export ?we believe it will
reach that quantity?there will remain for their share, six
hundred and seventy-five thousand tons. Their share for the
past twelve months, deducting Lambton?s one hundred and
thirty thousand from the seven hundred and thirty thou-


sand exported, was six hundred thousand. Their aggre-
gate increase for this year would thus amount to seventy-
five thousand tons, which must be had even at their full price
of eight shillings. It would appear then, that the power of the
Lambton Company for evil has departed from it; the other
companies are now in a position to treat both it and its manage-
ment with contempt. And this, the result of the management
the directors are so highly satisfied with! Well may a share-
holder demand ? the reason the company has come down to
such a low ebb.? Well may he exclaim, ?If Mr. Morehead
was the cause of the company?s non-success, he ought to be
removed from office.? Well may ? several other shareholders
maintain that there had been gross mismanagement on the part
of the company at home and abroad, and propose the appoint-
ment of a committee to investigate its present position.? But
faith, marvellous faith again prevailed! A motion on the
subject was lost on a division !
In conclusion, should this article ever come within the ken
of a shareholder in the Lambton Company, let him read his
directors? reports and then turn to the share-lists of the day ;
let him contrast the quotations of his own stock with those of
the stock of the Australian Agricultural Company. Let him
ascertain how it is that the latter company?s stock, with �2l
paid up, is quoted at from �29 to �3l, whilst his own is below
par. It is quite possible these few comments of ours may en-
lighten him on that point. Glad shall we indeed be if they do,
for his interests are our interests ; if he prosper we shall do
well, if he fail we shall have to participate in his loss.
Newcastle Chronicle, March 23, 1872.
Latest accounts from home represent the coal trade to
be in a state of unprecedented activity. The demand was
reported to be exceeding the supply. The price of the article
was steadily advancing. The prospects of the miners were


improving; their work was full and constant. Colliery
owners were doing exceedingly well, and there was every
reason to apprehend a continuance of this prosperous state
of affairs. Strange, the contrast presented by these accounts
with the present position of the coal trade here, in the dis-
trict of Northumberland. Here, although the demand would
appear to be inexhaustible, there seems to be something radi-
cally wrong in the matter of supply ; we cannot send our
coal away fast enough to meet the demand, and yet our prices
are constantly receding, threatening in the end reduction of
the miner?s wage, or ruin to those employing him. Where
shall we seek the cause of the depression exhibited at this
side of the world, of the scant fortnightly pay, of the com-
plaints made by the storekeepers, town and country, of dul-
ness of trade, of the small dividends received by mine pro-
prietors ; of the exodus to the goldfields now but commen-
cing, but promising, should the pioneers be successful, to
leave mining managers with but few hands to work their
seams, and those few in a position to demand an increased
wage ? In this shall we find the cause ?that there has been
no unity of action between the masters, and that they have
allowed one man, in an almost irresponsible position, to de-
stroy their trade, and by destroying their trade to work havoc
to all dependent thereon. One would think that the past
had had no lesson for them to learn, that there never before
had been gold-digging in New South Wales, and that this
had never taken men away in scores in search of the glitter-
ing metal that, found, paid them so much better for their
labour than the incessant underground toil that pays so
poorly. One would think, to watch the course of late events,
that the deep-sinking and driving of the quartz-mines
of the present day?more lasting and reliable than old
surfacing-digging?labour to which the miner has been
all his life accustomed, possessed no attraction for him,
and that he was tied hand and foot to his bord and his
skip. But this is far from being so. There is not,


as a class, a more reasoning and reasonable set of men
than the miners ; they understand the drift of all that is
going on around them as well as most people ; they see that
the coal trade is being beggared, and they argue that in the
wake of this follows beggary for themselves. Gulgong and
Tambaroora hold out to them temptations that, were they
steadily employed and prosperous, they would think twice
before yielding to. But what are they to do ? The argu-
ment is this : Is it better to wait until the evil day has over-
taken them, or at once to strike out a new path for them-
selves, and to embrace the opportunity that quartz offers and
coal denies ?
We have seen already how that, at home, the men are pros-
pering, and the masters, as a consequence, are following suit.
But can the same be said of our coalminers and mines ? Most
certainly not. The masters cannot be expected to carry on their
operations at a loss ; as a consequence, their men, when the
mines no longer pay fair interest on the money invested in them,
must cease to be employed. To retain them in their present
service would be matter of no great difficulty ; they are not a
migratory class by any means, but once they have departed and
have struck out for themselves another and a new and more re-
munerative line of life, it will be by no means an easy task to
induce them to return to the old calling that has thrown them
over. To those who are concerned in the startling and suicidal
reductions lately made in the price of our staple product, all
this may appear but of little significance?possibly it may suit
their views that, in the end, mining labour should become scarce
and dear. There may exist, under the surface of doubt and
mistrust engendered by their proceedings, an unfathomable
depth of philanthropical intention, and a belief that out of their
action will yet spring the regeneration of masters and men. We
confess to being unable to regard their action in this light Our
view is limited to the present time, to what is now passing
around us, and that which comes under our notice is anything


but reassuring. Yet a little while, should there be no chano-e
O
for the better, and the prosperity of Newcastle and its neigh-
bourhood will become as a legend of the past.
We really had thought, when last we wrote of the reduc-
tions made without rhyme or reason by the Lambton Company,
that the management had done their worst, and that they would
await further instructions from the Board of Directors at home
before taking any further steps. The report of the last half-
yearly meeting was not of a satisfactory nature, at all events to
the shareholders; what they will say to the news when it
reaches them, of still further reduction in the price of their coal,
we shall not know for some time yet, but we should suppose
they would hardly take it in good part. Nevertheless, such fur-
ther reduction has been made, ostensibly with the idea of
recovering the loss of trade their pit has been gradually but
surely sustaining. Still, this is a matter which the share-
holders, one would think, could be safely left to deal with, nor
should we concern ourselves with it, were it not that the
interests of the whole of the mining district and the port of
Newcastle are placed in a position of extreme peril by the
continuance of this system of under-cutting prices, which not
resulting in any of the benefits sought to be attained, disturbs
the balance of the whole community.
Seeing, then, that it is demanded of us to deal with the
subject, in the interests of the public generally, and believing
that when we object to the pursuance of any system promising
to act injuriously towards the public, we are also somewhat
bound to suggest some measure whereby such injury may be
obviated, we would submit the following proposition, which, we
think, would have the effect of, to a great extent, neutralising
the selfish policy of the management of the Lambton Company.
Let all the other collieries, the A. A. Company, the Co-opera-
tive, the New Lambton, the Wallsend, the Waratah, and, if need
be, the Anvil Creek and Burwood, unite and agree not to put a


single ton of coal ?outside already existing contracts ?on board
ship, rinder, say, nine shillings per ton, and then select one of
their number to fight the Larabton Company with their own
weapons, reducing, step by step, with that company, the price
of coal, and supplying it at the same rate ; any loss to the
selected company being made good out of the extra shilling
earned by the others, The profits being thus brought up to an
uniform level amongst those thus combining, the battle could
be fought from the highest vantage-ground, and the result
would not long be doubtful.
The welfare of a whole community is at stake; coal-
owners, miners, and tradespeople are all interested in this war
now going on between the one company and the many, but only
from united action on the part of the coal-owners, who must be,
after all, the greatest sufferers, should the Lambton manage-
ment persist in their course of folly, can relief be expected.
The Lambton Company have thrown down the gauntlet, ear-
nestly do w r e trust to see the other companies take it up and
fight the fight out to the bitter end. None but will endorse
their conduct, should they do so ; they would be improving
their own position and earning the lasting gratitude of hun-
dreds whom the proceedings of this one selfish and
like management are filling with disgust and despair.
The Larabton management are striking blow after blow,
deep into the vitals of the mining and all other interests of this
community ; in self-defence, we advise blow being struck for
blow, until, exhausted, the enemy lies prostrate and powerless
for evil at the feet of the victors. Push the other companies
out ? Not yet has this been done. If any pushing out is to
be accomplished, after what has lately taken place, we should
infinitely prefer before anything else, the closing of the Lamb-
ton pit, with the disappearance from the scene of its Sydney
representative. A victim, self-immolated on the altar of insa-
tiable greed, and wondrous, monstrous insensateness, would be


the verdict found. None would regret the holding of the in
quest.

R EDUCTION IN PRICE OF COA L.
To the Editor of the Newcastle Chronicle.
Sik?The recent reductions in the price of coal by the Lambton
Company being the all-absorbing topic of the day, I crave a space in
your valuable paper to make a few remarks upon the history of the
coal trade, and the reasons assigned by the colonial agents of the
Lambton Company for making the late and previous reductions. I
may mention that I am in favor of fair and legitimate competition,
but where the interests of thousands of persons are concerned and
jeopardised by a system of insensate competition, I think it high time
that some of the circumstances of the case should be laid bare. One of
the principal reasons assigned by Messrs. Morehead, Young, and
Croudace, for these reductions is, that other coal companies were,
by underselling, robbing them of their legitimate trade. In order to
show the fallacy and unreasonableness of this statement it will be
necessary to revert to the state of the coal trade previous to the Lambton
Company commencing operations. There was a time when the A. A.
Company had a perfect monopoly of the Melbourne trade, and enjoyed
that monopoly uninterruptedly for a number of years until the Wallsend
Company opened up their colliery. The better quality of their coal
did, in time, all but drive that of the A. A. Company out of the
Melbourne market, an advantage they maintained until the Lambton
Company started. The quality of the Wallsend coal was known to
have deteriorated about this time, and to have lost its prestige in
consequence of the workings extending towards the dip. Here they
met with large quantities of iron pyrites and other impurities running
through their coal, so that all the care taken by the colliery and local
managers to send a clean coal to market entirely failed. In the
meantime the cleaner article supplied by the Lambton Company
superseded that of the Wallsend, as the latter had done that of the
A. A. Company, who, in turn, notwithstanding their large colonial
influence, had to succumb, and Lambton took the lead for a time in
the Melbourne market. These customers, which had previously dealt
with the A. A. and Wallsend Companies, are some of those which the
Lambton managers choose to call ? their customers,? and which they
complain of having lost through the ?double-dealing? of other
companies. Had new coal-consuming industries been commenced for
the sole purpose of benefiting the Lambton Company, there might
then have been some show of reason, if not of justification, for the use
of the term ? our customers,? but the fact is they came into the trade
at a time when the supply was far greater than the demand, and


whatever trade they did get had previously been supplied by other
companies, so that, in reality, if any have reason to complain, it is the
A. A., Minmi, Burwood, and Wallsend companies, all of which were in
full operation long before the Lambton Company was in existence.
Having stated how the Lambton Company got, at least, part of ? their
customers,? it may not be out of place to trace, in a measure, how they
have lost them. It is well known that the quality of the A. A.
Company?s coal from their pit No. 2, was superior to that they had
been working previously, and that fact, coupled with the great facilities
their private staiths gave for ready despatch in the loading of vessels,
enabled them once more to recover their former trade in the Melbourne
market. Thus the Lambton, like the Wallsend Company, having
worked out their best coal, the A. A. Company took the lead of both,
and re-occupied about the same position it did before either of the other
companies entered the field. Hence the Lambton Colliery now begins
to realise its true position, which is about the same as that of the
Wallsend some year ago, before they had opened out their new coal-field,
which yields a superior article to any they had previously produced from
their former workings. It may be well here to mention, that the
Minmi Colliery, at one time, not only supplied the Australasian Steam
Navigation Company's contracts, but also nine-tenths of the coal
consumed in Sydney ; but the Minmi Company lost this trade, for the
same reasons and from similar causes that Wallsend, Lambton, and
other coal companies lost their Melbourne trade. From the foregoing
statements it will be perceived that the Lambton Colliery is by no
means entitled to claim any as their special customers since other
collieries have each had them in turn, and it will also be perceived that
each of the other companies have been placed in similar circumstances
as regards those customers. But let us now review the conduct of the
other companies when placed in like positions. Did the A. A.,
Wallsend, and Minmi Collieries have recourse to the same means that
Mr. Morehead is pursuing to regain their customers? Did they,
regardless of their shareholders interests, reduce their coal below a
paying price? Did they, for the purpose of forcing a trade, lose sight
of all vested interests, and recklessly advertise their coal at a price
which will barely cover working expenses ? Did they ruthlessly
sacrifice not only the interests of other companies, but also those of
their own shareholders, thus giving to the foreigner what ought to have
gone to pay dividends on capital invested, and keep up wear and tear ?
No, they did none of these things, but battled with the difficulties of
their position as best they could, and by sparing no pains in producing a
superior article maintained the character of the trade, and by these means
secured more customers, than any reduction in price would have given
them. I can remember when, for nearly two years, the A. A. Company
did not work more than half time, but the colonial managers of that
company, instead of reducing the price on that account did all in their
{tower to get it increased, and so make up the loss occasioned by a
imited vend, knowing, as every sensible man must do, that a small
vend and a low price is like lighting a candle at both ends. Those
interested in the trade will recollect the agreement entered into by the
various companies (including the Lambton) with a view of establishing
and maintaining a remunerative selling price for all coal shipped at the
port. After mature deliberation, 10s. per ton was the price fixed as the


minimum. This agreement lasted for a period of about eight months,
and was then broken up solely at the instance of the Colonial
representatives of the Lamb ton company. The reason assigned for this
breach of agreement was that the other companies were underselling
them, and that in consequence they had suffered a loss of trade. How
far this pretext was borne out may be inferred from the following
facts.?During the eight months the agreement existed the Lambton
company sold about 15,000 tons more at 10s. than the A. A. company
did, while during the succeeding eight months, after the agreement was
broken, and the price reduced to Bs., the A A. company sold 12,000
tons more than the Lambton, which tends to prove that if any additional
trade was obtained by under-selling whilst the agreement lasted, it must
have been on the part of the Lambton company. Moreover, at that
time the annual vend of the Lambton company exceeded that of any
other in the trade by several thousands of tons, whereas at present it has
fallen below that of several companies, and now only occupies a third
rate position in this respect. What then the value of this pretext,
or where the gain to the company by the capricious and suicidal policy
adopted by its Colonial managers ? Another very strange reason, and
one which ought to be paramount with the Lambton management is, that
their shareholders were receiving 10 per cent, dividend when the price
was 10s. per ton, but since the agreement was broken, 6 per cent., with
coal at Bs. per ton, is the highest dividend they have been able to
declare. What will their dividend be at 7s. ? It is thus demonstrable,
that while the vend of the company has not increased, it is equally
certain that the dividends have decreased since the terms of the
agreement were departed from, and it now becomes a question for the
consideration of the shareholders whether, and in what way they have
forfeited by the action taken by their local managers. Directors and
shareholders living at such a distance from the seat of operations
cannot be supposed to be cognizant of all the circumstances connected
with the coal trade here so well as those residing on the spot, otherwise
the affairs of the company would not have been so compromised. It is
well known that the other companies have exhausted every legitimate
means to convince Mr. Morehead of the impropriety of his course of
conduct, knowing, as they did, by experience, that reducing the price
below a reasonable rate would not increase the amount of trade. All
these attempts having failed, it was then proposed to establish a vend,
the coal to be 10s. per tan, nett cash, and giving to each compony a
certain proportion of the trade done at the port, which was estimated at
the time at 640,000 tons annually:?Wallsend Company, 120,000
tons; A. A. Company, 120,000 tons; Waratah Company, 120,000 tons;
New Lambton Company, 90,000 tons ; Co-operative Company, 60,000
tons; Lambton Company, 130,000 tons. This proposition was
rejected by Mr. Morehead, and the scheme was abandoned in
consequence. Subsequently, another proposition was made to
Mr. Morehead, in which the other companies agreed to enter
into a pecuniary bond, to raise and maintain the price of coal
to a remunerative rate, providing he would give his bare word to
follow. But he met this proposal with the same disdainful opposition
he had done all the others. In the face of these overtures, how
can Mr. Morehead say that the other companies were trying to de-


prive his company of a fair share of trade, when they actually offered
to give him a vend of 10,000 tons more than any other company in the
trade?not that the Lambton Colliery had more capital invested, but
because they considered it better, when doing a small trade, to get a
good return, rather than exhaust their coalfields and get no profitable
return at all. Did Mr. Morehead meet any of these propositions in a
friendly or commercial spirit with a view to the benefit of his share-
holders? No! He had recourse to mere subterfuge about crippling
trade, &c., and, in substance, told the gentlemen who waited on him,
that he did not consider there was ? an honorable man amongst them.?
In the proposal to establish a vpud, had no provision been made to
meet an increased demand, then Mr. Morehead might have been justi-
fied in raising the objection he did; but such was not the case, because
each company agreed to be bound, under a heavy penalty, to supply
only their fair quota of any such additional increase. Had the propo-
sal, also, to raise the price to 10s. per ton, been agreed to, it would
have made 3s. per ton difference to Lambton, Waratah, and New
Lambton, who are now selling at 7s. per ton, and of 2s. per ton to the
A. A. Company, Wallsend Company, and Co-operative Company, who
are still selling at Bs., making a difference to each company on the pro-
posed vend, as follows:?Wallsend Company, �12,000 per annum; A.
A. Company, �12,000; Waratah, �18,000; New Lambton, �13,600;
Co-operative, �6,000 ; Lambton, �19,500 ; in all, �BI,OOO to the share-
holders of the various companies. But this amount has been annually
lost through the action of one man and his coadjutors, and given
chiefly to the foreigner, without any commensurate advantage accru-
ing to the colonial or intercolonial consumers. The trade here is in
the hands of six companies, having no foreign producers of any conse-
quence to compete with. It therefore shows an utter disregard of the
circumstances of the case, as well as of the interests of those they pro-
fess to serve, by thus selling coal at a less price than they do in Eng-
land, where the supply exceeds the demand to a much greater extent
than it does in this colony. Report has it that it is the intention of
Mr. Morehead to run some of the present colonial companies out of
the market. Suppose that to be the case, and that he succeeded,
would it not rather tend to injure his position than otherwise ? Those
collieries so run out of the market would then, in all probability, fall
into other hands, who, not having passed through the ruinous ordeal,
would be in a better position to compete with, and undersell, the
Lambton Company, than any of the older companies. Take for
instance, a company with a capital of �IOO,OOO, which has been all
expended in stocking the colliery with the most approved appliances.
If the property of such a company, in consequence of the present low
price of coal, should be forced into the market, the probabilities are,
that it would not realise more than one-third of its value. The
purchasers of such a colliery would become much more formidable
opponents than the present proprietors, inasmuch as they have all the
appliances and advantages of the larger capital, and only a dividend to
pay upon the smaller. It would, therefore, be wiser, after all. oir the
part of Mr. Morehead, before proceeding any further with this
scheme, to consider whether it would not be easier to deal with the old
than a new proprietary under such circumstances. It is a well-known
fact, that the large contractors in Melbourne would as readily pay 10s.


as-7s. per ton, being more concerned in obtaining a fixed and settled
price for the year; indeed the purchasers in Melbourne, New Zealand,
Adelaide, and elsewhere, actually laugh at the stupidity and folly of
the New South Wales coal proprietors. It will be seen from the fore-
going remarks, that the Waratah and New Lamb ton collieries have
also reduced their prices to 7s. per ton, but did not do so until
Mr. Morehead had issued his circulars to the trade, informing them
that the price of the Lambton coal, after a certain date, would be 7s.
per ton. It is an acknowledged principle in all colliery working, that
quantity will, in a given ratio, reduce the aggregate cost of production.
Perhaps, the Lambton managers calculated that by reducing the price
to the present low figure their trade would increase in proportion, and
thus compensate them for the difference between Bs. and 7s. per ton,
forgetting all the time that even if such was the case they were ex-
hausting their coal-field to realize a given result which would have
been more easily accomplished upon the lesser quantity and the higher
price. On the other hand have they considered the probabilities of
the other companies also reducing their price, which must have the
effect of placing them in precisely the same relative position as before
the reduction took place ? It is no secret in the district that the
manager has said, that Lambton must do a large trade, even if they
have to reduce the price to 6s. per ton. We may therefore, expect to
have further reductions in that quarter, unless the shareholders step
in and put a stop to this suicidal conduct. If the Colonial managers of
the Lambton colliery were paid by a premium on the quantity raised,
it would then be easily understood why quantity with them was a
paramount consideration. Such a system would afford scope to the
cupidity of unprincipled men, and induce them to regard their own
personal aggrandizement before the interest of shareholders, or of any
others which may be involved in the issue, but when such is not the
case, I know of no other reason applicable to their conduct than that
given by an old Scotchman, who used to say when remonstrated with
for doing certain things?? I care not how bad I am, so long as other
people are as bad.? It may therefore be a consolation to Mr. More-
head to know, that if the low price ruins his company, it will ruin the
others also. In conclusion, 1 would ask Mr. Morehead?lst.: Has he
laid before his directors the many proposals made to him by the other
companies to raise the price to a paying figure, more especially that
of the vend, where they proposed to give him 10,000 tons more than
any other company? 2nd. ; Has he told them that the very best of
their coal-field is being worked out, and that every other colliery in
the district has found that the quality of coal gets inferior as they are
worked towards the dip, and that there is no reason to believe that
their colliery will be an exception to the rule? 3rd. : Has he told
them that, in order to keep up this ruinous competition, encroachment
after encroachment has been made upon labour, until it can bear no
more ? 4th.: Has he told them that, this year, notwithstanding their
having reduced the price of their coal, the output of their colliery will
be about 20,000 tons less than that guaranteed in the proposed vend ?
sth. : Has he told them that the other companies have, over and over
again, requested him to raise the price, and that they would bind
themselves to sell at the same rate? 6th.: Has he told them that the
other companies were willing to enter into a pecuniary bond to sell at


a lixed price of 10s., if he would only give his word to do the same ?
Lastly, and above all, I would ask him whether he has told his share-
holders that his breach of the agreement to sell at 10s. has lost them
�19,500 per annum, which (taking their capital at �130,000) would
have given them an additional dividend of nearly 15 per cent. ? If not,
then, in justice to the trade in general, and his shareholders in par-
ticular, I hope he will do so ; and I venture to affirm that, if the share-
holders of the Lambton Colliery will cause an investigation to be made
into the truth, or otherwise, of these allegations, they will find all that
I have stated fully borne out, and, further, that all the other companies
are prepared, at any time, to raise the price of coal. Apologising for
the length of this communication, I am, yours, &c.,
ARGUS.
