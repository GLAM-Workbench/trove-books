THOMAS J. McMAHON
SOME forty years ago German
travellers ostensibly traders?
came into the South Pacific and,
after various moves in doubtful
trading, became especially busy in stirring
up the natives on many islands in constant
tribal and inter-tribal warfare, thereby
creating constant annoyance and danger
to British missionaries and British and
Australian traders. They began by teach-
ing the natives the effectiveness of powder
and shot as compared with bows and
arrows.
After years of mischief they took
possession of what can truly be called one
of the richest island territories of the whole
Pacific, and now known, with its hundreds
of islands, large and small, as German New
Guinea. Undoubtedly, as records show
and events have proved, this territory
was chosen more for its strategical sig-
nificance, with its nearness, as regards
the Australian prize, than for its wonderful
resources, amazing commercial possi-
bilities and prospects, which nowadays
are attracting considerable attention.
To-day, by the fortunes of war, German
New Guinea is not governed by a German
administration, but by an Australian
military administration, a notable and
remarkable fact that brings forward the
eminence of Australia in Imperial affhirs,
and the assistance that is being given the
Empire in these days of strife.
It is to be hoped it shows also the
promise of direct and central control of
the islands of the South Pacific by
Australia in the bright future to come,
when war has ceased and the avenues of
prosperity are open once more to com-
merce.
From the nearest point of Australia to
that of German New Guinea an airman
might fly in time less than one hour. By
a fast cruiser rounding Papua (British
New Guinea) it could easily be done in less
than forty hours. It is palpable facts
like these that are just at present dis-
quieting the people of Australia, now fully
realising the meaning and menace of the
strategy of Germany in the Pacific and
her designs upon the Commonwealth ;
designs which German plans have re-
vealed of a grand Pacific German Empire
in the southern hemisphere, with Australia
as the crowning jewel. There is now
documentary proof of the ambitions of
Germany in choosing on this useful island
territory of German New Guinea, with its
remarkable number of deep water bays
and harbours, safe bases, complete and
ready for all naval uses. The most impor-
tant, Blanche Bay, to the east of New
Britain, and on which is situated the seat
of administration, Rabaul, could not be
surpassed for depth, shelter and secrecy,
and could carry upon its extensive waters
the navies of Britain, France,and America.


The Germans have denied that plans
ever existed looking to the entrance of
England into this war, and declared the
Pacific was safe from invasion. Facts
now clearly show this denial to be a pure
German lie, for long before Rabaul was
settled as a town great, permanent,
and well-made roads were carried to
every point of the compass, and right to
the hill-tops of New Britain, the island
that commands the Pacific waters on
every side, and to the best possible
advantage, and these roads were made
not for the benefit of the German
planter and trader, but for the expeditious
movements of big guns. Furthermore,
the spot now occupied by a Japanese boat-
builder, upon the deep harbour basin in
front of Rabaul, was planned for and to
some extent made ready as a naval dock
of suspicious dimensions, too large by far
for any needs of the remote Pacific in
these days.
Still under German Laws
There is no greater regret ?openly
expressed by Germans in German New
Guinea to-day?than that the docks and
fortifications of the islands were not in
readiness at the beginning of the war,
and that a standing army of trained
German soldiers, combined with the
numerous native soldiery, most cleverly
drilled, and able to do the ? goose-step ?
to perfection, were also not in readiness
to support the plans of the German
squadron then in Pacific waters.
Germany has not successfully colonised
even one of her small possessions. It is
said she lacks the gift of colonisation, a
gift purely British, but here in German
New Guinea Imperial money has been
most liberally spent for the one purpose
that is all too evident, of making of this
island a territory, a stepping stone to
unlawful possession of unlimited posses-
sions in the Pacific merely for German
aggrandisement and the furthering of
German trade. Though lacking a popula-
tion of the ordinary agriculture colonists,
the German officials and traders, by
forced labour from the natives, have
in a wonderful way brought out the many
rich resources of the islands of the terri-
tory. They have carried on a develop-
ment of all tropical products in such
abundance and of such quality, and with
such profitableness, that indisputably
German New Guinea is one of the grandest
assets territorially and commercially in
the wide Pacific.
The terms of occupation by which
the Australian Administration carries on
limit the powers of the Administration in
an extraordinary degree. German New
Guinea is still German owned, governed
by German laws and customs of so
stringent a nature that the law of ? lese
majeste ? ?to wit, the calling the Kaiser
an ass?is a punishable offence, should
anyone desire to enforce the penalty.
These terms of occupation are faithfully
recognised by the Australians, and in
consequence trading and development by
the Germans are going on apace. At no
time under German rule has there been
such prosperity, and in a sullen fashion
the German settlers express admiration
for the tactful and honourable administra-
tion by Australian officers.
German New Guinea is a second Java,
and it is reckoned by Britons and Ameri-
cans ' who have visited the territory
recently that under a liberal British
scheme of colonisation in ten years? time
these rich islands could easily vie with
the present progress of Java. Coconut,
rubber, coffee, cocoa, and many other
tropical products grow in the most
prolific manner, grow cheaply and quickly.
With a rational policy governing native
labour it is estimated by the Australian
Administration that the future of German
New Guinea is one of incalculable com-
mercial possibilities.
The German administration showed
wisdom in many ways, and though it
laid down roads for big guns, it has in
lieu of railways built innumerable narrow
tracks through, round, and over all its
island territories, and these have been
most helpful to planters in aiding develop-
ment. These tracks the Australian Ad-
ministration have now widened and
levelled, in nearly all cases, into splendid
roads for the heaviest traffic.
German Confidence
Since the days of occupation German
settlers have been feverishly pushing
forward development of all kinds, acting
not at all like a people who think it is

ever possible the territory may pass into
other hands. They are optimistic as to
the future, and laugh at the idea that
any other Power than Germany will be
paramount in the Pacific.
It is known that when Germans meet
in planters? houses and are safe from the
Australian official eye they toast to
? the day ? when Germany will rule again
in the Pacific, and when the possession
of the Australian Commonwealth is an
accomplished fact. They say they will
do in ten years what Australians have
failed to do in a hundred ; more, they
maintain that when that time comes there
will be no need to conquer Australia ?
? they will lap it up as a dog laps milk
from a plate,? in the exact words of a
German settler.
; There are many signs of wealth among
the Germans in this territory. A planter?s
home is no mere shack, it is a of
true German commodiousness and lavish
comfort ?a mansion invariably surrounded
by a small park, with gardens in which
fountains play, and statuary gleams in
the bright sun. The planter lives in a
style that comports only with wealth,
he is hospitable even to a foe, and prides
himself on the lavishness of his hospitality.
He is always a student, keen and alert,
especially on the affairs of the Pacific.
Every home has its splendid library, well
stocked by handsome volumes in English,
in French, as well as in German. The
wails are often covered with picturesque
maps crowded with details of information,-
and every library shows its map of
Australia. These maps attract the eye
at once, and the mind marvels at the
thoroughness of the German in his hunt
for information and at his cleverness in
setting it forth.
A volume taken at random is almost
sure to be, nine times out of ten, some
work on Australia or the Pacific. The
illustrations will be strikingly true and
beautiful, illustrations of cities, of
minerals, of peoples, of birds, fishes and
animals. The brightly-coloured maps will
show every length of railways, even to
the most recent extensions, carefully ruled
in with red ink, with such particulars as
mileage, agricultural, mineral, and pastoral
value estimates also plainly written in.
Coast lines of this map of Australia\will

show distances, soundings, and many
minor details usually omitted in any
English map. There is no possible doubt
but that Germans in German New Guinea
know Australia as few Australians do.
Rabaul
The capital of German New Guinea, in
its compact completeness of every modern
convenience, its natural beauty of harbour
and island scenery that surrounds it, its
ornate public buildings, the elegant and
comfortable-looking private bungalows,
its magnificent botanical gardens, origin-
ally planned and managed by an expert
gardener, especially sent out by the
Kaiser himself from one of his own
palace gardens, its cool avenues, every
street with a different kind of tropical
shade tree, the whole picturesque and
pleasing, and compelling admiration for
German town planning, were it not that
all too truly records tell that to give
this elegance and comfort to the officials
who surrounded the German governor,
proclaiming him almost a royal repre-
sentative of the All-Highest, native life
was squandered in a way only possible
to a callous German mind and heart.
The capital is ideally situated. Had
not official calculations failed as to the
promptness of the movements of the
Australian Navy, it could have been, at
the moment of the declaration of war,
made so secure by mining the waters of
King George's Sound as to make approach
tedious and extremely difficult. Rabaul,
the home of the officials of the German
administration, was the rendezvous of
the wealthier planters and traders of the
territory, and stories are told of orgies
that would sound impossible to British
ears. For instance, this little town, for
its couple of hundred of officials, and its
three or four hundreds of occasional
visiting planters and traders, supported
no less than twelve houses of prostitu-
tion, each house containing from twelve
to twenty Japanese women ; while drink
was so cheap that it may be said to have
flowed like water. The'favourite sport of
drunken German officials or planters was
to madden with drink the unfortunate
natives, especially the native women,
and then to abuse them in a manner un-
publishable.


In these days of Australian administra-
tion, Rabaul is a town famous for its
cleanliness and its good character. It
is now the centre of a busy commerce,
as well as an energetic military adminis-
tration.
? Queen Emma?s? Romantic Reign
As far back as reliable history goes,
these islands comprising German New
Guinea attracted many interesting people,
and none more so than the half-Samoan
lady popularly known as ? Queen Emma.?
Her proper name was first Mrs. Forsayth,
and afterwards, as the wife of a handsome
young German official, Mrs. Kolbe.
But no title suited this energetic woman
better than that of ? queen.? She had
a commanding personality, was strikingly
handsome, with charming manners, and
gifted with most remarkable business
ability. It was this gift which soon
brought her immense wealth and promi-
nence.
She practically owned at one time
islands in extent more than a dozen
times the size of the British Isles. As a
trader coming into direct and personal
touch with the natives, over whom she
had some magic influence, for mere
sticks and boxes of tobacco she acquired
thousands of square miles of islands, and
then, utilising her power over the natives,
began planting coconuts in immense
areas ; these are to-day yielding in full
profit hundreds of thousands of pounds
a year.
The plantations run along the island
foreshores for many, many miles. Her
vast trading and planting interests eventu-
ally were bought out by the German New
Guinea Development Company, in which
the Kaiser is one of the chief shareholders.
? Queen Emma ? from the first
championed the rights of the natives;
her kindness for them made her beloved
by them, and her memory to this day is
enshrined in their simple hearts. She
bitterly opposed the coming of the Ger-
mans, and especially, when they did
eventually take possession, resented their
extreme cruelty to the natives. The
story is told, and confirmed by the
Germans, that her spacious bungalow,
with its ample and beautiful grounds, was
declared ? Tambu ? (meaning in native
language forbidden) to any German.
This edict held for many months, and,
to the credit of the German officials, they
respected the lady?s wishes, however
much they missed her generous hospi-
tality. This home still stands, furnished
in the most sumptuous manner, but it is
closed pending a dispute over her will.
A year or two prior to the war ? Queen
Emma ? retired to Germany, and she is
said to have been received in the highest
Berlin society. Her great wealth, which
she displayed in many ways, particularly
in boundless charities, attracted even
the patronage of royalty.
Romantic as had been her life, tragic
was her death just as the war began.
She had an agreement with her young
husband, specified in her will, that should
she die first her wealth was to pass to
him and his relations; should he pre-
decease her the wealth was to remain in
her family. While on a short holiday to
Monte Carlo, Mr. Kolbe suddenly died,
and an hour later his wife dropped dead.
Their bodies were cremated and the ashes
taken and laid beneath a handsome tomb,
on the spot of seashore of New Britain
where thirty years before ? Queen Emma ?
first landed and did her first deal with the
natives.
Missionary Ventures
The protection afforded by ? Queen
Emma ? to missionaries, especially English
missionaries, encouraged much missionary
work in the time previous to the coming
of the Germans to New Guinea. The
Germans slyly had at all times, wherever
they settled or took possession in the
Pacific, stirred up every species of annoy-
ance to discourage the missionaries, par-
ticularly English and especially Aus-
tralian workers. In the Rev. Dr. George
Brown, of the Methodist Mission, the
Germans found a masterful man who
fearlessly exposed all their designs, and
confronted German officials in a way that
demanded attention and often gained
redress for trouble ,and loss of property
seized by German traders. Dr. George
Brown died only last April in Sydney,
N.S.W., a very old man, but it was he
who forty years ago continually warned
the people of Australia as to the meaning


of the Germans coming into the Pacific,
and his predictions have in every case
come true.
Missions of all kinds are numerous in
German New Guinea in these days, and
every one, according to German law, has
to be registered as a trading company,
such as the Roman Catholic Mission of
the Sacred Heart, which is known as
" The Sacred Heart of Jesus Trading and
Copra Company.? They are more or less
flourishing, though it is exaggeration, as
the Australian Administration has proved,
to say that any of the missions, while to
a certain extent trading and planting,
are profiteering beyond the necessities of
their mission work.
The Occupation of German New Guinea
When the history of this war comes to
be written, the gallant deeds of the
Australian naval and military forces in
taking possession of all German terri-
tory in the Pacific will occupy pages
full of brave actions, skilful management
and leadership. Much heroism was dis-
played against great odds, and a well-
protected enemy had every advantage.
To this day the road to the wireless
station, a wild jungle all the way, may
rightly be described as an avenue of
bullet marks, for every tree of any size
along the route of the fight is gemmed, as
it were, and thickly, with bullet marks or
bullet holes. How the brave Australians
fought their way, and with so little loss
of life, is hard to imagine ; they did, and
they reached the wireless and destroyed
it ?a splendid up-to-date apparatus it
was, too, that ha 4 kept the German
ships of war aware of every turn of the
Australian Navy and so allowed them to
get away in safety, fortunately to be
caught later on by English ships.
New Britain is literally trenched from
end to end along its coasts. The trenches
are still to be seen, but only in one place,
Herbertshohe, are there graves of our
brave Australians. Short and sharp was
the work of our soldiers, mostly mere
lads ranging from 19 to 22 years of age.
Protected by the guns of the Australian
Navy, they made quick headway, and in
less than a few weeks German New Guinea
was under Australian administration.
Australian Administration
The Germans of German New Guinea,
especially the officials, foreseeing the loss
of the territory out of their hands,
maddened by disappointment and rage,
engaged in a stupid destruction of their
own property. The tunnel, a wonderful
enterprise, that leads from the south to
the north of the island of New Britain,
the famous north coast as it is called, and
where are many large plantations, was
blown up, under the foolish apprehension
that it would block the advance of the
Australians. But Australian leaders are
resourceful, and the unexpected happened.
The German governor suddenly decided
with his prominent officials to flee to the
mountains, to the volcanoes of the
? Father and Sons,? some twenty miles
out of Rabaul, and there, with much
money in hand and all papers and official
documents, await the return of the
German warships who by wireless had
promised help. These code messages
were intercepted and by a shrewd guess
correctly interpreted, and instead of
needing the tunnel road, some five hundred
soldiers landed on the road to Toma, the
health resort of German New Guinea, and
instantly heard from the natives of the
flight of the governor.
Within two days the governor was run
to earth in the mountains, some three
miles from Toma. He was found with
two officers hiding in some bushes. All
presented an unshaven and pitiable ap-
pearance. This ended the efforts of the
Australians, for immediately a general
surrender took place, but to this day the
Germans have not forgotten or forgiven
the ignominy of the capture of their
governor.
Chaos unimaginable of revenues and of
trade for many months gave the new
Administration an endless and tiresome
task, and it was not until Sir Samuel
Pethebridge, K.C.M.G., an Australian
Civil servant of high administrative ability,
was appointed Administrator that this
chaos was restored to order. At the
present time, as showing the skill of the
Administrator, the revenues have more
than doubled, every old avenue, with
many new ones, of trade have been
opened up, and there is a general pros


perity that even commands admiration
from the Germans themselves, who openly
admire the new conditions and their
success.
Nowadays this tactful Administration
is responsible for the smooth working of
all departments, but especially for the
good behaviour of the Germans them-
selves, who wisely refrain from conflicts
with the Administration. However, oc-
casionally, in some of the remote parts
of the islands, and where supervision by
Australian officers is not permanent,
planters, traders, and now and then
German missionaries, stir up trouble
among the wilder natives by telling them
that ? British he no good, German he
plenty good, and one day German he
come back, and all same kick British
fellow out of country.? These offences
have resulted in many Germans being
sent to the internment camps of Australia
for the period of the war.
The Public Flogging
One incident of the days of the occupa-
tion it is necessary to tell, if only to
exemplify German untruthfulness. A
well-known missionary, the Rev. W. H.
Cox, has lived and worked in German New
Guinea for nearly twenty years, and for
his manliness and good commonsense
was popular even with them. While on
a visit to an isolated mission station at
the south end of New Ireland, a German
doctor, and some planters who were in
the neighbourhood, seized Cox and, under
the excuse that as a Briton he had been
giving certain information to the new
Administration, they flogged him in a
most brutal fashion. On the report
reaching the Administrator at Rabaul,
soldiers were sent out to bring in the
offenders, who adopted cowardly tactics
by seeking the protection and help of
the natives. Eventually they were cap-
tured, and as a reprisal were publicly
flogged in the square of Rabaul, in the
presence of any Germans who cared to
attend, and the soldiers, but not, as was
said in the German Reichstag, in the
presence of the natives. The natives
were ordered out of the town for the half-
day during which the sentence was
executed. While this flogging was not
altogether to the liking of the Minister of
Defence in Australia, it has to be admitted
that it put an end to all the hopes of
rebellion that were from time to time
springing up and worrying the Administra-
tion.
Undoubtedly, in spite of its limited
powers, the Australian administration has
in every way proved its usefulness. There
is one feature that is as interesting as it is
convincing. It is the fact that since an
Australian judge sat in the General Court
of Rabaul there has been more and more
litigation between Germans than in all
the previous years of German rule. In
the most open and frank manner the
Germans tell how their own judges acted
more under the impulses of sentiment,
influence, and corruption than with any
sense at all of justice. Germans in
German New Guinea to-day, if they
dislike the Australian administration, are
honest in their admiration for British
justice.
Medicine and Sanitation
Another feature of this worthy adminis-
tration which reads like fiction is the
magnificent work of Colonel Dr. Strang-
man, the chief of the administrative
medical staff. This officer was on the
ill-fated Maiunga, which was caught by
the raider Woolf some nine months ago
when on its way from Sydney to Rabaul.
Supported by the Administration, Colonel
Strangman waged war on the mosquito
and the resulting tropical malaria. The
most drastic regulations for sanitation
and the laws governing health were
enforced, much to the distaste and anger
of the German settlers, who were accus-
tomed to neglecting cleanliness, especially
where the natives were concerned.
In all centres, plantations, trading
stations and missions, notices were posted
up as to the proper means of combating
tropical diseases, and heavy fines and
punishments followed on carelessness.
Gangs of natives under Australian soldiers,
especially trained, inspected households,
noted the state of outhouses, the freedom
of roofs and spouting from leaves and filth,
tanks and all water holders were most
carefully covered, and water on no account
allowed to lie exposed, not even in tins
for the drinking water of fowls ; these had
to be covered in certain sheltered parts
of the fowlhouses.


The thousands of trees that make up
the refreshing and beautiful avenues of
Rabaul streets are constantly examined
for any grooves or crevices which might
hold even one drop of water, and these
are instantly cemented up. Drains any-
where are never allowed to hold water, but
are swept and flushed daily or, if neces-
sary, hourly.
The results are wonderful, and it is
only a question of time when this island
territory, at any rate where the population
is, will be quite free from malaria. Already
the standard of health throughout is
notably high, including Chinatown in
Rabaul, which in the German time was a
hotbed of contagious diseases. The
Administration has too set itself to the
enormous task of treating the sick natives,
and native hospitals completely equipped
are to be found in every island under
qualified doctors and nurses.
The slavery imposed upon the natives
by the Germans, and the harsh treatment
meted out to them, account for the
appalling amount of sickness that prevails
among the natives. They are dying out
very rapidly. Islands that once claimed
large populations of say tens of thousands
have dwindled down to mere hundreds,
and it is to cope with this direful state
the Administration has set to work with
great perseverance and energy, and with
every prospect of success.
The natives are pleased with their
change of masters, that is those who are
indentured and who understand, and the
remark is often heard from them ; ? Ger-
man he no good, no want him.? Never-
theless British freedom goes to the other
extreme, and the natives, taking advan-
tage, are showing signs of being pampered
with disquieting results. A strange fact
is that pidgin-English was used all over
the territory by the Germans in speaking
and dealing with the natives.
One instance of this queer talk, pictu-
resque though it seems, will suffice to
show how absurd it really is. A native,
on seeing a man play a piano, expressed
himself so : " My word big fella, white-
fella master, fight em teeth (notes) along
big-fella boxis (box), and my word big-
fella boxis he plenty sing out,? and a
native houseboy will ask you at table
if you will have ? Su-su (cheese) all the
same good smell,? or ? Su-su all the
same stink ? (Stilton or Limburger).
From the latest returns it is gathered
there are over 400,000 natives in the
German territory over which the _ Aus-
tralian Administration presides, while in
that portion under guidance
there are some 60,000, that is in the
Carolines, the Marshalls and the Marianne
groups. These German New Guinea
natives are intelligent and should, under
careful, wise administration, be eventually
a great working asset to the territory.
This scattered island territory com-
prises Kaiser Wilhelm s Band the large
slice cut off British New Guinea, the
Bismarck Archipelago-groups of large
and small islands, in great number,
dotted over a vast expanse of sea. Then
come, some hundreds of miles away, the
fine islands of the German Solomons;
nearer the Equator is the small island of
Naru, the island of phosphate, and the
richest island in the whole world. Above
the Equator are the Carolines, the , Mar-
shalls, "and the Marianne groups, alto-
gether of many hundreds of thousands of
square miles.
When the war is won it will be Aus-
tralia?s chiefest concern to see that the
German, in power and possession, is
ousted from the Pa.cific. There is a
commercial future of the greatest impor-
tance in German New Guinea. All the
plantations of coconut, of rubber and other
tropical products are many of them now in
productivity and profit, hundreds of
others are coming on every year, the
trade with Australia has sprung from
thousands of pounds to millions, and so
the prospects are of the brightest.
History fails to show that these rich
islands came into German possession by
satisfactory means, but records plainly
and forcibly declare that German New
Guinea was chosen not for its commercial
prospects, but as a jumping ground for
German naval and military forces in
acquiring in the future the whole of the
islands of the Pacific. The Australian
Administration in the last three years
has brought out the splendid com-
mercial advantages of the territory, and
this certainly entitles the Commonwealth
to first say in regard to its future owner-
ship.

The following survey is the fourth of a series of articles on the official
organisation and utilisation of salvage , and is based upon information courteously
placed at our disposal by the authorities.
BY the courtesy of the War Office I
was permitted to visit one of the
military towns which have come
into being with the war Some-
where in Britain, to follow the whole
process of salvage and to determine with
my own eyes precisely how the Army is
striving to reduce wear and tear upon the
taxpayer?s pocket.
Four plants are already in full swing
at this camp, which is one of the largest
of Tommy?s Timber Towns in the country,
stretching as it does for mile after mile
over bracing rolling upland. Funda-
mentally the four plants are identical,
although they are divided into two broad
classes to meet different requirements.
The one may be described as' the " per-
manent ?? model, while the other coincides
with the description ? portable,? inas-
much as the essential sections are of such
design as to permit of easy dissembly,
transport, and re-assembly at another
point. But the processes of saving are
common to all.
Such a camp as this, housing as it does
tens of thousands of men, with its serried
rows of barracks laid out in streets- some-
what after the American geometrical city
planning system, may be likened to a
pretentious town. On its fringe we halted
before a building which had originally
been erected for some specific military
purpose, but which had long since been
relieved of its designed duty, and had now
been converted into a Swill-mill. Not
that the transformation had been a costly
matter, seeing that expense had been con-
fined to the installation of the requisite
simple machinery involving an outlay
of not more than �2,500.
A number of motor lorries such as are
retained at every camp for the fulfilment
of odd transportation jobs, were trundling
with their loads of kitchen refuse
