THE
CULTIVATION OF LITERATURE
IN AUSTRALIA.
Perhaps I owe some apology for an ambiguity
in the title of this address. In case anyone has
been drawn here by false expectations, I make
haste to explain the situation, so that he may
incur no further loss of time.
I do not propose to describe or to discuss the
past history of literary production in Australia.
I have no intention of reviewing the works of
Gordon or Kendall or Marcus Clarke*. Of that
sort of disquisition there has been rather more
than enough. Moreover there exists a volume
treating of ? The Development of Literature in
Australia ? by my friends Henry Gyles Turner
and Alexander Sutherland, Personally I make
no claim to be an authority in that field. One
may have read the best of our Australian work in
poetry and in fiction, enjoyed it, and endeavoured
to see it in its true perspective?that is to say,
have tried to estimate without prejudice its in-
trinsic value in the way of thought and art and


style?and yet one need not undertake to pass any
sort of creditable examination in details concern-
ing the contents of Australian literature and the
biographies of its writers.
This does not come of indifference. It comes of
the fact that the libraries contain such an embar-
rassment of literary riches of the highest quality,
such a wealth of poems, histories, and essays of
universal and everlasting value, in French, Ger-
man, Italian, Latin, and above all in English
and in Greek, that, if one is to make the most of
one's opportunities, there is little time left to
devote to a minute study of work which falls
unquestionably below the highest. No one here
with any pretensions to literary culture, or to a
grain of the critical faculty, will feel hurt at this
distinct assumption that no Australian author
has yet attained to anything like an equality
with the greatest writers in the literatures to
which I have referred. We have, of course, pro-
duced nothing remotely approaching a Homer or
Thucydides, a Virgil or Livy, a Moliere, a Goethe,
a Shakespeare, a Milton, or a Carlyle. The Pan-
theon of literature contains as yet no divus Aus-
traliensis.
lam anxious not to be misunderstood. There
are, it is true, certain passages of Kendall which
are not inferior to the very best passages in, let
us say, Swinburne. This may not be the highest
possible praise. We may go further, and claim
that his best passages are not unworthy of any
poet who has written in the English tongue. But


this fact does not make the works of Kendall
equal to the works of Swinburne, still less equal
to those of Keats. Marcus Clarke's one great
novel presents quite as masterly workmanship as
certain novels of Balzac. But such a concession
does not declare it equal to Pere Goriot, nor make
its author the equal of the Frenchman. When we
say that the literary Pantheon contains as yet no
Australian divinity, we do not say that Aus-
tralia is unrepresented in the ? separate seats ?
of the heroes. We are only distinguishing the
gods of creative genius from the writers who are
simply men of notably higher stature and rarer
powers.
Let me now complete my apology. The
student of literature cannot afford to spend long
hours with Adam Lindsay Gordon while Byron or
Burns must wait ; he cannot be learning Kendall
by heart while Catullus and Hugo and Keats are
left neglected ; he cannot be reading and re-read-
ing The Man from Snowy River , while Homer
has still so much to delight him withal. He will
of course read, more than once, whatever strikes
him as interesting, forceful, touching, in these
writers of the Southern Cross ; but he will hardly
say that he is making a study of them, taking
them into his daily life and thought and all his
spiritual existence. When they deserve such study
through their intrinsic wealth of ideas, poignancy
of touch, reach of imagination, richness of
humour, splendour of style, then he will rank
them among the pieces de resistance of his mental


food. At present we will thank them for com-
paratively light, if very welcome, refreshment by
the way.
The past of Australian literature lies, there-
fore, beyond our scope ; ? Behold, is it not
written in the book ? of Turner and Sutherland ?
It is, however, pertinent to our theme ?which is
that of the future of Australian writing ?to make
one observation at this point. It would be well
for a Society bearing this special name to ponder
well the acknowledged fact that the strongest
volume of Australian poetry and the strongest
work of Australian fiction were created when our
resources and population and importance in the
world were considerably less than they are to-day.
The same is, no doubt, true of Shakespearian
England as compared with the England of the
eighteenth century ; or of the Great Britain of
Scot/t and Byron, as compared with the Great
Britain of 1902. It is obvious that a country
does not necessarily make progress in literature
because it makes progress in numbers, in trade,
and in material bulk. There is something quite
different which lies at the root of literary and
artistic creation ; and it is with the fostering of
that something that a body like this, making the
literature of its country the object of special zeal,
is most vitally concerned. If my talk to-night
has any particular text, it is that you should go
straight to causes before you expect to improve
results.
It will be apparent that I am assuming for


this Society a lofty purpose corresponding to its
title. Had the Australian Literature Society,
like some societies we have known, been merely a
mutual admiration and alleged mutual improve-
ment society, of which the members read dilet-
tante papers at each other, and between them
worked up a factitious interest in literature of
sorts, I could not have hoped to contribute any-
thing particularly welcome to such a body. Not,
of course, that there is anything more to say
against such pleasant reunions and coteries than
against musical evenings and other entertain-
ments. But from the title which it adopts, and
from the inaugural address of the President, it is
plain that the society intends to take itself and
its work with a proper seriousness.
We are to gather that its object is practical,
and that it is twofold. Its first aim is presum-
ably to advance the quality of Australian litera-
ture, or, in other words, to promote the cultiva-
tion of literature of classic rank in Australia.
Its second object is naturally to secure, as far as
in it lies, a fair hearing for efforts of Australian
writers, whenever such efforts are judged to
possess distinct and demonstrable merits.
Now the effective carrying out of both these
aims depends upon the same thing, namely, the
establishment, both within and beyond the So-
ciety itself, of a correct standard of criticism, of
sound literary judgment, free from provincialism,
unembarrassed by local prejudices. Unless it
grasps and applies such a standard of criticism


the Society will achieve nothing beyond its own
amusement. The deficiency in self-reliant Aus-
tralian criticism is at present glaringly manifest.
On the one hand the poetaster is sometimes be-
lauded in terms which would be by no means
niggardly if applied to a Shelley, and, on the
other hand, work of exceptional merit often re-
ceives the most grudging recognition until it has
been stamped with the hall-mark of London ap-
proval. Personal likes and dislikes may, no
doubt, have something to do with the matter ;
the smaller and more compact the community, the
more these are in evidence ; but the chief cause of
this miscarriage of justice is, beyond doubt, to be
found in the lack of a sufficient force of sane and
reasoned criticism existing in our midst. Does the
Australian Literature Society propose to gird up
its loins and fit itself for the nucleus of such a
steadying force ? Will it lend all its strength to
a frank and single-hearted, but withal competent,
judgment of Australian production in verse or
prose ?
There are those to whom such a programme
may seem rather cold-blooded. Let us make
answer that, not only is the most cool-headed
criticism of literary form and thought compatible
with the most intense enjoyment of all that is
really beautiful or otherwise admirable in such
form and thought, but the fullest and keenest
delight derivable from such beauty comes only to
that mind which can be trusted to discriminate
between the yellow which is gold , and the yellow


which glitters, between the brilliant which is a
diamond and the brilliant which is only paste.
I shall attempt nothing beyond throwing out
a few suggestions. They will concern true stand-
ards of criticism ; they will also concern that
desideratum in Australian life which must be
forthcoming before we can hope to make any con-
spicuous mark upon the literature of the wide
world. And by ? literature ? we shall mean crea-
tive literature, the literature of feeling, imagina-
tion and invention, not mere books*?not what
Lamb calls biblia abiblia, ? things in books?
clothing,? such as works of description, of mathe-
matics, of science, dictionaries, and the like.
Against the production of this 1 class of writing
there is nothing in our way except our stingy
recognition of original research ; but against the
production of literature in the proper.sense there
is a subtler demon to be reckoned with.
As for true standards of criticism. In the first
place, it appears needful to impress upon Austra-
lians the truth that literature ? depends for its
value upon its intrinsic strength and worth, upon
the height, depth, and rareness of the thought or
imagination and the excellence of the style, and
not upon any sort of deliberate local characterisa-
tion. Over and over again one has heard the
remark that Australian literature ought to be
distinctly ? Australian,? that it should ? smack
of the soil,? that it should be pervaded with local
colour. The remark is, doubtless, true, even to


the point of truism ; but, as a doctrine for the
guidance of Australian writers, it too often re-
ceives a most mischievous application. It is true
in so far that, if any Australian has genuine
ideas and feelings to express, or mental pictures
to impart, and if his sole and single-hearted pur-
pose is to communicate his mind and heart to his
fellowmen, embodying in words just what he sees
and feels, he will inevitably, from time to time,
betray the influence of his Australian environ-
ment, will unconsciously borrow something from
the aspects and moods of Australian climate,
scenery, and brute nature, from the circumstances
of Australian life and occupation, from Austra-
lian ideals, aspirations, and moral tone. The
style is the man ; the man is largely the reflex of
his surroundings ; and in the style will appear?
spontaneously, I repeat, and unconsciously?
something of the special character of those sur-
roundings. So far it is true that genuine Aus-
tralian literature will smack of the soil, will be
distinguished by local colour. That colour, how-
ever, is a local accident, not a local aim, and it
has essentially nothing to do with the question
whether the literature produced is good or bad.
But, unhappily, the accident that there is local
colour in the best Australian writers has led the
mere imitator, the secondary producer, to imagine
that such local differentia is the very salt of
originality. He not only decorates, but he goes
out of his way to decorate, his page with the
wattle and the gum, with the magpie and the


kookaburra, with the swagman and the boiling
billy, and with all the other orthodox properties
of the bush. There can be no mistaking the fact
that the writer is Australian ; there can be no
missing his local colour, which is hung upon the
canvas with such an obtrusive brush, but?there
comes the main question after all?is it literature?
What is it all about ? What does it tell ?. What
does it picture ? How does it move us in our
intellects or in our spirits ?
A skylark sings to Wordsworth upon the
Cumberland Fells. It sings to Shelley by the
Thames or by the Arno. It might sing to one of
us on the Buffaloes, or by the Yarra Yarra. To
the heart and imagination of Wordsworth the
song of the lark is fraught with certain sugges-
tions ; to the heart and imagination of Shelley it
conveys a series of exquisite moods and fancies.
What does it convey to us ? What we are looking
for, what we find, what interests and charms and
moves us, in Wordsworth?s or Shelley?s Ode, is the
rich thought and fancy embodied in exquisite and
melodious expression. We are not caring where-
abouts the poet saw and heard the songster.
There is virtue in the poem which appeals to
every human being, who, in any part of the
world, has heard the morning or evening min-
trelsy of the skylark. The prime value of litera-
ture lies precisely in that cosmopolitan, that uni-
versal, response which such poems irresistibly
evoke. Now let our poet of the Buffaloes or the
Yarra Yarra deliver his message also ; let him


body forth in exquisite expression and music
some new series of feelings and imaginings which
the experience calls forth in him. The rank of his
production will depend, like that of Wordsworth
or Shelley, solely upon the rareness in the quality
of that which he utters, and upon the complete
mastery with which he utters it. There is no use
in his dragging in the Australian vegetation, or
descanting on the grandeur of the Buffaloes, or in
any way branding the work with ? made in Aus-
tralia.? The Australian vegetation and the
grandeur of the Buffalo peak will come in of
themselves if they have any natural bearing upon
the thought, any organic connection with the feel-
ing. In all likelihood they will have no such con-
nection as to make it necessary to name them or
particularise them, any more than with Words-
worth it was necessary to specify the neighbour-
hood of Helvellyn or the aspects of the heather-
clad fells. So far as the peculiar surroundings of
atmosphere, of vegetation and landscape, have
anything to do with the matter, it will be
through the unconscious influence in which they
steep the poet?s mind. They will form one factor
in determining the poet?s mood, of melancholy,
joyfulness, pensiveness, receptivity. In such and
such a place, amid such and such surroundings,
the poet is disposed in such and such a way ;he
becomes I?allegro; he becomes il penseroso. We
need not doubt that the very same man, in the
same state of mental and bodily health, would
listen to the skvlark with some subtle difference of


humour, according as he heard it among the
Cumberland dales, by an Italian river, or in the
Australian bush. That difference might, perhaps,
colour the suggestions which the song would call
up in him. But that of which he would write, if
he were a true creator of literature and not
merely a man of the pen, would be the sugges-
tions themselves. That the trees around were the
Australian gum-trees, that the peak before him
was the Australian Buffalo, wotild be facts of the
minutest moment. His reader is fellow-man,
European, American, or what not, not merely
fellow-Australian, to be tickled into spurious ap-
preciation by the assurance that the scene is laid
in his very own parish, that his country is, after
a] l, important enough to be actually advertised
in ? literature.?
lake another case. The writer of the higher
fiction, like Walter Scott, conceives the notion of
a certain story. He designs its general architec-
ture and develops the necessary characters, who
play their parts in the several incidents amid the
necessary surroundings. He may place the scene
in Scotland, as with Guy Mannering. Thereupon
his characters become Scottish types, they em-
body Scottish ideas, they talk in Scottish idioms,
his scenery is Scottish. He may choose an Eng-
lish mise-en-scene, as in Ivanhoe. Thereupon his
characters become Norman nobles and Saxon
thanes and churls ; they embody Anglo-Norman
ideas of the feudal period ; the scenery is English.
But that which makes Scott a classic novelist.


that which made him, and still makes him, read
abroad, is not his descriptions of scenery, whether
English or Scottish ; it is not his quaint Scottish
or old English idioms ; it is his mastery of the art
of story-telling, an art which includes, first, the
skilful management of complex plot and incident
and episode, so that all progresses to some grand
climax or catastrophe ; and, second, the creation
of human characters. The art of the truly classic
novelist, apart from his style, in the end reduces
itself to this?the life-like creation of a world of
imaginary people, whose characters and actions
so interwork as to lead naturally through strik-
ing experiences to effective issue. The scenic set-
ting and the local colour are accidents of the
choice of the subject. They in no sense them-
selves make the work of art.
Let us now come to fiction produced in Aus-
tralia. Like some of the work of Scott, of
Thackeray, of George Eliot, it may not deal with
the writer?s own country at all. It may deal with
England, Ireland, America, Italy, or the desert of
Gobi and Shamo. It may, on the other hand,
deal, like Robbery Under Arms, with men,
names, and scenes Australian, and Australian
alone. In either case the world of readers will
not judge at all by the mise-en-scene. The
reader will not read and re-read a book, and pass
it on to his friends, because it is full of topics
Irish, or American, or Australian, but because it
is a capital story, full of life and verve, full of
pathos, or full of humour, well-constructed and


developed through the agency of characters ad-
mirably drawn. He will, of course, expect that, if
the scene is laid in Spain, the characterisation
shall be Spanish and the descriptions true to
Spain ; if it is laid in Australia, he will make
similar demands. So far, and so far only, does
local colour enter into great fiction. It is again
an accident of veracity ; it is not a chief aim,
still less can it be the raison d'etre of a novel.
And yet one has not to look far in order to dis-
cover Australian stories in which it appears as if
the writer s sole endeavour was l to depict Aus-
tralia, to emphasise, so to speak, the Australian-
ity of things Australian, by dragging in as much
Australian bush, as much Australian flora and
fauna, Australian occupation, Australian idiom
and slang, as could be forced into the otherwise
rather motiveless page.
Here again, as in the previous illustration, it
is essential for high production that the writer,
Australian or not, should first and foremost have
some narrative to tell, that he should conceive
his world of imaginary characters as playing their
parts in it, and that he should, if an Australian
dealing with Australian things, let his local
scenery and local idioms come in of themselves,
because they must, and not because he will. The
writer who says, " Go to, I will make this char-
acteristically Australian/' is practically deserting
novel - writing for guide - book - writing and descrip-
tive sketches.
What really matters, what alone makes litera
ture of the first rank, is its universal element, the


element which touches and interests all men at all
times and everywhere. The Iliad was composed
thirty centuries ago somewhere near the shores of
the Aegean Sea. It is written in an old-fashioned
far-off Greek, and deals with the legendary wars
of a semi-feudal, semi-barbarian civilisation. But
its interest is as keenly felt by us as by those
primitive Hellenic feudalists for whom it was
composed. In later democratic Athens, amid ab
its art and philosophy ; in Imperial Rome, amid
all its artificial splendours and luxuries ; in the
keen curious days of the Renaissance in Italy,
France, and England ; in these modern, somewhat
world-weary, times of all European societies, the
spell of Homer upon mankind has been equally
great. And to what is that spell due ? To
nothing else but the clear vision and clear pictur-
ing of the poet ; to the supremely simple skill
with which he seizes upon and touches off the ever-
lasting essentials of character, of generosity,
shrewdness, valour, irascibility, and the rest, and
also the everlasting essentials of eloquence and
passion which go with such characters. Add,
moreover, a faculty of grasping and bringing out
in luminous words the very core and essentials of
any scene which passes before the outward or in-
ward eye, and a faculty of hitting upon a simile
of incomparable brilliance and simplicity. We
realise, as we read Homer, that the passions of
his heroes, as displayed in word or deed, are those
belonging to the great heart of all unsophisticated
humanity ; we feel, moreover, that the Homeric


description itself is the acme, the ne plus ultra,
and, at the same time, the irreducible minimum,
of perfect expression. It is these things which stir
our pulses and enchain our interest. It is not the
quaintness and foreignness of the Achaean age, its
manners, and its morals, its armour and other
externals. Of these we should soon weary. Those
are the local colour of Homer, freely but unthink-
ingly imparted by him for no other reason than
that it was the colour among which he and his
characters lived and moved. But for all time since
Homer, and for all time to come hereafter, his
charm lies in the perfectly administered touch of
nature which makes all people akin.
In the same way Sappho of Lesbos is an im-
mortal classic, because, though she wrote in a
little Grecian isle twenty-five hundred years ago,
she appeals to that undying elemental passion
and pathos of love which clamours for the satis-
faction of verse and melody in one generation as
vehemently as in another, and which is so inex-
haustible that a Catullus can still arise after a
Sappho, and a Burns after a Catullus, and still
leave room for an endless series to arise after
Burns. There is local colour enough in Sappho,
the colour of Lesbian roses and the tones of
Lesbian mythology ; but it is there accidentally,
simply because out of the fulness of the heart the
mouth speaketh, and the heart of Sappho was the
heart of a woman penetrated with all the teach-
ing�? ideas, feelings, and natural surroundings of
Lesbos. But she is ? the tenth Muse ? because


her poignancy is poignancy for every generation
of the race.
The supreme quality in literature is like the
light of the sun and moon and stars. It is
something which is shed upon and understood in
all lands alike ; none can claim it as its own. It
is shed equally upon, and felt alike in, all the gen-
erations.
It may be answered that great art has always
had its ? schools,? which are generally identified
with nations or local seats. There is, for in-
stance, Greek sculpture, and Italian sculpture ;
Greek architecture, Moorish architecture ; classical
art, Japanese art ; Italian painting, Dutch paint-
ing ; Italian music and German music. But this,
if you examine it, is quite a different matter. You
cannot speak in these cases of local colour ; the
difference is of quite another sort; it is one of
artistic principle. ? Italian ? painting is so-
called because it is, or was, the method of paint-
ing cultivated by the Italian maestri, the prin-
ciple of painting as understood by them ; not at
all because it depicted specially Italian subjects,
or emphasised things, persons, circumstances and
scenes Italian. The characteristics of ? Dutch ?
painting is not that it depicts things essentially
Dutch, but that it depicts what it does depict
with a minute realism, as if the essence of art lay
in such particular veracity. You might be a
Russian or an American, and yet belong to the
Dutch school, even if you painted objects and


situations which were never seen in Holland, but
which belonged only to Moscow or to Chicago, as
the case might be. Greek sculpture is not the
object of a special admiration because it is
typical and illustrative of a certain country called
Greece and a certain civilisation called Greek ;
otherwise why do we not show an equal rapture
for Indian or Chinese idols ? It represents a
special principle in plastic creation, the principle
of absolutely simple, and therefore supremely
difficult, representation of nature in its full per-
fection. It makes no point of representing forms
peculiarly Greek, but only of representing, with-
out trick or emphasis, forms which are ideally
beautiful. Moderns who attempt the same task,
no matter in what country, and no matter what
model they choose, are disciples of the ? Greek ?
school.
The Greek and the Italian, in all their artistic
work ; the Japanese in his portrayal of flowers
and birds and sprays of plants ; these set out with
one object?the endeavour to create in visible
form to the best of their mastery. They do not
say, ? I must be Greek, Italian, or Japanese,?
but simply, ? I must create with strength and
beauty something in which I perceive beauty
worthy of my best expression.? Their method of
using the chisel or the brush may differ ; their no-
tions as to what is strong and beautiful may
differ ; and therein, and therein alone, lies the so-
called national difference of their art. Ido not
mean to deny that the difference between Greek


life and Italian ?the difference of race, of climate,
of manner of public and domestic life, of religion,
of moral ideas ?that these, however unrealised,
produce a divergence in aesthetic notions and per-
ceptions. lam only concerned to point out that
what the great artists do not do, is to differenti-
ate themselves deliberately for the sake of dif-
ferentiation, by representing such things as desig-
nate, not to say advertise, their own country.
Apply this canon?for it is equally applicable
?again to literature. In great literature there
may be schools, such as the so-called ? classic ?
and ? romantic ? schools, answering to the
Greek and ? Gothic ? schools of architecture,
and the ? realistic ? school, answering somewhat
to the Dutch school of painting. A particular
country may favour one of these schools rather
than the other. Thus France and Italy, the neo-
Latins, adhere rather to the alleged ? classic
England and Germany, the neo-Teutons, to the
? romantic/ although, no doubt, there are dis-
tinguished exceptions in each nation. Their re-
spective ideas of what is strong and beautiful in
literature, strong and beautiful in substance or in
expression, are at some variance. This, and this
alone, differentiates French literature from Eng-
lish or German, so far as the artist?s intention is
concerned. It is, meanwhile, natural and inevit-
able that a Frenchman?s writing should be per-
vaded with references to things recognisably
French, and an Englishman?s with references to
things recognisably English ; but this comes of


nothing but the fact that a literary scene must be
laid somewhere, that the characters must be of
some nationality, and that in the main a writer
is writing for the people who speak his own lan-
guage. The national element, that is to say, is
an accident.
If we ever have an ? Australian ? school of
literature, it will not be because of the fauna and
flora and geography and idioms of Australia
which may be introduced. These make nothing in
art, nor in a school of art. They do not deter-
mine whether the art is good or bad, whether it is
of this school or the other school. It will be be-
cause our Australian atmosphere, our national
life, occupations, religious and moral ideas, have
inevitably and unconsciously created in our eyes
and hearts and intellects some difference in our
way of regarding things, so that we perceive
strength and beauty and pathos in some new
light, and adapt our representation thereto.
I hat is to say, it will be ?if it ever exists l ?an
Australian school because it betrays some
peculiar way in which Australians contemplate
life and nature.
My first moral then is this : Abandon all de-
liberate quest of local colour as an Australian
mark. If you know how to write, and are writing
with perfect sincerity of what the eye really sees
or the heart really feels, you cannot fail to intro-
duce just as much pure Australian quality as


good art demands. Let us step for a moment
outside ourselves as Australians, and imagine
that we are reading some of that earlier American
literature ?and there was plenty of it?which
seems to revel in the consciousness that it is
American, insists on the vastness and charm and
novelty of things American, appears continually
to be crying with loud voice, as if defying contra-
diction, that America contains things to be
written about no less interesting, if not a good
deal more interesting, than those of the effete old
world. What do we, from the outside, think of
that spreadeagle sort of ? local colour ?? Do we
not, as a matter of fact, regard it very much as
we should regard an assertive young man who is
not quite sure of his position, not quite certain
that he is yet accepted as grown-up ? James
Kussell Lowell, an American to the backbone, but
an American who understood literature, had no
sympathy with this localising spirit. He thought
little, he said, of that kind of writing which lost
half its value as soon as it got out of sight of
the village steeple. Such writing stamps itself as
provincial.
There are, it is true, two kinds of the pro-
vincial. The one is the truculent or bumptious
provincial. The other is the shy or servile pro-
vincial. At present we are concerned with the
aggressive variety. In American literature it was
once conspicuous. The writer seemed to be al-
ways taking the tone of the traveller who assures
you at every moment that ? we have quite as


good as that at home.? And we answer, with
the lady in Dickens, ? who?s a-denigin? of it ??
An Emerson or a Lowell found no necessity to
clamour in that way for a place in literature ;
neither do the majority of those transatlantic
writers who, at the present day, are spending so
much literary skill upon the fiction which appears
to be crowding the productions of Britain from
the field. Of American colour they naturally have
plenty, simply because their scenes are laid in the
Adirondacks, or New York, or Kentucky ; but it
is obvious that their concern has been to tell the
story of an adventure, a passion, or a develop-
ment of character, and that the thought ? this is
an American novel?we want the world to know
that it is American,? has not occurred to them
any more than it would have occurred to Thac-
keray to say, ? I must be very English,? or to
Balzac, ? I must be conspicuously French.?
Literature loses one element of provinciality as
soon as it becomes unconscious that it belongs to
a province.
But while we avoid Scylla, let us not fall into
Charybdis. There is another sort of provincial-
ity > the shy, humble, imitative provincial.
Literature and art may be afraid to be honest and
independent ; and I apprehend that it is a con-
sciousness of our own occasional timidity which
is, in reality, responsible for the cry that Austra-
lian literature should exhibit the Australian note.
But, as we have seen, that manner of expressing-
ourselves may lead to false notions as to local


colour, and may occasion those artistic blunders
which come of unnecessary self-assertion. Let us
rather express our maxim in the negative form,
that Australian literature and art must not be
nn- Australian ; that they must not be false to
that which their creator, as an Australian, does
actually and honestly see and feel ; that they
must not substitute something which the literary
tradition of some other land ?particularly, of
course, the home land of Great Britain ?has al-
most hypnotised us into feeling, despite ourselves.
There can be no pretence, nothing secondary and
imitative, in great literature ; it must come
straight from the heart, the eye, and the intellect.
Perhaps we may illustrate from the history of
painting in this country. Some few years ago
there was an exhibition of Victorian art in the
rooms of the National Gallery. It contained
works of the older order of immigrant artist and
also works of the newer school of native or al-
most native Australian painters, men who may
for a while have sojourned for technical equipment
in Paris or elsewhere, but men who are in every
other sense our own. I am not prepared to oiler
any verdict concerning the technical execution of
these works respectively ; but one feature of the
exhibition was too palpable to be missed. In the
older painters the atmosphere of the Australian
pictures was certainly not Australian ; the lights,
the tints, the distances, were not Australian ;
they were European, and even northern European.
Even in the canvases of Chevalier this defect was


manifest. Compare these with the productions of
the younger and native artist, and it became evi-
dent that the one set of painters were reproducing
what they had learned to see in other lands, and
only fancied that they saw in this, while the other
set were endeavouring to convey frankly through
the brush that which actually encompassed their
Australian life. They did not go out of their way
to emphasise the special Australian notes ; if they
did, it were bad art ; they were being simply true,
as far as their skill could command truth, to the
presentation of what they could perceive in the
way of natural strength and beauty.
If our pictorial artists had but copied models
from abroad, and had persisted in giving us at-
mospheres and lights and tints of vegetation
which were European and not Australian, our
painting would have been of the order of the
humble and servile provincial. Happily in the
domain of painting we are now free of that re-
proach.
There are, unhappily, many domains in which
we are not free of it. Look at our houses and
other buildings, often ridiculously unsuited to the
climate and to the conditions of our life. Why do
we borrow the plans and specifications of the
London suburbs, or of New York ? Not so much
because we lack architects of capacity, as because
the whole community combines in the gigantic,
stupid pretence that our climate is the same as
that of England?no great thing to be proud of,
I, as an Englishman, regretfully admit. It is the


same with many absurdities of dress, food, and
ways of life, and with a multitude of other ex-
hibitions of obsequiousness to the social over-
lordship of Great Britain. We are afraid to be
comfortable and picturesque for fear of being
? Australian and therefore we remain uncom-
fortable and unpicturesque and provincial and
false to ourselves.
In Australian literature there has been some-
thing of the same kind. Writers have not always
frankly recognised the differences between our
young, incomplete, and democratic conditions and
those of the old, luxurious, and still partly feudal
conditions of Great Britain. They have even been
rather timorous about recognising such simple
facts as that our summer is the northern winter ;
that Christmas and Mayday here have nothing in
common with the English Christmas and Mayday
except the name ; that our constellations do not
include Charles?s Wain and the Polestar ; that
here the nightingale does not warble at eve when
all the woods are still ; that we have no green
copses in which the modest violet sheds dainty
perfume, and where the rathe primrose forsaken
dies. Once more, there is no sort of need to force
continually upon the reader the fact that these
things are different with us ; but, on the other
hand, it is only a consciously derivative, and
therefore insincere, literature which will cultivate
the contrary suggestion by lapsing into meta-
phors and similes derived from Charles?s Wain and
the nightingale and the woodland primrose.


When the native-bred Australian indulges in
figures of speech which involve references to the
nightingale and the snowdrop and the like, he is
drawing upon literature, not upon nature ; he is
borrowing the vision of English writers, not tell-
ing us his own.
We need not say that Australian literature is
conspicuously provincial in this matter of second-
ariness and servility. Nevertheless, frequent
traces of adaptation to an English and non-Aus-
tralian condition of society, to English and non-
Australian astronomy, landscape, climate, and
calendar, are to be found in a search through
writers who are manifestly lapsing into mere con-
ventions. If then ? let our literature be truly
Australian ? means eliminate all such imitations
as these, the appeal is to pure and simple reason.
There occurs to me one cardinal illustration of
the superiority of writing which is frankly true to
its environment, over writing which adapts itself
to some external standard. That example is the
work of Burns. So long as the Ayrshire poet
wrote naively like a Scot, of things palpable in
his own Scottish world, his verse is mostly be-
yond praise ; it carries the unmistakable stamp
and the irresistible charm of genuineness in feel-
ing, fancy, and expression. But as soon as Burns
attempts to say things as he fancied the higher
literature ought to say them ; in other words,
tries to envisage and phrase them in the style of
a classic English writer, he becomes artificial,
frigid, and flat. Not even a perfervid Scotchman


will draw his claymore upon me for this piece of
candour.
This, then, is an indispensable principle of our
criticism ; the principle that literature is good in
virtue of a certain intrinsic quality which is
separable from all local considerations. It is the
expression of fine or lofty thoughts and imagin-
ings, of fine or lofty feelings, in the language
which most vividly and beautifully expresses
them. And no literature can possess this quality
which does not come direct and single-minded
from the writer's heart and brain. He must have
nothing else to consult, beyond that fitting of
absolute expression to genuine thought or emo-
tion ; on the one hand, no notion whatever of
forcing into notice any special local circumstance;
and, on the other, no complaisant regard for the
local circumstances of any other land. In these
two respects the writer must have entirely freed
his soul. The question with him is not, ? What
would this have suggested to Tennyson or to Eng-
lish genius ?? nor-, ? What should this suggest
from an Australian point of view ?? but simply
and unreservedly, ? What does this suggest to
me?"
Next I would press upon this society, and
upon Australians in general, the injury which may
be done by too fond a study of Australian
writers, even of the best. Let us admit at once
that our writers in prose and verse have, like our


painters, taught us to see beauties and to feel
suggestions in our Australian environment which
we are all the richer for seeing and feeling ; that
they have shown us latent values and resources
lor joy in things wherein we ourselves should have
missed them. This is one chief function of a poet
whether he be verse-poet like Kendall, or
prose-poet like Macdonald ; namely, to open
our hearts by revealing to us new glimpses
o Kden and new emotional impulses in
our surroundings ; glimpses and impulses
or which our own perceptions have been
too dull or too preoccupied. For my own part J
gratefully acknowledge that I have found in the
verses, prose, and paintings of Australians my
first promptings to many a fresh sentiment of
beauty and delight discoverable in the Australian
orests, on our hills, and by our shores. In the
manifesto to the Lyrical Ballads it is the de-
clared aim of Wordsworth and Coleridge to
awaken the mind's attention from the lethargy
of custom, and to direct it to the wonder and
loveliness of the world about us," sources of i oy
which are ever present, but by which our very
familiarity makes us pass with eyes that see not
and souls that do not understand. The most
beneficent reaction of art is that it opens our eyes
to the beauties and glories shed richly through all
nature. Our Australian poets and idyllists have
done much for us in this way. At present
this is, perhaps, their chief claim upon us. What-
ever they have lacked in reach of imagination and


in seer-like gifts, in original penetration of
thought and eternal importance of matter, they
have at least performed most thankworthy service
in ? awakening the mind?s attention from tie
lethargy of custom, and directing it to the won er
and loveliness ? of the Australian world about us.
Nevertheless it is possible, through too de-
voted a study of even this laudable work, to do
injury to ourselves. In the first place, we may be
woefully cramping our horizon ; in the second, we
shall be apt to look for ever at Nature through
the eyes of these writers, instead of beholding her
frankly through our own.
Our horizon will be cramped. The existing
literature of Australia, after all, touches life and
nature at but a few points. It deals with but a
small portion of the interests and activities of this
trreat universe. The proper study of the literary
student is, as Matthew Arnold has expressed it,
? the best that has been thought and said in the
world,? anywhere and at any date between
Homer and this present year of grace. Put to-
gether all reputable work whatsoever that has
been written in Australia, and how little does it
embrace of all that men have believed in, hoped
for, aspired to ; of their visions and ardours and
ecstasies ; of their reasonings, ponderings, and im-
aginings ; of their discoveries in beauty and
wisdom ! In how few even of the domains of
mere literary art does it offer examples worthy
for our models. We cannot afford to be missing
all the rest." Everyone knows the danger of in-


and-in breeding. The result is that faculties be-
come limited to the point of idiocy. If there is
one tendency against which we should in this
isolated corner of the world be particularly on
our guard, it is the tendency to feed upon our own
scanty larder of ideas and forms. By all means
let us read our Australian writers with sympathy
and with adequate pains, but " life is short, and
art is long/? and the time which we afterwards
devote to these should be proportioned to their
sterling value when weighed against the massive
genius of Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe.
I fear I may be charged with preaching at this
Society from an unwelcome text. If so, permit me
to quote the words of another who cannot be so
accused. Listen. ? Why not transplant to this
Australian soil, and there ' study ' it, the purity
the simplicity of the diction of the verse of
Matthew Arnold ; the insight and directness of
Thomas Carlyle ? Why not Homer ? Why not
Omar Khayyam ? Why not some of those
sublime passages in the Old Testament-Job and
Isaiah ? Shall we not by so doing ? encourage '
authors and authorship ? Shall we not so de-
velop Australian literature in the manner in which
it can be best developed ?? Those are excellent
words, and they were spoken by your own Presi-
dent, when he was delivering his inaugural ad-
dress to this society.
our e ow?� We laTUlflh & " Wad � f thrOU S h
e snail yield them an exaggerated


deference. Marcus Clarke imagined the dominant
note of Australian landscape to be ? a weird
melancholy.? How much parroting has there
been of that phrase by people who have them-
selves neither sought for the dominant note nor
had it irresistibly borne in upon them ! How
many people have approached the Australian
landscape in what Wendell Holmes calls a state o
polarisation, prepared to perceive the weird
melancholy,? searching for it when they did not
feel it, and ultimately convincing themselves that
they are really at one with the opinion o an
authority so high. The fact is that the impres-
sion was true for Marcus Clarke, a being wo,
despite all his unbridgeable differences from
Samuel Johnson, resembled that sage in this, that
his principal joy of existence lay in the town
amid the socialities of that Bohemiamsm which
once haunted the coffee-house and now haunts its
less Arcadian analogues. So far as X can gat icr
of a man whom I never knew, he would have
agreed with Johnson that Fleet Street is better
than Tempe. It was natural that the solitudes
and silences of the Australian bush, as of any
other bush, should strike a man of this tempera-
ment as ' melancholy, and should impart the
creepiness of the ? weird.? But, says Carlyle,
the eye sees in things only what it brings the
capacity for seeing; and, after all, sympa eic
descriptions of nature, emotions and intimation
springing from nature, represented whether by
poet or by painter, are a blend of nature she
is and of the temperament through which she is


seen and felt. To Gordon the Australian at-
mosphere suggested no melancholy, but the inhal-
ing of a large and liberal air which stimulates
like a deep draught of wine ; the Australian land-
scape calls up the golden gleam and floating fra-
grance of the wattle betwixt shadow and shine.
To each of us, whether we live habitually in the
country itself or pay it but holiday visits, the
landscape suggests very much what our own feel*
ings and our own experience make it suggest.
There are as many manners of what is called
interpreting nature ? as there are human beings
to interpret her. The first duty, or rather the
first inward urgency, of the Australian writer who
has any real claim upon the world, is that he
should simply feel and interpret for himself, with
no eye whatever 19 what Marcus Clarke has said,
or Gordon has said, but, as our modern Aris--
tarchus insisted, with his eye upon the object.
And this he will do with fullest confidence only
if he has steeped himself in the best literature of
all the world, realised the infinite variety of the
point of view, the infinite number of facets to
every object of literary contemplation, the possi-
bilities of sublime boldness in original perception
and fancy ; if, in short, he has realised that the
essence of literary greatness lies in the consum-
mate expression of absolute sincerity in original
paths of thought.
I have, perhaps, said enough, if not more than
enough, concerning the erection of a standard of
criticism, so far as it can be created by means of


literary study. It is for the members of a
societv like yours to promulgate this doctrine,
and to practise it ?that the study of literature
should be a study of the very best, a broad and,
as far as may be, a cosmopolitan study. They
should have in their mind?s eye, as the audience
and critics of Australian literary production
which the world will not readily let die, not the
average man in the Australian street who runs
while he reads, and has no time to wait, but an
audience such as is described in Longinus On
the Sublime.? After speaking to hisi Greek
readers of the effect of models like Homer, Demos
thenes, and Plato?just as one might speak of the
effect of studying Shakespeare, Burke, or Ruskm
jn illumining the path which leads to lofty
standards, and in kindling the soul to emulation
of their greatness, he goes on to say, Still
better were it, if we were further to adopt this for
a guiding principle : ? Tf I had uttered something
like this, and Homer had been present to listen,
or Demosthenes, how would it have struck him ?
Or what would they have thought of something
like that ?? For truly it means a high effort to
assume for one?s own deliverances a tribunal and
an audience so august, and to make believe that
we have to face such demigods for our judges,
when we are rendering an account of ?what we
write. More stimulating still, if you were to
add, ? If I were to write this, what hearing should
I get from all ages to come ?? But if a man be-
gins by being afraid of uttering something which
out-ranges his own life and time, the conceptions


of that man?s soul must be crude, blind, and still-
born.?
And this brings me to something which it
would have been more pleasant not to have had to
say. There is in the present ideals and social
tone of our Australian life a lamentable deficiency,
which renders the prospects of the higher litera-
ture among us very remote. Genius, no matter
how great, is not independent of its environment.
As the plant needs the kindly soil, the rain and
sun and air, before it can flourish and blossom
forth, so the literary or artistic genius requires
for its full development the benign influences,
promptings, incentives, of an environment which
has lively sympathies, if not something approach-
ing a passion, for art and literature. Why do
you suppose that Massachusetts, with Boston for
its centre, was so long the one literary State of
America ? Are we to believe that there was no
potential literary genius in Philadelphia, or New
Orleans, or New York ? Why was Athens the one
city in Greece which could be trusted to be pro-
lific in drama, philosophy, history, oratory,
sculpture, architecture ? Was there always a
dearth of great writers in posse in the other lead-
ing Greek cities, Sparta, or Corinth, or Argos ?
Why was it Florence to which belonged so many
of the great Italians, while opulent and populous
Naples, Milan, Venice, even mighty and eternal
Rome, fell into the rear ? Are we to imagine that
there was some peculiar dispensation which con-
tinually placed a special quantity and kind of
brains in the head of the child who was lucky


enough to be born in the city of the lily ?
Literature and art have always had their con-
spicuous centres, and those headquarters have not
necessarily, though of course they have been fre*
quently, the richest and largest capitals ; take
Weimar to the contrary, or take Boston. Nay,
do not merely take certain places ; take periods
instead. Why do first-rate writers and first-rate
artists appear commonly in groups, for the most
part heralded by some form of revival or renas-
cence ? Let us acknowledge that only one Shake-
speare is to be expected in a thousand years ; but
why, surrounding him, are gathered Spenser,
Sidney, Raleigh, Marlowe, Bacon, Hooker, Ben
Jonson, and the rest of the galaxy? Why with a
Moliere do we also get a Corneille, a Racine, a La
Fontaine ? Why in Germany do we get a Goethe,
a Schiller, a Heine, side by side ? It were ob-
vious to put the same question concerning every
country which has produced a literature.
The answer is simple ; it is incontrovertible.
An outburst of great literature is like the thunder-
storm and its lightning-flashes. It is the meeting,
the explosion so to speak, of all the electricity of
thought and feeling which has been collecting and
pervading a society. Thoughts, imaginations,
emotions, aspirations, which extend around the
individual and include him, find in the literary
genius a special gathering-point. To adopt the
Frenchman?s phrase, ?he possesses, more than
anybody, that which everybody possesses.? It is
his to realise what others feel but vaguely or in-
completely ; while the rest are dumb or struggl-


ing to articulate, it is he who finds the clear word
and voice. Apart from his own inborn genius,
nay, because of his inborn genius, he is a focus, a
centre, to which there congregate the whispers,
the little echoes, until they swell into that which
Victor Hugo claimed to be his metier, an ? echo
so nore." In no generation is there really want-
ing a liberal supply of genius, or, at least, of
talent near to genius. There is always more than
one mouthpiece forthcoming as soon as the world
is eager to find voice. Shakespeare may soar and
overtop his brethren, as Goethe did his, but, as
it has been well said, those transcendant geniuses
are but the highest peaks, the Mont Blancs, be-
side which you will always put a Monte Rosa, or
a Matterhorn, or other giant Alp. Hence do
literary epochs stand out boldly on the chart of
history.
This is not the place?and, if it were the
place, the task would require a week?to demon-
strate the special causes why, in each given place,
and at each given date, great literature arose,
while in other places, or other times, great Pan
seemed dead. But the result of such demonstra-
tion would inevitably amount to this, that great
literature springs up where it fit audience finds.
From a society in which thought is material,
worldly, shallow ; a society of which the doctrine
is nil admirari; a society which has no interest to
spare for things that do not c ? pay which treats
sentiment with cynicism, and ideals with con-
tempt?from a society of such a kind there may
be writing, but there can be no literature. The


literary genius who is born into it is frozen from
his childhood up ; the tendrils of his finer aspira-
tions are nipped and blighted ; his education is
narrowed upon the stale lines of so-called prac-
ticality ; his capacities and energies are perforce
directed into non-literary and non-artistic
channels ;heis a great writer lost. A Medicean,
an Elizabethan, a Periclean child was born and
bred in another atmosphere. He was drawn into
an ardour for high and acute thought and beauti-
ful expression, into a love of fine and delicate
emotion, into a stimulating worship of ideals.
Every gift in him that made for literature was
fostered and developed. Even minor ability was
driven to exceed itself.
Now I am not implying for an instant that
this community of ours is wilfully committing all
these crimes of cynicism and contempt of litera-
ture and art. That would be an intolerable
calumny. But it is beyond the questioning of any
one but the untravelled or unread or blindly
chauvinistic Australian that, outside what are
known as politics and business, the standard of
thinking, of conversation, of interest in things of
the mind, is far lower than should be the case
with a community which claims to be in the front
rank of civilisation. The causes are not far to
seek. Our primary instruction ?of which under
new direction there are better hopes ?has been a
narrow, mechanical, payment-by-result, fact-and-
process-grinding system. There has been no real
place in it for the idealising and reverential side
of humanity, for the training of the higher emo-
tions and sensibilities. Literary education has


consisted of a little miscellaneous reading of the
sort which hardly begins to be literature. The
great mass of the people have been somehow
drilled, somehow instructed, as if this country
were Philistia and the Dagon of material well-to-
do-ness its jealous idol ; but they have not been
educated in the plenitude of the heart and mind,
in what Matthew Arnold calls ? all their powers.?
Sympathy for great literature or great art has
hardly ever been implanted or encouraged in
them. The wonder is that so many are found to
possess it. The secondary and higher education
is no better, and it runs a risk of becoming even
worse. The cry for an improved technical educa-
tion and commercial education was, no doubt,
necessary ; the people who first raised it doubt-
less knew what they meant by it ; but it is rapidly
becoming a meaningless clamour of a mob, which
threatens to lead to disastrous consequence.
Long ago there was a tyranny of education in
thoughts and words, as if life began and ended
with grammar, logic, pure reason, and theology.
There grew up the claim, temperate and rational,
for education also in ? things,? in the science of
the animate and inanimate world. This, in turn,
was established, and the two sides of instruction
went on together. Little by little the lower side
of the science of ? things,? the side which was
novel, and which ? paid,? began to grow pre-
dominant ; it has also been growing obstreperous
and intolerant, almost in its turn denying any use
to an education of pure intellect, taste, and senti-
ment. One would sometimes think that the
primary reason why we live lives, and form


our civilised societies, is in order to study
machinery, or germs, or the effects of mixing two
gases. Of course the great and original scien-
tists have no such notion as this ; they are always
serene and broad-minded types of humanity. But
their minions, their parasites, uncultured and
narrow, are countless and loud and domineering.
But now springs up a newer doctrine, that, beside
true and genuine ? education ? in both things and
thoughts, there should be technical instruction,
instruction in processes of the hand. This, too, is
good ; but, in their turn, the proposers of it are
being followed by their unintelligent minions,
their apes, and parrots, who distress their leaders
by exalting technical and commercial processes
into the first place in the educational scheme.
More and more the sympathies of the rising gen-
eration are in danger of being shut off from
literature. It is amazing how coldly educational
proposals are received when they concern only the
improvement of the culture side of humanity, and
with what glib and mechanical acquiescence they
are accepted when it is hinted that they may
possibly have a remote bearing upon turnips or
sheep-dip.
It may be argued that all modern commun-
ities are just now tending too much in this direc-
tion, and that we here only represent the natural
exaggeration of materialism which is to be ex-
pected in a small and young society. The plea is
hardly true, but, even if it were, our business is
to keep our own doorstep clean ; the business of
an Australian Literary Society is to look after the
interests of literature in Australia ; it is not - to
acquiesce in and follow possible lapses elsewhere.


And, as a fact, in Great Britain, in France, in
Germany, in America, there is at all times a very
large remnant, among whom may be found ele-
vated tastes, a lofty conception of writing, a
severe standard of criticism, thinking, and con-
versation. We, too, have our remnant, but it is
disproportionately small. If it were greater, we
should assuredly produce higher work in litera-
ture. For native talent is not wanting ; I believe
it is plentiful. As for native literary ambition, it
is simply pathetic in its abundance. I remember
on one occasion the Chief Justice of this State
declaring that alleged poetry was shot down at
his door by?l think he said?the cartload. In my
less exalted, but still somewhat exposed, position,
I perhaps receive it by?let us say?the barrow-
load. Most of it is trivial, not to say doggerel.
But now and again there is work of pronounced
merit, sent, as is mostly the case with good work,
with the greatest modesty. The instinct for writ-
ing is, beyond doubt, widespread among us, and
beyond doubt a distinguished poet or prose-
writer in posse is frequently going to waste. He
goes to waste for the reasons I have assigned ; in
the first place, because his.literary training has
been neglected, and even discouraged in youth ;
in the second, because he has subsequently steeped
himself too much in inferior literature, and too
little in the great literature of the world ; in the
third, because the intellectual stimulation of his
environment is of what the physicians call low
vitality. The current notion appears to be, that
to meet for serious conversation is to act the prig.
As a fact, the prig is only the intellectual pre-
tender, never the ardent intellectual aspirant.


If this society wishes to achieve anything
practical, I do not see what better it can do than
keep a watch upon the tendencies of the commun-
ity towards a hard and parrow materialism, put-
ting forth its energies to counteract them and to
advance the humanities. It might throw any
weight it possesses into strengthening the hands
of those who plead for more literature, more
poetry, mors biographies of heroes and the like
in the schools, more recognition of literature in
the University, more recognition also of import-
ant literary movements. It should celebrate, and
join other bodies in celebrating, great literary
occasions and great literary men.
Perhaps you may say that it will be numeric-
ally too small to achieve much. Then let it en-
deavour to become large, not by simply filling its
subscription list, but by a sort of crusade, which
shall find out, and incorporate in the head so-
ciety and in its branches, all the personnel which
makes for good literature throughout the-Federa-
tion.
If it fails in this, there is one thing in which
it need not fail, namely, in the equipment of its
own members for a higher standard of literary
criticism and literary enjoyment ; and this it can
secure by rejecting all triviality, slovenliness, and
cheapness from its discussions, and by studying
continually the best that has been said and
thought in the world. When the social environ-
ment itself provides no stimulation, then one can
go to his library, of which Emerson says that
there you will find ? a company of thei wisest and
wittiest men that could be picked out of all civil
countries, setting in the best order the results of
their wisdom and learning/'
