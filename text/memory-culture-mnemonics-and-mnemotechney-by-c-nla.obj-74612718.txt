TESTIMONIALS BY WELL-KNOWN COLONISTS.
Melbourne:
WM. T. PATEB & CO., Printers,
271 Little Collins Street.


Mr. Jones knows the value of time, and therefore he has selected a
few brief and emphatic testimonials which will induce you to read
further and join his class. The system will satisfy you beyond question.
It has never failed.
The Government Printer, Robt. T. Brain, Esq., a gentle-
man well-known through all these colonies, wrote in January
iBq6 to Mr. Tones : ? I have had your system of Memory Cul-
ture .... since November last, and I have much
pleasure in saying, that your process for the development of
natural memory, bids fair to eclipse any other method with
which I have had the opportunity to become acquainted.
Heartily wishing you all the success you deserve in your ex-
cellent work, I remain, dear Mr. Jones, yours very truly.?
The widely-known and deservedly respected Chairman of
the North Melbourne Bench, Dr. Lloyd, M.D. and J.P., writ-
ing on the 20th instant, says ; ? Having procured a copy of
your excellent Class Book, and diligently studied its contents,
I am able to express a most favourable opinion of the methods
and merits of your system of Memory Culture, as it has already
proved itself extremely useful to me, in my professional pur-
suits, as well as, in the various other daily concerns to which
I have to attend.?
The Secretary of the Melbourne Total Abstinence Society,
Thomas Ferguson, Esq., writing on the 15th mst. says;
? Having studied your system of natural Memory Culture, and
heard your lectures on the same deeply interesting 1
have much pleasure in recommending the system as a valuable,
or I might better say, an invaluable aid to any person having
a defective memory.? It will hardly need to be said, t at
defective memories are very largely the rule in daily hie,
among all classes and professions.


PRACTICE OF MEMORY CULTURE.
ALMOST every person possesses memory, and most persons
are capable of Memory Cultivation in greater or lesser
degree. It is to urge memory culture that Mr. Jones? classes
are formed, and this little publication is intended to bring
under your notice, a few testimonials from eminent citizens,
declaratory of advantages found in the study and practice of
his system. Memory is the most precious and wonderful
faculty possessed by the reasoning brain. Under proper
training, supposing the brain of usual power, it is capable of
assimilating whole libraries with the precision of sun-painting,
observed in the best photographs. Not only can the printed
page be assimilated, but it can be recalled with measurable
certainty, and yet the natural power, too long left to chance,
is still, only in process of development.
To assure the best results of Memory, it is only necessary
to bring a healthy vigorous young brain, to the recognition of
current events, under conditions favorable to attention, and
the features of a conversation, the points-of a debate, or the
pages of a book, will be printed on the convolutions of that
earnest juvenile brain, as certainly as either event could be
recorded by a short-hand writer. To restore Memory at any
age, it is only requisite to recur to the child-like conditions
already indicated.
The impressions of youth remain to the last moments of
life?s glorious' chapter. Shakspere, whom Milton calls,
? Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame,? and of whom Ben
Jonson sang; ?He was not of an age, but for all time; ?
Shakspere noted the enduring power of early ideas, in the


article of death, when he described the last moments of the
veteran : ? His nose was as sharp as a pen, and ?a babbled of
green fields;? That enduring power is not necessarily con-
fined to the brain impressions of childhood and early youth.
The vigor of juvenile impressions, maj? be allied by culture
with the ripest capacities of the matured intellect, and the
purpose of Mr. Jones? Class Book on Memory Culture, is to
show in daily life, that the intellect, so long as it retains its
healthy powers of concentration, can preserve within its cells
and convolutions, efficient records of each remarkable incident
in its chequered career. That is the substantial secret of
Memory Culture.
The express object of this little brochure, is to offer'to in-
quiring minds a few of the numerous testimonials that are
daily accumulating, .setting forth the pregnant fact, that the
method which Roger Bacon promoted in the thirteenth
century, when he rescued from oblivion the Mnemonics of the
ancient world, in Roman and Grecian memories, then current
in the minds of a few, has been in part accomplished in this
supremely scientific age. Among hundreds who might bear
witness, there are but few who will accept the responsibility
which attaches to those who tell what they have realised. The
few who will permit their winged words to be published, are
.thanked most heartily, for the friendly and truthful evidence
they have so kindly given.
Dr. Maloney, the Liberal Member for West Melbourne,
one of my earliest pupils in this colony, wrote in November,
1895, as follows ; ?I must compliment you on your system of
Memory Culture. I have knowledge of five different systems,
and I gladly admit that I have received great benefit from your
method. The new views you have placed before me I have
proved valuable, and your Class Book is of great value to me.
Memory Culture is so important, and the need to pursue the
best system only so obvious, that I regret that I had not the
advantage of your interesting work from the first. Unlearning
wrong methods is always hard, I can honestly congratulate


you on the interesting characteristics of your book and on its
research. With your long experience in public life, I know
no person more capable of the efficient exposition of a system
of Memory Culture than yourself. Yours faithfully.?
The originals of all my testimonials are preserved.
Mr. R. horbes Young, of Hobart, Tasmania, says: ?I
write to thank you for the manner in which you have made
plain to me your Memory system. I always considered that
I possessed more than a fair memory, but I had no idea that
it could be strengthened to such a remarkable extent in so
short a time. Be sure that I shall follow out your instructions.
The power of concentration with which you seem to have en-
dowed me, by the presentation of your Memory Culture (for
which I shall ever feel thankful), has even at my somewhat
advanced stage of existence, been a source of gratification.
Wishing you health and strength to benefit many others, as
you have helped me, I am yours sincerely.?
The Hon. L. L. Smith, whose skill as a Medical Practi-
tioner, and whose energy as a public man, forms part of the
history of Victoria, writing on the 27th of February, 1896,
says: ?Having examined your system of Memory
and also had opportunities of cursorily studying the systems'
taught by several others whose methods have come under my
notice ; I feel it a pleasure to state, that so far as my judg-
ment goes, I can safely recommend your teaching 'to any
person requiring such assistance. Yours truly.?
Mr. H. R. Harwood, whose status as an actor has made ?
his name a household word in these colonies for many decades,
having given his time and attention for some weeks to the
study of Memory Culture under my system, writes to say :
? Your system of Memory Culture properly applied, will ren-
der it easy for any one possessed of average brain power, to
commit a part with certainty and speed ; and I feel assured
that your methods of operation will become popular. Very
truly yours.?
Mr, W. B. Rodier, J.P,, one of the oldest and most res-


pected Territorial Magistrates in Victoria, writing from St.
fames? Park, Hawthorn, in the latter part of February, 1896,
says ? ? Your Memory Culture meets one of the greatest needs
of the dav, and I thank you for its suggestiveness. Ihere is
a great field of usefulness before you, which I hope you will
speedily fill. If your own prompt and comprehensive Memory
is in any respect the result of your system, as doubtless it is ;
then it is the most successful 1 ever witnessed. I remain, dear
Sir, yours most sincerely.?
Having thus placed before you a few of the numerous
testimonials received from gentlemen well-known throughout
these colonies, with the express understanding that they
might be used as they are now being employed ; the matter
may safely be left to your own judgment to determine,
whether you can afford to neglect a system of Memory Culture
so well vouched for, as having accomplished excellent results
If your memory is defective in any respect, it can be brought
up to its full measure of efficiency, at a mere bagatelle of
expense, compared with the service to be rendered, if you put
yourself in the hands of Mr. Jones on the simple condition
that you concentrate all your powers under his direction to
that desirable end. Nothing can be done without your zealous
co-operation, seeing that ?We work by wit and not by witc
craft.? No labor, and no skill in the teacher can avail unless
the student throws all his energies into the task which must
be wrought for his manifest advantage.
The secret of Memory Culture is mental concentration
which does not run in harness with the blind dependence on
Mnemonics, which some unwise so-called memory trainers
advocate and apply. Concentration means closest attention
for limited terms, until the brain has acquired impressions
which must endure, so long as grey matter retains its vitality.
That living picture cannot be secured, unless the scenes
events and words have had for a time, exclusive possession of
human faculties. A fanciful writer who wished to assist the
purposes of a wealthy Professor, said: ? I used to read almos


without ceasing, during all my waking hours, and everything
I perused sank into the recesses of my brain I suppose, but I
could never recall a word of all that vast treasure, until I had
recourse to your system. Never a syllable came back from
that bourne, until you came to my rescue. Your method of
tuition, seems to have installed an electric light in the cavern-
ous recesses before mentioned, where my brain carried on a
kind of storage, but the result is all that could be desired. I
can now thanks to your admirable system., find everything in
my memory that I gathered there in the remote past, and I
thank you with effusion.?
Psychologically, that is an absurdity. Doubtless it served
the purposes of the Professor who used it with the unthinking,
but it disclosed utter ignorance of the ascertained laws of
memory. Systems of Memory Culture can only throw light
on the records of the past by the association of ideas, which,
under favorable conditions, will recall the most trivial incidents
as well as the most important; but the question naturally
arises as to the best means for awakening such associations.
Without such natural powers brought into action, no light,
whether electric or meteoric, will affect the mental crypts
where grey matter keeps watch and ward. Memories of child-
hood are indelible, because the brain in our earlier days was
capable of becoming engrossed without an effort with compar-
atively small and trivial affairs. The presence of innumerable
cares in the adult brain, is answerable for later distractions,
and that fact must weigh with teachers as well as pupils. The
trainers of memory must find means to recall the childlike
earnestness, which belongs as of right to our earlier days.
The chief aim of those who would cultivate will
customarily be addressed to the improvement of the fibre of
the brain. You raise the grade of strength in rowers, walkers,
or cyclists, by active and continuous exercise ; and the brain
will benefit by similar methods of operation, adapted to its
needs. Each successive event, under better conditions thus
induced, will write itself in the muniment cells of the mind,


without conscious effort; and association of ideas will readily
bring forth all that is known from ? the vasty deep,? which
is within our daily reach. Meaningless talk about electric
lights in the brains cellarage, ought not to deceive the merest
schoolboy. Lesions or softening of the brain may put the
sufferer beyond the magic of memory ; when no imaginable
light will avail. Concentrate your attention on the matter in
which you are for the time interested, permit nothing to divert
your mind from the task undertaken, until thought, as well as
the senses, shall have grasped the incident; and that memor)?
humanly speaking, will be established. There need be no
fear after that, that a healthy brain will suffer lapses of
memory, any more than healthy and well formed eyes will
fail to see. Association of ideas under such conditions will
alwa)?s ? call spirits from the vasty deep.?
The brain can readily recall ideas and impressions, which
it has properly assimilated and made its own; but mere suc-
cessions of sights and sounds, to which no vigorous attention
has been given, will no more be remembered than the visions
of the night. Poor Mrs. Dombey was almost worried to death
by her sister-in-law,. Mrs. Chick, with demands that she should
? make an effort,? and all nature makes a like demand under
better conditions of life, on ever)? member of the human family
at every stage of existence.. The daily and momentary demand
of nature is effort. Fulfil that condition in the operations of
the brain, and memory will almost infallibly remain, so long
as health continues. Keep the powers of the mind well in
hand, direct its activities into desired channels, and continue
its operations until the idea has been completely mastered, and
there will be no difficulty about the recall of that mental
effort, with the essential details of the brains action. Earnest
endeavor tells by the deep impression that results. When
such impressions are made, recall becomes easy, and thus the
functions of memory are carried out to their remotest possi-
bilities.


Mr. Jones hopes to have the pleasure of a call from you,.as he can
show that hy Memory Culture you can almost inimitably Increase your
mental power, and find the means to recall at will the records of
earlier days.
The Rev, A. C. Henderson, 8.D., of Beaconsfield Parade.
South Melbourne, writing in February this year, says;
? I have studied your Memory Culture with great pleasure
and profit, finding the system abundantly capable of producing
the best results, in the case of Any. person who gives'it a fair
trial. I feel certain that any one who. puts himself under Mr,
i ; Jones? tuition, will be benefited in many ways, by frequent
intercourse with a gentleman of his great ability and varied
attainments, possessed of such stores of information, and so
capable of conveying- instruction in a genial; humorous and
interesting style.
Mr. Russell Bowdler, of Kensington, writing about the
same date, says; ?It is just two months since I took up your
system of Memory Culture, and I feel bound to thank you for
. the benefits, real and perspective, that have accrued to me
from your assistance during that time. Had the expenditure
involved been three times as great, I should still consider the
advantages I have secured an easily acquired boon. Hoping
that thousands will soon be able to offer yon.the same emphatic
and well-earned testimony, J again thank you most heartily for
yo,ur system of Memory Culture. Yours truly.?
Mr, R. B Patey, of Collins Street, Melbourne, writing on
February this year, says ; ? I am glad to have accepted
the advantages of your system of Memory Culture. In my pro-
fession. where so much depends on memory, it will be at all
times, I feel sure, invaluable to me. Yours truly.?
The Rev. G. D. Lee, writing from The Manse, Cavendish,
just as we are going to press, says: ?Your Memory Culture
?is an invaluable aid, and I shall advise all my young friends
upon this matter.? Mr. Lee is well-known
