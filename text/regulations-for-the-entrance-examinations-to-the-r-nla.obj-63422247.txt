handwriting.
2. Candidates under 19 will address their applications to
attend the examination to the Commandant of the Military

(ii) It is desirable that all candidates before leaving
their places of residence for the place of examination,
should cause themselves to be thoroughly examined by a
competent physician, and by a teacher in good standing.
By such examinations any serious physical disqualification
or deficiency in mental preparation would be revealed. It
must be clearly understood that the informal examination
herein recommended is solely for the convenience and
benefit of the candidate himself, and can in no way be
recognised by the Official Examiners.


4. Commandants of Military Districts will
(a) Inform the candidates in their respective Districts
when and where the examinations will be held,
and the hours of attendance.
(, h) Make all the necessary arrangements for the
medical examination of candidates by Boards of

Boards of Officers to conduct the practical exam-
ination of candidates 19 years of age and over.
(d) Appoint Boards of Officers to supervise the written
examinations.
(e) Arrange for a sufficient supply of all forms, books,
tables of logarithms, and ' copies of these regula-

to the Commandants of Military Districts for issue to the
Presidents of the Boards appointed to supervise the written
examinations. These packets are only to be opened as

If a candidate goes out without attempting the paper,
a 0 is to be marked after the tick denoting his presence,
thus : JO.
If a candidate does not attend for the paper, the word
?Absent ? (or ? Abs.?) should be entered.
It is most important that each separate book or sheet
should bear the candidate?s index number in his own hand-

REGULATIONS FOR THE PHYSICAL AND
MEDICAL EXAMINATION.
1. Candidates for admission to the Royal Military College
of Australia must be in good mental and bodily health, and
free from any physical defect likely to interfere with the
efficient performance of military duty.
2. They will be examined by a Medical Board, and no
candidate will be accepted unless he be pronounced by the
Medical Board physically fit for His Majesty?s Service.
3. The Board has power?
(a) To pass a candidate as physically fit.
(b) To reject a candidate as physically unfit.
4, The attention of the Boards will be directed to the
following points:?
(�) That the correlation of age, height, weight, and
chest girth is not less than that which is given
in the following table:?

(? h ) Measurement of Height?
The candidate will be placed against the standard with
his feet together, and the weight thrown on the heels, and'
not on the toes or outside of the feet. He will stand erect
without rigidity, and with the heels, calves, buttocks, and
shoulders touching the standard ; the chin will be depressed
to bring the vertex of the head level under the horizontal bar,
and the height will be noted in parts of an inch to eighths.
(c) Measurement of Chest
The candidate will be made to stand erect with his feet
together, and to raise his arms over his head. The tape
will be carefully adjusted round the chest, with its posterior
upper edge touching the inferior angles of the shoulder-
blades, and its anterior lower edge the upper part of the
nipples. The arms will then be lowered to hang loosely
by the side, and care will be taken that the shoulders are
not thrown upwards or backwards so as to displace the
tape. The candidate will then be directed to take a deep
inspiration several times, and the maximum expansion of
the chest will be carefully noted. It is often attempted to
conceal the true minimum measurement, but it can be
obtained by a little manipulation and by drawing off
attention from the examination by a few questions.
The maximum expansion rarely exceeds the average
minimum by more than 2 to 2| inches.
In recording the measurements, fractions of less than
half an inch should not be noted.
(d) The candidate will also be weighed without
clothes, and his weight recorded on the proceed-
ings of the Board.
( e ) Eyesight.?The following are the regulations for
examination of eyesight:?
Squint, inability to distinguish the principal colours, or
any morbid condition of the eyes or of the lids of either eye,
liable to the risk of aggravation or recurrence, will cause
the rejection of the candidate.
The examination for determining the acuteness of vision
includes two tests?one for distant, the other for near
vision. The Army Test Types will be used for the test


lor distant ' ision, without glasses, except where otherwise
stated below, at a distance of 20 feet; and Snellen?s
Optotypi for the test for near vision without glasses, at
any distance selected by the candidate. Each eye will be
examined separate!} 7 , and the lids must be kept wide open
during the test. The candidates must be able to read the
, , Cl .
tests without hesitation in ordinary daylight.
A candidate possessing acuteness of vision, according to
one of the standards herein laid down, will not be rejected
on account of an error of refraction, provided that the
error of refraction, in the following cases, does not exceed
the limits mentioned, viz. : ?(a) in the case of myopia, that
the error of refraction does not exceed 2-5 D; (h) that
any correction for astigmatism does not exceed 2?5 D ;
and, in the case of myopic astigmatism, that the error of
refraction does not exceed 2'5 D.
Subject to the foregoing conditions, the standards of the
minimum acuteness of vision with which a candidate will
be accepted are as follow :
Standard I
Right eye.
Distant vision.?Y = 6/6.
Near vision.?Reads 0, 6.
Left eye.
Y - 6/6.
Reads 0, 6.
Standard 11.
Worse eye.
Better eye.
Distant vision.?V = 6/6.
Y, without glasses, = not
below 6/60; and after
correction with glasses, =
not below 6/24.
Near vision.-?Reads 0, 6.
Reads 1.
Standard 111.
Better eye.
Distant vision.?Y, without
glasses, = not below
6/24; and, after cor-
rection with glasses, =
not below 6/6.
Near vision.?Reads 0, 8.
Worse eye.
Y, without glasses, not
below 6/24; and after
correction with glasses, =
not below 6/12.
Reads 1.


The degree of acuteness of vision of all candidates will
be recorded in the following manner :
Sufficient i ? i f ht e 7 e 7 = Reads
( Left eye V= Reads
Defective | ??f ht e y e 7 = Reads
I Reft eye Y = Reads
Reads.
Reads.
The following additional points will be observed
(f) That his hearing is good.
iff) That his speech is without impediment.
(h) That his teeth are in good order. Loss or decay of
ten teeth will be considered a disqualification. Decayed
teeth, if well filled, will be considered as sound. Non-
erupted wisdom teeth are not to be counted as deficient.
(i) That his chest is well formed, and that his lungs and
heart are sound.
(k) That he is not ruptured.
(I) That he does not suffer from a severe degree of vari-
cocele* or varicose veins. A candidate who has been
successfully operated on will be accepted.
(m) That his limbs are well formed and developed.
(n) That there is free and perfect motion of all joints.
(o) That his feet and toes are well formed.
(p) That he does not suffer from any inveterate skin
disease.
(q) That he has no congenital malformation or defect.
(r) That he does not bear traces of previous acute or
chronic disease pointing to an impaired constitution.
(s) That he is free from any disease or from any physical
defect that would be likely to render him unfit for military
service.
(t) If the candidate is not of pure European descent, the
fact should be recorded by the Board.
* Severe varicocele is defined in para. 282 of the Standing Orders for the Australian
Army Medical Services, 1909.

7. At the completion of the physical examination, the
Board will forward (on C.M. Form K 7) to the officer who
appointed it a list of the candidates? names, stating opposite
each whether he is fit or unfit.
This form is to be transmitted to the President of the
Board appointed to supervise the written examination, in
sufficient time to reach him before it begins. It will, by
him, be attached to the proceedings of the Board. (See
Part I, para. 12 (/).
