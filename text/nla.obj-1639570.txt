INTRODUCTION.

S*(XRT MACQUARIE, as is generally known,
was one of the first Settlements made in
Hew-South Wales. It is intended herein to
give a full and authentic synopsis of the Life
of the Oldest Living Ex-Oonvict on the
Hastings River, near Port Macquarie, ex-
tending from the thirties onwards. The
information comes purely from memory,
hence exact dates on which certain events
occurred cannot be given ; nevertheless the
greatest care has been taken to give dates as
near as possible.

FAREWELL TO MY NATIVE LAND.
The web of ourlife is of a mingled yarn,
good and ill together ; our virtues would
be proud if our faults whipped,them not,
.and our crimes would despair if they
were not cherished by our virtues.'' —
SHAKESPEARE.
I WAS bom at Shoreditch, near London, on.
the 28th of May, 1819, and was nearing the
age of sixteen when one day I was accused
erf committing a paltry theft. «Of this ?I was
innocent, and naturally denied it, but the
constable who accosted me insisted, no
matter what I said, that I had to go with
liim. My feelings were anythiug but high-
flown as I passed along the street with him
—what boy's feelings would be I—on the
other hand they were down almost below
zero, ft was no I soon realised my
position, it was this.:—lf lam found guilty
of this offence—and I have little hope of
proving my innocence—Heaven only knows
where I may find myself. My trial came
on before a Bench of Magistrates in Worship
S'reet, London, on July the 3rd, 1834, and
J was committed to take my trial. When
a,man had .the bad luck to get .committed^

he was seat to Olerkenwell, or to the (fid
Bailey, and if he listened to the conversa-
tions of his associates at either of these
places, during intervals that he might be
remanded, it was fuite possible that a
previously innocent man would be converted
into an adept at picking pockets and house-
screwing. I was a new-chum in places of
this kind, and also at such pursuits. New-
el) urns generally fell into, and were made
the subject of, cumbers of practical jo ices,
too, at the hands of these fellows, and I was
saved none the less in this respect. Go
upstairs and get the bellows," one of them
said to me: and when I got to the top of
the stairs, gome others sent me to the far
end of the ward for it. On arrival there,
another crowd met me with knotted hand-
kerchiefs, and 1 pasted' me all the way back.-
M Pricking a crow's nest," was another of
their games. This consisted in making a
round ring on the wall with a piece of
charcoal, and placing a black dot in the
centre of it. One was then blindfolded, and
his object was to place his finger on this*
black dot; but instead of doing this, another
fellow stood with open mouth to receive the
finger, and he didn't forget to bite it either*
If anyone took money into this place they
might as well say ' au revoiri to it, for they
were not asleep. After a few days of tta
**" ■ ■_' ■_


life my trial cam© ota —f was Eenieiiiceci t©
Australia for ? years' pesaal servitude* Them
I w»3 sent to Newgate, aud when the door
opened there, I was met hy a large numhef
of lack Shepherds,* 3 all m irosas, and the
place was as dismal-looking as the grave.
gPirsfc I entered the receiving-room, and
romaiued there a day 5 afterwards i. was
put in with a fine assemblage of characters-,
?vsd one might as well tasgiu to eouou Jib©
stars in the lieaveos as attempt t© define
who was the worst individual there,
came 0® -and t. %egau to look around for a
bed; this i found consisted -of a rug and a
mat; of which I availed myself. If a mait
was sentenced to seven years he was only
kept there for a few days,, and was then
taken in irons, by tne&us of a wan, to the
" bulk" at Portsmouth. this was the fate
I shared. On arrival there I was stripped
of My clothes, and after the barber cam©
round and cut my hair so close that it wag
only with difficulty I could catch hold of
I was washed from two water which
atood close by. Then I was dressed in *
pair of knee-breeches, stockings, shirt, and
«a pair of-shoes so large that. J could have
almost crossed the Atlantic in them, and a
hat capable of weathering the greatest hur-
ricane that ever blew. on board the
fcalk an old lew paid several visits, for


purpose of buy png up all the ordinary efotfie*
of the men, and no matter how new a sail
might be, it was either a matter of take half-
a crown for it or throw it away. Fortunately*
nay best clothes were left behind, and 1 lost
nothing by this.
I remained on the hulk from Friday till
Monday morning, and was then transferred
to what was known as the Bay Ship—the
by means of a cutter. There?
were 20,0 prisoners- on board this ship
altogether. Before leaving the hulk, tho
kens worn in Australia weir® attached to
the legs* but these were removed on getting
to sea. Men, however* were branded all
©ver —shirt, trousers* a»nd everything ®lse„
The '>Hoogly'* left Portsmouth harbour
&m- the 2Sth July, 1534, and was 120 day®
coming to Australia, and the passage ou
the whole was not unfavorable. Four men*
however, were fogged during the passage-
tor misconduct. One of those on board was
transported for stealing articles Irom a
itoman Catholic Chapel* and ke had by
some means managed to get a quantity of
tobacco into his possession. One night
whilst h® was asleep some of the others
conspired to get this tobac®o, and they pnfc

ARRIVAL AT SYDNEY.

" Misery acquaints a man with strange beet
fellovvs/— SjIAKESPKARE.
Notwithstanding the fact that the .Sattle.-
Bient at Sydney was now nearly 50 years old,
rny impression on arriving there in tho
summer of 1834 was anything but a bright
one, and by no means came up to my
faintest expectations, Jfc was a acattered-
loojking place—.a house here and a terrace
,there, but miserable enough to my mind.,
After we had been in Sydney harbour a few
days, a number of officials came aboard the
ship, and, as if >to the manner born,' took
a list of the marks on the men, who were
stripped to the waist. One of them, in
particular, had some writing on his arm,
and he was told that if it wa3 not .quickly
removed, lie would get 50 lashes for it
when he reached shore, so he took* the
advice. We remained aboard ship till three
days later, we were marched ashore in line,
four deep, a litile after daylight, and taken to
JJyde Park Barracks. Hero we got a beauti-
ful breakfast, "hominy," in little tubs,

At 2 o'clock the sattre day we were called
out to witness a punishment* There were
no " 25's " there ; all 4t 50's '' and " 75's"—
goodness knows what the offenders had been
doing. After this, it was possible for any
one of us to be called out and sent to a
master. If a man had a seven years'sentence,
hehad to serve four years with a master before
he got a " ticket-of leave but if he hap-
pened to prove himself a success at any
particular vocation* he would never get his
ticket,'* as the master for whom he was
working would arrange with one of the other
servants to quarrel with the handy man, and
he would be sent to the lockup to be flogged*
and get ati addition to his sentence. If a
man was sentenced to 14 years, lie had to
serve 0 years with a master before he got a
" ticket." All the master had to give a
servant in the year was *2 suits of clothes, *2
pairs of boots and a hat,* also his food. The
latter was supposed to be eithef S|lbs. of
maizetneal and fibs, of flour, or 91bs. of beef

My first assignment was to Mr. Saiu. Terry,

had little or nothing to do, and this man
was a good master —he would never hare his
men flogged. But I had the misfortune to
be stricken with the sandy blight at this
place, and I was sent fo the Windsor Hos-
pital, where I remained for 10 months. From
here I was sent to Windsor Gaol, but
instead of a bed, I had to lie on a flag-stone,
which was not conducive to building up my
health. From Windsor I war transferred to
Farramatta, and eventually to the Barracks
again. Shortly after this, 1 was sent on to
that beautiful vessel known as the " Phoenix"
hulk—prison ship. This was the first occa-
sion on which I had the extreme pleasure of
meeting Dr. , the man who conspired
with two others to rob a house, and when
they were in the act of doing so, he
assailed them with a gun, fired and wounded
one of them as he came out of the window,
and secured his freedom for catching thieves.
This was a very cunning trick, as he arranged
the plot himself, and ho afterwards became
prominent. I saw him shortly after this
took place, when he was assuming all sorts of
things, and I said " Hulloa ! how
3
getting on ?" He looked at me, and said,
" Why, I never saw you before, sir." " That II
do," I said, "you forget that I saw you on
the " Phosnix " hulk, and don't try to put on

Side before me." He said no more.
CHAPTER IT.
To POUT MACQUARIB.
•" O suffering, sad humanity !
O ye afflicted ones,
Steeped to the lips in misery:"
—LONGFELLOW,
fT was not long before my health had suf-
ficiently repaired to allow of my being sent
to Port Macquarie, and as this journey had
to be accomplished by water, the steamer
• <c Little Billy," (William the fourth) came
into requisition. I left Sydney in this vessel!
on Monday, and she reached her destination
on the following Sunday, after we had been
on deck the whole time tossing about. There
were a good number of us on 'board, and
.sometimes we got tea, and more often we
didn't. We were inspected on arrival, and
afterwards landed at the barracks, which
stood on the water's edge against the river.
The first incident that came u.nder my notice
on arrival was a jean, hungry-looking fellow
named " Nipper," going along with his head
.down, apparently in a tit, until he reached
and hit up against a wall, then he fell on his
back like a cockroach—-he was bloated out
nearly as large as a cask with "hominy."
XUeu J saw another .man named " Barry "


©Omfng along ; he was ; positively mad, for he
used to go along singing out " Larry ! Larry ! !-
Larry!!!" 'jfhis man was reputed to liaVe
knocked his wife's brains oUt with a sauce-
pan. Still another I saw, who was called
11 Captain/' He had been a pirate, and used
to walk about the rOofs of houses with a
piece of stick, using it as a telescope, arid
giving orders. I heard him sing out "Chucfk
us up that Jew
to deal with," and I
don't know whom He meant, but it was quite
enough for me, so I left. IsigHt came on, and-
one of the men—Jack Sleet—had a few shiL
lings in his pocket. Some of the others heard
the money jingle, and needless to say he was
watched to bed, the money being placed
very safely underneath him. Everything
was qjuiet towards the middle of the night,
when suddenly we were all awakened by
, Oh !
hearing a man sing ©u j t, u Oh ! h
f A 4 *
h , somebody s cut me. It
h , somebody's cut me." It transpired
that someone, in cutting the money from under
Him, had forced the knife rather too much,
and it had entered his flesh, but the money
was gone all the same, and every one appeared
to be asleep.
- - ~ •>
When all the men retired to barracks at
night, it was so crowded that where to He
down became a puzzle, and it was dirty
besides. Men still kept on coming from
Sydney, which made matters ten times*


worse, One day while in these quarters, I
was sent down to one of the wharves to help
unload a boat laden with produce. 1 worked
very hard all day, and it was late in the
evening before I returned to the barracks.
On arrival I asked the master's permission to
bake myself a "johnny cake" for supper.
In due course I had the cake mixed, and
placed it<sn the Ore to cook in an old frying-
pan that was more * l hol(e)y than righteous."
Seated beside -the Ore watching my cake, I
felt a nasty hit with a stick from behind, and
ibi i
as there was no other weapon handy with
•which to return the compliment, I grasped
the frying-pan by the handle, and, turning
? round, brought it down full force on to my
.assailant's head. Needless to say, his head
.was harder than the bottom of the pan, and
the next thing I remember was seeing him
-.wriggling about with the hot pan on his neck,
.and exclaiming, "Oh ! my G—, this pan is
burning me J" Then a hy-stander came up
with a bucket of water and poured it on him,
and afterwards the pan was removed. I
turned to him, and said ; " The next time I
am at the fire perhaps you'll leave rne alone. 7 "
JBut my feet hardly had time to touch the
ground before I was landed in the lock-up,
and the next day I was brought before the
.court and sentenced to 36 lashes, and it
i-would have been " 100" only that the over-


Meet spoke up for mo, and said that ( was
quite justified in my action. But even "
was a fine cure for the " prickly heat. 7 I
got full of this and ran away to the Green
jjills—ls miles distant—with a mate, When
we got there, it seemed that we were to get
no peace, for the aborigines came around us
with their " yabber," and it was but a short
time before they were off to the police and
informed them of our whereabouts. Two days
later we were caught, and I got " 50' more
io " clench the bargain."
£HAPTEK Y.
THE IRON GANG.
M To what base uses we may return." —HJJAKFAFEABE
Poctors, in the practice of tbsir profession,
not infrequently inform their patients that
there is an insufficiency of iron in their blood,
hut no such assertion was ever known to be
made to a man who at any t|me occupied a
position in the Port Macquarie Iron Gang,
for if there was no iron in their blood there
should have been, if the " barking of shins"
went for anything. I was sent into this
gang, and amongst the men in it were a
n .umber termed " specials." These " specials
were sent out principally for forgery or
swindling, and many of them were so flash


9H~f
|EH|
IjS r\! ■
Mi) Mr
12'
that they used to look down upon the other
class of men, and try to play a game of
" bluff." I was boiling my bitty of tea one
evening, when one of them came up and
threatened to do all sorts of things to me if J
did not remove my billy and allow him the
fire. " What do you want 1" I asked. " I
want the fire;" he replied. " Well," I said,
you can have it when lam finished." He
took no notice of me, but persisted in re-
moving my billy and placing his own on the
fire. At last I quietly lifted his off, threw it
into the swamp, and gave him a good thrash-
ing. I was then removed, and got a little
peace.
Perhaps for a fortnight now 1 went to
work with the hand-cart r bringing firewood
for the Government officers, and finally
joined the iron gang again. Shortly after I
re-joined this gang a" man named Arger, who
had been captain in a regiment, was attacked
by a fierce looking fellow named Lorrens,
who went Up, and, drawing a knife, stabbed
Arger both sides of the neck and in the ribs,
then told him to u draw hrs sword and defend
himself." This man had not the slightest
provocation to commit such a murderous act,
as the poor fellow never did him the least
injury, and he was sent to Norfolk Island
for life.
Another man in the gang named Hander


sen, a carpenter, went up to a Frenchman
named Antonio, and knocked him down wih
a hammer; then, turning round, he said :
**l killed that b , and I hope his soul
has gone wandering." These acts were
done principally for tobacco, or for half-a-
loaf of bread, (even in those days " half a-
loaf" was considered to b9 better than " no
bread") and the object was generally to get
some of the flash " specials *' a holiday to
Sydney in charge of a man, and this was
called u jeeing " them.
When a man received sis or 12 months
in irons, be had to sleep on the floor with
one blanket, and a sleeper for a pillow; and
if he got ever so wet before going to bed in
raiuy weather, he had to put on the same
wet clothes uext morning.
There was another cowardly thing done
in the iron gang. A poor fellow named
Freeham was met by a member of the stone-
breaking party, who raised a hammer and
struck him in the jaw, breaking it. This
wretch got 12 months added to his former
sentence, but was afterwards sent to Sydney
on a charge of murder on his own word,
for killing a man at Ballengarra, situated
some miles up the river; but as there was
no evidence except his own, he was sent

back to Port Mac<|narie for 12 months—*
though he said that he would rather be
hanged than serve another 12 months in
such a place of slavery and trials > for out
of about 50 or GO men, 14 or 15 of them
would be brought before the court every
week and punished, and they were all poor,
harmless men. The charge agaiust them
was usually neglect or disobedience. Fancy
poor wretches, with chains hanging about
them being charged with neglect of work,
or even disobedience. Walking about in
chains was hard enough work without
carrying hand-carts full o! earth, and who
could bring themselves to obey flash
M specials f"
One poor wretch got a month in the cells
on bread and water for having a piece of
writing paper in bis pocfeet, aud another
unfortunate fellow was seutenced to " 100
lashes" for having a letter in his pocket
which he was endeavouring to send to a
friend. Still these officials went to Church,
offered up prayer (?) and aped religion,
Tom was sentenced to two months
on bread and water for running away ; but
although Tom bolted be only went a little
w iy and brought himself to an anchor on a
farm, which he never left. He used to go


mV>l

info a hollow tree in tiie day time, and,
opossum-like, come out at night aud eat
tins corn, Half-an-acre of this grain disap-
peared in a fortnight, and then he gave
himself up, as there was no more corn to
cat. This man had great storage capacity,
as one Sunday morning I saw him eat
eight men's allowance lor a ration of corn
bread whilst going a distance of about "200

returning from work, he saw a woman
lying drunk on the road, mod he picked her

away into the hush with her. The Police

what was taking place, sang out, " Put
that woman down 1" "If I do," said
Tom, u the d— police will have her*^
and he took no further notice, but continued
on his journey, and there was not a sign of
him till the next day. Then he was ar-
rested and locked up by the police, and
received II days on bread and water for his
trouble. When he came cut he bore aSaa!^

starved appearance— the bread and water
did not suit him.
About the year 183 i the gang had com-
pleted the first road, and the tame, the
blind, and those with wooden legs were
furnished with a clean bed in honor of the
occasion. These cripples were employed
principally in taking goods to the settlers
without payment, and the poor wretches
often went short when their journey's end
was reached. When not employed, they
used to lounge about on the hills overlook-
ing the sea sunning themselves, and it was not
infrequent that they had quarrels amongst
themselves, dust picture to yourself a man
with wooden legs offering to w fight any
man on timber " as they used to
put it. When these wooden-legged men
had a quarrel in a boat they sat on the
seats, with a man propped against the back
of each, and in this fashion they would
fight away in great style, I saw two of
them on one occasion fight till they couid not
see each other. There were also one-
armed men amongst them ; these were em-
ployed in breaking stone, and they had a
Jew for a boss, who was also a wooden-
legged man. One day he went to sleep in
ilg sun on one of the hills above tba


harbour, and another Jew naniled Lewis?
collected a quantity of old maize stalks and
other fuel, and set fire to his wooden legs
whilst he was asleep. They were not
burning long* however, before he awoke and
found one to be shorter than the others
and it was a sight for sore eyes to see him
walking down to the Old Broken ©arracks,-
singing out to everyone that he met —•
u That Jew-looking b——down there has
burnt my legs nearly off.' 1
Just after this a poor fellow died in the
barracks. A. coffin was made for him, and
his remains were being carried away for
interment by fdftr of his fellow-prisonere.
After they had proceeded some little dis-
tance, two of them had a -quarrel, when
they threw the coffin down, and it burst, and
out rolled the corpse on to the ground.
They fought their quarrel out, and after
receiving satisfaction at each others bands,
they picked the body and coffin up and car-
ried it back to the barracks, where it was
tacked together again, and four other men
were sent to bury it*
The making of roads in the streets of the
Settlement was now being actively pro-
ceeded with, and in some instances the
hills which had to be cut through were so


Bfe • ,
ateep that a man could not comfortably
ascend on®- of them without iron® on bis
tegs, fet alone with fefaem—hut the hills had
to be broken down fey men with sore backs,,
and if one man happened to eollid© with
another who had been recently flogged, it
would be— u Oh, Gr f mind my sore
back." These were hard times hard worked
and half starved!

wretched overseer used to take a delight in

Into the gang. He met Mr. - one
morning, and said, 41 If you do not give «ie
five ' hob ' I'll lay a charge against you for
buying rations off the Government men.
He was thereupon caught by the collar and
taken off to the watchhouse, and was sen-
tenced to two months in the iron gang. It
was about 11 o'clock in the day when he
came into the gang, and that evening he got
"fib"' for doing something. The next
day he tried the same dodge, but was
walked off again and got another 44 50."
The third day he went up to the overseer
and said : " Oo you expect me to work after
the flogging I got yesterday!' The answer was
a smack with a big stick. He was compelled
s*■
to go to work with the other men, dragging
hand-carts fall of earth. There were three
nurn to each cart, and a soldier always accom-
panied the men to keep them from running
away or receiving tobacco, as if any of the
weed were found on a man he would get
*'"so." No spoons, knives, or forks were
allowed men in the iron gang, for if they had
them they would stab each other. Some
used to eat their " hominy" with a piece of
iron hoop, which they used as a spade-sera per,
Others used a piece of bone. One fellow had
a hat with a double-crown, and he used to


secrete tobacco and other things fn ft, Tho-
overseer once picked this hat up and said to
him i " You have a hat with two crowns, 72 *
" Yes," he replied, " It 7 s a good job you

when his back was turned ; but if he eaugftt
any of them they were sure of " 50,' 7 for he
never said a word—only just held up a
stick and a policeman would come to the
rescue.
Every Sunday the men got a small piece of
soap with which to wash their clothes, and if
rain happened to come on whilst they were
doing it r orders were given to just gather up
the clothes,, and, wet or dry, they were
brought into the room. These clothes then?

and he was only in the gang two days when
the overseer brought him to eourt and got
him " 50." He then took the sulks,- aucf
would neither work nor eat. Then he wis
handcuffed and dragged op and down the-
street till some of the more tender-hearted
officials could stand it no longer ; and he
was eventually chained to a bed-post, whew
fie lay down, like an over-worked ox, and
died. It was the custom to chain men to*
their bed when they became sick and were*
sent to the hospital, for fear that they would
run away in the night. One man did bolt
at night, and was not heard ©f again, the
supposition being that he perished in the
bush. This was a fine man, too, and once
belonged to the Life Guards in London.
I was amongst a batch of men who were
once marched down from the barracks to
assist in unloading a little vessel'—the
w Waterwitch' I —laden with corn, which had
become wrecked whilst crossing the bar. We
worked all day and were brought back at
night, receiving corn meal and water for our
supper. All our clothes were wet, and we
had either to sleep in them or ehc lie on the*
fioor with nothing. Such was life in the
iron gang.

ASSIGNED TO LAKE INNES.
" Double, double toil and trouble." — SHAKESPEARE,
Shortly after Port Macquarie was made a
Penal Settlement, several men of considerable
t H ;'X-
H Mi:
wealth visited and settled in the district, and
were granted large areas of land in and
around the Settlement;. Amongst these was
Major Innes, who became the possessor of a
large area of land about six miles from tho
town, which was ani is known as Lake
Innes. On this property the " Major" built
a beautiful residence, with all the conven-
iences that money could command. It was
not long before he commenced to breed
horses for the Indian market, and frequently
sent shipments of valuable horses to India.

Besides this, he occupied large stores in the
Set dement, and used to contract wish tho
Government for supplying soldiers and men
with provisions. A man of the " M ajor's"
calibre could, by applying, get numbers of
what were termed "assigned servants" to
work on his property, and of this labour he
availed himself to a great extent.
In tho year 1838 I and two others were

sent to Lake Innes to dig wa'er holes for
cattle, the Reasons being so dry at ihe time
that water had become a scarcity. We dug
drains through the swamps, and made pro-
vision for ample water for the famishing
cattle. Slopes were also made leading into
the drains, so that any cattle which fell into
the water, and were too weak to get out
themselves, could he polled out. One day,
while there, the boss came down to see how
we were progressing with the work, and after
a while one of us said to hiib : "You ought
to allow us a little more tea and sugar, for
this is hard work ; to say nothing of being
lip to our knees in water ajhday."
"Go on with your work,"' he said, " I
. |
think a good dogging would do you more
good than tea and sugar. Did- you get tea
and sugar in the road party T'
" No, sir ; but Ve had not to work in the
water; and we left off work at 3 o'clock to
cook our food, but here we have to work till
6." At this he turned and walked away.
A few days afterwards I. pretended to be
sick, and went up to the overseer and said ;
" I want a pass for the hospital."
" I can't give you one," lie replied, "but
if you'll bring up a pot I'll give you semis
sastor*bil,"

1 went down to the hat afid brought up
the " RoJ'st George"—the big pot that we
used to cook in, laid it at the door and sang
out.
The overseer came out, and seeing the pot,
asked, H What the devil did you bring that
for r
if
" That's the only pot I can find," I said,
"except what we make our tea in, and I
could not put oil in that." Then he gave me
some oil in a bottle. He came down the
next day to see if the oil had done me any
good, I told him that tt had, hut ft was a
fowl that I had the night before that did me
good, for I went about with my eyes open
and knew where they roosted—in the castor
oil bushes. I did not want oiling like a
steam engine.
Rain now came, andf we relinquished the
drain digging; I was then sent into the
vegetable garden to work. I was there but
a very short time when the milkman lost his
billet, and I succeeded him in that position.
This Job did not suit me ; all the iDther men
were comfortable in huts, and I was stuck,
out in the milk yard in all sorts of weather,
knee-deep in muck, as well as being growled
at by the other men if I did not let them
take the milk, it was a bad job for a fellow


•if he were eaught at anything like this, and at
the very least it meant " 50." I was in
great dread, as I had to please the men by
letting them take the milk, and I also had to
please the master by preventing them. One
morning I hit upon a plan to get out of this
billet It was raining very heavily this
morning, and I was wet through. When I
had finished milking I dipped my hands into
the muck in the yard, and then into the milk,
carried it up to the house, and gave it to the
butler. He looked at me for a second, then
at the milk, and said, " You d , dirty
brute 1 Whom do you think can drink that
milk f " Well, I can't help it," I said,
*' look at the yard, up to my knees in tilth,
and the boss won't givo me time to clean it
cut.'' "Then you shall not milk any more,'*
said the butler.
I was laughing up ay sleeve to think how
well I had done the business,. They put
another milkman on, but he soon went to the
hospital with pains in his legs. A third man
was put on, and after a few days he was
recalled to help make bricks, so the old
milkman was then engaged, and that ended
the trouble.
One morning the signal bell pealed out,
and all the men had to go up and see what

they were wanted for. There was a terrific
Storm raging, and we were told that we had
to cut wood for the dining-room and parlour
fires, hut not one would stand out in such
weather to do the work. We went to the
Loss and told him that we would cut the
firewood as soon as the storm was over,
" How often am I out in the rain V he said,
j >
"it won't melt you—-you're not sugars"
Turning to the overseer, he ordered us to he
put on Government rations, and we were
then the recipients of 7lhs. of flour, of
corntucal, and 7lhs. of meat —what the men
used to call "staggering hoh"—in the week.
Saturday came—ration day—and 1 went up
for my allowance as usual.j hut when it
came to the donation of meat, I was shown a
large piece of hone with a small piece of
meat attached to it. "Is that what I am
going to getl" I asked. "Yes," replied the
overseer, " and if you don't like it, leave it! "
I left it, declaring to myself to' have
some more of the fowls and turkeys out
of the cas or-oil hushes. Two nights
passed; the third was showery, and
very convenient for thejoh; it was also very
dark. I armed myself with a hag, arid pro
ceeded up to where they used to roost. My
hag was soon half-full of uiid some


of them were cooked and eaten in double*
quick time, for the others had onions out of
the vegetable garden cooking while I was
awav. The remainder of the poultry, not
eaten that night, was hidden in the swamp
and eaten as required. It was very conven-
ient to have the vegetable garden handy, and
the gardener had just planted out a hundred-
weight of onions, but when he went to see
how they were growing theie were but yery
few left. This was the only way to cure
hunger after a day's toil. One night about a
week afterwards 1 went up to the castor-oil
trees for another pair of fowls, and who
should i see on the other side of the bushes
but ———, the constable, helping himself to
a fowl also. I did not have to wait long, for
he soon got his, and then the coast was clear,
so I got mine and departed. The constable
was looked upon as a very honest fellow, hut
he was caught at last taking two sacks of
; I
flour and some other provisions, and 12
months in irons was his lot. At this time it
took as much material to make a pair of
trousers for him as wou'd make two pairs for
an ordinary man, and when his hair was cut
and his whiskers shaven, lie looked like a
" mountain in a fog." But the hard hoards
and one blanket, with only a sleeper for a
X , &


pillow, soon told on him, for in less than
three months, alter good doses of " hominy"
aKahs '
and the pick, he became as thin as a whip-
ping post, although he was fortunate enough
to escape without a flogging. Borne men had
wonderful luck in this way; the greatest;
rogue generally got off the lightest.
About half-a-dozen men were assembled in
the shoemaker's shop one day, and the con-
versation drifted on to persotis who were
living in a state of adultery. "Now we will
count," said the shoemaker to the boys, " all
the people about here who are living in a
state of adultery." " And we will com-
mence," said another, " with you and your
mother. Let me see, how many more has
she got besides you, Harry ?" This was a
hit for a start, and poor Harry walked out
of the shop as if he had committed a murder.
After this there was no more talk about
people living on the cross.

sack, and, as it was so scarce, Sir George
Gipps, the Governor, recommended that those
who had the supplying of provisions for the
prisoners should grind rice and mix it with
the flour. This course was adopted, but
when it was baked the loaf resembled a
brick outside and a piece of clay inside.

The meat was horrible. This, however,
could not be remedied, as there was no feed
for the cattle ; and as for mutton —when a
sheep was skinned and dressed, if a candle
were put inside of the carcase it would serve
all the purposes of a lantern.
There was a screw loose at Lake Innes
one morning; the store containing the pro-
visions had been broken into and robbed.
All the men's huts were searched —even
the floors taken up—trying to get the slight-
est clue to the robbery. The police were
busy as bees, but they could not get the
least hint. The value of the stolen goods
was estimated at £5O, and they comprised
a good assortment of the various household
requisites. The Port Macquarie police were
sent for, and the boss flung about first in
one place and then in another. At last
the bell rang, and all hands had to stand
out before the "Lord of the Lake." It was
a real field day—men strutting about as
though in a field of battle. The boss offered
sums of money to anyone who would tell
who the robbers were, for he said that no
rascal could do it single-handed. At last
two suspects were picked out and sent to
the lock-up, but they returned in a week, as
no case could be got against them.

About three weeks afterwards I wns 8$
4 t
Work with the 'pick and shovel, making ©
foad down to the boat-house, for there were
pleasure boats on the Lake, The constable
came down to me, and said : "Ah ! my
boy, I've got you and *—, now ;it was
you two who robbed the store, and now you-
will have to pay for it.. You were seen at
the head of the tree where the bag of sugar
was found." I told him that X had no hand
in robbing the store, but X was marched up
to the house before the boss, who said : " So
you are one of the scoundrels who broke
into the store and stole all that you could
get your hands on, and I'll make it a bad
j A for you and that other scoundrel, f
will teach you a lesson this time, you
thieving dogs !"
"\Vlio should I see there, however, but
the man that should have been at work
with me,, and another fellow. They had
fast gone up to the house and informed that
1 was a culpri\ One of these two was to
get his freedom a few days later,, and ha
evidently thought that £5 reward would be
very nice to have a spree on, no matter
what an innocent man might sutler. The
other man and I were taken to Port
Ma/njuarle in a cart,, and brought before tb®


feeneh, The informer was as deaf as a
post, but the magistrate said that although
the man could not hear him, he could te 1
what he said by the quiver of the magis-
trate's lips. And so we got six months
added to our former sentence.
On Sundays church was held at the
Lake, and Mrs*
used to preach, 1
was sent for one morning to go to church,
so I blackened myself and went up without
a shirt. The boss met me on the way up,
and asked, "Where are you going to?'
" Well," I said,- " I'm going to chapel '
"Do you think you are going to cbapel
without a shirt?" he continued* "My
shirt is out on the fence drying," I answered.

"Then go on back again, and don't come up
in that plight any more." This was all
I wanted ; the church did not trouble me.
During my term here my eyesight be-
came bad again—it never bad been very
good from the time that I had sanely blight
some years before—and it got that way at
last that it was almost impossible for me to
see. The life there was not improving it
either, so I informed the boss* and after a
little conversation he gave me two letters—
one to the Police Magistrate in the town,
and the other to the doctor* 1 started of


with the letters, not knowing what was m
them, for my sight was too bad to read ;
but on the way in I met someone who eould,
and soon got over the difficulty. The letter
to the P.M. came first, and ran thus:
*' Dear , Inflict some severe punish.
rnent on this man and return him to me at
once, for I cannot get him to work." The
other one to the doctor was. just asking him
to have a look at my eyes, and do what he
could to them. Now it was not very likely
that I was going to take a note to the
Magistrate to perhaps get "50 " over it, so
without hesitation I tore it up, and went
down to the doctor, whom I did not fear,
and knew to be a good man. He read the
letter, looked at my eyes, and then said :
Well, if you want to see you can ; and if
you don't want to see you can go about with
the blind mob." Bo I decided to give the
" blind mob " a trial.

In the spring of 1847, Governor and Lady
Fitzroy visited Port Macquarie, and were the
guests of Major Innes at the Lake, When
the steamer by which they travelled arrived
at the wharf, there were two rows of
soldiers drawn up on each side of the road
leading from it, and waiting a little distance
away was the carriage of the " Major," with

pi \


SIJE horses in it—two bays, two grays, and two
chestnuts—and the distinguished visitors
were driven straight away to the Lake.
There was high life at this place now for
about a month—balls, parties, pie-nics, &c»
—when they returned to Sydney again. But
it was the Governor's misfortune to lose his
good lady soon afterwards, for she was killed
through a carriage accident in Parramatta
Park in December of the same year.

THE BLIND MOH.
** He that is stricken blind, cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost."
SHAKESPEARE
The day after the doctor told me that I
could go with the " blind mob," I joined
them. These blind people used to carry on
a little gardening and other occupations,
such as the blind were suited for. And
goodness knows what they were not suited
for—they could play cards, dice, toss, and
all sorts and conditions of things.
1 had not been in the camp ten tninufes
before a notorious character, named " Teddy,"
came up and said to me : " Come on, come

me to go stealing melons. "No," I sard,
" I m not going to get into any trouble over

you ever kill snakes V "Not often,'* I
said ; " Why, what do you want to know
that for V "YY ell," he returned, "I want

and they knew it. That night I retired, as
usual, and put my trousers under my head.
As soon as things were quiet the trousers
were eased from under my head, I knew it,
but said nothing, and as soon as they found
there was no money in them, back came the

THE ROAD PARTIES.
iSt More sinned against than sinning.'"

When a man had finished his sentence ki
,4he cliain gang, he was sentenced to a road
party, and.it was Heaven to the chain gang.
There was not so much slavery, and it was
possible to get a sort of lied to die down on
at night, if it were only a sheet of ti-tree
hark. The men got a little more food, too,
and they were allowed to oook it themselves;
.but it was often a straggling piece of meat
with about as much fat on it as would grease
the eye of a packing-needle. One man a'ways
remained to mind the camp while the others
-were at work, and very often he used to do
what was known as "weeding"—that was 4
taking a little out of each man's allowance
of provisions, and then he had a little to sell
and get money to buy himself some tea and

for instance, and some of the
tasted wine in their lives. A
there was a fearful uproar.. The overseer
was going to take him to court straight away y
but the other men said they would rather
settle it amongst themselves, and this they
did by each man giving him three blows on
the back with a knotted handkerchief; for
if he had been taken to co»rt r |he was almost
certain to get six months in irons, as the
authorities did not believe in the men rob-
bing one another of their food. I gave him
three good hits, and the handkerchief used
to rebound like India-rubber.
In the road party it was a funny sight to
see some of the flash " specials" using a cross-
cut saw. Their hands were verv soft, and
%/ '
they used to tie pieces of eld shirts round'
the handles at each end to protect them.
They generally liked a saw that would
5 pinch/ so that they would have an excuse-
to go to the camp for a maul and wedges to
drive into the cut and prevent the pinching;
thus they schemed and wasted their time.
In the middle of work I often heard them
commence to talk about the fine wine they
had drank at some of the big inns in London

was a different tale now—they saw very
little money in the road party.
But some of them had fine times of it
during one boss's term of office, for he did
not abuse them. It was-different when old
Major S came along to inspect them.
He came along once while I was there, and
said to one fellow, st Tiulloa E what did you
get sent out for V' " Forgery on Mr. So and
So," was the answer. "Dear me he's a
particular friend ot mine. Here, constable,,
take the tail oft his coat and brand him alt
over."
/'*
The constable then eat the tail of his coat
close off around the waist and htanded him
all over, leaving such a smell of paint from
the brands that the flies would keep off him
for a good many days afterwards.
Proceeding further the overseer pulled
another fellow up—"And what was your
occupation at home, and how came you to be
sent out here t' "I was a schoolmaster,,
and was sent cut for embezzlement," he
answered. " A fine fellow to teach scholars

A third fellow, in answer to a similar
question, said, '• I used to drive my carriage
and four at home, sir." "Then you will
drive a wheelbarrow and one out here!" He
was branded, too.
They looked first-c'ass with a pick an.d
shovel, and at making a damper—they had
n,p more idea of this than a kangaroo. Some
of them frequently said that they were wejl
<ofF in England, and yet they w.e.ro the
greatest villains under the sun. If a man
were possessed of any little thing out of the
.common they tried all sorts of plans to get it
from him, and if unsuccessful by fair means,
they would steal it from him. Every man
had to do his own washing, and these "spec-
ials" would rub away at their d,uck pants
with a piece of soap about the size of a half-
penny. The soap was something like the
.sugar they got for t&eir "hominy " —it was
visible, and that was aJ.b
The Pol ipe Magistrate came along once
and heard .one ,of tjie party pass a remark
which he did not like, so he said, "Jack, if
I could find a man to give you 50 lashes, you

" I promise you he will not have that

" Well, then," said N« d, u I'm in office."
He got .Jack on the "three-legged mare,"
as they used to call it, and started flogging.
Jack sang out, "You're not hitting me
properly."
" I'm doing roy best to please you,' he
Said, "so you must take it as it comes."
He gave him another lash and said.

"My G he said, " it seems you're

"50," and he would sing cut tc the fiogger,
" Tip it into him," and afterwards they were
sent to a road party.
Two blind men were brought before hint
one day on a small charge, and ho asked,
" What have you tvv;o to say for yourselves?"

bricks at him, and one struck him above the
eye. For this they were committed for

years at Norfolk Island.

" specials," and when using the spade lie

but when the overseer spoke to him r he had
the appearance of a goose looking down a
bottle. When this fei'ow became free, he
went to Sydney, and used to walk about with
a gold-beaded cane sealing eye-lotion.
Most of the "specials" were merely clerk » r
and were sent to this Settlement so that thev
would not be able to write home and tell how-
things w ere going on. They appeared to just
£io as they liked with those who wire under
them, if a man did not put his hand to his

liable to "50;" if he gave any of them a
sharp answer he was sure of " 50," and if he
said nothing at all, it was considered to be
" silent contempt," and this meant the same
" 50," so a man might as well do something
as be punished for nothing. This is how
men who had to work for them were treated.
It was a singular thing, however, that not
one of these bosses died worth as much
money as they could " jingle on a tombstone."
The worst wretches that a man could be
put to work under were those who had been
sent to the country themselves. They were
far worse than men who came out free, and
how men put up with the tyranny of these
brutes is far beyond my conception.
>'l '
In those days there were very few guns
procurable, and it was a rare thing to see
even an old dint musket. Pat was
ordered to get " 50" every morning for a
week for taking, to the bush with one of
tliese muskets. He begged of the boss to let
him have the whole week's flogging at once,
and so he got it. This old brute used to
glory in seeing a man being literally chopped
to pieces, and stood by, saying, " Tip it into
him!" 1
The bosses in these road parties were often
men with wooden legs, and were put over


these men as thev were considered unfit
w
for any other purpose. If annoyed, they
thought nothing of taking a stick—sorne-
times their wooden legs—and striking the
a o
men with them. One noted cripple turned
011 me one morning, but I retaliated with
an axe-handle, and gave him a good thrash-
ing. After this I bolted, but was caught a
few days afterwards, and received 12 months
in irons for my trouble. I could not put up
with hard work, and be knocked about by a
bopping d g of a man as well.
These cripples were only allowed a few
men to gather shells, cut bridle tracks for
them, and so on, in remuneration for their
labor as overseers ; but a man like H— ,
the notorious overseer, got 3s 3d per day, his
rations, a hut-keeper to cook for him, and
another man to get wood arid water. These
fools would almost stand the flesh being cut
off their bones rather than lose their billets.
One mean-looking fellow in the road party
was sent to this country for obtaining money
under the garb of a priest, and there was one
poor simple Irishman in the gang from whom
he rsed to get flour on the pretence that
he would give him his blessing. But it was
the flour he was blessing—not poor O'Brady.

This poor wretch was
to he pitied. He used to go about with
two old Caps tied up round his feet for shoes,,
and his lib. of "staggering bob," when
cooked and eaten, was almost as nothing
to him by way of checking hunger. On
more than one occasion he walked to Kathie
Creek —lO miles a'ong the sea-beach south
from the Settlement —and there he got a
meal of { clams' or ' cockles lie would also
bring some back to the camp with him. The
times were hard on a man of this kind,,
especially when he would walk 10 miles for
a feed ; but hunger was a sharp thorn, and

There was another
gang, but he was a
fine-looking man in the
terrible villain, and it
was supposed that he murdered a man n< t
far from the Settlement. Afterwards he
went to Sydney and there met his doom,
which was to be hanged for another murder,
and thus ended his career.
Port Macquarie seemed to be a depot for
rogues and villains such as these, for there
were some noted scoundrels amongst them.
The friend of a fellow

doing some thieving once, and he gave
T a hox to mind, which was supposed
to con'ain the stolen goods, until the robbery
"blew over. But T felt the weight of
the box, and thought there was something
wrong, so he opened it, and instead of finding
the different articles, it was full of brickbats.
X then went and informed, and got
the thief 7 years. He always passed as
Brickbat T " after that, and left
Port Macquarie for the go'dfields near
Bathurst about the year 1851 ; so a very
handy man to mind anything was lost.
Some of these fellows were made constables
in one boss's time, but when a change occurred
and another boss came, they were sent to the
roads to work with a pick and shovel. And
fine specimens they were at work, too; it
took them nearly all their time to look at
the blisters on their hands. Some of them
appeared to have been brought up well,
though, and one of these was Harry ,
a noted highwayman. This man had no
nose; some said that he cut if off to avoid
recognition, others said that it was bitten off
by an assailant. However, he had a silver
nose, and if he happened to lose it, had to go
without till a new one came from Sydney.
There was a road party at work about two


miles out of the town and one day Harry
came riding along on his favourite mare
" Biddy*" On nearing the camp the
mare (ook charge of him and hoi tod,
and in the confusion that ensued, his
nose fell off. He went some distance
before the animal got controllable; then
he came back and asked the road party's
assistance to look for the silver " snozzle."
After they had been looking a while, an old
black crow arose from amongst the ferns with
something (presumably a grub) in its beak.
One and all then declared that this was his
si ver snout the bird had, and at this Harry
got in a fearful rage and went off on his horse
without a nose at all. He was not a bad-
hearted man to his fellow prisoners,
though; he would not send them to the
lock-up, but rather advise them to keep
out and escape the punishment that invari-
ably followed.
..1
A prominent figure in the Settlement in
those days was a man named H
, who
was sent to the country for forging a will to
rob his orphan niece and nephew out of their
property; and a poor miserable player he
looked, carrying the "hominy" about on his
head. But finally he got out of the Govern-
ment, and his family came to the country

and started business. After this he got on
well, and one of his daughters married to ad-
vantage. The man whom this girl became
the wife of was, however, an obstinate fellow,
and if everything did not go his way, there
was always trouble. He was expecting his
father to die, and frequently went to the post
office in anticipation of news to that effect,
but when he did not get a letter, he used to
say : 11 My G— ! how much longer is that
old wretch going to live T At last the poor
old fellow did " shuffle off," and, although he
had comfortable means, he did not leave the
son a penny, only some tools. H was a
wide-awake old fellow, and at one time had a
boot and tannery business ; but he had a man
working for him who was equally wideawake.
This fellow used to cut hides down the back,
and take strips out of them wide enough to
make soies for boots or shoes. He was
caught at last, however, and received two
months in the iron gang. After this he re-
turned to his old master. One day, not long
afterwards, the boss went out, and this fellow
was making a pair of boots for sale on the
sly. When the boss returned, he popped in
rather suddenly, and only for the presence of
mind of his employer, a bowl out was certain.
In a second he threw himself on the door and


pre tend od to be in a fit. The boss walked in,
and, seeing him, immediately went for help-
not noticing the boots he was working at or
anything else. As soon as the boss made
his exit, he got up, hid the boots he was
working at, and put another pair in their
place ; and on the master's return, he was
just coming out of the fit, and soon got al-
right. This man got on well afterwards in
the Settlement..
The notorious " special," H , brought
twelve men to court one day for neglect of
work, but Mr. G , the Police Magistrate,
said that he and another gentleman had been
looking at the poor men at work, and they
could not understand how men ran down the
slopes where they were making the road
without falling, more especially in irons ; they
looked as if they were worked to death, and
he could not see in what way it would he
possible for them to neglect their work.
From the appearance of them, he thought
something to eat would do them more good
than a flogging. Then, turning to the notori-
ous H , he said ; "You are a pris-
oner yourself, I suppose ?"
" Yes, Your Worship," he answered.
The P. M. : "I thought so; you get so
much a day for bossing the men ?"


r I
S &•
" Yes," replied H
The P. M. : " Take them away, and don't
bring them before me again on such a
charge I"
The men turned to the Magistrate and
thanked him. They told him it was only
tyranny, and said it was a wonder how they
escaped without broken limbs, running down
such hills with loaded carts behind thewr.
This put an end to hogging, for the resi-
dents of the town commenced to talk about
it. But the place did not seem to thrive,
for as soon as the Government men had gone,
and no more were coming, things were on a
downward move. There was no more con-
vict labor; no more fashionable balls and
parties jno more cases of wines, spirits, and
beers—nay, it was all bread, meat, and tea,
and lucky these tyrannous wretches were if
they could get that, for they had to " look
ere they leaped" too far, lest they should fall.
Some of the flash officials lived at the rate
of about £5OO a year, but as soon as the
prisoners were removed their harvest was
finished, and it was as much as they could
do to keep the bailiff out. It was not, "Go
on, you rascal, or I'll take you to court,"
then ; but if they wanted a man to work they
had to pay him wages. And although em-


ployers were supposed to pay men wages,
they soon adopted another method of doing
them out of their earnings. This was done
by hiring men for six months, and, just be-
fore their term had expired, find some fault
with them, take them to court, aud get
their agreement cancelled and their pay
stopped. So it will be seen that use had
bred such habits in them that it was hard
to discontinue bringing the men to court.
However, this did not bring back the beer
and wine; a store account would soon be
upon them for the necessaries of life, and if
this were not paid within a reasonable time
there would soon be a bailiff from Sydney.
Thus they found out the loss of the poor
prisoners, whom they treated worse than
most men treat a dog, and it eventually
ended in selling off their cattle and horses
for what they would briug.
CHAPTER IX.
"SPECIALS" AND OTHERS.
" Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time.'*
— SHAKESPEARE.
It was not often that any of the
" Specials" were sent out to work as farm
labourers, because they were suited for

anything but bard work; so they were gen-
erally made constables. Conspicuous
amongst these was a man named Fred.
, who, it was said, forged the largest
cheque which had been forged on the Bank
of England up to that time. This was a
well-educated man. He could read and
write French, Spanish, and "Portuguese, and
had once been interpreter for the Court of
India. He had not been in the country
long before forgery commenced to worry
Rim again. For this, a sentence of two
years in the Fort Mneqaiarie Iron Gang was
given him, and he became the worst man
in it, for he fretted. When a man gave
way to the hardship, he became the victim
of insects, and this was the case with bim.
Small wonder at any man giving way to
the hardship in such a place, for it;' wa3
nothing but hard work, hunger, and flog-
ging, the floor to sleep on, and one blanket
as a covering. After this man had finished
his two years in the Iron Gang, he was sent
to a road party for about six months, and
then became a constable on a 'salary of 3s
3d per day. While a constable he wrote 1
to his father, who was a shareholder in a
eoal mine at Newcastle-on-Tyne, England,

could get good characters from the Police
Magistrate and a clergyman, he would en-
deavour to get him his freedom. Besides
this, his father sent him per week, which
With his salary, amounted to nearly £2
weekly; but here the pen and ink was intro-
duced again, and he forged the very man s
name who was paying him the £l per
week. He was then looked up, tried, and
committed, finally being sentenced to Nor-
folk Island for life. This ended his career
in Port M acqu&rie,
Punishment appeared to be no warning
to some of these men, and it seemed that
* just as the twig wsa bent, the tree inclined.
Tlie misery that this fellow suffered the
second time he was committed should have
been quite sufficient, for most of those who
had a taste of the Iron Gang did not return
to it any more. It must have been
severe when the authorities sent Charles
. from Sydney into the Gang for 12
months, as punishment for the murder of
M , on the Hunter River, and after-
wards burning him to ashes. In this case
there was no evidence except the murderer's
own word, but they declined to hang him
on that, both in this country and in
England. He was as quiet as a sheep in

way.
X» ——— was a Jew, and a very old hand
in the country. Originally he was sent to
Moreton Bay, but having found Captain
> who was killed by the blacks
there, he was shifted to Sydney, and was
practically a free man at that place. But
he could not keep out of trouble, and for an
offence was sent to a road party in Port
Macquarie, from which be did not get bis
liberty for about 22 years, and when it did
come, the news was too lake. He was
working in a party on the road leading from
the coast to the table-land (the Kew England
Boad) when bis ticket-of-leave became due,
but a few minutes before the news of his
freedom arrived, be was killed by a log
rolling on him, and was buried in the vicin-
ity of the camp. His fellow-workmen cut a
stone and erected it on his grave, as he was
very much liked by all the men on the road,
but someone afterwards removed the stone
and used it for grinding purposes. Every
day, as soon as this poor fellow had finished
his work, he would retire to bis bunk and
sit with a needle and thread making cabbage-
tree hats. These hats were always saleable


53
•v sT
and making them was the only means by
which a man could earn a few pence to buy
tea, sugar, and tobacco.
Tom P was one of the first men
sent to Port Maequarie when it was made
a Settlement, and he was a most peculiar
individual. Pigs seemed to be his whole
existence, for he appeared to love these
animals. He possessed some 1 grunters'
nine or ten years old, besides cattle and
horses. Tom used to sleep with the pigs,
and even with this precaution against
thieves it was not infrequent that he lost
one. Teddy H went out to Tom's
abode one night and stole a pig. When he
returned another fellow went for one.
While the second thief waa in the act, how-
ever, of getting his pig, Tom sat up amongst
them, and said, " How many more of you
are coming to-night ?" But they earned
these pigs, for they had to carry them about
a mile. Anyone who saw Teddy the next
morning after this could swear that he had
made a rise—for he had such a corporation—
and it was then a password among the men,
" Hulloa ! Teddy made a rise last night."
Then they said to Teddy, "Have you got
any more for to-morrow, Ted 1 perhaps you
could give us a leg j"

"Go for it yourselves, you crawling
hounds," he returned, "and chance it. I'm
not going to shake it and give it to you fel-
lows that are frightened of your own shadows.
If they grab me T must put up with It like
the rest of you."
Then they used to say to him, " Have you
got any cabbage or spuds to sell, Teddy ? We
want some onions, too I"
7 • /
This was how they questioned him, because
he had robbed a garden, and was proved
guilty by the police smelling the onions in
his breath. So poor Teddy got " 50" on
what was termed the " Broad Bean Racket"
(robbing a garden). But what did these men
care? If there was a garden handy, " 50"
or no " 50" they would be into it, as they
never got any vegetables except by stealing.
They were merry as crickets, too, when they
had had a good 'blow out.'
A number of the Government men were
assembled in a hut at a place known as the
" Stockyard," about a mile from the bar-
racks, one Saturday afternoon. It was their
intention to have a good feed, and they had
a big plum " duff" cooking; besides this,
by some means they got some wine. Three
of the number, thinking there was not enough
for everyone to have a decent allowance from,


decided to make another padding out of pipe-
clay. This was done, and, at a given signal,
two of them pretended to start fighting out-
side, while the other was to remove the pud-
ding from the pot when nearly cooked, put
the pipe-clay pudding in its place, and take
the wine also. All at once the cry was
raised, " A Fight! A Fight 1" Everybody
rushed out to see it, and then the business
was done. The cook afterwards went to see
how the pudding was getting on, and saw
the water discoloured with pipeclay. "Dear
me," he said, " the sugar has all evaporated."
It was not the sugar that had evaporated,
though; it was the pudding. One old fellow
who was nearly three feet across the shoul-
ders was sitting by, and when he became
aware of what had taken place, he made his
usual remark, which was : " Well, well, well !
capitally done !" They did not try feasting
in a crowd again.
CHAPTER X.
SOME NOTABLE CONSTABLES.
"Ofiee a constable, no more a man."— ANON.
" Return good for evil" may be a very
good maxim to follow, but it was out of the
question when a man came into contact with


some of the constables who were located in
the Settlement in olden days.
One of these, J
, had been
captain in the Native Cavalry in India, and
he was a fine horseman. But he was very
severe on the men, and if a man did the least
thing, swearing anything did not trouble
him. He occupied the position of barrack*
master till the men were robbed of their rations,
and then he got six months in irons. During
this six months the men bad a chance of pay-
ing back old debts, and they treated him
like a dog. This was only his deserts, how-
ever, for he would lie in ambush with traps
set on purpose to catch a man, then get him
flogged. One of the men tried to cut his
nose off, but only got two years in irons for it,
besides 100 lashes, and all the time he was
being flogged he was singing out: " What do
I see but G— Almighty looking at me 1"
This constable quarrelled with one of the
publicans, and brought a stool opposite the
hotel, where, on Sundays, he used to sit with
some other constables and watch that men
got no drink. I and some others arranged
to get into the hotel yard, and I came out
the front with a bottle of water under my
coat. Then, a as soon as he saw me,
yp be got off his stool and gave chase, I


went once round the block, and then, coming
to a crowd, let him catch up to me. He
grabbed the bottle, and found it was only
water ; then he started to perform. "By
G — 1" he said, " I'll bring you to court to-
morrow, I will, you d— —d scoundrel," gasp-
ins for breath all the time, after the run I
had given him.
Another Sunday a man came out of an
hotel, and this constable went up to hirn and
said : " You've been drinking, haven't you V
" No," he answered.
" Let me smell your breath," he continued.
The constable went to smell his breath,
and the man spat in his face, exclaiming,
There, you can smell that, and taste it too !"
He came on a group of cripples once, gam-
bling in the Old Stockade, and proceeded to
lock them up. This was a great sight, There
were wooden legs, crutches, sticks and fists
flying in all directions. At last, however, he
got help, and they were taken away and
locked up, brought to court the next day and
punished for their fun. Some got six months
in irons, others received fifty lashes; but
little did they care so long as he got knocked
about, for everybody disliked him.
As well as being constable, he was bailiff
in connection with the Small Debts Court,

and if he got a chance, people were put to as
much trouble as possible, A woman whom
he had treated harshly in this way one day
went up and threw a dipper of hot water on
him, for which offence she was imprisoned a
week, but he did not have the satisfaction
of selling any of her furniture, as friends
-came to the rescue and paid the debt.
At the first general election in 1.843, a
targe cask of ale was deposited on the main
street of the Settlement, and anyone who
wished could go and have a few drinks, The
pilot's crew got on the spree and attacked the
cripples, and it took this constable all his
time to look after them. Two boys also
started to fight, and be proceeded to lock
them up, but the crowd took their part and
prevented him. Some got fifty lashes, and
others twelve months in irons, while three
men were fined for not assisting the police.
As usual, the crutch and stick were freely
used. The pilot afterwards brought his men
to court, and some of them got a week in the
cells for abuse. Most of the men, however,
would rather have had "50" than go to the
cells, which were infested with vermin.
This constable once got information that
there was a private still some miles up the
jjver from the Settlement, and he lost ji»o


time in going to the Police Magistrate for a
search warrant. The granting of this war-
rant, however, was delayed till a message
was sent to the owner of the still, who was a
great friend of the magistrate, to put him on
his guard. And when the constable arrived
on the scene, the still was removed, and he
could only find warm bricks. The manager
of the still met the constable with " Good
evening ; it has been a warm day."
I 1
He said " Good evening," and proceeded
to read the warrant ; then went and opened
the trap-door to look for the still.

" What are you looking for?" asked the
manager, "can I do anything for you ?"
t < I
"Yes; get me some tea, please'" he re-
plied.
" Yery good," said the manager, " you had
better stop here to-night ; you must he tired
after such a long ride in the heat. When
<did you leave the Settlement ?"'
" Not soon enough to catch you," came
the reply.
•"Catch me ?" asked the manager. " Why,
you surprise me. What have f done?"
" You re very green," answered the con-
stable; " but I'll have you yet."
The constable searched all the next day,
but found no trace of the still, so the long


journey was for nothing. The fact was, this
still belonged to the aristocracy, who
could do almost as they pleased, but
it was nearly a case when the " broad arrow"
was put on a vessel in Sydney harbour on
her arrival from the Settlement with some
casks of grog aboard, and also the time that
a great quantity of grog was let loose in Port
Macquarie harbour one morning about break-
fast-time. This was hushed up somehow, for
there was not another word said about it.
9 ' r'.fe ' '£{:
After this useless 6earcb, the constable
offered a reward of £2O to any man who
would go and stop for a while at the places
where this sly grog was sold, but he couldn't
get -anybody to go, so he never caught them.
Many a wool-grower lost his sheep through
the sly grog-sellers. The liquor was made at

, and publicly sold
on the New England road,.without a license.
But as it came from , there was no notice
taken of it by those whose business it was to
remedy such evils.
On a Sunday, about this time, a ship ar-
rived at the Settlement with a number of
Government girls on board, who were all as
drunk as they could be, and this constable, as
usual, was down to see them land. The first
thing they did, when landed, was to ca'ch


hold of him hy the two shoulders and legs,
and threw him into the sea. They treated'
Lankoy, tlie fiogger, in a similar manner, and
if it had not been for the interference of the
onlookers, they would probably have drowned
both of tneni, for they were looked upon as
the greatest ruffians of girls that had yet
landed in the Settlement. After considerable
trouble all were safely landed in the lock-up,
and if there was fun on Sunday, there was
still more on Monday, when they were
brought before the Bench. Here they swore
like troopers, and called the magistrates
everything they could think of; but this did
no good, for they got 12 months more added
to their sentence. One of them, when
leaving the court, hit a bystander across the
mouth with her shoe, and for this she
received still another 12 months. Imprison-
ment, however, only made them worse, and
shortly afterwards they were sent back to
Sydney. The captain of the ship which
brought these women was fined £2O for
allowing them to have drink, and he also
lost his certificate.
This constable had one good point, and it
was that he would neither take tip nor
drink from anyone, and if he told a man he
would have him, that man had to look out or

he was run in. Eventually his services as
constable were dispensed with, and he after-
wards opened an hotel. The case was altered
now, for the men on whom he had been so
severe used to go and 'stick up' drinks, and
never pay for them. Any of the »ueu who
could get into his books only grinned at him,
and told him to go to a warmer climate when
asked for payment. " You cannot put us
in the lock-up as you could once, you o d
brpte ; it is our turn now. Neither can you
stop us and smell our breath, for we have
smelt yours," they used to tell him. " Let
us have a couple more drinks, and then we
will pay you for the whole lot," and so on.
got five gallons of beer out of
Tom
him, and tendered him a {< joey" in payment
for it. He found out after Tom had gone,
and went after him. Tom only laughed and
told him to go up to Mr. So and So, and he
would get the cash, but he never got it.
Everybody took a delight in swindling
him ; they did not forget the times when he
dragged them before the court and had thera
flogged, just to show the P.M: what a strict
man he was.
One night he was having a snooze :n his
easy chair on the verandah of the hotel, when
a man who knew him well, from a flogging


point of view, got some pepper and put it
under his nose, and the noise he made sneez-
ing was nearly as good as a hrass band.
At last he became insolvent, and every-
thing he had was sold under the hammer;
then he went to Sydney, much to the satisfac-
tion of all. There he would rent a house, and
in a short tiaie make a " moonlight flit" and
let the landlord in for the rent. This game
O
did not last long, though, for he met one who
knew as much as he did, and he put the
bailiff in and sold him off'
Constable, No. 2, was a different man to
this, for he would take tips and drink with a
man, put him in the lock-up, him out again,
and then tell another constable so that he
could arrest the same man and get a few
shillings. "He was a flash, stuck-up fellow,
and thought more of himself thau anyone
else did—but he would drink with all sorts
of men, no matter who they were. He was
plucky, though, for once when six men took
to the bush, he and some armed soldiers
went after them. These six men were
located in a house, and the constable ran up
to the window, pointed a pistol through, and
told them to surrender up their firearms and
ome out one by one, which they did. A
soldier shot one of the runaways in the arin,

which was a cowardly thing to do when the
men had given up their firearms, and had no
other means of defence. They were only
possessed of a few shillings, which they
scattered about the ground. These offenders
did little or no harm, and were only a set of
cowards after all to let one man take them.
This was all the better, however, as if they
had stuck cat there mast have been blood
spiit, for this constcble declared that if there
had been any pluck in them, they could have
shot him and the soldiers into the bargain.
These men were sent to Sydney a few days
after being arrested, and finally to IN or folk
Island. One of them got hurt while at Nor-
folk Island, returned to Fort Macquarie, and
died.
This was not the only plucky cap-
ture that the constable made, for he and
another look three armed bushrangers on the
road leading to the Manning River. One of
these men was from Lake limes, and was'
doing a term of 12 months for knocking a
man down in company with three others.
After getting out of the iron gang he was
sent to a road party, from which he took to
the bush, and when arrested was sent to Nor-
folk Island for life.
When this constable went to Sydney with


a few prisoners on one occasion, he got into
the company of some soldiers and officers,
and to them he passed as a captain. They
invited him to dine with them in his uniform,
hut he had no other uniform than the convict
dress, and this invitation took the " wind
out of his sails. ' When the officers found
out how nicely they had trapped him, they
tried to ascertain his whereabouts, but he
had returned to Port Maequarie where he
posed as what he really was. The officers
afterwards found out where he was, and
wrote to the Police Magistrate regarding the
incident. Toe P.M. then accosted hirn, and
he said : " I made as much of myself in
Sydney as I could, and no one could blame
me for it."

Some time afterwards this constable
became sick and died, and thus ended his
career.

AT HOLLANDS PLAINS.

direction, and derived its name from Surveyor
Hollands, who laid it out. This place was
made a farming centre some time after a
settlement was formed at Port Maequarie, as
it was considered good country both for
agricultural and pastoral pursuits.
Early in the forties a road party was
picked out of the men who were in the main
Settlement, and they were despatched to
Hollands Plains for road-making purposes—
many of the thoroughfares which remain
there at the present time being the outcome
of the labour of these men.
About this time there was a doctor residing
at the Plains, and as an experiment to make
some kind of ointment, he had several large
cedar boxes constructed, each one being of
sufficient size to hold the carcases of four
< ; *
bullocks. In due course the cases were filled
with the dead oxen, and the four boxes
lowered into the bed of the creek—the
supposition being that in a certain length of
time all the flesh and fat would become
separate substances. The boxes had not
been under water long, however, before
heavy weather came on, which caused the
creek to become flooded, and the encased
oxen were swept down stream. When the
flood waters subsided search was made for


these cases, but only one was found, and it
was fillf-d with sand, mud, etc. So the
doctor's loss was considerable, as the cedar
boxes alone were worth some money.
During this flood most of the farms around
the place were in a state of inundation, and
all kinds of farm produce was strewn about
in all directions ; cedar logs, which had been
washed down, were plentiful, too. The men
in the road party went about gathering theso
products, for it was seldom that they got
anything of the kind. They proceeded to
cook some potatoes which had been collected,
when the supposed owner of the " spuds"
came up and wanted to take a number of
sweet potatoes out of the pot whilst they
were boiling, claiming them as his property.
The men could not see losing the potatoes,
and blankly refused to give them up. Ho
then laid a complaint to the boss of the
party, who said : " Well, if you can swear
that nobody else about here has sweet
potatoes but yourself, you can take them."
But ihe hungry individual failed to do this,
and so had to go without his " murphys."
The weather cleared up, and the men in
the party were sent to assist the residents
near at hand to pull what remained of their
maize crops, and when the first day's labour

was over, they asked the farmer whom they
had been helping for some tea and sugar.
He looked at them for a moment, and then
answered: "I will not give you ad— bit;
you have stolen plenty of potatoes and
pumpkins, and if you don't help me finish
the corn-pulling, I'll get jour rumps tanned.
Since the road party came here, 1 can't keep
fowls, turnips, cabbage, or anything else."
This was his thanks, and also his usual way
of doing business.
One young fellow tried to do the men in
the road party a good turn, by killing one of
his master's calves for them. But while he
was in the act of killing it, the calf bellowed
out and drew the master's attention, when
he ran up and caught the culprit, and go*
him six months in irons for trying to do
others a good turn.
CHAPTER XII.
THE FEMALE CONVICTS.
"Be to her virtues very kind,
Be to her faults a little blind."
It was not an unusual thing in the old
days to see one or more of the female


convictn sitting in stocks about the streets of
Settlement, suffering a recovery from
drink. Most of these women were quite
equal to their liquor, like the men, when
they could get it. The principal drink was
rum, and nice stuff it was, too ; there was
plenty of tobacco juice in it, so that when
anyone got two or three drinks aboard, they
were in a fairly muddled state. When a
man went into an hotel, the cry was gener-
ally : " Shout, now, or out you go!" and
some of the publicans kept a plate of salt
herring on the counter, and it goes without
saying that they soon got paid for the fish.
Two servants, Polly and Sarah
' ! 1
i ' i
:
•ff #
, used to be employed at one of the
hotels, and the fact that they each had a
sweetheart was well known to almost every-
body. These tvpo servants were working
away in the hotel as usual one day, and there
was a good gathering of men discussing
different matters not far away. While thus
assembled they noticed these two girls at the
hotel, and the conversation immediately
drifted on to them. This wound up in
betting me a bottle of ruin that I could not
start the two fighting. lat once undertook
the contract, proceeded up to Polly, and,
pointing to Sara'b, said: "Sh6 pretends to

be a great friend of yours, doesn't she ■?"
Yes," was the reply. " Well, I said,
" you should hear the way that she runs you
and your sweetheart down." I got her suffi-
ciently excited in this way, and then went to
IS a rah and told her the same things about
Polly. They flew at each other in a terrible
rage, and fought like two cats, then I com-
menced to laugh and to think how nice the
rum would be. But they found out the joke
also, when the crowd began to laugh, and it
was a good job for me that I could run well,
as they each picked up a clothes prop and
chased me for my life. I then went and got
my rum.
Polly was sent to this country for trying
to poison her uncle and aunt to get their
money. She had not been long in the
Settlement before she became intimate with
a man who was sent from Sydney for having
sore legs. One day she quarrelled with
this fellow, and, when night came on, she
attempted to commit suicide by taking a
dose of oxalic acid. The poison was taken
shortly before retiring to bed, when she laid
out a number of clean underclothes on a
table in the servants' room, and said to her
mate: iS Sarah, to-night when I'm dead, I
want you to put these clothes on me ; I had
k ; -»


& row w1 ■ h Jack to-day, and I've taken some
oxalic acid, as 1 don't wish to live any
longer."
Sarah was tbunder-stricken at this state of
affairs, and when she recovered herself, said :
" You big fooi; 1 would not poison myself
for all the sore-legged brutes in the world."
She then went and told the boss of the hotel
all the circumstances, and in a few minutes
the whole house was in a state of confusion.
The doctor arrived, and the police also came
on the scene. The former took the necessary
steps to extract the poison from her, while
the latter inquired into the circumstances
and " wet their whistle." After a few days
Polly got better, and was then sent to the
lock-up for a week for being silly.
Afterwards she returned to the hotel, and
made it up with the rotten-legged man—ho h
the servants then getting into their usual
habit of going out at night to meet their
sweethearts. One night the boss forbade
them to go out, as his wife was ilf with an
abscess on her arm. They, however, would
not be baffled after making an appointment,
so they dressed up two " dummies, and
affixed a melon with a night-cap on as a
head-piece for each, giving anyone the
impression at first sight that they were boln

in bed and asleep. Towards the middle of
the night the boss went to their door and
called them, as his wife's arm was very
painful, and she wanted another poultice
no answer, so opened
the door, looked in, and believed both of
them to be asleep. Finally, he walked over
and shook one of them, but when one of
the night caps rolled off, and the melon
oecame exposed to view, his language of
flowers was not choice.
CHAPTER XIII.
SOME PRACTICAL JOKES
"A little devilment now and then,
la indulged in by the best of men."
— ANON.
A crowd of men were assembled in tho
main street of the Settlement one night, and
as everything was very quiet, and the place
seemed to be practically dead, they decided
to try and make some fun. A crotchety old
couple lived in a house not far away, so it
was suggested and agreed that a commence-
ment be made on them. Two tom-cats were
caught and knotted together with wire, and
\ V


swung across the knob of the front door.
There was a continuous strain of cats' music
for a few seconds, and then Old
opened the door, only to receive a nasty
scratch from one of the cats as he did it.
The crowd lay in ambush watching the pro-
ceedings, and enjoying the fun immensely,
and the next thing they saw was a knife on
the end of a stick being used to cut the cats
asunder ; but wire was not so easily cut, and
this only tended to increase the music, as one
of the " toma" received a gash occasionally,
Finally, when everything failed, he got a
clothes-prop and lifted them off the door-
knob, carried them down to the wharf, and
hurled them into the river. So the play
ended.
' |
Two conspicuous individuals in the Settle-
ment were always quarrelling over a girl, so
it was decided to persuade them to fight a
duel, and this was arranged after a little
difficulty. An hour was then appointed on
a certain day, when they should both put in
an appearance on the beach, there to settle
all disputes. The day came, and the men
turned up. Two pistols were handed to
them, each one being loaded with thick
bullock's blood, and a substantial wad
separating it from the powder. The two

Stood up, shook hands, then walked a fev*
paces, and, turning round, fired at each other.
Both were now besmattered with blood,
and thought that they were really wounded.
I thought the spectators would never stop
laughing, but at last the duellers saw through
the joke, and after this similar events were
at a standstill.
" Flash " was a well-known
character in the Settlement in former days,
and was a carpenter by trade. He built a
house for a colonel's wife once, and when it
ja *
was finished she would not pay him. But
he had bought liquor from her on several
occasions, and when she refused to pay him
he informed on her, and she was fined £3O
for sly-grog selling.
A tall old fellow, named S , used to
. •
be a kind of " flunky" in Port Macquarie,
and he was a great rum-drinker. His bed
was near the window in a house facing the
main street. Fish were biting well, and one
night a shovel-nosed shark was landed. This
old fellow was lying in his bed drunk, so it
was arranged to have some fun with him.
The shark was carried up; one of the crowd
raised the window gently and pulled the
blankets off him, while another lowered the
shark in on top of him. The fish naturally


'began to wriggle, and all that the crowd
heard as thev made a hurried exit, was
" Murder !" " murder !!" The next morning
a lifeless shark lay scenting the street
gutter.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE ABORIGINES.
"Gimme 'bacca, you pleas, massa,"
— AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL.
Aboriginals were plentiful in the forties,
and they had the " run of their knife" then
a little more than they do now. A murder
amongst them was a common occurrence,
and not infrequently was a head severed
from a body in a quarrel over a bottle of
rum. Occasionally they went further than
this, for several members of a white family
were murdered by blacks at Rollands Plains.
The father of this family was a sawyer, and
they killed him first while working at a cedar
tree in the bush. The house containing the
mother and children was then attacked, but
the mother, it is supposed, on hearing the
blacks trying to enter the house, threw her
infant, only a few months old, out of the
hack window, and this child was the only
pal

member of the family that escaped, it
being found the day afterwards. The
perpetrator of this deed was a black fellow
named " Terra mid gee," who paid the penalty
by being hanged in front of the Port
Macquarie Gaol. To act as a warning, all
the aborigines around the Settlement were
collected together to witness the punishment.
It did not appear to be much of a warning,
however, as about the year 1849 another
cedar-cutter was murdered on the upper
portion of Hollands Plains. This sawyer
had adopted a young aboriginal, and when
considered old enough to learn, he was sent
to school in Sydney. After being away for
some years he grew into a fine youth, and
on returning, used to assist his master with
the cedar. Two or three years elapsed in
this way, until one day a tribe of blacks
came to the old sawyer and demanded tobacco
and rations, which he refused to give them.
This colored youth, however, whose name
was ll Mogo Gard," made the necessary
arrangements with the other aboriginals to
murder the master that night, which was
accordingly done, and they cleared the hut of
everything and took to the bush. When the
murder became known, the police were
communicated with, and, on arrival, they
wvN*.


suspected " Mogo," and shortly afterwards
he was arrested and conveyed to Port
Macquarie. He was placed in heavy irons,
tried, and afterwards transferred to Sydney,
where a sentence of death was passed on him.
When the vessel which conveyed this mur-
derer to Sydney entered the Heads, he
attempted to jump overboard, but was
noticed in time to be prevented from doing
so, At the gallows, when the rope «was
being put around his neck, he looked at the
hangman, and said ; " No, bale you put 'im
that place, you put 'im here," pointing to his
waist. But he had to pay the last penalty
of the law. He was a tremendous man,
standing six feet seven inches in height,
besides being broad in proportion ; and was
a splendid specimen of the Australian
aboriginal.
Amongst the other aboriginals who were
in the main Settlement was a notorious thief,
named " Micky," who was also a splendidly-
built blackfellow. I caught him one day
stealing money from a man who was stopping
at Galley's hotel. I informed on him, and
the magistrate ordered him to be given 50
lashes. In due course he received the
hogging, and at every smack, he said, "By
G—, G——, I not Guv'ment man!"


& ;T ;
"2 * •££ .jfc
Once I had a keg of rum, and when I was
away from home " Micky" used to break in
and steal it; so I vowed at last that I'd get
even with him. I had some laudanum on
hand, which I used for my eyes, so I got a
bottle, put some rum in it, and then added
some of the laudanum. This I left in a con-
venient place for him, and went away as
usual to my work. Sure enough the bait
was taken, and then he lay asleep on the
road for a day and a-half. I was driving a
cart at the time, and would have driven over
him (for he was a terrible thief) only I was
afraid the cart would be tracked, and I'd get
into trouble. *• Micky" did not come back
for any more rum,

Perhaps the cleverest piece of work ever
clone by an aboriginal in the Settlement, was
carried out by " Charles Merriman," a well-
. ; -
known blackfellow. On one occasion some
prisoners bolted from the gaol, and a black-
tracker was wanted. " Merriman" was the
chosen tracker, but did not seem to care
about the billet. He, however, was forced
to accompany two policemen in search of the
runaways, and was attired in the usual
uniform of a policeman. As they travelled
away from the town on horseback, the police
noticed that the tracker was going very much

against his will. At last when (hey had gone
six or seven miles out, he asked one of the
police to hold his horse saying : " I teen see
it something up in the ferns, there." He ran
up into the tall ferns, picked up a stick, took
the cap oil and placed it on top of the stick,
which he stuck in the ground, so that only
the cap could be seen above the ferns. He
then made a bee-line for the Settlement.
Some time elapsed, and the constable rode up
to see what he was doing, only to find,
much to his disgust, that, snake-like, " Mem-
man" had shed his coat.

A FREE MAN.
"I must have liberty

In 1843 I became a free man, and, after
the knocking about I had had for some years,
sought the most comfortable quarters I could.
I went to the " Speed the Plough" hotel,
which was kept by Mr, 0

found a good home, besides plenty to eat and
drink, and a good bed to sleep on. After a

few months, however, I decided to leave"
Port Macquarie and go to Sydney, from
whence I walked to Windsor, Parramatta,
and other places in search of work, Not
being successful in this direction, however, I
decided to wend my way back to Portland
eventually arrived overland at Maitland.
Here a constable came up to me and inquired
where I had come from, and " Was 1 free?"
I told him where I had been, and also that I
was a free man. He then asked me what
proof I had to show that I was free, and I
presented to him the pass that I had
received from the Police Office in Port Mac-
quarie. He looked at this for a little while,
and then informed me that it was no good,
and that I would have to go with him to the
lock-up, I told him that it was a hard case
after serving my term to be shut up in the
lock-up again ; but he said that the pass was
no good, and he could not help it—so off I
went.

The next day I was brought before the

could buy a pass like the one I had for half-

On hearing this, he ordered the nonstable to
take me away, and bring me up again next
morning, when he would sentence me to 100
lashes. " That," I said, "is more than you

Instead of being brought up again the
next morning, I was sent away to Newcastle
X3aQt for identification. I here X was kept
three weeks, until one afternoon Major 0

night.
The next day Old Tim came into the lock-
up, where I and some others were, JBEe gave
them orders to do something but I
was not on a par with other prisoners, and so
.did not comply with it. He sang out to me,
Here, you with the whiskers, stand up and
let me see you J " I stood up, and as soon as
lie saw me he said, "Tour face is quite
familiar to me; you'te been here often, and
it's not the first time you've tried the same
.dodge, you scoundrel 1 " I said, "You've
never seen me before, Tim," and at being
called Tim he got into a terrible rage, while
I stood grinning at him. Then he said, "By
»G—, if you're not free, I'll get it sent home
to yoUj you saucy b——- J " Then he left,

and one of his flash subordinates came info
the lock-up with the " hominy," and he told
me that if I were not a free man I would
catch it, as the super, was in a great rage at
being called " Tim."
At 10 o'clock the same day I was sent
into the office before Mr. R , and "Tim"
was there to see how things went. I was
put under the stand to have my height
tested, and my marks were taken, the result
of the examination being that my freedom
was proved. A paper to this effect was
handed to me before leaving the office, and 1
shook it at " Tim" as I left.
When I was put into the lock-up, I was
possessed of three shirts, a razor, a new silk
handkerchief, and a new pair of trousers. I
asked the lock-up-keeper for them, but was
only pushed out and told to go to

I now started a second time to walk from
Sydney to Port Macquarie—a distance of
over 200 miles with ninepence in my pocket
with which to buy food on the journey. I
got along all right-until I reached the A. A.
Company's land near Stroud, where I was
almost starving. Coming through this land*

however, I came by good fortane on a camp
in which there was a piece of damper about
a week old, which I gladly ate, and I would
have eaten it had it been a year old, for it
was a matter of eat what you could get.
I could not swim then, nor have I learned
since, consequently, when I came to a river,
I either had to cross it at the head, or else
lash some dead timber together, make a raft,
and get across the rivers in that manner.
Finally I arrived at the Manning river,
and at this place had a peculiar experience
with a woman named Miss —, She stuck
me up with a pistol, asked me my name and
also where I had come from. I gave her
these particulars satisfactorily, and she then
asked rae if I were free, and to show her my
freedom. I told her that I had travelled all
the way from Sydney, and she was the first
woman policeman I had met. After this she
wanted me to take a letter to Port Mac-
quarie for her, but 1 declined, and notwith-
standing that she assured me it was not
heavy, I told her to take it herself, as it was
only fifty miles. So I proceeded to Port
Macquarie without the letter after her
impudence to me, and arrived there two
days later. It was not long after this before
I got constant work.

CHAPTER XVI.
THE YACHT " WANDERER."
4< She walks the waters like a thing of life,
And seems to dare the elements to strife. "•^-BYRON,
On Saturday, November 15, 1851, there
was great excitement in Port Macquarie, for
this was the day on which, in attempting to
cross the bar at the entrance to the harbor,
the yacht " Wanderer" had become a total
wreck. This yacht had sailed nearly all
round the world, besides to a good many
islands in the Pacific. She was owned by a
inan named Boyd, and was a picture as she
appeared on the ocean in full sail. This un-
fortunate man, however, went ashore at the
Island of Guadalcama, where the ship had
been prior to coming to Port Macquarie, and
never returned to the yacht again, the supr
position being that he was murdered by the
natives. There were four white men on board
the " Wanderer" when she arrived at Port
Macquarie, who were:—Captain Ottowel),
master; Mr. Webster, artist; Mr. Barnes,
botanist ; and Mr. Crawford (Boyd's nephew),
mate. Besides these there were a number of
natives from different islands, and one of the
publicans in Port Macquariegofc the "nigge^

dancing in his hotel to draw custom.
All the men came ashore from the wreck
on rope, and, save a little wetting, were none
the worse for their experience. The wreck
was sold to a local man. On hoard the ship
were some beautiful paintings and views of
the different places that the yacht had visi?
ted, besides many skulls, native implements of
war, shells, and many other things. Amongst
the articles were suits of both the Emperor
of China and the Shah of Persia, and for a
wager two gentlemen of the town donned
these costumes and walked the streets.
the goods out of the vessel were afterwards
open to public view in a large store, and
some of the cannon balls and other material
which belonged to the yacht yet remain iq
Port Macquarie. The white men from the
yacht afterwards spent a good deal of their
time at Lake Innes, where they engaged iq
sporting and other pursuits.

its destination—the shore. They were not
specs very long; it was soon discernible that
they were boats, but who were the occupants
This was a question yet to be solved. The
pilot boat went off, but the people in the
other boats bore such a rough appearance
that the pilot was almost afraid to go
near them, At last a member of the pilot's
crew recognised one of the men in the strange
boats, and they then proceeded to go along-
side. A tale of shipwreck was now related.
It transpired that gome time previously one
of the shipwrecked crew had left Port

15?h October, 1850, bound for
went well with her until tlie 2nd day of
December following, when to the dismay of


all on board, the ill-fated vessel struck upon
a reef, known as the "Elizabeth Reef," at
11 o'clock on a Sunday night. There was
no hope of saving the ship. The passengers,
captain, and crew managed to leave the
wreck by means of the boats, and 48 souls in
all left the vessel, 32 being in the largest
boat, and 16 in a smaller one—the third and
smallest boat being used as a sea-anchor.
A course was then steered for Port
Macquarie, and after eight days and nine
nights their destination was safely reached
on the 11th December, when they landed at
a spot known as Boat Harbour. This object
was not accomplished, however, without the
usual adventures of the sea. Two gales were
encountered while in the boats, and it was
during the first of these gales, in the open
sea, that the third boat was made into a sea-
anchor, and they then lay-to till the weather
abated. The second gale arose when the
boats had made the coast, and were off a spot
known as Point Piomer, near Port Macquarie.
Here they again lay-to, but were driven to
the "south, the next place that land was
sighted being off the Camden Haven river.
~ r"»
From this place they s'ee ed north towards
Tacking Point, as some of those on board,
from previous experience of the coast, knew


where they were. On arrival at the Boat
Harbour, the boats being too large to enter,
the pilot boat brought a few of the ship-
wrecked persons in at a time till they were
all safely landed.

The experience at sea was a perilous one,
and those in the boats suffered terribly from
exposure. At one time it was thought that
the second largest boat and its occupants
were lost. A huge wave swept over her, and
for a short time she seemed swallowed up,
but a few seconds later she re appeared on
the crest of another wave,the occupants being
engaged in bailing water for their lives. A
box of gold valued at £30,000 was put into
the largest boat on leaving the ship, but
when the first gale was encountered it had
to ! e jettisoned, as well as all the passengers'
clothes, with the exception of what they
wore, in order to lighten the boat. There
was only a limited supply of food in the
boats, too, and a small quantity of this,
toge her with a cup of water, was served out
to each pers.on every day, be,cause they did
not knovv how long it would be before land
* ** r
was sighted. So that besides losing the
gold, the food supply in the boats was nQtip
IQQ large,


CHAPTER XVII.
ESCAPE OF PRISONERS.
"Liberty's in every blow !
Let us do or die." —BURNS.
After the convicts left Port Macquarie',
the gaol was made a kind of relieving place
for other gaols in the colony which became
overcrowded, and at times there were a good
many prisoners within its walls. About the
year 1866, six prisoners who were evidently
full of being shut up in the large brick
structure overlooking the Pacific ocean, were
successful in making their escape. This they
accomplished by digging a hole in the wall
with a piece of an old knife, the work
extending over a period of several weeks.
The floor of the gaol was not right on the
ground, but built up somewhat, and therefore
an aperture existed between it and the
ground. A flooring board used to be removed
underneath one of the beds, and only one
man worked at a time, being relieved by
another when he had done his quota. It
was one morning about daylight that these
six men made their escape, and proceeded
along the Old Lake road (which leads from
Port Macquarie to Lake Innes), removing

the leg irons which they wore as soon as the
bush was reached. They walked along the
road one behind the other, leaving a track
which appeared as though only ons man had
traversed the road. Arriving at Lake Innes

thev secured breakfast, and sought firearms,
but the residents at the Lake at that time
(not Major Tnnes) told the prisoners that
they possessed no guns. The six men were
afterwards seated on a log eating their
breakfast when a Port Macquarie citizen,
who had heard of their escape, galloped to
Lake Innes and fired a gun over the
runaways' heads. This naturally had the
effect of scattering them, and they proceeded
further south to the Green Hills, near the
Camden Haven river, and hid in ambush.
Whilst all this had been going on, the
police were informed of their escape, and
went in search of the men. They, however,
did not effect a capture, although the
prisoners saw them go past while they lay
hidden in the bush, and thoy returned

unsuccessful.
In crossing Kathie Greek, which lies
to the south between Port Macquarie and
the Green Hills, one of the escapees was
stung by a stingray ; and he in company with
another afterwards gave themselves up to

captured by the police on the New England
road, about 20 miles from Port Macquarie.
CHAPTER XVIII.
A LAST WORD.
"Man's inhumanity to man
Makes countless thousands mourn.' '
Burns
Such was the life in Old Port Macquarie.
But what does it all matter now? Did any
of the tyrants ever derive any benefit by
hounding down and torturing their fellow-
men? Nay! most of those whose career 1
have followed did no good, while some died
like dogs. They say that there is punishment
for doers of harsh deeds this side of the
grave, and if ever this fact were realised, it
was by many of those heartless wretches who
gloried in driving their subordinates to
desperation day by day. Thank Heaven I
have lived all this down, and although
< < declined into the vale of years,'' still lam
<r] a d to know and say that there yet remains
a gleam of sunshine, as there is a silver lining
to every cloud, for me to enjoy in my
I•: '-V''
latter days. / 1
