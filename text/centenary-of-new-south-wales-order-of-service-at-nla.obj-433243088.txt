I.—lOOth Psalm.
Tune —Old Hundredth.
ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice ;
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
Know that the Lord is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make :
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto :
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
For why ? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
ll.—Prayer of Thanksgiving.
O ALMIGHTY God, King of kings and Lord of
lords, who blessest the nations with increase,
and appointest for them the bounds of their habitation,
we Thy humble servants desire to offer unto Thee our
heartfelt thanks, that, in the past hundred years, Thou
hast granted to this Colony by continual growth to
enter more and more on the great heritage, into which
Thou hast called us. We confess that through our
manifold sins we have been unworthy of even the least
of Thy blessings ; but we thank Thee that Thy grace
and mercy have still been with us, and that Thou hast
given us abundantly more than either we desire or


deserve. Thou hast kept us from all dangers, and
granted unto us riches and peace; Thou hast taught and
guided us in Thy wisdom and righteousness; Thou
hast given us light and freedom, and called us to grow
to our appointed place among the nations of the
world. For this Thy great and exceeding goodness,
0 Lord, we magnify Thy glorious name, evermore
praising Thee and saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
God of Hosts, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory;
and we pray that we may have grace to show forth
Thy praise in our own lives and the life of this our
country, and to let our light so shine before men, that
they may glorify Thee, the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who liveth and reigneth, with Thee and the
Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end. Amen.
OUR Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy
name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in
earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them
that trespass against us, and lead us not into tempta-
tion, but deliver us from evil : For thine is the king-
dom, and the power and the glory, for ever. Amen.
lll.—Address.
The Most Rev. The Primate.
IV. —Praise the Lord.
Tune —A ustria.
PRAISE the Lord ! Ye heavens adore Him.
Praise Him, angels, in the height;
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him ;
Praise Him, all ye stars and light.
Praise the Lord ! for He hath spoken ;
Worlds His mighty voice obeyed.
Laws which never shall be broken,
For their guidance He hath made.


Praise the Lord ! For He is glorious ;
Never shall His promise fail;
God hath made His saints victorious
Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation !
Hosts on high, His power proclaim ;
Heaven and earth and all creation,
Laud and magnify His name. Amen.
V. —Address.
The Rev. Hr. Steel,
VI. —All hail the power of Jesus’
name.
Tune —Miles Lane.
ALL hail the power of Jesus’ name !
Let angels prostrate fall,
Bring forth the royal diadem
To crown Him Lord of all.
Crown Him ye martyrs of our God,
Who from His altar call;
Extol the Stem-of-Jesse’s Rod,
And crown him Lord of all.
! Sinners whose love can ne’er forget
The wormwood and the gall,
Go, spread your trophies at his feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.
Oh that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all. Amen
Vll.—Address.
The Rev, Dr, Kelynack


VIII.—The Church’s one Foundation
Tune— A urelia.
riTHE Church’s one foundation
JL Is Jesus Christ her Lord ;
She is His new creation
By water and the word :
From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride ;
With His own blood He bought her,.
And for her life He died.
Elect from every nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One law, one faith, one birth
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses
With every grace endued.
(’Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
( Sing j She waits the consummation
softly.) | Of peace for evermore ;
| Till with the vision glorious
L Her longing eyes are blest,
(Sing f And the great Church victorious:
loudly.) \ Shall be the Church at rest.
Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won ;
Oh, happy ones and holy !
Lord, give us grace that we
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high, may dwell with thee.

IX. —Address.
The Rev. Dr. Jefferis.


X.—Prayer.
OGOH, our Heavenly Father, we adore Thee as our
God and King, God over all, blessed for ever.
Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and Thy
dominion is from generation to generation. Thou art
Governor among the nations, and it is Thine to lift up
and to cast down. Blessed is the nation whose God is
the Lord. Thou hast in Thy Word directed that sup-
plications and prayers he made for all men—for Kings
and all that are in authority. We pray for those, in
all lands, who have been set to rule, and especially for
our own gracious Sovereign, whom Thoii hast preserved
so many years to reign over us for our great good.
Guide her by Thy counsel, guard her by Thy holy
arm, sanctify her by Thy grace, and comfort her with
the fellowship of Thy love. May she be spared, yet
years not a few, to reign over us, and, finally, may she
receive the crown of righteousness, which the Lord
giveth to all them that love Him ! With her we pray
Thee to bless the Prince and Princess of Wales and all
the members of the Eoyal family. Let Thy merciful
favour be shed abundantly over the Empire of which
we form a part, and do Thou, who hast the hearts
of all men in Thine hand, so overrule all things,
that peace may be maintained among the nations of
the earth. May it please Thee to bless this Colony
and all our sister Colonies in this Southern World.
Bless our Governor and his advisers, our Houses of
Parliament, our Courts of Justice, that this our land
may be ruled according to Thy wise and righteous will.
Bless our University, our schools and colleges, and all
seminaries of sound learning throughout the land.
Bless all our national institutions, and prosper every
lawful industry. Hear the cry of the needy, and let
the sick and the sorrowful share Thy tender pity.
Bless abundantly all within our borders—rich and poor,
old and young. Let the people praise Thee, O Lord,
yea, let all the people praise Thee. Let Thy rich


blessing descend on the Church Universal, and grant
that Thy Holy Spirit may be poured out upon her
abundantly as a spirit of unity, love, and power.
Bless and prosper, we beseech Thee, our Missions at
home and abroad, and all the work of the Church for
her Lord, and may the time soon come when Thy way
shall be known on earth and Thy saving health among
all nations ! Guide us, 0 Thou Great Jehovah, in all
the stages of our future history as a nation, so that, as
century after century rolls over us, we may with
increasing gratitude and fervour exclaim with Thy
people of old ; ‘ ‘ The Lord hath done great things for
us, the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we
are glad. Blessed be the Lord our God, who only
doeth wondrous things, and blessed be His Holy name
for ever, and let the whole earth be filled with His
glory. Amen and Amen,”
Xl.—The Hallelujah Chorus.
(Handel’s Messiah, Choir only.)
HALLELUJAH : For the Lord God omnipotent
reigneth !
The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of
our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign
for ever and ever.

Xll.—Benediction


XIIL—God bless our Native Land
Tune —God save the Queen.
GOD bless our native land,
Firm may she ever stand
Through storm and night;
When the wild tempests rave,
Ruler of winds and wave,
Do Thou our country save
By Thy great might.
(Sing softly.)
For her our prayer shall rise
To God above the skies,
On Him we wait.
Thou who art ever nigh,
Guarding with watchful eye ;
To Thee alone we cry —
God save the State.
(Sing loudly.)
God save our gracious Queen,
Long may Victoria reign,
God save the Queen !
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen !
Sydney ; Charles Potter, Government Printer.—lBBB.
