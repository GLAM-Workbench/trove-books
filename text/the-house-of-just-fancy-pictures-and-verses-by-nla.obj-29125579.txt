THIS PRETTY
HOUSE sprang up
straight from the grass.
It must have had a fairy
Carpenter and a goblin
Bricklayer.
No wonder the children
said, “IUST FANCY!”
They wished they
could have seen them
especially the Brick-
layer.

HERE’S a dear little
girl!
Her name, we think,
is Cherry Blossom.
Just look at her
lovely lanterns!
Would you light them
every night, if they
were yours?




THEY THOUGHT
she was only playing at
first ;
But Cherry Blossom
ran, and ran, and ran,
and left them so lonely.
She never looked back,
either —
And she took the very
best lanterns.
Fancy a Cherry Blos-
som behaving like that!

MUSNT IT BE
BEAUTIFUL to have
a little garden, and a
Stork like this in the

He was so agreeable,

not so big.

AND HERE IS THE
QUEEN breaking cups,
and not taking any
notice of her visitors!
If only she would wave
her wand properly, the
fairies would come run-
ning in from under the
trees, and dance for
them.
But you can see there
won’t be any dancing
to-day.
There must be some-
thing wrong with the
people who live in this
fairy-house.

EXCEPT THIS ONE.
You can see he is alright.
He stood under this
tree of balloons just to
make them laugh.
If only they had seen
him first, things would
have been different.
But now the sun is go-
ing down, and they
must run home.

AND HE STOOD
waving like this to them
till it was dark.
And then everything
went asleep.
And when the sun
came up next morning
they ran to play with
him, but oh, JUST
FANCY ! the House
wasn’t there!
Perhaps it will he found
again some day. May-
be YOU will find it.
You’ll easily know it
by the Queen’s Tower
and the white roses*

And then he gave them each a ro3e ;
Trey waved and said "Goodbye r
And Aome they went, while hdpgy birds
Sang sweet, on tree-top high.
When /Wrung- came-now,this is strange!
they went wljere they had been,
And only one while iamb was there,
And no Aouse to be seen !


AND WHEN YOU
KNOCK you will hear
heavy feet coming.
That will be the Ele~
phant. He always
comes to the door. He
likes putting his trunk
out.
He thinks he’s funny.
So do we. And then,
just ask him how his
mother is, and WALK
RIGHT IN.
