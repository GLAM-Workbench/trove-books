AUSTRALIAN CULTURE HAS BEEN IMITATIVE.
IT MUST NOW BECOME CREATIVE.
Australia is now realizing that she is a nation just the same as England, America, and the other
nations, and has no need to ape their ways of living.
EXPRESSION of this new Australia-as-a-Nation Culture, and the education of the people of
this country and of overseas countries towards this new feeling, lies with our Creative Artists,
Writers, Poets, Talkers, Composers.
—These are the people who deal in words, sounds, pictures.
—Consequently they are the people who sense out such a feeling first.
Speedy TRANSMISSION of the feeling from Creator to the Public is dependent on the ease
with which he can utilize every medium of expression—the wireless, newspapers, films, literary
publications, art exhibitions. This ease (or hardship) is determined by the attitude of the
government and other sigh authorities, whether it is red-taped tradition-bound, or whether it
is flexible and responsive to new thought and feeling.
The Public themselves often hinder transmission. The average man strives for normality (the
best dressed man is the man whose clothes you do not notice). Since expression by Creators
must necessarily look ahead, their works, when viewed by the average man, will be "NEW" or
"DIFFERENT". This essential quality of DIFFERENCE troubles him because it conflicts with
his normality neurosis.
Whether they trouble the average man or not, the fact remains that the only worth-while addi-
tions to culture are the "DIFFERENT" works; those that, although deriving from the immediate
past, do not imitate the past, but anticipate future living conditions.
POSITION OF ART IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Art in South Australia affords an excellent example of how a major means of creative expression
can be rendered so useless when under the control of imitation and imitators that it not only
adds nothing positive and beneficial to the culture of the nation, but exerts a negative and
detrimental influence through the spread of wrong conceptions.
Art in South Australia HAS been imitative. It has been a dummy art founded on imitation of
the past; founded on imitation of the closest-to-nature-trick-techniques of Royal Academicians,
or, a bit closer home, to the few romantic discoverers of the Australian palette: Heysen-and-
gum-trees, Streeton-and-panorama; resulting in popular-imitative-romantic watercolour after
popular-imitative-romantic watercolour right round the slumbering walls of exhibitions.
Popular imitative artists have combined with their critics to slander and condemn modern
creative art and exalt their own imitation doctrine. Working through a monopoly of press.


PROGRESSION ARTHUR BOYD


lectures, seniority-of-years-lending-authority, these popular artists and critics have prejudiced the
public of South Australia against contemporary creative work. Their frequent sly cracks at
modern art are invariably mere adjective-slinging statements, never constructive criticisms. They
are based on ignorance of, or disregard for, art discoveries of the last 70 years; are founded
on their lack of the conception of art as a process pointing to future living conditions—as, for
example, the process of Cezanne's search for inner structure helping the Cubist experiments
of Gris Braque Picasso, who, in turn, through Mondrian, to the modern Abstract painters like
Helion, help to clear the superfluous and irrelevant from modern life; or as, for the other
outstanding example, the process through Gaugin, the Fauves, Kandinsky, to the modern Sur-
realist efforts of Dali Miro, etc., who, by examination of the subconscious part of a man's mind
as well as the conscious, are helping towards a better understanding of man.
This nose in the air dismissal by old-boy authorities of the contemporary art in culture-
lacking State without thorough investigation, trial, and proof, won't do. These "representation-
of-nature-is-the-thing" gentlemen cannot make the mental effort to find out what the modern
artists are after. Art has outgrown them and they have been forced to fall back on their "it's
a fake" attitude to try to justify themselves, their own art, and their high art positions.
AUSTRALIA'S RESULTS FROM IMITATION.
Our results from saying England's fish are our fish, England's likes are our likes, England's dis-
likes are our dislikes —and settling down to our sleep in the sun;
Our results from (these decades of imitation) being left lacking a discriminating sense of values,
too young for, too lazy for, or incapable of, thinking out for ourselves and saying: This is good
and That is bad. That is right. That is wrong;
Our results (from these decades of imitation) by in the imitation frill-de-dill architecture of our
buildings, the low functional + aesthetic value of our houses, furniture, cooking utensils, clothes;
Can be seen in those victims who
Although they can see coloured shapes all their life—
cannot recognize other than the lower degrees of harmony, balance or rhythm;
Although they can hear sounds —
cannot recognize beauty of sound;
Although they can read and write—
surrender Day Lewis for a report of the last race.
THIS EXHIBITION is conceived as an exposure of the above state of affairs—as an explosion
of the imitation-representation-of-nature-or-nothing bubble. It is, therefore, a direct contribution
to clarify Creative Australian culture, and consequent world culture.
DOUGLAS ROBERTS
Childmind music that’ imitates the wood-sighs and the ripple-water; the sentimental labours of the
painter-craftsman for the gullible. Lovers of PICTURES and lovers of ART, and a mind-
world which interseparates the one within from the one without. What horrid eorrode-
crescences are on the brain-shell: bleached droplets, anaemic superfluities of the master-brow,
that are his, but not his essence; these are the IMITATORS: and I dreamsee the HOBBY-
borers, who suck the pleasure and know no painbearing. But the nucleus is SIGHT matter,
THOUGHT transformed, made vibrant, in a plasma of nerve-fibre.

TO THE GENUINE BEWILDERED.
You will see by looking at the pictures on these walls that art to-day is different from the art
of the past. Don't let that woriy you. Can't you see that change is inevitable, and, in fact,
as good as a holiday? These pictures are products of to-day, and they all reveal some facet
of the present. If some of them are too frank for you, doesn't that mean that you are afraid
to look the present in the face? My advice is SNAP OUT OF IT. Face up to reality and
give the world a chance of getting somewhere.
DAVID DALLWITZ
Organic force, complete in knowledge,
expressing ego out out and out,
larger deeper,
follows experience—expanding ego.
SHIRLEY ADAMS
Reduce
lines shapes and colours to their simplest forms;
Make them subservient to the expression
of—
architectural solidity of objects (perceived or imagined);
definite line or colour pattern,
or the expression of some emotional or spiritual impulse.
RUTH TUCK
The pain inflicted by impure composition has been needlessly prolonged. We seek a path to
the light.
Rare spirits there always have been who intuitively have attained perfection. The Doric column
is the very embodiment in marble of truths in form and proportion unerringly accurate, restated
after two thousands years with equal certainty in mathematical propositions. Thus is SCIENCE
the handmaiden of art. And so we may also enter the inner circle of truth where the Athenian
architect went before.
There are also those who have stated truth in the form and line of natural objects. If the
modern artist aspires with confidence to surpass this performance it is because he knows that
the path to the centre is made firm, step by step by the rational confirmation or rejection of
what is intuitively perceived.
TASMAN FEHLBERG
time and place kindle expression
which is self-justified.
JACQUELINE HICK
puppet painting of dynasties and religion was of fixed formulae and fear-inspiring to tyrannize
the masses. This phase culminated in the Jesuits' Counter-Reformation and the Inquisition.
Science freed art, delivering its collective power to individuals who use personal expression to
enlighten—hence the diversity of content. My painting is a weapon against oppressive con-
ditions and dishonest doctrines. And a caress of all that has suffered injustice—whether
tree or man. To expose: To reveal: the aim of my painting is to teach.
