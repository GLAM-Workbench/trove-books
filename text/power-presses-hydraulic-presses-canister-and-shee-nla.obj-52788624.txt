INTRODUCTION
JN presenting our 1936-37 Catalogue we desire to thank our
many friends and clients for the confidence and appreciation
which they have accorded our products in the past, and we
trust that the high standard of efficiency and production which we
have attained, will warrant a continuance of those favours which
have been so much appreciated by us.
Our long and comprehensive experience enables us to rapidly
estimate the requirements of clients, and, as all the lines manufactured
by us are not covered by this catalogue, we invite enquiries regarding
the production of any machine or article in the Sheet Metal or
Canister Trade which may be required. Any enquiry submitted
to us will receive our prompt attention and the benefit of our expert
knowledge and advice, as to the cost of Tools and/or Plant required,
and the most advantageous method of production.
We respectfully request clients favouring us with enquiries to
provide us with the fullest information regarding their requirements,
and, when possible, furnish us with drawings or sketches.
We also specialise in the manufacture of Dies of all description,
and by using only the highest grades of materials, which are
scientifically heat-treated and tested for hardness, our tools are
calculated to give a maximum of efficiency and service.

SPECIFICATIONS
ALL inclinable presses are of one piece casting type, rigidly
braced, and cast in the best fine-grained semi-steel,
thus ensuring a higher degree of rigidity than with ordinary
cast iron.
Action of presses is through a three-way hardened steel clutch
ring and key, which parts are carefully ground to size and
tested for hardness before insertion.
Inclining mechanism is fitted to the heavier types, from and
including type 3C.
All gears are machine cut, and are of long and short addendum
type, thus ensuring greater strength in pinion than in ordinary
standard type.
All parts are carefully made to standard sizes, and checked
before and after assembly.
We make a special feature of running in (under working
conditions) all machines manufactured by us, thus assuring to
clients well adjusted and efficient plant, which, if properly
cared for, we fully guarantee as to workmanship and
capacity as specified by us under each type of machine.

UPSTROKING HYDRAULIC
PRESS
TYPE 9 D
Incorporated in the design are many features which
must appeal to moulders in the plastic industry. Greater
travel of ram (which is accurately guided to dies by
four solid pillars) and adjustable Crown enables operator
to use as single or double day light, or to accomplish
deep drawn work.
A special feature is “Platen Heating,’’ which is of
the latest Chromalox strip type, with automatic thermo-
static control through a
range of from 250 to 400
degrees F.
No switches to attend
to, the operator, having
determined the desired
heat, simply sets pointer
on dial of thermostat to
the correct No. on dial,
and the thermostat auto-
matically controls the
current, cutting it on and
off as the heat falls or
rises, and is quite accur-
ate. Thus a saving of
current is effected. Pro-
vision is made in Platens
for thermometer as check.
Tests carried out on stan-
dard equipment proved
that heat was uniform
over Platen area, and
time required to heat from cold to moulding tem-
perature is approximately one hour. These Chrom-
alox Strips are guaranteed for two years. We
also have chase plate attachment, which we can
supply at extra cost.
Best grade materials are used throughout the
construction, the cylinder being of steel and all
other castings of semi-steel. The pump block is
of mild steel, with stainless steel valves and
seats.

general canister articles, with
locks to suit clients’ require-
ments.
More suitable for use on
the smaller size articles, we
produce a much smaller
machine than the above,
which operates at greater
speed, and thereby increases
production at less cost. Space
does not permit of illustra-
tion, but we will be pleased
to forward particulars on
application.
All main bearings and fly-
wheel are lined with best
phosphor bronze, and bear-
ings can readily be replaced
without interference with
main castings.
Action of machine is
through a three-way hard-
ened steel clutch ring and
key, which, on depression of
treadle, allows machine to
make one stroke and return
to top centre.
All castings are of the best
fine-grained semi-steel, thus
ensuring a higher degree of
rigidity than with ordinary
cast iron.

IRREGULAR DOUBLE SEAMING MACHINE
TYPE 5 P, 6 P, 7 P
Made in three standard
sizes, these are exceptionally
useful machines. They are
capable of seaming up, when
filled or empty (the con-
tainer remains stationery),
articles of almost any irre-
gular shape, also round cans.
The only change parts
that are necessary are trac-
ing chuck and footplate, both
of which, where capacity
admits, are interchangeable
with other sizes of machines.
The machine is so con-
structed that by inserting the
container in position, a de-
pression of the pedal is all
that it needed, the machine
completing the seaming oper-
ation, releasing containers
and cutting out clutch in-
stantly.
The seaming head always
stops in the same position in
relation to the chuck, thereby
allowing operator to insert
irregular work always in the
same way.
All parts are of rigid con-
struction, gears of steel and
pinions of phosphor
bronze, thus ensuring
H long life.
Main bearings lined
with phosphor bronze.

seaming operation, thus eliminating spill in filled containers, is in great demand
among packers of coffee, cocoa, and such dry products; also fruit, vegetables,
jam, meats, puddings, etc.
The revolving seamer head is
mechanically operated and is fully
enclosed when working.
All that is necessary is for the
operator to place container on
footplate, press the pedal and re-
lease it, when the machine will
carry container up to seaming
head, close it and return to feed
table.
Automatic can ejector is pro-
vided in seaming head.
Operating lever to friction drive
is conveniently place to give oper-
ator instant control.
As shown in the small cut,
covers with straight or curled
edges may be used.
Maximum rate of output, 30 per
minute.

AUTOMATIC CLOSING MACHINE
TYPE 9 P
SINGLE SPINDLE
A fast operating double seamer, having straight line feed and worm
selector. This machine has proved its worth in factories requiring a fast,
medium priced machine of this type.
A feature of this machine is our all
geared seaming head, which produces
a perfect seam with the minimum of
effort. A fool-proof lid divider places
cover in pocket on turret head, from
which position it is carried to seaming
station, and if no can is there the cover
is automatically ejected and can be used
again.
A "no can, no lid” device is incor-
porated, also lid marking gear is pro-
vided if ordered.
All driving mechanism runs in en-
closed oil bath.
Should a
jamb occur
anywhere in
mechanism,
an overload
release auto-
mati c a 11 y
cuts out cam-
shaft and
driving
clutch so that
if operator is
away no
harm is done

CURVING ROLLERS
TYPE R
The above machine is for use among tinsmiths and sheet metal
workers in general.
A special feature is that the top roll upon which the work is formed
can be quickly disengaged and swung outwards on a pivot, thus per-
mitting easy removal of the smallest tube.
Wiring grooves are provided for curving of wire, and also for
closing the wired edges of buckets, etc., either inside or outside type.
Rollers are independently adjusted.
Gears are machine cut and all bearings phosphor bronze, carefully
bedded in.

Four-speed gear box of automobile transmission type is incorporated,
with easy working ball lever. A special feature introduced is the fool-
proof device which, while machine is running, prevents operation of gear
lever, thus protecting the gears from breakages.
All gearing throughout is of best quality hardened steel. Control
levers are placed on right and left hand side and connected. Clutch is
of plate type, and as clutch is thrown out, a brake automatically stops
the ram. This feature is very useful in setting up.
Ram has angular adjustment up to 5 degrees, which enables operator
to machine undercut on dies, etc., and cuts out extra work on bench.
Table is graduated through 360 degrees, with four major locking
points. Tool post can also be revolved through 360 degrees and locked.
All bearings are lined with Naval Standard Phosphor Bronze.
All castings are in best grade semi-steel.
