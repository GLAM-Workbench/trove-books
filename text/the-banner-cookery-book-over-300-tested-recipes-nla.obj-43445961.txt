“M.S.K.”
Have yon ever tried this way of
mending a three-eornored tear. It is
very successful for linen and woollen
fabrics. Place the tom article on the
table with the wrong side up. Smear
the white of an egg evenly round and
over the tear. Then cut a pice of
linen or woollen material a little
larger than the tear, and place it
neatly over the rent so > that it ad*
keres to the white of the egg. Press
with a hot iron. The patch will not
come off even with occasional washing
and is not visible on the right side.

SALT IN JAM.
Mrs. Aug. Schulze, Dimboola.
Always add salt when making jam.
Tt helps to save the sugar and keep
the fruit. Half a pound of sugar and
a saltspoon of salt is the correct pro-
portion to use to a pound of fruit. If
making jam in large quantities, one
level teaspoon of salt is sufficient for
three pounds of fruit, and it is put
in at the same time as the sugar.
This practice was advised by author-
ities during the Great War, when
economy was so necessary and the pre-
servation of vitamins in food so im-
portant. The use of carb. soda for the
purpose was condemned, as this de-
etroys most vitamins and decreases the
food value to a very marked extent.
