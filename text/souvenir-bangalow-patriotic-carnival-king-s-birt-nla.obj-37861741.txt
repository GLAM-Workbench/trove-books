Patriotic Message to the People of the
Bangalow District.
From the Stale Premier,
The Hon . W. A. HOLMAN.
“The experiences of the past few months have proved
that war, with its attendant misery, pain and desolation,
is not all loss. That a World war, suddenly sprung upon
us by an ambitious materialistic people after long and
careful organisation and preparation, should have found
our peace-loving and peace-pursuing Empire comparatively
unprepared, is not surprising. But that it found a nation
still imbued with that quenchless spirit of adventure, self-
sacrifice and glorious endeavour which made England the
first Power of the world, proud to hear crushing blows
in battle, burning to avenge outrage on the weak, and
down-trodden, eager to right their wrongs, calm in dis-
tress and adversity, and confident in the surensss of vic-
tory, is something to have learned.
4 ' The same dauntless spirit that sustains our troops in
the darkest hour of battle may hearten those who stay at
home. Everyone cannot buckle on the sword; but there
are many tasks which lie to the hands of those who await
the outcome of the war. The various patriotic move-
meals for assisting those dependent upon our soldiers, the
subscriptions for the relief and succour of our plundered
and desolated Allies—the heroic Belgians, the provision
of comforts for the men in the field, are all worthy
avenues of activity for oar people.
“It is for us at home to bend our energies to these
tasks, to do our best to maintain the ordinary services of
the country aad her commerce, and realising to the fullest
the supreme nature of the struggle in which We are en-
gaged, to allow nothing to thwart our purposes nor to
blunt our determination. ”

From the Federal Member,
W. MASSY GREENE. Esq.. M.H.R.
“Germany is not beaten —she has got
to be. Nearly nine months have now
passed since England declared war
upon Germany —a period which has
sufficed to strip Germany of every
vestige of the veneer of her boasted
civilisation and reveal in all its hide-
ous reality the true inwardness of the
Germanic system which she would im-
pose upon the world —brute force de-
void of i.'.l that is humane, or noble, or
chivalrous, wherein truth and honor,
fair dealing and uprightness have no
place —n sort of civilised barbarism,
where might is the only right, which
if it triumphed would set back the
hands of the clock that mark the pro-
gress of the human race to almost pre-
historic times. That is why Germany
MUST be beaten. It behoves us with
our heritage of freedom and liberty,
who for so long have enjoyed in peace
and quietness the protection of that
flag which has always stood for justice
and humanity, which has ever led the
van in the forward march of progress
and civilisation, to see to it that so
much as in us lies we do our part in
carrying on this great fight of right
against wrong, until such time as we
can rest assured that never again
shall the accursed system of German
militarism curse the world."

A Naru Episode.
A soldier of the expeditionary force, who re-
turned to Sydney by the Navua from New Gui-
nea, was in the party of Australians sent to Naru
Island to effect the captuie of a notorious canni-
bal chief, who had for years defied the German
authorities.
“The island was a surpriss to us,” says the
returned soldier. “ The settlement was a model
town with streets lighted by electricity, and
electric power for the copra works, and for many
of the purposes of the white community. Yet
cannibalism flourished on the very edge of this
twentieth century development.
“ The chief was an outlaw, and he had a
strong following. Also, he had plenty of sym-
pathisers among the natives, and every German
attempt to get him failed. He was well-inform-
ed, beforehand, of every raid to be made, and
was away in the back country when the soldiers
arrived at his last camp.
“ Soon after we landed he swooped down one
night and got awav with three of the native
police. Next night their skulls, and some of
their equipment, were brought back to our
camp and dumped near a tent; the carcases had
been eaten.
“ But we got him, all right. A promise of un-
limited ki-ki (food) and a bullama-cow (tinned
beef) induced one of the chief’s own spies to take
a chance. He offered to go to the cannibal’s
camp and spear the chief in his sleep, if he were
assured of strong support by our men. He said
he was afraid to go by himself.
“He kept his contract; but’it was a close
thing for him. He lost his nerve at the last
minute, and instead of putting his spear, good
and hard, into the centre of the man-eater, he
stabbed him in the hand. It was a good thing
that he remembered to take us with him. With-
out us he would have been at breakfast —cooked
—with the cannibal chief. We dropped down
and nabbed our man, who fought like seventeen
demons, until some one thought to land him one
on the chin with a rifle butt.
“ We roped him up like a bale of bags and
took him to headquarters, where he was tried
and sentenced and shot, in about ten minutes.
Five native police made the ffring party, three
of the rifles being loaded with ball.
“ When a man went up with a handkerchief
to blindfold him, he pushed him away.
“ ‘ Shoot ’em,’ he said, ‘ me no frighten ! ’
“He was full of grit to the last. One bullet
took him fair between the eyes. That finished
cannibalism on Naru Island.”

TO OUR FALLEN.
Ye sleepers, who will sing you?
We can but give you tears —
Ye dead men, who shall bring you
Fame in the coming years ?
Brave souls—but who remembers
The dame that fired your embers?
Deep, deep the sleep that holds you
Who one time had no peers.
Yet maybe Fame’s but seeming
And praise you’d set aside
Content to go on dreaming.
Yea, happy to have died.
If of all things you prayed for—
All things your valour paid for —
One prayer is not forgotten,
One purchase not denied.
But God grants your dear England
A strength that shall not cease
Till she have won for all the Earth
Fiom ruthless men release
And made supreme upon her —
Mercy and Truth and Honour
Is this the thing you died for?
Oh, Brothers, sleep in peace.
R. E. Yernede.
Jlr Fisher, Prime Minister of Australia,
speaking in New Zealand on Naval Defence,
said: lam fully entitled, too, to claim that the
best and probably the only practical method a
safeguarding our interests is to maintain a na-
val force which is a direct part cf the British
Navy, but under locil executive control. . .
The day has already come wh c n self-respect
should persuade Australia and New Zealand to
abandon their policy of reliance upon the British
taxpayer. The two countries are not richer in
financial resources, but they are much richer in
productive power and their condition demands
that wo should bear at least cur full share in
our own defence and so co-operate in the defence
of the Empire.

THE NATIONAL FUND.
Australia is asked to contribute £75,000
a month.
New South Wales is asked to provide
£30,000 a month.
It has been accepted as an obligation by
Great Britain that the Belgian nation should
not be allowed to perish, and unless active,
prompt, and continuous help is afforded, they
cannot be saved. This obligation of Great Bri-
tain is unanimously shared by the people of
Australia, to whom an appeal has been made by
the International Commission to contribute
£75,000 per month, which sum will feed for two
days that portion of the Belgian nation which is
being sustained by the Commission.
Annual Cost of the War.
Edgar Crommand, in an address to the Royal
Statistical Society, said the cost of the war was
.£9,000,000,000 a year. Belgium’s loss was £526,-
000,000, including .£250,000.000 for the destruc-
tion of property. A year’s war cost Germany
,£2,775,000,000, including £985,000,000 decreased
production and £879,000,000 as the capitalised
value, of human life. Compared with this the
cost to Great Britain was £1,258,000,000. The
war indemnity which compensated the victors
would bo £4,500,000,000.

Naval Losses of Britain & Germany to March 27
The Rockefeller Foundation Commission
which went to Belgium on inquiry business,
has presented its report. It states that there
are 320,000 Belgian refugees in Holland, 100,000
in England, but that there are many who have
been driven out of their homes who are still in
Belgium. Their numbers are not estimated.
The Commission found people living in cellars
and in lofts over cowstalls, and saw children
that had been born in fowl-houses and pig-
styes. One man considered that he was doing
well when the population of his poultry-house
which he and his' family occupied was reduced
from 22 to 18. No estimates cou’d be obtained
of the total of the German military requisitions,
but it must be enormous. Grain, canned goods,
live stock, cotton wool, raw and manufactured
copper, fixtures, factory implements, motor cars
petrol, and machinery for use in the manufac-
ture of armaments, were among the many things
taken. The people had been denied the use of
the telegraphs and the mails, and had
no means of communicating with the
outside world, except through German channels.
The alleviating circumstances noted were that
all classes of the people took their share of the
national trouble, and the burden was automati-
cally distributed. Poor tenants did not pay rent,
though the landlords were almost as impoverish-
ed as they, there were no evictions, and the sale
of intoxicating liquor was stopped.

FIFTEEN QUEEN ELIZABETHS.
So far the British Admiralty have 15 Queen
Elizabeths'afloat or under construction. All
mount-eight 15-inch and sixteen 0-inch guns
Six of them will have a speed of 25 knots, and
the balance between 22 and 23 knots. There are
possibly two, the Warspite and Valiant now in
the North Sea with Sir John Jellicoe. The other
two, Barham and Malaya, of this class, may be
undergoing trials now, and the sixth, an unnam-
ed ship, will be ready at the end of the year, in
classes the ships are grouped as follow
27.500 TONS, 25 KNOTS, EIGHT 15-INCH,
SIXTEEN 0-INCH GUNS.

The 15-inch gun to be mounted in the four
last ships may be an improvement on the gun
now in the Queen Elizabeth ; or it may be a 10-
inch weapon. Details are, of course, very tardily
given out by the Naval authorities, but there
are sufficient of these huge vessels now on the
way to give Great Britain absolute sea suprem-
acy when the war ends.
“ Why don’t you enlist?” a big chap was
asked in a Melbourne suburban court the other
day. “ Well,” he said, “ it’s this way with me. I
won a case of whisky in a chopping match the
other day and I can’t see my way clear till that s
finished. ”

A SCRAP OF PAPER.
Only a scrap of paper,
Only a nation’s word ;
These are the things they tell us
Gentlemen think absurd.
Only a twice-signed Treaty,
A poor, thin guarantee ;
The word of three great nations
To let a small one be.
No more than this, this only;
And that’s why the five words sting
Where gentlemen serve their country
And a gentleman, though a King.

The Day!
You boasted the Gay, and you toasted the Day,
And now the Day has come.
Blasphemer, braggart, and coward all,
Little you reck of the numbing ball,
The blasting shell, or the “ white arm s fall.
As they speed poor humans home.
You spied for the Day, you lied for the Day;
And woke the Day’s red spleen.
Monster, w’lo asked God’s aid Divine,
Then strewed his seas with the ghastly mine ;
Not aU the waters of the Nile
Can wash thy foul hands clean.
You dreamed for the Day, you schemed for the
Day;
Watch how the Day will go.
Slayer of age and youth and prime
(Defenceless slain for never a crime).
Thou art steeped in blood as a hog in slime.
False friend and cowardly foe.
You have sown for the Day, you have grown
for the Day :
Yours is the harvest red. ■ .
Can you hear the groans and the awful cries?
Can you see the heap of slain that lies,
And sightless turned to the flame-split skies
The glassy eyes of the dead ?
You have wronged for the Day, you have long-
ed for the Day
That lit the awful flame.
’Tis nothing to yon that hill and plain
Yield sheaves of dead men ’mid the grain;
That widows mourn for then loved ones slain.
And mothers curse thy name.
But after the Day there’s a price to pay
For the sleepers under the sod.
And He you have mocked for many a day—
Listen, and hear what He has to say :
“ Vengeance is mine; Iwi I repay. ’
What can you say to God?
Henry Chappell.
Male Waiter (to the housemaid) : ’Ere’s
me with two brothers wounded in France
an’ three sisters in the Red Cross, and yet the
tirst thing customers ask is: “ Are you a Ger-
man ? ”

WHAT WILL YE GIVE?
(Belgium: 1915.)
What will ye give to the Nation P —shattered
and stricken and scarred ;
Where the fields lie black in the terrible track
w hero the path of the Hun was barred.
Bruised at the heel of the foe man, bleeding from
out the strife —
What will ye give to the nation who’s given her
very life ?
%
What will ye give to the Women? —dark is the
dawn of their day.
Where the empty shell of a tottering spire still
points to a hero’s way.
Oh, the women are waiting ard weeping, for the
men who have given their lives—
Then what will ye give to the women—the wo-
men who once were wives ?
What will ye give to the Children ?—poor little
starving ones.
Can’t you hear the cry of the children ’mid the
pitiless roar of the guns ?
Ruined the red-roofed cottage, bowed is their
mother’s head,
So what will ye give to the children, who weep
for a father dead ?
Here in our sea-girt haven, with the oceans that
lie between,
War is a ghastly nightware—do we know what
its horrors mean ?
But gladly we’ll loosen our purse-strings, and
gladly we’ll pay our share,
Lest they think, since we do not know them,
that neither do we care.
For all she has given in flesh and blood we can-
not repay in gold,
For the life of a man and the heart of a woman
will never be bought and sold.
But the lonely ones are calling, would ye heed
their piteous call ?
Then give your mite to the Nation —the Nation
who’s given her all!

Why the Patriotic Fund
Was Inaugurated.
The objects of the Patriotic
Fund briefly are as follows :
To provide for the serious-
ly wounded or those who are
disabled or incapacitated
whilst on active service, and
for the dependents of those
(1) in the State of New South
Wales, (2) in the Common-
wealth of Australia, who, while
on naval or military duty, are
killed or in any way disabled
or incapacitated, and for oth-
er purposes approved by the
Committee for the direct bene-
fit of the troops and their de-
pendents.
In addition, the Lord Mayor
of Sydney, when instituting
the Fund, provided for such
sums as donors might desire
being set apart for Imperial
purposes.
The Executive Committee
is also prepared to consider
applications fo r assistance
from the dependents of mem-
bers of the Expeditionary
Forces who have been left in
necessitous circumstances.
