Preface.
This pamphlet is a first edition ; which will shortly be
followed by a second, which will complete statistical
information to the end of 1885. It is on basis of
pamphlet drafted by the Government Printer for
distribution in the New South Wales Court at the
Amsterdam International Exhibition. The letterpress
generally has been revised by leading Government
Departments, while the more recent statistics have been
supplied from the office of the Registrar-General of the
Colony—Mr. E. Grant Ward.

NEW SOUTH WALES.
Introduction.
The Colonial and Indian Exhibition affords an appropriate
opportunity for noting the relative positions of the Australasian
Colonies, and for disseminating information respecting their
progress and resources.
In the early part of the seventeenth century several portions
of the Australian continent and adjacent islands were visited by
Dutch navigators, who bestowed upon them names commemo-
rative of their own nationality, such as New Holland, New
Zealand, and Van Diemen’s Land, The Netherlands have
extensive possessions in Oceania, which, owing to their proximity
to Australia, may be expected to develop extensive commercial
relations with the neighbouring British Colonies as the latter
become more thickly populated and their resources and manu-
factures better known, France, Spain, and Germany have also
interests in the South Pacific.
The discovery of the eastern shores of the Australian con-
tinent by Captain Cook, in 1770, led to the first Australasian
settlement being founded at Sydney by the British Government,
in 1788, The British Colonies which have sprung from this
settlement contain an area of 3,169,129 square miles, of which
New South Wales contains 310,700, —Victoria, 87,884, —South
Australia, 903,690, —Queensland, 668,497, —Western Australia,
1,060,000, —New Zealand, 104,403, —Tasmania, 26,215, —and Fiji,
7,740, square miles.


The estimated population of the British Colonies in Austra-
lasia at the end of 1884 was 3,233,041, distributed as under
New South Wales, 921,208 (including 1,643 aborigines*), which
by the end of 1885 had increased to 980,573; Victoria, 961,276
(including 780 aborigines); South Australia, 312,781 (including
6,340 aborigines); Western Australia, 32,958 (not including
2,346 aborigines); Queensland, 309,913 (not including 20,585
aborigines); New Zealand, 520,207 (not including44,o97Maories) ;
Tasmania, 130,541. In the year 1884 there was an increase
of 141,154 souls arising from the excess of immigration over
emigration and of births over deaths. Fiji at the last Census
had a population of 124,902, of whom 115,635 were aborigines.
The proportion of the sexes amongst the European population
of the Australian Colonies was estimated, in 1881, at 118 - 76 males
to 100 females, or 84’21 females to 100 males. The average
number of inhabitants of European descent was less than one
person to the square mile. There is room in New South Wales
alone for a very large accession of new population for the develop-
ment of its pastoral, agricultural, mineral, and other resources.
During the last decennial period the pojmlationof the Australian
Colonies (1871-81) increased 42 per cent., commerce 47 per cent.,
wool production 70 per cent., acres under cultivation 120 per cent.,
railways 431 per cent., telegraphs 190 per cent., and revenue 123
per cent. The annual revenues of the several Governments in-
creased from 13i millions in 1875 to 22millions sterling in 1884,
being an average of £7 Is. Od. per head of population. The
live stock in Australasia consisted at the end of 1884 of
74,345,954 sheep, 8,178,745 cattle, 1,272,020 horses, and 939,021
pigs. The land under cultivation increased from 3,165,000 acres
in 1871 to nearly 7,000,000 acres in 1881, and the total acreage
under crop at close of 1884 was 7,501,879.
The tonnage of shipping entered and cleared at all the ports
in Australasia had increased at end of 1884, to 12,919,703 tons.
In 1871 the tonnage was 4,300,000, and in 1881, 9,504,000.
* This total of aborigines is from the Census of 1881.


Several lines of steamships, some of them considerably over five
thousand tons burthen, are now engaged in the carrying trade.
The value of Colonial produce and manufactures exported for
1884, was £54,572,756. The exports consisted principally of
products of the pastoral, agricultural, and mining industries,
such as wool, tallow, hides, preserved meats, wheat, gold, silver,
tin, copper, coal, &c.
The average deposits in the Colonial Banks of issue, during the
quarter ending 30th June 1885 amounted to £79,335,510.
In 1884 the trade between the Australian Colonies, England,
and Eoreign States amounted to £118,573,876, or an average of
£37 10s. per head of population, of which the sum of £2O 4s.
lOd. was for imports and £l7 ss. 2d. for exports.
At the end of 1884 the various Australasian Glovernments
possessed 7,540 miles of railways in active operation, and 1,848
miles were under construction in various parts of the interior.
The railways are now returning fair interest on the capital
invested, and are important factors in the industrial progress
of the Colonies. There are 33,446 miles of line, and 59,956 miles
of wire, of electric telegraphs connecting every township of any
importance in the Australasian Colonies; and by means of the
ocean cables the latest intelligence from the chief nations of the
world is disseminated throughout Australia almost as soon as
it is published in European cities. The Colonies afford all the
comforts of modern civilized life, with but little of the poverty
existing in older countries.
The food supply of G-reat Britain is largely supplemented by
Australian grain and preserved meats. During the agricultural
season of 1883-4 these Colonies produced 45,541,592 bushels of
w r heat, 15,065,246 bushels of oats, 6,275,850 bushels of maize, and
1,002,057 bushels of other cereals, 386,495 tons of potatoes,
1,252,088 tons of hay, and 1,791,065 gallons of wine.
The public debts of the seven Colonies of Australasia at the
end of 1884 amounted to only £121,680,598*, or an -average of
* Including £3,041,923 accrued sinking fund of the Colony of New Zealand.


£37 12s. Bd. per head o£ population, incurred for the construction
of railways and other reproductive public works, and the con-
sequent development of the varied resources of the several
Colonies. The expenditure of the several Colonies in 1883
amounted to £22,970,861, against revenue to the amount of
£21,475,353, showing a deficit of £1,495,508 for that year.
Out of the 1,968,260,080 acres contained in the Colonies, only
86,703,110 acres had been alienated at the end of 1881, leaving
1,881,556,970 acres unalienated. The vast extent of the public
estate gives ample security for any loans that may be required
for national purposes.
Settlement, Position, and Extent of
New South Wales.
Discovered by Captain Cook in 1770, and first settled in 1788,
New South Wales dates its prosperity from the commencement
of the present century, when the introduction of the Merino
sheep by Captain Macarthur rapidly led to the settlement of the
interior for pastoral and industrial pursuits. In 1851 the south-
Avestern districts of New South Wales were formed into the
Colony of Victoria, and in 1859 its northern districts into the
Colony of Queensland.
The boundaries of New South Wales are marked by 28° 10'
and 37° 28' south latitude, and by the 141° east longitude and
the Pacific Ocean. The total superficial area is estimated at
195,882,150 acres. The coast line from Point Danger to Cape
Howe is about 700 miles long. The extreme breadth is about
850 miles, and mean breadth 600 miles. The greatest length is
900 miles.
Physical Aspect.
There is. considerable diversity of physical aspect in this large
extent of country. At a distance varying from 25 to 120 miles
from the seaboard, a range of mountains, from 3,000 to 7,000


feet iu height, stretches from north to south, throwing out spurs
in every direction. Numerous streams flow down the eastern
slopes into the sea, while the large rivers, Murrumbidgee,
Murray, Lachlan, Darling, and Macquarie, with their tributaries,
drain the western slopes. The coast-line is indented with fine
harbours, one of which, Port Jackson, on which Sydney the
capital is situated, is unsurpassed by any in the world.
Natural Divisions of the Colony.
The principal great natural divisions of the Colony of New
South Wales are the eastern seaboard territory, the central range,
and the western plains. The seaboard districts undulate with
hill and valley, and possess rich alluvial flats adapted to every
kind of cultivation. Much of this portion rests on a vast basin
of coal. Beyond the coal areas the country abounds iu gold,
silver, copper, lead, tin, and other minerals. The extensive
western slopes and plains are specially adapted for pastoral and
agricultural pursuits. Millions of sheep, cattle, and horses are
fed upon the natural grasses of the country.
Climate and Health.
Situated in the temperate zone, the climate of New South
Wales approximates generally to that of southern Europe.
There are all varieties of climate, while the range of the ther-
mometer is much less than in any country within the same
parallels of latitude in the northern hemisphere. The climate is
healthy; the air is clear, the light brilliant, the sky for a great
part of the year almost cloudless, and the nights usually cool.
The mean annual temperature of Sydney is 627 degrees. In
vital statistics the Colony compares favourably with most parts
of the world, and instances of great longevity are numerous.
Births per 1,000 of mean population in 1884 averaged 37 90 per
thousand; deaths, 15'88; and marriages, 8 35. The excess
of births over deaths amounted to 166 09 per thousand.


Government.
New South Wales has a G-overnor appointed by the Crown>
and a Parliament consisting of two Houses, the Legislative
Council and the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament is
invested with plenary powers, subject to the reservation of the
Queen’s assent by the Governor, to certain classes of measures
affecting Imperial and other interests.
The Members of the Legislative Council hold their seats for
life, and are appointed by the Governor.
The Legislative Assembly consists of 122 Members, elected
by ballot. Manhood suffrage is the qualification of a voter.
Parliaments are triennial.
The Executive Government consists of nine Members, as
follows:
The Colonial Secretary.
The Colonial Treasurer.
The Secretary for Lands.
The Secretary for Public Works.
The Minister of Public Instruction.
The Minister of Justice.
The Secretary for Mines.
The Attorney-General.
The Postmaster-General.
Administration of Justice
The laws of New South Wales are substantially identical with
those of Great Britain. The Supreme Court has as regards the
Colony all the powers which are vested in the superior Courts
of England. There are five Judges —the Chief Justice and
four Puisne Judges.
Besides the fixed Courts in the metropolis, Circuit Courts are
regularly held in the princij)al towns of the interior, to try civil
and criminal cases. District Courts and Courts of Quarter
Sessions are also frequently held in Sydney and many country
towns, presided over by six District Court Judges. In addition
to this there are 241 Courts of Petty Sessions.

Increase of Population.
The progress of the population of New South Wales and its
number at the end of the last five decades may be seen from the
following figures:—
In 1811 there were 149,669.
~1851 ~ ~ 197,168, after giving up 68,335 to Victoria.
~ 1861 ~ ~ 358,278, after giving up 25,000 to Queensland,
„ 1871 „ ~ 519,182.
„ 1881 „ „ 781,265.
At present the population is about 981,000, and is rapidly
increasing. Last year there was a net gain of 59,305 persons.
The increase in population was Gl'63 per cent, during the last
ten years, or 616 per cent, annually; but in such a vast country,
abounding in wealth and resources, there is ample room for a
population of twenty millions. The proportion of the sexes was
at last census: Males, 54‘71, and females, 45 - 29 per cent. The
nationalities of those resident in New South Wales at the taking
of the Census in April, 1881, were as follows :
At the Census of 1881 there were 135,326 inhabited houses,
6,016 houses not inhabited, and 2,398 houses in course of con-
struction. Comparing the increase in the number of the habita-
tions of the people daring the last two decennial periods, there


was an increase o£ 45,133 for 1872-81, against 34,03G in tlie
previous decade. The returns also indicate that the buildings
erected of late years are of a thoroughly substantial character,
there being an increase of 15,920 stone or brick houses for the
period 1871-81, against 9,858 for 1861-71.
Immigration.
Immigrants are selected by the Agent-General or his officers
in London, and selection is limited to such adults as can pay
towards the cost of their passage as follows : —£4 each for married
and single men ; £2 each for married and single women. Children
under three years of age, in charge of their parents, have a free
passage ; and children between three and fourteen years are
brought out for £1 each. The selection is made from England,
Scotland, and Ireland, proportionately to the number of people
of these nationalities already in the Colony, as shown by the
last Census ; but 10 per cent, may be selected from other
European countries. Sound health and good moral character are
indispensable qualification. Married couples must not exceed
forty years of age, and are taken with or without children;
unmarried men or women must not exceed thirty-five years
of age; and the proportion of unmarried men must not exceed
one-third of the whole number of adult immigrants. When the
age exceeds these limits the contribution for passage money is
increased to £l5. Mechanics, farmers, miners, vine- dressers,
labourers, and domestic servants are chosen with a special view
to the requirements of the industrial callings of the Colony.
Small working capitalists in any branch of colonial industry are
deemed highly eligible.
Deposits may be made either with the Agent-General in
London, or with the Agent for Immigration or Clerks of Petty
Sessions in the Colony. No advantage is allowed in respect of
any person brought out as a cabin or intermediate cabin passenger.
Deposits are returned when, from a just cause, the persons in
whose behalf they have been made do not emigrate, unless in


cases of fraud or concealment of facts, or (in the case of persons
who have made their deposits within the three Kingdoms) when
a passage has been actually provided; but an emigrant may be
authorized to remain for another ship. Deposits in excess are
returned.
On arrival in the Colony, to which they are now brought by
swift steamers, married couples, children, and single men are
permitted to remain on board steamer five days if necessary;
unmarried women are provided for in the Immigrant’s Home
for ten days ; and immigrants proceeding to the interior receive
free passes by railway, and along the coast of the Colony by
steamer.
An Act has been passed for restricting the influx of Chinese.

Land Policy.
The Land Policy of the Colony of New South Wales has been
entirely changed by the Crown Lands Act of 1884, which came
into operation on Ist January, 1885. By this Act the Colony is
divided into three Divisions denominated respectively the Eastern,
Central, and Western. The new law provides for various classes
of holdings, such as absolute and conditional freeholds and lease-
holds. Hitherto nearly the whole of the unalienated portion of the
Colony has been let to pastoral tenants, in runs under one general
system for terms of years. These runs, or leaseholds, were liable
to be encroached upon by any eligible person who wished to
acquire a freehold, and in many cases an annual leasehold to
three times the extent of the conditional freehold. There were
many other ways in which the leased runs could be diminished
by alienation and reservation. The tenant was at the end of this
term permitted to renew his leasehold, and a reduction was made
in his rent for the new period proportionate to the area taken
from his holding. Under the new system all the runs in the
Colony are to be divided into two fairly equal parts, the Govern-
ment determining which part shall be let to the tenant at present
in occupation, and which part shall be resumed for the benefit of
the public. The present lessee, however, is to have a preferent
right of obtaining an annual occupation license for the resumed
area, which will entitle him to use the land within that area for
grazing purposes, but not to the exclusion of any person who
may wish to acquire a better tenure. The half of the run let as
a pastoral lease cannot be encroached upon or resumed by the
Crown during the currency of the lease, except in a very few
instances, and then only for some specific purpose for the public
benefit. The tenures and rents are different in the different
parts of the Colony. In the Eastern Division the tenure of a
pastoral lease is for five years at a rental of not less than Id. per
acre per annum. In the Central Division the tenure is for ten
years and the rent not less than 1-J-d. per acre. In the Western
Division the tenure is for fifteen years, and the rent not less than


Id. per acre per annum. The rent o£ pastoral leases in the
Western Division will be fixed for the first five years, and then
increased one-fourth for the second five years, and one-half for
the residue of the term. In the Central Division the rent will
be increased one-fourth after the first five years. In the Eastern
Division the rent will be fixed for the whole term. There are
rights of renewal and many other matters of detail in connection
with this class of holding which are clearly set out by the Act
and Regulations.
The system of alienation is various, the principal methods being
by conditional freehold and conditional leasehold, the latter being
in most instances convertible into conditional and absolute free-
holds. The areas which may be taken vary according to the
Division of the Colony in which the land may be situated, the
smaller areas being allowed in the Eastern Division, and the
larger in the Central. The land is, as a rule, more valuable for
agricultural purposes in the Eastern than Central Division,
because the rainfall is greater, the population denser, and the
means of reaching large markets more convenient than in the
Central. In the Eastern Division any area of land not less than
40 nor more than 640 acres can be taken as a conditional pur-
chase, for which a deposit of 2s". per acre must be paid at the
time of tendering the application for the land. Convenient forms
of application are provided, and all necessary instruction and
information will be given by Government agents in the various
towns throughout the Colony where land agencies are estab-
lished. The application has to come before a Board, consisting
of a Chairman (who is a salaried officer) and two other persons
selected locally by the Government from among the people.
The application, and in fact all other matters connected with
land, rents, fences, &c., &c., are considered by this Board in open
Court, the proceedings of which are regulated in the same way as
a Court of Justice, and the several parties concerned can call and
examine and cross-examine witnesses, and may appear by counsel,
attorney, or agent if they desire to do so. When the application
for a conditional purchase comes on for investigation before a


Board, if it be confirmed the purchaser must go into possession
and faithfully fulfil the condition of residence for five years.
He must also fence the outside boundaries of his land within
two years from confirmation of his application, unless for
sufficient cause shown the Board extend the period within which
he may fence. At the end of three years the conditional pur-
chaser must make a solemn declaration before a Magistrate that
he has so far fulfilled the conditions of residence and fencing ;
and at the end of the fifth year he must make another declaration
that he has fulfilled all the conditions which the law imposes,
except the payment of balance of purchase money. If the Board
be satisfied that all the conditions have been fulfilled, it can issue
a certificate to that effect, and this certificate will be, to all
intents and purposes, sufficient to prove that the holder’s title
is good, if he continues to pay the necessary annual instalments.
When the purchaser makes the declaration at the end of three
years, he must lodge it with the Government Land Agent and
an instalment of Is. per acre on the land declaced upon, and
must annually pay a like instalment till the balance of 17s. and
interest at the rate of 4 per cent, be paid. At the end of five
years from confirmation of application, the purchaser can, if he
desire to do so, pay off the balance in full.
In addition to the conditional purchase, the purchaser can
get, by another application, a conditional lease of three times
the area of his purchase, provided that the area of his purchases
and leases taken together do not exceed 1,280 acres in the
Eastern Division. This conditional lease will be subject to an
annual rental of not less than 2d. per acre, any higher rate being
assessed by the Board. The land must be fenced, but one out-
side fence wall answer for the conditional purchase and con-
ditional lease. At the end of five years from the date when the
application for the lease was approved, if all things necessary
have been done, the holder of the land can convert it into a
conditional purchase without residence, or he can renew the
lease for another five years, but at the end of that term his right
to the land in any form will cease. The same law holds good in


the Central Division, except that the area of the purchase and
lease is extended to 2,560 acres.
In the Western Division land cannot he conditionally pur-
chased (except within any special area proclaimed as available
for some specific purpose), and therefore there cannot be any
conditional leases of the classes spoken of above. A new class
of settler is, however, let into this Division of the Colony. He is
denominated a homestead leaseholder. He can get an area of
not less than 5,760 acres, and not more than 10,240 acres; but
this leasehold must be taken within that portion of country
resumed by the Glovernment from the old run, and not within
the new pastoral lease. The homestead lessee must fence his
land and reside upon it for six months out of every year for the
first five years, and must enter upon occupation within ninety
days of approval of his application. The annual rental for this
class of holding is the same as for a pastoral lease, not less than
Id. per acre, and the tenure is for fifteen years, with the same
right of renewal as for a pastoral lease, namely, five years more.
At the termination of all leasehold tenures the land reverts to
the Crown.
A person who wishes to obtain a conditional purchase with-
out residence can take up any area not less than 40 nor more
than 320 acres. This class of purchaser must fence his land,
and expend £1 per acre on improvements, other than fencing,
within five years from date of purchase. The deposit and all
subsequent instalments upon these purchases are to be double
the amounts paid upon ordinary conditional purchases. The
holder of one of these purchases cannot take up a conditional
purchase of any other kind, nor can a person who has previously
taken up an ordinary conditional purchase take up a non-
residential one. A conditional lease cannot be granted by virtue
of a non-residential purchase.
Lands may be sold also by the Government at auction, at
an upset price of not less than £1 ss. per acre ; but not more
than 200,000 acres can be sold in one year throughout the


Colony. Land may be specially alienated on a Gold-field.
When gold is discovered on Crown Lands, people settle down
hurriedly and erect residences and places of business, and, under
certain conditions and limitations, the law permits the occupants
to purchase small areas upon which their improvements stand.
Land can also be obtained as leasehold in various ways ; as for
instance annual leases for grazing purposes, in areas not exceed-
ing 1,920 acres ; and special leases of limited extend for a term
of years for almost every known purpose which can benefit the
community.
The area of the Eastern Division of the Colony is 60,452,000
acres; the Central, 55,460,000 acres; and the Western,
79,970,000 acres. These figures are approximate. The areas
alienated out of these vast Divisions are about, in the Eastern,
one-third; in the Central, between one-third and one-fourth ;
and in the Western, only a little more than one-fortieth; the
total area of the Colony being 195,882,150 acres, of which not
more than about 37,000,000 acres have been alienated.
Roads, Railways, and Traimvays.
At present New South Wales is expending three millions
annually on permanent public works. More than 23,522 miles
of common roads are open, affording intercommunication with
every part of the interior, and greatly facilitating the carrying of
farm and other produce to the best markets. About £5,000,000
have been spent in ten years on common roads alone, and con-
struction is still rapidly going on. Mail coaches run through
every district. During the last quarter of a century more than
50 miles of public bridges have been constructed. About 5,000
miles of road are metalled, 1,600 miles are graded mountain
passes, and the remainder for the most part drained and cleared,
with bridges where required. There are eighty-seven public
ferries, four of which are worked by steam, and the number is
yearly increasing, notwithstanding that many of the most impor-
tant are being replaced by iron and stone bridges.


Railways were commenced in New South Wales by a private
Company. In 1855 the Government obtained an Act enabling
it to purchase the railways and plant of the Company, and since
that time railway construction has been carried on almost exclu-
sively by the Government. The central mountain range delayed
the progress of construction, by presenting great engineering
difficulties, but these have been overcome, and lines now cross
the range north, south, and west. The Great Northern line
starts from Newcastle, and has been opened to Glen Innes, a
distance of 323 miles in a north-easterly direction, and to Narrabri,
252 miles to the north-west. A line is now in course of construc-
tion from the Southern Railway near Sydney to connect with
the Northern Railway near Newcastle. The Northern line is now
being extended to Tenterfield, a short distance from the borders
of Queensland. The Queensland line from Brisbane is now
completed and open for traffic within 25 miles of the New South
Wales border, and in a few years’ time uninterrupted railway
communication will exist between Sydney and Brisbane. The
Great Western and the Great Southern lines both start from
Sydney. The former, passing through Bathurst, the capital of the
west, has been finished to Bourke, 503 miles, on the river Darling.
The latter, through Goulburn, has reached Albury, the border
town between New South Wales and Victoria, a distance of 387
miles to the south, and Hay, 454 miles to the south-west, and
will probably be extended to the borders of South Australia.
The works are considerably delayed for want of labour. Trial
surveys have been completed for many miles south, west, and
north; and surveys for proposed railway lines have been
authorized in all parts of the Colony. The number of miles of
railway opened during the year 1884 was 298, including exten-
sions on the Great Northern, Great Southern, and Great Western
lines. In addition to this, 444 miles of railway on these and other
lines are in course of construction, and Parliament has further
authorized the construction of 1,276 miles. The last link of the
intercolonial line from Sydney to Melbourne, consisting of a
mile or two of railway and at present a temporary bridge over


the river Murray, which separates the Colonies of New South
Wales and Victoria, was completed on 14th June, 1883. The
Great Southern and Great Western lines and the Great Northern
line are, as already mentioned, to be connected by a junction
railway which will unite the whole railway system of the Colony,
and, when gaps are filled up, complete railway connection will
be established between the several Colonies on the Australian
continent. Coast lines running north and south from the capital,
and branches to act as feeders to the main lines, are being
extended in various directions. In all, there were in March
1886, 1,750 miles of railway open in New South Wales. The
railways in the Australasian Colonies nearly all belong to the
State, and prove of incalculable value in opening up the inland
districts of the various Colonies, settlement and progression
going hand in hand with the extension of the railways. In 1884,
on a total of 1,620 miles open in this Colony, the entire earnings
were £2,086,237, and the working expenses £1,301,259, yielding
a net return of £784,978, or 4J per cent, on the capital invested.
When it is taken into account that money to make these lines can
be borrowed for 4 per cent., the returns received from their opera-
tion will be seen to be very satisfactory. The railways of the
Colony, constructed on the standard gauge of 4 ft. 8f in., are
amongst the most substantial in the world, some of the iron bridges
and viaducts being extremely costly. The Zigzag, which occurs
on the Great Western line, near the summit level (3,700 feet), is
a most skilful engineering work. The passenger accommodation
is unusually complete, including palace sleeping-cars. The total
amount of money expended on Government Railways in New
South Wales to the end of 1884, on lines open for traffic, was
£20,080,139. In order to accommodate the great passenger
traffic to the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, a steam
tramway was laid down from the Eedfern Railway Station to the
vicinity of the Garden Palace, and the success attending the
experiment led to the construction of tram lines to several of
the suburbs of the city. Twenty-seven miles of city and suburban
tramways were opened in 1884, the capital cost being £643,111.


The number of passengers carried during 1881 was over
30,000,000. During 1881 the tramway coaching receipts were
£219,912, and the expenditure £215,107. In addition to the
city and suburban tramways, a tram was laid down between
Campbelltown, a station on the main Southern Eailway, and
Camden, a distance of 8 miles. This line was constructed as
an experiment, in order to see if branch lines in the shape of
tramways could be advantageously worked as feeders to the main
lines of railway. The Camden line in 1881 returned 2\ per
cent, upon its cost, and lias to some degree developed traffic for
the main line.
Municipalities.
The rateable value of municipal property in New South Wales
is increasing at a rapid ratio. In 1881 the one hundred and
forty-two boroughs and municipalities of New South Wales
collected a total revenue of £701,881. Sydney alone obtained
£311,070, including the rates for water and sewerage services.
The estimated annual value of rateable property in the suburban
and country municipalities amounted, for 1881, to £3,211,327,
and in Sydney to £1,979,772,
Post Offices and Telegraphs.
Wherever there is a township there is a post office, and every
village in the furthest interior has its postal communication.
The postage on letters within Australia is 2d. per i oz., while
newspapers are carried free. The average number of letters
posted in the Colony in proportion to its population in 1881 was
forty-three to each person, —a fact which indicates much commer-
cial activity and intelligence.
Telegraph lines intersect the country in every direction.

1874 ... 115 7,340$ ... 569,001
1884 ... 394 ... 18,681$ ... 2,334,052


The total cost of construction up to the end of 1881 was
£001,460.
Telegrams from all parts of the world are daily published in
the newspapers.
Education.
The Educational System of New South Wales is under the
control of the Minister of Public Instruction. Teachers are
recognized as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The
school fee is 3d. per week per child, and the fees collected are
paid into the Treasury as revenue. In 1884 there were 1,912
State Schools in operation, namely, eight High Schools —four for
boys and four for girls, twenty-six Superior Public Schools, 1,450
ordinary Public Schools, 250 Provisional Schools, 117 Half-time
Schools, forty House-to-house Schools under itinerant teachers,
and twenty-one Evening Public Schools. The Colony is appor-
tioned, for purposes of school inspection, into a metropolitan, a
sub-metropolitan, and seven country districts, under an Inspec-
toral Staff, consisting of a Chief Inspector, a Deputy Chief In-
spector, District Inspectors, Inspectors, and Assistant Inspectors.
Two Training Schools for candidate teachers —male and female —
are also under the supervision of the Chief Inspector and his
assistants, A Chief Examiner and two assistants report upon
the papers of teachers seeking classification or promotion. A
School Attendance and Payments Officer, with forty-nine assistants,
attends to the payment of fees and to the obligatory attendance
of children between six and fourteen years of age; provision
being made for educating children whose parents are unable to
pay fees, and children who are neglected. The Colony has also
been divided into Public School districts, with one Local Board
appointed for each district. It is intended to appoint additional
Boards where necessary, so that each Board may have the super-
vision of only a small number of schools. School buildings are
erected wholly at the expense of the G-overnment. Denomi-
national Schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but
general religious instruction is provided for. It may be imparted


by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations
are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction
in the tenets of their respective Churches. Since 18G1 Parliament
has voted nearly £6,100,000 for Primary Schools, giving an
average of about £254,166 per annum, or Bs. 9d. per head of
the mean population. For the year 1885, the Parliamentary
grant for public instruction was about £723,000, or 15s. B|d. per
head of population. One of the best proofs of the educational
progress of New South Wales is shown by the fact that the per-
centage of illiterates over ten years of age to the total population
declined from 2957 per cent, in 1861 to 2274 in 1871, and to
1451 in 1881. In 1884, 167,134 children attended the ordinary
State Schools, and nearly 1,000 were inmates of the Orphan
Schools, Industrial Schools, and the School for the Deaf and
Dumb and the Blind. In 1884, private schools, including
church schools, showed an attendance of 33,607 children. In
1882, State aid was withdrawn from all church schools. The
Parliamentary grant for 1885 for Orphan Schools and Industrial
Schools, and for the School for the Deaf and Dumb, is
about £15,000; a vote of £IO,OOO is available towards the
forming and erection of a Reformatory for Boys; and for the
State Children’s Relief Board, under which orphan and neglected
children are boarded out among respectable families throughout
the Colony, the grant is £18,500.
The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the
State in 1851. Its State endowment was originally £5,000, but
is now £12,000 per annum —£5,000 additional having been voted
in 1882, and £2,000 more in 1883. The endowment is largely
added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The
Parliamentary grant for 1885 —inclusive of endowments, and
grants for additional lecturers, for scientific apparatus, for
repairs, and for additional buildings—amounts to nearly £35,000.
Three Denominational Colleges are affiliated to the University,
each having a State endowment of £SOO per annum. The Sydney
University has the power of granting degrees in Arts, Law,
Medicine, and Science. Recently several Faculties have been


added to its curriculum. Graduates are entitled to tlie same
rank, style, and precedence as those of Universities within the
United Kingdom. In the metropolis there is a Public Grammar
School, attended annually by nearly 400 pupils, and having a
State endowment of £1,500, and a total vote for 1885 —for
endowment, buildings, and salaries —of £3,000. There is also a
Technical College for working-men, and in the country towns
there are about 150 Mechanics’ Schools of Arts. Parliament
has voted for 1885 over £17,000 towards the support of Schools
of Arts ; and for technical instruction —in the College and in
connection with the Schools of Arts and the Evening Public
Schools —a grant of £15,000 is available. A Board of Technical
Education, consisting of eighteen members, with Mr. Edward
Combes, C.M.G., M.P., as President, has been constituted for
the purpose of establishing a State system of technical education
in the Colony. There are also a Koyal Society, a Medical, a
Linnean, a Zoological, and an Art Society, with many other
educational associations of a like character. Eor the Sydney
Eree Library a grant of £7,440 has been voted for 1885 ; for the
Museum and the Technological Museum, £11,300; and for the
Pine Art Gallery —for the purchase of works of Art, and for
buildings, &c.—£17,000. The Fine Art Gallery of New South
Wales is a kindred institution to the English National Gallery,
and already there has been made an excellent and varied
collection of paintings, drawings, and sculpture, to which
the admission is free. The present Art Gallery is only a
temporary building, but the Government has erected a more
substantial structure, and it is intended that eventually an edifice
shall be erected worthy of its great object and of Australia. The
Art Society of New South Wales has exhibitions of original
productions twice a year, and'has become the nucleus of an
Australian School of Art.
The total State grant available for 1885 for educational pur-
poses —as enumerated in the foregoing statement —was about
£876,740.


Social Condition.
Nearly all European institutions have firmly rooted themselves
in Australia. All phases of society and every religious sect
have their representatives here, as in England. Every town,
and almost every interest, has its newspaper ; and Banks have
been established wherever a competent population has concen-
trated. The laws are efficiently administered, and life and
property are eminently secure. The means of gaining a liveli-
hood are comparatively easy, and in sufficient variety, while the
intellectual, aesthetic, and moral progress of the Colony is
keeping pace with its industrial occupations.
The religious persuasions in New South Wales at the taking
of the Census of 1881 were as follows: —Church of England,
342,359; Lutherans, 4,836; Presbyterians, 72,545; Wesleyan
Methodists, 57,049; other Methodists, 7,303 ; Congregationalists,
14,328; Baptists, 7,307 ; Unitarians, 828 ; other Protestants,
9,957; total Protestants, 516,512; Eoman Catholics, 207,020;
Catholics undescribed, 586 ; total Catholics, 207,606 ; Hebrews,
3,266; other persuasions, 1,012 ; unspecified persuasions, 13,697;
Pagans, 9,345. There were in 1884 810 ministers of religion and
1,584 churches, with an average attendance at public worship of
310,197 persons. The Sunday Schools had in 1884 106,171
scholars on their registers.
Trade and Commerce.
New South Wales is most advantageously situated for pur-
poses of trade and commerce. It is the centre of the group of
Australasian Colonies and the entrepot of the islands in the
South Pacific, the coast of the vast American continent, and is in
easy and constant communication with the continents of Asia
and America. More than one-half of the Australasian shipping is
owned in the Colony. The inward and outward tonnage of
5,184 vessels engaged in the New South Wales trade in 1885
was 4,133,077 tons.


The prosperous advancement of the Colony is well exemplified
by the increases in the decennial figures shown hereunder: —

The trade of New South Wales expanded from £158,981,232
in 1862-71 to £262,679,613 in 1872-81; an increase of
£103,000,000, or 65 percent., on the latter period. The relative
growth of imports and exports was as follows :

Although the trade between the Australasian Colonies and
Great Britain was very large, that between the Colonies them-
selves was even greater, and immense good has been effected by
this commercial interchange.
The total value of the trade in 1885 amounted to —Imports,
£23,405,190; Exports, £10,541,745; or in all £40,000,941,
with a balance in favour of Imports of £0,923,451. These
figures exhibit an import trade of £24 15s. 0 - sd. and an export
trade of £l7 Bs. lTBd. per head of the population, which is
higher than those of any other Colony of the Australasian
group, both in the aggregate amount and in value per head of
population. The Imports from the United Kingdom amounted
to £11,985,597, and the Exports to £7,293,133. Trade with the
other British Colonies showed —Imports, £9,041,853; and
Exports, £7,292,557. Imports from Foreign States amounted
to £2,437,740, and Exports to £1,950,055.
Foreign Imports were principally from the United States,
£1,008,572 ; France, £345,231 ; Germany, £372,557; Belgium,
£195,318; China, £303,595; Java, £25,710; New Caledonia,
£82,181; Japan, £1,242; South Sea Islands, £30,929;
Philippine Islands, £715 ; Norway, £50,035 ; Sweden, £4,870.
The Exports to the United States were valued at £985,531 ;
New Caledonia, £153,094; Naples, £100,000; South Sea
Islands, £08,854; Honolulu, £10,999; Hongkong, £240,032;
Antwerp, £399,549; Rotterdam, £10,173; Hamburg, 29,511;
Italy, £1,709.

The following table exhibits the increase of trade, compared
with the Census population, in decennial periods: —
The public revenue has increased from £532,718 in 1851 to
£7,117,592 in 1881. Of the latter amount about £1,876,322
was obtained from Customs, £226,018 for stamps, and £120,028
from licenses. The land sales amounted to £1,363,183, tram-
ways £219,896, and the receipts from the national railways to
£2,082,117. The revenue from taxation is officially given at
£2 Bs. per head of the population for 1882. The tariff, which
is established for purposes of revenue only, is one of the simplest
in Australasia, free trade being the avowed policy of the Colony.
The industrial stability of the Colony is manifested by the
operations of its Banks, as during the decade 1871-1881, their
progress far exceeded the increase in population, their circulation
having nearly doubled, their deposits and advances more than
doubled, and their coin and bullion reached nearly half as much
again. The increase since the last decennial period has been
even more remarkable. On the 31st December, 1884, the
deposits in the New South Wales Banks amounted to £25,776,406
sterling. The amount to the credit of depositors in the Savings
Bank of New South Wales, £2,016,656 ; and in the Money
Order and Government Savings Bank Department, £1,467,804,
The total deposits in all banks in the Colony at the close of
1885 was then about £30,000,000, or about £3O per head of the
population. The large amounts to the credit of the depositors,
especially in Savings Banks, clearly show the existence of both
prosperity and thrift amongst the. working classes. The Public


Debt of New South Wales, on the 31st December, 1884,
amounted to £24,601,959, or £26 14s. 2d. per head of popula-
tion, and is only equal to 3| years’ revenue.
Mail Routes.
The principal means of communication with the United King-
dom is that provided weekly via Suez and Brindisi. There are
two separate contracts supplying this weekly communication;
one entered into in 1883, between the Government of New South
Wales and the Orient Steam Navigation Company for a fort-
nightly service; the other being a contract held for some years
past by the Government of Victoria with the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, also for a fortnightly
service. Mails are also forwarded every four weeks, via Auck-
land and San Francisco, by the steamers of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, under contract with the New Zealand
Government; via Torres Straits, by the Queensland Royal Mail
steamers; and via Marseilles, by the Messageries Maritimes
Company’s powerful line of steamers, under contract with the
Government of France.
The average time occupied in the transit of mails between
Sydney and London and vice versa, by the most expeditious of
the above-mentioned routes (that is, via Suez and Brindisi), is
thirty-nine days.
Rivers and Harbours.
Nearly all the coast rivers of New South Wales are to a
certain extent navigable.
The Richmond is navigable for ocean-going vessels as far as
Lismore on the north and Casino on the south arm, each about
65 miles from the sea. The river traverses a most fertile district,
and a large trade is carried on with the metropolis.
The Clarence is one of the finest rivers on the east coast of
Australia, and is navigated by large steamers as far as Grafton,


about 42 miles from the sea; small craft going as far as
Copmanhurst, 25 miles further up.
The river is the outlet for a large aud important district; and
the trade with Sydney, consisting of sugar, maize, &c., has reached
very considerable dimensions.
The Macleay, Hastings, aud Manning are also important
streams, lined with numerous wharves and shipping-places.
The Hunter, next to the Clarence is the most important river
in the Colony flowing into the Pacific; it is navigable on the
main arm as far as Morpeth, 27 miles from the sea.
The Hawkesbury, falling into Broken Bay, is the centre of a
considerable agricultural and timber district. Small craft go up
as far as "Windsor, 75 miles from the sea.
To the south of Sydney the principal streams are the Shoal-
haven, Clyde, and Moruya Rivers, each of some importance.
Besides these rivers, the following are the chief ports aud
harbours on this coast: —
Byron Bay, where a jetty of considerable size is being con-
structed, and which is to be the terminus of the railway from
New England to the Coast, will be hereafter the outlet of the
Brunswick and Upper Richmond River districts.
Trial Bay, midway between Sydney and Brisbane, affords an
excellent refuge for all classes of ships in S. and S.E. gales. A
prison has been erected on the hill overlooking the ocean, and it
is intended to employ the prisoners on the construction of a
breakwater which wdll make the bay safe shelter in all weathers.
Port Stephens, 25 miles north of Newcastle, has a bold deep
water entrance, affording complete shelter inside during all
weathers, and the estuary runs into the country due west for
about 14 miles, and has a water area larger even than Port
Jackson,
Newcastle, or Port Hunter, at the mouth of the river of that
name, is the great coal port of the Colony, and is provided with
every modern steam and hydraulic appliance for loading coal.


Vessels of 4,000 tons burden can be safely berthed there. The
amount of wharfage available is about 11,000 feet lineal.
Newcastle is at present the terminus of the Great Northern
Eailway, which has been constructed to within a few miles of the
Queensland border.
Lake Macquarie, a magnificent sheet of water, about 41 square
miles in area, lying about 15 miles south of Newcastle, is the
centre of a large coal basin. Extensive works for the improve-
ment of the entrance are being carried on, the effect of which
has already been beneficially felt.
Broken Bay, 10 miles north of Sydney Heads, at the mouth of
the Hawkesbury, is a fine harbour with a bold entrance, though
inferior to Port Jackson in the draught of water at the entrance.
Port Jackson —unsurpassed in the world —is separately
described on next page.
Botany Bay, 8 miles south of Sydney, receives the waters of
Cook’s and George’s Eivers, two small rivers. The area of the
bay is 211 square miles. The northern shore is connected to
Sydney by tramway, and the available land adjacent thereto is
rapidly being built on.
Jervis Bay, a large and sheltered bay, 100 miles south of
Sydney, is at present mainly resorted to as a harbour of refuge.
Twofold Bay, to the extreme south of the Colony, is 5 miles
from east to west, and 3 miles broad. On the northern shores of
the bay stands the town of Eden, the centre of a flourishing
district, whence a large trade is carried on with the neighbouring
Colonies.
Besides the above are Wollongong, Kiama, Ulladulla, Bate-
man’s Bay, Moruya, and Tathra, small harbours situated to the
south of Sydney, where breakwaters, wharves, and jetties
adapted to the coasting trade have been constructed. Most of
the southern ports are being connected with the metropolis by
railway.


Sydney and its Harbour.
The magnificent expanse of water called Port Jackson, with
its lake-like scenery, stretching for miles inland, is unrivalled
as a harbour, both for beauty and convenience. The high
and rocky coast of the Pacific is suddenly broken, and the
cliffs form a portal to an estuary of sufficient capacity to shelter
all the navies in the world. So completely is the harbour shut
in that, until an entrance is fairly effected, its capacity and safety
cannot be conjectured. A vessel making the port sails in a few
moments out of the long swell of the ocean into calm deep
water, protected on every side by high lands. The elevated shore
is broken into innumerable bays and inlets, extending inland for
miles. Some of the bays form of themselves capacious harbours.
The depth of water is sufficient for the largest ships afloat. The
harbour of Port Jackson, including a portion of the estuary of
the Parramatta Eiver, has an area of 15 square miles; Middle
Harbour, one of its arms, 3 square miles ; and the shore line of
the whole is IGS miles. Prom the Heads to the city the distance
is 5 miles, beyond which the waters extend for 8 miles further.
The breadth varies from f of a mile to 2 miles. There are
over 6 miles of Government and private wharves. Deep
water extends close up to the shores, enabling the largest steam-
ships to be berthed.
The inland rivers of the Colony are marked by entirely
different features to those flowing into the Pacific. All the
rivers rising on the western side of the great dividing chain
eventually join their waters into one stream, which retains the
name of the largest of the system—the Murray Eiver. The
main branches are the Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan,
each of which is in itself a considerable river.
The Murray, the greatest of Australian rivers, is over 2,300
miles in length, and its course for 1,800 miles is in New South
Wales territory. The river is navigable, under ordinary circum-
stances, from Lake Alexandria, where it empties itself into the
sea, to Albury, a distance of 1,350 miles, and navigation is


possible to Ournie Gold-field, 150 miles above Albury and 1,500
miles from the mouth.
On the banks of this river, both in New South Wales and
Victoria, are situated some important townships, the principal of
which is Albury, built at the point in the river first touched by
the pioneers who succeeded in crossing the continent, from
Sydney, to what is now the site of Melbourne, but which fifty
years ago was an untrodden wilderness. The railway from
Sydney to Melbourne crosses the Murray at Albury, and that
from Melbourne to Deuiliquin at Moama.
The Darling derives the great body of its waters from Queens-
land, but several considerable streams join it in this Colony.
The river may be navigated for some periods of the year as far
as the junction of the Bogan, a distance of 1,050 miles above
the Murray junction, and 1,550 miles from the sea. The total
course of the river, from its source to where it falls into the
Murray, is 2,700 miles. The river is tapped by the railway at
Bourke, and a line to Wilcaunia is also to be constructed.
The Murrumbidgee is a fine stream, joining the Murray 700
miles from the sea; it is navigable, except in dry seasons, as far
as the township of Gundagai, 670 miles above the junction. The
total course of the river is 1,350 miles, and its principal
tributary is the Lachlan. On its banks are situated several
rising towns, the chief among which is Wagga Wagga.
Sydney Water Supply.
The works for providing Sydney and its suburbs with an
abundant supply of fresh water are being rapidly carried out,
and will prove invaluable to the metropolitan district for sanitary
and manufacturing purposes. The works have been conceived
on a scale of magnitude commensurate with the certain growth
of the Queen City of Australia. The source of supply is the
united waters of the Nepean, Cordeaux, and Cataract Rivers,
mountain streams fed by the abundant rain which falls along the
coast district west of Wollongong. The works consist of 10£


miles of tunnels, one of them being 4 miles long, excavated in
the solid rock; 33i miles of open canal, miles of wrought-iron
flumes —8 feet, 7 feet 6 inches, and 6 feet diameter, and 11 miles
of 48" and 42" pipes. The conduits from the point of intake to
Sydney are about 63 miles in total length. At Prospect, a point
40 miles from the farthest source, a storage reservoir, with a
capacity of 11,000 millions of gallons, is in course of construction;
and the works above this reservoir are practically completed, and
have a maximum capacity of 150,000,000 gallons daily. The
conduits below Prospect consist of open canal, 6 feet wrought-
iron pipes, and 48" and 42" east-iron pipes. Por nearly 10 miles
the capacity of the works is 50,000,000 gallons daily, while for
the remaining portion of 11 miles the water is delivered through
the 48" and 42" pipes, having a daily capacity of about 20,000,000
gallons.
The main portion of the line has now been completed; all that
remains to be done to connect Sydney with the Nepean and
Cataract Eivers is the laying of 14 miles of pipes. Meanwhile
the gaps in the work have been covered by temporary pipes and
fluming, and the connection is now practically made.
When completed, the works will cost a sum slightly over two
millions sterling, of which £1,412,668 have been already
expended.
Besides the metropolis, the Government have carried out or
sanctioned the erection of waterworks at the chief country
towns; amongst others—Newcastle, Maitland, Morpeth,and the
mining townships of the Hunter River district, also Bathurst,
Goulburn, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Hay, Deniliquin, and some
others. A sum of £500,0C0 has been authorized for the con-
struction of these works, of which £373,756 have been expended.
Pastoral Wealth and Progress.
Probably no other country in the world has such resources, or
can show such progress in pastoral enterprise as New South
Wales. Natural pastures exist all over the Colony, but especially


in the western districts, where many varieties o£ the best fat-
tening grasses, herbage, and salt-bush flourish. The pastoral
holdings are constantly increasing in value, and very remunera-
tive prices are being obtained for wool and live stock. The total
area leased for pastoral purposes in 1882 is returned at 227,756
square miles, the rent being £306,948. There were 4,337
pastoral runs in 1882, some of them over 300,000 acres in extent.
There are many men in the Colony who, beginning life as shep-
herds, have realized wealth and affluence, and thousands have
made competent incomes, while several of the “ squatters,”
developed into landed proprietors, possess more than a hundred
thousand sheep depastured on their own freehold estates.
Live Stoch.
The finc-woolled sheep of the Colony came originally from the
choicest flocks of France, Spain, and Saxony. In the process of
acclimatization there has been a very decided improvement in the
softness, elasticity, and length of the wool, and lately, by careful
culling, a considerable increase in the weight. The average clip
is from to 6 lbs. of greasy, and about 3 lbs. of washed wool.
The average lambing is 80 per cent. The total increases
in the number of sheep for the Australasian Colonies for the
twenty years from 1861 to 1880 inclusive are computed by the
Chief Inspector of Stock to be as follows : —New South Wales,
628 per cent.; Victoria, 40| per cent.; South Australia, per
cent.; Queensland, 70| per cent.; Tasmania, 4| percent.; New
Zealand, 474 per cent.
Those who have imported and used Austrian and German rams
find that the tendency of the country and climate is to gradually
add to the length of the staple without much increasing the
stoutness of the fibre ; retaining at the same time its soundness,
softness, and colour, and even improving in that lustre and fine-
ness which makes a combing wool specially valuable. The
coarse-woolled sheep are chiefly depastured in the Coast districts,

where they thrive better than the merinos. Three-year old
wethers of this breed weigh when killed from IGO lbs. to 200 lbs.
each.
The production of wool has been largely increased in New
South Wales by fencing and subdividing the runs, utilizing the
outside country, and providing a better water supply by means
of dams and reservoirs, so that this industry is in a far better
position than it was twenty years ago. The value of the export
of wool from New South Wales amounted to £8,953,100 in 1884
for 173,986,303 lbs.; £7,246,642 in 1885 for 178,373,425 lbs.,
as compared with £4,748,160 in 1871.
The export of wool was in—
In 1885 the value of pastoral exports, including wool, tallow
skins, salt and preserved meats, and live stock, amounted to
£8,867,831. Out of the 29 millions increase in the number of
live stock in the Australasian Colonies during the last decade
(1871-1881), two-thirds, or 19f millions, were additions to the
head of stock of New South Wales, and in the last-named year
(1881) they reached 39i millions, against a total of 88f millions
for the whole of these Colonies.
The principal breeds of horned cattle are Shorthorns, Herc-
fords, and Devons. A few Ayrshires have lately been imported.
The finer specimens will compare favourably with most in
England. Agricultural Societies hold yearly exhibitions of stock
and produce in the chief districts of the Colony, and some bulls
and cows have realized over 1,000 guineas each. Eoot and mouth
disease, rinderpest, and other malignant diseases of cattle are
unknown in New South Wales.


All breeds of horses thrive exceedingly well. Animals worth
£2O here average about £BO in India. India draws largely from
New South Wales for remounts for her cavalry regiments.
The following returns show the progress and resources of New
South Wales in the matter of live stock: —
Horses. Horned Cattle. Sheep. Pigs.

1881 ... 364,306 ... 2,182,226 ... 36,591,946 ... 308,205
It will be seen from the above returns how great is the annual
increase in stock of all descriptions, and how eminently adapted
to pastoral purposes are the vast interior plains of the Colony.
Perhaps in no part of the world do animals thrive and fatten
more readily or with less cost than in Australia; the breeder
incurs no expense in housing or in providing fodder for the
winter, the climate being very mild throughout the year.
Agricultural Resources.
There are immense tracts of country adapted for profitable
cultivation. The operations of agriculture or husbandry are
never suspended by winter, owing to its mildness, and crops of
some sort or other may bo produced in succession from January
to December. Prom the agricultural returns for New South
Wales for the year 1884, it appears that the number of occupiers
of land, excluding pastoral tenants, was 43,079; the extent of
holdings, 35,035,504 acres ; land in cultivation, 852,017 acres ;
land enclosed but not in cultivation, 29,319,775 acres ; and land
in occupation but unenclosed, 4,803,712 acres. Many poor
farmers who began with small holdings have attained to wealth
and independence. Nearly a tenth of the entire population of
the Colony, are engaged in agricultural pursuits.


Cereals, Fruits, Sfc.
The best wheat-growing districts are to be found on the table
lands, from 2,000 feet to 4,000 feet above the sea-level. The
fine quality of the wheat grown on the Australian continent is
well known, and New South Wales can claim to produce some of
the best samples. The yield during the season 1884-5 was 1526
bushels per acre. The area of land in New South Wales under
grain crops and the quantity of produce obtained was as follows:
Wheat, 275,250 acres, yielded 4,203,894 bushels; maize, 115,000
acres, yielded 2,989,585 bushels; barley, 7,035| acres, yielded
148,869 bushels; oats, acres, yielded 425,920 bushels;
rye, I,llo£ acres, yielded 16,739 bushels ; millet, acres,
yielded 1,843 bushels ; sorghum and imphee, 41 acres, yielded
187 cwt. The acreage and produce of hay crops was —Wheat,
86,584 acres, yielding 87,328 tons ; barley, 2,173f acres, yielding
2,870 i tons ; oats, 121,922| acres, yielding 149,489 tons; sown
grasses, 15,966 acres, yielding 40,624| tons. The area under
green crop for cattle was —Maize, 6,771 acres ; barley, 3,7441
acres; oats, 3,109|- acres; rye, 933 i acres; millet, 157 i acres;
sown grasses, 123,024 acres ; sorghum and imphee, 2,7891 acres.
Tobacco is grown chiefly in the northern coast districts and in
the south-west. The quantity produced has varied considerably
from year to year, and for 1884-5 reached 1,109,396 lbs.
Maize is raised throughout the coast districts as far south as
the 36th parallel of latitude. The cultivation is easy, and the
crop is soon ready. A failure is rarely known. The yield on
the richer descriptions of land has been 80 and 100 bushels an
acre for the first crop, and 65 bushels an acre afterwards. The
average on the whole crop of the Colony in 1884 was 25 bushels
an acre; in 1885, 394,442 bushels, valued at £70,740. Large
quantities are annually exported.
Sugar-cane is now cultivated to a large extent, and the acreage
under cane increases largely year after year. In 1884-5 there
were 17,517£ acres under tillage, of which 6,997 acres produced


21,855,072 lbs. of sugar. The sugar-growing districts are on the
northern rivers. In 1884-5, 6,997 acres yielded 9,748 tons of
sugar, at the rate of nearly If ton per acre, and of the aggregate
value of £267,000. The sorghum or imphee, which has so much
saccharine matter, also thrives well.
The cultivation of the Vine is fast becoming a leading industry
in the Colony. There are districts of sufficient area, and com-
bining the necessary conditions of soil, climate, and aspect to
produce wine enough to supply the whole of the world. The
vine was introduced by Mr. John Macarthur about 1820, and in
1831 Mr. Busby made a voyage to Europe, and brought out a
valuable collection of plants from France and from the Ehine.
This was really the parent stock of the vine in New South Wales.
Wine-growing is an industry that requires time to bring it to
perfection, but Australian wines are stated by connoisseurs to be
rapidly improving in quality. Exhibiting abroad, under many
disadvantages, colonial vignerons have won high distinction at all
the late International Exhibitions—especially at that recently
held at Bordeaux. The judges of wine at the late Sydney
International Exhibition, consisting of representatives from
every wine-producing country in the world, recorded a unanimous
opinion to the effect that Australian wines are on the whole
excellent in quality, and destined to enter into successful com-
petition in the markets of Europe. One of the judges compared
the Valleys of the Hunter and the Paterson with those of tbe
Gironde and the Garonne, from which the best French wines are
obtained, stating that as the climate and soil of the former are
both favourable to wine production, the wines made in the
Colony will every year become more like the celebrated vintages
of France. The yield of wine has averaged from 100 gallons to
700 gallons per acre, though certain kinds of grapes have pro_
duced over 1,000 gallons per acre. The area of land occupied by
vines in 1884 was 4,584 acres; the quantity of wine produced
from 2,401f acres being 411,612 gallons, and of brandy 1,432
gallons. Grapes for table use covered an area of 1,321| acres,
and the quantity picked was ],4651 tons.


All the fruit o£ northern and southern Europe are grown
with success. The orange is cultivated most extensively, the
area so planted being acres in 1884-5, while the fruit
gathered amounted to 4,097,666 dozens. As many as 10,000
oranges have been obtained from individual trees. Oranges
are largely exported to the neighbouring Colonies, and many
proprietors of orangeries who began life in a very small way
have realized a fortune. The olive, caper, fig, strawberry,
raspberry, gooseberry, currant, custard-apple, guava, banana,
arachis nuts, almonds, passion-fruit, loquat, quince, plum,
nectarine, pear, apple, and peach, all thrive. Gardens and
orchards covered in 1884-5 an area of 20,416j acres. Fruit is
cheap, and is consumed in large quantities by all classes.
The potato grows w r ell, and the yield is large. Barley, oats,
&c., are grown chiefly for fodder. Lucerne hay may be cut
from four to six times in the year in favourable seasons on the
alluvial flats. Mangold-wurzel, turnips, and pumpkins are used
for the artificial feeding of the choicest cattle, but the native
grasses are quite sufficient for ordinary fattening purposes.
Arrowroot thrives ; cotton succeeds well on the northern rivers.
The bark of several indigenous acacias is used for tanning pur-
poses. The Eucalypti and other native trees have valuable
medicinal properties. The Bcehmeria, commonly known as the
rheea (or grass-cloth plant of China), and the New Zealand flax
are grown easily. The mulberry-tree thrives, and the finest
varieties of the silkworm have been introduced with success.
Mineral Wealth.
New South Wales abounds in minerals. The aggregate
value mined in New South Wales up to the end of 1884 was
£60,884,340, made up of the following amounts: —Gold,
£35,361,550; silver, £185,405*; coal, £15,453,984; kerosene
shale, £747,172; tin, £4,965,447; copper, £3,982,078; iron,
£188,074; while antimony, lead, asbestos, bismuth, and other
* Since ISB4 the yield has been very greatly increased. Vide page 39.


minerals were also gathered from the earth. The number of
miners employed in New South Wales at the census of 1881
was 18,873, engaged in the following mines : —Alluvial gold,
7,109; quartz ditto, 1,947; tin, 4,530; copper, 1,177 ; bismuth,
12 ; coal, 4,297, The total area under mineral lease and appli-
cation to lease was, in the same year (1881), 111,014 acres.
The value of the minerals raised during the ten years ending
1841 was £81,275 ; 1851, £634,937; 1861, £14,276,637; 1871,
£16,638,574 ; ending 1881, £23,441,890.
Gold.
The Gold-fields extend with short intervals throughout the
entire length of the Colony. The approximate auriferous area
as far as known is about 70,000 square miles. It is highly
probable that rich and extensive gold-fields will be discovered
for many years to come. There are immense tracts in the
interior which have not yet been prospected.
All the principal gold-fields of the west are within two days
journey of the capital, and there is not any mining settlement
which may not be easily reached. The gold-mining centres
present the appearance of orderly and thriving townships,
with schools, churches, journals, shops, and places of amusement.
The authority to dig or mine for gold costs only 10s. a year, and
entitles its possessor not only to take up ground for mining, but
also to occupy a quarter of an acre of land for his dwelling, or an
acre for a business site. Mineral licenses are also obtainable at
a cost of 20s. per year, entitling the holder to occupy from 4 to
640 acres of Crown Land for the purpose of searching for
minerals other than gold. The number of miners’ rights issued
at the several gold-fields of New South Wales in the year 1884
was 9,607. Mineral leases numbered 2,858, and business
licenses 1,234, The steam-engines employed in quartz-mining
numbered 58, with an aggregate of 756-horse power. There
were also 45 crushing machines, and 227 stamp-heads. In
alluvial mining there were employed 26 steam-engines, with an
aggregate of 304-horse power.


The quantity of gold received in 1881 for coinage at the Sydney
Mint, the produce of New South Wales, amounted to 101,933
ounces, of the gross value of £386,670, the average price per
ounce being £3 13s. Bd. The Western Districts produced
38,821 ounces, the Southern 26,711 ounces, the Northern 7,417
ounces, and localities not described 31,951 ouuces.
Silver and Lead.
Valuable lodes have been found in various parts of New South
Wales. Previous to the year 1884, the mines at Boorook were
the principal ones worked. The value of the silver produced in
the Colony during 1883 amounted to £18,563 ; but in 1884 the
argentiferous lead lodes of the Silverton district, in the Barrier
Eanges, near the Western boundary of the Colony, were opened,
and from them, during 1885, silver and silver-lead ore to the value
of £108,281 was exported. During 1885 the quantity of ore
furuaced at the Sunny Corner mine, in the Bathurst district, w T as
24,547 tons, producing 634,016 ounces of silver and 6,413 ounces
of gold. The value of the silver and silver-lead ore produced in
New South Wales during the ten years ending 31st Decenber,
1885, amounted to £400,500. Much of the silver-lead ore raised
in the Silverton district was shipped to Europe for treatment;
but latterly, both at Silverton and at Sunny Corner, smelting
works have been established. Several lodes, one of which extends
for one mile in length, containing rich silver ore, chiefly fahlerz,
associated with galena and blende, are now being opened in the
Vegetable Creek district. Metallic silver in ingot is exhibited
from the Sunny Corner silver-mine, Mitchell, and from the
Barrier Eange Silver-mining Company, Silverton.
Coal.
The Colony of New South Wales possesses the richest, most
accessible and extensive coal and cannel-coal seams in the
Southern Hemisphere, which must ultimately make it the greatest
and richest of all the Australian Colonies. The approximate


area o£ the carboniferous strata is estimated at 23,950 square
miles, and thick coal seams crop out along the coast and mountain
ranges from Pier Head, near Lake Macquarie, to Newcastle
Harbour, a distance of 18 miles, on the northern edge of the great
coal basin. Prom Coal Cliff to near Shoalhaven, a distance of 45
miles at the southern side of it, and on the western side at the
Blue Mountains, Lithgow Valley, Wallerawang &c., thick coal
and cannel-coal seams crop out alongside the railway from the
metropolis to the western interior, and in the gorges and gullies
on each side of the line ; whilst on the Southern and "Western
Eailways similar outcrops of coal and cannel-coal occur.
The mines, first opened in 1802, are situated in the immediate
vicinity of Newcastle, and it is from there that the Colony obtains
its largest supply, where the shipment of coal is carried on by
hydraulic and steam cranes, and shoots, capable of loading 16,200
tons per day.
Vertical sections and diagrams of the coal seams worked in the
northern, southern, and western districts are exhibited. The
production of coal has increased very rapidly of late years. In
1833, 328 tons were raised ; whilst in 1884, 2,749,109 tons, valued
at £1,303,077, were raised, at an average price of 9s. per ton.
The coal is of excellent quality for steam, household, smelting,
and gas purposes, and the largest exports are to Victoria, Hong
Kong, San Francisco, South Australia, Manila, Japan, Valparaiso,
Honolulu, India, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Queensland, more
than 1,000 vessels being annually engaged in this traffic.
A variety of cannel-coal commonly called “ kerosene shale,”
similar to the once famous Boghead mineral of Scotland, but
yielding a much larger percentage of volatile hydro-carbons than
the Scotch Boghead, occurs in saucer-shaped deposits from a few
inches to 5 feet thick. The richest quality yields upwards of 150
gallons of crude oil per ton, or 18,000 cubic feet of gas, with an
illuminating power of thirty-eight to forty-eight sperm candles ;
and on this account it is found advantageous for mixing with
ordinary coal in the manufacture of gas, and is largely exported


to Great Britain, America, and other foreign countries, as well
as the neighbouring Colonies, for gas purposes. Two Companies
manufacture petroleum oil and other products therefrom. The
quantity raised in 1884 was 31,618 tons, valued at £72,176.
Copper, Tin, tyc.
Copper lodes are found in many districts. Some of the ores
are extremely rich. The quantity of copper raised in the
Colony was 7,233 tons in 1884, valued at £363.854, against
1,452 tons in 1872, valued at £105,888.
The occurrence of Tin was first made known in 1852 by the
late Eev. W. B. Clarke, but it was not commercially worked till
1872. The tin is of the very best quality, and takes rank beside
the Straits Settlements tin in the English market. Tin-mining
shows a much larger development in New South "Wales during
the decade than copper-mining, and the annual value of the
metal produced now exceeds even that of the gold or coal. The
quantity of tin raised in the Colony was 5,256 tons in 1884,
valued at £207,828, against 896 tons in 1871, valued at £47,703.
Other Minerals. —Large deposits of iron ore occur in many
widely separated districts. The principal ore is hematite. In
several places there are coal, limestone, and iron in immediate
proximity. At Mittagong in the south, and Lithgow in the
west, iron ore is found in large quantities. The ores of lead,
zinc, and bismuth, occur in several localities. Cinnabar is found
in the Mudgee district. Antimony ores are being increasingly
worked in the Macleay and other districts. Diamonds, opals,
rubies, sapphires, and other gems have been found in various
parts. The number of diamonds found in New South Wales up
to the end of 1880 was estimated at 10,000, the largest being
one of 5| carats, or 16 2 grains.
Industries and Manufactures
The progress of New South Wales in manufacturing indus-
tries is very marked. The latest and most approved labour-
saving appliances and steam-driven tools have been introduced,


and the manufacturers here are able to compete with those of
Europe in the supply of many local requirements. Some of the
manufactures in New South Wales have a steady export trade,
clearly showing that the articles produced are cheaper and
better than those obtainable from any other source. The
Registrar-General has returned the number of manufactories
and works in existence, and the number of hands employed
during the year 1884 to be as follows ; —Connected with or
dependent on agriculture, 207 establishments, employing 3,677
hands ; working on raw materials the production of the pastoral
interest, 322 establishments, employing 3,103 hands ; manufact-
ure of food of which the raw material is not the produce of
agriculture and of articles of drink, &c., 341 establishments,
employing 2,474 hands; building materials and plastic manu-
factories, 925 establishments, employing 7,106 hands ; machine
manufactories, brass, lead, and iron works, 239 establishments,
employing 3,500 hands ; miscellaneous works and manufactories,
1,302 establishments, employing 17,637 hands. At the close of
the year 1884 there were in operation in New South Wales 161
mills for grinding and dressing grain, employing 3,207-horse
power, 404 stones, and 662 hands.
The waters of the Colony abound with fish. The bays and
estuaries along the coast furnish natural oyster-beds many miles
in length. The whale-fisheries are deserving of notice, though of
late years they have been neglected.
Wine-making is a settled industry. The wines of the Albury
district, in the south, are known in all the neighbouring Colonies
as well as in London. The produce of the Hunter Eiver districts
has won medals at the Great International Exhibitions of Europe.
The production in 1873 was 451,450 gallons of wine and 996
gallons of brandy ; and in 1884 it reached 411,612 gallons of
wine and 1,423 gallons of brandy. The consumption of native
wines is increasing every year in Australia. There were sixty
breweries in 1884, which turn out large quantities of beer and
ale of very fair quality.


Tobacco of local manufacture is finding its way into favour.
Large quantities of Virginian leaf are imported for this pur-
pose, and the colonial-grown leaf is also much used. One of
the largest manufacturers of tobacco in the world, from Virginia
in the United States, has fitted up extensive premises in Sydney.
The quantity manufactured in 1884 was 18,718 cwt.
The meats of New South "Wales have acquired a great reputa-
tion abroad. Some of the largest steamships trading to Austra-
lian ports are provided with refrigerating chambers, in which are
stored large quantities of fresh meat, frozen in the carcass, for
European markets. Salted, preserved, and fresh meats to the
value of £182,746 were exported in 1884, and £179,307 in 1885.
The manufacture of jams and confectionery, aerated waters, &c.,
gives employment to numerous hands.
The manufacture of leather and the industries in connection
therewith employ nearly 5,000 hands. In 1884 the value of
colonial manufactured boots and leather exported amounted to
£179,926. Sydney carried off many prizes and medals for such
manufactures at the Sydney and Melbourne International Exhi-
bitions.
With wool in abundance, the manufacture of cloths , tweeds ,
blankets, &c., is being developed, and first awards were won for
some of these articles at the last Sydney Industrial Exhibition.
In 1884 the production was upwards of 155,000 yards of cloth
and tweeds. There are several large clothing manufactories,
giving employment to hundreds of persons.
Illuminating and lubricating oils are manufactured from kero-
sene shale. Soap is largely made, and the weight manufactured
in 1884 was 131,244 cwt. In the same year tallow was exported
to the value of £197,707, and 24,640 cwt. of candles were
manufactured.
Metals, Earths, SfC.
In iron the manufactures of New South Wales promise to
attain to large dimensions. The iron foundries and engineering
establishments have produced iron steamships, dredges, light-


houses, locomotives, bridges, cylindrical piers, and agricultural
implements. Every description of the heaviest kinds of rough
work, as well as the finest kinds of work required for engines, is
turned out. There are also several factories for the production
of galvanized iron. At Eskbank, Lithgow, iron is made from
its ores, and both wrought iron and steel are being manu-
factured.
Eor reducing copper and tin ores there are numerous smelting-
works. The poorer copper ores from neighbouring Colonies are
sent to be smelted near the collieries in New South Wales. The
increased production of mineral ores has necessitated a corre-
sponding increase in smelting-works, from ten in 1871 to four-
teen in 1884, employing 913 hands. In 1884 the export of tin
and copper ingots and ores was valued at over £937,000,
nearly £571,682 worth of which was mined in New South
Wales.
The manufacture of bricks, encaustic tiles, drain-pipes, and
other descriptions of pottery is carried on by the aid of steam-
driven machinery. There is constant building work going on in
the numerous cities and towns which are springing up in all parts
of the country. Sydney especially has of late years entered on a
course of architectural improvement, the old stores and shops
giving place to magnificent warehouses and manufactories.
Marble, granite, freestone, and limestone are to be found in
abundance in the Colony ; and work in earth and stone furnishes
employment to many thousands of masons, brickmakers, potters,
and other artisans.
Ship-building, Docks, SfC
There is a Government Dock at Cockatoo Island, Port Jackson,
in which H.M.S. “ Galatea,” of 26 guns and 3,227 tons, was
docked. Mort’s Dock is also capable of accommodating the
largest class of mail steamers that come to the port. The Aus-
tralian Steam Navigation Company has a slip capable of taking
up a vessel of 1,500 tons, and there are also smaller private slips


and floating docks. Another Government dock is being con-
structed at Cockatoo Island, which will take in the largest vessel
now afloat.
103 vessels were built in New South Wales in the year 1884,
consisting of G4 steamers, 11 schooners, 1 harquantine, 4
lighters, 9 luggers, 3 cutters, and 11 ketches, showing an
aggregate of 7,663 tons.
There are numerous varieties of valuable timber in New South
Wales, useful for every description of ship and house building
and furniture. Already there is an export trade in cut and sawn
timber of considerable value. The export in 1884 was valued at
£102,041. There are numerous steam joineries for The supply of
woodwork of houses and of furniture. All the cabs, carriages,
carts, drays, omnibuses, and other vehicles required are made in
the Colony, and proof of the skill of the workmen in this depart-
ment of industry may be seen in the carriages which daily run
along the thoroughfares of the capital. The reported area of
woods and forests under the care of the Conservator in New
South Wales amounted according to the census of 1881 to
3,759,796 acres, and the timber cut from them during the year
amounted to 3,923,727 feet, from which a revenue of £10,156
was obtained.
Conclusion.
The object of this pamphlet is to provide such information as
will accurately describe the soil, climate, and resources of New
South Wales, as well as to show the actual progress the Colony
has already made. To accomplish this, facts and figures have
been collected from the Statistical Register, and from other
authentic sources, which will enable the reader to readily form
an opinion for himself. It is satisfactory to be able to demon-
strate that the Colony has such natural advantages in its posi-
tion, its soil, and its great wealth in coal, iron, gold, copper, tin,
and other minerals, that abundance and happiness pervade all


classes of the community, and that the materials exist for pro-
viding the like blessings to many millions; that the country is
governed by a constitutional Grovernment and liberal laws, which
give every possible security to life and property. With such
natural, political, and educational advantages New South Wales
has the brightest future before her, and cannot fail to become
the home of an immense population of prosperous and enlightened
people.
