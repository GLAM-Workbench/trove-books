REPORT
OF THE
HON. SEC. GENERAL COMMITTEE,
Read and Adopted at Meeting of Delegates
October 22nd, 1886.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, —
I have the honor to submit my Report.
At the Meeting of Delegates held in Camperdown on 24th
February, 1886, it was unanimously resolved that all moneys
then held or afterwards collected by the various Committees
be paid into one General Fund, to be allocated as follows; —
Colac, 46 per cent., Camperdown 46 per cent., Panmure
8 per cent. The actual amount paid in to the Fund, as shown
by the accompanying Statement, was £7024 35., of which
amount the sum of £3 ss. was paid for advertising the close of
the Fund, and 7s. lid. for postage, stationery, and cheques.
In accordance with the General Committee's resolution, the
balance was divided, Colac and Camperdown receiving
£3229 Ss. 9d. each, and Panmure £561 12s. lid.
That there has been such a liberal response on behalf of
this Fund must be very gratifying to all concerned, and is
another proof that the generosity of our fellow-colonists is never
appealed to in vain.
During the six months over which the collection and
distribution of this Fund have extended, I have frequently
been brought in contact with the majority of the sufferers, and
have had ample opportunity of hearing their various opinions
concerning it. The conclusion I have arrived at is simply
this, that every pound paid to the suffererers has been of
double value to them, for it has enabled them to take ad


vantage of conditions caused by the fire, and which, without
such assistance, would have proved sources of complete ruin.
The fire gave the forest such a clearing of scrub and vermin
as it has never had before, but at the same time it swept away
the houses and fences of the settlers, as well as their crops and
machinery; and when we take into consideration the fact that
the selector’s w’hole capital was invested in his improvements,
we can see how complete the ruin would have been, apart from
assistance. Such assistance came however, and the majority of
the sufferers are actually now almost in as good a position as
they were before the fire; for though they may not have
received cash compensation to the value of improvements lost,
their holdings have been cleared of an amount of scrub and
timber that years of labour would have failed to remove.

Hon. Sec. General Co7nmitlee.

REPORT
OF THE
CAMPERDOWN COMMITTEE,
Read and adopted at Meeting of Delegates,
October 22nd, 1886.

HON. SEC. ... Mr. F. Rae.
HON. TREAS. ... Mr. H. C. Heales.

The Chairman and Gentlemen of the
General Committee.
We have the honor to submit our report of the distribution
of money entrusted to us in connection with the Heytesbury
Forest Fire Relief Fund.
We have received £3229 Bs. 9d. from general fund, and
£29 17s. 3d. as special donations for particular individuals,
making a total of £3259 6s. Of this amount £3207 Gs. lid.
was paid to, or on behalf of the sufferers, and the balance,
£sl 19s. Id., in expense of distribution. These expenses in-
clude the printing of the General Committee, so that the actual
cost of distribution in our district has been less than 1y 2 per
cent, of the amount distributed.
When the movement first started in this district much
practical sympathy was immediately shown by the people, both
here and in Warrnambool, and supplies of food and clothing
were at once forwarded to the forest to relieve pressing ne-
cessities, and avert any further possible disaster from want of
food or exposure. It was found, however, that the fire had


been so extensive, and the suffering so great, that local aid
would be totally unable to render anything like an adequate
relief, and consequently an appeal to the colony at large was
decided upon..
Steps were taken to obtain an approximate estimate of the
losses, and this was submitted to the Mayor of Melbourne,
whereupon a public meeting was called in the Town Hall to make
the matter thoroughly well known, the result being that a wide-
spread interest was excited, and subscriptions came readily to
hand. Delegates were then appointed from the contributing
centres to arrange as to distribution. The meeting was held on
24th February, and 4G per cent, of total money collected was
allotted to Camperdown. The Camperdown Committee, re-
cognising the general principle that the money collected was to
help to retain the selectors on their holdings, made careful en-
quiries as to individual losses, causing each sufferer to make an
affidavit as to the character and extent of his losses. These
were then tabulated, and each case was considered separately.
The question of re-erection of homesteads was first con-
sidered, and the Committee accepted tenders for building
several classes of houses according to size of family or to par-
ticular kind of house desired by the owner—with the reservation,
of course, that the price was not to exceed a certain stated
limit. Any sufferers who preferred building their own houses
were allowed to do so and were paid for them the same as if
built by strangers. After the erection of houses had been
attended to, the Committee further considered the question of
improvements, and divided the sufferers into four classes—not
according to the amount of their losses, but according to their
actual necessities and individual circumstances—the Ist class
receiving 12s. Gd., the 2nd 10s., the 3rd 7s. Gd., and the 4th ss.
in the £, of the loss allowed by the Committee. From the
committees on the spot, Port Campbell and Scott’s Creek, the
Camperdown Committee received material information and
assistance in arriving at the actual value of the loss.
'Fo ensure the retention of selectors on their land, payments
of over £ls were not made until the Committee were assured
that reasonable attempts had been made to replace fencing and
other improvements that had been burnt down. Inspection of
work done was thus rendered necessary, and a small expense
had to be incurred ; but the work done was by this means made
known to the Committee, who were therefore satisfied that the
money given was used towards improving the land. During
the progress of the improvements, the sufferers were supplied
with orders which enabled them to obtain any necessaries they


required at the expense of the Committee. In a few excep-
tional cases the claims were satisfied in full, and to all the
assistance given was most acceptable. Without this practical
sympathy, much suffering and misery must have ensued, whilst
with it, there is no doubt comfort and happiness have been the
result. Letters expressing heartfelt gratitude have been re-
ceived from many of the sufferers, and it is pleasing to note
that as a whole the decisions of the Committee have been
received with a ready acquiescence that speaks well for those
who have made homes in the forest.
During the distribution, a deal of steady work was required
to see to the proper disposal of the Committee’s funds ; and to
Mr. Frank Rae, Hon. Secretary, much credit is due for the
time and attention bestowed by him on this labour of love.
It is felt that the care with which he managed all the details
was the means of saving a great deal of the amount distributed.
The Committee have also to record the liberality of Mr. Opie,
the proprietor of the Camperdown Chronicle, who gave them
the free use of the columns of that paper. To the editor and
staff of the Chronicle are due thanks for valuable assistance
rendered by them on every occasion, and no small amount of
the success of the movement was the result of the energy and
liberality of the Press of the Colony in furnishing available
news and circulating authentic information regarding theravages
of the fire.
A word may now be said about some late claims that were
sent in after much of the money had been distributed. These
involved losses to the extent of nearly £2OOO. The Committee
decided that these claims could not be entertained, principally
on the following grounds : —Due notice had been given of the
necessity of claims being forwarded by a certain time, and a
liberal extension was allowed. The delegates apportioned the
funds according to the total claims for each district, so that
had these claims been forwarded in time a much larger amount
would have been available for this district. It may be regretted
that these claims could not be considered on their merits, but
it would have been manifestly unfair to have taken money
delegated for the relief of investigated and submitted cases,
and applied it for the relief of those who had not thought it
worth while applying at the proper time.

Chairman, Camperdown Committee.

Gentlemen,
We have the honour to report that, in accordance with
your direction, we have made a final distribution to the sufferers
by the fire, amounting to £l2OB 10s. This, with the previous
allocation of £l9OO 55., gives a total of £BlOB ss. paid on ac-
count of losses.
The amount received from the Central Committee, Camper-
down, was £8229 Bs. 9d., being 40 per cent, of the total
amount collected —the Camperdown Committee having received
40 per cent, and Panmure 8.
After payment of expenses and making a gift to the Hon.
Secretary in acknowledgment of his services, a balance of
£l9 17s. 9d. remains for contingencies, as per Statement.
The Colac district contribution to the General Fund was
£492 Os. 9d., which was remittted to the Central Committee
(less expenses).
We have the honor to be,
Your obedient Servants,
THOS. COLLINS,
Chairman.

REPORT
OF THE
PANMURE COMMITTEE.
Chairman, General Committee.
Sir,
I beg to submit herewith the Balance Sheet of
Receipts from the Hon, Treasurer and Expenditure of the
Fund by the Panmure Committee, whose supervision has
extended over the Parish of Laang and part of Tallangatta.
It is my first duty to record the unanimous thankfulness
expressed by the settlers for the generous liberality of the
contributors to this Fund, which has practically reinstated
them on their holdings.
On the 7th January subscription lists were opened at
Panmure for the relief of those who had lost their homes, and
on the 13th January a public meeting was held, convened by
Mr. Vickers, when the following gentlemen were appointed to
supervise the collection and distribution of relief
Mr. J. DRAYTON ... Chairman.
Mr. R. VICKERS .. Hon. Sec.
Mr. C. A. FARRAN ... Hon. Treas.
Messrs. J. Clarke, J. Gibson, G. Nicol, T. Murnane, D. Pulhara, J. O’Brien,
A. Rollo, S. Barber, H. Weatherhead, W. Wickenton,
and Rev. W. H. Scott.
An inspection of sites of homesteads was made on 14th
January, and reported on the 10th, when a resolution was
passed to give letters of credit varying in amount from £ls 6s.
to £3O to the three families living under canvas, feeling assured
that when once the spring of public generosity commenced to


flow, it would be, as it has proved, almost inexhaustible.
In accordance with a recommendation from the General
Committee, letters of credit were issued immediately after the
first dividend was paid to the Distributing Committees.
These, however, were considered by the Panmure Committee
to be too restrictive, as the settlers were replacing their losses
as quickly and substantially as possible ; accordingly, a resolu-
tion was passed to pay a first instalment, deducting accounts
rendered before the 27th March, on the basis laid down by the
General Committee, which amounted to 20s. in the £ to those
who had lost houses.
The final payment, of necessity, from the first,
those who had lost houses having been paid in lull, it became
requisite to apportion the final dividend on a basis of 25 per
cent, for second grade and 75 per cent, for third grade of
estimated loss, which was paid on 20th August. [See detail
appended].
No. 1 grade has received 20s. in the £, No. 2 10s. 3d, and
No. 3 7s. Ij4d., the average dividend being about 9s. lid. in
the £, and the cost of administration less than 2 per cent.

THE
FINAL MEETING OF DELEGATES
Was held in the Shire Hall , Camperdown ,
on Friday, ‘Find October, 1886.
HON. J. WILLIAMSON IN THE CHAIR.
Minutes of previous meeting were read and confirmed.
General Committee’s Report and Balance Sheet were
adopted, as were also Reports and Balance Sheets from Colac,

It was decided to have the reports and balance sheets

On the motion of Messrs. Rae and Vickers, it was unani-
mously resolved that a special vote of thanks be accorded to
Press and the Public for the generous response to the appeal
on behalf of the Forest Fire Relief Fund.
Votes of thanks were also passed to the Hon. Secs, of the
various Committees, and to Hon. J. Williamson, Chairman.
The Chairman then declared the Forest Fire Relief Fund
