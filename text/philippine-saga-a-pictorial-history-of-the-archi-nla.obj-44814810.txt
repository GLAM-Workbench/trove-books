THE PHILIPPINE SAGA
A PICTORIAL HISTORY OF THE ARCHIPELAGO SINCE TIME BEGAN
PROF. H. OTLEY BEYER
University of the Philippines
rIS is the story of the Philippines, and the men
and women who peopled it since the remote
dawn of Time. The essential data on which the
story of our ancestors is based come from many
sources, and the historical era covered falls into
these three broad periods:
I. The Prehistoric Philippines: This era covers
the period from the unrecorded beginnings to a
point in time roughly coinciding with the begin-
nings of the Christian Era, and we must rely for
knowledge of it entirely upon the scientific find-
ings of geologists and archaeologists.
11. The Protohistoric Period: This span of time
reaches from the beginnings of the Christian Era
to the time of Magellan’s landing in the Philip-
pines, and our knowledge of it comes from some
scattered historical records, supplemented by great
quantities of data supplied by Historic Archaeo-
logy. as differentiated from Prehistoric Archaeo-
logy.
IH. The Historic Teriod: These four-plus centu-
ries from Magellan’s landing to our present day
are amply documented by printed records and ma-
nuscript literature, additionally supported by pic-
tures of actual events.
♦ ♦ *
Twenty-five years ago, our prehistoric past was
almost a complete blank. Now, however—thanks
patient archaeological investigation—we
r can accurately fill in considerable sections of it.
Our backward bird’s-eye view of Philippine pre-
history shows six distinct cultural “horizons” clear-
ly standing out.
First, there is the primitive human type similar
to the Java Man of 250,000 years ago. His ear-
liest stone implements and fossil remains have
been found in Rizal, Bulacan and Batangas prov-
inces, recording a culture he brought to the islands
by slow overland migrations more than a quarter
of a million years ago. This primitive man was
accompanied by such huge mammals as the Stege-
elephant ar d the rhinoceros. Our earliest
Man-of-the-Phili’ipines wore little or no clothing,
and lived only in the caves nr rock shelters pro-
vided by nature. He on such raw food
as he was able his surroundings by
means of he tools which were his
only artificial probable that
this Earliest Man became extinct
°bout the time of the last glacier-" iod, along with
the large land mammals of his tune. Apparently
no living descendants of this primitive human sur-
vive in these islands today.
the historical curtain rises'unuch later,
■I 25,000 to 30,000 years ago. when the ancestors

bridges then in existence. The Ne-

plements, known as microliths, some of which were
used as points for their arrows and darts, and for
scraping and cutting bamboo and wood. They had
learned to build very crude shelters of tree
branches and leaves, and probably wore primitive
clothing and ornaments made of bark and leaves.
The descendants of the Australoid-Sakai type con-
stitute about Vi per cent of our present population,
while the proto-Malay descendants form about
»%%.
Thirdly, a very different group of people, our
first seafarers, crossed the horizon of Philippine
history from the north some 5,000 to 6,000 years
ago. They had learned to make and sail well-
made plank-built boats. > They were the people of
the Early New Stone Age, who had ground or po-
lished stone axes, adzes, chisels and other tools,
round or oval in cross-section, which tell archaeo-
logically of a much advanced culture and crafts-
manship. They lived in grass-covered houses with
wooden frames, having rounded roofs much like a
modern Quonset hut, built directly on the ground
or over a pit dv. meter or more in the ground.
They constructed some roughly-built tone walls
around their homes, practiced dry agriculture,
growing chiefly millet and yams. Their clothin :
was probably still undecorated skins and bark.
Their culture is nowadays classified as Early Neo-
lithic, or “Indonesian A”. These tall, slender mi-
grants left their blood and heritage to the Philip-
pines, and their descendants constitute about 12
per cent of our population today.
Fourth in the grev waves of immigration came
about 1500 B. C., and continued for approximately
a •millenium. These latter visitors were also sea-
learing, coming from the Indo-China and south
China coast to Luzon and Formosa in good-sized
dug-out boats. Their distinguishing cultural con-
tributions were houses with pyramidal roofs raised
above the ground on four posts, advanced small
woodworking tools, made of very hard stones such
as nephrite or ancient jade, which were rectangular
or trapezoidal in cross-section. They practiced ex-
tensive dry agriculture, and introduced upland rice,
taro (gabe), new varieties of cultivated yams and
other valuable food crops. Their clothing was
beaten bark cloth, often intricately decorated with
fine designs, printed in colors with stone or wood-
en blocks. Many stone bark-cloth beaters and
printers have been found among the remains of
their ancient villages. This fourth migration is
known as the “Indonesian B” or Late Neolithic,
and descendants of these doughty seafarers num-
ber 18 per cent of the present population.
Fifth in the chain of incursions was probably a
continuation of the fourth, but was marked by a
distinctly improved and advanced culture, featured
by the first use of metals. This fifth group began
arriving between 800 and 500 B. C., and brought
with them copper and bronze tools and ornaments.
This group also retained the green jade ornaments
and small tools of their immediate predecessors.
Jtseems probable that this advanced group in-

recent industrial age. Unfortunately, many of the
most interesting arts and crafts of this highly
developed culture were unable to resist the com-
petition of modem manufactured goods, and they
gradually died out when the era of extensive trade
and commerce began. These Early Iron Age folk
were the ancestors of 37 per cent of our present
population.
The remaining 20 per cent of the population are
descended from forebears who came into the islands
during the Christian Era. to the present time. Of
this group, the Hindus contributed five per cent
of the present population, the Arab-Persian stocks
two per cent, the Chinese and other East Asians
ten per cent, and the European and American, three
per cent.
So, it can be seen readily that the welding and
fusion of successive cultures and the mingling of
the blood of wave upon wave of migrants, have
produced a distinct and true “Filipino Blend” type
of man distinctly peculiar to these islands at the
crossroads of the Pacific. In many individuals,
the original types are still clearly distinguishable
but the true “Filipino Blend” type is constantly
increasing and, doubtless, will ultimately come to
include the majority of the population. In this
blend, the original racial components do not stand
out'Clearly, and the end of 30,000 years of
commingling ~©l-4he Prehistoric, Protohistoric and
Historic peoples is a new racial with its own
particular characteristics.


CHAPTER 1
ILoitg ago, in the last glacial period (Pleistocene) the waters of the oceans surrounding the Philippines dropped at least 156 feet below
present levels, and vast bodies of land now under water were exposed, connecting the islands with the mainland of Southeast Asia.
These land bridges became the “highway of history” as the men of that far-away time, questing then as now for a better life, followed the land
bridges to the Philippines. The shaded areas shown on the map were dry land in that period of man’s migration. This we know from sub-
marine soundings. Gradually the waters gained as the ice melted over the world, and eventually the land bridges were submerged, but not
before restless Man, in the dawn of time, had found his way to the Philippines.
2 Wild animals followed the routes over the land bridges to the Philippines, too. The Dawn Man, similar to the Java man recently unearthed
by archeologists, saw elephants and the ponderous rhinoceros in his overland travels to the Philippines. These great beasts survived until
comparatively recent times in o& archipelago. Powerfully-muscled, heavy-jawed and hairy, the Man of that time wore few clothes, was just
learning to shape nature to his bidding and to make crude tools.


O These primitive migrants to the Philippines belonged to the stone Age- They killed fish with sharpened stones, ate snails, crabs and al-
most any other living thing they could catch and kill.
A This second wave of home-seekers
” was composed of two types, (a) the
short, round-headed, curly-haired Aus-
traloid-Negrito and (b) the Australoid-
Sakai type, remnants of which still in-
habit the Philippine rain forests.
C These prehistoric “taos” lived in nat-
• ural caves, and their only posses-
sions were primitive stone tools. Only
rarely were they able to capture larger
animals, during which occasion they
held tribal feasts.
L The second wave of immigrants
** across the land bridges came about
25,000 to 30,000 years ago, the ancestors
of the pygmy remnants still living in
remote corners nf the Philippines. They

addition, they traded more or less with
their neighbors, exchanging forest pro-
ducts such as rattan and beeswax for
cloth and ornaments.


7 The Little People did not depend on caves
for shelter. At first, they built crude
lean-to shelters, of palm or banana leaves
fastened to a frame, which kept them out of
the rain.
Q The Little People had learned the secret
® of making fire, one of the giant strides in
culture. They rubbed two sticks together un-
til friction ignited the tinder or dry cogon
grass fed into the friction area.
A Later on, the lean-to was developed into a family-sized shelter, as the Little
" People advanced and improved their knowledge.

■ but of solid workmanship. (All found in Luzon sites.)


• m out of the north came a third wave of migration to the Philippines some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, .5,000 to 4,000 B. C. The land bridges
I I were under water, but these venturesome folk braved the great seas to reach the islands.
I*% These people w r ere tall and
slim, the ancestors of the
Indonesian “A” type. Their
hieh noses are scarcely paral-
leled among other Mongoloid.
10 They came in sturdy,
* pVasak-built boats, which
shoved a great advance in
craftsmanship. Wooden
an«i rattan lashings held the
of4,he boats together. On
the larger war vessels, a plat-
form raised above the middle
length of the hull served the
fighters; and they in turn were
protected by an awning of
mats.


t 4 The Tail People were more advanced in every way. They
■ " knew how to build grass-covered houses with wooden frames
and rounded roofs like a modern quonset hut sunk a meter or
more below the surface.
1 C Later, structures of wood or bamboo, with thatched roofs,
were raised above the ground...
USome of the houses were built on posts, to raise the floor above the ground which, besides being damp, was infested with crawling things.
The Tall People thought things out, and adapted their ways of life to conditions.
More implements of the Early Ages: (1) Stone adzes
** of the third migration period; (2) Stone fighting
axe of the third*migration period; (3) Ridged “Luzon”
adzes of the fourth migration period; and (4) stone bark-
cloth beater of the fourth migration period.

£> Other “retreat” houses were set up in the forked branches
w of tall trees, for protection from night attacks by human
enemies. During .daytime, these people use 4 houses built directly
on the ground. The structures were put together without nails.
They used lashings of rattan, or at most a little mortising. Where
storms threatened, houses were often anchored to trees or the
ground by lines of rattan. The houses of the wealthy and even of
the chiefs did not differ from those of the common men except
for being larger and better built.

v this group. The weapon was often used with poisoned
darts, the points being dipped in poison from the “ipo” o*r “upas”
tree.

CHAPTER 2
The influx ot migrating peo-
■ ■ pies continued on and on.
Then about 1500 6.C. down to 500
B. C. the fourth and fifth types of
people came over from Indo-China
direct to Luzon. The fourth type
were the last ahd most advanced
of the Stone Age peoples to reach
the Philippines—and some of them
went on froni here far out into the
eastern Pacific Islands. The fifth
type were the Bronze Age folk
wlio brought the first metal-work-
ing art to the Philippines. There
is the historical possibility that the
name Luzon, which refers'to (a
greater portion of the Philippine
Archipelago was derived froni
Chinese.
44 These people had not yet
““ learned the complicated art
of weaving, but had developed the
making of bark cloth to a high
degree. Their clothing was clever-
ly decorated with designs printed
from stone or wooden blocks.
Archaeologists have found these
bark-cloth beaters and printing
devices at the sites of their ancient
villages. The designs were primi-
tive and crude but they showed
artistry and beauty in their own
barbaric ways. Roots and saps of
fruits were used to color. This
fact speaks well of our early an-
cestors. While the other early
peoples in some parts of the world
probably stuck to wearing clothing
for protective reasons, only the
early Filipinos already boast of an
artistry in distinguishing colors.

Of As a continuation of the Indonesian “B” culture, the fifth stream
of people came between 800 and 500 B. C. This latter wave introduced
into Northern Luzon the Central Aslan methods of copper smelting, and
the use of bellows and forges, forerunners of the modern smith shops.
At this stage the irrigation system of planting rice was also tntro-
“* duced. The splendid irrigation system of the Bontok, Nabaloi and
adjacent groups, culminating in the works of the Ifugao, have never

Beginning In the Bronze Age
“ and culminating in the Iron
Age, personal adornment made
great strides. The nephrite beads
were replaced by carnelian, agate,
rock crystal, and the green and
blue glass made by skilled artisans.
OA Potter’s products in this period were utilitarian, but their art com-
~ " manded wide respect. Some jars were carefully preserved as rice-
wine containers in great tribal religious rites, and were highly revered.
The tribes only parted with them for the most important reasons, such as
bloodfeud settlements or in marriage contracts, which were not uncommon.
35 In describing Tagalog, Pampango, Pangasinan and Ilocano jars, Morga
wrote in 1609 that “certain earthenware jars are found among the na-
tives. They are very old. of a brownish color.” (These three are “Manila-
ware jars of 16th and 17th century—all found in old houses in Bulacan
Province.)

Burial in jars was a solemn ritual introduced into the Philippines by the ‘‘jar-burial folk” descended front the Hakka tribds of Fukien province, who
carried their ancestors’ bones with them when they migrated to new homes. Archaeologists have found these “golden urns” in various parts of
the Philippines. And these “golden urns” have been the very key which has enabled us to piece together some loose, broken tidbits of historical facts,
OQ The jar-burial folk spread down into eastern Luzon in the early cen-
turies of the Christian Era, coming through the Batanes and Babu-
yan Islands. They moved southward from Fukien Province and spread out.
57 History has made another grain in the unearthing of the cross-sec-
tion of a Babuyan Islands burial mound. Archaeological findings
have not only determined the position of the burial jar, but also discovered
the frequent use of another inverted jar as a cover for those burial jars.
38 These burial jars, known as “kunukun,” were inclosed in earthen
mounds, over which stone cairns were built (as especially noted in
the Balanes and Babuyan Islands). The idea was to keep the ancestral
bones safe from desecration. No wonder the jars were kept intact.
TALE OF THE “GOLDEN URN.”—The “jar-burial” called “Golden Urn”
burial, was originated by the “Hakkas,” people who lived in the interior of
Fukien and other provinces in South China. Recause they could not bring
their ancestral graves with them in their migrations into new places,
they carried their ancestors' bones in jars instead. The practice was
handed down throughout the ages, so their own remains could ea’sily be
carried along whenever their descendants moved into new homelands.
Where the jar-burials are still prevalent among some people in the Phil-
ippines, it is probable that the custom has been adopted from contact with
the Hakka people when they first came here. An interesting fact is that
the jar-burial custom originated before the development of true porcelain
wares, and that the burial-jars as found in old grave sites were made only
of hard earthenware or of some soft stoneware.
The Philippine sites where such burial jars are found lie mostly in the
Batanes-Babuyan Islands (between Formosa and Luzon), Sorsogon, and
some provinces in Sulu and Mindanao. They are also found occasionally
in Borneo.
In the north, the Burial jars were usually covered with a cairn; but
as the migration proceeded southward, the custom changed, and the cairns
were first superseded by an earthen mound, and later by direct burial of
the jars themselves in the ground.
It is probable that this ancient jar-burial migration added an in-
teresting element to the population of the eastern and central Philippines
during the first third of the Christian Era. They were a plain and simple
people, of middle “Iron Age” culture. But their culture seems to have died
out prior to the Bth Century A. D., or perhaps they were merely blended
with the later peoples of protohistoric origin. —it


>|Q Between 900 and 1200 A. D., a new group
V of immigrants entered the historical are-
na of the Philippines. They came from what is
now southern Annam, and were known as Orang
Dampuans—or “Men of Champa.”
They succumbed, like so many later visitors,
to the wild, exotic charms of the Sulu region,
and there established their trading posts. A lush
trade grew up between the Sulu natives and the
Dampuan homeland. An ancient Sulu manus-
cript recounts that in the century before the
Spaniards came, some four to five hundred junks
arrived annually from Cambodia, Champa and
China.
The Orang Dampuans were the first civil-
ized foreigners to establish a settlement in Su-
lu, according to the most reliable of pre-Moham-
medan histories. They brought with them a
high culture.
The “Men of Champa” were not selfish.
They shared with the natives the many bless-
ings of a culture destined to leave marks of in-
fluence in that part of the archipelago. The
natives, at first wary, recognized the superiority
of the ways of living of the newcomers. They
soon realized that those ways of the foreigners
could be made of good use in their everyday lives.
A|l The Orang Dampuans had a higher culture
than their neighbors. Their homes were
better. They were shrewder in trade. This
aroused jealousy, just as it does now, and this
envy finally touched off the massacre of a num-
ber of Champa traders. The slaying spread.
Peace between the foreigners and the local res-
idents ended. It could have been averted but
the fires of jealousy flamed into a conflagration
that devoured thej pride of the natives. Their
weapons of war nyere crude and they were no
match for the adventurous Orang Dampuans,
but even then they fought it out to the end.


Ay The Orang Dampuans, backed by their
rulers at home, massed their superior
armaments for terrible retaliation against the
slayers. Sululand ran red with blood as the
vengeful Dampuans struck swiftly and hard.
The natives had to cope with the worst situa-
tion they had ever encountered in their lives.
The Sulu chief had no alternative but to
plunge his loyal braves headlong into the gory
battlefield. They had provoked the ire of the
foreigners. It had been a war precipitated by
the odd mixture of keen commercial rivalry
and of an inborn sense of protecting the na-
tive rights which Suluans cherished.
A 1 The Orang Dampuans knifed through
the Sulu towns and irresistibly,
killing the inhabitants who did not flee, and
destroying the blood-soaked towns. Many a
native was sacrificed by the consuming fires
of hatred and jealousy. But the stout-hearted
natives fell with dignity in their chosen stand
against the Orang Dampuans, who became
merciless In their rampage of vengeance. The
Orang Dampuans sailed away from the smok-
ing ruins of the village which they burned,
after they had completed their revenge. Their
actions were proof that they did not seek po-
litical domination, but only wanted to trade
peacefully. It was not until the time of the
Shri-Vishayan incursion that political dom-
ination came about, and the Orang Dampuans
came back again in their ships, to trade in
peaceful ports, when the Shri-Vishaya rulers
had reestablished a reign of peace and order.

CHAPTER 4
The pages of Philippine history teem with high romance borne on the mighty river of a great culture at full tide in the period from TOO to 1000
■ ■ A.D., which was the high-water mark of Sri-Vishayan Influence in the islands. In Farther India, the Sri-Vishayan expansionist movement began
to burgeon as cultural and political aptitudes developed. Eventually the outer'rings of this expansion were to enclose a great portion of the Philippines,
and leave a vast and important mark on our cultural and racial inheritance. It was , wandering colonists of the Sri-Vishayan tide who implanted the
distinctive regional name Visayas on a great geographical section of the Philippines, and everywhere else their influence survives. _
Before the end of the Eighth Century, the power and dominance of the Sri-Vishayan empire were firmly fixed. It extended over all of the Ma-
lay peninsula, included large portions of Sumatra and part of Siam and extended eastward as far as central Java. The exact number of sub-states
is unknown, but four rose to positions of great importance: Bandjarmasin. Sukadana, the southern Sarawak region and Brunei. Bandjarmasin and
Brunei sent offshoots into the Philippines that readily commingled with our enterprising forefathers and lent new color to our vivid national scene.


AM Pearls from the fabled Sulu beds were the magnet that drew the
stalwart colonizers from Bandjarmasin, pearls destined for the
crowns of Sri-Vishayan potentates. The Bandjarmasin immigrants settled
in Sulu. From Brunei, other treasure hunters and traders swarmed into
the west-central Philippines. Chinese and Champa traders had carried
the word of Philippine treasure to the far reaches of the empire.
A 9! The Men of Band jar (Oran? Band jar) began regular trade with Sulu,
" resulting in the founding of a colony. The natives, called Buranon,
eyed the colonizers with scarcely veiled hostility. The interest of the
exploiters and exploited clashed, and affairs approached a crisis, precisely
as when the Orang Dampuan moved into the area, and for the same rea-
son of conflicting interests. But the Orang Bandjar were better strategists.
48 Orang Bandjar were wiser than the men of Dampuan, and they knew the transcendental power of a beautiful woman. They brought a
“pearl’' of their own, a Bandjarmasin princess of blinding beauty, and offered her in marriage to the principal Buranon chief. Under the thrall of
the princess, the Buranon ruler signed a marriage contract making Sulu a tributary of Bandjarmasin, or probably a tributary of the Sri-Vishayan em-
pire through Bandjarmasin. Thus the colonists secured, through a state marriage, a permanent foothold for peaceful trade and expansion in Sulu.


AQ As trade burgeoned, more and more fortune-hunters swarmed into the “boom” towns of the Sulu coast. It was a racial melting pot, with adven-
' turers from Borneo, Celebes, Mindanao—and possibly Sumatra, Java, the Moluccas and Indo-China disputing the gains. The natives were crowded
but by the more advanced strangers^and sought refuge in the hflls of the interior. The foreigners controlled the coasts, the whole length of them.
CA Sulu became the trading cross-roads of the Southern Seas, a port of romance and wealth. Great ships from China, Cambodia. Sumatra and Java
anchored in the Sulu roadstead, and there were occasional trading vessels from faraway India and Arabia in Sulu’s harbor. Sulu became a word
of the world, synonymous with great riches and beautiful luminous pearls. The call of fabulous treasure in Sulu beckoned many adventurers.


tl From the union of the Bandjarmasin princess and her Buranon
** * chieftain came the line of Sulu rulers, the rajahs who owed tribute to
the blood of their mothers, and remained under the cultural influence of
Bandjarmasin for many generations. Such' was the product of strategy!
From Borneo other adventurers set out, among them Datu Puti who
sailed with ten small vessels to Palawan, thence to Panay, where
he settled not far from present-day Iloilo. The records show that the
pilot was acquainted with the route, which is evidence of previous Bornean
penetration of the Visayas.
r n The settlers rrom Borneo were just as energetic and peopled a vast area in the Philippines. From positive records we know that they had colonies
in Panay, Palawan, Mindoro and Southern Luzon. Their colonial empire may have been of much greater extent. There are ancient manuscript
record* from Panay still existing which give an account of the settlement of that Island by Brunei immigrants* several centuries before Magellan.


thought the times
and signs opportune for ne-
gotiating a treaty of settlement.
Would the “Ati” overlord be pleas-
ed to bargain for rights to esta-
blish a Bornean colony? For ans-
wer, Marikudo blew his horn to
assemble his tribal followers, and
advise them of the proposal. A
great feast was held, there was
dancing and music, and the nego-
tiations were concluded in great
good friendship. Datu Puti was
given his choice of a site on the
beach or in the mountains. He
chose the seashore, like the sea
rover he was. In payment, Marl-
kudo requested a hat of gold,
which he got. The “Ati” tribes-
men retired in peace to a new set-
tlement in the hills. Datu Puti
burned their old beach village for
sanitary reasons, and his group
established a new town on the
site. Thus a new Bornean colony
was firmly established peacefully.

CHAPTER 5
CA When Datu Puti landed in
Panay, he found the place
peopled by a set of short and
swarthy natives who were called
“Atis.” The Borneans entered the
village, which was not far from
the present city of Iloilo, and they
were met by the petty king or
“pangulo,” Marikudo. The na-
tives’ gestures of hospitality were
warm and sincere; the foreigners
were pleased. All around them,
they saw houses standing, domes-
tic animals quietly roaming by,
and the crude but nevertheless ef-
fective dry farming practiced by
Marikudo’s men. Datu Puti knew
then and there that it was the
right place for him and his men.

They appear to have penetrated as
far as Lake Taal in southern Lu-

neo by way of the Mindoro and
Palawan Islands. The activities of
the settlers in Datu Puti's group
were not solely confined to the
Luzon area, which resulted in
scattered influences in the south-
ern isles, notably in the V Isay as.


ri The ancient manuscript found in Panay makes no further mention
of Datu Puti. His job was done. A great colonizer and explorer, the
Philippines owes this man of remote times a great debt for the heritage he
brought. The remainder of the manuscript is a detailed history of the
colony after Datu Puti had left.
CO Regarding the Taal settlers, the manuscript merely states that some
of their descendants later removed to the land of Bikol and five
other places—two of which have now been identified as being on the south
and east shores of Laguna de Bay. Doubtless some of their offspring still
live in these regions.
CQ The manuscript throws some
** " light also on the worshipping
rites of the “Atis” whom the
Borneans found in Panay. The
fundamental idea behind the re-
ligious practices then was the wor-
ship of a class of supernatural be-
ings called “anitos.” While the
concept of the “anito” varied from
tribe to tribe, everything could be
traceable to a sort of ancestor
worship then prevailing. Some be-
lieved the “anitos” were gods and
spirits; others, that the “anitos”
were the souls of their dead an-
cestors keeping vigil over them.
in Another feature of the Pa-
nay manuscript, now called
the “Maragtas,” is the ancient
writing in which it was originally
inscribed. The Bornean Visayans
used a form of syllabic writing,
which they introduced wherever
they spread. In this syllabary, the
vowels were written only when
they stood alone or at the begin-
ning of words. Each consonant
sign stood for the consonant fol-
lowed by the sound “a”. The char-
acters were incised on bamboos or
written on bark with cuttlefish ink.
It also appears that they had some
rudiments of astronomy and other
branches of knowledge; but their
ideas are much mixed with my-
thology and a lore that had its be-
ginnings in distant India.


11 Our early ancestors had their
" ■ own well-developed weights
and measures. The manuscript
bears this out, too. As regards
the mathematical abilities of the
people, we are unfortunately lit-
tle informed. They, however, ad-
ded and subtracted numbers con-
siderably larger than those which
most uncivilized people were ac-
customed to deal with and while
it 1* doubtful whether they pos-
sessed any system of multiplica-
tion as such, they followed it in
effect in their schemes of values.
Meantime in Java ambition
and intrigue were shaping a
fresh new power destined to grow
up and swallow the great Sri-
Vishaya itself. In 1275 Kartana-
gara, fifth and last of the Javanese
kings of Singosari, gathered the
pick of his troops and sent them
on a great expedition which pene-
trated as far as Menangkabau,
and then beyond the reach of com-
munications. For twenty years
this army was not heard from.
jL Then the wily Djayakatwang.
the tributary king of Kedlrl
in east-central Java, took ad-
vantage of the absence of Karta-
nagara’s best troops, treacherous-
ly rebelled against his overlord,
and in 1292 seized the throne of
Singosari. The small home army
defending the throne of Singosari
fell easy prey to the sudden, un-
expected onslaughts of the trai-
tors. King Kartanagara tried his
best to gather his troops and make
a counter-attack. But they were
greatly outnumbered. The few
home defenders, loyal to the very
last to their king, perished as the
invaders carried a relentless cam-
paign of vandalism and looting.
Kartanagara was immediately
killed, together with some of his
ministers and personal followers.
But the former prime minister.
Wiraradja, had escaped to the is-
land of Madura.


LA Now, the commander of the small home army which Djayakatwang
™ bested was Baden Widjaya, Kartanagara’s son-in-law. When the
royal city capitulated, Baden was in the outskirts. Consequently, he had
time to escape to the island of Madura, where the wily prime-minister
Wiraradja and a number of loyal troops awaited him. Later, they moved
to Madjapahit, in the wild unsettled country southeast of SingosarL
AC After organizing a sizable army at Madjapahit, they held a council
of war. Wiraradja advised an appeal to Kublai Khan’s Chinese gene-
rals who had already landed a big army on the north coast at Surabaya.
Baden Widjaya did so, and ingeniously offered them the pick of the Sin-
gosari princesses as a reward.
II Unknown to Baden Widjaya, the mission of Kublai Khan's expedition was to subdue Kartanagara, who in life had refused to pay tribute to the
Emperor of China. When the Chinese expedition landed in Java and found that Kartanagara was dead, they pursued the wisq course of joining
forces with Baden Widjaya to oust the usurper Djayakatwang. Thus they could at least follow literally their instructions to punish the king of SingosarL


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 6
In order not to arouse the
® * suspicion of the Chinese gen-
erals Raden 'V id jay a asked that
escorts accompany him to obtain
the presents. However, when he
found himself master of the land
and surrounded by a good-sized
army, Raden Widjaya decided to
drive the Chinese out of Java. He
began by killing the escorts. Then
he attacked the Chinese generals
who had remained with a small
force in Daha, the capital of Ke-
diri. The siege was successful.
17 Imperialistic opportunism
made common cause with
dynastic vengeance against the
usurper, whose army was annihi-
lated by the combined forces of
the Chinese generals and Raden
Widjaya. Djayakatwang was killed
at Singosari together with his son
and his possessions were seized.
Most of the prisoners and booty
were taken by the Chinese.
IO 'When the last echo of bat-
tie faded away in the middle
of May, 1292, the Chinese gen-
erals allowed Raden Widjaya to
return to Madjapahit. Raden,
who had by this time become sus-
picious and wary of the motives
behind the help rendered him by
the Chinese, alleged that his pur-
pose in going to Madjapahit was
to prepare the princesses and other
presents promised by him to the
Chinese Emperor, Kublai Khan.


JA The Chinese army was taken
by surprise, as they had not
expected Raden Widyaya to attack
them. Their rear guard was wiped
out. Intense fighting took place
near the cpast, where the Chinese
had retained a foothold. There
they reunited the whole expedi-
tion and embarked on their ships.
The commanders decided to return
to China without attempting any
reprisals, as the main purpose of
their expedition had been already
achieved.
■y| The victorious Kauen Widja-
' ■ ya never attempted to re-
build Singosari, which had become
a symbol of ignominy and defeat.
Instead he had himself crowned
king of Madjapahit, the fateful
place where he had found refuge
and regained strength for his vic-
torious campaigns. Upon ascension
to the throne of Madjapahit he as-
sumed the name of Kartaradjasa
Djaya-warddhana.
\
7J When Raden W id jay a became king in
1293, he immediately set about consoli-
dating his vast kingdom and budding the
great city of Madjapahit. The power of Mad-
japahit was widely and rapidly extended
throughout all the islands lying between Java
and the Philippines, as can be ascertained in
the accompanying map. The list of tributary
states in 1365 included eighteen in Borneo,
six each in the Moluccas and Celebes, one in
the Talaud Islands to the south of Mindanao,
and three within our own archipelago.


*IA To insure financial stability for all Madjapahit possessions taxes
* were imposed and collected from the inland population. This impor-
tant function was placed under the supervision of a mantrl, or minister
for the interior. The tax-collectors assigned were often priests or monks.
70 The Madjapahit ruler took a
" • keen interest in his posses-'
sions overseas, devising ways and
means of wielding his power by
remote control. All Madjapahit
colonies were ruled by governors
who usually lived at favorable
spots on the coast and were com-
missioned with the title “sea-lord.”
Madjapahit sea-lords had both
troops and ships under their com-
mand, for the purpose of resisting
foreign invasions and of putting
down local insurrections which
flared up now and then. However,
their most Important function
was supervision -of the export
trade, and all other duties were
subordinated to this.
1C The ruler of Madjapahit knew that priests wore the most qualified
" • for tax-collection duties because of their tact in dealing with people.
But they were forbidden to Interfere with the native religious betftels.
Only the Sivaite monks were permitted to preach Brahma nistir doctrines.


■ii Sulu, the region of Lake Lanao in Mindanao, and the vicinity of
Manila Bay In Luzon, were the three localities in the Philippines
which are definitely known to have been controlled by Madjapahit.
■JQ In 1917, a strong flood tearing away the banks of the Wawa River,
near Esperanza in Agusan Province, exposed a heavy gold image of
a type definitely belonging to the Madjapahit period. It seems to be of
local workmanship, and it may have been made by an artist accompanying
the Javanese miners who are known to have developed certain gold de-
posits in that region.
OA Among: the many-faceted cultures
that lent color to the Philippine
national scene, the Indian influence was
among those that manifested itself with
a virility that came down throughout the
ages. The Indian culture made itself
felt strongly in the political, social, reli-
gious and aesthetic life of the popula-
tion among whom it spread. Economic
influences seem to have been relative-
ly less important, though modes of dress
and personal ornamentation were also
greatly affected. The influence on Fili-
pino dress can still be perceived.
When tearing down some ancient walls near Cordoba town, on Mactan
" " Island, Cebu, a small bronze image of the Hindu God Siva was un-
covered in 1843. It is believed to date from the Madjapahit period.
"MQ Also in the same Mactan site where the Siva image was found, a
" " copper figure of the Hindu God Ganesha was unearthed—-but it was
destroyed when the Ateneo museum burned. The above stone image of
Ganesha was excavated on the site of Madjapahit itself. Ganesha, the
“elephant god” was the patron saint of Gadja Mada the great prime
minister who extended the power of Madjapahit over all Malaysia.


pi Early Chinese Relations with Malay Lands.—About the third or fourth century, A. D., another important movement in the East began: this was
® ■ the southward flow of the cultured Chinese into Malay lands. TJie earliest route followed the coast of Southeast Asia to Sumatra and Java. Later
routes, beginning about the ninth century, came southward through the Philippines and on to Java through the Makassar Strait between Borneo and
Celebes. Return trips to China usually followed the eastern border of the China Sea.
The types of ships used by the Chinese were the largest and finest
in use on the Indian and China seas in pre-European times. They
were the heavy square stable junks still seen today.
The credit for bringing Brunei and the Philippines to the official
notice of China was due to one Abu AH and two others who went to
the Chinese court as envoys from the king of Brunei, in A. D. 977.


QA The first actual mention of the Philippines was made In the tenth
” * century—when certain traders from “Ma-i,” the present Mindoro,
brought valuable merchandise to Canton for sale, in the year 982. The cap-
tain of tne ship was also named Abu Ali.
OC A description of “Ma-i” is. given in the account of Chau Ju-Kua,
.written about 1225: “When trading ships enter the anchorage, they
stop in front of the place of the mandarin (official’s place). After a ship
has been boarded, the natives mix freely with the ship’s folk.
pi The custom was for the native traders to assemble in crowds and carry the goods away; and even if one could not distinguish them one from the
other, they always came back to repay the traders. As a rule it took them as long as eight or nine months before they returned—and for this
reason the ships trading to “Ma-i” were usually the last to return to China.


07 From a book of 1349 we read the following interesting particulars:
“In their customs they are good and chaste. When a husband dies,
his wife shaves her head and fasts for seven days. There are some who,
to make manifest their wifely devotion, on the day when the body of
their dead husband is burned, throw *h*ms*lves into the fire.”
This refers to the custom of “suttee”, introduced into Mindoro from Mad-
japahit in the 14th century.
Op Chinese merchant ships also made frequent trips to “San-hsu” (the
QO “Three Islands”), which seem to have been the Central Yisayas; and
also to “P’u-li-lu” and “Tung Liu-sin”, which places are now known to be
Polillo Island and Eastern Luzon. In refering to Polillo-, the Chinese author
says: “To the south lies the land of Gold”; and this must refer to the Para-
cale District, where the Chinese trades goods for raw gold as early as the
12th or 13th century.
pQ The first extensive account of Luzon appears in Chapter 323 of the “Ming Annals,” where it is referred to as Liu-sung. Embassies from this
country arrived in China in 1372 and again in 1408. Among other presents they are said to have brought gifts of horses “small but very strong*’.
The Emperor reciprocated the gifts with presents of silks, strings of copper cash, and many other things. Chinese merchants also brought presents to
the “King of Luzon”.


QA A Chinese writer in 1349 wrote: “Sulu pearls are .whiter and rounder
• ” than those of India. Their price is very high. The Chinese used them
for head ornaments.**
Ol The general character of Chinese influence was and is economic.
The Jacket with sleeves, the loose trousers worn by Moro women,
glass beads, and many types of hats, raincoats, footgear, etc., are also
certainly Chinese.
OO At least ten ancient syllabaries were in use in different parts of the Philippines in pre-Spanish times—of which copies of only seven still survive.
The Bikol syllabary seems to be completely lost; while those of Sulu and Magindanao were replaced by the Arabic alphabet before the Spanish
arrival. The above table shows the known Philippine syllabaries in comparison with related forms from Malaysia and India—and also with Arabic and
Hebrew to which they are not directly related.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 8
FILIPINO ART AND CULTURE IN PRE-SPANISH TIMES
While the full history of Philippine art and culture before the
time of Magellan cannot yet be written, the archaeological findings of the
past 25 years have brought out many examples of ancient artistic pro-
ductions that are worthy of being placed on permanent record. And from
them we may to some degree reconstruct the course of artistic advance-
ment through the various culture stages of the Philippines’ past.
Most Early Stone Age men were too busy getting a living to think of
anything not strictly utilitarian, and spent little time, in shaping the crude
stone artifacts that were their principal weapons and tools. However, the
artistic nature existed even then, and some few individuals, observing
the beautiful natural lines in leaves and flower-petals, began to try shap-
ing their tools and weapons in similar forms.
With the advent of the early New Stone Age artistic appreciation was
greatly increased and a much larger percentage of the population demanded
not only good lines in the shaping of their weapons and tools but also a
polished surface. It is obvious that this desire was not all utilitarian, since
a polished stone axe or chisel is harder to hold firmly than the rough
surfaced ones of earlier times. People demanded the polished implement
not because it was more useful but because of a newborn sense of the
artistic in Nature, and a desire to improve it still further if possible.
As the New Stone Age advanced we note a rapid increase in the
number and kinds of artistic objects and soon jewelry and body orna-
ments began to appear. In the late New Stone Age not only were beads,
amulets, earrings, bracelets and suchlike ornaments made of beautiful
green jade, red carnelian, and other attractive stones, but also the bark-
cloth then worn began to be dyed and ornamented with printed designs
in simple but attractive colors. Many of the designs probably had magic
or religious significance and served a double duty, utilitarian and artistic.
The Copper-Bronze Age saw still further increase in expression of the
artistic sense. Not only are the Bronze-Age axes, §pearheads, and orna-
ments well formed, but the presence of bronze drums, gongs and bells
indicates a considerable development of the social arts of music and
dancing.
But it was with the coming of the Malays in the Early Iron Age that
artistic diversity reached its zenith in pre-Spanish times. A multitude of
new forms of ornaments appeared all at once. The body was covered with
complicated tattoo designs, and decorated with strings of beads, bracelets.
rings, headbands, neck ornaments, etc., including new materials such as
metal and glass. With the coming of the hand loom, woven textiles began
to multiply and clothing became both more diversified and of intricate
and colorful designs. Artistic productions in iron and steel replaced the
simpler weapons and tools of older times; daggers, spears, slender long-
bladed swords, fighting bolos, and knives became essential equipment for
all warriors—as well as decorated shields and other defensive armor.
Pottery came into use and was soon covered with incised designs
varying from the simple to the elaborate. Images carved from potsherds,
or from wood, horn, bone, or ivory, came to be used not only in life but
were also buried with the dead. Some early Iron Age graves in Luzon have
been found to contain a man’s complete array of personal possessions—
clothing, weapons, ornaments, tools, and utensils, as well as a pot orig-
inally filled with food and a vessel of water or wine.
In the protohistoric period, still finer vessels of stoneware and porcelain
(imported from China. Cambodia, or Siam) replaced the native wares in
graves—and imported beads and jewelry from far-off Greece, Rome, Asia
Minor, and India appear side by side with native ornaments.
Of course the finer textiles, wood-carvings, and suchlike destructible
possessions have long since disappeared from our burial sites—but some
of their designs have been preserved through impressions in pottery and
in the rust-cakes on iron weapons and tools. In a few rare instances,
embroidered fabrics have been completely fossilized in the rust-cake of an
iron dagger or bolo blade around which they were wrapped.
Gradually, as clothing increased, tattooing gave way to embroidered
jackets and other garments—and many of their styles and designs we can
still see among the advanced pagan peoples of eastern Mindanao and
northern Luzon, where Mohammedan and Christian influences have only
penetrated recently or in some areas not at all. We should be glad of
the fact that the strong “culture resistance” of some of these isolated
peoples of our hills and mountains has preserved so much of their ancient
culture and arts down to the present day—when, if we will, we can still
recover and revive much of the best that is purely Philippine.
The changes that occurred with the introduction of Spanish and
Christian culture in the north, and Mohammedan arts in the south, will
be considered in a later chapter to be entitled “Filipino Art and Culture
during the Spanish Period”.—

Philippine Saga: Such is the title of this il-
lustrated historical series. While I do not claim
any credit for its choice, I believe I can take the
liberty of qualifying it. For it is modest, yet it
could be over-ambitious were we to attempt to
give full scope to the original concept from
which it was derived. As far as lam concerned,
however, the most acceptable criterion should be
to limit ourselves strictly to the documented
historical truths, without passion or exaggera-
tion, and with the optimism inherent in human
nature, permitting the imagination and patriotic
enthusiasm to wrap the rest in the penumbra
of the primitive “sagas,” on the basis of what is
known in analogous periods of history, here and
abroad.
Moreover we wish to state at the outset that
the work under discussion has not been written
as the majority of histories of the Philippines,
from the European or “foreign” point of view,
as has been the case with most of our past
religious historians. Even Montero y Vidal, the
most conspicuous lay authority whose works are
frequently quoted in discussions of an historical
nature, is no exception to this rule.
We profess as just and right, that the “Filipi-
no” element be the subject of our history. On this
point our ideal is Rizal as exemplified in his
annotations to Morga, and in similar studies by
Patemo and Isabelo de los Reyes. We are at-
tempting now as in the past, when we wrote
Efemerides filipinas in collaboration with M.
Ponce, to expound the same Filipino filipinism
of the forerunners and participants of our glo-
rious Revolution, among them the unforgettab.3
figures of Zulueta and Calderon. Hence our pur-
pose is to write a history of the “Filipino” rather
than the “Philippines”.
* * ♦
Our task in this series is, properly speaking,
not detailed exposition, but, rather graphic sug-
gestion, inasmuch as we are not offering a tex-
tual account of events but are limiting ourselves
to an outline of their course, taking only those
highlights of history which lend themselves to
illustration by the artist. It is the latter who
has in his hands the execution of the work; our
own role is merely to suggest, to indicate the
idea, to point out the background, leaving to
the painter the interpretation, and to the reader
or spectator the admiration and appreciation of
events.
* * *
This procedure is distinct from that of our col-
league, Prof. Beyer, whose work has been more
intensive —investigating, unearthing fossils, mak-
ing excavations, endeavoring to reconstruct al-
most always. Our o\frn task is rather that of
mere selection, evaluation, collation, etc., which
can be plain and easy, or difficult, depending
on how one carries it out. As Prof. Beyer has
already noted, the post-Magellanic period, our
history from the arrival of the Spaniards up
to the present, is “amply documented by printed
records and manuscript literature, additionally
supported by pictures of actual events.”
We want to repeat that we consider it essential
in this work to emphasize significance rather
than detail; thus, in tracing the development
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 9
THE PERIOD OF MAGELLAN
PROF. JAIME C. DE VEYRA
of our people, we offer that “trait” or “traits”
which best characterize them rather than a full-
scale portrait. Hence our devotion to Kalaw’s
Cinco Regrlas de Nuestra Moral Antigua, which
the sociologist has identified as Bravery, Hon-
esty, Courtesy, Self-Control, and Family Unity.
From this pentagon of ideals a clearer concept
of Filipino personality may be derived than from
any actual Filipino one may encounter, however
perfect and outstanding he may be in real life.
Furthermore there are characteristics that are
worth encouraging: for example, the love of
home. Typically, while the Boholano thinks al-
ways of returning to his home-town after a
trading trip, the -lokano is, in contrast, urged on
by the spirit of adventure, having merited from
the historian Dr. Barrows the appellative “no-
mad” (in the good sense).
There is much that is gradually being lost in
those traditions and folkloric tales. Lexicogra-
phy will undoubtedly help to disinter the mean-
ing of words which are getting out of use or
which have lost their original worth in the spok-
en language, finally ending up as native pa-
tronymics or as place-names. Thus it may be
easier to trace those currents of migration which
came to establish different ethnic groups accord-
ing to languages and regions.
Without attempting to delve deep into this,
certain problems could be pointed out, for ex-
ample: (a) Between the Tagalog and Pampango
dialects, there are such great differences that
4n the neighboring towns of Calumpit (Bui., tag.)
and Apalit (Pamp.) which are separated only by
a river, the inhabitants speak entirely distinct
dialects.
(b) The little island of Kapul, almost attached
to the northwestern part of Samar, speaks a lan-
guage which is not the Bisaya common to Samar
and Leyte.
(c) The letter r is not inherent in the Philip-
pine languages, and does not even appear in our
ancient alphabet; it is recorded only as a pho-
netic variant of dor 1. How is it that the letter
is so common in the Bisaya leite-samareho and
in Ilokano, so distant from one another, in point
of geographic location?
(d) The same occurs with the peculiar pro-
nunciation of tjie e (the peppet e, of the lin-
guists), in the Bisaya of Aklan and in Pangasi-
nan (almost liquid 1 or palatal-guttural e.) , The
region of Aklan (Panay) is also far from Panga-
sinan (Luzon), while in the intervening islands
the pronunciation of the peppet e is unknown.
How is this possible?
(e) The modulation of the letter f is still more
remarkable; it is not found in any of our com-
mon languages but may be noted in the Tiruray
(south of Mindanao) and the Ibanag (extreme
north of Luzon). Why this similarity in pronun-
ciation, so unlike the rest?
These are phenomena that should give sub-
ject—and labour —to historical-linguistic re-
searches and ethnic-psychic inquiries. Perhaps
they hold the key to the inter-relation and di-
rection of the extensive migrations undertaken
by the ethnic-adventurous or merely ambitious
groups of the Madjapahit and Sri-Vishaya, de-
scribed in previous portions of this series.
COAT-OF-ARMS AND SIGNATURE OF
MAGELLAN
(From an old print)
And so we enter the “period of the
main subject of our task. In today’s series of
scenes, the artist has taken for his starting
point the personality of the Portuguese navigator
and explorer. Why did Magellan go over to the
Spaniards? What was his project? What were
his dreams?
We are in what historians usually term “the
period of discoveries”. The imagination of
Europe has been inflamed with projects of ex-
ploration and adventure by the tales of Marco
Polo on the novelties and splendors of the Orient.
The Portuguese soon outbid the Venetians, with
their discoveries of the Cape of Good Hope, the
southern part of Africa, the coasts of Asia, and
above all the Spice Islands: there Magellan ex-
plores and fights in the service of his king, the
monarch of Portugal. At the end of eight or
ten years, he returns to his native land, with
his head full of projects; he is, however, be-
sieged by enemies, rivals or mere imitators. Dis-
appointments embitter his heart; the fickleness,
perhaps the envy, of the courtiers decide him to
leave his native land and go to the neighboring,
almost sister, nation, Spain, where a man fated
to be the most powerful in the world has ascend-
ed the throne as Charles V. To this monarch
Magellan submits his proposals, forming a part-
nership with his countryman Ruy Falero. whom
he considers one of the most able technicians.
What are his plans? . To go to the Spice Is-
lands, by a way different from that taken by the
Portuguese—almost by the opposite route—and
discover lands, more extensive and more rich
than any yet known. Charles V does not need to
know more. Eager for more power, and despite
serious opposition, he signs agreements with Ma-
gellan and Falero, binding himself to furnish five
ships, 265 men and provisions for two years. The
preparations last eighteen months, but at last
the small fleet is ready to weigh anchor on
September 20, 1519.


1 0A The voyage of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese sailor driven from
his native country by the injustices of the court whose power he
had helped establish in India, was started in an era of great geographical
discoveries. Being l , a Portuguese, Magellan’!* entry into the servijce of
Spain was opposed vigorously by Spanish courtiers. But the Spanish mon-
arch Charles V, most powerful in the Western World, kept his own counsel.
m Magellan’s fleet of five ships namely, the Trinidad, the Victoria,
the San Antonio, the Concepcion and the Santiago sailed from San-
lucar de Barrameda, a seaport of Seville. They carried provisions good for
two years. The whole expedition was composed of 265 men. Magellan was
very confident. His men were in high spirits. They set sail to the tune of
“La Partida.”
From an old painting by E. Brlerly
1 *%A The chief conspirator was stabbed by Espinosa. The rest of the
■ plotters were captured and chained in the mutinnous vessel, San-
tiago. Magellan impressed the men with his firmness and determination
to find the passage to the East Indies and his faith was rewarded even
when on November 1, IS2O, he entered the long and tortuous strait that
now bear% his name.
I<ll Charles wanted to put an end to the activities of the Portuguese in
■ " ■ the Moluccas which he believed to be within the jurisdiction of Spain
as determined by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. He commissioned Ma-
gellan to head the Spanish search for a new passage to the Indies beyond
Portuguese control because of the latter’s experience in the Moluccas as
a member of the Portuguese force under Antonio de Abreu in 1511. Another
Portuguese seaman, Magellan’s friend and partner. Buy Falero, was named
chief mate.
1 On the 29th of November, 1519, Magellan’s five ships reached the
coast of Brazil. Searching for the new passage to the Indies they
explored every likely break in the American land-mass, sailing southward
steadily. In February 1520 they thought they had found it in the huge
mouth of the Rio de la Plata. Winter caught up with them in San Julian
Bay. Lack of food in cold weather caused mutiny. Magellan and his con-
stable Espinosa, acted swiftly to quell the conspirators.
| For twenty-eight days the ships struggled with current and shifting
* winds. South of them were great black islands, cold and desolate.
The Islands were Inhabited by Indians, who lived on fish and mussels.
As those Indians go naked at aO times, they carry with them in their
beats coal of fire. So Magellan named their Islands “Tlerra del Fuego.”


lAI When they finally emerged from the Strait of Magellan into jthe
vast Pacific, they found not the fabulous Indies but two small
islands which were uninhabited and without water or food. With bitter-
ness in his heart, Magellan named them the Unfortunate Islands. The
relief of the voyagers must have been inexpressible when they reached the
Ladrones on March 7, 1521, where they found yams, coconuts and rice.
Annoying thefts led the sailors to name the islands Los Ladrones.
Eight days later, on March 25, Magellan sailed to Limasawa, a
■ small island south of Leyte. Natives were found cultivating rice and
bread fruit. They had coconuts, oranges, bananas, as well as citron and
ginger. The Spaniards traded with them. In exchange for the native foods,
the Spaniards gave out red caps, glass beads, mirrors, combs and bells.
VAN It was also in the Ladrones that the Spaniards first saw the “prau,”
with its light outrigger and pointed sails. After satisfying their
needs, Magellan sailed on westward still looking for the Moluccas. They
sighted the eastern coast of Samar on March 16, 1521. On the following
day, March 17 (Sunday of St. Lazarus), the sea-worn expedition landed
in Homonhon or Humanu, south of Zanaal (Samar). Magellan named Ho-
monhon and the rest of the islands Archipelago of Saint Lazarus. Two
tents were set up for the sick men and a sow was killed for feasting.
14A Two Filipino chiefs from Mindanao, Rajah Koiambu and Rajah
■*' Siagu, were encountered in Limasawa t Masawa or Masaba by Ma-
gellan. They were very friendly. They feasted and exchanged gifts with
the Spaniards. Magellan celebrated the first Mass on Limasawa, where he
erected a cross and took possession of the land for the king of Spain on
March 31, 1521.
IVA One of the friendly chiefs accompanied Magellan to Cebu, a well-
fortified town ruled by Rajah Hama bon who tried to make Magel-
lan pay tribute. Magellan refused. Through the mediation of the chief-
guide, Humabon became friendly with the newcomers and exchanged pre-
sents with them. Magellan ordered mass celebrated. Humabon and Ids
queen, with seme eight hundred followers, embraced the new faith which
pleased them.
A small Island called Mactan and its rebellious chieftain became
1 the nemesis of Magellan who would have everyone recognise the
king of Spain as supreme ruler. A friendly chief named Zula sent Magellan
two goats as gift—in return for which the native chief asked help from
the Spaniards to punish Lapulapu. the chief of another Tillage am the




PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 10
Lapu-lapu
Three boatloads of Spaniards and twenty boatloads of Cebuanos
I ** made up Magellan’s force. They sailed for Mactan late in the night.
At dawn me following morning the Spanish soldiers waded through the
surf of the historic islet, confident of victory. The dreaded Spanish, in-
fantry had never met its equal on any battlefield of Europe; how could
these primitive warriors on a nameless beach withstand them?
1W Up to the day Humabon, king of Cebu, bowed down to receive a Spanish name in
baptism, Magellan had conquered courtly intrigues, scepticism, royal parsimony,
mutiny, hunger, the terrible caprices of sea and wind, the despair of his crews, the doubts
in his own heart. But never before had he been challenged by the spirit of liberty. Now atf
last he faced it in Lapulapu, chieftain of Mactan. It is to the glory of our race that the
first to defy Magellan and his Spanish expedition was a Filipino. Magellan waj quick to
realize the significance of his refusal to pay homage to the king of Spain. He would make
an example of this arrogant princelet. The request of Zula for aid in punishing Lapu>
lapu was granted. Strapping on his corselet, Magellan pledged the power and prestige of
the western world to the reduction of this bold challenger of the Indies.
134 Hopinff to distract and demoralize the defenders of Mactan, Magel-
" lan committed a mistake others were to make many centuries after-
ward. He ordered some of his soldiers to steal around the flanks of Lapu-
lapu’s forces and bum the homes of the men of Mactan. Some twenty or
thirty houses were set ablaze; two Spaniards paid with their lives.


But the sight of their burning homes only fed the flame of battle in the breasts of Lapulapu and his men. Armed only with scimitar-like cutlasses,
bamboo spears, bows and arrows, and wooden shields, they held the steel-clad musketeers of Spain at bay on the shores of their historic islet.
15A Wounded in the right leg by a poisoned arrow, realizing too late the formidable quality of his foes, Magellan commanded his men to fall back to
their boats. A few loyal soldiers remained by his side. They could not save Magellan who, wounded again in the arm by a bamboo spear, was finally
cut down in the bloody surf.


* Thus Magellan died and his gallant foes were so impressed by his
" bravery that they would not give up the body of one who had fought
so well. Aboard his ships the Spaniards and the Christian king, Humabon,
mourned the fallen captain but could only bargain weakly ior his body.
Tj OQ The expedition had now lost so many men that u»e survivors, one
*** “ hundred and fifteen in all, were compelled to burn the “Concepcion"
for lack of hands to sail her. In the “Trinidad” and the “Victoria” they
then determined to continue their search for the fabulous Spice Islands
under the leadership of Duarte Barbosa and Juan Serrano. Something of
Magellan’s indomitable spirit still stirred within them.
1 A monument now marks the spot where Magellan fell. During the
Commonwealth a statue was also raised in belated homage to the
explorer’s conqueror Lapuiapu, first of the Filipino fighters for freedom.
Their duel to the death was the beginning of an age-long struggle for
independence.
*| JA The islands that are now the Philippines were, however, definitely
■ unsafe for adventurers and invaders from across the seas. Once more
the Spaniards staggered under a heavy blow. A Malay who had acted as
Magellan’s interpreter decided to avenge himself for the harsh treatment
he had received from Barbosa. He whispered a scheme into the ear of the
chiefs of Cebu and from a farewell banquet attended by twenty-four
Spaniards including the astrologer San Martin de Sivilla, only two re-
turned. Barbosa was killed while the other commander, Serrano, w'as cap-
tured. Demoralized and panic-stricken, the survivors elected Juan Sebastian
del Cano their leader and hastened away from these indomitable islands.

CHAPTER 11
On November 21, 1542 Ruy Lopez de Villalobos undertook the dis-
* covery, conquest and colonization of islands in the southern sea
toward the west. He was instructed to avoid the Moluccas. The Villalobos
expedition consisted of 200 men on six ships—the Santiago, San Jorge, San
Antonio, San Juan de Letran, and two smaller vessels. Piloted by the
Portuguese mariner, Juan de Gaetano, the voyagers first tried to land at
Sarangani, Mindanao, on February 2, 1543.
143 The war * Uke natives of Sarangani resisted them. However, Villa-
* lobos was badly in need of provisions. He took the village by as-
sault and combed the area for food. But even then starvation faced the
Spaniards. As a last recourse, Villalobos dispatched Captain de la Torre
to forage in Tandaya (Samar), the name of which was later changed
by Villalobos’ men to Felipina in honor of the heir to the Spanish throne,
Don Felipe.
1 Captain de la Torre had an adventure on this island, whose name was to become our country's, that is not without its own prophetic implications.
* • ■ The lovely and graceful daughter of Macandala, the local chieftain, only heiress of his wealth and great estate, fell in love with the white stranger.
At a feast in his honor, Macandala and his wife and the other chiefs and their ladies formally asked him to marry the lovelorn princess. There was
rejoicing when the Spaniard consented, or so the chronicler writes, but he has nothing to say about the shoddy epilogue when the stranger left his bride
behind to rejoin his comrades-in-arms. VlllaJobos himself was eventually driven to the Moluccas, w’here he died in the arms of St. Francis Xavier.


VJP Affe r Villalobos came Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. Fray Andres de
■ Urda»i,“ta, the greatest navigator of his time, was invited to join the.
new expedition as chief pilot and spiritual leader. But it was known that
he objected to the conquest of the Philippines because he believed these
islands fell on the Portuguese side of the Demarcation Line and so the
Royal Audiencia of Mexico thought it prudent to give Lpcazul and Ur
daneta sealed orders. The" expedition sailed from Navidad in Mexico on
November 21, 1564 and reached Qebu on February 13, 1565. where Legazpi
was later to establish his first settlefKsnt.
Pen and Ink by Fernando Amorsolo
% am Bui the Filipinos were as hostile
■ as ever in Cebu, Leyte, Mazagua,
and Camiguin. Legazpi decided to try
Mindanao but, on account of bad weath-
er, he got no farther than Bohol, where
he entered into a blood compact of
brotherhood with Sikatuna, a local chief.
However, Legazpi and his officers, over-
riding Urdaneta’s protests, voted in.
council to establish themselves in Cebu.
They took the town by force on April
27, 1565, and on its ashes raised a trian-
gular stronghold, named first for San
Miguel, patron saint of the Spanish
leader, and then with the Holy Name
of Jesus because a Spanish soldier had
found an image of the child Jesus in the
debris of battle. Later. policy
of attraction encouraged collaboration.
Those who had fled to the hills returned.
The authority of the King of Spain was
acknowledged, tribute was paid, and Le-
gazpi was able to sign a treaty of virtual
alliance with Tupaz, King of Cebu.


WBut the cruelty and greed of the common soldiers belied the fine promises of their leader. Drunken soldiers desecrated the graves of Cebu, looting
the jewels and ornaments of the dead. The fierce resentment of the inhabitants, coupled with a sharp Portuguese attack on the new Spanish set-
tlement, induced Legazpi 10 move to Panay where he could be surer of a safe avenue of escape into the interior in case of another Portuguese raid.
%AQ The tension was relieved
* with the arrival of Captain
de la Isla with three ships and
reenforcements from Mexico in
June, 1569. De la Isla also brought
a letter from the King naming Le-
gazpi his “adelantado” and com-
manding him to take possession of
the Philippines. Legazpi returned
to Cebu soon afterward, organized
a city government, appointed Gui-
do de Lavezares governor, and
granted large feudal estates called
“encomiendas” to his officers and
men. The Spaniards quickly ex-
ploited their foothold in the Vlsa-
yas and established other settle-
ments. Then Legazpi heard of a
prosperous stronghold inside the
great bay of Luzon. He ordered
Martin de Goiti, his field marshall,
to mount an expedition against it
together with his dashing grand-
son Juan de Salcedo. While Goiti
was fighting Chinese traders on
Mindoro, Salcedo explored Satan-
gas, sailing along the Pansipit river
where he was attacked by Datu
Kumintang of Balayan. The "ade-
lantadoV’ grandson was wounded
in the leg but this did not stop
him from making his rendezvous
with de Goiti ©irr the shorts of
Manila Bay.


% jA The Spanish expeditionary forces anchored at Cavite. Manila faced
* them as a heavy palisade on the southern bank of the Pasig, manned
by warriors under the Rajah Soliman. The Spaniards tried diplomacy first.
In answer to a message from them, Soliman agreed to meet them on a
neutral shore. Declaring that he wished to be a friend of the strangers but
that they should not abuse his people, the rajah embraced the field mar-
shall in a gesture of peace.
s en But by friendship, the Spaniards understood recognition of their
king’s sovereignty and the payment of tribute. This the Filipinos
did not want to give. The situation grew tense amid mutual suspicion and
distrust. One morning in June, IS7O, Goiti ordered the firing of a cannon
in the direction of the Manila fort, to recall a prau which he had sent on
an errand to Soliman. The Filipino chieftain misinterpreted it as the
beginning of a Spanish attack and fighting broke out.
• The Filipinos learned then, as they were to learn often afterward In their history, that gallantry and courage are no match for superior arma-
ments. Manila fell and about a hundred Filipinos were killed and eighty taken prisoner. Among the dead was found a Portuguese artillery-man.
Soliman however escaped. His victorious antagonists took possession of the fallen city in the name of the King of Spain.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 12
ICO Goiti was uneasy in this newly found kingdom. In the
" first place he knew that the brave Rajah Soliman who escaped the
clutches of his indomitable soldiers was bound to return and avenge his
defeat. Then he also thought it best to avoid the coming of the rains.
Without giving a chance to his adversary to even their score he abandoned
Manila and sailed back to Panay.
1 CO Immediately after Goiti left Manila, Soliman and his men returned
* **** to their kingdom. Once more he reigned supreme. From the ashes
of their burned houses he tried to rebuild their once prosperous village.
Defeated but never daunted, Soliman inspired his men to work for the
greater glory of their kingdom, to watch and defend it against the in-
vaders should they come encroaching upon their land again.
1C A Soliman did not enjoy his return to Manila for long. On or about the beginning of May, 1571, Soliman saw the Spanish flotilla, consisting of 27
■ boats, 280 Spaniards and several hundred Visayans, appear In Manila Bay. He knew that he was not strong enough to meet the invaders so
he decided to set fire to his Village and fled to Tondo. It was a veritable scorched earth tactics.


IRK From the deck of the Spanish flagship, Legazpi himself who was in command of the expedition when it left Panay on April 15, 1571, gazed long
■ and hard at the burning city. Being a brave and just man, he could well surmise the attitude of the lion-hearted Soliman who preferred to
reduce his kingdom to ashes rather than give it up to the conquerors.
1 RA Le^az P i » however, was pleased to meet a man of tact and diplomacy
* exemplified, by Rajah Lakandula of Tondo, the sagacious uncle of
the fiery Soliman. The aged Rajah, realizing the futility of resisting the
superior Spanish arms, went out of his way and welcomed Legazpi to
Manila. Legazpi was only too willing to accept Lakandula’s offer of peace
and friendship, and for such noble gesture he also forgave Soliman’s
animosity.
1 But Soliman could not give' up so easily. A man of action and
* " courage like his predecessor Lapulapu, he painstakingly gathered a
fleet of 40 war boats and a large force of fighting men with the help of
the datus of Hagonoy, Macabebe and other barangays of Bulacan and
Pampanga. His plea for aid was such that other chieftains cast their fate
with him against the invaders.


IPA Soliman’s frail boats were locked in combat with Goiti’s sturdy flotilla at Bankusay channel, Manila Bay, on June 3, 1571. It was one of the most
bitterly fought battles on that historic bay. But the Spaniards were superior in number as well as in arms—a factor whichwrestco victory from the
puny courage of Soliman and his men.
1 £0 Soliman fell—happy in the thought that he fought for his heritage. He was the last Filipino king of Manila. His death meant the early extinction
i 3 * of Malay independence which he cherished most in his time. By sacrificing his life on the altar of freedom Soliman achieved immortal distinction
as one of the most courageous Filipino heroes.

■® ■ medan Manila, Legazpi
founded a new Christian city on

tion. Then he made it the capital
of the Archipelago. He also laid
out new streets whose names and
locations were preserved up to the
outbreak of World War 11. He built
a palace for himself and 150
houses for the other Spaniards.

his power over most of central
Luzon. Rajah Lakandula assisted

against th 6 Spaniards, knowing its
futility. He aided Legazpi in re-
building Manila and he assisted
Goiti in the latter’s campaigns
in central Luzon.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 13.
163 With ihe threat of Soliman removed, Legazpi felt free to expand the Spanish beach-head on Luzon. In 1571 he sent two of his ablest captains
on expeditions of conquest: Goiti, to the region north of Manila, and .Salcedo, to the south. The “adelantado’s” bold grandson won some 26,000
Tagialog subjects for the Spanish crown. Then he crossed the mountain barrier to the Bicol peninsula and became the first Spaniard to find in the Phil-
ippines what the explorers and conquerors of the age sought wherever they sailed: gold. The placer mines that Salcedo saw at Paracale are still rich
and famous.
ILA Salcedo’s success in the south earned him another important as-
signment: the conquest of northern Luzon. He undertook the cam-
paign in 1572 with only 45 men. Working up the western coast from Manila,
he subdued the littoral of Zambales and Pangasinan and then fought the
Ilocanos in the Samtoy regions. During the campaign, the present capital
of Ilocos Sur received the name of Villa Fernanama. in honor of Fer-
nando, first-born son of Philip 11. It lasted a year and Salcedo was not to
see his beloved grandfather again.
111 Legazpi was succeeded by Guido de Lavezares, whose appointment
came from Mexico in 1572. The new “adelantado” continued to
make good use of Salcedo’s military prowess.
165 Manila died of a heart-attack on August 20, 1572. The
9 “adelantado” had served his king well. After the repeated failures
of his predecessors he had first established the power of Spain in the
western isles. He had driven off the raids of the Spaniard’s perennial
competitors, the Portuguese. He had survived the rigors of nature and the
fierce resistance of the Filipinos. Legazpi took away the freedom of our
forefathers but at* least he was prudent enough to make the process as
palatable as possible.
Tj Ly Sent once more to the Bicol peninsula, Salcedo left Manila in July,-
1573, with 120 men, pacified Camarines and Albay, and destroyed
a pirate stronghold in Catanduanes.


1 £fi Salcedo’s military career, which began when he joined his grand-
■father’s forces at Cebu in 1567, was now approaching its climax.
In Vigan in 1574 Salcedo learned from a Spanish sergeant of a vast inva-
sion fleet that threatened the Spanish dominion of the Philippines.
11Q The invasion was commanded by Limahong, a Chinese outlaw
proscribed by his emperor, who sought to carve out a kingdom of
his own. He entered Manila bay on November 29, 1574, with a fleet of
62 war-junks carrying 2,000 soldiers, 2,000 seamen, 1,500 women, many
artisans and farmers, and enormous quantities of supplies.
*l7ft The opening: attack on the Spanish city of Manila was led by Sioco, Limahong’s Japanese lieutenant. The pirate chief himself remained in the
background, confident of victory. Sioco, at the head of 600 men, reduced Parahaque and, on the morning of November 30, St. Andrew’s day,
marched against Manila.


171 oco was ® a ff am bayan by Gotti, who fought a delaying action against heavy odds. The veteran of the Luzon conquest was finally
cut down. His wife was wounded, his house burned. But he gained precious time for the defenders of Manila.
IW Under the direction of Lavezares, a long breastwork of barrels and
boxes filled with sand had been frantically constructed to reenforce
the wooden palisade protecting the city.
173 Wi* en Sioco finally shook off Goiti and attacked, he was met with
withering gunfire from well-prepared positions. He was hurled back
and as a result received the scorn and anger of Limahong.


174 This map was made in 1577 which was six or seven years after Legazpi founded Manila. It is considered the
first map made of the Old Manila. Note the streets whose layout bears a general similarity to their present arrange-
ment, as if the lapse of more than three and half centuries has not made very much difference.
17C Meantime Salcedo had arrived in Manila after forced marches from Vigan. He assumed command of the beleaguered garrison and thus his mili-
-1 # ** tary genius came face to face with its most crucial test, for Lima hong had decided tq lead his men in person. On December 3, after a two-
day rest, the Chinese invader landed 1,500 men and mounted a three-pronged attack from Malate. It was this decisive battle between East and West which
settled the character of Philippine civilization for centuries. Not until Bataan would a similar battle befoughtagain.lt is interesting to note that, as
in Bataan, the Filipinos fought on the Western side and that, as in the recent war, the Asian invasion was turned back.


i if Limahong had known how to attract the Filipinos, he might
have had better luck. For, resentful of the maltreatment of his
countrymen by the Spaniards, Lakandula had led a revolt in 1574, simul-
taneously with the Chinese invasion. Only the timely intervention of
Salcedo, who promised reforms and concessions, preserved Filipino loyalty.

m aiA In his own way Limahong had helped to establish formal relations between the Chinese government and the Spanish colony in the Philippines.
I/ 0 i n 1575 the Viceroy of Fukien had petitioned the Manila authorities for the delivery of the outlaw. Governor Lavezares was unable to comply
with the request. Instead he sent a mission to China inviting friendship and trade. The Spanish envoys were Fr. Martin de Rada, Fr. Geronimo Marin,
Capt. Miguel de Loarca, and Capt. Pedro Sarmiento.


| "iQ The gallant Salcedo died on March 11, 1576. An era ended with him. More than any other man, this bold young military genius had established
* * * Spanish dominion in the Philippines. He had marched almost the length and breadth of Luzon and its outlying islands, from the llocos to the Bicols,
from Mindoro to Polillo. He had crushed the mightiest threat to the new colony with skill and bravery. His mission accomplished while still in the
flower of his manhood, he had retired to Vigan as a peaceful ‘encomendero.’ There, like many another warrior, he died in bed.
| QA The crown of Spain was fortunate in having as its servants in those decisive days the brains of Legaspi and the strong arm of Salcedo. Together,
■ grandfather and grandson implanted Spanish sovereignty in practically the whole of Luzon, except the mountain provinces and the eastern coast,
and most of the Visayas, except the interim* of Fanay, Cebu and Samar. ,


Ifil their internal position more or less secure, the Spaniards in the Philippines had more time for foreign relations. Soon after the arrival of a
■ ® ■ Chinese embassy in Manila in 1576, a commercial treaty was concluded. Chinese immigration was encouraged to provide cheap skilled labor.
lAn At first the Chinese were allowed, to settle freely. In 1581, however, they were segregated outside the city near San Gabriel Chapel, in what was
called the Alcaiceria or Parian. The original Parian having been destroyed by fire, the immigrants were given another site where the Botanical
Gardens of Manila were to be located centuries later.


mThe economic problem raised by Spanish policy still persists; in
their day however the Spaniards were more concerned with what
they believed to be a military problem. The Chinese immigrants became
so numerous that memories of Limahong’s terrible invasion began to stir
uneasily.
1 fid When three mandarins arrived in Manila on May 23, 1603, looking
■ ® ' for a “mountain of gold” in Cavite, suspicions mounted. Upon their
departure Governor Bravo de Acufia instituted precautionary measures
whose severity in turn aroused Chinese fears that they would be
exterminated.
n qj- Determined to strike the first blow, the Chinese rebelled under the leadership of Eng-kang, whose Christian name was Juan Bautista de Vera.
lOD Hurled back from the Walled City the Chinese took to the mountains of Laguna and Batangas, where they were crushed by a mixed force of Fili-
pinos, Spaniards, and Japanese. About 23,000 Chinese were slain in the first Chinese uprising of 1603. But their numbers were so great, their immigration
so persistent, that in 1639 they were in a position to revolt once more in Calamba. The fighting spread rapidly and about 22 towns were plundered and
burned by the rebels.


lOi The last serious threat of Chinese invasion eame from another
■'*** pirate, Koxinga, who had already conquered Formosa. Early in
1662 Koxinga sent an emissary to Manila demanding tribute. He secured
nothing more than new restrictive measures against the Chinese.
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 15
1 But the new laws failed to stop the inflow of good and bad Chinese.
One of the latter was an ex-convict named Tingco who plotted to
kill the Spaniards in August 1686. His forces were put to rout and Tingco
himself paid for his crimes on the scaffold.
100 The Chinese problem remained unsolved in spite of terrible massacres and mass expulsion. As early as 1578 Governor Arandia had tried to sup-
** plant the Chinese traders with Spaniards and mestizos. These ambitious plans failed as many others in succeeding centuries were to fail. Patient,
industrious, thrifty, schooled by the cruel struggle for survival in their native country to sacrifices which seemed unnecessary in gentler climes and
more lavish lands, the Chinese overcame all the handicaps of nature and government. They inter-married easily and gave their best characteristics to the
new developing Filipino nation. So many of them came and stayed that toward the end of the Spanish regime they numbered 100,000.


100 Meantime another Oriental people made its influence felt. Like the Chinese, the Japanese had maintained relations with the Filipinos long be-
' fore the coming of the Spaniards. There were several hundreds established in Dilao {Paco, Manila) and the Spaniards found other Japanese set-
tlements In San Miguel, Bulacan, and in Agoo, La Union, which was known as the “Puerto del Japon” because of its active trade with that country.
IQA The Japanese did not accept the Spanish conquest meekly. Feared throughout the Asian littoral for their piratical raids, they fought bitterly
* against the newcomers. In 1572 Salcedo clashed with them off the coast of Pangasinan and in 1583 Captain Juan Pablo Carrion engaged Japa-
nese pirates in battle at the mouth of the Cagayan river. Two of the Japanese ships were sunk; the rest fled.


191 EVen then ‘ the Japanese tried to utilize Filipino nationalism for their own purposes. The leaders of the Tondo revolt of 1588 among whom
were Agustin de Legazpi, Martin Panga and Magat Salamat, sought the aid of Japan and a Japanese known as Captain Joan Gayo smuggled
arms to the Filipino insurgents. The rebellion failed and all the leaders, including a Christian Japanese, were executed. It was noteworthy, neverthe-
less, because it was the first organized Filipino resistance against foreign domination.
IQ2 The first open challenge to
I ' A Spanish sovereignty was
delivered soon afterward by Hide-
yoshi, a dwarfish groom whose
military genius had raised him to
the dictatorship of Japan under
the nominal authority of the em-
perors. Hideyoshi demanded hom-
age and tribute in 1591. The Span-
iards, realizing the weakness of
their position at the time, hastily
despatched emissaries with gifts
and temporizing messages. Hide-
yoshi’s ill-starred campaigns in
Korea and his death prevented a
Japanese invasion of the Philip-
pines.
1A) Alarmed by Hideyoshi's
■ threats, the Spaniards
started to deport the Japanese
from the Philippines as a precau-
tionary measure. The latter at first
resisted and were reconciled to the
move only by the timely interven-
tion of the friars.


IQJ The deportation plan was
* well under way when a
forced-labor measure caused the
remaining Japanese to rise in open
revolt. By this time they were no
match few the government forces
who razed the Dilao colony to the
ground.
IQF In Japan itself, however, a
* change in policy relieved
the Philippines from the danger of
Japanese invasion for the next
three centuries. A new Japanese
dictator, lyeyasu Tokugawa,
alarmed by the boast of a Spanish
captain from the Philippines that
the Spaniards conquered countries
by Christianizing them first, de-
cided to close the island empire to
the outside world. Christianity was
proscribed and all Christians per-
secuted by him and his successors.
Those who escaped massacre were
exiled, among them some noble
lords led by Takayama Ukon who
were given asylum by the Span-
iards in Manila. No Japanese ever
came into the Philippines after
them until modern times.

CHAPTER 16
IQ# in their first precarious century in the Philippines; the Spanish colonists had to cope not only with the dangerous rivalry of Chinese and Japa-
■*" nese settlers but also with sea-raids by the Portuguese, the Dutch and the southern Filipinos whom, because of their religion, they called the
Moros. While these raids were bloody and destructive, they never seriously threatened Spanish sovereignty. The Portuguese, and later the Dutch, at-
tacked the Spaniards in the course of their genera! conflicts in Europe and the Orient, without any serious intention of disputing possession of the
Philippines. The Moros, for their part, although they had attempted to rule the entire archipelago before the coming of the Spaniards with such success
that Manila had been a Mohammedan stronghold, were later moved more by desire for revenge and by the need of defending their own freedom. Of-
fense was the Moros’ best defense, and such a good one that the Spaniards never conquered them.
mlhc last of the free Filipinos entered their long solitary war against the Spaniards as early as 1578 when the Spaniards attacked Jolo In the
course of their over-all campaign of conquest in the Philippines. A Spanish fleet under Captain Rodriguez de Figueroa defeated the forces of
Sultan Panguian. Over the ruins of Jolo the Sultan and his. followers swore revenge on the Spaniards and the Christian Filipinos who had helped them.


IQO The first blow was not long in coming. Two daring Moro chieftains,
■ ' ® Sali and Silonga, massed a fleet of 50 boats in July 1599 and raided
the coastal towns of Panay, Negros, and Cebu, burning houses and churches
and taking slaves. The next year Sali and Silonga attacked Arevalo on
Panay but they were repulsed by the local population.
IQQ As a counter-measure against such raids, punitive expeditions were
sent to Jolo and Mindanao in 1602. When these failed to achieve
permanent results, a military base was established at Zamboanga in 1635
by Governor Juan Cerezo de Salamanca. Fort Pilar was erected there
under the direction of a Jesuit engineer.
OAA His back protected by this new base at the frontier of Moroland, another governor, the doughty Corcuera, headed a full-scale expedition against
AvU M oros i n February 1637. His strong force of 760 Spaniards and thousands of Christian Filipinos reduced the Lanao stronghold of Sultan
Corralat and, on the following year, took Jolo after a protracted siege of three and a half months. Corcuera was hailed as a conqueror upon his re-
turn to Manila in May 1638 and believed perhaps that he had broken the Moslem power.


The southern Filipinos, however, were never to be conquered by the Spaniards. And as Spanish power grew increasingly distracted and dispersed
I by attacks from other quarters, it fell back on the defensive, content to contain the Moro raids with a defense net of forts, watch-towers, and
patrols by armed galleys.
OA7 Meantime the Dutch,
another race of daring sea-
rovers, had been making attacks
of their own, the result of their
struggle for independence from
Spain in Europe and their subse-
quent colonial competition in the
Orient. As in the case of the Mo-
ros, religion too played a decisive
role for the Dutch were a Pro-
testant power. Their first recorded
raid was made in 1600 by Admiral
Oliver van Noort. Their strongest
blow was given on April 13, 1617,
when a formidable fleet tried to
enter Manila bay but was repulsed
and driven off by Spaniards and
Filipinos under Don Juan Ron-
quillo.
Several other naval engage-
ments took place, always
with disastrous results for the
Dutch. The Filipinos were scarcely
affected by these battles at sea
until in 1647 the Dutch took Cor-
regidor and plundered the coastal
towais of Bataan. In Abucay they
massacred 400 Filipinos—to their
subsequent discomfiture and regret.


Filipino soldiers, embittered by the Abucay slaughter, fought savagely under Captain Juan de Chaves and drove away the Dutch, who had been
L IW weakened by an epidemic. In subsequent years other sporadic raids were made by the Dutch but they never again seriously endangered the
Spaniards in the Philippines.
Toward the end of the first century of Spanish colonization, however, Manila suffered a blow more disastrous than any inflicted by foreign
A\JO f oe or re bel. A gigantic earthquake, the strongest yet recorded in our history, leveled Manila to the ground on November 30, 1645. Its ruins were
still to be seen near the Cathedral even in our own day.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 17
CHURCH AND STATE
From the first days the Spaniards raised here the white standard with
the red cross or, in the terms of political symbolism, the cross and the
sword against the crescent and the kampilan. For while other nations from
an expanding Europe sought spices, gold, and trade, Spain sent her mis-
sionaries side by side with her soldiers, when not ahead of them, in a
partnership so intimate that it is impossible to conceive that either had
the primacy or preference even as early as the time of the famed Demar-
cation Line which defined the title to discovered lands.
For if in modern times the Wilson doctrine justifies the domination
of weaker races by the. stronger only when it is for the protection of the
former and for their own good, without thought of exploitation, in the
Magellanic period Christianization was the best justification although only
when the people to be evangelized did not show opposition or seek revenge
as in China and Japan, which indeed were never conquered.
The paramount importance which Spain gave to her Christianizing
mission, coupled with the vagueness of any division oi authority, leu how-
ever to many unfortunate disputes between Church and State, especially
during the first century of Spanish dominion. In the beginning the con-
flict arose from the vigorous defense made by the friars of the rights of
the Filipinos. As early as 1574 Fr. Martin de Rada denounced to Lavezares,
Legazpi’s successor, the abuses of the military whom he accused of making
unjust wars and levying excessive tributes. In 1583, the Dominican Do-
mingo de Salazar, first bishop of Manila, carried the fight to the foot
of the throne, protesting in person to the king against the cruel treat-
ment to the Filipinos. It was of such courageous championship of our
natural rights that the vexing problem of Church and State was bom In
the Philippines.
"J. C. de V."
FT, Andres de Urdaneta
OAiL Before writing to Philip in Madrid Bishop Salazar had called the first Conciliar Council in Manila the year before at which he had secured the
approval of a memorial which might well have served the Filipinos then as a Magna Charta. Among other trenchant expositions of principle the
Catholic prelates declared that the government, dominion, and administration of justice in these islands “by natural right belong to the Indies and
neither the King nor the Pope can take it away from them... The Indios are as free in their lands as the Spaniards are in theirs, and this liberty is
not taken away by the King or by the Gospel.”


AATf Striking back at the clergy’s charges against the civil authorities,
Governor Perez Dasmarinas in turn denounced the friars’ own
abuses in another letter to the king in 1592. He claimed that the friars
themselves compelled the Filipinos to work for them without pay.
When Guerrero upheld the inviolability of sacred edifices, Corcuera
sent his soldiers anyway to seize the culprit. Guerrero excom-
municated Corcuera but the latter threw him into Fort Santiago. The
tables were turned when the governor’s successor imprisoned Corcuera
himself. Guerrero’s vindication and victory established a precedent that
his enemies should have remembered.
AAO The conflict passed the letter-writing stage when Hernando Gue-
rrero was archbishop and Hurtado de Corcuera governor. A Spanish
soldier, failing to get back a slave girl, killed her and then took refuge in
St. Augustine church in accordance with the “right of sanctuary.”
?|A in the next clash the Church was again triumphant. After a quar-
“ ■ V rel over parish jurisdiction, Governor Juan de Vargas exiled Arch-
bishop Felipe Pardo to Lingayen. But once again the governor’s successor
upheld the clergy. Excommunicated, Vargas was sentenced to do penance
by standing daily in the habit of a penitent with a rope about his neck
and a lighted taper in his hand, at the doors of the cathedral and the
other churches.


*l The conflict reached a sanguinary climax when Governor Busta-
“ * ■ mante arrested Archbishop Cuesta in a dispute over the old problem
of the right of sanctuary, which had been extended to Bustamante’s
political enemies. The governor had made himself unpopular and it was
easy to call up a mob against him.
Meantime the long campaign against the Mohammedan Filipinos
in the south took a new turn shortly before the British invasion
when the learned law-giver, Alimud Din I, ascended the throne of Jolo. A
tolerant ruler, he granted Spanish missionaries the right to preach among
his people and even to build a> church and a fort.
Ol** Bustamante and his son were killed but the conflict between
“ Church and State was to survive and plague the Spanish regime
throughout its duration. Indeed the division of authority was to cripple
Spanish resistance to the coming British invasion.
For a while it looked as if the Spaniards had finally solved their
“ ■ ■ toughest problem. But the sultan’s brother Bantilan overthrew him
in 1749 and Alimud Din had to seek refuge in Zamboanga and then in
Manila. He and his two children were converted to Christianity, the sultan
taking the name of Don Fernando.


215 The s P aniar^s Promptly sent out an expedition which defeated Bantilan. They were about to restore “the Catholic sultan 5 ’ to his throne when
A 1 the Spanish governor of Zamboanga announced that he had intercepted a treasonable letter from Alimud Din to the sultan of Mindanao. Alimud
Din was sent back to Manila, where he was thrown into Fort Santiago. Subsequently however he persuaded the Spaniards to allow his daughter to
negotiate a peace with Bantilan. The princess was successful and a treaty was signed with the Mohammedan chiefs which promised the return of all
Christian prisoners, religious objects, and Spanish arms, captured in the various raids.
21 L The treaty however failed to bring permanent peace. With the fall of Spanish power and prestige upon the British invasion, the Moro raids were
* I ** to reach a high tide when the Mohammedan warriors would capture an average of five hundred slaves a year and cost the Spaniards one and a
half million pesos in the military expenses of 20 years and untold millions more in lost and ruined property.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 18
The first, like the last, Filipino revolt against the Spaniards was.
“ B " betrayed by a woman, who pointed out the members of a Pam-
pango conspiracy in 1585. But the causes for discontent were so numerous,
so varied, and so persistent that rebellion became only the logical con-
tinuation of the original Filipino resistance to the Spanish conquest.
A natural reason for early uprisings was the ambition of the de-
“ ■ ® throned and dispossessed chiefs. Thus in 1588 the chiefs of Tondo
allied themselves with the chiefs of Misilo, Polo, and Taes and sought the
help of the chiefs of Cuyo and Borneo and even the dictator of Japan to
regain their power. But their plans were discovered and thwarted.
2IQ In 1596, during the term of Governor Francisco Tello, Cagayan rose under two brothers, one of whom', Magalat, was too strong to be.defeated
" ■ * in open battle. He led two revolts with the help of other chiefs from the north. Where Spanish steel failed, however, Spanish gold succeeded. Hired
assassins put an end to Magalat’s career, murdering him in his own house.


Given the evangelical objective of the Spanish conquest, it was to be expected that another cause for revolt would be religious. From the begin-
ning the Igorots of northern Luzon had resisted all attempts to convert them, revolting in 1601 and killing the missionary whom Governor Tello
had sent to them with an expedition. A similar religious revolt of the Gaddangs in 1621 was however pacified by the intervention of another missionary
who, in the end, was allowed to depart unharmed with all the ornaments of his church.
1 A third religious revolt was that of Bancao, a convert who in his
■ old age apostatized and preached a return to the old gods. Many
in Leyte heeded h& call but Bancao was beaten by the alcalde-mayor of
Cebu who rushed a strong expedition of 40 boats manned by Christian
Filipinos.
0 % 0 % 0 % In nearby Bohol the old gods also raised their heads once more.
Led by Tamblot, and heartened by the prophecies of their pagan
priests that they would triumph with the aid of their ancient divinities,
about 1,500 Boholanos took to the field but were defeated, again by Chris-
tian Cebuanos.


New kings, as well as old kings, continued to threaten Spanish rule. Pedro Ladia, a Bornean who claimed descent from Lakandula, urged the peo-
pie of Malolos to rise in 1643 and enthrone him as King of the Tagalogs. He won many followers but before he could strike, his campaign was
effectively counteracted by Spanish missionaries. Ladia was taken and executed in Manila.
OOA Another Pampango revolt literally flared up in 1660 when the
■ Pampangos set fire to their own houses and swore by the light of
their burning homes to fight for their rights. Their leader, Francisco
Maniago, might have had more success had not Governor Manrique de
Lara persuaded Juan Macapagal, chief of Arayat, to remain loyal. Still
Maniago secured some concessions.
MC It remained for Francisco Dagohoy to lead the first unbeaten revolt
against Spanish rule. Infuriated by the decision of a priest to deny
Christian burial to his brother, Dagohoy organized a formidable rebellion
in Bohol in 1744 and established his own government in the island’s
mountains. In his stronghold he remained until 1828, unconquered to
the last.


British invasion, which shall be covered in the next chapter, brought to a head not only the conflict between Church and State hut also the
chronic state of unrest among the Filipinos. The defeat of the Spaniards raised the hearts of the discontented. Outstanding among their leaders
was famed Diego Silang who, imprisoned by the Spaniards after he had offered to assist them, turned against them and allied himself with the invaders
after his escape. He was so successful in his ir tive north that the British recognized him as governor of Ilocos, He died like Magalat at the hands of
a hired assassin.
The murder of Silang demoralized his followers. But his wife Gabriela was a brave woman who resolved to carry on the work of her husband.
Mmmt g|j e jpj a revo it In Kabugao but was defeated by an army from Ilocos Norte. She escaped to Abra and raised a new force with which she
attempted to attack Vigan. But again she was defeated, this time by the archers of Piddig. She was caught and hanged.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 19
in the years before the British invasion, the Filipinos gave
constant proofs by their revolts of their desire to rule
themselves, they furnished equally eloquent evidence of their
ability to do so, particularly in the person of Miguel Lino de Ezpe-
leta. Born in Manila, he studied for the priesthood in the Real
Colegio de San Jose and rose gradually in the ecclesiastical career
until at the age of 59 he was consecrated bishop of Cebu. While at
his see in the south both the archiepiseopal see in Manila and the
governor-generalship became vacant and Ezpeleta came to the capital
to act in the two highest capacities in the Philippines of that time.
The Moro-Mohammedan wars were then at a high pitch and Ezpe-
leta’s energetic measures against them prove his excellent leader-
ship. The new archbishop of Manila, the Spaniard Manuel Rojo,
having arrived, however, he sought to be also acting governor-
general. The Filipino prelate refused to surrender his civil authority.
When the Junta de Autoridades met to decide the dispute, Ezpeleta
called up his troops and surrounded the palace where the sessions
were being held. Then, when the Junta asked him for his authority
to continue as governor, Ezpeleta pointed simply to his troops.
He was the first Filipino governor-general under Spain and the
last; not until a similar conjunction of circumstances occurred under
the United States was there an acting Filipino governor general
and only for a few days. He was also the first Filipino archbishop
of Manila and, to this day, the only one. Even in the independent
Republic of the Philippines, the archbishop of Manila continues to
be a foreigner.
99ft The Filipinos were engulfed once more in a war not of their own
making when Spain was drawn by dynastic loyalties into the Seven
Years’ War between England and France. Communications between the
metropolis and its colony were so bad that when a British fleet appeared
off Manila on September 23, 1762 and landed a force under artillery
fover. it took the Spaniards completely by surprise.
Ilmo. Sr. D. Miguel Lino de Espeleta
Obispo de Cebu y Gobernador de Filipinas (1757-1761)
99Q Ezpeleta ’s successor as archbishop, Rojo, was by now acting gov-
““ " ernor also. He lacked the Filipino prelate’s qualities of leadership
but he found the courage to refuse the summons to surrender sent by
General William Draper and Admiral Samuel Cornish. Instead he launched
200 Spaniards and 800 Filipino lancers in a determined sortie against the
tightening British siege. The attack was repulsed.


250 Gallant as usual in fighting the battles of their foreign masters,
the Filipinos made other attacks. On October 3 Manalastas led
3,000 archers from Pampanga, Bulacan and Laguna in a fierce assault
that forced the British' to call for reinforcements.
251 That same day the Spaniards called a council of war inside the
■ beleaguered capital. Strangely enough it was the professional sol-
diers who proposed surrender in the face of heavy odds; the priests, mer-
chants and magistrates opposed it and voted to fight to the last.
xhe misguided enthusiasm of the civilians proved fatal. The next day the British broke through the east walls after a heavy barrage and the
Jr p as jg ran re< j w ith the blood of those who sought to flee from the disaster foretold by the military experts. The slaughter compelled Rojo to
raise the white flag.


Under the terms of surrender the Spaniards turned over Manila,
Cavite, and other forts to the British as well as a war indemnity
of four million pesos. The British promised protection of property, freedom
of religion and trade, the preservation of the Audiencia, and the parole
of all Spanish officers.
Shortly before the fall of Manila, however, Rojo had commissioned
Simon de Anda, a member of the Audiencia, as lieutenant-general.
Anda escaped to Bulacan in a banca with 500 pesos and organized a re-
sistance movement. He proclaimed himself governor-general with seat
at Bacoor.
Anda’s movement attracted thousands of Filipinos who remained
loyal to the fallen Spanish regime. Under his orders a strategy of
containment was executed against the British in Manila. Guerrilla guards
were stationed at Pasig to intercept food going into the capital from
Laguna.
OOJL The British brought pressure to bear upon Rojo who was inti-
midated into a pacification campaign. Anda denounced Rojo and
claimed the legitimate Spanish authority in the Philippines. The con-
troversy dragged on until Rojo,’s death on January 30, 1764. The British
gave him full military honors.


227 While the resistance movement prospered, the British took to quarreling among themselves. Governor Drake, who was in charge of the military
** administration, clashed constantly with General Draper and Admiral Cornish, the military commanders. This situation, not without historical
parallels in the Philippines, reached a point where charges of bribery, malversation of public funds, and disobedience of orders, were brought against
Drake.
OOQ The British occupation lasted almost two years, six months too long because news of peace in Europe was delayed by difficulties of communica-
tion. Upon the death of Rojo the British had to recognize Anda as the legitimate governor and the resistance leader had the satisfaction of return-
ing triumphantly into Manila on May 31, 1764. Amid salvos he raised the Spanish flag once more. The Filipinos cheered this symbol of their colonialism".


The British did not give up hopes of returning to the Philippines.
Long after they had evacuated Manila, they maintained a base in
one of the Sulu islands. In 1773 Anda sent an emissary to protest against
this unauthorized retention.
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 20
The southern Filipinos finally did for the Spaniards what the latter
were unable to do for themselves. A Jolo chief, Datu*Tengteng, at-
tacked the British garrison and compelled it to withdraw with large loss
of military supplies, arms, and money.
The end of war and enemy occupation enabled the Philippines to enter into an era of peaceful progress and development. Under the farsighted
■ and energetic lose Basco y Vargas, one of the worthiest Spanish governors of the country, whose term began in 1778, ambitious programs were
established for the improvement of agriculture, commerce, and industry, principally through the Economic Society of Friends of the Country, founded
by Basco.
EVENING NEWS


B asco was an economic planner and. then as now, planned economy
• was often incompatible with individual liberty, fiasco’s tobacco
monopoly, conceived as a revenue-raising measure and as a means to in-
crease and standardize production, led, for example, to official corruption,
smuggling, and unreasonable searches and seizures of private property.
Discontent was bred by these abuses and several minor uprisings
“took place against both the tobacco and the wine monopolies. But
the most serious revolt was not due entirely to these causes. A warlike and
restless people, the Kalingas, revolted in 1785 under Lagutao. It took three
hundred musketeers from Cagayan to subdue them.
*%AA But although he conquered the Batanes and subdued the Kalingas, fiasco made his nine-year term a period of economic development rather than
*■* military glory. His well-integrated -program made the colonial government self-supporting and laid the basis for the country’s foreign trade. . w


fiasco’s policy was followed by his successor, Felix Berenguer, who
drew up a program of reforms. It was also during his term that a
Spanish expedition under Captain Malaspina charted the San Bernardino
strait, the coasts of some of the Visayan islands, and part of Mindanao.
The expedition had been ordered to make scientific observations
as well and one of its members, Antonio Pineda, studied the flora
of the Philippines and agricultural conditions here. He died in Hoc os in July
1792 after three years of valuable pioneering- work on Philippine botany.
J*V Agriculture and commerce, science and exploration, were, however, not allowed to enjoy for long a time of undisturbed peace. The Moro raids
continued, and indeed reached such an extent that the Mohammedan Filipinos plundered the coasts of Luzon as far north as Bataan from a base
in Mamburapv Mindoro. The “vlntas” and “pancos” used for defense were replaced with cannon-carrying launches and there were some brisk fights at
sea. But the southern raiders were still too fast, too strong, and too many.


The eastern, as well as the western, coasts of Luzon felt the Moro lunges at the hated Christians. In Baler, Casiguran, and Palanan, for in-
*** stance, the Moros took 450 captives including three parish priests.
249 lD 1796 the of a new Br *tish invasion brought a strong fleet
under Admiral Alava. The threat did not materialize but Alava
stayed until 1802 and his squadron helped to stabilize the situation. The
sight of the men-o’-war, quietly at anchor, reassured the anxious.
250 In the main however 14 was an era of peace and progress. The
population increased; highways were built; streets in Manila were
lighted at public expense for the first time. In December 180& a bureau of
vaccination was created and the ravages of smallpox greatly curbed.


2C|The French Revolution brought forth not only the historic declara-
" tion of the rights of man but also the first of the modern dictators,
Napoleon Bonaparte, who, harnessing the spirit of the revolution to a vast
military machine, conquered almost the whole of Europe outside of England
and Russia. He influenced the life of the Filipinos when he dethroned the
king of Spain and set up instead his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as
puppet ruler.
* os eyes arrived too late for the opening of the session but he
participated in the deliberations and was one of the signers of the
new Spanish constitution, which was promulgated in Cadiz on March 19,
1812 and solemnly proclaimed in Manila on March 17, 1813. To the Fili-
pinos the constitution was the first recognition of their human and political
rights, and the first affirmation of the revolutionary ideas of liberty and
equality.
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 21
2CO Spaniards refused to recognize the new king and a resistance
movement spread rapidly which culminated in the convention of
the Cortes, the Spanish assembly of people's representatives. Under the
influence of the new spirit of liberty born of the French revolution, and
perhaps-also to win the loyalty of the colonies, the Filipinos were given
representation. The Filipino diputado Ventura de los Reyes arrived in
Madrid in 1811.
The Filipino delegate also proposed the abolition of the galleon
trade, which had brought vast wealth to a few Spaniards in Manila
and Acapulco in Mexico but which had gravely hindered the economic
development of the Philippines by virtually closing the local ex-
cept to the galleon monopoly. The Filipino proposal was supported by the
merchants in Spain itself, who wanted to share in the Asian trade, and
the galleon trade was abolished.


2CC The constitution of 1812, however, was abolished two years later by
Ferdinand VII, a stubborn absolutist, who regained his throne by
hypocritical shows of allegiance to the ideals of' the revolution and the
resistance.
The abolition of the constitution bewildered and dismayed the Fili-
pinos. The news spread swiftly, in part through the embryonic press
which had been born in the Philippines in 1811 in the form of a war gazette.
I The loss of constitutional rights provoked what Wfcs perhaps the first modern class revolution in the Philippines. Fifteen hundred Hocano peasants
rallied to the cry of liberty and equality in Sarrat, killed the rich townsmen and landowners, and were subdued only with difficulty.


2CC Upon the death of Ferdinand, his daughter Isabel ascended the
throne. To win the favor of the people she consented to a new
Cortes, which assembled on July 24, 1834. At first the Philippines had no
representation but two local deputies were elected in March 1835 and took
their seats later that year.
lt was a bad time for revolution, which everywhere met defeat at
the hands of triumphant reaction. Even the independent regime in
Bohol, founded by Dagohoy, was finally suppressed in 1827 after nearly
three quarters of a century.
2CQ The ferment of discontent and revolution, however, continued to
work in the Philippines. The Filipinos were not the only ones af-
fected. When they were replaced with Spaniards in 1822, Mexican officers
stationed here mutinied. A Pampanga regiment quelled the outbreak and
captured the leader. Captain Andres Novales.
The Chinese also felt the renewal of absolutism. In obedience to a
W 1 royal decree they were segregated and classified into those engaged
in foreign trade, domestic trade, and industrial arts. Many refused to obey
and returned to China or rise fled to the mountains.


20 was a * this also » * n th« year 1829, that a Spanish expedition under Guillermo Galvey, sent out to bring the mountain people of Benguet
and Abra under Spanish rule, stumbled upon a delightful land where the air was crisp and cool. The marvellously terraced mountains that Galvey
saw are still one of the engineering wonders of the world and Baguio’s invigorating climate to this day attracts international conferences.


*%LA Revolution was followed by reaction in Europe. Repressive measures
* were taken to stop the spread of the new ideas of liberty and equal-
ity. They were enforced in the Philippines in 1839 with the establishment
of a board of censorship which screened books and newspapers from abroad.

CHAPTER 22
No censors however could kill the desire for equality which, among
the Filipinos, naturally took a racial form. Its first apostle was Apo-
linario de la Cruz, a native of Tayabas, who was not allowed to enter ore
of the religious orders because of his color and thereupon founded his own.
Oi%i% De * a CrU2, confraternity, founded in 1840, gained many adherents, so many that the authorities suspected its members of political activity.
v Their meetings were prohibited, their leaders arrested. Thereupon the brotherhood rose in open rebellion, proclaiming De la Cruz king. At first
they were successful. With the help of the Negritos, they repulsed the forces of the provincial governor of Tayabas and killed him.


This set-back to the government forces alarmed the Spanish authorities in Manila. Reinforcements of regulars were dispatched to strengthen the
provincial militia. In the subsequent battle fought at Alitao the confraternity was defeated and De la Cruz was captured and shot. In his own way
he was the precursor of Burgos, Gomez and Zamora, and many other Filipino priests who to this day are still fighting for the principle of racial equality
in the Church.
a# q j n 1844 Narciso Claveria assumed the governorship of the Philippines. He seems to have been imbued with something of the liberal and scientific
spirit of the revolution. One of his accomplishments was the correction of the calendar after a conference with the archbishop. Due to an error of
early explorers, Philippine time had long been one day behind.


Claveria also introduced changes in provincial and municipal administration. He required two years' legal experience for alcaldes mayores and, in
* 1847, instituted limited municipal elections wherein the gobernadorcillo was elected by a board of thirteen under the presidency of the provincial
alcalde mayor. The election was subject to the confirmation of the governor general but it was doubtless a significant step forward.
A"f A Claveria even took steps to remedy the lamentable confusion of
** names which arose from the practice of giving the Filipinos Chris-
tian names in baptism, in many cases similar- or identical, without making
any provision for surnames. The Filipinos had their own native patrony-
mics but for purposes of their own the Spaniards frowned on their use
except by the old nobility. In a compromise measure which has survived to
this day and is probably a permanent feature of Filipino life, Claveria
sent out long lists of Spanish surnames in 1849 from which each family
was allowed to choose its own or assigned one.
0"f1 The shrewd and energetic governor finally turned toward the solu-
tion of the persistent Moro problem. His interest was stimulated
by evidences of French activity in the southern Philippines. When a
French fleet negotiated a treaty with the sultan of Sulu providing for the
cession of Basilan, the Spaniards determined to pacify the entire region
and assure their paramountcy. Jose Oyanguren was commissioned
to subtlue the western coast of Mindanao as far as the Cotabato river and
for this purpose was furnished artillery and ammunition. Claveria was
preparing an even more decisive measure.


The arrival of three steam-propelled warships, the Magallanes, Elcano and Reina de Castilla, signalled the beginning of the modern scientific age
in the Philippines, an age which was burgeoning rapidly from the increased freedom of man’s spirit. It was fitting that Claveria. who had in-
troduced so many modernizations in peaceful pursuits should also have sponsored the modernization of war in the Philippines. His new steamers were
faster than the vintas and were independent of shifting winds. They made short work of the once elusive Moro warcraft.
Claveria followed up his victories at sea with an assault on the fortifications at Balanguingui, just east of Jolo. After his departure, his successor,
Urbiztondo, sent an expedition in 1850 which destroyed the Samar stronghold in Tonquil and, on the following year, another force which pene-
trated the Sulu archipelago and captured the heart of Moro piracy in Jolo. In this ancient capital the Spaniards found five forts and a double line of
trenches facing the sea, once the dominion of Jolo’s daring rovers, now lost to the mechanical wonders of a new age they did not yet understand.

CHAPIER 23
JHA The middle of the nineteenth century was an era of unrest and -revolution all over Europe. In Spain the people drove Isabel out of the country
■ and set up a provisional government which promised reforms not only for the metropolis but also for the colonies, of which the Philippines was one*
The timely opening of the hew Suez canal shortened the route for liberalism as well as trade between Spain and the Philippines. A ditch dug in
the sands of Egypt thus hastened the development of Filipino nationalism. No longer were the Filipinos doomed by the exigencies of geography
to be forever one year behind the times.


t From the new government in Spain via the equally new Suez canal a new governor general came to the Philippines. Carlos de la Torre, fittingly
® enough a sincere liberal who dismissed the usual bodyguard and rode out alone in the streets with impressive simplicity; What was perhaps more
important, he treated Filipinos and Spaniards alike.
■» One of De la Torre’s first acts was to solve the persistent problem of law and order in davitfe arising from agrarian disputes by pardoning the
** " leader of the dissidents, Eduardo Camerino, and making him commander of the Guias de Torre, a police force composed mainly of the former
Outlaws.


a««a The new governor showed his sympathies with intellectuals and reformers too. At a reception which he gave to celebrate the Revolution of 1868, he
m * W welcomed Father Jose Burgos, Maximo Paterno, Joaquin Pardo de Tavera, and other prominent Filipinos and listened with understanding to
sentiments which his predecessors would have called treason.
De la Torre misjudged the strength and influence of reactionary
' elements in the Philippines. Many voices were soon raised against
his policy of attraction by appeasement. The friars in particular protested
against what they considered betrayals of the Spanish state and church.
The Filipino liberals were denounced to De la Torre as atheists or heretics.
OQA In the end liberalism was defeated. A change of government in
Spain brought a new governor to the Philippines, a hard and
haughty despot, Rafael de Izquierdo, who promptly reversed the trend of
De la Torre’s policies and set out to suppress the movement for'reforms.
He made the diehards happy but forced toiany Filipinos to despair of
peaceful means.


One of the first fruits of Izquierdo’s policy was the Cavite uprising.
"" ■ xhe Filipino garrison of the fort there conspired with their com-
rades in Manila to rise on the night of January 20, 1872. Rockets were to
be the signal for attack and when the Cavite garrison saw fireworks
lighted for a fiesta in Sampaloc, they thought that the hour agreed upon
had come. They took up arms under Lamadrid but they struck alone. Their
mutiny was quickly suppressed.
JQO It was a relatively unimportant riot. But the reactionaries saw a
splendid opportunity to get rid of their enemies. Many of the pro-
minent Filipinos who had advocated reforms under De la Torre were seized
on suspicion of complicity with the Cavite mutineers, among them the
priests Jose Burgos, Feliciano Gomez, Jacinto Zamora, Mariano Gomez,
and Agustin Mendoza. A council of war condemned some to death, others
to imprisonment and exile.
Burgos, Gomez and Zamora were condemned to die. To the last they protested their innocence and the Spanish archbishop of Manila, more Chris-
tian and impartial than others in his post, refused to unfrock then!. On February 17, 1872 the three Filipino priests were cruelly strangled with
the garfote on the field of Bagumbayan for a crime they had never committed. If they were guilty, they were guilty only of desiring racial equality in
the Church.

CHAPTER 24
aaj The summary arrests and executions for which the Cavite revolt provided an excuse enforced an artificial peace upon the Philippines. The prog-
MmT I ress jve movement was compelled to seek industrial and commercial rather than political outlets and a show of modern improvements resulted.
But the introduction of modern mechanical facilities only empha-
sized by contrast the outmoded feudal structure of Philippine life.
In a peasant country like the Philippines the conflict naturally centered
around the ownership of land. One celebrated example was the case of
the people of Calamba who contested the claims of the friars to their
lands, lost in court, and were evicted. Only a brutal policy of suppression
prevented a rebellion.
201 The government, however, saw the need for at least token reforms.
In 1884 the payment of tribute by every male inhabitant of the
archipelago was abolished. Instead a residence tax was imposed on both
male and female, Filipino and foreign, residents between the ages off 25
and 60 for which the evidence of payment was a paper of identification
called the “cedula personal.” But the Filipinos believed the new tax to
be still the old tribute and resentment persisted.


am Other reforms were introduced. In 1886 Filipino justices of the
' peace were appointed. The provincial governments were reorganized
and governors were appointed vested with executive power while the old
alcaldes may ores retained only judicial authority, thus introducing in part
the separation of powers.
But the land question remained unresolved. Feeling was particularly
bitter against the friars, who were great landlords and who were
accused of sabotaging the program of reforms. In 1888 a petition was
sent to the queen of Spain asking for the expulsion of the religious orders.
Eight hundred dared to sign their names.
7£Q Discontent among the Filipinos had not yet led to a separatist movement but only to a clamor for reforms. This was natural since the leaders of
the Filipinos at that time were for the roost part young men of substance who, like the representative group above, had studied and lived in Spain
and owed the metropolis at least intellectual and spiritual allegiance.


2QA Greatest and most beloved of these reformers was Jose Rizal, a
A V skilled physician whose chief concern were the ills of his unfortunate
country. A protean genius who excelled at everything he attempted, Rizal
was most effective as a patriotic propagandist. His two novels, the “Noli
me tangere” and “El Filibusterismo,” may be classed among those few
books that have changed the course of history. Whatever their merits as
literature, it is beyond doubt that they created the spirit of nationalism
and revolution among an entire people.
9Q| Rizal’s only important rival in fame and influence was Marcelo H,
* " ■ del Pilar, a writer perhaps just as powerful as Rizal. Fiery, aggres-
sive, politically experienced, del Pilar was compelled to leave the country.
Sunk in destitution, embittered by exile, del Pilar dedicated himself to
masterful attacks on reactionary Spaniards. It is, however, a significant
tribute to Spain that, like Rizal and del Pilar, the Filipihp reformers di-
rected or engaged in their campaign against Spanish abuses in Spain
itself, where the liberal elements of the metropolis lent them respectful
attention and positive help.
292 Indeed when the Filipinos in Spain founded the Spanish-Filipino Association to fight for reforms, several Spaniards Joined them. The leaders of
the group were Rizal, del Pilar, Mariano Ponce, Galicano Apacible, the Lunas, and others. According to Antonio Luna, the aim of the association
was to make the Filipino a free man.


7Q3 The organ of the reformers was “La Solidaridad,” a fortnightly
*established in Barcelona in 1888 by Graciano Lopez-Jaena. After-
ward del Pilar bought the newspaper and transferred its seat of publica-
tion to Madrid, the capital. The v “Soli” was banned in the Philippines but.
like Rizal’s novels, it was smuggled through the censorship and influenced
the minds of thousands.
OQA Rizal himself decided to return to the Philippines in 1892. He knew
~"■ the risk he was taking; his novels had gained him the hatred of
reactionary Spaniards who would rejoice to find him once again in their
power. Undaunted Rizal spent a short stay in Hongkong before taking a
boat to Manila in drafting the constitution of a new association, for reforms.
#iQr Rizal’s faith in Spanish justice was perhaps strengthened by the seeming success of previous agitation for reforms. In 1893 the Maura laws had
been passed, effecting wise and liberal changes in the municipal governments of the Philippines, which gave the Filipinos a greater share in the
administration. But the reforms were, as usual, too little and too late.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 25
296 rea * *° Rizal upon his return gave the Filipinos still weightier reason to doubt the sincerity of those reforms which the nation’s
foremost champion had always advocated as the only alternative to armed force. Using as a pretext the new association, “La Liga Filipina,” which
Rizal had founded upon his return, the reactionary Spaniards had him exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao. There Rizal continued to weave his dreams of
peaceful progress while practising his profession as a physician with such eminent skill that his fame crossed the boundaries of the Philiuoines
297 But m ° re ruthles ! * nd a*f cssive leaders were already rising in Rizal’s place. The difference between them and the great reformer was the dif-
ference between his idealistic “Liga” and its platform of mutual assistance and their new secret organization, the Most High and Most Venerable
Association of the Sons of the Nation, popularly known as the “Katipunan.” Organized in July 1892 in a house on Calle Azcarraga in Manila the “Kati-
punan,” as its name indicated, sought a mass base among the proletariat in the capital and the peasantry in the provinces rather than among Rizal’s
elite and bourgeois. And its aim was no longer reform but independence.
EVENING NEWS


AQO The fate of the “Liga” had taught the conspirators a hard lesson. Secrecy shrouded every activity of the “Katipunan”; total discipline was
"its greatest strength. Candidates for membership swore a solemn oath, signed in their own blood, to support the aims of the society, its
secrets, implicitly obey its laws, and assist any of its members who were in danger. 1
<9QQ The founder of the “Katipunan” was Andres Bonifacio. Born poor
in Tondo on the 30th of November 1863, Bonifacio went to work
from boyhood. But he devoted his spare hours to reading. His favorite sub-
ject was the French Revolution which in the end inspired him to found
the “Katipunan.” the historical vehicle of the Filipino Revolution.
*AA Bonifacio's right-hand man was Emilio Jacinto who, poor like his
friend, was able to support himself through school. This brilliant
student at the University of Santo Tomas devised the “Katipunan” code,
established its printing press, and became so valuable to the work of the
organization that in it he was second only to the leader.
PHILIPPINE SAGA


The “Katipunan” avoided any premature test of strength by con-
■ centrating first on organization and expansion. By 1894 it had
enrolled a large membership, including even some women. It had a
regularly elected president, secretary, treasurer, and fiscal. Local com-
mittees ran the association in the various districts of Manila and in the
provinces.
OAA Father Gil lost no time after hearing Patino’s story. He decided to
investigate the matter personally and on that same evening he in-
stituted a search in the offices of the Diario de Manila, a printing estab-
lishment. After a half hour’s search he found a lithographic stone used
by the “Katipunan” in its work as well as receipt-stubs of the association.
The “Katipunan’s” hand was forced however by the government’s
unexpected discovery of its existence. On August 19, 1896 Teodoro
Patino, a member, revealed the secret to his sister, a convent-school girl
in Mandaluyong. The frightened girl and a nun who was also present
advised Patino to tell Father Gil, then parish priest of Tondo, home of
the “Katipunan”.
The friar rushed to announce his discovery to the governor-general
■ who at that time was Ramon Blanco, a kind and just man known
as a liberal. Blanco seemed to be the only Spaniard who did not lose his
head upon hearing the news of the vast conspiracy. While his outraged and
distraught compatriots clamored for a blood bath, Blanco kept his counsel.


9AC But even Blanco could not restrain the fear-sharpened fury of the
Spanish reactionaries. A reign of terror broke out in Manila and
every Filipino, whether actually connected with the association or not,
feared that he would be in the next batch of arrests.
Rizal himself was the most tragic victim of the Spanish panic. His
****" name had been used by the “Katipunan” and his enemies availed
themselves of the opportunity to consummate their revenge. He was thrown
into Fort Santiago despite his protestations of innocence.
3H7 Ironicall y enough Rizal had left Dapitan to serve as a surgeon with the Spanish forces in Cuba. Blanco had accepted his humanitarian offer and
everything had been arranged for Rizal’s new assignment. But Blanco was relieved on the 13th of December 1896 by Camilo de Polavieja and Ri-
zal’s fate was sealed. Under the cruel and vindictive Polavieja, Rizal was given a mock trial and sentenced to death. He spent his last days putting his
concerns in order. To his people, he left a noble poem of farewell, a testament in verse. To the woman he loved, he gave his name in marriage. Then,
early in the morning of the 30th.of December, having returned to the Catholic Church and received its sacraments, he gave his soul to God. He was
executed by musketry on the Luneta, the greatest of the Filipinos.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 26
The Revolution was born shortly before the death of the hopes for peaceful Reform embodied in Rizal. His hand forced by the unexpected dis-
covery of the Katipunan, Bonifacio rallied his men at Balinta\vak and with the cry of “Long live the Philippine Republic!” began, on the 30th of
August 1896, this nation’s 50-year struggle for independence.
In the widespread fighting that followed a new leader arose in Ca-
vite, which became the stronghold of the Revolution. This was the
27-year-old mayor of Cavite Viejo, Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy, whose
bravery and military skill gradually overshadowed the turbulent democratic
spirit of Bonifacio. Aguinaldo had received the benefits of formal schooling.
After studying in his native town, he had enrolled in the Colegio de San
Juan de Letran.
N° enterprise demands unchallenged leadership and unity more
than a revolution-and either Aguinaldo or Bonifacio had to make
way. After a series of quarrels and disputed elections, the military head
gained supremacy. The founder of the Katipunan was condemned to death
by a court martial and, although his sentence was commuted by Agui-
naldo, was later killed with his brother under circumstances that have not
yet been fully explained.


Ml The contemporary photographs on these pages help to recapture the spirit and atmosphere of the campaign of ’96, possibly the last of the old
■ ■ colonial wars in the 19th century style. From left above are one of the flags of the Katipunan, whose eight-rayed sun, representing the original
eight provinces of the Revolution, has survived in the present Philippine flag; a primitive “lantaka” or small cannon used by the Filipinos; and an
undershirt worn as an “anting-anting” by one of the soldiers of the Revolution.
While the campaign was largely one of movement, both sides knew how to build and use entrenchments. Above left is a Spanish trench in Dala-
hican facing Noveleta showing a battery of bronze 9 cm. cannon. Above right is a Filipino trench in Naic which covered the approaches to a
strategic river.
The bridge of Zapote shown above was the scene of one of the most famous encounters in the history of that time. In the beginning the forces of
the Revolution, while never outfought, were badly handicapped by lack of weapons apd organization. The reenforced Spanish £roops gradually
pushed back the Filipino fighters from the environs of Manila intp Cavite.


Governor-General Polavieja fought his big campaign in Cavite where, after three months of hard and bitter fighting, he reestablished Spanish
~ sovereignty and scattered the forces of Aguinaldo. The photographs on this page show the main reason for the Filipino defeat: superior Spanish
armament such as the battery of 14 cm. cannon above shown bombarding Cavite Viejo.-
31 C Another proof of the handicaps under which the Filipino fought is the photograph above of Spanish batteries in Dalahican. A 15 cm. mortar
has just fired against the Filipino positions on Noveleta bridge.
31A Hos P ital facilities, such as the aid station shown above, were still another advantage which the well-organized Spanish army enjoyed. The Filipi
nos had to depend on the patriotic enthusiasm of the civilian population.


A.*- From the lost battlefields of his native Cavite Aguinaldo led his forces to new headquarters at Biak-na-bato, of which two views are shown above.
41/ Xhe more distant view of the encampment shows part of the Filipino forces drawn up in the clearing. The close-up shows Aguinaldo’s residence,
known as the Casa Presidencia, where a Republic was proclaimed on the Ist of November 1897.
Both sides were feeling the strain of the conflict, however; Spain, because of the Cuban rebellion, and the Filipinos, because of their inadequate
~ ■ O armament. A new Spanish governor-general, Primo de Rivera, chose this time to launch a pacification campaign. First he proclaimed an amnesty.
Then he commissioned a distinguished Filipino, Pedro Paterno, to negotiate with the leaders of the Revolution. The result was the famed Pact of Biak-
na-bato, at whose conclusion the photograph above was taken, guaranteeing certain reforms and liberties.
Another of the terms of the Pact was the exile of the Revolution’s leaders to Hongkong. The photograph above left shows the train which they took
' to Sual. At the windows are, from left, Wenceslao Viniegras, Aguinaldo, Vito Belarmino, and Paterno. All along the route great crowds cheered
the leaders who, in turn, by contemporary accounts are said to have cheered also for peace, Spain, and “A Philippines Forever Spanish”. The photo-
graph above right shows the leave-taking at Sual where the leaders boarded launches which took them to the steamship Uranus, Hongkong—bound.
Upon news of their safe arrival, the Revolution laid down its arms on the 31st of December 1897.


FIUPINe ART AND CULTURE DURING THE SPANISH PERIOD
BACKGROUND SOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PAST SO YEARS
Pagans and Mohaimmedansr As already indicated in Chapter B'of the-
“ Saga,” the art and culture of many of our pagan peoples in northern
Luzon, Mindoro, and Mindanao has remained practically unchanged from
times down to the present day. A number Of such peoples,
in fact, have changed but little in the past thousand years of more-
having been only slightly affected even by the pre-Spanish influx of
Hindus and Chinese.
The Moros on the other hand, have changed a great deal. The entry
of Islam occurred such a short/time before the Spanish arrival that the
accompanying culture traits had not yet become firmly established
among the masses. It was the bitter struggle between Mohammedan and
Christian during the late 15th and early 16th centuries that led to a re-
surgence and continued growth of a purely Moro art and culture during
the subsequent centuries. This new art differed in many particulars
from the pre-Spanish culture, and is deserving of a special section in
our present review.
The Christian. Filipinos: In the case of the lowland and coastal
peoples, however, the story is quite different. They were not only
greatly changed through their many centuries of pre-Spanish contact
and trade with their neighbors on the Asiatic mainland, but reacted
quickly to the new Spanish culture as well.
Pre-Spanish Survivals: The Chinese and Hindus especially, and
the more cultured peoples of Indo-China, brought in a constant stream
of new influences that produced notable changes in Filipino life—in the
late pre-Spanish period. The descriptions of native costumes, houses,
boats, weapons, images, and ornamental objects, that have been fur-
nished us by the early Spanish writers amply confirm this statement.
Notably, Pigafetta, Loarca, Plasencia, Chirino, Morga, and Francisco
Deza —all writing in the 16th or early 17th centuries—give us a series
of fairly clear pictures of lowland Filipino culture and arts at the dawn of
Spanish and Christian influence, Deza furthermore furnishes a number of
crude but informative sketches of the actual people and dwellings l of Negros
and Panay in the early 17th century.
New Culture from Spanish America: Although the spread of Spanish
religious and political influence was rapid, the entry of other types of
cultural influence and art was a much slower or more gradual process
—being retarded both by the small number of Spanish arrivals and the
infrequency of communication, with their homeland. In fact, it was from
Spanish America—and not from Spain itself—that the really penetrating
early influences came. For example the typical costumes of the Chris-
tian provinces that we now often speak of as “Filipino dress" were in
common use in Central America and Mexico long before they reached
these shores.
The penetration of Spanish-American culture in Philippine social
arts is equally outstanding. While barrio life still retains some real
native dances and music, Filipino town life in the 18th and 19th centuries
drew the great majority of its music, dancing, social graces, and even
of its games and amusements, from Mexican and Centred American
sources. And even today, if one wishes to hear any truly Malayan or
Indonesian music he has to seek it among the pagans, the Moros, or in
the less sophisticated lowland barrios.
The Blending Gives Rise To Something New: However, the dictum
often voiced by foreign critics, that Filipino art and culture are purely
imitative and not creative, is actually not justified by the facts. What
seems to have happened is that out of the blending of native with im-
ported Oriental and Occidental elements, a new and distinctively Fili-
pino art and culture is slowly emerging.
The speed and degree of this emergence varies greatly in the differ-
ent art and culture elements. In some cases it began even in pre-Spanish
times —when, for example, we see a “Philippine” stepped adze, and a
“Luzon” ridged adze, emerging already in the New Stone Age—and
new types of Hindu-Malayan art emerging in Pan&y and Cebu following
the periods of Sri-Vishaya and Madjapahit contacts. (The Panayan art
differs definitely from anything that is found in Java, Sumatra, or Indo-
China—and has its own distinctive and highly developed characteristics.)
In other cases the emergence has been much slower, and in some
fields has not become noticeable until recent decades. But in the wide
intermediate field many stages of growth are discernible; and we may
now consider them separately under the different phases in which art
and culture manifests itself.
The following eight subjects will be very briefly discussed in the
order indicated: (1) Clothing and ornament; (2) Architecture; (3)
Decorative art and design, In general; (4) Music and dancing; (5) Drama;
(6) Literature; (7) Representative art ( drawing, painting, and sculpture);
to be followed by a short discussion of (8) Moro art and culture.
It should further be kept in mind that the discussion is limited to
the Spanish period—the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, especially—and
that developments during the present century are either omitted or men-
tioned only incidentally.
(1) CLOTHING AND ORNAMENT
Costumes: The pre-Spanish costume styles gradually died out in
the Filipino towns before the end of the 17th century—although they
persisted in the barrios and among the country people until much later
dates.
Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, Filipino town cos-
tumes closely followed those of Mexico, Central America, and parts of
the West Indies —as has already been indicated above. After the sever-
ance of relations with Mexico about 1820, the true later Filipino cos-
tume began to evolve—reaching its best known form in the latter half
of the 19th century (see illustrations). The use of starched pina and
the finer forms of sinamay and jusi brought a delicate perfection to the
later productions that has few rivals elsewhere.
The 16th and 17th century costumes were chiefly an interesting
mixture of Mohammedan and Chinese with native elements. Spanish-
American clothing began to replace the earlier garb about 1680, but did
not become fully dominant until the early 18th century. The baro for
the men and panuelo and saya for the women came in at this time. The
old sarong or tapis was worn on top of the new saya—an interesting
assertion of native pride.
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 27
Embroidery and applique were the chief forms of ornament on
clothing.
Jewelry: With the advent of Christianity many pre-Spanish neck-
laces Were transformed into rosaries—and the addition of a cross or
scapulary soon followed. The old necklaces with their delicate filigree
work are said to have been made chiefly by women—and the fame of
“Manila gold-work” reached even to the distant marts of Sumatra and
Malacca.
As Spanish influence increased, the styles of the ear-rings, pins,
brooches, lockets, and the like, became more Europeanized—but they still
retained; a considerable measure of the original native art. Thin gold
work set with seed pearls, or alternated with red coral, became a great
favorite—and many fine pieces found their way through the galleon
trade to Spanish America and even to Europe,
The old jeweled daggers and other weapons formerly carried by the
men were banned under the new culture, and were gradually replaced
by carved or decorated canes and payong; while an embroidered and
decorated fan became essential for the well-dressed lady. Large Spanish-
style combs were worn chiefly by the meistiza class; but the smaller and
more commonly used native combs took on new styles and beauty of
decoration.
Footgear remained largely of native or Chinese styles, and was
worn chiefly in the towns—but headwear underwent some radical changes.
For the women, sun-hats and rain-hats were chiefly for country use, and
churchly requirements were with a kerchief; but among the
men the old-style putong or head-band gradually disappeared, and a hat
became essential in the town as well as in the country. In the barrios
the salakot still remained the favorite, but in the towns European style
headgear ran the same gamut here as in Western lands. The top-hat,
the bowler, and the derby all had their day—until the straw-hat finally
came into permanent style. In 19th century Luzon, the fine-quality
productions of Lufcban, Baliuag, and .Calasiao developed into a first-
class industry—equalling if not outdoing the Panama hats of the Western
world. The finely woven cigarette cases and purses of rattan, sabotan,
and bamboo also became famed abroad and acquired a wide distribution.
(2) ARCHITECTURE
Under this heading we may consider houtee and boat types, vehicles,
and furniture—as well as such structures as monuments, arches, or-
namental stairways, etc.
In the matter of dwellings and public buildings, pre-Spanish struc-
tures in the Philippines appear to have been all of wood or bamboo—as
no ruins of more durable creations have come down to us. But the
Spaniards were builders in stone and mortar, and within a few genera-
tions they- had literally covered the lowland provinces with a remark-
able series of churches, fortresses, walled towns, monuments, watch-
towers, and other public structures —moat of which endure to the present
time.
While the motive force and planning behind all of this building was
chiefly Spanish, the actual labor was native Filipino and Chinese —and
these workmen managed to incorporate some interesting elements from
native and Chinese architecture into the finished structures. It is only
possible to illustrate here a few selected examples of such buildings, but
several volumes could easily be written upon the subject. One fact that
immediately strikes the observer is the great variety in type and design.
Scarcely any two churches are alike—and some of them contain a great
variety of architectural styles within the same structure. For example
the fine church-tower at Morong (Rizal Province) has Greek and Roman
motifs combined with Maya, Zapotec, and something that seems purely
Chinese; while many of the churches along the Ilocos coast, in the
Cagayan Valley, and in Panay Island present remarkable combinations
of unusual or striking architectural ideas. The fortresses and walled
towns are massive and durable structures, with excellent artistic qualities
as well—and it is only the recent age of aircraft and high explosives
that has destroyed their utility. The neglect and ruin that some of
them have been allowed to fall into is a sad commentary on the quality
of modem life—and those that are still left should be respected and
protected by present-day Filipinos as one of the greatest treasures out
of their historic past.
House and Boat Types: As one travels from north to south through
the Philippines an impression is gained of a great variety in native
dwellings, and in the means of local land and water transportation.
Again only a few typical examples of houses, boats, and vehicles can be
shown in our illustrations—but the .subject is really worthy of much
more extended study than anyone has given to it in the past.
Here we see much that is purely native and Philippine; and, aside
f k on certaii of the more sophisticated vehicle types, foreign influence
is at a minimum. Some of the larger dwellings show very interesting
combinations of Filipino, Chinese, and Spanish traits; but the more num-
erous smaller structures are almost purely native, or at least Malayan.
(See the strong kinship of some of the dwellings with those found in
Celebes and Borneo.)
Most of the boat types are purely Philippine or Malayan, but a few
show strong Chinese influence (as, for example, the casco and other
similar river and coastwise craft). In the extreme north and south of
the Philippines, well-made plank-built boats are found —but in most of
the Archipelago the basic type is a real or modified dugout. The long
Agusan River cance and the Tagalog parao have especially fine lines
and much artistry is often exhibited in their shaping. It is in the More
vinta and sapit, however, that the finest carving and decorative effects
are achieved—while the largest craft and mest elaborately painted de-
signs are found among the houseboats of the Badjaos (the wandering
“Sea Gypsies” of the Celebes and Sulu Seas). In sailing craft, the Moros
again excell—both in speed &nd in beauty of line and design; but some
Bisayan areas provide a close second.
Furniture and Equipment: The carving and inlaying of tables,
chairs, cabinets, wooden chests, and other similar objects is another
art in which Filipinos have produced notably excellent work—particularly
during the 17th and 18th centuries. Carved images, altars., and other
ornamental woodwork for the churches and better private homes often
reached a high degree of perfection.


In native pottery a wide variety of design and decoration is notable
—and the special type that I have named “Manila Ware” (produced at
the San Pedro Makati kilns from the late 16th to the early 19th centuries)
deserves a place by itself. Artistically carved' clay pipes of this mate-
rial were produced not only at Makati but were developed in the Ilocos
provinces, Abra, Bohol, and Antique as well.
Elaborate water-vessels, flower-pots, and glazed tile ornaments for
stairways, balconies, and balustrades, were manufactured in some areas
—most of them showing decided Chinese influence.
(3) DECORATIVE ART AND DESIGN IN GENERAL
The designs in Philippine decorative art all show strong traces of
Indian and Chinese influence mixed with a considerable native element
of Indonesian and Malayan origin. There are also important elements
of European and Spanish-American origin—especially manifest in the
finer arts and in decorative designs of a religious or political character.
Native art outcrops most strongly in the ornamental or the economic and
utilitarian fieldsi—as has been indicated in the previous discussion
When we come to the social and mental arts, we will find that
Western influence has penetrated very deeply—and the Japanese dis-
covered to their sorrow (as I had already predicted in 1921) that Filipino
psychology is now more Western than Oriental.
However, I cannot agree with those Filipino artists—and there are
a considerable number of them—who hold that the native element is
essentially “primitive,” and that only those artists who follow Western
ideas and methods reach the highest plane of their profession.
Art manifests itself in many ways; but, if it be real art, it is always
an artist’s attempt at expressing some beauty or ideal which he sees—
or of which he dreams. In the art of the past many fine ideas have
been circumscribed or hidden by the conventionalized designs that the
period demanded —and often, now, only a few privileged individuals can
interpret them. One of the greatest contributions of the modern, era of
freedom has been the release of the artist from the conventions of the
past—and the age of “realistic art” has certainly given the creative
genius a much wider and more appreciative audience.
Every different environment breeds a new type of individual. And
it is not believable that the ideals and dreams of a typical Filipino will
be quite the same as those of one who has grown up in another and per-
haps very different land. It should be obvious that the greatest con-
tribution a Filipino artist can make to world civilization is precisely the
putting into graphic and appreciable form of those special ideals and
dreams that his native environment has given him. No one else can do
this as well, if at all.
This is not to say that a Filipino artist may not successfully inter-
pret American or European scenes and life in a new way—just as
Vollbehr, Kulesk, and other European artists have given a new and at-
tractive twist to Philippine life and scenes—but in both cases it is the
new approach that makes success.
Furthermore, art is no respecter of mediums, and the lowly wood-
carver, the smith, or the potter, with an artistic soul, may turn out pro-
ductions that command the respect and appreciation of beauty-lovers
everywhere—irrespective of race or creed. The early Filipino artist who
1690 years ago carved the horse’s head, shown in “Saga” illustration
No. 106, from a Novaliches potsherd, made a real contribution to world
art—and is as worthy of our respect, if not in the same degree, as the
20th century artist who so capably drew the pictures numbered 6, 13,
and 36. In other words, art is art—in whatever form it may appear.
(4) MUSIC AND DANCING 7
A proper history of Philippine music and dancing has yet to be
written; but to those who wish to delve deeper into the subject, I re-
commend the accounts . of Philippine music and musical instruments
written for Vol. IV of Zoilo M. Galang’s “Encyclopedia of the Philippines”
by the late Prof. Francisco Santiago and Justice Norberto Romualdez
(Manila, 1935); and for dancing, the recent volume by Mrs. Francisca
Reyes Tolentino entitled “Philippine National Dances” (New York, 1946).
Older -works by Mallat, Walls y Merino, Retana, Bahas, and the late
Epifanio de los Santos also contain much useful and basic information;
while in 1933 Prof. Jeno von Takacs conducted special and informative
studies concerning the music of the Philippine Negritos and the pagans
of Northern Luzon. My own collection of source material contains
several hundreds of manuscripts recording local music and dancing from
nearly every Philippine province—and could be used as the basis for a
comprehensive history of the subject, if some capable worker were willing
to undertake such a task.
It is impossible to include here more than a few generalized re
marks, touching upon certain phases of the subject.
Musical Instruments: A great variety of simple musical instruments
of bamboo, wood, and metal had already been developed in the Philip-
pines in pre-Spanish times —and most of them are still to be found in
use among the pagans, the Moros, or in the Christian barrios. Instru-
ments of percussion, wind instruments, and stringed instruments are
all to be found. Among the former, many varieties of drums both of
hollow wood and with skin heads occur—together with bronze gongs,
large kettle-drums, xylophones, bamboo clappers, etc., while small jingle
bells were formerly frequently attached to clothing (and still are among
the Mindanao pagans and Lanao Moros). Wind and stringed instruments
were mostly of bamboo and local resonant woods—until European-made
metal pieces began to be imported in the 19th century. Among stringed
instruments, the simple bamboo harp and a rather primitive guitar with
only 2 or 3 strings apparently go back to pre-Spanish times'—but the
violin was not widespread until the early 18th century. Of other native-
made instruments the bamboo jew’s-harp and flute are the most wide-
spread^—the former being intimately associated with courtship in the
barrios. The long Moio guitar known as kudyapi came in from the
south at a very early date, reaching even to Luzon, and was. very popular
until replaced by imported instrument types. Other early stringed
instruments were of Chinese or Japanese origin—as was also the bamboo
pan-pipe of widespread use in Northern Luzon.
Filipinos of all groups, and types have a natural talent for instru-
mental music, and quickly learned to use every variety of imported
instrument. However, the quality of the music played on such
instruments nearly always has a decided European or American cast.
Vocal Music; Filipino folksongs and ritualistic or ceremonial songs
are very ancient; and, while rather simple from the standpoint of music
notation, have many striking and interesting qualities* The old religious
daeng, bald, and baltong of the northern Luzon pagans, the daniu and
dal-lot of the Ilokcs, the warlike tagumpay and kumintang of the central
Philippines, and the wargpngs and religious chants of Mindanao and the
Sulu Islands, all have fascinating qualities of their own. Much of this
is real pre-Spanish Malayan music—but hitie of it is heard in the larger
lowland towns today.
Spanish influence first manifested itself in the religious music and
the singing of the Pasion—but was later extended, among the'Christians,
to much of the popular music as well. The palimos or begging songs,
new work-songs and lullabies, songs connected with various games and
amusements, and lastly but not least, the kundiman or lovesongs, all
bear a strong Spanish or Spanish-American imprint. The kundiman,
however, furnish an interesting example of something new arising from
the mixture of Spanish and native culture. It gradually became ty-
pically Filipino—“going deep into their hearts and best expressing their
emotions,” as Prof. Santiago says—and possesses a sad but attractive
plaintiveness that is quite distinct from anything in North American and
European music of similar type.
Dancing: The older nafve dances were decidedly mimetic in type,
and were always rather serious—joyousness or pleasure being seldom or
never expressed. Spanish influence brought in a quite different psy-
chology, in which, active rythmic movement and open expression of
pleasure or emotion were characteristic. The fandango, cucuracha,
balitao, carinosa, and surtido (especially popular in the Visayan region)
are all certainly derived from Spanish or Spanish-American proto-types.
On the other hand, during this period, many distinctive Filipino
dances grew 7 out of the culture mixture in many partsvof the Islands—
as Mrs. Tolentino has so ably shown in her excellent collection and
analysis of known dances of all lowland types. Many examples might
be cited if space were available —but the tinikling dance (originating in
Leyte Province) may be especially cited as differing from any known
elsewhere. At the end of the Spanish period most of these dances w r ere
still actively practiced—but they have now largely fallen into disuse due
to the modern jaizz era.
Bands and Orchestras: The earliest and most primitive type of
mass playing was the beating of sticks and bamboo clappers, or warriors
beating a tattoo on their shields—in early’ war dances and funeral celebra-
tions. Massed drums and gongs were also often used in communal
dancing. However, the first organized! orchestra—combining several
classes of instruments —was of the type of the Javanese gamelan. Simple
gamelans were introduced into Sulu and Mindanao, and probably also into
the Manila Bay region, during the time of Madjapahit in the 14th
century—and they still survive in the southern islands. Various types
of agong, kulintangan, and xylophones form the mass of the instruments
used —but wind and stringed instruments are also found*
The Spanish-American type of band spread into the Philippine
provinces early in the 18th century—and in many places bamboo bands
or simplified native-made instruments were used in place of the ex-
pensive imported ones. Even a pipe-organ was constructed of bamboo,
at Las Pinas, in 181 S. s
During the 1870 e, musical organizations began to be formed in
Manila and elsewhere, and-modem-type orchestras soon came into being.
Musical education was on a fairly high plane during the late Spanish
regime; but it was not until the American period that a full-sized sym-
phony orchestra was bom. The churches took a leading -part in
the development of choir and orchestral music—and the organ and harp
were first introduced by them. The first Church orchestra is said to
have been organized in 1870 under the leadership of Marcelo Donay,
Filipino composer. In addition to Donay, Ladislao Bonus, Jose Canseco,
Antonio Garcia, Juan Nakpil, Hipolito Rivera, and others, produced in-
teresting compositions during the late Spanish period.
(5) DRAMA
For a history of the theater in the Philippines, see works by Barran-
tes, Retana, Riggs, Bahas, Castillo, and others.
One of the earliest types of native drama in the Spanish period was
certainly the mom-mere, after which came the oomedia, and in 19th
century the zarzuela. The largest class of dramatic productions, how-
ever, were the religious plays—the performance of which began early
in the 17th century and continued down until the end of the Spanish
regime.
A majority of the religious plays w 7 ere written by friars Or priests
—but a great many (especially in .the dialects) were also produced by
devout Filipinos. Most of them are motivated by religious propaganda,
and many were fanatic in their zeal for the faith. A few attained to 3
rather high order of dramatic art. In any case, throughout the Spanish
period, religious plays, ceremonies, and processions bulked very large in
Filipino community life—and constituted the greatest source of mass
entertainment.
The moro-imoro plays—usually depicting gory scenes in the age-
long wars between Christian and Moor—were also chiefly for mass
amusement; and were rather looked down upon by the more educated
Filipinos. Some were very lengthy, and constituted a source of popular
entertainment for days at a time.
The zarzuelas of the late Spanish period were attempts at serious
drama mixed with light opera—and a number of them were quite
creditable productions. Some of the best Filipino composers and dra-
matic writers collaborated in such works —and their popularity extended
well into the early American period.
The Visayan and Bikol languages contain the largest number of
dramatic productions in the vernacular, Tagalog and Pampangan coming*
next; while the least number are found in Iloko and the other language
of Northern Luzon.
(6) LITERARY ART
The chief forms of literature —folktales, poetry, and pros©—can be
considered only very briefly here. (For further literary data, see the works
of E. de los Santos, Dean Fansler, T. del Castillo, E. G. Gonzaga, L. Y.
Yabes, J. T. Burgos, Sol Gwekoh, etc.)
Folklore and Popular Literature: In this field the Philippines rank
high. India, Persia, Ireland, Russia, China, and Japan have always been
noted for the quantity and variety of their popular tales —but in some
ways the Philippines exceed all these lands in variety of verbal lore.
It might be better to say that we have elements from all of the countries


mentioned, plus a background of Indonesian and Malayan tales of still
earlier types.
The myths and ritual of the pagan groups constitute a class by
themselves —and their epics will be discussed later under “Poetry.” Moro
folklore is richest in Indian, Persian, and Arabian elements on a basic
foundation of Malayan and early Indonesian survivals. In the Christian
provinces, however, we have a gradually fading background of similar
material overlain with thick layers of Asiatic, European, and Spanish-
American origin.
The earliest important overlayer shows strong Buddhist character-
istics, and doubtless came to us from India and China in pre-Spanish
times. Our numerous Philippine fables and animals stories largely be-
long to this type
However, in the case of the magic tales —which form one of the
largest elements in Philippine folklore—we have a triple origin. This
type of tale grew up chiefly in Persia and Arabia, and spread eastward
to India and westward across North Africa to Spain in the early cen-
turies of Islamic expansion. The oldest group of such stories appear to
have entered Malaysia and the Philippines from India along with Sri-
Vishayan influence—although the early Sabaean Arab trade may have
also played a part. The second and purest group came with the entry
of the Mohammedan faith; while the third and probably largest group
came to us second or third hand through Spain and Spanish America.
The late Dr. Dean S. Fansler made a special study of these stories, and
found that it was possible—although sometimes difficult—to classify
most Philippine magic tales into one or the other of the above groups.
Finally we have a large group of religious or semi-religious stories
(miracle-tales, and stories about saints, sacred events, holy places, etc.),
in which Spanish and Spanish-American influence is most pronounced.
Even here, however, there is often now a strong native element. Some-
times pre-tSpanish tales are re-told with Christian names and events
mixed in; or sometimes local incidents or happenings are introduced into
the imported tales. In generations of re-telling, Filipino psychology
has more and more asserted itself.
Poetry and Verse: Epic and narrative poetry, lyrics, and medieval
romances done in verse may he considered very briefly.
True epic poetry is today found chiefly among the pagan
and the Mores; but fragments of pre-Spanish epics have been recovered'*
among the Christian Hokes, Bikols, and Leyte Visayans. The Ifugao
hudhud and alim, some lengthy tales among the Igorote and Tinggians
of lepanto sue! Atora, the Suit Moio Parang Sabil, for example, are
true epics. So also is the Iloko Biag ni Lam-ang—although some modi-
fications have crept in, in early Spanish days. Fr. Castaiio recorded an
important fragment of a true pre-Spanish Bikol epic; while Miss Eulalia
Brillo has recovered some highly interest'ng epic fragments from eastern
Leyte. Some versions of the Christian Pasion may be regarded as re-
ligious epics. The oldest is in the Iloko language.
Lyric poetry of all qualities, from very good to bad, is found in
every Philippine province; and most of it is highly romantic in character.
Some of the best collections have been made from the Visayan Islands,
especially from Samar and Leyte—where Indian influence of the Tagore
type is very pronounced. On the whole, however, lyric poetry in the
vernacular—during the Spanish period—presents a mixture of native
and Spanish influences; while Filipino poetry written, in Spanish is more
definitely European in type.
The most extensive class of printed literature written by Filipinos
in Spanish times (except religious writings) is the group of medieval
romances, in verse, commonly known as corridos or awit. Several hundred
such romances reached printed form in various Philippine dialects during
the 19th century. They all show a strong European influence, and some
are merely translations of Spanish romances. Others, however, are
purely local productions by writers who (although using European set-
tings and names) knew only Philippine scenes and characters. The most
acclaimed- of the corridos is “Florante at Laura,” written about 1837 by
Francisco Baltazar y Balagtas, a native of Bataan Province. This work
has been put into a class by itself, by modem Tagalog critics—who have
placed all sorts of strange interpretations upon the author’s language,
which may or may not have foundation in fact. In any case it is a
beautiful piece of narrative verse, and a credit to Filipino literary art;
and has been translated into both Spanish and English during the Ameri-
can period.
Several other corridos were deservedly popular during the later
Spanish period—the most widely read being ‘‘Principe Igmidio,” of which
the late Juan Martinez once told me, more than half a million copies had
been printed and sold v
Prose Literature: Aside from religious and linguistic works—of
which a great number were written and printed in the dialects —very
little prose literature appeared during the Spanish period in anything
except the Spanish language. Most of what did appear was utilitarian—
such as textbooks, books of home medicine and health, law books, com-
mercial and agricultural books, and the like. Only a mere handful of
novels, books of essays, etc., appeared during the last two or three de-
cades of the Spanish regime.
Of prose literature in Spanish a vast amount appeared, and of great
variety—as one may discover by consulting any good Philippine biblio-
graphy—but only a small proportion of it was written by Filip‘nos.
Some Filipino writings (such as Rizal’s novels, etc.) were printed in
foreign lands, and denied entry into the Islands. However, a good many
copies were smuggled in. The reai period of Filipino secular prose writ-
ing beigan with the American regime.
(7) THE REPRESENTATIVE ARTS
(Usually Known As “The Fine Arts”)
Sculpture, drawing, and .painting were not well developed among
Filipinos during the Spanish period—except as applied to religious sub-
jects.
Some of the sculptures and paintings made by Filipinos for the
churches, and for religious shrines in private homes-, have real artistic
merit—although the great majority are of crude or ordinary quality.
Some fin© pieces were carved or painted by unknown artiste—and only a
few worthy names have come down to us.
In architecture and sculpture, the beautiful St. Ignatius Church—one
of the greatest attractions in the Walled City prior to the war—was
built and carved in the 1870 s by Felix Roxas and Isabel© Tampingco.
Roxas also designed and built a number of other fine buildings and private
homes between 1870 and 1885, besides serving as director of public works
for the City-of Manila. Arcadio Arellano was another noted local architect
of the late Spanish regime. Although not a professional, the sculptures
and carvings of Dr. Jose Rizal have been justly acclaimed—and his bust
of the Ateneo pnofefcsor, 3Pr. Guerrico, is a work of real merit.
Painting: The two outstanding Filipino painters who made a name
for themselves in Europe during the late Spanish period' were of course
Juan Luna and Felix R. Hidalgo—both of whom produced work that
commanded the respect and praise of their contemporaries, and will
always be a credit to the Philippines as their land of nativity. However,
their work was almost wholly in European style, and they painted few
Philippine subjects or scenes. Fabian de la Rosa bridged the gap be-
tween the old and new—and ushered in the American period in which
the Amorsolos and others became bright and shining stars.
Other artists of the late Spanish period, however, did work that is
well worthy of mention. Rafael Enriquez, Jose Ma. Asuncion, Miguel
Zaragosa, Lorenzo Guerrero, Lorenzo Rocha, and Felipe Roxas all pro-
duced a number of excellent paintings and portraits—many of which
were of purely Philippine subjects. Still earlier painters, whose work
was chiefly in the religious field or in portraits were Jose, Antonio, and
Hilarion Asuncion, Antonio Malantic, and Damian Domingo. Although
their work seems rather flat and lifeless to modem realistic artists, it
had its own artistic characteristics and quality of expression.
Drawing, Engraving, and Other Forms of Representation; Many
Filipinos have shown special aptitude at drawing, engraving, fine pen-
manship, and other similar forms of artistic expression. Melecio Fi-
gueroa engraved some excellent medals in the last third of the 19th cen-
tury —while many good drawings of native life and scenes were made
by unknown Filipino artists for Spanish periodicals such as “La Eus-
tracion Filipina” and others.
From Tomas Pinpin down, Filininos were the chief craftsmen in both
Spanish and native printing establishments. Even in the 17th and 18th
centuries, many books were not only printed but illustrated by them; and
the fine 18th century copper-plate engravings by Nicolas Cruz de Bagay
and others are superior pieces of workmanship.
In the late Spanish period, some excellent satiric and humorous draw-
ings were the work of Filipinos—although such drawings reached their
peak of artistic merit in the early American period, with the appearance
of such illustrated periodicals as “Lipang Kalahaw”, etc.
Fine penmanship was characteristic, throughout most of the Spanish
period, and the 18th and 19th century work of some professional Filipino
scribes is equal to that produced in any other country.
The photographic art, so important today, was still rather primitive
at the end of the Spanish regime; but some interesting photographic re-
cords of the 1890 s have come down to us.
(8.) MORO AND PAGAN ART DURING THE SPANISH PERIOD.
As indicated at the beginning of this Chapter, Moro Art developed
some interesting new phases during the centuries of Spanish domination
in the central and northern Philippines—hut the art of the pagan peoples
was affected very little, except in some areas of intimate contact.
Some of the special phases of Lanao Moro art and design were dis-
cussed in 1933 in a senes of articles by A. V. H. Hartendorp in the
“Philippine Magazine” (and some selected illustrations from those Arti-
cles appear on the last page of the present chapter). Other excellent
examples of Moro and pagan art appeared at a still earlier period in the
old “Philippine Craftsman.”
As Mr. Hartendorp has pointed out, there is great originality in
the Lsnao decorative art—not only in the elaborately carved houses,
boats, musical instruments, etc., but also in their textiles, jewelry, wea-
pons, and many other articles. And, while exhibiting some kinship with
Mohammedan art elsewhere, many of these designs appear to be purely
local developments during the past two or three centuries.
While Lanao ranks high in this respect, it is not the only Philippine
MorP area to exhibit such originality. In Cotabato,' Basilan, and Sulu,
new phases of Moro art have some into being during the Spanish period
in the Philippines. Metal working and weapons were highly developed
in Cotabato, textiles and body ornament in Basilan; while in Sulu, carv-
ing and sculpture and a variety of other arts reached a high state of
perfection. Beautifully illuminated manuscripts in Arabic script still
existed in the 19th century, both in Sulu and Cotabato, but were mostly
destroyed by the various wars during the past 60 years. Finely sculptured
sftone tombs still exist in S r butu Island.
Mixed cultures: While there has been but little Christian and Moro
mixture, in some special areas Christian and pagan (or Mohammedan
and pagan) culture have become blended in curious ways. In northern
Luzon, both in Abra and in parts of the Cagayan valley, some strange
Christian-pagan culture mixtures occur; while in Mindanao, Christian-
pagan mixture is notable in Bukidnon, and Moro-pagan mixture in Davao,
parts of Cotabato, and the Zamboanga Peninsula. (See illustrations.)
CONCLUSION
Despite the strong penetration of European and Spanish-American
culture traits in the central and northern Philippines, and the penetra-
tion of Mohammedan and Indo-Malayan culture traits into Mindanao
and Sulu, there has been considerable growth of a. true Filipino art and
culture during the more than three centuries of Spanish contact. This
new culture presented features of difference, both from that of pre-
Spanish times and from the imported elements. The degree of new
culture development, however, manifested itself much more strongly in
some arts than in others, and uniformity of progress has still to be
attained.
The general effect of the American period has been to abolish past
restraints, and to give greater freedom of independent development in
all art and culture phases. With the dawn of complete political free-
dom, we should see still further “Filipinization” along these lines. We
should be ever on guard, however, against the most serious defect of
nationalism —the tendency to regard everything native as good, and
everything foreign as bad. Such a policy can lead only to deterioration,
and should be constantly curbed.
The growth of the true Filipino culture of today has resulted from
a blending of the best elements that have come to us from both Eastern
and Western lands—and it is only by maintaining and holding fast to
that culture balance that we can reach our true destiny and remain a
distinctive and permanently visible spot in world culture and civilization.

PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 29
4|5 T ke feudal civilization described in the two preceding chapters, so richly and variously compounded of Asian, European, and American elements,
had a brief reprieve after the uneasy truce of Biak-na-Bato. Outwardly Filipinos and Spaniards slipped back into the old customs but at bottom
neither had much faith in each other’s pledges. In his exile in Hongkong Aguinaldo cashed a Spanish draft of 400,000 pesos and set aside the money to
finance another uprising if the Spaniards faded to institute the promised reforms which already the forces of reaction were denying or obstructing in
Manila,
Aguinaldo’s patriotic abnegation and political vision, however, were
” not shared by all his companions in exile, whom he had organized
into a junta. One of them demanded a share of the Spanish payment as
back-pay for his service in the defunct insurgent government. To avoid
court action, Aguinaldo thereupon left for Singapore where he would be
outside the jurisdiction of the Hongkong courts.
41T 14 WaS at sinfirapore tha * history caught up again with Aguinaldo.
War seemed imminent between the United States and Spain and the
American consul there, in his desire to gain a powerful ally for his country
in the event of hostilities, gave the Filipino leader an unauthorized as-
surance that the United States would support Philippine independence if
Aguinaldo returned to renew the revolution.
EYIMINO HEWi


410 Meantime the internal situation in the Philippines Was becoming as propitious for a new uprising as the international crisis. Discontent spread
■ ■” once more as the Spaniards failed to fulfill the pact of Biak-na-Bato. In April 1898 about six thousand Filipinos suddenly attacked the Spanish
forces in Cebu,
41Q In the same fateful month the Spanish-American war was declared. Conscious of her weakness, Spain had desperately tried to avoid the conflict.
* ■ ' But a demand from President William McKinley, shown above with his cabinet, for the withdrawal of Spain from Cuba proved impossible to
accept. Upon the outbreak of hostilities the United States immediately made preparations to throw the Spaniards out of Cuba. But the first battle of the
war was not to be fought there but in Manila bay. The pictures and tables on the opposite page describe the opposing forces in that historic engagement
which was to affect the destiny of the Filipinos so decisively.

420 FCW naVal battle f have been as decisive as Dewey’s victory over Montojo. The remarkable engagement during which the Americans calmly anni-
hilated the Spaniards without the loss of a single man set the pace for the entire war. It made American superiority unquestionable and, from
the Ist of May 1898, it was clear that Spain would lose the war.
421 only the bmninff hulks of the Spanish fleet left of any hostile forces in Manila bay the victorious Dewey could afford to land in style
1 in the Spanish naval base at Cavite. The Photographs above show him going for a ride as well as the wreckage of the ships he sank. Dewey’s
squadron, however, ruled only the waves. Manila itself was well fortified and the American bluejackets did not feel strong enough to attack and take it.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 30
497 Completely isolated by Dewey’s naval victory and without hope of reinforcements, the Spaniards belatedly tried to turn the Filipinos from active
enemies to allies. Once again reforms were promised and even partially instituted; fervent appeals were made to the Filipinos’ religious and
cultural loyalties; but it was already too late. The Spanish overtures were rejected.
Aguinaldo returned in time to resume leadership of the Filipinos at
this juncture. He had hurried back to Hongkong but had missed
Dewey there. So, after settling the back-pay claim out of court for 10,000
pesos he invested the remainder of the Spanish draft in arms and am-
munition and proceeded to Manila where Dewey awaited him.
A*%A To the American admiral, forced to remain idly at anchor within
sight of the enemy capital because of the lack of an army, Agui-
naldo was a godsend. He temporized on the Filipino demand for con-
firmation of the Singapore consul’s pledge while encouraging Aguinaldo
to muster a new army against the Spaniards.


Unused to diplomatic evasion and ambiguity, Aguinaldo remained confident that the Americans would support Philippine independence and prompt-
ly set out to win it from Spain. He quickly organized a revolutionary force and proclaimed himself dictator, promising a constitution once the
entire country was freed.
4JI Dewey rave Aguinaldo only 62 captured Spanish rifles hat the Filipinos, using the arms aid ammunition chiefly taken from Spaniards in dlf-
fevent places, quickly captured control of Luzon and surrounded Manila. This overwhelming success encouraged Aguinaldo to organize a revolu-
tionary covorament on the 23rd id June in a proclamation that amounted to a declaration of independence.


A*Vn Practically the only sizeable Spanish force left in the Philippines was the garrison of about 15.000 in Manila, a typical unit of which, the Sra
" Company, Casino Corps, Spanish Volunteers, is shown above. The Governor-General and Captain-General (commander-in-chief) was Don Basiliu
Augustin, shown above, who was succeeded by Don Fermin Jaudenes.
AJO Conquerors of the Spanish army were the 10,000 Filipinos under Aguinaldo, who in one month had taken control of Luzon and laid down the siege
of Manila. Dewey would have been helpless without them and they saved the Americans the trouble of fighting their own war with Spain in the
Philippines. But the revolutionary army, one of those units in the siege of Manila is shown above together with Dictator-President Aguinaldo, was fight-
ing not for America but for the new Filipino nation.
A* IQ When the American expeditionary force arrived, the campaign had already been finished by the Filipinos. Only Manila remained. For U-
' an army of 10,000 was shipped to the Philippines under the over-all command of Major General Wesley Merritt, No. 2 man in the Unit-
Army, shown above with a typical unit, the Ist Colorado Infantry, United States Volunteers.


Merritt found, however, that he could not even approach his objective. Manila was completely surrounded by Aguinaldo’s trenches. With the
pretext that the formidable guns mounted on the city walls shown above could be silenced only by American artillery, he tricked Aguinaldo into
yielding part of his lines to the Americans, some of whom, showm above, quickly took advantage of their opportunity to ride close to the walls for an
inspection.
A 3 1 The Spanish position was hopeless and Jaudenes, through the Belgian consul, intimated to the Americans that he would put up only a token re-
■ sistance if the Filipinos were kept out of the city. The Americans kept their part of this bargain, which cheated the Filipinos of their single-
handed conquest of Luzon, for when the Americans finally attacked Manila on the 13th of August they detailed their rearguard to keep the Filipinos
out. The pictures above show units of the Colorado regiment moving along the beach and through grass toward Manila.
The main advance was along the shores of Manila bay and it met almost no resistance. The Americans, like the Nebraska regiment shown above,
marched in formation, so little was the danger. Indeed the sporadic clashes between Filipinos and Americans, harbingers of future full-scale
conflict, were a greater threat to Merritt’s plans. An open encounter was avoided only because of Aguinaldo’s forbearance.

CHAPIER 31
433 Amii 3 the uncertainty that followed the fail of Manila and the Spanish-American armistice, the Filipinos hastened to organise an indep ndent
government which might secure recognition at the peace conference. The photo above shows troops of the Republic drawn up in front of the
church of Barasoain near Maioios, Eulacan, awaiting the arrival of President Aguinaldo on the 15th of September 1898.
4341 The contem P° rar y Photo above shows the arrival of Aguinaldo who had left behind in Manila an explosive situation of increasing tension with
the Americans in order to open the Congress at Barasoain. The Congress was designed to be not only the architect of the Republic but also an
open demonstration of the Filipino aspirations and capacities for independence.
435 That thC ffr6at masses of the Fili P inos truly desired independence was proved by their enthusiastic approval of such a patriotic speeches as that
delivered by Felipe Buencamino. Photo above shows the crowd that listened to his address. Considering the difficulties of communication and the
comparative isolation of Barasoain, the size of the crowd, while not comparable with those that have gathered on similar occasions in our days, was
extraordinary for those times.
EVENING NEWS


The Congress was opened by Aguinaldo amid a solemn simplicity, shown by photo above. There were eighty-five delegates, among them the ablest
*¥<3o i ea ders of the Filipinos. A foreign observer said of these men: “They conducted themselves with great decorum and showed a knowledge of debate
and parliamentary law that wuuld not compare unfavorably with other parliaments”.
Constitution of the Philippines was Congress’ first serious task.
" Two parties developed in the discussions of the draft which were to
continue in substantially the same form throughout the short life of the
Republic. One party was led by Apolinario Mabini, Aguinaldo’s closest
adviser, who is credited with having drafted the young dictator’s orders
and manifestoes. He offered Congress a draft of his own for the
Constitution.
A rival draft was submitted by Pedro Alejandre-Patemo, the peace-
maker of Biak-na-Bato, who was chosen president of the Congress.
Paterno, a polished and distinguished scion of wealth, had aspired to a
Spanish .patent of nobility; he was a great compromiser and was the nat-
ural counterfoil to Mabini, the strong-willed intransigent who had worked
his way through law school.


439 of the Constitution was the work of neither Mabini
nor Paterno but of Felipe Calderon who distilled the best provisions
of many Constitutions in Europe and America. The most bitterly debated
provision was the separation of Church and State; separation won by only
one vote which the chair cast to break a deadlock. The Constitution was a
model of the age.
AAt\ All classes of the population rallied to the Constitution, which was
" passed by Congress on the 29th of November, approved by the Pres-
ident on the 23rd of December, and promulgated on New Year’s Day 1899.
Even the modest Filipino woman pledged her open support, foremost
among them Aguinaldo’s wife shown above an horseback.
Republic depended not so much on Congress and the Constitution as on its generals and diplomats. Before the President could
even approve the Constitution, the news was received that Spain had sold the Filipinos to America in Paris while in Manila itself daily friction
between Filipino and American troops boded ill for the future. More and more it became apparent that independence rested on the shoulders of the
young men of arms shown above, the generals of the Republic.


A A o } While preparing for war, the Filipinos at the same time exhausted
" the peaceful methods of diplomacy. Felipe Agoncillo was the Re-
public’s envoy to Paris where he unsuccessfully tried to plead the cause of
Philippine independence before the peace commission. “The Filipinos,” he
warned, “will not permit themselves or their homes to be bought and sold
like merchandise.”
Another Philippine envoy was Mariano Ponce who was sent to Japan
to negotiate Japanese support for Philippine independence. The
Japanese showed interest in the situation but their own international
troubles prevented them from doing much. They allowed the shipment of
arms and a few military advisers. Philippine diplomacy, untrained and un-
supported, accomplished little.
AAA The treaty of Paris, a facsimile of which is shown above left, spelled the doom of Philippine independence. With the payment of 20 million dollars
by the United States in settlement of Spanish claims, shown in photo above right, the Spaniards ceded what they no longer had to the Americans.
The transfer of sovereignty was purely theoretical on both sides: the Filipinos had already recaptured their o,wn sovereignty from the Spaniards and
would defend it to the bitter end against the Americans. Thus the Paris treaty of the 10th of December 1898 marked the end of peace in the Philippines
even as it signalled the beginning of peace for Spain and the United States. War between Filipinos and Americans was now only a matter of time—less
than two months.


AAfL Even while the Filipinos hastened to build their Republic in peace
in Malolos, war closed in upon them in Manila where a new' Amer-
ican commander-in-ehief. Major General Elwell S. Otis, disturbed by the
Filipino forces stationed in the suburbs of the capital, sent Aguinaldo a
demand on the Bth of September that “if your troops are not withdrawn
beyond the line of city defenses, within one week, I will force you to move
and my government shall hold you responsible.”
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 32
The Filipinos, already smarting under the terms of the Spanish
capitulation which had denied them entrance into Manila proper,
were angered by this new demand to evacuate even the suburbs. A minor
clash resulted and Aguinaldo gave orders to stand fast. General Pio del
Pilar fortified Paco and Pandacan. His lines in Pandacan were just across
the river from Malacahan and from his quarters Otis could see for himself
the evidence of Filipino defiance.
AAI But General Cailles,. Filipino commander in the south, reported that his soldiers had no bullets, no supplies. Aguinaldo therefore was compelled to
send a commission to Otis to negotiate. When the American commander agreed to change his “demand” to a “request,” the Filipinos agreed to
withdraw and they marched out in style while the Americans presented arms. But General del Pilar remained in Paco and Pandacan which had not
been included in the terms of the Spanish capitulation.


AAQ Friction between the two armies continued despite the partial eva-
cuation. An extended controversy developed as to the boundaries
of the city of Manila and in this tense atmosphere the Americans re-
mained on the alert, like the Utah volunteer battery shown above.
Otis had asked for reenforcements in expectation of trouble and
■ ■ ' the arrival of new detachments on the 6th of December, shortly
before the treaty of Paris, raised his strength to 22,312 officers and men,
some of whom are shown above manning guns in Malate.
The Filipino forces also kept themselves in readiness for any eventuality. The soldiers, such as those shown above, were ill-armed and ill-
equipped but they were filled with patriotic enthusiasm and could count on the support of the population.
AC* In this equivocal situation incidents were bound to develop. The
■ most serious occurred when General Thomas H. Anderson, Amer-
ican commander in the south, was arrested at a Filipino outpost, such as
that above, and stopped from proceeding on an inspection trip. At another
point of contact, an American sentry shot a Filipino captain.
AtL 0 } The actual can temporary photograph of an outpost incident shown
above illustrates the small beginnings of the war. But the isolated
outpost disputes could not lead to outright hostilities until the treaty of
Paris and the refusal of the Americans to recognize Philippine independ-
ence made war inevitable.


yIM On the night of the 4th of February 1899 Private Willie Grayson of Negraska regiment stood guard on San Juan bridge. His orders were to “allow
no insurgent to enter the vicinity.” Shortly before 8 p.m. Grayson and two other men advanced on patrol into the village ahead. They saw four
armed men appear in front of them. Grayson yelled “Halt!” The Filipino answered with his own “Alto!” Grayson shot him. Then another American called
Miller shot a second Filipino and Grayson killed a third. General firing developed thereafter. The Filipino-American war had begun.
/[C4 The Battle of Manila developed on two fronts. It started in the northern sector under General Arthur MacArthur to which fighting was confined
** on the 4th. Hostilities had broken out by accident; neither side was prepared; and the engagement was confused. With superior fire-power, how-
ever, as displayed in the contemporary picture above, the Americans were able to repel the scattered Filipino attacks and to take the offensive them-
selves, driving the Filipino forces out of the line of old Spanish blockhouses and taking the waterworks at San Juan and La Loma hill.


JFP In Anderson’s southern sector, held for the Filipinos by del Pilar, action did not start until the morning of the sth when the Americans drove
into Pandacan, Santa Ana, and Paco. The photograph above shows the fighting at Paco where only 100 Filipinos, entrenched in the church, held
the Americans at bay for one afternoon and were not dislodged until the church had been destroyed and most of the house in the district burnt. The
Americans afterward claimed that they had lost only 59 killed and 278 wounded in the entire battle.
# Although Otis believed that the situation in the southern sector was under American control, on the north side of the city the line was much
longer. The photograph above shows fighting: in the town of Caloocan, which contained an important maintenance plant for the railroad. Although
MacArthur’s division advanced its left flank, stubborn resistance from the Filipinos, as evidenced by the photograph on the right of a dead insurgent,
slowed them down. The war had only begun; it would last much longer than Otis or any American expected.


AjT"* The commanding general of the American forces was Major Gen-
eral Elwell S. Otis, a 61-year-old lawyer with a gallant Civil War
record who relieved Merritt shortly before the outbreak of hostilities. Con-
scientious and meticulous to the extreme, Otis was afterward severely
criticized because his alleged over-caution and inability to delegate author-
ity upset the American time-table for the occupation of the Philippines,
delaying It beyond all expectations.
PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 33
M No man could have been a more complete contrast with Otis than
his antagonist, the fierce impetuous General Antonio Luna, the
Republic’s minister of war, to whom Aguinaldo yielded the supreme com-
mand of the army on the field. Like his brother, the classic painter Juan
Luna, General Luna had studied and agitated in Europe. Noted for his
blazing courage and uncontrollable temper, the Ilocano fencing-master
was one of the leaders of the war party.
«PA Luna immediately took the offensive. Anticipating the strategy of the “fifth column” toy half a century, he ordered the revolutionary organization
inside Manila to start fires and in the ensuing confusion to fall upon the Americans in coordination with an advance from the Filipino lines out-
side the city. This bold plan failed because the Americans captured a copy of the instructions. But even with all their precautions, they came very ©lose
to defeat when huge fires razed Santa Cruz, Tondo, and Binondo, while 500 Filipinos under Luna’s aide, Major Francisco Roman, slashed their way into
the city. The force entrenched itself in Tondo and fought to the death. The photographs above show (top) the ruins of Tondo after the battle and (be-
low) other views of the destruction wrought


General Arthur MacArthur
A# A The Republic lost the initiative after the failure of Homan’s gallant sortie. Thereafter the Americans took the offensive and never again relin-
■fQl# quished it. North of Manila the zone commander. General Arthur MacArthur (above, right), set Malolos, the Republic’s capital, as his first objec-
tive. But MacArthur was after more than just a town. He planned to outflank Luna and to surround and capture the entire army of the Republic. The
map (above, left) summarizes all the campaigns north of Manila in the first stage of the war before the rainy season enforced a temporary lull.
AZ 1 The battles of Manila and Caloocan led the American commanders
■ to . believe that the Filipino soldier, one of whom is shown above as
pictured by a contemporary American artist, was no match for the Amer-
ican in open warfare. This was due to the unfamiliarity of the Filipino
with the use of the rifle and other modern weapons of war; the Filipino
was used to fighting With his bolo; at close quarters and with naked steel,
he was unequalled; but he was neither trained nor equipped for modern
war.
But the Filipinos had a powerful ally in nature. The Americans soon
found that their carefully prepared plans had not taken jungle and
rain into consideration. There were no roads and the outflanking column,
shown above crossing the Tuliahan river, was delayed by difficulties of
transportation. It failed to surround Luna’s army. MacArthur was forced
to content himself with a slow advance northward toward Malolos against
an elusive enemy that anticipated the modern “defense in depth.”


Forced to yield ground, Luna Issued orders to use ‘"scorched earth” tactics. When MacArthur took Malolos, the town was in flames. The content-
porary photograph pictures the Republican capital as the Americans found it. They entered without opposition after a 25-minute artillery barrage.
Colonel Frederick Funston, one of the first to advance into the town, found the convent occupied by Aguinaido as a residence In flames. There were
about a dozen snipers.
At%A tis ordered MacArthur to stop at Malolos and the American troops engaged in the characteristic past-times of armies everywhere; the contem-
porary American sketches above show them ‘liberating” such souvenirs as Aguinaldo’s mirror and bed. MacArthur afterward proceed toward San
Fernando. Another column led by Major General Henry W. Lawton, the campaign’s outstanding leader, simultaneously smashed through Bulacan and
Nueva Ecija (see map, opposite page) toward the new capital at San Isidro. .After taking it, Lawton was ordered by Otis to return. Circling the Candaba
swamp, he made contact with MacArthur’s forces at Arayat. The cautious Otis thereupon abandoned all the conquered territory north of a line between
San Fernando and Baliuag, which he held during the ensuing rainy season.


Meantime the American zone south of Manila had also witnessed considerable activity under Anderson and Brigadier General Lloyd Wheaton
HOD (above left). The American advances however had few tangible results because Otis always ordered his field commanders to return after a success-
ful “tour.” The first of these was conducted by Wheaton who opened the river down to Pasig. A second amphibious attack was led by the dashing Lawion
who crossed the Laguna de Bay at Santa Cruz.
mg g The overland campaigns were much more strenuous due to the usual difficulties of communication. A two-pronged attack designed to trap Pio
HOO del Pilar in the Morong peninsula failed to encircle the Filipino general. The photograph above pictures a short engagement in the hills near
Pasig. Lawton also handled the first thrust toward Cavite. Although once again the flanking American movement failed to encircle the Filipinos at
las Pinas, Lawton advanced steadily, although with considerable opposition, especially at Zapote bridge. Otis’ caution, however, enabled the armies of
the Republic under General Trias to reform and a second Cavite campaign had to be undertaken by Brigadier General Theodore Schwann. Thus ended
the first stage of the Filipino-American war. Dewey had estimated that only 5,000 Americans would be needed. By the start of the rainy season in 1899,
there were 34,661 troops in the Philippines and Congress was being forced to raise more reenforcements which raised Otis’ strength to 56,000 by March 1900.

CHAPTER 34
Aif So rapid and irresistible was the American advance in the north that, toward the end of the first stage of the campaign, the Republic sued for a
i 15-day armistice. The Americans refused to grant it but allowed a commission headed by Colonel Arguelles to enter Manila for negotiations. Ar-
guelles, who is shown in the contemporary drawing above meeting General MacArthur, gave such a convincing report of American strength that Mabini’s
war cabinet fell in San Isidro and a new peace cabinet was formed under Paterno,
£LMjQ Luna bitterly opposed the change of policy. When the new cabinet sent a second commission to Manila, he intercepted it at Cabanatuan, arrested
Delegates Buencamino and Arguelles, and sent his own men to confer with Otis, The negotiations were fruitless. But Luna had shown his hand
and, to forestall a coup d’etat on his part, he was assassinated in Cabanatuan. Aguinaldo resumed command of the Republican army and immediately
launched a full-scale attack against San Fernando. The thrust was repelled.


ALQ Meantime, at the end of the rains, Otis was preparing for the second stage of the American campaign. His strategy called for an advance by Mac-
* Arthur which was to be coordinated with a gigantic flanking movement by Lawton in the east and a landing under Wheaton at Lingayen in
order to trap Hie entire army of the Republic (see map on last page). Lawton, shown above with his staff watching the effect of American artillery,
carried the brunt of the offensive.
The Republican forces fathered themselves for a last desperate effort as Otis’ grand plan went into operation. As the contemporary photographs
*' " and drawings above show, the Filipinos built huge man-traps, wrecked transport trains, and took every possible advantage of natural fortifica-
tions in river, swamp, and jungle. But American equipment and organization kept the offensive going at a steady pace.


ATj “I When Lawton’s hard-driving column neared northern Luzon, Wheaton’s unit effected its scheduled landing in Pangasinan, catching the Re-
■* * publican army in the rear. The photographs above show American gunboats bombarding San Fabian preparatory to the landing and an American
Gatling gun on the beach. It seemed that Aguinaldo ’vas doomed.
477 Bu * inexplicably Wheaton failed to move from San Fabian. Riding hard with his sick wife and a small bodyguard, Aguinaldo managed to slip
" through the American encirclement at Pozorrubio which Lawton’s cavalry entered only a few hours after the Republican President had left.
Wheaton’s inactivity thus allowed Aguinaldo to escape. But the mass of the Republican forces was trapped.


SECOND STAGE
OF THE
PHILIPPINE CAMPAIGN
The map like the maps in the preceding chapter, was prepared exclusively for this series from official records. It details the American
& campaign in the Philippines for the first time in local chronicles, which have so far treated it in general terms. On the 23rd of November, after
the completion of the Mac Arthur-Lawton-Wheaton three-pronged offensive diagrammed above, MacArthur wired Otis: “The so-called Filipino Republic
is destroyed. The congress has dissolved. The President of the so-called Republic is a fugitive as are all his cabinet officers, except one who is in our
hands. The army itself as an organization has disappeared.” But, before flight, Aguinaldo and his generals had agreed to switch to guerrilla tactics.
MacArthur did not know it but the third and hardest stage of the campaign had only just begun. Far from being destroyed, the Republic had only gone
underground and its armies, which had “disappeared” before Mac Arthur’s eyes, would return, fighting with the arms and the tactics suited to then-
genius and necessities, to plague the victorious American generals and kin the greatest of them all, the dashing Lawton.


PHILIPPINE SAGA
CHAPTER 35
474 Tli e battle of Tirad Pass was probably the last field encounter between the Filipinos and the Americans. Riding hard after Aguinaldo, a bat-
talion under Major March had been pulled up at the pass by the Presidential Guard under 22-year-old General Gregorio del Pilar. The fight
was long and bitter; it ended only when the Americans outflanked the Filipino barricade and annihilated the Guard. By modern standards it was not
much more than a skirmish. But for the Filipinos it will always be surrounded with the halo of a national tragedy for here, at a rocky barricade
thrown across a lonely trail, the First Republic, fighting at the end with sticks and stones, was finally laid low. No more appealing symbol for that
short-lived Republic, embodiment of a people’s unspoiled hopes and brave illusions, can be found than the young commander of the guard who rode
his white horse with quixotic gallantry under enemy fire to die for a cause already lost.
475 Del Pilar,s stand saved Aguinaldo, who had been resting at Cervantes, 15 miles from Tirad Pass. Thereafter the Americans lost contact with
® the fugitive President and the war entered its third and last stage of guerrilla warfare. The Filipinos kept up an underground government and
army throughout Luzon that had the Americans chasing up and down the island with greater losses than ever before (see contemporary drawing
above). So effective was the guerrilla warfare that American casualties ware doubled and the strength of the army of occupation had to be raised to 70,000.
Lawton himself was killed by guerrillas near San Mateo.


A"J £ To cope with guerrilla activity, the Americans had organized “Scout” units composed of Filipinos, mostly Macabebes, former members ot the Span-
” ish army. Their organization is largely credited to Lieutenant Matthew Batson, shown above left with some of his men. It was the Macabebes who,
under General Frederick Funston, shown above right, captured Aguinaldo in March 1901 and thus put an end to the guerrilla stage of the campaign.
Afl*l Aguinaldo fell through treachery and deceit. One of his couriers was betrayed by a pro-American mayor. On his person the Americans found
* coded instructions to Baldomero Aguinaldo to send a force of 400 men to the President’s hideout in Palawan. After a Spaniard had helped to break
the cipher, Funston disguised 80 Tagalog-speaking Macabebes as soldiers of the Republic. The force was taken aboard the “Vicksburg” to Casiguran and
thence marched overland to Palanan. The Macabebes, greeted formally by the Presidential Guard, opened fire on them without warning while they
were presenting arms. Aguinaldo was then caught by the Spanish spy.


Aguinaldo was installed by MacArthur in a spacious house near Malacahan. The contemporary photograph above shows him with aides on a piaz-
za in the palace. After studying the situation Aguinaldo was convinced that further resistance was futile and he issued a peace proclamation.
“Enough of blood, enough of tears and desolation,” he said in part. Within a comparatively short time almost every Filipino leader of importance on
Luzon surrendered. The war was over. American sovereignty was supreme.
470 Even while hostilities were going on, and precisely in an effort to cut them short, the Americans had announced a program of civil rights and
" and liberties for the Filipinos. In 1899 the First Philippine Commission, shown in top photograph above, had issued a proclamation on the aims
of the United States in the Philippines. A Second Philippine Commission, whose members are shown in the bottom photographs above (from left, Wright,
Moses, Taft, Ide, and Worcester), initiated civil government and a notable experiment in colonial administration and democratic indoctrination.


AOf\ Acting under the historic “Instructions” of President William McKinley, the Commission, and later the first Civil Governor, William H. Taft,
fostered the growth of those democratic institutions, which indeed had inspired the First Republic from the start. Local officials were chosen
from among the Filipinos; men like the town mayor pictured taking his oath of office in the contemporary drawing above, assured a mass base for
democracy.
AQ I Positions of the highest responsibility were also opened to Filipinos; Filipinos became members of the Commission, the legislative organ, and of
■ the Supreme Court, the highest judicial organ. The first Filipino Justices are shorvn above taking their oath of office. But Filipino nationalism
had never died; men whose wisdom, patriotism, and integrity were unquestioned were branded collaborators for accepting office under the Americans.
It was not until the passage of many years that these early collaborators were vindicated and honored as prophets who foresaw that Filipino national -
ism would draw strength from the new institutions and that Filipinos and Americans, lately such irreconcilable enemies, would grow to become fast
friends and loyal allies in the pursuit of their common ideals. THE END
