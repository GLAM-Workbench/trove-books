Hill?a cute little chap who roamed
through the bush, and sought out the home Iwr -J)
of the Pee-wee and Thrush. pJ

Bill?the song-birds and talkers who came %? A ",
at his will; for wherever he went they
would make a great noise, as if they were j
S : saying ?He?s one of the boys! |
Every day he would rise at the first
glimpse of sun, and wander away from the

Mummy would ?coo-ee? in (right, but his

father would answer, ?He come-it, all
right!? ?

Then Budgeree Bill would peep round
a tree, and laugh loud and long in his

innocent glee. ?Oh, bad pfeller you!? his
mother would say, ?the Bunyip he come
and he catch?em some day!?
The Bunyip! It worried the little chap
so that more of this monster he wanted to
know; and, seizing her chance, his Mummy
would tell of the ugly black thing that lived
near a well; how it came when the children
the gunyah forsook, and earned them off
to wild Koopernook!
But Budgeree Bill was not worried so
much; he?d heard that already from Jackie **

pottered about through the day, a hiss at j(|j|
his side?and the Snake showed the way.

?Tm afraid that some day we may hear
some bad news, and I fear that our boy we

do, so that Budgeree Bill shall be safe in
his home or to wander at will?
Said the Laughing Jackass: ?Let us

hover between scrub and sky may guard
overhead; and, down on the ground, some \

Then the cunning brute, maddened,

and dell.

slime from his nostrils the top log was

In a mass rose the Brumbies, the Wal-

the weight on his back, and fell with his
rider across the bush track.
Along came the pals of the boy who
had crashed, expecting to find him well
crippled and smashed; but smiling he rose

BUDGEREE DREAMS
ASLEEP in the gunyah lay Budgeree
Bill?the country about him was silent and
still; the soft clouds were drifting in flecks
to the west, and the moon gently rose on
the fluffy waves? crest.
A strange thing, slow-moving, close
rested awhile, and o?er the boy?s features
there rippled a smile; then the vapory thing,
taking form of a guide, next beckoned to
Billy to follow outside. He turned in his
sleep, and then settled anew, as out of
his breast a weird boomerang flew, and,
catching it up, off the guide swept afar
to the place of the spirits?a flickering star.

Twas the real living Billy, the pride of his
folk, that was wafted away. Then his
Pilot thus spoke;?
?Come upward with me a new pleasure
to find; I?ll show you what happens to
those who are kind?to the children who
love all the things of the earth?the birds
and the beasts and all that have birth.?
The home of his friends who had long
passed away came clear into view with the

wattle was waving
like corn at the head,
and the flowers of the
gullies were strewn for
his bed. He drank of

the water that silver-like flowed, and walked
on soft mosses instead of hard road.
And wherever he turned all who saw
him seemed glad, and shouted their wel-
comes in songs to the lad. Here, too, were
the friends that his people had known, who
out of Bronze Hill to Goolgamba had
flown; tall warriors, too, who had fought
in their day, and the little black Aussies
who laughed care away.

of his people who long since had died
They walked to the top of a lofty blue

thrill; for there, on the plain which
stretched far and wide, spread the tribe

Budgeree Bill's Dream




Like an army they
moved, as do men to the

fray, or sported like hunts-
men, all happy and gay.
And the little ones fol-
lowed, and then, in long
rows, the Parrots, the Bronze-wings, the

Curlews and Crows, the Magpies, the

where he?d come from?too pretty for
words.

Ah,
Next the animals marched in formation

sublime, the paws of each rising in rhythm
and time; and, as they came close, the
columns stood still, their leaders all shout-

4 Look back o?er the years to an earlier
morn; ?way back to the time ere your Daddy
was born; for much that is good for a boy
you may learn; and you will be white when
next homeward you turn!? ?

Thus spoke the Big Chief of the brilliant
parade, as it moved in a mass to the love-
liest glade?to the edge of a lake, bright as
shimmering glass, where the boy from the
bushland watched history pass.
White wings on the ocean he saw
drawing near, and he looked on in wonder,
nor thinking of fear. He saw the black fig-
ures that stood by the shore, and watched
their defiance?their symbols of war. And
a big vessel sailed like a swan on the tide,
till a smaller one started away from its side.

Away rolled the
phantoms far over the
lake, as other new
pictures their places
would take. Came
On, on came the cutter with men at the oar
?dip-dipping and bringing them close to
the shore. Then the sun cleaved the cloud-
bank, and, in the bright light, Bill looked
at the strangers ?and saw they were white!
?Brave men were these, who had found
a new land; not enemies they, though a con-
quering band. We thought they were evil
?small reason we should. Not so, they
were helpers, and came for our good.?

vessels that labored, but landed their goods,
and men who camped close to the fringe of
the woods.
Then the Guide turned, and, pointing,
said, ?Read from that book?it tells in new
language how came Captain Cook!
TIME?S CHANGES
IN the lake were next pictured the build-
ing of towns; the ripening of wheat on the
uplands and downs; the sheep and the
cattle, the turning of mould; and adventur-
ous fellows ?mad rushes for gold; the bad
men who held up the few who pushed west
?the bushranging gang, the country?s first
pest; the pioneer tilling the soil farther out,
and the groans of the live stock that fell to

?Oh, Budgeree! look at the country
you own; you see how in pride and in
country established once more; the bound-
ing coach-horses that carried the mails; then
the snorting new engines that travelled on
rails; the creaking teams taking the wool to
the ships, and the products they brought
in return from such trips.


and there, spanning widely from north to
south ridge, was the work of a giant?the
wonderful bridge, which grew to the sound
of the great hammer-stroke; till Bill gasped
in wonder?and promptly awoke.
The sun had crept into the gunyah, and
Bill, loud-laughing, leapt up?for he?d had
a new thrill.


THE VAUDEVILLE SHOW
AT nightfall assembled the jolly bush
friends for a vaudeville show and the fun
that it lends. The programme, arranged
~lilr If
with due care and with skill, was what they
all promised would be a good bill. There
were songs by the Magpie, the Curlew, a
Drake, and many a chorus the bushland to
shake. The pick of the lot, and believe me

it?s true, was marked as a solo by Dad Kan-
garoo.
A Monkey, which strayed from a cir-
cus in town, would perform all the tricks of
Macguffin, the clown. And little Miss
Parrot, whose dress was so neat, was down
to recite ?The Good Friends We Meet!?
Some dances, of course ?all merry and
bright?were promised for those who should
turn up that night.
Well, the house was as full as the log-
, space would hold, when in walked the
chairman?the Thrush wise and old. Then,
vise ana oia. i nen,
idgeree Bill, he sig- , j
sy started to trill. V'

nailed the band, and they started to trill

up as the moon slowly rose, and gay was

?Miss Parrot,? they shouted; they

& clapped her as well, as the pretty Rosella
awoke from her spell; and, sending her voice

a , r t/ - w * -
far into the night, the little bird flapper be-
gan to recite: ?
We play about the river,
And we wander in the glade,
Where nature ?merry giver?
shade. Nv V
Sends the sunshine and the
And the happiest of minutes
That we pass in woodland sweet
Are with the pretty linnets
And the good friends that we meet.


The listeners flapped wings and shouted
for more, and even the Crow gave a hearty
?Caw! Caw-r!? Miss Parrot bowed low,
and then, drooping her eyes, moved grace-
fully off to a chorus of sighs.
The next to be called on was Dad Kan-
garoo, a witty old fellow, as all the rest
knew. ?I?ll sing you a song that you?ll find
is quite new; it tells how we settled the last
Jackeroo.? So, clearing his voice (it was


/ A J

husky at best), he sang them this song with
marsupial zest; ?
He was a funny little man;
One eye was made of glass;
. v i
He talked as every new chum can
About ?the beastly grass;?
\ ~ _ j ' <*** -J^
About the crops and droughts ?all that!
You?d really think he knew,
And had some sense beneath his hat,
This little Jackeroo!
One day he came to hunt us blokes;
He had a horse and gun,
He threatened he would give us soaks
Of lead to make us run!
We opped about a little bit,
The joke quite thrilled us through,
When Dodger gave the horse a hit,
And spilled the Jackeroo !
Then, as he struggled to his feet
(Perhaps more vexed than hurt),
We mauled him like a lump of meat
Among the dust and dirt.

The next on the list was to be the big

a dangerous dive that made their flesh
creep.
And this was the end of the vaudeville
show?"the greatest on earth,? said an
animal "pro.? To round off the night, for
here was a chance, the company danced
a corroboree dance.
Oh, strange was the scene in the beau-
tiful night, the full smiling moon and the
stars, oh, so bright! They danced as old
warriors had danced in their time, and
chanted in chorus some primitive rhyme.
In the midst of the fun came a terrible
thing, half man and half beast, it swept fast
to the ring. Its eyes were as flames that shot

out, was both slimy and red. On it came,

to explain, but the dancers all bolted to

Bunyip had captured poor Budgeree Bill! \'-fy s'^'
THE RESCUE

find no trace of the boy that each swore he ;
would mind; and his heart-broken Mummy,

who searched far and wide, lay awake all
the night in the gunyah and cried.
?Twas the Snake in his wisdom kept
coolest by far, and he straightway arranged
for a council of war. Unknown to the rest,
he?d explored the wild waste, and some
days before the Bunyip had traced; he
knew the short cut to where, in a cave, he
was sure the dread creature his chum
would now have.

?Now, what?s to
be done??
?Just

you, our little friend?s gone; and long ere the
sun gets up in the sky, we?ll fix this wild
Bunyip, or else may I die.?

Budgeree Bill's Return

Then away went the fighters far into
the night; in the wake of the leader they
turned left or right, and then straight along
for a mile or two sped, till he signalled he?d
sighted his quarry ahead. ?He wriggled his
tail as a warning to all to stay where they
were, unless he should call, and in the dim
light they could see when he stopped at a
queer-looking object, then, lightning-like,
popped. His shiny brown head seemed to
dart like a spear, and the crowd in the open
was stricken with fear, when the next mo-
ment, writhing, as if in sore pain, the Bun-
yip leaped upward and fell back again.
And then to the place the whole of
them sped, to find that a hideous brown
monster lay dead. One stroke from the


j-jr ' , i
Snake had performed a good task; and what
was the end ? Need anyone ask ?
Asleep in the cave was their well-
beloved friend, no danger now lurking?

his fears at an end. And Mummy still
waited! They saw her eyes fill, when
