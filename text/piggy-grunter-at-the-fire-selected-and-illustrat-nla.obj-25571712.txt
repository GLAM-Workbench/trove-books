PIGGY GRUNTER
AT THE FIRE
One afternoon, just as Piggy Crunter came in
from school, the Telephone bell rang. TR-R-R-R-INC!
Mrs. Crunter went to answer it, and presently
she called- Piggy! Piggy! Your Uncle James wants
to speak to you.
Piggy ran to the phone. His Uncle James was
the Chief of the local Fire Brigade, and he was
Pi99y s favourite uncle.
Hullo, Uncle James," said Piggy into the
telephone. And then his eyes grew bigger and
rounder as he listened.
Oh yes. Uncle James!" he said. "I'll come round
straight away. Thank you!" He rang up, and then
told his mother the exciting news. Uncle James
wants me to go down to the Fire Station straight

his mother.

I know, said Piggy. But Uncle James has my
present all ready and wants to give it to me, now!"
Very well, said Mrs. Crunter. Run along but
put on your pull-over, and remember, you mustn t
be late for your tea.
So Piggy put on his cap and his pull-over and
hurried down the road to the Fire Station.
A very big Fireman was sitting near the door,
and when he saw Piggy he said:
"Well, son, what do you want? No children
allowed in here, you know."
"My Uncle James sent for me," said Piggy, feeling
very important.
He's Mr. Rasher,
the Chief of the
Fire Brigade!"
"Is that so!"
said the Fireman.
"Just wait a

went inside and shouted up the stairs: A boy here
to see you. Chief. He says you re his Uncle.
Thats right, thats right," said Uncle James,
looking down over the banisters at the top of the
stairs. Come on up. Piggy. So Piggy went upstairs
to the Chiefs office, and Uncle James met him,
smiling from ear to ear.
Come in! Come in, my boy! Clad to see you!
Piggy began to smile, too, when he saw the big
cardboard box on his Uncles desk. A card was
tied to the box, and he could see his name on it-
PICCY GRUNTER.
Here s your birthday present. Piggy, my boy,
said Uncle James. Open it up and see how you like it.
Piggy untied the string and lifted the lid oft the
box, and saw a great deal of tissue paper. When
he unwrapped it. Piggy s eyes grew rounder than
ever, for there inside was a whole Fireman s uniform!
Jacket and trousers, boots and a broad leather
belt-and best of all —a beautiful shining Firemans
helmet!

Oh, Uncle James!” gasped Piggy.
Try it on—try it on, said Uncle James. I had it
made to order for you, but I had to guess the
size, and I wont guarantee the fit.


Pai(<‘ \in<‘
But when Piggy tried it on, jacket and trousers
and boots and belt and helmet, he found that
they all fitted perfectly.
What a marvellous present. Uncle James!” said
Piggy, as he looked at himself in the glass.
Thought you might like it,” said Uncle James.
T know how keen you are to be a Fireman
someday
Oh, yes!” said Piggy.
"Well, you can get used to the feel of the
uniform, and practise polishing your helmet!” said
Uncle James.
Just then there was a sound that made Piggy
jump. It was the Fire Alarm!
BR-A-LING-A-LING-A-LING!
Uncle James had no more time to think about
Piggy. He was buckling up his belt, and ramming
his helmet down more firmly on his head while
the alarm was still ringing, and then before Piggy

could say a word,
he was out of the
office and sliding
down the pole
to the ground
floor where the
Fire Engine was
waiting.
The other Fire-
men were follow-
ing him, one after
another and
suddenly Piggy made up his mind that he would
go too! He took one glance at the mirror—yes,
he looked exactly like a Fireman, although he was
rather small —but surely in the excitement no one
would notice that! He dashed out of the room and
slid down the pole and just managed to scramble
up on to the back of the Fire Engine as it
started off.
CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!
The Fire Engine went racing down the street.
Piggy had never been so excited in his life before.

Everywhere people were coming out of shops and
houses following the Fire Engine down the
street.
Where s the fire?' they asked. Where s the fire?
Piggy tried to peer over the shoulders of the
Firemen, but he wasn t tall enough, and he couldn t
see anything. But then they turned a corner and
suddenly a great cloud
of smoke and flames
burst into sight.
The Town Hall !
shouted Piggy. The
Town Halls on fire!
and on every side the
people in the crowd
shouted: The Town
Halls on fire!
It was the finest
building in the town,
with lots of windows
and a splendid tower

on top, with a clock that told the time for the
whole town. And now it was on tire! Smoke was
pouring from the windows and flames were darting
up the walls of the tower.
The Fire Engine pulled up and the Firemen
sprang off and set to work. Some dragged the big
hoses down and began to unroll them, others
unhooked the ladders, and others ran straight into
the building to see whether anyone was still inside.

Uncle James shouted orders, telling his men
what to do. Suddenly he caught sight of Piggy.
What are you doing here? he roared.
l-l-l-d don t know," stammered Piggy. Uncle James
glared at him. This is no place for a boy! he said
angrily. Piggy turned sadly away. But suddenly
Uncle James changed his mind.
'Well, now you re here you might as well make
yourself useful," he said. "Here-hold this!" and he
thrust the nozzle of a hose into Piggy’s hands.
"Keep it trained on the Town Hall, ready,” he said,
'until I give the order for the water to be turned on.”

"Yes, Chief! said Piggy, and his chest swelled out
with pride. He was a real Fireman at last, helping
to fight a real fire-and the biggest fire that had
ever been seen in the town!
There was such a big crowd in front of the
Town Hall that policemen had to tie ropes to the
lamp-posts to keep people back away from the
falling sparks.
Keep back! Keep back!' they shouted. And
• hen suddenly there was a wild cry from someone
in the crowd:
Look! Look! On
the Tower!"
Everyone looked
up. There, on the
little balcony that
ran round the Clock
Tower, just outside
the Lord Mayors
own private
room, a man

was standing —a man dressed in long robes, and
a cocked hat, and with a big gold chain round
his neck.
It's the Mayor! cried everyone. He s trapped!
He cant get down!”
Piggy looked up where everyone else was
looking. He saw the Mayors pale, frightened face,
and the flames leaping up towards the very place
where he stood.
His only chance is to jump, said one of the
Firemen, who had been inside the building. We
cant get to
the staircase

of the Tower are
nearly red-hot-we
couldn't go up to
him on ladders!

dered Uncle James, and six of the strongest Firemen
ran over near the Tower, with the blanket stretched
out ready to catch the Mayor when he jumped.
"Jump! shouted Uncle James. "Jump, Your
Worship!'
Jump! shouted the crowd. "Jump!
But the Mayor was afraid. He looked down and
saw the flames leaping up. The smoke was stinging
his eyes, and sparks were flying everywhere and
the blanket seemed too tar away. He shivered,
and crouched on the very edge of the balcony.
Jump! shouted Uncle James again. "It's your
only chance!
Jump!' shouted the crowd. Jump for your life!
Piggy s eyes were nearly popping out of his
head as he watched. The flames were higher and
higher round the Tower—he was sure the Mayor
would be burned to death.
Jump!'' shouted Uncle James again; Jump!

shrieked Piggy. And at that moment someone
turned on the tap that Piggy's hose was connected
with!


Kiithlrrn
The water gushed through the hose and jerked
it up in Piggy's hands. It was too strong tor him,
and before he could cry out to anyone to help
him, a great blast of water went shooting through
the air, straight at the Lord Mayor! It hit him
right in the middle of his waistcoat and lifted him
high into the air.
O-oh! shrieked the crowd.
O-oh!' gasped Piggy.
The Mayor went flying through the air and
then down down down right into the waiting
blanket! He
bounced a tew
times, but he
wasn't hurt a
scrap.
Thank good-
ness! gasped
Piggy.
Hurrah!"
shouted the
crowd.

Piggy clung
to his hose,
and wished
he could hide
somewhere.
People were
pointing at
him and say-
ing - There
he is! That s
the Fireman

Who pushed
the Mayor off
the Tower—There he is! and then
Why! they said— Its only a boy! and one
after another they took up the cry— He s only a
boy!" And presently a great big Fireman came
over to Piggy and took the hose from him.
The Chief wants to see you, he said.
Piggy was so frightened that his knees were
knocking together, and he could scarcely
creep across the street towards his Uncle, who
was standing with the Mayor, watching the Firemen

still at work. The fire was beginning to die down.
The Mayor might put me in prison!" thought
Piggy. Oh, dear! I wish I'd never thought of
coming on the Fire Engine!"
Just then the Mayor turned and saw him.
Is this the Fireman who pushed me off the
Tower?" he asked. And then he looked more
closely. Why! It's only a boy!
Piggy hung his head. He was afraid to look up
at his Uncle James face, but he heard his voice. It


P»i(<‘ Tnrnlr-onc
sounded very pleased! Piggy could scarcely
believe his ears.
Yes, Your Worship, Uncle James was saying
proudly. It is my nephew. Piggy Crunter.
My boy!' said the Mayor. Tm proud to take
your hand! You are the bravest boy I ve ever met.
You saved my life!
Piggy looked up and blinked. The Mayor was
beaming at him.
Yes, Piggy Crunter. You have saved the life of
your town's most important citizen. If it hadn't
been for your prompt, courageous act I would
have been burned to a cinder!
Piggy blinked again in astonishment. The crowd
had gathered round, and everyone was watching
and listening. With a grand sweep of his arms, the
Mayor took off the fine gold chain he wore about
his neck.
Piggy, he said. In the name of my fellow
citizens and yours, I am going to present you with
this tine gold chain, as a token of our gratitude
and admiration. Take care of it, my boy—l feel sure
that if you go on as you've begun, you II be Lord
Mayor yourself some day! and he hung the chain
round Piggy s neck.

Everyone was clapping and cheering. Uncle James
was beside himself with delight. He waved his
arms in the air
'Give him a cheer, friends!' he shouted. Three
cheers for my nephew. Piggy Crunter! and the
Mayor and the crowd joined in:
THREE CHEERS FOR
PIGGY CRUNTER.
