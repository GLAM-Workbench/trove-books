THOMAS STREET, HAWTHORN.
Songs of praise the angels sang.
Heaven with hallelujahs rang.
When Jehovah’s work begun.
When He spake and it was done.
Hark! while youthful voices sing
Loud hosannas to our King.
Songs of praise awoke the morn
When the Prince of Peace was born;
Songs of praise arose when He
Captive led captivity.
Heaven and earth must pass away;
Songs of praise shall crown that day;
God will make new heavens and
earth;
Songs of praise shall hail their birth.
Saints below, with heart and voice.
Still in songs of praise rejoice;
Learning here, by faith and love.
Songs of praise to sing above.
Borne upon their latest breath.
Songs of praise shall conquer death;
Then, amidst eternal joy.
Songs of praise their powers employ
Holy Spirit, hear us ;
Help us while we sing ;
Breathe into the music
Of the praise we bring.
Holy Spirit, prompt us
When we kneel to pray;
Nearer come, and teach us
What we ought to say.
Holy Spirit, shine Thou
On the Book we read;
Gild its holy pages
With the light we need.
Holy Spirit, give us
Each a lowly mind ;
Make us more like Jesus,
Gentle, pure, and kind.
Hely Spirit keep us
Safe from sins which lie
Hidden by some pleasure
From our youthful eye.
Holy Spirit, help us
Daily by Thy might.
What is wrong to conquer.
And to choose the right.
0 Word of God incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
0 Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky ;
We praise Thee for the radiance
That from the hallowed page,
A lantern to our footsteps.
Shines on from age to age.
The Church from her dear Master
Received the gift divine.
And still that light she lifteth
O’er all the earth to shine.
It is the golden casket
Where gems of truth are stored;
It is the heaven-drawn picture
Of Christ the living Word.
It floateth like a banner
Before God’s host unfurled;
It shineth like a beacon.
Above the darkling world.
It is the chart and compass
That, o’er life’s surging sea,
’Mid mists and rocks and quicksands.
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.
O make Thy Church, dear Saviour,
A lamp of purest gold.
To bear before the nations
Thy true light, as of old!
O teach Thy wandering pilgrims
By this their path to trace,
Till, clouds and darkness ended.
They see Thee face to face!
Almighty God! Thy word is oast
Like seed into the ground:
Now let the dew of heaven descend.
And righteous fruits abound.
Let not the foe of Christ and man
This holy seed remove j
But give it root in every heart.
To bring forth fruits of love.
Let not the world’s deceitful cares
The rising plant destroy;
But let it yield a hundredfold
The fruits of peace and joy.
Oft as the precious seed is sown.
Thy quickening grace bestow ;
That all whose souls the truth receive
Its saving power may know.


Jesus, blessed Saviour,
Help us now to raise
Songs of glad thanksgiving,
Songs of holy praise.
O how kind and gracious
Thou has always been!
0 how many blessings
Every day has seen!
Jesus, blessed Saviour,
Now our praises hear,
For Thy grace and favour
Crowning all the year.
Jesus, holy Saviour,
Only Thou canst tell
How we often stumbled.
How we often fell.
All our sins—so many !
Saviour, Thou dost know ;
In Thy blood most precious
Wash us white as snow.
Jesus, bless&d Saviour,
Keep us in Thy fear;
Let Thy grace and favour
Pardon all the year.
Jesus, loving Saviour,
Only Thou dost know
All that may befall us
As we onward go;
So we humbly pray Thee,
Take us by the hand.
Lead us ever upward
To the better land.
Jesus, blessed Saviour,
Keep us ever near;
Let Thy grace and favour
Shield us all the year.
Jesus, precious Saviour,
Make us all Thine own,
Make us Thine for ever.
Make us Thine alone ;
Let each day, each moment
Of this glad new year
Be for Jesus only,
Jesus, Saviour dear.
Then, 0 blessed Saviour,
Never need we fear,
For Thy grace and favour
Crown our bright New Year.
O blessed thought, when earthly cares are ended,
Best comes at length in mansions bright and fair,
Where ransomed souls by angels are attended;
Pilgrim, rejoice, no darksome night is there.
In that bright land where sorrow hath no dwelling,
Worldly ills and troubles cannot have a share;
Angels and saints His praise are ever telling;
Night is ever fled, no darkness cometh there.
All, all, is light: the heavenly Father’s glory
Fills all its courts with light surpassing fair ;
Sing, happy band! take up the wondrous story ;
All, all is light; no darkness enters there.
God is the sun. His light for ever giving,
Richest fragrance floats upon the balmy air;
O, blest abode! where saints for ever living,
’in His light rejoice, for night is never there.
Come to our poor nature’s night.
With Thy blessed inward light.
Holy Ghost the Infinite.
Comforter Divine.
We are sinful—cleanse us. Lord;
Sick anc( faint—Thy strength afford
Lost —until by Thee restored.
Comforter Divine.
Like the dew Thy peace distil;
Guide, subdue our wayward will,
Things of Christ unfolding still,
Comforter Divine.
Gentle, blessed, holy Guest,
Make Thy temple in each breast;
Thera Thy presence be confessed.
Comforter Divine.
With us, for us, intercede,
And, with voiceless groanings plead,
Our unutterable need,
Comforter Divine.
In us ‘Abba, Father ’ cry.
Earnest of the bliss on high.
Seal of immortality.
Comforter divine.
Search for us the depths of God :
Upwards by the starry road.
Bear us to Thy high abode.
Comforter Divine.
0 Thou to whom all thanks are due,
Our Maker and Preserver too.
Now teach our grateful songs to
praise
The God in whom are all our ways.
We thank Thee for Thy watchful care
Continued through another year;
For all Thy kind rememberanoe
shown
In every favour we have known.
Thy goodness lights the path w©
tread;
Thy mercy gives our daily bread ;
And each good thing we have besides.
Thy large and bounteous hand
provides.
But Thou has richer treasures stored
For those who follow Christ the Lord;
May we amongst that number be.
And find true joy alone in Thee !
