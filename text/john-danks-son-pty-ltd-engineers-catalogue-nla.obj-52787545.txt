ENGINEERS’ CATALOGUE
Issued for the use of Engineers, Factory Managers and Owners,
Motor Mechanics, Hardware Dealers, and all who have occasion to use or
order tools.
The makers of the world have been drawn upon to form a compre-
hensive selection of useful and time saving tools.
The makers’ names are in many cases given. Special research has
made certain makers tools indispensable, and their names are as familiar
to Engineers as to Storekeepers.
Prices are omitted owing to fluctuations which take place from mail
to mail. We will send you typed lists of any lines you mention, or if
ordering in a hurry you can depend upon receiving the lowest prices
possible.
Goods are packed with every care for despatch, but no responsibility

The Rules are 4 inches long, 5/8 inch wide, and 1/16
inch thick, with jaws 1/2 inch deep. The Graduation
is No. 4 with 32nds and 64ths on the front as shown
in cut, and Bths and 16ths on the back. The thumb
piece slides in a groove on the reverse side.
Where quick measurements are to be taken on small
rods tubing, sheet stock, etc.,, it is convenient to have
an instrument which measures the object between two
contacts. This slide calliper is highly satisfactory to
any mechanic, but of extreme value in stock rooms and
stores.

STARRETT KEY-SEAT RULES.
It is manifestly Impossible to hold an ordinary rule
on the cylindrical surface of a shaft and keep P
parallel with the axis, while laying off measurements
or drawing lines. The round surface of the work makes
it difflcut to hold the rule in place and it is liable to
form a slight angle -with the axis causing a measure-
ment to be shorter than the true length, which should
be made as it will be machined. This is an Important
matter when measuring lengths for splining key ways
on shafting; To overcome this difficulty there have
been designed rules with flanges, called key.seat rules.
The Starrett Key-seat Rule is an improvement over
the ordinary type in that the machinist’s scale is used
as part of the key-seat rule. This is made possible
bv a device which holds two straight edges together
in the form of a box square. One of these rules Is a
plain straight edge and the other the rule with which
the machinist ordinarily works. The two edges forming
the box square when applied to the surface of the
cylindrical piece keep the graduated edge of the rule
in a line parallel with the axis, permitting a line or
series of lines to be so drawn.
The steel Auxiliary Straight Edge is either plain or
graduated in 32nds and 64ths as desired, and sent when
ordered. Unless otherwise ordered the key-seat rule
is sent without auxiliary straight edges.

be put on or taken off almost instantly and are a
complete substitute for a more costly tool. They may
be used with our Combination Square Blades or with
any straight rule with l accurate results.

These instruments (Nos. 36 and 37) not only have all the
excellent feature of Nos. 38 and 39, as described on another
page, but in addition to common use may be used inside of
chambered cavities, over flanges, etc., removed and replaced
without losing the size callipered. This is done by loosening
the nut binding one arm to the auxiliary leaf and swinging
it out or in (while the point is locked) to clear the obstruc-
tion then moving it back against a stop where it will show
the exact size measured.
The sizes given refer to the length of the callipers, but the
outside ones will calliper a cylinder 20 per cent, larger than
their length, and the inside callipers wil open nearly twice
their length. This applies also to Nos. 26 and 27, Nos. 34 and
35, and Nos. 38 and 39.

LOCK-JOINT CALLIPERS. Toolmakers’ Dividers
Fig. 968 E.
Fig. 969 E.
The above cuts represent a line of reliable lock joint callipers of
wide scope for both inside and outside work, that can be instantly
adjusted to their full extent and as quickly locked firm in the
joint, and yet provided with a sensitive adjustment. The improve*
ment consists in a socket joint made tapering and locked or re-
leased by a partial turn of the knurled disc. A spring washer
under the disc maintains an easy friction in the joint when unlocked.
To further describe, in the under side of the short arm is a slot
containing a stiff spring. Riveted into the middle leg and project-
ing through an opening in the arm is a threaded stud on which is
a knurled nut having a bevelled hub, —this bears against a cone
in. the arm. —the action of the spring holding them together turns
the nut, forces them apart and adjusts the leg when the joint is
locked. The spring takes up all backlash, and keeps the legs
firm.

IMPROVED TRAMMEL POINTS.
Pig. 973 J E.
No. 50. A trammel is a tool used to measure the
distance between points too great to be reached with
ordinary dividers.
These trammels are made of bronze metal, with
forged steel points, hardened.
Either point can be removed, and the pencil socket
accompanying each pair put in its place.
Adjustable like spring dividers. Light and durable.
The bar, shown in cut, holding pencil socket in centre,
with frames at each end, is similar to what would be
used as a beam in using this tool, but is only long
inough to permit easy packing in the tool chest, as well
as in shipping.

No. 89. The adjustable scriber holder is reversible and
carrries either a fine tempered steel point or a pencil
lead, held in a split socket by a knurled nut. With
the holder turned outward it is possible to work close
to shoulders, something that cannot be done by a similar
tool of any other make; turned inward, points may be
brought close together to scribe the smallest circle.
With 4 in. beam a 7i in. circle and under may be scribed.
An auxiliary beam 13 inches lon[$ is furnished, with
which a 25 inch circle may be drawn. The cone centre
may be substituted for the regular point, adapting the
tool for scribing around a drilled hole. We also furnish
a pen attachment.

proportion to the length required for large work, while
it is equally well adapted to receive a narrow beam
for light work.
The points are eccentric, and may be loosened and
rotated in their sockets to make fine adjustments. Either
point may be removed and a common pencil inserted.
One of the calliper legs is provided with a joint,
worked by an eccentric thumb piece for fine adjust-
ments.
The above cut merely shows a section of a beam these trammel heads would be used with. As it is much
more convenient for a mechanic to fit the beam, we do not furnish same.

The auxiliaries designed to go with the trammel
heads are as shown above, viz., inside and out-
side calliper legs, an extra pair of long points, a
set of four ball points with holder, which enable
one to scribe a circle from the center of any hole
up to 1 § inches and under. A lead pencil may be
used in place of either of the steel points. Our
patent clamping device is adapted to
take in either a small or common sized pencil. T u *
trammels are furnished with or without auxili-
aries.

patent locking nut between the arms, against which a spiral spring acts, is a
valuable feature. After the fine adjustment is made, the nut may be turned
back, locking spring and arms firmly thus rendering the weak point which ren-
ders the common wing divider only as stiff as the adjusting spring. A full
threaded nut on the stud though which the quadrant passes, is a more durable
fastener than two or three threads tapped in the arm to hold the wing of the
old style. The head and arms of this tool are mad© from the best malleable iron,
the rest of steel. The points are hardened and warranted first-class. The small-
est size is 7 inches long; by adjustment of points it becomes 9 inches, and will
scribe a 22 inch circle; will calliper 11 inches outside and 13 inches inside. The
second size is 9 inches; by adjustment of points it becomes 12 inches, and will

IMPROVED LEVELS FOR TESTING
SHAFTING, ETC.
In addition to the regular parallel vial the bases have a cross
level which enable one to place or hold the base on a shaft level
in Its cross section, not canted sidewise; for the shape of a
level glass is such that, though true as adjusted on a flat sur-
face it will not be reliable when canted sideways. Hence the
value of the cross level, not only to test the truth of shafting,
but othersurfaces which tend to throw the level base into a
canting position.
The base of this level has a concave groove running through
the length of its base leaving a flat margin on each side, which
improves its seat for flat work, while forming an absolutely
true and reliable seat for shafting etc. These levels have the
outer tube for protecting the glass when not in use.

STARRETT TRANSIT,
No. 99.
To meet the demands of contractors, builders, carpen-
ters, farmers, and others for a transit and level, low
in price, yet sufficiently accurate for their needs, the
Starrett transit and level has beer, developed. These
instruments are very simple and they do not h iva the
expensive attachments found on engineers’ instruments.
The builder and contractor find them indispensable in
laying out building lots, locating batter boards, levelling
foundation walls, and in pouring concrete floors. Farm-
ers and squatters use them in laying out modern
drainage systems, irrigation ditches and new roads.
Millwrights and machinists may use the Starrett level
to advantage in levelling and aligning shafting in mill
or factory. In general, it may be said that the Starrett
transit or level can be used for the same purpose as
any engineers transit and level. Free from complica-
tions and confusing adjustments, any man may use
these instruments without knowledge of higher mathe-
matics and engineering principles necessary for using
the much higher priced engineer's transits.
The instrument is composed of iron and brass, and
consists of a tripod, to the head of which is connected
by a ball-and-socket joint an upper plate, which can
be levelled by the levelling screws.
This plate is recessed to contain a graduated arc
for taking horizontal angles. This arc is J of a circum-
ference, reading 90 degrees each side of O, and being
independent of level and sight tube can be turned and
used at any point of a complete circle. On this plate
rests a triangular frame to which are attached a level,
a graduated arc for taking vertical angles, graduated
45 degrees each side of O and a sight tube. The PLAIN
SIGHT TUBE has no lenses, is brass, twelve inches
long; in one end is a small eye aperture, in the other
.the usual cross wires.
The TELESCOPE has cross lines, is adjustable to
-distances and is same size and length as plain sight
; übe. The lens is well protected from dirt and break-
age by a friction cap, and a shutter for the eye aper-
ture.
With short legs, as shown in the cut, the instrument
1s eight inches high. With long extension legs, which
fasten on over the short legs, the height can be from
two feet eight inches to four feet eight inches. The
sight tube, level case, and graduated arcs are nickel-
TJlated, the other parts are japanned.
The advantages of this transit are as follows: The
head is held to the tripod with a bolt and knurled nut,
so as to make it stationary at any given point; the
graduated arc can be clamped to the base plate by
throwing a .small cam arrangement and a spring index-
ing finger to mesh in the arc graduations. The transit
with short legs is housed in a substantial wood box
about 4§ inches x 9J inches x inches; with a leather
strap running completely over the box cover, weighing
approximately 81bs,, making it easily carried about.
The extension legs are not packed in the box. They
weigh about 61bs., so when used with the short legs
he transit weighs about 11 lbs.
Directions for setting up and using are enclosed with
each transit.
Weight packed in box for shipment approximately 20
pounds.

LEVELLING INSTRUMENT
These instruments attain angles in a horizontal plane
only, and are designed for the use of farmers, con-
tractors, carpenters, millwrights, masons, surveyors, etc.
Its lightness, simple construction, and moderate price,
combined with the wide range of work to which it can
De applied, make it desirable for all who have
occasion to use such an instrument. The upper plate is
connected to the tripod head by a ball and socket joint,
and is levelled by the levelling screws. This nlate is
recessed to contain a graduated arc for taking angles,
and on the plate is the frame with level and sight tube
for baking horizontal angles only. The nickel-plated
SIGHT TUBE on this instrument is PLAIN, with no
lens, 12 in. long, with small eye aperture and tbe usual
cross wires. All other features are precisely the same
as the transit described and shown on this page.
Directions for setting up and using are enclosed

DOUBLE SQUARES
WITH HARDENED BLADE.
No. 13. This square is conceded to be the most practical
one for machinists, tool makers’ and pattern makers use
ever offered. The sliding blade, shortened o<’ extended full
length, makes it more valuable than a full set of the common
kind, while with the extra bevel blade, shown in the follow-
ing cut, we have both the hexagon and octagon angles, a
feature of great convenience to the pattern maker.
The seat against which the blade is clamped being convex,
should corners of the blade get injured, the accuracy of the
square is not affected.
Bevelled blades only supplied when ordered and charged

STARRETT’S COMBINATION SQUARES.
WITH HARDENED BLADE,
No. 11. Every tool warranted accurate. With
the adjustable blade this forms one of the most con-
venient and useful tools ever devised for mechanics’
use. It is a complete substitute for a whole set of
common try squares, and is one of the best guages
made for transferring- exact measurements or laying
out work. It is also convenient for a depth gauge or
to square in a mortise. For a mitre it is perfect
while with the auxiliary centre head it forms a cen-
treing square, both inside and outside, which for con-
venience and accuracy has no equal. The blades are
hardened and graduated in No. 4 and No. 7 graduation
with heavy figures, reading both ways.

No. 32. The centre head on this tool is made with
broader sides than on our other centre heads. Its
feature, while doing the work of anv centre head, is m
connection with angle and gear work, as the broad sides
taper on one side of the head only, enabling one to
find centres and scribe lines on angles. The sides

universal approval from machinists that it was but a
step to add to it the protractor head and have a com-
bination set. made up of the rule on which slide the
square, centre and protractor heads. This makes possible
more varieties of uses in laying out and testing work

BEVEL PROTRACTORS.
WITH HARDENED BLADE AND REVERSIBLE HEAD
No. 490. This tool is of the same general design as
No. 12 Protractor, with the additional feature of having
the head extend both sides of the blade. Tills greatly
increases the usefulness of the tool, as the same angles
may be transferred from either side of the frame with-
out resetting. Another improvement Is that the turret
is graduated to read both ways from 0 to 180 degrees.
Mechanics will clearly appreciate the point, as direct
readings may be had from the turret, indicating the
supplement of the angle as well as the angle required.
The fact that there is but one zero line on the frame
eliminates all possible chance of confusion as to whether
acute or obtuse angles are obtained.
The head of the Protractor is 7 inches long and Is
supplied with an accurate level attached to one side
as shown by cut. The blades are hardened and gradu,
ated with heavy figures reading both ways.

STARRETT PATENT PROTRACTOR.
No. 16. This protractor blade closes in the stock
either way against a stop making a square, plumb and
level. With a 24 inch blade It weighs but 1 % pounds.
The turret is graduated on both sides, one in degrees,
the other show pitch to the foot, so that the blade may
be set by the graduation for laying oft angles to any
degree or any pitch, and the opposite branch of the
stock will be right to lay out. the complementary angle
without mental calculation or error, for valley roofs,
bridge work, stair gauges, etc. The levels are so ar-
ranged that work can be levelled up to any degree or
pitch underneath or on top of a roof, rafter, stair
stringer, etc.
As a square or protractor with the sliding blade It
can be used in places where a fixed blade could not
and is a substitute for a- whole kit of squares from
the shortest to the full length of blade, making a depth
gauge for squaring in mortises and transferring
measurements. It may be used in place of the car-
penter’s old time steel square with the advantage of
being packed in a chest without taking up so much
room.

PROTRACTOR. -
No. 182. This protractor is designed particularly for
field engineers, for plotting drawings requiring lines to
radiate from the centre of a working point to any de-
gree point desired. In use, the fulcrum pin contain-
ing the needle point is withdrawn from the protractor
hub and bradded into the central point from which lines
are to radiate, then the hub of the protractor is slipped
on to it, when the working edge of the blade will line
through the needle point to any degree desired. When
not in use the needle is drawn back, held ffictionally
and safely carried telescoped in the hub.
The protractor has a 6 inch blade, lies flat on paper,
weighs but three ounces, is positively accurate, and
by field engineers and draftsmen is much appreciated.

INCLINOMETERS WITH HARDENED
BLADE.
No. 10. The above cut represents an inclinometer,
try square and bevel protractor combined.
It is compact, convenient, and a complete and perfect
substitute for several costly tools.
It consists of a stock and disc, both slotted to receive
the blade whcih folds in the stock. The blade attached
to the graduated rotary disc may be secured at any
angle from 0 to 90 degrees and by loosening the clamp
screw it may be shortened or extended full length, nr
removed for a straight edge.
The woiking face of the stock, extending both rbdes
of the blade, admit.; of its being revei sed so that the
same angle may be laid off in opposite directions with-
out changing the angle in the tool, thus requiring but
| of a graduated oiwde to obtain all angles noth ways.
At 90 degrees, the blade brings up against a case-
hardened sci gw, accurate’y adjusted, thus forming a
try square; by holding the blade perpendicular (the
level in the stock being at right angles), a plumb; by
folding the tool, a level, length of blade.
The blades are graduated in Bths, 16ths, 32nds, and

STARRETT PATENT BUILDERS’
COMBINATION TOOL.
No. 439. In this one instrument there are combined
«*even ordinary tools—rule, square, level, protractor,
bevel, pitch-to-foot indicator and plumb. It consists of
a stock 9 inches long, with sliding blade, 18 or 24
inches in length and 11 inches in width, with No. 4
graduation. The blade is adjustable through the re-
volving turret in the stock, which is graduated on one
side in degrees, with two rows of figures reading either
right or left, and on the other side, graduated to show
pitch.to-foot. the graduations showing i inch pitch (See
small cut). With levels set in each side of the stock
any incline by degrees or pitch-to-foot can be levelled
either on top or under the work.
The combination tool is also used for laying out or
for cutting for valleys or hips of different pitch. The
blade is first set to show the pitch desired. Then place
the face of the stock against the work and draw a line
against the blade; then place the square end of the
stock against the work and draw the complementary
line, which will give the complementary angle without
mental' calculation. For a try-square it is far superior
to the old-fashioned carpenters’ two-foot square, which
cannot be folded to put in the chest nor can the blade
be shortened when it meets obstructions. Neither can
the old-fashioned carpenters’ square be used as a level
or plumb or depth gauge as can this simple tool.

UNIVERSAL BEVEL.
No. 15. The set-off in the blade increases its capacity
and usefulness for bevel gear work, etc., so that any
angle, however slight, may be obtained.
Another valuable feature is, one edge of the case being
solid, a rest is formed directly under the blade, where
thin templets may be placed and accurately fitted. It
is also useful in working the draft on patterns and in
turning angles on the lathe which cannot be reached
wPh an ordinary bevel.

IMPROVED BEVELS
No. 47. The advantages of this bevel over any other
tool of this kind made, consist in its having not only the
blade slotted but the stock as well, thus admitting ad-
justments that cannot be obtained with a common bevel.

nut is convenient for picking up the instrument. To
obtain the complement of an angle without resettling,
place the opposite straight part of the stock against
the T-square or straight edge of a drawing board, and
the reverse angle can be obtained by placing the straight
part of the arc against the T-square or straight edge.

at any angle. The slotted auxiliary blade with clamp
bolt may be slipped on to the spit blade and be clamped
at any desired angle and used, in combination with the
stock of the other, for laying out work, measuring, or
showing any angle desired, and when so combined will

UNIVERSAL BEVEL PROTRACTORS
No. 360. When angles other than 90 degrees and 45
degrees are to be laid off, a protractor must be used
because all angles are not obtainable with a square or
bevel. The Starrett Universal Protractor is a graduated
disc with a fixed blade and adjustable stock. Any given
angle may be laid off or measured by setting the stock
at that angle by the graduated disc. This tool has a
very wide range of usefulness as shown by the illua.
trations.
The blade is either 7 or 12 inches by i inch and the
stock is 4 inches long; both are made from sheet steel
nicely finished. The tool weighs 6 ounces. The digc
is graduated in degrees from zero to 90 degrees eacli
way and rotates the entire circle on a centre stud. The
blade, clamped by an eccentric stud against the end of
the disc, may slide back and forth its full length or
turn through any angle around the circle and be
clamped firmly at any point. It is thus adapted to posi-
tions impossible with other protractors and renders un-
necessary the use of the common bevel in transferring;
angles.
One side of the centre being flat makes it a conveni-
ent tool for laying on paper in drafting and it has double-
the utility of any similar tool.
The attachment shown in the small cut will be found
convenient in obtaining small angles.

Slide Rule Calliper and Circumference
Gauge.
No. 424.
This gauge has a double function —being graduated
to read the circumference as well as the diameter of
the object measured, the relation of circumference to
diameter being shown by the graduations on upper
corner of the rule (capacity 3| inches, about 11 inches
circumference). It was originally designed for rope
or cordage manufacturers. It makes a first.class
slide rule calliper of large scope, opening 3J inches.
The jaws, being 1 5/16 inches deep, will calliper a
cylinder up to 2S inches in diameter. The rule is
graduated in 32nds of an inch standard and 16ths of an
Inch circumference measure. All corners of the tool
are rounded smooth to make it fit to carry in the pocket
and agreeable to handle. The circumference measure
will assist in calculating how many feet a minute the
cutting tool in a lathe is doing on any diameter within
the scope of the gauge and so help determine whether
the tools should have a faster or slower speed.
RULE.- —The circumference being shown by the gauge,
multiply the same by the speed the lathe runs per
minute and the result will show the number of inches
or feet the circumference is running and the tool
cutting.

MICROMETER CALLIPER SQUARES.
For Outside and Inside Measure.
This instrument enables one to enlarge or decrease
work one or more thousandths from that callipered,
and fills the bill for both a first-class calliper square
and micrometer of large scope and quick adjustment.
The jaws of the 4 inch and 6 inch sizes are 1 5//8
inches deep, while those of the 12 inch size are
2 3/8 inches deep, and are hardened ground and lapped.
One side of the beam is graduated in 64ths and the
other in 40ths; and either side may be used as a common
calliper square, or, through the micrometer, to show
l.OOOths full length, on either inside or outside work.
This is done by first setting the line on the movable
jaw to agree with any division nearest the size wanted.
Fasten it there, release binding clasp, and turn
the micrometer nut to agree with the indicating
line on the clasp; now tighten this, release
movable jaw and turn micrometer nut, counting
l.OOOths, adding to or taking from the division shown
on beam at the starting point.
An excellent feature of this instrument is the spiral
spring between the jaw and clasp which not only takes
up all backlash, but limits the pressure against the
work to the strength of the spring. This is instantly
felt through released pressure on the nut, and prevents
springing the jaws.

INSIDE MICROMETER CALLIPERS.
SET A
No. 124.
The above cut shows inside micrometer calliper.
No. 124, which, like No. 120, is designed for internal
and linear measurements, such as measuring cylinders,
rings; also for setting callipers, comparing gauges, etc.
It is also useful in measuring parallel surfaces. The
micrometer screw in the head has % inch movement in
Sets A and B, one inch in Set C. and, by means of the
extension rods furnished, the sizes as given below for
each set can be obtained. The extension rods arc
provided with a collar, against which the rods are con-
veniently and accurately set in the micrometer head.
In setting these rods see that the zero mark on the
collar coincides with the zero mark on the micrometer
head. With the rods are sent standard gauges or rings
to slip on the rods under the collars, to further
extend the rod. The contact surfaces are all hardened,
and provision is made for adjustment, to compensate
for wear of the screw and contact surfaces.
The auxiliary handle, as shown in cut, can be used
with sets A, B and D. The handle is used by removing
the nut opposite the lock nut and screwing the handle
in the place of same, thus fitting the tool for use-
in places too small for the hand.
Set A has 6 rods and one i-inch gauge, and measures
from 2 inches to 8 inches.
Set B has 10 rods and one J-inch gauge, and measures
from 2 inches to 12 inches.
Set C has 4 rods and one 1-inch and two 2-inch gauges,
and measures from 8 inches to 32 inches.

Starrett Patent Telescoping Gauges.
No. 229.
These are instilments from which the exact size of
holes or slots can be taken by an outside calliper' t«r
micrometer, so that shrink, close or loose fits, varying
in thousandths, or less, can be made and measured.
To use the instrument to measure a hole: Compress
the telescoping head and lock the plunger by a slight
turn of the knurled screw in the end of the handle,
insert the head inside the hole, release the lock, and
the plunger will expand across the hole to a fit. Now
lock the plunger by a slight turn of the screw, with-
draw and calliper over the ends of the head with a
micrometer, which will give the exact size of the hole.
The ends of each telescope head are hardened and are
made on a radius of the smallest hole it will enter.
These instruments are more reliable than ordinary leg
callipers on account of the tendency of the legs of the
latter to spring and of the points to catch in blow holes
or other depressions. They can be used, of course,
either in fitting cylinders to holes or holes to cylinders.
The gauges are made in sizes to enter holes from
' inch to 6 inchs.

Improved Screw Pitch Gauge.
No. 40.
A late improvement in screw pitch gauge is the
stamping on each leaf of decimals showing the double
depth of thread, which, of course, equals the depth of
threads on the two sides of a tap having the same
pitch. This enables the workman to determine what
size of drill must be used to leave a full V-thread for
a tap having the same pitch. To do this calliper with
a micrometer over the threads of the tap and from its
size in thousandths shown, deduct those decimals
given on the pitch leaf which agree with the pitch of
the tap. The result will show in thousandths the size
of drill needed or a full thread. Allowance is to be
made for the amount the thread is to be flattened.
The gauge has 22 pitches, viz.: 9 10 11 Hi 12

FILLET OR RADIUS GAUGES.
No. 272. This gauge is similar in design to
Xo. 118 and affords means of obtaining the radii of

blade is stamped with the radius in 64ths, the external
being on one side and the internal on the other. It
can be used in any position or at any angle, the forma-
tion allowing it to be used up to a shoulder, and for
duplicating sample pieces. The studs holding blades in
place are eccentric with the round end of case. This
is of advantage as when the gauge is opened the edge
of case stands well away from the edge of the leaves.

PATENT INSPECTOR’S GAUGES.
No. 30. This gauge was designed at the suggestion
of a government inspector to fill their need of a tool
for measuring the thickness of ship plates, boiler plates.
• etc., where measure has to be taken through a bolt hole
or hole drilled for the purpose.
The contact point is carried in beyond any burr
formed by drilling, insuring correct measurement.
The slide measuring rod is graduated on two opposite
sides, one side reading 32nds, the other 40ths. Read-
ing from the top of the knurled friction slide, which
after the contact ends of the gauge are brought to-
gether against the thing being measured, -Is slipped
down against the top, the graduations above it show the
■ exact measure. Then the measuring rod may be in-
stantly withdrawn, the hook part removed and all taken
to the light and the correct measure indicated above the
friction slide easily read.
The knurled nut over the split hub serves to con-
tract same to fit close on the slide or to lock firm,
making a solid gauge, convenient for any mechanic.
The gauge weighs about 1 ounce and is adapted for
the vest pocket. Width, 1 inch. Capacity, 1| inch.

PLANER AND SHAPER GAUGE.
Xo. 246. The time taken by a planer or shaper-
hand in adjusting the depth of the first cut, or in setting
the tools for any required cut has been found to be
so great by ordinary methods that Starret’s have de-
signed this special gauge, which greatly facilitates these
■operations. By setting this gauge to a micrometer, sur-
face gauge or calliper and bringing the planer tool in
contact with it the first cut may be absolutely relied
upon. This reduces to a minimum the cut and trv
method which is common in shops not having this
•gauge. The level in the base o: the gauge is a feature
readily appreciated. The base <.md slide are steel forg-
ings. All measuring surfaces are nicely ground.

UNIVERSAL SURFACE GAUGES.
No. 257. This gauge has our latest
improvements, which make it all
that can be desired, the following
being points of special merit:
It has a heavy base. grooved
through the bottom and end, adapting
it for use on or against circular work
as well as flat surfaces. The spindle
passes through a rotating head,
jointed to a rocking bracket, pivoted
in base, the bracket being adjusted by
a knurled screw in one end against a
stiff spring in the other. The spindle
may be set upright or at any angle,
or turned so as to work under the
base, and can be sensitively adjusted
to any position. The snug and head
carrying the scriber are so made That
when the clamp nut is loosened all
may be freely, moved to any position,
and by friction springs retained in
place until a slight turn of the clamp
nut hold them firmly.
SURFACE GAUGES.

In the base are four gauge pins, frictionally held,
which may be pushed to bear against the edge of a
surface plate, or in the slot of a planer bed for linear
work.
Fo small work the spindle may be removed and the
scriber inserted in a hole provided for it, where it
can be sensitively adjusted and used to advantage on
bench work.
Special attention is called to the four gauge pins
in the corners of the base, which adapt it to be used
as a locomotive guide line and make it more conveni-
ent than other gauges for many uses.

CENTRE TESTER.
Fig. 1124 E.
No. 65. This instrument was designed to use in
adjusting and locating centrally any point or hole in
a piece of work operated upon in a lathe chuck or on a
face-plate: also to test the truth of lathe centres or a
shaft between the centres, the instrument being held in
the tool posts.
This tester is of improved design and well finished.
The indicating needle is 12% inches long when jointed
together, magnifying greatly the slightest movement
at the indicating point, and being in two sections it may
be carried in the mechanic’s kit conveniently. The
needle also passes through the ball, having a split stem,
forming a chuck for holding it, that it may be adjusted
to any desired length. The ball is pivoted to form
a universal joint, but may be instantly converted into
a single joint for vertical motion by merely tightening
the knurled nut, adapting it for both inside and outside
surface contact. A steel ball about .175 inch in dia-
meter slips over the point of the needle for inside
work. The instrument is joined to a tool-post shank
by a flexible steel ribbon with sufficient spring to pro-
perly hold the needle in contact with the work. The
steel ribbon may also be adjusted by loosening the
knurled nut holding it to the shank. This is an added
feature readily appreciated, as the point to bo indicated
often is greater than the adjustment attached on the
cross rest of a lathe. It is a tool needed in every up-
to-date tool room.

Fig. 1125 E.
UNIVERSAL DIAL TEST INDICATOR
No. 196. Simple, reliable, easily read and very
sensitive, it may be adjusted to any angle. The slightest
pressure upon contact point produces a movement of the
hand on the dial. Circumference of di\l divided into
100 equal spaces, each representing a movement of the
contact point of one-thousandth of an inch. One revo-
lution of the hand therefore indicates one tenth of an
inch, the capacity of the instrument being two-tenths.
With the contact points D and E any exterior surface
may be tested as in cutters, racks, etc., whereas the
contact point C with its smaller radius and diameter
should be used only on plain surfaces. By bringing the
contact point against the work with just enough pres-
sure to give the hand one full turn, then setting it
at 0, an opportunity is given for one full revolution
of the hand to both right and left of 0, showing a rise
or drop in the work and the amount of variation. A
most valuable feature is the adjustable dial. By turn-
ing the knurled rim the dial may be instantly moved to
bring the 0 mark to any point desired in relation to
the hand. Each indicator is fitted with three hardened
contact points for different classes of work. The special
tool post holder and sleeve are useful in lathe work.
For genera] work the indicator with sleeve K is adapted
for use with 9 inch or 12 inch surface gauges, No. 57 A
and B, and No. 257 A and B.
The clamp G permits attaching the indicator to
larger lathe and planer tools, milling arbors, etc.
The attachment F more than doubles the value of
the indicator, adapting it for use inside of hole, to reach
over blockings on face plates, etc.

UNIVERSAL TEST INDICATOR
No. 64. This indicator may be used to test inside,
•outside or surface work. It can be instantly attached
to the spindle or the scriber of any surface gauge, and
used to show the slightest variation in thousandths.
It may be clamped to a flat or round support, up to
| inch flat or round. A holder, as shown in cut. Is
designed to go in the tool-post of a lathe, adapting it for
use to show the accuracy of all sorts of lathe work,
turning, chucking, or locating and centering work on
face plate. It is particularly adapted to truing up tool-
makers’ buttons as it can be moved with the carriage
of a lathe testing the button its full length. The head
of the needle has three working points, equally distant
from its fulcrum, so that the needle will vibrate, read-
ing in thousandths, when work is in contact with eith-er
point—in front, above or below it. When in front,
the spring operating the needle needs to be reversed
to throw the point of the needle up instead of down
as when used above or below the work. This may be
instantly done by a slight turn of the knurled disc to
which the vibrating spring is attached. The working
parts of the head are hardened. In setting the indica-
tor, bring the contact point against the work so that
the needle will point to 0, when any variation either
way will show. The scale is graduated to read .015
inches on each side of 0.

IMPROVED SPEED INDICATOR.
Fig. 1129 E
Xo. 106. This is a
nicely made and finely
working indicator. The
working parts are en-
closed like a watch, and
aS well made. The gradu-
ations show every revo-
lution. and with two rows
of figures read both right
and left as the shaft may
run. While looking at
the watch each hundred
revolutions may he
counted by allowing the
raised knob on the re-
volving disc to pass
under the thumb as the
instrument is pressed to
its work.
A late Improvement in
this indicator consists in
the rotating disc, which
being carried by friction,
may be moved to the
starting point where the
raised knobs coincide.
When the spindle is
placed in connection with
the revolving shaft,
pressing the raised knob
with the thumb will pre-
vent the disc from rota-
ting, while the hand o
the watch gets to the
right position to take r‘
time. By releasing
pressure the disc is lib-
erated for counting the
revolutions of the shaft
when every 100 may be
noted by feeling the knob
pass under the thumb
lightly pressed against
it, thus relieving the
which has only to look
on the watch to note the
time. \
The instrument is| :
nickel plated, and has a,
rubber handle, making a
safe insulator when used
o)i electrical machinery.

REGISTERING SPEED INDICATOR
Fig. 1130 E
Xo. 107. This instru-
ment was devised to
automatically register
hundreds as well as units
and tens, and thus re-
deye the mind from keep-
ing tally; also to fur-
nish a better registering
indicator at a more
reasonable cost than has
been on the market here-
tofore. The instrument
will register 5,00 revolu-
tions. The large dial is
graduated into one hun-
dred lines, each one rep-
resenting one hundred
revolutions of the
spindle ( or one complete
turn of the large dial).
A spring finger trip at-
tached to the case en-
gages with one of the
limes in the small dial
kind nolds il from revolv-
ing until the large dial
Jmakes one complete turn
'when the trip pin pass-
ing under the spring trip
lifts it, and the dial is
trictionally carried along
line, thus showing that
by the large plate
one hundred revolutions
of the spindle have been
made. This instrument
is nickel plated, has a
hard rubber handle,
making a safe insulator
when used on electrical
machinery.

Simple to work. Cannot easily get out of order.
Made of Aluminium for convenience in carrying about.
Drill bar made specially to grip any size Drills, Taps.
Stop Ferrules, or Plugs. Saddles will fit any size mains.
DIRECTIONS FOR TAPPING-.
Cut a centre on the pipe to allow the drill to centre
easily. Place the saddle (fig. 4) on the pipe. Then
fix the apparatus as shown. After drilling the hole in
the pipe, raise the drill into the top chamber (a), then
close the centre valve (c). and by turning on the 3-way
tap at the side, so as to allow the water to exhaust
from the top chamber (a), it will then close instantly,
thus separating the top and bottom chambers. Then
unbolt the cap (fig.6) and fix the tap in the drill bar
and bolt the cap down again. Then turn on the 3-way
tap so as to allow the water to flow from the bottom
chamber (b).into the top chamber (a), to equalise the
pressure on each side of the centre valve. This will
allow it to drop, as shown (fig, 1). Then the operation
of tapping and screwing in stop ferrule or plug may
be proceeded with as desired. I

STARRETT PATENT RATCHET WRENCH
For Engineers, Machinists, Motorists, and Motor
Mechanics
N 0.443. In places difficult of access or in cramped
quarters where a swing through a long arc is impos-
sible, the ordinary monkey or S wrench is out of the
question. Some other means of turning nuts and
bolts is required. To meet these conditions we have
invented and perfected the Starrett Ratchet Wrench.
It consists of a ratchet with reversible pawl and a lung
wrench handle. With this wrench we furnish an ex-
tension to reach into otherwise inaccessible' places: also
a universal joint for turning nuts or bolts when it is
impossible to get the wrench on at right angles to the
ends of the bolt; a spark plug socket for use on auto-
mobile and aeroplane engines; a drilling attachment
■which takes standard square shank drills from S of an
inch to | inch diameter, and a screw driver with re-
versible end; together ■with several adjustments to go
with the drilling attachment.
This ratchet wrench is of particular value to
engineers and chaffeurs who have to work about
machinery crowded into small space or around hot
engines. The sockets for the wrench will turn nearly
any standard hexagon nut or bolt. With this wrench
finished surfaces and corners of nuts need not be
marred by taking it off and replacing at every fraction
of a turn. Price

TAYLOR “IMPROVED” PATENT SPIRAL
SELF-CENTRING CHUCKS.
DESCRIPTION OF MECHANISM
THE BODY of the Chuck is made of special high-
priced mixture of cast iron, and has its front face in
the form of a hollow cone; in this face the “Ways” in
which the jaws slide are cut. In all sizes above 8 in.
the central portion of the body passes right through to
the back of the chuck, giving the maximum of strength
with the minimum of depth.
THE BACK retains the internal working parts of the
Chuck in position, and in all sizes contains the recess
for locating the adapter.
THE SPIRAL is made of steel, hardened and ground
up perfectly true in all sizes; it has machine cut teeth
in the back face, and is revolved by means of any one of
the three pinions. The front face has the form
of a hollow cone, and has cut upon it a Spiral Vee
thread, which engages with the teeth cut in the back of
the jaws, thus advancing or withdrawing the jaws
simultaneously, and gripping the work true, without
setting.
THE JAWS are made of a special steel, hardened all
over and ground perfectly true in position after harden-
ing, on the parts that grip the work, and on the
parts that slide in the “ways” in the chuck body. Two
styles of jaws are usually supplied with the chuck. Figs.
1 and 2. Fig. 1 style of jaws is used for general lathe
work. Fig. 2 style of jaws is used for holding bars, etc.
(not illustrated).
THE BEVEL PINIONS for revolving the Spiral have
machine-cut teeth of special design; they are in all
cases, hardened, ground and tested before assembling.
All parts are made to limit gauges, and are inter-
changeable.

ALOXITE CLOTH.
Fig. 1448 E.
Aloxite is the ideal abrasive material for cutting
steel, and when coated on cloth it is far superior to
emery for general machine shop work. Aloxite is ex-
ceedingly hard and extremely tough, and it not only
does better and faster work than emery, but the Aloxite
Cloth, because of the toughitess of the grain, shows
much longer life.

WHITWORTH BOLT THREAD.
The Green River die is a round, two-piece die ex-
treme];- simole in construction, requiring no collet.
The die is fastened to a base which forms a guide
for the work to be cut.
The two halves of the die are hinged together by a
cup-head screw, which, with the taper-head adjusting
screw, holds the die and guide together.
The die may be adjusted to size, without removal from
stock or holder, by turning the taper-head screw in, to
open, and out, to close.
While Green River dies are intended to cut from the
side next the guide, they are also slightly chamfered
on the face side to enable then/ to cut close to shoulder.

WHITWORTH STANDARD BOLT THREAD.
In these tools there are features that place them in a.
quite different and higher class than the more common
types. The features are obtained through the form of
dies and of device for centring the work.
Dies, —The dies are of the chaser form, four pieces-
to a set, which form permits the most ready and wide'
adjustment, also the easy renewal of cutting edges by
grinding.
Guide Jaws. —Three of these through a universal
movement centre the material accurately to the dies,
whether the material he over or under size. The
mechanism for adjusting the jaws is self-locking and
the entire device is detachable to permit the dies to cut
closer to a shoulder.
In the control of the dies there are means for setting
them very accurately, for holding them positively,
and instantly releasing them at the end of a cut, all
through the use of the hands only. The holding does
not depend on any frictional clamps, screws or nuts,
but on a positive lock. The releasing avoids all turning
back over threads.
The Die Stocks described are put up in hard-wood.

easy (-lining. Tile slock Is light in weight, and with
only a few working parts. The sizes of pipe are plainly
marked mi tin l face of the tool. The dies are adjustable
for wear, and for different sizes.
This tool is equipped with opening dies. This saves
dragging' the cutting dies over the finished thread to take
the edge off your thread, which is the cause of most of
the leaks.
This tool is complete without any loose dies or parts
whatsoever.
The set. of Dies furnished with.the tool will thread
all sizes of pine from 1 Lo 2in.. since all of these sizes
have the same number of threads to the inch. In this
way the chuck with the dies in position makes an entirely
self-contained tool without a single loose part to carry.

OSTER BULL DOG RATCHET DIE STOCKS. STANDARD PIPE THREAD
Fig. 1529 E
The Bull-Mug T J> ie Stocks shown are all of the
same style and description. These stocks are recommended
it you wish to cover a long range of sizes. They are
-especially suitable if you are required to carry the stock
and dies from job to job. One Bull-Dog Stock will take
the place of several ordinary pipe threading tools. The
Bull-Dog Die Stocks are equipped with full width dies of
correct taper, and will cut a properly tattered thread of
iiin. taper to the foot. When the fittings are screwed on.
the joints will be tight, and without the use of any dope
The die? while they are full width, can also be termed
“easy cutting dies,” because they are ground with the
proper rake, and can be operated by one man on all sizes
up to 2in. pipe. The die cam is graduated to exact stand-
ard size, and any slight variation in size can be obtained.
»
When once set, you can repeat wthout resetting. Fo. -
steam jobs, conduit and signal work, this feature is
very important. The pipe can be butted in the couplings,
and for fine work the cut can be made so that no threads
are exposed to view. The stock is complete without any
leader screw or force feed.

CHAIN DRILL.
Its distinguishing feature is the
rapidity of operation. Taking up and
releasing of chain is done in a mo-
ment with a friction feed. When the
chain is tight, the automatic feed'
operates by turning a small lever to*
horizontal position. When drill has
reached desired depth the automatic-
feed is thrown off by turning lever to-
upright position, lleverse movement
of brace and drill is withdrawn—
chain is slackened in a moment.
Chuck holds up to i inch.
No. 1500—3-Jaw Chuck.

Miller’s Falls Ratchet Hand Drill.
Fig. 1655 E
Tliis is a large sized hand drill of the highest grade
with both ratchet and change speed. It takes round
shank drills up to yin., so it can be used for many kinds
of large drilling ordinarily done by a breast drill as
well as the smaller drilling of a small hand drill.
The hollow end handle is of mushroom shape to take
the place of a breastplate for use against the body.
With some mechanics and amateurs this one size of

end* handle is quickly detachable and will hold twist
drills up to the full capacity of the chuck. Xo drills
are furnished with the tool.
The ratchet is shifted from right to left or vice
versa by giving a half turn to the cap of a small boss
on the crank handle. The speed is changeable by turn-
ing a knurled barrel by pressure of the thumb and
operates instantly without any manipulation of the
crank. The gears are cut. the pinions being of steel
and inclosed for protection. There is an equalising
bearing to counteract the outward thrust of the large
gear.
An important feature is the ball thrust bearing which
insures long wear and ease in operation.

to gin. The springs in this chuck are situated away
down in the base where they cannot lie reached by
the shank of a drill and jambed or knocked out of place.

ARMSTRONG THREADING TOOLS.
A Threading Tool is essentially a forming tool and
any error or inaccuracy of shape or angle in the tool
point will surely be reproduced in the thread and
must result in poorly fitted work.
The cutters used in the Armstrong Threading Tool
require grinding on the top edge only, to sharpen, and
therefore always remain true to form and of correct
angle; its use thus insures perfect fitting threads, and
saves much grinding, as well as dispensing entirely
with forging and tempering. The cutters are backed
off to afford proper clearance. The back of cutter is
eccentric in form and bears upon a hardened stop screw.
This arrangement allows of positive and accurate ad-
justment.

In no other form of forged lathe tool is the propor-
tionate cost of maintenance compared with effective
work done so great as in the cutting-off tool; con-
sequently in this class of work the Armstrong system
is especially effective and economical.
As the cutter is adjustable to any desired clearance,
the greatest possible support is obtainable under all
conditions.
The cutters are bevelled on both sides and are held
at an angle giving the side clearance and top rake
needed to obtain a clean smooth cut.

GOODELL PRATT CUTTING-OFF TOOL,
Fig. 1677 E
This is a labor-saving device for cutting off any kind
of round stock up to 1 inch in diameter. The rod to be
cut is fastened in a Lathe and revolved at the same
speed that should be used for an ordinary cutting-off
tool. Then turn the Thumb Screw to close the hardened
Guides to a running fit on the work in order to keep
it from chattering. Pressing lightly on the Handles
feeds the circular Cutter into the work.
The Cutter is made from a high grade of tool steel;
it is very easily sharpened until the entire circum-
ference has been used up.
A stop is provided in order that short pieces for
Dowels. Pins, or Screws may be rapidly cut to a uni-
form length.

ARMSTRONG SPRING THREADING TOOL
Fig. 1678 E
The Armstrong Spring Threading Tool is designed to
combine strength and convenience of adjustment and
operation with the resilliency which is considered by
many machinists to be helpful in obtaining a smooth,
flnshing cut or thread especially on alloy steels of an
extremely rough nature. Convenient means are also
provided for obtaining complete rigidity when same is
desirable as, for instance, in taking a roughing out or
doing an ordinary job of turning. The cutter can be
held at different angles as shown.
Fig. 1679 E
This tool has fewer parts than any other on the
market consequently it is stronger, simpler and at the
same time is adapted for use at any angle, right or
left hand. Costs less than a High Speed Forged Tool.
Effectively it equals a dozen.
Fig. 2 shows Armstrong Planer Tool at work in close
corners, giving a good general idea of clearance ob-
tained. It shows also a few of the angles at which the
cutter can be set. A job similar to one shown could
be finished with the Armstrong Planer Tool without
shifting position of the work on bed.
Complete with Wrench and One High Speed Cutter.

VELOCITE.
is an Australian made White Anti-Friction Metal with a
big reputation for cool running and friction reducing
properties. VELOCITE is made from pure materials and
is thoroughly alloyed—the secret of uniform quality.
VELOCITE is used »y various Government Departments.
Fig. 1719 E
VELOCITE forms an excellent White Metal
Bearing for Motor Car Work.
VELOCITE is used —and has been for a great many
years—for the renewable bearings of our own make Billa-
bong Centrifugal Pumps. The high speed at which these
pumps are driven calls for a cool running bearing metal
of special friction reducing properties, and VELOCITE
has always stood well up to these exacting requirements.
Forms a Good End-Thrust Bearing.
One of our clients reported to us that he was able, with
the use of VELOCITE to run an upright shaft effectively,
that previously had caused him a great deal of trouble.
VELOCITE saves power and lubricant by reducing
friction. VELOCITE minimizes bearing troubles.
Price, per cwt. Subject to fluctuation
of metal market. Special prices for large quantities. Each
ingot weighs approximately 71bs.—halves supplied. VELO-
CITE can be melted over and over again.
Instructions for Using.
Melt in an ordinary iron ladle. Take care not to burn
the metal by over heating. VELOCITE should be heated
slowly and just sufficiently to melt it. VELOCITE is ready
for immediate use soon as it chars or blackens a piece
of newspaper without causing the paper to burst into
flame. Take the chill off the mould or bearing holder
before pouring. The shrinkage is very slight. When a
number of bearings are to be run, the spindle or axle
should be wrapped with one thickness of ordinary brown
paper which will give ample allowance to obtain a close fit.

36in. Church Bell cast in our Melbourne Foundry, weighing half a ton.
We cast and supply Bells for Churches, Schools,
Ships, Factories, Fire Towers, etc. Genuine Bell
Metal is used, giving them the real Bell Tone.
These bells can be fitted with cast iron gudgeon,
rope wheel, and gun metal bearings. For the larger
sizes bells we recommend these fittings, as it is
claimed by many autho; ities that the swinging motion
of the bell allows the sound to travel over a much
greater area.

PITT STREET.
SYDNEY.
Bells up to 20 inches diameter can be fitted with
our patent clapper and trigger. This does away with
the necessity of swinging the bell. Angle steel towers
supplied for hanging bells, where belfries are not
available.
Bells range in size from 8 inches to 36 inches dia-
meter, measured across the mouth.
Special bells cast for special purposes or occasions.
