Extract from Report of Proceedings
at the
Ordinary General Annual Meeting,
held on Wednesday, 26th Nov., 1919
THE Board of Directors are in the happy position to-day of having no
War Casualties to report, and of being able to advise of the return of
many of our officers from the area of hostilities. Most of them are
coming back to the Bank, but a few prefer other occupations in life. Many
of them are bearers of decorations and other emblems of distinction and
rank, and all of them merit our admiration and gratitude, and I feel sure the
Shareholders will approve of an appropriate publication being issued, recording
the fine services rendered by the individual members of the National Bank’s
Staff to their King and Country —the presentation of a copy being made to
each of our officers, when completed.”
The National Bank of Australasia Limited


History of the Bank
■ HE National Bank of Australasia Ltd. was established in the early
days of the existence of Victoria as a separate Colony. It was
six years after separation from New South Wales, and a year after
the election of the first Parliament under responsible Govern-
ment, that the movement for the establishment of the Bank was
initiated. On the 27th October, 1857, a meeting was held at the office of Mr.
J. R. Timbury, Queen Street, Melbourne, and the following notice was inserted
in The Argus and other newspapers ;
NOTICE,
THE NATIONAL BANK OF AUSTRALASIA.
“A preliminary meeting of the proposed National Bank of Australasia held
this day at the office of J. R. Timbury, Esq,, the meeting having approved of the
object, suggested the calling of a public meeting on Tuesday next, at 11 a.m., for
the purpose of carrying out the practical establishment of the Bank.
“In conformity with the above resolution a public meeting will be held at the
Mechanics Institute, Collins Street, on Tuesday next, the 3rd November. The
chair to be taken at 11 a.m.
"ALEXR. J. GIBB.”
At the meeting on 3rd November it was resolved that a Bank should be
immediately formed, to be called “The National Bank of Australasia,” and at
an adjourned meeting held two days later the following were appointed as a
Provisional Committee : —Messrs. John MacKenzic, Edward Mackie Watson,
Nicholas Riordan, Thos. E. Martin, Richard Guthridge, Maurice J. Moses,
Thos. Splatt, Samuel Magnus, Wm. Clarke, Jas. Board, B. R. Mathew, and
Edward Wills.
On the 10th November, 1857, Mr. Alex. J. Gibb was appointed Secretary
to the Provisional Committee, and temporary offices were taken at 32 Collins
Street West.
The prospectus of the Bank, issued on 18th November, 1857, provided for a
capital of £1,000,000 sterling, in 200,000 shares of £5 each.
The young Bank had its early vicissitudes, but by 3rd May, 1858, it was ready
to receive oilers for premises, and on sth July, 1858, went into the occupation
of premises in Queen Street, then being vacated by the Oriental Bank.
The first meeting of shareholders was held on 10th August, 1858, when the
following six directors were elected; —Messrs, A. R. Cruikshank, Alfred
Cumberland, Geo. W. Porter, Thos. Brown, junr., John Houston, and Thos.
H. Lempriere.


The first Board meeting was hold at the Bank's offices, Queen Street, on
12th August, 1858, when Mr. A. R. Cruikshank was elected Chairman of the
Board. The Bank opened its doors for business on 4th October, 1858.
The Bank was incorporated by Act of Victorian Legislature on 24th
February, 1859, No, LXXIV., “An Act to Incorporate the Shareholders of the
National Bank of Australasia and other purposes.” Separate Acts of Incor-
poration were passed by the Parliaments of South Australia and Western
Australia.
On 15th August, 1859, the head office was removed from Queen Street to
premises in Collins Street West, on the site now occupied by Phair’s Hotel.
In 1866 the site of the present premises (then occupied by Messrs. Reynolds
& English, carriers, etc., and a timber yard, generally known as “Punche’s
Saw-Pit”) was purchased. The new premises were first occupied, and business
carried on there, on Monday, 19th September, 1870. The branch at Adelaide
was opened on Thursday, 2nd December, 1858, within two months of the open-
ing of the Head Office. The office in London was opened on 4th April, 1864, that
in Perth, Western Australia, on 23rd May, 1866, and the Sydney office in 1885.
Since those early days the Bank has grown and prospered, reflecting in its
development the mounting progress of the country, a tribute to the sure
foundations upon which it was built, and a credit to those responsible for its
management.
On sth September, 1918, meetings of the ordinary and preference share-
holders were held to consider the proposed scheme of amalgamation with the
Colonial Bank of Australasia Ltd. The amalgamation was approved, and the
subsequent poll resulted in the scheme being unanimously accepted by each
class of shareholders. Events have since proved the wisdom of this decision,
and have more than justified the claims which were made as to the advantages
which would accrue from amalgamation.
The Colonial Bank of Australasia commenced operations on 14th April,
1856, the first Directors being Hon. John O’Shanassy, M.L.A., Hon. Donald
Kennedy, M.L.C., Messrs. William Abercrombie, John Brown, Robert Caldwell,
Edward Cohen, W. P. Muir, Patrick Phelan, Robert Wharton.
The General Managers were Messrs. Thomas Elder Boyd, J. B. Bayne,
Adam Burnes, William Greenlaw, Selby Paxton, and James Wilson.
At the time of amalgamation the Bank had sixty-eight branches in Victoria,
and had, in addition, offices in London and Sydney.
Two of the Directors, Bowes Kelly, Esq. (Chairman), and the Hon. F'rank
G. Clarke, M.L.C., were appointed to seats on the Board of the amalgamated
Bank, and Mr. James Wilson, the General Manager, was appointed Deputy
Chief Manager of The National Bank of Australasia Limited.

Australia’s Part in the War
HUSTRALIA’S part in the Great War represented the whole-
souled contribution of a young Nation towards the maintenance
of those ideals for which the Allies fought. The valour of our
troops in the field, and the steadfastness of those at home who
backed the efforts of the fighting men, were glorious features of the struggle.
From the final victory, won at great cost, the Commonwealth has emerged
with a new status in the Empire partnership and a seat in the Councils of
the Nations.
The value of the Commonwealth’s share in the great conflict has been
generously appraised. Australians are content that the facts should speak
for themselves.
In the four and a-third years that hostilities lasted, Australia, with its
population of approximately 5,000,000, raised some 416,809 men by voluntary
enlistment, and sent 329,682 of them fully equipped abroad. Of the men who
enrolled, 59,258 laid down their lives for the cause.
There was no hesitation about Australia’s offer of co-operation when
hostilities broke out. No sooner had word been received of the Declaration
of War with Germany than the Naval Squadron was placed under the control
of the British Admiralty, and a beginning was made with the raising of an
Expeditionary Force of 20,000 men. While the first division was being
enrolled and trained, a Naval and Military Expeditionary Force sailed into
the Pacific and seized Germany’s New Guinea possessions.
On November 1, 1914, 40 Transports containing Australian and New
Zealand troops left Albany for an unknown destination. On the voyage
through the Indian Ocean, a glorious page in Australian naval history was
written by the destruction of the German Raider “ Emden ” in an engagement
with the Cruiser “ Sydney,” of the Royal Australian Navy.
The troops disembarked in Egypt on December 7, 1914, and the
historical landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula took place on the morning of
April 25. For eight months the Anzacs held on to a narrow strip of shell-swept
country with indescribable heroism, great courage, and remarkable endurance.
Then the evacuation was ordered, and on the night of December 19 and the
morning of December 20 they said farewell to the scene of their great adventure.


Four months later the Australians were in France, and then followed
years of titanic battles in which they took rank amongst the greatest fighters
of all ages. Fromellesand Pozieresin 1916, Bapaume, Bullecourt, Broodseinde,
and Passchendaele, capped by the stemming of the tide of the German advance
in 1918 before Amiens, and the capture of a considerable part of the
Hindenburg line, have passed into Australian military history.
On other fields —they fought in every theatre of war —and particularly
in Palestine, Australians won imperishable glory.
The Australians who served were not confined, however, to those who
took up arms, for the army in the field was splendidly supported by organisations
at home. While the fighting lasted funds were heavily subscribed for the
maintenance of the dependants of soldiers, and for the supply of comforts to the
men in the field. Women were tireless in their efforts. When the fighting was
over the w'hole of the people joined in supporting the demand that the men who
had offered themselves for Australia should not suffer for their self-sacrifice, and
it was this whole-hearted backing of the Nation that made it possible for the
Government to introduce a system of Repatriation which has more than
justified itself.
Cost of the War
WHAT Australia won by participation in the war is beyond all human
reckoning. Her greatest loss was the 59,000 of her gallant sons who
laid down their lives.
The cost of the war in £ s. d. is a huge sum which is continually being
added to by recurring expenditure, such as that on war pensions and repatri-
ation. The Public Debt of the Commonwealth, exclusive of the six States, in
1914 was /T 9,182,000. It rose during the years of the war to
and at June 30, 1920, stood at of which represented
the War Debt.
The interest on this huge load of indebtedness is a very large sum, and
imposes a burden upon the people of Australia which only hard work, increased
production, and a careful husbanding of resources will relieve.

Bank’s War Service Memorial
COMPLETE and very handsome Honor Board, showing the names of the Officers of the
Hank who enlisted for service abroad, including those of The Colonial Bank of Australasia
Limited, has been placed in the entrance vestibule at the Head Office, Melbourne, and was
unveiled on Tuesday, June 14th, 1921, by Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash, g.c.m.G., k.c.b., and
the following is a report of the proceedings :
SIR JOHN GRICE
Sir John Monash, Returned Soldiers, and Members of the Staff of the National and Colonial Banks. There is a
solemnity about our gathering here, because this is pre-eminently a gathering to do honor to those 90 Members of
our Staff who gave their lives for their Country. And there will be but few of you on reading this Roll of Honor
who will not recall the faces of some of your friends whom you have personally mourned in times passed. There
is, however, a bright side, which is that this gathering is also for the purpose of showing to the survivors of the 500
who went forth from our Staffs that the Directors, the Management, and the Shareholders of this Bank are not
unmindful of the risks they took, or of the hardships and the wounds which many of them endured and suffered. It
is, therefore, our desire to do honor to those who have returned, and to show how pleased we are to see some of
them here to-day.
The Directors regret very much that the exigencies of a large banking business have scattered a number of our
returned men throughout Australia, and consequently there is only a small percentage of them here to-day. Were it
not so I could say to them as I am now saying to you returned men here, how very proud the Shareholders were
of the number of them who volunteered, and of the manner in which they stood the test of war. As showing the
quality of the men who went forward from these two Banks which are now amalgamated, I may mention that 15%
of them gained commissioned rank ; many others obtained high distinction, and others, indeed, probably many others,
deserved distinction, but were not, perhaps, fortunate enough to obtain it. The Directors and the Management
considered what would be the best way of paying a high tribute to these men whom we are honoring to-day, and we
felt that this could be best accomplished by asking that great man, Sir John Monash. to consent to come here to-day
to unveil this Memorial Tablet.
Many people in Australia do not, I think, even now fully appreciate the great the very great service that
Sir John Monash rendered, not only to Australia, but to the British Empire. For he, at the head of the Australian
Corps in France, for several months prior to the great offensive was doing wonderful work as all of you who had
the honor and pleasure of having been with him at the time must have recognised, and he not only commanded but
he was the chief brains of the Corps. As showing what splendid work was done, I propose to read you from a book
which has been recently published by General Sir A. A. Montgomery, one of the members of the Staff of the Fourth
Army —not an Australian, but a British officer. He, in that book “The Story of the Fourth Army in the Battle
of the 100 Days, August Bth to November 11th, 1918” —'States that the Fourth Army’s victory in front of Amiens on
August Bth restored to the Allies the priceless weapon of the initiative. And the second paragraph in the first chapter
of the book records the following by one in a good position to judge, and gives his opinion of the work that the
Australians did during the months immediately preceding August Bth. It reads as follows :
“ While it is now realised that the moral effect of the successful attack of the Fourth Army on August Bth directly
influenced the fighting spirit of the whole of the British Army in France, it is not so generally known that
this victory could not have been won without the steady and continuous offensive of the Australian Corps
throughout the months of April, May, June, and July. To its remarkable achievements during these
months may be attributed to a very large extent the increase in morale, which was necessary in order
to make the battle of August Bth a complete success, or even a possibility.”
Now, Members of the Staff of the Bank, especially returned Soldiers, you all know that an army to have
accomplished such deeds as those, spread over a period of several months, could not have done it without their
head. No army could have achieved such distinctions unless under a great leader. Much of its success was due
to that great master mind—Sir John Monash —and it is he we have asked to unveil the Memorial to the returned
Soldiers to-day, and now, as he has so consented, I will call upon him to do so.
SIR JOHN MONASH
Sir John Grice, Old Comrades, Ladies, and Gentlemen, —I can assure you that it is a very great pleasure to
me to be here to-day, and I esteem it also a great honor to have been asked by the Directors and the Management
of this great institution to come here to perform the ceremony of unveiling this Honor Board. You may well
believe that I am sincere in what I say when you remember that in doing so I will gain the opportunity of assisting


to-day to honor all those splendid men whom it was my privilege to command in war. You may well believe also that
I cannot overrate the pride which I feel at having won and at having maintained their confidence throughout
the campaign. I have to thank Sir John Grice very warmly for the eulogistic terms in which he referred to the
humble part which I had to bear, but you must never forget that whilst it is true that an army requires a leader,
a leader can achieve nothing unless he has troops in whom he has confidence, and who have confidence in him.
I was very much impressed with the figures which Sir John Grice gave you of the enlistments from the
National and Colonial Banks. And they appeal to me from two separate points of view—firstly, that magnificent
total of over 500 enlistments must surely be a very high proportion of the total number of men of military age in
the service of the Bank, and it shows the marked and patriotic spirit of the Staffs wherever situated and wherever
the Bank’s activities are pursued. And then, secondly, that remarkably high percentage of men who achieved
commissioned rank —15% —a matter of something like 1 in 7, a proportion far higher than the ratio of officers to
other ranks of the Australian Imperial Force. And perhaps you will let me dwell on that reflection because I know
that most of the successes of the Australian Army Corps were due to the quality of the leadership of the officers,
and that quality depended upon the education of the officers. It was a striking fact in the A.I.F. that the supply of
suitable material for commissioned ranks never gave out. The Australian Army was unique among all the armies
at the Front in not merely facilitating promotion from the ranks to commissioned rank, but. indeed, in insisting
that satisfactory service in the ranks was a condition precedent for promotion to a commission. That was so
because we found an ample supply of material for commissioned officers, and these men were drawn from the
Universities, from the Public Schools, from the Commercial Colleges, and from financial and commercial institutions
of which this great institution is such a conspicuous example. It is a fact that in the A.I.F. the supply of able
educated men who had shown their capabilities for valiant service never gave out, and I think that is a proud
record which this Bank in common with other sister institutions may treasure. On an occasion like this it is
always invidious to mention names, but there is one of the Bank's former Staff who achieved great distinction,
and that is Brigadier-General J. C. Stewart. He was one of a memorable band of fifteen Infantry Brigade
Commanders who carried the Australian flag from victory to victory from July 4th up to the end of the war. I do
not think that in the whole record of the war there was a finer feat than that of the night march to a flank of
Stewart’s Brigade on the eve of the fall of Mont St. Quentin, and its subsequent assault upon and capture of the
town of Peronne, held by picked German troops. The bank has every reason to be proud of its contribution of
Brigadier-General Stewart to the distinguished leaders of the war. >
Sir John Grice, as a representative —and a senior representative —of the men who went abroad, I feel it my duty
on their behalf, and in particular on behalf of the officers of the Bank who served, to thank the Bank for the tribute
which it has paid in establishing this Honor Board, and particularly on behalf of the whole of the A I F. for that fine
Memorial that has been erected here in memory of the 90 men who went forth from the service of the Bank
never to return.
I shall now, in a moment, unveil this Board. I dedicate it to the respectful homage of all who pass this way.
Let it stand here for all the days to come as a tribute to the great sacrifice, loyal service and patriotic endeavour of
all the men whose names are inscribed upon its scroll,
CHIEF MANAGER : Mr. E. H. Wreford
Fellow Officers of the Bank —now falls to me a duty, Sir John Monash, which is one I avail myself of with very
great pleasure, to offer to you on behalf of the Board of Directors and the Management of the Bank and the assembled
Staff, a Booklet Memorial of to-day’s proceedings, and which is something greater than that because it enshrines
the portraits, names, and records of those 500 officers of the Bank who volunteered for service abroad. I have said that my
pleasure is great, Sir John Monash, in conveying to you our thanks for your presence here to-day, in the first instance it is
because of those personal Military successes which have caused His Majesty the King to convey to you many signal
marks of his appreciation and favour, marks which are familiar to all Australia. And our pleasure is greater when we
realise your kindness in coming to us to-day, and that the great Soldier is probably the greater Soldier, and achieved
so much at the Front because he is more than a Soldier, As Bankers we particularly welcome you because you are not
only a distinguished Soldier, but a distinguished Engineer, with in addition no mean knowledge of Law, and, last
of all, like many of your ancient race, a man of affairs and business.
I have little more to say. but in handing to you this little memento record, would like to add that the occasion
will be memorable to us because of those things which have been referred to by Sir John Grice, and no less memorable
to the Board of Directors and the Management of the Bank and to all those now assembled, because it is one that your
person and attainments are so intimately associated with.
SIR JOHN MONASH
Mr. Wreford, Sir John Grice, and Ladies and Gentlemen, you really overpower me with your marks of kindness
and appreciation. I cannot trust myself to do more than thank you very much and very sincerely,

The war record of the Bank is a stirring one, of which the Shareholders and
the Staff are justly proud. A large percentage of the Staff enlisted ; some, alas !
made the supreme sacrifice. Many notable distinctions were won in the field, and
those who finally returned with their honours thick upon them had the satis-
faction of finding that their interests had been conserved in their absence, and
that the Bank had played its part in maintaining stability at home, and was
entering the difficult after-the-war period, enjoying an even fuller measure of
public confidence, and with a greatly extended capacity for rendering valuable
public service.
War broke out at the end of July, 1914. The ordinary half-yearly meet-
ing of Shareholders was held on 3rd November, 1914, and the Directors’ Report
on that occasion, submitted by the Chairman, Sir John Grice, contained a
reference to the great struggle in which the Empire was engaged, and also some
observations on the financial position.
The call to arms was promptly responded to by officers of the Bank.
Before sth May, 1915, when the next meeting of the Bank was held, seventy-
nine members of the Staff had volunteered, and were either absent on military
leave or actually serving with His Majesty’s forces. The Chairman of Directors
in his report stated :—“We have made arrangements which will have the effect
of preventing them from suffering any nett loss of pay during their absence, and
of ensuring them a welcome back to our service at the conclusion of the war, and
without loss of status, of which action we know you will highly approve.’’
Under the arrangement that was made, the Bank allowed its officers leave of
absence for the period of the war service, and undertook to keep their places
open for them on their return, with the usual increases of salary, irrespective
of absence on war service.
It was at this meeting that the decision to instal in the Bank a “Roll of
Honour,” bearing the names of all who had given their services, was registered.
During the stirring days of 1915 officers of the Staff rallied to the colours,
and by the date of the next half-yearly meeting, 3rd November, 215 (equivalent
to nearly 20 per cent, of the pre-war Staff) had volunteered, and were helping
to defend their country. The Directors in their half-yearly report had the sad
task of calling attention to the loss of twelve members of the Staff who had been
killed in action up to that date. “In sacrificing themselves for their fellow


countrymen,” the report stated, “they had died a glorious death, and those who
grieve for their dear ones must at the same time feel very proud of their heroic
actions.”
In each succeeding report there was the same sad record of gallant men who
had laid down their lives, and also the inspiring story of others who had stepped
forward to take the places of the fallen.
It was a source of intense satisfaction to those “carrying on” at home to
learn from time to time that many members of the Staff were winning brilliant
distinctions. In circumstances of exceptional gallantry Lieut. R. T. V. Moon
(son of Mr. A. Moon, one of the Bank’s Senior Victorian Inspectors) won the V.C.
In the half-yearly report submitted on 7th November, 1917, the Directors and
the Staff placed on record their pride in the distinction of having in the Bank’s
service such brave men as Lieut, Moon and others had proved themselves to be.
The name of a lady also appeared in the list of distinctions. Miss Daisy Waddell
was in the London office. She went out as an ambulance driver, and was
awarded the French Military Cross and other decorations for special bravery.
In 1918 a second V.C. was won by an officer of the Bank, Corporal Arthur
Percy Sullivan. He greatly distinguished himself in operations in North Russia.
In commenting upon his brilliant achievement, the Chairman of Directors, in
the half-yearly report, said that he did not know' whether any of the Staff of any
other banking institution in Australia had been awarded the A T .C., but the record
of the Staff of the National Bank, who, out of 493 enlistments, had had con-
ferred on them two V.C.’s. was absolutely unique.
The record of gallant service and heroic sacrifices continued until the final
defeat of the enemy and the signing of the Armistice. “We offer to all those w'ho
have returned,” said the Chairman of Directors in addressing the Shareholders
on 26th November, 1919, “a hearty welcome and grateful acknowledgment, and
extend to them our wish that they may successfully continue in future life to
exercise all those high qualities which have won them honour and commenda-
tion in the fields of war.”
This hearty welcome was extended to the men on their return. Those who
resumed their duties were met with a hearty spirit of co-operation. In the
majority of cases where officers resigned from the Bank’s service on returning
from the war, their contributions to the Officers’ Provident Fund were returned
to them. In addition, special grants w'ere made to those in poor health, while
extended leave was granted to some to enable them to recover their health
before resuming duty.
While so many members of the Bank’s Staff were covering themselves with
distinction with the fighting forces, the Chief Manager and many other officers
of the Bank in the various States were doing what they could at home to sup-
port the fighting men, and on the various war loan committees, and with Red
Cross and other organisations, did much useful work. Among the activities

of the members of the Staff not serving at the Front was the organising of a
supply of periodicals and comforts to their fellows on active service, the cost of
which was borne by the Staff in Australia, assisted by donations from the Bank.
In Perth permission was obtained to plant trees along a drive in King’s
Park to form an “Avenue of Honour.” Photographs in these pages show the
avenue in the early stage of its formation, and illustrate the way in which the
names of the local officers who were killed or died of wounds arc commemorated
upon tablets affixed to the trees.
Other reproductions in this volume are of official photographs depicting
many historic sights and scenes. Battle-fields are shown upon which the A.I.F.
won imperishable glory, and where officers of the Bank gallantly served their
King and Country.

LIEUT. R. T. V. MOON, V.C.
l.icul. Moon is a son of Mr, A. Moon, one of the Bank’s senior Victorian Inspectors, and enlisted in Victoria
on 22nd August, 1914, at the age of twenty-two years. He went away with the 4th Light Horse Regiment,
subsequently transferring to the 58th Battalion.
Lieut. Moon was awarded the Victoria Cross “for most conspicuous bravery during an attack on an enemy
strong point.’’ Ilis exploit is thus officially described :
“His own immediate objective was a position in advance of the hostile trench, and thence against the hostile
trench itself, after the capture of which it was intended that his men should co-operate in a further assault on a
strong point further in rear. Although wounded in the initial advance, he reached his first objective. Leading his
men against the trench itself, he was again badly wounded and incapacitated for the moment. He nevertheless
inspired and encouraged his men and captured the trench. Lieut. Moon continued to lead his much-diminished
command in the general attack with the utmost valor, being again wounded, and the attack was successfully
pressed home. During the consolidation of the position, this officer was again badly wounded, and it was only after
this fourth and severe wound through the face that he consented to retire from the fight. His bravery was
magnificent,and was largely instrumental in the successful issue against superior numbers, the safeguarding of the
Hank of the attack, and the capture of many prisoners and machine guns.”
Lieut, Moon resigned from the Bank on Ist December, 1919.


CORPORAL ARTHUR PERCY SULLIVAN, V.C.
Corporal Sullivan is the son of Mr. and Mrs. A. M, Sullivan, Crystal Brook, South Australia, and before joining
the colours was on the Staff of the National Bank in South Australia, having served at Gladstone, Broken Hill
(New South Wales),and Maitland, die enlisted in April, 1918,having previously been unable to get away, and left
Melbourne in July of that year. He arrived in Kngland too late to participate in the fighting in France, but offered
his services when volunteers were wanted for the Archangel front, declaring that he must see some fighting before
he returned to Australia.
His was the first Victoria Cross won in North Russia. The special bravery for which he was awarded this
coveted distinction is reported as follows :
“After lighting a rear-guard action, the covering platoon was forced to cross the .Sheika River on a narrow
plank, and an officer and three men fell into the water. Corporal .Sullivan without hesitation dived into a deep and
treacherous swamp, and, despite the intense fire of the enemy, who were less than 100 yards distant, rescued his
four comrades, who otherwise would inevitable have been drowned, as they were unable to swim. This splendid
example of heroism was an inspiration to all ranks, who were on the point of exhaustion.”
Corporal Sullivan resumed Bank duty on the 9th February, 1920.


BRIG.-GENERAL J. CAMPBELL STEWART, D.S.O. and Bar, C.M.G.
Brig.-General Stewart enlisted on 17th August, 1914, and left with the First Expeditionary Forces, holding the
rank of Captain in the sth Battalion. He was wounded in the landing on Gallipoli, made a quick recovery, and,
returning to the Peninsula, remained on duty there until the evacuation, winning in the meantime his majority.
After the evacuation he was transferred to Egypt, where he was promoted to the rank of I.lent.-Colonel in
charge of the 52nd Battalion, hater, in France, he saw three years’ continuous service,
The following is an extract from The Times :
“When his battalion was ordered to fill a gap in the line caused by an enemy attack, he personally reconnoitred
the position in advance of his battalion under an intense enemy barrage. Though the* enemy were pressing forward
fresh troops and machine guns, by Ids courageous leadership and example he succeeded in filling the gap with his
battalion, consolidated the position in spite of very heavy fire, and held it until relieved. Theloval support which he
rendered to other battalions was in a great measure the cause of the success of the operations. On previous occasions
he has been largely responsible for the successes achieved by his brigade.”
Brig,-General Stewart has since resigned from the serv ice of the Bank.

Men and pack mules rounding Idiot Corner, on Westhock Ridge, in moving up to the front line, on 5th November, 1917. To follow the duckboard and cordurcy track
meant being silhouetted against the skyline, both from the Australian position and that of the enemy before he was driven from Broodscinde Ridge, but passage over any
part other than the top of the ridge was impossible owing to mud. At this point many transports and guns were wreeked by the constant shell tire, and others were lost in the
morass. One vehicle actually sank out of sight in the ooze a little to the right of the picture.
