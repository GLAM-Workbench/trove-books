I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU
AND YOU'LL GASP AND BE AGOG,
DON’T FEAR IT IS A DRAGON
IT’S ONLY A LITTLE DOG.
MANY DOGS ARE VERY TAME,
AND SOME ARE VERY SCOTTY,
BUT NO DOG COULD BE QUITE THE SAME
AS OUR LITTLE DOG, NAMED SPOTTY.
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY DOGS
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE-AGES,
BUT THE HISTORY OF OUR LITTLE DOG
IS IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES.


\ i
C2OCSiS.


for Spotty, a frolicsome dog,
for Playful as he leaps like a frog.
for Over the things he does jump.
for Tail, his little short stump.
for Touches of mirth that you’ll get.
for You, as you laugh at our pet.

THE BROWN BEAR IS USUALLY FOUND IN EUROPE, CENTRAL
ASIA AND ALASKA. THIS SPECIE IS SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN
THE BIG WHITE POLAR BEAR, BUT SOME OF THE ALASKAN BEARS
EXCEED TEN FEET IN LENGTH. THEIR COLOUR VARIES FROM
BROWN TO REDDISH AND SILVERY. THEY HAVE A SWEET TOOTH
AND OFTEN ROB BEES' HIVES TO GET HONEY. AND THEIR THICK
FUR PROTECTS THEM FROM THE BEES' STINGS.


SPOTTY STARED IN WONDER
WHEN HE SAW THE BIG BROWN BEAR
ROCKING ON HIS BROAD BACK
AND GAZING IN THE AIR.
THEN SPOTTY TRIED TO DO THE SAME
AND KNEW HE COULDN’T PAIL,
SO THEN HE GAVE A HAPPY BARK
AND BEGGED AND WAGGED HIS TAIL

THEY BELONG TO THE, CAT FAMILY, ARE AS BIG AS LIONS, AND
ARE FOUND IN MOST PARTS OF ASIA. THEY REST DURING THE
HEAT OF THE DAY AND ATTACK THEIR PREY, SUCH AS DEER,
ANTELOPES. WILD PIGS, CATTLE AND SMALLER ANIMALS. AT
NIGHT. TIGERS. WHICH ARE FOND OF SWIMMING, ARE AMONG
THE MOST FEROCIOUS OF BEASTS.


NEXT SPOTTY SAW AN ANIMAL
WITH STRIPES FROM HEAD TO TAIL,
BUT WHEN HE SAW THE TEETH IT HAD
HIS COURAGE STARTED TO QUAIL.
HE STAYED A LITTLE LONGER,
AND THE TIGER GAVE A ROAR,
SO TUCKING HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS
HE CRAWLED AWAY IN AWE.


LEOPARD
ALTHOUGH SMALLER THAN THE TIGERS THEY ALSO BELONG TO
THE CAT FAMILY. THEY ARE EXCELLENT CLIMBERS AND LIE
WAITING IN THE TREES TO POUNCE ON SMALLER ANIMALS, SUCH
AS DEER, ANTELOPES AND SMALL PIGS, ON WHICH THEY LIVE.
THEIR SPOTS BLEND WITH THE SURROUNDINGS. WHICH MAKES
IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE SEEN. THESE CUNNING ANIMALS
ARE FOUND IN DRY DESERT COUNTRIES, SUCH AS PERSIA.


WHEN SPOTTY SAW A HUGE PUSSY CAT
COVERED ALL OVER WITH SPOTS,
HIS HEART WEHT RACING WILDLY
AND HIS LEGS SEEMED TIED IN KNOTS.
POOR SPOTTY WAS SIMPLY TERRIFIED,
HE’D NEVER SEEN A LEOPARD BEFORE,
HE GAVE ONE HOWL AND BLINDLY FLEW
UP TO THE NEXT CAGE DOOR.

ELEPHANT
ELEPHANTS ARE THE LARGEST ANIMALS. THEY ROAM IN HERDS
IN BUSH COUNTRY NEAR LAKES. IN INDIA ARE USED TO HAUL
HEAVY LOADS. FULLY GROWN, REACH TWELVE FEET IN HEIGHT,
WEIGH SIX TONS. LIVE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY YEARS.


NEXT SPOTTY SAW THE ELEPHANT
AND COULDN’T BELIEVE HIS EYES
THAT THERE COULD BE AN ANIMAL
OF SUCH ENORMOUS SIZE.
IT HAS TWO TAILS, THOUGHT SPOTTY,
AND ITS COLOUR IS ALL GREY;
HE GAVE IT ORE MORE PUZZLED LOOK
AND SLOWLY WENT HIS WAY.

KANGAROO
4^:
FOUND IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW GUINEA ISLANDS. THE
LARGEST, THE "GREAT KANGAROO," STANDS SIX FEET HIGH.
THEY TRAVEL AT GREAT SPEED, SPANNING THIRTY FEET IN A
SINGLE LEAP. YOUNG ONES ARE CARRIED IN THEIR MOTHER'S
POUCH.


THEN SPOTTY GAVE A STARTLED YELP
AND REALLY SO WOULD YOU,
IF IT WERE THE FIRST TIME
YOU’D SEEK A KANGAROO.
\ /
SPOTTY TRIED TO IMITATE
AND HOPPED UP IN THE AIR
GUT CHANGED HIS MIND AND WALKED
AWAY
WHEN HE RECEIVED AN ICY STARE.


MONKEYS ARE FOUND LIVING IN THE TREES OF THE MAIN
JUNGLES OF THE WORLD. THESE MOST ACTIVE ANIMALS HAVE
LONG ARMS AND TAILS WHICH ENABLE THEM TO CLIMB GREAT
HEIGHTS FOR THEIR FOOD OF COCOANUTS AND BANANAS.


WHEN HE SAW THE MONKEYS
SWINGING IN THE TREE,
SPOTTY BARKED AND JUMPED ABOUT,
HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH GLEE.
HE LIKED THE MONKEYS VERY MUCH
AND WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY,
BUT HE BARKED A FAREWELL NOTE
AND WENDED ON HIS WAY.

HIPPO
HIPPOS ARE FOUND IN SWAMP COUNTRY AND SPEND THE
GREATER PART OF THEIR LIVES IN THE WATER. THE LARGER
ONES ARE FIVE FEET HIGH AND TWELVE FEET LONG. THEY LIVE
ON GRASSES AND WATER WEEDS. YOUNG HIPPOS ARE CARRIED
ON THEIR MOTHER'S BACK FOR PROTECTION AGAINST CROCO-
DILES. THEY LIE FOR HOURS IN THE WATER WITH ONLY fHEIR
EYES, EARS AND NOSES ABOVE THE SURFACE.


M
HE DIDN’T LIKE THE HIPPO
OR ITS GREAT BIG JAWS,
AND HOPED THAT IN THE HIPPO’S CAGE
THERE WASN’T OPEN DOORS.
THE HIPPO OPENED WIDE HIS MOUTH
TO GET HIS LUHCH OF HAY;
POOR SPOTTY THOUGHT IT WAS A CAVE
AND QUICKLY BACKED AWAY.

REACHING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTEEN FEET, GIRAFFES ARE THE
TALLEST ANIMALS. THEY LIVE ON LEAVES WHICH THEY OBTAIN
BY HOOKING INTO THEIR MOUTHS BY THEIR LONG TONGUES.
THEY ROAM IN HERDS ON THE AFRICAN PLAINS.


NEXT HE SAW THE BiG GIRAFFE
AND FELT JUST LIKE A SPECK
WHEN HE SAW THE FULL LENGTH
OF ITS ENORMOUS NECK.
HE TRIED TO MAKE IT DARK AT HIM,
AND THOUGHT ITS VOICE HAD GONE—
SO SPOTTY STRETCHED HIS LITTLE NECK
AND PROUDLY AMBLED ON.

THESE, THE LARGEST OF BIRDS, CANNOT FLY, BUT CAN RUN AT
A GREAT PACE AIDED BY THEIR WINGS. THEY ARE FOUND ON
THE AFRICAN AND ARABIAN PLAINS, WHERE THEY ARE HUNTED
FOR THEIR FINE FEATHERS.


THE OSTRICH SEEMED SO FUHNY
THAT SPOTTY ALMOST GROWLED,
BUT HE THOUGHT IT OVER QUICKLY
WHEN THE OSTRICH LOOKED AND
SCOWLED.
SO SPOTTY SAID IN “DOGGY” TALK
“YOUR LEGS AND NECK ARE NARROW
YOU MAY BE TWICE THE SIZE OF ME
BUT YOU'RE ONLY A BIG SPARROW.”

ZEBRA
THESE ANIMALS BELONG TO THE HORSE TRIBE AND FREQUENT
BAMBOO COUNTRY IN AFRICA, WHERE THEIR STRIPES BLEND
WITH THE SURROUNDINGS, MAKING THEM DIFFICULT TO SEE.
UNLIKE THE HORSE, THEY ARE OF LITTLE USE FOR CARRYING
SUPPLIES.


THE ZEBRA CAUGHT HIS EYE AT LAST,
IT LOOKED A FUNNY SIGHT,
HE DIDN’T KNOW IF THE STRIFES WERE
BLACK
OR REALLY, WERE THEY WHITE?
HIS INTEREST IN THE ZEBRA
HELD HIM THERE BY FORCE
BUT THEN HE WALKED ON THINKING
IT WAS JUST A PAINTED HORSE.


KOALAS
*c-«Br*
4
|Pg
FOUND IN AUSTRALIA, "NATIVE BEARS" HAVE A THICK FUR,
LARGE EARS AND NO VISIBLE TAIL. THEY CLIMB GUM TREES,
LIVING ON BUDS AND LEAVES. THEIR YOUNG ARE CARRIED ON
THE MOTHER'S BACK OR IN HER POUCH.


KOALAS WERE THE ONES HE LOVED,
SO HE THOUGHT IF HE WOULD DARE-
HE WOULD LIKE TO PLAY WITH ONE
A LITTLE “NATIVE DEAR.”
HE FELT HAPPY AS HE WATCHED THEM,
THEY WERE SO NICE TO SEE—
SO HE GAVE THEM ONE MORE FRIENDLY
LOOK
AND TODDLED HOME FOR TEA.


THE END


BY NOW ALL OF YOU CHILDREN
HAVE SEEN SPOTTY IN THIS BOOK,
BUT WHEN YOU SEE OUR NEXT ONE,
IT WILL MAKE YOU LOOK AND LOOK.
SPOTTY’S GOING TO THE CIRCUS,
A LIFE OF UPS AND DOWNS—
BUT HE’LL MAKE YOU LAUGH MORE OFTEN
THAN ALL THE CIRCUS CLOWNS.
