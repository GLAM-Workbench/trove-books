The of Australia and
Polynesia.
By J. G. 0. Tepper, F.L.S.
[From the Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia, 1892.]
[Read May 3, 1892].
INTRODUCTION.
The Phanbropterid.® of the tribe Locustodea in the Order
of the Orthoptera or Straight-winged insects are scattered over
all continents in a limited number of genera and species, but
seldom, if ever, occur in such numbers as to become destruct-
ive, although all are herbivorous. Many kinds are rare and
very rare, being perhaps restricted to small areas by the presence
or absence of particular food-plants, certain other insects, peculi-
arities of soil and climate, &c.
The family is, however, on this account very interesting to the
entomologist, and also on that of their peculiar structure,
notably the long slender limbs, angular or otherwise peculiarly-
shaped pronotum, regular venation of the anterior pair of wings,
usually called elytra (or tegmina) which afford good generic or
specific distinctions, and the usually short, curved, serrated
ovipositor of the females.
Of the habits of the Australian species, and perhaps of most
of the others, little appears to be known; the solitary life of the
widely scattered individuals rendering the elucidation of their
life-history very difficult.
The chief and most recent authoritative monographer of the
Phaneropteridse is Brunner van Wattenroyl, and since the
publication of the “ Addimenta,” 1891, to his excellent “Mono-
graphic der Phaneropteriden ” (Wien, 1878), no general work
appears to have been issued, nor any Australian species described.
In the following pages is presented a concise record of the
Australian representatives of the family as far as that is possible
under the circumstances. Genera and species, however, not
represented in the S. A. Museum will only be recorded, with
Brunner’s synoptical descriptions in English, while full descript-
ions will be given of the others from the specimens at disposal
and such information about habits and distribution attached as
is warranted by the author’s observations and experience.
The colour of living specimens is some shade or tint of
green in most genera, but is easily bleached by exposure to
sunlight as with preserved specimens, and wholly extracted


through immersion in alcohol, which changes the green into a
pale brownish-yellow. Colour is, therefore, a most unreliable
character to any one not familiar with the living insects,
although it may be perfectly constant for some species, or vari-
able with others; the latter is, however, comparatively rare with
indigenous forms. Killing with chloroform is apt to convert the
fuscous tints into more or less bright ferruginous shades. Some
species, again, are naturally of a testaceous colour, especially
those living among the dry grass during the latter part of the
very warm and dry summer, acting as a protective gift at a time
when scarcity of insect-life causes a keen search by insectivorous
birds.
One of the causes that so comparatively few of the Phanero-
pters find their way into collections is that they are extremely
brittle and delicate when dry, so that they are very apt to arrive
in a hopelessly fragmentary condition, and impossible to restore
to respectable appearance, or for safe determination.
Brunner’s types have been inaccessible, but his descriptions
and figures are so clear, that the chance of misinterpretation
does not appear to be very great. The new descriptions have
been drawn up on the same plan of Brunner’s, and, I hope,
will recommend themselves to your judgment. In several instances
the original descriptions have been slightly departed from, or
extended by adding some distinctive characters from the specimens
before me, preferring to extend the genus or species rather than
to form new ones.
The abbreviation “ Br. Mon.,” followed by figures, refers to
Brunner’s “ Monographie der Phaneropteriden,” Wien, 1878,
pp. 1-401, published by the K. K. Zool. and Botan. Society of
Vienna in their Transactions, which has been followed through-
out, and “ Br. Mon. Add.” to his “ Addimenta ” to the same in
1891 by the same Society (vol. XLL, part 1., pp. 1-196).
SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTION
Tribe Locustodea.
Tarsi depressed. Fore tibiae provided with foramina.
This tribe is divided by Brunner into 14 families, of which
the following is the first in order :■ —-
FAMILY PHANEROPTERIDtE.
First and second joint of tarsi laterally rounded. Prosternum
without appendages. Hind tibiae above with an apical spine on
both sides, below with two spines on each side.
The family is subdivided into 43 groups, with 164 genera, most
of which are illustrated by Brunner by a full figure or details of


one species. I add, here, another, making the total 165. The former
number embraces 685 species described by Brunner, of which 100
inhabit Europe, 150 Asia and the Malayan Archipelago, 95 Africa
and its islands, 52 North and Central America, 240 South America
and West India, 38 Australia, and 16 New Guinea and Polynesia.
Of 10 species the habitat was not known, and 15 species, including
3 Australian, inhabit two continents (one species being found
in three). Twelve species are, herein, added to the above (all
Australian), which raise the total for Australia to 50, and the
grand total to 697 species. In the following enumeration the
New Guinea, Polynesian and some other species have been
included, the former on account of their geographic proximity,
and the latter because so closely related to the Australian forms,
that their omission might have impaired the completeness of the
record.
The following characters are employed by Brunner, and have
been adopted by me as leading ones, viz.:—
1. The presence of a spine at the coxae (or hip-joints) of the
fore tibiae.
2. The form and armature of the fore tibiae on the upper side.
3. The form of the foramina (open, shell-like, or cleft-like) or
assumed auditory organs of the fore tibiae.
4. The character of the venation of the elytra.
5. The presence and form of the crenulations or dentations at
the apex of the ovipositor of the females.
6. The presence and form of the articulately-inserted styles of
the subgenital lamina of the males.
These prove very efficient in limiting and defining the groups
and genera, while Walker’s descriptions in the British Museum
Catalogue are, so far as the Locustodeae are concerned, wholly
inefficient for certain recognition, and therefore disregarded in
modern classification, especially as he includes the Phanero-
pteridae, Decticidae, Gryllacridae, &c., in one and the same family,
•of all of which he only mentions some 71 species altogether as
Australian.
Considerable increase in the number of indigenous species
may be expected in future, when those of the little explored
tropical parts of this continent become better known and
determined, for the warmest and warmer parts of the world are
the principal home of the Phaneropteridae. It is hoped that this
paper may contribute somewhat to incite more vigorous re-
searches.

This peculiar insect appears to be very local in its distribution.
The males are usually found on the trunks and thick lower
branches of Eucalypts (E. obliqua), or the stems of Eucalyptus-
shrubs where trees are absent, and in hot sunshine take readily
to their wings, but in cooler weather are rather sluggish. The
females are also found in similar situations, but more frequently
nearer (or on) the ground, among tufts of grass, sedges, or small
shrubs. , Their movements are slow, and when suddenly
approached or alarmed, rise as high as possible on their legs and
raise the elytra, at the same time extending the abdomen, thus
exposing the brilliant colouring, which, no doubt, serves to
ensure their safety from attack by birds, lizards, &c., as denoting
inedibility, for they make no attempt to fly or escape. When
taken by the hand, a copious brownish fluid is exuded from the
mouth, which stains the parts touched,
Habitat. —All the specimens in the Adelaide Museum are from
the Mount Lofty Ranges, where they are (or were) by no means
rare in some of the gullies watered by a rivulet, occu ring there from
January to March. In October, 1861, the author observed and
captured some at Bundaleer, where they frequented small
scattered clumps of stunted Eucalypts. They also are found in
Victoria, Hew South Wales, Queensland, and North Australia.

Vertex produced in the form of a pointed horn or crest-like tooth,
much elevated above the fastigium.

Habitat. —New Holland ( Serville) ; Brazil ( Burmeister,

mistake ; it may, however, occur in some of the Pacific Islands,
whence specimens may have found their way into the hands of
Australian collectors, and through them reached the great
French entomologist. The doubt requires to be cleared up,
hence the species is inserted here.
D. Group PSYR.<3E (Br. Mon. 19, 158).
Vertex flat or tumid, not spined. Fore tibhe with conchate
foramina in front and open ones behind. Elytra mostly of
leathery texture and more or less subhyaline, radial veins contig-
uous, transverse veinlets much raised. Ovipositor longer, or as
long as the pronotum, compressed, slender, gradually incurved,
apex gradually acuminate, at the base roundly tumescent,
margins crenulate or serrulate towards the tip, or rarely un-
armed. Subgenital lamina with or without free styles.
The group is chiefly of Asiatic habitat, a few genera belonging
to Africa, some species to the Sunda Islands, and one to New
Guinea.
Genus Casigneta, Brunner (Mon. 19, 163; fig. 46).
Fastigium of vertex contiguous in a line with the frontal.
Disk of pronotum subrotundate, deflexed lobes, roundly in-

produced styles, which are, however, absent, except in Dictyota r
where free ones are present
Almost wholly endemic and comprising seven genera.
Genus Ephippithyta, Serville ('ibid, 188).
Pronotum constricted before the midde, saddle-shaped. Hind
femora spined below throughout their whole length. Ovipositor
as long or slightly longer than the cerci.
Ephippithyta trigintiduoguttata, Serville (ibid, fig. 54).

Comparing the figure and descriptions of Brunner, usually
very exact, with Prof. McCoy’s (Prod. Zool. Viet., Dec. XII.,
plate 120: 1885) and the specimens in the Adelaide Museum it
is apparent that both the latter represent the same species, and
are distinct from the first, as shown by the detailed description
below. Prof. McCoy’s description takes no cognizance of the
venation of the elytra, nor the difference in the contour of the
wings. His figures are excellent, however.
Ephippithyta quadrigesimaguttata, sp. nov.
(A. trigintiduogutta, McCoy, Prod. Zool. Viet., 120).
Dull browinish-green, shining. Pace, lateral lobes of pro-
notum, and sides of meso- and meta-thorax with milk-white
stripes. Occiput blackish. Antennae basal part green for two-
fifths of entire length, remainder brown. Anterior part of
pronotum and hind angles blackish to black, also the extremity
of the shoulders of the elytra. Latter semipellucid, green, veins
much raised, the costal field near apex blackish, and from about
38 to 45 more or less intensely black guttae along the radial vein
(9-11), the hindmargin (7-10), and the anterior branch of the
ulnar vein (2-3). All the femora and tibiae are more or less
marked with black at the extremities, as are also the tips of the
spines. The hind tibiae have three broad blackish bands on the
inner side, the terminal one extending to the tarsi.

This species differs from E. 32-guttata, Serville, by the elytra
being much more suddenly contracted beyond the middle; the
colours of the marginal space, the greater number, disposition
and intensity of the guttfe, the different curvature of the first
radial branch and the colour of the antennae. After death the
body, legs, and parts of the elytra become more or less brown,
and in alcohol the whole insect assumes a pale testaceous tint,
except the dark spots.
The insect feeds on the Australian Cyprus Pine (Callitris
verrucosa), and is but seldom seen. The three specimens in the
Adelaide Museum were obtained at Monarto and Sandy Creek.
At the former locality the writer captured three specimens close-
together on one tree in 1872.
Genus Ephippithytoidea, gen. nov.
Pastigium of vertex terete, not much depressed, sub-contiguous
with the frontal. Pace moderately long, much retracted, slightly
sulcate laterally, carinate about the eyes. Pronotum saddle-
shaped, constricted, disk rounded posteriorly. Deflexed lobes
roundly-inserted in front and angular behind, and distinctly
sulcate. Elytra narrow-linear, hindmargin concave, nearly of
equal width throughout, apex rounded; radial veins contiguous
for some distance beyond the first radial branch; the latter is
emitted slightly before the middle and forked towards its
extremity ; anterior ulnar vein parallel with radial branch emit-
ting four branchlets to hindmargin. Transverse veinlets much
raised, numerous, oblique, and closely reticulate. Tympanal
area small, veins very strong, and a speculum in both elytra of
the male. Wings as long as the elytra, apex rotundate. Fore
and middle femora near apex with a few small spines and
distant short hairs, hind femora armed nearly to the base, knee-
joints with long spinose lobes, basal part very much incrassated,
apical part very slender. Pore tibia; with rimato-conchate
foramina on both sides, terete above, posterior margin spined.
Meso- and meta-sternum with short broad lobes. Supra-anal
lamina of males deflexed between the hairy cerci; latter stout,
bilobed at apex. Subgenital lamina in two lobes very thick in
the middle, styles not apparent. Female unknown.
This genus differs from all others by the subtriangular lobes of
the pronotum, the latter being convex above, besides many other
distinctions. In general appearance, however, it resembles
Ephippithyta so much that a superficial observer may easily
mistake it for a smaller variety.
Ephippithytoidea spaesa, sp. nov.

in the middle, two small spots below the same, a short stripe
on either side, the base of the antennae, and the cheeks pale
yellowish. Eyes prominent, globose, dark brown. Pronotum,
fore and middle femora and tibiae, also the hind femora near the
base blackish above, with very numerous pale round dots;
exterior of hind femora with two black lines contiguous with
black bars beyond; knee-joints black, also both extremities of
hind tibiae and an intermediary band. Abdominal segments
partly blackish banded. Elytra sub-pellucid, veins ochraceous,
reticulating veinlets mostly whitish, except within some black
spots along the radial and ulnar veins, of which there are
about 12-14. Wings dusky.
Male.
Habitat. —Roebuck Bay, Western Australia (Messrs. A. E.
Krapton and Tepper , jun.). A single specimen was captured in
November, 1891.
Genus Alectoria, Brunner (female), (Mon. Add. 10, 95; fig. 15).
(Synonym, Hectoria, Tepper (male) (Trans. Roy. S. A, vol. XL)
Pronotum deeply constricted before the middle and crested
behind. Crest with short tumid base, hollow, open below where
projecting beyond the base, laterally with five diverging curved
veins ending in the inferior hindmargin ; anterior margin of
pronotum with a smaller spine and a larger on each side behind
the anterior constriction in the male. Elytra rugulose, first
radial branch emitted much behind the middle, simple. Sub-
genital lamina of male deeply and roundly emarginate. Ovipositor
short, not longer than cerci,
Brunner’s description of the genus is taken from the female,
alone, mine (loc. cit.) from the male, the latter supplementing
the former in various details. In Brunner’s figure the crest is
represented with subparallel concentric lines of veins, while in
my specimens they appear as described above, the eyes are
also much larger than shown by the figure. Further, the fastig-
ium of the vertex is declining and not at all prominent. The
antenme have the tips black, and five very narrow blackish rings
at equal distances, the last about the middle, from thence to the
base they are absent and the colour uniformly pale-green. The
elytra have the margins almost parallel, narrowing very slightly
to the obliquely truncate apex, not suddenly narrowed beyond
the middle. The tympanal area of the elytra of the male is
ample in both, the transverse plicate vein in the left elytron is,

Brunner’s description of the male agrees very well with the
specimens in the Adelaide Museum, including females, and larvse
and nymphs of both sexes, which were obtained in January and
March, 1884, by the author at the above localities respectively
(also an adult male). The following characters are supplement-
ary. The pro thorax, legs and antennae are wholly ferruginous,
the abdomen purplish, the elytra pale ferruginous in front of
the radial veins, the colour extending partly to the costal margin
and also to the base and margin of the triangular ulnar area, the
remaining spaces being pale green, the colours shading gradually
into each other. The dark spotted borders are very narrow, and
the knee-joints of the femora blackish or brown.
Caedicia concisa, Brunner , (ibid, 192).
Bright green. Pronotum and tympanal area not spotted.
Anterior margin of elytra bordered with ferruginous, remainder

As neither the description, so far as given by Walker and
McCoy, nor the excellent figures of the latter appear to agree
with any of Brunner’s species or those in the Adelaide Museum,
this species {Phaneroptera valida , Walker and McCoy) is recorded
here, although somewhat doubtfully, as some of the requisite
characters (venation) are not included in the original descriptions.
The figures of McCoy, however, plainly denote its position in
this genus.
Caedicia longipbnnioides, spec. nov.
Size large. Olive-green, abdomen much duller. Disk of
pronotum wider behind, lateral margins narrow, pale testaceous;
deflexed lobes of pronotum wide behind the middle, lower
margin slightly sinuate, posterior rounded. Elytra subpellucid,
with irregular subparallel veinlets, which are distinct and darker
than the inclosed membrane. First radial branch forked in the
middle, with two, sometimes three, simple ones beyond. Cerci
of male incurved, so that the tips touch or sometimes cross each
other. Subgenital lamina neither very acute nor narrowed.
Ovipositor of female about half the length of the disk of pro-
notum.

Habitat. —-Yam Creek, North Australia (Prof R. Tate , March,
1882.
This species differs from all others within the group by the
short stiff tomentum with which most parts are invested, and by
the ulnar vein being branched and forked. There are only two
male specimens, which originally may have been green, but
through long immersion in alcohol, have become uniformly pale
testaceous in colour. When the female is discovered it may perhaps
be necessary to form a new genus for the reception of this species.
Caedicia roseopennis, spec. nov.
Green and ferruginous. Size small. Vertex flat. Eyes glob-
ose, brown with black markings. Head purplish, pronotum,
legs, abdomen, and the elytra in part ferruginous, remainder of the
last green. Disk of pronotum bordered purplish-brown laterally,
Deflexed lobes angularly inserted, much higher than long, lower
margin subsinuate. Elytra resembling those of Symmachis in
outline and venation, disk with small, remote, dusky spots along
the middle, hindmargin with minute, crowded black dots. First
radial branch forked much before the middle, second simple,
third indistinct, much bent and ramified. Tympanal area of
male very short, plicate veins irregular and enclosing a sub-
circular opaque area of dark-brown colour. Wings transparent,
pale rose-colored, except towards apex, veinlets green. All fem-
ora wholly unarmed, marked with fuscous stripes exteriorly.
Fore tibise subterete above, with a few spinelets below towards
apex. Meso- and meta sternal lobes subrotundate, latter much

Habitat. —Cooke’s Plains, east of the Lower Murray River,
where one female and four males were captured by the author on
January sth, 1887. The insects appeared to feed on Bursaria
spinosa.
This species resembles Symmachis considerably in outline and
venation of the elytra, and also in the form of the deflexed lobes
of the pronotum, it also appears to exhibit affinities with G. inermis
and C. hispinulosa ; from all of which it differs by the rosy colour
of the wings, the form of the lobes of the pronotum, the unarmed
femora, &c.
Oaedicia porrecta, Brunner (Mon. Add. 96).
Dull olive-green. Eyes oblong. Pronotum with the disk very
flat, scarcely wider behind, lateral ridges brownish red, deflexed
lobes highest beyond the middle. Elytra wider than the length
of pronotum, the first radial branch forked in the middle and
again near its end. Hind tibiae sulcate above and unarmed,
excepting the apical spine. Hind femora spined towards the
apex. Ovipositor very short.

Genus Symmachis, Brunner (Br. Mon., 21, 199).
Fastigium of vertex obtuse, horizontally contiguous with die-

branch forked in the middle, tympanal area of male very shor-
Brunner established the genus upon the male only. I consler
a specimen of a female in the Adelaide Museum as appertafing
to this genus ; it has served me for the following description.
Symmachis lacteipennis, Brunner (ibid, fig. 57).
Whitish green. Head, pronotum, and femora whitish. Lo r er
margin of deflexed lobes of pronotum semi-circularly rouned,.
gradually passing into hindmargin. Elytra pale-green, pelluid,
postradial vein much curved at apex, terminating in hindmarin;,


first radial branch forked before the middle, second and third
simple ; ulnar vein much branched, forked at its termination,
reaching hindmargin one-third from apex ; primary transverse
veinlets net-like branched. Tympanal area simple, without trans-
verse, raised veins, a small brown spot at the base opposite to
another near hind angle of disk of pronotum and a third at the
termination of the plicate vein. Anterior tibise near foramina
and at the base, also the ulterior lobes of anterior tarsi, fuscous.
Ovipositor short, broadly lanceolate, acute, hirsute (as well as
cerci, which it scarcely exceeds), disk shining, margins most
minutely serrate at and near apex. Subgenital lamina very
short, sub-triangular.

Habitat. —Murray Bridge, South Australia, where the female
was captured by Mr. C. Poare during the early part of April,
1891. The insect appears to be rare.
Notwithstanding the discrepancy of the smaller size of the
female, which may be due to dwarfing or locality, and other
differences, hesitation to form a new species seems to be justified
in this case, until more material comes to hand.
Genus Dictyota, Brunner (Br. Mon. 22,-199).
Pectus compressed. Meso- and meta-sternal lobes longer than
broad. Deflexed lobes of pronotum highest beyond the middle,
inferior margin emarginate over the coxse. Elytra with the
transverse veinlets in close parallel lines in the marginal area.
Base of hind femora very slender.
Besides the above synoptical characters the genus is distin-
guished by the short vertex, the high ridges surrounding the
antennae, which exceed the frontal vertex considerably, and the
sharply angular pronotum.
The exceptional character of free styles in connection with the
subgenital lamina connects this genus with several other groups
notably the Eurypalp.® (monotypic) from Borneo, Sumatra, &c.
Dictyota yiridissima, Brunner (Br. Mon., 199).
Bright-green and whitish. Pronotum with rough, transverse,
lateral ridges very minute or absent. Elytra in the middle about
one and a-half times as wide as the length of the pronotum ;
transverse veinlets in the marginal area rather remote, radial
branch forked in the middle. Size small.

The species is allied to D. viridissima, Brunner, but differs chiefly
in proportions, the four simple radial branches, and the compara-
tively short hind tibiae.
Dictyota costulata, Brunner (ibid, 201).

The species is allied to D. prtoinosa, but differs in size, colour,
proportions, the branches of the radial vein, its termination in
the apex, &c.
Genus Polichne, Stdl. (Br. Mon. 22, 202).
Front prominent, elongate. Eyes very oblong. Elytra linear,
narrowed. Deflexed lobes of pronotum longer than wide, with
the hind margin much rounded. Hind margin of meso- and
meta-sternum truncate. Base of hind femora not dilated, wholly
unarmed.
The genus has the aspect of Tylopsis , an Old-World genus
forming a monotypic group, on account of its long forehead, the
long narrow lobes of the pronotum and narrow elytra, but its
other characteristics place it among the Ephippithyt^e.

(S.E.), South Australia; Dimboola, Caromby, (JST.W.) Victoria
(Tepper) ; Sydney, Hew South Wales; North Australia; Lord
Howe’s Island (Brunner).
The species varies considerably in colour, viz., from bright-
green to pale-testaceous, apparently due to its surroundings or
the food taken, for among the green grass no pale specimens, nor
among the dry later in season any green ones, appear to be
taken. The dark-brown or purplish bordering of the pronotum
is, however, constant. The individuals, although never numerous,
are not rare in grassy scrublands and fields from January to
March. There are some ten specimens in the collection at the
Adelaide Museum, six of which are green, the others pale, both
comprising both sexes.
Polichne ferruginea, spec. nov.
Size somewhat smaller than the preceding. Feurnginous.
Face, pectus, and femora rather pale. Meso- and rmta-notum
testaceous. Elytra very narrow, rounded at apex, posterior
radial vein forked at apex, both branches curved and temiinatin


in the hind margin ; transverse veinlets much raised, oblique or
at right angles, crowded in ulnar area except at base. Veins and
veinlets of the wings ferruginous. Cerci straight, divergent.
Supra-anal lamina deeply emarginate. Ovipositor rather long,
slightly shorter than the valves.

The species is described from a single specimen obtained by
Mr. E. Guest at Balhannah, but appears to be sufficiently dis-
tinct to merit specific rank. It has to be mentioned, that among
the individuals placed under P. parvicauda by the author, there
is a testaceous form with short elytra, comparatively broad, and
more rounded at the apex, than those of the green ones. These
may ultimately prove to form a separate species.

Genus Taeniomena, Brunner (ibid).
Synonym, Tinzeda, part, Walker (Brit. Mus. Cat.)
Hind femora unarmed below. Deflexed lobes of pronotum
longer than wide, lower margin nearly straight. Ovipositor dis-
tinctly serrulate.
Besides these, the principal distinctions are the narrow pointed
elytra, with white stripes; the long slender legs, and the long
attenuated ovipositor.
Taeniomena albosignata, Brunner (ibid, 204, tig. 60).
(Tinzeda eburnina , pars. ?, Walker).
Yellowish-green. Face whitish; a bright-white line in the
middle of the pronotum, along the lower margin of the deflexed
lobes, along the costal margin of the elytra, the interior side of
the radial vein, and at the base of the tympanal area of the left
elytron; the costal margin and the radial vein being also narrowly
marked with a ferruginous border, and the base of the post-
ulnar vein with a blackish streak. Deflexed lobes of pronotum
much longer than high, hind angle rounded. Elytra very narrow,
much acuminate, not extending beyond the ovipositor of female,
but much longer in male. Baclial veins distant at base and apex,
contiguous intermediately. First radial branch not forked,
following one or two simple. Anterior-ulnar vein straight,
parallel with radial, long. Tympanal area of male with a stout
plicate vein, which is much raised in left elytron, and joined to
a semicircular continuation posteriorly. Wings slightly longer
than elytra. Fore femora below unarmed, or with a few minute
black spines. Subgenital lamina of male narrow, hindmargin
roundly emarginate. Ovipositor long and broad, gradually
acuminate, finely serrated towards apex for the third part of its
length.

dale (December 24, 1891, L. Campbell), Adelaide, South Aus-
tralia ; Sydney, New South Wales; Port Denison, Queensland
( Brunner ).
This species is at once recognisable by the elytra of the female
scarcely exceeding the ovipositor, and the roundly emarginate sub-
genital lamina. There are two females and one male in the
Adelaide Museum. The ova are elongate-oval and almost flat,
being 4 mm. long, 2 mm. wide, and brownish-grey.

Taeniomena soror, Brunner (Br. Mon., 204).
Bright-green ; similarly marked, but larger than the preceding.
Deflexed lobes of pronotum much higher behind the middle.
Elytra in both sexes much longer than hind femora, without the
border of dark dots along the radial white line. Fore femora
distinctly spined (3-5). Subgenital lamina very elongate, hind
margin cleft. Ovipositor not much curved, very flat, very
slightly narrowed, toward apex serrulate-dentate, brown, the
remainder pale- to dark-green.

Habitat.- —Mount Lofty Range, near Adelaide (two females
one male), Roseworthy scrub (one male), South Australia.
The species is readily recognizable by the sub-triangular form
of the deflexed lobes of the pronotum (which are much wider
than in T. albosignata), and the elytra extending considerably
beyond the hind femora. Both are distinguished from all other
described species by the long slightly-curved ovipositor. The
leaves of Bursaria spinosa appear to supply the food of T. soror ,
all the specimens were found on those bushes.
One of the males placed in this species has the anterior vein
furnished with three distinct branches, and the subgenital lamina
deeply cleft, although otherwise resembling the other. In the
absence of more material it was not thought advisable to form
another species.
Taeniomena sororoides, spec. nov.
Pale - green to testaceous, marked with ivory stripes like
T. albosignata , the stripe of the pronotum extending triangularly
over the head to the vertex of the fastigium, and those of the
marginal and radial areas (along the posterior border) are marked
more or less distinctly by irregular, minute, black or dusky dots.
Deflexed lobes of pronotum narrow, oblique, as high or higher
than long, and highest at or slightly beyond the middle, lower
margin sub-semicircularly rounded. Elytra narrowed from near
the base. Plicate vein of the tympanal area of male prominent
and oblique on left elytron. Subgenital lamina with base of
emargination cleft, apices incurved. Ovipositor shorter and
more incurved than in T. soror , finely and closely dentate at
and near apex.

Habitat. —Mannum, Leigh’s Creek, Western Plains, Port Pirie
Parallana and Adelaide (?), South Australia.
This species is distinguished from others by the shorter more
curved ovipositor and the high, narrow, oblique lobes of the pro-
notum. There are four males and as many females in the col-
lection, all more or less bleached and two totally so through
immersion in alcohol, the colour is therefore uncertain, the line
of blackish dots along the radial ivory-line is, however, quite
constant. As the specimens have been gathered from such
distant localities, the matching of the sexes is not quite beyond a
doubt.
Taeniomena lobata, Brunner (Br. Mon., 205).
Pale-testaceous. Front and sides of face, base of antennal,
middle line and lower half of lobes of pronotum, broad border of
marginal area, underside of pectus, and the thick part of hind
femora almost white ; lateral border of pronotum, a short streak
near base of anterior radial vein, post-ulnar vein from tympanal
area along nearly the entire length of hindmargin of elytra, the
branch at the plicate vein, and a streak on the upper side of the
hind femora are blackish. Vertex of fastigium much pointed, and
beak-like produced. Bases of antennae verystout and subcontiguous
with the fastigium. Disk of pronotum more or less flat, the
deflexed lobes small, narrow, the hind angle produced as a long
keeled lobelet (keel blackish). Elytra with radial and ulnar
veins very remote at the bases. Tympanal field of male short,
plicate vein in both elytra not much raised. All femora unarmed.
Cerci of male long semicircularly incurved. Subgenital lamina
semicircularly emarginate, nearly as long as the cerci. Ovipositor
much longer than pronotum, semicircularly-incurved, flat, broad,
acuminate, shining, apex blackish or brown, both margins near
apex serrulate or dentate (smooth in the nymph-stage). .

Habitat. —Tanunda, Riverton, Mount Bryan, South Australia;
Coromby, N.W. Victoria (Tepper); New South Wales (Brunner).
The species is distinguished from all the others by the upper
angle of the posterior margin of the narrow lobes of the pro-
notum being produced into a keeled lobelet, and the pale colour;
both of which characters and the general aspect are so abnormal
for the genus, that the formation of a separate one for its recep-
tion and, perhaps, that of T. minor, mihi, might be permissable.
The insects are not very rare, and live among the dry grass from
November to January. There are one male (without hind
femora) and three females (one a nymph) in the Adelaide
Museum.
Taeniomexa Fraserensis, spec, nov.
Moderately large. Head, base of antennae, legs and underside
of pectus pale-glaucous-white. Antennae testaceous. Eyes
brown. Disk and lobes of pronotum, also marginal area of
elytra glaucous, remainder of latter olive-green. Abdomen
above brownish-black, terminal segment whitish, underside, &c.,
brownish-testaceous. Palpi and tarsi green. Disk of pronotum
almost flat, wider behind, deflexed lobes as high as long, lower
margin semicircularly rounded, widest in the middle, white border
nearly obsolete. Elytra widest at base, transverse venules very
distinct, crowdedly reticulate in the marginal area ; radial veins
widely separate at base, then closely contiguous, and again separ-
ating considerably somewhat beyond the middle. White lines
broad, the posterior bordering of dark-reddish or blackish dots,
strife very distinct; posterior margin entirely bordered with
brown. Tympanal area green, short; plicate vein pale, straight,
much raised (but not branched), shining. Fore femora with two
or three spinelets, hind femora with five or six. Cerci semicircu-
larly incurved, sharply acuminate, tips black. Subgenital lamina
not as long as the cerci, posterior margin triangularly emarginate,
apex of lobe acuminate.
Male.
Habitat. —Fraser Range, interior of Western Australia.
The remarkably bright colouring, the form of the lobes of the
pronotum, the emargination of the subgenital lamina, and the
venation of the elytra separate this species from the others. Some
specimens of T. sororoides, mihi, from Parallana, in the far
north of South Australia, resemble it in size and general
aspect; but the form of the lobes is different, and the radial

Taeniomena minor, spec. nov.
Grass-green, face paler. White lines along radial vein and the
base of tympanal area wholly obsolete, Disk of pronotum some-
what concave, middle white line continued to vertex of fastigium.
Deflexed lobes longer than high, wider behind, inferior margin
nearly straight, with narrow white border. Elytra brownish at
apex, medial-plicate vein of tympanal area strongly raised, almost
transverse; shoulder-vein very marked; hindmargin of area
sharply curved, brownish. Fore and middle femora and tibia;
almost unarmed ; hind femora entirely so. Cerci of male incurved,
subgenital lamina rather widely cleft, tips incurved. Ovipositor
widest at base, gradually acuminate, much curved, near apex
finely dentately serrate.

Habitat. —Callington, South Australia (Tapper), feeding on
Acacia calami/olia, November 25, 1887, and apparently limited
to sandy scrublands.
This species differs from others by the total absence of the
white line along the posterior radial vein, its slender form of
body, and several other characters.
Genus Elephantodeta, Brunner (Br. Mon., 22, 206).
(Tinzeda , pars., Walker).
Hind femora spined below. Deflexed lobes of pronotum
equally high and long, lower margin rounded. Ovipositor
broadest in the middle, the margins very minutely serrated.
Wholly restricted to Australia.
The genus resembles Dictyota, on account of the whitish dust
covering the forepart, and Taeniomena, in the corneous bordering
of the base of the elytra, also in the absence of the apical spine
of the fore tibiue (which is usually the last to disappear); but
differs in the characters indicated above. The generic name refers
to the ivory-like border of the elytra.

Elephantodeta faeinosa, Brunner (ibid).
Size moderate. Head, pronotum, and base of femora whitish or
glaucous-green. Disk of pronotum rounded, with a faint whitish
or yellowish line in the middle. Elytra pale grassy- or olive-
green, the frontal margin at the base of the marginal area hoary
in the male, milky-white in the female, with a short dark streak
on the inner edge at the shoulders. Abdomen of female banded
alternately green and purplish-brown, the latter tint usually
narrower than the former. Ovipositor green at base, remainder
brown, apex darkest; broad, compressed, semicircularly curved,
apex much elevated, finely dentate at the underside, total length
about one and a half times that of the pronotum.

This species differs from the preceding one in smaller size, pro-
portion of length of ovipositor to that of pronotum, the pale
medial line of the latter, &c., and is widely distributed in the
southern parts of South Australia, where the other appears to be
absent. There are seven females and one male in the Museum
collection, and it is a curious fact, that in three specimens of the
former, the first radial branch is forked beyond the middle, in
the right elytra, but simple in the left, while the other four
specimens exhibit normal and symmetrical venation

O. Geoup PHANEROPTERJE (Br. Mon., 23, 209).
Hind tibiae spined above or unarmed, the apical present
only at the external margin. Fastigium of vertex acuminate.
Elytra linear or lanceolate, mostly longer than the wings. Fore
and middle tibiae smooth above, excepting the apical spine
(characters also applying to numerous other groups, containing
Old World species almost exclusively). Elytra very narrow, radial
veins distinctly separated at the base. Subgenital lamina of
male without styles, or, if present, extremely minute.

the male. Elytra with the hindmargin straight or sub-rotundate.
All femora unarmed below. Wings much longer than the elytra.
The 11 species of this genus inhabit Europe, Asia, Africa,
some of the Malayan islands, and a single is recorded by Brunner
from “North Australia;” whether rightly so or not must for the
present remain doubtful until specimens have come to hand from
there.
