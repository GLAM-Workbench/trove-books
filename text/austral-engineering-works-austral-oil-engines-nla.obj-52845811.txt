A Few Remarks Worth Noting.
THE AUSTRAL ENGINEERING WORKS combine
Australian ingenuity with Bri ish stability, skilled
labour, careful construction, expert supervision, up-to-
date methods and management.
If anyone requiring motive power will write and
explain what they desire to drive, we may be able to
advise them to advantage, having had a wide range of
experience in this particular line.
Customers can always see their Engines in course of
construction, and also under brake and indicator tests.
Printed instructions go with every engine.
THE AUSTRAL ENGINE is without a parallel for
simplicity. Anyone can start it after being shown once.
Past experience proves that continuous use of. lamp
is a source of risk and trouble. With the AUSTRAL
this is overcome, and the engine starts with certainty
and. ease after using lamp for a few minutes only.
Experienced men sent to fix and start our Engines

To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs, —
The 5 B.H.P. Austral Oil Engine and Chaffcuttor we
purchased from you this year has given us every satis-
faction, and we can recommend them to anyone who re-
quires a first-class and up-to-date plant. The engine
has never given us any trouble. Trusting you will meet
with the success you deserve.

Rokewood.
To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs, —
We have great pleasure in stating that the B.H.P.
Engine which you supplied us in May last is doing
splendid work, driving our 4 in. centrifugal pump, and
bringing up a full pipe of water to 28 feet at a far less
cost than steam power. It needs little or no attention,
and we would strongly recommend anyone requiring an
inexpensive and economical plant for pumping, &c., to
go in for an Austral Oil Engine. Wishing you every
success.
Yours truly.

Engineers, Ballarat.
Dear Sirs, —
Re the plant purchased by us from you some time
ago, a 5 B.H.P. Portable Oil Engine, Chadcutter, and
Duplex Dumper, we wish to state that everything is
going satisfactorily. We have no trouble in putting
over 90 lbs. of chaff in a bran bag. The engine is
capable of driving the cutter and bagger filled to its
utmost capacity, and we will be pleased to advise any-
one going in for a plant that they could not do better
than trade with your firm, as we fell confident that they
would secure the highest value and satisfaction by doing
so. Wishing you every success in your up-to-date busi-
ness.
McELDREW BROS.


Rupanyup.
To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs', —
The 5 B.H.P. Portable Oil Engine I bought from you
last year is giving me complete satisfaction. It works
very smoothly, and requires very little attention. The
3-knife chaffcutter is also a good machine, and I find the
transport attachment for chaffcutter and elevator com-
bined a great convenience.

Re the 12 in. mouth Three Knife Chaffcutter, with

I have much pleasure in forwarding you my testimony
of the 3J 8.11. P. Austral Oil Engine which I purchased
from you. Although I have had no previous experience
in working engines I have not lost any time with it. It
is quickly started and runs very smoothly. I have
much pleasure in recommending it to anyone requiring
a cheap and effective power, and shall be glad to show
it to anyone at work. lam driving No. 2 Chaffcutter

Dear Sirs, —
We are highly satisfied with the Corncrusher nurchas-

have ever used for general crushing, and we can con-
fidently recommend it and any of your gear to intending
purchasers.
SULLIVAN BROS.
Kingston.
To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs, —
Re your enquiries as to the performance of the Hay-
stacker, there is no comparison between it and he old
method of forking sheaves on to a stack. It will do
the work of four men easily, and we have used it for
two years, and can stack 40 tons per day. With one
man stacking it would send up 100 tons of sheaves a
day. We stacked 1500 tons this season with it.
Yours truly,

satisfaction it has given us. She is an exceptionally
light-running machine, and strong where it is necessary,

Ballarat School of Mines,
13th July, 1900.
To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT, Ballarat.
Dear Sirs, —
I think it would- be but fair to you, and to the
public generally, who may be interested in oil engines
and pumps, to say that, after working the two oil
engines -and the two plunger pumps, which I bought
from you, I proved they possessed all the good
qualities claimed for them, viz., easy to under-
stand, easy to regulate, economic in oil, thoroughly re-
liable, and up to power. The pumps also done excellent
work, and fulfilled the conditions of their purchase in a
most satisfactory manner.
Yours very truly,

RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs, —
Regarding the 5 H.P. Oil Engine, Saw-bench, and 3-
knife Chaffcutter I purchased from you last year, I wish
to say that it is a most superb combination. Without
the slightest hesitation, T can highly recommend it to
all my friends, and would be pleased to give particulars
to any enquirers.
Yours most respectfully.

Dear Sirs,—
I am very well satisfied with the Oil Engine I got
from you, and you can use my name to sr.v so.
J. DIMOND.
Eyre Street, Echuca.
To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Gentlemen, —
I have much pleasure in informing you that your
Mammoth Travelling Chaffcutter is giving me entire
satisfaction. The greatest difficulty 1 have is getting
the hay to the machine and the chaff away fast enough.
I find your patent knife wheel a great improvement and
time saving device for sharpening knives; also the chain
drive for rollers is very hard to beat. The friction re-
verse'gear is impossible to beat, and large riddle a groat
convenience; in fact, the whole turnout is exceptionally
good.
Yours faithfully,
H. T. WELLS.
Clover Hill Estate, Ullina.
Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs, —
I am very pleased indeed with the plant recently
supplied by you, viz., a 3.J Horse Power Oil Engine, with
Circular Saw and Bench attached, and 3-knife Chaff-
cutter, with latest improvements. The whole plant is
giving me the utmost satisfaction. The oil engine
works like a clock; it is very simple in construction as
compared with most of the imported engines, and a per-
son not well acquainted with machinery can master the
working points of it in a few hours. Its simplicity,
combined with its strength, must reduce the wear and
tear to a minimum, and greatly add to the life of the
engine. I intend using it later on to drive the shearing
machines, and expect it to give every satisfaction in that
capacity. The circular saw and bench attached to the
engine is a most ingenious contrivance, and is one of the
most useful and time-saving appliances that I have on
the place. The chaffcutter is all that you represented it
to be ; in fact, 1 consider no farm is complete without
such a plant. , Wishing your firm every success
I am, yours truly,
A. L. NASE.


Jung North.
To Messrs. RONALDSON BROS. & TIPPETT.
Dear Sirs, —
I have much pleasure in informing you that the 3J
B.H.P. Oil Engine you supplied us with 12 months ago
is giving every satisfaction. Our chaffcutter is a 3-knife
in. mouth, with elevator attached, and we cut about
double the amount of chaff we did with the horseworks
in the same time and at very small cost considering the
amount of chaff we cut in that time* Another notice-
able feature about it is in the wear. During the twelve
months we have had it in use we have found the bear-
ings always cool when we finished cutting, and to look
at her you would think she had just come out of the
shop.

Dear Sirs, —
I am pleased to be able to state that the 3J B.H.P.
Oil Engine and 3-knife Chaffcutter supplied to me in
January last have satisfied me that they are fully
capable of doing the work you stated they were fitted
for. Having no occasion to bag chaff, I cannot say the
actual weight per hour I can cut. lam using a canvas
elevator, elevating chaff a distance of 18 feet from cut-
ter, and the engine can do all this easily. All the
help I require at chaffcutting is a bov to cut sheaf bands.
The sawbench also works well, and suits us splendidly.
Yours truly.

Dear Sirs, —
The 8.11.P. Oil Engine w© purchased from you in
September last is giving us every satisfaction. We are
driving a No. 2 3-fcnife chaffcutter with it, and it does
its work easily. It maintains the one regular speed
whether the machine is being fed to its fullest capacity
or running empty. • We also drive a 30 inch circular saw
with it, and can cut through a 12 inch hard box log in
a few seconds.
We consider horseworks and axes should be put aside
as relics of cruelty and slavery, as with the oil engine
the work is a mere pastime. We will in all probability
require another one shortly, and if so have no hesitation
in giving you the order.
Yours truly,
J. T. & R. SWEETMAN.

Dear Sirs. —
I have pleasure in stating that the Oil Engine I pur-
chased from you twelve months ago is still giving every
satisfaction, and has been working six days a week since
purchased, and has lifted an average tonnage of 700
tons per week 25 feet during that period. The newer
pattern engine is also giving satisfaction at Stawell, and
I should be glad if you would make me another similar
to the last as soon as possible.
Yours faithfully.

Dear Sirs, —
We must sav we are highly pleased with the working
of your Oil Engine. It is easily managed, and we can
get cutting in a verv short time. We gave it a run last
week and cut 12 cwt. in 15 min. We feel sure we have
the most up-to-date plant in the district, and can con-
fidentlv recommend vour oil engines, chaffcutter, and cir-
cular saw, all of which have given every satisfaction.
Wishing you every success.

Dear Sirs, —
Re your enquiries about "Eureka” Travelling Chaff-
cutter supplied to us some time ago, we are pleased to
state that we are perfectly satisfied in every detail We
consider from 18 to 20 tons per day fair average cutting.
Your changeable bagger cylinder for sacks or bran bags
is a feature we like. Regarding your patent knife chang-
ing gear, wo have given it a fair test, and can Say it is
quick and efficient, and regard about a knife a minute a
fair average time after repeated trials. This we find
compares most favorably with the overhanging wheel.
We could not conclude without saying a wmrd about her
superiority in drawing; so far we have cut over 600
tons with her. and see no difference from the first day
w r e tried her. This -wo regard as the most notable feature
in her, and think it is the most essential point in any
chaffcutter, and car. therefore congratulate you on reduc-
ing a difficulty to a minimum.
We are, yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs, —
In reply to' yours of the 18th with reference to the
Chaffcutter and Silo Elevator purchased from you some
twelve months ago, I have much pleasure in informing
you that it does its wmrk splendidly, and has not given
us the least trouble, although both chaffcutter and ele-
vator have been put to a most severe test. We use
them principally for chaffing ensilage and elevating it
into silos, twenty four feet high. Since starting we
chaffed about 250 tons, 100 tons of which was a very
heavy crop of maize, standing about 11 feet high, and
many of the stalks were over 2 inches in diameter. It
took it in as quickly as three men could feed, arid with-
out any strain whatever on either machine or elevator.
I find it is a big improvement on any other machine
that I have used, the gear being so convenient and
easily adjusted, to cut any length up to 1 in. if required.
The reversing gear sets without the slightest i jar on the
works, and the frame being strong and firmly built
makes it a machine specially adapted for our work, and
one that will stand any amount of hard w T ear.
Yours respectfully,
G. MATHESON.

■We are very well pleased with the 7 B.H.P. Portable
Austral Oil Engine we have got from you. We have
worked chaffcutter, corn crusher, and a circular saw, 2 ft.

(boards and planks) and proved it to be very powerful.
We may say that we started the engine alone before
your expert arrived.

Dear Sirs, —
I am really pleased with the 5 B.H.P. Portable Oil
Engine and Chaffcutter, with Elevator, that 1 purchased
from you twelve months ago. I have now given it a
thorough trial, and can speak with confidence. The
engine is more than equal for anything that I have set
it to do. The simplicity and the power of the engine
is really wonderful. The chaffcutter is all that could be
desired: it feeds well. The patent detachable fixing for
removing the knives for sharpening is a groat saving of
time. The chain gear is good, and the friction rever-
sible gear is splendid, there being no bumping or un-
necessary jar when putting the machine out of gear. I
have cut for several farmers around here, all of whom
have been quite satisfied with the work done.
Yours truly,

Dear Sirs, —
Having installed a complete Chaflcutting Plant of
your manufacture, consisting of 12 inch mouth, 4-knife
cutter, double bagger, elevators, &c., I am in a position
to testify to its general superiority over anything I have
used or seen. The improvements are of the most practi-
cal and time-saving description, notably chain drive for
rollers, lightning change knife holders, safety reverse
gear? and numerous details, which all go to make a
first-class sample, and save time and worry. I can
easily put through 3 tons an hour. The bagger is all
that could be desired.
Yours faithfully.

P.S. —I have been chaflcutting here 15 years, and I can
confidently say your cutter makes a better sample of
chaff than any cutter I have had previously.—R.M.

The 5 B.H.P. Vertical Austral Oil Engine, together
with the 3-knife Chaffcutter and Elevator, which I have
been using for the past four months, gives every satis-
faction. The engine uses at the rate of two quarts of

Bear Sirs, —
Your Patent Changeable Knife Wheel, which you
supplied us with early in the year, gives great satisfac-
tion, as it is simple, strong, and not only saves time but
fuel for engine also. We can now cut as much chaff in
eight hours as we could previously in 10. and to any
who wish to go in for faster cutting we would recom-
mend your patent changeable knife.

Dear Sirs, —
I am very well pleased with the plant recently sup-
plied by you—a 5 Horse Power Oil Engine and 3-knife
Chaffcutter, with Bumper Bagger attached, also a Circu-
lar Saw Bench. The whole plant is giving me the ut-
most satisfaction. The engine itself is a marvel. With
your 3-knife Chaffcutter and Bumper Bagger we can cut
and bag 1 \ tons of chaff in an hour easily, and at the
same time pump 1600 gallons of water; in fact, we find
the more work we give it to do the better it likes it.
We feel sure that we have the most up-to-date plant in
the district, and can confidently recommend your Oil
engines, chaffeutters, dumper baggers, and circular saws,
all of which have given me the utmost satisfaction.
Yours faithfully,

This engine is an emblem true
Of what inventive skill can do,
For with a drop of kerosene
Such great result may now be seen.
She’ll cut the chaff, the water draw;
The milk she’ll skim, the wood she’ll saw.
The powder applied at present shows
Her usefulness no limit knows,
So with this drop of sparkling wine
We’ll christen her the “Caroline.” —G.M.

Messrs. RONALBSON BROS. & TIPPETT,
Boar Sirs, —
The 5 8.11. P. Oil Engine and Chaffcutter, which I
purchased from you some time ago, are doing their work
splendidly; far bettor than I anticipated. The cutter
makes a fine sample of chaff, and is no trouble to teed,
the reversible gear being very simple and effective. The
boy and I comfortably cut a ton of chaff in an hour
and ten minutes. The oil engine works a hand separa-
tor (100 gallons per hour, Be Laval) on one end, and
the chaffcutter and corncrusher. &c., on the other. So
far it has not given us any trouble at all, but works
wonderfully true and smooth, and has not cost me a
single copper for repairs. The cost of running is so
small that I have never made up the amount. For
farm use, in my opinion, there is no power equal to the
Austral Oil Engine, and I would not like to be. without
mine.

The new chaffcutter I bought from you is working
splendidly; in fact, no one could wish for anything to run
more smoothly. The chain roller gear and friction re-

good sample of chaff.
The patent knife holders are a big saving in time as
well as being very handy when grinding the knives.
Hoping your machines will get as good sale as their
quality merits.

X am so pleased with the Chaflcutter you supplied me
with that I must write and compliment you on your im-

It cuts about twice as much chaff than the best I
have seen in the district in a given time, and a beautiful
sample. It is also very light to driue. I can confidently
recommend your machinery to any persons requiring good

Gentlemen,—
In answer to your letter enquiring how I like the 5
B.H.P. Oil Engine, which I purchased from you on Ist
May, 1906, I am very pleased to tell you that the engine
has given every satisfaction. It has not given any
trouble. It drives the 8-knife chaftcutter and elevators
with the greatest of ease, and uses very little oil. If I
thought they were so easily managed I would have had
one two or three years before, as it is a great ease to
my horses, and after it is started we scarcely ever go
near it until finished, and so far it has given me entire
satisfaction.
Yours truly,

Dear Sirs, —
The complete Chaffcutting Plant you supplied us at
the beginning of the year has given us every satisfac-
tion. It has been working almost daily since erected
without the least mishap or breakage, being exception-
ally strong in every part where strength is required.
The patent knife wheel is a splendid innovation, requir-
ing a stoppage of only three minutes for changing knives.
The friction clutch is just the thing, and does away
with all the jar on reversing. The chain drive for the
rollers only requires to be seen at work to be appreciat-
ed. Several men interested in chaffcutting have called
to inspect this plant, and all declare that they have
never seen a chaffcutter to compare with it. We would
advise anyone in search of an up-to-date reliable machine
to inspect yours, and we don’t think they would go any
further. Wishing you every success.
Yours respectfully,

Dear Sirs, —
We have much pleasure in informing you that the
“Togo” Fodder Press which we purchased from you has
I given us complete satisfaction. We are pressing from
six to seven tons of manger hay per day with four men,
and we can dump about 20 tons of chaff per day with
same. The advantage your press has over the old
style is its high lift, which only necessitates one run,
while the old style required two lifts, which meant a
great loss of time, consequently there is also a great
saving in steam power.

your patent knife holders which are fitted on to my
