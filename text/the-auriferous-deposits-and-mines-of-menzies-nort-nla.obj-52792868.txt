PREFATORY NOTE.
THIS report upon the Auriferous Deposits and Mines of Menzies,
by Mr. H. P. Woodward, forms another of the series designed
to treat of the different mining centres of the State.
The geological work was based upon the topographical map
prepared by Mr, W. D. Campbell in the year 1899. The existence
of this map greatly facilitated Mr. Woodward’s work, and it is much
to be regretted that it has not hitherto been found possible to have
the necessary topographical work completed and available before
the geological surveys of important mining centres are undertaken.
The preparation of the topographical map of Menzies involved a
good deal of labour, necessitating the fixing of all shafts, etc., in
addition to running contour lines 10 feet apart in altitude ; the
survey was carried out with a four-inch tacheometer, and as a check
a few measurements were made with a chain. In order to preserve
continuous contour lines, the survey was carried a little further than
would otherwise have been the case.
The area embraced by Mr. Woodward’s work covers about 50
square miles, and includes the. productive area of the district so far
as at present understood. The field work, upon which Mr. Wood-
ward’s geological and mining work is based, was commenced in May
and concluded on the 20th of October, 1905, but owing to the necessity
for him remaining in touch with the Perth office during my absence
in. the North-West, and in paying short visits to different portions
of the State for specially urgent purposes, the Menzies survey could
not be carried out continuously.
In its essential geological features, Menzies consists of a complex
of basic rocks, through which have been intruded a series of acidic
dykes, which in all probability emanated from the large granitic
mass which forms the higher ground in the vicinity of Springfield,
near the eastern border of the map.
The übiquitous cover of superficial deposits has rendered
geological mapping somewhat difficult, but so far as possible the
different rock masses and associated ore deposits have been delineated
on the geological map with such a degree of accuracy as the scale of
the field plans would admit.
The basic crystalline rocks of Menzies are of considerable
importance, as they are everywhere genetically connected with the


auriferous quartz reefs of the district; they consist for the most
part of amphibolite and diorite, and their derivatives ; serpentine-
chlorite, and hornblende schists. Many of the more or less foliated
or quasi-schistose basic rooks, when followed down to about 100 feet
or so below the surface, gradually give place to massive greenstones,
which, however, when exposed to the weather, rapidly become fissile
and split readily along cleavages planes. This dormant foliation
has been proved to exist to the greatest depths yet attained on the
field, viz., 800 feet.
The acidic rocks only occupy a relatively small area of
the surface in the vicinity of Springfield, though their existence
beneath the superficial cover has been proved in wells and quarries
to the north and west. They consist chiefly of gneiss, mica schist,
sericite schist; and, as is the case with the basic rocks, the schistose
character seems to be lost at a variable depth below the surface.
There seem good reasons for believing that this mass consists of a
porphyritic granite, which owes its present condition to crushing
and hydration. A portion of the field is traversed by numerous
acidic dykes, some of which are of considerable horizontal extent;
they are generally represented by sericite schists and allied rocks,
though transitions from such to porphyritic granite have been
noticed.
The quartz reefs, which are confined to the greenstones, are of
various types and of somewhat different characters. Several large
banded quartz reefs, approaching quartzite in appearance, occur in
certain localities; they are, however, of no extent, nor are they of
any economic importance.
Some very ferruginous lodes which, below water-level often
pass into marcasite, are met with, and can be traced for considerable
distances; whilst these deposits have proved to be auriferous, they
have invariably been found to be of so low a grade as to be unwork-
able.
Most of the gold from Menzies has been obtained from
segregation reefs, which have an irregular lenticular habit. One of
the longest of these is 1,600 feet, though with the exception of those
in the few larger mines, these segregation reefs do not attain any
great longitudinal extent, but form a series of small but rich
parallel veins.
One or two fissure-veins occur in the field, but the comparative
poverty of their gold contents is more than compensated for by
their extent and the probabilities of continuity in depth.


Every available mine on the field was visited by Mr, Wood-
ward during the course of his work, but many of the larger
properties were shut down and inaccessible. Full and detailed
descriptions of the mines, accompanied by mining plans, without
which the text would be wellnigh unintelligible, are given in
ertenno in the report.
Statistics of the production of the district are attached to the
descriptive portions, and in the form in which they are represented
the figures give as complete a record of the gold yield of the various
deposits of Menzies as is possible. These demonstrate that from
the area embraced by the Geological Map of Menzies there have
been produced 403,78 7'71 fine ounces of gold, derived from the
milling of 348,967'40 tons of quartz, or at the rate of Pl 6 fine
ounces per ton.
The deposits so far opened up have not been, below the depth
of 300 feet, as satisfactory in regard to both quantity and quality
of the ore as in the higher levels. Although many of the larger ore
deposits appear to have been virtually worked out, there seems every
reason to believe that other deposits of a somewhat similar nature
to the smaller veins already opened up in many of the old
workings may be reasonably expected to be discovered by judicious
exploration, and may prove possibly of equal value.
The report and accompanying maps were, on being submitted
to the Hon. the Minister for Mines, ordered to be printed for public
information.
The index to names, places, mines, reefs, etc., occurring in the
report has been prepared by Mr. P. J. Atkins, Clerk to the
Geological Survey.

* This table includes only the returns from those leases which are embraced
by the area of the Geological Map.
October, 1894, for the first lease in what is now known as the
Menzies district. They were not, however, the first prospectors.
A well-equipped party carfie front the 90-mile (Goongarrie) in
August of that year, consisting of J. Brown, C. Kirby, and C.
Jackman, and had, to a certain extent, developed a show about two
miles south of the lease Messrs. Menzies and McDonald applied for.
It did not turn out as expected, and the lease was not at that time
applied for, though afterwards it was taken up and called the
‘Pioneer’ (Lady Harriet). The lease, however, which Menzies
obtained was the world-famed ‘ Lady Shenton,’ the leading mine of
the district.”
Owing to the richness of the early discoveries, this district
rapidly attracted considerable attention in the mining world, with
the result that numerous companies were floated and large areas
applied for as leases. Unfortunately, however, the rich properties
were limited, and, more unfortunately still, the lodes in these, after
yielding a considerable quantity of gold, have, with a few exceptions,
decreased so considerably in size and richness in their lower levels
that work has been practically suspended.
Up to the end of the year 1905 over 400,0000z5. of gold were
obtained from this district, of which total over seven-eighths were
produced by seven Companies, the properties of five of which have
now practically ceased to be productive. In spite of this fact it is
most satisfactory to note that the gold returns from this district
have not fallen off as considerably as might have been expected,
this being due to the large number of small rich shows that have
been developed by working miners since the establishment of a
State Battery.
The following is a statement of the gold yield from this district,
from its inception up to the end of 1905, as reported to the Mines
Department:


PART I.— General Geology.
Section I,— Topography.
The area under review surrounds the township of Menzies, cover-
ing about 50 square miles, the survey of which was carried out by
Mr. W. D. Campbell, Assoc.M.lnst.C.E,, F.G.S., Topographical
Surveyor, and now Assistant Geologist; and it is upon the plan
■which he prepared, and which was printed in 1899, that the present
geological lines have been laid down.
The tract covered by the plan can best be described as an
elevated hilly region surrounded by alluvial plains, which latter
gradually fall towards lakes.
The whole was originally thickly covered with mulga scrub
with here and there stunted gum trees, but since mining operations
started the timber-cutters have made very considerable inroads
into it, in fact those portions near the town and mines have been
absolutely denuded of timber.
The highest hill is Mt. Misery, 1,660 feet above sea-level, or
330 feet above the alluvial flats; it is situated near the centre of a
rough range of hills which run in a north-west direction upon
the eastern side of rhe district. These hills present a steep face to
the eastward but are flanked by a belt of broken elevated country
to the westward, which gradually descends towards the fiats which
lie to the north, south, and west.
Except in the hilly regions, well-defined watercourses are of
rare occurrence owing to the very gradual fall and the pervious
nature of the surface; in consequence, after heavy rain, like thunder-
storms, large tracts of the alluvial flats may often be covered for a
short time by a thin sheet of water, whilst after light rains no water
runs, but the whole becomes so boggy as to be impassable.
Section II.— Water Supply.
Owing to the facts mentioned above and the generally light and
very uncertain character of the rainfall this area is not adapted to
the conservation of surface water, whilst the subterranean supply is
very limited ; the area over which that of a potable quality can be
obtained is small and the supply extremely limited.
Although the united supply from the above two sources has
very frequently proved inadequate for the domestic requirements of
the residents the demand for an extra supply is of too intermittent
a character to warrant the erection of a condensing plant, there

fore water is now hauled by the railway from the Goldfields Water
Supply reservoir at Kalgoorlie, a distance of 80 miles, which
materially increases the cost of living.
In the upper levels of the mines a small supply of salt water
is often encountered in sinking but this is practically lost in
depth, therefore milling plants, etc., are mainly dependent upon a
supply of salt water pumped a considerable -distance from a low-
lying area to the westward of Menzies, which renders treatment
costly and precludes the possibility of the profitable working of
low-grade deposits. The underground fresh water supplies are
confined mostly to alluvial basins upon the eastern side of the
district, and being entirely dependent upon the rainfall the supply
varies considerably and is limited.
Section III.—Descriptive Geology.
In order to follow this description it will be necessary to refer
to the Geological Map of the district, upon which the boundaries of
the various formations have been carefully laid down.
By reference to the Explanation of the Colours and Signs upon
the map it will be seen that the rocks, which are represented by
distinguishing colours and signs, have been classed under the fol-
lowing headings : —lst, the Recent, which is subdivided into
Alluvium consisting of clay, loam, sand, and gravel of the flats and
creek beds, and Laterites consisting of brown hematite (ironstone),
ferruginous claystone, and conglomerate (cement) capping the hills
and ridges. 2nd, the Crystalline and Altered Rooks, which have
been subdivided into Basic consisting of serpentine and chloritic
schists, amphibolites, aphanatic diorite, and other hornblende and
allied rocks, and the Acid consisting of sericite, mica schist,
granite, and quartzite. 3rd, the Igneous Rocks which occur as
dykes of felsite, porphyry, and granite.

Laterite Hill, near South-West corner of the Water Reserve.




The two general cross-sections at the bottom of the map will
make clear the fact that although a very considerable area is mapped
as alluvium this is often of little thickness ; in fact near the Lady
Shenton mine and at several other points along the auriferous belt
it barely covers the weathered schists, whilst reefs often outcrop
through it. It is strictly speaking a superficial deposit resulting
directly from the weathering of the schists in situ , but since it
masks the underlying rocks, dykes, etc., and merges imperceptibly
into the true alluvium, it has been included under that head.
In both sections the portions of the various rocks near the
surface in the zone of hydration have been ruled to indicate their
foliated nature, whilst the rocks beneath are coloured to represent
diorite and granite respectively as their probable anhydrous
character.
Recent Superficial Deposits.
The greater portion of the surface of the area mapped is
covered by shallow superficial deposits, which have been classed
under two heads, viz.: Alluvium and Laterites.
The Alluvium covers all the plains, flats, and valleys, and
consists of soil, clay, loam, sand, gravel, and cement (calcareous
conglomerate), varying in thickness from a few inches to many
feet, their surface being often covered with fragments of ironstone,
quartz, or rock which when auriferous are worked as dryblowing
patches and deep leads.
The term alluvium has been adopted to cover these recent
surface accumulations as a matter of convenience, but it is hardly
accurate nomenclature since only those portions which follow the
drainage channels appear to have been deposited by the action of
running water, whilst the balance, which is by far the most con-
siderable, has evidently been formed from the gradual disintegration
of the rocks by meteoric influences, but for obvious reasons it has
been found impossible to distinguish it from the genuine alluvium.
The Laterites are found capping many of the hills and ridges,
being apparently the remnants of an extensive formation which
covered the entire western portion of the area, the softer portions of
which have gradually yielded to atmospheric influences but still
leave ample evidence of their previous existence in the ironstone
fragments which cover the flats.
These cappings are composed of ironstone, which however
varies very greatly in composition from almost pure limonite
(hydrated oxide of iron or brown hematite) [1177-8, 1203-4, 6317]
to earthy ochres and ferruginous clays.
These ironstones, although presenting a dark chocolate-
coloured polished exterior, when broken are found to be of a very
porous nature, which renders them very susceptible to atmospheric
influences, with the result that the more or less horizontal hard
crust has been riddled with pipes and caverns by meteoric water,


which, causing it to collapse from time to time, have so broken
these cappings that they mostly present the appearance of an
aggregate of rough masses.
Beneath these cappings are soft beds of a more or less earthy
nature, which when followed down merge imperceptibly into the
oxidised rock beneath ; this portion of the formation is also a source
of weakness to the ironstone, since animals and reptiles burrowing
beneath the harder crust cause falls of the roof through leaving
insufficient support.
Laterites are the result of subaerial decomposition of the rocks
in situ, due to hydration and oxidation in a practically rainless and
tropical country, consequently their composition is liable to vary
considerably even over a small area, it being governed by the nature
of the underlying rocks.
That ferruginous laterite cappings are most commonly met
with is due to the fact that the amphibolite series from which they
were derived are largely developed upon the goldfields and are rich in
iron, whilst further deposits of this nature were able to resist recent
denuding influences better than the softer deposits of a purely
magnesian, calcareous, and aluminous character, and in conse-
quence they not only remained themselves but also protected the
underlying rocks, with the result that they now appear as ridges or
hills since the adjoining unprotected country has been denuded.
They are of little economic value upon this area, for, with the single
exception of that upon the Crusoe hill a small but rich deposit of
gold was discovered associated with one of these earthy ferruginous
beds ; in this deposit the gold was found to be of an entirely
different character and of a much higher value than that obtained
even from the oxidised zone in the mines, whilst subsequent trench-
ing and cross-cutting beneath it failed to prove the presence of any
auriferous body in the vicinity. The inference therefore is that
this deposit results from the concentration of gold carried in small
quantities in the country rock (this being a common feature of this
belt), during which process the silver and baser metals were removed
and the fine particles of gold united.
The Crystalline Series.
These rocks not only outcrop over a considerable portion of
this area but also underlie directly all the superficial deposits •
great interest centres in them as they form the matrix of the
auriferous quartz bodies.
They have been divided into two groups upon the map, viz.: (a)
the Basic, which consists largely of hornblende and minerals result-
ing from its hydration, such as serpentine, talc, and chlorite; and
(6) the acid, in which silica predominates.
The basic series are traversed by numerous felsite and granite
dykes, which were apparently intruded prior to the formation of the
quartz-veins since these latter intersect both the basic and acidic
rocks, without the remotest partiality.

Sericite-schist Outcrop. East of the Emu Lease.




Of these rocks the basic cover by far the greater extent, pre-
senting generally at the surface a schistose character [750, 752, 754,
1047] merging imperceptibly into massive crystalline amphibolites
[801, 1174,1192,1988], which usually form rough ridges or bosses,
but are clearly not dykes, since all attempts to define their
boundaries failed utterly.
When these rocks are sunk upon, as in mining, their character
quickly changes, the schistose structure giving place below the water-
level (about 100 feet) to a massive aphanitic jointed diorite in which
no cleavage planes are visible [6371, 6312, 6331]. It breaks in masses
more or less cubical exhibiting absolutely no schistose structure to
the naked eye, but on exposure to the action of the weather dormant
cleavage planes rapidly develope, when it becomes fissile and splits
in a shale-like manner when struck with a hammer. To what
depth this dormant fissility actually extends it is impossible in the
present condition of our knowledge to determine, but it is known to
exist in a slight degree at the greatest depths attained at present in
any of the mines, viz., about 800 feet vertical.
The schistosity within this area has a general strike to the
north-westward, with an underlay of about 45 degrees to the west-
ward ; but in the Kensington belt the direction, for a distance of
one mile, is found to have changed to the north-eastward, whilst
the dip changes from north-west to south-east.
At the Goodenough, which lies about half a mile to the north
of the northern end of the Kensington belt, a sudden change has
taken place for a short distance, the cleavage planes striking east
and west and dipping south.
The Acid group is only developed at the surface to any extent
in one hill mass about two miles in length, which runs in a south-
easterly direction from Jowett’s Well, situated a little south of
Mt. Misery; but they also have been proved to exist in wells and
quarries beneath the alluvial flats to the eastward and northward
[6339, 6318].
Where these rocks outcrop they generally consist of gneiss,
mica schist, sericite schist, and quartzite [6321, 6365, 6320], but these
characters are, as in the basic series, lost at a moderate depth below
the surface, mica schist giving place to gneiss, and sericite schist to
sericite slate; however, it is impossible to study what changes take
place in these rooks below the water-level as they have not yet
been sunk upon, but to judge from the changes that have taken
place in the dyke rocks (as will be gone into later on) it is highly
probable that this entire mass is an intrusion of porphyritic
granite, altered near the surface by hydration and crushing.
At several points on the alluvial flats to the eastward' of Mt.
Misery, weathered schists are met with in the wheel-ruts or in
trenches, whilst granitic rocks form the country at the Federal
Group, which runs in a north-easterly direction, a little to the north-
westward of the Kurrajong Lease, 3482. Along the railway line
and the Niagara Road granite has been met with in sinking wells,


also in some quarries where weathered granite has been worked a
little to the north-eastward of the town.
The basic rocks are intersected by numerous dykes, which are
most largely developed at the surface along a belt which extends in
a north-westerly direction from the north end of the outcrop of the
acid rocks near Jewett’s Well, passing the south end of the Ken-
sington belt, and continuing to the northward of the water catch-
ment area, gradually concentrating to the north-east corner of the
town by the Hospital Reserve. A few scattered acidic dykes are
also visible around Mt. Misery and at one or two other points upon
this area; but although they do not outcrop along the auriferous
belt owing to the alluvial covering, they are constantly met with in
sinking. Such of the dykes as outcrop have been mapped with
considerable care, under the supposition that they might have played
an important part in the formation and enrichment of the reefs ;
this, however, upon careful examination of these bodies in the
mines situated upon the auriferous belt, proved not to be the case,
since it became evident at once that they were intruded prior to the
deposition of the quartz veins, which are found to intersect them
indiscriminately with the hornblende rocks.
The dykes where they outcrop generally present a felsitic and
often silicious appearance, splitting into flags, which have been
quarried for pitching purposes upon the northern side of the water
reserve [6367-70], but at other points they have passed into very
friable sericite schists. This latter characteristic is generally met
with upon the auriferous belt immediately below the alluvium, but
these, like the other rocks, rapidly-change in depth.
No examination of these rocks could be made below the surface,
except where mining operations have been carried on, but to judge
from the general surface character they are apparently- of one class,
their different nature at the surface being due to local influences
whilst motamorphism was taking place.
These dykes, where met with along the auriferous belt, as
mentioned above, are generally represented by sericite schist, with
here and there small patches of mica representing weathered granite.
This character sometimes extends throughout the entire depth of
the oxidised zone, or it may pass into weathered gneiss, thence into
solid gneiss, or crushed granite, which at greater depths, when
struck by bores, proves to be a porphyritic granite with small
crystals of black mica [6340-4, 6337, 6364, 6371].
A complete series, illustrating this interesting transition from
soft-weathered sericite schist into porphyritic granite, have been
collected [6332-6].
At the north-west corner of this area two dykes of albite granite
outcrop, which hay-e been opened up evidently in the hope of their
proving auriferous [6318],
The basic rocks also contain sparry veins of dolomite below the
oxidised zone, whilst above it these are repi’esented by creamy-

coloured veins of magnesian limestone [6323,6315-6], which are
particularly numerous amongst the serpentine schists. These rocks
also contain veins of actiiiolite and a little inferior asbestos in places
[6323,6325].
Quartz Veins.
The quartz reefs may be first divided into throe classes, viz.,
auriferous, metalliferous, and barren reefs, of which the auriferous
may be still further divided into (a) fissure veins and (6) irregular
segregations forming composite lodes, and the barren into (c)
irregular buck reefs and (d) fissure cross-courses, 1
Large barren buck reefs, which often approach a quartzite in
character [785, 1189, 1203], having no definite course and of no
considerable length of outcrop, are met with at several points
upon this area; they are conspicuous, as they either form bold
ridges or fragments and from their disintegration cover considerable
areas of the surface.
The cross-courses are barren quartz bodies, formed aloug fault
lines, which intersect the auriferous veins ; they have a more or less
east and west course and underlay mostly to the north, but are not
as a rule of great longitudinal extent.
There are also a series of ferruginous lodes, which at the surface
are oxidised, but near and below the water-level they pass into
pyrites, mostly marcasite, containing a little gold, which, however, is
in too small a quantity to cover the cost of working. These
lodes have generally a more or less north-west course, and
can often be traced for a considerable distance at the surface.
One of these follows the main belt of dykes upon the north-east
side, starting from a little east of Merry’s Well, passing by the
Maranora and Kensington mines to the south westward, and so on
in a north-westerly direction for about a mile. Another large lode
of this description is met with at the Goodenough mine, but
here it does not appear to be of great extent.
Along the auriferous belt, bodies of this description are often
met with and are generally known as mineral lodes. They are
well-defined and apparently continuous for considerable distances,
but are uniformly of very low grade. One very noticeable point
wuh regard to these bodies is that they not only are of little value
themselves, but are said as a rule to exercise an impoverishing
effect upon the auriferous lodes at any points at which they come
in contact.
Composite lodes.—The class of reefs around which the greatest
interest centres are those from which the major portion of the gold
produced from this district was obtained, and these may be classed
as irregular lenticular segregation deposits. They occur either in
the form of pipes or a series of lenticular masses ; the longest axis,-
following the cleavage planes of the rock diagonally in a southerly
direction, is called the shoot. In the upper levels it is not un-
common to find a series of such veins following parallel planes, but
these gradually give out in depth. In the oxidised zone many of


these veins were very rich, the gold sometimes being associated
with chloride of silver, whilst below the water-level galena is
generally met with if the stone is of high grade. The greatest
length to which one. of these quart?, bodies of the pipe-1 ibe form
has continued to be payable is that worked in the Queensland
Menzies mine; it is about 1,600 feet in length; whilst in the Lady
Shenton, where the combined ore shoots have a much greater
horizontal breadth, the shoots do not exceed 800 feet in length
upon the incline; the vertical depth being in the former 660 feet
and in the latter a little over 330 feet. With the exception of the
few large mines, these veins are not usually of great extent in-
dividually, but more commonly consist of a series of small but rich
quartz bodies, forming as a whole a lenticular mass, including
the enriched decomposed rock called “formation”; but this latter
diminishes the value of the stone too greatly to be profitably worked
except by a plant upon the spot, therefore only the quartz is as
a rule treated.
Lines of this nature are common throughout this belt, but
since the surface is covered by superficial deposits a considerable
amount of prospecting is often necessary before they are located.
Owing to this, leases are repeatedly abandoned under the
supposition that they are worked out, to be taken up later and
worked again time after time as further prospecting by other
parties revealed the existence of fresh quartz veins. Although
other well-defined lenticular quartz bodies may be met with below
the point at which the ore-shoot pinched out, it has been found
that such bodies, if they do not come into existence either in the
oxidised zone or immediately' below it, have not been enriched
to the extent which renders them payable, whilst the adjoining
country rock at many points along this belt has proved to be
auriferous.
Fissure-veins are not nearly so common in this district as the
segregation veins, but a good example is exhibited in the Con-
solidated mine, the footwall of which is striated and highly fissile
and indurated, indicating considerable movement. The Aspasia
lode also shows the same indications. These lodes do not appear
to carry so much galena as the segregation veins, neither are they
so rich ; but this is in a measure compensated for by their greater
longitudinal extent of the ore-shoot, and also probable continuity
in depth. The pay shoot in these reefs dips in the same direction
as the others, viz., in a southerly direction, upon an inclined plane
which dips at an angle of about 45 degrees to the south-westward,
but they differ in so far that the vein does not of a necessity end at
the point where the stone pinches out, but may be met with again
further north or south along the fissure.
Faults.
Besides the cross-head joint faults mentioned under cross-
courses, which have disturbed the auriferous reefs by throwing
them in an easterly or westerly direction, there are a series of faults

and thrust planes which coincide more or less with the foliation
of the rooks, and in consequence are not apparent in the oxidised
zone. These faults may form the fissures for lodes such as the
Consolidated and Aspasia, where they more nearly coincide with
the cleavage planes of the rock, or they may occur as thrust planes,
when, although generally adopting the universal strike, they cut
the foliation planes at a lower angle. These are possibly up-throw
faults of limited extent, due to the intense lateral pressure caused
by the expansion of the rocks whilst undergoing hydration, in
which case they would have existed prior to the formation of the
auriferous reefs, which latter sometimes terminate upon them.
PART II.—Economic Geology.
Section I.—General.
In the preparation of this section, which is devoted to a descrip-
tion of the reproductive ore bodies, great difficulties have been
experienced owing to the fact that most of the large mines are now
inaccessible, whilst, where accessible, timbered levels and worked
out stopes (where not mullooked up) afford little information as to
the character and size of the lode, since often a considerable quantity
of the adjoining enriched rock has been removed with the stone, or
the lode may have consisted of a number of small veins which
necessitated the removal of the interpolated rock which was crushed
or used for filling, according to its value.
To add to this difficulty, little reliable literature exists; whilst
plans, in many instances, of underground workings of defunct Com-
panies have been lost or taken away by the owners’ representatives,
and not lodged with the Government.
Information has therefore been collected from the most reliable
sources, such as prospectors, mine managers, etc., who have most
kindly done all in their power to assist in the investigations.
In order to give as clear an idea as possible of the nature of the
ore deposits and the extent of the work done upon them, working
plans, etc., have been reduced and reproduced upon a general map
(Plate I.), which will be found of use if followed in conjunction
with this section of the report. *


The depths of the shafts, etc., have been taken as far as possible
from the certified working plans, but, where these were not obtain-
able, either from official records, information obtained from owner,
manager, or personal examination ; the la tter not being very reliable,
since many of the old shafts have been partially filled in or have
fallen in. The depths at which water was encountered in sinking,
and its character and yield per diem, has necessarily been taken
from official and other records, for where shafts have been sunk to a
depth below the water-level into the solid countrv and no further
supply is met with, that originally struck often disappears alto-
gether.
The number of tons of stone crushed, with the gold yield
therefrom, is. taken from the statistics published by the Mines
Department, the information being so arranged that no matter how
many times a property has changed hands, the total production is
given from each individual area.
This area yield must not be confused with the system usually
adopted by this Department of adding the totals from an individual
reef, no matter how many properties it may pass through, the
change of system being found necessary because continuous reefs
are almost unknown in this district; in fact, in many instances, the
returns from a single property may have been derived from a
number of reefs. When tabulated in order to give a grand total,
the names of all leases included represent the same area, or portions
of it, and not adjoining properties on the same line.
Recently, this field has been worked largely under Protection
Areas in place of leases, the yield from which has not been allo-
cated, but is given under the head of various claims in the total.
In the case of mining companies working several leases and
giving bulk returns, where possible an analysis has been obtained
from the manager in order that the produce may he credited to the
particular locality from which it was derived.
There are two auriferous belts within this area.; one, which
may Vie called the main or western belt, starts to the north-west-
ward of the town, at the St. Alban’s group, from which it runs in a
south-easterly direction, widening out as it approaches the town,
through which it passes on the western side, then on, gradually
contracting until it reaches the township of Yunndaga (Woolgar),
south of which it extends two miles, terminating in the Barunga
Brave. This belt, like the lodes themselves, is of a lenticular
shape, but the resemblance to the individual ore bodies does not
end here, for, on investigation, it is found that the belt does not
consist of one main defined line, but of a series lying more or less
parallel to each other, crossing this main belt diagonally upon a
course rather more westerly. These secondary lines are further
found to be constituted of lines of disconnected bodies or bunches,
and these latter of aggregates of pipes or lenses of quartz.

The other group, which may be called the Kensington group,
strikes in a north-easterly direction upon the western side of Mt.
Misery. It is not nearly so long as the main belt, nor has it
yielded anything like the quantity of gold. In this group the
individual lines are not uniform in their strike and dip, the west-
ward line dipping to the westward, the central lines to the
eastward, and the eastern line to the westward, whilst the Ken-
sington at the south, and the Goodenough at the north, strike
east and west, dipping south.
Outside these two main belts there are a few scattered leases,
but the total yield of the gold from these is inconsiderable.
Section II. The Ore Deposits and Mines.
St. Alban’s Group, —This group of leases, which were originally
worked by the Menzies Consolidated Company, is situated upon a
low hill of schistose rock that rises above the alluvial flats about
three miles north-west of Menzies. Of the St. Alban’s lease* in
1895, Mr. H. Y. L. Brown, Government Geologist of South Aus-
tralia, says: “ This is a quartz reef which strikes east and west
and dips south at an angle of 45 degrees. The gold occurs in
quartz.”* There are three parallel lines of small reefs, which have
been traced for a length of from 50 to 100 feet in an east and west
direction in schistose diorite [Bos]. They have been worked by a
series of underlay shafts to the water-level, but a vertical shaft has
been sunk to a dejjth of 240 feet, in which a small quantity of salt-
water was encountered from 100 to 150 feet. Since the Company
abandoned it in 1897 the lease has been continuously worked,
but has twice changed hands.

Resurrection, G.M.L. 4859z.—This lease is situated a few
chains to the eastward of the last, the reef, which follows the same
course, viz., east and west, has been opened up by a number of
shallow underlay shafts upon the dip of the vein, which is to the
south in decomposed schistose rock.
The European, G.M.L. 5210 z, and Little Peter, G.M.L. 5201 z,
are situated upon a small gravel rise near the Racecourse, about
half-way between the St. Alban’s and the town. Here some shallow
holes have been sunk in the weathered rock, from which on the
former 8 tons of stone were raised, which yielded 5 - 25ozs. of gold,
and on the latter 10 tons, which yielded 3'4lozs. About a mile south
of _the last, at the north of the main belt and upon the north-
western side of the town, are two properties now called the Menziea
Proprietary, G.M.L. 5236 z, and the Dublin Castle, G.M.L. 5215 z,
which were originally known as the Little Gem, G.M.L. 3722 z, and
Selkirk, G.M.L. 2842 z, and owned by the Menzies Gold Reefs
Proprietary, Ltd., which Company did a considerable amount of
prospecting upon them without discovering anything of sufficient
size or value to be considered payable. These properties were both
taken up by working miners in 1900, and, with the exception of time
lost in changing hands, they have been worked ever since.
There are a large number of shallow shafts sunk upon small veins
in the oxidised zone, with some driving and crosscutting, the rock
being decomposed schist, and the reefs strike upon a north-westerly
course and dip to the westward.

A little to the -westward of the Dublin Castle are the following
old leases, which have been held for short periods only; little \vork
has been done upon them.
Victory North, G-.M.L. 5068 z lease lies to the south of
the last-mentioned group and at the extreme north of the Aspasia
or western line of lodes. Upon it a small body of stone, about
eight inches wide, which follows the usual north-westerly strike and
dip of 45 degrees west, has been opened upon at two points upon
the eastern boundary. The northern group of workings consist of
three shafts, two upon the underlay of the reef, which are connected,
and a vertical shaft, which cut the reef at 150 feet, but which has
not yet been connected with the other shafts.
Farther south there are two more shafts on the reef, which are
connected at a shallow depth.

Victory, G.M.L, 5066 z. —This lease, which is situated imme-
diately south of the last, was worked prior to 1901 by the Menzies
Mining and Exploration Corporation as the Helena, G.M.L. 3203 z,
it was then taken up as the Surprise, G.M.L, 6002 z, and in 1902 it
became the Victory.
A good many shafts were sunk by the original Company in
searching for the northern extension of the Aspasia lode, one being
30 feet, with a crosscut 100 feet both east and west in which a
number of small veins were met with, whilst on the Surprise a shaft
was sunk 43 feet on the western reef with a drive south 35 feet.
The deepest shaft is 130 feet, of which 80 feet are vertical, it then
follow's a small reef with the usual strike but which dips at an
angle of 65 degrees west. All the stone raised comes from the
oxidised zone, and at the present time all work is confined to a vein
upon the eastern boundary.
Menzies Lady Sherry, G.M.L, 2835 z mine adjoins
upon the south of the Dublin Castle and was first worked from 1896
until 1903 by the Menzies Lady Sherry G-.M. Company, N.L., who also
owned as block claims to the westward, leases Nos. 3806 z and 8914 z,
both of which were named the Lady Sherry West; also 4069 z, the
lease then called Brown’s, In 1903 the property was sold to the
present owners, who now only hold G.M.L. 2835 z.
Mr. EL Y. L. Brown says of this property in 1895 —“Three
quartz reefs were being mined upon here at the time of my visit.
In No. 1 shaft I observed a quartz reef dipping westerly at an
angle of 45 degrees with red mullocky formation, composed of white
kaolin and quartz (decomposed granite). No. 2 shaft is on a quartz
reef which dips westerly 45 degrees to 60 degrees. No. 3 shaft is
also on a quartz reef which branches into veins below. The quartz
contains coarse gold. The country rook in the neighbourhood of
these mines is argillaceous talcose and chloritic schists and decom-
posed diorite, and micaceous slate was observed in one place.” [789-]
This lease has been worked at two points close to the south-
west corner, the first being upon a reef which evidently outcropped
and was probably the one referred to in Mr. Brown’s report as-
occurring in shafts Nos. 1 and 2.

This reef has been worked to a depth of 107 feet 9 inches by
an underlay and vertical shaft; it was not a continuous quartz body,
but consisted of broken masses or small lenticular veins. From the
bottom level a winze has been sunk 60 feet but no stone was met
with. In these workings a faulting cross-course was met with at the
bottom of the vertical shaft B, and also in the level at the bottom
of the underlay shaft A, its course being a little north of west, with
a dip to the northward ; it is evidently the same body as is exposed
upon the surface to the southward of these workings and between
them and the main shaft, having a course nearly east and west. In
the other workings, which lie 130 feet to the south-west, a vertical
main shaft has been sunk to a depth of 260 feet, a small supply of
salt-water being struck at 180 feet. From this shaft a series of
small pipe-like lenticular quartz bodies have been worked to a
depth of 150 feet, below which no ore has been discovered.
So far as the known ore bodies in this mine are concerned they
have no apparent extension downwards below the existing workings,
whilst even at the lower levels the veins have either cut out or
become exceedingly small and poor ; there is, however, a considerable
area of untested ground between the existing workings and the
Lublin Castle in which other rich veins may exist.
Aspasia and Pandora, G.M.Ls. Nos. 3100 z, 3138z.—These
leases, which are the property of the Menzies Mining and Explora-
tion Corporation, Ltd., are situated immediately south of the
Victory and to the westward of the Lady Sherry, upon them a well-
defined reef, which outcrops upon a north-west course with a dip to
the south-westward of 58 degrees at the south end and 70 degrees
at the north end, has been opened at the surface for a length of 370
feet by a number of underlay shafts. These shafts connect with
the No. 1 or 56-feet level, which has been driven for a length of
520 feet, of which 440 feet was in payable stone.

The No. 2, or 117-feet level, has been driven for a distance of
320 feet, the north end to the limit of the pay shoot, whilst the
south end was discontinued before that end wuis reached. The
No. 3, or 160-feet level, which is 450 feet in length, has been driven
from one end to the other of the ore body, and between it and the
surface practically all the ore has been stoped.
A main vertical shaft has been sunk, which has been con-
nected with this level by a crosscut, and also with the No. 4, or
237-feet level, which has been driven for a distance of 300 feet in
a well-defined body of stone, that in the south drive, which is
180 feet long, is richer than the northern, but the latter is improving
in the face.
From the No. 1 level a crosscut has been driven 100 feet east
and 110 feet west, but no other lode of any value was cut.
The outcrop of this lode can be traced throughout the entire
length of these two leases, and it is probably the northern extension
of one of the reefs worked upon the Aurelia which lies to the
southward. The lode is generally rather small in size, varying
from 18 inches to 3 feet, but is well defined with a polished and
striated footwall, which indicates that it is of the “ true or fissure "
type, the quartz having been deposited upon the wall of a fault, and
in consequence the fissure is probably of considerate extent.
Upon this field veins of this type are not usually so rich as
those of the segregation type, but are simpler deposits to handle
owing to the fact that, although the quartz may pinch out, the
fissure still remains as a guide or leader to further ore bodies.
The individual ore chutes are usually of greater length, and so
far their limit in depth has not been proved.
Upon this lease a large number of small shafts have been sunk
upon small parallel ore bodies, but as yet sufficient work has not
been done upon them to determine their character.
In sinking the main shaft, a small supply of salt water was
struck at a depth of 144 feet from the surface, but the supply is too
small to be of any value.
Since the gold returns from these leases are included in the
Company’s total, the actual amount yielded has been kindly
furnished by the manager.

small shoot of stone has been followed down into the last-
mentioned lease.
The Etrenna and Aurelia, G.M.Ls. 4965 z and 4966 z
leases are a portion of what was originally the Menzies Gold
Estates, Ltd., which Company worked them up to the year 1899.
In 1900 and 1901 the returns are given under the title of Etrenna
and Aurelia leases, after which date they became the property of
the Menzies Mining and Exploration Corporation, Ltd., and in
consequence the returns have been bulked, but the manager has
kindly supplied the figures with regard to the leases.
The Etrenna lease is a portion of what was originally the
Crusoe West, G.M.L. 3054 z, and upon it a vertical working shaft
has been sunk to a depth of 600 feet in extremely hard aphanitic
diorite [6331], with the object of cutting the dip of the Crusoe reefs
at 504 feet and 624 feet. As, however, no lode indications were
met with, this work was abandoned (Plate II.). Later develop-
ments in the Crusoe prove that the vein did not extend into this
lease. Epon the Aurelia, which was formerly called Wilson’s,
G.M.L. 3046 z, three parallel lines of reefs have been worked to a
vertical depth of from 80 to 110 feet, below which they decrease
both in size and value. The eastern reef has apparently a very long
outcrop, and if the working upon the Ishtar, G.M.L. 4976 z, which
lies to the south, are upon the same line, it gives a total length of
800 feet. The outcrop of this reef has been opened upon on this
lease for a length of 450 feet, and driven on at the 68-feet level for
a distance of 200 feet, and at the 95-feet level for 90-feet. It is a
well-defined reef but of low value, ISdwts. being about the highest,
the gold being worth little over =£3 10s. per ounce.
The central reef has been driven on at the 56-feet level for a
distance of 350 feet, and at the 87-feet level for 30 feet, the ore
chute giving out at the bottom.
The western reef has been worked for a length of 350 feet at
the 65-feet level and for 160 at the 112-feet level, beneath which
the stone was valueless.
These reefs have only been worked in the oxidised zone, but,
so far as can be judged, they are of the fissure type. If this should
prove to be the case they would be worthy of further development
in order to prove whether or not the veins increase in size and value

in the solid country, as 110 feet vertical depth is no criterion as to
what these lodes may possibly be at a depith.
The Ishtar, G-.M.L. 4976 z, is a portion of what was originally
one of the Crusoe block claims, No. 3148 z, and if it yielded any
gold under former ownership, the record has been bulked and lost.
The lease is now the property of the Menzies Mining and Explora-
tion Corporation, Ltd., whose crushing returns are furnished by the
manager. Seven shafts have been sunk upon what appears to be
the continuation to the southward of the Aurelia reef, but although
about 600 feet of driving has been done, no payable lode has been
cut.
The Aurelia West, G-.M.L. 601 lz, is the property of the Menzies
Mining and Exploration Corporation, Ltd., and is situated imme-
diately to the westward of the Aurelia.
A shaft has been sunk to a depth of 76 feet, and a crosscut
driven 200 feet east and west; in this latter a small vein of stone
was cut 30 feet west of the shaft, from which a crushing was taken;
at the -west end, 90 feet from the shaft, an altered dyke was passed
through. Fifty-six tons of stone crushed from this lease yielded
86'950z5. of fine gold.
The Maori, G.M.L. 5196 z., is situated within the township
boundaries at the northern side, and covered a portion of the Gov-
ernment Reserve, upon which are the Warden’s Court and Police
Station.
These leases were originally held by the Maori Gold Mines,
Ltd., in 1896 and 1897, which Company had one of the first bat-
teries at work upon the field. All the developments were confined
to one lease, No. 3059z,the principal portion of which was re-j)egged

it changed hands, and became the Maori, G.M.L. 4983 z ; whilst in
1904, with the name retained, it became G.M.L. 6196 z.
A considerable amount of work has been done, but the only
information obtainable was that a. vertical shaft had been sunk to a
depth of 280 feet without striking water.
The Freeman, G.M.L. 5039 z, is a portion of the original Maori,
and lies immediately south of the main workings upon what is now
the Railway Reserve, therefore all the old shafts have been filled in.
From this lease 3,000 tons of stone were crushed which yielded
20’750z5. of fine gold.
The Menzies United was the name by which G-.M.L. 3346 z
situated within and upon the south side of the town, was known.
In 1902 it was taken up as the Horseshoe, G.M.L. 5045 z, and in
1904 as the Menzies Horseshoe, G.M.L. 5145 z; it is now aban-
doned.


The Crusoe Gold Claims, Ltd., own four leases, viz., Robinson
Crusoe, G-.M.L. 2823 z; Robinson Crusoe East, G.M.L. 3009 z;
Naida, G-.M.L. 5017 z; and Friday, G.M.L. 5018 z. As now
constituted, it is an amalgamation of the Menzies Crusoe Gold
Claims, Ltd., and the Menzies Gold Reefs Proprietary, Ltd.
The Crusoe mine is situated upon lease 2,623 z., and consists,
roughly, of three groups of workings, besides a large quarry from
which a considerable quantity of auriferous gravel was raised, in
the laterite capped hill upon which the battery stands. The three
groups of workings may be classed as follows: —First, the extension
and dislocated extension of the Queensland Menzies lode, which
outcrops at the south-west corner of lease 3009 z, and underlays into
the south-east corner of 2828 z and the Queensland Menzies;
second, the central group which is situated about midway between
the other two groups at the centre of the southern portion of lease
2823 z; third, the main group lies in the centre and extends towards
the north-east corner of the same lease.
In 1895, Mr. H. Y. L. Brown says: “The lode formation in
this mine is a quartz reef associated with quartz and ironstone
veins in a white kaolin rock apparently a decomposed felsite. This
is of considerable width in places, but irregularly defined. Rich
specimens of gold are found in the formation generally.” #
First. A considerable amount of work has been done upon the
outcrop of the Queensland Menzies shoot, but the line of reef has
apparently been dislocated by cross courses. A deep shaft was
sunk and a considerable amont of crosscutting done to the north-
ward of this break, but no indications of the continuation of the
reef could be obtained. No. 3 shaft is an underlay in the corner of
lease 3009 z, and appears to have been sunk on a portion of the
Queensland Menzies outcrop, which was worked to a depth of 72
feet; all the other workings in this locality are inaccessible and
there are apparently no plans other than of No. 3 shaft.
Second. Here three shafts have been sunk upon a reef which
runs in a north-westerly direction, and dip to the south-west. From
the northern shaft B, a winze has been carried down 155 feet upon
a pipe of ore which dips south. A cross vein which strikes east and
west and underlays north passes through these workings, which are
not now accessible.
The main workings (Plate II.) lie about 270 feet to the north-
west of the last; the reef, which has a course of from north to a little
east of north, has been worked by a main vertical shaft 340 feet in
depth and a series of underlay shafts and winzes.
There were three shoots of ore in this mine; the first or
northern shoot was small and only about 40 feet in width, cutting
* Log. p. 4.


out at the 60 feet level. The second and third shoots were worked
as one continuous ore body of 280 feet in length from the surface
down to the 60 feet level, below which, however, the northern
portion pipes off decreasing in size to 80 feet at the 156 feet level,
and dying out about half-way between this level and the 235 feet
level. The southern shoot which was the largest and longest in the
mine was 170 feet wide at the 80 feet level, 130 feet at the 236 feet
level, but below this it suddenly closed in to 50 feet in width, which
gradually diminished until it died out altogether, a little below the
333 feet level. The sudden decrease in size is apparently due to the
fact that a thrust plane makes its appearance coming in diagonally
from the footwall, this may, if the dislocation took place after the
formation of the reef, have severed a portion of the shoot below the
235 feet level. Indications rather point, however, to the prior
existence of this thrust plane, in which case the reef fissure will be
found to terminate upon it; this question could have readily been
determined by an examination of the quartz at its contact with the
fault at the time the stone was being worked.
The quartz veins in this mine have no polished walls or casing,
the stone adhering firmly to the rock in the hard ground, whilst no
line of fissure is met with after the stone has ceased to exist,
therefore clearly pointing to their origin by segregation, and not by
the upflow of magmatic solutions. That no continuation of the ore
channel exists in depth has been clearly proved in the adjoining
property, where the Menzies G-old Estates, Ltd., stink a deep shaft
with the object of cutting this lode. Nothing, however, but very
solid rook was met with. There is no water in these workings,
whilst the country is fairly soft to the 235 feet level [6322, 6323,
6325, and 6326].
To the northward of these workings a small quartz body, with
a north-easterly course, has been worked to a depth of 144 feet, but
it has apparently no continuity.
Whilst doing some work in connection with the battery, which
is situated upon a low ironstone hill at the south-east corner of the
lease, a deposit of auriferous gravel was met with, the gold in which
was of a much higher value than that obtained from the reefs. A
number of small shafts were sunk, and a considerable amount of
crosscutting and trenching done with the object of locating the
source from which this gold was derived. Since, however, no reef
or leader was met with it is evident that this deposit is merely a
surface accumulation resulting directly from the weathering of the
rocks themselves, which often carry gold in small quantities along
this belt.
All the known ore-shoots upon this mine are practically worked
out, but as there is a considerable area of ground still unprospected
other veins may yet be discovered upon the property, whilst cross-
cutting below the 236 level may possibly reveal a dislocation of a
portion of the main ore-shoot.

Queensland Menzies Gold Mining Co., N.L. —This Company’s
property consisting of two leases, the Wedderburn, G.M.L. 2836 z,
and the Oceanic, G.M.L. 4969 z, is situated upon the main auriferous
belt, the Oceanic being within the town of Menzies, and the
Wedderburn immediately west of it and south of the Crusoe.
The Queensland Menzies mine is upon the Wedderburn lease,
whilst the Oceanic, from which a small amount of gold was
previously obtained, was taken up as a block claim in 1891, since
which time very little work was done until recent!v, when a long-
crosscut was started with the object of testing the lease for lodes.
The Wedderburn was taken up in 1895, in which year Mr. H.
Y. L. Brown says of it in his report: —“ This is a quartz reef in
which coarse gold is visible, striking N.N'.W.” # It has been con-
tinuously worked ever since, and has been one of the most profitable
mines in the Menzies district.
The outcrop of the reef was discovered at the north-east
corner of the lease, and was traced in the south-west corner of
the Crusoe, G.M.L. 3009 z, the entire length being something like
500 feet. '
The developments upon this mine, until quite recently, consisted
entirely of working shafts, levels, and winzes in the ore body, and
crosscuts from the shafts to the levels; when, however, the vein
gave signs of pinching out, at the instance of Dr. Jack, who was
called in to advise the owners, a certain amount of prospective
driving and crosscutting was undertaken.
A main vertical working shaft has been sunk to a depth of
540 feet, and an old main shaft 240 feet, an old water shaft 175
feet, and an underlay shaft 80 feet (Plate III.). Bight levels have
been driven at 60 feet, 90 feet, 183 feet, 230 feet, 300 feet, 366 feet,
446 feet, and 534 feet respectively, vertical depth from the surface,
* Loc, cit., p. 4.


the total length of which, inclusive of crosscuts, is about 3,000 feet.
From a crosscut at the No. 8 level the lode has been followed down
for a further distance of 210 feet on the dip to near the boundary
of the adjoining property, the bottom of which is 617 feet vertical
depth below the surface.
A small supply of salt waiter averaging about 100 gallons a
day was cut at 150 feet below the surface beneath which a zone of
about 50 feet of saturation was passed through, then hard imper-
vious rocks were encountered.
The rocks which enclose the ore bodies may be divided into
three zones, first, from the surface downwards about 100 feet may be
called the oxidised zone in which the rocks gradually pass from
yellow greasy clays into weathered schists of an argillaceous and
chloritic nature; in the second, which may be called the zone of
hydration, rocks of a more compact nature are met with, such as
serpentine and hornblende schists; whilst in the third, or sulphide
zone, which starts below the w r ater-charged rooks an extremely
hard aphanitic diorite is encountered, this rock, although presenting
no foliation, has a distinct cleavage which is identical with the
foliation of the schists ; this although not always apparent very
quickly develops upon exposure to the atmosphere, whilst the
dormant and accompanying cross heads are taken advantage of in
breaking ground [6311, 6312, and 6324].
The schists have a defined and very uniform foliation, the
planes striking 20 degrees west of north and underlaying at an
angle of about 45 degrees to the south-westward, whilst the ore
chutes lie upon and cross these planes diagonally dipping at an
angle of 35 degrees on a course of 15 degrees west of south.
The ore body in this mine although presenting the appearance
of one continuous lode in the oxidised zone composed of quartz
and formation on approaching the more solid country rapidly
formed into a number of pipe like veins, the largest of which received
distinctive names such as the western, eastern and hanging wall
veins. 'The breadth of these combined ore bodies decreases rapidly
with depth, starting with 500 feet (inclusive of the Crusoe) near
the surface they become reduced to 150 feet at the 446 feet level,
whilst the total width at the bottom of the winze, the lowest portion
of the mine, does not exceed 20 feet. This is not only due to the
diminution in size of the individual veins, but more particularly to
the fact that they gradually die out one after the other until at the
bottom only one remains and that very emaciated.
The ore-shoot in this mine has an exceptional length for a vein
of this character in this district, it being 1,125 feet on the dip from
the surface to the present bottom.
The individual quartz bodies vary very greatly in size, being of
a lenticular pipe-like form; they start from nothing, gradually
expanding until their maximum thickness, which may be many feet,
is attained, then gradually diminish again. In consequence, it is


impossible to state what is the average size of the stone, but if the
area of the stoped ground is taken, and the stone crushed cubed
back into the solid, it gives an average of something like two feet
of stone, which has averaged over of fine gold per ton.
These veins have no walls, in the accepted mining sense, the
quartz being attached to the enclosing rock, whilst small strings of
quartz often penetrate it for a considerable distance. The solid
diorite rock in the immediate vicinity of the veins often carries gold
in appreciable quantities, specimens having occasionally been met
with in which coarse particles of gold were visible without the aid
of a glass.
The enclosing fissures present all the appearance of shrinkage
contortion cracks, having no continuity in depth nor length, and,
although a number of them may occur in a group, or even upon the
same planes of foliation, no connection whatever exists between
them; they are therefore clearly segregation veins, the mineral
matter, including the gold, having been infilled by percolation,
either vertical, lateral, or both.
The group of veins worked m this mine lie at a point where a
slight change in the course of the foliation has taken place; there-
fore the formation of the fissures may be due to the crumpling or
buckling of the rocks after the release by thrusts of the lateral
pressure, which caused their elongation or stretching. The quartz
in the sulphide zone is often heavily charged with galena and iron
pyrites, the former being a sure indication of the presence of gold.
To the eastward or upon the footwall side of the ore body, a belt of
indurated and highly fissile schist is encountered at several points
in this mine, where cross-cutting has been done in that direction ;
this is clearly a thrust plane and is said to cause a fall in the ore
values when it approaches the lode.
Upon the western side or hanging wall, a large well-defined
quartz body, very heavily charged with pyrites, called the mineral
lode, has been cut at several points, but this body carries very little
gold.
Driving in this mine along the course of the lode has failed so
far to disclose any other ore bodies, but in order to make this pros-
pecting thorough, the country should be cross-cut, at intervals
of at least every 50 feet to the schist on the one side and the
mineral lode on the other ; should this fail to disclose the presence
of other chutes, it may be assumed that the veins in this mine do
not extend north and south beyond the buckled area referred to
above, in which, however, there is still the chance of other veins
being picked up, and this point should be determined before any
further exploration is undertaken.
Since these veins are apparently filled by percolation and have
proved to be more numerous, of greater size and richness in the
upper levels, prospecting in that portion of the mine would offer
greater possibilities than the lower levels, but at the same time veins
cut in the latter are almost certain to extend into the former, but on

the other hand those met with in the former may or may not extend
into the latter. This lode on the whole has been free from trouble, the
first fault being met with near the bottom of the mine ; this threw the
reef several feet to the eastward, but upon a second fault being
encountered further work was abandoned since the stone w T as not
only small and of little value but there was no great distance to
drive to the boundary of this property.
The Oceanic, G.M.L. 4969 z, adjoins the Wedderburn upon the
east, and covers a portion of the township. It is now the property
of the Queensland Menzies Co., but was worked as G.M.L. 4920 z
in 1899, when 10L00 tons of stone were crushed, yielding 62T3 ozs.
of gold. Since then the Company has crushed 50'00 tons, which
yielded 26 - 52 ozs. of gold.
The Menzies Gold Reefs Proprietary, Ltd., which has now
amalgamated with the Menzies Crusoe Gold Claims, Ltd., under
the title of the Crusoe Gold Claims, Ltd., originally owned a large
number of leases, situated at different parts of this district, but
finally abandoned all with the exception of the Friday G.M.L. 2825 z
and Naida G.M.L. 3016 z, and it was upon the former of these
that all the work was concentrated in what was known as the
Friday mine.
This mine is situated to the southward of the Queensland
Menzies, and to the westward of the town, at about the centre of
the main auriferous belt. It was taken up in the year 1895, and
was shortly after inspected by Mr. H. Y. L. Brown, who says:—
“This possesses a well-defined quartz reef, having a strike north-west
and northerly, and dipping south-west at an angle of about 40
degrees. The veinstone consists of bluish, laminated, and veined
quartz, containing galena, pyrites, and coarse gold.” #
• Loc. cit., p. 4.


This mine has now been completely closed down for some
years ; the following information is, therefore, taken entirely from
the working plans, records, and information obtained from reliable
sources (Plate IY.).
There are three main levels in this mine : No. 1, or 80-feet, is
350 feet long; No. 2, or 150-feet level, is 450 feet long ; No. 3, or
200-feet level, is 500 feet long ; whilst from the No. 3 level a winze
has been sunk to a depth of 100 feet upon the underlay of the lode,
and from it a level has been driven for a distance of 70 feet at a
vertical depth of 240 feet, or 30 feet from the bottom of the winze.
In the Menzies United, Ltd., property, which adjoins this lease to
the south, the continuation of this lode wag cut, and proved to be
of no value, and died out at the 388-feet level.
Two underlay shafts connect the No. 1 level with the surface,
whilst a main vertical shaft has been sunk to the 200-feet level. A
crosscut has been driven from the 150-feet level 180 feet east, where
a mineral lode wa.s cut, which is evidently the same reef as outcrops
at the surface, near the eastern boundary.
Judging from the plan a defined ore-shoot with a southerly
dip was worked down to the 200-feet level beneath which it tapered
off into a pipe, becoming small and low in value, until work was
abandoned before the boundary was reached. This ore body dipped
at an angle of 53 degrees at the north end but flattened to 40 degrees
towards the south; the thickness of the stone is said to have ranged
from three to 18 inches.
Good stock water was struck at a depth of 129 feet, the daily
yield being estimated at 500 gallons.
This reef was evidently of the lenticular fissure type, and pro-
bably consisted of a series of pipes, which become more or less
united in the upper levels ; the southernmost one, as is generally the
case, extended to a greater depth than the others. The continuation
of this shoot was cut in the Menzies United, Ltd., lease Balkis, which
adjoins and will be mentioned later.
With the exception of the crosscut east to the mineral lode
mentioned above, little prospecting has been done to prove to prove
the existence of other lodes, whilst upon the Naida, which adjoins
to the north, and upon which the battery is located, absolutely no
work has been done.
Since these leases (the Friday and Naida, which are now held)
are situated in the very heart of the auriferous belt, it is very
probable that other reefs may exist beneath the alluvial covering;
this could be determined by trenching and crosscutting for a fairly
moderate cost.
It was mentioned previously that the Queensland Menzies shoot
was lost on a fault near its boundary ; had this continued it would
have extended into the Naida, which adjoins it to the westward.
Judging, however, from the character of the vein at the bottom of

the mine, there is little prospect of stone of any value conti lining
alt hough a small pipe of quartz may do so.
The Menzies United Mines, Ltd. —This Company owned a group
of leases to the westward of the Friday, upon one of which, called
Baleis, (4. ML. 3151 z, a deep shaft was sunk with the object of
cutting the underlay of the Friday load. The position chosen for
this shaft was unfortunate, owing to the fact that no allowance was
made for the southerly pitch of the ore-shoot (which at the time
was probably not demonstrated); this necessitated extension driving
through barren ground in a southerly direction in order to pick it
up, this work being of absolutely no value from an exploratory point
of view T .
At a vertical depth of 388 feet, a level was driven south from
the main shaft for a distance of 330 feet, when it encountered a
small vein which split into two to the southward. (Plate IV.)
At the junction of the two veins a rise was carried up on this
small ore body towards the Friday boundary, and a small inter-
mediate level driven south 65 feet. A small parcel of stone was
crushed from this rise and level but the vein was too small to be
remunerative. Two crosscuts were driven, one east and one west,
from the 888-feet level to the northward of the ore-shoot in which
nothing was cut resembling a formation.
At a depth of 150 feet stock water was cut, which yielded a
supply of about 400 gallons per diem.
Upon the leases owned by this Company a total of about 2,000
feet of sinking and 2,500 feet of driving has been done without
result.
The Balkis is at present held by the Menzies Mining and
Exploration Corporation, Ltd., which Company’ has failed to prove
the lease of any value, whilst the others have been pretty well pros-
pected since their abandonment without result.

From this lease 132 tons of stone have been crushed, which
yielded 138ozs. of fine gold.
The Central Menzies Gold Mines, Ltd. —This Company also
owned a lease called the Emulator, G.M.L. 2834 z, which lies to the
north of the Friday, upon which 484 feet of sinking and 790 feet of
crosscutting was done with the object of cutting the northern
extension of that reef. All this work, however, proved to be
valueless.
The only crushing from this lease was in 1900, when 19'00 tons
were treated, and yielded 18T5ozs. of gold.
The Menzies, Ltd. —This was another of the old Exploration
Company’s, that held a number of leases, consisting of the Lady
Shenton North, Gr.M.L. 2826 z, Florence North, Gr.M.L. 2828 z,
Pericles, G.M.L. 2829 z, Shirkin, Gr.M.L. 3050 z., Fenuine, Gr.M.L.
3061 z, Bantry, G.M.L. 3065 z, and Stuart, G.M.L. 3056 z. Upon these
leases, with the exception of the Shirkin, of which lease no plans
exist, 700 feet of sinking and 1,360 feet of driving was done, the
only reproductive work being upon the Shenton N orth, where the
outcrop of a lode was worked which dips into the Leonidas.
This Company appears to have abandoned these leases in 1901,
when they were retaken by the various Companies and parties of
working miners.
Plying Fish Leases. —These leases are situated upon a portion
of what was originally the Shirkin, which lies upon the south-west
side of the town, and to the north-east of the Friday. They have
been worked continuously since 1901 upon some small but rich
quartz veins of the usual segregation type in the oxidised zone.
The Lady Shenton North. —This lease, as stated above, was
worked by the Menzies, Ltd., from 1898 to 1900, after which it was
abandoned, since which it has been taken many times in varying
forms by working miners, who have pretty well riddled the ground
from the old workings to the surfaces of a lode which outcrops
upon it, but underlies into, and has been worked upon, the Leonidas,
the adjoining lease to the westward [756.]

The Leonidas, Q-.M.L. 2882 z lease, which is the pro-
perty of the Menzies Mining and Exploration Corporation, Ltd.,
runs in a more easterly direction than is usual; it was taken up on
the dip or western side of a line of lode which outcropped in the
Shenton North and Pericles.
There are three groups of workings which may be upon dis-
located portions of the same vein, the outcrops of which were
worked in the Shenton North to a depth of 100 feet below which it
passed into this lease.
At the end of this lease a vertical shaft has been sunk to a
depth of 130 feet, from which a level has been driven 70 feet north
and 110 feet south, a winze was also sunk upon the lode; and
another level driven at 172 feet, north 90 feet and south 110 feet,
the reef averaging' here a little over 12 inches in thickness, worth
13dwts.
The water-level in these workings was 152 feet, the yield being
150 gallons of salt water per diem.
A little south another vein which outcrops in the Shenton
North has been worked by two vertical shafts to the 77-feet level,
which is 150 feet long, from which the lode was winzed down on to
the 122-feet level, and from this depth the lode was driven on for
a length of 300 feet; from the other shaft, a winze was sunk to the
170-feet level which was carried on for a distance of 70 feet.
Farther south but still upon the north-eastern boundary,
another small quartz vein has been worked by a vertical shaft to a
depth of 143 feet, and a level driven 220 feet, the reef at this level
averaging about 12 inches, worth about lOdwts. The returns
furnished by the manager are as f0110w:—3,457 tons of stone have
been crushed, which yielded 2,948'710z5. of fine gold.


The Florence Gold Mines, Ltd.— This property, which consists of
the Florence G.M.L. 2821 z, Pericles G.M.L. 2829 z, Florence
Extended G.M.L,, 5203 z, and Bantry G.M.L. 3055 z, is situated
upon the main auriferous belt north and adjoining the Lady
Shenton and south of the Friday.
The whole of the work done by this Company may be said to
be confined to the Florence lease, the first start being made by sink-
ing a main shaft to a depth of 210 feet near the centre of the
property with the object of cutting the Lady Shenton lode. From
this shaft cross-cuts were driven in a north-easterly direction at the
60-feet level for a distance of 435 feet, at 110 feet for a distance of
173 feet, and at 160 feet for a distance of 142 feet. In the 60-feet
cross-cut a small body of stone was cut dipping south at a distance
of 285 feet from the shaft, which was driven on 27 feet west, and
135 feet east; this level is connected with the surface where this reef
outcrops by an underlay shaft.
This vein was also cut in the two lower cross-cuts, being driven
on for a distance of 30 feet east at the 110-feet level and 75 feet
west and 90 feet east at the 160-feet level. At the end of this
eastern drive, a cross-course dipping to the northward was cut and
followed east for 16 feet. This cross-course is evidently the same
as outcrops at the surface to the southward of the main shaft. At
200 feet from the surface a small drive east and west was driven
from the shaft.
In 1898, the Shenton Company having traced one of these rich
shoots up to the south boundary of the Florence, work was started
in that locality and what is called the New Main Shaft sunk to a
depth of 300 feet and the reef worked by means of three levels.
This reef proved to be the top of the Shenton northern shoot
which was found to be considerably broken in the lower levels by
cross-courses in both properties and to die out before reaching the
300-feet level, whilst to the northward the top of the shoot which
dips south ended abruptly upon coming in contact with an east and
west cross-course dipping north. This cross-course which terminates
the lode has been met with at a distance of 40 feet north of the
boundary in the 60-feet level, 100 feet in the 150-feet level, whilst
in the 200-feet level it was cut at a distance of 135 feet but the
level was not continued because the ore-shoot stops on another
cross-course met with in this level at a distance of 80 feet from the
boundary which governs its northern extent down to the 260-feet
intermediate level below which there is no stone. (Plate V.)
A winze was sunk on the formation from the bottom of the
main shaft for a depth of 213 feet, but in it no stone was cut. At
150 feet from the surface the level was continued beyond the cross-
course for a distance of 135 feet, from which point cross-cuts w r ere
driven 100 feet both east and west without result and thus proving
that the Shenton reef did not continue north.

One of the porphyritic dykes crosses this lease between the
two main shafts striking west-north-west and follows the out-
crop of the Leonidas lodes, whilst another branch from it was cut in
the old main shaft, from which point it appears to run north-west,
being cut in the Pericles [8343] and the cross-cut in the Shenton
North. These dykes in no case where observed appear to have
caused any disturbance so far as the lodes are concerned, since these
latter often cross or follow them [63421.
A number of other small segregation veins which cross this prop-
erty upon the normal north-westerly course have been opened up and
are still being worked in the oxidised zone; it is from this source
that the entire production of the mine has been derived for the last
year or two.
At the north-east corner of the lease is a water-shaft called the
donkey shaft, in which the water-level is 200 feet, the yield being
estimated at 6,000 gallons per diem, and is stated to be suitable for
stock. There is also a water-shaft on the Florence Extended,
G-.M.L. 5203, which was originally the Penine.G.M.L. 3051, being 213
feet in vertical depth with a cross-cut west 241 feet and east 120
feet at the 157-feet level and 40 feet east at the 213-feet level. In
the Pericles, a shaft has been sunk to a depth of 100 feet and a
cross-cut driven 231 feet in a north-east direction in which only
small veins of stone were cut.
The Lady Shenton Gold Mine, Ltd. —This mine, which is situ-
ated to the southward of the town, upon G-.M.Ls. (1380), 2820 z, and
3006 z, was not only the first discovery made in this district but it
also proved to be by far the richest.
It was discovered in September, 1894, by Messrs. Menzies and
McDonald, who were able to trace the outcrop of the lode for a
length of over 100 feet by rich specimens scattered upon the
surface.


In 1896, Mr. H. Y. L. Brown writes;—“This is on two quartz
reefs, one of which strikes north 20 degrees west, and the other east
and west. The angle of the underlie averages 45 degrees, but in
some places it is less. The gold occurs in quartz, and is often
associated with galena and zinc blende. The rocks consist of
argillaceous talcose schist above the water-level, with hornblendic
slate below. In connection with the quartz-reefs, there is a soft
soapy clay which is apparently a decomposed felspathic rock ; other
shafts near are sunk in green chloritic talcose and argillaceous
schists and brown decomposed igneous rocks.” * [1036-1044]
This mine is now full of water to a little above the No. 6 level,
whilst above the No. 5 level, which is the lowest that is accessible,
practically all the ore has been stoped and most of the stopes filled
in. Lately this mine has been in the hands of tnbuters who have
not improved matters from an inspection point of view, since in
working portions of the reef which were much disturbed or con-
sidered too small by the Company a considerable quantity of rock
had to be broken which was not worth raising and was therefore
packed below, thus blocking up places that were accessible before.
Both in the stopes and levels very large excavations have been
taken out in places; these however do not, it is stated, represent
the size of the quartz-vein, but either the enriched rock zone adjoin-
ing ora series of veins with interbedded rock.
The mine was first opened by underlay shafts from the sur-
face by means of which some very rich stone and enriched
decomposed rock (formation) was worked, but later on a vertical
shaft was sunk to a depth of 200 feet where it cut the lode in the
hard sulphide zone, and from the bottom of this shaft the No. 4
level was driven. Above this level the country softens rapidly,
passing from schistose rock into a yellow and brown argillaceous
formation. The Nos. 5 and 6 levels were worked by a winze
sunk close to the shaft bottom, whilst another main winze was sunk
further north from the No. sto the No. 8 level. (Plate Y.)
' In the west lease a main shaft was sunk in very hard country
to the dip called Ray’s shaft to a depth of 620 feet; this shaft is now
connected with the Nos. 8 and 9 levels by cross-cuts. [6341.]
Although no water was encountered in the original workings it
was cut in this shaft at a depth of 100 feet, below which a water-
bearing zone of 200 feet was passed through, the yield varying from
1,000 to 6,000 gallons per diem.
All the stopes are situated above the No. 6 level, for below
this, in spite of the fact that a strong reef was followed down upon
which a considerable quantity of work has been done, no ore of a
payable character was met with.
The ore-body in this mine was of a composite character, i.e.
it consisted of a number of more or less lens-shaped quartz veins or
* Loc. at., p. 4.


pipes (elongated lenses) which follow the foliation planes of the
rock in a south-westerly direction, the dip of the pianos varying
here from 53 degrees at the north end of the mine to 45 degrees
at the south.
The auriferous veins lie upon these planes, dipping diagonally
across them at an angle of 34 degrees to the southward, thus the
northern shoot that was worked in the Florence dips into the
Shenton whilst the main shoot in this mine dips into the Alpha.
In the oxidised zone the character of these shoots was not well
defined owing to the presence of a large number of minor reins and
theenrichment of theadjoining decomposed rock dueto concentration;
as a consequence the true character of this ore body was not under-
stood until the more solid country was reached where the veins
began to contract into pipes. The impression gathered with regard
to this lode some years ago was that a large rich formation
enclosing a more or less broken quartz reef extended from one end
of the upper levels to the other; whilst in the sulphide zone the
quartz-reef had formed into a definite solid body of variable size
enclosed in a formation the walls of which had not been cut.
Near the surface the whole of the stone and formation was
worked for a length of something over 600 feet, whilst below this
the breadth of the ore body steadily increased until at the No. 4
level (200 feet) it extended for a length along the levels inclusive of
the Florence of over 1,000 feet. Directly this level was passed and
the sulphide zone entered the lode split up into three definite
shoots with blank ground between them, whilst below the three
shoots gradually contracted until at a vertical depth of about 300
feet they died out altogether.
The quartz in this mine has no defined walls or casing, and
where a semblance of a wall is met with it is found upon careful
examination to be only one of the cleavage planes of the rock upon
which the vein has been formed. Individual quartz-veins, as far as
can be judged from the small veins now being worked, have no
connection with each other but lie upon parallel planes of cleavage
often overlapping each other, or in the case of three may lie in a
splice-like manner. No signs of fissure plane can be observed
although often in driving small threads of quartz have been
followed for a considerable distance, which gave the impression that
such a plane was being followed. These veins were often most
misleading, since upon several occasions in this mine these were
follo'wed until they died out, whilst other ore-bodies existing upon
parallel planes w T ere missed and not discovered until later by cross-
cutting. The ore-body in this mine is considerably disturbed by a
series of cross-courses, some of which are represented by solid
barren quartz-veins. These cross-fissures, which mostly run in a
more or less east and west direction and dip to north, generally
follow the cross joints of the rock and have in cases displaced the
ore body, the throw being either east or west according to whether


they are normal or reversed faults. They are in all probability
inclined Y faults, the southernmost of the pair being more oblique
than the northern.
In places in this mine two or more minor faults have appar-
ently intersected the lode in close proximity, causing such consider-
able disruption that even driving the levels through them was
attended with considerable danger and difficulty, whilst certain
portions of the ore-body could not be worked. This ore in many
places has now been taken out by the tributers but it shows in the
accompanying plan of the stopes as solid ground. (Plate No. Y.)
Although these faults have undoubtedly caused considerable
trouble in places it is quite apparent that many of the so-called
displacements are nothing of the kind but simply represent the
southern termination of one vein, whilst another has been met with
upon parallel planes either east or west.
At the present time about the only point in the mine where
the true pitch of the ore-pipes can be observed is in what is called
the P. Grade, which is situated near the north-east corner of the
Alpha between Nos. 4 and 5 levels. The shoot here has a well-
marked pitch of about 34 degrees south, but comes to a sudden
stop upon the cross-course which has at this point dislocated the
lode. If the grade of this shoot is followed upwards to the surface
through the oxidised zone it will be found to cross the No. 2 level
to the eastward of the main shaft and to come out upon the surface
at the point where the original rich outcrop was discovered, whilst
if followed downwards after allowing for the throw it will be
found to continue to the bottom level of the Alpha. If this is
taken as the true dip of the ore-shoots in this mine (which is
supported by the fact that the grade is identical with the ore-shoots
in the other mines) it becomes apparent at once that there are
three main shoots all of which terminate at the No. 6 level, whilst
at the south end there is either another short one or, which is
more probable, it represents the splaying out of this shoot similar
to the Queensland Menzies. This is not at all an uncommon
characteristic of this class of lode, the ore-body presenting the
appearance of a series of inclined V’s, the apex of which points
south, the lower side dipping at an angle of about 35 degrees,
whilst the upper, which is much more acute, is bounded by a line
which dips at an angle of from 70 to 75 degrees; this is on the
inclined plane, not as appears in the foreshortened vertical section
of the ore-shopts, Plate Y.
This splaying out of the ore-shoot towards the surface in a more
or less vertical manner causes the various distinct chutes met with
below to unite in the upper levels and in consequence to appear
like one continuous ore-body.
It is not at all clear that the strong reef which is reported to
have been cut in the workings below the No. 6 level is the


continuation of the rich ore body worked above, but this point
could not be investigated on account of the water. It would be
quite exceptional to find a vein of this class continuing strongly in
depth without gold values, the usual character being for a rich vein
to gradually decrease in size and to finally die out, and this is said
to have been the case at the terminations of the ore-shoots at the
No. 6 level. It is quite possible that a barren lenticular body has
formed at most generally parallel to these termini, but it is much
more probable in this case that the barren footwall reef has been
cut and followed down since this has the appearance of being a
much more permanent body.
In any case the deeper workings are so situated as to have
little prospect of cutting the ore-shoots if they continued, and as
will be seen by reference to Plate No. V. that the No. 7 level
and the extension south end of No. 8 could only possibly
have cut the Florence shoot, which being the northern chute, if this
ore-body follows the general character, would be the least likely to
continue.
The other ore-shoots lie well to the southward of these workings
and would rapidly cross the boundary into the Alpha, this however
is apparently not the case as is demonstrated by the extensive
works carried out upon the last-mentioned property, a description of
which will be given next.
The cross-section of the mine reproduced was prepared by Mr.
Hubert Falconer, the manager, and shows the relation of the
Shenton lode to a granite dyke which lies to the eastward.
(Plate V.)
This dyke can be traced at points upon the surface and by the
dumps along its course for a considerable distance, and is the same
which crosses the Florence Mine after splitting into two branches.
Although a solid porphyritic granite was cut in the bore at the
bottom of the main shaft and also in the extension east of the No.
8 cross-cut, this dyke has been subjected to the same conditions such
as hydration with attendant crushing that have changed the diorite
into schists, the alteration in this case being from granite to gneiss,
gneiss to mica and sericite schist, the foliation of which is identical
with that of the surrounding rocks. [6336.]
This added to the fact that in no instance has a dyke been
known to dislocate a lode whilst the quartz-bodies are found in and
crossing them proves their prior existence to the lodes, which latter
were apparently nut formed until after hydration had taken place.
This Company has employed every practicable means at its
disposal in order to determine the extension of the ore-body, its
leases being riddled with drives, cross-cuts, winzes and bore-holes;
therefore with the exception of small parallel pipes of stone there is
apparently little prospect of a continuation of the ore-shoot being
discovered.

Note,-
-This reef should be credited with some 5,000 ozs. from the Florence and
10,000 ozs, from the Alpha, but no record of the exact quantity obtained from it is available.
The Menzies Alpha Leases, Ltd.— This property, which consists
of the Stirling, G-.M.L. 3031 z, and the Alpha, G.M.L. 30Liz, is
situated immediately south of the Lady Shenton, but it was not
until 1900 that the rich ore-shoot worked in that mine was found
to extend into this property. Previous to this mining had been
carried on upon the Stirling lease upon a reef which crossed the
boundary about 160 feet from the north-east corner peg, which was
supposed to be the extension of the Shenton reef ; this now appears
either to be the displaced continuation of the barren reef which lies
to the eastward or upon the footwall side of it, or a pyrites lode
which has been met with in the mine upon the hanging wall side.
At the south end of this reef, which outcrops for a distance of
about 300 feet, a vertical shaft, called Armstrong’s shaft, has been
sunk to a depth of 276 feet, which passed through the reef at
150 feet. At a depth of 205 feet a crosscut was driven 25 feet
west, at which point it cut the reef and followed it for a distance of
40 feet. From the bottom of the shaft a crosscut was driven 110
feet to the eastward, but in it no lode was cut [750, 7641.
A bore was then put down at the north-east comer peg, which
cut the lode at a depth of 250 feet. A main shaft was sunk 123
feet south of this point to a depth of 335 feet, with a crosscut at
250 feet from which No. 1 level was driven, whilst No. 2 was driven
from the bottom of the main shaft. (Plate Y.)
In the No. 1 level the ore body extended south for a distance
of 220 feet from the Shenton boundary, after which it died out, no
continuation of it being discovered in the level which was continued
for another 120 feet.
The No. 2 level was driven from the main shaft north to the
boundary where the small terminal points of the shoot were met
with; in places this also continued for 40 feet south of the shaft,.

after -which no further ore was discovered, although 480 feet were
driven in hard aphanatic diorite [6330],
In this level the last 300 feet were driven in a solid, barren
quartz reef, which gradually formed and which is, in all proba-
bility, the same vein as was cut in the Armstrong shaft; however,
no connection between these workings has yet been made.
From this level a considerable amount of crosscutting and
boring has been done without result, whilst, from the bottom of the
main shaft, a winze has been carried down on the dip of the
formation for a further distance, of 363 feet. From this winze a
certain amount of boring and crosscutting has been done, which
must, if the Shenton ore-shoot extended in this direction, have cut
it, or, at least, some indication of it.
From this, it appears that the Shenton ore-shoots do not extend
below the No. 2 level in this mine, which is the continuation of the
No. 6 in the other, or, in other words, these veins cease to exist
below the level to which the action of hydration has extended.
Upon the Alpha lease, which lies to the southward of the
Stirling, a considerable amount of work has been done upon some
small rich reefs that were met with near the south-east corner; one
of these, which follows the general north-west course, has been
worked by a number of underlay shafts to a depth of 60 feet, and,
below this, by means of a winze to 100 feet. From this reef some
rich stone was raised; but, since it is small, and the country hard
below the existing workings, it has not been considered advisable to
continue deeper. The line of the reef northward seems pretty
constant, to judge by the number of prospecting shafts sunk upon
it, but, immediately south, on approaching the Little Wonder, it is
extremely broken, the dip changing even in a short distance.
The Alpha South, G.M.L. 3098 z, is situated south of the Alpha,
and was until quite recently held by the Menzies Mining and

Exploration Corporation, Ltd. Little work has been done upon it ;
the deepest shaft being 80 feet, from which 65 tons of stone were
crushed, yielding 64'400z5. of gold.
TheMeriyulali, G.M.L. 4960 z, is situated south of the Alpha
South, and upon it some small quartz veins have been worked in
the oxidised zone for the last six years.
The Heart’s Content, G M. L. 4947 z, is a small lease which lies
to the south of the last, and was worked in the years 1900 and 1901,
a shaft being sunk to a depth of 70 feet on a small quartz vein from
which 44 tons of stone were raised which yielded 82’370z5. of gold.
The Menzies Mining and Exploration Corporation, Ltd. —This
Company owns a number of leases mentioned previously under their
distinctive names, but this group of leases which constitute the
head quarters of the Company consist of the Castle Blarney, G.M.L.
3106 z ; Lady S hen ton East, G.M.L. 2843 z ; Lady Shenton Extended,
G.M.L. 2844 z; and Shenton South East, G.M.L. 4948 z, all situated
to the eastward of the Lady Shenton.
In the Extended, a small cross vein which strikes a little east
of north, and dips to the south at an angle of 45 degrees has been
worked by means of two underlay and one vertical shaft to a depth
of 158 feet. From these levels have been driven at 62 feet, 200 feet
long; at 99 feet, 200 feet long; and at 146 feet, 130 feet long, and
from these workings 1,463 tons of stone were raised and crushed,
yielding 1,157'470z5. of fine gold.
On the Shenton East, an east and west reef consisting of two
parallel pipes of stone have been worked to a depth of 199 feet by
three underlay shafts with short levels and crosscuts, at 51 feet,
85 feet, 122 feet, 164 feet, and 199 feet. A main vertical shaft has
also been started and sunk to a depth of 218 feet, but it has not yet
been connected with the other workings on the lode. In this shaft,
a supply of good stock water equal to 1,000 gallons per diem was
cut at a depth of 155 feet. From this mine 1,770 tons of stone were
crushed, which yielded 2,440d20z5. of gold. The veins cut and
worked in these two properties do not appear to be cross courses, but
have simply been formed by the buckling of the strata.

The Shenton South-East, G.M.L. 4948 z, is south of the Lady
Shenton and Shenton Extended ; it consists of portions of the Lady
Shenton No. 1, G.M.L. 2824, and Lady Shenton South Extended,
G.M.L. 3458 z, the former of which was owned by the Menzies Gold
Beefs Proprietary, Limited, who sank a shaft 100 feet and crosscut
from the bottom 450 feet west in the hopes of cutting the Shenton
lode; they also sank two shafts near the north boundary which are
connected by a crosscut 150 feet long. With the exception of this,
little work has been done upon this lease from which a parcel of 37
tons of stone was crushed, yielding 37'80ozs. of gold. Upon the
Castle Blarney, which lies to eastward of the Extended and between
it and the Railway, a few prospecting shafts have been sunk, the
deepest of which is 50 feet.
The Golden Age or Little Wonder Group —This group of leases
cover, or at one time have covered, portions of the old leases Golden
Age, G.M.L. 2,830 z; Adelaide, G.M.L. 3378 z; and Lady Shenton
No, 1, G.M.Ls. 2424 z and 3074 z.
The Golden Age was worked in the earliest days of this field
by the Menzies Golden Age Gold Mine, Limited, upon a small but
rich east and west reef, the shoot in which dips to the south to the
80 feet level, beneath this, although considerable prospecting was
done in serpentine schist, no continuation of the vein was met with.
Five shafts were sunk, the total depth of which is 730 feet,
the deepest being 260 feet, in which the water level was cut at
173 feet; besides these shafts 180 feet of winzing has been done,
1,470 feet of drives and crosscuts. The lode is apparently of the
budded type, as there is no indication of a cross reef, the only
outcrop being a large pyrites body which follows the normal course
and is probably the same as cut to the northward in the
Shenton No. 1.
In some portion of this mine the porphyritic granite dyke was
cut out, and from these dumps a finer series of specimens were
obtained illustrative of its gradual change into sericite schist
[6332-4]- Portions of this lease have more recently been worked as
the Federation, G.M.L. 4959 z; and Golden Age, G.M.Ls. 5005 z,
and 5092 z, whilst the Little Wonder also occupies a part.

The two leases named Lady Shenton No. 1—28247 z and 3074 z,
which were owned by the Gold Reefs Proprietary, Limited, have,
besides the Shenton South-East, G.M.L. 4948 z, in the north, being
divided up into the Menzies Main Reef, G.M.L. 5149 z ; Golden
Crown, G.M.L. 4973 z ; Hayles and Taverstocks United, G.M.L.
5000 z ; Little Wonder North, G.M.L. 5171 ; and the balance of the
Little Wonder, G.M.L. 5189 z.
The original Company, besides the 460 feet and 150 feet of
crosscutting mentioned previously, sank several shafts, in one of
which a large pyrites lode assaying from two to three penny-
weights was cut at 100 feet, being probably the same as that met
with in the Golden Age, G.M.L. 2830 z.
Upon these minor leases, as a rule, little has been done with
the exception of raising a little stone from the old workings.
The Little Wonder, G.M.L. 5189 z, is situated to the eastward of
the Alpha South, G.M.L. 3098 z, upon portion of what were the
Shenton No. 1, G.M.L. 3074 z, and the Golden Age, G.M.L. 3830 z.
There are several lines of stone in this lease, but until recently
most of the work was confined to the Golden Age and Central lines,
lately, however, work has been started more to the westward, upon
a promising ore body.

The Adelaide, G.M.L. 3378 z, is an old lease whicli lies to the
eastward of the Golden Age, and upon it a good many prospecting
shafts have been sunk. Lately a portion of it has been worked as
the Baden Powell, but so far only in the oxidised zone upon small
quartz veins.
To the south and south-west of these are the Cosmopolitan,
G.M.L. 4961 z; Broken Seal, G.M.L. 5022 z; and Nugget, G.M.L.
5209 z, upon which a number of shallow workings have been sunk
upon small quartz veins.
McClay’s Welcome Gold Mining Company, N.L. —This Company,
which owned Taipo, Q-.M.L, 3744 z, and Taipo South, G.M.L. 3840 z,
which are situated to the southward of the Golden Age, worked
these leases in 1897 and 1898 by means of a 62 feet north shaft
from which a level was driven south from the bottom for a distance
of 113 feet to the next shaft which is 132 feet deep with a level nine

boundary of the south lease and is 102 feet deep.
The vein in these workings is small and of low value, being
associated with a porphyritic granite dyke [6336]-

mental character.
The Alexandria, or Sherez, G:M.L. 3098 z, is situated at the
north end of a parallel line of reef to the westward of the Lady
Shenton. A few shafts have been sunk varying in depth from 60
to 100 feet, from which 171 tons of stone were raised, which yielded
201'40ozs. of gold.
The Africander, G.M.L. 5253 z, is immediately south of the last
mentioned, and upon it a great deal of shallow work has been done,
small veins being apparently worked from the surface down in the
oxidised zone and for considerable lengths. It has been -worked off
and on since 1898 either by companies or parties of working miners.
The London and Coolgardie Explorers, Ltd. —This company
owned the Last Chance, G.M.L. 3116 z, and Mersey, G.M.L. 3118 z,
which lie immediately south and east of the Africander, and upon
this a good deal of shallow sinking along the course of small ore
bodies has been carried on for a number of years.

The Crown Cross Group. —South of the last mentioned, and
upon the same line of country, is the Crown Cross, Q-.M.L. 4 912 z,
upon which a long line of reefs appears to have been worked by a
series of shafts to a depth of about 100 feet. One shaft has been
sunk do a depth of 200 feet, which is the water level.
The other leases of this group to the southward also appear to
have been continuous lines of reefs, to judge from the old workings.

The Warrior, G.M.L. 3048 z. This lease was worked and owned
by the Warrior Menzies G-.M. Co., N.L. (late Wallaroo Menzies
G.M. Co., N.L.), which Company also owned the Gem, G.M.L.
3235 z, and the Monte Christo Battery, on G.M.L. 3398 z.
There are three lines of lode upon this property, called respec-
tively the main lode and the eastern and western.
The main lode was first opened upon by an underlay shaft 115-
feet deep, from the bottom of which a level was driven 280 feet
south, the lode being about four feet in thickness. [751, 755, 6371.]
A main vertical shaft was sunk about 200 feet to the westward
of the underlay shaft to a depth of 200 feet without cutting water.
At 100 feet from the surface a crosscut was driven east 130 feet,
which cut the level 100 feet south of the underlay shaft. Prom
this level a winze was put down 60 feet at a point 50 feet south of
the crosscut.
At the 200 feet level a crosscut has been driven 75 feet east,,
which cut the lode, the latter being driven on for a distance of 70
feet south. A winze was sunk from this level at a point 10 feet
south of the crosscut to a depth of 30 feet, the stone being about
four feet six inches thick.
On the western lode there are three shafts—a vertical 110 feet,
one underlay 80 feet, and one 115 feet with 272 feet of drives. Most
of the work has been confined to the upper levels, whete the lode was
from two feet to two feet six inches in thickness, but a little has
been done at 110 feet, where it is three feet six inches thick.
On the eastern reef an underlay shaft has been sunk 75 feet
and a level driven 90 feet, in which the stone is three feet in thick-
ness. Another shaft has been sunk on the line of this lode to cut
it at 129 feet, but it is only down 90 feet at present.
A considerable amount of sloping has been done from the
various levels, whilst the quantity of stone raised and crushed is
given in the following table: —

G.M.L. 5140 z ; and Lucky Prop, G.M.L. 5127 z, were small leases
situated to the south of the Warrior, upon which a little work was
done.
The Lady Harriet Leases, G.M.Ls. 4972 z and 5003 z
area was owned by the Menzies Pioneers, Ltd., which Company
held it until 1898, since which time it has been owned locally.
.At one time there appears to have been a considerable amount
of dryblowing carried on upon this lease, whilst to the westward a
large number of shafts have been sunk, apparently upon an alluvial
lead, but no record appears to exist with regard to the quantity of
gold obtained.
The original Company did a very considerable amount of
shaft-sinking, driving, and crosscutting on this property upon a
line of lode which strikes about 35 degrees west of north, and
dipping to the southward at varying angles, though usually steep.
The ore occurred in pipes or shoots, and is pretty well worked out
in the upper levels.
The deepest shaft is 200 feet, and in this salt water was struck
at a depth of 160 feet (the water level is now 188 feet).
Recently the Lady Shenton Gold Mines, Ltd., took an option
on this property when, according to the manager’s report, a large
quantity of sinking, driving, and crosscutting was done below the
existing workings. In summing up the situation, Mr. Falconer, the
manager, says : —“ Payable stone had been crushed, and was then
showing in four different shoots. The shoot at No. 1 shaft has

of 229 feet. The shoot in the No. 2 shaft has been proved to have
a total length of 110 feet at the 40 feet level, and 26 feet at the
100 feet level, and an average value of lOdwts. The shoot in No.
3 shaft has not been completely explored, but, judging from the
work already done, is very probably only a short pipe. The shoot
in No. 4 shaft has been proved at the 187 feet level to have a
length of 20 feet, a width of five feet, and an average value of
30dwts,” *
Even at the moderate depth of 187 feet, where most of this
work was carried out, the country was so hard as to necessitate the
use of rock drills. It will be seen from the above that the lodes
here are of a similar character to those further north, i.e., rich
pipes of ore which decrease in size and die out as they approach the
hard country.
At the south-east end of this line of reef, a cross reef from the
outcrop of which the dryblowing patch starts ; this latter has been
worked both in this lease and in that adjoining, called the Olivia,
from which it is named. The reef strikes in a north-easterly
direction, and dips to the north-west; its junction with the
Harriet Reef in all probability feed the alluvial patch.

To the south of the Lady Harriet there are several small
properties upon which a little work has been done, which have
yielded the following returns :
The Maori Chief, G.M.L. 4987 z ; the Sefton, G.M.L. 5080 z, or
Double Event, G.M.L. 5136 z ; and the Eureka, G.M.L. 5078 z, are
situated upon the eastern side of the Eailway Line to the eastward
of the Golden Age, G.M.L. 2830 z.
Little has been done on these, with the exception of the Maori
Chief, G.M.L. 4987 z, the workings on which consist of a main shaft
96 feet deep, from which a crosscut has been driven at the 70 feet
level 33 feet east to a level which is 110 feet long, which is also
connected with the surface by a vertical and an underlay shaft.
The ore-shoot, which dips south, and is about 18 inches wdde
has been driven upon for 65 feet in the southern portion of this
level; it has been worked up to the surface and is now being
followed down by the means of winzes.

The Menzies Lady Mary, G.M.L. 3121 z, lies a few chains to the
eastward of the last, and from it 14 tons of stone were crushed in
1897, which yielded only L 22 ounces of gold. The balance of the
stone, which is of a ferruginous character, is still at grass. [792, 793,
798.]
Miscellaneous Leases.
Upon the western side of the Railway Line, and running
towards it and eventually crossing it, is a line of scattered leases
upon which a considerable amount of development work was done
in places by Companies during the boom time, but since their aban-
donment they have been worked by prospectors in a desultory manner.
This line starts at the northern end with the Olive Branch,
G.M.L. 5112 z, which is situated upon the side of an immense barren
quartz blow, forming a portion of the dividing ridge between the
northern and south-western watershed. South of this lie the two
leases, both named the Lincoln, G.M.Ls. 5134 z, 5181 z ; then the
Lady Sarah, G.M.L. Soo9z, afterwards called the Lady Fanny,
G.M.L. 5179 z; then the Queenslander, G.M.L. 5126 z; and Two
Walters, G.M.L. 5207 z.
Next, upon a steep laterite hill to the east of the Lady Harriet,
G.M’.L. 4972 z, are the old leases formerly known as the Monte
Christo, G.M.L. 8398 z; and Gem, G.M.L. 3235 z, which were
owned by the Warrior Menzies Company (late Wallaroo). This
Company did a considerable amount of work upon them, but,
apparently, did not succeed in discovering a payable lode. A battery
was, however, erected on the ground, and a water supply obtained by
sinking, the stone crushed coming from the Warrior, G.M.L. 3048 z.
These leases have since been held as the Sailor, G.M.L. 5109 z;
Bristol, G.M.L. 5116 z; Busy Bee, G.M.L. 5105 z; and Adelaide,
G.M.L. 5128 z; but have, apparently, never yielded rich stone. On

The Craig-y-nos, G.M.L. 5250, is situated upon the eastern
side of the Railway Line and north of the township of Woolgar; it
has repeatedly changed hands, but in no instance has it been held
for long.
A considerable amount of developmental work was done upon
it by the W.A. Venture Corporation, who held it in 1897, and who
sank two shafts —one 100 feet, and one 150 feet —with 500 feet of
drives. Owing to the fact that it has so often changed hands, no
systematic work has been carried out, and in consequence no
'opinion as to the character of the lode can be formed.
The Menzies G-ift, Q-.M.L. 303Gz, and The Gift, G.M.L.
4916 z, which adjoins it, are situated a little south of Woolgar, and
mining was evidently started here on the strength of their position
at the head of an alluvial run which extended from them to a little
beyond the Telegraph line in a westerly direction. Of the latter
there are no records nor returns, whilst the reefs worked proved of
too low a grade to be payable. From the former of these 50'00
tons of stone were crushed, which yielded 12'740z5. of gold, and
from the latter IO'OO tons, which yielded s'37ozs. of gold.
The Barunga Brave, G.M.L. 4691 z, is situated about
miles south. It has not been worked since 1898, up to which
date 23 tons of stone were crushed, which yielded 19'720z5. of
gold [1185,1189],
The Black Horse, G.M.L. 5106 z, and Storm King, G.M.L.
5176 z, are situated upon a low ridge about one mile to the east-
ward of Woolgar. A small patch of alluvium was worked in a
little gully crossing the former, which terminated at a small quartz
vein which is now being worked.

The Black Jack, G.M.L. 4879 z, is situated to the southward
of the last, being a portion of what was originally the Lady Main,
and upon it four shafts have been sunk, the deepest being 187 feet,
in which the water level is 170 feet from the surface. The reef
varied from eight inches to three feet in width with six to eight feet
of|formation. The course of the shoot, which was 100 feet wide, is a
little west of north with a southerly dip, but it dies out below T the
130-feet level. The vein is of the lenticular type, and decreases in
size and value with depth.
The Lone Hand, G-.M.L. 5230 z, lies a little west of the latter,
and from it 37 tons of stone yielded 34'47 ounces of gold.
The Menzies Consolidated Gold Mine, Ltd. — This Com-
pany own a number of leases situated upon the western side of the
railway line close to the township of Woolgar.
The main workings are situated upon the Princess May South,
G.M.L. 4935 z, but extend northward into the Princess May, G.M.L.
4934 z. The line of reef, however, has been traced in a north-
west direction for over 1,000 feet into the Princess Eva, G.M.L.
931 z, where another series of old workings are located. On the


Princess May South, a main shaft has been sunk to a depth of 425
feet, which cuts thereof between the No. 1 and No. 2 levels, below
which crosscuts connect it with the various levels, the No. 5 level at
the bottom being 170 feet distant. Owing to the distance from the
lode being so great, the shaft was not continued, but a main
haulage winze carried down from the No. 5 at a point about 100
feet further south, by means of which the mine was worked to the
No. 9 or 688-feet level, but since the ore-shoot had dipped to the
southward of this, another winze has been sunk still further south
from the bottom level, which has now reached a vertical depth
below the surface of over 800 feet; this is therefore considerably
ithe deepest mine inMenzies. (Plate VI.)
The ore in this mine has proved in the nine levels to average
about 400 feet in horizontal length with a dip of about 36 degrees
south upon the plane of the lode, which dips 57 degrees south-west,
the total length of the proved ore-shoot from the surface to the
bottom of the mine being over 1,600 feet, whilst the thickness is so
variable that it is impossible to state it but it must average three
feet.
The lode is clearly of the true fissure type having an extremely
well-defined and striated footwall, whilst the hanging wall is more
or less broken by feeders. In the levels above No. 6 a parallel lode
has been worked which had a strike more to the westward, this,
however, took a turn between Nos. 5 and 6 more to the northward
than the main ore body with which it would appear to junction
further north. The main ore-shoot in this mine appears if any-
thing to gain in width and definition with depth, whilst in the
north drive at the No. 9 level, the vein was found to continue and
carry gold for a distance of over 800 feet, it being poor near the
winze but improves towards the end. This may be another shoot
or the continuation of one that was prospected at the surface
farther north.
At the bottom of the winze the lode is highly mineralised,
carrying large quantities of Pyrrhotite (magnetic pyrites) [6314]
whilst the gold value still keeps up, the vein being over six feet in
thickness and as well defined as at any part of the mine.
In the northern workings upon the Princess Eva a main shaft
has been sunk and the lode worked to a depth of over 200 feet, but
owing to very considerable faulting these workings were abandoned
and the shaft is now used as a water shaft.
Water containing 2’B per cent, of solid matter was cut at a
depth of 130 feet, which yielded originally 30,000 gallons per diem
this, however, has considerably diminished whilst after passing
through the zone of saturation, the formation is practically dry.

The Q-oodenotjgh, Gr.M.L. 4855 z, is situated about three
miles in an east-north-east direction from Menzies, and lies at the
extreme north of the Kensington Group; it has recently been
acquired by the Queensland Menzies Q-.M. Co., N.L.
A line of lode can be traced at the surface in an east and west
direction for a distance of about 600 feet lying parallel to an out-
crop of sericite schist, which is apparently a dyke, whilst to the
south it dips into a solid diorite hill. [6337, 6340, 6364.]
Five underlay shafts, the deepest of which is 240 feet, have
been sunk upon this lode, which dips at an angle of from 25 to 30
degrees south. Levels have been driven at the 100 feet (66 feet
vertically below the surface) and 180 feet (80 feet vertical depth, or
at the water-level) upon a body of stone varying from three to six
feet in thickness. A dislocation in the lode was met with in the
100-feet level a little north of the No. 2 shaft, beyond which a
branch vein appears to have been followed. The main lode how-
ever was picked up to the northward and opened upon near the
mouth of the No. 1 shaft by means of first an opencut and then a
winze which was carried down to the 100-feet level.
In the opencut the reef is large and solid, and yielded very
good returns, but suddenly came to an end upon what is probably
a fault; but it is too near the surface to determine this point with
any degree of certainty.
This lode is very highly ferruginous in places, being literally
one mass of pyrites, whilst specimens of chloride of silver have also
been met with.

All the developments so far have been carried on in the
oxidised zone, where the rock is soft and of a yellow argillaceous
nature ; in consequence it affords little evidence as to its original
character. So far the stone crushed has been of good quality, but
the gold is of very low value.
There is a good supply of fresh water in a well a little
north of the outcrop ;-aid to have yielded 2,000 gallons per diem,
whilst the water in the mine makes at the rate of about 600 gallons.
To the eastward and southward of the G-oodenough are the
following leases, upon which little work has been done; —
Miscellaneous Leases.
On the Four o’Clock, G.M.L. 5072 z, which lies to the south-
west, a small reef with a north-east south-west course and dipping
south-east has been worked to a shallow depth for a length of five
chains, whilst on the Eesurgam, G.M.L. 5117 z, which apparently
lies upon the same line, the reef has been traced for a length of

The True Blub, G.M.L, 3822 z, now known as the Picton,
G.M.L, 4985 z, was worked from 1899 to 1901 by the W.A. Pro-
prietary Company, who in sinking a main shaft struck a supply of
1,300 gallons per diem of fresh water at a time when water was
particularly scarce in Menzies. Several shafts have been sunk upon
this property in which a large low-grade formation was cut which
strikes in a north-east and south-west direction, dipping at a low
angle to the south-east, but of this only the quartz-veins in the
upper levels have been worked.
Between the Picton and the Kensington there have been a
number of leases which have been worked upon a series of lenticular
quartz-veins which strike north-east and dip south-east. These
start with the True Blue South, G.M.L. 4923 z, which later on was
called the Lord Roberts, G.M.L. 5168 z, in which a body of stone
four feet wide was worked for a length of 200 feet and to a depth
of from 40 to 50 feet.
The Kensington Vindicator, G.M.L. 3615 z, was originally
worked as a whole by a Company, but later the northern portion
was taken up as the Alexandra, G.M.L. 4918 z, and later on as the

Butterfly, G.M.L. 4992 z. On this ground a lode has been worked
for a length of 200 feet, the quartz averaging about 12 inches down
to the 60-feet level. A shaft has been sunk to a depth of 135 feet,
which cut a supply of stock water yielding about 60 gallons per
diem.
Upon the southern portion of this, which was afterwards called
the Vindicator South, Q-.M.L. 4924 z, and later the Little Tom,
Gr.M.L. 5083 z, a small vein of stone about 8 inches wide has been
opened up to a depth of 60 feet. This vein on its southward course
gradually loses its easterly dip, turning flat with a slight southerly
dip, then tilting over to the west.
Upon the Mbnzies Kensington, Gr.M.L. 3277 z, which adjoins
the last, to judge from the large cavern-like excavation a large
lenticular body of quartz with a southerly dip was worked, the
extension of which has not been cut in any of the shafts either to
the dip or on the strike. A number of vertical shafts have been

sunk, one 125 feet (which is the water-level), and another 100 feet,
whilst an underlay has been sunk 70 feet and 400 feet of driving,
but in these no stone of any value was cut.
The True Blue, Gr.M.L. 5130 z, is situated a little to the east-
ward of the Kensington line and south of the Picton, and in it a
small vein of rich quartz has been traced for a length of 400 feet at
a depth of 40 feet from the surface.
Farther east still upon the western side of Mt. Misery are two
old leases which have covered the same ground called respectively
the Picton Valley, Gr.M.L. 4890 z, and the Lady Min, Gr.M.L.
4917 z. The reef is small but well defined, striking north-east and
dipping south-east, and can be traced into the Maranora, which
apptears to be the southern extension of it.
The workings consist of two groups of shallow underlay shafts
in which apparently some 3 or 4 inches of the hanging-wall side
has been worked to a depth of 20 feet.

The Old Hidden Treasure, G.M.L. 4750 z, is now being
worked as the Maranora, G.M.L. 4895 z, and in it a reef dipping
at an angle of 80 degrees south-east which, varying from a few
inches to seven feet in thickness, has been opened up to a depth of
140 feet by a level 300 feet in length, the course of which is 21
degrees east of north. The shaft has been continued to a depth of
198 feet, a small supply of stock water being cut at 150 feet.
The reef is enclosed in a formation carrying a little gold, the
thickness of which has not vet lieen tested.
The character of this reef cannot be determined at the only
level accessible, but it presents many indications of being of the
fissure type; this is further supported by its length of outcrop
[1053]-
To the southward of the last are a group of old leases which
have covered more or less the same ground; these consist of the
Kensington Eastek Gift, G.M.L. 6103 z, Prince Albert,
G.M.L. 4926 z, West Sea, G.M.L. 4908 z, and Moonlight, G.M.L.
5183 z. On these a small reef, from five to six inches in width,
dipping to the westward, has been opened up to a depth of 60 feet
and worked for a length of five chains.

the Brilliant, G.M.L. 5184 z, the Kensington Sunday Gift,
G.M.L. 4819 z, or Sunday Gift, G.M.L. 5010 z, and the Mbnzies
Luxemberg, G.M.L. 5043 z. The reef here strikes north and south
and dips west, being two to six feet thick in the Brilliant; on the
Sunday Gift it has been sunk on to a depth of 80 feet, and is about
12 inches in thickness, whilst in the Luxemberg the stone is small,
but it has been worked for a length of 100 feet, to a depth of 40 feet,
where the hard rock comes in. This vein at its north end is very
flat, but generally dips steeper tow-ards the south end.
The Viking, G.M.L. 5038 z, is a line further east still, and upon
it a vein of stone, which runs in pipes varying from six to 12 inches

shaft being 70 feet.
About 2| miles south of the Kensington Group are one or two
leases situated at what is known as Springfield, from the first
property taken up upon which a good supply of fresh water was
obtained.
Spbingfield, G.M.L. 4950z.—0n this lease a flat lode dipping
south has been worked for the the past five years by a number of
shallow vertical shafts and surface working. It has not proved so
far to continue of value in depth nor to extend east or west.
A vertical shaft has also been sunk to a depth of 130 feet in
which a supply of 1,500 gallons per diem of fresh water was struck.
A little north of this some old shafts on the flat indicate what
was the Blow Fly, G-.M.L. 4964 z, but this was only worked a
short time and was never surveyed. Prom this lease 5000 tons of
stone were crushed, which yielded 32 29 ounces of gold.
South of Springfield is a lease called the Emu, G.M.L. 5164 z,
upon which a small reef which dips west is being worked, but
little has been done on it as yet.
This lease was originally called the Mtktlb, G.M.L. 5082 z,
but the workings then consisted of some shallow shafts on a quartz
reef on the hill to the westward.

The Eubbajong, G.M.L. 3482 z, Fulcrum, G.M.L. 5202 z, and
Hopeful, G.M.L. 5206 z, lie about one and a half miles east of Mt.
Misery. The first mentioned was only worked for a short time in the
early days of the goldfield upon a small diorite outcrop, whilst the
latter two were two small recent holdings upon patchy barren
looking veins in the granite, near which some specks of gold had
been discovered.

Under this head an item appears annually in the returns, with
the exception of 1903, as follow ;


Section III.—Conclusion.
In order to make the occurrence of the typical Menzies lode as
clear as possible (the segregation, not the fissure veins, are here
referred to) a brief resume of their occurrence will be given.
It will have been noted from the foregoing description of the
various mines in which segregation veins were worked that the
formations downwards may be divided into three zones : —lst, the
upper, which extends down to the water level, in which oxidation has
taken place ; this zone is of variable extent even in reefs situated in
close proximity, and is not entirely governed by surface configur-
ation. 2nd, the belt of water-bearing rock or zone of saturation,
the limit of which in depth is governed by the permeable nature of
the formation, and may, as in the case of the Shenton Reef, be
entirely absent owing to local conditions, such as an impervious
laterite covering which has prevented the down flow of meteoric
waters, whilst a few chains west, in sinking the main shaft, a con-
siderable supply of water was cut which has now risen through the
connecting workings and flooded the workings which were pre-
viously dry ; and 3rd, below the zone of saturation, when the country
rock is massive and dry, being practically impervieus to the over-
laying water.
In the oxidised zone the rocks are usually soft near the surface,
being highly weathered, consisting of yellow argillaceous and
magnesian nature, passing imperceptibly into more or less weathered
serpentine and chloritic schists. In this zone numerous lines of
auriferous lodes are met with; they are of the composite order,
consisting of a series of lenticular quartz veins or pipes which
follow the rock foliation.
These veins may lie in a single line, one lens forming at or
near the terminal point of the other, or, as is more commonly the
case, overlapping one another, each following vein lying upon a
parallel line of foliation. The lode body may be composed of a
series of these parallel veins so arranged that the entire mass
assumes a more or less lenticular form, i.e., increasing in thickness
towards the centre and diminishing towards the ends along the
line of strike. Near the surface an enclosing zone of enriched
decomposed rock is not infrequently met with which is termed
“formation.”
Below the water level the lode changes considerably in character,
the ore body becoming a sulphide lode, and consists of definite
shoots and blanks; the shoots appear as a general rule to cut out
upon coming in contact with the solid country, or to penetrate it for
only a short distance.
Below the terminal point of these shoots considerable prospect-
ing has been done, but so far no vein encountered has proved of
sufficient value to be worth working.

Owing to the fact that the surface of the auriferous belt is for
the most part covered by superficial deposits, the reefs do not as a
rule outcrop, but to judge from the mode of occurrence of those
already discovered, it is probable that numerous others exist, and
when it is noted that a very large area in the very heart of the belt
has been scarcely prospected it is quite possible that even large and
rich lodes may yet be discovered.
Since the erection of the State Battery the working miners have
been enabled to profitably work many of the small but rich veins of
stone which the companies had abandoned, and the return from this
source alone is responsible for a very considerable proportion of the
annual gold production of the district; in fact, without it, since the
closing down of so many large mines, the district would have retro-
graded considerably.
The opening up of small veins in old workings has led to
further prospecting, which has in many instances been amply
rewarded by the discovery of other lines. This leads to the conclusion
that in the main Menzies belt beneath the alluvium a large series of
parallel lines of veins very probably exist, and should this prove
to be the case, although the larger lodes may be worked out, this
district may reasonably look forward to a very considerable and
prosperous future.
