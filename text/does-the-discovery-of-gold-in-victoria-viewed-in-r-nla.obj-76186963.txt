TO THE BRITISH PRESS.
The following pamphlet was published in Mel-
bourne, about October, 1852, when a number of
copies were sent to London, for the purpose of circu-
lation there. The author, however, who has recently
arrived in England, finds that the copies thus trans-
mitted have remained untouched, on the shelves of
the person to whose charge they were entrusted, and,
that consequently, the pamphlet is in this country
entirely unknown. He regrets this?not only be-
cause its contents were then, as they are still, of
deep interest to a large portion of the English com-
munity, but because it was chiefly through the me-
dium of the English Press that he had hoped to draw
public attention, both in England and Victoria, to
the subject of the pamphlet. It was foreseen by him
that the Australian newspapers would be anxious
rather to suppress, than to circulate, his ?to them?
very unpalatable opinions, the ? Diggers? being their
best customers, and the Gold Discoveries the theme
of their continued laudation. As he had anticipated,
not a single newspaper in either Victoria or New
South Wales took the slightest notice of his pam-
phlet, one consequence of which was, that when,
three months after its publication, the author em-
barked for England, it was comparatively unknown


even in Melbourne ; and it is by no means improbable
that many residing in that city will first hear of its
existence from the perusal of an English newspaper,
should the journals of this country consider it worthy
of their notice.
The pamphlet now appears as it was printed and
published in Melbourne ; the present state of Vic-
toria as affected by the Gold Discoveries being, so
far as latest advices inform us, no way different from
that described in the following pages. The main
object of their publication here, as it was in Vic-
toria, is to awaken more serious reflection upon an
event which hitherto seems to have been regarded
chiefly from a commercial point of view, even by
those who occasionally surround it with higher con-
siderations.
It is the conviction of the author that the time has
arrived, if not for discouraging, at least, for pausing ,
in the promotion of Emigration by auxiliary measures.
It goes on rapidly enough of itself, and has already
fulfilled a portion of its anticipated beneficial results
to this country in the abstraction of much of her
unemployed labour, and the increased value conse-
quently given to that which remains. But however
this may be, no one should be persuaded or assisted
to leave his native country for even a ? land of gold,?
without a full revelation to him of the moral perils
which are likely to follow from the change. If these
be of no importance, let it be at once avowed that
any risk is worth running for the chance of bettering
the condition of the pocket; but if the spiritual


state of a man?s existence he a thing to be considered
in preference to, or at all events in connection with,
his bodily one, such consideration was never more
required than among those who are, at this moment,
either contemplating Emigration to Australia in
their own persons, or are actively employed in assist-
ing and advising others to emigrate there. A few
Exeter Hall homilies upon this subject would not be
thrown away on barren ground. It has been already
said that the state of things described in the pam-
phlet at the date of its publication was, at the latest
dates from Melbourne, unaltered. On the contrary,
most of the evils deplored by the writer appear to
be on the increase. The following extracts shew
that a portion of the Colonial Press is at length
alive to the fact, though with a strange inconsistency
it ever and anon exults in the continuance of the
cause from which alone the effects, it laments over,
have proceeded.
?An observant spectator of the colony, at this
moment, cannot help asking how it is that the actual
amount of enterprise called into existence by our
gold, bears as yet no proportion to the immense
quantity produced. Nearly twenty millions sterling-
have been gathered from the mines: and what has
become of that vast sum ? Where has it been in-
vested ? Into what channels have the golden streams
been directed, in order to enrich and permanently
bless the country ?
?The consideration is not unattended by very
gloomy misgivings in the mind of a thoughtful ob-


server. For if the evidence of the benefits conferred
by our newly-acquired wealth are not remarkably
clear and satisfactory, the evils resulting from it,
both to individuals and to society, are unhappily
plain enough. The appeals we are compelled to
make so often in behalf of the destitute?the in-
tensely personal scramble for wealth which marks
the mercantile classes ?the disregard of general
interests exhibited by the whole community?the
prevalence of dissipated habits ; ?these are sufficient
proofs of the fact that one aspect of the gold-dis-
covery is darK and threatening. And the more
deeply the subject is meditated, the more certain
will it seem that the benefits will daily become less
perceptible, and the evils more obtrusive, if a spirit
of generous enterprize is not awakened throughout
the community.
? If we glance round the city for proof of the solid
results of our riches, what do we find ? Certainly, a
vast increase in many elements of national prosperity
?in population, in the business of buying and sell-
ing, in the profits of traders, in the value of property:
but on the other hand, there is a concurrent increase
in selfish habits, in social discomforts, and in actual
poverty amongst certain classes. We see few indi-
cations as yet of a desire to invest the large sums
gained by fortunate traders, in works of substantial
utility and public benefit. There is an evident de-
sire amongst that class of persons to fill their coffers
as speedily as possible, and then take themselves
elsewhere to enjoy their gains. The struggle for


money-gathering amongst them goes very much on
the principle of sauve qui ?pent. They seem to act
under the conviction of an impending crisis, which
will infallibly ruin all who are not wise enough to
escape before it falls. They are quite content that
it should come, if it will only wait till they have
departed.? ?Melbourne Argus , March 9th , 1853.
? The moral and religious aspects of the colony do
not vary from month to month. Immigration has
done nothing yet to elevate us. The female immi-
gration is strangely absorbed, and the comfort of
families does not keep pace with the quantity of
young women imported. There is some error in the
management of this matter, which deprives the
colony of any sensible advantage from the acquisition.
A few only appear to be of a class able and disposed
to live to some useful purpose. The gold has pro-
duced a deleterious effect upon the industrious
inclinations even of young females. They are not
willing to commit themselves to industry for support,
and to learn all that is requisite to make them
honourable members of society.
? The state of crime is inauspicious. Although far
better off than our neighbours, we are reaping the
fruits of the loose convictism of Van Diemen?s Land,
and of the cupidity and profligacy produced by the
speculating tendencies of the time. Outrages are
becoming somewhat alarmingly frequent, and are
accompanied with a ferocity most appalling. Yet,
were the state of education in advance, we should
entertain no fear of these syrnptons. The thing to


be deplored is, that the young are to a large extent
growing up abandoned in morals, from the utter
want of that domestic training, without which mere
school education will be nearly in vain. The state of
education is fearfully bad. Moral discipline is every-
where at fault. The result of which will be, without
speedy amendment, that the next generation will be
one of vastly augmented profligacy and crime. There
is enough in the prospect to awaken the deepest
solicitude for the future.? ?Sidney Empire, February
26th , 1853.
In quoting from the Australian press, it is perhaps
fair to observe, that the tone adopted towards it
throughout the pamphlet is no longer applicable to
the <c Melbourne Morning Herald that paper having
recently undergone an editorial change, which places
it, in point of talent and respectability, upon an
equality with many of the London journals. In con-
clusion, the following pages, after finding but small
audience and less heed among the community whose
condition called them forth, are commended to a
people and a press, to neither of whom can it be
yet justly said?
? Thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced.?

TO THE READER.
?There are times when the assertion of great principles is the best service
a man can render society. The present is a moment of bewildering excite-
ment, and also of absorbing worldliness; when the moral law is made to
bow to expediency, when its high and strict x-equirements are denied, or
dismissed as metaphysical abstractions or impracticable theories. At such
a season, to utter great principles without passion, and in the spirit of
unfeigned and universal good will, and to engrave them deeply and durably
on men?s minds, is to do more for the world than to open mines of wealth,
or to frame the most successful schemes of policy.? Such were the w'ords
of a great man, now no more, and although not spoken of this country,
they seem to be so peculiarly applicable to it, at the present time, that I
adopt them, not only as an exposition of my own sentiments in regard to
our existing condition, but of what, also, in such a case, I conceive to be my
own duty. These pages then, are published under a solemn conviction that, in
regard to the subject of which they treat, the whole community is more or less
in a state of ?bewildering excitement,? if not of ?absorbing worldliness.?
Not unforeseen is the sneer to which, in certain quarters, this avowal may
give rise, or the charge of presumption, to which it may expose the writer, in
appearing to arrogate to himself any peculiar clearness of vision amidst an
atmosphere of surrounding darkness. The sneer must be borne; Truth is
accustomed to this, as well as to hisses and groans ; and to those who have
no better answer to give to what may be read here, all that can be said is?
what has often been said before?who can refute a sneer ?? But the writer
disclaims any pretensions to the character of either a sage or a prophet; on
the contrary, he appears to himself to be only promulgating truths of so self-
evident a kind, that, but for some powerful obstacles to their perception, they
would meet with immediate and almost universal assent. These obstacles lie
in a direction where reason is seldom a welcome visitant?in the prejudices,


interests and passions of human nature. It is a defect not of the understand-
ing, but of the will, that renders the mass so blind to what were, else, as
palpable as the sun at noon day. Some few may, amidst the haze of self-
interest discern the light which that haze is fast obscuring; and perchance
ere it has utterly enshrouded them, may shake off its paralysing influences,
and awake to the prospect of more truthful and ennobling vision. But with
the multitude such self-enfranchisement is to be hoped rather than to be
expected. The recognition by them of unpalatable truths is ever tardy and
reluctant, and later and more reluctant still will it be, where those who are
accepted as their guides and advisers, do nothing to arouse them from their
unbelief. Well has it been said that ? The eyes of the multitude are not
strong enough to look upon truth, and generally, where they blink most,
there is most truth.? 1 One voice at least, shall not be silent in the attempt
to speak to them ?the words of soberness and truth,? even at the risk of
denunciation from a press which echoes their wishes, because it profits by
their gold.
No gold-digger who is able to read, and has the courage and independence
to think for himself, can misunderstand the true object of this pamphlet,
nor take offence at its contents, however he may differ from the writer?s
conclusions. It is possible certainly, that by displacement or distortion of
sentences, by taking a paragraph here and a paragraph there, without
either what precedes or follows it, to show what is the context ?the writer
may be represented as saying something totally different from his real
meaning; and that, on a basis thus falsely created, may be reared a con-
sequent superstructure of declamation and abuse. Bor this too the writer
is prepared; but surely the hour has arrived, when this community should
recognize, among other rights which are so much talked of, the right of
free discussion. This may be as much endangered, in a colony such as
ours, by the intolerance and violence of a newspaper, as by the intolerance
and violence of a mob; and if an individual, no matter who he be, cannot put
forth his own conscientious opinion upon momentous topics of the day without
having ascribed to him sinister motives, or being held up to public scorn in
terms of personal insult, ?the community, in encouraging a press which thus
deals with the free expression of honest though unpalatable sentiments, is
unwittingly enthroning amongst them, a despotism of the most insidious
and debasing kind. For as the power of the pen is great for good, so also


is it for harm; and what more infernal tyranny can it attempt to establish,
than that of mental subjugation ; and this it does attempt when, instead
of meeting sentiments opposed to its own, by the fair weapons of conti o-
versial argument, it strives to suppress their utterance altogether, by holding
up their propounders to public execration or making them the subject ot
personal revilement. Many a gifted mind has quailed beneath this abomi-
nable tyranny, even in countries which most vaunt of their liberty; and in
America we all know what a state of terror and bondage it keeps every
mind in, which is not prepared to surrender its own opinion to that of the
majority, whose voice the press professes to speak. From slavery such as
this, whether imposed by mobs or printing types, it behoves every member
of the conmunity not only to be free himself, but to see that all others are
free. If we are to continue a nation of gold seekers and gold diggers; if
we are eventually to become independent of British rule let us, at least
preserve British manliness, and British freedom, ? freedom to think, and
to say what we think, without peril or insult, when neither God's
law, nor man's is broken by the utterance. Then come what may, we
shall at all events in one respect, stand out nobly in comparison with even
the ? Model Republic ?? and, if in other matters we are fated to national
decline, it will be some consolation to feel that, whatever were our differences
social, political, or religious, we never lost sight of Christian toleration or
mutual forbearance, that, although true, perhaps it is, we might have
been better; it is still more true, that we might have been worse.
To the reader who participates in these sentiments, however much he
may differ from the writer in other respects,?to him, (and it is to be hoped
there are many such) whose pocket is not his God who can hear unwel-
come truths without slander or hatred of the ntterer, and without aspersing
or misrepresenting his meaning and his motives?the following pages, and
the vindication of them against the aspersions or misrepresentations of
others?are fearlessly confided and commended.




DOES THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD
IN VICTORIA,
VIEWED IN RELATION TO ITS MORAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTS,
AS HITHERTO DEVELOPED, DESERVE TO BE CONSIDERED
A NATIONAL BLESSING OR A NATIONAL CURSE?
It was hardly before the commencement of the present year
that the great discovery, which is exercising so irresistible
an influence on the destinies of this and the adjacent Colonies,
first began to prefigure in distinct outline, the form which it
has since so palpably and definitely assumed. Excitement,
it is true, was abroad, but to an scarcely noticeable,
compared with the intensity and universality that accompanied
the subsequent stages of its progress. The change came npon
us with startling rapidity, and overwhelming power. _ Sud-
denly before us, arose, as it were, a gigantic figure, in the
darkness of whose far stretching shadow, all but the glitter ot
its own reflection seemed obscured and forgotten, hrom the
hearth and the workshop ?the laborer?s hut and the merchant s
warehouse ?from the mart and the wharf the field ready for
the plough, and the corn ready for the sickle ?from the Hall
of Science, and the Temple of Religion?from every spot, in
short, where might have been seen in operation, the true ma-
chinery of an cnobling civilization, there was an outpouring of
human beings, whose numbers and emotion too plainly indicated
the tremendous influence of the agency which called them forth.
Never before, with a retinue so vast and devoted, did Mammon
go forth to do battle with God; nor ever perhaps, before, was
the spectacle seen on such a scale, of a Christian people not
only fighting beneath his banners and exulting in his sway,
but even venturing to hope from his Omnipotent and Ever-
lasting Foe, a blessing on his rule.


This language may, by many, be considered as exaggerated,
making even due allowance for the latitude of a metaphorical
sketch. I believe it however to be, in the main, a true picture;
and on the whole, will any unprejudiced person affirm that it
is not a faithful reflection of the effect produced by our gold
discoveries. Within the last six or eight months, will any one
deny that all classes have been more or less kept by it in a con-
stant state of excitement? With most it has well nigh formed
the sole topic of conversation or consideration; the one absorbing
theme, in comparison with which, all other matters have been
held subordinate and indifferent. The amount of ore brought
down by the Grovernment escort from Mount Alexander was both
the event and the topic of the week, and the newspapers could
find nothing so interesting or so glorious to record as the
success of the ? diggers,? and the boundless resources of the
? diggings.? Every thing was advocated as imperatively neces-
sary that could facilitate or encourage the pursuit; every thing
denounced as oppressive or foolish that appeared to throw any
impediment in its way. Labor disdained any other occupation,
whilst commerce and trade became its abettors from the sheer
force of its demands, and the corresponding magnificence of
its rewards.
In other ways too has its influence been made apparent.
Not only have public festivity and private hospitality been
shorn of their fair proportions, but we have seen public duties
neglected, and public interests disregarded ?and last, but not
least, a general falling off in those recreations of both mind
and body, without which no community can preserve either
its moral or physical health. A lecture on Chemistry in the
Mechanics? Institute was attended by an audience of eight?
an anti-transportation meeting, after an hour?s delay, ended
in an assemblage of a dozen. Benevolent asylum meetings
had to be adjourned, time after time, ?our only literary
periodical, after a few flutterings to keep on its flight, sunk
to the ground, ?out of five cricket clubs, of which our city
could boast, only one showed symptoms of vitality, ?the Town
band disappeared from its usual place of meeting; the Temper-
ance hall music meetings had to be discontinued?and, to
crown the whole, not even a birth-day ball could be got up in
honor of the Sovereign whose rule we acknowledge, and whose
name our colony bears.
These, it may be said, are trifles, but like the straw thrown
up to show which way the wind blows, they are a guide to the
real state of the public mind. They are too unambiguous


indications, that by the mass, care and concern for anything
else than the golden opportunities of the moment have been
utterly abandoned; or that at all events, other matters are only
lit to be considered, by way of parenthesis, and not as having
any necessary connection with the substantial business of life.
As it began, so it has continued. The mania is complete,
and will not abate now ?no reasonable doubt can exist about
that. It may be well therefore to inquire what it is we have
discovered, which, notwithstanding its immediate evils, seems
to be considered, if not quite the one thing needful, as an
affair, at all events, of much too practical result to the pocket,
to be voted a nuisance; still less, to be denounced as a curse.
Some have declared it to be the great panacea for all our wants,
whilst others suspecting that the pill, golden as it was, might
still be in want of a little wrappage to make it quite palatable
to the moral swallow, have introduced it to our notice, and
that of the world in general, in language worthy of Holloway
or Morrison. Thus, amongst other grandiloquent expositions,
we have had the phrases ? new Eldorado,? ? mighty Nation,?
? splendid future,? ? golden age,? ? glorious era,? &c., re-
peated ad nauseam ; but any practical common sense view of
the matter ?of the how and the why, and the when, ?all this
high-sounding verbiage is to be substantiated?is to approve
itself to be any thing more than verbiage ?is a desideratum
yet to be supplied. The tone of fervid dogmatism in which the
Australian Press has disclamed upon the subject, would be
amusing, were it not really too grave a matter for merriment,
that a power, capable, if adequately weighed, of controlling
everything else, should be so little capable of controlling itself.
If ever had arrived a time when reflection, caution and composure
were required of those who assumed to themselves the direction
of the public mind in these colonies, it was at the period of our
gold discoveries. Instead of adding to the force of the torrent
by which the mass were borne along, they should have stood
calmly watching its course, and have waited for such signs as
time only can afford, ere they ventured to pronounce it a ferti-
lizing stream, or to treat with derision those who saw in its
suddenness and violence the elements of a devastating flood.
Then again we have had it echoed as a notable saying, that we,
by our gold discoveries, had been ?precipitated into a Nation *
and the expression is significant, though not probably in the
sense intended; for it must have escaped the recollection of
him who first used it, that there is a wide distinction between
being precipitated into a nation and being elevated into one.


But although the latter expression would have been the happier,
would it have been the truer ? Does not the former, though de-
signed only to convey an idea of the suddenness of the change,
convey in fact some veritable idea of its character ? However,
not to quarrel with the expression, is not precipitancy itself a
somewhat dangerous procedure in a nation?s career? Sudden
changes in an individual?s fortune, have often been found to
turn his head, and to render other care necessary for his pro-
tection, than he has been able to afford himself. Why is a
nation, in the first heyday of similar excitement, to stand on
steadier ground? And the misfortune too, is, that if it lose
its balance, or get in any way beside itself, there is no remedy
at hand. In the case of an individual he may, on due proof,
be declared non compos, and dealt with accordingly ; but
although a nation should
?Play such fantastic tricks before High Heaven,
?As make the Angels weep,?
there is no such summary relief to be had?no process has yet
been invented by which a whole community can, even on
clearest imaginable proof of national insanity, be consigned
forthwith to a lunatic assylum. The vox populi which placed
Louis Napoleon where he now is, was declared by the wise-acres
of other nations to be vox dementium ; nevertheless, it is a
vox whose fiat has not been set aside, nor has it transpired
that any proceedings are in contemplation for testing its validity
by a commission to a congress of nations under a writ de
Lunaticis Gallicis Inquirendis.
It will have been collected from the preceding remarks that
the writer is one of those who look upon our gold discoveries
as an event rather for regret than rejoicing. In sober earnest-
ness he does, and it is not a little strange that the Newspapers
should be found predicting, in such high-flown language its
benefits and advantages, whilst in the same breath they are
daily recording the most lamentable instances of its results.
The dearness of all the necessaries of life; the scarcity of
labour for any and every purpose for which it is required in the
colony, the increase of drunkenness and crime; the flood of
felons that are hourly pouring in upon our shores; the
miseries?sickness ?and discomforts, that inclement weather,
bad roads, and want of household accommodation are fast
bringing into existence both here and at the gold fields, are
chronicled, as it would seem, without a single suspicion on the
part of those who record them, that they are the effects of a
cause they have themselves helped to its dcvclopcment,?the


fruits of a tree they have aided to take firmer root, and beneath
whose Upas like shade, they are still inviting adventurers to
assemble and repose. In some quarters, however, the golden
monster appears to be declining in the estimation he was formerly
held in,?nay, something of a quaking seems to have come over
one at least, of those who so joyously sang his first advent; as if
the startled admirer had just got sight of some uglier features
than had been anticipated; and like Frankenstein shrinking
from the monster he had created, was beginning to feel rather
alarmed at the idea of the liberties he might next take, if any
further encouraged. ? The Sydney Morning Herald ? for
instance) of the 3rd of May, on having been asked by a
correspondent its opinion of the propriety of a public holdiday
to celebrate the gold discovery in New South Wales,, thus ex-
presses itself.
?As our correspondent wishes our opinion, we at once state that we do
not think it advisable to follow out his suggestion. It will he time enough
five or six years hence, when the actual working of the gold discovery is
seen, to make the anniversary of that discovery, a national holiday. Of
its ultimate benefit to the community, that the gold will in a few years
Eeople the country, we have little doubt. But hitherto the benefits have
een confined to very few; the mass of the shopkeepers, builders, landowners,
and small capitalists, have, from increase of wages and prices, rather suffered
than benefitted by the change, although we hope that the increase in the
value of landed property and increase of business will place the balance on
the other side before long. We do not think there is any desire or intention
on the part of the employers to attend to the proposal.?
It seems however, that the holiday was attempted, but was
a failure, the ? Nation ? not being up to the proper pitch of
enthusiasm; whereupon the Herald remarks?
? The attempt to declare yesterday a public holiday was sufficiently suc-
cessful to be mischievous. Many shops were shut, and the banks having
been most incautiously and improperly closed, caused great inconvenience.
If those persons who have made fortunes by gold buying, and the mercantile
transactions arising from the discovery of gold, wanted to close their estab-
lishments and have a holiday there was no possible objection to their doing
so, but it was rather too much to endeavour to compel their less fortunate
brethren, those whose business has been checked and their profits diminished
by the same cause, to follow their example. ? Why should not our poor
clerks and shopmen, who have assisted us to make the money, participate
in the benefit, and have a holiday ? ? asked one philanthropical holiday
seeker. We can give no reason why they should not: indeed we entirely
approve of the principle proposed, and would suggest that the emyloyees
ox our worthy friend should each have a week?s holiday in turn, and if the
profits arising from the gold have been very large, a ï¿½lO note each, to
enable them to take a trip into the country will he only a kind way of show-
ing that the sentiment is something more than mere bunkum. But why,
because Mr. A. does this, should Mr. 8., who has no such motive do the


same. The'proposal that the Government offices should be closed, and
thereby a ?colonial? character be given to the holiday, was most absurd.
Have the great body of the colonists present cause of joy ? have the
farmers, the graziers, the shipowners, the builders, profitted so much by
the <>-old discovery that their servants, the public officers, should have a
holiclay. We do hope that any such attempt at dictation as was partially
successful yesterday, will in future be resisted. The Directors of the Banks
have been much to?blame for lending their sanction to such a ridiculous
proposal, and have established a precedent which they may hereafter find
most inconvenient.?
Now, this is somewliat different from what might have been
read in*the same paper on the first discovery of the Turon
treasures. Gratifying, however, is it to observe any portion
of the Australian press beginning to recover from the state of
excitement into which it was thrown; and would all who be-
long to it, take a sober and rational view of the present crisis
of affairs; and emancipating themselves from the wretched
slavery of promulgating only such opinions as are palatable to
their readers ?declare freely and fearlessly the result of their
own judgement, heedless alike of whom it may please or offend,
or what particular interests it may impede _or advance ;?the
community of this Colony could not give its newspapers_ too
staunch support, and the writer of these might in time,
hope for a diffusion of the very sentiments he is now putting
forth, through a much more influential channel than the pages
of an ephemeral pamphlet.
In answer to what I shall have to say of the ill consequences
of our gold discoveries, many will probably reply, that we
ought not to deplore the present evils, if, out of them is to
arise future good ;?and that undoubtedly what ever we may
be now, we shall, in due time, with the help of our gold
attractions, become ?a great nation.? The meaning of which
language appears to be this?that at some future period, the
then inhabitants of Victoria will find their condition consider-
ably improved by the ills which its present ones are, at this
moment, enduring. Now it is certainly possible that, in the
course of years, fruits may spring from the seeds of current
events, which as yet they have failed to yield; but it, in the
meantime, their growth is to displace all other growth; it
what is slow and doubtful in ripening is to be matured on the
grave of what was already blooming and hopeful, if, in short,
in the process by which we are to prepare for distant and un-
certain blessings, we are to sacrifice all that we previously had,
it seems to me that this reference to the future as an antidote tor
the present is a most fallacious and unsatisfactory consolation.


It must be borne in mind, that the position of Victoria was
very different from that of California when gold was first
discovered there. The comparison between that country and
New South Wales as thus drawn by the Sydney Herald is
equally applicable to Victoria. ?The former? it observes,
?had no established interests to be injuriously acted upon by
her great discovery. The latter has large amounts of property,
the fruits of more than half a century?s enterprise, upon which
her gold fields may exert a detrimental, if not a ruinous influ-
ence.? The same remark applies to Victoria, wdiereas California
was nothing, and would have remained nothing, but for the
discovery of her gold fields. But Victoria had something more
to preserve than simply her pastoral interests, all important
as they were; she could boast also a moral and thoroughly
British population, which was every day expanding and strength-
ening, and giving promise of similitude in their institutions
manners, and tastes, to those of our glorious mother-country.
Matchless, magnificent country!?how often has risen upon
my heart, and oftener still in these sadly contrasting times,
the memory of Gowper's well known line,
?England, with all thy faults I love thee still.?
Oh?who that could remain in such a land would quit it, and
who, having quitted it could, happily dwell in any other which
did not, in some degree, resemble that? But why am I thus
proud of my country ? because her land is foremost among the
nations in glory, wealth, and power ? No ?but because in
her is developed, more than in any other country, the growth
of a true Christian civilization. Amid all the jarring elements
of differing creeds, no where does religion so practically make
its way, or exercise a more visible influence on every rank of
society. Nowhere are the triumphs of mental power so con-
spicuous, nor is knowledge any where diffused through such
numerous channels, or in such abundant streams. In science,
art, and letters, she stands preeminent, and altogether offers
an example to her Colonial offspring, which (sneer at some of
the parent?s failings as they may) they will do well to follow,
assured as they may be, that until they have began to do so,
and made some visible progress therein, they will have earned
but small claim to the appellation of ? Great.? We may do
without a Chatham, or a Brougham, ?a Milton or a Shakes-
peare, ?an Arkwright, or a Watt, ?a Bulwer or a Dickens, ?
a Reynolds or a Chantry,?a Chalmers or a Wesley?but if
there be no outward and visible sign among us, ?of a veneration


and love for the things of which these men?s lives and works
are the exponents, ?if we have no better specimen of Hero-
worship to exhibit than of the Hudson-testimonial sort ?we
may come to the conclusion that, however rapidly we may be
moving along, it is notin an upward direction, ?that in short,
so far from being elevated, we are indeed, in every sense ot
the word, being 11 precipitated into a nation.?
And how shall a love for these things be felt, or a taste for
them be cultivated, situated as we now are? The want of
labour alone is fast nipping every bud of promise which any of
them may have given forth, even if there were no moral causes
at work to hinder their developemcnt. And when will any
reaction take place? What signs have we yet had of any
change from which we may gather hope of coming relief? none
that I can see, certainly at least that indicate any immediate
prospect of amelioration. And can we afford to wait ?why
even the physical wants of the colony arc at this moment so
instant and pressing, that a single hour?s delay ought if possible,
to be avoided in remedying them?What! a nation without a
metropolis which is neither drained, lighted, nor watered?
where thousands of its community cannot find the shelter of a
roof?out upon such idle boasting! Why, even as I now write
are fast germinating into growth around and beneath us, the
seeds of a pestilence which will, at no distant day, give fearful
evidence of the strength it is now silently, but surely acquiring.
Yet with all our treasures they seem unequal to the construction
of any barriers against this formidable foe; methinks if an
army of barbarians were threatening us with destruction or
slavery unless we would hand over to them so many pounds
weight of gold, we should make pretty short work of securing
our safety, by giving the required price of it; I fancy that
would, at all events, be considered a national affair. Hut is
there no way of being struck down in the midst of peace and
plenty except by the sword? and if we have no external foe to
fear, arc we to shut our eyes to the approach of a still more
deadly internal one? Is it not forsooth, a matter of national
concern, that in our metropolis, now literally crammed with
inhabitants, the foundations of fever and plague are being
every day, nay, every hour, deeper and deeper laid. You hear
me, reader, with doubt perhaps, because the atmosphere takes
no perceptible shape in its movements and gives no visible blow
when it strikes: but I cannot help thinking that if we could
see the cause, as clearly as we do the effect, of its fatal influ-
ence, we should start up in a body, as if some wild beast were


raging about our streets, and say?something must be done to
put down this?and, probably, in such occularly demonstrable
case, something would be done.
Some, perhaps, will exclaim hereat ?this is all very true,
but why does not government bestir itself in the matter.?
This is now a days a favorite cry?? what is the government
about ?? is the invariable finale to every print-recorded penny-
a-line catastrophe, whether the subject matter be a stolen horse,
or a swollen creek, a bad road or a broken bridge, a fever or
a flood, a fall in gold, or a rise in flour, ?no matter what, ?
however trivial or serious, whether accidental, or unavoidable,
?Government is to blame.?
Now, I am no apologist for government, nor does it concern
me to enquire what faults of omission or commission may bo
laid to its charge: but it does concern us all to see that the
evils from which we are suffering and arc likely to suffer, are
traced to their right source: for I apprehend it to be
something more than an error to attribute blame where
no blame is due, and a decidedly futile proceeding to be seek-
ing for a remedy,where no remedy is to bo found. One thing
is clear; government neither discovered the gold fields nor in-
vited a population to assemble there; and for the increase of
crime, the high price of labour and the comparative stoppage
of all public works that have followed in consequence of it, is
about as much responsible as it would bo for the disturbance
of the soil by the shock of an earthquake, or the fall of a
thunderbolt.
The evils which, directly and indirectly, have arisen from
the gold discoveries could have received no check at the hands
of government, except by what would have been termed an
act of despotism, by those who arc loudest in denunciation of
its impotency. Had government been in a position to have
prohibited the digging of gold altogether, or to have subjected
it to such conditions as would have required capital to embark
in the pursuit, it would have struck a very effectual blow at
the root of much from which we are suffering, and shall still
suffer. Nor, in the latter case, could it have been said that
the poor man had been shut out from sharing in the benefits
of the privileges granted to the rich; for his labours would
still be needed by the capitalist, and to be secured, would have
to be highly paid. The vocation, thus restrained, would have
assumed, in some degree, the character of a commercial and
trading pursuit, and would not have overwhelmed and over-
ridden all other colonial interests, by the entire absorption of
the labour required for their furtherance and support.


But it is time to portray some of those social and moral evils
which are the fruit of our gold discoveries, and which are
independent of any injurious consequences that may flow from
their effect on our national prosperity. The reader has, perhaps,
already said within himself, ? why all this clamour against
digging for gold ? is it not what all are toiling for from morning
till night; why should it be so demoralising to acquire directly,?
what every body is daily doing his best to acquire indirectly ?
The question is plausible, but it may be answered. In the
first place it is not the acquisition of gold, either directly or
indirectly, which is the subject of my remarks, but the acqui-
sition of gold under the circumstances, and in the manner in
which its acquisition has become possible. I grant that the
employment is one of toil, but it is toil deprived of all those
associations which give to labour its true worth. It is labour
cut off and isolated from its just relations to the body politic
and social, of which the labourer forms a part. It is labour,
but in (as it were) a deserter?s guise?a runaway from the
legitimate highway of industry, in the hope of outflying it on
the wings of fortune. It has no connexion with anything that
deserves to be called trade or commerce, but, for the time, is
concentrated entirely upon itself, and its own distinctive ends.
The result of it is at the mercy of chance, and if it fail of its
object, there is benefit to nobody, for the workman, though
worthy of his hire, being his own employer, must go unpaid.
It stimulates no feelings but those which were better repressed,
and it subdues those which it would be desirable to awaken and
keep alive. The pursuit is carried on in a constant state of
excitement, whether failure or success attends the workman?s
efforts, and carried on under the influence of one solitary
overwhelming idea ?the acquisition of Gold. His neighbour s
success only vexes him if he be not successful also; his own
good fortune he is half afraid to communicate lest envy rather
than sympathy, should be the result of his confidence. Riches,
and not subsistence, are the stake he has come to play for;
and to make, in a few days, or at most a few weeks, what will
maintain him for years, is not only his express object, but his
ardent hope. Wages which would have amply sufficed for his
maintenance, and that of his family, he rejects with disdain ;
and toils on in the midst of discomforts and hardships which, if
imposed as the penalty of crime, would have been accounted
a cruel punishment, in the hope that by perseverance he shall
soon obtain what will render it unnecessary for him to work
any more. Yes, he will work no more ; that idea rises to his
thoughts, till he begins to look on work itself as an evil, or


degradation; and to fancy that, by securing himself against
the obligation of resorting to it, he will become not only a
happier, but a more independent and respectable man. Even
his very deportment changes under the influence of these ideas,
as if he imagined independence in manners were indispensable
to the due enjoyment of independence in pocket. ? Jack?s as
good as his master? does not exactly come from his lips, but
his countenance seems to express as much: and many such a
countenance may be seen in the streets of Melbourne, as the
wearer elbows his way along in all the pride and self elation of
his newly acquired gold. Not that the truth may not be that
Jack is as good as, and perhaps better than his master; but
if he is, it must be from the possession of other qualifications
than a full purse and a swaggering gait. Could wealth give
manners and intelligence, the thousands now becoming rich
wmuld be strengthening, instead of sapping, the foundations
of established society; and none would be found foolish enough
to sigh over their success, or gainsay the means by which they
had acquired it.
But to revert to the labor of the gold fields ?is it not of a
kind which both, in its circumstances and influences, differs
essentially from that upon which a civilized population is
ordinarily employed, and which, as part of a system useful
both to the nation and the individual, tends rather to raise,
than to depress, the latter in the social and moral scale? In
directing his energies to that regular and steady industry which
is required in the service of agriculture, trade, and commerce,
the labourer establishes a tie between himself and his employers
which adds another link to the great social bond that unites
the whole community. He feels, too, that he is advancing
interests which could not, without his aid, exist, and that,
however humble, there is a place in the order of affairs which
it is his privilege to be able to fill up. Moreover, in such a
country as this, he is assured that there is no risk of his labor
suffering from over competition, or under payment; and he
works therefore patiently and calmly, surrounded by com-
panions whom he envies not, and in the midst of those do-
mestic and social environments, for the sake of which he toils,
and the influence of which can hardly sometimes fail to remind
him that money is not the summum honum of existence.
But the absence of all domestic comforts, and of all regard
to the ordinary forms and conventionalities of social life; the
exposure to contact with bad company and bad weather?all
the external evils, in short, which menace the resident gold


digger, fall far below, and are not to be named in comparison
with, the internal ?those which, without affecting his body,
creep gradually over his mind, and eat imperceptibly into his
soul. When he sees himself surrounded by men who, from
morn to night, have apparently nothing at heart on which
they care to talk, think, or toil, excepting gold, he must be
strongly on his guard indeed, if he be not himself drawn into
the same oblivion of every thing better and brighter. Even in
the metropolis of Victoria, or indeed in any part of the colony,
the means are few enough by which the mind can be directed
into purer streams of thought than carry it along in the every
day pursuit of money-getting; but at the diggings there
are no sources whatever where a mind, which feels itself
to he a mind?can receive that nourishment which it so much
needs, and without which?prosper the body and purse as they
may ?it will assuredly sink into degradation and decay.
Eor my own part, the bare consideration of the object for
which such a mass of human beings have met to endure so
many dangers and privations, accounting them not only fitting
but meritorious to be endured, is, for the moment, almost
enough to shake my faith in the existence of man s spiritual
supremacy over his lower faculties. To find what been
denounced as ?the root of all evil? pursued from morning to
night with a keenness, eagerness, intensity, and entirety of
purpose, such as no other pursuit is ever seen to command ?
can suggest no other idea than that it is really regarded as the
root of all good. And when ?canting hypocrite,? or ?high-
flown enthusiast,? are the phrases applied to him who ventures
to suggest that it might be well for the gold-seeker himself, as
well as the interests of the colony at large, if difficulties, rather
than facilities, were put in his way; and lamentations are heard
that Government does not devise means for enabling people to
get there easier and faster than they can go now; it is difficult
to avoid the conclusion that whatever else of the world
Christianity may have overcome, the ? root of all evil ? yet
remains its victorious foe.
I am perfectly alive to the facility with which truth of any
kind may be placed in a ridiculous light, and to the possibility
of some such questions as the following being put by some
exasperated gold-digger, ?Pray, are we to erect mansions, in
order to enable us to handle a spade with security to our morals ?
are we to be voted unmannerly for allowing our beards to follow
the course of nature ? or for arranging our costume without
the assistance of a cheval glass ? Are we to shut our ears,


when other people talk, and to say ? no! ? to a glass of rum,
or a cigar, lest they should undermine the foundations of our
? gentility ?? Now it were easy, but hardly profitable, to ? answer
a tool according to his folly? and the supposed interrogator,
therefore, shall be simply replied to by propounding the
following interrogatory in return; ?Pray are you obliged to go
to the diggings at all; is it your own choice that you submit to
what you must there see, hear, and endure; is it necessity that
has forced you to go there for a living, or have you the means
of procuring a maintenance in any other way ?? If the
answer can, with truth, be given; that the individual is so
circumstanced as to justify him in trying his fortune at the
gold fields, no one can blame him for incurring the risk of a
position which his necessities, or sense of duty, will not allow
him to escape. But it is impossible not to feel that the position,
nevertheless, is one of considerable trial and danger, and equally
the same in its tendencies and possible consequences, as if it
had been voluntarily chosen. In reading accounts of the
misery of the poor of Great Britain and Ireland, we find
much of it to arise from the crowded and uncomfortable state
of their dwellings; and experience has shown that this is one
of the chief causes both of their physical and moral deterioration.
Are these, let it be asked, then, less evils where they exist,
merely because gold can be dug out of the earth, instead of
potatoes. lam no alarmist, and am not presumptuous enough,
to be prophetic, but if the reports of newspaper correspondents
resident on the spot are to be relied on, ?disease ?misery?
and even starvation too ?is in store for the unfortunate diggers,
who are now congregated at Mount Alexander. But, however
this may be, no one can deny that the mode of life at the
diggings, is by far too great a contrast to that in the settled
localities of civilized society, not to render a residence there,
for any period of time, a hazardous experiment, at the best.
Of the effects of success upon the majority of the diggers,
as displayed in their bearing and dissipation, on their return to
the town, a few words have been already said. The picture,
perhaps, may have been thought overcharged; but lest any
should doubt its general accuracy, here is confirmation from a
newspaper, that, whatever may be its opinion now, spoke out
four months ago with a sincerity that showed its courage, if
it did not increase its sale. Thus on the 28th of May last,
did the ?Melbourne Morning Herald ,? expatiate on a
state of things characterised by itself as ? The Saturnalian
AEra.?


?Aeoording to tho philosophy of Bacon, ?Knowledge is power: but,
agreeably with the opinion of Hobbes, wealth commands the supremacy.
Every day, since the developement of our gold fields, experience has enabled
the observer to decide between the two aphorisms. _ _ .
When converted to reasonable purposes, or applied to objects of private
amelioration, or public weal, then wealth becomes a powerful, nay, a
necessary material for good. But, if its possession becomes available to
an indiscriminate mass of adventurers, devoid of ordinary judgment, and
destitute of self control, wealth may become a most dangerous weapon for
evil. The eligible opportunities for amassing large fortunes in the present
day have tended to create a revolution in the public mind; for, we now find
the ordinary labourer, and mechanic, instead ot ? demanding a fair day s
wages for a fair day's work,? presuming to arrogate a dictatorial
consequence.
However humiliating or deplorable such insignificant pomposity may
appear in the eyes of intelligent parties, is immaterial to the holder ot gold,
who, congratulates himself that the best friend a man can have, the
friend which he has in his pocket; and, no matter what his qualifications,
may be, he will, generally, command respect, or, at least, consideration
from the class of his associates. We do not think that a more important
subject could be discussed than the one involved in this brief article,
because, while admitting the undue and dangerous influence insepaiabia
From the acquisition of wealth, we cannot but acknowledge that the lower
orders have a natural birthright, in common with mankind in general, to
profit by the developement of our mineral resources as much as any member
of the community. Were, however, an apt illustration required to strengthen
the ground of our argument, we might compare the illiterate but successful
gold-digger to that eccentric personage, ? Tittlebat Titmouse,? so graphi-
cally pourtrayed in ?Ten Thousand a-vear.? This young gentleman,
rescued at an early age from the tedium vitae of an errand Mercury, was,
by some adventitious circumstances, placed in the possession and enjoyment
of ten thousand pounds per annum. This lucky stroke ot unexpected fortune
made him assume a most pompous and affronting bearing: until the
advent of that vicissitude which transferred the fortune to a Mr. Aubrey,
the rightful inheritor at law. Such a sudden reverse of his condition,
deranged his intellect; and the unfortunate youth was entrusted to the care
of a keeper within the walls of a lunatic benevolent assylum. hie l ' o , hï¿½
still enjoyed the mad reveries of his departed greatness; and beguiled his
leisure moments by smoking straws for mild havannahs, and quailing toast
water for diluted cognac!
That ? wealth is power? to an indefinite extent will always bo the case
so long as there is a circulating medium of capital among society. W here
money is demanded for purposes of traffic, it will always be valuable;
and the man who possesses the most of it, will have the means ot indulgence
more extensively within his reach; but, if ? money is not wealth,? accord-
ing to the axiom of Adam Smith, so under extraordinary circumstances, it
may be made subservient to evil intentions.
How to remedy this serious inconvenience and yet not outrage the feelings
of the lower orders by any inordinate restriction, is a difficulty with which
the faculties of statesmen might wrestle and yet fail in supplying the
antidote. The government cannot close the gold fields to private enterprise,
neither by shutting them up altogether, nor imposing a heavy tax for-
working them. The first alternative could not be gamed without a powerful
military or police force being maintained upon the spot; and as to the
seeond, it would be nugatory, for those who have the means of paying tor


t. license would assist those who have it not, merely for the sake of exaap*-
rating the authorities or defeating their purpose.
But as we have witnessed the power for evil which a plebeian, when monied,
may command, and as we know from ordinary experience that the possession
of wealth inspires the holder thereof with an arrogant degree of undue
independence, it is absolutely necessary to enforce some stringent regula-
tions for meeting the present difficulty, and preventing an imminent
danger. Unfortunately it is useless to endeavour to reason with unintelligent
uneducated, obstinate men, who feel themselves possessed with means to
obtain almost every desire, and even to procure the agency of learned defence
against the commission of crime. The evil influence of ready money how-
ever dishonestly obtained, invests the holder with a most dangerous power
to defeat the ends of justice and to screen himself from guilt. The recent
trial of the four prisoners for the Nelson robbery will be a precedent for
proving how weak are moral considerations when arrayed against pecuniary
bribes; and we infer from this trial the probability of much future trouble
to the government and much danger to the interests of society, from the
influence which money commands over the minds of ordinary men.
We see, also, the demoralizing effects of the possession of wealth, in in-
troducing the unprincipled holder to every excess of dissipation. The
? monied libertine? can gratify his passions, and ridicule morality, while
he defies the laws, when he knows he possesses ample means for feeing
competent counsel for defending him. The midnight ruffian may travel
the streets, and assault the peaceably disposed inhabitants with non-
chalance and impunity, congratulating himself that the consequences of
conviction involve merely a fine, to himself only nominal in amount, and
scarcely proportionate to the debased indulgence of his reckless conduct.
While drawing the attention of the authorities to an existing, an increas-
ing and a threatening evil, ? an evil which increases in magnitude and
operation every successive day, we will endeavour to suggest some scheme
in a future number for alleviating its serious consequences, if we cannot
provide an antidote for their prevention.?
Now if this (the italics are placed by the extractor) does not
however reluctantly, amount to a confession that the lower or
working classes, or (if that term be unsavoury in these go-a-
head days) the class to which the writer assigns ? the minds
of ordinary men??if I say, the above article be not a confession
that this, it must be admitted, very numerous class has been
most injuriously affected by the ? fatal facilities? of acquiring
money at the gold fields, and that, in consequence, very great
evils have been inflicted on the colony ; ?I confess myself
unable to interpret the meaning of ordinary language. Gloomy
however, as was this sketch of the ? Saturnalian xEra? it did not
conclude without offering some hope of a remedy; for although
this was allowed to be ? a difficulty with ichich the faculties
of statesmen might wrestle and yet fail in supplying the
antidote ;? it was a difficulty with which, perchance a news-
paper editor might successfully grapple. The promise to
attempt the task was at all events made; the performance is
yet to be achieved.


The state of things for which a remedy was it seems not to
be found, even in the brain of a newspaper editor, was described
by him as having taken place in May last; but here is a corres-
pondent of the ? Sydney Morning Herald? writing on the
subject, in August, some four months later, much in the same
strain. The gentleman writes from Melbourne, and has
recorded, in what he calls ? Jottings from the Note Book of a
Gold Seeker,? the following result of his observations as to
the effects of our gold discoveries upon what he terms ?the
masses.? Let him be heard, and if he is to be believed, is it
too much to say that for such a state of things? prevention
would have been better than cure.
?The moral condition of the population is (I mean of the masses)
deplorably low. Proceed where you will, oaths, execrations, and obscenity
grate upon your ear. Every public-house ?and their name is legion?from
early morning till evening (no respectable people are out after nightfall) re-
sounds with brawl and indecency. Intoxication seems to have run riot among
the lower orders, and so far from that gold, which they all seem to have in
profusion, being attended with a blessing, I verily believe that to many it
will be a bitter curse.?
To pass now from the shadows of the 1 Saturnalian sera? to
the contemplation of the rising generation under the lights of
this golden age. None will affirm that the youth of this
colony were growing up amid influences of too elevating a
character, even prior to our gold discoveries. But .these have
spread around them an atmosphere peculiarly dangerous. The
love of money is not a passion so hard to be acquired that it
need be instilled into the juvenile mind by precept or example;
and yet by both, surely, was it never more recommended than
it is, at this moment, to the rising generation of Australia.
When children hear from their parents of scarcely any other
theme than gold; when they perceive how much of happiness
and gratification is apparently made to depend upon its possession,
and when they themselves are, prematurely, taken from their
home or their school, to assist and share in its acquisition; can
it be matter of surprise that they should attribute to it a power
and a worth with which nothing else, in the world, deserves to
be put in competition ? Idle is it to talk of religious influence
operating upon them amid a scene so exciting as that to which
they must be introduced, on their removal to the gold fields.
The adult may meet safely the shock; but as for the young;
their plastic minds will so insensibly be moulded after the
model of what is before them, that they can scarcely fail to
imbibe contamination. It will be said perhaps, that go where
they will, they cannot avoid occasionally seeing and hearing


what they see and hear at the diggings; possibly, but is that
any reason why the exposure should not be spared them when
it can ? Is an apprenticeship to bad company and coarse
language desirable for a young man, because, forsooth, at some
time or other, he may have to fight his way in life throug i
both ? Is what is called manliness of so much more importance
to juvenile developement than godliness, that the idea of the
latter is to be scouted as ridiculous if it interfere with the
process of training him for the former ?
And now it may be asked, ?what is it so very shocking,
after all, which is to be witnessed at the gold fields; why this
cant about morals and manners; ?are they in any greater
degree of danger than they would be in the streets of tac
metropolis, and is our youth, forsooth, to be removed from tfAm,
lest they should be contaminated by walking therein ? Ihe
question shall be answered by the correspondent of a paper
peculiarly identified with the ?Digging interest,? if such a
term may be used ?an eye witness of what he himself describes.
After previously descanting on the demoralizing influence of
the convict population, collected at Mount the
writer opens his commuuication with this observation, ?no
? one can for a moment doubt the poisonous influence that this
? close contact with vice and immorality must have upon our
11 future society.? He then contemplates, as a natural con-
sequence from the presence of this class, a frightful increase of
crime, and a perpetration of it, from the force of example and
temptation, by the hitherto undepraved portion of our Lush
peasantry. Deploring this, he proceeds in the following strain.
? Neither is there any firm, any certain, or continuous check upon the
spread of this subtle crime-begetting- poison. No resident minister ot the
gospel is there to dissipate those noxious vapours by the bright agnt oi
Divine truth; to bring back men?s thoughts to what they have been, and to
point out what they are likely to become through the ? evil communication
by which they are surrounded. A few weak and desultory efforts are made
by the celebration of Divine service, twice every_Sundayby a Church ot
England minister, and, occasionally, by Dissenting ministers; hut these
areï¿½of little service, even to ch?ck the spread of, much less to nullify, the
criminal stain that already threatens to give a colour to our whole commu-
The assembling of a crowd is the signal for the numerous petty dealers
in fruit, and lemonade to gather to the spot, and often have I seen a seller
of lemonade elbowing his way through the congregation of a preacher, in the
midst of the most impressive portion of the service, crying his wares in so
lusty a manner as to drown the words of prayer. Even where this is wanting
there are invariably found hanging on the skirts of the assembled hearers,
some of those beauteous importations from the sister colony, who deem it


the very acme of bravado and ? flashness? to utter fearful blasphemies or
impure oaths, almost within the hearing of him who is breathing out the
Holy Word of God. Such scenes as these, often repeated, must nave their
effect; and once rob prayer of the robe of holiness with which in every
man?s mind it should be conceived to be clad, and you place the man who
sees it so divested, already on a level with the infidel, the scoffer, and the
criminal. Many a young and inexperienced man, whose only acquaintance
with crime has been through the columns of a newspaper, will now for the
first time, meet it face to face, and will perchance hold conversation with
the criminal, not, of course, without loathing at first; but then this will
soon wear off - . Afterwards will come pleasant tales, jokes cracked in New-
gate, or during the perpetration of a robbery; then will follow some thrilling
adventure, the end of which has been blood?and the youth has listened,
and has bid the tale teller ? good nightafterwards, and from that hour,
he falls, and he knows it too, a step lower in moral standing. Should he
not begone of firm mind and purpose, the repetition of these tales gradually
robs vice of its deformity, and begets a fatal leniency for crime. Once look
upon crime without disfavor, and its omission follows hard upon it; and the
inexperienced youth shortly becomes the convicted felon. Should such a
case arise, which there is but too much reason to fear, at whose door will
the sin lie??
At whose door indeed? let that question be answered by
every father who sends his child to a place where such dangers
are to be incurred. The answer, one would have supposed,
were obvious enough; but it seems that a ?do-nothing govern-
ment? is the scape-goat upon which even parental and indi-
vidual responsibility is to be shifted. Should the case arise?
the case that is, of a young man being led into crime by bad
example at the diggings ??the fault lies? according to the
correspondent, not with the youth himself?not with his friends
or parents who have aided or induced him to go there?no?
the fault lies, forsooth, ?with the Government, and upon
their head would the sin rest." Fallacies such as these,
it is true, refute themselves, but it is only another proof of the
strange inconsistencies which the whole newspaper press has ex-
hibited in their incapacity to perceive, or in their determination
not to perceive, any evil in gold digging of which the source
can be traced to the pursuit itself, or the individual
folloiving it.
To revert, however, to the dangers by which youth is sur-
rounded at the gold fields; these in fact, lie far deeper and
take a far wider range than those contemplated by the writer
just quoted. Supposing not a convict to remain, and not a
crime?in the legal acceptation of the word to be committed?
would no demoralizing influence be left at work among a popu-
lation so situated and employed as those who are located in and
around Mount Alexander? There is a purity more sustaining
than can ever be achieved by the mere absence of thieves and


murderers; a satisfaction more enduring, and a labour more
ennobling, than can ever result from the unintermitted gather-
ing of gold. There are such things as contentment and peace
of mind that are surely worth a thought, ere they be perilled
without sternest necessity, for the sake of that by which they
are not unfrequently destroyed. There are such things as
decent habits and gentle manners: things which, if Christianity,
not less than civilization, enjoins, ought not to be lightly
hazarded; and ascending higher still in the scale of spiritual
requisition, there are moral and intellectual faculties for the
cultivation of which man is responsible to his God, and for the
neglect of which it would be no excuse to Him whose most
glorious gifts they are, that their possessor was led away from
their culture by the more world-profitable occupation of filling
his pocket, even from the shining particles that lay scattered
under his feet.
These remarks apply not only to the young, but to all who
have embarked in the pursuits and habits, which belong to the
gold digger?s vocation. Is it meant therefore to be insinuated
that it is an unholy one, or that all who engage in it must
necessarily sink in their own estimation, or that of others as
Christians and gentlemen?? Emphatically is any such insinu-
ation disclaimed ?instances of the contrary are within the
writer?s knowledge; but, he does say this; that there is, in the
pursuit, the risk of such deterioration. Looking no higher
than as regards the question of manners, (by which, be it
borne in mind, is meant something better than mere Chester-
field conventionalism) will it be denied that they are in some
peril from the atmosphere around them ? The general contempt
of dress and personal appearance, the crowding together of
numbers in places where decent accommodation can hardly
be provided for one ?the smoking and drinking and swearing,
of which there is no avoiding the sight nor the sound ?all this
must have a tendency to weaken that regard for external
decencies, and to impair that sense of self respect, which lies
at the foundation of the manners, not to say the morals, of
civilized and domestic life. Certainly these are not the sub-
stantial of existence; but they are most valuable accessories,
and without them we should speedily relapse into a state of
barbarism. Genius and virtue, it is not denied, may be found
accoutred in a ? jumper? and ? wide-a-wake,? meditating amid
the fumes of a cigar, with an unshaven countenance, beneath
the shelter of a dray, and the shade of a tarpaulin. All that
can be said in such case, is, that genius and virtue arc worthy


of better bousing and more dignified costume. Diogenes was
a philosopher, but in these days we should not think more
highly of him for residing in a tub.
So much has been said of the moral and social results of our
gold discoveries, that little space is left to enlarge upon its
actual and probable effects upon our national prosperity. The
experience of history, however, has shown that in all countries
where abundance of the precious metals has been found,
agriculture, and almost every other source of internal wealth,
has been abandoned or neglected And it has been as incon-
testably shown by writers of undeniable authority, that where
this neglect takes place, the real source of a nation?s wealth
remains undeveloped. Mexico and the Brazils are, compara-
tively, modern instances of this truth; the former has never
recovered from the debasing and obstructive spirit infused into
its civilization, by the followers of Cortez; whilst the discovery
of diamonds and silver in the latter, was at once the signal
and date of its commercial decline. The state of things which
it brought about is thus described by a writer in the Encyclo-
paedia Britannica, under the article 'Brazil.? ?
? The same inflated passion for mining speculations which
had characterized the Spanish settlers in South America, now
began to actuate the Portuguese. Adventurers crowded to the
scene of action from all the captaincies; not mere "landless
resolutes? alone, but men of substance also. Labourers and
capital were drained off to the mining districts. The Engenhos
were either abandoned or left half cultivated, from the inability
of the proprietors to offer for slaves, the ruinous prices paid by
the adventurers of the mines. Brazil, which had hitherto in
a great measure supplied Europe with Sugar, sank before the
competition of the French and English, who had no mines to
distract their attention. Commerce of every kind declined
along with this staple commodity.?
A more recent instance of similar effects in demoralizing the
natives, as well as injuring the country, is given in Dickens'
Household Words, in a sketch of the inhabitants and district
of Saffragam in the Island of Ceylon. The following is an
extract :
?In the neighbourhood of Ratnapoora exist many tracts of clayey and
gravelly land, rich in rubies, sapphires, garnets, turquoise, and cat?s eyes.
For the privilege of digging for these, or of sifting them from the sands of
some of the rivers, the natives pay heavy rents to government; often sub-
letting the ground at large profits to needy speculators. Their harvest is
usually offered for sale during the Peraharra; and be their gains what they
may, they are generally rid of the whole amount before the end of the


festival. The existence of this source of wealth is unfortunately, a bane,
rather than a blessing, to the district; for whole villages flock to thereby
grounds, delving and sifting for weeks together, utterly neglecting their
rice fields and gardens. Arrack taverns have multiplied, intemperance lias
increased, long tracts of fertile lands have ceased to be sown with
and the country people now buy their food from strangers, in place of
growing it, as formerly. It will be a happy time for Saffragain when its
stores of precious stones shall be exhausted, for not till then will peaceful
industry be once more sought .?
Of the demoralizing effects of the gold discoveries upon our
own population, and that in a proportion infinitely out-balancing
its better results, I shall say no more; let him, who doubts
this truth, listen for the blast that from Time?s startling trumpet
will soon proclaim it. But I have a word or two to say on the
state of peril in which our existence, as a commercial country,
is placed; for all the raving and cant in the world about
Squatocracy or any other ocracy can no more rave or cant
away the fact that our wool-growing interests are in imminent
peril, than it can be denied that those interests have, hitherto
been the sole source of our national importance and prosperity.
Some may think that this will no longer be the case, and that,
if need be, these interests, and every other, ought to give way
to those which have arisen out of our gold traffic. Perhaps it
will save the trouble of calling names to those who have no
better answer to give to distasteful opinions, if the writer con-
fesses that he is one of those ?besotted fools? who think other-
wise, and that upon this point he is almost as insane ?as the
?Times? itself has been voted to be. And as the ?Thun-
derer? has been rather unhandsomely treated in the matter,
and has, for his opinions, been, by certain Colonial wise-acres,
? Sent to the D - - 1 somewhat ere his time,? ?
a compendious style of criticism, which, however illegitimate
it may have been decreed by the intellectual hierachy ot the
old world, seems particularly adapted to the conception of a
go-a-hcad community like this, if we may judge from its
frequent use ?as the Times, I have said, has not had quite
fair play, and its sentiments are substantially those of the
writer?s also, the ?absurdity? and ?madness? with which
it has been charged shall be here recorded, that it may be seen
how far the ? Thunderer ? has proved himself demented, and
whether the critics of the London Jove deserve to meet with
more dignified treatment than was vouchsafed to the Olympian
Vulcan. Its introduction to the readers of the ?Melbourne
Morning Herald,? is in a strain of commendation somewhat
at variance with the subsequent remarks of that discriminating


journal. ?We take ? says the editor, ? the following interest-
ing and powerful article from the ?Times' of 7th of May,
and feel assured it will be read with interest by all.? It is to
be hoped that it will be read; if not by all, at least by those
who have formed their opinion of its character only by the
commentaries they have heard or seen thereon. Thus, then,
the ? Thunderer? hurls forth his bolts.
? Eight months ago, when the first news of the discovery of Gold in
Australia arrived in this country, we lost no time in emphatically warning
the then government of the perils which necessarily waited on the* new state
of things. _ We showed that owing to the mistaken policy which by artifi-
cially raising the price of land has prevented the permanent settling in
homes of their own of the greater portion of the population, the working
classes of the colony having broken through the ties which bound them to
the mother-country were extremely migratory and unsettled in their habits,
and sure to be attracted from the ordinary pursuits of industry by the
enticing lottery of the gold field. We pointed out that a large number of
these persons were men of lawless habits and desperate characters, who
would be drawn together by the common principle of attraction, and learn
from their numbers the secret of their strength, and that if they had the
will they would certainly have the power to dictate their own conditions to
the Executive Government. From all this we took occasion to urge upon
Ministers the necessity of reinforcing the handful of troops in the colony
so as at once to defend public property and enforce obedience to the laws.
Nothing but the weakness of the Colonial Government and the obvious
impolicy of parading? that weakness, and teaching the miners their own
strength, could excuse the manner in which the rich golden deposits, the
undoubted property of the public, have been abandoned to be rifled in
consideration of a merely nominal payment. Had the Governors of New
South Wales and Victoria possessed a force equal to the assertion of the
rights of Her Majesty?s Government, they would have been utterly inexcu-
sable in allowing the resources of the public revenue to be wasted, the
industry of the colony to be deranged, and its capital to be destroyed,
in order to raise to sudden and unmerited affluence, never before heard of,
except in an Oriental tale, men so little able to appreciate the value of the
riches which have been thus almost forced upon them, that improving upon
the hint of Cleopatra when she drank diluted pearls, they can find no better
use for the five-pound notes with which they are encumbered than to smoke
them instead of tobacco.
That the Colonial Government has acted prudently in not seeking to
command where it was without the power to compel, is manifest from the
failure of the attempt of Mr. Latrohe, the Governor of Port Phillip, to
double the licence fee demanded from the miners in his colony. Instead of
thirty shillings a month Mr. Latrobe demanded three pounds, a sum quite
inconsiderable compared with the average profit realised from the Victoria
gold field. This demand he has been unable to enforce. A thousand of
the miners met together, denouncing, though upon what ground we are
unable to conceive, the increase as illegal, and passing a resolution which
pledged them to protect by force any miner from whom it should be sought
to be exacted. The government gave way without a struggle to these
threats of stronghanded resistence to lawful authority, and the miners are
for the moment satisfied. But the authority of the government is gone,


its weakness is confessed patent und notorious, and it henceforth only exists
bv the sufferance of a lawless and heterogeneous multitude whom it lias
instructed in the terrible secret of its own uncontrollable strength, the
same will which repealed with a breath the reasonable and moderate
demand of a government for the price at which it was willing to part with
the property held by it, in trust for the community, can impose any
other conditions and break through any other restrictions. *ï¿½ re aie 110
longer two parties to the contract between the gold-seekers and the govern-
ment. They take as much and pay as little as they please, and it is not m
the power of the government to induce them to take less or to pay more.
There is every probability that this evil is only in its commencement, the
superior richness of the mines of Victoria is draining thither not merely the
surplus population of South Australia, but those who have hitherto employed
themselves in the rich but less productive districts of New South Wales,
and the probability is that a very large proportion of the adult population
of the Australian colonies will meet together on a single spot, without torce
to control, authority to guide, or enlightened intelligence to direct them.
Robberies and murders are already rapidly on the increase, and while ie
material interests which hold society together are loosened, crime is encour-
aged bv impunity and stimulated by the abundance of its booty. As those
persons have met together by no concert, and with no preconceived idea of
common action, some time of course must elapse before they can be brought
to act in unison, but every day brings us nearer to such a result, without,
as far as we can see, raising? up any force adequate to counteract it.
Under these circumstances we recur to the recommendation which we
offered to the Government, in September last, the sending without delay
to the colony, a sufficient armed force to enable Her Majesty?s Government
to assert the dignity of the law, and protect the property of the public.
Whatever be the terms on which it is thought expedient to permit the
digging for gold on the lands of the Crown, those terms ought to be the
result of free and calm deliberation, uninfluenced by fear or menace .
Where this is not the case, the public resources are surrendered to pulage.
If a large mob of persons were to settle themselves on one of the Moya
Forests , and refuse either to remove or pay any rent , except what they
themselves might assess , it would be a mere mockery to call such a strong
handed intrusion by the name of tenancy. Just so, if the riches oj
Australia are to be taken upon such terms as takers please, the act is
really one of plunder though it be disguised under the name of license.
We have shown on other occasions how cruelly the vested interests ot the
colony suffer by their unequal competition with the enormous wealth which
the working classes are dividing among themselves; the case 18 the hardei
when it is considered that that very w?ealth which is the cause of their nun
might be made the means of their preservation. The troops which would
be'required to protect the gold fields from the invasion of a lawless mob
would by that very act of protection, enable the local government to inise
a revenue far more than sufficient to defray the cost of their presence.
How strange that we who suffer the Colonial Office to regulate the minutest
affairs at the antipodes, should abstain from interfering to arrest an evil
which threatens to subvert the very foundations of society! It depends
upon our government whether the boundless treasures of Australia shall be
employed in debauching and corrupting the lower orders, recruited as they
have been, year by year, by the most desperate and incorrigible of our
criminals, and in ruining those who have invested capital under the protec-
tion of our government; or, whether after leaving an ample remuneration


for the miner, a surplus should not be diverted to maintaining the force
requisite for the protection of law and order , and for transporting to those
fortunate shores the want and misery which oppress us here. Anarchy and
ruin on the one side?peace, order, and property on the other. The choice
does not seem difficult, but unfortunately to save the colony requires action,
while its ruin can be accomplished, without our aid; and the colonial office
which has so often tampered with the laws of political economy when they
conduce to the advantage of the colonies, cannot be induced to moderate
their severity when necessarily tending to their destruction.
The italics are not in the original, but are marked here to
designate the real gist of this much abused article, which
requires only to be read with common attention to show that,
whether its author be right or wrong in his views, his main
object is to give expression to these three propositions: ?
I. That the gold fields, being the property of the commu-
nity and held in trust by the government for them, as a source
of revenue to meet the general wants, are not therefore, of
right, open to the occupation of any individual who chooses to
carry away their treasures for such price only as he may be
willing to pay.
11. That the government is bound, as the Trustee of the
public, to protect, if it can, these treasures from individual
spoliation ; and that it amounts to spoliation where the taker
of the gold fixes his own price for the license, and refuses to
pay that which the government asks, simply because the
latter is not strong enough to enforce its demands.
111. That, in as much as, in consequence of its want of
power, the government has been unable to impose such a rent
for the occupation of the gold fields as would, at the same time
be a fair equivalent to the public for the riches surrendered,
and a security against the withdrawal of labour from all other
pursuits ?but, on the contrary, has been constrained to allow
the colony?s gold to be carried away at a merely nominal fee,
and thereby caused enormous abstractions of the public
treasures, as well as deranged the industry and demoralized
the social condition of the population; it is desirable that such
a state of things should be put an end to, and that for the
sake of the community and protection of the property held
in trust for it by the government, the latter ought to be
furnished with the means of enforcing its regulations and
of maintaining thereby the public rights as well as the
public peace and order.
That these propositions contain the essence or substance of
what was intended to be conveyed, no candid reader of the
article in question can deny; and yet it has been made the


subject of as much vituperation and abuse, as if tbc writer bad
been guilty of high treason against the rights and liberties of
every individual in Victoria. Any attempt at serious refutation
of the fallacious conclusions which have been drawn from it,
after a perusal of the article itself, would be time wasted, and
an insult to the understanding of those who have once atten-
tively read it. Some of the tirades to which it has given rise
are what might have been expected from the nature of theii
source ; but that the genius which presides over our two daily
journals, should turn up its nose at the fulminations of the
? Thunderer ? and shake its fist in the ? Leviathan s face for
expounding what, one of them at least, has admitted to be
? the opinions of the most influential classes in England
is rather surprising, and is a consequence which the ? Times
itself, with all its power of foresight, could hardly have anti-
cipated. To say nothing of so unkind a cut from brother chips
of the vox populi doctrine, it could not have escaped the
penetration of either, when they were indulging in such facetious
persiflage as ?gunpowder medicine? ?bullet pills ?bayonet
law? and so forth, that they were totally wide of the true mark
aimed at by the ? Times.? It has been already explained
what that aim is; let the Victorian journalists defeat it fairly
if they can; or say boldly, if they mean to say it, that the
gold of the colony belongs to any one who chooses to take it;
or what is the same thing, that it is unconstitutional or tyrannic
to resist the unlicensed occupation of the public lands, and
the abstraction therefrom of the public gold. Let them
assert this, and make if they can, their assertion good; but to
expend their wit in demolishing propositions which the ? Times
never intended to maintain, or in ridiculing what is put forth
by it, as illustrative only of the principle contended for, with-
out confronting the principle itself; is neither fair to that
journal, nor to the readers of those in which such an abortive
onslaught upon it, is made.
After all, one thing is pretty clear; ?Dr. Times may ? or
may not, as the ? Herald ? observes ?be a great Doctor,
but the evils which he is so presumptuous as to suppose reme-
diable by his own prescription, have as yet, from no other
Doctor, great or small, elicited a better. The only one
hitherto proposed, and still believed in by many, as an infallible
specific, has proved signally defective. It is vain to shut our
eyes to the fact, that emigration is, instead of checking, fear-
fully magnifying the disease under which the colony is
groaning. Scores upon scores are being daily added to our


population, but the great object for which their advent was
invited ?for which their departure from the mother country
was hastened and encouraged ?-viz. the supply of labour for
our national wants ?has, if we are to judge from any percep-
tible results, not only not been thereby attained, but has been
made of attainment more difficult still. Nor is this to be
wondered at, for, could he resist the temptation of the gold
fields, where is the roof beneath which the newly arrived
emigrant can find shelter for even a temporary sojourn, much
more a permanent home, except at a cost few can afford to pay,
or in abodes habitable only at the risk of contamination to
morals, or injury to health?
The result is, disguise it as we may, that our boasted anti-
dote is being converted into a bane; that our enemy has been
joined by the forces sent out to subdue him; that the fire
which threatens to consume us has been strengthened and
increased by the materials heaped upon it for its suppression.
The channel devised for an outlet to the waters, and a check
to the rapidity, of this moral Niagara?s far-sounding and
resistless torrent has added considerably to both. Through
this same channel a thousand tributary streams have rushed
into the torrent?s engulphing bed; but, instead of resulting,
like that of the Nile, in a fertilizing overflow, their instanta-
neous absorption has only shown how inexhaustible are the
depths into which they have been precipitated, and how vain
is the hope of a rise to the surface from the mere presence of
invading currents or the influx of supplementary streams.
The result of this ?I will not say, scarcity?for it is, in
reality, an annihilation ?of procurable labour, will be in
time, the ruin of the colony as a habitable place for all who
value domestic comfort, or the growth of moral and intellectual
civilization. Its more immediate effects will be a degeneration
of our natural staple commodity, for, against such a dearth
of labor as now exists, the class of colonists on whom its pro-
duce depends, cannot long contend. The casual and uncertain
supply which, at particular times, may perchance be secured,
will not suffice for the wool grower; he must be able to depend
on the continuance of the services of those to whom he entrusts
the care of his flocks. The squatter?s vocation will disappear
fast enough without any help from popular outcry; and though
he may still continue to keep up some stock of cattle or sheep,
it will be for the shambles of Bendigo or Mount Alexander,
not for the wool or tallow markets of Europe and Great Britain.
In the character of carcase butchers they may flourish for a time,


but as breeders of sheep, or exporters of wool, their ? occupa*
tion is gone. ? Let it not be supposed that the writer is
exaggerating the evil which has led to this state of things, or
that he is solitary in his notions of the inadequacy of the
expected remedy. Weeks ago, the ? Melbourne Morning
Herald ,? in an article on the ? extermination of the native
dog,? thus descanted on this subject: ?
?The increasing want of labour consequent upon the all absorbing
attractions of the gold fields, is every day becoming more manifest in the
rural districts, and it is now a question of deep consideration whether
some means may not he devised by which manual labour cannot be dimin-
ished. This has led to the conception of a project by Mr. Goodman of
Benalla, which, if successful, cannot fail to be attended with many impor-
tant advantages. It is nothing less than doing away with the necessity of
employing shepherds, by the extermination of the native dog, when in
the absence of so destructive a foe the settler?s flocks may roam unmo-
lested and take care of themselves. So novel a plan of sheep farming par-
ticularly in such a district as the Goulburn, can scarcely fail to be attended
with very beneficial results. The sheep will improve in condition, will be
freed from foot-rot, will yield heavier fleeces, and turn out a more remu-
nerative article of stock than has ever been the case before. Besides some-
thing must be done to meet the inevitable difficulties daily springing up
from the insufficiency of our labour supplies. As to the expected emigra-
tion in the present unsettled state of the colony, if the labouring classes
of Great Britain do come out, it is useless to expect of them to dispel all
their long formed golden visions, by settling down contentedly to take
charge of a flock of sheep. Something therefore must be done, and be done
quickly. Labour must be either had in sufficient abundance or the neces-
sity of it lessened by every practicable means. The former cannot now
be obtained and an experiment is proposed to accomplish to some degree
the latter.?
What does this language mean, but that all hope of relief
from emigration is fallacious. Whether any is to be had from
the ? extermination of the native dog,? in the present state of
things, even if plans for any such purpose were feasible, is a
question not very difficult to solve. Leaving its solution,
however, to those who hope to find their account in the task,
it may surely be asked with some degree of pertinency, whether,
if prevention be better than cure, the former would not have
been very decidedly effectuated by the extermination of the
native gold? This also is a problem of no very difficult
solution, even for those who have not been able to get over
the pons asinorum.
Will it be said, that it is of little consequence whether gold
or wool be the link of our commercial relationship with the
mother country, and the rest of the civilized world? As a
question of political economy, it could be demonstrated, if it


fell within the objects of this pamphlet to show it, that a
wool exporting is in a more prosperous condition, than a gold
exporting colony; but there is an English side to this question,
in which not only the interests of the home manufacturers,
but of humanity itself, are deeply concerned. By any con-
siderable falling off in the annual supply of wool to England
from the colony (and, at present, Australia and the Cape
supply nearly sixty per cent, of all the foreign wool imported
into Great Britan) thousands upon thousands of our country-
men in the wool manufacturing districts would be reduced to
misery and ruin. In Rochdale, Bradford, Manchester, and
other manufacturing towns, there is a population far more
numerous than have yet congregated, or can for some time
congregate at the gold fields, altogether dependant upon the
prosperity of the wool trade, and the importation of the staple
article into Great Britain. Is there then to be no sympathy
for the actual necessities of the working man of our own native
country, because any consideration for him would interfere
with the accumulation of boundless wealth by the comparatively
insignificant portion of them, that have come out here? Is
selfishness so intense, or blindness so gross, that consequences
such as these can be disregarded or overlooked, in contempla-
ting the possibility of any national deficiency in the annual
exportation of our hitherto staple commodity ? That fears
upon this head are not unfounded, the reader may now see
almost every day, in the extracts from the English press, in
our own journals, from which he will learn that the most serious
apprehensions are entertained by all parties in England most
competent to form a judgment on the matter. In a recent
letter to the ? Sydney Morning Herald, Mr. Gideon S.
Lang, no particular ally of the Squatters, but fully alive,
nevertheless, to the importance of the commerce dependent on
the exercise of their pursuits, under fair conditions, thus
remarks:
?The tendency of the gold now is to depreciate the quality of the wool;
the scarcity of labour renders it impossible to keep the different classes ot
breeding sheep separate in the proper season; and the demand for butchers?
meat makes the squatter naturally turn his attention to the carcase instead
of the wool. In addition to this, make the stock holder liable to be turned
out at a day?s notice, as the Legislative Council of Victoria wished the other
day, and you compel him to look to the carcase alone, so as to be able to
boll down the greatest possible number at the shortest notice, and then let
England look to some other quarter for her fine wool, for she certainly will
not get it here. The depreciation now going on, particularly in Victoria,
is, I have every reason to believe, equal to twenty per cent, on the quality
of the wool, or ï¿½300,000 of its value.?


But it is not only our pastoral interests that are suffering'
every thing on the progress of which our social elevation and
our character as a moral and intellectual community depends,
is withering away beneath the blast of this accursed breath
from the simoom-like atmosphere of the gold-fields. Some of
its earlier effects upon those institutions, tastes, and pursuits,
which are the true index of national and municipal advance-
ment, have been already noticed; its later developements have
proved equally disastrous. Not only are science and literature,
even to the keeping up of a public garden or a library, repudiated;
but education, the great crying want of the colony goes beg-
ging vainly for alms in the prosecution of its holy work. Well
may a correspondent of the ? Melbourne Morning Herald
in commenting upon these results, observe that ? the discovery
of gold, however it may have enriched individuals, has not
tended to the encouragement of any of those interesting and
delightful pursuits which unite the better feelings and promote
the social interests of the community;? and well does he
remark ?? If it be the gold which has discouraged so much
that is good, permit me to refer your reader to ? Timon of
Athens? where Timon soliloquizes ?? Earth yields me roots?
for a better understanding of what the influences and effects of
gold are when raised from the earth, to the neglect of the
ordinary cultivation of the soil.?
What will have to be recorded of our condition eight months
hence, it remains to be seen; but if eight months ago the
following was a true picture of it, how much more of verisi-
militude is there in such a description now. ? The effect of
our gold discovery? (says the author of ? Gold and the Govern-
ment,? writing at the close of last year,) ? has been, up to the
present time, positively injurious. It has stayed public works
and stopped public buildings, depreciated the money value of
all articles that are not absolutely indispensible and increased
materially that of the necessaries of life. It has rendered all
useful labour scarce, and in some cases unattainable, added
fearfully to the difficulties of those who were already poor in
purse, and infirm and weak in body, and unhinged in a greater
or less degree the minds of every human being in the commu-
nity. What a practical illustration does all this furnish, of
the oft asserted worthlessness of gold when coveted for its own
sake, worthlessness admitted as often as asserted, and yet now
as ever practically disregarded.?
And what is the end of all this to be? has, perhaps, already
been exclaimed by the reader ?to what purpose this laments-


tion? be the evils as represented ?where is the remedy??
The answer is simple enough?remove the root of the disease,
if it can be done?if not, apply the best palliative thereto
that can be found. The cause of our evils is not in the gold,
but in the fatal facility of its acquirement.
It is not true that the cost or the hardship of the pursuit are
sufficient to deter any appreciable portion of the labouring
classes from becoming gold diggers. Here and there an indi-
vidual may be met with who, from want of perseverance, or ill
health, has returned in disgust, but even some of these have
gone back again?the failures, in short, are the exceptions,
success is the rule. The ? Herald's" correspondent writing
only a few days ago, from ?The Mount? is pretty clear upon
that point. ?1 can truly say? are his words, ? that, in the
long run, on these diggings, patience and perseverance have
succeeded in securing a prize to most; while a few fortunate
sons of the lucky genius, who superintend these mysterious
pits have come in the language of the Roman conqueror (sic
in orig.) veni, vidi, vici, or in plain digging language,
?dropped on it? at once, from ï¿½IOO up to a ï¿½6OOO prize;
this may he done in a day ; all is chance; never was there
a greater lottery; only, the prizes are more numerous, and
the blanks less than in ordinary times. * * * * As
an old hand at the diggings, let me strongly recommend all
new comers never to despair, or feel disappointed at a run of
bad luck, on their first operations; for the chances are ten to
one that by due patience and undying perseverance they
will gain a prize?a true digger's pocket."
In a state of circumstances such as this, it is manifest
that every thing dependent on labour will be neglected, until
either the gold is exhausted, or the conditions of obtaining it
have become such as to sink its attraction to the level of those
which belong to the ordinary kinds of colonial labour. How
this is to be done, is a consideration worthy of the best minds
in the community; for until it is done, or something towards
it, the emigration that is now pouring in upon us, in such an
overflowing tide, will be rather a perilous, than a salutary,
addition to our shores. If a thousand individuals were to land
on an uninhabited island for the purpose of colonizing it, and
upon the discovery of gold upon its surface, were all simulta-
neously to commence digging for, and supplying themselves
with, the precious metal, instead of raising habitations and
tilling the earth for their shelter and maintenance; the folly
of such a proceeding would only differ in degree from that


which is now exhibited in the reckless and indiscriminate
concentration of labour upon the gold fields of Victoria. What
is to become of the wives and children of the hundreds now
almost hourly arriving in our metropolis, if no habitation can
be procured or built for them ? and none can be procured or
built whilst the gold fields are accessible, under their present
conditions, to the bricklayer, the mason, and the carpenter.
Where too is the successful gold digger to locate himself on
his leaving the gold fields? who will help him to build his
house, till his land, or cart his produce, except at a price
which will speedily annihilate his boasted gains? How is the
education of his children to go on without school-houses and
school-masters; and if the former were erected, how are the
latter to be supported on the wretched pittance, to which their
salaries, necessary large, must now by the reduction in the
value of money, be reduced. What is to become of our public
works. Hoes any one so delude himself as to imagine that,
at a cost payable by even thrice the amount of our gold revenue
our necessities in this respect ?what may be called the merely
physical wants of the colony?can be adequately, or in any
degree, sufficiently supplied?
I do not believe that it is an exaggerated view of what is
passing around us, to estimate the probable expense of every
thing connected with the suppression and punishment of crime
at a sum that will very short reach half-a-million per annum.
To talk of paying policemen up to the mark of the wages from
which they can help themselves at the gold fields is ridiculous;
that they will sell such a privilege except upon their own terms,
it is absurd to suppose; and the consequence is that they are
not paid but bought; not hired but outbid, and that too in a
market to which they may always resort on a chance of better
terms, than those they have consented to accept. And are
the bricklayer, the mason, the carpenter, the shepherd, or the
gardener, less alive to the marketable value of their services than
the policeman ? assuredly not, as we all know to our cost.
The absorption of labour, then, by our gold fields, is not a
mere question of derangement to our pastoral interests, or
individual comforts, but is become a great national calamity.
It is an obstruction in the way of every thing on the progress
of which, not only our commercial prosperity, but the security
of our lives and property, and our social and moral welfare,
essentially depend. Even the gold diggers themselves are be-
ginning to find out the futility of its acquisition without some
objects on which it can be expended; and to perceive that if


labour be not diverted into some other channel, the ends which
alone make gold desirable will be defeated by the very facility
of the means employed in attaining it. The prosperity too of
the really labouring classes is becoming daily more endangered.
To a newly arrived emigrant, with his wife and family, anxious
to live by his own trade, and not desirous of repairing to the
gold fields?what are the inducements and conveniences for
remaining here ? Supposing he can procure, for his labour,
even ï¿½1 per day?what will he have left at the close of the
week, when he has paid for house rent, wood, water, and the
other necessaries of life at their present enormous prices ? only
a day or two ago the ?Melbourne Morning Herald ? had a
paragraph in its columns concluding thus ?? These may
be golden times for many, but we question if, since
Melbourne has been founded, pinching poverty and desti-
tution were ever so severely felt within its precincts as at
present Would this have been the case had our gold
discoveries not taken place ? we trow not.
From all that has been experienced, then, of its effects as
hitherto developed, is it too much to assert that the discovery
of gold in Victoria has turned out not a blessing, but a bane ?
And so it will continue, unless the people themselves become
energetic and unselfish enough to do what no government can
do?in the present state of affairs. Instead of grumbling that
a road is not made here, or a bridge put there; that the
corporation ought to do this, or the government that?let
them put their own shoulders to the wheel, and by the com-
bined effort of the immense capital that is now overflowing the
colony, endeavour to attain some of those pressing objects,
which, if not achieved in this way, will never be achieved at all.
Let them, for their own sakes, invite the Legislature to pass
an act interdicting gold digging for certain seasons of the year,
in order that during that time corn may be reaped, sheep shorn,
and last, not least, habitations built, both for the emigrant
from his ocean home, and the gold digger from his canvas tent.
Till this or something like this is done, emigration should be
checked rather than encouraged, if it be not done, the colony
as a habitable place for civilized man, is ruined.
A country can only rise in the scale of civilization by the
development of its resources in such a manner as to meet
both the physical and moral wants of its inhabitants. If
either be neglected, no amount of wealth can supply the
defect; and, as regards this Colony, the result will be that
of the thousands who have come here to profit by our gold,


hundreds will go elsewhere to spend it. Already have some
of our most respected residents taken their departure; and
others, probably, will soon follow who, until the period of our
gold discoveries, looked upon Victoria as their future and
abiding home. This feeling will, it is to be feared, continue
to influence many whom the Colony can ill spare, unless some
indication of a change for the better in the present aspect of
our social and moral condition begin speedily to appear.
Finally, nevertheless, for all who behold what is passing
around them, from the highest and holiest point of view, there
is Hope above, if there seem cause of despair below. God is
every where?go where we will, there is for all of us a sublime
part to be acted before a sublime Spectator. Not only, as our
great dramatist has represented it, is the world a stage, but
it is a stage on which the player may not resign his part,
merely to avoid the trials and struggles of its ever-shifting
scenes. The Christian colonist must not, therefore, too
hastily forswear the land of his adoption; but if, amidst the
excitement and worldliness on which, from serener heights
he looks down in sorrow and dismay, he can remain untainted,
let him remain contented. From those lofty summits, solitary
and companionless though he be, let him not descend: still
from that eminence let his voice be heard, even though its
echoes fall unheeded among the dwellers below. The hour,
however, may come when they will find some listeners, and
attract some footsteps upwards that may lead the way for
others to follow. Thus, out of individual, may perchance
spring national elevation; and the time yet arrive when,
over the depths from which she has emerged may be seen
waving in triumph the banner of Victoria, ?inscribed in
golden letters, but in celestial spirit? ? Excelsior,*? the
motto alike of its peoples? lips and its peoples? hearts. Then
may we hope for the dispersion of the mists and tempests by
which our social and moral atmosphere is now overcast and
disturbed; or, if they must still linger around it, that their
traces will speedily become fainter and fainter, till at length?
?Like the last cloud of an expiring storm,
?Whose thunder is its knell;?
they appear?only to announce their dissolution, and vanish,
to return no more.
* Every one will here recognize the allusion to Longfellow?s beautiful Poem.
