ADVANCE AUSTRALIA ALL !
The land that we live in,
The land that we love,
Its interests we place
All others above;
At one cry we rally
Whene?er comes the call?
Advance Australia! Advance Australia!
Advance Australia all!
Our hearts beat the faster,
Our eyes glow with fire,
Our beings they tremble
With intense desire,
Whenever a true one
The challenge lets fall?
Advance Australia! Advance Australia!
Advance Australia all!
Live we by the ocean,
By gulf, sea, or bay,
By river or hill side,
Or outback far away,
We ever are ready
Awaiting the call?
Advance Australia! Advance Australia!
Advance Australia all!


AUSTRALIANS! MEET THE DROUGHT
BRAVELY!
Australians! Meet the drought bravely!
Prepare for the worst! Right and well!
Consider the future most gravely!
There is need! All portents foretell!
Demon Drought is once more upon us,
Waste and Want are once more at hand,
So who will advance to the front ranks
To save our own loved land ?
Let champions advance at once boldly,
And by well-learnt experience make clear
The best way to avert arid failure,
And the future to meet without fear.
The rain that comes down from above us.
The water that comes up from below,
Let it be used to the very best advantage
To make good things for all living ones
grow.
Trees, shrubs, bushes, herbs, and grasses
All over the land be now grown,
So that never again may Australia
Be shamed by the beast?s dying moan.
For wherever a sheep dies by hunger,
For wherever a cow dies by thirst,
God all round us giveth righteous judgment,
And each one becomes duly accurst.
AUSTRALIA.
Land of the Acacia!
Land of the Sun!
Land of true Liberty!
Land of the One!


I long for Love,
For Love I sigh!
I live for Love,
For Love I die!
A CLIMAX.
Representing Monaro and .Australia for
ever communing and expressing' Monaro?s
fitness and Australia?s appeal for the Com-
monwealth?s controlling centre to be located
within Monaro.
Land! The Land demands it.
Sea! Brings it to thee.
Air! Makes claim unceasing.
Light! The Elements agree!
THE UNEXPECTED GIFT.
The gift that comes by chance
My mind with pleasure fills,
It makes my heart to dance,
And me with rapture thrills!
THE AIR.
The Air is a being
Which feels like ourselves,
With sensation quivering?
Full of Fairies, Imps, Elves!
AN ANGELIC INTIMATION.
The Angels one day gave
this message to me:
The Keyword of our life
is ?Gracefully.?


Come to Australia! To Australia come!
Australia wants you! Brave men and women
staunch,
Who ready are to venture and trust your-
selves to her,
She now invites you freely and truly bids you
welcome,
?Come, make your home with me, and with
me live and grow,?
You need never fear a failure, there is wealth
for all?not some.
Come to Australia! To Australia come!
The dreams that you have dreamed of but
scarcely hoped fulfilled,
Australia will give you, and offer you much
more;
Her land is waiting for you, her rivers and
her seas,
She has plenty still to give, with plenty more
in store,
Wealth?s blessings, inter alia, are here for
those who come.
Come to Australia! To Australia come!
Here in this land of freedom?where men as
brothers are?
A new life here awaits you cheered by the
bright day star;
Your children and their children will bless
your fateful choice
In a land controlled and governed by equal
vote and voice.
?One hundred thousand welcomes? we give
to all who come.
Come to Australia! To Australia come!


When you find yourself in trouble,
And everything looks black,
Resolve to make the best of it,
And give dull care the sack.
In every state of life you?ll find
Some compensations there
If you only try to make the best of it
And take of woe your share.
As time goes by there?s sure to be
Rewards for trials borne,
If you but try to make the best of it
Then you?ll smile instead of mourn.
MY FATAL DESTINATION.
I love Love,
I hate Hate.
I love my fate,
when I hate.
If I must hate?
I hate that fate.
For livingly I love,
fatally I hate!


AN ORIENTAL AUSTRALIAN ANTHEM
May the Nation of Australia last
Whilst Mount Kosciusko lasts!
And may Mount Kosciusko last
While the Nation of Australia lasts!
And may the Nation of Australia last
Whilst any portion of Mount Kosciusko
remains above the Ocean!
(Adapted from the Japanese National
Anthem.)
SOME SUNDAY SOON.
May I with you the whole day be,
Soon come that day to you and me,
May nature with our joy agree:
Some Sunday soon.
Short Sunday evenings we have spent,
Their shortness have us sorrow lent,
Our thoughts to that glad whole day went,
Some Sunday soon.
Thank Heaven! It now will not be long;
The realisation coming makes us strong,
And hope vibrates us with the song?
Some Sunday soon.
A CHORUS.
I love Australia?
The land of my birth.
I love Australia?
The best land on earth.
I love Australia?
The land of the free.
I love Australia?
Australia for me!


Australia loves the Noble!
Australia loves the Brave!
Australia watches with us
From the cradle thro? the grave!
Australia is our Mother!
Australia is our Child!
Australia is our Heaven
Just for a little while,
Australia loves her Children,
All nestling on her breast:
But Australia loves her Lovers?
The Truest and the Best!
THE TRUE AUSTRALIAN GENTLEMAN.
What nobler type of man is there,
And who with him can you compare?
Who willing is his last to share?
The true Australian Gentleman.
Strong with the strong, but gentle with the
weak,
Fierce in a fight, and yet it doth not seek,
But not afraid his real mind to speak?
The true Australian Gentleman.
His friendships are for ever and a day,
And that the one you pass his way,
Help given he once may have his say?
The true Australian Gentleman.
The best he always seeks to win,
And he fights fair thro? thick and thin,
E?er glad when some one?s luck is in?
The true Australian Gentleman.


By passions moved he holds himself in hand,
Right he obeys and right he gives command,
Perhaps over zealous for his own dear Land?
The true Australian Gentleman.
All things he treats with pity kind,
And their due needs he bears in mind,
And in their joy doth pleasure find?
The true Australian Gentleman.
Women he treats as if they angels are,
For them he comes or goes the farthest far,
And shuns aught that would his ideal mar?
The true Australian Gentleman.
A promise is with him a sacred thing,
And thro? his voice you hear the truth true
ring?
A challenge quickly a response will bring
The true Australian Gentleman.
Careful is he that none by him shall fall,
What?s wished for himself is also wished for
And it?s man to man with him or not at all?
The true Australian Gentleman.
God and the Devil to him are One,
Yet unwise extremes he seeks to shun,
Possessed of self-respect: respect well won?
The true Australian Gentleman.
THE LAND OF THE BLAZING SUN.
Australia is the land of the blazing sun?
And in our time she hath begun
To say unto her Sisters and her
Kindly recognise me, all you others!?


The Cry of the Captives.
We are waiting, waiting, waiting,
Waiting for some happy change.
We are tired, heartsick, weary?
God?s ways to us seem strange.
Why are we thus imprisoned?
When from hence will we go forth?
Why do we so greatly suffer?
Have we incurred God?s wrath?
So we sit in sullen silence,
Or list with unconcern.
We spend our time in longing
For Fortune?s tide to turn.
The Voice of Encouragement.
No longer be inactive!
No longer nothing do!
Around you lies your duty,
So, what is best?that do!
To bear your lot with patience
Is something worth due praise.
Acts of kindness to your neighbours
All will Heavenward raise.
Each day for your acceptance
Life brings its chance to you
To improve yourself, and others,
So, what is best?that do!
The Response.
Yes, now, and for the future,
Something we?ll try to do
For ourselves, and for the others ?
Yes, what is best, we?ll do!
God help us so to do!


EVOLUTION OF THE NUMBERS
When everything was nothing
Except a misty mass,
Then Nothing wished for Something
And One then came to pass.
One loved its own reflection
When it, It came to view,
And so for its refection
Created Number Two.
Filled with co-admiration,
Those two did then agree
To produce a mutual image,
And so made Number Three.
The bliss that was them thrilling
The Two for Three made store,
The want of love fulfilling,
And gave Three Number Four.
These Five and Six created,
And these made Seven and Eight;
By these one more is wanted
To cure Nine?s lonely fate.
FAITH AND FACT.
If your Will you would obtain?
Claim!
Assert!
and then
Maintain!


FAIR PENITENT! FOR US FOR EVER
PRAY!
I see you at the Altar lowly kneeling,
I see you there so early in the day,
Your true devotion you are there revealing;
Fair Penitent! for us for ever pray!
Your prayers for Husband far are rising,
And from his good your thoughts decline
to stray,
Sometimes perchance his mates and friends
comprising;
Fair Penitent! for us for ever pray!
Although you know I wait till you are ended.
And that perhaps I may no longer stay.
Your prayers rise up as previously intended;
Fair Penitent! for us for ever pray!
Pray on, sweet Saint! and may the Angels
Go where you ask, and there in service
stay;
Soon may sad Fortune cease you two to sever
Fair Penitent! for us for ever pray!
A MARTIAL WARNING.
(Written several years before the Great
War, but even now once more, more or less
appropriate.)
You?Men, of Australia!
Are you sluggards at heart?
When in defence of your Country,
You shirk to take part.
You leave it to boys?
With true valour imbued?
To train up as soldiers
Which you have eschewed.
So now can you wonder
In camp, street, and mart
The women avoid you,
But take them to their heart!


A FINAL INITIATION.
When at length I entered Heaven
Came this message?strange but true,
??Now to know to you is given:
You are Me, and I am You!?
DEAR OLD CHUM.
Our dear old Chum is nearly done,
His well spent life is almost run,
And yet to hear him?s real good fun,
Altho? he has but saying one:
?Chum, Chum, with a Chum, Chum,
Chum, Chum, Chum.?
Each morning he gets out of bed,
He brushes well his old bald head,
Hands round he shakes, nought does instead,
To each one, and for Grace is said,
?Chum, Chum, with a Chum, Chum,
Chum, Chum, Chum.?
Sometimes there?s something makes him
wild;
He makes us smile to see him riled;
He storms about, by nought beguiled,
And swears with language undefiled?
?Chum, Chum, with a Chum, Chum,
Chum, Chum, Chum.?


If someone tries to take him down,
His face takes on a most quaint frown;
Oh no! you cannot do him brown,
He winks, and says to his renown?
?Chum, Chum, with a Chum, Chum,
Chum, Chum, Chum.?
And when the Children go to bed,
He lollies gives for prayers well said;
His hands in blessing touch each head,
And Angels by his prayer are led:
?Chum, Chum, with a Chum, Chum,
Chum, Chum, Chum.?
In arm-chair, then, he has his smoke;
He takes life as a real good joke;
He falls asleep like most old folk,
Then to God in Heaven these words are spoke
?Chum, Chum., with a Chum, Chum,
Chum, Chum, Chum.?
AUSTRALIA.
Midst of all the Ocean?s standing,
Queen of a myriad Isles;
The stars great deeds demanding,
Cheered by the Sun?s love smiles.
And so in History?s pages
Will prove the noblest Race.
(A fragment of the original Ode.)


THE LOVE OF AUSTRALIA,
I love them that love Me,
Those who Jove me true,
I love those that love Me,
Yes, I truly do!
I love them that love Me,
Those who love me true,
Who take, and fence, and ti ! l Me,
And seed me through and through
I love them that love Me,

Who hold, and grass, and stock me,
And life me as is due.

Who road, and rail, and bridge me,
And wire me through and through
I love those who love Me,
Those who love me true,
Who deepen, dam, and stream me,
Dock, wharf, and boat me too.
I love them who love Me,
Those who love me true,
Who city, park, and street me,
And build me high, so new!
I love them who> love Me,
Those who love me true,
Who bush, and true, and prune me.
And with best fruits endue.-
I love them that love Me,
Those who love me true.
Who walk, or ride, or fly me,
Yes, those who crowd me?You!
