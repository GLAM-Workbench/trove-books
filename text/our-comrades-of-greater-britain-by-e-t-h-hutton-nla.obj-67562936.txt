? OUR COMRADES OF GREATER BRITAIN ?
By Colonel E. T. H. Hutton, C.8., A.D.C. to the Queen,
Hon. Colonel of the New South Wales Regiment of Mounted Rifles
and late Commanding the Military Forces of New South Wales.
The Chairman, in introducing the Lecturer, said : ?The absence of His Eoyal
Highness the Duke of Connaught from taking the chair to-day, through serious
indisposition, cannot be sufficiently deplored, not only by ourselves but by the
Lecturer, and last, but not least, by those interested in the cause and object tor
which we have met here to-day, which is an endeavour to show how closely we
are in combination with our brother British subjects all over the Empire. I need
say no more now, but introduce to you ?although that is here at Aldershot hardly
necessary?the Lecturer, Colonel Hutton, who has lately returned, as you all know,
from the command of the New South Wales Military forces.
? It is the secret sympathy,
? The silver link, the silken tie.
? Which heart to heart, and mind to mind,
? In body and in soul can bind.? ? Scott,
I. ?Prefatory.
My Lord, Ladies, and Gentlemen, ?It was with no small amount
of pleasure that I accepted the invitation of the Council of
the Aldershot Military Society to deliver one of the first of their
series of Winter Lectures 1896-97. I would remind you that this
Society came into being under the aegis of General Sir Archibald
Alison, in June, 1887, and in spite of many predictions to the contrary
it has steadily increased in the number of its members, and has con-
tinued to enlarge its sphere of usefulness. The Library founded by
the late Prince Consort has increased from 2527 to volumes.
The Society has by its lectures been the means of ventilating many
of the leading military topics of the time, and of giving practical
solution to many questions of vital interest to the soldier. It is
gratifying to think of the excellent work which this Society has
done and is doing, since I had the honour to be its Honorary Secre-
tary and Treasurer for the first five years of its existence.
It has been rightly urged that this Society has taken a prominent
part in bringing forward many of the leading military questions of our
time. I could also speak of the influence which your Society possesses
even in such distant parts of the empire as Australia. Throughout
the empire Aldershot is looked to as the centre of the pi actical and
of the tactical training of Her Majesty?s troops. As, therefore, the
practical and the tactical element of military progress is centered in
the Aldershot School of Training, so should the Aldershot Military
Society be the exponent of that intellectual growth and development


of military thought which must be the precursor of all progress. I
feel from personal conviction that the responsibility involved by
Aldershot being regarded as the practical and theoretical centre of
military intellectual activity is only gauged at its real importance by
a lengthened stay in a responsible position in a distant part of the
Empire, such as it has been my privilege to hold very recently in
Australia.
Allow me, therefore, to thank His Royal Highness and the Council
for the honor which they have done me, and permit me also to
congratulate the Society upon its success in the past ten years, and
to express the earnest hope that it may continue its valuable work in
the future, not being content to follow in the wake of other nations,
but to lead the van of Military Progress and Military Efficiency.
I have selected as the title of my lecture one with which modern
writers have made us all so familiar. ? Greater Britain,? as an
expression, conveys to us all something of the vastness and something
of the similarity of national feeling and of national instinct which
permeates the whole empire alike, whether within the arctic zone of
Canada, in the upland plains of South Africa, or in the vast pastures,
plains, and goldfields of Australia. I have further associated the
expression ? Greater Britain ? with the words ? our comrades.?
It is my anxious wish to bring forcibly before you what we doubt-
less all acknowledge, but what is so seldom publicly urged, that we
soldiers, whether English, Scotch, Irish, Canadians, Africanders, or
Australians, are alike portions of one great whole. We together form
that power in the British Empire which is called the British Army,
and we all claim as an equal birthright the name of ?British soldier.?
My object in giving this lecture before your Society is to bring
forcibly to your notice the developmentof our Empire, its vast resources,
and the military power of Greater Britain of to-day, and to contrast
this with what existed a quarter of a century ago. I will endeavour
to do so without wearying you by a wilderness of statistics, but it is
necessary to my object that I should recapitulate on this head some
interesting facts, the majority of which are probably known to many
of you. I propose also to show some of the difficulties which encompass
the military systems outside the United Kingdom, and especially in
those of our Colonies having responsible Government. After which
I will endeavour to point out some of the necessities that govern the
maintenance of a military system; and lastly, I will endeavour to show
that the true principle of defence is offence, and that it is this principle
which has influenced in a large measure, and will influence in the
future to a far greater degree, those great statesmen, soldiers, and
sailors, who have together built up this vast Empire such as we see
it to-day, and who are resposible for its maintenance.
II. ? Rise and Military Power of our Colonies.
In considering the rise of our Colonies during the last 25 years
there can be no simpler method than to invite your attention to the


comparative schedule which I have prepared from official and other
sources, showing the increase in population, trade, revenue, military
(or defence) expenditure, and finally in the number of troops available.
I would beg you to note that although our Colonies have increased
their expenditure for defence purposes in something approaching the
same ratio that the revenue has increased during the last quarter of
a century, still the extra-ordinary disproportion of expenditure per
head of population between that of our Colonies and that of the
Mother Country is sufficiently startling. For example, taking the
average in the Australian Colonies, the expenditure upon defence is
approximately 2s. 9d. per head, while in the United Kingdom it is
9s. Id. for military defence alone, and adding the naval vote it
becomes 17s. 4d. Though it is obviously necessary in young countries
that all possible capital should be devoted to their development and
to trade, it remains a question whether our Colonies might not in all
reason devote a larger share of their fast increasing wealth to their
own defence, and to their share in the defence of that Empire upon
whose wealth, security, and maintenance their commercial and
national status so largely depends. It is a question whether our
Colonies fully realize the advantages in defence alone which they
derive from their connection with the Mother Country, and whether
they maintain a fair proportion of the burdens of taxation which the
maintenance of the Empire imposes upon the population of the United
Kingdom.
Taking the three great groups of our Colonies, I will endeavour to
submit some interesting subjects for reflection in connection with the
military forces of each, viz.: ?(1) Canada; (2) South Africa; (3)
Australasia.
The military forces of our Colonies generally are divided into three
portions, viz.:?Permanent or Regular Troops ; Militia, or ? Partially
Paid;? Volunteer; to which should also be added armed Police. The
first are relatively few in number, well paid, and on the whole highly
efficient. They are very properly utilized for specialist work in
connection with the branch of the Army to which they belong,
and for instructional purposes. The Militia, or as they are some-
what misnamed in Australia, the ? Partially Paid troops,? are
closely analogous to the Militia of the United Kingdom, and serve
under somewhat similar Acts of Parliament. The system of training
is, however, different, in that the men have the opportunity given
them to attend a defined number of drills at convenient times
during the year, either for one whole day, or half a day at a
time, for which they receive certain rates of pay. A period of
continuous training is not necessarily part of the yearly system of
training. Musketry is also carried out in a similar manner. The
Volunteers are similar to those of the United Kingdom, and serve
under somewhat similar Acts of Parliament. They receive from
Government a capitation grant in return for a certain number of
drills, which provides them with uniform, &c.


The same difficulty is felt in our Colonies as regards the professional
knowledge and practical instruction of the officers, especially of the
senior officers, that we are so familiar with in the United Kingdom.
Little difficulty is experienced in reaching a certain standard oï¿½
excellence as regards the rank and file, but a very serious difficulty is
encountered with the officers. Schools of instruction for each branch
of the service have been established in Canada and some of the
Colonies of Australia, but no amount of theoretical instruction in
a school can compensate for the lack of field training which is so
unfortunately wanting in most of the Colonies.
One serious defect in organization is, however, common with a
few exceptions to our Colonies: their military forces are for the most
part limited to a certain number of Infantry, Artillery, and Cavalry
or Mounted Rifles, while the administrative departments, without
which an Army is useless for field service, in many cases do not even
exist, or in others are in such minute proportion as to be of small
value. If the modern system of defence is to be one of offensive-
defensive operations, the military forces of our Colonies who will
have to take the field must possess a complete military system and
organization, and cannot rest content with a number of disconnected
fragments, more or less well trained, without the requisite proportion
of all arms and without those administrative departments which are
indispensable to the maintenance of an army in the field however
small in numbers. With the exception of one of the Australian
Colonies, and perhaps two, a military force, as a complete military
unit of organization, does not exist.
ï¿½ >?
The Dominion op Canada. ?Canada possesses a total Defence
force of 35,288, and has, moreover, a ballot system which in war
renders the whole male population liable for military service between
the ages of 20 and 40. The troops are almost entirely Militia with a
nucleus only of Permanent or Regular Troops.
Having a frontier of 2,800 miles, Canada is of all portions of the
Empire the most exposed to invasion. Her geographical position
renders her most vulnerable to any aggressive movement coming from
our neighbours and kinsmen of the United States. Bound as Canada
is to the United States by peculiarities of kinship and of commercial
intimacy, it cannot be disguised that serious menaces have been made
in the past which may or may not some day be followed by acts of
open war. Ko more interesting problem presents itself to the
British student of war than how best to defend Canada and its long and
exposed frontier line. As recently as December last, following upon
President Cleveland?s message, the American press teemed with pro-
posals as to the quickest and most effective way of invading and over-
running Canada. Plans of the probable area of warlike operations and
the plan of campaign were published in many of the leading news-
papers, especially in the AUestern States, where a veritable wai frenzy
seems to have seized the population. The probabilities of success in the


possible campaign with Canada and the British empire were widely
discussed.
However much we must deplore such an eventuality, we have to
look facts in the face, and there is no question but that had the
British empire been involved in war, the successful defence of Canada
would, in the first instance, have entirely depended upon the rapid
mobilization of the Canadian Militia and their power of rapidly taking
the field. It is doubtful whether an organization complete in all the
essentials of its administrative departments exists, which would admit
of a rapid concentration of the Canadian Army, and of offensive-
defensive operations being undertaken without many weeks of pre-
paration.
In this consideration it is interesting to note that the proportion of
taxation for defence per head is only Is. 3d. in Canada, less than any
other colony, and half that of the average of the Australian Colonies.
The Colonial troops of Canada have twice taken part as such in
military operations, viz., in the Red River expedition under Lord
Wolseley in 1870, and again in the North-West Provinces against
the rebel Riel, under Sir Frederick Middleton, in 1885. In both
campaigns did the Canadian troops acquit themselves well. ? I can
say without flattery,? wrote Lord Wolseley in his final order in 1870,
? that I have served with many armies in the field, but I have never
been associated with a better set of men.?
South Africa.. ?It is somewhat difficult at this juncture to allude
to the Military Forces belonging to the Cape Government, inasmuch
as it is understood that it is contemplated to very considerably add
to them. It has been stated that a Militia system not unlike that
existing in Australia may be adopted. Up to 1894 it will be seen
from the schedule accompanying this paper that the available force
is put at 8,000 men. Of this number about 1,500 are permanent
troops including police (for the most part mounted), approximately
3,500 Militia of the partially paid type, including Mounted Rifles,
Horse Batteries, Field Artillery, Infantry, and the balance are
Volunteers.
The Colony of Natal possesses a military force, including Mounted
Police, of about 1,800, with a Field Battery. The larger proportion
are mounted. In close proximity as Natal is to the older Colony of
the Cape, and identical as are their interests, no common system of
defence seems to exist between them, nor are their military forces
organized with any regard to mutual support, whether from foreign
aggression or from native risings.
There is no part of the Empire which is richer in fighting material
than the British Colonies in South Africa. The frequent wars with
the natives, the pursuit of game large and small, the constant
struggles with the physical difficulties of the country, and the fine
climate, contribute to the maintenance and cultivation of those sturdy
qualities of the Anglo-Saxon race from which the best soldiers are


made. The mounted troops are especially good, and ai-e of their
kind, in quality and physique, only equalled by the mounted troops of
Australia.
Considering the magnitude of the area of country administered by
the Cape Government, the preponderating size and importance of the
native tribes, and the security of the Colony generally, it does not
seem that the sum of Is. lOd. per head of population is a proportionate
charge for defence, and though this amount is greater than Canada, yet
it is only slightly larger than that borne by the remote little island of
Tasmania.
Natal, on the other hand, having so recently as 1879 experienced
all the menace of a Zulu invasion and of Boer aggression, and having
within its borders a very large and vigorous native population, pays
4s. Id. per head. Natal doubtless is alive to the dangers that
surround her, but yet she pays less for her own defence than distant
New South Wales, and has, in addition, the advantage of a garrison
of Imperial troops.
Australasia. ?The Colonies of Australia have always been keenly
alive to the importance of their own defence. Remote as Australia
was in the past from any possible military assistance her colonies
have always assumed the responsibility of such isolation, and have
in this respect acted with sound judgment. The Volunteer movement
which was resuscitated in the United Kingdom in 1859 found an
echo in the young Colony of New South Wales, and ever since that
date a defence force has been maintained.
Each of the Colonies now possesses a military force organized and
maintained upon the lines already alluded to, viz.: ?(1) A nucleus
of permanent or regular troops, chiefly Artillery; (2) Militia or
partially paid ; (3) Volunteers. There exist in addition Rifle Clubs in
nearly all the principal towns, which receiving some concessions in
the way of subsidy from Government, have a varying proportion of
their members enrolled for military service when necessary.
The number of troops possessed by each Colony will be seen upon
reference to the schedule. The six Australian Colonies together
possess a force of 18,700 troops, while New Zealand owns 7,400.
Most of the Colonies have adopted a system of organization and a
scheme of defence somewhat similar in character, which provides for
the local security of the naval bases and important commercial
harbours, while it leaves the balance available for offensive-defensive
purposes.
At the instigation of the Government of New South Wales, Military
Conferences were held at Sydney in October, 1894, and in January,
1896, to which a complete scheme of Australian Federal Defence was
submitted by the same Colony. This scheme was fully discussed,
elaborated still further, and then finally agreed to. The offensive-
defensive troops available from each Colony after providing for local
defence ai*e by this scheme converted into a federal force, available


for the defence of Australia. This carefully elaborated scheme com-
mended itself in principle to the Premiers of the Australian Colonies
in January, 1895, and again in March, 1896, and there seems reason
to hope that the military defence of Australia, based upon this sound
and economical military policy, will ere long be publicly adopted.
An easy and effective step towards the much desired federation of
Australia will be thus made, which upon the principle of natural
evolution will, it is hoped, be followed ere long by federation upon
the larger issue.
The Australian Governments have not lost sight of the importance
of arranging for the mobility of a portion of their troops, and attempts
by all the Colonies have been made, successful in some, partly
successful in others, to have the proper proportion of each arm com-
plete, with the necessary administrative departments.
The defence of JSTew Zealand must, under the existing circum-
stances, be considered as apart from that of Australia. The problem
of defence which it presents by reason of its extended coast line, its
numerous harbours, and the disjointed character of its settlements
and of its various islands, is a very difficult one. The fighting quali-
ties of its troops, if trained under a sound system and organized upon
a. definite scheme of defence, are undeniable. The effect of protracted
Maori wars has not passed away; but at the same time it is doubtful
if the scattered and disjointed Military Forces of the Colony are
organized and administered at the present time in the most
economical and the most effective manner.
111.?Difficulties Under Which our Comrades Labour.
Though the difficulties which affect our comrades of Greater
Britain are not altogether dissimilar from those which try our patience
and tax our perserverance in the United Kingdom, they are, by
reason of the smallness and the remoteness of the various communities,
seriously enhanced. These difficulties may be briefly summarized as
follows : ?(ï¿½) The absence of - a continuous and fixed policy of
defence ; ( b ) the difficulty of popularising military service ; (<;) narrow
ideas and prejudice ; ( d ) political interference, and personal influence.
(a) I place the want of a continuous or fixed policy of Defence as
the first and most serious of these difficulties. Governments change
far more rapidly in our self-governing Colonies than at home, and
the fluctuating changes of policy, and the vicissitudes experienced in
passing the military estimates through Parliament, render it im-
possible to look forward from one year to another, or even from one
month to another, with any degree of certainty. It requires no
demonstration to show how difficult it is to inspire enthusiasm and
maintain military efficiency when not only the maintenance of each
and every member of the force, but even of the force itself, is a
subject of yearly uncertainty when the military estimates are submitted
to Parliament.
The want of a continuous policy of defence is an additional and most
detrimental factor to the success of any military system ; it is, however,


a drawback which is incidental, it would seem, to a monarchical or
constitutional form of Government. The difficulty, great as it is felt
to he in Great Britain, is greater still in that Greater Britain beyond
the seas, where the countries having responsible governments are
infinitely less in magnitude, but are far more subjected to fluctuating
political views, often of the most opposite character.
The varying conditions, and the ever progressive changes of
military institutions, and above all of the principles of military
defence, make it hard indeed for our remote Colonies to keep pace.
That admirable military writer, Mr. Spencer Wilkinson, reminds us
very rightly that with our grandfathers ?the great idea was the
machine ; with us it is the organization.? It is this very organization
which is the most difficult of all to complete, when the money upon
which its creation must depend is a varying factor.
( b) Our military systems throughout the Empire are based upon a
voluntary military service. This system must depend for its success
either upon the popularity of the military service, or upon some great
national danger which forces the necessity of such service upon the
public sentiment. The latter condition has never, except in minor or
isolated instances in outlying parts of our Empire, become a necessity
in our day, and please God we may never have a national emergency
which will compel us to adopt a system of compulsory service.
The necessity, however, for popularizing our military service in
order to make our voluntary system possible, is a present and con-
stant source of anxiety in our Colonies no less than in the United
Kingdom. This difficulty becomes all the greater in those Colonies
where no immediate or apparently pressing reason seems to exist
necessitating a military force.
There is undoubted truth in the statement that there exists in the
Anglo-Saxon race an antipathy to military service, and especially
to a standing army, which is not altogether accounted for by the fact
that the soldier is the bugbear to the political agitator, and the
emblem of law and order to the disturber of the public peace. The
unpopularity of the Army, and the resentment of military interference
in all public movements, are probably traceable to the wars of the
17th century. The feelings engendered by the excesses of the
Royalists on the one side, and the high-handed treatment experienced
at the hands of the Covenanters on the other, have never passed away,
and may be held accountable in a large measure for this national
instinct of dislike. The existing strong democratic feelings grafted
upon this old Engish animosity tends to make any military system in
some measure distasteful to the popular feelingin our Colonies. It is im-
possible to ignore this popular prejudice, and it is a difficulty requir-
ing much care and delicacy of handling to overcome. It becomes, there-
fore, one of the most difficult tasks in our Colonies to bring home to the
public mind the necessity for the maintenance of a military force without
creating a feeling of uneasiness, and at the same time to popularize the
military service without jeopardizing discipline or efficiency.


(c) A difficulty which is ever present to all our Colonial military
systems is that narrow ideas and ignorant prejudice are at least as
difficult to overcome in Greater Britain as they are in the Mother
Country. It is a peculiarity shared by all armies in common that
soldiers resent all change, and are as a class the most conservative of
humanity. This peculiarity is perhaps increased in proportion to the
distance that lies between the hub and the extremities of the military
wheel.
( d ) Perhaps one of the most dangerous and sinister effects of con-
stitutional Government in our Colonies is the ever recurring tendency
on the part of individual members of the Legislature to interfere for
various reasons with the working of and with the personnel of the
military machine. It is the not unnatural result of the franchise that
individuals should endeavour to bring to bear parliamentary influence
to overrule military regulations which are found to be irksome or detri-
mental to the interests of themselves, or of their friends, and even to
press for advancement on electoral grounds. The effect of such a system
must from its nature he to sap at the very roots of discipline, and to sow
discord and dissension throughout the force where it exists. The
expression borne upon the winds from the Crimea, ? Take care of
Dowb,? has sometimes found an echo in places beyond the seas.
Pernicious as such a system must be in any country, it becomes
doubly so in small communities where everyone?s actions are known
and criticised, and where unfair motives for acts and words are often
too unjustly ascribed.
IV.?The Necessities Governing the Maintenance of our
Comrades in each of our Colonies.
In the sense of self-preservation defence is an instinct which the
human race shares in common with the brute creation, and its
demonstration would be futile. It is, however, germane to my object
to remind you that our Comrades of Greater Britain are equally, if not
more, alive to the vast importance of defence in the maintenance of
their own and our commercial security, than even the people of England.
All thinking men must fear that a recurrence is possible at no distant
date of those conditions which drove the old country into war, and
which rendered the struggles of the earlier Georgian period a question
of life and death of England. During our long rest of 80 years from any
great life struggle other nations have been pressing in our wake, and
the British Empire has once more neighbours and rivals in all parts of
the globe. No subject of Her Majesty, worthy of a hearing, desires
aggression on this account, but equally every man who understands
the situation knows that the day may at any moment break when we
must keep by the sword what we have gained by the sword. It has
been recently said by one of our ablest statesmen that Imperial
Defence is only another name for the protection of Imperial
Commerce,? and we generally hear it argued that our commercial
supremacy is due to our naval supremacy ; but we should bear in mind
that the converse is even still more true, and that our commercial


supremacy, born of our policy at the commencement of this century,
now enables ns to grasp more firmly than any nation has ever done
in any previous age the proud sceptre of naval supremacy. Certainly
if two centuries ago it was found impossible to let trade follow
another flag, when our population was small, and commerce compara-
tively insignificant, it is more important and still more incumbent
upon us now, and in the future, to maintain our vast commercial
interests, and retain the existing markets for our produce and
manufactures. The British Empire must be prepared to find her
commercial supremacy and her monopoly of the sea challenged some
day. From the precedents of the past, which our comrades beyond
the seas study no less closely than we, it may be fairly inferred that
we shall have to fight in order to guard, as we have had in the past
to fight in order to acquire. This is not the spirit of bluster or pride
which has been deservedly stigmatised as ? Jingoism;? it is a national
purpose, it is a national and indeed a natural instinct of self-
preservation !
Facilities of communication, steam and electricity have brought
all our Colonies, even distant Australia, upon the arena of old world
strife. No portion of the vast Empire owing allegiance to the Queen
can now remain unconcerned in the active movements of the world,
and in the problems still lying hid in the womb of the future.
Admiral Colornb, not long ago, in a lecture before the United
Service Institution, insisted with great emphasis upon the proposition
that the duty of defence is common to both the Army and the Navy,
and that although each has its specific share, the relative force and
employment of one cannot be determined without regard to the
corresponding force and employment of the other. This principle
is now generally accepted as an axiom of any system for the defence
of our Empire ; but many leading soldiers and sailors agree in
thinking that joint action between the Army and Navy over a
world-wide field of operations has never yet been adequately or
authoritatively considered. It is certain that no practical solution of
this problem has ever yet been enunciated as a basis upon which the
preservation of the Empire may safely rest.
It seems clear, however, that the principle has now been accepted
that the people of Great Britain and Ireland are prepared to maintain
the Naval element in the defence of our Empire, if we except
the contribution of our Australian Colonies. Though the wisdom
of this policy has practically been always accepted this principle
has only recently been made public. Had it been earlier made clear
much public money in our Colonies might have been spared to more
important purposes, and the melancholy sight of war vessels for local
defence now lying idle in some of the distant parts of our Empire
might have been obviated.
The share of defence allotted to our Comrades of Greater Britain is
thus confined to a military defence, except indeed where a purely
local naval defence as an auxiliary to the military defence is required


for the security of certain harbours and for the control of seagoing
traffic in time of war within the military defences. The principle
governing the organization of this military force and its requirements
will be dealt with later.
The necessity for maintaining a military force in our Colonies may,
however, be based upon other and equally important grounds. Military
service it is which teaches to a people the sacred and solemn duty involved
by the defence of one?s country. It is military service which inculcates
the practice of self-denial, and that discipline and subordination of mind
andbody which are necessary in orderto discharge that duty. Something
more than various forms of sport, whether cricket, hunting, or racing, is
required to educate a nation in those manly qualities which are vital
to the well-being of any great people. It is the possession of these
qualities which have given us our freedom and free institutions, and
it is by them that we must maintain our birthright. It has been
said that the torch of Liberty was lighted at the altar of Religion;
it is at any rate certain that the qualities required to keep alight
that torch must be hallowed by the highest attributes which make a
noble and a great people. It is a fact often lost sight of in England,
that the creation and maintenance of the Militia and Volunteer force
is important, aye, and vital, to the interests of this Empire, not only
for the defence it affords, but for the education it provides for the
people of this country in military exercises, in self-denial, and in
discipline of mind and body. The defence of our country is a sacred
duty and a national privilege. It is not one which can be relegated
to a mercenary army, without serious detriment to the highest and
best national instincts. History tells us that once quench the warlike
spirit in a nation that nation dies. Hence the importance of our
Volunteer force as a national educator of the principle of the sacred
duty of national defence. It was Bacon, in 1612, at the birth
of naval power, who said, ? Above all for empire and greatness it
importeth most that a Ration do profess arms as their principal
honour, study, and occupation . . . . Ro nation which does not
directly profess arms may look to have greatness fall into their
mouths.? ?We may not be a military nation,? said the Iron Duke,
? but thank Giod we are a warlike people,? and long may we remain
so !
In England the national obligation of maintaining an adequate
army is forced upon our intelligence; we have across the streak of
silver sea 20 millions of men armed and organized for war; we have
had immediately at our doors as lately as 1871 all the horrors of war;
and the experiences of the 18th and early 19th century wars are not
yet forgotten. In most of our distant possessions, however, such
influences are less powerful, notably so in Australia, and the necessity
for maintaining a military spirit is not equally obvious. The old warlike
influence may perhaps slumber, but at least it must not be allowed to
sleep, lest we cease to be what our forefathers made us. This indeed
forms one of the most important reasons which govern the main-


tenance of our Comrades in Greater Britain, though it is one which
is not generally accepted, and it is certainly one which many would
only too gladly ignore.
Y. ? Best Defence is Offence.
It has been held by military and naval commanders, as well as
proved by the study of history, that in the case oï¿½ England in the
past the surest and best defence has been a vigorous offence. It has
always been held that if warlike operations for defensive purposes were
necessary to be undertaken they should be forced upon England?s
enemies and fought out upon other than English soil. During the
last 150 years five distinct threats ot? invasion have been made by
England?s enemies. In each instance England did not remain satisfied
with preparations for a passive defence but followed these by a
vigorous and successful offence.
First, in 1744 and 1745, France, taking upon herself the
championship of the Stuarts, endeavoured to enforce the claims of
the Jacobite cause. Hot only did Great Britain defend herself by
force of arms but by a vigorous offensive she carried her military
activity into North America and India simultaneously, and captured in
the one the Island of Cape Breton, in the other she annexed Pondi-
cherry and Madras, thus laying the foundation of our Indian Empire.
Secondly, in 1759, France threatened to invade England, an attempt
which Great Britain replied to by renewed military exertions in the
eastern and western hemispheres so vigorous and so well timed that
they gave us Quebec, and Montreal, and Canada in North America;
Guadeloupe, Martinique, Grenada, and St. Lucia in the West Indies ;
and the province of Goree in the Indian Peninsula.
Thirdly, in 1779, the French and Spanish combined to plot a joint
invasion of our country. Our answer was the strengthening of
Gibraltar and the re-establishment of our naval power in the
Mediterranean as a counterfoil and menace to the French.
Fourthly, in 1797-98, the French Republic threatened an invasion
of the shores of Great Britain, and in 1798 an expedition actually
landed in Ireland. Great Britain retaliated by a military expedition
in the following May, which destroyed the sluice gates of Ostend,
and in rapid succession followed the capture of Malta, the Battle
of the Nile, and the conquest of Egypt.
Fifthly, in the memorable years 1804-5, Napoleon made his great
and final effort to destroy England?s power by an invasion upon a mag-
nitude and organized with a completeness that is sometimes forgotten.
This was defeated, as we all know, by the vigilance and excellence of
our Navy, and our supremacy at sea was finally established by the
Battle of Trafalgar. The command of the sea having been thus
indisputably assured we were enabled to invade Portugal and Spain, and
eventually upon the field of Waterloo to lay the foundation of our
present greatness and prosperity; thus for the remainder of the
19th century an invasion of our shores by foreign foes has been
effectually prevented.


The great principle of an offensive-defensive policy thus indicated
as appropriate to the defence of the Mother Country itself is applicable
in a similar degree to ocean-girt Australia, and indeed to the great
peninsula of South Africa also. Canada alone, with a widely extended
frontier coterminous with the United States, must be influenced by a
somewhat different role.
It has been continually urged and requires no demonstration to
show that the war policy of Great Britain must be governed by our
power at sea. The sea, like an ever constant highway, binds all the
fragments of our empire into one, and makes possible the combinations
of all sections of our empire into one integral whole. It enables us to
carry out the policy of defence by offence which, as I have endeavoured
to show, has always been and must always remain the only successful
defence policy of the British empire.
Having these principles in view the defence of our Great Colonies
resolves itself into two parts, one which shall provide a passive
defence of an adequate nature for those harbours and strategical centres
necessary for local security to trade and for the maintenance of the
supremacy of our fleet at sea, and the other which shall enable an
offensive-defensive policy to be undertaken whenever necessitated by
political events.
It has been already stated that our comrades at the antipodes are
in a fair way to accept a system of co-operative defence founded
upon these principles which might, it is thought, be applicable for
general adoption.
It will be interesting, therefore, to note the main points upon which
the Scheme of Australian Federal Defence is framed
(1) A defence scheme based upon a common ground of policy.
(2) A Military Defence Act common to each of the Colonies, which
shall enable its forces to serve within a certain defined area for the
mutual protection of all.
(3) An organization suited to the defence policy, which shall adapt
the military forces at present existing in each colony to the general
scheme of defence referred to above, and which shall none the less
leave the identity of each of the Colonies troops intact as at present,
and during peace available for purely local requirements.
It is proposed that the six Australian Colonies shall carry out this
system in peace so that in time of war a properly trained and organic-
ally sound military machine will be at hand ready for whatever
military operations may be indicated by joint agreement of the
Colonies.
It is further proposed that a Council of Federal Defence represent-
ative of the Colonies concerned shall assemble occasionally for
consultative purposes during peace, but in war or national emergency
this Council shall by joint arrangement between the Colonies assume the
administrative direction of the Federal force then mobilized, and elect
a military commander, thus constituting a species of Committee of
Public Safety.


Such a system will at least insure the adoption of one defence
policy, one uniform organization and equipment, and one system of
training. It will further insure the means being ready at hand for
carrying out effectively a common system of defence when a national
emergency suddenly bursts upon Australia,
The scheme, therefore, which has commended itself to the Australian
Colonies is based upon the principle that without adding to the exis-
ting military forces each Colony shall possess one portion allotted to
passive or purely sedentary defence, being the effective protection of
commercial centres, and naval and strategical bases, while the other
is allotted to offensive-defensive operations, and is liable to be moved
to any portion of Australia or within the area described as Australian
waters when required for the defence of Australian shores. This
offensive-defensive force becomes the Federal force of Australia
and is apportioned to each Colony in proportion to population. The
Fedei al force thus created by joint co-operation of the Australian
Colonies comprises a complete Mounted Brigade and a complete
Infantry Division, each being provided with the proper proportion of
administrative and departmental troops, so as to be able to take the
field at the shortest notice. This military system is formed without
the addition of a single penny to the military estimates of each
Colony, and by merely utilizing the existing military establishments.
A ceitain influential body of those who are pressing Imperial
Federation seek to bind all portions of the empire hand and foot to
one given policy both of defence and of finance. Attractive as this
may seem, a sojourn in our Colonies, even of short duration, will soon
demonstrate the impossibility of such a system being accepted by the
majority of our fellow subjects of Greater Britain. The Premier of
New South Wales put the popularly accepted view of this question
be!ore the Australian public in his usually forcible and eloquent
language:?
My belief, said he, ?in the future of the British Fmpire is not
derived from schemes of this or that kind of Imperial Federation,
but upon the kinship of the peoples which make up the British race.
Just as the sons who go from the parental home are still an abiding
strength of union and fellowship to the parents, so do the Australian
Colonies, if allowed to remain situated as they are and with their
relations to the old country as they are, become as strong a bulwark
as if they had some grand new complex Act of Parliament called an
Act of Imperial Federation, which might smother their generous
alliance, chill their affectionate ideas, and sow the seeds of distrust
and quarrel.?
Those who, like myself, have had peculiar facilities for knowino*
the real feeling existing in our Australian Colonies can alone realize
the depth of loyalty and generous affection for, and pride in, the old
country. England, throughout Australia, is always known and spoken
of as l> Home,? and with that word are embraced all that makes a
Home dear to the distant members of a family. Entwined,however,


with this deeply rooted loyalty for and love to the old country, is that truly
British love of liberty and that freeborn and independent spirit which
resents an injury and brooks no interference ?a spirit which is and
has been for the last three hundred years the heritage of our race.
Overlying all lies that very human failing of self-interest. Having
realized the important influences of loyalty, sentiment, and self-
interest which exist, we shall find it is wisest in the best interests
of the empire to base our schemes upon these and upon the force of
public opinion, which has nowhere in the world so quick and intel-
ligent exponents as in the Australian press.
A co-operative system of defence it is which seems best adapted to
fulfil our objects, such, for instance, as that which I have sketched as
proposed for the five Australian Colonies and Tasmania. A co-operation
based on loyalty to Her Majesty the Queen and to our common country,
upon the sentiment of race and of common birth, and upon self interest.
No one who was not present in New South Wales could realize the
intense, almost frenzied, state of of the public mind when the contin-
gent sailed for Suakim in 1885. It was not the fact of sending seven
hundred men to the shores of the Red Sea to join with British troops
upon a campaign in no way critical that so violently agitated a
peculiarly practical and non-sensational people, but it was the popular
realization of the fact that New South Wales was the first British
Colony to establish that principle of co-operative defence which has
been alluded to. This it was, you may rest assured, which appealed
with such force to our comrades at the antipodes, and I cannot
demonstrate this more forcibly than by quoting the words of that
illustrious man, the Right Honourable W. B. Dailey, then at the
head of the Government of New South Wales, upon the occasion of
the dispatch of the Soudan Contingent in 1885. ? The statesmen who
contemplate disturbance of the world?s peace,? said Mr. Dailey,
?will from this time not limit their calculations so far as England
is concerned to her ironclads and to her armies. They will consider
the rapidly increasing millions of her Colonial subjects, their bound-
less resources of all forms of material wealth, their capacity of swift
and effective oganization for purposes of offence as well as defence,
and above all, their triumphant resolve to stand by the Great Empire
in her troubles, and to spend and be spent in her service. No
ill-considered and uncalculated wars will be engaged in by even the
most reckless of military despots, and our joyful sacrifice will aid the
cause of peace.?
If I have not dwelt upon the existence of the same feeling in other
parts of Greater Britain it is because I am not able to speak with the
same personal knowledge, but the offer of Canada to supply 10,000
men in the troublous times of 1878-79 will always be in our mind.
The no less generous and timely offer of South Africa in the dark
days of financial difficulties in Australia of 1893, to guarantee any
loan which New South Wales might wish to raise, made a profound
impression in the public mind of our Australian comrades.


It seems almost superfluous to remind you of the feeling of the
Australian Colonies, promptly voiced by all the Premiers of the six
Colonies direct to Lord Salisbury upon the 13th January last, aban-
doning, in their determination to emphasise the sentiment, the
official method of transmission through Her Majesty?s representatives
in Australia: ??The Governments of Australia and Tasmania,? ran
the cablegram, ? view with satisfaction the prompt and fearless
measures adopted by Her Majesty?s Government in the defence of the
integrity of the British Empire. We desire to convey to you our
united assurances of loyal support. The people of Australia are in
full sympathy with the determination of the Mother Country to resent
any foreign interference in matters of British and Colonial con-
cern.?
You will recall, also, that the Government of New Zealand cabled ;
? Recent statesmanlike and patriotic conduct of Imperial Government
with reference to the Venezuela and Transvaal Republics has been
such as to intensify loyal sentiments to the Queen of England, making
us prouder than ever to belong to the Empire of Great Britain.?
Prom the Canadian Parliament came the following resolution passed
amid the greatest enthusiasm :?? That in view of the present threaten-
ing aspect of foreign affairs, this House desires to assure Her Majesty?s
Government and the people of the United Kingdom of its unalterable
loyalty and devotion to the British Throne and Constitution, and of
its conviction that, should occasion unhappily arise, in no other parts
of the Empire than in the Dominion of Canada would more sub-
stantial sacrifices attest the determination of Her Majesty?s subjects
to preserve unimpaired the integrity and inviolate the honour of Her
Majesty?s Empire.?
Gentlemen, I think we may say that we are justified in the belief
that we can count upon our Comrades of Greater Britain in our time
of trial, but we may be equally certain we cannot by artificial means
arouse the deep feeling of nationality and brotherhood which breathes
so happily and harmoniously fromourColonies. It is well to beware lest
by endeavouring to forge indissoluble ties, as some would have us do,
we may not be ? substituting the form for the spirit of Brother-
hood.?
VI.? Concluding Remarks.
Before closing my paper I think that you will wish to hear some-
thing of the quality and characteristics of our Australian comrades,
with whom it has been my good fortune to serve for the last three
years. I would preface my remarks by saying that I went to
Australia direct from Aldershot, and from an intimate association,
extending over nearly 13 years, with picked British soldiers, so that
my standard of what British troops should be was such that I was
little likely to overrate my new comrades.
The Australian soldier, like his civilian brothers, is tall and some-,
what lanky, as the soubriquet of ? cornstalk ? would indicate. His
limbs are sinewy, but his chest measurement is considerably less in


proportion to his height than with the English soldier. He is none
the less stalwart, hardy, and of excellent presence.
The Australian seems to he endowed 'by nature with a military
instinct, which must be born in him, since no occasion has yet arisen
in that favoured land calling forth these qualities. This may be
accounted for from the fact that a large section of the population are
descended from military and naval forbears, who in the early days of
the Colony remained and obtained grants of land after their terras
of service had expired. Be that as it may, this military instinct,
added to a quick intelligence improved by a sound national
education, makes it comparatively easy to turn out excellent soldiers
of alt arms. Good as the Infantry and Artillery are, the arm of the
country is undoubtedly the Mounted branch. Ihe Australian is a
horn horseman. With his long, lean, muscular thighs he is more at
home on a horse than on his feet, and is never seen to greater
advantage than when mounted and riding across bush or a- difficult
country. The mounted troops (Cavalry and Mounted Rifles} are
recruited from the small farmers, the stockmen, and boundary riders
who, living in the saddle, seem to take naturally to their militaiy
duties. Fine horsemen, hardy, self-reliant, and excellent marksmen,
they are the beau ideal of Mounted Riflemen, and as such are
the equal, if not the superior, of the best that South Africa can
boast. A contingent of such men as served in the Mounted Rifles
and Lancer Regiment in New South Wales during 1893-96 would be
worth their weight in Westralian gold upon any campaign in which
British troops may be engaged. Accustomed to shift for themselves in
the Australian bush, and under the most trying conditions of heat and
cold, thev would thrive where soldiers unaccustomed to bush life
would die.
It has been said that the weak spot among Australian troops is
discipline. The discipline, evidenced by closed heels, and of Yes
sir,? ?No sir,? may not be exactly that of European armies, but the
real and true discipline, which is the great aim and object of all drill
and military organization, is conspicuous. lam credited with being
a strict disciplinarian, so you will perhaps credit me when I assure
you that throughout the three years I commanded the New South
Wales troops I never heard an insubordinate word or gesture, nor
among the Militia or Volunteers can I recall a single instance of
drunkenness or misbehaviour in camp or otherwise.
This fact, however, is well known to all who have had experience
of the command of our comrades of Greater Britain, or of our own
Militia and Volunteers, that the better and more intelligent the
soldiers the better and more capable must be the officers. If Australian
soldiers, with their quick intelligence and strong individuality, fall
into the hands of weak, ignorant, and incapable officers, not only will
indiscipline supervene but the very individuality I speak of will prompt
the men themselves to take matters into their own hands. In this
respect Australian soldiers are not dissimilar from the finest troops


with whose deeds history has made us familiar, whether we take
the Pretorian Guard of the Caesars, the Janissaries of the Caliphs,
the Ironsides of Cromwell, or the Old Guard of Napoleon.
No man, be he a Cromwell or a Napoleon, could drive Australian
troops, but a strong and capable leader, no matter how strict, could
lead an Australian army to emulate ?aye, and surpass if need be?
the finest and most heroic deeds recorded in the annals of British
arms.
It may seem superfluous to remind you that the expression ? British
Army? includes alike our comrades of Greater Britain as well as all
of you now serving Her Majesty at Aldershot. All soldiers alike
swear the same oath of allegiance to Her Gracious Majesty the
Queen, all officers alike hold commissions from the Queen or by
command from her representatives. As all loyal subjects of the
Queen are British, so are we here and our comrades in Greater
Britain alike British soldiers. The proud deeds and the noble devo-
tion to duty recorded in the annals of the British Army are no less the
proud heritage of us here in Great Britain than they are of our
comrades in that Greater Britain beyond the seas. This at least is
one tie we all have to bind us together, and whether in the near future
our rulers adopt a co-operative system of defence for the Empire or
no, we at least shall always have in common with our comrades of
Greater Britain this proud knowledge that we all alike serve one
Queen, one People, and have one common end in view, the defence of
the Empire and the maintenance of our sovereign rights. The
following eloquent words, spoken by one of the prominent members
of the Canadian Legislature before the Canadian Parliament, not only
echoed the sentiments of our Canadian comrades but may be held to
embody the feeling of the whole of our comrades of Greater
Britain:?
?We want,? said Mr. Alexander McNeil, ?the people of the world
to know that, come what may, in whatever part of the empire they
may happen to reside, the British people are one people, animated by
one spirit, and determined to stand as one man in defence of their
common rights, and in the maintenance of their common interests.
We desire peace before all. We regard war with horror, but we are
prepared to accept it, with all its consequences, come from what
quarter it may, if it be necessary to do so, in order to maintain and
defend the honour and integrity of our own empire.?
I wish to thank His Royal Highness, the President, and the
Council of the Military Society, for the opportunity which has been
given me of testifying to the qualities of our Australian comrades,
the more so as in a recent article in a military magazine un-
warranted aspersions have been made upon the discipline, the military
spirit, and the efficiency of the military forces of the Australian
Colonies.
I wish that time allowed of my giving you some small idea of my
personal experiences during my three years? service in that great


continent. I can only assure you that accustomed as I have been to
command, in the Mounted Infantry, the flower of the British
Infantry, in England and in other parts of the world, during the ten
years immediately preceding my command in New South Wales, I shall
always look back with pride, pleasure, and profit to my association
with my Australian comrades, and shall hear to my grave the
ineffaceable recollection of their excellent military qualities, their zeal,
devotion, and loyalty upon all and every occasion.
In conclusion, I must apologize for the length of my paper. lam
deeply obliged for the privilege you have accorded me in allowing
me to address the Society upon a subject which is so near my heart,
and I am glad of the opportunity which has been given me of
endeavouring, however inadequately, to show what a vast element
of strength Great Britain possesses in our Comrades of Greater Britain.
IF I have succeeded also in assuring you of the deep feeling of loyalty
to Her Majesty and of the genuine affection for the old country which
lie embedded in the hearts of our Colonial brethren, I shall feel that
I have not unjustifiably trespassed upon your time.
DISCUSSION.
The Chairman : In inviting discussion, I would fain hope, seeing that so many
gentlemen of experience in the subject before us have come down from London and
elsewhere to be present at our meeting to-night, that the discussion will prove one
of unusual interest, and one the effects of which will not be limited to Aldershot
alone.
Major-General A. B. Tulloch, C.8., C.M.G. : I am much delighted at being
able to support what my late colleague, Colonel Hutton, has said about the qualities
of the Australian troops ; if possible I have an even higher estimate of those troops
than the lecturer himself. I do not think the people of this country have an
adequate idea of what the people of Australia have done to put themselves in a
state of defence. Reference has been made to the small sum which the Colonies
pav towards defence. Thev pay the amount named because they really cannot
afford to pay a larger one. The population of Australia amounts to four millions,
and they have a public debt of 200 millions, the interest on which is a heavy tax on
the population and leaves thereby a comparatively small amouut for other matters.
A great quantity of gold comes from Australia, but those behind the scenes know
that it is often necessary to put ï¿½2 into the ground to get ï¿½1 out. Considering
their great debt I think the Australian Colonies have done marvellously well
in matters of defence compared with other self-governing colonies ; at different
times I have seen the troops of all of these, though my experience, dating some years
hack, may not now be of much value. I have not been in Canada for many years,
but the report of the late commandant of the Dominion was anything hut satisfactory.
Perhaps matters have improved since. In South Africa there has been much
fighting. I have not been there for twelve years, but we all know that tney still
require a large Imperial garrison, and when anything big in the way of fighting
takes place, strong reinforcements of troops have to be sent from the old country.
When you go further east to Australia you find a very different state of affairs to
those existing in Canada or South Africa; they have no Imperial troops, the colonists
pay a large sum for the maintenance of our fleet, they have fortified their naval
bases, and maintain at their own cost a large force for the defence of those places.
The contingent which went to Suakin has been referred to. From a political
point of view it was magnificent, but as a military expedition it was not a success,
as is well known to those who took part in the operations. Ibe troops were a
scratch pack rapidly embarked and sent away in a hurry. General Richardson


begged and prayed to give him time to organise the force before starting, but that
was not allowed and the natural result followed. The Suakin business was a useful
object lesson to certainly one colony in Australia, viz., that of Victoria, which at the
time fortunately possessed a far-seeing, broad-minded statesman as Minister of
Defence, Colonel, now Sir F., Sargood. He swept away the whole Volunteer system
then existing, substituting for it a paid militia, and to get that force into proper
order he obtained from the Horse Guards the services of certain Imperial officers,
viz., Colonel Disney, Colonel Brownrigg, Colonel Walker, Major Rhodes, Captain
Fellows, and Lieutenant Ind, and right well those officers did their duty. When I
went out five years afterwards, in 1889, to take up the position of commandant, I was
amazed at what I saw. Magnificent battalions drilling with the steadiness and
precision of British soldiers, batteries of field Artillery supplied with the newest
pattern of gun, a field company of engineers thoroughly equipped with wagons and
all appliances for immediate active service. Two fine regiments of mounted rifles,
besides volunteer companies, as guards of the forts. For instructional purposes
magnificent drill halls and storerooms had been built wherever required, and drill
serjeants from the Imperial service engaged. The forts defending the entrance to
Hobson?s Bay were all armed with the latest pattern heavy breech-loading guns,
manned by permanent and militia artillery, and the submarine mining plant and equip-
ment could not be equalled out of England. So impressed was I with the precision
and excellence of the Infantry drill that I considered we might go another step forward
and commence special battle training. We always had a camp of the whole force
during Easter week; at my first camp I tried an attack on a hill with two brigades.
It was not at all well done. I then formed up the brigades and informed them
that on Monday I intended attacking a position with ball cartridge, and that if they
worked as I had just seen them do they would shoot each other freely; but I was
convinced from the precise way in which they drilled on parade that they could do
the attack properly with a two days? preparation. The two days they had were
Saturday and Sunday. The commanding officer worked incessantly during the time
given. The attack was extremely well done on the Monday and no one killed.
What astonished them more than anything was that they, although splendid shots
at ordinary target practice, only made six per cent, when firing at head-and-shoulder
canvas targets at unknown distances. Afterwards I instituted systematic instruction
in battle firing, that is working across country and firing at small targets suddenly
seen at unknown distances. Every company, infantry, volunteer, or mounted
infantry, had to do one or more such battle firing practices every quarter in addition
to the annual course of musketry. This battle firing caught on all over the Australian
Colonies ; the men are rapidly becoming splendid active service shots. I endeavoured
to train the field artillery in the same way, occasionally taking out the field batteries
and a couple of infantry battalions by train 20 miles from Melbourne to attack an
unknown position precisely as if on active service. The artillery found the range
by the bracket system, then advanced to a second and third position. After they
had finished and the artillery taken off, the infantry then attacked in the usual
manner, and the whole force returned to the train and were back in Melbourne
before dark. The nature of the country gave us enormous advantages for carrying
out this work ; possibly in no other country but India could such a system be
attempted. Now I will give you some idea of the discipline of these men. We
had, during a great strike, 600 men under arms for six weeks, and during those six
weeks there were only two military crimes; an old soldier who broke out of
barracks, and an unfortunate recruit who was found asleep on sentry, who, however,
it afterwards appeared, had been twice on such duty in succession. I will give you
another instance in connection with their discipline which shows the grand feeling
of soldier?s honour throughout the force. There was at Ballarat a battalion with
whom the serjeant-major was not popular; some of the recruits one night went
through the town in plain clothes singing, ?We will hang our serjeanf-major on a
sour apple tree.? Courts of enquiry and committees in vain tried to discover the
culprits. I told the minister they must be severely punished, and that if the men
who committed such a serious military crime could not be discovered there was


nothing for it but disbandment of the regiment; if such a military crime were over-
looked discipline would be at an end and the military forces of the colony useless.
There was a great outcry in the papers at my harsh ideas of discipline, but the
minister was firm, and I was given the necessary authority. On the recommendation
of a commanding officer of another regiment I decided to try myself what I could
do. I had the regiment formed up on parade and appealed to the honour ot the
delinquents, as soldiers, tq give themselves up and save the battalion. At first no
one moved, but eventually the men concerned, fifty in number, stepped out. i fined
each of those men ï¿½5, which I afterwards reduced to ï¿½2 10s.; I had already fined
each company ï¿½3OO, besides stopping all drills and parades. Not a single man from
that regiment resigned, and it was ever afterwards one of the smartest on parade ;
a finer battalion is seldom seen at Aldershot. I give you these instances to show
you what kind of men the Australian soldiers are. More enthusiastic soldiers, or
men more easy to command, I never wish to have. The Government listened to
my advice and increased the force so that eventually we had a field force of two
regiments of mounted infantry, one field company of engineers, two brigades ot
militia of three battalions each, one horse artillery and three field artillery
batteries, and as guards of the forts and landing places there were three battalions of
volunteers, rangers, and a 40-pounder battery. At the forts everything was in
readiness; each gun had 200 rounds in the magazine, stores were all filled up even
to tinned provisions. During the Easter week the militia artillery with the permanent
artillery companies, three in number, manned the guns they would have to fight
in action. Each fort was as complete in everything as a man-of-war m commission,
and every man knew his station and was regularly drilled at it The submarine
corps had evervthing in readiness for laying down their work so that in 24 hours i
would have been difficult, and in four days impossible, for any hostile ship to get in.
Mobilization tables had been carefully prepared and everything thoroughly worked
out. Every officer from the rank of captain upwards had a complete mobilization
book in his possession. Every one knew what they would have to do on the or er
to mobilize being sent. The naval force to assist in the defence of the bay consisted
of a double-turreted armour-plated monitor, two gun boats, and several torpedo
boats of the latest pattern. Tbe rising generation were not forgotten, there being ten
battalions of cadets each 500 strong, well drilled, dressed in uniform, anci armed with
small rifles, 16,000 state schoolboys also went through regular courses of drill, i have
gone into all these details to show you how thoroughly the colony of Victoria has
done its duty towards taking its share in the defence of the Empire. When
financial difficulties suddenly pressed down the colony the defence forces had to be
largely reduced, but when matters improve the forces will be increased again. In
1892 the Government of New South Wales requested me to be president of a Royal
Commission for the reorganization of their forces, and not before it was wanted.
One of the principal recommendations of that Royal Commission was that the best
officer who could be spared should be sent out with a staff to put things rig i .
That officer came out, but the ? Spirit of Dowb ? was too strong in New South
Wales, and they would not ask for the necessary staff. You may imagine, therefore,
what a herculean task Colonel Hutton had when he alone took the matter in hand
I think it is a matter for wonder he is alive after the enormous difficulties he must
have had in bringing the New South Wales forces into the admirable condition they
are now. When I left Australia my great wish was that it might be possible tor
him to become the Commandant of both colonies. When he came to see our Easter
camp he met with a very enthusiastic reception ; it was a great grief to myself as well
as the men of the Victorian forces that he could not be the Commandant of the
two united colonies. A federal force is hoped for, but until federation of the
colonies takes place I fear it cannot be carried out. Federation may yet be brought
about, but I regret to say Australians are not very sanguine about their politicians
being able to carry out what is acknowledged would be greatly to the advantage ot
Vice-Admiral P. H. Colomb : I am much struck by the extremely statesmanlike
character of the paper we have just heard read. Lord William Seymour expressed


the hope that the discussion might go beyond Aldershot. lam quite sure this
paper will go throughout the empire. I cannot express to you the strength of my
feelings while hearing it read. You know that I, as a sailor, do not perhaps look
upon the thing from the same point of view as a soldier; but Colonel Hutton is an
old friend of mine and what he says goes thoroughly with my views upon the main
question of the defence of the empire. There are points which one is bound to
criticise if one is asked, but there are few points of disagreement. We notice one most
important feature in the defence of the empire, and that is the difficulty there will be
in the future in apportioning the expense of the maintenance of the different portions
of it. You will find parts little within any line of attack ready to spend money upon
their own defence, while there are other portions quite in the line of attack which have
not the necessary funds or men to carry out the defence which might be required of
them. The difficulty of equalising the financeand personnel of defence is one which
has been brought out very clearly by the lecturer, and one that has struck me more
than usually to-night. Colonel Hutton was good enough to show me after he came
back that much of his work had been, amongst other things, especially the work of
the Committee over which our gallant friend, General Tulloch, presided, and what
was done seems to me almost wholly in the right direction, namely, the limitation
of the immobile troops and the expanding of the mobile troops. The great point is
to have mobile forces, forces that can be collected over a given area and concentrated
upon one single point when necessary. Colonel Hutton spoke also of the main
difficulty, the want of a general principle of defence which can be carried out through-
out the empire. We are much nearer to understanding these principles than we
were ten years ago, but I think it is clear that we are still not at the bottom of it,
and that we want more discussion and thinking before we can get to the bottom of
it. lam obliged to Colonel Hutton for mentioning my views as to the defence of
the empire being a joint naval and military business. It is not here the navy and
there the army ; nor the army after the navy has failed ; it is the army and navy
together ; and unless you have this union in the principle of defence between the
two services you are apt to waste one service or the other. lam afraid that the
United Kingdom does not go quite so far as to say that it is prepared to maintain
the naval defence everywhere. The Imperial Navy is prepared to maintain its
communications, but I doubt whether it understands at present that to it will be
left the carrying out of the naval defence of ports with which it is not itself vitally
concerned. My own belief is that unless there is naval local defence our navy will
have to supply that defence, and the general defence will be weakened in that
degree. Colonial assistance would therefore resolve itself into the keeping of the
ports open and taking care that ships can get in and out, so as to relieve our ships
of that duty. Although the kernel of an understood principle is that the best
defence is offence and has been so frequently used and dwelt upon, I am not quite
sure that the phrase is a good one. lam afraid it leads some to assume that you
can carry on offensive operations before your defence is complete ; but you must first
secure your defence and your communications, and your offensive operations will
come afterwards. I do not think Colonel Hutton is in disagreement with me on
this point. The possibility of heavy attacks on ports must be admitted, such as
heavy forts and garrisons are intended to repel. Such attacks must be mainly by
troops, and I do not think any such attacks can come previous to the fall of the
empire. Before you can have these attacks you must have had your communications
cut and your whole scheme of defence must have broken down ; consequently your
preparations for meeting these heavy attacks should be thrown back, and we should
not use money, men, and energies for meeting these attacks, but rather utilise such
means in preparing the general defence. I mean that a collapse must precede heavy
attacks on ports. It cannot be a condition of war, as far as I understand it, where
the navy can preserve the communications, and at the same time be dependent upon
the military defence for the preservation of its supplies. The navy must preserve
the communications and in so doing preserve access to its supplies. It follows,
therefore, as I said at the beginning, that immobile shut-up forces need to be, in
normal conditions, but small, and that both for the colonies and the mother country.


and throughout the empire, we must be able to mass our mobile forces and be ready
to deal with them as exigencies require. I must congratulate the lecturer on the
wisdom of the policy he has laid down. I cannot help thinking that with the
feeling in the colonies as they now stand it would be impolitic to put pressure upon
them in this matter; and that the time may come when it will be for them to ask
to take a real share in the defence. In the meantime we must go on. as we are.
Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Fergusson, Professor of Tactics, Sandhurst: I should
be very sorry not to add my testimony, after serving with the Colonial troops, to the
efficiency, discipline, and loyalty of those in Australia. When Colonel Hutton
was appointed Commandant of the New South Wales Defence forces, all who knew
him felt that the right man had been selected. He had made his name with
mounted infantry, and that is just the arm to suit the Australians. You heard
what he said about their riding. They ride like centaurs, and are exceedingly
good rifle-shots. Although Ido not think Australians could do much to help the
mother country in other parts of the world, they might raise a valuable contingent
of mounted riflemen, perhaps five to ten thousand, who would do valuable service
anywhere. Colonel Hutton has emphasised the small sum the Australian Colonies
pay towards the general defence, and General Tulloch has given one explanation of
the fact. Another explanation is that in Australia there is no leisured class, and
little idle capital. The whole population might really be called ? working men.?
Although I agree with nearly all that fell from the lecturer, one thing seems open
to misconception. I mean the phrase ?offensive war.? We all know what is
meant by the offensive-defensive. But lam not sure that outside the phrase
would be understood. It must not be supposed that Great Britain has any idea
of engaging in an aggressive war. The motto of the Australian Defence forces is
the same as that of our Volunteers at home ?? Defence not Defiance.? But I
cordially agree with Colonel Hutton that if war were forced upon us, our best
policy would be the carrying on of offensive hostilities. There was another point
which I think ought not to pass without comment, and that was when the lecturer
talked of war with America as possible. It would be a pity if it went forth that
the Aldershot Military Society recognised such a possibility. We ought rather to
adopt the language of the American minister, and decline even to entertain the idea of
such wicked folly as a fratricidal war. Let us rather look forward to the time
when we might fight shoulder to shoulder with America against all the rest of the
world if need be. Colonel Hutton has alluded to the proposal for the federation
of the Australian forces. After spending six years in Australia, I think such
federation is a long way off. The distance between the chief places like Adelaide,
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane are against it (it is 600 miles from Melbourne to
Sydney) and would make it impossible to concentrate a force at any one point in
time to repel an attack; and the break of the gauges on the railways adds to the
difficulty of transporting troops. There are three different gauges on the
Australian continent. I think their r6le is to defend their own territories. But
something might be done in the shape of an uniform system of command, which
would be helped by the establishment of a Military College (such as Canada
has) for the training of officers. The men are splendid material. Ido not believe
you could see a better advance in line, not even by the Marines on Chatham lines,
than that of the Adelaide Rifles, as I remember them (1,700 strong), and their
extended order drill (although we had a normal formation of attack) was as
good as could be seen anywhere. There was one other thing in Colonel Hutton?s
lecture which I thought was most valuable, and that was the fact of the Australian
Colonies contributing towards the support of the navy. lam sure we are on
sound lines in not having independent navies for the Colonies. The attempt
was made in one or two Australian Colonies, but it was not a success. But it
is a sound idea that they should contribute in money towards the expense
of the maintenance of a fleet in those waters, and although the present contribution
is small, the principle is a very valuable one. Colonel Hutton has referred to the
New South Wales troops going to the Soudan. Mr. Dailey was a great friend of
mine, and I think his was a happy inspiration, because it showed the whole world


that we are one united nation, however far severed by distance. Still Ido not
think we can look to large forces coming from Australia to help us in the mother
country ; we must rather depend upon them to protect their own ports. Russia
had a scheme at one time for the invasion of Australia, the details of which leaked
out. We may depend upon the Australians to be ready to repel such an attack,
and destroy any forces which make good their landing.
The Chairman : May I remark that in any further discussion I think it was
Colonel Hutton?s wish not to limit his lecture to Australia, but to the empire all
over the world. I believe it was his intention to invite discussion also for the
whole British empire.
General Sir Richard Harrison, K.C.8., C.M.G.: Ido not wish to detain you
more than a minute or two, but, before I make any remarks on the lecture, I should
like to say how pleased we are to see the lecturer back in this room again. Colonel
Hutton has done more than any other man in pushing forward the Military Society,
and so helping forward the views of the great and far-seeing founder of this library.
In turning to the very able lecture we have heard this evening, I will not follow
Colonel Hutton in his description of the military forces of our colonies or in show-
ing the necessity for the maintenance of such forces in every one of those colonies.
But I should like to say a word or two about what he calls ? the difficulties under
which our comrades labour,? particularly the difficulty of making a scheme of
defence for all or any part of the great empire to which we belong. Personally I
do not think we shall ever build up a satisfactory scheme of defence as long as we
have nothing better than the disjointed system that at present exists. I firmly
believe that the right policy to adopt in the matter would be to establish a great
Imperial Council of Defence that would hold its meetings in London. Such a
council would, I suppose, begin by laying down the strength of the navy, and
determining the numbers and position of its bases of supply. It would also lay
down the principle on which should be fixed the strength and nature of the forces
that we should maintain for offensive purposes, which is the very essence, as every-
one knows, of a defensive system. When these principles were established the
council could proceed to work out details in consultation with the representatives
of the colonies. Lastly, the council would keep the schemes of defence in working
order and would be ready to advise the Governments at home and abroad what they
ought to do for the future. I hope the day will soon come when we shall have
such a council of defence, for I believe that, when we do, it will be the best passible
thing for our empire.
The Lecturer in reply said : General Tulloch has alluded in far too compli-
mentary terms to myself. I may say that my work in Australia was a labour of
love. From the outset I had the support, not only of the troops, but of the people
of New South Wales. I had in my Staff the most loyal support which any general
officer could wish to have ; and I had, moreover, the goodwill, co-operation, and loyal
self-sacrifice of all the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the troops
which I commanded. Any measure of success which attended our joint efforts is
due to our earnest endeavour and determination to give New South Wales the fore-
most place, not excepting Victoria (laughter), which was due to the mother colony
of Australia, in the present Australian Federal Defence movement. It has been
peculiarly gratifying to hear so high an expert authority as Admiral Colomb speak
in such kind terms of the scope of my lecture. He could not have paid mea higher
compliment than by being present to-day at much inconvenience to himself. The
nation owes a great debt of gratitude to Admiral Colomb and several other able writers
on naval matters for pressing the claims of the Navy in the press and elsewhere, and
his views always merit the closest study by soldiers and sailors alike. It may be
assumed from his remarks and from the trend of public opinion that we are within
measurable distance of a satisfactory joint naval and military defence policy. Most
of us soldiers feel that the more the two services are brought together, the better
will be the result of the next great demand upon our defence resources. It is a
question whether the time has not arrived for the two forces to combine together
f6r peace manoeuvres upon some arena in British waters. Military officers wish to be


associated with their naval comrades, and practice m peace the joint ?P er^ 10
which we shall assuredly have to carry out in war. Why should not the Naval
Manoeuvres next year be joint Naval and Military Manoeuvres ? Colonel Fergusson
has alluded to the immense importance of the mounted branches of the Austra lan
troops. I cordially endorse all he says. I haVe indicated in my paper the im-
portant r6le which a mounted Australian contingent might play if properly handle!
in militarv operations, no matter in what part of the world their services mi gi e
enlisted. 'As regards my reference to Canada I can only say that it is the duty ot
us officers to consider the possibilities of war, much as we must all regret them.
In such matters we soldiers cannot allow ourselves to be guided by sentiment
alone. It is satisfactory to hear that Sir Rio'.ard Harrison in his valuable remarks
practically urges as the best system of defence for the empire the very principles
which have been formulated in the schemes of Australian Federal Defence.
These principles I have endeavoured to briefly indicate in the paper which i have
iust read. In conclusion I beg, ladies and gentlemen, to thank you all very
sincerely for the kindly consideration which you have given to my paper and tor
the patience with which you have listened to my concluding remarks. .
The Chairman : It becomes my pleasing duty to ask you for a vote o an s
to the lecturer. His lecture has certainly given effect to a discussion, which has
ranged over Australia, and which I hope will extend to other colonies It has
included from Sir Richard Harrison an excellent suggestion which if it had not
been made by him would have been made by myself. He knows how impossible
it is with the present policy of defence in the colonies to get any satisfactory or
speedv result from the different proposals made by the Colonial Defence
Committee. A certain armament is suggested for, say, King George s Sound.
That proposal, if I remember right, took two-and-a-half-years before it brought
back an answer and got into shape through the Colonial Othce; aud it Sir
Richard Harrison will allow me to go back 33 years in regard to the defence
of Quebec, he will remember how interminable was the time it took to get any
sound results from the proposals made by the commission of which he was
the secretary. In making these references, in returning thanks to the lecturer,
I may say that I am sure the Colonies appreciate very fully the officers we
have sent out at various times, to give suggestions, and place their military
forces in proper organisation. We have heard from General Tu oc , o o
Hutton, and Colonel Fergusson what their difficulties have been They have
made light of them, and have given the greatest praise and honour to the
Colonies ; they have not told you what other people know, that from the com-
mencement of their period of command to the end they have been harder worked
than any Armv Service Corps driver in Aldershot. You have heard Colonel
Hutton speak as to the difficulty of persuading the different political parties what
are their duties in the defence of the Empire. I think one of the speakers
mentioned that we are now in a fair way to get what is required ; at any rate, i am
perfectly certain that nothing could be more advantageous than the proposal ot Sir
Richard Harrison for a joint committee, which will take in not only the colonies,
but include the coaling stations, naval defences, and in fact every measure that
can conduce to the defence of the British Empire. I have to ask you to accord a
C ï¿½Major-General Bkn&OUGH proposed a hearty vote of thanks for Lord William
Se Lorï¿½d U William Seymour in returning thanks said :I do not think we can
separate without expressing our sympathy with the cause which has unavoidably
put me in the chair lam sure His Royal Highness would have got out of bed
and come to this meeting, had his medical advisers allowed him to do so, m order
that he could have taken part in this discussion.
