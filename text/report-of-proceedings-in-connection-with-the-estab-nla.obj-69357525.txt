and Jasons
Most Worshipful Sir and Brother,
I have the honor to inform you
that a number of Lodges of Freemasons holding
Warrants of Constitution under the Grand
Lodges of England,lreland, and Scotland have
formed themselves into an independent Grand
Lodge, under the style and title of the Grand
Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of
South Australia, and have elected and installed
the Honorable the Chief yustice of the Colony
of South A ustralia (Samuel James Way, Esq.)
as Grand Master.
The movement has been conceived and canned
out from no feeling of antagonism to our Parent
Grand Lodges, for whom zve have always felt,
and still feel, the most sincere affection and
gratitude , but solely from a conviction, arrived at
after much earnest and thoughtful deliberation,
that this course of action was conducive to the
good of the Craft, and would tend to strengthen
and increase its usefulness in our Colony.
It is now nearly half a century since Free-
masonry was first established in our midst, and


although grateful for the fostering care of our
Parent Grand Lodges we firmly believe that we
are now sufficiently strong to exercise the privilege
of self-government with credit to ourselves and
honor to those Grand Lodges from whom we
have sprung.
The action taken by the Brethren in this
Colony we trust will be approved and sanctioned
by your Most Worshipful Grand Lodge. The
almost perfect unanimity existing upon the subject
amongst the Brethren and the Lodges, as shown
by the Report forwarded herewith , leads us to
hope that your Most Worshipful Grand Lodge
will at once accord to us fraternal recognition
and co-operation. Such recognition and co-
operation we now respectfully ask for the Grand
Lodge of South Australia from your Most
Worshipful Grand Lodge , and we confidently
trust that such recognition will be cordially and
promptly given , and thus accord to the Grand
Lodge of South Australia the sole jurisdiction
within the limits of the Colony , so far as your
Most Worshipful Grand Lodge is concerned.
Signed on behalf of the Grand Lodge of South
Australia , this day of June, A.L. 5884,
A.D. 1884.

Grand Secretary.

OF THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
OF THE
|j|a.soiiir ||nion of ||oufh |l|usfralia
Concerning the Proceedings connected with
the FORMATION of the
Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons
OIB 1 SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The first meeting in connection with the proposed forma-
tion of a Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of
South Australia was held in the Masonic Hall Banqueting
Boom, Flinders-street, Adelaide, on Monday, 30th July,
1883, at 7.30 p.m.
The brethren assembled in response to the following
advertisement, which appeared but twice in the Register
and Advertiser newspapers :
? Members of the Craft under the three
Constitutions are requested to attend a meet-
ing of Freemasons, to be held in the Ban-
queting Eoom of the Masonic Hall, Flinders
Street, on Monday evening, the 30th inst., at
half-past seven o?clock sharp, to discuss a
subject of the gravest importance concerning
the progress of Freemasonry in this province.
? H. M. Addison, P.M.?


In response to this advertisement 123 brethren assembled,
and but few of them knew that it was intended at this
meeting to discuss the desirability of forming a Grand
Lodge. The result of the meeting was that 108 of the
brethren formed themselves into a Masonic Union, and
pledged themselves to aid in the formation of a Grrand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of South Australia.
The following is a report of what took place at the
meeting:?
V.W. Bro. H. M. Addison, H.G.T., E.C., said ?
?Brethren, as most of you are aware, from verbal inti-
mation, and from a short advertisement that appeared in
the papers, you have been requested to attend here this
evening to discuss a question of the gravest importance to
Freemasons. I will not trouble you with many remarks at
present, but simply state that the subject of ? the gravest
importance ? is the proposed formation of a Grrand Lodge
of South Australia. (Hear, hear.) Having informed you
of the object for which we have met, I move that Bro.
Mais take the chair.?? (Hear, hear.)
Bro. Fkasee, E.W.U.G.J.W., S.C., had much pleasure
in seconding it.
Carried unanimously, and E.W. Bro. H. C. Mais,
P.D.G.S.W., E.C., took the chair amid applause.
The Ciiaieman ?? Brethren, you are all aware, as Bro.
Addison has told you, of the object of our meeting, and I
will call upon him to move the first resolution.?
Bro. A ddison ?? The resolution is this, brothers: ?? That
in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that a Grand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of South Australia
be formed, and that immediate steps be taken to that end.?
I need scarcely tell you, brothers, I approach the subject
that has been entrusted to me this evening with a very
considerable amount of diffidence, for I can fully realize,
and I am sure each one will fully admit, that it is a matter


o� serious importance as regards tlie interest of the Craft
in this province. The subject of our meeting is not a
newly conceived one by any means. As you are well
aware, during a period of some years, it has been frequently
alluded to and discussed, and during the very recent suc-
cessful installation meetings we have had the pleasure of
attending, the matter has been alluded to by brethren of
the highest eminence in the Craft, and their remarks have
on all occasions been received with acclamation and the
utmost approval. As I said before, the conception of this
idea took place some time ago; it has therefore had time to
mature, and I hope that our vigorous action this evening
will manifest that the birth will not be premature. To use
a simile, brothers, that of parent and child (and I do not
know that I could select a better illustration with regard
to our position to the respective Grand Lodges), we have
now become strong, I will not say through the fostering
care of our parents from whom we have derived our
Masonic birth and nature, but thanks to that grand consti-
tution which we have inherited from the spotless life and
actions of our illustrious parents. We have become strong,
and may attribute the success of the Craft in this colony
to that strength ; and, brothers, long may we cherish for
our parents that attachment and regard which they so
amply deserve. (Hear, hear.) To continue the simile, we
now feel we are men of sound judgment, for unless we are,
how could we be here as Masons? We feel ourselves
strong enough to walk alone, and not only to walk, but to
run, and to run a winning race, brothers ; we know our
parents now no longer require our pecuniary assistance, I
don?t say they ever did require any special assistance from
us, or even that assistance which we, as dutiful children,
have readily given to them, by means of such contributions
as they in their discretion have been pleased to demand
of us. Therefore, having now become strong, we should
long for the privilege of enjoying a justifiable and honor-
able independence. (Hear, hear.) This is a most natural


and laudable ambition. It is natural tbat we should follow
in the footsteps of our parents, that we in our sphere
may ultimately become as honored and respected as they
are in theirs. For my own part, I cannot conceive any
action on our part which should better please the Grand
Lodge of England ?and the other two Grand Lodges, as
we are not here simply as members of an English Lodge ?
than that we should take this step now suggested to this
meeting. There is nothing unconstitutional in it. The
presence of so many illustrious Masons here should be a
sufficient guarantee of that. Grand Lodges have not ex-
isted from time immemorial; they are of comparatively
modern date. I may remind you of the manner in which
Grand Lodges are formed. To do that it will be more
forcible to use the words of Dr. Mackay, an eminent
Masonic jurist, and I will therefore read a short extract
from him: ?? In the first place it is essential that not
less than three lodges shall unite in forming a Grand
Lodge. Dermott, without any other authority that I can
discover than his own ipse dixit, says that no less than five
lodges must concur in the formation of a Grand Lodge,
and Dr. Dalcho, who was originally an ancient York
Mason, repeats the doctrine ; but if this be the true state
of the law, then the Grand Lodge of England, which was
organised in 1717 with the concurrence of only four lodges
must have been irregular. The Grand Lodge of Ohio was
organised in 1808 by only four lodges, and some doubt was
expressed at the time by the members of the regularity of
the organisation. A committee was appointed to investi-
gate the question, of which Bro. Lewis Cass, since dis-
tinguished for his investigations in another field, was the
chairman. The committee reported the example of the
Grand Lodge of England as a precedent, and the organi-
sation was consummated. It is strange that any doubt
should have been entertained on the subject, as the only
authority for five lodges which at that time could be quoted
was the spurious one of Dermott. The Grand Lodge thus


formed by the union of not lees than three lodges in con-
vention at once assumes all the prerogatives of a Grand
Lodge, and acquires exclusive Masonic jurisdiction over
the territory within whose geographical limits it has
been constituted. These are all principles of Masonic
law, which seem to be admitted by universal consent,
and sanctioned by constant usage in such organisa-
tions.? Well, brothers, I believe that the fact of
knowing that so few lodges as three might consider
they had it in their power to constitute a Grand
Lodge was the principal thing which moved me to take
some practical action towards the formation of a Grand
Lodge of South Australia. I had heard, as almost every
one has doubtlessly heard, it rumored that a Grand
Lodge would be formed here. Furthermore, I happened
to have in my possession the Victorian Freemason, in
which I read as follows:? ? A letter has been received
from a leading Mason in Adelaide by one of the Melbourne
brethren, stating that steps would be taken to form a
Grand Lodge of South Australia to follow up the Victorian
movement.? I thought that' possibly those who had
originated this rumor might take it upon themselves
to form a Grand Lodge, and for fear the minority, having
the example of Victoria and New South Wales before
them, should do so, and not as we would wish it to
bo done, and not so that our children in after years
might look back with pride upon the action of the
founders of the South Australian Constitution, I in-
terested myself in the matter as I have stated. It
would be most prejudicial to the interests of Freemasonry
in this province if a minority, such as obtained in the
other colonies were to say? ? We are the Grand Lodge
of South Australia.? It would bring Masonry in South
Australia into disrepute throughout the world. The
reason why would be, that the minority would be usurping
that authority and honour which should belong to the
great majority. If the time has arrived, and I believe it


has now, for establishing a Grand Lodge here, I think
our actions should be taken strictly in accordance with
the Constitutions and Masonic precedent; but there is
nothing laid down in the Constitutions against the action
we purpose taking. At any rate, it will be in strict accord-
ance with Masonic precedents. I will now tell you
what has been done up to this time. We were about
to have a meeting of the General Committee under the
English Constitution, I gave them to understand that
subsequent to the meeting, I should bring this matter
before them as individual Masons for discussion. We
discussed it, and everybody then present was fully in
accord with the intended action which has been taken
this evening; but we thought that it should not emanate
from the English Constitution only. (Hear, hear). We
wished to conciliate the Scotch and' Irish brethren as
much as possible ; and so far was that idea in the minds
of the brethren present, that we wished not to have the
meeting held in any part of this building, but in some
public hall. I was deputed to obtain a room for that
purpose, but on account of several rooms being engaged,
and the time being precious, and it being desirable that a
definite place of meeting should be fixed immediately, I
could not get a public building, and so we are here. This
is, however, only a matter of sentiment, and I am glad so
many are present. I need hardly express the wish that
our discussion should be characterized by that love and
harmony which should at all times characterize Free-
masonry. Some may ask how the Grand Lodges will
receive this action. I cannot answer precisely, but we
have no right to assume that the Grand Lodge will act
unmasonically. If we get three lodges, according to Dr.
Mackay, declaring themselves to be a Grand Lodge, the
Grand Lodge of England should recognise it. They have
not recognised New South Wales as yet, and you may say
if that is so, why not P I will give you what perhaps may
have been a good reason. I will read you a letter received


by John Williams, Esq., E,�. District Grand Master New
South Wales:?
?Freemasons? Hall, London, W.C.,
March 13, 1878.
? Dear Sir and Brother, ? I beg to acknowledge the receipt of
your favour of the 2nd January, relative to the formation of a
Grand Lodge of Hew South Wales. I have now to inform you
that the Grand Lodge of England has declined to acknowledge
this Hew Grand Lodge, the members of which are totally unknown
here, belonging to lodges under a different Constitution. It
would appear that you have taken every step that you could do
under the circumstances, and so long as you desire it, you will
receive all the support which the Grand Lodge can afford.
? I am, dear Sir and E.W. Brother,
? Yours truly and fraternally.
?John Heevet, G.S.
* John Williams, Esq.,
? E.W. District Grand Master Hew South Wales.?
Note. ?'?We consider that very little exception can be taken to
the language of G.S. Hervey?s letter,_ because no lodge under the
English Constitution in this colony had then joined the movement
to establish Grand Lodge, and therefore it is a point to be decided
whether or not Grand Lodge, English Constitution, could under
such circumstances act otherwise, at least, at the date of Grand
Secretary?s letter.?
? That was the note appended to the letter by the
Grand Lodge of New South Wales. There was some
reason for the G-rand Lodge of England not recog-
nising New South Wales, because they could not even
tell who of them were Masons. Not only in New
South Wales, but also in Victoria, the Masons who took
action, had a majority of their own District G-rand Officers
totally opposed to them. We shall find that is not the
case here, but that it is just the other way around. If we
get a majority in favor, the Grand Lodges of England,
Ireland, and Scotland' will the more cordially x*ecognize
us, because our actions will contrast favorably with the


action of the sister colonies. With regard to the ad-
vantages to be reaped from the formation of a Grand
Lodge, we shall reap the advantage of self-government.
At a distance of 13,000 miles, we could hardly expect to
communicate with that facility and certainty that we could
do if we had our supreme rulers in our own province.
It is quite unnecessary and most unprofitable to us that
funds should be drawn from us for the support of our
Grand Lodges in the old country. The money could be
far better invested in this province in charity, according
to the principles of our institution. (Hear, hear.) We
should feel we had a separate existence of our own, and
not feel as an off-shoot of a society in a far distant land.
The feeling of independence would give an encouragement
and impetus to Freemasonry in this province. We should
also do away with the English, Irish, and Scotch Con-
stitutions, with the three jurisdictions in one province.
Nothing is more repugnant than to hear brothers saying,
* I belong to this or the other Constitution.? Freemasonry
is universal, and it is all very well for brethren to have
their own lodges and belong to them, but for Masons of
one province to be subject to 70 or 80 jurisdictions as
might happen here, is absurd. We are subject to three,
and there is no reason why there should not be more, for
every Grand Lodge has a right to rule in our territory
while unoccupied by a Grand Lodge. We should have
an opportunity of appointing our own rulers. The
management of one concern would cost less than the
management of three ; and by casting our lots in together
we should form the nucleus of a benevolent fund that you
will agree we ought to have. (Hear, hear.) I don?t
know of many more points of advantage. If there are any
objections, I think they will hold as good ten or twenty
or even fifty years hence as to-day. It is utterly absurd
to expect a unanimous agreement on the point between all
the lodges in the province. The majority are, I think,
in favor of this action. I trust the minority will, as


they have been charged when they were initiated, cheer-
fully acquiese in the resolutions duly passed by a majority
of their fellows. (Applause.) We should be, united, a
very great power for good, and enjoy that goodness and
pleasantness which belong to those who dwell together in
unity. With regard to those who differ from us, we shall
all desire to act as gentlemen and Masons towards them.
We cannot expect unanimity, and we shall extend the
right hand of fellowship to them, notwithstanding
divergencies of opinion; and we shall endeavour by the
chisel of eloquence and the gavel of persuasion to smooth
those rough ashlars so as to render them polished corner-
stones for the new Temple of Masonry. (Applause.) I
have but very little doubt that we shall pass the resolution.
I have not trusted to any eloquence of mine, but to
sound judgment on your part, to gain me my point.?
(Applause.)
Bro. Philip Sansom aslted ?? How much is annually
contributed to the English Grand Lodge??
Bro. Addison ?? The amount that goes home from the
District Grand Lodge under the English Constitution is
somewhat under �lOO a year.?
Bro. Hugh Fhasee ?? I was asked to take an active
part in the great question which has come before us to-
night, and have therefore much pleasure in seconding the
resolution. Bro. Addison compared the South Australian
Lodges with a child to its parent ?to a child that had
arrived at the stage when he could walk by himself. We
have only to look around at the history of Freemasonry in
this colony for the last ten years, to show conclusively that
if Masonry in any part of the world has deserved to walk
by itself through the strides it has made, it is the united
Lodges of Freemasons in South Australia. (Hear, hear.)
I venture to say that, not only in respect to the quality of
the Masons, but the United action they have invariably
taken since I have had any connection with Masonry in


South Australia, as shown by the behaviour and constitu-
tional loyalty to the powers that be ?which is the grandest
characteristic of Freemasonry, for without it it would
never have attained the extraordinary dimensions it has
attained, not only in South Australia, but in every part of
the civilised world. We find that the Eoyal Princes (the
Prince of Wales is Grand Master of the E.C.) belonged
to the mystic tie, and the highest heads of nobility had
from time immemorial been Masons, and there was a
tendency on the part of the highest men of these colonies
to occupy positions in this desirable institution. One of
the greatest points in the question is, that there is a certain
hindrance to a Mason, of whatever quality of Mason he
might be, attaining the highest position; and without any
attempt to disparage in the slightest degree any brother
Masons who occupy the highest positions here at the
present time, it must be remembered that in the older
country the highest positions are open to competition,
while there are District Grand Masters who have juris-
diction in their different districts. We have only one
belonging to each Constitution, and unfortunately for
Freemasonry, and not for our individual sakes, he fills his
position during his lifetime. This is a drawback to the
best interests of Freemasonry. (Hear, hear.) Any change
that comes should come from a universal call, for without
it we shall not be strong, and with it we shall be strong ?
(Hear, hear) ?and it is impossible that the lodges of the
old countries can resist such a moderate demand as we
shall make (Hear, hear.) In any change, we shall be
all willing to give and take. England as the oldest country
should have the opportunity of putting the first Master in,
and the others in turn ; but afterwards we should have men
of our choosing ?the best men we have. It is an incentive
for good to a brother to hold for one year the highest
position in Freemasonry that is possible to be held in the
land of his adoption or nativity. Although comparisons
are odious, it is sometimes needful and useful to make them.


The working of Freemasonry in South Australia, the de-
meanour of the brethren at different lodges, the working of
the lodges, the address, decorum, and bearing of brethren,
is equal to anything that can be shown on the face of the
earth. (Hear, hear.) When we have attained a position of
that kind, it will be time that we united?England, Ireland,
and Scotland ?in one grand brotherhood?(hear, hear.) ?
and called for a recognition from our parents on a fair foot-
ing and basis ; before long we should get this recognition.
A brother asked as to the money we sent home, it may not
be much, but what do we get for it p All that we get is
that we have a certain District Grand Master appointed for
us, who holds the office as long as he lives, apart from any
habit, diligence, or love for Masonry?for he may lose it in
the district; it is a bar to the best interests of Masonry.
Anyone who has worked himself to the highest position
has a perfect right by the votes of his brethren to be Grand
Master of S.A. (Hear, hear.) I don?t think it is the time
or a fair thing now to go into the origin of Freemasonry,
or the history of the Institution whose temples cover the
civilised world, but I will say that it is only within the last
150 years that in the mother country Freemasonry, as it
were, raised herself from the ashes of traditions, sleeping
for centuries in the old country and most civilised coun-
tries. There has been such a shaking of dry bones in 150
years that her institutions are marks of civilisation over all
parts of the earth, and the majority of people who look
with impartiality on what Masonry is doing, agree that it
is a work unparalleled in ancient or modern times. On
this broad platform, which discards every form of creed,
we meet here in a common brotherhood ; all we demand is
that brothers shall believe in a Divine Architect of the
Universe, and be guided by the Divine Law, as laid down
in the Sacred Volume. (Applause.) That is a grand
basis, because vast differences of belief are submerged by
men banding together with brotherhood in their hearts. I
trust that there will be no discord. We are asking for


what we should hare had long ago in South Australia.
We are asking the different lodges throughout the country
to form a Grand Lodge in South Australia, in order that
they may show their willingness to band together for
brotherly love and Masonic sentiment, as man and man,
having one common hope to meet in the Temple above,
where the Grand Architect lives for evermore. I have
much pleasure in seconding the resolution.? (Applause.)
Bro. P.M. Barlow, I.C., ??I want to address a few obser-
vations to this large and enthusiastic meeting. Whatever we
may agree or disagree about, we shall be in one respect unani-
mous in rejoicing to find amongst us again the brother in
the chair ?(hear, hear) ?and Bro. Fraser, who has returned
with new vigor and health to work amongst us and attain
the highest positions in this order. I wish to make an
observation or two with regard to the proposal which
you are about to put, sir. I trust it will not be thought
that I am endeavouring in any sense to bring into this
meeting that disharmony which has been so justly depre-
cated, if I attempt to move an amendment to that propo-
sition, and state the reasons for so doing. The motion
which I ask leave to move is??That after the word ?formed?
in the resolution, there should be inserted the words ?with
the consent of the Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, and
Scotland.? ? I am quite sure that the resolution itself,
although it does not contain this clause or similar words,
is not intended by the mover, seconder, or the brethren,
to be discourteous to any of those Grand Lodges,
our parents. (Hear, hear.) But very strongly I have
always learned as a Mason, that loyalty and courtesy
are amongst our first virtues, and it does appear to
me, notwithstanding the precedents quoted by Bro.
Addison, upon which I propose to comment by-and-
bye, if we were to pass that resolution in the bald
and general terms in which it has been proposed and
seconded, it would at all events wear the aspect of our


haying been somewhat wanting at least in courtesy. We
have had in times past, my recollection of the colony is not
so very long, but those who can carry their memories back
will bear me out, that we have had every assistance and
support when the Craft was struggling in this colony.
(Voice : ? What was it ??) Although we have attained the
position in which we do not want that support or assist-
ance, we cannot forget that it was given when needed.
(Voices: ?What support?? and ?When??) I should
like to know how the District Grand Lodges would have
had any existence at all, if it was not by the consent of
those Grand Lodges at home? (Voice: ?Begging the
question.?) Ido not wish to introduce points which will
involve controversy, but simply to commend the amend-
ment. If the resolution pass in the general form in which
it has been proposed, the result will be, that the case will
go to the Grand Lodges that the brethren have determined
upon adopting a certain course, and that some of the
leading men, holding offices under these Grand Lodges,
without consulting us, or mentioning beforehand that they
had any such idea, have come to the conclusion that
whether we liked it or not they will form a Grand Lodge
in South Australia, entirely independent of us. For my
own part, I sympathise with the desire to form a Grand
Lodge here. (Hear, hear.) Many advantages may arise
from that, and so far as I can judge, there are no strong or
fair reasons why the Grand Lodges should, if asked, with-
hold their consent. If, having been asked, they refuse, I
should hold myself free to form my own judgment whether
that was not an unjust refusal, and I should hold myself
perfectly free to join the proposed Grand Lodge. (Hear,
hear.) If my own Grand Lodge were to give its assent
and the other to refuse, I should feel myself at perfect
liberty to join the proposed movement, and establish a
Grand Lodge here for South Australia. (Hear, hear.) I
trust I shall be pardoned for enforcing the amendment,
because those who have worked in home lodges may be


placed in this unfortunate position ?a position that I
should be put in if I went home for instance, to find
myself disallowed, cut by my brethren with whom I had
worked in times past. (Hear, hear.) lam not prepared
to expose myself to be placed in any such position. I do
not support the resolution unless it be qualified by some
such amendment as I have the honor to propose. If the
brethren will consider the fact that the lodges derive their
existence from the parents, they will see that we should be
just and courteous to ask their consent, (Voice: ?Quite
right.?) With respect to the passage from Dr. Mackay?s
work, that scarcely bears out the proposition he sought to
establish. So far as Bro. Addison read it, it did not appear
that the territory of Ohio, which he described had ever
been occupied before, occupied under any Grand Lodge ;
and I can quite understand that brethren should form
themselves into a Grand Lodge in unoccupied territory.
If that be so, it would not apply to the present instance,
nor would the simile Bro. Addison brought forward apply ?
because, however we might sympathise with the wish of
those who attained independence to act for themselves,
and not be trammelled by parental authority, we must
acknowledge this territory to be pre-occupied by those
parents, and this resolution practically amounts to ex-
pelling them from it. That is a very different position
from a young man attaining his majority and seeking not
to expel his parents from the home which they have made,
walks forth into unoccupied territory. We shall meet
with the end we desire by universal consent if we insert
some words such as I have indicated. What will be the
consequence of the amendment? The only disastrous
consequence would be that we should have to wait some
months, or it may not be some months, for an answer. If
we send the resolution home without the additional words
it will raise an uncomfortable and an unpleasant feeling in
the minds of Masons, our brothers at home, as they may
think, and not unnaturally, that we had been wanting in


courtesy iu not having asked their consent, which it was
very likely they were willing to give. (Hear, hear.) I
for the most part agree with many propositions advanced
by Bros. Addison and Fraser. Although it was thought
that the money sent home was not worth speaking of, it
does occur to me that it is somewhat of a hardship that
they should tax us here. It seems to me that they would
forego that if asked to do so, especially if we were likely to
apply it to Masonic charities here. Although we might
think the amounts are apparently infinitesimal, we must
consider the position of the Grand Lodges if the contri-
bution is withdrawn. They must be prepared to forego
contributions from all the lodges in the world, and with
what result ? That is not an answer to the proposition,
but that states a reason why we should ask them before-
hand : ? AYill you allow us to do this ?? And allow them
in return to say, ? Such and such valid reasons exist against
what you propose;? or, ?We admit that we do not see
any valid reasons against the application, and grant it.?
For these reasons, so imperfectly expressed, I move the
amendment.
Bro. John Lee ?? I second the amendment. I don?t wish
to add many words, but we should act with courtesy to our
parents at home. (Hear, hear.) It was an ordinary thing
on leaving home to embark in an independent undertaking
to ask leave. (Laughter.) We should do the same. I
don?t believe the Lodges at home are so unmasonic as to
cut us. Let us go, not with a bumptious spirit, and say,
? Now parent lodges, we have been obedient a long time ;
we think we can walk alone.? If with unmasonic
character they ungraciously deny us, we shall doubtlessly
take the next right step. lam quite sure we shall have a
grand and united lodge. Unity is strength. This Scotch, this
Irish, this English is very wrong. (No.) We are South
Australians, and as such let?s have such a lodge.?
Y.W. Bro. De. Seabeook, P.B.Gr.P., E.C. ?In


reply to the amendment, I will bring forward two facts.
Some time ago Bro. Muecke applied home with a
view of gaining the consent of the Scotch Grand
Lodge, and the reply was that they could not direct,
neither could they assist them; but if they did form
a lodge they would have their full sympathy. That
was three years ago. (Hear, hear.) With reference to
the Grand Lodge of England, in addition to what Bro.
Downer did when at home, the Grand Lodge, through
their managing man the Grand Secretary, was asked the
same thing, and his reply was that they could not assist in
any shape or form?they could not give their assent; but
they saw that the time would come when a Grand Lodge
would be formed, and presuming that it was done regularly,
they would not oppose it. With reference to the Irish
Grand Lodge, I cannot say anything at all. Bro. Barlow
perhaps knows something of it. These two facts are
sufficient basis to take energetic action on to form a Grand
Lodge as soon as possible. They (the Grand Lodge) will
not give their consent or countenance it until it becomes
an actual fact that the Grand Lodge does exist. It is no
use losing time. In fifty years hence the same impediment
will exist as now. Bro. Barlow will acknowledge that is a
sufficient answer to his point. (Bro. Lee ?? Have the
Grand Lodges been asked by lodges ??) By their repre-
sentative men. (Bro. Lee ?? Not by authority.?) Can
any brother from masonic authority or experience say a
Grand Lodge has been formed by consent of another?
Never. All the Grand Lodges in the civilized world have
been formed by taking independent action. We have a
sample of it in one instance where four old lodges formed
into a Grand Lodge. In Scotland, Erance, and elsewhere
it has been the same. Nobody can mention the case of a
Grand Lodge being formed by another. (Bro. Fraser ?
? But afterwards recognised.?) When properly carried out,
as we shall see it, we shall then be thoroughly recognised
by all the Grand Lodges.


Bro. Shaw, with great pleasure, supported the amend-
ment. If put to every individual member, each would
agree with Bro. Barlow. (No, no.) That is my view.
(Laughter.) Seeing it is only a matter of the loss of two
or three months, it is a duty to consult the Grand Lodges
to whom we are indebted for existence. We should look
ahead and take energetic steps which will commend us to
the whole world. We have had one example in Victoria,
seeing that there has been a little dissention in connection
with the Grand Lodge. That shows the fallacy and
wisdom of Bro. Barlow. We all hope Bro. Addison will
see the advantage of amending the resolution. It is all
very well for Dr. Seabrook to state what the Grand
Secretary said, but that is the opinion of one member.
(No, no.) When it comes to be put into a definite form,
it takes a different course. It means the calling together
of Grand Lodges to consider it. I have great pleasure in
supporting the amendment.?*
Bro. Saint, W.D.G.S.??If the amendment is carried,
who is to conduct the correspondence with the home lodges ?
I would point out to the supporters of the amendment that
the District Grand Secretaries of the three Grand Lodges
dare not do it. If the advertisement had been worded in
such a way as the Grand Masters could have taken hold
of it, it would have been their duty to call upon all masons
to abstain from attending. (No, no.) lam simply asking
you to remember your obligations, nothing more. (A
voice: ? All right,? and laughter.) Will Bro. Addison
conduct the correspondence? (A voice: ? The Chairman,
by authority of the meeting.?) He dare not do it. (A
voice : ? Then he ought to.?) If any mason in this room
were to write home, asking whether permission would be
given in accord with this amendment, the reply would be
*Bro. Shaw subsequently became a member of the Executive Committee, to
aid in the formation of the Grand Lodge.


the same as in New South Wales. As individuals we
are not likely to be recognised in the matter. We want
to do it as a South Australian Constitution. (A voice:
? And unanimously,?) If this resolution is carried, you
must be prepared to surrender your warrants and send
them home.? (Hear, hear.)
Bro. P.M. Skethewat ?? I feel sure this meeting will not
gain any end unless the proposition is carried. Who will
write home P If anyone writes, he will not be recognised,
because he does not do it through the District Grand
Lodge. What we have to do is to canvas the lodges and
members, and establish the Constitution. If we are going
to get the bull by the horns the amendment is wrong,
because that is getting the bull by the tail. If we are
willing to go in for a Grand Lodge, let us take the bull by
the horns and carry the resolution. If the amendment is
carried, the result will be a great hindrance to our cause.
We are acting constitutionally, if we affirm the resolution.
The amendment is to put it off for years to come. (No,
no.)
Bro. G-. C. KNight ? 1 ? If the amendment is carried, you
will have to go over the* whole work again. I hold in my
hand a work giving the formation of Grand Lodges in the
world. That of Ohio referred to by Bro. Barlow, when
formed, consisted of four or five lodges, and it has been a
Grand Lodge since. (Voice: ?The Grand Lodge of
Canada? ?) That was in the same way.
Bro. Lee ??The question is not the necessity of a Grand
Lodge, but how it shall be formed. Have we the power to
form it? (Voice: ?Certainly.?) Bro. Fraser says he has
not the power.?
Bro. Fraser ??Not as a private Mason.?
Bro. Lee ?? We can do it as children through the parent
lodges.? (Voice: ?Never.?)


Bro. Hocking ??We are in the position of rebelling
nations. If they form a new Government they are recog-
nised. We must establish this Grand Lodge, and as
united South Australian Lodges pull together; then the
Grand Lodges will recognise us.?
Y.W. Bro. Saul Solomon, W.D.G.J.W.?? Much has
been said about getting the consent of the Grand Lodges at
home, but the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland were
formed in. precisely the same way as we are doing here ;
no consent was asked and none given until they established
themselves. This is beyond dispute.? (Hear, hear! and
cry ?? Proof.?)
Bro. F. H. Wigg, W.D.G.S.?? What will make Free-
masonry in South Australia in the real sense of the word,
is joining under one Constitution. When we do meet
together, I hope wo shall put our shoulders to the wheel,
and make it what it should be in every part of the world.
A good deal has been said about getting the recognition of
the various Constitutions. We all look up to the home
lodges, and we should all like to get their sanction; but
if not we should go on. No one could be more loyal to
the home authorities than I am, but when we start together
we must stand together as one, instead of recognising
different Constitutions as to-night.? (Hear, hear.)
Bro. Addison ?? I shall endeavour to reply to one or
two remarks as to Masonic law. I don?t think that I
need discuss the subject of this resolution any further.
As a preliminary remark, let me say no words I gave
utterance to could have led any one to suppose that I or
any one intended in the remotest degree to treat the Grand
Lodges with any disrespect. (Hear, hear.) Nothing was
further off my intentions than to be guilty of any breach
of etiquette to those from whom we derive our Masonic
birth. Are we not doing as every Grand Lodge in the
world has done P As stated by Dr. Seabrook, it has never


been known that any proposed G-rand Lodge has asked
another Grand Lodge to form it. I am only stating
plain facts, as you can judge by referring to any juris-
prudence on Masonry. The forming of a G-rand Lodge is
an inherent right, and we have no need to consult any one on
the point. With regard to expelling brothers who do not
cast their lot in with us on the formation of a Grand
Lodge, if there are certain individuals who will continue
to hold warrants under existing lodges, we above all others
will be glad to receive them as representatives of Grand
Lodges at home. (Hear, hear.) It will, however, be to
their advantage to join the majority. Again, what have
we at present to put before the Grand Lodges ? Suppose
any brother has the impertinence to write home and ask
whether we will be recognised as a Grand Lodge. (A
vo i ce ?<p u t before them a definite statement.?) The
answer will be ? We cannot entertain the correspondence
except it comes through your District Grand Lodge.?
That would be Masonic etiquette, and we should be
deservedly snubbed. (Bro. Lee ?? Ask the District Grand
Lodge to do it.?) Does any one suppose the District Grand
Lodge would do it? ?and if they did, there would be nothing
tangible to be placed before Grand Lodge. Does any one
think that Grand Lodge would discuss vague possibilities?
We should make ourselves contemptible by asking without
having something tangible for the Grand Lodge to consider,
and they would look upon us as incapable of maintaining
the dignity of a Grand Lodge. (No, no.) There is no
sense in the idea. If we canvas and find we have a
majority, I don?t think that we shall be wanting in courtesy
if we say to our respective Grand Lodges ??We have a
majority and intend to declare ourselves, and request your
recognition;? but to say ? Please may we form a Grand
Lodge,? would be childish.? (Applause.)
Bro. Wigg suggested that the amendment should be
withdrawn.


Bro. Barlow had not the slightest intention to withdraw
it. He mentioned that the Provincial Grand Master, 1.C.,
would not sign any paper or have anything to do with it
if the resolution was carried. (Voice ?? He dare not.?)
A Brother asked ?? What would be the position of
those who should not join the Union??
The Chairman ?? As they are now ; continuing under
the same Constitutions.?
The Chairman then called on those against the amend-
ment to go on the right side, and the others on the left.
He then said there was an overwhelming majority for the
resolution.
Bro. Fraser counted the voters approximately and said ?
There are 107 ayes and 20 noes.
Bro. Williams, W.P.G-.5.D., I.C. ??As the first resolu-
tion has been carried so unanimously, I move ?? That the
brethren present now undertake to use their best efforts to
carryout the first resolution, and hereby form themselves into
a Masonic Union for that purpose, with power to add to their
number.? I simply ask you to carry this as you did the
first one, for the very simple reason that it follows it as a
matter of course.?
Bro. Lee ?I have much pleasure in seconding that
resolution.
Carried unanimously, amid applause.
Bro. Addison then called out the names of those who
had signed the attendance sheet previously to entering the
room, saying ? If you are in favor of the Masonic Union,
please say ? yes ?; if otherwise, ? no.? ? The names of
those in favor were ticked on the list.
Bro. W. B. AVebb, R.W.D.G.D.C., S.C., then moved?
? That Bros. Mais,E.C.; Fraser, S.C.; Addison, E.C.; Ram-
say, S.C.; Anderson, S.C.; Seabrook, E.C.; Ware, E.C.;


Earner, E.C.; Shaw, 1.C.; Sketheway, 1.C.; Carter, 1.C.;
Webb, S.C.; Williams,l.C.; A. Klauer, 1.C.; and A. Simp-
son, 1.C., be appointed an executive Committee for the
purpose of taking steps for carrying out the objects of the
Masonic Union, with power to add to their numbers.? My
only feeling has been one of great sympathy with Bro. Barlow
with respect to the application to the Home Constitution,
because I yield to none in the matter of loyalty. If I had
thought that there was anything in our proceedings reflect-
ing on Masonry, or our relation to the Home Lodges, I
would not have taken part in them. (Hear, hear.) But
after the full and lucid explanation of the Masonic law,
the statement of how the Grand Lodge Officers regarded
the matter, and the presence of the two brothers, whose
recent visit home would be more likely to imbue them
with antagonistic feeling against the separation, if any-
thing, I feel inclined to support it with every confidence.?
Bro. Beresford seconded.
Carried.
Bro. Eraser ?It is impossible to go away without
paying a tribute of praise to our Chairman who has ably
fulfilled his arduous task. (Hear, hear.) While on our
journey we were fellow passengers, and very excellent
friends as brother masons. Anyone will have a jolly good
companion and honest friend with him, if he has our brother.
(Hear, hear.) We have done nothing which will reflect
against Masonry in South Australia, and the more one
travels the more one sees that we do our work well?
thoroughly well. I am sure you will join me in proposing
and extending to the chairman a cordial vote of thanks, on
this the eve of what I consider to be the greatest step Eree-
masonry ever took here. (Prolonged and loud applause.)
Bro. Vockins, P.M. ?While I was out of the room, certain
names were taken of brothers favorable to the union. I
supported the amendment, but still I am most earnest for


the union, and you have my heartfelt wishes that it may
prosper. lam entirely in favor of it, and you will take my
vote with Bro. Barlow as simply expressing my views as to
the manner of the formation.*
Bro. Turner ??In order to put the resolution in a formal
way, I second it.?
Carried with acclamation.
The Chairman?? I rise to thank you very much for the
sentiment expressed towards me this evening. I have not
had a heavy task on account of the unanimity which seems
to prevail on the question. I have been delighted to have
been here, although at personal inconvenience to myself,
on the eve of one of the most important steps taken in this
colony with regard to Freemasonry ; and I hope it will be
followed up with the same earnestness that it has been
commenced, and that we may have a common sympathy
therewith.? (Applause.)
Bro. Hines moved a vote of thanks to Bro. Addison in
the matter.
Carried with acclamation, and the proceedings ended.
The Executive Committee considered it their first duty
to consult the R.Wpl. H.Gr.M. of the E.C., the R.Wpl.
H Gt-.M. of the S.C., and the R.Wpl. P.Gr.M. of the 1.C.,
as each Lodge in the province holds its warrant under one
or the other of these Constitutions, consequently a letter,
as follows, was sent to the R.Wpl. 13.Gr. Masters, and to
the R.Wpl. P .Gr. Master:?

? Adelaide, August 14, 1884.
?W r pl. Sir and Bro. ?I beg to acknowledge receipt of a letter of
10th inst., signed by you as Chairman of Executive Committee,
Masonic Union, South Australia, informing me that a * Masonic
Union? has been formed by members of the Craft holding certifi-
cates under the three Constitutions, to take steps to found a Grand
Lodge of South Australia; that this Union has appointed an
Executive Committee, which Committee request me to receive them
in order that they may discuss with me the desirability of creating
a South Australian Constitution. I fail to find in the Book of
Constitutions any authority for forming such an Union as you
advise me has been formed.
? I beg to call your attention to the circumstance that no inti-
mation was given to me of the objects of the meeting convened by
yourself, and that I first heard of the projected f Union ? from seeing
in the newspapers a report of the proceedings of that meeting.
? I am of opinion that no Brother, so long as he holds office in
the D.G. Lodge, E.C., can consistently take part in any movement
the result of which might restrict or reduce the influence in South
Australia of the English Constitution under which such Brother
holds office. Holding this opinion, I must myself decline taking
part in any such movement. If I considered the proposal of form-
ing a South Australian Constitution in place of the English Consti-
tution in South Australia to be desirable, I should feel bound to
resign the office I hold under the English Constitution before taking
any part in the movement.


?I n order that there may be no misunderstanding as to my
personal views on the subject, I beg to express my opinion that any
Mason from the youngest to the highest in office would make a
mistake in abandoning his connection with a Constitution which is
recognised throughout the civilised world from the lowest rank in
life up to the very highest, for a Constitution which is hardly
likely to be known or even heard of to any but a very limited
extent outside of South Australia, and this, so far as I am at present
informed, is the opinion - of nearly ninety-nine per cent, of the
Lodges in Victoria holding under the English Constitution where a
similar movement has been attempted, but which I am informed
has proved a signal failure there. A like movement in New South
Wales I am also informed has met with no better success.

? Arthur Hardy, Esq., M.P., RW.D.G.M,. E.C., S.A.
? Right Worshipful Sir and Brother,?Replying to yours of the
14th instant?
Ist. As regards the formation of a Masonic Union, I am aware
there is nothing in the Book of Constitutions authorising such, nor
indeed is there anything there concerning the mode of creating
Grand Lodges; but'in such cases, as a preliminary, it is usual for
brethren to form a Union.
2nd. ?As regards no intimation having been given to you of
the objects of the meeting of the members of the Craft con-
vened by me, and that you first heard of the projected
Union from the newspapers, only a few, personal friends with
whom I came in contact, did know the objects of the
meeting till they had assembled in response to my adver-
tisement inviting every Mason under the three Constitutions
to discuss a subject of the gravest importance concerning the
progress of Freemasonry in this province. Furthermore, I


thought it would have been presumption in me to have addressed
you on such a momentous subject when representing the views of
an individual Mason only. But so soon as I believed that nearly
all the workers and lovers of our order were willing to undertake
this great work with me, not only was I, but also the whole of the
Committee, were anxious to discuss the matter with you, and to
benefit by the counsel and advice your exalted position and large
experience qualified you to give.
3rd. ?As regardsD.G.L. Officers taking part in our proceedings,
the result of which might restrict or reduce the influence of the
English Constitution in South Australia, I have given that subject
consideration. I hold that the D.G. Lodge is but the aggregate of
the representatives of the Blue Lodges, and therefore, if it is
improper for D.G.L. Officers to act with us, it is also improper for
Blue Lodge Officers to take part in our proceedings; but that
cannot be, as it is well known that three or more Lodges must co-
operate to form a Grand Lodge ; and we also know that it is not
improper to form Grand Lodges, in accordance with Masonic
precedent, therefore it is not wrong for D.G.L. Officers to take
part in discussing the subject of the formation of a Grand Lodge.
I may also state that our action is not being taken with a view to
restrict or reduce the influence of Grand Lodges, for whom we
have, and shall continue to cherish the most profound veneration
and respect, but rather that the honor and reputation of our Craft
might be maintained pure and unsullied in this province, and not
be ?brought into contempt by an uninfluential minority forming
themselves into a Grand Lodge, and thus usurping that authority
which should alone pertain to the majority. This we had grave
reasons to believe would have occurred in our province had not
prompt action been taken, such as has been. May I also point out
that if all those brethren who are taking part in this movement,
and who are holding the highest offices in D.G. Lodges and the
Blue Lodges, and who have devoted their time, their ability, their
energy, and their money to the furtherance of the interest of our
noble order, were called upon to resign their offices, such would be
exceedingly detrimental to the interests of the Craft in this
province.
4th. ? With regard to the brethren making a mistake in
abandoning the English Constitution for a South Australian
Constitution, that in the natural course of events must take place.
None of us, I think, would expect that the Grand Lodge of South
Australia would, at once, be looked up to with that reverential
respect and pride that is entertained by the masonic world for the


Grand Lodge of England. To use a metaphor, we do not intend
to begin where our parents left off ; but this desire we do cherish,
that having their illustrious example before us, we may ultimately,
in our sphere, become as honored and respected as they are in
theirs.
? Finally, as regards your allusion to the action of our brethren
in New South Wales and Victoria, we consider there will be little
analogy between their action and ours. We shall not attempt to
form a Grand Lodge unless we have a large majority in favour of it.
"It will be a pleasure to me. Eight Worshipful Sir, to afford you
every information at all times, and in order that you may be
acquainted with our proceedings, I shall do myself the honor to
forward to you a few copies of any circular or letters that may be
issued by the Committee from time to time.
? I have the honor to be,
"Eight Worshipful Sir,

? Chairman Masonic Union of S.A.?
The letter to the D.G.M., S.C. and the P.G.M., 1.C., were not forwarded
until the 13th August, as it was expected that a reply would have been received
by that date from the D.G.M., E.C., and that then the same day might have
been fixed, upon which the Committee might have waited upon the heads of
the three Constitutions, the object of this being to save the time of the
members of the Committee.

? H. M. Addison, Esq., P.M. 505, E.C., Adelaide.
? Dear Sir and Brother, ?I have to own receipt of your favor of
13th inst. informing me that a Masonic Union had been formed
by members of the Craft holding certificates under the three Con-
stitutions to take such steps as may be necessary to form a Grand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of South Australia, Also
that an Executive Committee had been appointed, and that you
had been desired to request me to receive such Committee for the
purpose of discussing with me the desirability of creating a South
Australian Constitution.
?In reply I beg to state that I have considered your request,
with every desire to comply with it, but on reflection have come to
the conclusion that in my official capacity I cannot discuss the
desirability of abolishing in South Australia the Constitution from
which I hold my commission. I must therefore with regret decline
to receive your Committee for the purpose mentioned in your
letter.
? Should, however, your Committee forward to me the proposition
which they wish me to receive, and a summary of the reasons in
support of it, I will transmit them to the Grand Lodge in Dublin
for their direction and advice.
? Apologising for the delay in answering your letter.
? I am, dear Sir and Brother,

The next step was to request every Secretary of every
Lodge in the province to supply a list of the names of
the members of their respective Lodges, and every Sec-
retary, with the exception of Bro. Winter, of the Duke
of Leinster Lodge, No. 363, 1.C., cheerfully and gra-
tuitously complied with the request.
On the 14th August, 1883, Wpl. Bros. Seabrook and
Addison waited upon R.Wpl. Bro. Hardy, unofficially,
by appointment, to discuss the intended action of the
Craft with regard to the formation of a Grand Lodge.
.However, these brothers were received officially by the
R.W.D.G.M., E.C., who had summoned the Wpl. D.G.
Sec., Bro. Cunningham, to be present and to take notes
of the conversation.
Wpl. Bro. Seabrook then communicated the ideas of
the Masonic Union as to the formation of a Grand Lodge
to the R. W.D.G. Master, who said he would be guided by
circumstances as to what action he might take
Wpl. Bro. Addison intimated that he would convey his
ideas in writing to the R.Wpl. D.G.M.
On the 17th August, 1882, the Executive Committee
waited, by appointment, upon the R.W.D.G.Master of
the S.C., and put him in possession of the ideas of the
Masonic Union, with regard to the formation of a Grand
Lodge. The R.Wpl. brother received the deputation most
fraternally, and said that he would transmit their wishes
to the Most Wpl. the Grand Lodge of Scotland.
The following letter, with printed reply, was then sent
to each of the 2,071 contributing members, whose names
had been supplied to the Chairman of the Masonic Union by
the Secretaries of the lodges. (It may here be remarked that
a member of the Duke of Leinster Lodge, No. 363, 1.C.,
supplied the names of ninety-six of its members, as the
secretary had declined to supply any of the names of the
members of that Lodge.)


? Freemasons? Hall, Flinders Street, Adelaide,
? August 20th, 1883.
? Dear Sir and Brother, ?I have the honor to inform you that at
a large and influential meeting of Brethren of the English,
Scotch, and Irish Constitutions, who assembled on the 30th ult.,
at two days? notice, a resolution was almost unanimously carried
affirming the desirability of forming a Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons of South Australia. Nearly all the brethren
present (namely 108 out of 123) then formed themselves into a
Masonic Union, and pledged themselves to use their best efforts to
form a Grand Lodge. An Executive Committee was then
appointed by the meeting for the purpose of carrying into effect
the objects of the Union, and which Committee have directed me
,to request that you will accord this important movement your
hearty support.
? A large majority of the leading Masons in the colony have
expressed their approval of, and their intention to aid in, the
formation of a Grand Lodge of South Australia, believing that
they would thereby be better enabled to carry out the principles of
the Craft, and that they would constitute a more effective organi-
zation.
? A list of the names of those brethren who became members of
the Union, and of those who were appointed an Executive Com-
mittee, is annexed hereto.
At foot please find form for signature, which I will thank you to
tear off, sign, place in enclosed envelope, and send to me by return

t On account of the Secretary bavin?' declined to supply the Chairman with a
list of names of the
brethren of the Duke of Leinster Lodge,
there
must be many members of that Lodge who have not had the privilege of
being formally requested to join the
regrets this very much.
Masonic Union.
The Chairman
J Secretary states that 11 of the brethren of this Lodge have left the District,
tut still contribute.


N.B.?Every Bro. who has replied to the Chairman?s letter and
has not pledged himself to support and further its objects has been
marked as declining to join the Union, even though he may have
expressed himself in favor of a Grand Lodge, but nevertheless
desired to take no active part in the movement.
The following letter, with printed reply, was then for-
warded to every W.M. of every Lodge in the province:?
? W.M
? Waterhouse Chambers, King William-street, Adelaide,
? October 27th, 1883.
? The Worshipful Master and Brethren,
? Lodge No.
?Dear Sir and Brother, ?Herewith I have great pleasure in
placing before you an analysis of the results of the labours of the
Executive Committee of the Masonic Union of South Australia up
to date, with regard to obtaining the written consent of each
contributing member of the craft to join the said Union, and to
use his best endeavours to form a Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons of South Australia;
? The analysis explains itself, and permit me to congratulate
you, Worshipful Sir and Brethren, on the great success of our
undertaking; the unanimity of the Brethren of the Three
Constitutions, being, I believe, under similar circumstances,
altogether unprecedented in the annals of Freemasonry throughout
the world.
? The practical issue of our labours must now be approached ; I
have therefore to request you. Worshipful Sir, at the earliest
opportunity, to give, or cause to be given in your Lodge, the
following Notice of Motion: ??That, as a very large majority of
the contributing members of the craft under the Grand Lodges of
England, Ireland, and Scotland, in this province, have signified,
under their signatures, their approval of, and their intention to
aid in the formation of a Grand Lodge, in the opinion of this
Lodge it is desirable that a Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons of South Australia be forthwith constituted, and this
Lodge hereby gives its hearty support to the furtherance of that
object, and will assist in the formation of such Grand Lodge.?


? This motion having been carried, it will then be necessary that
your Lodge should be represented at the Convention of Free and
Accepted Masons to be assembled at such time and place as shall
be named by the Executive Committee, for the purpose of
nominating and electing the Grand Officers and establishing the
Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of South Australia.
? It is proposed that only those brethren who have the privilege
of representing their respective lodges at their District or
Provincial Grand Lodge shall be entitled to attend or to vote at
the said Convention.
?Then, Worshipful Sir, so soon as you have confirmed the
minutes recording the required resolutions, please to send me
under your hand and the seal of your Lodge a copy of the minutes
relating to those resolutions, and also the names, qualifications, and
addresses of the representatives of your Lodge.
? I have the honor to be,
" Worshipful Sir and Brethren,
? Yours fraternally.
H. M. ADDISON, P.M. 505., E.C.,
? Chairman Masonic Union of South Australia.?
? The Chairman Masonic Union of South Australia.
? Dear Sir and Brother, ?In reply to yours of 27th October, 1883,
I have the honor to inform you that at a meeting of the Lodge
No. holden at on the
day of 188 , the following Eesolution
was proposed by Brother and seconded by Brother
and carried, namely :? c That, as a very large
majority of the Contributing Members of the Craft under the
Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland, in this Province,
have signified, under their signatures, their approval of and their
intention to aid in the formation of a Grand Lodge, in the opinion
of this Lodge it is desirable that a Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons of South Australia be forthwith constituted, and
this Lodge hereby gives its hearty support to the furtherance of
that object, and will assist in the formation of such Grand Lodge.?


_
?It was also resolved that the following Brethren act as
Delegates for this Lodge at the Convention referred to by you

and Qualification

Address.
? The Minutes
referring
to the above were confirmed on the
day of
188 in open Lodge
assembled.
? I have the honor to be.
?Worshipful Sir,
? Yours fraternally.
The following letters, dated respectively Ist November
and 19th November, were also forwarded to every W.M.
in the province:?
?Waterhouse Chambers, King William-street, Adelaide,
? November Ist, 1883.
?The Worshipful Master,
? Lodge No.
? Dear Sir and Brother, ?As a few Brethren have desired to know
whether the Lodge is a proper place to discuss the desirability of
forming a Grrand Lodge, I submit with the utmost confidence that
without doubt it is the only place where the subject can be officially
and effectively brought forward. Is it not pre-eminently a subject
that affects the good of Freemasonry in general and of each Lodge
in particular P


? Then again, every Mason knows that, in order to form a Grand
Lodge, the consent of at least three Lodges must be obtained. How
can the consent of a Lodge be obtained to anything without notice
of motion having been duly given in open Lodge, in order that the
Brethren may have had an opportunity of discussing the subject?
Therefore, if it is right to discuss this matter in at least three
Lodges, it is right to discuss it in every Lodge, for the greater the
number of Lodges giving official support to the formation of a
Grand Lodge, the greater will be the success, and the nearer will
be the approach to that unanimity which is so much to be desired.
The following extract from the Proceedings of the regular Quarterly
Convention of Grand Lodges, held September 1, 1869, in the Free-
masons? Hall, London, displays the heartiness with which, on its
formation, the Grand Lodge of South Australia may expect to be
recognised by the Grand Lodge of England :
* The Acting Grand Master said he saw he had to make a com-
munication with reference to the formation of a Grand
Lodge of Nova Scotia, and he would therefore move a reso-
lution to acknowledge it ; but he would first call on the
Grand Registrar to explain the circumstances.
? Brother A. E. J. Mclntyre was sure the Brethren knew that
in most of our colonies Masons were living under three
jurisdictions at least. The Grand Lodge of England held
supreme sway over those Lodges that held warrants from
it. The Grand Lodge of Scotland was the recognised
power in a number of the colonies. In many of our colo-
nies also the Grand Lodge of Ireland had granted warrants
to subordinate Lodges which acted with the Grand Lodges
of England and Scotland, although owing allegiance to
the Supreme Grand Lodge of Ireland. This was the case
in Nova Scotia, where England had the largest number of
Lodges, supported by the most eligible Masons. It hap-
pened some time ago that Grand Lodge of Scotland felt
dissatisfied with the way in which their Lodges were con-
ducted, and those Lodges determined to assert their inde-
pendence ; and unknown to the Grand Lodge of Nova
Scotia, the Grand Lodge holding sway under the Grand
Lodge of England, proving their loyalty to the mother
country, and determined to uphold the interests of Masonry
in that colony; but they found themselves in a very awk-
ward position, because by the late international law a
notion was abroad that a certain number of Lodges might
form themselves into a Grand Lodge, and that they then


got possession of the country. This caused a great deal
of perturbation. They frankly and openly communicated
their difficulty to the Grand Lodge of England. They
themselves felt that the time had come that by the num-
ber and importance of Masons in that colony the three
jurisdictions named might form a Grand Lodge which
would do honor to the three parents who had sent them
forth. They joined together and held their various assem-
blies and communicated to the Grand Master that they
thought the time had come when they might assert their
independence, and, as the daughter of Grand Lodge, might
walk alone and maintain the interest of Masonry else-
where. The Grand Master, with that loyalty which
always distinguished him, gave them no countenance to
throw off the yoke of England, if it was a yoke at all ; but
he said, ?If you find you are strong enough to stand
alone, and approach the Grand Lodge of England as it
should be approached, the Masons of England are too
loyal and too sound to reject the prayer of any petition.?
Now, they had acted on that recommendation, and the
substance of it was this ?they felt themselves in a position
now to uphold Masonry in the colony ; they had brought
themselves to that strong position they now held, and
they asked the Grand Lodge of England to recognise them
as a Grand Lodge, owing to-the Grand Lodge the allegiance
they had always held. There certainly appeared to (Grand
Registrar) to be nothing more honorable to them or this
Grand Lodge, so deeply did they feel their obligations that
they humbly solicited that they might retain the warrants
they now held as a perpetual memorial, to be handed down
from generation to generation, to show that they sprung
from the old tree of Masons in England. (Cheers.)
Therefore, he had much pleasure, in the absence of the
Grand Master of England, in asking the Grand Lodge
to recognise the prayer of this petition, and to allow that
the Grand Lodge of Nova Scotia should exist as an inde-
pendent Grand Lodge, but allowing the Lodges there to
retain their warrants.
Brother J. L. Evans, President of the Board of General Pur-
poses, seconded the motion on the ground that inconve-
nience must result in after ages from three independent
Grand Lodges holding jurisdiction over the Lodges in the
colonies. When "they felt themselves strong enough to
establish themselves as an independent Grand Lodge, it


was the duty of the Grand Lodge of England to recog-
nise them as such.
? Brother the Rev. Robert J. Simpson, P.G.0., did not think so
momentous a question should be decided after a half-
hour?s discussion. The Grand Registrar had, however,
made himself so completely master of the subject, that his
opinion ought to have considerable weight, although they
might not feel bound to tie themselves to his conclusions.
He was inclined to accept his opinion that, where three
jurisdictions exist, there must be a certain amount of
antagonism. There is a time when infancy ceases and
manhood begins, and if that period had arrived in Nova
Scotia as regards Masonry, he would say that the colony
which stands in the van of our colonial dependencies
should by all means have an independent Grand Lodge of
its own.
? Brother Murray, D.G.M., China, fully concurred in the motion
of the Grand Registrar. The question was simply whether
the colonies, when they felt themselves strong enough,
were to have the privilege of governing themselves. His
opinion was, that it was for the good of Freemasonry that
they should have the power when they could exercise it
properly.
� Brother Mclntyre replied, and the motion was carried.?
fl Finally, Worshipful Sir, I trust that if, possibly, a few
of the members of your Lodge should not approve of the formation
of a Grand Lodge, they will call to mind that part of the charge to
the Entered Apprentice where he is exhorted readily to acquiesce
in all votes and resolutions duly passed by a majority of the
Brethren. And, unless necessity requires it, it is requested that you
do not make use of this letter in open Lodge.
? Yours fraternally.
H. M. Addison, P.M. 505, E.C.
? Chairman Masonic Union of South Australia.?
? Waterhouse Chambers, King William-street, Adelaide,
? November 19th, 1883.
Worshipful Sir and Brother, ?Referring to mine of the 27th


ultimo, requesting your Lodge to consider the following notice of
motion:?
? That as a very large majority of the contributing members
of the craft under the Grand Lodge of England, Ireland,
and Scotland, in this province, have signified, under their
signatures, their approval of, and their intention to aid
in the formation of a Grand Lodge, in the opinion of
this Lodge it is desirable that a Grand Lodge of Free
and Accepted Masons of South Australia be forthwith
constituted, and this Lodge hereby gives its hearty
support to the furtherance of that object, and will assist
in the formation of such Grand .Lodge,
? I am directed by the Executive Committee to request you to
summon a Lodge of Emergency to consider that motion at your
earliest convenience, of course giving the notice specified in your
by-laws to all your members, of the emergency and its special
cause. You are also specially requested to inform me of the
number of members belonging to your Lodge, the number present
at the discussion of the above-mentioned motion, and if the
motion is not carried unanimously please state the number of
brethren who voted against it.
? And if any of the few brethren of your Lodge who have not
yet (in reply to my printed letter) requested that their names
should be added to the list of the supporters of the Masonic
Union should be present, and vote in favor of the motion, I wish
you would supply me with their names, in order that they may be
added to the list of supporters of the movement.
? The Committee consider it most desirable for the interest of
the craft in this province that the Grand Lodge of South Australia
should be constituted without delay. Lodges of Emergency are
being called by the city and suburban Lodges.
? In conclusion. Worshipful Sir, if you have any doubt whatever
as to the expediency of acting promptly in this matter, let me
assure you that the members of the Executive Committee consist
of eighteen (18) of the most devoted and experienced lovers of our
order, and far would it be from any one of them to counsel any-
thing adverse to the interests of Freemasonry. I am also to
inform you that cur movement is not being carried on in any secret
manner, as copies of every document issued by the Executive
Committee have been forwarded to the District Grand Masters and
their deputies, and to the Provincial Grand Master and his Deputy.

elected at first meeting of Grand Lodge, being Masters

nominated.?
? That a Meeting of Delegates be held at the Free-
masons? Hall, Flinders Street, on Monday, March 24,1884,
to receive the report of the Executive Committee, and to
nominate Grand Lodge Officers.?
The Committee have also to report that they have for-
warded a circular to the W M. of each Lodge, suggesting
proper legal methods of transferring Lodge funds and
property, and have much pleasure in stating that His
Honor the Chief Justice, Bro. S. J. Way, has signified his
consent to be nominated for the office of Grand Master.
From the very exceptional character of this office (it being
an Antient Landmark of Freemasonry) the Committee con-
sidered it advisable, at a comparatively early stage of their
proceedings, to select some distinguished brother to be
nominated for the office, and the Committee were unanimous
in their desire that the Honorable the Chief Justice, Bro.
S. J. Way, should allow himself to be nominated. They
considered that Bro. Way, on account of his learning and


exalted social position, would reflect honor upon their
choice, not only within this province, but also throughout the
Masonic world. The nomination o� this distinguished
brother they trust will do away with a contest for the
office, inasmuch as it is considered that those distinguished
Masons who are worthy of the high honor of the appoint-
ment, are unanimous in their desire that Bro. Way should
accept the office, and are equally agreed that his so doing
would considerably promote the welfare of our order.
And it is solely on these grounds, after considerable
solicitation, that Bro. Way has been persuaded to accept
the office of Grand Master of South Australia.
In conclusion the Committee report that they have held
eight meetings, with an average attendance of between
twelve and thirteen members.

undertakings, that we may know and serve Thee aright, and that
all our actions may tend to Thy glory and to our advancement in
knowledge and virtue. And we beseech Thee, O Lord God, to bless
our present assembling, and to illuminate our minds through Thy
great mercy, that we may walk in the light of Thy countenance,
and when the trials of our probationary state are over, be admitted
into the Temple ? not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.?

? Eternal Source of Life and Light, we, Thine unworthy creatures
reverently bow before Thee in adoration and praise. As when we
first saw the light at our Mystic Altar we implored Thy guidance,
protection and aid, so now we seek Thee for Thy Divine blessing
and direction. In Thy Might we are strong, and without Thee in
our best and highest estate we are but frail and feeble things. We
humbly implore Thy Divine favor upon this occasion, and upon the
Institution in the service of which we are now engaged. Make it
yet more helpful and beneficent to our race, and inspire all who are
connected with it with an ardent love to Thee and to each other,
and to every member of the human family. Bless now Thy servant
before Thee, who is about to assume a new and important relation
to his brethren. Give him wisdom, give him strength, give him
love; enable him so to bear rule that he may keep in view the best
interest of the Great Brotherhood now about to be committed to his
charge. Teach him to feel- that he is about to assume great and
trying responsibilities, and enable him so to discharge them as to


win all hearts. Add Thy blessing to the brethren who are about
to be associated with him in office; may they all feel a just sense of
their accountability to Thee and to the Fraternity, and may they
ever be faithful and zealous, and assist to uphold the hands of their
Chief in all good deeds. In Thee, O God, as in the days of our
apprenticeship, do we put our trust. Be Thou our faithful Friend,
Conductor, and Guide in the unseen vicissitudes of life before us.
and bring us all at last to see the Great Light, inaccessible and full
of glory, in Thy presence, where we shall behold Thee with an
unclouded vision for evermore. Amen.?

? Supreme Governor and Controller of Mankind, by whom Kings
reign and Princes decree justice, be pleased to vouchsafe to this
Thy servant, now about to be called to this high office in our Brother-
hood, Thy heavenly blessing. May he prove a true and diligent
guardian of the principles, privileges, and usages of our Order, and
may he, through Thy favor, be strengthened to the discharge of
those duties to which he is now solemnly and specially to be
pledged.?

Bro. the llonoeable S. J. Wat, after having taken a
solemn obligation, was duly invested and installed as the
M.W. Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Free and
Accepted Masons of South Australia, and saluted by the
brethren in due form, and addressed by the Installing
Grand Master, Bro. Muecke, as follows: ?
?Most Worshipful Sir?for henceforth you are entitled thus
to be hailed?in inducting you to your Chair of Office, as a
symbol of the' commencement of your government over the
Craft, I am performing a most solemn duty. By the imme-
morial usages and landmarks of Freemasonry you, as Grand
Master of Masons are invested with powers and prerogatives
which are well nigh absolute. The interests of the Craft, for
weal or woe, are placed in your hands during your term of
office. The good resolutions you have doubtless formed in
your own mind that these powers shall not be abused or per-
verted while in your hands, I would gladly strengthen by a
few words of admonition which it would not become me after
this morning to utter. The very consciousness of the possession
of a great power, will ever make a generous mind cautious and
gentle in its exercise. To rule, has been the lot of many. It
requires neither strength of intellect nor sound judgment.
But to rule well has been the fortune of but few, and may well
be an object of every honorable ambition. It is not by the


strong arm or the iron will that obedience and order, the two
great requisites to good government, are secured, but by holding
the key to the hearts of men. The office of Grand Master is one
of great antiquity and respect, and is one of the highest
dignities to which we may aspire. Its incumbent to rule well,
requires the possession and practice of several important
requisites. As a man, he must be of approved integrity and
irreproachable morals, freed from the dominion of hasty
temper or ill-governed passions; of good repute in the world,
and practising as an example to the Craft the cardinal virtues
of prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice. As a citizen
he must be loyal to his government, obedient to its laws; prompt
in the duties he owes to society, and a very pattern of integrity
in all his social and domestic relations. As a Mason he must
cling to the Ancient Landmarks, and sternly oppose their in-
fringement ; be a proficient in the laws, language, and literature
of the fraternity, ever desirous to learn and apt to teach ;
though not a workman himself for the time, yet master of the
work and qualified to earn his wages ; ever ready to relieve,
slow to demand; ever remembering, that though elevated for a
time above his fellows, he was elevated by them, that he is yet
a Craftsman more sacredly bound by a Craftsman?s obligation ;
and that at all times, wherever he be, he should practice the
golden tenets of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth As an officer
he should remember, first of all, that he is an individual
Mason, and as such, sharing a common lot with his brethren,
and feeling an interest in the welfare of each and all; he should
avoid all undue ostentation or haughty overbearing ; be access-
able, to all cultivating the closest friendship and most unlimited
confidence with his associate officers ; ever ready to take council
with the brethren, and to give it; forbearing long and much
with evil doers, ready to reward the good ; be free from favorit-
ism, and wholly impartial ; watchful over the treasury, keep-
ing an eagle eye on every part of his jurisdiction, and breasting
over the restless spirit of innovation.
? Such, Most Worthy Masler, are some of the qualifications
of a Grand Master of Masons. The virtues he should possess,
the errors he should avoid, probably most, if not all, have
not come up to this standard, but it is attainable ; be it your
purpose to reach it, and be a shining light to your successors.?

The M.W. the Grand Master then gave the following
address: ?
Right Worshipful Brethren and Brethren?lt is a trite
and obvious thing to say that the inauguration of the Grand
Lodge of South Australia is the greatest Masonic event which
has happened in this colony. Masonry in South Australia
has had three stages of development, corresponding to our
individual lives and our political historj. Each of us has
passed through childhood and youth to manhood. As
colonists at first we had no representative institutions, then
we had a partly elected legislature, and finally came full
responsible government. So in Masonry we had first private
lodges only, then Provincial and District Grand Lodges, and
now the process of evolution is complete in the establishment
of an Independent Grand Lodge.
The formation of Grand Lodges has been much discussed
for some years, both in this and the neighbouring colonies.
During the last few months the Masonic Union of South
Australia has furnished the Craft with the results of a
careful investigation of the whole question. It is therefore
needless to detain you with a statement of the authorities
and precedents which justify the action we have taken. It
is I suppose undisputed?First, that a Grand Lodge may
be founded in a country or colony where none already
exists; and secondly (notwithstanding some early instances
to the contrary, before Masonic jurisprudence had attained
its present development), the formation of a Grand Lodge
must be the act not of any outside authority?not even
of another Grand Lodge? but of the private lodges meeting in
the country in which it is to be established. Certain other
questions which have been debated in controversies on this
subject elsewhere do not concern us here. The right of three
lodges to establish a Grand Lodge in what is called ?unoccupied
territory,? the legality of such a step when it is taken without
the concurrence of a majority of the lodges in the territory
concerned, and its effect upon constitutions not represented in
a Grand Lodge so founded, are questions, which, however in-
teresting in themselves, have no practical bearing upon Masonry
in South Australia. This Grand Lodge is established with the


concurrence of the three Constitutions and of all the lodges in
this great colony save two. An overwhelming majority of the
Masons of the colony, as members of the Masonic Union, gave
their sanction individually to the formation of this Grand Lodge,
which consequently is the act of the Craft at large. I cannot
therefore doubt the lawfulness of the work in which we are
engaged; nor do I see any good reason for questioning its
expediency.
I have never heard, and never expect to hear, from a
South Australian Mason, one disloyal or unfraternal word
respecting the Grand Lodges under whose warrants we have
hitherto worked. We shall always be proud of the three
sources of the ever-widening stream of South Australian
Masonry. The English, Irish, and Scotch Constitutions ?to
which we have now ceased to be subordinate but from which
we hope never to be severed in friendship?will continue to be
regarded by us with much the same feelings as in after life we
have for the homes of our youth, with the same affection as we
who have become South Australians will always retain for our
mother country ?for our fatherland. At the same time it has
long been evident to most of us that the existence side by side
in this colony oE three separate Masonic constitutions (only
separated at home from geographical reasons) ?presenting as it
did the anomalous spectacle of one brotherhood divided into
three ?was a state of things which could not be regarded as
permanent and final. The most consistent advocate of the
conservation of old ties will surely admit that sooner or later
the time must come when the lodges of South Australia, like
those of Canada, must cease to be dependent upon Grand
Lodges in the mother country; the time must come when the
supreme government of the Craft can no longer be carried on at a
distance from us of 15,000 miles, when the division into three
constitutions must give way to union, when the risk of greater
divisions by the issue of warrants to form lodges from foreign
Grand Lodges must be averted ; and the time must come when
in accordance with the ? Ancient Charges ? the gratification of
the laudable ambition of ? becoming at length the Grand Master
of all the lodges according to his merit ? shall be the privilege
of the South Australian as well as the British and Irish Mason.
And the verdict of the Craft is practically unanimous that in


South Australia that time has come. Even if the three Con-
stitutions could have been placed under one local head it would
only have been one step in the direction of the journey we have
taken on our own account. And considering that our first
lodge was formed nearly half a century ago, considering that
we have more than ten times as many lodges as formed the
original Grand Lodge of England, considering that the Masonic
brotherhood in South Australia is between 2,000 and 3,000
strong, that our ranks are undivided by dissension or dispute,
that we are united in an undertaking for the benefit of Masonry
with a unanimity which has surely never been surpassed, con-
sidering also that we have both in office and in the body of the
Craft men who have grown grey in its service, in the study of
its mysteries, and in the observance of its precepts, and that
we are receiving constant accessions to our numbers, the time
has surely arrived when in the words of the late Grand Master
of England we are ? strong enough to stand alone.?
Brethren, the work in which we are engaged was undertaken
in the interests of Masonry, for the ? good of the craft,? and
not from motives of personal ambition. As I have been a mere
spectator of the operations of the Masonic Union, whose work
is now complete, I hope I may be -permitted to express my
admiration of the manner in which the labors of the Executive
Committee have been carried on?at the conciliatory and self-
sacrificing spirit which its members have displayed, and at the
absence of jealousy, rivalry, and self-seeking amongst them.
The Eight Worshipful the Installing Master, who has performed
his duty with so much impressiveness, sacrifices the dis-
tinguished office of District Grand Master of the Scottish
Constitution in order to accomplish the object we have in view,
and without seeking or accepting any office in the new Grand
Lodge. The Eight Worshipful Brother Addison, with whom
this movement for Masonic Union originated, and by whom it
has been advocated with singular pains, discretion, and zeal,
has refused to be nominated for any office in the Grand Lodge,
and his example in this respect has been followed by other
brethren scarcely second to him in exertions on behalf of
Masonic unity, and of equal standing in the Craft. It is to a
like desire to subordinate all personal claims to the good of the
Craft that I account for the fact that many brethren of dis-


tinguished rank and great achievements in Masonry have stood
aside from candidature for the Grand Mastership, which has
consequently been conferred, and undeservedly conferred, upon
one whose public duties have for many years prevented his
active participation in the labors of Masonry, and whose chief
qualification for the duties he has undertaken is a determination
to do his best for the advancement of the Order and for the
maintenance of its ancient constitution and established land-
marks. Certainly I should not have accepted this high office
into which I have been installed, and for the duties of which I
should otherwise feel myself quite incompetent, if I were not
assured of the ready assistance and loyal support of the Eight
Worshipful the Deputy Grand Master, and of the other officers
and members of the Grand Lodge, and also of the confidence
and forbearance of the members of the Craft.
Hitherto in South Australia we have as Freemasons been
working under our different constitutions in three bands or parties.
To the casual observer we were seemingly engaged, without a
common plan, in the erection of three independent edifices, hav-
ing no apparent connection with each other. blow, happily the
partitions which divided us have been destroyed. The temporary
supports and scaffolding which hid the true design of our work
have been removed. And lo ! we find ourselves side by side, a
united brotherhood, within the walls of one Masonic temple.
We have before us the same volume of the sacred law ?the
same square, compasses, and plumb-line for the laying out and
trying of our work. If under our new organisation we labor
unitedly with the old zeal, and in accordance with the precepts
of the law which has always been our guide, we may hope for
the advancement of Masonry and (which should be our chief
aim) the approval of the Great Architect.
The E.W. the Deputy Grand Master, Bro. Henry
Edward Downer, M.P., harrister-at-law, was then obli-
gated, invested, installed and saluted in due form by the
brethren.

(by choir.)
BEHOLD how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell
together in unity. It is like the precious ointment that ran
down upon the beard, even Aaron?s beard, that went down to the
skirts of his garments.
As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon
the mountains of Zion, for there the Lord commanded His blessing,
even life for evermore.
The Acting Director of Cermonies, Bro. T. E. E. Sea-
brook, with flourish of trumpets, proclaimed in the East,
West, and South, the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons of South Australia as duly constituted and estab-
lished.


The petition decided upon the previous night was then read by
Y.W. Bro. J. H. Cunningham, Grand Secretary, praying the M. W.
Grand Master to confer upon W. Bro. H. M. Addison the rank of
P.D.G.M., in recognition of his valuable services to the Craft
in South Australia as Chairman of the Masonic Union.
The M.W. Grand Master said?? Brethren, I agree with
every word of the petition. JMo brother in the Craft appreciates
more than myself the valuable services rendered by Brother
Addison, and it gives me the greatest pleasure that my first
official act should be to confer upon him this well-deserved
rank. Bro. Addison, it affords me much pleasure to beg you
to accept the rank of Bast Deputy Grand Master of South
Australia, with all its rights and privileges.?
Bro. Addison, having been invested, said??M.W. Grand
Master, Grand Officers, and Brethren all, I most heartily thank
you for the high honor you have conferred upon me. You
must not measure my feelings by the fewness of my words, but
at present all I can say is to thank you.?
The Grand Master then said?? Brethren, before closing the
Lodge I have another resolution to propose, a vote of thanks to
the Installing Grand Master, M.W. Bro. Muecke. The ceremony
he has so ably conducted this morning is but the last of a long
series of services rendered to the Craft during many years past.
All of us must acknowledge his wonderfully able conduct of the
ceremony, and everyone present must have appreciated the
impressive manner in which he carried out the Installation.?
The D.G.M., Bro. H. E. Downer, seconded the vote of
thanks, with the exception that he hoped it would not be the
last service Bro. Muecke would perform for the Craft. Those
who had known Bro. Muecke in his connection with the Craft
would feel as he did in this matter, and he hoped he might long
be spared to benefit Freemasonry in the colony.
The Grand Master then put the motion, which was carried
unanimously, and M.W. Bro. Muecke was then saluted in due
form.
The M.W.P.G.M. Bro. Muecke, on rising to respond,


was warmly greeted. He said Most Worshipful Sir and
Brethren?l thank you very heartily for the resolution you
have carried in my honor. I feel that this will be a red-
letter day in the annals of Freemasonry in South Australia.
I believe the action which has been taken is perfectly
right, and in accordance with Masonic usage and the un-
written law of Freemasonry, and that the Grand Lodge
incorporated this morning must exercise a strongly benefi-
cial influence upon the order in the colony. If I should
say that it was with pleasure I resigned my position of D.G.M.
of the Scotch Constitution I should not be telling the whole
truth, as I must confess to some feeling of regret in parting
from a position which I valued highly, and from which, for a
time at least, I must suffer a sort of official severance. I have
been true to my promise made long ago, that when the time
should arrive when it seemed beneficial for the Craft in South
Australia to form a Union and a Grand Lodge of their own, I
would retire from my high official position to facilitate the
accomplishment of that object. It is only right I should tell
you that I have, therefore, resigned my position as D.G.M. of
the S.C., so that I do not stand here to-day as the representa-
tive of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and their action is totally
unfettered by anything I may have done in connection with the
ceremony to-day. I have written home to the Grand Lodge of
Scotland and described the different phases of the movement
which has led to our union. I have explained the loyalty we
still bear to the Parent Constitutions, and that we hope always
to maintain friendly and brotherly relations with them. I have
assured them that the action taken here from first to last has
been manly, open, and Masonic. I believe if the Grand Lodge
at home is approached, as it should be, with a memorial from
our Grand Lodge, asking for recognition, that it will be granted
at once and freely. I believe that what we have done will bear
fruit. I would like to bear my testimony to the energy, zeal,
and ability displayed by Bro. Addison in connection with this
movement and to the valuable services which he has rendered
to Freemasonry in the colony. Indeed, so great is this worthy
Brother?s knowledge of all Masonic law that I have frequently
been glad to receive assistance and advice from him.
The National Anthem was then sung.


Prayer was offered by the Grand Chaplain.
Grand Lodge was then closed in ample form by the M.W.
Grand Master.
Grand Lodge Officers retired while the Choir sang the
concluding verses of
Jplhe of the (Jasons
(with vocal chorus.)
jjfjJpiE ages roll along,
?Mid everlasting strife,
Between the right and wrong.
The good and bad of life.
We mortals feel the thrall
Of trials old and new ;
Tho? many men may fall,
Yet Masons still are true.
Yes, we Masons still.
We still are prompt to prove our might
Against all deeds of ill.
And in the cause of right.
And as we march along,
The aged and the youth,
And strive to conquer wrong.
With love, relief, and truth.


|NyVUQURATION JBaJMQUET.
?
The Banquet was laid in the Town Hall, four tables the whole
length of the body of the hall being provided, and a cross table
on a platform in front of the organ for the Grand Master, his
Deputy, and other distinguished Officers and Brothers. The
number present was about 450.
The M.W.G.M. presided, and was supported on his right by
the E.W.D.G.M. Bro. H. E. Downer. M.P.; the E.W.P.G.S.W.
Bro. H. C. Mais; the Grand Treasurer, Y.W. Bro. W. L.

Wpl. Bro. Philip Sausom, and Grand Senior Deacon Wpl. Bro.
J. C. Kaufmann. The banquet arrangements were carried out
under the able superintendence of P.M.?s Bros. J. H. H.
Yockins, J. P. Bedforth, and J. G. Williams, and Bro. F. D.
Beach catered for the assembly. Y.W. Bro. Seabrook acted
as Director of Ceremonies, and to him, as also to P.M. Bro.
J. H. H. Yockins, a large share of the credit is due for the
general success of the whole arrangements.


The Grand Master read apologies from M.W.P.G.M. Bro.
Muecke and V W. Bro. Wallace. He also read the following con-
gratulatory telegrams:?? Sydney, April 17.?Grand Master
Farnell and Officers of Grand Lodge of New South Wales send
fraternal greetings to the Grand Master and Officers of South
Australia on the Inauguration of their Grand Lodge.?Nicholas
Weekes, Grand Secretary, Masonic Hall, Sydney.? ?Melbourne,
April 17. ?To the Grand Master.?Hearty good wishes and
congratulations on erection of Grand Lodge of South Australia.
?H. W. Holloway, Secretary of Grand Lodge of Victoria. ??
? The Provincial Grand Master of Boyal and Oriental Free-
masonry for Australia, and Grand Eepresentative for Grand
Lodge of Italy in Grand Lodge of New South Wales, sends his
courteous and fraternal greeting on inauguration of Sovereign
Grand Lodge of South Australia. All hail.?E. Patterson
Negus, Castlereagh-street, Sydney.?
The Grand Master, in proposing ? The Queen and the
Craft,? said that Masons who were true to their obligations
were most loyal subjects, and always honored that toast. Her
Majesty was both the descendant and the mother of Free-
masons ; she had the unique experience of being the
daughter of a Grand Master and the mother of a Grand
Master. Her Majesty?s father, His Eoyal Highness the
Duke of Kent, did great service to the cause of Masonic
unity when he was Grand Master of the Ancient Masons
of York. He assisted in bringing about the happy union
of the various branches of Masonry in England, which
resulted in the establishment of the present Grand Lodge
In South Australia they as Masons had shared the latest sorrow
of Her Majesty. The Queen had lost a son who for his virtues
and accomplishments was a pattern of princely excellence,
They as Freemasons had lost one of the brightest ornaments of
their order, and one who would have been, had his life been
spared, a strong pillar in Masonry. The Duke of Albany was
not a merely ornamental M ason ; he was a practical worker
in the craft. Only a few months ago Bro. Mais witnessed
the installation, by their late Eoyal brother, of Lord Brook as
Provincial Grand Master of Essex, in England. He (the
Grand Master) would not detain them further, as he was sure
of the reception the toast would meet, and he would now call
upon them to drink ? The Queen and the Craft.?


The toast was drunk with Masonic honors and the singing of
the National Anthem.
The Geand Mastee said the toast he had now to propose was
? The Sister Constitutions,? and the fact that this was placed
next to the toast of ? The Queen and the Craft ? was proof, if
proof were needed, that in establishing this Grand Lodge of
South Australia they had not established a Masonic schism,
but that they were true in fraternal feeling to Masonry all over
the world. It was an indication also that they had established
their Masonic independence and claimed to address the
Grand Lodges of the world in terms of equality. And
in speaking of the sister Grand Lodges their hearts
naturally turned first to the three Grand Lodges under
which they had previously been working. Having set up
housekeeping on their own account, they naturally turned
a regretful glance at their old homes. They remembered that
to the three Constitutions?English, Irish, and Scotch?they
owed the laws under which they as Masons were governed,
the ritual under which their work was done, their knowledge of
Masonic mysteries, and even their Masonic existence. The
South Australian Masons had shared the greatness of those
Grand Lodges ; they had swelled their numbers, and they had
enjoyed their protection. They had separated from the Grand
Lodges of Great Britain and Ireland, not in consequence of any
difference, but because they felt that the lime had arrived when
the development to which they had attained required that they
should assert their independence among Masonic constitutions,
and to do that which they had done in the cause of Masonic
unity. They must remember, too, in honoring this toast that
gratitude partly consisted of a lively sense of favors to come.
He trusted that they had not received their latest benefit from
the British and Irish Grand Lodges. They had another benefit
yet to receive from the Grand Lodges under which they had
been working?a benefit which he believed would be heartily and
cheerfully accorded ?viz., recognition and free communication.
He did not know what their feelings were that morning, but he
could only assume they were something like his own. He had
never seen so grand a spectacle before as that which they had
witnessed at the inauguration of the South Australian Grand
Lodge. His own feeling was that if the members of the Grand


Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland had been present
with them that morning, and had learned from their presence at
the ceremony the unanimous fraternal feelings by which they
were animated, they would have considered it unnecessary to
make any further investigations into the subject, and the inde-
pendence of South Australian Masons and their lawful existence
as a G-rand Lodge would have been recognised at once. His
Eoyal Highness the Prince of Wales was the Grand Master of
the English Constitution. He was the patron of the Scotch
and Irish Constitutions, and he (the speaker) trusted that when
all the facts of the case were laid before His Eoyal Highness,
and when he became acquainted with the loyalty of their
feelings in South Australia to the Crown, and their true attach-
ment to the principles of Masonry, he would graciously be
pleased to become the Grand Patron of the Grand Lodge of
South Australia, But the toast he (the Grand Master) had
proposed was not limited to three Grand Lodges of which
had been speaking. The horizon widened so as to include the
Grand Lodges of Masonry in other parts of the world?in every
kingdom of Europe; in Asia, which was the seat of the mysteries
from which Masonry had taken its origin; and above all in
America, where there was a Grand Lodge in every State, and
five Grand Lodges in Canada. Canada had taught them that
Masonic independence was not inconsistent with loyalty to the
Crown and attachment to the present Constitution and to the
principles of Masonry all over the world. When they
remembered that the Grand Lodge of South Australia, now
established, formed one of the chain of Grand Lodges that
encircled the world, their hearts must expand with the greatness
of the task in which they had been engaged that day. But
there was a practical side to this question also. Their position
as a Grand Lodge?as one of the sister constitutions of Free-
masonry ?entitled them not only to recognition, but to free
communication on all subjects of interest to the craft with
Grand Lodges all over the world. Those who were familiar
with the valuable contributions to Masonic jurisprudence by
members of the craft in America, would understand how in-
estimable a benefit that would be. No feeble word of his
could express, and certainly they could not increase, the
fraternal feeling for the sister Constitution by which the
Masons of the South Australian Constitution were animated.


The choir then sang?? Let Masonry from pole to pole.?
R.W. Bro. Fiveash, P.P.D.G.M., 1.C., in responding, said
that he had doubts as to whether his reply should be general or
local, but the Grand Master?s speech, and the telegrams he had
received, showed the kindly feelings of sympathy that existed
in the hearts of tens of thousands of Masons who would join in
congratulating them, in wishes at least, in all parts of the
world, and he felt assured the time was very near when this
Grand Lodge would he recognised not only in America but in
other quarters of the world. The work that day had been done
in a manner not to be surpassed. It was in his opinion a fore-
gone conclusion with the Grand Lodge of Ireland and of
Scotland to recognise this Lodge, and he believed they would
soon also receive the recognition of the Grand Lodge of England.
There were circumstances which prevented his taking part in
the formation of this Grand Lodge?because he had peculiar
feelings as to his oath of allegiance which bound him to his own
Lodge, but he sympathised with Bro. Addison and all who had
taken part in bringing about this work. When in 1875 he gave
up his position in the Craft, it was with the view of doing what
had now been better done. There was another brother whose
absence he had regretted, but he was now pleased to see him
present. He regretted that one Lodge of the I.C. had held
aloof from the Union. The ceremonial of that day had afforded
him very great satisfaction, and he hoped that he would yet live
to see the day when every Lodge in South Australia would
hail from the Grand Lodge of South Australia.
Y.W. Bro. Rev. F. S. Poole, Grand Chaplain, craved indulg-
ence for having at very short notice, through the absence of the
M. W. Bro. Muecke, to propose the important toast of the Most
Worshipful the Grand Master. Such a position as that
which the subject of the toast now occupied was one that
it was a laudable and desirable ambition in any man to
aspire to, but the Grand Master was not an aspirant to this
exalted position, as he considered that there were other prominent
men in the Order who were well entitled to fill it. He was,
however, selected by those who had charge of the Masonic
Union to undertake the onerous duties of the office, which,
at their request, he had accepted, and, although the position
gave lustre to the occupant, there was no doubt whatever that


the office had received a lustre from the ability and distinguished
attainments of His Honor the Chief Justice, as was shown by
the admirable speeches he had given, and the grasp of his
subject that he had exhibited in the address delivered by him
at the inauguration of their new Grand Lodge. He had for
some time been honored with the acquaintance of the Grand
Master, and he believed that a sense of duty had led him to
accept the high position he now occupied. It was a distinc-
tion in Freemasonry that although the Most Worshipful
Grand Master held this high position in the craft, and also a
most eminent one in the world outside, yet in a sense he was
the equal of the humblest member of the Craft, for he was
their brother. We heard much of the social differences that
marked off class from class in the world. He did not think
that the various remedies proposed would do much to minimize
these distinctions, but undoubtedly the brotherly spirit fostered
by Freemasonry did much in this direction, and did most
certainly look forward to the time when
Each man finds his own in all men?s good.
And all men live in noble Brotherhood.
He begged most heartily to propose the health of the Most
Worshipful Grand Master.
The Quartette ? Come let us celebrate ? was then sung by
members of the choir.
The MW. Grand Master, replying to the toast, said?
E,.W. Brothers and Brethren, allow me to return my most
grateful thanks, in the first place to my old and dear friend
the Grand Chaplain, Bro. Poole, for his all too kind and
haltering speech, and to you all for the kind and hearty manner
in which you have honored the toast. As Bro. Poole said, I
am one of those upon whom greatness has been thrust. When
I was invited to accept the Grand Mastership I hesitated
to do so?though not an idle man ?because of my other
public pressing duties ; because also of my inexperience of
masonry, and because the claims and fitness of other brethren
for the office were so much greater than my own. From a
spirit of self-sacrifice, which I cannot too highly praise, many
brethren for whom your suffrages might naturally be expected,
refused to be nominated for office, and so after much anxious


consideration I consented not to oppose my own opinion to the
general wishes of the Craft. I should myself have liked to
see one of the District Grand Masters of the English, Irish, or
Scotch Constitution at the head of the Craft. This, however,
was impossible. All we could expect from them was impartial
neutrality with respect to the movement in which we have been
engaged, and not active participators in it. In the absence
of the Past Grand Master Brother Muecke, I will say I
cannot name a brother better fitted for this high office, or who
has sacrificed more in aid of Masonic unity. I hope at some
future day to have the pleasure of assisting at his installation
as head of the craft. When I said just now that I accepted
this high office with reluctance, I do not wish it to be under-
stood that I lightly esteem the honor you have done me. My
reluctance was because I felt the honor was beyond my deserts,
and involved duties I did not feel equal to. I will, however,
do my best to vindicate your choice, and trust that with the
loyal aid of the officers of the Grand Lodge and the confidence
of the Craft, my term of office may not be to the disadvantage
of Masonry in South Australia.
Y.W. Bro. Saul Solomon, Grand President of the Board of
General Purposes, in rising to propose the health of the Install-
ing Grand Master, M.W. Bro. H. C. E'. Muecke, said?lt must
be a matter of regret to them all that circumstances prevented
his being with them on that occasion. He would have been
glad to say many things in his favor, but the Grand Master
had said so much that he had the less to say. He remembered
when Bro. Muecke was installed as D.G.M. of the Scotch Con-
stitution he (Bro. Solomon) expressed the hope that the day was
not far distant when all the Constitutions there represented would
be amalgamated in one. It was a patent fact to all that every
member of the Scotch Constitution agreed to join the Masonic
Union of South Australia, and that was doubtless due to the
respect in which they held their M.W.D.G.M., whose health
he now cordially proposed.
The toast was drunk with honors.
Bro. H. Oelmann then sang ? Excelsior ? in fine style.
Y.W. Bro. W. B. Webb, Grand Registrar, responded for Bro.
P.D.G.M. Muecke. He had for some years worked under


him and was well acquainted with his excellencies. He
believed there was no Mason in South Australia who had a
more extensive knowledge of Freemasonry, except perhaps the
E.W. Bro. Addison. They were both enthusiastic Masons, and
the Craft was deeply indebted to them for all they had done for
it. On behalf of Bro. Muecke he heartily thanked them for the
toast.
Y.W. Bro. His Honor Justice Boucaut said he should
feel it a duty, at the call of the M.W.G.M., to propose a toast
at that magnificent and historical celebration. He had, there-
fore, great pleasure in proposing the health of his esteemed
friend Brother Downer. No Mason was good at praising
another brother before his face, but he would say that he
believed no one after Bro. Addison had done more to forward
the movement, the consummation of which they were now
celebrating. Yet he had not been untrue to his obligation.
Many years ago, before many of the brethren present knew
him, he had worked with Bro. Downer in English Lodges, and
he could tell them that, but for the immense energy, activity,
and perseverance ef Bro. Downer, the English Constitution
would not have been what it was in South Australia. It had been
said there was nothing in a man, but he maintained there was, and
without Bro. Downer?s work Bro. Addison would have had
nothing to work upon. In many things he was held to be demo-
cratic, but not when the Master was in the chair, then he was
under an autocracy. He would like to say a few words about
the peculiar position he himself held in the Craft; he heartily
wished them success, but while his head was with them, and
he admitted they had the logic of the thing on their side, they
must allow him to show a little of the heart in the matter;
and he hoped that in the future that great and important body
would remember that some of those who had not joined with
them from the first had refrained from doing so, not because
they did not recognise the logic of the case, but because of the
sentiments of the heart. He was glad to meet them, and hoped
he might be allowed to meet them on other occasions. He
had the permission of the Grand Master to propose the health
of the Deputy Grand Master, Bro. Downer, and he asked
them to drink it heartily.
E.W. Bro. Henry E. Downer, D.G.M., in responding to


the toast, said he had so many times received kindness at their
hands that he experienced a difficulty in finding words to
express his feelings. Though he held a similar position to that
which he had so long held under the English Constitution, he
considered his present position far superior, and he hoped more
likely to result in benefit to Freemasonry. His loyalty to
the English Constitution while an officer compelled him
to abstain from taking an active part in the steps towards
a Masonic Union. While in South Australia they had
three Constitutions, each working on the same principles,
each actuated by the same motives, each endeavoring to
do the greatest possible good, he felt that they might
have done a greater work if they had been under one
government. Masonry had prospered, however, and very
materially so within the last fifteen or twenty years, but
undoubtedly Bro. Addison had struck the right moment in
which to agitate the formation of a Grand Lodge. But his (the
speaker?s) difficulty was partly solved when he found that
nearly all the Lodges under the English Constitution (only one
excepted) were unanimous in supporting the movement, and
the whole difficulty was fully removed by the District Grand
Master cancelling the patent of his office, thus leaving him free
to take his own course as to what he should do. It was, inad-
vertently a very kind act, although it might have been done
in a more graceful manner. Shortly after that he was
waited upon by a respected Brother of the Irish Constitution,
and asked whether he would consent to be nominated for the
position of Deputy Grand Master, and he said that if his
services would be of any advantage to the craft and to the
proposed Grand Lodge he would be glad to occupy any
position the brethren felt he ought to occupy. That
sufficiently explained his appearing there as the Deputy
by their unanimous voice. Reference had been made to
his past connection with Masonry; but he remembered
the time in South Australia when they had great difficulty
to get an attendance to carry on a Lodge, and some
times had to borrow brethren to make up a Lodge. He
hoped Masonry would now obtain a larger sympathy outside
for its principles of brotherly love, relief, and truth. They
should establish a Benevolent Fund, existing not merely in
name, but by their annual contributions, to relieve poor


Masons. He would consult with the Grand Master about
divising a scheme to form a Benevolent Fund. They would
shortly have the nucleus of a Benevolent Fund from the
Masonic Hall and Zetland Hotel property, worthy of South
Australia and worthy of Freemasonry. The question of the
formation of a Grand Lodge of South Australia was one which
had occasionally been referred to at Masonic banquets, and
discussed privately by Masons of all Constitutions for many
years past, and when it was decided to purchase the hall in
which they now held their meetings, it was specially considered
that the property should not be bought for the benefit of any
one Constitution, whether English, Irish, or Scotch, but should
be purchased for the purpose of Freemasonry in general,
wholly irrespective of any particular Constitution. Here the
Trustees and their friends had been far-seeing in providing for
a state of things which had now actually occurred. In some
of the other colonies difficulties arose as to Lodges joining the
Colonial Grand Lodge, in consequence of the property being
held for the benefit and purpose of one particular Constitution.
Ho such difficulty could arise here, and the Freemasons?
Hall would be used for the purpose of Freemasonry, irrespec-
tive of Constitution, and its surplus income would ultimately
be devoted to purposes of education and benevolence. Having
been relieved of his duties as D.D.G.M., a position under
which he had had the honor to rule the craft for the last
fifteen years, he felt that in future his duties would be
much lighter than they had been for many years past. He
believed they now had a Grand Master, not merely in name,
but in fact; one who would, by his presence among them, by
his energy, and by that ability with which the Great Architect
of the Universe had blessed him, help on the Craft in the
colony, and build it up as a structure worthy of South Australia,
and of that greater and higher cause?the cause of Freemasonry.
Bro J. H. H. Vockins, P.M., followed with the toast ? The
Grand Lodge Officers.? He alluded to the increased importance
of the positions, and his confidence that the brethren holding
them would fill them creditably to themselves, and with
advantage to the craft.
E.W. Bro. A. M. Simpson, G.S.W., and E.W. Bro. J.
Eamsay, G.J.W., acknowledged the compliment.


R.W. Bro. H. M. Addison, P.D.G.M., on rising to propose
the next toast, was received with enthusiastic applause. He
said?The toast I have the honor to propose is ? The South
Australian Constitution.? I think my first duty should be
to acknowledge the compliment paid by the banqueting com-
mittee in conferring upon me the honor of proposing this toast;
however, brethren, it is only consistent with the courtesy and
kindness every member of the Executive Committee has dis-
played towards me at all times. lam not going to give you a
dissertation on the mode of creating a Grand Lodge of Free
and Accepted Masons. This is quite unnecessary in our case,
brethren, because all the actions of the Executive Committee
have been known to you from the beginning until now ; and it
seems to me that the right thing has been done at the proper
time, and in the correct manner by them. I need scarcely tell
you that it was not I who originated the idea of a Grand Lodge
of South Australia. The hope that there would be a Grand
Lodge at no distant date seems to have been implanted and
cherished in the breasts of many true lovers of our order in
this colony for some years past. It was not so with me. No
sooner had I conceived the idea than I acted upon it. Perhaps
it was presumptuous in me to do as I did, but you will believe
me, brothers, when I tell you that my action was prompted
solely by an enthusiastic desire for the welfare of our order ;
and do not I pray you deem me egotistic when I declare to you
that self or self-advancement in Masonic honors, much as I
prize them, did not for one moment enter into my thoughts,
and the great secret of our success, I believe, has been in this,
that those seventeen true brethren who have been so closely
allied with me as members of the Executive Committee, and
that you, brothers, have been imbued with the same spirit of self-
denial. My principal reason for wishing to form a Grand Lodge
now was that a similar state of masonic affairs to that existing
in Victoria especially, and in New South Wales in a less degree,
might be avoided here. lam sure the brethren in New South
Wales and Victoria would not consider my allusion to them
unfraternal, for if I regret the division among them, how much
more must they grieve over it. It would ill become me to
give an opinion as to who.is to blame for this disunion among
the fraternity in the sister colonies. I had heard that a Grand
Lodge was to be formed here, and I had also read something


in one of tlie Masonic journals, and as through, the kindness of
my brethren I had been placed in a somewhat exalted position
in the Craft, and therefore came frequently in contact with the
highest and best Masonic workers in this province, none of
whom, so far as I knew, were taking any active part, if any at
all, in the establishment of a Grand Lodge, I therefore
imagined that some uninfluential minority were about to under-
take this great Masonic work, and might probably declare
themselves to be the Grand Lodge of South Australia. I
therefore took upon myself to summon a meeting of the Craft,
with what happy results it is well known to you. lam not
now going to dilate upon the advantages that will accrue to us
as a Grand Lodge. They are doubtless as well known to you
as to me. Some nervous brethren have asked me if our Grand
Lodge will be recognised by the Grand Lodges of England,
Ireland, and Scotland. I have not the slightest hesitation in
saying positively, yes ! Why, brethren, they dare not refuse
us recognition! This I say not in any unbecoming spirit of
bravado, but because I dare not contemplate for one moment
that these illustrious bodies will be guilty of an unmasonic act.
I am sanguine enough to think that not only shall we obtain
immediate recognition, but that we shall be complimented upon
the unprecedented unanimity of our brethren, and that our
Lodges will bo allowed to retain their warrants as mementos of
their distinguished connection with their grand old parent
Lodges. Brethren, in Masonry as in all other things progress
should be our motto. Why then, in these days of amalgama-
tion as in Victoria, annexation as in Queensland, and confedera-
tion as in all the colonies, should we be content to sink our
Masonic identity, and to leave our territory in the possession of
others ? As we are now able to govern ourselves, I consider
it would be undignified of us to be content to remain any
longer an offshoot of any Grand Lodge. Why should we not
have an identity of our own, and thus be placed in communi-
cation with the wdiole Masonic world? At present we neither
hear of, nor are heard of, by any Grand Lodges in the world,
except those of England, Ireland, and Scotland. We are
altogether excluded from Masonic intercourse with our brethren
in America, where, I am pleased to learn, there are over half-
a-million of Masons, and where Freemasonry is carried on with
enthusiasm not to be excelled. It seems to me that our actions


require no vindication, nor shall we require any special plead-
ing, to which I am certain we shall not condescend, in order to
be placed in fraternal communication with every Grand Lodge
in the world. In conclusion, brethren, the honor, usefulness,
and reputation of our Lodge is to a large extent under the
control of our G.M., and I cannot but congratulate you,
brethren, upon the excellency of your choice, and may we all
from the youngest apprentice to the most skilled Past Master,
assist our M.W, Grand Master by virtuous, amiable, and
discreet conduct, in making this Grand Lodge commendable in
the sight of all men, and may God grant you health and
strength, Most Worshipful Grand Master, to continue to carry
out the duties of your high office with credit to yourself, and
to the satisfaction of all.
Wpl. Bro. J. A. Cockburn, G.J.D., in responding to the
toast of the S.A. Constitution, said he was at a loss to under-
stand why this honor should have fallen to his lot, unless it
was that the city brethren with that good taste which had
characterised these proceedings had determined that not only
should members from the country have a large share of the
Grand Lodge offices, but that they should also bear their part
in the toast list of the evening. ' Two years ago, at their
Jamestown Installation Ceremony, he advocated the establish-
ment of a Grand Lodge for South Australia, but the idea was
denounced as absurd, distinguished visitors having said it
would fail if tried. The fact that it had been tried and had
succeeded beyond expectation proved more than words could
do the ability and business tact of the proposer of the toast and
those associated with him, and it was the best augury of success
for the Constitution that these were the men who were enlisted
in its service. They had met for the last time as Lnglish, Irish,
and Scotch Masons. In future they would meet as Masons of
the South Australian Constitution. All present were proud of
the part they had borne in the day?s business. He concluded
a very able and interesting speech by hoping that they would
live to tell their children and many of them their children?s
children of the deeds they had done that day, and on behalf of
the brethren absent, as well as those present, thanked them for
the way in which the toast" had been honored.
Y.W. Bro. Otto Laueenti, Grand Orator, in proposing the


Private Lodges, feared, that the entirely unexpected manner in
which he was called upon to propose this somewhat important
toast, and his consequent inefficiency would detract from the
imaginary halo surrounding the office of ? Orator.? As each sister
Lodge in itself formed a link in the all-encircling chain of Masonry,
the success of the latter naturally depended upon the zeal and
assiduity manifested in its component parts, and one of the
results of that day?s work should be a fraternal recognition of,
and co-operation with each other. As it was the pioneer of
any prosperous young settlement who in after years would
derive the greatest satisfaction from looking back on his
venturesome career and recalling the reminiscences of an eventful
past, so it must be gratifying to those who had identified them-
selves with any great social movement to follow up the
successes that had attended their efforts ; and after the accom-
plishment of an arduous task, the retrospect of difficulties
encountered and obstacles overcome would compensate for the
pains taken in the attainment of the end in view. The growth
of Freemasonry in this colony was not the least important of
its social features, and the establishment of a Grand Lodge of
South Australia had for years been a fondly cherished hope?
regarded by many as a dream whose realisation would have
to be almost indefinitely deferred, and as a consummation not
likely to be witnessed by the present generation. The success
of that day?s celebration, gratifying as it was to the Craft in
general, must be particularly so to those who had been movers
in the scheme, and, although the unanimity happily prevailing
among the various Lodges had considerably eased their work,
they were entitled to the warmest thanks and recognition for
having brought to so successful an issue their great and
difficult undertaking. That was neither the time nor the place
to discuss the question whether the pursuit of Masonry, as a
secret Society, in what might be regarded as essentially an age
of progress, was justifiable and in keeping with the spirit of
the times ?venerable in its antiquity, honorable in its associa-
tions, and laudable in its precepts. Men of all creeds could
afford to ignore it, differing from its outward forms, but they
could not conscientiously fail to pay their tribute of respect
to the moral tone of its teachings, the elevating tendency of
its principles, and the liberality of its doctrines, applicable to
all grades of society, and worthy of emulation by every pulpit


and public platform of morality. The moral welfare of
every nation depended upon the soundness of its social
development, and the responsibility devolving upon those
called upon to act as leaders in any great social movement
was a great one, and their task surrounded by many difficulties.
Although not so conservative in his ideas as to'respect every-
thing and anything for the sake of its antiquity alone, regard-
less of other considerations, he maintained that a science which,
like Masonry, had survived the test of centuries, whose records
dated back to the dark ages, and whose monuments were
unequalled by modern architecture, whose precepts reminded
us of the duties we owed to the Great Architect of the Universe,
to our neighbours, and to ourselves, and taught us how to live,
how to cultivate our faculties, and finally how to die?he believed
a science of that sort worthy of a better fate than to be made
the pretext for mere conviviality, or to degenerate into a
fraternity which only in its outward forms did justice to its
ancient and venerable tenets. All who had the welfare of the
craft at heart would regard the success of the day?s celebration
as a good omen for our future prosperity, and hail with delight
the new basis upon which the order had that day been estab-
lished, affording, as it did, more scape and better facilities for
the local development of the educational and benevolent
branches of the craft, as well as opportunities of proving to the
world at large that although the mother?s apron string had been
severed, this separation did not mean the forfeiture of filial
attachment or culture of antagonistic feelings ; but if any spirit
of rivalry were engendered it would be that of a wholesome
nature and mutually advantageous in vicing with the parent
constitutions to excel in all masonic virtues. He wished the
Private Lodges every success, and would now ask them to drink
to the toast.
Wpl. Bro. Philip Sansom in response to the toast said that
as W.M. of the oldest Lodge in the colony it gave him great
pleasure to respond to the toast of ? Success to the Private
Lodges,? which toast had been so ably and so oratorically pro-
posed by his esteemed friend and brother the Grand Orator,
and at the outset he wished them not to measure his interest in
the success of the sister Lodges by the length of his remarks,
for they would be very brief, as he felt he should be best


consulting their wishes, as well as his own, by making his remarks
at that late hour as brief as possible. The desire expressed by
the proposer that success should attend the Sister Lodges was
fully shared by himself, and he was sure that that feeling was
mutually shared by every Worshipful Master present, as also by
the members of the individual Lodges. That the Lodges would be
successful under the new regime he had no fear, and if there
were one thing more than another which assured him such
would be the case it was the creating of a new office in our
Grand Lodge?the Grand Inspector of Lodges. He felt that
this appointment was a most important one, and if the duties
were carried out as they should be it would help very consider-
ably in achieving that success they all desired so much to see,
for unless a Lodge was properly worked it could not be said to
be successful, and the inspection of our Lodges from time to
time by a competent Inspector would tend towards that end by
ensuring the adoption of a system of uniform working?a con-
summation devoutly to be wished. He was glad the appoint-
ment had fallen on such a worthy and well-qualified brother as
His Worship the Mayor of Port Adelaide, Bro. King, who he
was sure would bring all his Masonic experience to bear in the
discharge of the duties of that important office. He was sure
they all?the Private Lodges?rejoiced in the work they had
perfected that day. There were many general reasons for con-
gratulation on the formation of our Grand Lodge which he was
sure were present to their minds in sufficient force not to
require their enumeration by him, so he would not now refer to
them, but would conclude by hoping that the many beneficial
objects of our order would grow and prosper in all our Lodges,
and that the Grand Lodge they had that day established might
conduce to the advantage and prosperity of Freemasonry was
he felt sure the earnest prayer of all the Private Lodges. He
concluded by apologising for the absence of his co-responder, the
G.D.D.C. Wpl.Bro.T. G. Brown, who, on account of the lateness
of the hour and the exigencies of the train traffic, had been
compelled to leave before this toast was presented.
Wpl. Bro. Wigg, on rising to propose the toast of ? The
Executive Committee, coupled with the name of P.D.G.M.
Bro. H. M. Addison,? said he considered that one of the prin-
cipal toasts, if not par excellence the toast of the evening, as


but for the exertions of the Executive Committee and Bro.
Addison they would not have been gathered together on that
auspicious occasion. Bro. Addison was entitled to receive high
honor, as from him the Grand Lodge of South Australian Free
and Accepted Masons had really risen into life. The members
of the Lodge which he (Bro. Wigg) represented were proud to
number Bro. Addison amongst their P.M.?s, and they now
enjoyed the special distinction of having the first G.M. of the
Grand Lodge of South Australia selected from their Lodge.
The Executive Committee were entitled to their most hearty
thanks, and he trusted they would honor the toast in bumpers
on account of the indefatigable industry they had displayed in
crowning their proceedings by the opening of the Grand Lodge
of South Australia with unexampled success, as they must all
admit had been the case. One last remaining word ?he trusted
that they would all assist Bro Downer, the R.W.D.G.M., to
carry out his important suggestion regarding the establishment
of a Masonic Benevolent Fund.
E.W. Bro. Addison responded.
Y.W. Bro. Webb, G.K., proposed ?The Visitors,? to which
Bro. Tuenee, Port Pirie, responded.
Bro. Otto Laueenti, Grand Orator, in proposing the Press,
said the influence of the Press on any community was
manifest, and at that late hour it would scarcely be necessary
to enlarge upon the responsibilities of those entrusted with the
conduct of public journalism, or to dwell at length on the uses
and abuses of the power vested in them. Suffice it to say,
that enjoying the privileges of a free press, a well conducted
paper, far from being restricted to a mere medium of news and
advertisements, should occupy a higher standard as the mouth-
piece of the people, the popular educator of those who Lad no
other means of acquiring knowledge, and intellectually as the
trainer and guide of those who evinced an interest in social,
political, and scientific matters, not only of local importance,
but concerning the world at large. He thought our leading
papers compared favorably with those of the sister colonies.
With reference to our Masonic publication, the persevering
editor had scarcely received that encouragement he deserved,
and his Ashlar was at times indeed, to him, a Hough one, and


worthy of a little better support at the hands of the brethren,
who should take a pride in supporting, at any rate, one
Masonic journal.
Bro. J. W. Spurr, of the Masonic Record of Western India,
responded.
The singing of ? Auld Lang Syne ? terminated the most suc-
cessful Masonic gathering ever witnessed in South Australia.
