durst not venture. Nine of the Dunse rioters were condemned
to banishment, but the ferment continues violent in the
Merse.”
Mr. Gray was subpoenaed against a tenth rioter. He was
a son of Robie Purvis, a douce, decent tailor. Our author hap-
pened unfortunately to see, from the windows of his father’s
house, the foolish fellow assisting in burning the fragments of
the turnpike gates at the cross. But, fortunately, our author’s
cousin, Simon Paterson, attorney, discovered that Roger Moodie
had made a mistake in the time for supplying the panel with the
indictment, &c.; and when the young rioter was named, he
started up and said “ Here, my lord; but not legally.” He
then stated the fact, that the time was one day less than the
legal time. On inquiry, the court admitted the plea ; and, as
Mr, Gray says on the occasion, “ Though, I believe, to the
regret of the Lord Justice Clerk, as well as of David Hume
(the nephew of the historian), our Berwickshire sheriff, alike to
my joy and old Robie’s, the young rioter was discharged.”

“ The system is population, where we walk with Mr. Gray
in a region peculiarly his own,” —British Critic , Sept. 1815.
“ The promulgation of such new and unpalatable doctrines
(by Mr. Malthus) could not fail to excite doubt and call forth
counter publications, the principal of which have been suc-
cessively noticed in our work. None of the replicants, however,
were successful in shaking the impression produced by the
arguments of Mr. Malthus, supported as they were by extensive
reading and research, until, after a long interval, appeared the
elaborate work of Mr. Gray, on the ‘ Happiness of States/
Monthly Review , July 1819.

political economy in the * Happiness of States ’ after a full

examination prove to be correct, that work will form an era in
the history of the science.”— The Conductor of the Farmer’s
Magazine, 1816.
“ You clearly refute several of the illustrious Smith’s doc-
trines. To this country your labours seem peculiarly adapted.
I have put your book in the bands of several intelligent men,
especially lawyers, who appear to be the only learned body on this
continent. Those whose opinions I can depend on speak highly
of your work. Not having your particular address, I am in-
duced to distinguish you by the title which does honour to your
name and human nature.”— Letter of c 2d January, 1818 ,from
Dr. R., of the United States, to S. Gray, Esq., author of the “ Hap-
piness of States,” London.
“ I return herewith Mr, Gray’s work. Various circum-
stances have tempted me to retain it longer than I expected.
He would far surpass Ricardo or Malthus, if, like them, he con-
fined his inquiries to fewer objects, having an acuteness and
comprehensiveness of perception very rarely united in one mind.
Many of his ideas, if followed out properly, would, no doubt,
lead to most important results in society.”— Letter, 4th Decem-
ber, 1820, to Mr . Smith, Edinburgh, from Mr. Muir, of a Bank-
ing-House in Leith, and author of a u Review of the Banking
System of Britain.”
A third edition is in preparation in 12mo. and on a more

improperly called,) in all its branches ; population, subsistence,
employment, foreign commerce, capital, income, price, money,

tinued in 1825, in consequence of the death
and insolvency of Mr. Constable. One of
them, in 1817, was on Robert Owen’s new
view of society 251
“ Your correspondent, Simon Gray, seems to be a more
rational philosopher, and sound politician, than many who arro-
gate these pompous titles to themselves. He has shewn, with
all the force of mathematical demonstration, that every class of
the community (fixed annuitants, perhaps, alone excepted) are
mutually benefited by the farmer’s receiving an adequate remune-
rating price for his articles; and that every class suffers when
his prices are inadequate. We have bad woful experience of the
truth of this position in this district.” (The county of Forfar.)
“When land produce was at its lowest ebb of depression, many
operative tradesmen and labourers in our towns were purchas-
ing oatmeal by pounds and ounces ; and they never were known
to purchase less than a peck at a time, when meal was at its
highest price. Since our farmers began to receive something
approaching to remunerating prices, every hand that is willing

“ In your paper of Friday, the 11th ult., there is a very sen-
sible letter, signed G. P., on the causes of the present distress.
The writer, I have no doubt, is the author of ‘All Classes
Productive of Wealth/ which book I would recommend every
gentleman, merchant, manufacturer, and tradesman to read,
although I never heard of the author .until I purchased the
book.”— Letter in the “ Courier ,” dated 1 6th February, 1820, from

the Result found to be, that Population
regulates Subsistence, and not Subsistence
Population; while the Increase of Popula-

produce Poverty and Distress, is the Grand
Source of the Permanent Increase of Wealth,

and Happiness. Bvo 517

“His erudition is extensive and his views cheering; and
those who attempt to establish the position that population is
the regulator of subsistence, not subsistence of population, are
entitled to the thanks of every benevolent mind."— Monthly
Review , Sept, 1819.
14 Mr. Gray thinks there cannot be too many people—Mr.
Maltbus that there cannot be too few.”— .Ensor concerning the
Population of Nations, p 256.
14 I thank you for a very acute, sensible, and valuable com-
position. It is the work of a master who has seen with his
own eyes, heard with his own ears, and reflected, considered,
and judged, with his own mind. I cannot venture to assert
that I am master of the subject, or of the question, hut I think
I feel myself competent to say, this is a good book.”— From a
Letter, dated Nov . 22, 1818, Trinity Lodge, Cambridge, from the
Bishop of Bristol to Dr, Macleod , author of 44 The Voyage of the
Alceste.”
“ It was suggested to me by Mr. Malthus (on my visit to
him) that the leading principle maintained in it is the same in
substance with that of a work on population by Mr. Gray.”—
Everett's 44 New Ideas on Population ,” 1823.
“ What, then, is our conclusion in regard to Mr. Gray’s
doctrine of the tendency of income to increase along with popu-
lation? That it is no less sound and accurate than it is cheer-
ing.”—Lewes' 44 Present State of England ,” p. 234.

Mr. Berry, the proprietor and editor of the Magazine, takes
the following notice of the cause of there being no article of
mine in the May number“ A long and severe indisposition
which, at one period, threatened a fatal termination, must
account for the silence in the present number of our valued
correspondent, Simon Gray, Esq., and of the absence of that
interest in our pages which his important contributions have
never failed to confer. The sincere regret, however, which
accompanies this announcement, is not a little assuaged by the
gratification that a progressive convalescence holds out a hope,
that in our next number we shall be enabled to resume those
sound and unanswerable articles, which have secured the writer
a reputation the more solid and permanent, because grounded
on right thinking ; and the more valuable and useful, because
advanced at a period when the popular fallacies of theorists and
economistical pamphlet-writers call loudly for the counteracting
influence of orthodox principles to combat and refute.” —May

On the cover of the May number are the following remarks
from the editor, “In this number there are some papers of
considerable importance. Mr. Gray’s first paper is a summary
view of the circumstances which have alternately raised and
depressed our national affairs during the last fifteen years. It
is corroborative of much that has been heretofore advanced by
that gentleman in this and other publications. We sincerely
congratulate our agricultural and manufacturing readers, that
the principles so ably advocated by Mr, Gray are beginning at
last to make an impression in the proper quarter. Many able
pens have been lately wielded to substantiate his views respect-
ing the currency, and other important national interests. Sta-
tistical knowledge is becoming a more fashionable study j and
it taust be gratifying to Mr. Gray that he has made so many
converts.”

PRINCIPLES Demonstrated, and VIEWS Developed, in the
Works of the Catalogue, for the most part NEW or
ORIGINAL.*
%* The Numbers at the close of the Articles point out those on the
Catalogue profiled to the Works , in which the respective Subjects are
discussed .
Criticism .
J. Every species of composition is under strict dramatic law, or the
law of imitation; for all species of writing are imitations of the modes
of speaking of one class or other in real life. This is the foundation
principle of all sound criticism. 108,109.
2. Stories, fictitious facts, and persona , mustsrem to be real in order
to be felt or reckoned real, and to produce similar effects on the reader,
hearer, or spectator, as the realities of actual life. 34,108, 112,
3. To be strictly accurate copies of actual portions of nature is
not necessary. It is sufiicient that they seem to the hearer, reader, or
spectator, to be what they pretend to be. As 2.
4. Nature in imitation, or in literature, painting, &c., is thus the
same as nature in real life. As 2.
5. But as the object of the imitator, whether dramatist, novelist,
or painter, is to effect a certain purpose, that purpose determines him
in his choice. He may, therefore, leave out what is really natural,
because it does not suit his specific purpose, or would mar it. His
nature is selected or elegant nature. But though he may leave out
what is really a portion of nature, what be does select must appear to
be nature. As 2.
6. What is called taste, or the literary sense, is the reasoning faculty
applying its perceptions, or decisions, to works in the various species
of literature. 108.
7. All the languages and dialects of the world are dialects of, or
♦ Those quoted are either fundamental or of chief importance.

1. The good of a community depends essentially on the great mass
of its people being influenced by sound religious motives. A state,
therefore, is bound by a just regard for itself to have, as far as it is in
its power, pure religion, or genuine religious principles, embraced by,
and consequently taught to, the people. 43.
2. But in the case of virtue and religion, the demand and supply are
in states directly opposite to that in which they are found in other
cases ; or, in the inverse ratio the greater the need for the supply of
these, the less is the demand for them . 43.
3. The voluntary system of supply, with respect to religion and
virtue, is thus utterly vicious and unfit. The nation must, therefore, as
a state, do that for the great mass which they will not do for them-
selves.
4. The mass of a community consists of the lower, more unedu-
cated, ignorant, and prejudiced classes. It cannot, therefore, be a fit
chooser of the teachers of religion and virtue. Popular election is
thus injurious, and to be avoided. The choice ought to be in a patron,
or a small number of educated and responsible men. 43.
5. No candidate can be, or ought to be, eligible, unless found fit,
or fully qualified in point of education, talents, morals, and manners,
for a religious teacher, by a proper examiner, or examiners: for ex-
ample — a bishop, as in England ;or a presbytery of ministers, as in
Scotland. But, if he be found fully qualified, the nomination to a
parish is, on the whole, best in a patron, who is the chief contributor
to his support. 43.
6. Endowing sectarian creeds of any sort is unscriptural. It is
also injudicious and injurious. The Bible, or the New Testament,
should be the sole creed of a national church. It is then a Christian
church. 43.
Education .
The grand object of education is to cultivate the reasoning faculty,
and to exercise and improve itj or to teach the pupil to reason
rationally or wisely. 80.


Morals,
1. Happiness, in one form or another, is the object of men in acting,
or refraining from acting. 50, 69,119.
2. Pure morality or virtue is the plan of true happiness, as far as
this is dependent on the will. 69*
3. A man’s real happiness is, therefore, the moral obligation on
him. 69.
4. He is so formed that he cannot be happy without wishing and
endeavouring to make others happy. 69.
5. Man is thus neither wholly selfish, nor wholly unselfish. He is
a mixture of self-feeling and fellow-feeling. 54, 69.
6. All the passions and emotions which tend to do good are pleas-
ing, and tend to make the agent happy. All those that tend to do ill
are painful, and tend to make him uncomfortable. 54, 69, 188.
7. What is called conscience , or the moral sense, is the reasoning
faculty applying its perceptions or decisions to thoughts or actions
connected with right or wrong; that is, with doing good or doing
harm. 69.
8. The will is, of itself, from its very nature, a grand self-acting
cause. Motives are not causes to it, but the means, objects, or
reasons, which it chooses to adopt for acting or refusing to act.
54, 69.
9. Whatever be the bias, or temptation, arising from habits, present
circumstances, &c., to act in a certain way, the will can, in all cases,
choose to act in that or any other. Accordingly it can, in every case
against all that opposes, determine to act or to refrain from acting
according to what its reason perceives or decides to be right. As 8.
10. Man is thus, from his nature, a responsible agent. As 6.
Music •
1. The essence of true music is a strain of sounds which produces,
in one form or another, what I call sweet melancholy, or a pleasing
plaintiveness. This uniformly rouses musical sensation. 32.
2. Melody or tune, that is, a regular condensed strain of those
sounds, alone produces this. 32.
3. Harmony, which is a concord in tones, merely assists melody.
It does not of itself produce musical sensation. Without melody, or
a strain of those sounds, harmony can create no such feeling. But by


increasing in some cases the power of melody, it makes the influence
and effect of the latter more palpable and strong. 32.
Politics, or the Science of Government,
1. There is no right to power in society.
2. All power is a mere privilege, and when just or proper, conferred
for the good of society. Thus the privilege of a hereditary king, such
as the British, stands on the same basis as the privilege of the peers
or hereditary senators; the privilege of the elected, or temporary
legislators; and the privilege of the electors of the latter, and of any
other office possessing power. 48, 50, 52,
3. The Proper intention of government is the good, not of a
portion, but the whole of the community. 50, 52.
4. It is this great principle which determines every privilege,
institution, or measure, to be proper or improper, good or bad. As 3.
5. In all species of government, from the nature of men, there is a
tendency to the threefold cast of form. 52.
6. There can be no genuine or permanent liberty without indepen•
dent mutual control in the government itself. 48,52.
7. All species of governments without this, whether they be of the
monarchical, aristocratical, or democratical form,, are absolute govern-
ments. From being thus uncontrolled, or not controlled sufficiently,
they are in their nature hostile to true liberty and its spirit. They are
despotic. 52.
8. The lower, poorer, less educated, more ignorant, and prejudiced
classes, being by many times the most populous in every community,
even the wealthiest, the principle on which democracy is built, the
majority of mere number , is evidently a rotten basis. 50, 52, 157.
9. It is also a most injurious principle. It puts the power of
electing into the hands of the most unfit for making a wise choice. It
thus renders the state a kakistocracy, or a government by the worst.
As 8,
10. It also increases the evil by ensuring, through the agency of
such selectors, the success of violent and unprincipled demagogues.
Sooner or later the democracy becomes a demagoguecraey.
11. A representative democracy of the modern kind seems to have
the same spirit, character, and results, as the ancient popular sort.
48, 52.


12. A Republic is a government which gives full, complete, and
equal protection to the persons and properties of all classes alike—
high, middle, and low*. 52.
13. A democracy, therefore, never can be a real republic. It is a
mere nominal one ; but a real despotism, formed of the lower classes,
directed by their demagogues of the day—.particularly the chief one,
who is the head of the largest faction in the state. 52.
14. The British form of government, from the correct mutual
independent control in its three natural estates, accomplishes the pur-
pose of a good government or republic effectively and completely.
From its nature it gives the ruling influence to no portion exclusively,
but to the real people—to the respectable and well-informed of all
classes. 52.
15. It is the only true example of a genuine republic ever yet
exhibited to mankind.* 52,157.
Statistics—Wealth*
1. The science of Statistics is capable of mathematical demonstra-
tion, or arithmetical proof, as to its leading principles, or tendencies,
with respect to population, subsistence, employment, prices, money,
and wealth : but, in consequence of the imperfection and voluntariness
of the agents, not as to strict quantities, 119,157,181,
2. The entire circulation of supplies in a community being carried
on by mutual charging, or charge for charge : one charging on others
for what they want from him, and they charging on him for what he
wants from them, the amount of charging must be the amount of the
wealth of the community. As 1.
3. Cn arc lability, which, when rated in money is called price, is
thus the source and measure of wealth; by which is meant the medium
of obtaining necessaries and comforts. It is, in fact, Wealth itself.
As 1.
4. The more various the classes, and the more they charge on, that
is draw from, one another—in other words, the higher their average
* Those which have been copied from it have advanced towards,
or come short of, practical perfection, according as they have more or
less completely adopted its principles.


rates of charging, or of prices, the more they return, and of course the
wealthier is the community. And vice vend, the less they charge or
draw, the less they return; or the lower their average rates of charging
or of prices, the more unwealthy or poorer it must be. 119, 157,
159, 181.
5. The amount of chargeability in a country forms the amount of
its reproducing power, or the means of future employment and charging.
As 4.
6. Charging forms a common fund, consisting of what all put in,
and by which all pay themselves by drawing out, 119.
7. This fund of wealth keeps increasing with an increase of popu-
lation ; and, on the average, in a proportion more or less greater than
that of the latter. As 4.
8. As the more all draw out the more they all return, there can be
no ne plus ultra in the increase of wealth. As 4.
'Employment,
1. With the increase of population, the wants of men increase, and
employments become more varied. 119,157,159,181.
2. And also more productive to the community. For every new
employment draws bands from the other lines, and thus it gives those
that remain more employment. As 1.
3. And thus, also, it tends to improve their prices. As 1.
4. All sorts of employments and their products, whatever be their
character, if they possess chargeability—and they must cease to exist if
they do not —are, to its amount, productive of wealth to the individual,
the class, and the country. As 1.
5. All classes are thus alike really productive of wealth to a com-
munity, and they increase its productive power to the amount of their
respective incomes. As 1.
6. Employments and classes may be, and are, comparatively, more
or less productive; but there can be no natural unproductiveness on
nature’s system. As 1.
7. Reduction with respect to employment tends to diminish the
wealth of a country. Much as it has been eulogised for being bene-
ficial to the industrious classes, every shilling of reduction robs the
working classes and the community of a shilling’s worth of employ-
ment. 170, and as 1.


Machinery ,
1. The employment of machinery diminishes the demand for human
bands in one way, by supplying partly their place; but from the cir-
cumstances connected with it in its formation, &c,, it increases that
demand much more in another. 119, 157,181.
2. It lowers the price of its products; but from its peculiar cha-
racter it does not impoverish its employers, or lower either wages or
profits. It tends to improve both. As 1.
3. It thus, on the whole, tends greatly to increase the demand for
human labour. As 1.
International Commerce .
1. The proper directing principle of the commerce between nations
is mutual Beneficiality, 119,157, 159, 181.
2. Freedom and restriction are mere modes—not principles. And it
depends on the beneficiality of either in the given case whether, and to
what extent, it should be adopted. As 1.
3. There cannot be a constantly increasing balance of trade on one
side, between countries. As. 1.
4. There may be such a balance between one country and one or
two of its foreign connexions. But to compensate this, there must be
a balance of an opposite kind with some others. For with respect to
any nation and all its foreign connexions, there must be, and is, a
uniform tendency in the sums total of its exports and imports, on the
average of years, to balance each other. As 1.
5. It does not, however, follow from this, that it makes no differ-
ence whether a nation buys products from foreign suppliers or its own.
Whatever be the amount of its imports, there will be a tendency in its
exports to balance them. But though there will be a balancing, the
amount will be greatly diminished by injuring its own suppliers, and
diminishing their power to buy. 157, 180.
6. There is an essential difference between reciprocity and com-
petition in international commerce : that is, between nations supplying
one another with what one wants and another produces, and competing
to sell what both produces. The former is uniformly beneficial; the
latter as uniformly injurious. 119, 157, 180, 181.
7. To purchase from another nation what its own people fully sup-


ply, because lower-priced, according to Adam Smith’s principles, is to
create a ruinous competition injurious to both. The opening of tho
British market in 1826 to the French silk-weaver has been most
seriously injurious both to the British and the French, As 6.
Competition,
1. Competition in a fair degree is beneficial; but beyond that it
becomes more and more injurious; and when excessive, it is ruinous
to all parties. 119,167.
Income and Capital ,
1. Income, and capital which is saved from it, increase with the
increase of population and populousness; and, cecteris paribus, in a ratio
more or less greater than the increase of the latter. 119, 157, 169, 181.
2. National service capital, or what is commonly called national
debt, is capital which really adds to the productive power, wealth and
employment of the nation, like any other capital invested in land, in
manufactures, in building, &c. In its investing it creates employment
to its amount. It is counter-charged for in prices. And the expend-
ing of the income derived from it, like that of every other species of
capital, reproduces employment, income, and comforts. As 1.
Money and Money Capital.
1. Money, or exchanging counters, is the measure, not the regu-
lator, of prices, 119, 157, 167, 131.
2. It is the artificial measure of value, as the yardwand is a measure
of length, and the pound a measure of weight. As 1.
3. The amount of it in circulation is the effect, not the cause, of
the variations in prices. As 1.
4. This amount is generally found to be from fifteen to twenty per
cent on the income of a country. As 1.
5. It is an artificial medium, and the material of it is of no natural
importance. It is sufficient that it is voluntarily taken. Custom will
soon do all the rest. Silver, gold, and paper, have been found to be
eminently popular with civilised nations. As 1.
6. A standard value affixed to money is of great utility. As 1.
62
PRINCIPLES AND VIEWS


7. But though silver and gold, from having been generally fixed on
from early times, are useful as being made the medium of the standard,
actual pieces of them cannot be the standard. Like other articles,
their market value is changeable. It cannot, therefore, be a fixed
standard. As 1.
8. But paper money representing them, or a money of account sort
of imaginary silver or gold, is fitted for being a perfect standard.
Not only can the weight and fineness of them be fixed as in actual
silver and gold, but the price also. It thus becomes a perfect standard,
and measures the fluctuations of actual gold and silver themselves.
As 1.
9. Voluntary paper-money, like the British, or that which is
returnable on the issuer at the will of the holder, and thus is regulated
by the demand, is indepreciable. As 1.
10. Gold and silver coins should be of a fixed even weight and a
settled fineness ; but their price not being fixable, while that of paper
money is, they should be convertible with the latter at their market
price. As 1.
11. Metal money is unproductive circuland to the issuer and to
the nation; but paper-money is fairly productive of profit to both.
As 1.
12. Though money, as mere money , has no influence on prices,
money-capital, or money used or lent as capital, has; and frequently a
very powerful one. The liberal accommodation of this to spirited and
industrious men tends strongly to increase employment, improve
prices, and add to wealth. On the other hand, a contraction of this
tends to produce derangement, diminution of employment, depression
of prices, and distress. As 1.
The Exchanges.
1. There is no fixed par of exchange. Nor can there be, for no
article is by nature of a fixed value. The prices of gold and silver in
different countries are variable. 119, 157, 181,
2. The customary artificial, or supposed par, is operated on by these
variations. As 1.
3. The quantum of paper-money in circulation has no regulating
effect whatever on the course of exchange. As 1.


Price.
1. Price is made up of the charges of individuals for food, clothing,
lodging, service, teaching, amusement, &c. 119, 157, 167, 181.
2. As the increase of population augments employment, wealth,
and comforts, on the average in a ratio greater than its own, price-rates,
on a universal average, have a tendency to advance with the increase
of population. As 1.
3. Price being the medium hy which employment, income, and
comforts, are paid, price, income, employment, and comforts, mutually
represent each other or correspond in amount. They measure each
other. As 1. •
4. There is thus an essential connexion between the price-rates and
the wealth and comforts of a district or country. The price-rates of
either will represent its general style of living. As 1.
5. The richer a district or country, the higher will be the rates of
its prices, and vice versa. As t.
6. A district or country being thus richer or poorer according to its
average price-rates, of course, cateris paribus , as these rise, the district
or country grows richer, and it grows poorer according as they fall.
As 1.
7. In sum, districts or countries are comparatively richer or poorer,
according as their average price-rates are higher or lower. As 1.
The Poor .
1. The permanent increase of wealth being derived from the
increase of population, and the latter depending chiefly on the early
marriage of the great body of the poorer classes, these are thus, at the
hazard of individual failure in consequence of marrying, chief agents
in adding to the means of wealth of the community. In case of failure,
therefore, they have a full and just claim on the wealth of the country
which they have assisted so materially in creating, to save them from
destitution. 119,157,160.
2. The destitute should be relieved wherever found. As 1.
3. Settlement is not only cruel but injurious in many points of
view. It should, therefore, be rejected. And the rate for relieving
the poor should be a national one. As 1.


Population.
1. Population, from the nature of man, in all ordinary circumstances,
has an uniform tendency to increase. 119, 157, 160.
2. It thus affords an actual practical proof of a God, or a creator.
In tracing population back we must arrive at a unity, or a beginning
of man's existence ; and of course the express interference of a creator*
119.
3. The rate of the increase of population depends on the circum-
stances with respect to fecundativeness and populativeness in which it
is placed. As 1.
4. The more temperately a population lives, or the nearer to bare
subsistence, in general, the more fecundative or productive of children
it is. As 1.
5. The increase of population, by giving existence to more varied
wants, as well as the means of supplying them, necessarily increases
employment according to an increasing ratio • Far from tending to over-
stock, as the antipopulationists imagine, it distributes an additional
quantum of employment among its classes and individuals. As 1.
6. It thus tends to raise prices and augment wealth. As 1.
7. The denser a population the richer is it found to be. Towns are
richer the larger they are, and more wealthy than the country; and
the more populous countries are, cateris paribus, they are more wealthy.
As 1.
8. Thus there is found to be a perpetual emigration from the
country to town, from less populous districts in a country to the more
populous. With few, if any, exceptions, the thinner peopled a district
or country is, cateris paribus , the greater is the emigration from it;
and the thicker peopled either is, the greater the immigration to it.
As 1.
9. The increase of population is thus the grand source of the
permanent increase of wealth. As 1.
10. And of civilisation, of arts, and sciences, the progress of the
intellect, and the means of happiness. As 1.
11. With an increasing population, government revenue keeps in-
creasing like that of the nation. The same taxes will consequently pro-
duce an annually increasing total. Taxes may thus be diminished, or
repealed, to a certain amount, and yet the revenue will he ns great, or


greater, than before. This has been constantly exemplified in Britain
since the peace. 119,157,160.
12, The United States of America, which have been relied upon by
Malthus and other antipopulationists for the proof of the subsistence
theory, as well as of the over-stocking theory, form a country which, of
all others, affords the most decisive proof of the falsehood of these
theories, and of the truth of the productive theory respecting population
and the results of its increase. Their population has increased at least
seventeen times faster than the population of the whole earth ; and yet
they export subsistence; and they have made a more rapid progress
with respect to wealth and employment than perhaps any country on
the globe. 119, 160,
Subsistence,
1. Subsistence has no rate of increase of its own. Its increase
depends on that of population. 119, 160.
2. Instead of regulating population, as Malthus supposed, popula-
tion, after it reaches the cultivating state, regulates subsistence, as fully
as any other branch of the supply. As 1.
3. The higher the price of bread, in general, the greater is the
consumption of that necessary. 119.
4. An excess of food has a defecundative tendency. As 1.
5. Two acres of land, if cultivated to the average fertility of thirty-
two bushels of wheat per acre, or what is equivalent to that, will feed,
on the average of the rich and the poor, one person ; or a square mile
will subsist 320 persons. 119.
6. This may be taken as about a fair average for temperate climates-
And on this average Britain, at the rate of the increase of her popula-
tion for the last forty years, will reach her complement, or that amount
beyond which she cannot feed more, in about seventy years. As 1.
7. On a general average of all sorts of lands and climates, the com-
plement of the dry land of earth, or what it 'can subsist, with the aid
which the water, seas, lakes, and rivers, can afford, may be taken at one
person to three acres, or about 213 per square mile. 119, 160.
8. The complement of the earth’s population, on this average, will
be about eight thousand millions. Of these, it has probably not yet
reached one thousand millions, or the eighth part. 119.


Some Leading Universals.
1. Happiness is the universal pursuit of men. It is thus the sole
true standard of the value of things. 119.
2. Chargeability is the sole wealth in exchange. 119.
3. All such wealth being necessarily derived by men mutually
from one another, all classes are, by the laws of nature, alike really
productive of wealth to the community. 119.*
4. Mutual independent control is absolutely necessary to a per-
manently good government and genuine liberty. 52.
5. The great majority of men being uneducated, ignorant, pre-
judiced, and liable to be led astray, every government which is founded
on universal election is, from the nature of things, a kakistocracy, or a
government by the worst or most unfit. 52.
6. What is moral, tends to happiness; what is immoral, tends to
the contrary. 69.
7. Every species of writing is subject to the dramatic law, or that
of imitation : the imitation of speaking in real life in its corresponding
varieties. 108.
8. What is nature in literature is formed of selections from the
nature of real life. 108.
9. Melody alone, or a condensed regular strain of sweetly plaintive
sounds, produces true musical sensation. 32.
10. The increase of population is the grand source of the permanent
increase of wealth, of employment, of civilisation, of discovery, of the
arts and sciences, of the general progress of the intellect, of the means
of happiness. 119,182.
* Even the “ Edinburgh Review”has at length given in as to this
grand fundamental principle of nature’s statistics. It stigmatises the
notion on which Adam Smith’s theory, and the hypothesis of the vari-
ous sects of economists are founded, as a fallacy, "His (Smith’s)
famous division of the classes of society into productive and unpro-
ductive, of which the fallacy has been better exposed by no one than
his present editor.”— Ed. Rev, vol. Ixx. p. 434, Jan. 1840.
