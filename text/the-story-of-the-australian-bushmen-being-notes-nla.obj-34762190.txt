PREFACE.
There are many books about the Soaith African
War—but none about the Australian Bushmen’s Con-
tingents. I have often been urged by Australians and
Rhodesians-—who campaigned with us—to write some
account of our campaign. This book specially deals
with the work of the Ist Regiment of Australian Bush-
men, but incidentally much is introduced about other
troops with whom we were from time to time brigaded.
When we took our place in the South African Field
Force, we were only a small factor in the operations of
the war; but the movement which culminated in the
despatch of the Bushmen to South Africa was a large
event on the Australian horizon. Moreover, it was a
circumstance fraught with far-reaching issues not to be
ignored by Australians or by those across the seas—
citizens of the Empire, of which the Australian Common-
wealth is but a part —who have learnt to read the signs
of the times. My hope is that this brief story may
help to preserve so interesting and patriotic a chapter
in onr Imperial history in the minds of the people.
I take this opportunity to thank Messrs. J. Fairfax
and Sons for permission to make use of some of the
letters I contributed to the Sydney Morning Herald
from the seat of war.

THE STORY OF THE
AUSTRALIAN BUSHMEN.
CHAPTER I.
“THE CALL TO ARMS.”
Blood is thicker than water,
And that within our veins
Is the same that makes the pulses beat
On broad Australian plains ;
The same that warms Canadian hearts,
In spite of winter snow ;
The same that throbs in many a breast
Where tropic breezes blow.
Kindred in speech and race are we
With the Brothers that came from over the sea.
COL. A. F. B. WRIGHT.
Christmastide has been an unlucky time for us
during the Boer War ; perhaps the Christmas of 1899
is the most dismal in our history. The British forces
under General Buller in Natal, and under Generals
Methuen and Gateacre in Cape Colony, had been hurled
back with great loss, and sad news had come to man\
a home in the Empire. The public began to realise
that in this South African War we had undertaken a
greater task than was at first anticipated. The foe
was brave, wary, original in method, and untrammelled
by precedent or officialism.


Moreover, the strength of the Boers in men and
armament was beyond our expectations, and the know-
ledge of the country and native races which they possessed
was an advantage which well-nigh doubled their strength,
considering the long line of communications which the
British advance necessitated.
How to face the situation was a problem which was
felt throughout the whole Empire.
Was it possible to find an irregular soldiery with the
same power of initiative and resource, the same freedom
from the bias of the drill-book and barrack-square within
our own territory? The answer to this problem was
soon forthcoming, and it was manifold.
Great Britain answered by sending the Imperial
Yeomanry; Canada by raising Strathconas Horse,
Cape Colony, Natal, and Rhodesia sent their Volun-
teers; the Uitlandexs banded themselves together m
the South African Light Horse; New Zealand des-
patched. the Rough Riders —the answer of Australia was
the Bushmen.
They were all men who could ride and shoot. The
credit of initiating the idea belongs to some of the far-
seeing and patriotic squatters of New South W ales
They knew the Bushmen. “These men,’’ said they, in
their letters to the newspapers, “have bushcraft—they
can drive a mob of cattle for hundreds of miles acioss
mountain, plain, or river to a given point. They are
used to roughing it in the open. They can get their
own food, and cook it; and, if need be, they can live
on ‘the smell of an oil-rag for a time. they would excel
in capturing horses and cattle- In short,’ said they,
“the Bushmen will play the Boers at their own game.


The public, following the generous example of these
men who initiated the movement, supported their
opinions by their gifts, and £50,000 was quickly sub-
scribed in New South Wales towards raising and support-
ing the Bushmen’s Regiment. The money subscribed
in the Mother Colony was enough to equip and horse
the regiment, which was about 600 strong, and keep
them in the field for six months.
The South Australian and the Tasmanian Com-
mittees accomplished the same object with their smaller
Contingents. In the other Colonies this aspect of the
movement was not pushed, and the Government in each
case kept control of the movement from the beginning.
The Imperial Government readily accepted the offer of
the troops, and in February, 1900, the transports “Atlan-
tian,” “Maplemore,” “Duke of Portland. and the
“Euryalus" carried from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Hobart, and Fremantle, a total force of 1100
men and horses to South Africa.
The whole Australian continent was raised to a
high state of enthusiasm by the despatch of this Con-
tingent. Special trains brought people from the interior
to see the Bushmen off; specially-chartered tugs and
launches followed them out to sea. It was felt that
the men were truly representative and characteristic of
the Colonies. They were Australians of the Bush —
squatters, boundary-riders, shepherds, shearers, and pros-
pectors, sent out largely by Australian money, and
followed by Australian hopes and ambitions, for they
represented not only the new-born Imperialist senti-
ment of the young Australian States—all anxious to
share the trials of the Mother Country—but they were


freighted also with the credit of many a back-block
township and station, and many a miners’ camp; they
were followed, too, by prayers from many a homestead
and shanty lying away back in the solitude of the vast
Australian Bush.
That the men on board the “Maplemore” were true
Bushmen was very soon apparent. They knew more
about the points of a horse than the parts of a ship..
When we were lying in Neutral Bay, Port Jackson, we
had the little island upon which Fort Macquarie is built
upon our quarter. During the night we swung round
with the tide, and of course had the island on the other
side in the morning
This alarmed one of the “Bushies,” who came to his
officer and said, “Sir, there’s something wrong with this
ship. Last night that there island was on that side of
the ship, and now it’s shifted right round here.”
During the early days of the voyage some of the men
were constantly making mistakes in the matter of parad-
ing on the wrong side of the vessel. Those ordered to
parade on the port side very often turned up on the star-
board side. One of the officers correcting the mistake
said to a trooper, “You should be on the near side of the
ship, not the offside.
“Oh,” said the Bushman, “Why didn’t you put it
that way before, and I would have known.”
After that “nearside” and “offside” of the ship were
common phrases. Perhaps the men drawn from “the
way-back” country of the Australian interior, some of
whom had never seen the railway and many of whom had
never seen the sea until they volunteered for the Bush-
men’s Contingent, provide as good raw material out of


which to make fighters as can be found in the world, but you
cannot expect to get officers who are also bushmen to lead
them at a few weeks’ notice. Officers must have two things—
breeding and training. It was a revelation to find that
all over Australia there were a good many men of the
right class. Men who had given up their commissions
in the Imperial Army to enter pastoral pursuits in Aus-
tralia, and who thus had now the double advantage of
drill and bushcraft, offered themselves in plenty. Others
who had seen a good deal of volunteer work came from
the country to camp, and when we sailed from Fre-
mantle we had on board, as officers, representatives of
the Imperial Army and Navy, nearly all the Universities
at home and in the Colonies, and some of the historic
public schools of England, besides officers of the Aus-
tralian permanent forces. It is only an occasion of this
sort which shows what unexpected strength of fighting
material Australia possesses. That our officers were
good men and true is amply proved by searching the lift
of promotions and decorations. All voyages on troop-
ships are very much alike. There is the usual pro-
gramme of drill, sports, church parades and concerts.
You are living on a floating barracks, and worse luck ! a
floating stable too when you are outward bound. Your
day is divided by the bugle calls. Mess orderlies draw
rations after the bugle has sounded—
“ Come to the cook-house door, 'Boys.”
That meals are ready is indicated by the welcome re-
frain—
“ Hot potatoes, hot potatoes,
Pick em up, pick ’em up.”


The officers’ dinner is announced by the mess-cad,
which conveys the cheerful fact that—
“ Officers’ wives have puddings and pies,
Soldiers’ wives have skilly"
“Smoko" is dismissed by the cease-firing call—
“ Let ’em alone, let ’em alone,’’
when troopers put their pipes out and return to work.
The most exciting call on board is the “alarm” (prepare
for cavalry). This means fire. We only heard this, how-
ever, when we had fire-drill. Even the horses were fed
to the sound of the bugle, and they knew the call as well
as the men. It was interesting to see the horses on the
tether—looks of lively expectation, whinnying and paw.
ing, as with their eyes cn the feed they awaited the
psychological moment when the bugle rang out the sig-
nal to feed up.
Under the wise discipline of Major Savage, 0.C.,
under the kind treatment of Capt. Trenary, the comman-
der of the ship, we had a good voyage, and reached Cape-
town early in April.
At Capetown you arc in the centre of the Soutti
African crisis, and you see things in connection with the
Boer war from the inside. The very first impression you
get is an enlarged conception of the power of Britain.
Here are gathered fleets of great four-masted ocean
tramps and mail liners side by side. You see at one
wharf our old friend the Au-trat Look around ! There
is an Atlantic White Star liner, twice as big. The Clan
line, the Castle line, the Dominion line, the Royal Mail
line, the P. and O. line, the “saints" —St. Dunstan and
St. Andrew, ride at anchor with the “mores"—Prinsmore
and Maplemore, and so on, rank upon rank, all round the


bay, and every dock full. The cry is “still they come,"
for three or four times each day another huge transport
steams quietly into the bay lined with troops, and loaded
with guns, stores, and deck upon deck of horses or mules.
No other Power in the world could do it. JEvery mail
line has yielded its share of ships to the firm of John
Bull and Co., and the business on hand has to be finished.
When you land you see traction engines steaming away
with from six to nine long waggons of stores, teams of
horses and mules at work, driven by Cape boys, all under
transport officers, who go about their work with a quiet
efficiency which is admirable. The many-sided ability
of the Army and Navy is obvious. We were brought off
the transport in a launch managed by a soldier, and you
can see naval officers trotting round the docks on polo
ponies managing things in vigorous style. At every dock
and wharf there are armed sentries, and things are man
aged in a strict military way, no one passing unless he
wears the Queen’s uniform or is on business Then you
see the ability of the Briton to rule.
The population is a many-coloured cosmopolitan
crowd—ltalian fishermen, Zulu rickshaw men, Kaffir ser-
vants, Calcutta hawkers, and gaudily-dressed Malays, as
well as representatives of every African tribe, all woven
into a web of British rule, and excepting the wily Boer,
I
satisfied.
I must speak a word of admiration for the splendid
Zulu. To see him trotting away with his rickshaw is a
picture. His physique is perfect and his dress pictur
esque. Two white horns rise above his ears, fixed in
some mysterious way in his wool, and surrounded by
chains of little shells. Round his ankles he wears chains
THE CALL TO ARMS.


of big shells. His blue and white tunic leaves his mus-
cular chest exposed, and his cotton pants finish at the
knees with a red, white, and blue border, and coloured
braids fly loose from shoulders and knees. Though it is
no easy work hauling his light rickshaw along he always
steps high and goes along at a proud pace like a high-
spirited horse, and even when his “fare’' has alighted, to
do shopping perhaps, his restless temperament shows
itself in his walking to and fro while he waits, and when
he looks at you his eye seems to flame.
But we were not to disembark here. We got our
orders for Beira. We were to join General Sir F. Car-
rington's Rhodesian Field Force which was intended,
first, to reinforce Col. Plumer in order to relieve Mar-
king, to hold Rhodesia in case of a Boer trek northward,
and ultimately to enter the Transvaal for the north and
western frontiers.
There was a great march of 1200 miles before us,
largely through malarial anl fever country, but the men
were satisfied, and proud of the programme. Major Dan-
gar, the second-in-command of the New South Wales
Bushmen, who had come out from London, joined us
here. The “Atlantian” sailed first, and after having
taken aboard a supply of Lee-Enfield rifles, ammunition,
tents and other warlike stores, the “Maplemore sailed
out of Table Bay. We were closely followed by the
“Euryalus,” with the Victorians, which in turn was tol-
lowel by the “Duke of Portland,” having on board the
Queenslanders.
Wc now learnt that arrangements had been made to
divide the Bushmen’s Contingent into three regiments—
the Ist Regiment Australian Bushmen, composed of


N.S.W. men, to be commanded by Lt.-Col. Airey, D.S.O.
the 2nd Regiment Australian Bushmen, composed of Vic-
torians and West Australians, to be commanded by
Major Vialls; and the 3rd Regiment Australian Bush-
men, composed of Queenslanders, commanded by Major
Tunbridge. Afterwards circumstances arose which led to
the formation of another regiment, called the “Compo-
site Regiment of Australian Bushmen”; it was after-
wards made up of the South Australian and Tasmanian
units with “D” Squadron of the N.S.W. Bushmen, and
was commanded by Major Baker. This regiment did
splendid work under the Earl of Errol and Lord Meth-
uen.
We came to an anchorage off Beira immediately
after the “Atlantian,” just beating the “Euryalus” in a
race for the second of the two pilots.
On the 11th of April our four transports, with the
whole of the Bushmen, lay alongside each other at the
mouth of the Pungwe River.


CHAPTER II.
IN PORTUGUESE TERRITORY.
Beira is one of the most picturesque places a man
can see. As you sail into the bay you are somewhat
surprised to see good buildings roofed with French
tiles, and up-to-date landing jetties with railway and
cranes at work round the wharfs. When you get
into the town and discover that many of these appar-
ently fine structures are built of corrugated iron, and
that stowed away in odd cornel's of the place there are
many shanties of the “sardine-tin and biscuit-box style,
your wonder is in no wise lessened, for you remember
that the town is only about eight years old.
It is another surprise to find shops, banks, and all
public institutions indicated on the signboards in
English.
You expected to find the place a Portuguese colony
—the Portuguese province of Mozambique, administered
by the Compania de Mozambique, just as Rhodesia ’S
administered by the British South African Company-
Well, so it is, but Beira is the natural port of Rhodesia;
it exists entirely for transit and by transit to British
Colonies, and, naturally enough, British capital is
invested in its railways, its wharfs, its electric lighting,
its cold storage—and, in fact, in all its enterprises. And.
of course, Britishers have come to look after the railways
and look after the transit.
The Portuguese collect the taxes. They have a
guardship always in the bay, a few squadrons of military


police and a few companies of civil police. The Portu-
guese Governor lives here in a very nice Residency, and
leads the place socially ; but the English engineer who
built the railway lives in a bigger house, and leads
the place commercially. He now manages the railway
and nearly everything else, and is referred to as the
“king of the town.” He is an amiable and unassuming
man, and if he has made a fortune he deseives it, for
it, must be no small test of staying power to hang on
here, amid tropical heat and fever, year after year —
to see 200 white men die in the building of the railway
alone—to suffer many attacks oneself. This surely
deserves its reward. The place, however, is not English,
though it depends so much upon English capital. It
belongs to all peoples and all colours.
Lying off the pier, you may see a couple of daha-
beyehs such as sail up and down the Nile. Hero and
there lateen-sailed craft flit past you, such as may
be seen in Mediterranean ports. Yonder is a boat
manned by Arabs; they are disembarking the cargo
from one of their own dhows. How lazily they pull
at the long, spoon-like oars. The natives do most of
the boat work. When we first went ashore we were
carried astride the backs of the negroes through the
surf to the beach. There a very intelligent Arab boy,
in white robes and red fez, attached himself to us as
a guide, and showed us round. He was a very good
linguist, and could do our work in all the languages
spoken in the town. The streets are all sand, and you
can push a walking-stick right into them anywhere.
There are many gum-trees planted at the sides of the
streets. Side-walks are laid down in concrete- Natives


must nob walk on these unless they wear boots, and
qs they find it a great hardship to do this, they always
take the centre of the road, trudging in the sand.
Tramways of 19-inch gauge are laid along the streets,
and by paying a yearly tax citizens may run their own
private tramcars. The locomotive power is found in
the “house boys.” Everyone of the least importance
has a few “boys.” The smartest of these are paid from
18s. to 30s. per month, and rations of rice are given
them. They may be taught to do anything, from
cooking to running the engine of a steam launch.
It was very interesting to see a Beira family out for
a “constitutional.” Husband and wife sit underneath
the awning, coming over the back like the hood of a
buggy. The children are perched about the front of
the little car, and a huge army of natives all round
push the car along. If another tram in front is not
going fast enough, the native boys give timely warning
by emitting a series of yells. Then, if those in the
front car cannot go faster, or do not wish to, they
promptly stop and lift the foremost car off the road to let
the pursuing Jehu pass. On one occasion I noticed
a family party pursuing their leisurely way on
the line, when the shrill signals of the boys
propelling a resplendent car containing some high
functionary, approaching in a great hurry, warned
them to clear the line. The boys immediately dumped
the family party, car, babies, and all, into the sand
whilst “his mightiness passed”; the Portuguese pater
familias and his lady meanwhile smiling and bowing to
the personage for whom the line had so summarily been
cleared. It was a fine exhibition of courtesy under


difficulties. There are some very fine stores here,
with fine prices for their wares. Everything is
at least 100 per cent, dearer than in Sydney. Busi-
ness begins at 6 o’clock in the morning, but there is
a siesta from 11 a-m. to 1 p.m., when all shutters are
put up. In the hotels and restaurants there is a long
'procession of white-robed Zanzibari waiters, endless
multiplication of courses and fresh plates, but nothing
very nice to eat or drink. For mutton you get “buck,”
and the beef is imported in the form of curiously-shaped
Madagascar cattle. All this is to be altered now, for
arrangements are being made by one of the many newly-
formed English companies for the regular importation of
Australian frozen meat.
The population is made up of Portuguese, Greeks,
English, Germans, Italians, French, and Indians. There
are also a few Chinese, who do the carpenters’ and
joiners’ work. The very best people to deal with are
the Indians. They are our fellow-subjects from Bombay
and other Indian cities. They are very proud of all
the English soldiers coming here, and they treat them
very kindly, always taking care to remind you that they,
too, are Britishers. The opposite spirit obtains in con-
nection with other traders, who evidently put up their
prices to the “gentlemen in khaki.” With the excep-
tion of the Greeks and Italians and a few of the official
Portuguese, most of the foreigners here were pro-Boer,
though why they should be is hard to discover, as the
very existence of Beira depends on the English. The
Portuguese officials were very kind to us, and they
seemed very glad at our coming, as they expected that
it would advertise the place, and of course the coming


cf a few thousand troops was a big thing commercially
for Bcira. His Excellency the Governor told Colonel
Airey that he thought it was “quite magnificent to see
all these immense tiansports in the bay and all these
soldiers coming.
There was a reception and tennis party at the Resi-
dency on April 14. Most of the officers and all the
nurses from New South Wales attended, and two photo-
graphs were taken of the party. In the first group all
the officers of the Contingent with the nurses were
included. The Governor and his wife with Colonel
Airey sat in the centre, and behind them the
Governor's two daughters stood holding two riding whips
crossed for “ Good Luck ” to the Australians. At night
there was a ball, to which all the officeis of the Con-
tingent were invited.
This was as bright a bit of colour as could be
imagined. The ball was held in a R.C. school-hall,
away out in the suburbs, and the officers who attended
with the vice-regal party went out in the Government
House tram-cars. These were marshalled in the grounds
near the tennis courts, for the tram-line is brougat
right into the grounds of the residency. The minia-
ture cars were lit up with many-coloured Chinese lan-
terns, and propelled by the uniformed house-boys. M hen
we left the town behind we had to cross some swampy
flats. Here the train formed a bright picture. The
swamps were lit up with myriads of fire-flies, and the
lights of the Chinese lanterns showed the beautiful
dresses of the Portuguese ladies, relieved by the red
cape and grey dresses of the army nurses, the bright
uniform of Portuguese officers, with the neutral khaki


worn by our own men—all forming a picture which
might have passed for a scene out of the “Arabian
Nights.”
There were quite a number of titled Portuguese
ladies present ; but we were not so much impressed with
their titles as with their graceful dignity as they glided
along the room with their partners, to the strains cf
the “Blue Danube.”
Though not entitled to give an expert opinion, I
must insist that the Australian officers cannot dance. I
formed that opinion when, as a spectator, I contrasted
their hilarious efforts with the dancing of the Portuguese
people in the room. The difference between them was
the difference between inspiration and perspiration —the
poetry of motion contrasted with athletics. Our officers
and the nursing sisters, however, enjoyed themselves
thoroughly, and I was not quite certain that our Portu-
guese friends did. Having gone thus far on the
dangerous road of criticism, I mav as well go further,
and, burning my bridges behind me, venture the opinion
that our people danced to please themselves, and suc-
ceeded ; the Portuguese danced to please others, and
also succeeded admirably. I was quite puzzled to
account for the great quantity of medals worn by the
Portuguese officers on their rich uniforms, until I learnt
that they get medals for peace service, promotions, and
successful examinations; whilst our medals represent for
the most part active service. Our stay was only brief.
We were to be aboard the tug to time; so we left the
bright scene behind, and trudged towards the wharf.
The natives here are a very interesting study. They
are Zanzibari, Kaffirs, Basutis, Zulus, all sorts, but a,U


very much alike. They work the hardest, and seem
to be the happiest people in Beira. They are of very
good physique, and in this respect quite a contrast to
the other races resident here, especially the Portuguese.
A regiment of Portuguese soldiers looks like a battalion
cf senior cadets in a Svdney public school. They are
little, but, of course, they may be good. The natives
are very intelligent and imitative. The Bushies on
the “Maplemore” drilled about twelve of them, and
marched them to the quarter-deck for the amusement
of the officers one night. They repeated every order
thus, the italics representing the natives’ response :
“Number,’ Nuinbah; “one,” one; ‘‘two,’ tu; “three,
tree ; “four,” foe; “five,” fife ; “six,” sticks. Then began
a series of the most extraordinary acrobatic movements
to the following orders, all, of course, faithfully repeat ad
by the native squad; —“Attention,” “Bully beef, Pre-
sent,” “Bad pork,” “As you were,” “Salt Water,” “Bad
biscuit,” “Stand at ease.” “Mark time” was the
funniest of all, for it developed into a native dance,
which would make a good item in any variety concert.
Amongst themselves they are very generous, dividing
any food which is given them. Neither do they seem
covetous, for if you give one of a boat’s crew a present,
the others seem as they look at it to derive as much
pleasure from it as the owner, to whom they return it
without showing any envious spirit. They are not the
sordid beggars most blacks in seaport towns seem to
be. They are extremely modest, and, it is said, im-
morality is almost unknown amongst them, though, if
they are wealthy enough, they mav buy more than one
wife. If one native dies, the others will not on any


account touch the body, but they bring the nearest
relative of the deceased, who arranges for the burial.
Beira is the port of disembarkation for those who
come from afar to hunt big game. A sportsman went
up-country for some shooting whilst we were there. Quite
a little army of natives accompanied him as beaters,
porters, etc. One walked behind carrying the hunter’s
gun; then followed the others, carrying their mats and
blankets. They also had. gourds to hold the water, as
well as cooking utensils. Many very small boys were
included in this expedition. Sportsmen would be help-
less without this native retinue, and there are profes-
sional hunters whose business it is to arrange these parties
for sportsmen coming from Europe. Lions may be
found at any time about twenty miles out of town, and
it is said that a lion was seen near our horse lines in
the camp one night. There was a guard in charge of
the horses night and day. It was unfortunate that
stables had not been erected for the horses, for there
is a dangerous weed, which, if eaten when the thick dew
of night is on the ground, induces horse sickness.
When camping in the open the horses must have nose-
bags on at night. The mosquitoes are terribly bad at
night, but they possess one virtue—they do not sing.
The story of our coming here, if true, is a curious
page in the diplomatic history of Great Britain. Efforts
were made to pass troops through, but the Portuguese
authorities could not see their way to grant permission.
About 200 rrcruits, however, were passed through as
miners for Rhodesia. About a month before our
arrival, however, the fact was somehow unearthed that
the treaty of 1877 relating to Rhodesia conceded the


right to the Imperial authorities to send troops and
warlike stores through Portuguese East Africa to
Rhodesia, “for its defence, and now the Rhodesian
Field Force, including the three regiments of Australian
Bushmen, are going on to Rhodesia without saying “By
your leave,” either to Portuguese or Boers. If this
had been discovered sooner, Mafeking might have been
relieved, and the end of the war hastened. This is
the story as told at Beira. The Portuguese in the
early days of Beira were not so friendly to the English
as they are now’. It is said that when the side-walks
were first constructed, the public peace was disturbed
by a gang of hoodlums collecting in a certain place, and
a by-law T was drafted forbidding these characters to use
the sideovalks. In its preparation some of the Portu-
guese officials added the words “and English. The
English residents thereupon held a meeting, the result
of which was a letter which appeared in the Beira news-
paper, stating on their behalf that they would disregard
the by-law, and that for the future they would walk on
the footpaths armed.
There is absolutely no restriction whatever on the
drink traffic in Beira, the result of which *s that in
so small a town as this there are no fewer than forty-one
bars, and. of course, a good deal of drinking. There
is no Protestant Church in Beira, most of the people
there being Roman Catholic- On Good Friday all the
flags except our own in the bay were flown half-mast
high. Franciscan monks administer the charities of
the tow r n. They dress in brown robes, and wear sandals.
They all have beards. There are hospitals and schools
carried on by the nuns, who wear a very sensible and


pretty costume of white. Several squadrons of Colonial
troops had already made the journey to Bamboo Creek,
the first stage. Others were to follow as the 2ft. 6in.
gauge railway will permit. There is a colony of Boer
farmers alongside the early stages of our route, who were
suspected of disloyalty. Consequently, the Portuguese
troops guarded the railway line and bridges for sixty-
five miles. The rest of the line was guarded by
Rhodesian police. All our troops travel fully armed
and equipped, but as the Boer farmers would lose theft
property, which was given them by Rhodes, in case
of rebellion, it was not likely that we should have any
fighting till we joined hands with Colonel Plumer’s
force.


CHAPTER III.
FROM BEIRA TO MARANDELLAS.
The newspaper reader looks impatiently at hia
morning paper, and is discontented at the slow progress
of events military when he sees a few colourless war
telegrams; but when you travel with a column you begin
to appreciate the enormous difficulties to be overcome
before you get within striking distance of the enemy.
Two of the chief difficulties are transport and army
service. These difficulties arc felt in a tenfold degree
in a new country, where everything, including the rail-
way, is either just made or about to be made. For nine
days we lay at Beira (the men going to and from the
ship to the camp) disembarking our horses as we might-
There were not enough lighters, nor launches, and the
railway people had not enough rolling stock or engines
to get our horses away from Beira Camp. Everything
meant irritating delay. A first-class permanent camp
was formed at Beira ; water was even laid on, and
fences put up. The same applies to the second camp,
Bamboo Creek; but unfortunately the Bushmen were
the pioneers, and they had to suffer all the discomforts
of those who go first and pave the way for others to
follow. We laboured, and the Yeomanry and Canadian
Artillery who followed entered into our labours. After
waiting for about half a day in a blazing sun, we were
entrained for Bamboo Creek. During our wait one
of our stowaways who had got a billet on the wharf


to boss a gang of natives at X2O a month showed the
men some kindness by getting fruit and things for them.
It was a most remarkable trip for us all. The line is
monotonously straight, and the gauge being narrow, the
luxuriant vegetation brushed along the carriages. The
men were in open waggons, which had been temporarily
covered over. It was no sinecure being conductor of
the train. There was an engine in front and another
in the rear. On the footboard of the last the con-
ductor stood, and he had to dodge the branches of the
trees and push away the long grass as he kept an anxious
look-out. Every now and again we saw monkeys or
bucks running away from the train. The Western Aus-
tralian troops who preceded us saw hippopotami in
swamps alongside the line, and occasionally they crossed,
much to the anxiety of the conductors, who were not
anxious to collide with one of the great beasts. On
the flats between Beira and Bamboo Creek big game is
more plentiful than on the highlands. Two liofi cubs
were found in the railway sheds at Beira in 1899. The rail-
way officials did not look for the lioness, and they were
l ather glad that she did not make her appearance. Lions,
however, do not usually attack men, unless they arc
first wounded. Some of them, I was told, are great
cowards, and will not face man under any circumstances-
Old, toothless lions, however, who are no longer able
to hunt for themselves, are a menace to the villagers,
and at various places we heard unpleasant stories of
them eating natives. As we passed along, all agreed
it was the most beautiful country they had ever seen.
Much of it like English park land, with just a clump
of trees here and there, all else beautiful green undulat-


ing meadows. At frequent intervals we had to stop
and take in wood (for the engines) and water. A tram
behind us overloaded with New South Wales troops and
horses: came to a stiff hill, and the men had to get out
and push, whilst some natives hauled on to a rope at
the front, until the difficult spot was successfully negoti-
ated. During the transport of the troops one locomotive
overturned, and there were all sorts of accidents to delay
us. They have only six locomotives on the Beira line,
and the engine-drivers were getting big bonuses for work-
ing overtime in order to take us up to Rhodesia. Df
course, the transport of troops was never anticipated
by the projectors of this railway. It is an excellent
light railway, and is a good object lesson to Australia
of the value of light railways for sparsely-populated dis-
tricts. The line has since been widened into a 3ft. Gin.
gauge to make it uniform with the Rhodesian railways.


The transport of 5000 troops, including six batteries
of 12-pounders, with stores for the whole field force,
however, meant hopeless congestion of traffic. All ordi-
nary traffic on the line between Bcira and Salisbui'y
was suspended ; consequently foodstuffs had gone up
to famine prices in many towns. On reaching Maran-
dellas we paid Is. 6d. a pound for sugar, 15s- a dozen
for (very little) eggs. At the various stations coming
up we paid a shilling for a lib. loaf, and our
meals were from four shillings for light breakfast
or supper to seven and sixpence for a dinner.
This does not include beer, wine, or spirits, which some
find necessary. I was told that at Salisbury they had to pay
eighteenpence for a candle. It would have been cheaper
to live well in New \ ork or Paris than in Rhodesia
at present. Our rations in camp were cut down, for,
though we owned stores enough, they were detained at
various points on the road.
We arrived at Bamboo Creek at 2 o’clock on Satur-
day morning, April 20, having been on the road, a dis-
tance of fifty-six miles, from Friday 2 p.m. After
seeing to our luggage, we were making our way to
camp, followed by natives carrying our things, when
a burly New South Wales sentry with bayonet fixed
stopped midway the gateway and challenged us with
the words, “Halt! Who goes there? We passed, but
there was quite a ceremony before the zealous trooper
would let the natives through. Captain Riggall and
Lieutenant Adams, of the Tasmanian Contingent, were
very kind to us; they got food for us, and we shared
their quarters —a space overhung with branches inter


twined to keep off some of the heavy dew. We passed a
very good night, though Lieut. Christie, of New South
Wales, who was sleeping near to us, rose rather quickly
when he awoke at daybreak, and saw a green snake
hanging from a bough just over his head- During the
morning of Saturday a good many snakes were killed
in camp. The natives have a superstitious dread of
snakes, and run for their lives when one is being killed.
Here, as at Beira, a good camp was in course of
formation; but it was a bad place for men and horses,
as we learned to our cost. It is about the same
level as Beira, and there is water anywhere within two
feet of the surface; consequently it is fever-stricken,
and the dreaded horse-sickness was common. There
was a paddockful of mules here, and every day some
died. Every morning a truck-load of dead horses was
taken up the line to be burnt. Amongst these were
many of the best, which had been given to the Bushmen
by their friends in Australia. Unfortunately, my own
horse died here before he had been used at all. "W e
managed to get a train-load of South Australian and
New South Wales troops and baggage away for Maran-
dellas on Friday afternoon, April 20. Our second
railway trip was more eventful than the first. We
had nothing better than covered trucks, and we found
that, though it is possible to make oneself fairly com-
fortable in a Wolseley bed when in camn, you can
never get comfortable on the hard floor of a truck;
you have no protection against the “ upward
bumps.”


Early in the morning we arrived at Mandegas, 145
miles from Beira, and heard that a lion had carried away
a native boy on the previous afternoon.
Here we had to wait for ten hours—the engine-
driver had gone on strike.
With a command of language which was marvellous,
he explained that he had worked for twenty-five hours,
and he was willing to go to a much hotter place than
his own engine fire if he would go another blank mile
for any blank Government. He didn’t care whether
there was a blank war or not; not he! If he had
talked it through the telephone it would have fused
the wires. The linguistic curiosities of this fellow and
his railway confreres on the line, together with the
facility with which our men imitated them, gave me a
new impression of the meaning of the process called
“painting the map red.” My surprise at being intro-
duced to this lurid vocabulary recalls the experience of a
brother chaplain, who, writing home about it, said “that
the men swore so hard that he was amazed that they
did not suffer from clergyman’s sore-throat.”
Whilst we were waiting here a rather amusing inci-
dent took place. Some of the men discovered a wine-
shop, and those in command thought it wise to forbid
any to go to it, and for the purpose of car lying out
orders, a guard was ordered to be placed.
The Portuguese Commandant lived next door
in a house before which, on a flagstaff, the Portu-
guese flag flew. The sentry mistook his orders, and
for some hours he promenaded up and down in front
of the Commandant’s house, until that indignant official


sent his secretary to remonstrate, and he did so with much
shrugging of the shoulders and raising of the eyebrows,
whilst feet and hands were extended at an acute angle. Of
course, the guard was removed, and our officer apologised in
person to the Commandant.
We got another locomotive at last, and
steamed away for Marandellas. Another train had
arrived, and we left them behind impatient to follow-
We got no rest now, for our engine sent out shower's
of sparks, and we were hardly able to keep the baggage
from catching fire. It was a grand sight to see the
showers of sparks lighting up the tracks on both sides,
but it was an unpleasant experience. We all had our
uniforms burnt through in many places, and at last
the train caught fire in several waggons, and we had
to stop the train and get help to put it out. ,Our next
stop was at Revue. A fine bridge crosses the river here,
and it was guarded by Portuguese soldiers, who had
a Maxim gun between earthworks. Next we reached
Macequece. Twelve miles beyond this we saw the rude
stone pillar which marks the boundary between Por-
tuguese East Africa and Rhodesia. Our train got away
again from Umtali early on Sunday morning. The
only event of interest occurred on Sunday afternoon,
when we passed through a dense cloud of locusts.
Masses of them rose and fell on the horizon like thunder-
clouds, and as we passed through them they quite
blackened the air to a good height —for exactly a mile
and three-quarters, according to the distances marked
on the railway track, and counted by Lieutenant Con-
roy. We were kept very busy flicking them off and


throwing them out of the waggon. Every blade of grass
was attacked, and they seemed to roll on and on like
a “southerly buster/' The only way to understand
what a flight of locusts means is to see one. We ex-
pected to reach camp early on Sunday morning, but
we arrived at Marandellas at 7.30 on Sunday night.
There we found bullock waggons waiting for our bag-
gage and stores, and we marched into camp, a distance
of nearly two miles.


CHAPTER IV.
LIFE IN CAMP AT MARANDELLAS.
Marandellas is called the “sanatorium” of Rhodesia.
It is over 5000 feet high, and is blessed with a cool
climate and fine scenery.
Rhodesians have a way of anticipating the future.
Fine hotels and boarding-houses are to be erected here
(so it is announced by the powers that be), and forthwith
out of the impalpable visions of imagination the Rho-
desian conjures a “sanatorium-” This is characteristic
of Rhodesia; it is distinctly a country of the future.
When we were in camp, an hotel and a store, united
in one ramshackle building, and a few corrugated-iron
sheds and native huts around the railway station, were
all that existed.
The biggest thing was our camp, and that was only
in course of construction. For a week all our horses
were stabled in sheds, and then all were put on the
horse lines (except the sick), and we were all under
canvas.
It is said that no one gets fever at Marandellas.
However, there were plenty of people with fever about,
though probably they caught it on the lowlands. I
saw a man in the store one day shaking from head to
foot with fever and ague. He told me he had been
ill two months. He had come to buy quinine. We
had at this camp about twenty men in hospital. Three-
fourths of them had slight attacks of malarial fever.


Father Timony had a slight attack. Lieutenant West-
garth, too, had been down. We had a field hospital pre-
sided over by English doctors, and they had plenty of
work to do.
General Sir F. Carrington arrived on Thursday,
April 26. He was accompanied by a battery of Cana-
dian Artillery (12-pounders) and the Queensland
Mounted Infantry. He inspected our men on Friday,
April 27, and was much impressed by their physique-
He was accompanied by Sir Marshall Clarke (the Queen’s
Commissioner), Mr. Milton (the Administrator of Rho-
desia), and many other officials, as well as his staff. A
guard of honor was provided for the Commissioner by
the Ist Regiment of Australian Bushmen. The General
was much irritated at the delay in transport. No one
was as sore as we were at the delay, for we were losing
our horses owing to their detention at Beira and Bamboo
Creek, where they contracted the mysterious horse-
sickness which is the scourge of the horses in this colony.
At Bamboo Creek and Beira thirty-three had already
died, and twenty-six died here (including a large pro-
portion of valuable officers’ horses). We had therefore
lest fifty-nine since disembarkation, our total loss being
seventy-nine. Fortunately, frosty mornings now set
in, which stays the disease.
Horse-sickness seems to have baffled the experts
in Rhodesia for years, and though it is said that the
Government offers to give £25,000 to anyone finding
a cure, still horses continue to die, whilst veterinary
surgeons look on helplessly. Many of our horses seem
to have a form of malarial fever, and a few of these
seem to have been saved by large doses of whisky and


quinine. But the disease from which there is no
reprieve is popularly called Blue Tongue. From what
1 could learn, it first attracted notice in 1892, when it
decimated the horses of the Inniskilling Dragoons, then
stationed in Rhodesia.
It is a microbic disease. When it is fairly well
advanced, the membranes of the tongue and mouth
assume a purple hue, just as though blue-black ink had
been spilt upon the red flesh.
Six or seven hours after the first symptoms are
observed, the horse dies, apparently painlessly. Mules
are liable to catch this disease, but donkeys (which are
common in Rhodesia) are immune. Many theories are
advanced as to the cause of this horse-sickness, but the
best-established one is the following: —When the dew is
on the grass, either at night or morning, it renders a
fungus, which clings thereto, poisonous, and when horses
eat this grass their blood becomes tainted. Numerous
little slits on the tongues of the horses seem to suggest
that the sharp edges of the grass cut them and perhaps
render them more liable to take the virus into the
blood. Bleeding and sweating and dosing the horses
have all been tried in vain. In consequence of this
danger, it is the custom in South Africa only to allow
horses out after 10 a.m-, when the dew is off the grass,
and they are brought in again at 4 p.m. When travel-
ling with horses, the nosebags are put on at night.
To make us more helpless, there was the deadly tsetse
fly. But for this we should have been able to ride up
from Beira to Marandellas and also bring our own trans-
port'. As there is a belt of fiftv miles of tsetse fly
country between here and Beira, our horses had to


come in fly-proof vans. The Canadian Artillery were
most fortunate with their horses. They were warned
of the horse-sickness at Capetown, and they came right
up, without stopping at the fever-stricken Bamboo
Creek, with ventilated leather muzzles on their horses.
These were only removed for feeding; and the value of
these precautions was proved by the fact that they did
not lose a single horse.
The Canadians were fine fellows. They wear cowboy
soft felt hats, with very broad, stiff brims, and four
indentations in the crown. They have the usual khaki
uniform. They are drawn from the mounted police, cow-
boys, militiamen, and the regular Canadian forces. It was
made a condition of entrance that every man should
have attended at least one encampment. The Canadian
Contingent had proceeded part of their journey towards
Bloemfontein, when their Artillery were ordered on to
Rhodesia to accompany us. They had with them an
Esquimaux dog, which had come all the way from Klon-
dyke. He was a big brute, and had gained for himself
some notoriety by shaking a small cow to death at Cape-
town. The men were very fond of their regimental pet.
He was of the type used on the Yukon for freight pur-
poses, six of them being harnessed to a cart or sledge.
Very much to our satisfaction, a movement forward
began now. Every morning one field gun, with a full
complement of horses and men, and accompanied by an
escort of Queensland Mounted Infantry, left for Bulu-
wayo. Though the Queenslanders had not yet got their
horses up, so anxious was the General to get men on
that the mail-coach was subsidised for them each day. In
this way the whole of the battery of six guns had soon left


for the front. There was greater satisfaction, however,
when the General ordered A Squadron to Buluwayo. A
“camp fire” was held that night to bid them good-bye,
and the General and his staff attended. In addition
to songs and recitations from
our own men, the natives
working about the camp con-
tributed a “ Kaffir dance.”
It was a most weird affair-
A tall Mashona, with
an enormous head-dress of
plumes, acted as master of
ceremonies. This fellow wore
as many armlets, bracelets,
and anklets as he could well
put on, and carried a shield,
battle-axe, and knob-kerrie.
When he strutted round,
with all his feathers shaking
in the wind, and his wonder-
ful skirt of cats’ tails swing-
ing to and fro like the kilt of a
Highlander on the march, he
was an amazing sight.
Led by this picturesque
barbarian, and singing as they came, the natives marched
into the glare of the camp-fire in twos, stepping in time
to the rhythmic clapping of the women’s hands.
Then they formed into a circle and marched round,
singing, as the women, sitting down, formed a ring out-
side. They were evidently in battle array —carrying
spears, axes, and formidable knobkerries, and a few of


them had ox-hide shields, upon which they beat the
time in resounding blows. Whilst they danced round
to the sound of choruses, various bravos would leave
the circle and “do a turn” in the centre. They would
sing the words of some barbaric melody, dancing mean-
while, and then the rest would take up the chorus.
It was a competition, first of all, in dancing, light-
ning speed, grotesque gestures ; high kicking, and jump-
ing seemed to be the points marking the merit of the
performers. But it was also a representation of the
histrionic ait. In both dancing and singing they acted
a character. One was a hunter, and during an excit-
ing pause in the music he tracked a wild animal, whicn
he afterwards followed and speared with a downward
lunge of his assegai, which evoked a great chorus of
hulaloos—aloos from the women. But the most realistic
bit of acting was the representation of a personal
combat by a muscular black, who seemed to begin by
reciting his own praises, and then went on to pick a
quarrel with an imaginary warrior, who evidently was
armed in the same way that the actor was, with shield
and spear. We now saw a good representation of the
true method of native fighting at close quarters. He
kept his shield above him, and sprang about with mar-
vellous celerity, crouching low the whole time, and
thrusting upwards with his spear. Now the fight got
fast and furious, and the chorus and dance quickened.
With blazing eyes, the actor followed the movements of
his imaginary opponent, pressing the fight closer and
closer, yelling the whole time, until at last, having
speared his antagonist, with one great jump and fierce


yell he landed on top of him, and, grinding his teeth in
fury, he drove his spear through the' throat of his
imaginary foe.
This great feat was greeted with loud expressions
of approval by the surrounding natives, who, no doubt,
throughout the whole scene, in sympathy with the
fighter, had “seen red.” Thus, as the dance went on
many of the natives seemed to become possessed by a
kind of wild exultation, which suggested to us the easy
transition between it and the fearful atrocities and
orgies associated with their warpath and wizardry.
When their contribution was finished by the sound
of an officer’s whistle, the natives marched outside the
radius of the great camp-fire to the tune of a native
march, which sounded very well upon the night air.
These natives were building huts in the camp. It
was curious to see them, wdien, after their day’s work
they returned to their kraals on the veldt, marching in
a long line, carrying on their heads their burdens of
firewood and food, and singing as they marched —to
frighten away wild animals and evil spirits, I was told ;
but it seemed more like a song of rejoicing that the
day’s work was done. When the whole contract was
finished, and the native labour agent paid them their
wages, and allowed them to return home, it was a great
occasion. Both men, women, and children were in full-
dress, picturesque, though scanty enough in some cases.
They formed up in some kind of order, and marched
away singing, some of the men at the front doing a kind
of cake-walk when the mood was on them.


After the departure of A Squadron, Marandellas
Camp became quite a scene of activity. Stores began
to andve in great quantities, and convoys were des-
patched by the Army Service Corps and the Ordnance
Department to Buluwayo about every other day, until
there were altogether 200 ox-waggons en route. These
were always guarded by troops. The whole of the
Ist Regiment of Bushmen had gone forward in this way
except Captain Machattie’s C Squadron and the men
in hospital.
The men became very restive at the delay, and
were almost willing to go on their hands and feet if
they could only get on the march to Mafeking. Owing
to our great loss of horses—over a hundred. —one de-
tachment, commanded by Lieutenant Lynch, had to
walk, and they did the whole of the three hundred miles
between Marandellas and Buluwayo in twenty days.
This was a splendid performance when it is remembered
that they had to carry rifles, ammunition, and some
kit, and, to suit the oxen, which were only allowed
to graze in the heat of the day, they had to march
late at night and very early in the cold mornings.
When they arrived at Buluwayo the soles of their boots
were for the most paid worn out, and many of them
had bleeding feet.
They bore this willingly and without complaint-
Were they not marching to Mafeking? It was truly
a bitter disappointment that, after all their heroic efforts,
they were destined to be too late to take part in the
relief of that beleaguered city. But it was becoming
more obvious that, although the Rhodesian Field Force,
of which the three regiments of Bushmen were the


vanguard, was intended to reinforce Plumer’s force, that
was not by any means its chief business.
It was intended for a larger plan of action- Else
why the long chain of well-ordered camps across the
ridge of the watershed between the Zambesi and Lim-
popo Rivers? Our real work was, no doubt, to stop
the last move which the Boers were expected to make,
viz., a trek to Rhodesia.
That the Rhodesian Force was not to be organised
and done with in a few weeks was evident by the
way things were done. A weatherboard house was built
and furnished for General Carrington at Marandellas.
Traction engines were running between our camp and
the railway; engines were erected at the creek to pump
water for the horses, and a well was sunk in the camp.
Permanent stables were built for the horses.
Many transports were anchored at Beira, and
twenty-five were on the list to arrive early in May,
1300. This seems like waste of money, but our readi-
ness to meet the enemy north of the Limpopo was
probably the reason that he did not trek in that direc-
tion. I remember that General Carrington once told
me that he did not expect to operate against the Boers
in the Western Transvaal with less than 6000 men. It
would take many months to pass a force of that number
through Rhodesia.
It should be remembered in General Carrington’s
favour that circumstances afterwards forced him to take
the field with a force which he considered inadequate.
Throughout our whole march from Beira, the Brit-
ish South African Police (of the Chartered Company)
were associated with us. They are a fine body of men,


most of them mounted on tricycles, upon which they
can carry a tent and a rifle. The machines they ride
are from forty pounds to fifty pounds in weight, and I
was surprised to find that they ran so easily over the
veldt, where lighter machines would skid. They are
made from a design by one of the B.S.A. troopers,
painted red, and built very high- In every machine
the gear is very low. There is a Native Contingent
of the B.S.A. Police. These boys (mostly Mashonas
and Matabele) are uniformed in navy-blue knickers,
woollen shirts, and navy-blue service caps with red
facings.
And now those of us still left in camp were glad
to hear that we were to march out on May 11th, under
the command of Captain Machattie, leaving Captain
Eckford to bring the rest of the Ist Regiment. We
looked forward eagerly to the long trek across country
to Buluwayo.


CHAPTER V.
THE TREK ACROSS RHODESIA.
On Friday, May 11, 1900, fifty officers, non-com-
missioned officers, and men, under the command of
Captain T. Machattie, of C Squadron, left Marandellas
Camp for Buluwayo per route march. Captain Dibbs,
New South Wales special service officer, and Lieutenant
Dorrien Smith, Imperial special service officer, who were
ordered to Buluwayo for camp duties, were attached.
There were a hundred horses in charge of the detach-
ment, and six ox-waggons laden with stores and ammuni-
tion. When the detachment was drawn up for inspec-
tion it presented a very fine appearance, as we had
an unusually good lot of horses. Although composed
of so few men, a convoy presents quite an imposing
appearance when drawn up for inspection. An advance
guard is thrown out, with a connecting file between it
and the main body. A small convoy is usually made
up of two or three waggons with sixteen oxen inspanned.
Armed troopers ride alongside, the cooks, batmen, labor-
ers, and orderlies ride on top. Then follows the connecting
file between the waggons and the rearguard. The
main body usually precedes the waggons. Having left
late in the afternoon, we travelled -six miles only the
first night, then outspanned and off-saddled- For many
of us that night was the first experience of what is
now very common to us —sleeping out on the open veldt,
with only our blankets and waterproof sheets around


us, and the stars keeping watch above. Reveille sounded
at 3 a.m.; we were to trek at 4 a.m. Now began the
routine of the march. For nineteen days we, as near
as possible, inspanned at 4 a.m. and outspanned at
daybreak. Then breakfast had to be cooked, horses
fed and groomed, arms to be cleaned. At 2.30 pm.
the men were paraded, told off to bring horses in again
from the veldt where they grazed, water them, and get
ready to trek once more at 4 p.m. The evening trek
finished at any hour between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., accord-
ing to the location of the camps, when once more after
supper we lay beneath the stars until roused by the
unwelcome sound of the bugle at 3 a.m- During the
last week of our trek a better arrangement was
arrived at. We sent a guard of troopers with the
waggons, slept an hour later, and overtook the waggons
bringing our swags on the spare horses. This routine
allows oxen and horses to graze in the warmth of the
day, the only time when it is quite safe to permit them
to do so. We managed to travel from seventeen to
twenty miles a day. We could not. of course, go faster
than the waggons. One of the dreariest experiences
was when at night or early morning, especially when
there was no moon or day had not yet dawned, the
detachment had to wait in the cold near some spruit
for the waggons. As soon as the conductor points out
the camp, the fires are lit, forage given out, billies
boiled, and biscuit and bully beef, varied with ivlacono-
chie’s field ration, partaken of.
A good deal of money was spent along the road
by the troopers for “extras,” but it should be understood
that the army rations are of excellent quality. 01


course, there is a natural craving for variety, and in
many instances men who are “off colour” need other
things. We had with us some supplementary stores
given by a generous Government when we embarked on
the “Maplemore.” We shared these with the troops
of the other Colonies on board the transport; then
we brought what was left on, and we were grateful for
them many a time on the veldt.
For the first few days it was one succession of trek-
king from spruit to spruit. It was very picturesque—
the long column moving along the kopjes in the moon-
light or in the twilight of early morning, when the
horizon was defined by a band of soft blue light, sur-
mounted by the fasGgrowing pink colour which is the
sure herald cf day. Mashonaland is a beautiful country,
more rugged than Matabeleland, which is for the most
part flat, treeless country. Picture the bush of New
South Wales without gum-trees, but sparsely dotted with
the thorny mimosa bushes, and with grass growing
frequently to the height of the horse you ride. On
either side you see hills covered bv great rocks poised
at all sorts of impossible angles, and forming numerous
caverns—these are the kopjes. Once we saw a kopje
surmounted by a circle of huge rocks, all seeming to
bow down before the largest rock, which towered right
up straight in the centre of the circle. No wonder the
natives weave around these hills all kinds of supex-sti-
tious stories. We began the long trek in great spirits,
and there was much to cheer us on our march—the
bright wild flowers, the beautiful landscape, the mag-
nificent butterflies. By the roadside we often saw
y/hite waratahs, which reminded us of our own more


“THE COLUMN WILL
MOVE OFF AT 4.30 A.M.”




beautiful ones in New South Wales; then there were
crocuses, tulips, and convolvuli, as well as very fine
feathery grass all around. Everv spruit bore on its
bosom beautiful white or blue water-lilies, and the little
spruits themselves, with banks studded with rocks of
white quartz, were pictures whose beauty marks them
permanently upon the memory. Beautiful as these
NATIVE KRAAL.
spruits were, it was not safe for the men to bathe singly
in them, on account of the crocodiles.
Lieut. Dorrien Smith and I were comparatively free
and we often rode far a-field to see kraals, or other sights
marked on the map. On one of these occasions we had a
curious adventure. We were riding smartly over the long
grass, Dorrien Smith at the time urging me to “come on
faster,” when, to my surprise, he and his horse suddenly
disappeared quite out of sight, as though the earth had


swallowed them. This was, indeed, exactly what happened.
Riding up carefully, I heard a muffled voice crying out,
“ Don’t ride here ! It’s a pit.” Then as I dismounted and
peered amongst the grass for the hole, which was quite
filled up with grass and reeds growing to an enormous
height, I saw Dorrien Smith’s pony clamber up the side.
Rubbing himself and laughing (with an occasional groan)
Dorrien Smith followed. He had dropped into a disused
clay-pit, and it was only the rank vegetation which, break,
ing the fall, saved him from rather a bad accident.
Our troubles now began. The very first time we
camped we lost one horse of the dreaded, horse-sickness,
“dekkop” ; and this continued day after day, until the
ghastly list of sixteen horses dead out of a hundred was
reached. It is not easy to persuade an Australian that
any country is beautiful where horses will not live.
There seems to be little difficulty with oxen, though
they are expensive, owing to the ravages of the rinder-
pest among them some years ago. Now, however, when
the rinderpest does attack a herd, only 2| per cent,
are lost, as inoculation has proved very successful. The
docility and training of the oxen are admirable. For
instance, when they ana called they come back in their
ranks just as they are inspanned in pairs and when
they lie down to rest, when free for a while, they lie
down alongside their vokes ready to inspan quickly.
Our teams wore made up of uniform colour, and were
composed of sixteen oxen. When oxen have to go a
good way to graze, the drivers sprinkle salt on the road
home, and when they wish to inspan they call out,
“Saute, Saute,” and soon you can see the oxen coming
along in their ranks, their noses on the ground ready


for the salt. The English, Dutch, and Kaffirs drive
oxen in language made up of Dutch and Kaffir words.
They call it “talking ox.” It is the custom to name
the worst ox of the team “Englishman,” and this
obtained in our teams. The mail-coaches, which fre-
quently passed us, are drawn by 10 mules. The coaches
are of the same type as our own. There are other means
of transport for the veldt. Often waggons would pass
drawn entirely by donkeys. This is the slowest way
to trek, and rather risky, as the lions can smell a donkey
from afar. Scotch carts, with four oxen inspanned,
take good loads at a fair speed, but if you want to
trek quickly you must have a Cape cart, i-e., a heavy
and large sulky, with four or six mules inspanned. We
passed a good number of cyclists, also on the trek. Their
only difficulty is the spruits. These wore our difficulty,
too; sometimes the vorlooper—the boy who leads the
two first oxen—would have to go nearly up to his neck
in a spruit finding a way for the oxen through the drift.
At other times we got stuck up at the steep bank lead-
ing out of the spruit. Then there was much waste of
good temper, and after doing those things which they
ought not to have done, often the transport people would
have to do last what should have been done first. That
is, the boys would be set to work to shovel away the
mud; then brushwood, or stones, if available, would be
spread on the road, and an extra string of oxen inspanned.
Then a lively scene would follow. Boys would be
stationed at intervals alongside the oxen, with their long
whips, and the boss-driver having given the signal
by yelling out, “ Eck Malm!’’the others would take up
the cry, lashing their whips meanwhile, with much souud


and fury, as they sought for the ox that was not pulling :
then down came the lash upon him, as they screeched,
“Yer domde Englishman Eck Mahn.”
On Tuesday, May 15, at daybreak, we reached
Charter, formerly called Fort Charter. We found Lieu-
tenant Fraser here, ill of fever. Sister Anderson, of
the Victorian nursing staff, had come from Salisbury
to nurse him. Mr. Fraser’s men had to carry him back
two miles to Charter, he was so ill. Sister Anderson
always had patients at Charter during the march of
the Rhodesian Field Force. It was so at the other
towns, where other nurses and doctors were stationed for
duty. Every detachment keeps up to the number of
two or three, and it is this way at every place we reach.
We took a few convalescents from the hospitals at
Enkeldoom or Gwolo as we passed, but we always had
others to leave behind for those whom we took on to
rejoin their own squadrons. On YVcdnesday, May 16,
we crossed the River Umugata at a very deep drift.
On Thursday, May 17, we outspanned late (at 8.30 a.m.)
at the scene of the massacre of fourteen white women
and twenty-four white men—settlers who were murdered
in the early days by natives. On Friday we reached the
township of Enkeldoom (single-thorn tree), so called
because of one large thorny mimosa growing near the
first farm built. This township is entirely inhabited
by Dutch, and their loyalty is such that they celebrate
every victory, whether of Boers or British, in the same
way —by the whole of the settlers getting drunk on
“dop.” Just before we reached the town we had much
delay by one of our ox-waggons breaking down, and
unfortunately the new one we obtained also broke down


DIFFICULTIES OF TRANSPORT.




when we were tweny-five miles out from Enkcldoorn. At
this place wo saw the curious sight of an Indian vcge-
tablc-scllor with a little ox-cart on wooden wheels, and
covered by a curtain, just as they are seen in Ceylon.
This fellow found it necessary to employ a native boy
to drive—he walked behind in state. On Saturday,
May 19, we arrived at Orton’s Drift, where we crossed
the Sebaque River. Here we heard of the relief of
Mafeking, and we hoped that our comrades ahead were
in it. For some miles our road was now flanked with
a continuous wall of fire—a slow-burning veldt fire.
On Sunday, May 20, wo crossed the Blinkwater,
which divides Mashonaland from Matabeleland. We
had church parade at 10 a.m. upon the veldt. On
resuming our trek, we had rather a gruesome experience.
I was riding ahead, when I saw what seemed to be a
human hand pointing upwards from the ground. On
persuading my horse to approach—he was nervous about
it—l found the body of a half-buried native, in a shallow
grave. The hand was pointing to Heaven, the eyes
looking in the same direction with stony stare, as if
in protest. There was much debate about the inci-
dent amongst the men, for Rhodesia is one of the coun-
tries where foul play might go for a long time un-
punished. We reported the incident at the first oppor-
tunity to the B.S.A. Police. On Monday, May 21, wo
reached Iron Mine Hill at 7 a.m. Near this place
there are thousands of natives. The chief of the tribe
of Kalenza, whose name is Chilimonzie, lives in this
district, and is a very rich man. He has fifty-six wives
and one hundred and eighteen children.


At noon on the 21st May, Quartermaster-Sergeant
John N. Walton, who hid been ill more or less ever since
leaving Marandellas, became very much worse. He had
been relieved of his duties, and carried on a waggon
during the trek. He became unconscious when being
assisted off the waggon at Iron Mill Hill, where
we had our mid-day halt. His comrades carried him to
a Kaffir hut connected with the solitary building at t! e
place—a combined store and canteen. Captain
Machattie decided that it would be necessary to leave
him here, and I offered to stay with him in the hope
of nursing him well again in time to continue our journey
by some future convoy.
Late in the afternoon the march was resumed, and
as the men rode past in their ranks, among their good-
byes to me, there was many a kind wish expressed for
the recovery of their comrade who was lying in the hut
unconscious.
With the convoy there was a waggon load of sick
men, mostly ill of malaria. Captain Machattie remained
behind to give me some final instructions in regard to
my duties as a nurse, and then galloped after the column,
which was already almost hidden among the long grass
and mimosa bushes, leaving me with a feeling of loneli-
ness, which was even increased later, when the darkness
gathering round had blotted out the landscape bit by
bit.
Many travellers have written about the awesome
silence of the veldt. Unlike the silence of the Australian
bush, it is an absolute silence'—there is not the hum and
whirr of insect life in it, nor the ceaseless movement of
foliage, or flowing creek.


The vastness of the Bush, with its apparently bound-
less undulations of gum-trees, or plains stretching out
in never-ending perspective, produces in the mind a
profound melancholy. The Yeldt impresses one dif-
ferently. As you look across its vast, treeless dis-
tances, and note the blue-capped kopjes, and pick out
the lines of the spruits, the kloofs and vleis, as you
might in an enormous map —all lying within your vision
in a deep silence, which is only accentuated by the
infrequent barking of the jackals—a terrible feeling of
isolation comes over you. You feel as if you were the
last man left in the world, and that the appearing stars
were looking down in pity at you; and you begin to be very
sorry for yourself. As the column slowly filed in and
out amongst the hills that evening, and at last faded
away in the twilight, I felt very much like a man left
on a desert island, watching a steamer carrying away
into the distance all his hopes. Within the hut I spent
an uncanny night. Walton lay on a stretcher on one
side, and I on the other, with a candle flickering dimly
on a box between us. The strong man who had
worked on and on, defying pain and sickness, lay there,
breathing hard, the perspiration pouring out of him
under the pressure of his fight for life. One could only
look on fascinated, trying to form some idea of the
issue of the battle, but unable to help the unconscious
sufferer. It was not like the dying away of a tree
which had been ring-barked by disease for years, but
it was the proud resistance of a mighty oak suddenly
attacked by the sharp strokes of the woodman's axe.
Walton never regained consciousness, but died in the
dark and cold of the early morning, before even the


first flush of dawn had rested on the distant hills. It
was 4 a.m. when I found a waggon-load of native boys
who were going to work upon the road, and got three
of them from the foreman to dig the grave. This was
not finished till 2.30, as they had to dig through the rock.
The only two white settlers in the district, who were
very kind, tried to make a rude coffin of packing cases,
but found it impossible with the short lengths of wood
they had.
We were reluctant to bury him in his blankets,
though that is the custom on the veldt. We found
an old sheet of corrugated iron. This wo placed on
the bottom of the grave. We built a wall of stones
around this, and made a strong lid to fit on top of it.
At 4 o’clock the same day we buried him. It was
a strange funeral. Mrs. Svenson, the proprietress of
the store, and her little girl, the two white settlers,
and a trooper of the B.S.A. Police, who had called,
stood around the grave, and the Kaffirs stood at a dis-
tance, whilst the service w 7 as read. The grave was in
a line with three others, in which were buried Mrs
Svensons husband and two children, who had died of
fever. We put a wooden cross at the head of it, with
name and suitable inscription painted on it, and for
months after, each detachment travelling along the road
did something to make the grave beautiful, cither by
surrounding it with white stones, or planting flowers.
Earlier in the day I had sent my native boy “Jim” ahead
to walk after the column, as ho had no horse, and 1
now followed on horseback. It was getting dark when
I found him “scoffing” (eating) with the boys attached


to a trader’s convoy. The trader advised me to leave
him, as he would delay me, and lions were reported in
the sparsely-timbered forest which we had now to cross.
I put it to Jim thus: “You hear what the Bass
says, Jim; you stay with his boys, and by-and-by you
come to me at Buluwayo.” “No,” said Jim ; “me want
to go with my Bass.” “But,” said I, “maninga—plenty
—of lions; besides, feet”—pointing to his—“no good.”
“Feet plenty good,” he replied, exhibiting them; and
so we started off, and it was wonderful how he kept up
with me. Later, I was very glad of his company, for
we came to places where the tracks on the veldt crossed
and re-crossed, and it was almost impossible to follow
our column. When in doubt, dismounting, I would
call him up, and, going down on his hands and knees,
he would examine the tracks with all the keen intuition
of a native, and by-and-by pronounce the verdict: “This
road no good; this way good (moucha) —j>lcnty horses
and soldiers this way.” Once we came to a small convoy
stuck up—a dissil-boom (waggon-pole) had broken, and
they were making a new one. The conductor of this
convoy was very kind, and invited me to camp with
him. He was the black sheep of a titled Englisn
family, sent out to carve his fortune in Rhodesia. Poor
fellow ! not long after he blew his brains out on the
veldt, perhaps in despair of getting above the deadly
monotony of transport-riding. Again and again we
were filled with hope by seeing in the distance the fires
of a camp ; but, arriving, we discovered to our disgust
that they were camps deserted by our men, and occupied
only by the jackals eating up the offal left behind. At
last, in the small hours of the morning, we found our


own camp. Our thirty miles’ journey was over, and
we were glad to rest. “dim ’ huddled in with the other
boys by the camp-fire, and I put my head on my saddle,
and, covered with a great-coat, was soon asleep. Not,
however, before many of the men had inquired of m?.
about Walton. They heard the guard challenge me,
and the word was soon passed along the line of sleep-
ing troopers that poor Whlton was dead and buried upon
the veldt, and it cast a gloom over the whole camp.
The next morning, when we were beginning our
trek to Gwelo, Jim came up to me, and, exhibiting the
soles of his feet, one by one, said. Bass, feet no good
to-day.” I was quite prepared to believe that, after
his thirty miles’ journey, his feet were tired and sore,
so I arranged for him to travel that day upon a
waggon.
We arrived at Gwelo, the third largest town of Rho-
desia, at day-break of May 23. As at Enkeldoorn, we found
here that the streets, which are well-laid-out, are planted
with Australian gum-trees and a few pepper-trees. V\ e
had to stay here the whole day waiting for ox waggons
carrying oats for us. We were thus able to participate
m the celebrations on the relief of Mafeking. The next
day was) thei 24th (Queen’s Birthday). At Gwelo there
were sports and a race meeting arranged, and, by a
curious coincidence, 30 teams of oxen arrived early in
the morning. We had no blank cartridge with which
to salute, but we gave three cheers for the Queen at our
parade, and drank her Majesty’s health at dinner —most
of us in Billy tea! We passed Majojo Mountain, and
went through Somabula Forest during the day. Soma-
bula Forest is famous for lions. Some members of A


squadron saw lions here; one trooper had three shots
at one, which got away —very much, we understand, to
the trooper’s relief. One of the squadrons boasts of
having killed a jackal on the trek. We had no further
acquaintance with these brutes than hearing their con-
tinual barking round our camp at night. There was
not a day, however, when we did not get birds of some
sor t—either pigeons, pheasants, or bustards —as a
variety in our bill of fare. On Saturday, May 26, we
reached the Shangani Iliver, and at 7 a.in. we camped in
the beautiful Matoppo Hills, Ai the night camp we
had hardly got slowed avvay in our blankets when a
thunderstorm broke over us. Machattie and I were
lying alongside each other. Dibbs had camped in Ids
usual way near the tire and poor Pockley, heaped up
with macintoshes, was nursing his neuralgia over the
dying embers at the other side of the fire. Sleep was
out of the question, so we spent the night making reports
to each other mostly unfavourable —as to our
experiences.
“Well, how are you, Padre 1 ? said Dibbs.
“Dry as a bone,” I boastfully replied.
“Most parsons are,” was his retort.
Ignoring the implication, I continued in a tone of
superior wisdom; “You see, I fixed my valise on a
slope.”
“I wish I could slope out of this," he replied, as
he vainly ro-arranged his sopping garments.
Machattie was “Not so bad.” Dorrien-Smith was
D B , with apologies to the Padre; and Mullens
was much worse, without any apologies.


My sinful boasting was brought to so sudden an end
in the morning as to recall the text: “Pride goeth before
destruction,” etc. I was yawning, half-awake, but still
dry, when, stretching my legs out to the full length, they
plunged into the foot-bag of my valise, which was full
of rain-water, and I sprang up with a yell. During
the night, curling myself up more and more, the lower
part of the valise was left limp, and all the rain had
drained into this. The honours were now fairly evenly
distributed, and we sat down to sooff in an equality of
discomfort which left no room for envy. Of course,
most of us had forgotten to turn our boots and helmets
upside down, and put our leggings under our pillows ,
this wo noted for the future. On the whole, the men
got on fairly well; they had camped under the
waggons. We abandoned our morning trek - in
order to dry our clothes, and had to trek
later. During this day (Sunday), May 27, we
crossed the battlefield of Shangani. The surround-
ing kopjes are still witnesses to the defeat sustained by
the Matabeles, as human bones arc seen strewn upon
the ground. About half a mile from the battlefield we
passed a large monument erected to the memory of 42
men, women, and children murdered by natives during
the rebellion. The rebellion was largely caused by the
witch-doctors who went up and down the country preach-
ing against the English, and blaming them for the causing
of the and it was not ended until the English
troops had captured the “ Mclimo”—chief priest, and put
him in prison. On Monday and Tuesday, May 28 and
29, we passed through several clouds of locusts, which
were eating up the young grass and rising crops. With


out further incident we reached the outskirts of Bulu-
wayo on Wednesday at daybreak. Here we halted for
breakfast, and after the usual duties had been performed,
the whole column entered the town.
Our entry created considerable interest amongst the
town’s folk. We were conducted to our camp at the
Agricultural Grounds, where we had the luxury of sleep-
ing under canvas, and of being re-united to about 300
of our comrades of the Australian Bushmen. We had
done the trek, about 300 miles, from Marandellas, in
nineteen days.


CHAPTER VI.
THE WHITE CITY ON THE PLAIN, BULUWAYO.
Buluwayo was a surprise to us. It rises like a
white city out of the plain, and its streets, well-laid-
out, planted with pepper-trees, and electric lit, run
into the veldt all round. Buluwayo Park is a fine insti-
tution, which has profited a good deal by the generosity
of the late Cecil Rhodes. It contains many Australian
shrubs and tregs (oleander and eucalypti predomin-
ating).
The blue-gums grow well here for a time, but after
a few years they are destroyed by white ants. In com-
mon with other South African towns, there is a market
square in the centre of the town, where auctions are
held daily. Many of the Government buildings are
fine structures, built of Rhodesian stone. Government
House is on the site of Lobengula’s kraal—behind it
is the big tree where he held his indabas.
From his rude throne here he condemned many of
his subjects to death. Buluwayo signifies “The Place
of Killing.” Though a good king in many respects,
he was severe, if not cruel, in his quick judgments. He
did not wait to hear much evidence, but formed his
own conclusions, and soon pronounced the sentence
“Take him away”—and the helpless victim was led to
the executioner, who awaited, battle-axe in hand, to
“put him to sleep.”


Dr. Moffat, the missionary, was much trusted by
“Lo Ben,” and ventured once to remonstrate with him.
“You shed too much blood,” said he to the king.
“If you were king of my people you, too, would
shed much blood,” replied the old chief.
All that is now changed, and the white man has
done the killing with the death-dealing Maxim in the
native wars. Lobcngula was a good friend to the
white man, and the impartial historian will have to
admit that he was badly repaid for his favour.
When his two envoys were travelling, with bags
of gold in their hands as offerings to the High Commis-
sioner, and power to fix terms of peace, they were shot
by two Bechuanaland police, and it was only when his
messengers had been intercepted in this way that he
returned to the conflict, and the tragedy of Shangani
River, where Major Wilson and Major Forbes and their
brave band were killed to a man, was the result. The
scout, Burnham, was the only survivor of this battle.
He managed to get through the encircling impi, and
tried to bring reinforcements.
There are many old residents in the country who
say that the Matabele have never yet been conquered,
and they predict trouble in the future. Perhaps it
may be avoided by wise and just government. There
was a good deal of excitement amongst the natives
whilst we were passing through Rhodesia, owing to
the proposal to increase the hut-tax from 10s. to £1
per annum.
The march of the Bushmen through the country
was an opportune demonstration of military strength.


Missionaries and others who know the natives well
think that many of the efforts made to compel the
natives to work arc premature, and a menace to the
peace of the territory. Certainly, one of the most
dangerous members of a community in a country like
Rhodesia is the labour exploiter. Apart from com-
mercial and Imperial considerations, the formation of
Rhodesia was no doubt a good thing. Lobengula was
unable to restrain the hot blood of his young men.
Every year they used to “wash their spears” in the
blood of the Mashonas, in their raids into that land.
Even now the other races fear the Matabeles, who in
former times led them into slavery. It was a typical
sight to see on our way to Buluwayo a big six-foot-high
Matabele talking through the veldt, knob-kerry in
hand, with a little Mahole walking in front carrying his
burdens.
Out of this savage Buluwayo a new city, modern
in all its appointments, has risen in eight or nine years.
Buluwayans rival Australians in their hospitality.
During our stay several entertainments w r ere got up
on our behalf, and our only regret was that foodstuffs
of all sorts were at famine prices, and there was a good
deal of trouble in regard to the issue and quantity of
rations. The Australian Bushman may be able to
live on “the smell of an oil-rag,” but he certainly objects
to do it when he is not fighting. As at other places,
the men had a lot of “fatigues” to do. For instance,
we had three different camps in two days, and these
miles apart—the Agricultural Ground Camp, the Hussar
Camp, and the Hillside Camp. Detachments of our
men now began to get away to Mafcking, for the rail-




PINNER IN CAMP.


way line was now cleared, consequent on the relief of
Mafeking. Buluwayo Hospital was now filled with sick
and wounded men, mainly from Plumcr’s column, and
from there I heard that in the relief of Mafeking the
Queenslanders of the 3rd Regiment of Australian
Bushmen, and the Canadian Artillery, who were
attached to the Rhodesian Field Force, did remarkably
well. Their conduct is all the more commendable when
it is remembered that their fighting followed on a long
march, with insufficient food, which itself followed on
the long railway journey from Buluwayo to Ootsi.
But we shall soon be on the ground ourselves; then
the story of the relief told by others will come into
proper focus in our minds. Captain Machattie left for
the south with C Squadron, in charge of 64 Boer prison-
ers, as far as Mafeking. Colonel Airey at this time
was on his way with A Squadron towards Zeerust, in
the Western Transvaal. Hungarian remounts wore
arriving via Beira, and scon the rest of the Ist Regi-
ment of Bushmen would be en route for the fighting
area. The men were impatient of delay. It was
hard for them to understand that “ they also serve who
stand and wait.” An Australian Hospital had been
established under the management of tho Victorian
Nursing Sisters.
The pressure in regard to food supply was now
greatly relieved by the arrival of immense quantities
of stores from so strange a place as Mafeking. The
explanation is that the authorities there were conserv-
ing the food in order to hold out for another six
months. These surplus stores were very welcome at
Buluwayo, however, at this time.


CHAPTER VII.
THE RELIEF OF MAFEKING, AND PLUMER’S
CAMPAIGN.
We now had an opportunity of seeing the country
through which Plumer fought, and we looked forward
to it with great interest. On June 22nd we left
Buluwayo for Mafeking, amid the cheers of a big crowd
of Buluwayans, who had assembled to wish us “good
luck.”
Our company was composed of 140 men and nine
officer's, under the command of Lieutenant Westgarth,
and we travelled with the mail train, in order to guard
it. After having climbed up and over the Matoppo
Range, we began to descend to the level of the “Karoo,”
stretching apparently in endless perspective around us.
Hardly a tree can be seen over this plain, only occa-
sional clumps of mimosa bush; but you never lose sight
of granite rocks and clusters of boulders, forming here
and there small kopjes.
We soon entered the Tati Gold Concession, and
after running 127 miles reached Francistown, the lead-
ing town of the Concession. We next entered Khama's
country, reaching Palapye Station on Saturday morn-
ing. Khama’s capital is twelve miles from the rail-
way, and is a fine native town. Khama is an ardent
Christian, and the whole of the Ba-mangwato, over
whom he reigns, have been under the civilising influence


of tho London Missionary Society since the beginning
of this century. A handsome Gothic Church has been
built by the tribe at Palapye. Throughout Khama’s
country there is absolute pi’ohibition of the drink
traffic. Khama has expelled a number, of traders from
his stadt for selling drink, and, suspecting that his own
brother was breaking the law, he is said to have dis-
guised himself as an old native woman, and in this
way got into a hut where his brother and his friends
were having a. carousal. The next day the king s
brother was ordered to clear out within a few hours.
Khama is a despot in his government, but his despotism
is beneficent, and without doubt he is the most enlight-
ened native ruler in South Africa.
Our next stopping-place of any interest was Mac-
loutsi, where, close to the railwav station, there is a
very extensive stadt, built in the native way. Sekome,
Khama’s son. reigns over this region. We saw Sekome
at the station. He is a remarkably fine young fellow,
and is said to be well educated.
We next entered Sechili’s territory, passing through
which we reached Betochoen’s country. Betochoen is
a powerful chief, being an enlightened and Christian
ruler. Now we came into Monstsiou s country, inhabi-
ted by the Barolong. The territory of these chiefs is
absolutely secured to them, and each country is a native
reserve, where white men cannot buy land, and, altoge-
ther, these reserves form what is known as the British
Bechuanaland Protectorate. This place would be a
paradise for Single-taxers, for the land is seemed only
to those wliO' cultivate it. The natives seem happy and
prosperous. At Mogalypsi, nearly 200 miles noith of


Mafeking, we crossed the English trenches first—so far
on their way to Buluwayo had the Bod's got. We
reached Mochudi late on Saturday night, and found a
squadron of the Queenslanders encamped alongside the
railway lino, under command of Major Kelly. At this
place a crisis has been safely passed, owing to the
speedy arrival of the Colonial troops upon the scene.
Linchwe, a chief who had to trek before the
A TYPICAL KOPJE.
Boers, has squatted hero on a tract of “no man’s land.”
Ilis title to the land has never been recognised by the
Imperial Government, and probably never will be, as
it adjoins the railway on the east. Linchwe, with the
usual astuteness of native chiefs, saw that this was a
suitable opportunity to advance his claims for the restor-
ation of his territory, and emphasised these claims by
looting and raiding right and left, especially the Boer


farmers. But the arrival of the Queensland Bush-
men reminded him that the arm of the British was a
strong one, and could reach him.
We were now in the region of Plumcr’s difficult
operations, and when traversing the country wo began
to realise the magnitude of his task. It has always
seemed to me that a due appreciation has been denied
to Plumer; and this opinion, formed in travelling
through the scenes of his campaigning in Bcchuana-
land, was afterwards strengthened when I accompanied
his columns. A good deal of shallow criticism was
expressed in the early days of the war at Plumer's fail-
ure to relieve Mafcking. But the relief of Mafeking
was not by any means Plumer s chief business. His
first object was to preserve the integrity of Rhodesia
by holding the long line of frontier from Mafeking to
Tuli. Subsidiary to this main object, he had to harass
the rear of the north-western Boer army, and prevent
them from pushing home their attack on Mafeking; and
finally, if possible, to relieve that town, and release the
force imprisoned there.
The materials at his disposal for the accomplish-
ment of this task were inadequate. The nominal
strength of his force was 1000; but, allowing for the
reductions by sickness (malaria and enteric) and the
unavoidable requirements of his line of communica-
tions, there was only left a force of 600 rifles in the
field.
Of these at least a tenth were continuously dis-
mounted, owing to the ravages of horse-sickness.
His artillery were the antiquated mule-guns, firing
black powder, of the British South African Police—awe


inspiring, no doubt, to the untutored Matabele, but
absurdly insufficient when confronted with the modern
breech-loaders, firing smokeless powder, with which the
Boers were armed.
With the exception of a small but efficient
nucleus, his officers were civilians, who had to learn
everything military by experience, and in the face of
the enemy; and shall I say, as must, in honesty, be said
in every such case, at the expense of the health and
the lives of the men under their charge. His troopers
were as rough and unruly a pack as could be got
together anywhere in the Empire —all grit, perhaps, but
so inexperienced and undisciplined as to make it a
fine art to manage them, and get the best out of them.
With this inferior force, in flat, open, and indefensible
country, he had to operate against an enemy superior
in strength and armament, and naturally entrenched
behind mountains and roadless bush. Behind him there
was a famine-stricken country, with a depleted treasury,
and his supplies had for the most part to come 1100
miles from a non-British seaport. Behind the Boer
army there was the Marico Valley—the garden of the
Transvaal —and uninterrupted access to all the bases
of supply. Plumcr might have earned a cheap popu-
larity by hurling his little force into Mafcking; but
that might not have been any better for Mafeking, and
it certainly would have been worse for Rhodesia.
What did he accomplish 1 Ho earned the respect
and affection of his troops, and got fighting and enduring
out of them such as deserves to pass into the history
of South Africa. He kept his little force on the flanks
and rear of the opposing army, like swarms of mos


quitoes, and prevented the Boer leaders from giving
their undivided attention to the subjugation of Matc-
hing. On occasions, when his column was deeply in-
volved with a superior foi’ce, he extricated it with little
loss, and with a skill beyond all praise. He preserved
British territory all but inviolate, and, when reinforced
bv Carrington’s Canadian Artillery and Queensland
Bushmen, joined hands with Colonel Mahon, and with
him effected the release of the beleaguered town.
Hope came to Plumer’s war-worn and weary force
with the arrival of reinforcements at Sefetili. The
season of reconnaissances, followed by inevitable and
speedy retreats was now over, for the force num-
bered almost 1000 now, and the Canadian guns—impres-
sive monsters compared to the old-fashioned seven-
pounders—made it more difficult for the enemy to ooitr
range our gunners. With this more efficient force,
Plumer moved out to junction with the southern reliev-
ing column. The two forces joined hands at Jan-
massibi’s kraal. On the next day the march was re-
sumed, and the forces were just beginning dinner, when
some of the vedettes galloped in to report the presence
of the enemy. They were followed by the bursting
of a Boer shell in the rear of the column.
Oxen were driven in and inspanned, the kits packed
up and loaded on the waggons, under the shell-fire of
the enemy. The whole convoy of waggons and ambu-
lances were taken down a dried-up spruit for shelter,
followed meanwhile by the shells of the Boers, who
were, no doubt, in this way trying to destroy the
mobility of the British force. The rank and file formed
the firing lino on the ridge of the bank, and watched


each pursuing shell as it burst nearer and nearer to
the madly-straining line of transport. For some time
there was no reply from British guns; but every officer,
his glasses glued to his eyes, was looking for the flash,
which would servo to locate the masked batteries of
the invisible foe. Soon the position of one of their
guns was marked, and to the British South African
Police, with their one long-range gun, belongs the honour
of first returning the enemy’s salute. The positions of
the other Boer guns were successively marked, and the
Royal Horse Artillery and the Canadian guns joined in
the chorus, blending the separate detonations into one
deep roar. A staff officer galloped with orders to
where the troops were lying close by the guns —already
formed for the attack. Then the khaki line moved
down the slope in front of the guns, and soon were in a
hail of fire. A trooper looked back to whistle up
his terrier, and his lips were still pursed in the call
when his dog vanished into thin air. A little blood
upon some herbage at a distance was all there was left
to indicate its fate. The dog must have met one of
the larger shells upon his way, and his frail body was
too slight an obstacle to cause the projectile to explode.
As the men advance, the fire becomes heavier. The
men crouch down now, and take cover, at intervals
rushing from point to point, but ever forward. Now
there are pathetic gaps in the line, well understood;
but forward! are there not the surgeons and bearers
to attend to those who fall? A short halt is made
at the foot of the hill, and the men can now see the
situation. About 1000 yards to their left front is
posted a battery of guns, with a pom-pom, whilst on


their right flank there stands a strongly-fortified farm-
house, with the ground all round it entrenched.
From this point artillery fire intersects the line of
fire from the battery, and the air above them sings with
the cross-fire of projectiles from both positions.
Suddenly, whilst they wait in cover, a galloper,
swaying in his saddle, for he is wounded, rides over the
crest of the ridge. He musters a sickly smile, sugges-
tive of mingled pain and patience, and inquires for the
0.C., to whom he conveys the information : “The Colonel
says you are to dislodge those guns to your left front.
They have got the range of the main body behind
you.”
“Very well, Sir.”
“Advance!”
The men climb the bank and form up kneeling
beyond.
“Advance! Double!”
Breathing hard, they rush across the intervening
slope.
“Fire a volley ! Ready !”
With fingers trembling from their exertions, the
men pluck at bandolier or breech-bolt, whilst they settle
into a kneeling position.
“At the enemy in front. At twelve hundred!”
continues the voice.
“Present!” A line of unsteady rifles rises in the
air, pointing towards the half-seen enemy. “Fire !”
Thus the advance continues, the firing line pausing
every now and again to await the arrival of their sup-
ports following, and the artillery meanwhile blazing away
with increasing effect on both Boer positions, until at


600 yards the Boer battery slackens its fire, and finally
ceases.
Now the advance guaid can see through the trees
the Boer guns limbered up and moving smartly down
the slope to the right, evidently to join their other force
at the farmhouse.
At last all the supports have come up, and the
front is changed, the whole force advancing to the
farmhouse, where a stubborn fight is being waged by
their comrades. Ere they arrive at the new point of
attack, the increased accuracy of the British shell-fire
had made the place untenable. First the fire slackens
and as the night closes in, the intermittent boom of
the Boer cannon, and the yapping of the pom-poms,
growing more and more distant, indicates that the van-
quished enemy is getting safely away under cover of
their guns. “Who cares now? ’ Plumer’s men are
cold and tired, hungry and thirsty. They lie down in
their clothes, sodden with sweat, upon the veldt, to rest
their stiff and weary limbs, too tired even to feel exul-
tant over the fact that the road to Mafeking is open
at last. The next morning, May 17th, it was discovered
that the Boer laager had not yet got away. The Cana-
dian Artillery found the range first, and it was only
by a crowd of burghers inspanning themselves to a
waggon, from which the oxen had been cut down by
our shell-fire, that the enemy got everything away, after
suffering much damage. The Queenslanders were des-
cribed at the time as “very lions in the fight.”
All that was left now was for the two relieving
columns to enter the town.


Such is the story of the fight, told by those who
were in it, specially as it relates to Plumer’s force, with
whom were the Australians.
As we travelled over the ground we were able to
understand it in its true proportions.
Now we were travelling over the trenches around
Matching, and we could see on either hand British and
Boer earthworks. We had been in the train a day
and a half and two nights. It was late on Sunday
morning, June 24th, when our train drew into Mafe-
king Railway Station. The church bells were ringing,
and it seemed as though peace had descended upon the
heroic little town, in spite of the presence and arrival
of so many armed men.


CHAPTER VIII.
MAFEKING AFTER THE SIEGE.
On alighting at, the platform of Mafeking Railway
Station, the first thing we saw was a notice, which said :
“To the station-master’s shelter.”
Following the sign, we found a “dug-out,” which
had just been filled in.
The whole of the station-master’s office furniture
had been removed underground during the siege. There
was a similar underground shelter for the telegraphists,
but the instruments had been taken up, and the wires
put back into their original situation, before we arrived.
There were great holes through the engine-shed, then in
course of erection, and numerous indications that the
town had been hit frequently and hard.
Chaplain Auld and I went across to the Mafeking
Hotel for breakfast. The window in front of us where
we breakfasted had been carried away by shell-fire, and
the space was covered with canvas. Opposite us, a big
picture was hanging on the wall, notwithstanding the
fact that a huge shell from Big Ben had smashed the
corner of the frame. The shell was partially imbedded
in the wall, and, though the hotel had been renovated,
the shell had been allowed to remain—a grim reminder
of the reality of war. The marks of bullets and shells
on the buildings was a common sight, although the
builders were already at work repairing in every street,
and the trenches in some places were being filled up.


Thousands of troops visited Mafeking during the
subsequent operations in connection with the war, and
it was a common thing to hear many belittle the siege
because they saw so few signs of the havoc it wrought.
Perhaps these people might have understood better the
nature of the conflict if the residents of Mafeking had
been considerate enough to continue to live underground
for a few months longer, and if, careless of the danger
to their health, they had left the shell-holes and demol-
ished walls and roofs to advertise their sufferings. If
the Town Council had taken the legal risks in connec-
tion with the chance of people stumbling into the unfilled
trenches at night, then perhaps so many superficial critics
would not have marched from camp to camp in the
Transvaal, announcing on all occasions that the siege
of Mafeking was a farce.
The fact that there were 453 casualties ought
to be some evidence that the siege was serious enough.
We held a special service for the troops in the Methodist
Church. Bullet-marks decorated the front of the build-
ing, and in front of the pulpit there was a great hole
in the floor, where a big shell, having crashed through
the roof, tore its way through the floor into the earth
below. It was a lucky thing for the people of Mafeking
that so many Boer shells did not explode. Through the
walls of the convent, where the wounded were nursed,
there were great shell-holes; but the most pathetic sight
of all was the little cemetery.
Around “God’s acre,” where all should be peace,
stone battlements were rudely built, and outside these
again there were earthworks and trenches.


Within the cemetery our men fought and lived just
a few yards from the graves of their comrades who had
fallen. There were lines of soldiers’ graves, each with
its white wooden cross. Over against the cemetery
there was the Boer redoubt, called ‘ The Game Tree
Fort,” Thirty British officers and men fell here in a
sortie, of which the Boers had been warned. Our men
got right up to this fort, and one of the officers. Captain
Vernon, fell whilst his arm was thrust through a loop-
hole in the fort, still holding the hot revolver he had
been using.
It was because of such bravery that for eight months
the Boers, who at one time were 8000 strong, and who
were armed with the best artillery, could not take gallant
Mafeking. The British trenches were very ingeniously
arranged. Cannon Kopje, The Brickfields, Fort Ben-
tick and the womens laager were very’ cleverly built.
The Boer forts, even when we visited them, were so
dirty that it was hard to believe that human beings had
lived in them.
The British forts were connected by telephone, and
a very efficient system of alarms was carried out in order
to warn the residents against the projectiles of Big Ben
and the smaller guns.
Quite a unique event transpired whilst we remained
in camp at Mafeking. A great “Pitso was held. This
is something more than an "indaba, or talk ; it partook
both of the nature of a council and a review. It was
arranged by the Government officials, in order that they
might have an opportunity of thanking the native chiefs
of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and particularly those


in the vicinity of Matching—the Barolongs- —-for their
loyalty.
All the troops were on parade, the British South Af-
rican Police furnishing the mounted escort to Sir Chas.
Parsons and his suite, the Australian Bushmen under the
command of Major Tunbridge being the main body.
Arriving at the public meeting place, an open space near
Chief Wessels’ house, General Parsons and ms staff took
up a position under the trees. All the Barolongs were
there, and their headmen, Chiefs Wessels, Montsoia,
Lekoko and Gopani, all looking verv happy, received the
visitors. The Civil Commissioner, Mr. Bell, introduced Sir
Chas. Parsons, and in doing so said that one of the great
generals of the Queen had personally come, attended by
all these brave soldiers, who had travelled many, many
days to be here to congratulate them and to receive their
congratulations upon the defeat of their enemies. Chief
Wessels said ; “He and his brothers were pleased to re-
ceive them. The Barolongs and their lives were at the
service of the Great Queen. They had always been loyal
to her and they always intended to be.'’ But it was
Chief Gopani, whose stadt is in the Transvaal, who made
the picturesque speech.
Tie said : “The Boers for many years treated his
people like pack-oxen, and their backs were always sore.
Then Sir Thcophilus Shepstone came, and under his rule
their backs soon got well; lately they had got sore again,
but now the English had come they would soon get all
right. He knew from the first that they would come and
take care of them ; but it was a long time. So it was
years ago. The English were slow in coming, but he
always knew they would come one day. and now they


were very happy. It was a great pleasure for him and
his people to be honoured by the presence of such dis-
tinguished officers, and he thanked them, and assured
them of the everlasting loyalty of the Bahurutses.”
Sir Chas. Parsons, in the name of Her Majesty the
Queen, thanked them for their services during the w T ar,
and the assurances of their continued loyalty. His
address was listened to with evident signs of approbation,
the men continually clapping hands, exclaiming •
“Poolah ! Poolah !” (may it rain), their idea of prosper-
ity; whilst the women, hidden in the rocks around, and
supposed to be out of sight, kept up a continual and not
unmusical ripple of “huloos.”
I had an opportunity of seeing more of these inter-
esting people when I paid a visit to the Barolong Stadt
under the guidance of Mr. Bxdscoe, the Superintendent
of the Methodist Mission. The Barclay Mission Church
is a fine cruciform brick building. It was built by the
free labour of the Royal Engineers, who came here with
Sir Charles Warren’s Bechuanaland Expedition. Sir
Charles himself laid the foundation stone. There are
8000 Barolongs in the Stadt; they trekked here before
the advance of the Boers, and fixed upon this place be-
cause its stones and rocks made it almost an impregnable
natural fortress. (The “white town” does not share this
advantage); hence the name given by the Barolong—
Mafiking, from Mafeka, a stone. Mafiking is the loca-
tive case, and means, literally, “The place which is in the
stones.” The word has again been Europeanised to Mafe-
' king. The natives did a great deal more in the defence
of Mafeking than is generally supposed. On that des-
perate attack which Commandant Sarel Eloff made upon




MAFEKING ARMOURED TRAIN.


the town, the plan was that the Boers should creep up
tne river bed and get into the native stadti. When the
huts were fired, it was to be the signal for Commandant
Snyman to come in upon the other side. If Snyman had
kept his word, Mafeking would have fallen, for it would
have been impossible to have even garrisoned it all round.
But this was not the only mis-calculation the enemy
made. The stadt was so intricate that many of them lost
their way amongst the huts, and, besides that, the na-
tives fought them, and, in doing so, paid off many an old
score.
The Barolongs build very good huts, which they sur-
round with well-built stone walls. As we walked
amongst the burnt huts, we met many of the natives who
had, all of them, a friendly greeting to their missionary
(Maruti). “Dumejla Dumela,” was their salutation—
“ Peace be to you.” “Ee ” “Ee” (pronounced Aay), the
minister responded to the different groups as they greet-
ed him. “It is peace.”
Then the black “podgy” children passed us. “Du-
mela Bana”—“lt is peace, Father,” was their greeting
to their minister. “Dumela Rre” was the kindly re-
sponse—“ Peace be to you, my children.” But it is not
an assured peace in Mafeking district yet.
The armoured train patrolled the line daily, and we
had 200 Bushmen patrolling the veldt between Mafeking
and Pretoria. The whole remaining strength of the
Bushmen now followed, and as our long column wound in
and out amongst the British trenches on the outskirts of
Mafeking, and we looked back and saw the flag flying at
headquarters,—that flag which had never yet been
lowered in a single British town in South Africa, we felt


that what our comrades had done we too could do. We
did not then foresee that we should have many a fight
before we could greet each other in the Barolong and say.
“Dumela; it is Peace.”


CHAPTER IX.
IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY.
Our first experience in the enemy’s country was a
wretched one. When we had gone a few miles the mules
were quite unable to pull the waggons, heavily laden with
ammunition.
We spent a wretched night on the veldt in the
cutting, cold wind, and on the following morning vm
made another start, after the loads had been re-adjusted
We arrived at Ottoshoop on the Sunday afternoon, having
now passed the boundary between Boer and British terri-
tory. Lieutenant Pockley, with a detachment of Bush-
men, was doing garrison duty here, and we camped that
night in the orchard of a Boer absentee. After Matc-
hing, which seems barren, it was an agreeable contrast
to wake up among fruit-trees and flowers. Ottoshoop
is the centre of the Malmani goldfield, which the Dutch
Republic prevented being worked, on account of its
nearness to British territory. If it should turn out
to be rich in gold, it will lead to great developments
around Mafeking. The name means Otto’s hope—Otto
probably being the Christian name of some old vor-
trekker who won the right to the land hereabout by
his rifle.
We inspanned early, and all day trekked through
lovely country. The Rustenburg district is well called
the “Garden of the Transvaal.” The land is very fertile,
and you see farms and orchards everywhere, irrigated by


watercourses, which carry the water from adjacent
spruits. We reached Zeerust at night, and camped on
h kopje overlooking the town. Here we found in
camp detachments of Bushmen of the various regiments.
Though the columns were being passed along the road
to Rustenburg as rapidly as possible, an average force
of 400 was always left as a garrison, and it was now my
fortune to put in nearly a month with the troops here.
We were constantly startled by news that the Boers
were about to attack the town, and every morning the
troops stood to arms at daybreak. It was known that
there were hundreds of Boers in the hills. Altogether
we held three kopjes, and we had outposts on surround-
ing hills. About 100 Rhodesians in camp had a Martini
Maxim and two seven-pound guns, which had been used
in Plumers fights. Our position was made more tenable
by the remains of old Zulu stone barricades, which afford-
ed good cover for riflemen on the kopje sides.
The last stand of the old Zulu king, Mosilikatse,
was made on the site of our camp. From this position
ho trekked north, after the battle, to Matabeleland, be-
coming the founder of the Matabele kingdom. This
old king was in due time succeeded by T l charka, who
again was succeeded by Lobengula, the last of the line,
and familiar to all newspaper readers of the last decade.
The Rhodesians christened the highest kopje which we
held “Mosilikatse Kopje.” Zeerust is a beautiful little
place. The water is carried down the streets in open
watercourses for the irrigation of the gardens and
farms.
The native prisoners are kept at work at these
little canals every day, under an armed guard.


It is interesting to know how the place got its
name. ’’Coetzee” came here land-grabbing in the early
days, and, having shot down the natives and general!v
cleared them out, he rested from his labours, and called
the place from which he had driven out these Canaanitcs.
Hittites, etc., “Coetzee’s-rest” (rust).
I'hose who came after dropped the first syllable, and
so we have “Zeerust.”
Martial law was strictly enforced in the town by
Lord E. Cecil, who was the administrator of the dis-
trict. Probably, notwithstanding our precautions, the
Boers outside held communication with their families in
the town, and news of us and food were sent out to
them by the numerous parties, who got permits to re-
move their cattle to the high-veldt. No doubt the
Dutch here looked upon us as being very simple-minded.
They often gave us elephant guns, and kept their
Mausers hidden, and their new-born loyalty was both
facile and effusive so long as there was anything to be
got by it. But, on the other hand, we were not so
simple as would appear. The whole line of communi-
cation to Rustenburg was kept under by sheer bluff, for
our force was quite inadequate to the task if we had
been challenged during the first six months of our
occupation. After the relief of Mafeking, the forces
of Baden-Powell and Plumer, made up of the Protectorate
and Rhodesian Volunteers, the British South African
Police, and the Australian Bushmen, simply rode over
the whole district of the Marico Valley, taking towns
and collecting arms with an audacity which deserved
success. There were enough armed Boers on the veldt
to drive us out of the Western Transvaal, if they had


only known how few we were. It was the subsequent
repulse of General Carrington which revealed our true
position.
Zeerust, the first town taken in the Transvaal, was
captured by the Bushmen under Plumer and during the
early days of our occupation, our patrols used to ride
up to the little dorps, collect all the arms, and, before
the people had recovered from their surprise, ride away
again. In this way 4000 rifles were collected. Such
audacity could only be explained by the Boers on the
supposition that we were the scouts of a great army :
but our great army, four regiments of Australian Bush-
men and some Yeomanry, was still scattered along the
line of march between Beira and Mafeking. In the
town itself the Dutch found we were not so simple,
either.
Lord Cecil had at first employed many of the
notorious spies and traitors as detectives and intelli-
gence agents. The English in the town could not under-
stand this; but the solution of the problem was easy.
It was necessary to keep the suspects within reach.
When the evidence against them was complete, and the
garrison was strong enough, they were suddenly arrested
and sent to Mafeking. Everything seemed to be get-
ting quiet at Zeerust. A line of traction engines was
running between Mafeking and Zeerust, and, under Lord
Cecil’s wise administration, our position was becoming
more secure. Further along the line of communication,
at Rustenburg, our position was very different, and on
July 4 Lord Cecil received a wire to say that the town
was threatened by the Boers, who had called upon Major


Hanbury Tracy, with a small garrison of 120 men and
one gun, to surrender.
Rustenburg had really been evacuated under ciders
from Pretoria, and Hanbury Tracy had entered the town
expecting to find a large body of British troops there.
Under these circumstances, he pluckily resolved to hold it.
At Zeerust, Colonel Holdswoith, of the British South
Afiican Police, got together 300 Bushmen of the Ist
Regiment and, with light transport, pushed on by forced
marches to the relief. Reaching Eland’s River camp,
he picked up Colonel Airey, with another squadron of
the same regiment, which had been withdrawn from
Rustenburg under orders, and together they pushed on
to Rustenburg, which place they reached just when
things were getting critical, on Julv 7. The Boers were
pressing the little garrison very closely when the Bush-
men’s relief force rode up to within 400 yards, in ex-
tended order, and, coolly dismounting, they began to
pick the Boers off at close range. They drove the enemy
cut of the kopjes surrounding the town, with great loss ,
then they rushed the town. It was a brilliant little
fight, and evoked the highest praise from “8.P.” in
general orders. Our force had with them a 12fpound
gun and a Maxim. The first was under the command
of Captain Ryrie, Ist A.Bn., and the Maxim was with
Captain Machattie, Ist A.B. Regiment.
Captain Machattie’s “C” Squadron took a good deal
of the Boer rifle-fire, and he was wounded slightly, over
the heart. During the fight he took two prisoners. Two
of our men were killed—Corporal Walter Murray and
Trooper Joseph Russell-and Troopers Filminster and
-Leigh were wounded.


CHAPTER X.
ON GUARD AT ELAND’S RIVER CAMP.
I was very impatient at my detention at Zee rust,
but now the Rev. G. Bulman, an English Congiegation-
alist Minister, returned to the town, after having been
set at liberty by the Boers, who had kept him in gaol
for months, and I could leave with a good conscience.
I therefore obtained permission from Major Pilsen, the
local commandant, to join the major part of my own
regiment at the first opportunity. But the opportunity
seemed a long time in coming.
It came at last.
Corporal Buckleton, with a handful of men of our
A Squadron, brought in twenty-one Boer prisoners fiom
Eland’s River. He had got a few miles on the road
back, convoying a mule waggon with his little party,
before I heard of his departure. I managed, however,
to hire a Boer farmer who had a ramshackle cart drawn
by two donkeys to take my things after them, whilst I
rode on to stop the little convoy.
After many delays such as only Hutch donkeys are
capable of inflicting, 1 had the satisfaction of seeing my
traps safely in charge of the stalwart Bushies, and I rode
back to Zeerust to meet a man well worth one’s acquaint-
ance—the eminent Afrikander, Rev. Adrian Hofmeyer,
a man destined to leave the mark of his strong per-
sonality on South African affairs—a Dutchman who,
through the stress and storm of years, has steadily fought




CAMP.


for what ho believes to be the only way out of the
‘ African maze,” a United South Africa under one flag
—the Union Jack. Later in the night I overtook our
men, who, together with a half-squadron of the Queens-
land Mounted Infantry, were encamped on the veldt,
and, rolling my blankets around me, I went to sleep
under an ox-waggon. On the evening of July 16 we
reached the “drift” at Eland’s River. One of the
officers had gone on ahead to report our arrival at the
camp, which is situated on a kopje about a mile and a
half from the drift, and he brought back the unwelcome
order that we were to outspan where we were, and
come into camp at daybreak the next morning. He
also brought the news that a big convoy was leaving
for Rustenburg in the morning at 3 o’clock. Eland’s
River was between us and that convoy, and as it was
the last permitted, to leave, our hopes of getting to the
camp of the New South Wales Bushmen near Rustenburg
were once more destroyed.
We entered camp next morning. In addition to
Rhodesians and a detachment of the Protectorate Regi-
ment, we found that A Squadron of New South Wales
Bushmen, under Captain Thomas, Lieutenants Zouch,
Cope, Cornwall, and Bronowski, were in camp, and the
main business of everybody seemed to be building rough
stone walls or breastworks, called schantzes.
On reporting myself to LieutenanhColonel Hore (of
the Protectorate Regiment), who from this station com-
manded the whole line of communications from Mafe-
king to Rustenburg, he informed me that, though he
would promise to allow me to go on with the first convoy
for Rustenburg, he was uncertain when a convoy would


leave, as he had received orders from Baden-Powell, who
was at Rustenburg, stopping convoys for the present,
as the enemy, in considerable numbers, had got between
Eland’s River and Rustenburg. I gathered from this
that the Colonel took a serious view of the situation.
The long and attenuated line of communications, so
rapidly drawn out by the advance of Baden-Powell and
Plumer after the relief of Mafeking, was no longer safe,
now that the chase of De Wet, by the columns under
Lord Kitchener, Lord Methuen, and others, had shifted
the fighting area into North-western Transvaal. It is
to be regretted that General Carrington had not got the
main body of his Rhodesian Field Force into the Trans-
vaal a few weeks earlier. It would have immensely
strengthened the British position. A few days after
our arrival. Major Tunbridge, of the Third Australian
Bushmen, brought a big convoy into camp. A few
smaller ones followed, but none were allowed to continue
on the road to Rustenburg, for within a few days the
wires were cut, news had to come via Pretoria and Mafe-
king, and the situation was certainly not any easier.
And so the camp grew bigger as the incoming con-
voys were laagered up around us, until at last we held
over £lOO,OOO worth of Imperial stores and great quan-
tities of ammunition under our charge. Day by day
Dutch refugees came to our camp with their waggons,
stock, and families, escorted by our patrols, until we
had thirty-eight camped together just outside our lines.
It was no longer safe for them to live on their farms,
without being willing to go out on commando. In more
than one case violence was used against those who res-
pected their word given to the British in surrendering.


Lieutenant-Colonel Hore kept the troops continually
at work entrenching. As yet we had not dug very
deep; indeed, it was no easy matter to dig at all, as
we were camped on the top of a rough, stony kopje.
Heaps of rubble were thrown out of the shallow trenches,
and a commencement had been made at blinding the
outside of the stone walls with earth. Our main camp
was about two and a-half acres in exten*, but we also held
two kopjes.
The first, which we called “Zouch Kopje/’ because
it was so splendidly held by Lieutenant Zouch, of the
First Regiment Australian Bushmen, during our sub-
sequent bombardment, was about 1800 yards away. This
kopje had been well-trenched by Captain Cope, of the
First Regiment Australian Bushmen, and this work was
continued when Zouch took charge. It was also due
to Captain Cope that the opposite kopje, called “South
Kopje,” was occupied and fortified. He drew the atten-
tion of Colonel Hore and Major Hopper to the fact
that Zouch Kopje was untenable unless South Kopie was
also held, as the latter covered the former at close
range, and from a higher altitude. Colonel Hore saw
the point at once, and, under his orders, Captain Cope
began to construct sangars, etc., at South Kopje. In
this he was succeeded by Captain Butters, of the South
Rhodesian Volunteers—an old Matabele fighter—who
afterwards defended the kopje with magnificent courage
and judgment. It was owing to these kopjes being
held that we were afterwards able to get our water by
the road to Vlakfontein Drift, which went between
them. Our patrols went out daily, and came into


touch with the enemy on several occasions. A patrol,
under Major Thomas, was attacked on July 13. Ser-
geant Raymond was wounded, a Mauser bullet piercing
bis shoulder. Our men on that occasion got the wag-
gons they had gone for safely into camp, after the thirty
of them had driven off the eighty Boers. Then, again,
twelve of the New South Wales Bushmen went out on
July 21 to Maball's-stadt, a distance of eighteen miles,
to take six Boer prisoners. A Boer patrol of sixty
got our prospective prisoners, and shot two of our men- -
Corporals Buckleton and Lovatt. The Boers held cur
men up in the stadt, where they laagered themselves,
with their horses, in a yard with a good stone wall, upon
the top of which they placed bags of mealies. Major
Thomas, with a patrol of sixty. New South Wales and
Rhodesians, withdrew the men the next day, the Boers
refraining from the opportunity of a fight. I went out
with this patrol, as Captain-Surgeon Duka, of the
Queensland Mounted Infantry, had gone out with a
patrol of one hundred, under Major Tunbridge, which
also failed to get a fight, though they burnt down Field-
Cornet Von Tender's house. Buckleton and Lovatt
badly hit. We managed to temporarily bandage them,
and the doctor went out for them the following day
with an ambulance.
I had some interesting experiences, though we were
not very comfortable, at Eland’s River Camp. We had
had no tents since leaving Mafeking, and the weather
was sometimes wet and cold. In addition to the church
parades, I used to conduct a service on Sunday after-
noons for the Dutch refugees, through an interpreter.
Sunday, July 23, was a memorable day. That morning


at parade I gave an address from John i., 13 chap., 13
verse: “\e call me Master and Lord; and ye say
well, for so I am.”
I had promised to dine with Hocking and Harris,
two Queensland officers. Captain Ham, a Victorian
officer, was also invited. When I went over at lunch
time they pretended to be very angry with me, and when
1 inquired what 1 had done, they said: “What do you
mean by preaching a sermon from a text which contains
13 words, and is in the 13th verse of a 13th chapter V’
“Before the day is over,” said Ham, jocularly, “we
shall have bad news.”
Sure enough, before our meal was over we saw the
men rushing to the front of the camp, where others with
field-glasses were searching the landscape.
Inquiring what it meant, we were told that in the
distance there was a Bushman evidently riding hard
towards the camp on a horse which seemed ready to
drop. He turned out to be the first of seventeen men
who brought to our camp twenty-seven horses, several
of which were wounded, from the fight at Coster's River.
They were horse-holders who had broken through the
Boer lines.


CHAPTER XI.
THE BATTLE OF ROSTER’S RIVER.
To understand the battle of Roster’s River we must
follow die fortunes of our comrades of the Bushmens
regiments, who were camped at Magato’s Nek, near Rus-
tenburg. Col. Baden-Powell was in command. The
troops were having a very unpleasant time, as the enemy
was very active and food was scarce. On the 9th of
July, Lieut. Cell's troop (B Squadron) were ambushed ;
but, with fine energy, he succeeded in pulling them out
cf the fire w ; th only five horses lost, one trooper wounded
(Walsh), and one taken prisoner (Macdonald). On the
11th, one of the foraging patrols was fired upon, and had
eight horses killed and two men taken prisoners. The
food supply now became a serious question, as no convoys
were allowed to leave Eland’s River. On Saturday,
July 22nd, “B.P. ordered Colonel Airey to proceed to
Eland’s River, and bring back a convoy.
“You will find a party of the enemy in the vicinity
of Roster’s River. These you will brush aside’’—the in-
structions said.
Colonel Airey had with him three hundred men,
made up of almost equal numbers of New South Wales,
Queensland, Victorian and West Australian Bushmen.
Late at night the enemy fired on the advance guard, and
the whole force took up a position on a ridge. Early
next morning the force again moved off, and Lieutenant
Battye, who was in charge of the advance guard, came


into touch with a few Boers who dispersed on a few shots
being fired. Proceeding once more, the advance guard
had re-crossed the Rustenburg Road, travelling between
several kopjes, when the enemy, hidden in the kopjes,
opened out with rifle-fire, after carefully allowing the
flanking parties and the advance guard to pass, and the
whole force to walk into a trap.
Thus the Battle of Koster s River developed.
There were probably not more than four hundred
Boers on the ground when the attack was made, but re-
inforcements kept arriving during the fight, until the
enemy numbered from six hundred to a thousand. The
Boers were commanded by Commandant Lemmer. Our
men flung themselves flat in the long grass, or sought
shelter behind trees and bushes—not a stone or boulder
was to be seen anywhere. Their only chance
of safety was to lie quiet on the ground,
husband ammunition, and pray for the ar-
ii\al of a relief force. Colonel Airey sent a messenger
back to Rustenburg when matters began to look serious.
Under such circumstances it speaks well for the tenacity
of the Bushmen that they were able to hold on for eight
hours, keep the enemy (who was in an immensely super-
ior position) at bay, and end the day with comparativelv
few casualties—six killed and twenty-two wounded.
Over two hundred horses were lost—killed or stam-
peded. Seventeen lorse-holders escaped to Eland’s
Rivoi camp with their horses. The Boers under cover
got very close to the River, where the horses were hidden,
and shot at the horses in the kloof at close range. There
were many cases of bravery. Captain C. W. Robertson,
of Ist A.B. Regiment, was shot through the head whilst.


looking for a better position for his men. Capt. Eck-
ford, who succeeded Captain Robertson to the command
of “B” Squadron, was dangerously wounded in the leg
whilst trying to help Robertson. Captain Robertson was
killed instantly. He was a capable and fearless officer,
and his death was a great loss to the Ist Regiment. Sur-
geon-Captain Ingoldsty, of the 2nd Regiment Aust. Bush-
men, was severely wounded in the arm whilst at work
amongst the wounded. Lieutenants Leask and Walsh,
of the Queenslanders, were severely wounded early in the
fight. A young Queensland trumpeter, Arthur Edward
Forbes, who was horse-holding, had all his horses shot, a
rifle bullet coming so close to him as to pass through his
haversack. He made his way to a house, which, with
others, he helped to hold, firing through holes they had
made in the brick wall. When they had run short of
ammunition, this plucky lad ran out across the line of
fire and got ammunition from the saddle wallets and
haversacks on the dead horses. This he did several
times at the risk of his life. There was a striking case
of courage during the day on the part of a young English
girl, Miss Bach, who lived with her people at a store some
distance away. This brave girl came right on to the
battle-field during the fight to help the wounded, and on
the following day she and her step-sister, Miss Macdon-
ald, brought bandages and splints for the men whose
wounds she had dressed. Some curious cases of escape
occurred during the battle. Troopet S. R. Forrest, of the
Queensland Bushmen, was hit in the breast, but the
bullet, striking a testament he carried in the pocket
of his tunic, was deflected, and passed through his arm.
Out of this testament Chaplain Au!d (who came on the


scene with the ambulance) afterwards read the burial
service over the dead Boers. As illustrating the kindly
feeling which often existed at the front between mims-
leis or widely-different faiths, it may be remarked that
Father Hartman, the Roman Catholic Chaplain with
Plumer’s column, who came out from the camp at Ma-
gato s Nek, took part in the service. Chaplain Board
man, of the Ist Regiment Australian Bushmen, had
accompanied the patrol and left the fight under a white
flag to get medical aid. We met the ambulance with
Dr. Meredith and Chaplains Auld and Hartman, and
together they returned to the field, where both doctor
and chaplains had a gruesome night with the dead and
wounded.
A good many different accounts of this fight have
been published; the principal point of difference has
centred in the query, “Did our men put up the White
Flag?" From a multiplication of evidence, the facts
seem to be as follows: A group of less than ten men
occupied a little rise which was quite untenable, but
from which they could not get away. Most of these were
wounded, and out of sheer humanity a Rhodesian officer
put up a white flag over that position. That this was
not regarded as a surrender of the whole British position
may be proved by the fact that the Boers, though they
cud not fire on that position, continued the general fidm
with just the same spirit. That it was not regarded by
our men as a surrender is also proved by the fact that
they did not cease fire till quite two hours later; indeed,
most of the men had no knowledge of the incident. Labe
in the afternoon, influenced by this episode, which had
been reported to him, and also by what seemed to be the


great number of casualties, Col. Airey, after consulting
with his second-in-command, decided to surrender. Word
was passed x’ound to the men, that as a flag had been put
up, in honour we were now bound to surrender the whole.
position.
There was much confusion on account of this mess-
age, and many of the groups of men fighting in different
places were unwilling to obey it. The message fount
Major Vialls and his command of the 2nd Regiment A.
Bushmen holding a position with much spirit, and was
an unpleasant surprise to them. Some of the men
stamped and swore with vexation, and others cried m
their temper. Major Vialls himself flatly refused 1o
surrender, much to the joy of his men, who, with many
others, didn’t think that they were beaten until they at
least had had an opportunity of charging the Boer posi-
tions under cover of night. Vialls at this time was making
the reputation which led to him afterwards being known
throughout the Transvaal as “Biltong.' He was a tough
fire-eater, and the man had to be pretty smart who could
keep up with him in charging a kopje. He went out in
the “Maplemore,” and, on the transport, when he was not
drilling his men, he was drilling his officers. He was
first hated by the troops, then feared, and afterwards,
when it came to fighting, loved. His name, “Biltong,’
which they gave him, meant more than all the D.S.Os.,
and C.Bs. of officialdom.
Chaplain Auld, in a letter to the “Presbyterian, -
speaks of finding, on reaching the field with the ambu-
lance, the following state of things:—“We picked up
wounded men on the way. There were helmets, haver-
sacks, bits of horse-blanket, and other articles lying on


the road. Horses were lying dead, and some were in the
agonies of death, while others were hobbling about woun-
ded in all kinds of places. Then, when we came up to
the house itself, it was a pitiful sight—dead horses in
abundance, groups of blood-stained men ; representatives
of nearly all the Colonies; and a little further on the
officers, sitting disconsolate, mourning their fate.” The
best that one can say of this confused situation is that
(he Boers seem to have known nothing about it, and they
made no attempt to secure and disarm those who were
prepared to surrender.
Meanwhile, Col. Airey’s messages to the camp atMa-
gato s Nek seemed to have been misunderstood, those in
charge thinking that reinforcements were asked to effect
the capture of the Boeis, instead of the relief of the
Bushmen; and though the noise of the battle could be
heard in the camp, and it was not until Miss Bach rode
into Rustenburg to inform Baden-Powell of the peril of
the Bushmen that the seriousness of the situation was
realised. Then Sir Arthur Lushington took out a relief
party of two hundred Australians from Magato’s Nek,
and Captain Fitz Clarence (of Mafeking fame) took a de-
tachment out of the Protectorate Regiment from Rust-
enburg.
During the afternoon the Bushmen heard several
volleys sharply delivered in their rear. The sound
cheered them, for they knew it meant British troops. The
relief parties drove back the Boers by threatening their
flanks and rear, and uniting with Col. Airey's force a
genera! retirement was ordered, the whole force return-
ing to Magato’s Nek.


CHAPTER XII.
THE SIEGE OF ELAND'S RIVER CAMP.
On Friday, August 3, we heard by wire that General
F. Carrington had left Zeerust on his way to pick us up.
His force consisted of 1000 men, Bushmen and Yeo-
manry, with 500 infantry, 12 guns, 4 pom-poms, and 7
Maxims, and we were full of hope that our long and risky
occupation of a weak position would soon end. We ven-
tured that night to have a great camp-fire concert. All
the men, off duty, attended fully armed, and the sing-
song was a great success. We sang the usual patriotic
songs and there were a few recitations. A Rhodesian
recited Rudyard Kipling’s “Gentlemen Rankers”—
“We’re poor little lambs, who’ve lost our way,
Baa ! Baa ! Baa!
We re little black sheep who’ve gone astray,
Baa— aa— aa!
Gentlemen-rankers out on the spree,
Damned from here to Eternity,
God hia’ mercy on such as we,
Baa! Baa! Baa!”
We put in the bahs in a vigorated chorus, so that on
the distant hills, one might have imagined that a flock of
sheep were on the road. There was the “bah” of the
skipping lamb and the plaintive “baa” of the anxious
ewe, blending with the dominant “bah” of the proud
head of the family.
How the Boers must have laughed at us, for even
then their advance guard must have been laagering up,


PLAN OF THE CAMP AT ELAVD’S RIVER


and probably their gunners were throwing up earth-works
around us.
After the concert was over the men put their quart-
pots on the fire and brewed coffee, and as they drank and
smoked together there was the usual “indaba.
Quite a number of men expressed the opinion ‘‘that
the Boers would never attack Eland’s River. ’
“If they come with a few guns they would shake us
up,” said a trooper.
“But,” said another, rather contemptuously, “don’t
we all know they ain’t got any guns in this district." One
wag constituted himself an auctioneer and put up the
“South African Republic’ to auction, but it was passed
in because he couldn't get the reserve price, as “it
wasn’t a paying business.” A sturdy N.S. Wales man
roared out, “We ain’t seen a fighting Boer; we ain’t had
a fight; I don’t believe this is the Transvaal at all.”
Even then, whilst we talked and sang, and ere the
strains of “God Save the Queen” had died away, ohe
telegraphist came over to the commandant with a mes-
sage which said that there were at least 2800 Boers under
Commandant General De La Rey and Commandant
Lemmer, gathering to attack us. Commandant Steen-
ckamp and Riccard, and Field-Cornets Van Heerden and
Van Tender (we had burnt Van Tonder s house a few
days previously) were, we were informed, with the
burghers.
We also learnt later that “Snyman” of Mafeking
fame, was in the commando as a burgher, he having been


reduced from his commandant-ship by a vote of the
enemy.
We were further advised during the night that the
enemy were well provided with artillery, as they were
known to have three pom-poms, a 51b. gun. a 71b. gun,
and several 121 b. Elswick Q.F. guns, and an unknown
number of Maxims. But only the few knew of these
messages, and most of us slept peacefully during the
night oblivious of danger.
Quite early the following morning I was sitting up
on my valise engaged in the critical operation of putting
my puttees on when I was startled by the sound of rifle-
fire.
My boy Jim was engaged making the porridge for
breakfast, and hearing the shots he sang out, “Bass!
Bass ! de Dootcheman.”
“Nonsense!” I replied—“the butchers.” I thought
it might be the butchers shooting the cattle for the day’s
food supply.
Then came a continuous crackle of rifle-fire, and
Jim dropped the spoon with which he was stirring the
mealie meal and said, as he looked at me interrogatively,
“Plenty Dootchemen. Bass; Icona brekifus”-—no bleak
fast. “Alright,” I replied; “you pack up the things.”
This he did with a smartness unprecedented.
Meanwhile I addressed myself thus: “This is the
real thing; now, what must I do? Well! If I am to do
anything at all I must put these puttees on securely.”
And, in imagination, I pictured myself rushing about
during the impending fight with my puttees dangling
loose in the air.


By this time the camp was thoroughly awakened
and full of excitement. The men rushing (some with
spare clothing in their hands, others with one puttee
on and the other off), to their places in the trenches, sang
out the news to me.
“The Boers have attacked our watering party at the
river and stampeded the horses.”
“They are following our men, and sniping as they
come.”
All this was easily understood, for the volleys were
heard louder and louder, and the bullets began to whistle
over our heads.
Jim was standing anxiously waiting for oideis.
“Where are the other boys, Jim —Antonia, Bully, and
Peter, and Sixpence?”
These were his special friends.
“All a boy, Antone, Bully, Peter ’ —and then he
went on repeating a string of names, checking them off
meanwhile on his fingers. “Some under waggon, some
in big hole, some in among big stones.
“Well,” said I, “Icona waggon,” meaning “Don’t get
under a waggon, but you run and get in a big hole and
put plenty stones round it.”
He did not stand upon the order of his going , but he
went at once.
Those of the watering party who had the luck to
bring their horses back, galloped madly up to the horse-
lines, and leaving their horses tied up there, rushed into
their places in the trenches. It turned out that of two
of our outposts, one had fired the alarm and ridden into
camp. The other was not so fortunate; his riderless
horse came in, and it was thought he was captured. Then


our Maxim on South Kopje opened out. Next our own
Martini-Maxim began to speak. Thump, thump, it
went, as it spat out the bullets. Every man was at his
post now in wait for the enemy to come within range of
the main position. Now their artillery began to play
upon the other side of the camp. Boom ! rolled out their
121 b. gun—one captured from us—and bursting asunder
hundreds of shells shot forward fan-wise with every ex-
plosion.
The Boer marksmanship was undoubtedly accurate.
The first shell burst on the centre of the hill where were
grouped the telegraph block-house, headquarters, and a
stone laager protecting ammunition. A splinter from
this shell killed my brave little pony. We were shifting
our two wounded men out of the ambulance waggons at
the time to a lower and safer place, and we soon needed
the stretchers from beneath them. The second shell car-
ried away our telegraph wires, whilst the operator was
speaking with Zeerust, and then the shells began to fly
past our ambulance waggons and pitch among the horse
lines. The horses fell in sixes and sevens; it was awful
to see the poor beasts mown down. Then we heard the
cries of the wounded and shouts for stretcher-bearers. I
went down to Lieutenant Cope’s schantz, from where the
shouting came, to fetch the wounded. Two men were
down.
It is easy to generalise, and also easy to throw a
glamour over an engagement, but the truth should be
told. One has to be in an engagement to see what “the
glorious death of the soldier” really is in these times of
modem artillery. One man was lying with an arm
blown away, and a great hole in his side gnch as is made


in the earth with a shovel. As I lay by his side, the
shells flying over us, he rocked from side to side in his
agony. The other wounded man was lying with a leg
completely shattered. I had to go to the waggons to
bring the stretcher-bearers, and having seen the wounded
carried away I lay down with Lieutenant Cope to regain
breath. Then I made a desperate rush back, and whilst
I took cover under an ox waggon I saw one shell take
down six horses. This is but an illustration of what was
happening all round. Two out of a crew of four men
were shot near their gun. and four out of five in charge
of the Maxim.
Within the first half-hour the three pom-poms began
to play upon us. What a horrid noise they make '■ It is
something like a locomotive struggling up hill and emit-
ting great gusts of steam to the accompaniment of a
steam-hammer. Just think of it. There is a man over
there on that kopje, probably a foreign artillerist, with
his shoulder against a leather pad, with which he can
move his gun on a desired spot, and all he has to do is to
pull a trigger, with which he pours out upon you belts of
25 11b. shells, which explode on contact to the tune ot
“Pom ! Pom ! Pom Usually there was a pause at every
tenth shell, but sometimes the whole 25 came quick and
hot.
,Then we heard a roar! We were glad to hear that.
It was our own 71b. gun in reply. “Good shot,” we heard
the men cry out. The gunners had hit a farm-house in
which were gathered Boer snipers.
It was just at this time that a new danger threat-
ened some of the Victorians under Capt. Ham. These
men had been with Cope ; but under orders they took up


a new position below the oxen which were tethered up
amongst the waggons.
The Boer gun-fire now found out the oxen and began
to deal death amongst them. It was a double danger, for
the oxen not only drew the fire upon the men but the
maddened creatures were dragging at their rheims and
bearing down on the men, some of whom might have
been trampled to death. Ham ordered Troopers For-
tune, Hillier, and the Kaffir ox-driver to cut the animals
adrift, and he himself was pointing out how the work
should be done when a shell struck the Kaffir and took
both his legs off. The ox-driver died near Ham, whilst
the two troopers continued their dangerous work.
Col. Hore, wdio was going the round of the positions,
had reached this trench and was present when the gun-
fire broke over the oxen with redoubled fury.
He called Hillier, who was nearest, into the trench.
Fortune pluckily stuck to his dangerous task amongst
the infuriated oxen, cutting and slashing at the rheims
which held them, whilst the shells fell thick and fast.
At last all the animals were free, and the brave trooper
returned to the trench, where Col. Hore thanked him for
the work.
Now the doctors’ work began, for the wounded were
coming in fast. They were received between the two
ambulance waggons, over which a tarpaulin had been
thrown. A wall of stones had been begun and was a
foot high in front of one of the waggons, but otherwise
the hospital was unprotected. Moreover, it was badly
placed, being near the centre of the camp and near the
horse-lines. When the projectiles sailed over our heads
in their flight of death to the horses, we had to face the


disagreeable probability of one dropping short and land-
ing amongst our wounded. On the other side of us, the
bullets fired at Lieut. Cope’s schantz, and which were
aimed too high, dropped all around us, whilst critical ope-
rations were being performed. Occasionally bullets fired
too high for Lieut. Annat’s trench reached us also. The
first man operated on was Bird, a Victorian; his leg was
amputated, and his case seemed desperate, but owing
largely to his quiet courage, he recovered. Capt. Duka,
our surgeon, worked in the open with the greatest nerve
and skill. Often we had to crouch and crawl when hand-
ing him things during the shell-fire of the enemy. All
of us round the ambulance waggons had narrow escapes.
When I was talking to a Rhodesian who had been
mortally wounded, and had been put under the ambu-
lance waggon, I could see bullets striking the wheels
above my head and pick them up as they fell flattened
out upon the ground. A Rhodesian gunner, brought in
his wounded comrade, and while the doctor dressed his
wounds, I held the bandages, and he held the basin of
water. Suddenly the water spilt and he fell to the
ground, shouting out as he fell, “Oh! Ira hit. ' An
“express ’ bullet had hit him. shattering the pelvis.
It was a time full of tragedy, and not without
humour. A trooper from Wagga, N.S.W., wounded by
shell-fire, said, as he was brought in, “I played the mail
anyhow.”
A big Queenslander came in with a Mauser bullet
through his chest. “Old Mulga’s hit at last,” he cried.
When the orderly put the compress on tho wound and
stopped the blood, I said, “Now, what else can we do for
you?” “Give me a smoke, ”he said, laughing.


harrier Sergeant-Major Livesey, of the 3rd Regiment
Bushmen, came in wounded by a splinter. He is a
nephew of Livesey, the first teetotaller. An orderly
pressed him to have some brandy, and to induce him to
do so said, “The chaplain says you are to take it; it 11 do
you good.” “I don’t care if 20 chaplains say I can take
it. Ive vowed I never will, and won’t break my vow to
save my life,’ he roared angrily. This patient was very
anxious to go out again immediately to have another
shot at the Boers. The doctor gave him leave to go
after lunch; by then he had, however, begun to feel the
pain of his wounds and was glad to stay.
And so the fight went on all day, until as night fell
the fire gradually slackened and ceased. Then gangs of
men were set to work to clear up the camp and drag the
dead horses out. For this purpose some of the surviving
mules were used.
The telegraphist, who camped with his instrument
in a stone laager, counted the shells fired at us and esti-
mated them at 1500. We had 32 casualties for this day,
five of which were deaths. One of the saddest processions
imaginable was the burial party which followed me at
midnight, outside the camp, to the place pitched on as
our cemetery, where we wore to bury our comrades.
When the flag was removed from the bodies it was a
strange sight which met our eyes. Some of the dead
looked almost alive,—they lay there in the attitude as-
sumed at the moment of falling. A gunner lay with his
knee drawn up, his hand outstretched and eyes fixed, as
though death had come to him at the very moment when
he had located the enemy s gun, and was eagerly pointing
it out to his comrades. We buried them there, near the


position they died to hold, whilst the silent and statu-
esque sentry at the foot of the grave stood at attention.
It was very necessary to protect the hospital, around
which so many wounded men were now gathered. I
suggested to Col. Hore that the Kaffirs might do this and
he instructed a transport conductor to muster the boys. I
set them to work carrying biscuit and meat boxes which
were built into a wall around the waggons. This work
was continued every night during the siege. It was dif-
ficult, however, to keep the boys at it. It was the cus-
tom of the Boers to give us a pom-pom shell or a few
bullets at intervals during the night, in the hope, per-
haps, of stopping our entrenching. They built four fires
to guide them in the direction for this gun-fire at nights.
This frightened the boys, so that if it were only the
veterinary surgeon shooting a hopelessly-wounded horse,
they would drop their burdens, and fly to their hiding
places. Out of these I had to prod them with a long
stick. But I knew that they often deceived me. Once I
noted that a tarpaulin which covered bags of forage,
seemed to be unusually distended, and I suspected that
there were boys hidden underneath. Lifting one end I
shouted out in a mixture of Dutch, Kaffir, and English,
which was common in camp :
“Boys, Passop!"—(beware)
“Mina Wena! Wozani! Woza lapa!’’
Here you! Come ! Come here !
Tshetgha ! —make haste ! Carry boxes—(amabokise)
to hospital.
But there was no response. Stooping down I list-
ened. but could not even hear anyone breathing. Still
suspicious, however, I began belabouring the top of the


“THE FLAG WE KEPT FLYING."


tarpaulin with a big stick, inviting the boys meanwhile
to come out and work. I did this so long that I began
to think that my suspicions were unfounded, when sud-
denly, a great swarm of boys threw up the tarpaulin
(laughing, as though it were a great joke) and set to work,
as they cried, “Or-right, Bass, we carry plenty ama-
bokise to hospit—ah' Whilst we worked at the hospital
walls the men under the superintendence of their officers
were digging the trenches deeper for dear life. This
work really began with the fight. During the day some
of the men had paid various sums for the loan of shovels
and spades for stated times. This work went on, and not
only were the schantzcs deepened, but waggons were!
taken to pieces, the wheels and waggon-bodies were
thrown over the trenches, which were again covered over
with bags of meal and earth ; thus some of the trenches
were even made bomb-proof.
It was drawing towards the dawn when I dismissed
my Kaffir box-carriers and went round the walls of the
hospitals to see how everything looked. Noticing out-
side the walls a new blucher boot (we had a new issue of
boots just a few days previously), I thought it must be-
long to some of our wounded men and I stooped to pick
it up, to throw it over to the inside, when I discovered it
was strangely heavy. Looking more closely in the semi-
darkness of the approaching dawn, to my horror I dis-
covered that the boot contained a human leg. Dropping
the ghastly burden, I sought my blankets under the am-
bulance, and slept with the hope filling my mind that the
next day would bring Cat rington and relief.


CHAPTER XIII.
THE REPULSE OF GENERAL SIR F.
CARRINGTON.
The light of Sunday broke upon us to the accom-
paniment of volley firing. Our men in the trenches
sought the cover by fire to discover if the Boers had
advanced their positions during the night. If the beau-
tiful timing of the volleys was any indication of nerve,
then our men were very fit, for the volleys went like one
clap of rifle-fire.
The shooting was always good, and both Rhodesians
and Australians were good marksmen. On the first day
they drove the Boer gunners from their guns, and after-
wards they had to build earthwork shelters near the
guns, from which they rushed out to fire at us, whilst
our men, who watched through field-glasses for these
times, aimed at them.
The Boers replied to our early volleying by continual
sniping. It is the regular custom of the Boers to post
snipers. These men have with them food, usually biltong
and rusks, and they shoot away as long as they can see,
and usually at one point. The sniper builds himself a
‘sangar during the nig'ht, and makes himself more and
more secure. On both sides snipers give themselves up
with an eager passion to their object. For instance, a
Boer sniper did nothing but shoot at the entrance to the
stone laager where our Dutch refugees—men, women, and
children—took shelter. If you went across to see them,


you had to rush from waggon to waggon, and you might
always rely on hearing the ping! ping! of Mauser bullets
striking the stone door sides after you. Another very
accurate marksman greatly annoyed one of our trenches
by such vicious sniping that the men could hardly move.
They marked the place from which he fired, and they
seemed to hit the breastwork he had evidently built, but
still he fired away at them unhurt. One of the Bushmen
resolved to stalk him. At nightfall he crawled through
the long grass to the Boer sangar, but, to his amazement,
there was no one there.
He was just about to return to our camp when, hap-
pening to look up, he saw the Boer cracksman asleep in
the tree. He had very cleverly arranged the branches
so that he could sit in the fork of the tree, with his gun
over a branch, and the trunk in front of him as a pro-
tection. The Bushman shot the sniper and returnee
to camp, and it was freely stated amongst the men that
he found 60 English sovereigns in the Boer’s pocket.
Another incident is worth recording as indicating the
temper of the men. They were always offering to go
on night sorties, but were refused permission, until at
last they took it upon themselves to get up a little enter-
prise of their own, the secret of which leaked out after-
wards.
One night six of them crawled down to a farmhouse
from which there had been some sniping. The Boers,
however, with the exception of one burgher, who was
brought into camp at the point of tbe bayonet, were
absent—probably out building fortifications. In addi-
tion to their prisoner our men found fifteen newly-baked


loaves upon the table, which they brought back—a very
acceptable addition to the commissariat.
During the morning we were all waiting and watch-
ing anxiously for the coming of the relief force under
General Carrington. We had some outlets arranged in
the walls of the hospital, from which one or other of us
looked through field-glasses, and reported all lie saw to
the sick and wounded. We knew that our force was not
far away, for we saw Boer scouts return from the Zeerust
road, and the subsequent preparations of the enemy to
receive them. They shifted some of their guns from
us with wonderful rapidity, and posted snipers on the
hills overlooking the plain over which the relieving party
were bound to come. They even marked out the range
with a red flag planted on the road to our camp from the
river.
Shortly after lunch the relief party came into sight,
to our great joy. We could see them in the distance
through our glasses; and what a grand sight they were!
We saw the vanguard open out in lines of squadron and
advance, whilst we cheered.
Then the Boer marksmen opened out, and we saw
riderless horses careering about.
“How many?” “Three! four! five!” Yes, we
agreed on five. Still the line was steady. Then the
order had evidently been given—the extended line closed
in and galloped to the rear, and the guns advanced and
planted shell after shell beautifully over the kloof by
the river from which the Boer marksmen had fired. That
kloof was soon emptied; but the guns were not so suc-
cessful in locating the marksmen in the hills above, for
we saw that in the duel the rifles were evidently getting


the best of it, though wc did not quite know what was
happening.
It was during the retirement of the mounted men
that Lieutenant T. Mitchell Moore, of the Ist Reg. A.
Bushmen earned his D.S.O. Captain Baker’s Composite
Bushmen were ordered to retire, owing to the terrific rifle
fire of the Boers. During the retirement a trooper’s
horse was shot, and he himself wounded. Lieutenant
Moore rode back, and took him up on his horse, but owing
to a slip on the stony ground the horse fell and the
trooper came off. All this time they were exposed to
heavy fire, but Lieutenant Moore again went back, picked
up his man, and brought him safely out of danger. The
Boer snipers shot the horses out of one of the guns, and
it was difficult to get fresh horses out of the transport
waggons and get the gun away. Next, they managed
to plant a shell near to General Carrington himself—
between him and Colonel Wallach (Tasmanian Bushmen).
Things were getting very hot; the order was now given
to retire. We did not know all this at the time. We
simply know that the British guns blazed away
for two hours, at increasing intervals, but ever getting
fainter and fainter, and when the wounded men plain-
tively inquired the meaning of it, we invented all kinds
of new strategy, by which wc showed that Carrington
could come in another way. Indeed, we almost persuaded
ourselves that his retreat was a masterly movement where-
by he would verneuk the Boers, take a lot of prisoners,
and, appearing dramatically at an unexpected time and
place, enter the camp amidst wild rejoicing. Whilst we
revelled in amateur strategy, Carrington’s force retreated
towards Zeerust, picking up the detachments which had


been left at various points en route. The Boers came
down from the hills, about eighty of them. They
dragged their pom-pom with them. They had used all
their ammunition, and they followed on the rear and
flanks of our force, sniping as hard as they could.
Carrington s precipitate retreat continued until his
force reached the Marico River, a distance of 17 miles,
the same night.
Hie column camped at the Marico, and it was pro-
posed to remain there until the 7th (Tuesday). But in
the morning of the 6th heavy firing was hoard towards
Zeerust. The patrols reported the enemy in force in that
quarter, holding kopjes on both sides of the road. The
firing was caused by a Boer attack on a British convoy
of six waggons which had been sent out from Zeerust.
The Boers captured five of the six waggons; the oxen of
the sixth bolted, and so saved it. The escort got away
with the loss of three men. Carrington at once attacked
the Boer position with his artillery, and after a prolonged
bombardment the skirmishers cleared both kopjes.
It is easy to be wise after the event, but we often
wondered why the relief force did not make a detour and
come into our camp by Vlakfontein drift, when it was
found that the Brakfontein drift on the Rustenburg road
was so strongly held. It must, however, be noted that
it was difficult for the scouts of the relief force to find
this way until the Boers had been shelled out of the kloof
by the river, and then it was probably too late.
The failure of General Carrington to relieve us had
more disastrous results than the prolongation of our
troubles. Indirectly it led to the escape of De Wet, after
whom the columns of Lord Methuen and Lord Kitchener


were pressing. In consequence of the failure, General
Baden-Powell was ordered to proceed to our relief, and
in order to get a sufficient force he withdrew his men
from Olifant’s Nek and Magato’s Nek, leaving the all-
important passes unwatched. With a splendid force of
1500 men (many of whom were our fellow-Australians),
with guns, he pushed towards Elands River. On the
6th he was within twenty miles of our camp, when a mess-
age reached him from Lord Roberts that Elands River
garrison had surrendered.
This was based upon reports received from General
Carrington.
In consequence of this, “8.P.” and his men. marched
disconsolately back to Rustenburg, there joined lan
Hamilton, and with that General, as supplies were now
exhausted, moved eastwards, withdrawing the garrison
from Rustenburg. Thus, De La Rey really led to the
escape of De Wet by diverting our troops who were in-
tended to hold the neks of the Magaliesburg Mountains
against him.
De Wet shortly afterwards ocmipied Rustenburg.
and placed his prisoners in a cattle-pen there, crowding
together British officers, troopers, civilians, and Kaffirs.
He was speedily compelled to abandon this place by the
movements of Kitchener and Methuen, when he escaped
through the neks.
Returning to their positions around us, those Boers
who had met Carrington helped to swell the volume of
rifle-fire aimed at us. Nor were we free from gun-fire,
for the telegraphist counted 464 shells fired into our camp
for that day.


We had a good number of casualties, amongst them
being some of our native boys. The natives did not take
cover very well. Many of them would persist in camping
under a waggon in fancied security. Perhaps the fact
that it contained some demi-johns of rum had something
to do with their reluctance to leave it. Many of the
bottles had been broken by rifle-fire, and the rum was
leaking through the dirty floor of the waggon, but very
little of it fell to the ground, for the natives, with old
meat or jam tins, caught it, and some even held their
mouths under to receive the precious drops.
One boy crouched behind one of the wheels of his
waggon, and seemed to think he was quite safe because
he had propped a bit of inch board in front of him.
Another boy had put a saddle in front of him. The tele-
graphist from his laager called out to these boys, and
advised them to get into some of the trenches, or they
would get hit. “Icona hit,' said the one behind the
inch board. Soon he was hit—slightly in the heel. The
telegraphist called out;
“Now you are hit, come out of that.”
The Kaffir looked round, found no evidence of a hit,
and replied once more :
“Icona hit’ (no hit). He didn’t feel so small a hit as
that.
By-and-bye he was hit again—this tame in the calf
of the leg.
“Now, you silly fellow,” said the telegraphist; “will
you believe you’re hit now?”
“da.” said the boy; “plenty hit.” And he came
hopping over to the hospital with the blood flowing from
his wound. A dressing was put on. which stopped the


blood, and he was told to stay in the hospital with the
other boys, and the doctor would see his wound again.
However, when the boy looked round the hospital and
saw our wounded men, he evidently thought it was a ter-
rible place to stay in, and he took the first opportunity
of clearing out and returning to his place beneath the
rum waggon. During the night, however, he felt the
pain of his wound, and got it into his head that it was
because he had ran away from the hospital without getting
the bullet out of his leg. He returned the next day, and
expressed his penitence at leaving the hospital, and asked
that the doctor might take the “big bullet” out of his
leg. It was in vain that he was assured that there was
no bullet in his leg. He insisted, and at last the doctor
decided to look for one. The boy was put on the stretcher
and chloroformed, and the doctor opened and probed the
wound, and found that there was no bullet.
The Kaffir was emerging from the influence of the
anaesthetic, when Corporal Davidson said:
“What shall we do, doctor ? This) boy is firmly con-
vinced that there is a bullet in his leg, and he will not be
happy till he gets one.
“Yes,” replied the doctor. “Find a big one for him.’
A big “Express” bullet which had fallen into the
hospital was procured, and as the boy opened his eyes
Davidson held it up to him, saying, “Lapa! Lapa !
there.”
The boy clutched it eagerly, and seemed to forget
his pain in the joy of having the wonderful bullet. He
often exhibited it to the other boys when they came to
see him. He probably wears it now —in the Kaffir
fashion —around his neck as a charm.


Sunday was closed by a very determined attempt by
the Boers to stop our watering carts at the river.
These carts were escorted by mounted men, who were
able to drive the Boers away from the opposite bank of
the river, and ihe water was brought safely to camp.
The great event of Monday was the tragic death of
Lieutenant Annat. At midday he was slightly wounded
above the eyebrow. When he left the hospital I asked
him to come back to' tea. He said he would. It was
just about tea-time when a trooper rushed in to say that
Annat was hit, and they were bringing him in. It was a
terrible sight. The last shell fired by the 121 b. gun had
practically burst at his feet. As we gathered around the
dying man, the pom-pom broke out over our heads in a
sort of triumphant roar. At that moment we felt the
bitterness and anger of battle as we had not felt it before.
Annat was a fearless fighter ; had taken part in the relief
of Maf eking; and was an old Imperial soldier, who had
seen previous service in South Africa. We buried him at
midnight outside the camp. By order of Colonel Hore,
only officers who could safely leave their trenches followed
in the sad procession. Annat’s own men carried his body,
which was covered with a Union Jack.
Our 71b. gun had been used very effectively thus far,
but our ammunition was now nearly done; so we had to
cry a halt. The gun used to jamb, and it was only by
the splendid heroism of Major Tunbridge, who several
times repaired the gun under fire, that we were able to
use it at all. If we had losses, the Boers also had theirs.
It was about this time that one of the limbers of their
Creusot gun blew up with a terrific roar, killing two of
their men.


It was reported by one of Baden-Powell’s boys,
“Adam,” a native scout, that the Boers had a good number
of casualties, and that De La Bey had been slightly
wounded by a stone splinter thrown up by rifle-fire.
“Adam” had been held by the Boers as a prisoner, but
had escaped.
The list of our casualties was increasing day by day,
but at a decreasing rate, for our entrenchments were now
simply wonderful. We had underground passages and
kitchens, and every schantz was more or less bomb-proof.
Best of all, the spirit of the men was admirable;
there was no thought of surrender.


CHAPTER XIV.
DE LA KEY’S ULTIMATUM AND OUR RELIEF
BY KITCHENER.
On the morning of the Bth August a 121 b. shell
landed right into the centre of our hospital. It knocked
a biscuit box off the wall towards me, grazing my face as
I lay in my blankets. The splinters and shrapnel scat-
tered dust all round, and we were deafened for a time.
The first thing I heard after the confusion had passed
was a thin, hysterical voice singing out:
“Let ’em all come! Let ’em all come ! They can’t
kill me.”
I went round, and discovered that the voice came
from Trooper Harth, a Queenslander. Already wounded
through the chest (he was “old Mulga”), he was now
wounded again in five places by bits of shrapnel, which
had carried khaki cloth into the wounds- But he was
not as bad as Sergt.-Major Mitchell, who was badly hit
in the knee. When the doctor put Mitchell under chloro-
form to examine the wound, he pulled his hand away
from me (he was only partially under the influence), and
waved it over his head, crying out: “Now then, men, get
out on parade.” Later, as he went quite under the power
of the anaesthetic, he whispered; “My word, they’re get-
ting me out on parade.”
As the result of the doctor’s examination, it was
obvious that the only hope for Mitchell was the amputa-
tion of the leg above the knee. It was my duty to per-
suade him to submit to the operation, which was verv

BY KITCHENER.


cleverly performed in twenty-five minutes. Poor Mit-
chell, however, sank and died three days after. Whilst
the grave was being dug for Mitchell, the Boers opened
out on the burial party, some of whom took refuge in it.
Col. Hore had forbidden me to conduct services over the
dead at night, as it withdrew many men from the trenches
in spite of orders. This was a double danger: it made a
big mark at the grave for Boer rifle-fire, and left weak
spots in the line of our defence. Hitherto I had gone
out; and, though I did not conduct any service—that
was to be held later, when the relief came, which we were
always expecting—l used to pray briefly. Now, however,
it seemed to me that the enemy having marked our burial
parties (whom they probably took for men building new
fortifications), there was real danger to our camp by large
bodies of men leaving the trenches, and the risk of loss
of life, too, so I remained in camp whilst a small fatigue
party took the body to the cemetery quietly, so> as not
to attract the men fi'om their schantzes. Altogether we
had several men hit by this shell. We sent out a remon-
strance to De La Rev in connection with our loss in the
hospital, and he probably thought it a suitable time to
call upon us to surrender. This he did in the following
terms :
“9/8/00.

Colonel Hore.
“Commanding Officer,
“British Camp, Eland’s River.

pital were fired at from my cannons. lam obliged to
tell you that it was your Honour’s fault, as your hospital


ambulance is in a very small camp in the vicinity of your
cannon, as placed by your Honour, so that cannon-fire
would most likely strike the hospital. I have the honour
to inform you that despatches have come in, the truth
of which is undoubted, stating that Rustenburg, Oli-
phant’s Nek, and Magato's Nek have been evacuated by
the British, and are in our possession. In reference to
the force of General Carrington, I myself drove him
across the Marico River, and loft a force to follow him,
which, on its return, reported to me that he had fled
through Zeerust. As your Honour’s camp was principally
placed here to guard the line of communication-—which
no longer exists —I wish your Honour to earnestly con-
sider that the time has come to have no further blood-
shed. Your resistance, which has been kept up so
bravely, must now come to an end.

thing in it (without hiding or ruining anything in it),
then I am prepared to give a security to your Honour,
that I will send you and your troops to the nearest British

officers, in such a case, will retain their arms, in recogni-
tion of your courage in defence of your camp.

DE LA rev’s ULTIMATUM AND OUR RELIEF
BY KITCHENER.


A Boer police officer came in with this letter, and
paid, in connection with it, two visits under the white
flag. The first time he rode in a yeomanry saddle, the
second time in a bushmen's saddle —-no doubt to impress
us with the truth of their claim that they had taken a
number of prisoners. We did not believe De Lay Bey s
statements at the time, but they all turned out to be true.
We now got a whole morning's respite from shell fire,
whilst Col. Hore called a meeting of the officers.
Some of the men were afraid that the time taken to
consider the Boer proposal was a sign that we were going
to surrender, but it only meant we were getting a rest.
To the ultimatum Colonel Hore replied:—“l beg
to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August Bth,
1900, containing your demand for the surrender of the
British troops at Eland s River camp; and, in reply, I
must inform you that as this post is held by Her Majesty's
forces, I decline to surrender.”
The Boers resolved that they would do their best,
or their worst, now; and, recognising that Captain But-
ters and Lieutenant Zouch held the key to our position,
they shifted most of their guns from us, and bombarded
the two kopjes for the greater part of a day. We were
often anxious for our comrades on the distant kopjes, and
sometimes during a furious cannonade we feared that
they had suffered beyond the ability to reply to the Boer
gun-fire. But ever and anon, when we feared for them,
their volleys rang out and their Maxim rapped away, at
which our men used to say : “Good old Butters. Listen
to him knocking at their front door.” In the twilight


they tried to storm the position (south kopje) held by
Capt. Butters and his gallant band of Rhodesians.
The idea of the Boers was evidently to get on this
kopje, from which they could easily get Zouch s, as they
overlooked it; then we should no longer be able to get
our water at the river.
So close to the summit of south kopje did they get
that our men heard the Boer leaders shouting, ‘ Sturm !
Sturm !” as they encouraged their men to advance; but
Butters and his force stopped their rush with the con-
centration of the Maxim and rifles, reserved to the right
time. ZofuclTs force on the neighbouring kopje helped
to stop the stormers- On the following day they made
a second attempt to get Butters South Kopje. This
time they imitated the Matabele method of crawling up
behind sheep and goats until they got near enough, but
Captain Butters knew this dodge, and at the right time
the rifles rang out from South Kopje and Zouch Kopje,
and sheep, goats, and Boers bit the dust. Throughout
the siege we had. frequent fights for the water, but it was
a game we could play a, t as well as they. Mounted and
dismounted guards used to go down with the water carts,
and the Boers suffered so much that at last they gave up
the attempt to take our water. On one of these occa-
sions two of our native boys driving were hit, and in one
of the carts one of two mules was hit. It seemed as
though the hardy animal, by some instinct, knew what
fierce issues depended upon it, for it pulled bravely until
the cart was brought right into our camp—then dropped
down dead.
DE LA KEY’S ULTIMATUM AND OUR RELIEF
BY KITCHENER.


It is only fair to say that after the untoward incident
in connection with the hospital, the enemy seemed to try
to fire clear of the red-cross flag, though spent bullets
still came in,, and we had more casualties in the hospital
than in any one schantz. On Sunday, the 12th, the
Boers kept up their sniping. We had over 30 loyal Dutch
in camp, some of them women and children. .They began
the day with solemn psalm-singing, as they always do,
the old patriarchal men reading the Scriptures and pray-
ing. In the afternoon I conducted service in their
laager, a few of the troopers off duty attending. I had
the assistance of an interpreter, and it was interesting to
see the men and women shake their heads in approval
and whisper beneath their breath, “Ja! Ja!” when any-
thing I said helped them. Whilst they chanted in their
slow measure,
Yea, though I walk in Death’s dark vale,
Yet will I feaU no ill.
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still,
the bullets were hitting the stones of their laager. A
few troopers were able to attend, and sang some of the
hymns in English, whilst the refugees sang them in
Dutch. It is impossible to doubt the sincerity of these
Dutch both in their religion and in their desire for Eng-
lish supremacy. Some of them were Cape Colony Dutch,
who had settled in the Transvaal. During the morn-
ing the Boers sent in a white-flag messenger to say that
they had Lieutenant Collins, of the South Australian
Bushmen, whom they had wounded and captured (on
the first day of our fight), with Dr. Douglas, of


the same regiment, who was attending to him. They
were willing to send him in to us. We sent out a cape-
cart, and brought them in, and Dr. Douglas now became
a great help in attending to the wounded. We also*
heard that the Boer doctors were paying every attention
to the men in our fever hospital, near the river, which
they had captured. Two or three of the able-bodied Dutch
fought with us in the trenches, and they were splendid
shots. The remaining days of the siege the enemy were
constantly moving their guns and waggons, and once
we saw wounded men brought in to their laager in ambu-
lances. This raised our hopes of speedy relief; we
guessed our men were not far away. But every day we
had casualties until the number was over 75, including
18 deaths, four of whom were New South Wales men—
Warded, Duff, Walker, and Mitchell.
On August 15, to our surprise, there was no reply
to the daybreak volleys. We sent out scouts, and dis-
covered that the enemy had disappeared like the mist of
the morning. JEhit we could not trust them, so we took
up fresh positions, and prepared for another attack during
the day. But at night, as the light was failing, some of
us thought we saw a column moving in the distance.
Through our field-glasses there seemed to be a mass
moving with flanking parties and advance guards out.
But the pessimists said, “They are trees, and you will see
them again in the morning.” We did see them again
in the morning—they were hosts of British soldiers on
raw-boned steeds, and they were, officers and men alike,
in rags and tatters. At 3 a.m. some Western Australians
rode into camp. They had volunteered to ride through


the Boer lines, for our comrades thought we were still
surrounded.
At 7.30 a.m. of August 16 the ox-Sirdar rode into
our camp. His first visit was to the hospital, and his
stern face showed sympathy with the wounded, whilst he
admitted that we had indeed “had a hot time, but we
had made a wonderful defence.” Then his column gra-
dually drew near. They were going through our camp
nearly all the morning—dirty, ragged, and bearded fel-
lows. There were the 17th Lancers, with skull and cross-
bones on their helmets, followed by the 9th, 12th, and
16th Lancers. Then came the 10th Hussars—“De Wet’s
Own” they called themselves- They had the Prince of
Wales feather marked on their helmets. Then followed
the Household Cavalry, the sth Mounted Infantry; the
infantry came later, three regiments—the C.1.V., the
West Yorks, the Shropshires. There was one battery
(six guns) and one pom-pom to each regiment. Best of
all, there were (it was a homelike sight) our own New
South Wales men, 115 —all that are left of two contin-
gents. What hand-shaking! Familiar names were ut-
tered—Knight, Antill, Dove, Legge, Dr. Cortis, Father
Patrick. How their friends would have smiled to see the
patched uniforms of some of them.
As the Imperial and colonial officers went round our
camp, they were loud in their praises at the ingenious
trenches which our men had dug, and the stand they had
made against a force which at the outset numbered over
2,500, with at least nine guns in action against us. The
Boers brought sixty empty waggons with them to take
away our stores, but they had to take them away still


empty. Against this force we had Queenslanders, about
140, under Major Tunbridge; New South Wales Bush-
men, 100, under Capt. Thomas; Rhodesian Volunteers,
100, under Capt. Butters; Victorian Bushmen, 50, under
Capt. Ham ; Protectorate Regiment (nearly all Rhodesian
Volunteers), 50, under Lieut. Myburg. There were some
British South African Police, under Major Hopper, who
was camp-commandant, and Lieut. Mundell, who was
camp-adjutant, and a few convalescents, en route to their
own corps; altogether, 450 officers and men.
iWe held the fort, but paid a big price for it. We
had 100 casualties, 20 of which were deaths. We saved
the stores, but scores of boxes were smashed, and lay
about among the broken waggons. Out of 1,540 animals
—horses;, oxen, and mules—we had only 211 left, leaving
1,329 either killed or missing.
On August 17 we had a great military funeral ser-
vice. The troops were drawn up in a square, around the
graves, and after the service had been read, the firing
party fired volleys, during which the buglers played the
different The men collected white stones,
and placed them rotund the graves. Headstones of slate,
got from the neighbouring hills, were put up, and the
names of the dead carved thereon, and a barbed wire
fence was constructed around the little cemetery.


CHAPTER XV.
FOOT-SLOGGING TO MAFEKING WITH LORD
METHUEN.
After our 13 days’ siege at Elands River had been
ended by the arrival of Lord Kitchener, our little camp
became the centre of some strange scenes. We had the
divisions of Generals Hart, Smith-Dorrien, Bi'oadwood,
and Ridley camped out on the plain. These troops had
been chasing Do Wet since the end of May. It was ob-
vious to us that they were handicapped in their chase.
First, their horses were done —poor brutes, they were too
weak to carry the equipment, much less the troopers, and
the men had to walk as much as possible to rest them
and save themselves becoming “foob-sloggers’’ altogether.
The men, too, had been on quarter rations too long, and
their clothing was worn to shreds. The food we had
saved was a God-send to them, and all day long our stores
were loaded up on Kitchener's waggons until they could
not take any more.
After staying with us for two days, Kitchener left,
and, sending each of his divisions in a different direction,
he scoured the country Pretori a-wardsi. He, however,
left a cavalry division and some batteries of guns with us
until Lord Methuen’s division arrived, with which we
were to travel to Mafeking to refit- On Methuen’s
arrival we had a repetition of the same scene in regard to


starving men and horses, only more so. Lord Methuen
and his troops were to be pitied, for they had done all
that was expected of them, and, through m> fault of theirs,
De Wet had slipped out of the trap into which they had
run him, and they were all, from the General downwards,
very sick about it. Methuen drove De Wet up to the
Magaliesburg Mountains, where he was forced to go
through either Magato’s Nek or Olifant’s Nek to escape.
It was understood that Baden-Powell and lan Hamil-
ton were to hold these passes; and Carrington, with the
Rhodesian field force, was due in the district, too. But
two things interfered with the original plan—first, De
La< Bey’s attack on us and his successful operations
against Carrington, and the absence of the garrisons
from the Neks.
So Baden-Powell’s force did neither one thing nor the
other. They didn’t relieve us and secure a big haul of
Boer prisoners,.which was easily within the range of possi-
bility ; nor did they block De Wet’s escape through Oli-
fant’s Nek or Magato’s Nek. Either of these movements
would have been brilliant chapters in the war, but they
were frustrated by wrong information evolved from some
mysterious source. Kitchener's coming was equally un-
satisfactory, from a tactical standpoint. He was first of
all informed that we were invested, and he made haste
to our relief. Then followed the same news —that Car-
rington reported our capitulation, and Kitchener then
moved more leisurely. Then followed a message from
Lord Roberts to say that our runner had got through the
Boer lines, and reached Mafeking with the news that we
were holding out.


Then Kitchener hurried up, and his huge column did
a 35 miles’ march in a single day, but they arrived too
late to engage the enemy. A staff officer here in Pre-
toria told me that he never saw “Bobs” so angry as he
was during that week of mistakes. No wonder!
It was, however, a good thing that all the army corps
came to Eland’s Biver, for we fed them all. They took
all the stores they had transport for, and even then we had
to destroy some, which we were unable to bring along.
In addition to the regular provisioning from our
stores of the different divisions, it was almost pathetic to
see how the starving Tommies helped themselves when
opportunities occurred. Here there would be a group of
them picking up tins of beef scattered from a broken box.
How that box was broken let no one inquire.
Men filled their helmets, the horses’ nosebags,
old haversacks, and mud-coloured handker-
chiefs with flour, and even officers were glad
to have “good places” pointed out to them
where they could supplement their com-
missariat by the addition of odd boxes of
things.
Sentries were placed over the stacks of
stores, but some hungry Tommy would
come along and say, “ I say, matey, do you
know where I could get some ‘scoff.’
“There’s some bully beef round the corner there, but you
ain’t supposed to take it, but I can’t say anything if I
don’t see you;” and the sentry would march away in the
opposite direction whilst Tommy helped himself. An
officer demanded an explanation from a guard as to why
so many things had disappeared which were under his


charge. “You see, sir,” said the innocent guard, “them
Tommies are such awful thieves, you’d have to put a
guard on every box to keep them off.”
A young quartermaster with the Queenslanders,
seized with a spasm of zeal, became indignant one night
when he saw an Imperial officer coolly ride up to a heap
of miscellaneous stores, and indicate to the troopers he
had brought with him what boxes they were to take
away.
“This sort of thing has gone on long enough,” said
the quartermaster; “we can’t have any more of this
looting.”
“Oh,’ said the other, “we need these things very
much, and I have permission to get them, and must have
them.”
After some more “indaba,” the matter ended by the
quartermaster insisting that nothing was to be taken
unless the officer would leave his receipt for the goods.
“I'll do that, with pleasure,” he said, and, taking
out his pocketbook, he wrote a detailed receipt for what
he was taking and handed it to the quartermaster.
The signature to the receipt was —“Teck, Capt.”
Fancy the Duke of Teck hard up for scoff !
We left our camp on Sunday, August 19. A party
was left behind to burn a few things and destroy some
Boer ammunition, and when we got out on, the plain we
could hear the noise of the bullets flying out of the fire,
and it reminded us of the fight It was a very hot day,
and we all realised how unpleasant it was to be “foot-
sloggers” trudging along in the heat. But the thick
cloud of dust rising from a column ten miles long was even
worse than the heat, and the men could only breathe


freely when permitted to leave the road and march across
the rough veldt, or when we waited for the waggons to be
pulled out of some spruit.
“Do you see the Tommies there, sir?” said a Bush-
man to me, pointing to a detachment of the Northumber-
land Fusiliers marching along and whistling cheerfully.
“Look at the loads they carry. We couldn’t do that;
it would break our hearts.” I must admit that our men,
like the Dutch, hate walking; but they did it very well,
and on the road to Mafeking they were very cheerful.
Oh Tuesday, August 21, we reached Wonderfontein,
on the great Marico River. We found that the Boers
had wrecked the property of an English farmer. They
were also very troublesome to us, as they sniped the
column at all points. We had twenty casualties for the
day, one man being killed. Most of the wounds were
slight. No doubt many of the men were foolish enough
to go far afield commandeering, and isolated parties of
Boers easily shot them. During this march we had an
opportunity of seeing what war meant. We came through
the country from Mafeking, buying Kruger coins, stamps,
and curios. We paid exorbitant prices for what we
bought; but now that the Boers had broken their parols
and rejoined commandos we came back in a different
fashion. Farmhouses from which there had been sniping
were burnt, and those which were deserted were destroyed
when it was known that their owners were out fighting.
Every time we inspanned we burnt the waggons which
we could not bring along, and shot wounded or weak
horses which could not keep up, but which might have
afterwards been used by the enemy. I soon learned that
it was not very pleasant to travel with the rear guard.




THE COLUMN ON THE MARCH.


At Wonderfontein we had an illustration of Boer charac-
ter. We camped here all day, and two Victorian order-
lies asked leave to go for a visit to the irrigation works.
They were allowed to take their officers’ horses, and
after visiting the irrigation works they called at a Boer
house and tried to buy some bread. A good number of
women whose husbands were out on commando were in
this house, and they seemed very willing to sell bread,
and went so far as to give the men coffee, and altogether
were very friendly. After the coffee drinking one of the
troopers sat down at the organ and played a few hymns,
and this, with conversation, passed the time until the
troopers thought they would return to camp, and they
were going out at the back door, where their horses had
been left, when the women said, “Don’t go out that way;
go out at the front door.”
As soon, however, as the men appeared at the front,
a volley was fired at them by some Boers, who, it turned
out, were part of a patrol of about sixty who were con-
cealed in the bush. One man was shot in four places,
the other fled to camp, and I was present when he
arrived all covered with blood—he had helped his mate
into the house- —-and told his tale. The Boers took
the horses. Our ambulance went out, and, much to
the surprise of the Red Cross men, they found two
wounded men in the house. One (a Yeomanrv trooper)
had been shot in, the same way in the morning, and had
lain in a room under a threat that if he gave warning to
others he would be shot. It is surprising that under
such treachery our men are kept so well in hand, and
that reprisals are not more common.


On the last stage cf our trip to Zeerust we expected
to have an engagement with the Boers, and we marched
in readiness for attack with guns to the front and rear,
and strong flanking parties out, but the Boers who had
held Zeerust cleared away to the hills on our approach,
and we spent two days camped near the little town whilst
Lord Methuen made arrangements for prisoners whom we
took, stores which we commandeered, and the removal of
such Britishers as preferred to leave the town. Here at
Zeerust we found a good number of the Imperial Bush-
men. They had been out with Carrington’s relief force,
and were not at all proud of the inglorious attempt to pull
us out of the fire. It appears that none of the men un-
derstood why they were ordered to retreat, and there was
a good deal of reluctance to do so. General Carrington
reports that he had one officer and 16 men wounded (none
dangerously) in the attempt.
What is even more surprising and mysterious is the
evacuation of Zeerust by General Carrington, Neither
the English residents nor the troops believed it to be
necessary, and the story of it is not pleasant reading. We
held the heights here for over two months with five hun-
dred men, one gnu, and two Maxims, and were prepared
to resist attack, but General Carrington, on his return
from Eland’s River, evacuated it with two thousand men
and twenty guns. Moreover, he burnt stores estimated in
the South African papers at various sums from £lOO,OOO
upwards. As soon as Carrington’s force had fled, the
Kaffirs went up to the camp and took a good number of
things out of the fires, but the Boers afterwards collected
these things from the Kaffirs.


The evacuation of Zoerust was very hard on the
loyalists. They had to pack their things quickly and go
out with Carrington’s column to Mafeking. In many
cases the women and children were left, but the men had
to go to escape violence. It was very hard, too, upon the
burghers, who, having taken the oath of allegiance, had
been promised protection by British arms. These people
were between the devil and the deep blue sea. If they
went out the Boers would destroy their property —if they
stayed they would be forced to join the commandos, and
henceforth be regarded by us as rebels.
No one felt the humiliation of the retreat like Lord
Cecil. At a council of officers he voted with the minority
to hold the town. General Carrington's staff, which had
jv.st come down from Rhodesia, seems to have had an
exaggerated idea of the number of the enemy, and the
risks of the situation, and the men who had been on the
spot for months were overborne by the newcomers. Un-
der Lord Cecil the district was being rapidly pacified.
We were always conscious, however, that new-born
loyalty was not to be taken at its face value. For instance
it was a standing joke that at the leading hotel the pro-
prietor had hung a new picture in a new frame of Queen
Victoria alongside two pictures of the Emperor Frederick
and the Kaiser. We discovered the picture of Oom Paul
which was uniform with the other two in a back room.
No doubt, as Oom Paul had to give way to Queen
Victoria on the entry of the British, so on the entry of
the Boers her Majesty would be relegated to the back
room, whilst Oom Paul, draped with the Boer colour’s,
occupied a prominent, if brief, position in the room of
honour.


This is characteristic of the Dutch. To-day you see
a portrait of “Bobs” on a background formed of a draped
Union Jack, to-morrow Kruger looks at you in all the
glory of a “dopper” coat surrounded by the Boer motto,
“Een dragt maakt magt” (union makes strength), and
the Vierkleur occupies the place of the Union Jack. It
is this want of honesty which makes it difficult to deal
with the Boer. For instance, when we went to Eland’s
River from Zeerust, the conductor and assistant con-
ductor of our convoy were Dutchmen who had laid down
their arms. No one cursed Kruger and Leyds so heartily
as they did, and they only seemed to desire an opportu-
nity to shoot “that scoundrel Snyman,” but when we
arrived at Eland’s River camp information had been col-
lected that showed that they were with us as spies, and
both were arrested and sent to Mafeking as prisoners of
war.
The same thing obtains among educated Boers,
When the New South Wales Bushmen entered Zeerust a
Dutch Reformed minister welcomed them, and helped to
put up the English flag. When De La Rey entered
Zeerust the same man welcomed him, and helped to put
up the Boer flag, and his sons tore the Union Jack to
pieces. He also drove General De La Rey to Lichten-
burg in his carriage, and took part in the celebrations
which accompanied the brief rule of the Boer in that
town, and yet when I conversed with the Dutch minister,
he spent the greater part of the time and all of his elo-
quence in declaring his desire for British rule, and his
regret that the “Hollanders had forced the President into
a war with England.” This is not playing the game, at
any rate according to the English rules.


When the time of Carrington’s departure came Lord
Cecil broke down and wept like a child. “This is the
bitterest day of my life,” he said to some friends. He
told those who weie afraid to stay to come with the con-
voy to Mafeking, and from Mafeking train-loads of re-
fugees were sent to different parts of the Cape Colony at
Lord Cecil’s expense. The retreating force did not, how-
ever, avoid a fight, for the Boers had got round to Ottos-
hoop to intercept them, and, having got into a good posi-
tion, they were able to make a rather hot fight of it.
Our Imperial Bushmen had, therefore, some fight-
ing as soon as they got into the country, and seemed
likely to get more. The English residents told us that
soon after Carrington’s retreat the Boers entered the
town,, galloping up and dow r n the streets, decorated with
British uniforms and badges. They had a meeting in the
market square, sang the “Volkslied”—the Boer national
anthem—-and made speeches urging the Boers to take up
arms again. They thought that with the retreat of Car-
rington’s force they were done with the “rooincks,” and
they whistled and hummed the popular Boer melody as
they went about their work—“ Vat jou goed en trek”
(“Pack your traps and go.”)
But after a brief fortnight of Boer rule, spent in put-
ting loyalists in the “tronk” and commandeering, we en-
tered Zeerust in company with Lord Methuen’s column,
which, with the convoy, was ten miles long, and contained
eight thousand troops, with guns and stores. We stayed
two days in Zeentst. Lord Methuen politely insisted on
the Dutch minister coming along with us too, and on the
morning of Sunday, August 2fi, the long convoy left the
little town, accompanied by a huge army of natives, who,


in fear of the Boers, were leaving for British territory
with all their worldly possessions. It was a strange
sight. Here was a Kaffir woman, with a full hencoop
upon her head, and a naked “piccanin,” perhaps three
years old, dragging at her skirt.
Every Kaffir child has his little load in proportion
to his size, and some of the strangest things were being
brought along. I saw a native carrying a very “modish '
pair of lady’s boots and a trimmed hat with an enormous
feather in it, and, thinking that he must have been loot-
ing some better class Dutch house (natives are not allowed
to leave the line of march to go near Boer property), I
asked him where he had got them. Pointing to a Kaftn
woman coming on behind carrying an enoimous load of
furniture and food upon her head, and with a baby slung
in a shawl on her back, he answered with some pride that
she was his wife, and these fine things were hers. When
I said they were “moucha” (good) he was very pleased,
but when I told him that he ought to carry some of the
things forming his wife’s load, he could not or would not
understand.
Some of the English people at the last moment de-
cided to come with us, and it was pathetic to see two well-
dressed ladies with a young baby, who had been late in
making up their minds, hurrying after the column. “My
God!” said a Cape-boy, watching the panting and bur-
dened women. “Look at de vrowen. A Cape-cart was soon
found for them, and their journey was continued in com-
parative comfort. A battery of artillery (12-jrounder guns
and a pompom) waited on the hill till the convoy passed,
in readiness for any attack which might be made by Boer
artillery, which might have been upon the hills over


looking the town. I stayed with them until the column
had passed, and I do not wish to see such another sight.
It reminded me of what the Exodus of the Israelites must
have been like as they fled from Egypt; though this is
robbing the Boer of his favourite figure of speech, for he
likes to regard himself as an Israelite indeed, under a
special providence which takes no account of his sins. At
about 11 a.m. our artillery in the front came into action.
Some of the enemy held a kopje in a good position,
and no doubt hoped for an opportunity of picking off
some of our men, but they were subjected to about half-
an-hour’s fire from pompoms, which, after clearing them
out of their schantzes, followed them till they were out
of sight. The Kaffirs were very excited at this little
“scrap,” and cried out, “Longele!” “Longele!” (All
Right!) “Dutcheman got plenty pompom now.” We
reached a farm owned by Daniel Botha at about midday ;
here we found Colonel Little, who had been wounded
severely during Carrington’s Ottoshoop fight by a Boer
sniper. On Monday we passed through Ottoshoop.
Colonel Mackay was here with a detachment of the
N.S.W. 1.8. Regiment, as was also Major Savage with
the Artillery and the D Squadron of the N.S.W. Bush-
men, attached to the Earl of Errol. In this district we
found a Maxim hidden at General Lemmer’s farm, and a
lot of Maxim ammunition was found in some bogus graves.
On Tuesday, August 28, we reached Mafeking, and
camped out near the famous “Brickfields.”
On Wednesday, August 29, we suffered what was
as bad as a battle. A terrible tornado broke over Mafe-
king. We had no tents, and men, including those sick,
were wet through. In the town this tornado wrought


more havoc amongst the buildings than had been wrought
by the whole of the seven months’ siege. Amongst the
twelve thousand troops camped in the district there were
twenty casualties, one trooper being killed. Some of the
horses were killed by flying sheets of corrugated iron. The
field hospital collapsed upon the patients, and the Eng-
lish and Victorian nurses had an awful time, both during
the night and next morning, removing the patients. The
civil population suffered heavily, too, several children
being killed. After two days of intermittent rain, the
weather became beautifully fine again; we were moved
into a better camp in the town, and we had an opportu-
nity of rest, cheered every afternoon by the strains of the
Bedford Militia Band, which played upon the camp
square.


CHAPTER XVI.
TO PRETORIA AT LAST.
After resting a few days at Mafeking, we learnt that
some changes were to be made in the programme of the
Rhodesian Field Force. General Carrington and some
of his staff returned to Buluwayo—probably to supervise
the passing through Rhodesia of the remainder of the field
force, for there wore still some of the Imperial Bushmen
ajid Yeomanry trekking across country. We, after all,
were not to be remounted at Mafeking, but had to pro-
ceed by train to Pretoria, and from thence rejoin our
comrades who were with Plumer’s column.
On Sunday, September 2 (Sunday seems to be the
favourite day for trekking), we entrained at 9 a.m., and,
after an uneventful journey across the karoo, where there
were even very few kopjes to break the monotony of the
skyline, we reached Vryburg at 7.30 p.m. for dinner.
Starting once more as soon as the mail train had passed,
our long train of 39 waggons and coaches made slow pro-
gress towards Kimberley, which we reached in time for
breakfast the following morning. We had a good oppor-
tunity of seeing the diamond mines which cluster around
the sidings amongst which we were shunted. Enormous
masses of grey slack inclined up towards the high poppet-
heads of the mines, the highest of which was used during
the siege by Colonel Kekewich as a lookout. The slack
is taken from the mine heads by endless rope railways,
and gangs of Kaffirs were at work running it out to


various points within the: compounds in trucks diawn
along the lines by mules. We were much struck with
the intricate wire fencing surrounding the compounds.
It was quite man-proof and duplicated all round. Between
the two wire fences lines of trees were planted (mostly
gum trees), which modify somewhat the necessarily ugly
outlook of the mines.
We observed with some admiration that plantations
of gum and fir trees were being cultivated around the
mines, and well-made roads intersected each other here
and there, all planted with avenues of trees. We could
not help thinking how much prettier some of our New
South Wales mining towns would look if this good ex-
ample were followed. The Kaffir locations at Kimberley
were much better than those we saw in other African
towns, though there was room for improvement, and it
still seems a wonder to us that the natives in these towns
are allowed to live in such hovels—made of bags, bits of
corrugated iron, and canvas, when comparatively cheap,
and, at any rate, more sanitary dwellings could be built
for them, and would probably pay well, for the native in
Africa is usually industrious and prosperous. Kimberley
is undoubtedly an up-to-date, well-built town, and our
only regret was that we had not an opportunity of ex-
ploring it further. Visitors who go there to see evidences
of the siege will be disappointed, for most of the damage
has been repaired long ago.
Now we are off again. This time we were to pass
the famous battlefields of Methuen’s army, and every eye
was soon strained to catch glimpses of scenes made fami-
liar to us by the pen and pencil of war correspondents and
artists. The train went slowly across the battlefield of


Magersfontein. We could see the fatal kopjes at the foot
of which the Boers were so unexpectedly entrenched. It
will be remembered that the Boers had never entrenched
themselves at the base of a kopje before this occasion,
and the Highland Brigade walked up to a wall of fire,
before which they fell like sheaves before a reaping
machine. Here, at the other side of the line, are their
graves, line upon line, carefully tended by the railway
fettlers and their comrades who pass. Already African
flowers are growing within the white stone boundaries,
and the niames of the dead are cut or painted on rude
crosses erected at the head of the mounds. At either side
of the line we occasionally see trenches, and here and
there on the kopjes schantzes, which, no doubt, were has-
tily thrown up to afford protection to the advancing
troops.
Now we reach and cross Modder River. There are
the remains of the pontoon bridge so cleverly thrown
across by Methuen’s engineers. The beams are being
stacked close to the railway by a detachment of the engi-
neers, perhaps for future use. Modder River is just a
replica, of Magersfontein—the same kopjes against which
the invincible British infantry were hurled; the same
trenches, the same graves, and the same clusters of ox-
eyed daisies growing upon the veldt—all forming a peace-
ful enough scene now, but one only needs to close one's
eyes, and let imagination illumine and enliven the pic-
ture, and then we see the field artillery galloping like
mad from point to point, unlimbering, blazing away;
moving nearer and nearer towards the enemy, and cover-
ing by their fire the line of infantry advancing from cover
to cover, until at last their bayonets flash in the sun as


they fix them on the rifles preparatory to the charge.
Yonder, at the foot of a kopje, the New South Wales
Lancers sit their horses like statues, waiting their turn,
and in the background the struggling war balloon strains
at its ropes as they drag it after the waggon to a more
convenient point. All this imagination paints for us,
and we fancy we can hear the shrieking of the shells, the
“thumps” of the Maxims and pompom of the lib. Vicker-
Maxim machine gun, with the ping-ping of the Mauser
bullets contributing an awful treble note to the demoniac
concert.
And behind the fighting line we know that the stret-
cher parties, surgeons, and chaplains are at work ; for at
every battlefield—Magersfontcin, Modder River, Grass-
pan. Belmont, Enslin—it is ever the same—trenches and
graves, graves and trenches. We stayed half-an-hour at
Modder River, where the railway people explained to us
the points of interest, and then, slowly steaming across
the other battlefield, we passed Orange River, where there
was a fine field hospital. The line is guarded by little
camps at different points. At this place the West Lan-
cashires ran alongside our slow train with eager questions
on their lips—“Ho’ are ye ? Are ye goin’ w'hoam ?” The
troopers in Africa are very cheerful, but there was a great
longing in most hearts for home, and one of the com-
monest topics with Tommy, who has seen perhaps most
of the campaign, is the going home troopin’, troopin’,
as thle “Lanc s'’ would say “troopin' w’hoam.’’
We reached De Aar the same night. Here we found
long lines of corrugated iroiirsheds had been built for the
army stores, and well-laid-out camps, with plots of grass
cut at the ends of the tent lines in the same way as is


done in permanent camps in England and India. De Aar
is the junction of the Cape Town and Port Elizabeth lines.
We reached Norvals Pont on Tuesday morning, Sep-
tember 4. Here the railway crosses the Orange River by
a bridge of 13-span, and now we are on the Orange River
Colony trunk line. Whilst we stayed here for a time we
saw buck on the kopjes, and some of our men had a few
fruitless shots at them. On the other side of the line
ostriches were running about in a wire-fenced paddock.
We passed Springfontein, Edcnburg, and then in the hot
afternoon stayed for a while at Bethany, where the women
of the place (both black and white) gave the men cups of
tea, which were very acceptable. We reached Bloemfon-
tein at night, and- great was the wonder of some of our
native boys (camp followers who had come, some of
them, from Trans-Zambesi) at the railway station, bril-
liantly lit up with electric light.
It was too late to go out to the rest camp, so we
camped on the railway premises. I, for my part, con-
sidered myself fortunate in being able to make my bed in
front of the booking office. We had one day in the capi-
tal of the Orange River Colony. Bloemfontein is a fine
town, equal in importance (apart from its official posi-
tion) to one of the larger inland towns of Australia. The
Government buildings are fairly good, and as the town is
built at an elevation of 4518 ft., its climate is healthy but
for a primitive system of drainage which induces enteric.
There are many English residents in the town, and in-
deed throughout the Free State®, and all agree that it
was a well-governed little country, where aliens had noth-
ing to complain of.


Bloemfontein is almost entirely a military
town ; there are soldiers everywhere. Every other day
the military ba ids played in the market-square, and
on the afternoon of our day in that town the
band of the Royal Irish gave a first-class concert before
a great gathering of the general public, both black and
white —the black at a respectful distance. At the con-
clusion of the performance the drums and fifes mustered
and played the tattoo. They marched across the square,
and by a pretty movement, passing through their own
ranks, they marched back again, playing "The Vacant
Chair.” One could not help thinking of the thousand
of vacant chairs throughout the Empire as the result of
this war. Leaving Bloemfontein we passed! many
interesting Dutch towns, but we wiere mincipally
employed looking out for the scenes where: battles
had been fought, and where the engineers and
railway pioneers had performed miracles in over-coming
the difficulties created by the Boers wlien they
blew up the bridges and tore away the line. Under
“Girourd,” the Canadian railway expert, who first of all
made a name for himself by building Kitcheners iailwa_,
to Khartoum, the railways of the Transvaal and the
Orange Free State have been singularly well administered
in the interests of the army. Deviations, miles m extent,
have been made, and trestle bridges have been built to
carry the line across the rivers. In addition to this, the
permanent work of reconstruction is always being carried
on.
We passed the two recently wrecked trains on the
line, the largest of which was at Klip River. The Boers
had burnt all the woodwork, and the ground was thick


with the burnt remains of beef and biscuit tins. There
were £45,000 worth of stores lost in this way. Then we
came to Kroonstad by a deviation which took us over the
falls of Vaal River. The deviation is almost circular, and
as the engine seemed almost to touch the end car of our
long train, we were poised at an angle over the falls, which
are crossed on piled sleepers, and we could see the river
far below, and in the distance the ruined viaduct. Kroon-
stad is a health resort, and has therefore been chosen
as the site for a canvas town of fixed hospitals, where
good work has been done by the R.A.M.C.
Owing to the raids of the enemy, we were not to
travel after dark, so we slept on board the train at
Kroonstad, and as the line was blocked, had an oppor-
tunity of seeing the town before we left at 10 a.m. for
Pretoria. There was little of interest until we had
reached Germiston, which might be called a distant suburb
of Johannesburg. Here the railway traverses the Wit-
watersrand Reef, and on either side of the line there are
mines surrounded with the usual banks of tailings. On
the evening of the same day (Saturday, September 8) we
reached Pretoria at 7 o’clock, having been a week making
the journey from Mafeking, including our day’s rest at
Bloemfontein. We marched out to our camp, four miles
out through Dasspoort, and in a great nek through the
mountains which surround Pretoria we camped alongside
the Household Cavalry. •


CHAPTER XVII.
PRETORIA.
“THE CITY OF ROSES.”
As we drew near to Pretoria by train we were pleased
with its appearance; the trees and gardens were refresh-
ing after the usual baiTen outlook of the South African
landscape, but when we saw the very inferior railway
station and its surroundings we began to think that Pre-
toria was a very mean sort of place indeed. After en-
camping near the city a month, our matured judgment
pronounced Pretoria to be a very beautiful place a
veritable City of Roses, gardens, and gum-trees.
You have to leave Australia to thoroughly appre-
ciate the gumtrees. In South Africa they are planted
for ornament —with us they are common. Being culti-
vated, they attain greater height in less time, and, per-
haps, because there is more water, they seem to
have a brighter and fresher colour of leaf; and besides,
we no doubt regard them with an affection which multi-
plies their beauty because they speak to us of home —
Sunny New South Wales. The gardens in Pretoria are
surrounded by beautiful hedges, usually of cypress. There
are roses everywhere, and all the flowers have the old-
world redolence of perfume.
One of our first visits was to Mr. Kruger's house.
Mrs. Kruger was still at home. Outside the house there
were British sentries, but in addition to these, there were
always two Boers of the Dopper farmer type sitting on


the stoep. They had been left by Mr. Kruger to keep
watch and ward during his absence —"on leave.” It is
characteristic of Oom Paul that he lives in a very poor
sort of house, with no architectural pretensions except
the rather incongruous semi-official appearance produced
by the two marble lions given by the late Barney Barnato,
and a couple of sentry boxes in the little garden.
Opposite the ex-President’s house is the Dopper
Church where he worshipped. It is a rather fine build-
ing in the Dutch style. Oom Paul usually preached in
this church once a month in the old times. I was told by
those who had frequent opportunities of hearing him that
he has a harsh, raucous voice, and on all occasions speaks
in a denunciatory way. Not far up Kerk-street, in which
the ex-President’s house is situated, we came to the
square with the big Dutch Reformed Church in the
centre.
Opposite is the Raadzaal, a fine building with a
statue of Liberty, which resembles the common symbolic
representation of Britannia, surmounting the roof. It
is very suggestive that at the opposite side of the square
there is the unfinished and unopened Palace of Justice,
and near the centre there is the base and pedestal of the
statue of Paul Kruger, which has got as far as Delagoa
Bay, but will never adorn Pretoria.
It seems as though the Providence which overrules
the nations had decreed that the great make-believe
people’s government called the South African Republic
should no longer defile the place of justice with its thou-
sand and one concessions and its manifold corruption, and
that an obstinate and self-worshipping race, whose char-
acteristic type is Kruger, should not even leave its mark


in stone in the place where men assemble, and so we have
these unfinished edifices—“which things are an allegory.”
A prominent burgher said to one of the English
ministers on the day that Roberts’s army saluted the
unfurled flag of Britain in the Market-square:
“This is a sad day for us, but I have long
felt that there would have to be a higher type
of character and a purer administration of govern-
ment brought in from somewhere.” There is a great deal
of speculation as to whose statue will ultimately stand on
the pedestal. Of course, this speculation is too previous.
Some think that the Queen s statue will grace the pedes-
tal, others fancy “Bobs”—but we should wait for, say, a
quarter of a century. The work was only half done when
the war was finished.
The work of reconstruction may be as difficult in
its way as the work of destruction has been. Where is
the man ? Will the first High Commissioner, Lord Mil-
ner, bring shape out of the chaos which necessarily now
exists? If so, his form may yet be represented in marble
or bronze on the pedestal built to receive his Bloemfon-
tein opponent.
There are some fine public buildings, banks, shops,
etc., in Pretoria, but the suburbs Wonderboom, Sunny-
side, Trevenna, Arcadia, are specially admired. Water
furrows, utilised, to irrigate the gardens of many beautiful
villas, run down the footpaths. One of the best of these
houses was occupied by Lord Roberts, and another by
Lord Kitchener when he was in town, and many others
are used by the authorities as offices. This arrangement
serves two purposes—the property is kept intact, and
army accommodation is provided.


A most beautiful mansion—“ Merton Keep, ’ with its
grounds —was turned into hospital for the Imperial Yeo-
manry. The Palace of Justice was the Irish Hospital.
The four forts around Pretoria are of a modern type,
and in good positions. The Staats Artillerie Barracks
is one of the best in the world, and something after the
German type. The Boers left so hurriedly that some of
their horses were left behind. The arsenal is cut out of
the solid rock, and just outside the barracks a terrace of
fine villa residences for the officers. All these, of course,
were occupied by the British officers.
In front of the barracks there is a fine statue of Pre-
forms, after whom the city is named. I paid a three
days’ visit to Johannesburg to see our wounded men from
Eland’s River, most of whom were in No. 6 General Hos-
pital—an admirable fixed hospital established in the
grounds of the Wanderers Club—a Johannesburg ath-
letic and recreation society. The men were being nursed
by the Army Nursing Sisters of New South Wales, under
the able superintendence of Miss Goold.
No one can fail to be impressed with Johannesburg.
Though only about seventeen years old, it is a huge city
with fine buildings. The Exploration building and Gene-
ral Post Office would do honour to any city, and I was told
that at the time of the Jameson raid thousands of pounds
were ready for investment in street property, the employ-
ment of which was delayed owing to a feeling of insecu-
rity. At the time of my visit the food supply was insuffi-
cient for the civil population, but supplies had begun to
come up, and one thousand refugees and picked workmen
for the mines were to be permitted to return.


I went over the fort, which from its position seems
to have been built to overawe the town rather than to
defend it. When the British troops advanced against
the place the fort was useless, as were the forts at Pre-
toria, because most of the guns had been removed to
Ladysmith, Mafeking, and other places, and the Boers
had not time to replace them. The fort is now used for
the storage of ammunition, and a reserve food supplv for
the British army.
The most impressive thing in connection with Johan-
nesburg is the reef. For forty miles there are great mines
all lit up with electric light, and one can imagine that in
times of peace, with all the batteries at work, and with
the barricades removed from the shop fronts and a dense
population, Johannesburg must be a marvellous seven-
teen-year-old city.
During my stay there were some curious cases of
litigation before the military tribunal. When the Eng-
lish were driven out the Dutch did not scruple to take
possession of their property. Even well-to-do Dutch-
women drove in their carriages to the leading shops and
took away bundles of silk, dresses worth £4O, and, in fact,
anything they fancied. When the English entered, all
this loot was, as far' as possible, collected and placed in
warehouses, and records were kept of the persons from
whom it had been taken.
Later twenty merchants were allowed to come up
to identify their property, and the looters were brought
to justice. These merchants also found that other people
had opened their shops without authority. These people
were brought before the Courts, but no doubt it was hard
to make them disgorge their ill-gotten gains.


It was at this time that the death of Trooper Wad-
dell occurred; he was killed when with one of our
patrols at Pienaar's River. We all regretted to hear of
the death of the O.C. of the South Australian Bushmen—
Captain Hubbe. He was killed at Ottoshoop on Septem-
ber 12. He was galloping in front of the line to re-form
the t~oops, when he was shot through the h§art at 2000
yards—probably a chance shot. Captain Hubbe was an
old South Australian explorer, and a keen soldier.
On October Ist the garrison which held Eland’s River
Station was inspected by Lord Roberts and his staff at
our camp. Generals Baden-Powell, Plumer, and Pole-
Carew also accompanied the Field-Marshal, as did also
Lady Roberts and her daughters. Lord Roberts inspected
each group as they represented New South Wales, Vic-
toria, Queensland, Rhodesia. To each of the officers who
were presented to him he had something to say about the
siege. He made a speech, in which he thanked the men
of the colonies for the brave stand they had made.
At this time most of the regiments were like us,
waiting for remounts.
The Boers, however, instead of showing any disposi-
tion to yield, were breaking their big commandos up into
small ones and preparing for a guerilla war. Meanwhile
the leaders on both sides indulged in “A War of Proclama-
tions !” so full of cold courtesy and studied diplomacy as
to be very suggestive of the odium theologicum—and
about as useless.


CHAPTER XVIII.
HUMOURS OF CAMPAIGNING.
It is wonderful how much the hardships of a cam-
paign are lightened by good temper and the gift of hum-
our, which, after all, fhe British soldier, whether English
or colonial, volunteer or regular, certainly seems to have.
The art of looking at the bright side of things has
pulled through many a difficult situation and saved many
a forlorn hope.
Take the siege of Mafeking. The morose tenacity of
the Boers was outmatched by the splendid pluck of the
besieged, who, catching Baden-Powell’s sanguine spirit,
were possessed of not only a determination to fight to the
last, but a positive belief that they could hold on for
ever. The women', and children were full of spirit and
cheerfulness, and probably those inside the city were
much happier than those outside. B.P.’s jokes kept the
place in a continual smile, and inspired the Boer with the
idea that when a man could joke as he did he must have
a card of some kind up Ins sleeve, which he could at any
time play against them.
When they began with “Big Ben no harm to
human life occurred for some time, owing to the excel-
lent precautionary measures, and “8.P.” sent out the
following in a letter; —‘T would like to point out the
serious inconvenience caused by the firing of your big-
gun. Yesterday Mr. Riesle, of the Mafeking Hotel, lost
a fowl which had its leg broken by a splinter from a


shell; moreover, his dog is always running about after
the pieces, and the noise is not pleasant. If you persist
in this course of action I must give you notice that it
will be considered tantamount to a declaration of war.”
Trying to imitate B.P.’s never-failing jocularity the
Boer commander sent in an invitation to a cricket
match. B.P. replied, “I am still in, 200 not out.” The
siege had then gone to 200 days. All sorts of shows,
even to a “siege exhibition” and a “baby show” were got
up, and amusing competitions kept the people in a cheer-
ful mood, notwithstanding the “horse-steak” and coarse
bread they had to eat.
On the march the men are uniformly cheerful, and a
joke makes one forget for a while that he is on quarter-
rations. When the Lancers came through our camp at
Eland s River, after the siege, one “Bravo” wore a dopper
high hat and his shirt outside. He preserved a very grave
face, and as he rode in his ranks with an article of drap-
ery fastened to his lance in imitation of those who still
carried their ladies’ favours in the form of faded silk
streamers at the lance head, the whole army laughed, and
at the sight of his shirt many a ragged Tommy forgot
that he had not a shirt at all.
The humour of the men shows itself in the nick-
names they coin for the regiments. One day in Pretoria
I saw an officer's native servant going through the streets
very pleased with himself because everybody greeted him
with a smile. It was his head-dress which provoked the
universal smile. His regiment had decked him out m
discarded regimentals crowned by a big slouch hat with
a. feather in it. At the tumed-up side of the hat was
printed C.1.Y., and underneath the regimental nickname


(Jan I Venture.” On the other side of the hat was
another name which the City Volunteers, in common
with some others, had assumed, “De Wet’s Own.”
The Imperial Light Horse—mostly Uitlanders and
men who have done magnificently throughout the whole
campaign—were known as the “Imperial Looting Horde.”
They might more reasonably have been designated the
Imperial Looted Horde, for the Boers played sad havoc
with their homes and property after they had run them
out of the Transvaal. But they had their coupensa.
tions.
They came in with the force to Johannesburg, and
many of them located their valuables and noted those in
possession. One trooper went o|ut to thfc suburbs, and,
visiting his home, much to his surprise found it beauti-
fully furnished. A Hollander had, with much taste,
commandeered all sorts of beautiful articles from other
places, and transformed the place into a miniature fairy
land. The I.L.H. man gave him a certain number of
minutes to clear out.
The men of Paget's Horse wore as a badge the letters
“P.H.” on coloured shoulder-straps. It is said that De
Wet, having taken some of them prisoners, asked the
meaning of the badge. After they had explained, he
said: “It should mean perfectly harmless.'' Like many
such stories fathered on to De Wet, this story probably
originated in the imagination of some trooper who
wanted to tell a new joke around the camp-fire, but it
stuck, and the men of the regiment did not mind having
it inscribed on the hats of the native drivers in the regi-
ment. As perhaps was natural to men who were almost
entirely of the city, and more or less professional in their




HUMOURS OF CAMPAIGNING.
“Ah,” replied the trooper, “it's you, is it, Brown? I am sorry to
have to halt you, but you know we must do these sort of things when
we are on active service.”


spheres of life in times of peace, —Paget’s Horse carried,
in the opinion of the irregulars of other regiments, “too
much frill.” They were certainly not better scouts be-
cause so many of them found it necessary to wear mon-
ocles; but on the other hand, they were not worse fight-
ers because they were gentlemen.
There were some situations created, however, which
were quite peculiar to the men of the symbol “P.H.”
For instance, in a camp in the Western Transvaal one of
this regiment was on outpost duty one night, and be-
holding someone approach in the darkness, in a superfine
voice, he challenged him—“ Halt, who goes there?” A
well-known voice immediately replied, “Friend.”
“Ah!” replied the trooper, “it’s you, is it, Brown?
I’m sorry to have to halt you, but you know we must do
these sort of things when we are on active service.”
It is related of another member of the same body
who was on sentry and challenged a figure approaching
in the darkness and got the usual response, “Friend.”
Now this sentry was keen, —keen as mustard, —and
he rejoined, “Friend is it; then let me tell you, friend, if
you don’t say ‘tigah,’ I shall shoot you.”
The word ‘tiger’ happened that night to be the
counter-sign.
Though used to a different atmosphere, Paget’s
Horse settled down into a very useful body on the veldt.
The “I.Ys.,” —Imperial Yeomanry—were an army
in themselves, and their battalions were widely different
in soldierly quality, but they all had to bear the disa-
bility that their badge lent itself to the formation of the
legend, “I Yield,” which other people would persist in
presenting to them as a motto.


That excellent regiment—“ Kitchener’s Fighting
Scouts”-—had a title which caused some resentment in
other regiments. “Was it a reflection on other scouts?
Were they the only scouts that fought?” But the other
scouts got even with them by calling them “Kitchener s
Funny Soldiers,” a name which became well known
throughout the whole of the Transvaal.
The men not only invented humourous nicknames
for their regiments, but some of the columns were christ-
ened with names which often hit off their outstanding
qualities. The Bushmen had several fruitless treks,
under Colonel Hickman, which led to them calling their
column “Hickman’s Hippodrome.”
General Cleary had the misfortune to take his column
out several times without finding the enemy. Being
asked, on return to town, what they had been doing, the
officers would smilingly reply, “Working out Cleary’s
minor tactics.”
General Cleary’s well-known text-book on “Minor
Tactics” is supposed to lead to different results.
It was very touching to note the kindness and sym-
pathy shown to each other by the wounded and sick in
the hospitals. They lightened their troubles by funny
stories and practical jokes, which hardly conceal their
consideration for each other. “Hello,” said one of the
Victorians who lost a leg at Eland’s River to a Tommy
who was limping on one leg across to the ward where I
was visiting at Johannesburg.
“Hello,” he said, “they have left you more than they
left me.”
“Have you got a leg off, too?” said the other, and
then they sat on each side of the same bed comparing


notes. One was the right leg, the other the left. They
feared it would be impossible to get up a partnership
and makei the two legs do for both of them. They dis-
cussed all sorts of contrivances, and wondered which of
them would be able to use the artificial limbs first which
they were to get in London.
From that ward I went to another to see a New South
Wales Bushman. Fie introduced me to the man next lo
him, who was from the Kaffranan Rifles.
“Corporal , of the Kaffir Rifles,’’ said the Bush-
man, with a wink. But the other had his joke, too.
“Well, sir,’’ he said, “I may be a Kaffir, but I assure
you I am not a Bushman.”
To appreciate the point you must know that Zulus,
Matabele, and Basutos all look down on that mixed
quantity which they call a Kaffir, but a “Bushman” is
much lower and more to be despised than even a Kaffir.
We have, I am pleased to say, given the word another
meaning in South Africa.
Many and marvellous were the methods by which the
prisoners of war cheered themselves up. but the most
striking were the excellent caricatures the officers exe-
cuted on the walls of their prison at the Model School at
Pretoria in coloured chalks. One of the best of these
was a picture of Buller and Roberts kicking Oom Paul
out of the Transvaal, and as they represented Kruger
flying through Portuguese territory their picture turned
out to be wonderfully prophetic.
The same spirit that supports the Tommy of the
regular line upholds the “pampered sons of the aristoc-
racy,” who are, it is supposed, unused to hardship.
Amongst the woe-begone crowd with whom we journeyed


to Mafeking there were 24 lords, dukes, and earls of honour-
able sorts, and all cheerful and jocular. There was one troop
of Imperial Yeomanry whose average income, it was
said, was £lO,OOO a year; one trooper in this troop had
an income of £40,000 a year.
The mixing together of the classes and the masses,
the oversea colonists with the African colonists, volun-
teers fighting alongside the historic regiments, all smiling
at the same joke, all suffering the same ills—surely this
must have been a grand moral and sentimental result in
our Empire-building; and though there has been much
tragedy there has also been comedy, and I think in days
to come many tears will be chased away by the recital ot
some of the humorous experiences of the war.


CHAPTER XIX
IN EXTREMIS.
If any of my readers agree with the critic who ob-
jected to considering religion because “one world at a
time was enough for him, ” then they should skip this
chapter, although it is not a sermon, and does not discuss
religion ; but it has to do with the phenomena associated
with the most dramatic time in man’s life—when he is
suddenly confronted with the probability of having to
leave it. I have asked the public to see the Bushmen s
campaign through my eyes, and I have shown them many
things, more or less casual and trivial, in order to give an
impression of what modern war is, and how the Aus-
tralian irregular comports himself in it.
A section of my readers, at least, will, no doubt,
have the reasonable expectation that, in order to make
this impression complete, I should take them into my
confidence in regard to those psychological and spiritual
phenomena which come specially under a chaplain’s ken.
They want to know, not only how men meet the foe
whose bullets sing around them, but they want to know
how the soldier, in extremis, meets the unseen ghostly
foes which assail the mind and soul of the warrior who
must now cross the last drift, and pitch his tent on the
“other side”—a veritable terra incognita.
It is not every soldier seriously wounded who can
take his fate so philosophically as a “Tommy,” who, look-
ing down at his shattered leg, apostx-ophised it thus :


“Well, ye done me well. Ye carried me well-nigh
thirty years; and now ye gone an’ got me a good pension.”
Some take a bad wound nonchalantly; but usually
a man struck down in the heat of battle either swears
or prays—frequently both. I never knew Corporal
D to swear, and he had an equable disposition; but
when he was shot whilst dressing the wounds of a trooper
in our hospital at Eland’s River, he broke out in a sur-
prising way.
An “Express” bullet, which is a pretty big one, hit
him in the face, went through the mouth, came out at
the neck, entered the shoulder, and came out below the
shoulder-blade. Corporal D stood there spitting
out blood, teeth, and oaths, only stopping the torrent
of his anger to ask for the loan of a gun, with which he
proposed to shoot the “coward who took so unfair an
advantage.”
Tennyson gave a wonderfully true picture of battle
heat when he wrote :
“ Oaths, insult, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,
Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs,
In that close mist, and cryings for the light,
Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.”
The principal difficulty of the “padre” who is anxious
to help the soldier crossing the last drift is that very few
men will believe their wounds are mortal unless the evi-
dence is overwhelming. Lieutenant S , who was
killed in our northern advance, seemed very glad when I
went to see him in the Boer farmhouse to which he had
been brought from the firing-line. He talked freely
about his possible death, of which he was not afraid.
He expressed a simple and manly faith in “things
not seen,” but when I suggested that I should pray with


him, he exclaimed, in surprise, “What, padre, do you
think my light is going out?”
Christian though he was, he seemed to regard prayer,
in the nature of a last resource, like an English soldier
of whom I heard, who said to another chaplain, under
similar circumstances, “Has it come to that?” The Army
Medical Corps and the Bearers are supposed to pin identi-
fication cards on the tunics of the men they attend to on
the field. In the case of those dangerously wounded the
cards are coloured green. Amongst the wounded lying
around the ambulance waggons at Eland’s River was a
Rhodesian, upon whose coat was the green ticket. When
I went to him he was most eager for me to pray for him,
and night by night he would send for me when he was
ready to sleep, and ask me to pray for him, because, he
would say, “God will take more notice of you, and you
can put it in a better way.”
He would tell me of certain things, however, that I
was not to forget to ask for. “First, I want a good
night’s sleep, and ask God to give me strength in the
morning, when the doctor dresses my wounds, and when
they sit on me” (he meant the doctors’ board on con-
valescents) —“let it be England.”
Poor chap, he thought he would get better, and be
sent home to the green lanes of England, which he had
not seen for so many years. But it was not to be.
One night his condition had become much worse, on
account of the fierce cannonading of the Boers, whom he
thought would get into our camp. He sent for me, and in
his delirium he made me take hold of his hand and pro-
mise that when the Boers came in I would see that he
“got all the benefits of the Red Cross flag.” He had


lived in the Transvaal, and seemed tortured by the
memory of an old feud—perhaps an old wrong.
“And Von will be with them,” he exclaimed;
“he has never forgiven me. Don’t let him shoot me.”
The truth of Shakespeare’s phrase, “Conscience doth make
cowards of us all” is often obvious to the chaplain. Manv
ft young fellow in extremis realises that there is no har-
vest so sure as the harvest of wild oats. A gunner was
brought to the hospital during the heat of battle by his
comrades, who remained around whilst the doctor fixed
the first temporary dressings. Then he waved them
away, saying, “Chums, thank you for bringing me in. Go
away now; come again. I want to talk to the padre.”
I listened for what I saw he wanted to say, and at last,
with a great effort, he faltered, “Padre, I’m a coward
now.” I didn't understand at first, for he had performed
a brave deed at his gun, for which, had he lived, he would
probably have been rewarded. But when I heard the
story of his life, I did not wonder that he was afraid
to die. I was able to guide him to a faith in the merits
of that one perfect Manhood which, though sinless, was
made sin for us and when he died three days afterwards
his mind was full of that trusting penitence which kills
fear. He was only a type of others. Many a man has
said, “If I get better of this, I’ll live a straighter life.”
When in pain or loneliness, they recalled home and friends
and the better days of youth, and this memory brought
pain as well as pleasure.
“ And some had visions out of golden youth,
And some beheld the faces of old ghosts
Look in upon the battle.”


Bunyan, in his immortal dream, tells of the passing
of Mr. Honest. “When the day that he was to be gone
was come, he addi'essed himself to go over the river.
Now, the river at this time overflowed the banks in some
places ; but Mr. Honest in his lifetime had spoken to one
Good-Conscience to meet him there, the which he also
did, and lent him his hand, and so helped him over. ’
Some of the poor fellows had not arranged for Good-
Conscience to meet them ; consequently, when their feet
touched the cold waters of the last spruit, the river seemed
very cold, and the drift uncertain and treacherous.
The noise of the tumbling waters frightened them,
and they could not see where they were going to come
out on the other side. They would have tuxuxed back, if
they could, bxxt they were like the oxen in the centre of
the span—-they had to go. Sometimes the difficult
px’oblems of eternal destixxy woxxld enxei’ge dxxxdng the fitxal
struggle. Trooper W lay for three days ixx pain.
and all the tixxxe conscious that death was certain. Every
time I saw him he would say, with childish pathos, that
“he had never done anybody any harm, except that he
had always beexx a hard swearer, axxd he didn’t see as how
God shouldn’t be good to him.”
The obvious argument agaixxst the negative goodxxess
he professed was that it neither satisfied his own con-
science or gave him any comfort at the last.
There is, however, a good deal of simple faith in soxxxe
of the most rugged characters, axxd most men are better
than they seem.
Trooper N was well knowxx as a Rhodesian
pioneer and huntex', one of the original band sent up-
country by Cecil Rhodes. He was shot in the head on


South Kopje at Eland’s River when it was attacked by
the Boers. The next morning he was brought into hos-
pital, and the doctor soon saw that he could not last long.
I asked him if I could do anything for him, and he gave
me the address of some friends to whom I was to write
messages.
Every few minutes he went off into a kind of un-
consciousness, and I had to wait some time for him to
recover, when he would take up the thread of his narra-
tive, even in the middle of a word. I let him do nearly
all the talking, as I saw there was something he wanted
to tell me.
I had told him to have faith in God.
“Yes,” he said, “I've some faith. I've been a bad,
rough man.” Then, relapsing into the broad Lancashire
dialect of his youth, he told the story of his life : “My
mother was very poor. She was a widow, and soon as
I could I had to go to work, but I couldn't earn much,
and it was always a struggle. She was a very good
woman —very fond of her chapel; and she tried to bring
me up the same. But I was a wild lad, and never
satisfied. I hated to see her working, but I couldnt
earn enough to keep her. I heard of good times in
Africa, and I ran away from home and came here. It
must nearly have broken her heart. It seemed cruel,
but I never forgot her. I sent her money. Out here,
I’ve had a rough life, but I would ha’ been worse —only
I remembered my mother and her religion. Once when
1 was at Victoria South (I had a contract) I was working
with a lot of raw Kaffirs, with only one Cape boy, who
understood things, to help me. One morning 1 was at
breakfast in the camp, when some of the boys came


rushing from the spruit where they had gone for water.
I saw they were excited, and asked what was up. The
Cape boy cried out, ‘Bass! bass! do leewin’ (‘Boss! boss!
the lion’). Now,” said the dying trooper, rousing him-
self to wonderful energy, “I had shot nearly every sort
of animal in the country, but I’d never seen one o’ them
sort yet; so I got my gun, and I went down to the spruit,
followed by the boys, and sure enough the lion was there
still. I dropped on one knee, and took a steady aim,
for I knew if I missed him I was a dead un. Bang!
I’d hit him, and in the right place, too. But still ho
sprang —right on top of me. I could see his fiery eye-
balls glaring down at me, and feel his hot breath on my
face. I expected every minute to be my last. But
his strength gave out, and he rolled over at my side.
“Now, let me tell you, chaplain,” concluded the old
hunter, “at —that—moment —when —I —-faced —death—
I —had—faith—,” and then, with his story unfinished,
the soldier s head fell back, and he died. I always
believed that he intended to say, “I had faith in my
mother’s God. ’ Soldiers may seem to the quiet, steady-
going workers at home to be a reckless lot, but there is
a substratum of good in them which comes out in times
of crisis.
After our fight at Eland’s River, I rode over to a
distant kopje on which a mixed force of colonials, mostly
Rhodesians, had fought. During the fight two men
wei-e killed on this kopje, and buried there by their
comrades. They were very pleased when they heard
that I was coming over to read the service at the graves.
All the men were on parade, and were formed in a
square round the two graves, which were neatly fenced


and covered with stones, into which were worked the
names of the dead troopers.
When the service was over, two of the men—-special
friends of one of the men who had been killed—came
over and thanked me for the service with tears in their
eyes.
Said one, speaking of his comrade, “He was a white
man, and he always played the game properly. It was
the same when he was hit. It was on that night when
the Boers shelled us so hard, right on till it was dark.
He was hit in the head, and we earned him out of the
trench and laid him in the open to die. We went out
several times to give him a drink of water. Towards
the end he called out, ‘Bill!’ and I went out and said,
‘ What is it, chum?’ and he said, ‘I want you to pray
for me,’ as he held out his hand, ‘and for yourself, and
for the lads as are fighting in the trench’—which I did.
Then he called out, some time after I got back to the
trench, for Jack (we were his particular chums), and
Jack went out and took him a drink of water, and he
asked Jack the same.”
“And did you pray with him, too?" I said, looking
across at Jack.
“Yes, sir,” said the trooper. “What could I do?
I prayed the same as Bill. We both said. ‘Our Father.’ ”
Other people may think diffei'ently, but sometimes
I remember that turbulent night, and in imagination
picture the scene. 1 see the shells bursting among the
schautzas on the top of that little kopje, and hear the
bullets whistling past, and in the midst I see the dying
soldier on the ground, with his kneeling comrade holding


his hand whilst he uttered the universal prayer, “Our
Father/’ and I believe that thousands not reckoned on
the roll of the churches perhaps hold the simple faith
which is expressed in that great prayer, upon which,
after all, is based our common Christianity.


CHAPTER XX.
BUSHMEN PLAYING THE BOERS AT THEIR
OWN GAME.
After leaving Pretoria, Pienaar’s River Camp was
the headquarters of the New South Wales Bushmen,
and they were kept very busy.
This station was the “farthest north” held by the
Britisii on the Pietersburg line At Warmbad, about
twenty miles further up the line, the Boers were estab-
lished.
They had laagers at various points on the ranges
between that place and Pietersburg, with the trains run-
ning regularly between the two places; and from infor-
mation gained by our scouts, and the various parties
who had taken despatches up to the Boer camp under
the white flag, they have sown their crops, and are living
in a settled way, with their mills working, as though they
anticipated being left in quiet possession of the High-
veldt for some length of time- And yet we had taken
Warmbad three times, and could easily take it again at
any time, but the question was, “Is it worth while?’’
Every advance meant extending the lines of communi-
cation, and thereby multiplying the opportunities of rail-
way breakers and raiders. Then, the further we pene-
trated into the Boschveldt the more we accepted the risk of
enteric among the men and horse sickness and other evils
which visit the cattle. Pienaar’s River camp at this time


sent more sick (proportionately) than any other station
into Pretoria, and yet we are over 4,000 feet above the
level of the sea. It was the rainy season, and everywhere
the bush was lovely. The thorn trees were in blossom,
and flowers, lilies, cacti, anemones, convolvuli, bluebells
(we call them African bluebells—they are like the Eng-
lish variety), and even buttercups beautified the veldt.
There were many who professed to see no beauty in
the African bush. For my part, when I have ridden back
over the veldt with some afternoon patrol, and the whole
air has been vocal with the songs of the birds, thrushes,
wild canaries, and hosts of others whose names are un-
known to me; when we have crossed spruit after spruit
all dancing on their way, full to the banks; when I have
noted the rich grasses and the bushes ablaze with blossom,
and then heard the depreciatory tone of the remarks of
our Bushmen concerning Africa, I have felt that Austra-
lians are gifted with a most remarkable love for their own
country if it could blind them to such beauty.
The work of our men here was at times sufficiently
exciting and dangerous. They were the eyes and ears of
the force, and they scouted and patrolled right up to the
outposts of the enemy. One of our men (Macarthur) went
out for two days and a night scouting within a mile of
Warmbad with two Africander scouts. On one occasion
a number of Boers visited a Kaffir kraal in which they
were hidden, but they failed to discover them. Their
efforts were crowned with success; they brought in two
Boers with two waggons and 40 head of cattle; which they
had captured. The two Dutchmen were foraging for the
Boer force when captured.


The scouts brought back a lot of valuable informa-
tion about the Boer strength, their method and directions
taken when patrolling, and the fact, which we had long
suspected, that they were using natives largely in scout-
ing.
It was a constant patrolling duel between the rival
forces. Our side scored the most points.
On one occasion news was brought in by natives that
a Boer patrol had visited a native stadt for several days
in succession. We hacj lost two horses from those sent
out to graze, and suspected this party, so Lieutenant Gell
was sent out to get things even- Leaving camp very
early, our men got into position at dawn, after having
“planted" their horses and found good cover for them-
selves.
They had to wait a long time, and towards the end
actually had the Boer pati’ol under observation with field
glasses for three hours At length they came along the
expected road, and our party secured the lot after wound-
ing two. They also got back one of our stolen horses.
The Boer patrol was led by Field-Cornet Von Hahn, of
the Free State. Mr. Gell was not at all jubilant about
the work, and was regretting the necessity of ambushes
when Von Hahn cheered him up by assuring him that he
had been trying for three days to ambush one of our
patrols. To show on what apparently little things the
success of a patrol depends, I record this incident.
“What did you leave that knee-haltered horse graz-
m * O
ing on the flat for?" said Von Hahn to Gell.
He was no use to us, replied Mr. Gell with a smile.


“We saw tliat horse when we came out, and when I
saw that he was quietly grazing in the same place on our
return, I argued that there could be no Bushmen about,
for neither party lose opportunities of getting horses/'
Had that horse not been purposely left in quietness
most likely our men would have missed the capture. A
little later another opportunity occurred which did not
come off quite so well. The natives reported that the
enemy were visiting a hillock called The Rocks, near the
stadt, which is seven miles from our camp, at a place
called Valboschfontein. The supposition was that the
enemy was either finding gun positions for a probable
attack on us (they were visiting all the high ground round
our camp) or they were taking regular observations of
our movements, i.e., the positions of our outposts or guns,
and the direction taken by our patrols- In either or
both cases it was equally desirable to capture their patrol,
which was of varying strength, but always arrived early.
On one of our usual afternoon rides, Captain Eckford and
Lieutenant Cell examined the place, and found a good
plant for horses. The next day, at 3.30 a.m., our little
company mounted in the half-light of a cloudy morning.
As it was a rather larger patrol than usual (17 all told),
I accompanied them, taking bandages in my wallets in
case of casualties. Making a wide circuit, in order to
avoid the range of field-glasses, we rode into cover and
then extended.
Gell went ahead with an advance guard of four, Eck-
ford leading the main line with carbine poised in right
hand, with which he silently gave his orders by the well-
known signs for mounted infantry. From the non-com


batants’ position in the rear I could see every point of
the game. At an easy canter the men rode here and there,
seeking for tracks or sight of the enemy. Eckford kept
the main body in touch with the advance guard.
Suddenly the news was passed along, “A horseman
to the right.’
Away raced the nearest trooper, from cover to cover,
after him, and he soon returned to report that it was a
native on a raw-boned steed carrying news to the camp.
On we went again. Very soon the word was passed
along, “Wire !” and we made a detour to avoid the broken
wire fence- A horseman running into wire might set it
a»-jingling, and thus convey the news of our coming to an
eager enemy. All safely we reached the proximity of
the rocks, and scouts went forward and ascertained that
our friends the enemy had not arrived. It was now day-
break, and threatening rain. The horses were "planted”
in good cover, corailed together in a circle; horse-holders
were detailed; the men rested whilst four of them rode
forward to feel for the enemy. Dismounted men were
told off to positions around the ambush to convey the
first news of the enemy, and I was sent to the native stadt
to find an empty hut for shelter from the approaching
storm. Now, we could only wait for the return of our
four scouts, and soon we heard the thud, thud of a horse
galloping in, and No. 1 scout reported he had seen the
enemy approaching towards us —there were eight of them.
Then we heard a shot, and No. 2 scout came in and re-
ported he had fired the shot to warn us of the enemy,
who had seen him, and for a time chased him, then turned
on their tracks —there might be eighteen of them. No- 3


scout next came in, and reported eight Boers, who were
making on their way as hard as they could gallop back to
Warmbad. Mr. Gell immediately proposed taking the
advance guard and trying to cut them off. He went, and
followed for four miles in the drenching rain, but they
were too fast. We sent out after No. 4 scout, who was
returning to report that he, too, had seen eight Boers.
Then whilst we talked there came a terrific crash. “Pom,
pom,” muttered some of the men, as they involuntarily
ducked, but it was nothing worse than a terrific peal of
thunder, very like artillery, and we were glad to run
through the rain to the friendly shelter of the Kaffir hut.
On Mr. Gell’s return we made our way back to camp, wet-
through, in time for breakfast.
These incidents show the regular work of the Bush-
men in this district. Our next events worthy of record
culminated on November 25 and 26. On the early morn-
ing of those two days our whole camp stood to arms from
4 a.m., our Bushmen standing by their horses ready to
escort the guns into action. The Boers had for some time
shown great activity, and our intelligence department
had numberless messages from its agents to say that on
either of those days the enemy would attack. But the
men stood in the rain for hours, and there was no attack.
This was repeated a few days later, and the intelligence
department was so insistent that a company of the Gor-
don Highlanders came up by special train to reinforce us-
But this was probably all a dodge of the wily Boer to keep
us busy whilst they had sent out all their available men
to fight Paget’s column, which had reached Rhenoster
Kop, and Lyttelton’s column, which had arrived in the


neighbourhood of Balmoral. Between these two columns
the Boers had a very strong position in the kopjes, and a
big action developed on November 26 and continued till
November 29. Our A Squadron were in it, but had no
casualties; they were at different times escorting the guns
and the convoy. There were 150 casualties on our side,
and the New Zealanders suffered heavily. The enemy
were driven from their position, and we occupied it. Un-
fortunately, the Boers were able to prevent the junction
of Lyttelton and Paget, which was the British object;
and thus they ensured their own escape. Commandants
Erasmus and Viljoen seem to have commanded the Boers
opposed to Pagets’a force, which numbered 1500.


CHAPTER XXI.
HOW WE SPENT CHRISTMAS.
Now, Christmas came down upon us, and we made
lip our minds to enjoy it, if possible. We did manage
to get a few of the thousands of plum puddings which
were sent to Africa. We also issued the first number of
a manuscript journal, The Reveille, which went round
amusing the different detachments in camp, particularly
by its poetry and pen-and-ink sketches.
Christmas Day was begun by us by a big church
parade, at which we sang Christmas hymns. In the
afternoon we had a gymkhana, where the Bushmen got
a big share of the prizes. Wrestling on muleback was
the most amusing event; and at night we had an open-
air concert. We also had a big programme of sports
for New Year’s Day, and a band concert on New Year's
Eve.
We were in constant communication with our com-
rades at Hammons Kraal, as our patrols leaving camp
at daybreak each day met their patrols half way on the
road. They sent their contributions to our newspaper,
which afterwards circulated among them for a few days.
Perhaps the best way to indicate how we passed our time
at this period will be to reproduce a copy of The Reveille
and let it speak for us.

A TRIP TO WARMBATHS.
WITH A WHITE FLAG.
BY SERGT. FOSTER, N.S.W.B.
About 1 p.m. on Friday, December 21, Trooper Fred.
Houchen and myself, Act. S.M. Foster, both of tho Ist
Regt. Australian Bushmen, were detailed to proceed to
Warmbaths with despatches for the Boer commandants
there. After equipping ourselves with the necessary
bandages and the magic flag, and receiving our orders and
the despatches, we started by the old waggon road at
about 2 p.m. We never expected to meet any of the
enemy until within a few miles of the Boer encampment,
and in this out surmises were well founded, for we had
gone as far as the second red house on the railway line
before we fell in with a patrol of Boers. We were getting


a drink of water from the tank when we noticed a patrol
of six coming from the direction of Warmbaths. We
saw them before they saw us, and you can be positively
certain I never furled the white flag, which consisted of
a white (not too white) handkerchief, bound to a sjambok.
On catching sight of us the Dutchmen cantered close to-
gether, and held a hurried consultation, and then spread
out again and waited for our arrival. On reaching them
I explained our business, and at the same time took them
out of winding. They were not a very murderous-looking
set, three of them being mere boys, with the characteristic
lantern jaw and downcast expression peculiar to the Boer
youth. The other three men were decent enough look-
ing, dressed mostly in patches, but unlike the general
run they were clean. Of the six only one was armed
with a Mauser rifle, the others being all armed with the
Martini-Henry, except one, who had a Lee-Metford.
Their horses were all of the pony class, just on the turn
of condition, carrying huge bellies, as a fattening horse
does. On the whole, they were a good class of horses,
and much better than I expected. Their saddlery and
gear were made up of all sorts of English mixtures, such
as cartridge belts for rifle buckets, etc.; and one boy I
noticed had a pair of leggings made from one of our thick
numnahs—altogether a scratch turn-out. All we spoke
to could speak English fluently, and well. We were
sent in to Warmbaths under escort of two' young fellows,
both speaking English well. They were not very com-
municative, and were very wary of touching on any war
matters. We broached the subject once or twice, but,
besides the fact that they were confident of success and
hoped soon, to get back the whole of the Transvaal, we


could elicit nothing. When we had gone about three
miles, I saw three horses grazing about a mile ahead,
but never said anything until wc were fairly close to
them, and then I saw it was a Boer post. We got well
within a quarter of a mile of them when we saw them
mount and ride away, never having seen us. We ex-
pected every moment now to be blindfolded, but we were
led right into the hotel without having to undergo that
inconvenience. One of our guards left us here to go
and inform the Commandant; so we were now in charge
of only one man. We were taken into the hotel and
shown a room in which to have a wash and prepare for
tea. After washing, etc., wc came out and roamed
about unchecked, until we were summoned to tea. Tea
was served in the large dining-room that the hotel can
boast of, and we were seated at a small “King Arthur’’
table, along with our guard. We had ham cooked to a
nicety; plenty of bread and butter and coffee—not a bad
meal for a hurriedly-prepared one, and we did it full
justice. After tea we went out by ourselves and stabled
our horses, and sauntered back at our leisure. We were
left to our own devices) for about an hour, when our
guard intimated that we had better turn in. We were
put into a luxuriantly-furnished room, with a huge double
bed, and asked if we minded sleeping together. This,
we assured them, was no hardship after our life on the
veldt. So we turned in, our guard occupying a room in
front, through which we would have had to pass to es-
cape; but, of course, they quite overlooked fastening the
window, which could have been easily opened, and by
which we could have entered the garden. We were
awakened about 6 o’clock by a boy with coffee for us,


and right well it tasted. We were all ready now to be
let out of our room, but we were kept under lock and
key, only allowed into a room off ours, which was a kind
of sitting-room. Here we sat down and waited, events.
Presently two Boers were ushered in, and sat down. One
man kept us alive by his tales of travel and his fund of
general information. He kept off the topic of the war
as much as possible, and expressed his disgust at the
time that was wasted on both sides. A smart-looking
officer then came in, dressed in all the glory of an artil-
lerist's uniform, bedecked with gold lace galore; and
very smart he looked. He asked for the despatches,
which I gave him; then he asked if there was anyone
of rank among us. I explained. I was a sort of amateur
sergeant-major. He excused himself, and left us, re*-
turning immediately with a pocket full of cigars, which
he left us and again retired. We found out he was a
Lieutenant Du Toit, in the Boer artillery. He sent
us in some spirits and cigarettes and tobacco, and another
box of cigars, and, in fact, could not have been treated
better had we been princes of the blood; in fact, I had
to look at some envelopes I had in my pocket to make
sure I was not a Lord or Sir Somebody. During the
interval between drinks, etc., a crowd of Boers kept
peeping at us through the window, and I, for one, felt
as I should imagine an animal in the Zoological Gardens
must feel. This crowd was brought about the window,
we felt sure, to impress us with their strength, as in
Shakespeare—“ Lest the opposed numbers pluck their
hearts from them.” Amid the laughing and jesting
one man started whistling “Soldiers of the Queen," and
in this we helped him, also various other little bits of


garden stuff in the shape of the “Old Folks at Home”
and “Home, Sweet Home.” After delivering these harm-
less thrusts, they all adjourned to the piano, where to a
vamp accompaniment they sang some sort of National
Hymn in their own jargon, not intelligible to us. Break-
fast was next brought us by two uniformed men. It
consisted of porridge without sugar, but plenty of rich
milk; steak, sardines, bread and butter, cake, and fruit
(consisting of grapes and bananas grown locally). We
were informed during the meal that England’s avarice
caused this war, and that the Boers had the assistance
of a lot of American soldiers, and were sure of European
intervention. However, we had a> salt-cellar on the
table, which we used freely. We also learned Kruger
was coming back, and various other Munchausen tales.
Our informant seems to be a regular pocket edition of
De Rougcmont. After breakfast our guards retired,
and Lieutenant Du Toit returned, and we spent a very
pleasant hour with him. He told us our answer would
soon come, so we could return; but we were in no hurry.
We found him a very pleasant and witty entertainer,
and we were quit© amused at his tales. He showed
great regret at the departure of the C'.l.Vs., as he says
the Boers could get anything they liked from them.
He says they also have some C.I.Ys. among them. ihe
Imperial Yeomanry took his fancy most, though, and
he seemed not to admire them. He deplored the fact
that we could not meet half-way to' have a cricket match
on Christmas Day, and also that he had no chocolate
or plum pudding with which to fill some fancy shells to
send us. When dilating on the advantages of the
country 1 had to remind him he had all the plagues


of the old Egyptians, and one over. I explained that
he had the locusts, lice, frogs, hail, murrain, etc., and
one extra. He seemed very curious about the extra
one, so I told him it was “the gentleman in khaki.” He
agreed he was the greatest plague at present in South
Africa. About 11 o'clock a messenger came with our
answer from Commandant Rensburgh, so we agreed to
start for camp again. We were blindfolded and led
out, having had a nice lunch prepared and packed up
for us, also a lot of fruit. The Lieutenant accompanied
us a few miles out. We met about fifteen horsemen,
who we could tell were sent round two or three times to
impress us with their numbers. After they passed, our
bandages were taken off, and we came along home to
Pienaar’s River, after having spent a verv enjoyable
time.
“HAMMON’S KRAAL LETTER.”
BY “B.”
“Fall in ! all those who wish to go home !!” That's
the order we are all waiting to hear up at Hammon’s
Kraal; but, instead, we only hear, “Fall in for dead-
horse fatigue!' - The horses are dying up here. The
Bushmen say it is horse-sickness, and our doctor says he
is sure it is a sickness of some sort. Ido not like to
doubt the word of o\u* M. 0., but it does look strange,
doantit?
We are all Highlanders and Bushmen up here; all
men of fine figure. I know now why “ye canna tak
the breeks frae a Highlander"; but you must not say


that to them, ’cos they get angry, and when they get
angry-—you just slope, and say no more about it.
I like the “Bushmen. They have such winning
ways—especially if you play cards with them. One of
their officers is a regular wild fellow, who beats the
Gordons on the head with a bamboo. The other is a
little furren chap, a fair devil to go, especially when he
is chased by a big Highlander.
We are well fortified at Hammon’s. We get rum
twice a week, and lots of limejuice, so we are ready for
any emergency. By-the-way, we also have a couple of
forts. I have not seen them myself, and people say that
it is impossible to see them for barbed wire.
W e were attacked the other night by an Intelligent
Native Scout, a huge black mastiff, and an “Italian
Anarchist." They were armed with knobkerries. Our
men behaved with great gallantry, and drove the enemy
from an untenable position in the bed of the river, with
enormous loss. Our O.C. has not been able to sleep
since; he is a very watchful old man. The ladies call
him “Le Generale,’’ and I think he likes it, too.
Collisions occur not only on the “briny” (may we
be there soon), and this was proved conclusively a few
days back to—well, not the “bugler”—when a member .
of a corps supposed to bo comprised of good riders was
unable to find room for two horses in camp. If you
happen to suggest in the “bugler’s” presence that the
members of the above corps can ride, the statement will
probably be received with an ominous silence.


THE FUNERAL OF OLD “SWIFT.”
TOLD BY A TRANSPORT RIDER.
We planted ’im slowly at dead o’ night,
With fingers our noses stopping.
He was a mule we’d loved with all our might,
Though he ’ad a habit of propping.
He joined our team at Mafeking,
We all admired his color.
’Ad it not been for ’is way of roaring,
You’d ’a thought ’e was a 'orse’s brother.
When the other mules wouldn’t pull,
Our Cape-cart stuck in a drift,
His lines were taut, his breastplate full,
An’ we said, “ If they were only all like ‘Swift. ”
He should ’a been a ’orse—he’d such a heart,
Nothing could keep ’im under.
D’ye remember ’ow ’e brought the water-cart ?
My ! that was a time—by thunder !
Our tongues was a-lolling out with thirst,
And we ’ad Mauseritus bad ;
The Dutch, from a kopje had got us first.
Oh, old ’Rasmus,* ’es a cad.
We waltzed ’crorst the flat to drive ’em out ;
“ Pom-pom,” was the tune.
But we ’ad to sit tight, to save a rout,
Till the sun was relieved by the moon.
Through that ’orful day we’d nothing to drink.
“ We’ll try the crik,” said Bill.
We sent the cart—it got down to the brink ;
They spotted it on the hill.
* Conimandant-Genl. Erasmus.


They hit pore Bill—t’other mule fell.
He cut it away and held on.
“ Swift ” brought us the water all by Ids sel’.
At sun-up we got their “pom-pom.”
After that we excused his “prop,”
He became a sort o’ king among mules ;
And now ’e’s done and ’as ’ad to drop,
And we’re standing round like fools.
Cover ’im up snugly, lay Mm away ;
There ain’t many like ’im out here.
But ’e’s done Ms bit and ’ad Ms day,
And, blow me ! I could shed a tear.

“A PSALM OF LIFE.”
BY LANCE-COR. W. M. HUGHES, N.B.W. BUSHMEN.
After “ Longfellow ” —(A long time after).
Tell me not in mournful numbers
That we can’t go home till June,
In the voice of one who slumbers,
I say let us all go soon.
War is real, that’s war in earnest,
When both shies in battle fall ;
But chasing niggers’ yarns at midnight,
We don’t call that war at all.
Lives of great men all remind us
Federation is sublime ;
“ Duke of York,” and “ Toby Barton,”
Pray, do get us home in time.
HOSPITAL YARNS.
We have a good number of sick at Pienaar s River
Camp always, and there is no better place for getting at
the opinions of “Tommy Atkins” than a field hospital.
Here the “swaddie” has nothing to do except yarn;
no fatigues, no outposts in wet trenches, no “standing


to arms in the cold of day-dawn, no dangerous patrols—
nothing to do but to recount his experiences and achieve-
ments on many fields, and, if a “regler” in many lands,
to admiring comrades (the more admiring if these com-
rades happen to be recruits or irregulars), and count the
moments as they fly, bringing at too remote intervals the
orderly with “skofi"’ or at too frequent intervals medicine.
In the hospital the sick soldier will give you his opinions
of things in general and the British Army in particular,
with freedom and fullness. You will hear him reiterate
his opinion that “Bobs’’ was “all right as far as Pre-
toria,” but now “he’s too soft with them Boers.” “Kit-
chener is the man to finish the job.’’ “He’ll stand none
o' ther slim, sniping ways.” “He’s a hard ’un, ain’t
he?’’ “Do you remember that time, chum, when he
ordered us to ?” “Don’t I! The beast!’’
“Strange, isn’t it?” that Tommy always speaks well
uf the Generals who are hardest upon him. “Kitchener,”
“Macdonald,” “Gatacre,” “Tommy” speaks well of them
in a mixed sort of way. One of the most noticeable
things amongst the “reglers” is the way they all look
forward to India. There, promotions are more rapid
and pay goes further. Even the ordinary “soger” gets
a lot for his money, and to the officer India means higher
pay and less expense than Africa. (P.S. —This cam-
paign is very expensive for all ranks, because the diffi-
culties of transport in an enemy’s country puts prices
up.) And sport, which is deal- to the heart of every
Englishman, is plentiful in India. The “Munsters” in
this camp expect to go to India, and so it often happens
that whilst in the hospital the old soldier who has been
there will droji into an Indian yarn.


They had been talking of the scouting of the Bush-
men. The transition to Indian “Cavalry” is easy.
“They have some good native cavalry in India,” said
Veteran No. 1. “Some of the Rajahs has fine regiments
of cavalry, and they takes great delight in them.”
“The native cavalry are tall, thin-legged men” (“Pan-
jabbers,” I think he called them). “They wear many-
coloured turbans; and, my word! they ran ride, too,
and they are all right at the drill,” said Veteran No. 2.
“Rajahs are native princes, who work under the
British. They have a Government Resident to keep
’em straight, you know,” he said, in answer to an en-
quiring look from a Bushman.
“I know,” said the Australian. “ ‘Ranji Singhi'
was a Rajah ; but I guess he’s a good deal more pleased
to play big cricket than to strut about with baggy
trousers and a big turban, and ’is chest covered with
jewels.”
“I likes the ‘camelry’ better than the cavalry,”
chipped in Indian Veteran No. 3. “They lists for three
years. (Three weeks would feed me up.) I once rode
a camel for twenty minutes, and every bone in my body
ached for a week. The camelmen carry a lance, a
sword, and a carbine,” continued the soldier, “and they
can march longer distances and faster than the cavalry.
And they can go when they charge. I once saw them
at work in the Tirah. They got into a valley among
the hillmen, and they rode through ’em backwards and
forwards three or four times. I saw some of them stick
two ‘Afghans’ (or whatever they were) at once with theii
lances. It was better’n pig-sticking,” said the blood


thirsty warrior, whose heart was, no doubt, more tender
than his yarns.
“But give me the elephants before either the camels
or the horses,” said No. 2. (They were running against
each other now in their yarns.) “My only fault with
an elephant is that he knows too much. Taint quite
right for an animal, not human, to know so much —
leastways, according to my way of thinking,” continued
the yarn-spinner.
“If you don’t give an elephant ’es proper ration of
forage, e won’t touch it. I orfen tried the Battery
elephants. They used to lift the bundle up with their
trunks, and if it was short weight it could stay there till
it growed ’eavier.
“And what a quantity they do eat. An elephant
eats a bundle of forage as big as hisself every day. When
they work, you only have to get them to understand
at the start, then they work away piling up logs or steel
rails in proper order, or even laying railway sleepers.
“They are great for transport, doing away with a
whole troop of horses and scores of oxen.
“Two of ’em will walk away with a big Howitzer.
The oxen draw the ammunition waggons. But, blow
me ! they’ll take a gun into action, but they won t bring
it out again. And you can never get them closer than
one thousand yards to the firing-line.
“When they’re got as near as is ’ealthy, they’ll stoj.
and wave their trunks about in the air and trumpet like
the Judgment Day. They will go back, but no forrader,
and if you want to get guns closer or bring them out
you’ve got to put in the bullocks —it’s all the same to
them where they go. And, my word! the elephant


understands punishment. Every one of the army ele-
phants has he’s defaulter’s sheet just like one of us.”
Here a Bushie tipped me a knowing and unbelieving-
wink, and shook his leg in an expressive way, as much
as to say, “He thinks he can pull my leg.”
But the narrator, turning to his Indian comrades
as if for confirmation of his story, continued :
“When an elephant is charged with a crime, he’s
marched up before is orficer by other two elephants, and
he’s tried, and the sentence is entered up. If he is
condemned to (say) twenty-five lashes, another elephant
gives him his number with .a chain.
“ Every time the mahout waves ’is hand the
elephant swings ’is trunk round and brings down the
chain with a whack, till the number is up. Sometimes
they puts an elephant on fatigue. There was one at
Quo; a ad to walk up and down a new road and pad
it for our hours a day for a month. If an elephant’s
default* ’s sheet is pretty full, and he gives a lot of
trouble, nd perhaps finishes up by killing a nigger or
smashing up a gun-carriage, they tries him and con-
demns him to be shot, ‘as a goad example to the others .’ ”
And now, having grown quite impervious to the
leg -makings and winks of the unbelievers, another Indian
warrior takes up the parable, and, with a laugh which
ought to have come at the end of his contribution instead
of at the beginning, he says, “Ain’t they feared of a
mouse? Though they’re the biggest animals, and they
will face lions and tigers, they’re as frightened of a mouse
as a woman. If a mouse gets among the forage, up
goes every elephant’s trunk in the stable—straight up,


as if asking the man in the moon to come down and
kill that mouse.”
“What are they afraid of a mouse for?” said I.
“They seems to think, sir, that it might run up
their trunks. And mosquitoes are the things that bother
them in spite of their thick hides. If there is water
about, they draw up a trunkful and squirt the mosquitoes
away; if there is no water, they blow a cloud of dust
at them.
“But what I like best of all is to see the elephants
at a review—in the march-past. Every elephant in
line, marching in step, and when they come to the salut-
ing point the mahout driving between the ears of the end
elephant gives the word, and up goes every trunk together
to the salute, as well as any ‘soger 1 ’ could do it with
sword or rifle.”
“And do they finish up by singing ‘God Save the
Queen? said a sarcastic volunteer who knew nothing
of India and its wonders. Him they regarded with
silent contempt, whilst a Bushman turned to me and
said, “What do you think of the yarn?”
“Well,” I had to confess, “I have heard something
like it before, and I think it is true.”
“Well, chums,” said the Australian, looking in a
hard, mesmerising way at the three Indian novelists, “I
wouldn’t believe you if I didn't see you all sitting there.”
What convincing power the presence and attitude
of the three Indian veterans conveyed I have not been
able to determine.


PIENAAR RIVER CHRISTMAS CARNIVAL.
The surroundings and general aspect of things
scarcely augured well for the usual Merry Christmas.
It seemed almost an irony to wish one's comrade the
usual merry greeting. But we decided to make the
most of things, and, accordingly, a well-assorted pro-
gramme was drawn up, everything going off satisfac-
torily.
The first item on the list was—•
1. Wrestling on Barebacked Mules, for which three
teams of four were entered, viz., Munster Fusiliers,
Wilts, and the Royal Artillery. After a well-fought
and exciting contest, the “fight” was won by the Royal
Artillery team.
2. The V.C. Race, for all comers, was a splendid
piece of sport. Among the entries were men from the
Royal Artillery, R.M. Fusiliers, A.S.C., and the N.S.W.
Bushmen. The first three places fell to the last-named
regiment, in the following order, viz., M. Smith 1, E.
Duffy 2, A. Fryer 3.
3. The Bottle Lloyd Lindsay Race, open to all,
was both exciting and amusing. The jumping was, on
the whole, excellent, while the slaughter of empty bottles
was most terrific. The winning team was that of H.
Hudson, T. Gordon, C. Manser, and A. McColl, of the
N.S.W. Bushmen.
4. Open Footrace, 100 yards, for all regiments, but
limited to Australians ; two entries—M.Fs. 7, other corps
2. The heats were very well run, the final falling an
easy win for E. Duff, N.S.W. Bushmen.


5. Hop, Step and Jump. This event was won by
Pte. Prendergast, of the Royal Artillery.
6. (Last, but not least, so far as fun is concerned.)
The Mule Race, barebacked. Mules are ver}' little
trouble at the starting post —at least, for the starter.
They will stand like statues until the word “Go"; some
of them until long after. The next trouble is to keep
them somewhere near the course, as they have a cat-like
instinct for finding their way home to their respective
feeders, the jockey in many instances only playing second
fiddle. After a lot of coaxing, hard riding, and much
wear and tear of sjambok, Trooper R. Levett, N.5.W.8.,
brought his mount home an easy winner by about three
mule lengths. This race, although not run in Melbourne
Cup time, was most enjoyable throughout, and brought
to a successful close a very enjoyable afternoon.
As for music, there was an abundance. The Wilt-
shire Brass Band, and also the M.F. Drum and Fife Band,
with their inspiriting strains kept things from going flat
between events.
The attendance was exceptionally large, there being
also a large sprinkling of the fair sex (if the Kaffir women
from the kraals near camp can be included in that
phrase), some of them being attired in original and most
fanciful costumes. Not being a connoisseur on those
things, I cannot describe the various “turn-outs like the
Sydney Mail does; and, besides, don’t know their names.
There was only one side-show on the ground, this
being a song-and-dance by big, black, burly, bootless
Basutos. Their very African get-up could hardly be


called picturesque; and as for their music and dancing,
a little of it—like an Australian volunteer—goes a lon^
way -
W.M.H.
CRICKET.
FIRST N.S.W. BUSHMEN v. MUNSTER FUSILIERS.
A pleasant diversion from the dull routine of garri-
son life took place at Pienaar’s River Station on the 23rd
inst., when scratch teams representing the Bushmen
and the Munster Fusilier Reserves met in friendly com-
petition, and during a closely-contested game, which lasted
some hours, war and its attendant dangers were for the
once forgotten in the excitement and fraternal rivalry of
cricket.
The present writer doesn't know whether the con-
trast between the recreation of the peaceful game we were
playing and the grim realities of warfare struck others
as forcibly or so pleasurably as it did him, but he can
affirm that the novelty of the situation—a veritable pa c
in hello —gave an additional zest to the contest, which
also recalled similar scenes in far-off lands, with the
difference that the surroundings were happily more in
keeping with the tranquil nature of our pursuits.
Anyhow, it may safely be hazarded that the occasion
gave rise to many heartfelt wishes that, like pacific con-
ditions, might shortly supersede the lamentable struggle
in which we as a nation are engaged, and that the British
Lion should aoon fraternise with the lamb—or, rather,


Boer, to localise the phrase. En passant , it has been
suggested, presumptively by the Boers themselves, that
we should meet them at Vaalbosch Fontein with no
more dangerous weapons than a cricket ball and bat. May
this prove a favourable omen for the future.
In our match with the Munsters, Lieutenant Hallett
skippered the Bushmen, and Brice performed a similar
office for our opponents. On tossing, the Bushmen took
the wickets, and a rattling good game ensued, keen in-
terest being evinced in the result by both players and
spectators. Lieutenant Hallett, by careful cricket, com-
piled top score (26) for his side, while Hickey, King, and
Tyrrell did the bulk of the bowling, the two former,
though clearly out of practice, giving promise of con-
siderable ability. McCarthy carried off the honour of
top-notch (29) for the Munsters, and their innings closed
with a total of 58 runs to the Bushmen’s 52, Thomas
Atkins thus proving victorious over the Bushmen, with
six runs to spare. Appended are the respective scores ;

CHAPTER XXII.
AFTER DE WET.
The historian of the Boer war will, I should think,
find his chief difficulty in describing the chase after De
Wet. It was very difficult to understand at the time.
The order was usually this: De Wet having been located
by the Intelligence Department, a special column, lightly
equipped and under a good leader, was put on his track.
For some weeks glowing reports would be made of the
progress of the chase. In spite of expenditure of horse-
flesh, difficulties of weather, etc., the flying Dutchman
“could not shake his pursuers off.” Daily the tired
burghers of De Wet’s commando were captured. More-
over, we would be informed other British columns were
in good strategic positions. If De Wet trekked east —
why, Colonel “A.” would get him; if he went west,
General “B.” was there.
Then the crisis of the pursuit would be reported.
The columns were closing on him; we were fighting his
rearguard; we had him in “the hollow of our hand ;
we had captured some of his guns; and then, just when
our- excitement was high, it was as though we were “rung
off” at the telephone in the midst of an absorbing con-
versation. But we would persist; we would inquire;
and slowly the story of De Wet’s escape would leak out,
as though it was a most unimportant matter. Some-
times he got away in his Cape-cart; at other times he


had to ride for it. Once he managed barely to get away
in his clothes; indeed, he had, we were told, to leave
some of them behind. On another occasion he was lucky
that he managed to save his skin.
Just as there were people in England who were quite
certain that they could catch the Kelly gang of bush-
rangers for the Australians, so there were quite a lot of
people in Australia who seemed certain that all that was
necessary was to “let the Australians have a show.’’
Well, they got a show. Early in 1900, Plumer,
with a column made up of Australians and New Zea-
landers, was on the chase, and drove De Wet northwards
as he had never been driven before. For weeks they hung
upon his trail, and then they began daily to pick up his
horses and men. The horses were often all blood on
one side, where they had been spurred, and weals the
other side, where they had been whipped. The Boers
had not spurs enough to go all round, so each man had
one. The prisoners were sometimes got lying by the
road asleep. They were either indifferent as to their
fate, or they were glad at being taken. An officer writ


ing to us at Pienaar's River said that Plumer fought two
actions with De Weti.
On the first occasion, the Boers fighting a. rearguard
action held Plumer back for eight hours, whilst the Dutch
convoy got away. On the second occasion De Wet’s
force had been considerably depleted by our captures.
Plumer’s advance guard at midday had had De Wet’s
commando in sight for hours. Reluctantly, Plumer
halted his force for the midday meal. It was wet wea-
ther; the animals were about done; and this course
seemed necessary. When the time came to start once
more, the storm was terrific. The tremendous rains had
flooded the roads, and the guns and transport were up
to the axles in slush, and at last had to stop. The
mounted men pushed on, and by-and-bye came right into
De Wet’s convoy. The Boer leader had, of course, the
same difficulty as our force. PTis convoy was hopelessly
weatherbound, and resistance was almost useless.
Plumer got every one of his guns, and nearly all his
transport, together with two hundred prisoners; but De
Wet—where was he? Off —to find another commando
and a weak British position to attack. It seems curious
that we should make a hero of a man who was always
on the run, and who lost his commandos one by one,
until at last the Boers themselves used to trek away
from De Wet as hard as they trekked from a stronger
British column. They knew that wherever De Wet was
the British would pursue, and ultimately capture the
major part of his command. No British column leader
would get promotion for losing one column after another,
or become famous for persistently refusing to give battle


to his pursuer. It should be noted that the difference
between the strength of the columns following De Wet
was not usually disproportionate. To successfully follow
him, it was necessary to have a force very similar to his
own. Whilst our comrades were following De Wet,
some memorable events occurred with us. There was
the news of the death of the Queen. On January 22nd
the news was posted up in camp that the Queen’s illness
was dangerous. That night, when the drums and fifes
of the Munster Fusiliers played the National Anthem
at the “tattoo,” there seemed to be a new reverence in
all as they stood to attention all over the camp. The
news of the Queen’s death, the next day, brought to us
a sense of personal loss. On the Sunday following,
January 27th, we had a memorial service at church parade,
attended by all the troops.
At the conclusion, instead of “God Save the Queen,”
the pipers of the 2nd battalion Gordon Highlanders
played the national lament, “The Flowers of the Forest.”
It was at this period that the detailed news of a
nasty little affair which occurred to our A Squadron
before they went south to help chase De Wet filtered
through to us.
They, with others, were escorting a convoy from
Bronkhorst Spruit railway station to the camp at Rhe-
noster Kop, where our forces were camped on the hilly
positions from which General Paget had driven the Boers.
The detachment guarding the convoy was about forty
strong, together with some convalescents returning from
the hospital, who were riding on the waggons, and were
unarmed. The convoy was a valuable one, and carried


£lOOO, besides a lot of stores. They were attacked by
four hundred Boers,of Viljoen’s commando. Our men,
under Captain Thomas, took up a position at some dis-
tance from the convoy and fought for four hours. They
were not half beaten when they observed that someone
had put up the white flag at the waggons, and
the Boers, riding in, had got between our men and
the convoy. Treachery on the part of the Dutch con-
ductor (who disappeared with the Boers) was suspected.
It is certain that, somehow or other, the Boers had been
told of the money, for when they took possession of the
convoy their commandant immediately said, “Var is do
money ?” and on learning which waggon contained it he
immediately put a guard upon it. Two of the regulars
of the West Riding Regiment were killed in the firing
line, and also one of our men, “Finnegan.”
Logan, another of ours, was so badly wounded that
he died the next day in the hospital at Pretoria.
Sergeant-Major Weir and Trooper Davenport, of the
First Australian Bushmen, were both wounded.
This affair was particularly unfortunate, as a large
patrol under the command of Lieutenant Mullens was
on its way to meet the convoy, and, if the escort had held
out a little longer, would have relieved them.
Meanwhile, the composite regiment of Australian
Bushmen were having a warm period of service with
Methuen's column.
Rev. J. Boardman, the chaplain, writing to Pienaar’s
River on February 23rd, 1901, said: —“We have had a
lot of fighting lately. Last Monday, at Hartebeeste-
fontein, we had fifty casualties, eight officers and forty


two men; fifteen men were killed, and one officer died
of his wounds. It was a great victory, though expensive.
We had. about two thousand Boers against us, and they
were well posted in stony kopjes. We got about sixty
prisoners and killed about forty Boers.’' It appears
on this occasion that our men were attacked at night,
and had to strike their tents quickly and form a firing-
line in the darkness.


CHAPTER XXIII.
PLUMER’S NORTHERN ADVANCE.
There had been many rumours about the northern
advance, which was to be made from Pienaar’s River,
and now preparations began. Great stores of food and
forage were prepared, and rolling stock was accumulated.
At last, our anxiety as to whether we were to accompany
the columns northward was relieved. Plumer, who had
with him our comrades who had under his command
chased De Wet, was going in charge of the movement,
and he was to take us, too, thus practically taking the
whole of the First Australian Bushmen’s Regiment, which
had been separated so long.
We were very pleased, who, in football phrase, had
been “playing back” long enough, and now wanted to
end our South African service among the “forwards.”
We were placed under the command of Major
Thomas, with Captain Eckford as adjutant.
The Second and Third Regiments of Australian Bush-
men were included in Plumer’s force, so that, with the
exception of D Squadron of the Ist A.B. Reg., the whole
of the First Australian Bushmen’s Contingent were with
Plumer.
Pienaar’s River was now transformed into a great
scene of industry. First came a corps of Royal Engineers,
and repaired the line under the escort of thirty of our
Bushmen. At the station, in fifteen hours they laid down
an excellent siding to accommodate the extra trains. The


construction train, under the command of Captain Fuller,
was armoured in the centre, and garrisoned by a company
of the Gordon Highlanders, under Captain Carnegie. The
precaution was taken of pushing empty waggons in front,
in case of explosions on the line, and the rear was loaded
up with railway material. Then came five supply trains,
all more or less garrisoned. The construction train
worked its way further and further towards Warmbad,
preceded on March 29 by a screen of Bushmen under
Lieutenant Hallett, and on March 30 by a similar force
under Lieutenant Gell.
On March 30. at 3 p m., the whole column was ready
to trek, Plumer’s force was divided into two brigades
of six hundred mounted Australians, under Colonels
Jeffrey and Colvin. We were attached to Jeffrey’s bri-
gade, and precisely at the time ordered each unit filed
past the Brigadier’s flag amid the drizzling rain. The
trains had moved out. The guns of the 18th Battery
were carried on the train as far as Warmbad, the drivers
leading their horses in the rear of the column, but each
brigade was accompanied by one pom-pom—a weapon
which General Plumer believes in as an instrument for
clearing kopjes. The Queensland Imperial Bushmen
were the advance guard, and we were the supports. After
camping for tea and watering and feeding all animals at
Valboschfontein, we inspanned again for the march in
the darkness over the spongy ground. We were now in
country where we might expect the fire of Mausers to
break out at any time, and great care was taken. The
advance guard moved in a widely extended fan-shaped
formation, and the supports proceeded in squadron lines
well extended. The pom-pom was brought up to the
supports, and frequently the column was halted to allow


the scouts to reconnoitre; but we reached camp at lasts
and lay down on the wet, marshy ground at the foot of
the Waterberg Ranges within five or six miles of Warm-
bad. No fires were allowed, and noise was not permitted,
and after a brief sleep the camp was awake again at 5
a.m., and soon we were moving towards the forbidding
hops and kopjes of the Waterberg Mountains.
“Would the enemy fight or run?”
We were only a small fighting force of six hundred
mounted men. with two pom-poms, and they had splendid
natural fortifications and Zulu schantzes ready made, for
the natives fought here in bygone days.
“Would it be necessary to detrain our six 121 b. guns?”
That a few hundred Boers could keep us at bay here
for hours we well knew, but it was so long since they
had made a stand ! Soon our queries were answered.
The advance guard cantered from cover to cover over
the rising ground, followed by the New South Wales sup-
ports, only to find the baths and the hotel at the foot
of the hills deserted. The construction train drew up
to the railway station. The telegraphists and engineers
were at work repairing the lines and wires, just as it
might be in George-street, Sydney. A few aimed pri-
soners were taken by the scouts; a few unarmed Boers
gave themselves up. The guns were still on the train ;
not a shot had yet been heard. But there were still
the huge hills to face.
As soon as the mounted men reached the first ridge
of the hills, a hot sniping fire broke out, and was continued
for two hours from the opposite ridge. None of our
men were hit; by this time they had learned to take
cover. Away in the distance one hundred waggons were


counted trekking away, and the snipers had been left to
cover their retreat. But two of the waggons lagged
behind, and, getting into suitable cover, the advance
guard sx>on compelled the Boers to leave them. Then
our men burnt the waggons and drove the oxen into our
lines. Besides these, a great many other oxen were
rounded up, and we had only suffered to the extent of
having two horses shot.
But there was still the great pinnacle of Buis Kop
towering above us. It had to be tackled after lunch.
Soon the long column was winding its way out of the
little town towards this mountain, and now the same
sniping fire broke out. In the valley we could see the
Boer laager still standing, and a few empty waggons.
This time the fire was more disastrous to the Boers. The
3rd Regiment, under Major Vialls, of Western Australia,
was in the fmnt here. We could see them climbing rock
to rock and directing their fire upon the enemy below.
One Boer was killed, and our doctor went out to attend
another who was badly wounded. Now we went into
camp for the night, after a long and a hard day’s work for
both men and horses, but, happily, without any loss of
life on our side. The next morning, Sunday, April 1,
patrols went out in various directions. One patrol went
for the enemy’s laager, and found it empty. Everything,
including a large quantity of ammunition, was burnt.
There was plenty of evidence to show into what straits
the enemy had been brought. They had been tanning
leather and making rough veldtschonen to wear, and there
were no signs of abundance of food. Boer families giving
themselves up were sent by train to Pretoria straight
away, and during Saturday afternoon and Sunday morn


ing the guns and a large quantity of stores were de-
trained.
From the account given by prisoners it was possible
to represent the Boer story of the occupation of the first
post in the Waterberg. The Kaffirs had told them of
the immense preparations being made at Pienaar's River,
and they had expected our advance, and were, therefore,
not quite unprepared to quit. But we came much earlier
than they expected, so we found the railway intact and
free from mines, although there were some gaps to fill in.
At daybreak on Saturday morning their patrol saw the
moving mass of khaki advancing, and galloped back to
the laager with the news. Quickly the oxen were in-
spanned, all that was valuable was taken from the hotel
and railway station, and the Boer commando, under Com-
mandant Hans Mai an, trekked, leaving the wives and
children of the brave burghers to be cared for by the
British, whom they are so fond of representing as brutal
and cruel. Thus the occupation of Warmbad was com-
pleted on the anniversary of the arrival of the transport
Maplemore with the Bushmen in Table Bay.


CHAPTER XXIV.
FROM WARMBAD TO PIETERSBURG.
As we moved northwards the 2nd Battalion of the
Gordon Highlanders followed to garrison the places which
the mounted men occupied. Part of the battalion came
by trains, which they guarded; others guarded the ox
convoy following on with supplies. Leaving Warmbad
thus held by infantry, we marched out of camp on Mon-
day, April 2. We expected to be reinforced by the new
Victorian contingent before leaving Warmbad, but the
veterinary department condemned a great proportion of
their horses, which had come straight from the ship, and
they were not able to join the column. However, the
Bushveldt Carbineers, a small body composed almost en-
tirely of English refugees from the Pietersburg distreit,
arrived to scout for the armoured construction train.
We were now accompanied by the whole of the 18th
Battery, four guns usually going with the first brigade
and two with the second brigade. The brigades took the
front place alternately, and the different units acted as
advance guard in their turn, except the New Zealanders,
who were new-chums, having just arrived. They were
beginning to get their shax-e of the responsibility now,
however. It was easily seen that they were new hands.
Their officers put them through all sorts of unnecessary
drill, much to the amusement of others who fox-got that
they used to do just the same thing. Then the men
asked such strange questions, and they were so keen for


fighting. The edge of their enthusiasm has not been
worn down yet by constant trekking in all weathers.
The convoy travelled in the rear, different units being
told off from time to time as baggage guard, and following
on these was the supply column. We reached Nylstroom
without any incident on April 3. We were the advance
guard on that day. A guard was sent over the Landrost’s
office, and many rifles were soon given up or collected.
Most of these were at once destroyed. After we had
been in the town some sniping shots were fired at some of
the troopers from a kopje. The Queenslanders went up
to find the enemy, and, locating the spot from which a
solitary marksman had been firing, they poured a volley
into it, and an old burgher got up and lifted his hands
in token of surrender. He had made his protest at our
entry, but he did not wish to go so far as lose his own life,
and he was just in time to save it.
Nylstroom is a very interesting and pretty place,
with a beautiful Dutch Reformed Church. When the
Boers reached this district they thought that they had
reached the Nile, because the river flows almost due
north. Hence they called it Nylstroom (Nile stream).
The river, however, flows into the Limpopo, which divides
the Transvaal from Matabeleland. Nearly all the people
were sent away from this place to Pretoria, and some
important prisoners were taken, including Commandant
Lombard and his son. It seemed very hai’d on the people
of Nylstroom to have to leave their homes, particularly
as most of them were anti-Krugerites. During the Bloem-
fontein conference a petition was got up in this place
asking President Kruger to grant the franchise to the
Uitlanders, and one of the leading spirits in the peti


tioning body narrowly escaped being put into prison by
the Boer Government. After “8.P.” left the place last
September, the Boers came in and fined many of the lead-
ing residents large sums for alleged treason. The Land-
drost paid a fine of £lOOO, and others sums from £lOO
upwards. This was a favourite means of filling the war-
chest at the expense of old opponents of Kruger. At
Nylstroom the innocent have had to suffer for the guilty,
both at our hands and the hands of the Boers; but we
have found that it costs too much human life to protect
people in distant towns.
The next day, April 4, we were ordered to proceed
five miles along the railway line to occupy a kopje which
overlooked an important railway bridge. We had
reveille, at 4 a.m., and moved at daybreak. At the kopje,
which we held, a few prisoners were taken. Three aimed
Boers gave themselves up to one of our outposts. Two
of them were riding donkeys, and one only had a horse;
indeed, many of the Boers whom we have seen on this
trek have been dismounted, and a Boer is no good without
his horse. We had torrents of rain at this camp, and
everybody was drenched to the skin. After staying here
one miserable night, the whole column moved on to Piet
Potgieter’s Rust, the next station on the Pietersburg line.
We reached this place at midday, and captured a waggon-
load of ammunition. About one hundred and fifty Boers
cleared out at our approach, and as the mounted men
could not reach them, and three miles out of town we
found the scrub so thick and the neks between the moun-
tains so narrow, it was judged wisest to return and camp
in town for the day. At this place twenty-seven pri-
soners were taken, and most of the people were sent into


refugee laagers in the Pretoria district. During our next
advance an unsuccessful attempt was made to blow up our
construction train here, but only the space between two
sleepers was dislodged, which was soon repaired. Mean-
while, Colvin’s brigade moved out six miles to a nek which
was commanded by a hill called Aister Kop (lion Head).
Here our troops had a sharp' engagement, but eventually
succeeded in dispersing the enemy, who, however, killed
six of our horses and wounded two troopers, one through
the lungs and the other through the foot. The enemy
also took two New Zealanders prisoners at this place.
The following morning the remainder of the column
resumed the march, and we had lunch at the scene of
the fight, under the brow of Aister Kop. Once more we
had heavy rain, and got wet through. By this time many
of our horses had developed horse sickness, and not a few
had to be destroyed. A good number of men were also
in the ambulance with malaria, which is a very common
thing in the Waterberg Range. From this place the
column moved on without attack, although parties of
Boers were often seen in the distance. We camped
within ten miles of Pietersburg on Easter Sunday. It
was a dirty, wet camp, and it rained hard. Not far from
our camp the Boers had blown up a great quantity of
ammunition. When we saw and heard the explosion
in the morning we thought it might be the railway ,
but though the railway was intact at this point, two
attempts had been made further back to blow up our
construction train. These attempts only partially suc-
ceeded.
Some of the empty trucks and a Red Cross car —
which, fortunately, was also empty —were shattered, and


a second attempt destroyed paid of the front of the loco-
motive ; but the Royal Engineers proved equal to all
that was required in the matter of repairs, and the
Bushveldt Carbineers dashing out discovered the convoy
of the train-wreckers. This they successfully attacked,
and took waggons, oxen and a good number of prisoners.
And so the railway was now ours from Pretoria to Pie-
tersburg. Trains were going to and fro, taking down
prisoners and refugees and bringing up stores. Tele-
graph communication was complete, and railway staff
officers officiated at each place; and back at Potgieter’s
Rust, General Clements, who was in command of the
line of communication, had a large body of infantry.
General French, who was conducting large operations
on the eastern line with a view to prevent Boers dispersed
by us trekking east, had successfully completed his move-
ments, having made large captures of guns, ammunition,
and prisoners. Both the eastern and northern lines
were well held, which means that the whole of the rail-
way systems of the Transvaal were now in our hands.
Plumer’s force entered and occupied Pietersburg on Easter
Monday.
After the armoured construction train passed Pot-
gieter s Rust it was partially blown up twice, and on
tho second occasion the Bushveldt Carbineers dashed out
and captured the convoy of the train-wreckers and eleven
prisoners. These prisoners were required by Captain
Fuller, R.E., who was in command of the train, to point
out where the rest of the mines were laid. Their reply
to this was the usual Dutch evasion, “Ne ferstan” (“Don’t
understand. ) But Captain Fuller thought they did


understand, and he put them on the first truck following
a couple of empty ones. Their journey must have been
o very uncomfortable one. Soon it was interrupted by
a terrific roar. A mine had exploded, and they were
all hurled out among the thorns on the side of the perma-
nent way, with nerves shaken, although they had no
broken bones. The broken trucks were now less of
protection for them, and they were willing to go ahead
and remove the mines, which, no doubt, they had helped
to lay. So much for the advance of the Engineers.
Now let us follow the operations of the mounted column.


CHAPTER XXV.
THE OCCUPATION OF THE LAST BOER CAPITAL
—PIETERSBURG.
Pictcrsburg was occupied on Monday, April 8. On
the morning of that day we moved off at 6 o'clock from
camp. After brushing aside a few snipers on the right
flank, killing two and taking another prisoner, the ad-
vanced guard swept through the town. Inside the town
one burgher fired explosive bullets at the troopers from
the window of his house. His door was barricaded, and
in the effort to get at him and stop his explosive bullets,
which were cracking in the air like fireworks, he was shot
dead. In less than four hours General Plumer, with
his staff, was in the Market-square, where the Vierkleur
was hauled down and the Union Jack run up opposite
the Landdrost’s office.
Meanwhile the advanced guard, the Imperial Bush-
men’s Contingent, followed by the New South Wales
Bushmen as supports, was making its way to the hill
on the east side of the town, in hot pursuit of some who
had delayed their departure from the town until the
last moment. It was during this action of the advanced
guard that a very sad occurrence took place, which spread
a deep gloom over the rest of the day’s proceedings.
One young Hollander, who had evidently meant to sell
his life as dearly as possible, or had been caught up by
our men too quickly and was not able to escape, lay in
the long grass with loaded rifle. Our men were extend


ing to go in pursuit of the large body of Boers, who were
about a mile away. They, of course, were quite un-
conscious of the fact that an enemy was lying in the
grass within fifty yards of them, but they heard the
near report of the rifle time after time, and soon Lieu-
tenant Walter, of the Tasmanians, lay on the ground,
shot through the heart. Then followed Trooper Frazer,
of the West Australians, shot dead also. Then with
the next shot Lieutenant Sale, of the Tasmanians, fell
mortally wounded, for he only survived two days. The
hidden sniper also shot four horses. By this time the
men had madly circled round seeking for the hidden
foe. One slight movement in the grass revealed his
hiding place, and the next moment he was riddled through
and through with at least nine bullets.
Thus, the day we entered Pietersburg closed very
sadly as we stood around the graves of Lieutenant Walter
and Trooper Frazer in the beautiful little cemetery of
the town. The avenues of blue gum trees with which
the little cemetery is surrounded, and the deep bed of
gum leaves thrown into the graves, reminded us of home.
The bugler of the regiment to which the dead soldiers
belonged—the 1.8. C the “Last Post,” and the
men fired volleys over the graves at the conclusion of
the service. Lieutenant Sale’s funeral was on April 10.
General Plumer, with his staff, attended both ceremonies.
The bodies of the officers were borne on the top of a
pom-pom; that of Trooper Frazer was carried in an
ambulance.
On both occasions the chaplains led the cortege, and
the officers following according to their rank were again


followed by the troops, all dismounted and with the rifles
reversed.
The funoral party was preceded by one company of
infantry, which opened out to allow the cortege to pass
between its ranks.
The troops were formed into a hollow square around
the graves, and, when the bodies were carried to the graves
by the men of the same regiments to which the fallen
soldiers belonged, all present saluted the dead. We had
no band, but whilst both funerals were in progress there
was the distant crackle of. burning ammunition, which
our force was destroying, and every now and again the
crash of some demolition or the explosion of some of the
big shells in the fire. Such grim accompaniment adds
to the solemn grandeur of the English Burial Service,
which is always used.
And now, the service being concluded, we returned
to our camps, leaving our comrades behind until the next
bugle-call, “for the trumpet shall sound"—and that will
be a reveille which all must obey.
On getting within range of the Boers on the eastern
hills, they decamped after firing a few shots. They left
one of their number dead on the veldt; so that the
loss on each side at the occupation of Pietersburg was
three. A good number of prisoners were taken, and
many rifles were destroyed during the first two days of
our occupation, and great numbers of cattle were brought
in. The Royal Engineers got to work at once, and three
flour mills werejolown up, as well as stores of ammunition.
As the funeral procession wended its way from the camp,
terrific explosions rent the air, and the Engineers only


stopped in their work to salute the dead as the cortege
passed.
The policy of the Commander-in-Chief in regard to
these distant towns was, first, to stop the production of
food supplies, and, second, to remove the bulk of the
population. This has been proved to be absolutely neces-
sary, for we cannot protect the women and children un-
less we use a large force, and already thousands of troops
were necessary to hold the lines of communication. Our
experience was that we lost a great number of lives
through sniping when we attempted to hold populated
towns. Moreover, it is impossible to prevent food and
information from their homes being sent out to Boers on
the veldt by the Kaffirs. Hence the destruction of the
mills, for which, in the future, compensation in many cases
will have to be paid. Nine hundred people were en-
trained and sent away from Pietersburg in a few days.
This was hard lines for many people, although it is the
least of two evils. At the same time, many were glad
to go. It led to the discovery of many hidden stores of
food. Boers who professed to have no mealies, and had
for a long time charged fancy prices to English families
for food supplies, were hawking bags of mealies about the
town at a ridiculously low price, and were unable to sell.
There was still work to be done, for, although con-
siderable quantities of warlike stores and ammunition
(including a seven-pounder Krupp gun) were found in the
magazine and in various buildings in the town, the Boers
were understood to have in this district two “Long Tom”
guns, one of which they have named “The Lady Roberta.”
For three days the warlike stores were carted out to the
veldt, and at twilight each night we were treated to aii


tho sound and fury of a great battle, as well as quite a
pyrotechnic display, as the shells and cartridges exploded
in a great fire which was lighted. On April 10 Colvin’s
brigade went out twelve miles, but only succeeded in ex-
changing fire with a body of the enemy, one of whom they
wounded. On the 11th the Intelligence Department had
more correct information concerning the enemy’s guns
and convoy, and Jeffrey’s brigade, which includes our
men, went out in pursuit. They stayed out a day and a
night, but never caught the enemy, though they found
the tracks of the guns and waggons. They occupied the
little town of Smitsdorp in dashing style, only to find it
completely empty, and got into camp on April 13 at noon,
hungry, tired, and disappointed. Good news, however,
awaited the Australians in camp. Lord Kitchener had
sent a message to say that all the men of the third con-
tingents were to return home from Pietersburg, as their
reliefs had arrived.
What cheering there was at this announcement!
The new contingent of Imperial Queensland Bush-
men arrived to fill up the gap in Plumer’s column. How
nice they looked in their new uniforms and improved
equipment. How our men smiled to see their tents and
heel ropes—these and many other things they carry would
soon be a minus quantity. What was more amusing to
us was the indignation of the new men at having to travel
part of their journey to the front in coal trucks. General
Plumer addressed our men and bade them farewell on
April 14. He reminded us that we had been under
his command nearly the whole time of our campaign, and
although we had not been in any of the great battles, such


as Paardeberg and the fights in Natal, still we could go
home with the consciousness that we had done a lot of
hard and dangerous work. We had had the honoui of
taking the first town in the Transvaal (Zeerust) and the
last (Pietersburg), and we had contributed our share to
the South African war with credit and distinction. With
this and many other complimentary things he bade us
good-bye and God-speed, and then more cheers. Every
camp fire was a concert platform that night.
The northern advance was the most successful move-
ment ever participated in by the Australians. Great
results were obtained at comparatively little cost.
Railway material and property, as well as rifles and
ammunition, were captured in great quantities, and we
obtained secure hold upon the northern district.
A thousand beds were got ready in the Pretoria
hospitals for the casualties which might result from the
operations of the various columns in the north and east,
and not more than fifty of them were occupied. The
advance to Pietersburg had been a marvel of organisation
and skill.
Pietersburg was no longer the capital of the Boer
Government, or what was left of it. The three newspaper
offices, which were largely used for the propagation of
Dutch lies in the form of bogus proclamations and false
news, had been blown up. The machinery of the Zout-
yansherg Wachter was first used to print the first and last
English edition of the paper, which was distributed as
a souvenir to the troops, and then it was shattered by
the explosion of guncotton. I accompanied the Engineer
officer in charge, in order to take a snapshot picture of
this explosion.


Bofoie wo left the building I noticed a rather clever
pon anxi ink sketch of Oom Paul and Reitz. The cari-
cature represents Reitz yielding to the temptations of a
good billet at Pretoria, leaving Bloemfontein behind, pre-
pared now to kick over the suzerainty and anything else
which was English. I kept the picture as a souvenir of
the occasion.

CHAPTER XXVI.
THE LAST TREK OF THE BUSHMEN.
1,200 MILES BY RAIL.
After receiving Lord Kitchener’s message stating
that, as our reliefs had arrived, we were to return home,
we shifted our camp from Plumer’s column and took up
our quarters at the racecourse near Pietersburg Railway
Station. From here the men were detailed from time
to time to escort the trains which conveyed Boer prison-
ers and refugees to Pretoria. The men were in high
spirits at the prospect of returning home, and concerts
were held every evening, to the accompaniment of a
piano owned by some Dutchmen, who, I suppose, would
be sorry to leave it on the veldt. Although the Dutch
were distinctly told the things they would be allowed
to take, they persisted in carting special articles of furni-
ture to the railway station, in the hope of bribing some
railway official to allow them transport.
When disappointed in this, they left valuable things,
such as pianos, sewing machines, and bicycles on the
veldt. This accounts for our piano, which was even
carried in the train to Worcester by the Queenslanders,
who had a continuous concert en route. Others took
their pleasures differently. All day long bare-legged
Highlanders were learning to cycle (for the most part
on ladies’ bicycles, which were tyreless), much to the
amusement of onlookers, who were waiting their turn
to get knees and elbows skinned—the usual “woes of


wheelers” in their novitiate. Sometimes a “kiltie”
would be sent spinning down the hill by his comrades,
with the certainty of a fall awaiting him at the other
end—the only doubt being as to whether he would be
precipitated into a stretch of oozy swamp or get his fall
upon the hard, stony ground. Such chances were
nothing, however, to the “Gay Gordons —the men who
took such hard knocks at Caesar’s Hill and distant
Dargai.
At last there was an opportunity for me to get
away with a party of Bushmen, who were to escort a
train to Pretoria, under the command of Lieutenant
Zouch. There were the farewells. In spite of the
prospect of home, these were not pleasant. There was
good-bye to be said to our special friends in the Gordons,
with whom wo had been campaigning so long. We had
to give up our horses, and, although there was not the
same affection as that which we felt for the horses we
first took out from Australia, and which we lost so
soon, still it is hardly possible to go through a period
of campaigning without developing some affection for
the horse which carries you.
I was very reluctant to part with my chestnut
English horse, and he seemed, by the way he whinnied
after me when I took him to Captain Carnegie, of
the Gordons, with whom I was leaving him, to have
the same reluctance. That he did not approve of the
tiansfer was shown by the fact that he took the first
opportunity of breaking away and returning to his old
quarters. I got this horse through the kindness of
Piince Francis of Teck, who was remount officer at Pre-
toi ia, when it was difficult to get a remount of any kind,


A RUSSIAN REMOUNT.
“For careful and accomplished bucking commend me to a
Russian remount.’




and the hors© carried me well for seven months. Speak-
ing of horses (which is an interesting subject to Austra-
lians) : all candid critics in South Africa admit that
the Colonial horse or a Basuto pony is by far the safest
mount. For careful and accomplished bucking commend me
to a Russian remount. The Australian horse gets used to the
country and climate quickest, and the English horse is per-
haps slowest in the process of acclimatisation. Hungarian
and Argentine horses were badly selected, and were for
the most part hard-mouthed weeds. There is not the
slightest doubt that, from the first, the Boer had the
advantage over us in that he rode the hardened native
animal, which itself is the result of the peculiar necessi-
ties of South African use. whilst we had to ride imported
horses of all sorts, which had not even been allowed to
rest after long voyages. Had the British Army authori-
ties bought up all the Colonial horses at the beginning
of the war, as they were repeatedly urged to do, the
end might sooner have been in sight —but it would not
have been so profitable to Australian horse-breeders.
At last we got away. The last farewell was said
to Chaplain-Major Murray, of the Gordons, and three
hours late the train moved out, laden with Dutch re-
fugees, some cattle, a few prisoners, and the troops.
There was a church van attached to the train,
occupied by Chaplain Hill, who cordially invited me
to share its comforts.
The church van was one of the later developments
of the campaign. As there were not enough chaplains
to minister to the numerous garrisons, the difficulty was
met by appointing chaplains to certain lengths of rail-
way line, upon which they visited the posts regularly,


conducting a church parade and communion service on
every possible occasion. The church van is attached
to a construction, troop, armoured, hospital, or supply
train, as each may happen to serve the purpose, and is
shunted off anywhere at the request of the chaplain.
On a former occasion a shell pierced through the van
in which we travelled. After that it was armoured
a good height all round with sheets of steel. Our van
was very comfortably fitted up—something after the
style of a ship’s saloon cabin, with a berth, table, and
book-shelf, and was sufficiently large to admit of a com-
munion service being held in it. The new vans, which
wore being made out of old carriages at Pretoria, were
oven better. All of them were armoured. It is not,
however, the shells of the enemy which the chaplain
fears—it is the flying shunts of his friends. After a
very busy day, during which he may have had to trot
round several camps or hospitals in hurried visits, and
conduct several services, the chaplain has retired to rest
on his narrow couch, and is perhaps dreaming of home
and the quieter spheres of peace, when suddenly the
locomotive gives a sneeze and a whistle, and stealthily
pulls the church van away from the train, from which
it has been uncoupled; then, with a gliding motion,
begins to push it down over the points on to another
lino. Faster and faster goes the engine—the chaplain
dreams that he is travelling on an avalanche —then, with
a sudden snort and another whistle, the locomotive stops
and the church van runs on alone. The chaplain
dreams now that he is in a boat which is just approach-
ing a cataract; then, with a mighty crash, the van runs


into a train or the buffers on a siding. The chaplain
is hurled out of his bed ; he strikes the armour-plated
side of his car. Now the avalanche is broken into
atoms at the bottom of a valley; the boat is a wreck
at the foot of the cataract; and the chaplain, rubbing
his bruises, is wondering whether it is sudden battle
or whether the train ran over a mine. My host, Chap-
lain Hill, had more wounds caused in this way than
ever the Boers inflicted upon him.
We were delayed a long time at Marabastad, where
a company of the Gordons and some of the Bushveldt
Carbineers were holding the fort. The last-named body
was raised specially for the Northern operations. They
were mostly refugees turned out of the Waterberg and
Zoutpansberg districts by the Boers, and already they
had done good work.
Marabastad is a large native stadt. During the
last Boer War an English garrison was with difficulty
extricated from this place, where they were threatened
by the Boer farmers. They reached Pretoria safely,
however, and became part of Colonel Bell air’s force of
1100, with which he successfully defended the town for
six months against the Dutch who besieged it.
The troops here were hard at work throwing up
trenches and erecting “scare-’ems” of thorn-bushes.
At Potgietersrust we found that acres of scrub had
been cleared by the Kaffirs, under the direction of the
local officers, and the bushes had been piled into inacces-
sible squares for the protection of the horses and stock.
All this had been done in about three weeks, and the
town, which was the headquarters of General Clements,
who had been placed in command of the line of com


munication from Pretoria to Pietersburg, was a centre
of activity. Though most of the population had been
removed, there was a big garrison, composed mainly
of “Northamptons” and “West Ridings.” This is the
most vulnerable part of the Northern Line, as the town
is in the midst of great kopjes and neks. Outposts
held the hills night and day, and heliographic communi-
cation was established from point to point, and with
the various supply convoys working their way north-
wards by road.
There was a block of trains at this station, and
we were delayed half a day before we got away. The
line is owned by an English company, and before the
war they removed parts of their locomotives, in order
to prevent the Dutch using them. The re-fitti.ng of
the engines with these parts does not appear to have
been very successful, as they were constantly going
wrong. Once some pin or nut was blown away from
a locomotive we were using, and we weye unable to
proceed until a new engine was procured. Then the
engine-drivers were over-worked, and sometimes they re-
fused to go on, and trains were delayed until they had
had a sleep. I heard one fellow loudly protesting
against his orders to move out. He said: “You don’t
give us no medals or fancy orders, and we have to take
soldiers’ risks and extra work.” He forgot to say,
however, that he was drawing fancy pay—enough, with
his overtime, to pay half a company of infantry for
the same period. On more than one occasion a des-
perate officer mounted the engine’s plates and drove the
train himself to the next station.


Of course, it is no trouble to an Engineer officer
bo do this. Wo reached Nylstroom without incident,
except frequent stops, to find that the West Ridings
had erected shot-proof barricades around the station o
the height of the roof.
These were very ingeniously constructe wi 8
of corrugated iron fastened together with wire and file
in with' earth. Nearly the whole length of the line
was already protected with ridges of thorn-bushes on
either side, dragged into position at immense a our.
Now we wended onr slow way through the Water-
berg Mountains to W'armbad, the last station on t o
hills. Here I had to change to less comfortable quar-
ters The church van was shunted on to a siding, for
Chaplain Hill had arranged for a service, and I had
to accompany our own force.
At this station there the same elaborate do
fences in progress, and an earthwork redoubt was begun
at one end of the station, opposite the lofty Buis Kop,
which the Boers have fought from twice already during
the war. On the last occasion I had witnessed the
West Australians, under Major Vialls, drive them out
of it iu a very spirited manner. The place was hel
mainly by the "Northamptons,” amongst whose officers
we found many old friends with whom we had cam-
paigned under Lord Methuen.
At a late hour we got away, and traversed the
Springbok flats to familiar Pienaar’s River, which is
now the headquarters of the West Riding Regiment.
* I had to stay here to gather up some kit in time for
the troop tram, which was to bring the balance of the


Bushmen on the following morning. I managed to
get my blankets spread on the floor of the telegraph
office, and, in spite of the clicking of the machine, I
was soon asleep. One of the newly-designed block-
houses had been at Pienaar’s River. These
buildings arc designed to hold 100 men. They are
of two stories, and have platforms at two comers for
machine guns. There are appliances on the roof for
signalling and searchlights. The block-houses are built
of stone, and elaborate arrangements are made for the
storage of food in some of them.
We were delayed a whole day at Pienaar’s River,
as the locomotive hauling the up-train had broken down
at Waterval, and another had to come out from Pretoria
to bring the train to Pienaar’s River before the single
line was clear.
Pienaar’s River had developed into a very active
place since the occupation of Pietersburg. Immense
quantities of Army stores are kept here, and railway
material is accumulating for the thorough repair of the
whole line. It was very interesting to watch the gangs
of natives unloading sleepers. Everything is done to
music. They lift the sleeper together, and as they
lift they breathe audibly in unison. Next they
march off with it, emitting a sort of rhythmic grunt to
each step, and, reaching the pile, they hoist it above
their heads, and keep it there quite a time, marking-
time with feet, and audible breaths, until their leader
gives the signal, when they drop it in its place, and
march off for another, singing, “Apcle Bantu,” “Apele


Bantu”—“lt is well with the Basutos.” They breathe,
and stamp, and sing the louder as their task approaches
completion.
At length we got away, the major part of the
N.S.W. and Queensland Bushmen in one train, and we
arrived at our old camp at Dasspoort, Pretoria, on Sun-
day afternoon.
We had been three days and a half in coming
from Pietersburg to Pretoria, a distance of 214 miles.
After two days’ stay in Pretoria, we left for the
south. I and a brother-chaplain had obtained authority
to travel by the express. We were going right on
to Capetown, and the troops travelling in a troop-train
leaving two hours later were to detrain at Worcester.
Wo got away to time at 6 a.m., and reached Elands.-
fontein for breakfast, where we met Major Antill and
a detachment of the new contingent of N.S.W. Mounted
Rifles proceeding to the front. Once more the train
sped on its way between outposts, garrison camps, and
defences of all sorts, reminding us that we were still
travelling on military railways, and were subject to the
risks of war. Often we would see patrols riding from
post to post on either side of the line, and once or
twice we saw convoys and columns in the distance. One
of the most interesting sights was the migration of
huge quantities of stock to the winter veldt. Slowly
they move, grazing as they go, and the lowing of cattle
and the bleating of sheep was incessant. These great
flocks were captured stock, and they were in charge


of military rangers, assisted by great numbers of native
drovers.
At this time of the year stock must be moved from
the Karoo to the uplands—the high veldt—for pas-
turage. Sometimes we> would see sick or wounded horses
accompanying the flocks. We arrived at Kroonstad
at 3 p.m., only to find that we were to be delayed there
fifteen hours. The night before, the Boers had derailed
a train and fired upon it. This they managed in a
very clever way. Removing the fish-plates and bolts,
they fastened the rails with wire. When the locomo-
tive came upon the line they had tampered with, the
rails spread, and the train ran right off the road. Thirty
armed Boers fired on the train when it was in this
plight; but, fortunately, there were no casualties, except
the engine-driver who was nearly scalded to death.
British patrols arrived on the scene very soon, as well
as an armoured train, and the mystery was that,
though the country was well searched, no trace could
be discovered of the enemy. The opinion was freely
held in Kroonstad that the whole affair was the work
of professedly loyal Dutch living in the town, and there
was frequent dissatisfaction expressed against General
Knox, who is in command of the district, on the ground
that he was not strict and severe enough in his adminis-
tration of the Dutch —a frequent complaint against
military men in South Africa.
Between Kroonstad and Bloemfontein we passed
the ruins of two trains blown up some time previously
by the Boers. The iron work of the under-carriage was
twisted out of shape, and of the woodwork there was only


the blackened and charred remains. At Bloemfontein
we found the only subject of passing interest was the
new order from the General Commanding the District,
making it compulsory for the occupants to have a print-
ed statement on the door of their houses detailing the
names and relations of those residing within.
The Dutch didn’t like the order, but the English
recognised that it would make it easier for the military
a.uthorities to discover who was at home and who was
out on the veldt train-wrecking.
From Bloemfontein southwards there was little of
incident. We were now permitted to travel at night.
The scenery in the Colesberg district was magnificent;
but later, to our disappointment, we passed the Hex
River Pass in the darkness of night, when anything
more than a faint outline was indistinguishable. Now
civilians were allowed to travel in the train without
special warrants—we were out of the region of martial
law; and we began better to realise that we were home-
ward bound. We arrived at Capetown on Sunday morn-
ing, after having been just six days in travelling 1040
miles. The Bushmen following in the troop-train stayed
at Worcester until May 9th, when they embarked in the
“Morayshire” for Australia. Sir W. Hely Hutchison,
Sir Alfred Milner and Lord Kitchener sent farewell
messages thanking the Bushmen for their work and Sir
W. Hely Hutchison, Governor of Cape Colony, addressed
the men from the bridge wishing them good-bye.
These messages and farewells were received with
ofbrepeated! cheers from the men.


Then as darkness settled down upon Table Mount-
ain, the transport swung out into the Bay, and the
Bushmen turned their faces homewards—homewards to
the way-back shanties and stockyards—to the glorious
freedom of the bush with its hills, valleys and plains,
clad with gum trees, in the midst of which no sniper
lurks, and where no alien bullet has ever sounded.
