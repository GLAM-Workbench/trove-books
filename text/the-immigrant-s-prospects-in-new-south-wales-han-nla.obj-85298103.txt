THE IMMIGRANT’S PROSPECTS
WIW i©WTH WALES.
Origin.
New South Wales was the name given by Captain
Cook, in 1770, to that portion of Australia discovered
by him from its fancied resemblance to South Wales.
The expedition which he commanded left England in
1768 in the ship Endeavour, having for its primary
object the observation of the transit of Yenus. The
astronomical party landed at Tahiti, then Captain
Cook proceeded on a voyage of discovery. They
first sighted New Zealand, then Capo Howe, and a
few days later Botany Bay was discovered. Captain
Cook records, “We were abreast the entrance of a
bay or harbour in which there appeared to he good
anchorage and which I called Port Jackson.” The
voyage was then continued, Moreton Bay having
been named and passed.
On leaving the eastern coast of New Holland,
Captain Cook writes : “I once more hoisted English
colours and though I had already taken possession of
several parts, I now' took possession of the whole
eastern coast in right of his Majesty, King George
the Third, by the name of New South Wales, with
all the bays, harbours, rivers, and islands situated
upon it; wo then fired three volleys of small arms,
which were answered by the same number from the
ship. Having performed this ceremony upon the
island we call it Possession Island.”
The English Government first decided on making
Botany Bay a penal settlement on the closing of the
American Colonies as a place of transportation for
felons. In 1786, nine vessels were engaged for
transporting both male and female convicts, and in
1787 three store ships and six transports left England
for Botany Bay. The number of convicts numbered
757.
In May 1788, the now settlement numbered 1,030
individuals; and the entire live stock of the colony,
public and private, consisted of 2 bulls, 3 cows, 1
horse, 3 mares, 3 colts, 29 sheep, 19 goats, 74 pigs,
5 rabbits, 18 turkeys, 29 geese, 35 ducks, and 210
fowls.
The natives at first gave considerable trouble,
murders were often numerous, instigated by the
outrages committed by the convicts.
Captain Philips became the first Governor of the
embryo settlement, which had many difficulties to
contend with —scarceness of provisions being the
greatest. In November 1789, the first harvest was
gathered in at Rose Hill being 200 bushels of wheat,
thirty-five bushels of barley, and small quantities of
oats and corn. Things began to look a little
brighter, fresh number of convicts arrived from
time to time, and the small settlement began to
increase into one of increasing importance, and with
its growth, grew also the order of prosperity and all
the conditions of civilized life.
Under the Governorship of Major-General Mac-
quarie, (who took office in 1810, and whose regime
was a period of 12 years), the progress of the colony
was of a steady and permanent character.
In July, 1793, the Rev. Mr. Johnson began the
erection of a church under his own inspection, “at
the back of the huts on the east side of the cove.’
The edifice was constructed of strong posts, wattle
and plaster, and thatched, and its cost was computed
at £4O. It was opened on August 25th, 1793, and
was burned down on October Ist, 1799. In March,
1794, an assistant chaplain arrived by the William
to divide religious duties with Mr. Johnson. In
1797 the first school building was erected. The first
brick church built in Sydney (St. Phillip’s) was con-
secrated on Christmas Hay, 1810. On March sth,
1803, the first newspaper was printed in Sydney,
under the title of the Sydney Gazette and New South
Wales Advertiser. It was of four pages, foolscap
size, and was published, edited, and owned by Mr.
George Howe, a West Indian creole, who had been
a compositor in the office of the London Times. For
twenty years it was a mere channel for giving
publicity to Government documents ; and it was
not until 1823 that political discussion was permitted
in its columns. It was first issued on Saturday,
afterwards on Sundays, and appeared regularly till
the year 1843. Long prior to this, in November,
1795, a small printing-press was used for the pur-
pose of printing the orders of the Governor. The
drama appears to have had its first beginning in
January, 1796, when some of the convicts obtained
permission to “ prepare a play-house,” which was
opened on the 16th with the play of ‘ 1 The Revenge.”
The first meeting for Roman Catholic worship was
held on May 15th, 1803. The first Independent
Minister, Mr. Cover, arrived in 1798. The first
settled pastor, the Rev. Mr. Tarrett, arrived in 1834.
The first Wesleyan Minister, Mr. Samuel Leigh,
arrived in the Colony on August 15th, 1815. The
pioneer of Presbyterianism, the late Hr. Lang,
arrived in the year 1823.


During the Governorship of Sir George Gipps a
despatch was received from the Imperial Govern-
ment, enclosing the Constitution Act, 5 & 6 Yict.
cap. 76, hy virtue of which a Legislative Council
was constituted, partly elective, partly non-elective ;
electoral districts were constituted, and a tolerably
liberal measure of self-government was conceded to
the colony. A few months after the arrival of Sir
Charles Fitzroy a despatch was received from Mr.
Gladstone, then Secretary of State for the Colonies,
notifying to the Legislative Council the wish that
the renewal of the system of transportation should
he favourably considered. This despatch threw the
colonists into a state of the greatest excitement;
and on the 11th June, 1849 (the ship Hashemy having-
arrived at Port Jackson on the Bth, with 212 male
convicts on board), a great public meeting was held
on the Circular Quay to indignantly protest against
their landing, and after a severe struggle with the
Governor and the Home Authorities the regulation
allowing transport ships to land their convict cargoes
in New South Wales was rescinded.
The inauguration and endowment of the Univer-
sity of Sydney, with its affiliated colleges and gram-
mar school, the turning the first sod of the Great
Southern Railway, the laying the first stone of the
Fitzroy' Dry Dock, (Cockatoo Island), and the
establishment of the Sydney branch of the Royal
Mint, all took place during the administration of
Sir Charles Fitzroy, (Angust 3, 1846, to January
17, 1855) ; but the greatest event of his reign was
the passing of the Constitution Act of New South
Wales, by which the great political principles of
responsible government were conceded to the colon-
ists. Just prior to the division of the colony, the
material advancement made, may be gathered from
the following returns : there were in the colony
13,059,324 sheep, 1,738,965 horned cattle, 132,437
horses, and 61,631 pigs ; the number of acres of land
under cultivation amounted to 198,056, inclusive of
nearly 1,000 acres of vineyards; the imports had
grown to £2,078,338, and the exports to £2,399,680;
the annual revenue was estimated at £575,794 ; the
manufacturing interests, too, had been greatly deve-
loped ; cloth factories had been erected, also distil-
leries, breweries, sugar refineries, soap works, tan-
neries, factories of different kinds, foundries, steam
and other mills. The interests of education served
by 659 schools, attended by 28,604 scholars. In
1851 the census returns gave the population at
187,243 souls.
Character of Laud.
The physical aspect of the country is very marked,
it is diversified with alternate hills, valleys and
plains. From North to South through its entire
length stretches a mountain range running almost
parallel with the coast at distances varying from 25
to 120 miles. The range is known as the Blue
mountains.
The surface of New South Wales may be divided
into three parts. The coast district, the table lands,
and the plains of the interior.
The Coast district is a comparatively narrow strip
of undulating land lying along the sea-coast, often
not more than 35 miles wide, and sometimes less,
while in other parts it widens out to an expanse of
120 miles, 60 or 70 miles being its general width.
It extends back to the Dividing range or Blue
Mountains, which Range divides the watershed
of the colony, the fall cowards the sea being generally
rather abrupt. Speaking generally, this district
has fine fertile soil, and is settled on throughout the
whole of its area, from the north to the south, It
is well watered b3 many fine rivers, most of which
periodically overflow their banks from the rainfall in
the mountains; and although theselioods undoubtedly
do much mischief to farmers, they cover the flat
and bottom lands with a fine, rich alluvial deposit
that will produce any kind of crop in abundance,
and can be cropped for years without fallowing or
manure. The table-lands arc a high plateau or
elevated district, furrowed here and there with
precipitous valleys, frequently presenting, on the
seaward side, nearly perpendicular escarpments.
These high lands traverse the entire length of the
country, and extend westward to about the 141 st
meridian. The shape of the plateau is irregular.
On it, at a distance of sixty or seventy miles from
the coast, are found the loftiest mountains in the
colony. Westward of the 141 st meridian there is
a gradual fall to the great plains of the interior.
These plains are lightly timbered, well-watered, and
clothed in favourable seasons with a luxuriant
verdure ; they form the chief pasture lands of Now
South Wales.
The most fertile soil in the colony perhaps in the
world are to be found on the margin of the rivers,
particularly the bottom lands of the Clarence, Mac-
leay, Manning, Hunter, liawkesbury, and Shoal-
haven. Sugar, maize, the vine and semi-tropical
plants grow plentifully in the north.
The Great Southern line of Railway to Goulburn,
134 miles from Sydney, passes through country much
of which has been long under cultivation, and in
which most of the pursuits of agriculture and horti-
culture are successfully carried on. At Mittagong,
77 miles from Sydney, rich and extensive deposits of
coal and iron exist in close proximity to the railway,
and some of the soil of the district is singularly fer-
tile. Indeed, with some exceptions, it may bo said
that good arable land occurs nearly all the way
to Marulan, 114 miles, where excellent marble is
found. Goulburn, and much of the country through
which the lino runs, possesses a mild and salubrious
climate, in which English fruits, vegetables, and
cereals thrive luxuriantly. The Great Northern
Railway, in the first portion of its course, passes
over coal fields of great extent and value, the pro-
duce of which it conveys to Newcastle. In nearly
its whole length it intersects a good agricultural and
grazing country, with a soil producing fine crops and
luxuriant pasturage. The Great Western line passes
by orangeries, vineyards, and homesteads ; but with
the exception of a mile or two westward of Penrith,
the land is too rugged and mountainous for agricul-
tural purposes until the Bathurst plains are reached.
The land to the southward of Sydney on the coast,
the Illawarra district and beyond, is employed for
dairy farming purposes, and supplies the metropolis
with much of its produce of milk, butter, and the
other accompaniments of the breakfast-table. Large
areas are laid down with English grasses, which here
flourish in all their native luxuriance.
Boundaries.
New South Wales is bounded on the north by the
Colony of Queensland ; on the east by the X’acific
Ocean ; on the south by the Colony of Victoria ; on
the west by South Australia. The 141 st meridian
in the dividing line from South Australia ; the 29th
parallel with an irregular line to Point Danger
divides it from Queensland ; and an imaginary lino
drawn from Cape Howe to the nearest source of the
Murray and by the westerly course of that river
separates it from Victoria.


Area and Dimensions.
New South Wales contains an area of 323,4137
square miles being about three times the size of
Great Britain and Ireland. Its greatest length is
900 miles ; its greatest width 860 miles.
Mountains.
The mountains of New South Wales extend ovrer
a large area. The principal ranges are the Interiior
Ranges, the Great Dividing Ranges, and the Cosast
Ranges. The Great Dividing Range forms the maiin
watershed of the country. It consists of seven maiin
branches. The most remarkable of the isolatced
mountains and groups arc Mount Doubledufee,
Whoman, Elaine, Yarrahappini, ICibbora, the thrteo
brothers, Mount Talowah, Dromedary, Mumbulßa,
and lastly Imlay or “ Baloon.”
Plains.
The western part of the Colony consists of nu-
merous tracts of country. The principal of these
are the Liverpool plains which cover an extent of
10,000,000 acres. The next in importance are the
Manaro plains which are not properly speaking-
plains but gently swelling undulations with a rich
soil well-watered. They form a plateau 2,000 feet
above the level of the sea. The other extensive
plains are South Park, and Jerry, and Patrick’s
plains.
Lakes.
The largest lake is Lake George. It is situated
on the top of the tableland of the Dividing Range,
2,129 feet above the level of the sea. There is no
outlet for the water, being surrounded on all sides by
gigantic mountains —it is saline and is freely drank
by cattle. The other lakes are Lake Bathurst, Tar-
rago, Burra Burra, Macquerie and Illawarra.
Rivers,
The rivers of New South Wales are the Darling,
Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, Murray, Hawkesbury,
Hunter, Shoalhaven, Clarence, Macleay, Richmond,
Hanning, Hastings, Karnah, Clyde, Moruya, Tuross,
Bega, and Towamba. The greatest and most impor-
tant of all these are the Murray, the Darling and the
Murrumbidgee.
Capes.
New South Wales can number 25 Capes, the
principal of which are Point Danger, Cape Byron,
Smoky Cape, Cape Hawke, Sugarloaf Point, Point
Stephens, Cape Banks, Cape Solander, Point Per-
pendicular, Cape St. George, Green Cape and Cape
Howe.
Rays.
There are eighteen bays or inlets. The principal
are Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay, Botany Bay, Port
Jackson, Middle Harbour, Broken Bay, Port Hunter
and Port Stephens.
Subdivisions.
The Colony of New South Wales is divided into
13 Pastoral Districts namely : Monaro, a high table
land, 40 to 50 miles from the coast at the South
Eastern extremity, with an area of 8,335 miles ; Mur-
rumbidgee, to the south-west, with an area of 26,897
miles of grazing country; Lachlan, to the north odf
the Murrumbidgee district, area 22,809 square miles ;;
Wellington, to the north-east, has an area of 16,695>
square miles ; Bligh, to the eastward of the Welling-
ton district, has an area of 5,000,000 acres of
land; Liverpool Plains, to the north-east, area,,
1 6,901 square milef; Gwydir, adjacent to thee
northern boundry of the colony, contains an area of
11,075 square miles; New England lies to the east-
ward of the Gwydir district, area, 13,100 square
miles; Macleay is on the north-east coast, area
3,180 square miles ; Clarence occupies the north-
east corner of the colony, and contains an area of
5 000 square miles; Darling is situated at the
south-western extremity of New South Wales, area
50,000 square miles ; Alrert comprises the whole
of the north-western portion of the colony, its area
is about 60,000 square miles ; Warrego lies to the
eastward of the Albert, and occupies a north-central
position, its area is about 10,000 square miles. Of
the general characteristics of these districts it may
be said that the Murrumbidgee, Lachlan, Wellington,
Bligh, and Darling districts are in the main admir-
ably adapted for grazing purposes. The districts of
Liverpool Plains, New England, Macleay and
Clarence are suitable for farming operations;
Monaro, though very rugged, has some choice land :
Gwydir consists principally of open plains well
grassed ; Albert has much rich land, available for
either grazier or settler; the Warrego has some
agricultural land, with much of a barren character.
The Colony' has also been divided into counties,
of which there arc now in number one hundred and
eighteen, known as the Old or Proclaimed counties,
and the New. The Old counties near the coast ai-e
all more clearly defined and more densely inhabited
than the New Counties of the interior, each of which
is larger in its area than some of the smaller
European States. Though these districts were
originally taken up by squatters for sheep and cattle
stations, they are now becoming gradually occupied
by agriculturists and other classes of colonists.
Climate.
Great diversity of elevation and a stretch over nine
degrees of latitude at a favourable distance from the
Equator offer every variety of temperature and
humidity in Now South Wales, from the cold of the
north of Scotland to the warmth of southern Italy ;
the mean shade temperature of Sydney is 62° 6', and
is very near the mean temperature of the Colony.
With regard to moisture, which is such an important
factor in climate, one may enjoy the balmy and
humid air of the Clarence which is tropical in its
character, or the bracing climate of the tablelands,
with a mean temperature of 55°, and a minimum
sometimes down to 22°, and the attendant abundant
snows of winter; but not a single locality in the
whole expanse can be pronounced unhealthy. So
pure is the atmosphere in the districts where the
thermometer shows the highest readings that the heat
is never intolerable, whilst during at least six of the
twelvemonths the climate is delightful.
Dry seasons come in this as in other countries at
uncertain intervals, but the settlement of the interior
is not only increasing the water in creaks and rivers,
but bringing with it such a multitude of reservoirs
for preserving the abundant rains, and of wells for
getting water from below, that droughts are no longer
the terror they used to be.
In a paper on the climatology of the colony, Mr.
Henry Russell, the Government Astronomer, says :
“ In New South Wales generally we have a climate
approximating to that of South Europe, and so
modified by the physical features of different parts
that all varieties may be found, from the cold of
Kiandra—where frost, snow, and hail reign for a
considerable portion of the year, to the heat of our
inland plains, where the thermometer sometimes
reaches 140 degrees in the shade, and is for the
greater part of the summer over 100 degrees, and


where rain enough to wet the ground is sometimes
not seen for eighteen months.”
Natural History.
Nearly all the animals of New South Wales are of
the marsupial order, that is, having a natural pouch
in which to carry their young, the foremost of -which
is the kangaroo. The wallabys and paddymelons
are a smaller species. The more inferior and smaller
animals consist of the bandicoot, the wombat, the
opossum, the kalo, or native bear, the native cat, a
pretty but destructive animal, the platypus, and
native hedgehog. Snakes are very- plentiful; the
death adder and the yellow snake are the most
dangerous. There are several kinds of lizards, the
most important of which is the iguana. The birds
are of great variety and beauty. The great king-
fisher, or laughing jackass, can be met with in most
parts, its strange and peculiar so-called laugh
making the bush echo in the early morning and sun-
down. Cockatoos, parrots, parroquets, quails, native
pheasants, the bush turkey, the wild turkey, the
emu, lyre bird, bower bird, the crane, heron, and
black swan are all exceedingly plentiful. Insects
are the most prolific. Bees, ants, mosquitoes,
locusts, and spiders swarm everywhere. Fish are
most plentiful, and in the rivers and seas that
fringe the colony are the bream, mullet, whiting,
schnapper, jewfish, flathead, and garhead. Oysters
thrive well. The most important oyster beds are in
the neighbourhood of Port Jackson, and in the
Hunter, Clarence, Manning, and Clyde rivers.
Vegetable Productions
Amongst the indigenous plants of New South
Wales are the Acacia, of which there are 100 varie-
ties. The Eucalyptus or gum tree is peculiar to
Australia, of which there exists 27 species. Many
kinds are found to be admirably adapted for ship buil-
ding purposes, also for housekeeping and cabinet
works. The ironbark and the oak are the most valu-
able next to the cedar, which is found in the northern
part of the colony, its home being chiefly the alluvial
flats of thetributaries of the eastern rivers. There are
also several native trees and plants, which, if properly
analysed and described, would lead to a knowledge of
many new and valuable products that might be
obtained from the flora of Australia.
The vegetation of New South Wales is noticeable
for the large number oc distinct species it contains,
and for their dissimilarity from the species of other
countries. There exist about 10,000 species of flower-
ing plants in Australia, being more than is contained
in the whole of Europe. Over 1,200 species of native
plants have been observed in the County of Cumber-
land alone, and large numbers yet remain to be
recorded. Many of these plants are highly organ-
ized, and yet capable of resisting great extremes of
heat and cold. Some of the noble eucalyptus, with
their peculiar vertical branches and evergreen leaves,
reach to the height of 120 feet, with a girth of from
twelve to twenty feet. The highest tree in the
world—4Bo feet —was discovered in Australia, and
several trees are now to be seen over 420 feet high.
There are about 300 different species of acacias, or
wattles, with fragrant blossoms. One exhibitor at
the Sydney International Exhibition showed 867
varieties of seeds of trees, shrubs, &c., indigenous to
Australia.
The Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens
states : —“ No country has been favoured by Nature
with a greater variety and abundance of trees yield-
ing strong, beautiful, and durable timbers than the
Colony of New South Wales.” Mr. Moore also
observes that good timber can be obtained in every
part of the Colony, some parts of the Monaro,
Murrumbidgee, and Murray districts excepted. The
banks of the coast rivers are supplied with a
luxuriant growth of the best kinds. There are
about fifty species of the Eucalyptus. Upwards of
seventy specimens of woods of the Colony were
officially tested at the Sydney Royal Mint, in 1861,
at the request of Sir William Denison; and the
result showed that for strength and elasticity
“ many of the woods were superior to the ash, the
oak, and the best woods of Great Britain.” In a
recent report from Mr. Forest-ranger Piper, he
states that over half a million feet of pine have been
cut on a conditional purchase of 50 or 00 acres on
the Richmond River proving how heavily some of
the forest land is timbered in New South Wales.
A state nursery has been recently founded at
Campbelltown for propagating choice trees.
The large variety of fruits that thrive in the
Colony affords another illustration of the diversity of
soil and climate that the country enjoys. The prin-
ciple fruits produced are;
Apples, over 200 varieties. Oranges
Pears, ~ 100 ~ Lemons and Limes
Apricots ~ 20 ~ Shaddocks
Cherries ~ 40 ~ Citrons
Nectarines 19 ~ Bananas
Peaches ~ 45 ~ Strawberries
Plums ~ 60 ~ Chestnuts
Grapes „ 50 ~ Walnuts
Mulberries, many ~ Jack-fruit
Figs ~ ~ Loquats
Medlars Date Plums

Almonds Cocoa-nuts
Nuts Chinese Raisin
Guavas ~ Longan
Passion-fruit Pine-apples
Blackberries Pomegranates
Custard Apple Rose Apples
Raspberries Cape Gooseberries
Currants Olive
Gooseberries &c., &c.
The cabbage tree palm grows in the coast
districts.—Ferns grow in great profusion in the
mountain gullies. Wild flowers grow in most profuse
luxuriance ; the native tulip, the Christmas tree and
varieties of lilies being the most striking.
Sydney,
The capital of New South Wales, and the seat of
the first Australian settlement, is considered one of
the most attractive places in the Southern hemis-
phere. Port Jackson is estimated as one of the
finest harbours of the world, and including all its
bays and inlets it is 12 miles square. “ The rocky
shore on each side stretches from heights of 20*0
feet down to the water’s edge, disclosing at intervals
in the distance the white candy beach of a bay which
Stanfield or Copley fielding would have loved to
paint. The well-wooded hills, clothed in the bright
garb of Spring, or in the russet of summer and
bathed in the glorious light of an Australian atmos-
phere, form a charming margin to the bright blue
waters they enclose. As the city is approached,
pretty villas and imposing mansions, surrounded with
gardens and orchards, crown the heights or extend
along the shores.”
Dr. Erasmus Darwin long ago predicted the future
greatness of Sydney in the following lines—


Where Sydney Cove her lucid bosom swells,
Courts her young navies, and the storm repels ;
High on a rock amid the troubled air
Hope stood sublime, and wav’d her golden hair ;
Calm’d with her rosy smile the tossing deep,
And with sweet accents charm’d the winds to sleep ;
To each wild plain she stretched her snowy hand,
High-waving wood, and sea-encircled strand.
“ Hear me,” she cried, “ ye rising realms ! record
“ Time’s opening scenes, and Truth’s unerring word—
“ There shall broad streets their stately walls extend,
“ The circus widen, and the crescent bend ;
“ There ray’d from cities o’er the cultured land
“ Shall bright canals and solid roads expand,
“ There the proud arch, colossus-like, bestride
“ Yon glittering stream, and bound the chafing tide ;
“ Embellished villas crown the landscape scene,
“Farms wave with gold, and orchards blush between
1 ‘ There shall tall spires and domc-capt towers ascend,
“ And piers and quays their massy structures blend ;
“ While with each breeze approaching vessels glide,
“ And northern treasures dance on every tide!”
The rapid growth of Sydney is extraordinary,
there is an unabated demand for homes, and in the
business part of the city public offices, warehouses,
capable of holding 10,000 tons, shops and every

In connection with the Church of England a new
Diocese is about being created in the Southern por-
tion of the Colon), through the liberality of the
Hon. John Campbell, w'ho has endowed it with
£lO,OOO. It will be a sub-division of the Goulburn
diocese, and Hay will be the cathedral city of the
new diocese, which will take in a considerable por-
tion of Riverina.


Government.
The government of New South Wales unites the
vital principles of the British system with the free
play of Democratic power. There is first, the Queen’s
Representative ; then the Legislative Council
and Legislative Assembly, the latter of which is the
first in power. Members of the Legislative Council
hold their seats for life. Members of the Legislative
Assembly are elected under a Triennial Act. The
Ministry consists of Colonial Secretary, and Premier,
Colonial Treasurer, Minister of Public Instruction,
Attorney General, Secretary for Lands, Secretary for
Public Works, Postmaster General, Secretary for
Mines, Minister of Justice, Vice Piesident of the
Executive Council. “ The common law of the
mother Country is as valid in the humblest Court of
this Colony as at Westminster.- The administration
of Justice is very efficient. Judges of the Supreme
Court, in addition to presiding in the Courts at
Sydney, make circuits through the Colony to try
grave criminal cases. District Court Judges have
with certain exceptions common law jurisdiction up
to £2OO. Their criminal jurisdiction as Chairmen of
Quarter Sessions extends to all cases other than
capital. In the Metropolitan Districts there are six
Stipendiary Magistrates, and in every other district
there is a Bench of magistrates, generally presided
over by a paid Police Magistrate. Life and property
are as secure as in the older countries. There is not
a district without police surveillance, or a locality
where the risk of of violence is greater than in the
United Kingdom.
Education
New South Wales was the first Australian Colony
to found a University It is constituted on the
model of British Universities, and supported by the
State, and has cost in building and endowments
£200,000.
By the Public Instruction Act of 1880, “all the
powers exercised by that body were transferred to
the Minister of Public Instruction. Teachers are
now recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by
fixed salaries. The school fees are paid into the
Treasury as revenue. Regulations have been made
under this Act for establishing evening public
schools, provisional schools, superior public schools,
and high schools, and also for employing itinerant
teachers and work-mistresses. Under the Chief
School Inspector are placed the district inspectors for
the metropolitan and six country districts, into which
the Colony is apportioned for examination purposes.
A Chief Examiner has been appointed to supervise
the training school for candidates, and with his
Assistants to report upon the papers of teachers seek-
ing a higher classification. The school attendance
and payment officer has to carry out the provisions
of the Act relating to the payment of fees into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund and the obligatory
attendance of children. The attendance has increased
during the past year. The compulsory clauses which
are being enforced, and the reduction of the school
fee from an average of 6d. to 3d. per week, have had
a marked effect. Provision is made for educating
children who are unable to pay school fees, and for
maintaining schools for neglected children, instead
of a Board for each school, one is now appointed for
each district, and such Boards are vested with
powers to act under the Minister of Public Instruc-
tion. An architect has been appointed to supervise
the building of Public Schools, which are now
erected wholly at the expense of the Government.
There are 150 Denominational Schools in the Colony,
but these will to be supported by the State
after 1882. General religious instruction is provided
for by the Act, It may be imparted in all the
Public Schools, by the teachers, and by clergymen
of the various denominations, who are entitled to
appropriate one hour a day for the purpose.
For the purpose of inspection the Colony has been
divided into seven school districts, each of which is
supervised by a district inspector, under whom are
one or more inspectors. On January 1, 1882, there
were : —A chief inspector, seven district inspectors,
and sixteen inspectors; and at the same date there
had been made fifty-eight school districts, 27 of
which were supervised by public School Boards,
composed of “ gentlemen of repute and position.”
In connection with the University there are
several public and “In Memoriam ” scholarships,
of the annual value of £5O, bursaries varying up to
£75, and medals of £lO to £3O value, which are
awarded to successful candidates. The University
is presided over by a Chancellor, the government
being in the hands of the Senate, consisting of sixteen
elective fellows, and +’rom three to six ex-officio
members, being Professors of the University. For
the year ending December 31, 1881, the receipts,
including the annual endowment of £5,000 fror*. the
State, a donation of £5,000 from Thomas Walker,
Esq., and a balance brought from the previous year
of £2,540 Is. 9d., were £22,223 4s. lid. ; the
expenditure was £10,693 4s. lid.; the balance in
hand being £1,620 os. 2d. In 1881, 21 students
passed the statutory examination and were admitted
to matriculation. The degrees conferred were eight
M.A. and ten B.A. The public examinations are
similar to the middle class examinations of Oxford
and Cambridge. They are held annually in Novem-
ber, and arc intended to test the qualifications of
boys attending schools or being instructed privately.
They arc divided into Senior and Junior, and certi-
ficates of competency in the several subjects of
examination are given to the successful candidates.
At the public examinations held in November, 1881,
in Sydney, and in the following 20 centres, Albury,
Armidale, Bathurst, Brisbane, Cowra, Forbes,
Hobart, Orange, Richmond, Windsor, Goulburn,
Grafton, Ipswich, East Maitland, Mittagong, New-
castle, Queanbeyan, Singleton, Toowoomba, and
Yass, 48 candidates presented themselves for the
senior examination, and 392 for the junior examina-
tion, of whom 36 senior candidates and 231 junior
candidates were successful. These examinations are
distinct from the examinations for the Civil Service.
The University up to the present time has cost in
buildings and endowment upwards of £200,000. In
1880 the Chancellor was apprised that the late Mr.
John Henry Challis had bequeathed his residuary
estate (after the payment of certain legacies and
annuities, and subject to certain conditions), amount-
ing to about £lBO,OOO, to the University. Its
degrees entitle to the same rank, title, and precedence
as those of the Universities of the United Kingdom.
The affiliated Colleges are intended for theological
instruction. They comprise St. Paul’s (Church of
England), which is under the government of a
council consisting of a warden in holy orders, and
eighteen fellows, of whom six are clergymen ; St.
John’s (Roman Catholic), under the control of a
council, consisting of a Rector (who must be a priest)
and eighteen fellows, six of them being priests, and
St. Andrew’s (Presbyterian), controlled by a cor-
poration of a Principal, who is a Presbyterian
minister, and twelve councillors, eight of whom are
laymen.
On January 1, 1882, the number of Educational


establishments in the Colony, including State and
other public schools and private schools, was 2,066,
taught by 1,655 male and 2,117 female teachers, in
all 3,772, with 101,450 boys, and 95,962 girls under
instruction. The amount received from the State
funds for the purpose of education was£4 74,157 ss. 7d.
tions cannot be given until the returns from tho late
Census are published, but the following tables show
the number of churches and chapels,and of ministers,
at the beginning and end of the decade :

Meliglon
There is no State Church in New South Wales,
and therefore religious bodies are on a perfect equal-
ity in all respects. Tho Church of England within
the Colony is governed by five Bishops—one in the
diocese of Sydney, one in the diocese of Newcastle,
one in the diocese of Goulburn, one in tho diocese
of Bathurst, and one for Grafton and Armidale.
The Lord Bishop of Sydney is the Primate of Aus-
tralia. The Roman Catholic Church is controlled by
an Archbishop, and there are the Bishops of Mait-
land, Goulburn, Bathurst, and Armidale. The Pres-
byterian Churches are, the Presbyterian Church of
New South Wales and the Synod of Eastern
Australia. Then there are the Congregational TJnion
of New South Wales, the Wesleyan Methodist
Church, the Baptist Church, tho Primitive Methodist
Church, Particular Baptist Church, the United
Methodist Free Church, United Free Gospel Church,
Independent Methodist Church, German Evange-
lical Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church,
Unitarian Church, Jewish Synagogues, and the
Christian Israelites.
Annual synods are held by many of the religious
denominations, at which matters relating to tiheir
welfare are discussed and settled. Tho number: of

Railways
The railways of the Colony arc divided into the
Southern, Western and Northern systems. The
Southern stretches from Sydney to Ahury 386 miles ;
— xxwuxj uou IU.UUO ;
at Junee the South-western branches from the
Southern line and runs to Hay, which stands on the
Murrumbidgee and is one of tho most important
towns in the district known as Eiverina. The
principal _ towns along- the Southern and South -
western lines are Liverpool, Gampbelltown, Picton,
Mittagong, Mossvale, Goulburn, Bass, Murrum-
hurrah, Cootamuudra, Wagga-wagga, Albury,
Narrandera and Hay. The Northern line is at
present completed as far as Uralla, 255 miles from
Newcastle, but it is being extended to Tenterfield a
total length of 292 miles. The lines authorised, but
not yet commenced include a railway to connect’ the
Southern and Northern systems viz., by, a line from
Home-bush to IVhratah, to connect the Southern
and Western systems by a line from Murumburrah
Blayney, a line from Sydney to Wollongong and
Kiamu, from Goulburn to Cooma, from Cootamundra


to Gundagai, from Narrandera to Terilderie and
from Orange to Forbes.
The transactions for 1881, during which 146
miles of lines were opened, show the gross earnings
to be £1,444,226, and the working expenses
£738,334, leaving a net earnings of £705,892,
which, upon the capital invested in lines 0pen —
£13,301,597 —gives the splendid return of 5-31 per
cent., a return higher than over paid previously in
Now South Wales, or in any of the Australian
Colonies. The earnings per average mile of lino
were £1,510; expenditure per mile, £772; the net
earnings, £738; the earnings per train mile being
88-33, the expenditure 45-16, net earnings
43-17.
The number of persons engaged in the railways
and tramwavs were 6,726; the wages paid being
£672,802.
The passengers carried during the year were
6,907,312. The goods traffic amounted to 2,033,850
tons. Included in this traffic were 1,029,611 head of
live stock, 224,387 hales of wool, and 1,330,336 tons
of minerals.
The rolling stock for all lines at the end of 1881
numbered 233 locomotives, 532 passenger, and 4,849
goods vehicles.
The transactions for 1881 show an increase in
every class of trafflic; the coaching earnings
increased from £390,149 in 1880 to £488,675 in 1881 ;
the goods from £770,868 to £990,551, and the total
earnings from £1,161,017 to £1,444,226. The
number of passengers travelling increased from
5,440,138 to 6,907,312, the tonnage of goods from
1,712,971 to 2,033,850; but the most marked
increase of all is shown in the interest paid on the
capital expenditure, which from 4-36 per cent, on a
capital of £11,778,819 in 1880 was increased by
economy in the railway management and increased
traffic to 6'31 per cent, upoua capital of £13,301,597
in 1881.
Telegraphs.
In 1882, (he total number of miles of line wire
constructed was 14,278 miles with 318 stations.
During 1881 there were transmitted, 1,607,206
messages, the revenue being £98,664 17s. 4d. and
the expenditure £134,656 10s. 4d. Compared with
the previous year there is an increase of 1,089 miles
of wire, 29 stations, 287,669 messages and £14,554,
12s. Bd. revenue—the expenditure is also increased
by the sura of £19,938 18s. 9d. The total cost of
telegraphic communication up to December,lBBl, was
£492,211 6s. sd.
The cost of messages not exceeding ten words,
exclusive of name and address of sender and receiver,
is 1/- from any station to any part of the Colony ; addi-
tional words being charged Id. per word. Telegrams
from or to the Sydney office and suburban branches
are 6d. for ten words, and Id. every additional word.
To any of the neighbouring colonies the charge is
2s. for every ten words, and 2d. for every additional
word. (The stations on the overland line, South
Australia, not included; the charges vary from 4/-
to 12/- according to distance.) To Tasmania, per
cable, ten words cost 4/-, each additional word being
4d. To New Zealand the charge from Sydney is 7/-
for ten words, and 9d. for each additional word, the
maximum length of a single word is 10 letters, any
additional letter being counted and charged for as
extra words at the rate of 10 letters to a word. To
West Australia,ten words 3/-, each additional word 3d.
There has been direct telegraph communication with
Great Britain for some little time. A telegram to
London can bo forwarded at a cost, from Port Darwin,
of 9/3 per word, the colonial rate being added, or
\ 10/10 each, word from Sydney. The difference of
■ tinue between London and Sydney is lOh. sm. 135.,
; Syolney being in advance of London.
TThe telephone system is rapidly extending through -
outt the city, and proving a great benefit and
! comvcnience to those places of business already
! coninected therewith.
Nlearly all the recent improvements have been
ado/pted by the Department, and its show of scientific
apparatus at the recent International Exhibitions
! was of a complete and interesting character. Telo-
j graphic lines are not only to be found in all the
cenltres of population, but they have been extended
to (she most remote districts, and the scale of charges
has been greatly reduced, which has caused the
expenditure to exceed the revenue of late years. For
j one shilling a message of ten words can be sent to
any station in the Colony, and for two shillings to
any part of the Australian Continent. Thanks to
the enterprise of South Australia there is a line
1,800 miles long from Adelaide to Port Darwin,
which, connecting with the ocean cable, unites
Australia with every part of the world.
Postal.
Town letters (delivered within the limits of town
where posted), weighing half an ounce, one penny,
every additional half ounce, one penny. The Town
delivery in Sydney includes all places within a
ten miles’ radius. Inland and Intercolonial letters
(including Fiji) twopence for each half ounce. To
the United Kingdom letters via California are
charged a rate of 6d. per half .ounce; via Brindisi, or
via Naples per Orient line of Steamers, or via Torres
Strait, the rate is eightpence per half ounce.
Newspapers can be sent to Great Britain for one
penny ; if sent via Brindisi (he charge is twopence ;
they are delivered free within the Colony provided
they are not over seven days old. Postal cards are now
in use and are available within the limits of the
Colony, and also to the other colonies by affixing an
additional stamp.
The Post Office services show a development du-
ring the past decade. In 1871 there were 14,470
miles, and in 1880, 22,427 miles of postal lines.
The distance over which the mails of 1880 were
carried was 5,246,373 miles. The following is the
comparison of 1871 with 1880; Post offices: 1871,
570; 1880, 927. Receiving offices: 1871, none;
1880, 119. Letters: 1871, 7,509,500; 1880,
21,732,500. Newspapers: 1871, 3,992,100; 1880,
13,791,800. Packets: 1871, 158,300; 1880,711,600.
N owspapers are carried post free. The postage upon
inland letters is two-pence per half-ounce, and for
the same charge letters can bo sent to any part of
Australasia. The annual number of letters posted in
the colony gives a proportion of 26 to each head of
population. The revenue from postagein 1871 was
£84,890, in 1880 £194,084, and in 1881 £221,479.
In 1871 the communication between England and
Australia was almost confined to a monthly mail by
the route from Sydney to London via Melbourne,
Galle, and Suez, and to an experimental mail service
from Sydney to San Francisco. During the last few
years, however, the mail communication has been
increased by the establishment of several important
ocean services, some subsidized by one or more of
the colonies, and others maintained by purely private
enterprise. Amongst the subsidized lines, may bo
mentioned that between Sydney and San Francisco,
maintained by the Colonies of New South Wales
and New Zealand, at a joint annual cost of £72,500.
This line enables regular four-weekly communication
to bo maintained between Sydney and the United


Kingdom by way of America, and affords great corm-
mercial advantages as well as supplying a very com-
venient means of passenger traffic. The other subsii-
dized lines are, one from Melbourne to the United
Kingdom by way ®f Suez, once a fortnight, and ome
from Brisbane to the Mother Country, by way of Toir-
res Straits and Suez, monthly. In addition to the seir*
vices maintained under mail contracts, there is regulair
communication between Sydney and London, carried
on fortnightly by the Orient Line of steam packets.
These packets carry large numbers of passengers ;
but have no subsidy being paid for the conveyance ©f
mails at a rate per letter. In 1871 the quickest
transet of mails between Sydney and London occu-
pied 45 days, but the voyage has recently been
accomplished in 37 days.
The Money Order system of this colon}' corres-
ponds with similar systems in the United Kingdom
and elsewhere and is extended to Great Britain, the
United States, and some of the principal countiies of
Europe and the whole of Australia. There are now
399 money order offices established in connection
with the post offices of the Colony. Nine years ago
Government Savings Banks were also added to the
postal system and offices established in Sydney and
many of the country towns. Interest at the rate of
4 per cent being allowed on deposits of £2OO. The
balances at the credit of depositors already amount to
£586,496, at the credit of 21,602 accounts. This is
exclusive of the business done by the older institu-
tion, known as the Saving’s Bank of New South
Wales,which on Dec.3lst, 1880, held £1,489,360 in the
names of 36,929 depositors paying 5 per cent.interest
on amounts up to £IOO deposited in one name.

Seistilaitions.
There have been in Australia from the earliest days
many students of literature, science, and art. The
value of the standard works and periodicals imported
during each year from Europe, the number of works
circulated by the lending libraries in every' town,
and the large number of newspapers now published,
furnish evidences of the taste of the people in this
direction. During the last decade there has been ai
marked improvement developed in the science ami
art tastes of the community, and the recent formation!
of a Technical College and an Art Gallery will do
much in furthering education in the principles of
decoration and design. There are about one hundred
Literary and Scientific Institutions in the Colony,
so that in nearly every township there is a “ School
of Arts” or a “ Mechanics’ Institute.” £1 tor every
£2 raised for the building funds and endowment
equal to half the annual subscriptions is granted by
Parliament in aid of these Institutions. The follow-
ing is a list of Scientific and other Societies in the
Metropolis : The Royal Society of New South
Wales, the Art Society, the Technical College.
The Zoological Society, the Agricultural Society of
New South Wales, the Engineering Association, the
Architect’s Association, the Linnoean Society, the
Horticultural Society of New South Wales, the
Chamber of Commerce, the Builders’ and Contrac-
tors’ Association, the Trades and Labour Council, the
Health Society, the Surveyors’ Institute.
The Observatory, Free Public Library and the
Australian Museum are also worthy of notice here.
JExports aesd Imports.
The Imports for the year 1881 were £17,409,3 "6 ;
Exports, £16,049,503, the excess of imports over
exports being £1,359,823. The imports from the
United Kingdom were valued at £8,986,838, the
exports to Great Britain at £7,561,114. Compared
with the previous year there is an increase in the

Efitevenue.
The revenue for the year ending December 31st,
1881, amounted to £7,377,786 16s. lid., and was
obtained from the following sources, viz.: Taxation
£1,770,848 2s. 2d., land sales £2,229,981 10s. 3d.,
interest on lands conditionally purchased £253,356,
14s. od., pastoral and mineral occupation of Crown

the State, which include railways, telegraph and
post-office, &c., £1,945,075 4s. Bd., miscellaneous
receipts £177,414 19s. sd. The revenue for the
quarter ended September 30, 1882, amounted to
£1,709,962, an increase of £44,456.
Expenditure
The gross expenditure during the year 1881 wa
£5,890,579 17s. Id., leaving an estimated surplus of
£1,487,206 19s. lOd.
Public IScbt.
The public debt of the colony at the close of 1881
was £16,924,019 9s. 2d., the annual interest being


£767,269 Is. Bd., of which £451,541 10s. is on
£9,561,019 9s 2d. borrowed on 5 per cent, deben-
tures, and £315,727 11s. Bd. on £7,363,000 borrowed
on 4 per cent, debentures. Of the Loans contracted
by New South Wales, £11,500,000 have been for
railways, which now return an interest of 5'31 per
cent, annually on the capital invested.
Banks.
The total assets of the thirteen Banking Companies
of Sydney on December 31st, 1881, were £27,870,483 ;
the liabilities amounted to £22,394,316. The average
note circulation was £1,539,250, the coin and bullion
held amounting to £3,466,815. The paid-up capi-
tal was returned at £10,030,672 ; the yearly dividend
varied from four per cent. (Oriental Bank) to 25 per
cent. (Commercial Bank), the average being nearly
12 per cent. The aggregate dividend amounted to
£577,578. The reserved profits were returned at
£3,882,588. During 1881 the rate of interest allow-
ed on fixed deposits varied from 2| and 2 per cent,
for three months to 3 and 4 per cent, for 12 months.
The discount on local bills, ranging from 65 days to
about 126 days’ currency, was 6, 7, and 8 per cent,
per annum, the rates of exchange on London bills
was \ to \ per cent, premium.
On June 30th, 1882, the total assets of the thirteen
bank were £30,321,234 10s. 4d. and the liabilities
were £24,181,372 6s. 3d. ; the note circulation was
£1,595,302 18s. Bd. ; and the amount of reserved
profits £3,953,227 Bs. lOd.
Savings’ Bank.
On January Ist, 1882, there were 208 Government
Savings’ Banks. Depositors numbered 81,862, the
balance to their credit being £971,501 6s. lOd. The
interest at 4 per cent, added to depositors’ accounts
was £27,511 Is. sd. ; the average amount to the
credit of each depositor was £3O 10s. The Savings’
Banks money is principally invested in the New
South Wales 4 per Cents. Compared with 1880 the
increases are :■ —5,287 accounts opened, £376,412 Bs.
3d. in the amount deposited, and £385,005 3s. lOd.
in the credit balance at the close of the year. The
business greatly exceeded that of any previous year.
The New South Wales Savings’ Bank had 40,532
depositors, the amount to their credit being
£1,727,202 Is. Id. This money is invested in mort-
gages, Government Securities, and at deposit with
the Sydney banks. Sums of one shilling and upwards
may be deposited. Interest at the rate of 4 per cent,
is allowed in the Government Savings Bank, and 5
per cent, in the New South Wales Savings’ Bank.
Military ami 'Wolnnteer Forces.
On January Ist, 1882, the Regular Military Forces
of the Colony numbered in all 319, comprising 11
superior officers, 7 subalterns, 32 sergeants, and 9
trumpeters, and 260 rank and file. The Volunteer
forces comprised a Naval Brigade (one company at
Newcastle and the other in Sydney)—a corps of 335
men and officers, comprising 16 superior officers, 24
petty officers, 14 cadets and 276 A.B.’s. ; several
batteries of artillery, numbering 296 of all ranks ;
Infantry, numbering in all 1,276 officers and men ;
a Corps of Engineers 60 strong, and a Torpedo and
Signalling Corps of 98. The total forces, including
staff and bands, numbered 2,039. The number of
Artillery Guns is 115 mounted and 59 dismounted;
the calibre varies from 3”6 to 10 inch. Two of them
are 110-pounders, twenty-five 80-pounders, eighteen
68-pounders, six are 18-ton guns, six 12-ton guns,
and two 25-ton guns; others are of smaller
weight and calibre. During 1881 the expendi-
ture on account of the defences, including Military
Stores, Buildings, and Fortifications, Military
Forces, Naval Brigade, Torpedo boats, &c., -was
£80,077 19s. 7d.
Police Force.
On January Ist, 1882, the police comprised a total
of all grades of 1,200. The mounted police con-
sisted of 8 superintendents, 4 inspectors, 22 sub-
inspectors, 24 senior sergeants, 37 sergeants, 129
senior constables, and 307 constables. The foot
force had 22 senior sergeants, 35 sergeants, 61 senior
constables, and 540 constables. The detective force
is also attached to the body.
Social Fosltiois of the Colony.
With regard to the political and social position of
the Colony, Mr. Thomas Richards writes as follows;
“ Since the introduction of Responsible Govern-
ment, in 1856, there have been ten Parliaments,
which have existed on an average about two and a
half years. There have been thiity-two Sessions
and nineteen Ministries; the nineteenth Ministry,
with Sir Henry Parkes as Colonial Secretary and
Premier, being still in office. Although the Parlia-
ments have not had duration equal to those of Great
Britain, and the consequent opportunity for effect-
ing legislative reforms, a great many measures of a
difficult character and comprehensive scope have
been passed; railways and telegraphs have been
spread throughout the country ; roads have been
constructed in every direction ; the land laws have
been equitably settled; and the education system
greatly improved.
The prestige attached to political power is enjoyed
to the fullest extent by the masses; every male adult
who has been a resident for six months is entitled to
vote at elections for Members of Parliament, and the
ballot secures him from undue influence or interfer-
ence in the free exercise of the suffrage.
In some countries wages may be higher than in
New South Wales, and in others living may be as
cheap, or the climate as favourable, but there is none
where those who live by the sweat of their brow can
realize so nearly as in New South Wales the paradise
of their class, namely, the union of high wages with
short hours, good living, and a fine healthful climate.
The Colony, it is true, is distant from the great
seats of manufacture, but a liberal tariff, low
freights, quick transit, and good discounts enable
the merchants of Sydney to land most of the articles
of commerce at their selling prices in the places of
shipment. It is necessary to import some flour, but
it can bs procured from the adjacent Colony of
South Australia, which also exports a large quantity
profitably to England. The tea, coffee, and rice
ports of the East are far nearer to Port Jackson
than they are to the ports of Europe. As for animal
food, meat is obtainable at prices which would
delight the European housewife. There are vast
stores of coal cropping out on plain, valley, and
mountain, and along the coast line of the Colony.
With the exception of threepence a pound upon tea,
and three farthings a pound upon foreign sugar,
there are no Customs duties upon the necessaries of
life which the workman need pay.
The large capitalist who desires to invest in pas-
toral pursuits can secure a fine property in the
settled districts, which, with sound judgment, he may
convert into a valuable estate. The small capitalist
can find openings as a pioneer in the West. The
dairy farmer can obtain a holding in any of the
coast districts where be may produce butter and
cheese, eggs and bacon, lamb and veal, for the


metropolitan market. The agriculturist .can find a
home on the banks of the coast rivers and on the
table-lands of the south or the north. The grazier
can combine agriculture with the fattening of stock
on the western slopes. The vigneron can bring
the juice of the grape to perfection in south-west,
west, and north. There are immense areas open to
all, over which as yet primeval verdure reigns. The
development of the agricultural interest of the
Colony' by every legitimate means is the question
which should be studied above all others. Pastoral
industry, mining enterprize, manufactures, and
commerce are making more progress than the
plough ; yet in a great and undeveloped territory
the cultivation of the soil is of supreme importance,
and the growing of the cereals, fruits, and economic
plants will doubtless soon receive greater attention
from the colonists than they have hitherto done.
The sum of £75,000 has been voted for the pro-
motion of Immigration in 1882. The regulations
are liberal. The immigrants are selected by the Agent
General for the Colony in London, or by persons
appointed by him, and the selection is limited to such
adults as can pay £5 towards the cost of their passage.
In the case of families, children under 3 years of age
in charge of their parents, are free ; the children
between 3 and 14 years are admitted at half the
amount payable by adults. The selection is made
from England, Scotland, and Ireland, and is propor-
tionate to the number of people of these nationalities
in the population of the Colony, according to the
Census of 1881; but 10 per cent, may be selected
from other European countries. Good health and
moral character are indispensable recommendations.
Married couples must not exceed 35 y'ears cl age, and
are taken with or without children ; unmarried men
or women must not exceed 30 y'ears of age; and not
more than one-third of the Immigrants are to be
unmarried. If the age exceeds these limits, the
passage money' is £l5. Mechanics, farmers, miners,
vine-dressers, labourers, and domestic servants are
chosen with a special view to the industrial callings
of the Colony and the fluctuations affecting the
same. Small working capitalists in any branch of
colonial industry' are deemed highly eligible.
Deposits may be made either with the Agent for
Immigration or the Clerks of Petty Sessions in the
Colony, and no advantage will be allowed in respect
of any' person brought out as a cabin or intermediate
cabin passenger. Deposits are returned when from a
just cause the persons in whose behalf they have
been made cannot or may not emigrate, unless in
cases of fraud or concealment of facts, or (in the
case of persons who have made their deposits within
the three Kingdoms) when a passage has been
actually provided and declined, but an emigrant may
be authorized to remain for another ship. Deposits
in excess are returned.
The facilities allowed on arrival in the Colony are
•—married couples, children, and single men may'
remain on board ship 7 days ; unmarried women are
provided for in the Immigrants’ Home for 14 days ;
immigrants proceeding to the interior receive free
railway' and steamboat passes.
With their immense areas and capacity,the Colon-
ics of Australasia look to the Mother Country for
help in the task of developing their resources, by
sending to them some of her superabundant popula-
tion. The emigrants from Great Britain to these
Colonies have returned far more wealth to the
Mother Country' than if they had stayed at home,and
calculations prove that a resident in New South
Wales now consumes relatively more manu-
factured articles than a dweller in the United Kingdom
It is not possible to contemplate the present
condition and future prospects of New South Wales
without a glow of satisfaction. There is so much
of plenty and happiness pervading all classes of the
community in contrast with those of other countries,
and the elements which can yield the like blessing
to millions more are scattered broadcast throughout
the land. The Colony has great pastoral wealth;
areas as large as kingdoms suitable for the leading
branches of husbandry; and untold treasures of
coal, iron, gold, copper, and tin waiting to be un-
earthed. A magnificent seaport capital shelters its
growing fleets, and gives it the command of much
of the trade of the Islands of the Pacific. There
does not seem to be any height of national develop-
ment to which the people of New South Wales may
not aspire if they rightly use their great opportuni-
ties. If Australians strive besides to emulate the
virtues of the British character, New South Wales
must fulfil the high mission for which its central
position and great natural resources fit it ; and
together with the other Australian Colonies realize
the patriotic hope of Wentworth by establishing
“A New Britannia in another World.”
SiHiiii laws.
Since 1861, the Land Laws have been amended in
some important particulars. The term ‘ ‘ person ’ ’
in the original Act had been made so elastic by'
judicial interpretation that selections were taken up
in the names of children, some of them in arms. To
set this right, and to discourage “ dummying,” that
is, selection by agents for the benefit of employers,
were the main objects of the Act of 1875. It has
also been enacted that “vicarious selection ” shall
be accounted a misdemeanour, punishable by impri-
sonment with hard labour for any term not longer than
two years ; and that no conditional purchase shall
be made by any person under sixteen y'ears of age.
The maximum area which one individual can select
has been increased from 320 to 640 acres, and so
soon as conditions of residence and improvements
are fulfilled, further areas of 640 acres can be
selected; and moreover, adjoining land to the
extent of three times the area of the purchase or
purchases can be taken up by the free selector under
pre-emptive lease, at an annual rental of £2 for each
selection of 640 acres, making a total area of 2,560
acres.
Applications for conditional purchases must be for
not less than 40 acres nor more than 640 acres, _ and
must be accompanied in each case with a deposit of
6/- per acre. The balance of the purchase money,
15/- per acre, may rest for three y'ears without
interest; and if not then paid, or within three
months thereafter, may be deferred from year to
year, subject to interest at the rate of 6 per cent,
per annum. Conditional purchasers may pay instal-
ments of one shilling per acre per annum, and may
make two or more such payments in any year, until
the debt, principal and interest, shall have been
extinguished.
Under the original Act of 1861 and the Amending
Aet of 1875, the period of residence required for a
conditional purchase was three years, and the value
of improvements to be made £1 per acre. Under
the Act of 1880, the period of residence has been
extended to five years, and the value of improve-
ments reduced to 10/- per acre. Provision has also
been made for the purchase under right of improve-
ment by pastoral tenants of limited portions of their
runs.
An Act was passed in 1881 to regulate Eingbark-
ing on Crown Lands, and to limit claims for com

pensation for the same under section 15 of the
“ Lands Acts further Amendment Act of 1881.”
This Act prohibits ringbarking on Crown Lands by
lessees without authority under the hand of the
Minister, and imposes penalties for illegal ringbark-
ing. Claims to compensation for ringbarking must
be sustained by proof that its effect has been to
increase the value o£ the land to any purchaser,
conditional or otherwise. The compensation for
ringbarking is fixed at 1/3 per acre, payable on the
certificate of a Surveyor duly authorized in that
behalf
The progress of free selection has been very great.
The number of selections from 1861 to the end of
1880 being 141,329, and the area selected 15,677,070
acres. The gross amount realised was £5,867,912
9s. Bfd.; the amount of deposits received, less
refunds, £3,928,548; balances, £793,116; and
interest, £1,146,248. Crown Lands are also sold by
auction, and land so offered for sale but not disposed
of can, except in towns, be selected without compe-
tition at the upset price at which it was last sub-
mitted.
The increase in the alienation of land disposed of
otherwise than conditionally in the first and last
year of the decade 1871-1880 is as follows :
Price.
Year. a. r. p. £ s. d.
1871 88,637 2 10£ 99,959 0 0
1880 626,112 1 38i 722,732 17 2
The proceeds of the land sold otherwise than by
conditional purchase increased from £99,959 in 1871
to £2,196,922 4s. Bd. in 1877, but owing to the
decrease in the quantity of land put up for sale, and
the increase in the upset price, from £1 to £i ss.
per acre, the amount obtained during the years 1879
and 1880 fell off, but rose again in 1881, the returns
being as under :
Amount realized.
Under the free selection clauses there have been
15,677,070 acres taken up between Ist January,
1862, and 31st December, 1880, of which 4,003,391
acres were cancelled, forfeited or lapsed, leaving
11,673,679 acres of free-selected land outstanding.
The total area of land alienated from the crown un-
conditionally, from the foundation of the Colony to
the end of 1880, was 17,122,245 acres, and the
amount paid for it £14,395,600. That would make
a total alienation of 32,799,315 acres, or deducting
the cancelled selections, a net alienation of
28,795,924 acres.
Hioneer Work.
Twenty-five pounds thus enable a man to acquire
a homestead of 100 acres. The cost of agricultural
implements is a trifle greater in this Colony than in
England; but it is necessary that the farmer
should have money enough to provide himself with
rations until such time as he can reap a harvest
from his land ; and if he have cash enough to buy a
horse and cart (or a boat if his land be upon the
banks of a river), and to provide himself with a cow,
a few pigs, sheep, and poultry, he is practically
independent of all the world, for he has resources
within his own domain which will enable him to more
than supply all his legitimate wants, and to convey
his surplus produce to a market. Nothing is more
common in this genial climate than to see carriers
and drovers sleeping out, with the heavens as their
only canopy. Upon all the roads, lodging-houses
and hotels occur at convenient intervals ; and yet,
such is the force of habit and the fascination of the
oamp fire, that teamsters prefer this rough freedom,
and find the shelter of their drays sufficient. What
is of consequence is, that “camping out ” does not
seem to have any injurious effect upon the health
of those who thus expose themselves to the night
air ; so that shelter from the rain, which can be pro-
vided in a few hours, is all that is absolutely needed
in the way of lodging in the first instance. The
man, however, whose ambition it is to make a home
for his family and to acquire influence as a citizen,
is not content with bare shelter ; and his first
care, therefore, is to build himself a snug house, and
to enclose his ground. His land supplies him with
timber for both purposes, and all the trouble he is
put to is the labour of felling and shaping it. Bark
for the roof is obtainable in any length, from several
descriptions of forest trees which grow in every
part of the Colony, and it makes a capital covering—
impervious to the rain, warm and durable. Should
the settler have to resort to hired labour, a substantial
and comfortable structure of four rooms willprobably
cost him about £2O. His dwelling will have no
pretensions to architectural embellishment, but will
be quite as presentable as many of those wnich arc
thought good enough for the occupation of farm
labourers in the Mother Country, and being suited
to the climate, will be far more healthy. In only
few parts of New South Wales, and those of very
limited area, does winter visit us with the rigour
which involves the poor of Britain and Northern
Europe in so much privation and distress. In the
Coast Districts, and in many other parts of the
Colony, the farmer does not need to spend a farthing-
on the erection of sheds for the shelter of his stock
and the operations of the husbandman are never
suspended by frost or snow. Over a large extent
of country crops are produced in succession from
January to December ; and some descriptions of
produce—French beans, for example—may be had
fresh from the garden nine months out of the
twelve.
The Settler’s Home.
The character of the settler’s home depends
entirely upon himself, for neither scarcity of ma-
terials nor cost of labour offer any insuperable
obstacle to its being made as comfortable as heart
could wish. Many are content to live in rude
habitations, and disregard external appearances;
but every year brings with it improvement. Passion
vines, loaded every six months with globes of
luscious fruit, clothe the outbuildings of many a
hwmble tenement with foliage, glossy and green
through summer and winter. The grape-vine with
its massive clusters of yellow and purple fruit trail-
ing over the verandahs, gives a grateful shade
during summer and autumn to many a country home ;
while the settl r who is less utilitarian in his ideas
may if he prefers it, inhale the fragrance of the honey-
suckle or the rose, or embower his habitation in the
glowing hues of the Bignonia, the Bougainvillea, or
or other gorgeous climbers which elsewhere unfold
their floral magificence only under the costly nur-
ture of the conservatory. With the increase of
family life comes an increase of refinement, and the
multiplication of comforts. Flower gardens and
orchards are the produce of a few hours leisure, and
nothing is more pleasing in the spring of the year
than to see the agricultural homesteads which are
dotted over the face of the country enveloped in the
pink and white blossoms of the peach, the plum, the
apricot, the nectarine, the apple, and the pear,
which rest like a cloud upon the landscape, flushing

it with warmth and beauty. Such is the exuberance
of all descriptions of fruit-trees in this country that
a very small patch of ground gives abundance for
summer use, and more than enough for the con-
sumption of the year, if it be thought worth while
to dry, bottle, or preserve it.
Pastoral l&esourecs.
It would be almost impossible to limit the resour-
ces of New South Wales for pastoral enterprizc, as
there is no part of the Colony where sheep will not
thrive. It owns nearly as many sheep as all the
other Colonies put together. It possesses more cattle
than any of the other Colonies except Queensland,
and far more horses and pigs than any of the other
Colonies. The year 1880 showed an increase of
18,632,109 over 1871.
The following list shows the number of runs in
the thirteen pastoral districts into which the Colony
is now divided, and the area under pastoral occupa-
tion as estimated in 1880.

Pastoral Districts. No. of Runs, within boundaries.
4,323 154,427,199
The sworn returns rendered by owners last
year to the Chief Inspector of Stock gives a total
of 35,398,000 sheep for the Colony. The grand total
of sheep in Australasia is 75,238,000.
The area under lease to the pastoral tenants of the
Crown in the Colony will give some idea of the di-
mensions of the squatting interest. It is estimated
that for 1882 there will 132,000,000 acres under five
years pastoral lease, and more than 16,000,000 under
annual lease, or a larger extent than the whole of
France, occupied by pastoral runs. The following
are the particulars of the areas leased for grazing
purposes in 1871 and 1880 respectively

The area occupied up to the year 1848 was increased
during the twelve years which ended in 1860 by
7,336,941 acres, and the total for 1860 was increased
during the ten years which ended in 1870 by
72,156,979 acres. It took from 1788 to 1848—sixty
years—to occupy 42,000,000 acres; from 1848 to
1860 only added 7,300,000 acres ; whilst from 1861
to 1874, 134,000,000 acres were taken up, an area
7,000 square miles larger than England and Wales,
Scotland, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Den-
mark, Switzerland, and Greece combined. The
large quantity of land which during late years the
free selectors have taken from the runs of the squat-
ters must to that extent have reduced the area held
by the pastoral tenants. The figures for the last
year, nevertheless, show that 231,988 square nniles
were then rented from the Government, being 15j, 720
square miles more than at the beginning of the
decade.
The quality of cattle improves every day. The shows
of the Agricultural Society of New South Wales and of
district Societies of a similar nature have attracted an
extensive display. As much as 100 guineas have
been paid for a heifer and £l,OOO for a bull.
Sheep.
The fine-woolled sheep of the Colony came origin-
ally from the choicest flocks of Prance, Spain, and
Saxony. The process of acclimatization has modified
the original type of the Spanish merino. There has
been a very decided gain in the softness of the wool,
and an improvement in its elasticity. The wool has
increased in length, but diminished in density, so
that the weight of the fleece remains about the same.
The average of last year’s clip gave 41bs. 12ozs. of
greasy wool, or 21bs. 14ozs. of washed wool, to the
fleece. So admirably adapted is the climate of New
South Wales for the production of fine wool, that
experience has shown we have nothing to gain by
the importation of stud sheep from Europe. The
coarse-woolled sheep are chiefly depastured in the
Coast District, where they thrive better than the
merino. A flock of full-grown pure bred Leicesters
will shear from 5 lbs. to 7 lbs. of washed wool per
head, and lambs from three to four months old will cut
from 3 lbs. to 4 lbs. of washed wool. Three-year-old
wethers will weigh when killed from 160 to 200 lbs.
each. It is in the country to the west of the main
Dividing Range that the fine-woolled sheep are mostly
depastured. Great success has attended the efforts
made within the last few years to improve our flocks,
so that the clip is not only better got up, but there is,
on many stations, a younger, stronger, better-woolled,
and doubly valuable class of sheep, to that which
existed five or six years ago. In some districts more
than ninety per cent, of the lambs are saved.
Ilorncil Cattle.
The breeding and fattening of cattle is also largely
carried on. Short-horns and Herefords predominate.
We have only one herd of Devons. Great attention
has been paid to breeding, and our pedigree stock
now numbers more than five thousand. Agricultural
Societies now hold yearly exhibitions of stock and
produce in every part of the Colony ; and visitors
from Europe tell us that the cattle at our leading
shows would compare favourably with those shown
at Provincial Exhibitions of the Royal Agricultural
Society in England. The Intercolonial Exhibition
held in Sydney in 1870 was attended by more than
184,000 persons. It is by no means uncommon to
see pens of oxen, fattened on the natural grasses,
weighing 1,500 lbs. each and occasionally animals
appear whose weight exceeds 2000 lbs. Ordinarily
well bred bullocks, however, will leave a good run
at from 3J to 4 years old, weighing from 700 lbs. to
800 lbs., and cows, 150 lbs. less. There, meat is
generally excellent when killed, on or at a short dis-
tance from the station on which they are fed. It is
comparatively fine in the grain, well flavoured, and
fairly marbled. Foot and mouth disease, rinderpest,
and other malignant diseases of cattle, are unknown
in New South Wales.
Morses, Pigs, and Goats.
All the best breeds exist in the Colony ; but, in
regard to horses, we have not yet recovered the
deterioration which resulted from cross breeding and
the dispersion of the best studs in the year of the
gold discovery. An extensive trade for cavalry
remount was at one time carried on with India ; but
it has now fallen into the hands of speculators, and
is of a very uncertain character. There is still, how-


ever, a large demand for a really good description of
horses, which this Colony is in an especial manner
capable of supplying.
The llama and alpaca have been naturalized in the
Colony ; and in the Hunter District we have a flock
of 1,200 Angora goats, a fleece from which, forward-
ed to England, sold for 2/6 a pound. The clip from
each goat weighs between 4 lbs. and 6 lbs. There
arc several smaller flocks in the hands of farmers in
other parts of the Colony, and some attention is now
being directed to their increase and management.
A great deal of the wool of New South Wales is
sent to Victoria and South Australia for shipment,
but the rapid extension of railways into the heart
of the pastoral country is beginning to swell the
exports. # ln the district adjacent to the river
Murray, sometimes called Riverina, there are as
many sheep depastured as the whole number con-
tained in Victoria; and 64,387,604 pounds weight
of wool, of the value of £3,530,518, passed out of
New South Wales across the southern border last
5 ear. In 1880 the figures for the several Colonies
were:—
New South Wales, sheep, 35,398,121 ; cattle,
2,580,040; horses, 395,984 ; pigs, 308,205. Victoria,
sheep, 10,355,266 ; cattle, 1,285,481 ; horses, 275,

8,104,786 ; total horses, 1,206,100; total pigs,
1,026,898.
Agriculture.
New South Wales is daily showing its increasing
agricultural capabilities. At the Northern boundary
of the Colony is a district watered by 7, three rivers,
the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence, with an area
of 4,000,000 suitable for the growth of maize, sugar,
the vine, silk, cotton, arrowroot, coffee, tea, and
semi tropical fruits of every description. The rivers
Dellinger, Macleay, Hastings, and Manning water
an area of 3,000,000 acres adapted for maize and
sugar. On the banks of the Hunter com and hay
flourish in great abundance. The vine and most
cereals grow on the Upper Hunter. The principal
hay and corn crops are produced in the county of
Northumberland.
The Illawara district, and for 200 miles beyond, is
famous foi dairy produce. The district of Bega,
255 miles from Sydney is called “the garden of
Australia.” The high lands of Monaro, Braidwood,
Bungendorc, Yass, and Goulburn, with an area of
15,000,000 acres, possesses a climate similar to
England, and it is there that English cereals, fruits
and vegetables thrive. The table lands of New
England and Hunterfield 3,000 feet above the sea,
possesses the English climate without any of its
severity, and have there 14,000,000 acres suited to
English cereals and fruits. The mulberry tree of
every variety flourishes everywhere.
The climate, therefore, of New South Wales is
admirably adapted for the culture of wheat and all
other English cereals, maize, the vine, sugar, silk,
coffee, tea, tobacco, cotton, fruits of the temperate
zone, and fruits of the semi-tropical region. In
some parts of the Colony olives, cinchona indigo,
and rice can be grown.
A very large proportion of the cultivators of the
soil in this Colony began life with little capital and
less experience under conditions which in any other
calling or country would have rendered failure
inevitable but that they have not failed is the best
proof of the favourable conditions under which
agriculture can be carried on. A gentleman who
was for years a Minister of the Crown, stated before
a Parliamentary Committee, “ I know instances of
men in the Hunter District who have made thousands
and ten thousands by agriculture. I believe the
people of the Western District obtained their wealth
in the first instance by agriculture. Their stock
increased in numbers and value until the owners
became enormously wealthy, independent of their
agriculture, and then they gave up the cultivation
of the land as far as they were personally concerned.
The Clarence is one of the latest districts taken up
for farming purposes and the settlers there have
generally been very successful, Mr. B. began with
a capital of £lOO upon a freehold farm of 50
acres. He is now the owner of several valuable
farms, a number of superior well-bred cattle, and
has £3,000 and upwards invested in various
securities. Another farmer A. D. also bought hind
from the Government. In two years his farm
repaid him the amount of the purchase money,
and the cost of labour in clearing and cultiva-
ting. He is now the owner of some of the best
land in the district and is thoroughly indepen-
dent. Two single men having a joint capital of
£4O took up a farm of dense bush land, 70
acres in extent on a clearing lease of five
years. —At the end of the period they had each
earned upwards of £4OO. In New South Wales,
however, as probably in every part of the world,
agriculture is a slower, but at the same time, a surer
road to competence than most other pursuits. In
England the agricultural labourer is too often poorly
paid and badly fed. Ho spends his years in one
perpetual poverty, if not starvation ; and when at last
he can no longer keep the wolf from the door, his
heritage is a dispensation of parish pay. In Now South
Wales, two or three years of industry and frugality
will pass the farm labourer in possession of money
enough to ensure a fair start in life as a proprietor
and cultivator of the soil; and a few more years of
intelligent, well-directed toil, will enable him to
establish a home for himself and his family, and that,
too, while he is in the constant enjoyment of all the
comforts of life, and while his children are receiving
an education in the Public Schools of the Country
which may qualify them to occupy the highest posi-
tions of influence and power in the community. It
cannot for a moment be pretended that the farmer
in New South Wales is exempt from the common lot
of labour. If any man will not work, neither shall
he eat. The vicissitudes of climate, and the pre-
valence of insect life wdiich preys upon his crops,
have to be encountered here as elsewhere, but they
are not more formidable. Patience, industry, and
skill conquer all obstacles, and the man is physically,
intellectually, and morally the better for the conflict.
As he sows, so he reaps. He is never out of em-
ployment; his anxieties are “the ordinary vicissi-
tudes of more or less; his cares are, that he takes his
fair share of the business—that he is a free human
being, and not perpetually a child. He is no
longer a being of a different order from
the middle classes. He has pursuits like those
which occupy them, and give to their intellects the
greatest part of such cultivation as they receive.”


Wheat.
Wheat is the grain the most largely cultivated.
New South Wales outrivals South Australia as a
wheat producing country. The following figures
show the area and produce for the year ending 31st
March.
Acres. Bushels.
1872 154,030J 2,229,642
1881 202,540J 3,708,737
The valleys of the Hunter and the Hawkeshury
are well adapted for the growth of wheat. The
country lying north of the Murrumundi, the neigh-
bourhood of Tamworth, Armsdale, and Invercargill,
the districts of Orange, Young, Monaro, and Tamut,
are all wheat growing centres ; the yield averages
from 14 to 15 bushels to 25 bushels to the acre.
The Monaro district has averaged from 40 to 60
bushels per acre of the richest lands. For many
years the consumption of wheat flour in the interior
was chiefly supplied by grain imported from South
Australia and America, but all the inland markets
are now supplied by local production, and there is a
considerable importation now going on from New
South Wales into Southern Queensland and Vic-
Maize and Malzesia.
Maize, or Indian corn, shows a smaller area, but a
larger yield than wheat. In some localities the
returns range up to 80 and 100 bushels to the acre.
The manufactured article maizena or corn flour is
largely used as human food in America, and there is
a considerable demand for it in colonial markets. In
New South Wales itself it is only used as food for
horses.
The area and produce of the maize crops were :
Acres. Bushels.
1872 119,956J .. 4,015,973
1881 125,679 .. 4,483,457
Nothing can be more simple than the cultivation
of maize, and it is a crop which matures quickly.
Thus, in the County of Camden, for example, maize
sown in October is ready for harvesting from
February to April; and some varieties sown in
Novemher are ready for harvesting early in February.
It appears to be free from the attacks of insects and
fungi. A failure of the crop is never known, and
on the alluvial banks of some of our rivers it has
been grown year after year for a quarter of a century
and upwards.
Cereal and other Crops,
Barley, oats, rye, and other cereals grow on the
table lands of New South Wales as in England, and
the crops increase yearly. There are many parts of
the interior where the potato produces heavy crops,
hut up to the present time the cost of carriage has
prevented inland growers from taking advantage of
the Sydney market. Potato disease is unknown in
New South Wales. Lucerne hay, which is very
serviceable cattle food, grows abundantly on the
banks of the Hunter ; the crops are so prolific that it
may be cut six times during the season. Pumpkins
grow very abundantly and in thickly settled
districts are used as cattle food
Sugar.
The cultivation of the sugar cane was commenced
about the year 1868. In the Clarence District the
area under cane has increased year by year, ajnd in
1882 the production of sugar in that district would
hut for very unfavourable weather, have bceni from
10,000 to 12,000 tons. The banks of the Richimond,
the Manning, the Macleay, and the Tweed arre the
chief seats of sugar industry. A gentleman having
some experience as a manufacturer and grower
w'rites; “ The average yield will be about 35 tons
per acre although there are some favourable spots
along the banks of the Clarence which will yield
from 60 to 70 tons per acre. An acre of two-year-
old cane well cared for from planting to maturity
will yield about.2J tons of sugar, at 35 tons of cane
per acre, but if the best appliances for manufacture
bo used, higher results could be obtainable.” Some
growers state the yield to be at 60 tons for first crop
and 40 tons for the second. Mr. Angus Mackay, in
his work entitled “ The sugar cane in Australia”
writes: “The cost of making sugar varies much
according to the condition of the canes and the
system on which the business is sonducted. Grev
rations, on a large scale (worth fully £34 per ton)
have been made during this season at about £3 per
ton. That is the total cost from the time the canes
were cut in the field. The whole cost of growing
and making was about £l2 10s. per ton.”
No Chinese or coloured labourers are employed in
the production of sugar, all the work being done by
about 2,000 hands, who are engaged during the
season, which last from three to four months. The
area at present under cane is:—ln the Clarence,
7,250 acres; Richmond, 3,400 acres; Tweed, 1,225
—or a total of 11,875 acres, of which about 3,000
acres have been planted during 1881. The sugars
of New South Wales, having had the advantage of
being treated by experienced refiners, speedily
gained ground in the market, and there is a good
demand for them at prices ranging from £3O to £4O
a ton. The crops of sugar-cane were increased
during the decade as follows :

Tlie Wine.
New South Wales is eminently calculated for the
cultivation of the vine, the soil and climate beino-
particularly adapted to it. It is said that “there are
several districts of sufficient area, and combinino- the
necessary conditions of soil, climate, and aspect, to
produce wine enough for the whole of Europe. ’ ’ The
parent stock of the vine in Now South Wales came
from the Rhino. In 1840, Mr. Busby imported into
New South Wales a valuable collection of plants
from Germany. The Colony grows nearly every
European variety, and the produce of her vineyards
may vie with the most favoured countries of Southern
Europe. The grape flourishes everywhere It is to
be found in every garden, and as an article of diet is
within reach of the poorest in the land. The manu-
facture of wine is gaining ground rapidly, and bids to
become one of the staple industries of the country.
Sericulture.
The colony possesses special advantages for seri-
culture. Every variety of the mulberry grows in
great abundance The silkworm family thrives
well and is free from all the diseases which attack
them in the other parts of the world. With regard
to sericulture, Mr. Charles Brady in a letter
addressed to the Colonial Secretary, dated Sydney,
says “ My own personal knowledge and experience
in the treatment of silkworms in New South Wales
and Queensland for several years, justify me in
expressing my conviction that this part of Australia
at any rate, is peculiarly well adapted for the pro-
duction of cocoons. I have devoted myself exclusive-
ly to this pursuit, in all its relations, particularly to


experiments and efforts to take advantage of our
brilliant atmosphere, and of various food grown in
this climate, to introduce and breed superior races
of silkworms, and especially to free them from the
dire disease which now for so many years has all but
destroyed an industry yielding annually more than
thirty millions of pounds sterling to the present
cultivators of Southern Europe. My experiences
have heen most conclusive and satisfactory, and it
is proved that the importance of our proceedings
here is not unappreciated in England by persons
capable of forming an estimate of their value.
I am well aware that the public mind is prepossessed
with the idea that the growth of silk in Australia
must prove unremunerativc on account of the high
relative price of labour in the Colonies; but I have
never met with even one person who had investigated
the subject, or qualified himself in any way to form
an opinion, who held this idea; in fact, there not
only is nothing to prevent silk being raised as
cheaply in Australia as in France or Italy, but there
is very good reason to believe that, favoured as we
are by climate and cheap land, we may be in a
position to undersell any country in Europe.”
Mining.
New South Wales is rich in minerals, the princi-
pal of which are gold, tin, copper, and iron. Gold,
the principal of all the minerals, was first discovered
in New South Wales and the first actual search for
the precious metal was commenced in 1851. It was
ascertained that the country drained by the Macquarie,
the Turon, the Abercrombie, and the Meroo, and more
recently that watered by the Lachlan, the Darling,
the Murrumbidgce, the Cudgegong, the Shoalhaven
and the Clarence, was all auriferous.
The yield of gold has considerably fallen of late
years, and for 1879 the return was smaller than that
of any year since its discovery, but the last two
years exhibit a marked improvment, and with every
prospect of further increasing. Gold is found in
numerous parts; the fields where the most active
operations are being carried on at the present time
being in the Bathurst District—Bathurst, Trunkey,
Tuena, Carcoar, Rockley, Orange, and Mitchell’s
Creek and Mount McDonald ; Tambaroora and Turon
District—Hill End, Sofala, and Ironbarks ; Mudgee
District Gulgong, Hargreaves, Wellington, and
Windeyer ; Lachlan District—Forbes, Parkes, Gren-
fell, Young, and Temora; Southern District—
Araluen, Goulburn, Braidwood, Shoalhaven, Berma-
gui, Major’s Creek, Nerrigundah and Moruya;
Tumut and Adelong District Adelong, Tumut,
Tumberumba, Cooraa, and Kiandra ; Peel and Uralla
District — Armidalo, Bingera, Nundle, Barraba,
Rocky River, Tamworth and Walcha ; New England
and Clarence District—Boorook, Dalmorton, and
Solferino : Albert District —Mount Browne. In all
there are 29 proclaim gold fields in the south, 38 in
the west, and 7 in the north, the estimated approxi-
mate auriferous area in the Colony being 13,650
square miles. The total yield of gold since the
commencement of systematicgold mining to December
31, 1881, has been 9,225,179*51 ounces, valued at
£34,343,857 4s. 2d.
“Therichest of the Gold Fields arc on the great
dividing range. It will be seen that there is hardly
a district in the Colony that has not been invaded by
the digger and made to conti ibute !;o the gold curren-
cy of the world. Gold has been found in the gizzards
of fowls, and picked up in the streets of Bathurst.
It has been brought up from the bottom of the sea,
off Port Marquarie, by the sounding line of 11. M. S.
Herald; it is distributed amongst the sands of the
Shoalhaven shore, and it glitters among the pebbles
which are strewn along the beach at the Richmond, so
that gold may be said to gild our whole Pacific Coast,
and, it is the opinion of men hest informed on the
subject, that there are vast treasures of th( previous
metal in the alluvial lands along the remote western
boundary of the Colony yet untouched.”
The Alluvial gold fields commonly occur along the
beds of rivers, where the gold washed down from the
hills is deposited. The auriferous soil is frequently
found in the bends ur beds of a watercourse when the
gold has settled. The existence of gold in the rock
has long been known to miners, and yet nearly every
discovery of such has been the result of accident.
Hawkin’s Hill has been found to be reticulated with
auriferous quartz veins and is known by the name of
the “Golden Mountains.” It is the centre of a
number of gold bearing quartz reefs. The Royal
Commission reporting on O’Brien’s Reef at Glenfell
says:
“ O’Brien’s Reef, at Grenfell, was to all appearance
on the surface, some five years ago, much the same
as the dozens of reefs that are to be passed over in a
day’s ride in most of the Southern and Western
Districts. No indications of its auriferous character
appeared to exist to the eye of the ordinary traveller,
or even to the practical miner. A shepherd in the
employ of a squatter in the neighbourhood, in an
idle moment broke some pieces of the stone, and saw
a small speck of gold in them. He and some four or
five miners opened up the reef in the latter end of
1866, taking up as a claim six men’s ground, or 180
feet. From that time to the present, the claimholders
have raised and crushed 14,573 tons of stone, which
have yielded 16,481 ounces of gold, or at the rate of
1 oz. 3 dwts. to the ton. The cost of raising and
crushing thestone, including all expenses, is estimated
by the shareholders at about 20s. per ton. The value
of the gold produced would be about £60,000, and
thus the profits on this one small claim in five years
would be, in round numbers, £45,000. But this was
not all that resulted from the accidental circumstance
of the discovery of a small speck of gold in a by no
means very promising looking reef, by the shepherd.
Other reefs were tested adjoining the one we have
spoken of, and indeed the discovery and working of
the Emu Creek Gold Field took place.”
The richest mines yet opened are those known as
Krohmann’s and Peyers and Holterman’s. On five
or six occasions gold has been blasted out of the rock
by a hundredweight at a time.
The following account of gold mining and miners,
and a miner’s life by Mr. Charles Robinson, may
prove interesting.
The Miner in Mew South Wales.
TJntravelled dwellers in other lands are perhaps
not prepared to hear that the gold miner in Austra-
lia is not a ruffian armed with bowie knife and
revolver, but as pcacahle, well-disposed, and indus-
trious as the average run of men in the oldest settled
communities in the -world. lie is far above the agri-
cultural labourer of Europe in the scale of intelli-
gence, for his wits are sharpened by travel, and his
life produces a stalwart form, and a manly self-
reliant character. He is addicted to reading news-
papers, and his principal failings are a fondness for
the pipe, and a propensity to lecture Members of
Parliament. A raining community, for the first few
months of its existence, has not a very prepossessing
appearance. Mounds of earth and masses of build-
ing material are strewn about, and the huts and
tents of the miners are of the roughest description.
An orderly township, however, is quickly established %


with stores in which every commodity can be bomght
at reasonable rates. Side by side with theses are
Public Schools, commodious, well-built, and wvell-
vcntilaled, whose walls are hung with map* and
pictures, and which arc furnished in a style equial if
not superior to any of the common schools of (Great
Britain. Almost simultaneously with the sclhools
come the churches, and these are commonly tbuilt
after models to be found in the towns and villagces all
over England.
All the great gold fields of the west are withimtwo
days’ journey of the capital, and there is not a gold
field or mining settlement to be found in all the lland,
which, however remote, cannot be reached ifrom
Sydney, either by railway, steam-ship, or mail-
coach, in less than a week. Twenty years ago tthere
were neither roads nor bridges worthy of the mime,
and the man who penetrated the trackless wilds o£f the
Australian forest, stood a fair chance of being drowned
in the rivers, or of being hopelessly lost in the hush.
If he reached his destination, he found that the piriccs
of the provisions of all kinds were enormously high,
and perhaps beyond the power of his purse to obttain.
Now, however, gold mining is one of the setttlod
industries of the country. The miner can liwe as
cheaply on the gold fields as the artisan in the (city,
and his life and his property arc as secure as tthey
could be in the most orderly township of Britain.
During the last two years there have been migra-
tions of population to the extent of from eight to
twenty thousand sculs attracted from all parfcs of
Australia, from New Zealand and other counltiies
beyond the sea, to our gold fields in the west, and
our tin mines in the north, and yet not a single
instance of disorder has occurred. It is seldom ithat
more than one or two constables are stationed evem on
the largest fields (although by means of the telegiraph
a force could be concentrated at any point wiithin
a few hours); the new comers are perfect stramgers
one to the other, and yet, such is the respect of: the
people for constituted authority, and their regard,
each for the rights of others, that no serious distuirb-
aace is ever apprehended.
No special skill beyond that which any one ’who
can handle a pick and shovel will quickly acquire is
requisite to enable a man to become a gold digger;
and all the implements required can either be miade
by the man himself or bought for a few poumds.
The regulations of the Government arc conceived in
the most liberal spirit, and while they protect the
miner to the fullest possible extent, they at the s«imc
time insure the freest scope to his industry. 'The
gold in the soil is, of course, the property of the
Crown ; and before any man can take it he must: get
what is called a “ miner’s right.” This authority
to dig or mine for gold is given to all who apply 7 for
it. It costs ten shillings a year, and entitles its pos-
sessor to take up ground upon any gold field to the
extent of from 60 feet by 60 feet to 114 feet by 114
feet, according to the class of mining pursued uipon
the particular field. If a man wants to opem a
quartz mine he can take up fifty feet along the line
of reef, with a breadth of 100 yards on each side.
His miner’s right also entitles him to occupy half an
acre of land for his dwelling upon any proclaimed
gold field, and to vote for the election of a Membor of
Parliament. All these privileges any man may emjoy
in New South Wales for 10s. a year—the price oof a
day’s work. But the miner is not restricted to <one
claim ; he can take up a hundred if he likes, by viirtue
of his right; but then he must keep men at work ujpon
them, and every man he so employs must also hiave
the “right.” This is not all. The miner can ttakc
up sluicing claims to the extent of ten acres; andl if
this be too circumscribed an area, he may by the
payment of £1 per acre per annum take out a lease
of alluvial or quartz ground for any number of acres
not exceeding twenty-five in one block, (and as many
twenty-five acre blocks as he pleases), or of river
beds to the extent of 1,000 yards, on payment of a
yearly rental of £1 for every 100 yards so taken up.
To prevent monopoly, however, and to protect the
interests of the miners as a body as well as of tho
State, the regulations provide that the miner shal.
forfeit his claim or his lease if he fail to work it
There is an export duty on gold of Is. 3d. per oz.
Persevering industry is the great essential to suc-
cess ; but the more sound sense is brought to bear
upon the pursuit the greater will be the reward.
The prospects of the digger wore never brighter
than at present. He is his own master, and ho
enjoys an amount of robust health, freedom, and
sturdy independence such as falls to the lot of few
manual labourers in other lands. He has in New
South Wales the certainty of earning a good liveli-
hood, with the chance of making a fortune. As for
the quartz miner his position is this : He works eight
hours a day for five days a week, and four hours on
Saturday. He is paid £2 10s. to £3 a week ; and if
at that rate he thinks ho is not earning enough,
why, then, all he has to do is to mark out a claim
for himself and begin work on his own account.
Some of the mines arc now worth two or throe
hundred thousand pounds, and were a few years ago
taken up by one or two poor men in virtue of their
miners’ rights.
This remark applies to those claims which have
been mentioned in this chapter; and one or two
other instances by way of illustration may suffice.
“ J.H., a native of Sydney, went to Tambaroora a
few years since, and had only £5 in his pocket. On
his arrival he worked on the several reefs of the
district with varied success, sometimes almost beaten
but never desparing. When fortune failed him as a
principal he turned to again as a miner, and by his
steady conduct and regular habits could always
manage to put by a few pounds, with which once
more to make a fresh start on his own account. By
the advice and pecuniary help of a friend he bought
half a claim, then known as the “A 1.” For
eighteen months before the claim had been worked
with no good result, but after eight months more of
continuous labour the gold was struck. When down
the shaft one night he picked up a capful of quartz
worth £2O, and that insignificant sum was tho pre-
cursor of enormous yields. In less than two months
from that time, J.II. and his mate cleared more than
£B,OOO, and long after that the mine continued to
yield them quarterly dividends of £5,000 per man.
J.H. retired from actual work, and sold his half of
the mine for £12,000 ; but the buyer was unable to
complete the purchase, and the claim was with-
drawn. The very next crushing yielded a clear
dividend of £lO,OOO, and the next two gave a clear
profit of £7OOO each. Once more the claim was
offered, and was quickly bought up by the public for
£33,000, the amount being subscribed in £1 shares.
At the time of writing this, the shares are at a
premium of 11/-, and are expected soon to bo worth
£2 apiece. J.H. has acquired considerable influence
in the localities where he has lived, and, as a tem-
perance reformer, has induced many hundreds of the
digging population to become total abstainers. He
now resides in an elegant mansion overlooking one of
the picturesque bays of Sydney Harbour, and repre-
sents an important constituency in the Parliament
of the Country,” J.P. is another miner of similar
stamp, who has not been less successful. Tho


compiler of this pamphlet visited the mine which
hears his name, and in a description of the
workings furnished to one of the metropolitan
journals, gave the following information which he
derived from the manager : —“ The mine consists of
eight men’s ground, and has a frontage of 122 feet
G inches along the lino of reef, with a depth of 300
yards. It was taken up in 1866, and the workings
date from early in the next year, the first crushing
being had some thirteen months later. About twelve
months ago, one of the 5 shares into which the
claim was then divided sold for £4,000, or at the
rate of £20,000 for the whole. A few weeks since,
however, the claim passed into the hands of the
present Company for £160,000. £40,000 was taken
out of the claim last year, and £30,000 has already
been realized this year. One crushing, the proceeds
of the first eight weeks’ work in this year, yielded
7,103 ounces of gold from 268J tens of quartz, giv-
ing a dividend of £4,800 on each of the five shares
then held, after paying working expenses. Thirty-
eight men are employed in this claim, working in
day and night shifts.” J.P., who was, and perhaps
still is, one of the largest owners in the mine, is now a
resident in one of the suburbs of the capital; and he
bids fair to achieve a reputation as a philanthropist
more enduring than that which ho has acquired as a
gold miner.
Copper.
The number of copperlodesknown are very large;
the richest copper mines opened are in the vicinity of
Bathurst, Orange, and Burke in the west, and Goul-
burn in the South. Monaroand Shoalhaven country
is rich in copper ore, and companies have been formed
to work them. The Rev. W. B. Clarke says :
“That copper and tin appear to bo as abundant
metals here as in Cornwall. Copper has been made
known in great abundance within the last year in
the far western interior, which was generally con-
sidered to be a flat uninteresting desert between the
Lachlan, Bogan, and Darling. Coba, about 90
miles S.E. of Fort Bourke, is now a mining district;
and having examined them, I can speak favourably
of the value of its ores. Some gold has been detected
in another quarter nearer the Darling, and iron, which
also occurs at Coba, is found on the New Year’s
Range, S.E. of the junction of the Bogan. Copper
is expected also from that Range. The character of
of that then waste country given by Sir T. L. Mit-
chell —“ low, bare ridges, scanty vegetation, water
very scarce, and vast level plains”—will shortly
deserve to be exchanged for one of a most valuable
kind. Recently copper lodes have been taken up
near the head of the Bogan, and I have been impres-
sed with the great value of the whole area between
Molong, Croker’s Range, and the head of the Bogan
River. Similarly we may notice the development of
copper to the south of Bathurst, in the Great Cow
Flat mine. In Manaroo, too, there has been found
copper alloyed with antimony ; and I have a speci-
men from near Bathurst, in which no less than
eighteen ores and other minerals are combined to-
gether.”
Tin.
The discovery of tin caused almost as much ex-
citement as the discovery of gold. Its discovery was
foretold by the Rev. W. B. Clarke many } T ears pre-
vious. The principal centres of this industry in the
north are Inverell, Glen Innes, and from Tenterfield
right up to the Queensland border. The lodes bear
Cornwall characteristics and it will take many years
to work out the deposits of tin. The yield from the
Australian tin mines is already more than half of all
the other mines in the world. The approximate ex-
tent of the stanniferous area is 8,500 square miles,
and about 22,000 persons are employed in its
working.
The following remarks on the occurrence of tin in
New South Wales, from the pen of the Rev. W. 15.
Clarke, will probably bo read with interest:
The stream tin must, of course, be quarternary or re-
cent in its present position. Tin stone has been found
loose in the bed of the Shoalhaven, but the actual
lode has never been discovered. In several other
localities tin is known to me as having been found,
either as stream tin, or wood tin, in the ordinary
gold drifts with other loose minerals—indications, as
I consider such instances, of future discoveries in
parts of the Colony not yet searched. The great
granate masses in this Colony are not, probably, all
so richly endowed as some particular spots which
are now found so prolific; but, having seen the
greater part of them, I am impressed with the opin-
ion that for centuries to come the industry no.v
commenced will continue to occupy a prominent
position among the producers of Colonial wealth,
just as the mines of Tcnasserim, Merghui, and
Malacca have not decreased in value since the com-
mencement of their working. In Malacca manj of
the lodes arc horizontal. The average produce of
the above-named mines is from 60 to 80 per cent.,
and its value is reckoned at nearly 4-J millions per
annum.
Ifi’Olß.
Iron ores arc widely disseminated throughout the
colony, the principal beds being Nematite.
Professor Liversidge speaking of the deposits of iron
ore at Wallerawong, says:—“ They contain two
varieties of iron—magnetite, ortho magnetic oxide
of iron, and the brown luvmatite or gocthite—the
hydrated oxide; then in addition to these there arc
the deposits of the so-called clay bands which are
interstratified with the coal measures. These clay
bands are not what are usually known as clay iron
ores in England. They are brown haematites, var-
limonite, while the English clay iron ores are impure
carbonates of iron, which seldom contain much more
than 30 per cent, of metallic iron, against some 50
per cent, contained by the haematites. A highly
ferruginous garnet accompanies the veins of magne-
tite ; this garnet is very rich in iron, and it will
probably be found advantageous to smelt it with the
other ores, not only on account of the largo per-
centage of metal which it contains, but also on
account of the increased fluidity it would impart to
the slag.” At Corcoar and Blayncy, west from
Sydney, there are deposits at the back of copper
lodes, of which Mr. O. S. Wilkinson, the Govern-
ment Geologist reports,—“ The apparent quantity of
iron is immense.”
In a paper read before the Engineering Association
at Sydney, last year, Mr. Croll, a gentleman who
had paid considerable attention to the subject,
remarked :
The iron ore which has been wrought has been
found to be from 20 to 25 per cent, richer than the
iron ore of Great Britain. We have only one iron-
works in the Colony ; and, I am sorry to say that
up to the present time is has been commercially
unsuccessful. But although this company has been
surrounded by a number of difficulties which arc sure
to beset a new enterprise in a young colony, they
have done sufficient to show that our Colonial iron
cannot be surpassed by any iron in the world. They
produced iron which was sent home to England,
and found to be of superior quality, and suitable


for making into a superior kind of steel. About
seven years ago I had an opportunity of assisting to
test the cohesive strength of our wrought iron in
comparison with other iron generally used. The
testing was done by getting a number of pieces of
the different kinds of iron made with a ring on each
end, and a short part in the middle, made in thickness
to a quarter of an inch gauge. It was then suspen-
ded, and weights were applied until it broke. And
it was found that it stood from 50 to 100 lbs. more
than different iron used, such as BBH, and several
others; and it was only equalled by the Lowmore
iron ; and if there was an}' difference the Fitzroy
iron was the strongest. At the same time I also saw
several experiments tried with the cast-iron bars of
about 2 feet long, 1J by J inch thick. These bars
were suspended by each end, and weight applied
.. ~ —o - *- i xr
to the middle until they broke; and by a line being
stretched from end to end it was found that it bent
over an inch before it broke. This shows the
toughness and flexibility of the Colonial cast iron. It
~ —n —- * - - -
is to be regretted that the only iron ore that has been
tried has been the Fitzroy ore, although good samples
have been found along the coast. A few months ago
I was at Orange, and I got a piece of iron ore, the
specific gravity of which shows that it is nearly all
Coal.
Coal is one of the most abundant and valuable
minerals in New South Wales. For hundreds of
miles the coal districts may said to be one vast coal
field. The coal is of a very superior quality and is
well adapted for steam, gas and household purposes,
and finds also a ready sale in San Francisco, China,
and other Eastern ports.
The principal collieries are situated 10 miles of New-
castle and 50 from Sydney. But valuable mines are
also being worked near Wollongt ng. At Strout there
is a seam 30 feet thick. Another seam near Brixton
on the northern line of railway is 22 feet thick.
The late Mr. Wm. Keene, Examiner of Coal Fields,
in a report to tho Government, says: “I have ex-
a mined seams more than 700 miles to the north of
Newcastle, belonging to the same deposits as we are
working in the Hunter, covered and underlaid by the
same fossil flora and fauna ; and we may without
boasting claim to rank with the most extensive coal
fields in the world, and locomotive power is use! at
all the Hunter River mines, and, with the shipping
facilities which exist at Newcastle at the present
time, we are able to load 40,000 tons of coal per week.
The means of shipment can of course be indefinitely
increased.”
Silver and liead
There are silver and lead mines near Yass, in the
Southern Districts (the ore from which has been sent
to England to be separated), and near Scone, on the
Hunter There are also deposits of silver ore at
Broulec, near Moruya. Cinnabar is found in the
Mudgee district, and antimony 7 ores have been work-
Ed in the Clarence district.
Precious Stones.
The gems of New South Wales form a varied
found atKiandra. Other specimens, well verified, have
come from the northern portion of the tin districts.
The spinelle ruby has also been found, with very
fine specimens of the Oriental sapphire, and zircons,
in the Abercrombie flanges. The sapphires arc dark
in colour, some of them being beautifully asteriated.
The zircons from this quarter possess a peculiarly
rich colour, between a light port wine and a Ceylon
ruby. Some beautiful specimens of the rare oriental
emerald, the hardest stone known except the diamond
have also been found on the Cudgegong River. The
opal has been found in several places amongst volcanic
tufa in the Abercrombie Ranges. Thirty miles from
Carcoar some very fine specimens of thenoble opalhave
been procured. Diamonds have been discovered in
several widely separated localities, viz. : the Cudge-
gong River, near Mudgee ; Macquarie River, near
Wellington ; Hill End ; Bingera ; Cope’s Creek ;
Bathurst; Abercrombie and Shoalhaven Rivers, &c.
They occur in the Tertiary drifts and river gravels.
Professor Liveridge states that at least 10,000
diamonds have been found ; the largest weighed 16 *2
grains or about 6f carats. It is believed that with
proper appliances for saving diamonds the drifts
might be profitably worked, especially on the Cudge-
gong River and at Bingera.

Manufacturing Industries.
Iron Trades.
Within the last few years great advances have
been made in manufacturing industries. The Col-
ony has now a Colonial and Foreign trade of
upwards of £15,000,000 a year. In the foremost
rank of art'zans stand the workers in metal who
number thousands. The largest engineeering estab-
lishments are reported in Sydney. The works of
the Australasian Steam Navigation Company, and
other large firms give constantly increasing work.
“ Having regard to the extent of the mercantile
marine, it must be obvious that there is constant
work for a very large number of engineers and
machinists upon repairing werk alone, and when to
this is added, the large demand which has sprung up
for iron work in connection with flour mills, quartz-
crushing mills, sheep washing and stone breaking
apparatus, bridges and machinery of all descriptions
—it is clear that this branch of industry, for which
the Colony facilities, is destined to
assume vast proportions.”
Sin citing’ Works.
The smelting -works of New South Wales,
which are now becoming of great importance, are
principally in the neighbourhood of the coal fields.
The Hunter's River Company at Waratah alone
comprises twenty-one furnaces, seventeen of which
are in full work, so that nearly all the processes of
copper-smelting and refining were witnessed. About
20,000 tons of what is termed third-class ore is
smelted at these works every year. The stuff is
brought up Irom Wallaroo, South Australia. The
vessels engaged in transporting the ore take cargoes
of coal from Newcastle to South Australia, for the
purpose of smelting the best of the ore at tire mines,
and on their return journey they bring up the poor
ore, which it would he too expensive to smelt with
imported coal at Wallaroo. Four new furnaces
have been lately erected, and will soon be at work.
The quantity of ore operated upon will then, it is
expected, amount to about 25,000 or 30,000 tons
every year. There are now about 120 men engaged
at the works. The production of pure copper aver-
ages about 1,800 or 2,000 Uns a year, and the cos-
sumption of coal in the furnaces about 26,001 tons.
Ship and House Building.
All those industries in which timber is used must
flourish in New South Wales, for there is no country
in the world where the trees are so magnificent, of
such varied species, and so specially adapted by the
hardness and durability of their wood for ship build-
ing and house building, and also carriage building.
Of the 10,000 forest trees which grow in all parts of
the world, 7,000 grow luxuriantly in New South
Wales.
licenses to cut timber (£1 a year for hardwood
and £3 for cedar), are granted to all who apply for
them, “ so that the Government practically makes a
gift of its forests to the timber using industries of
the Colon}’.”
Slone and flartli.
The Colony is well off as regards building material,
of all kinds. Freestone may bo hewn out of the
quarries around Sydney of any size. The key-stone
of one of the arches in the now General Post Offices
laid by H.R.11. the Duke of Edinburgh, weighed
nearly 30 tons. In the same building there are
nearly 50 highly polished columns of grey granite,
from the Moruya quarries. The supply of every
description of stone requisite for building houses,
docks, &c., is unlimited and easily accessible.
Marble quarries, limestone, and all sorts of clav,
excepting kaolin, are found; and the manufacture
of bricks, encaustic tiles, drain pipes, and other des-
criptions of pottery is carried on by the aid of otearn-
driven machinery.
XiCather, tic.
The manufacture and workmg-up of leather gives
employment to 5,200 men. Some of the boot and
shoe factories of Sydney employ between throe and
four hundred hands, who are engaged chiefly in
manufacture of strong boots, for which there is
great demand in the Colony, and for export to New
Zealand and Queensland. Women’s and children’s
boots, and a good deal of light harness, are still im-
ported. Our manufacturers of leather, boots, &e.,
have provided themselves with the best machinery
from England ; and until the Customs duty was in-
creased from ten to twenty per cent, ad valorem , in
Victoria, they were exporting largely to that Colony.
The growth of manufactures in leather during the
past decade is surprising, as only a few years ago
were they found worthy of a place in the Statistical
Register. In 1871 there wore thirty-seven manufac-
tories, and the returns just published for 1880 show
a total of seventy-five establishments, employing not
less than six hands each.
Woollen Cloths.
The Colony possesses a special advantage for the
production of fine wool; and for some years past
woollen cloths of a rough description have been
made here. The more attractive patterns and finish
of English textures, however, give them almost
complete command of the market. But the produce
of Colonial looms has greatly improved within the
last few years by the importation of better ma-
chinery. Colonial tweeds being made of wool with-
out any admixture of shoddy, are more durable than
those w’e import, and are intrinsically superior.
The manufacture of woollens is one of the oldest
of the industries of the Colony. Excellent machinery
is employed. The production last year was 203, 10q


yards from eight woollen cloth manufactories, em-
ploying- 214 hands. In 1880 the returns in the
metropolitan district were not complete, so that no
comparison can he made with that year and the first
year of the decade.
Hothiiig Factories.
The principal clothing factories of the Colony
have sprung up during the last decade. In 1867
not one appears in the returns ; ia 1871 there were
eleven, and in 1880 the total increased to forty-
eight, employing 1,580 hands. Considering that
not a penny of Customs’ duty is levied on soft goods
this progress is remarkable. Ever y branch of dressand
bonnet making and millinery is in an advanced state
of perfection, and the splendid show-iooms of the
city drapers owe most of their attractions to the
fair Australians, who lire apt imitators of the latest
European fashions.
Merosesse.
The manufacture of kerosene oil from shale, in
which the Colony abounds, is carried on by a large
company known as “ New South Wales Shale and
Oil company,” who own mines in the western
district,and manufacture the oil at worksin Waterloo,
near Sydne} r , which have cost £40,000. Their oil,
known as the “Comet” brand, is certified by
analysts to be equal in quality and superior in safety
to the best Ameiican.
The Kerosene Works at Joadja Creek are about 16
miles from the Mittagong Kailway Station on the
Southern lino. The operations consist of shale-min-
ing, extracting [oil from the shale and refining
it, timber-sawing, erecting buildings, and all the
mechanical operations necessary to carry on the
works. Some fifty men are engaged in winning 850
tons of shale or mineral per week, which is either
exported or treated for oil extraction. The lower
division of the seam is 10 to 14 inches thick, and the
upper one 7to 10 inches thick. The shale obtained
from the lower division, being most valuable, is
exported; it contains about three-fifths of the whole
quantity.
Cordials.
There were 142 establishments fer making cordials
&c., in 1881, against 92 in 1871. Two well-known
English firms have opened branch manufactories in
the Colony, and many long-established colonial
manufacturers have largely increased their plant
for making every kind of summer drinks.
Wool-wasbing.
Woolwashing works rose from 35 in 1871 to 60 in
1880. The attention now being given to preparing
wool for European buyers must tend to increase the
already high reputation of the fleeces of the Colony.
JPa per.
There are two paper mills at Liverpool. At the
Sydney International Exhibition good samples of
news-printing and wrapping papers from Williams
and Murray’s establishment were shown.
Clse ist lea I
The large chemical works of Messrs. Elliott
Brothers at Balmain find ample employment in
supplying the sulphuric and other acids required by
the manufacturers of the Colony.
Frozen Meat Trade.
r i he late Mr. T. S. Mort, was the first who perfec-
ted inventions for the preservation of food by freezing-
processes. He spent a lifetime and a fortune in the
successful fruition of his plans, but he did not live
long enough to reap the reward of his labours. The
Chief Inspector of stock, in his last report says:
“The arrival in London of the cargoes of the
‘ Strathleven’ and ‘ Protos’ in first-rate marketable
condition, and the regular conveyance of frozen meat
between London and Australia on several of the Orient
steamers for the passengers’ use, has completely set
at rest the question as to whether it is practicable to
convey meat in prime condition from Australia to
London Not only is this the case, but the fact that
a payable price can be obtained is also established,
and all that is now required is the erection of the
necessary machinery in the Colony for preparing the
meat for shipment, and a regular supply of vessels
properly fitted up to convey it to London.” These
successful processes for freezing meat will enrich the
stockowners of this Colony, as those for the transport
of chilled meat have done for America, and while
adding to the prosperity of the Colony, will furnish
another means of contributing to the warts of older
and more populous countries. Mr. A. Clare, the chef
de cuisine of the steamer “ Orient,” in a recent letter
to the London Times , expressed the following favour-
able opinion on the quality of Australian frozen
meat:—
“ At the p>resent time, when the Australian frozen
meat question seems to be attracting public attention,
I trust a few remarks on the subject by one who has
had practical experience in the cooking and serving it
for three voyages out and home from the Colonies on
board the steamship ‘Orient,’ and also in various
parts of Canada, where meat is kepit in a similar
condition all the winter, may not be considered out
of place and not unworthy a corner of your papier.
In the first pilace, it is said there is a strong objection
to its dark colour as compared with English meat,
and this is put down to the ‘freezing process.’ A
greater error does not exist. This is explained as
follows:—xkthome cattle are prepared for the butcher
or market up to three or four years old, rarely up to
five as the cost of food, attendance, pasturage, &c.,
is so high in England that it docs not pay the grazier
to keep thorn longer. Veal up to seven or perhaps
eight months old should be white ; at one year the
flesh becomes pink ; at two years light red—if cooked
and carved at this period (two years) the moat cuts
out nearly white ; at three years full red, and after
that it gradually grows darker year by year. Now-
in Australia the cost of natural feeding is next to
nothing, for the stock roam nearly wild over large
tracts of splendid pasturage. But when running
this way, finding their own food, it is found that they
do not ‘ put on flesh’ as quickly as home or stall-fed
cattle ; therefore, they are allowed to live on up to
seven or eight years, when they have become less
wild and have made themselves fit for market at any
time, and are actually driven from their pasturage to
the slaughter pens without any artificial preparation.
This accounts for the cheapness of meat, and proves
that it is age, and age only, that makes the meat of
a dark colour, and not the freezing, as is generally
supposed. In the second place, it is said that the
meat loses its succulence or juiciness by freezing, or
rather by the thawing after. This is also an error
likely to toll against the ready sale of the meat. If
no artificial means are employed to thaw it, such as
steeping it in hot or cold water, or hanging it in a
hot kitchen or closet, or in some way hastening on
the thawing, it is impossible for it to lose as stated.
The meat should be hung up in the larder or meat-
safe, or in any pdace where the heat is not above the
outside temperature, and let it hang until perfectly
thawed out. In fact the thawing cannot be carried
out too slowly, as the colder the temperature the les 9


likely to waste. By probing with a skewer it can
easily be ascertained if it is completely thawed. The
meat when required for use should be wiped dry and
put to roast before a brisk fire, well basted, and
slightly undercooked. For boiling -boil up sharply
for five minutes, then pull back and gently simmer
till cocked. In the third place some (who arc not in
favour of the movement) have said the meat is very
coarse and underbred. This is error the third with-
out doubt. The sheep are for the most part by the
best blackfaced Shropshire Downs and Border Leices-
tershire rams with merino ewes—a hardier, cleaner-
feeding, or better flesh-forming class does not exist.
The beef is of the best blood of England and Scotland,
the finest and purest strains money can buy, as can
be confirmed by any who hove inspected the meat
just brought home as cargo by the * Orient’ —nearly
4,000 sheep of splendid quality and just the right
weight to suit the British consumer (from 70lbs. to
851bs. each), also a large quantity of first-class beef,
the whole together equal to anything that can be
procured in London or elsewhere as a market lot,
and if that does not convince them, I will engage to
put a dinner on the table from Australian beef and
mutton either in the plainest or most recherche form
side by side with the beef and mutton of any other
country, and the greatest judges of meat will not be
able to toll the difference (if any exist) either in
appearance or flavour.”
Mr. Mulhall in his “ Balance Sheet of the World”
estimates a yearly supply of a million tons of meat
from Australian cattle, which would feed twenty
million inhabitants or seven times the present popula-
tion of the Colonics. They could therefore afford to
export 2,000 tons of meat per annum.
Fisheries.
The rivers and coast of New South Wales abound
with fish, ard the rocky ledccs of all its bays and
estuaries form natural oyster beds thousands of miles
in length. Sydney and the chief towns of the Colony
arc plentifully supplied with shell and other fish at
all seasons of the year. Some attention is now being
paid to the protection and development of our oyster
fisheries, and they may ultimately become a large
industry. At present our exports are confined to the
neighbouring Colonics.
There is a splendid opening for deep sea fisheries,
for in that direction nothing is attempted beyond the
supply of the local market. “New South Wales,”
says Mr. A. Oliver, “ presents to the eye a QOftgtrliflC
of some 600 milei in length, situated in a zone of tem-
perature, and endowed with marine and topographical
conditions admirably adapted as a habitat fer the
many families of edible fishes with which Nature has
endowed us. From north to south the coast abounds
with spawning as well as feeding grounds. A score
of rivers, with wide and well protected embouchures,
and a thousand inlets and indentations of every size
and form, from the vast expanse of Jervis or Broken
Bay to the miniature boat-harbour of Terrigal, or
the spacious crescent of Curranulla, or Providence
Bight, offer all the requirements of sea-bottom for
food and protection for the young fry necessary to
our southern fish in their various stages of growth.”
Demand for Labour in New South
Wales.
\Extract from 1 Sydney Morning Herald July sth,
1882.]
Emigration to New South Wales. —Yesterday
was the day appointed for the hiring out of the
immigrants lately arrived by the vessel “Samuel
Plimsoll.” The total number of passengers who
arrived by that ship was 407—viz., 64 married
couples, 115 unmarried men, 38 unmarried
women, and 124 children under twelve years
of age. Of the 38 unmarried women all bat
four went to friends in the country. Yester-
day morning quite a crowd of ladies and a few gentle-
men assembled at twelve o’clock in the Immigrant’s
Home, Macquair Street, expecting that there would
be many of the immigrants anxious to go to service,
the ladies on their part being no less anxious to secure,
if possible, what appears to be in this colony as rare
a treasure as the fabled “roc’s egg”—a good maid
servant. For the four women waiting engagement
there was no less than 103 applicants, and they wero
consequently speedily secured. The desire to obtain the
services of the married couples and unmarried men.
was scarcely less great. The variety cf occupations
which the men had filled was very great. Gardeners,
agricultural labourers, and milkers wore in demand,
and tradesmen, such as carpenters and joiners, wero
no less sought after. The wages offered were good
all round, three men at least refusing C4O per annum,
with keep and lodging, whilst tie general rate of
wage offered and accepted was from £3O to £4O, with
board and lodging, for unmarried men, and £72 Bs. per
annum with board and lodging, for married couples. A
number of the tradesmen went into the city, and on
returning to the ship, stated that they had obtained
situations, carpenters at once receiving 11s, a day.
Almost without exception the immigrants wero healthy
industrious-looking people, but we wore informed
that from 36 to 40 of the married and unmarried
men showed to the immigration officer drafts which
they had in their possession upon banks in the colony
for sums of money varying from £5 to £lO, good
testimony that the Agent-General had been careful
in his selection of the people ho sent out to make
their future home in our midst.
Abstract of Speech hy Sir ilerculcs
Robinson.
“ I know of no sight more calculated to impress an
Englishman with feelings of pride and thankfulness,
than to travel through a great new country like this,
and to see on all sides the evidence which it affords
of industrial progress and social improvement,—to
see scattered everywhere thriving bustling townships
and homesteads, where, but a few years since, there
was only the wigwam of the savage,—to see lands,
which, within the memory of the present generation
were unproductive swamps and primeval forests,
covered with flocks and herds and corn, and admin-
istering to the wants and contributing to tho happi-
ness of hundreds of thousands of the human race, —
and above all to sec the land inhabited by thriving
communities of citizens, who are striving to attain a
high moral standard, who are enjoying to tho utmost
degree constitutional liberty, and who are proving by
their loyalty and good order how well they appreciate
its blessings. I say that a sight such as this always
makes me feel proud of the genius of my countrymen
for colonisation, and justifies me in looking forward
to the future of this great Country. The resources
of the land are boundless, and thousands upon
thousands of working men, who are often suffering
in the Old Country from want or insufficient means,
would here find an easy and comfortable subsistence.”
Summary of tlie Advantages of New
South Wales as a Home for the
Fmigrant.
BY CHAHLES IiOBINSON.
1. There is ready employment for all classes of
labourers and artisans, at double the wages given to
the same classes of labour in England.


2. The cost of living for the masses of the people
is cheaper here than at Home. The necessaries and
common comforts of life are cheaper. Some of the
luxuries arc dearer ; but fruits of all varieties arc
most abundant and exceedingly cheap. The labour-
ing classes throughout the Colony are as well fed, as
well clothed, and live as comfortably as the middle
classes in England.
3. Capital finds ready investment either in trade,
agriculture, mining, or the public stock, at much
higher rates than in Europe, and with as good
security. Eight per cent, security is deemed a fair
rate in Sydney: in the country, rates run higher.
4. There is an area of nearly 200,000,000 acres of
public lands, two-thirds of which are occupied by
the squatters on short leases, but all of which arc
open to the emigrant to select from, wherever he
pleases, and on terms within reach of the poorest,
and a certain road to wealth, if ho be healthy, pru-
dent, and industrious.
5. The soil and climate are adapted to every
variety of produce, at the least expenditure of labour
and capital; and cultivated with the same skill as at
Home, will yield far better returns.
6. Our mineral resources can be surpassed by no
other Country. The gold deposits arc spread over a
larger area, and are proving richer than anything
hitherto known in the whole history of mining. The
coal deposits arc inexhaustible, and copper, tin,
kerosene shale, and other mineral treasures abound.
7. For merchants and tradesmen no fairer field
than Sydney could be presented. Its position on
the eastern seaboard, with the Southern Islands,
San Francisco, and the whole American Continent,
right opposite,—with a harbour for shipping un-
rivalled in the World, and a vast trade already
established, it cannot fail to secure the chief share
of the commerce of the Pacific.
8. No finer climate can be desired, alike free from
the rigorous cold of England, Canada, and the North-
western States of America, and from the enervating
heat of India and the tropics.
0. In natural scenery, New South Wales can vie
with some of the romantic Countries of Europe.
The wild picturesque scenery of the Blue Mountains,
and the manifold beauty of Port Jack-son, the
glorious landscapes of New England, the Clarence,
Monaro, Illawarra, and other parts, cannot well be
surpassed.
10. Every district is easy of access by river,
road, or railway. The most foimidable barrier,
long thought impassable, has been crossed by a rail-
way, along which passengers and produce are carried
day and night, in carriages as comfortable as any in
Europe. The whole country lies at the feet of the
emigrant, ready to be possessed. For the sum of
32/- you may travel in a few hours to Bathurst, the
capital of the West.
11. All this may he onjoj T cd among a people whose
whole social life is so like Home that it is scarcely
possible for the emigrant to feel like “a stranger
in a strange land.” The language, customs, habits,
laws, literature, education, religion arc all thoroughly
English ; life and property secure, and government
free.
12. Every immigrant, if sober, healthy and in-
dustrious, is wealth to the Colony, and is made
welcome at once—never received with jealousy and
suspicion. All that Australia wants to make her one
of the wealthiest if not the wealthiest of lands, is
population. Everything else she offers, and on the
most generous terms. Farm labourers, miners,
domestic servants, mechanics, and artisans of all
sorts, enterprising capitalists of large means or
small, if they are only temperate, able, and willing
to work, may make sure of improving their con-
dition ly emigrating to New South Wales. In
fact, it matters not what a man has been accustomed
to in the Old World, if he is willing to throw away
dilletanteisrn, take off his coat, turn up his sleeves,
and put his shoulder to the wheel of fortune just as
it may bo presented to him—not the slave of false
pride and miscalled respectability, but mak-
ing the best of such opportunities as may
come across his path—there is prosperity
awaiting him on these shores, a certain com-
petence, and not unlikely an ample fortune.
Here children arc a real blessing. The father’s
brow is never clomded with anxiety at every new
addition to his family, wondering how the little
mouth is to be filled ; unless false notions of gentility
have poisoned his colonial blood, and he is ashamed
to let his children degrade themselves with business.
If he be rich he can afford to indulge that sublime lux-
ury,but he would be a better citizen and patriot if he
would dispense with it. We have land enough and to
spare for many generations ; it will yield nearly every-
thing that has any value in the markets of the
World. Healthy labour is all we ask for; capital,
too, where it is available, and that will smooth the
lot of labour, —but healthy labour is the one great
requisite, and whoever can offer us that is welcome.
To all who are struggling to get on at Home and yet
can hardly keep their heads above the water, and in
their old age must depend upon their children or
their parish, we say, gather together what little
substance you have, bid farewell to your native land,
come out to this Land of Plenty; and, under its
brighter sky, let that same labour of yours, which at
Home cannot save you from the fear of being a
burden to your Country, win for you a fair day’s
wage for a fair day’s work; and an Englishman
still, you need love your fatherland none the less, but
help to preserve her Empire and augment her great-
ness through all future ages.
