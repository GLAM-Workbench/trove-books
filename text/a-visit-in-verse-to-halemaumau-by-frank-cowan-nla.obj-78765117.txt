DEDICATED TO HIS MAJESTY,
KALAKAUA,
KING OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS,
WITH FEELINGS OP PROFOUND RESPECT, BY
THE AUTHOR.
Honolulu, H. 1., April, 1885.




INTRODUCTORY.
Hawaii (pronounced conventionally as if spelled Hah-wye-
ee, with the accent on the second syllable, and signifying
Little Java or Fiery Java) is the most southerly and easterly,
the largest, and the most recently formed of the cluster of
eleven islets in the North Pacific Ocean which constitute the
domain of the kingdom of Hawaii, the Hawaiian (Hah-wye-
ee-an, with the accent on the second syllable, or Hah wye-
yan,) or Sandwich Islands. It is a pile of volcanic mountain
cones, or essentially a vast volcano, which, rising from the
abyss of the Pacific Ocean and attaining an altitude of nearly
14,000 feet above its surface, equals, in altitude above the
bottom of the sea, the highest of the Himalayas above the
level of the valley of the Ganges; and as such, it presents an
exposition of the volcano as a factor in the formation of the
solid earth, which for grandeur and sublimity as a spectacle
and at the same time for completeness and convenience of
study, is Avithout a parallel on the globe.
Kilauea (pronounced as if spelled Kee-low-ay-ah, with a
slight accent on the first syllable and a strong on the third,
and signifying a Big Smoking Pit) is the most persistently
active of the superficial volcanoes of Haw r aii; and as an indi-
vidual, aside from its associates, it is among the largest of the
active volcanoes of the world. It is the fifth and most re-
cently developed of the culminating points of the volcanic


activity of the island, and is situated on its southeastern as-
pect, or strictly in accordance with the formula of the forma-
tive forces of Hawaii and the group to which it belongs, from
the northwest to the southeast, and in accordance with the
intersecting lines of fracture in the crust of the earth as de-
lineated by Mr. William Lowthian Green, assuming that
the globe in cooling from a molten spherical mass has
collapsed into a wavering compromise or uncertain equipoise
between a spheroid and a bexa-tetrahedron ?the constant ac-
tivity of Kilauea attesting it an ultimate, or a terminal point
of earth-formation which, in its relation to the Hawaiian Isl-
ands, may be likened to the purple flower-bud of the banana
in advance of the cluster of its fruit. The rim ot its crater-
pit, compound crater, or calderon, (accented on the first syh
lahle, and signifying a caldera, accented on the second sylla-
ble, or caldron, of the largest size,) is about 4,000 feet above
the level of the sea; the circumference of the same 8.6865
miles, or nearly nine; and the depth from 500 to 1,800 feet,
as the liquid-lava rises and falls in it?at present (28th Feb-
ruary, 1885,) it is supposed to be about 600 feet to the gen-
eral level of the floor of the calderon, and 600 to the level of
the liquid lava in its several active centres, craters, or lakes.
By the walls of the volcano giving way, the gradually
accumulated lava is discharged by a lateral vent every eight
or nine years; and only once in its history, in 1789, has there
been an explosive eruption from the crater-mouth.
Jialemaumuu (pronounced as if spelled Hah-lay-raow-mow,
accented on the first and third syllables, and signifying, liter-
ally, House Everlasting, or figuratively, the Grave, from the
fact that a similar crater in approximately the same place has
been regarded by the Hawaiians from time immemorial as a
fit burial place for the bodies in whole or in part of their
dead, in their worship of Fele?not the house of everlasting
fire or burning, as rendered by some) is the older and the


more active, picturesque, and remarkable in many ways of
the two great craters containing lava in tumultuous ebullition'
at present in the calderon of Ivilauea, and the most interest-
ing of the infinity of phenomena which the volcano presents
?in fine, the centre of the attractions of Hawaii. In its rela-
tion with the volcanoes of the earth at large, it (or Kilauea'
as a whole) is perhaps the least evolved, and may be put at
the foot of the list, with Vesuvius at the head; the one in one
of the four great tetrahedral ocean-areas of depression of the
earth, emitting simple, basic, doleritic and anhydrous, or cos-
mical lavas, (identical mineralogieally with a vast number of
the solid meteorites which from time to time have fallen on
the surface of the earth,) and the other in one of the four
great tetrahedral continental-areas of elevation, em tting
lavas of the most complex character; the one quietly and
steadily active and the other explosively and spasmodically; the
one, according to the conceptions of Mr. Green, (for which may
the volcanic mountain-mass of Hawaii be an eternal monu-
ment!) a resultant at the intersection of the tetrahedral shrink-
age-fractures of the crust of the earth, and the other in the
line of the great telluric twist of the earth on its axis; or,
regarding the earth as a hexa-tetrahedron, in the line of the
shifting of its planes into a macled form of the crystalline
figure. It may be likened to a barometer on a stupendous
scale; for as the liquid mercury rises in the tube of the
barometer responsive to the pressure of the atmosphere upon
the metal contained in the compressible and elastic bulb
at the base of the instrument, so the liquid lava of Halemau-
mau rises in its self-formed cylinder in accordance with the
jiressure upon the molten forms of matter contained in the
shrinking sack, or the flexible frangible crust, of the cooling
collapsing earth. The present cone of the crater called
Halemaumau has been developed since the year 1868. Its
walls rise from eighty to one hundred and fifty feet above the


level of the liquid interior; find albeit of the most chaotic
character, they exhibit an interesting series of concave lines
of stratification, showing their formation to have been made
by successive outpourings and their apparent upheaval
effected in part by an ascending central force, and in part by
lateral (hydrostatic) pressure.
Pele (pronounced as if spelled Fay-lay, accented on the first
syllable, and signifying fire,) is a mental mythic monster of
the Hawaiians, compounded of the phenomena of their grand
volcanic environment and themselves?a malignant and
destructive monster, half volcanic outburst and half savage;
and curiously of the feminine gender, a she-divinity (to use
the phraseology of one of England?s poets,) or a goddess; as
if in recognition of the fact, not beyond the comprehension of
savages, that a woman has the might and means within
herself to be a greater monster of destruction than a man, he
being limited to the past and present, and she having the
range of the past, the present, and the future. She was
supposed to reside, by turns, in the several active volcanoes,
but especially in Kilauea, in Halemaumau; and she was the
recipient of a worship possibly more general among the
Hawaiians than any other of their gods and goddesses?and
which, by no means, has become extinct yet; as the sacrifice
of the Princess Ruth as late as 1881, referred to in the poem,
is a sufficient proof. A complete exposition of Pele, however,
as a historical, religious, and social personage, albeit an ideal
monster, would require, like any of the foregoing subjects, a
volume rather than a paragraph.
For other items, of local or special interest, the fore-
knowledge of which is not essential to an understanding of
the poem, see the notes at the end.


A VISIT IN VERSE
SALEM AITJ M AIII.
I sit upon the good ship?s quarter-deck,
In silent, self-secluded reverie:
A musing barnacle upon the back
Of a Pacific sulphur-bottom whale.
(1 like a simile, especially
When it involves me in a grotesque guise;
As children love to look in wrinkled mirrors
And see themselves as mannikins and monsters.)
Now, noting, haply, in the sky astern,
The sooty albatross, with outspread wings,
Shaped like a scythe or the crescentic moon,
Sweep, swirl, and pirouette, as if it were
The curve of beauty avitied upon
The palette of the painter of the sea;
Now, in the sea abeam, the shadow of
A roving shark?its pointed dorsal fin
Uprising from the rippling surface, like


The Mack-flag of a dreaded pirate-craft
On the horizon heaving into sight;
Anon, ahead, a startled flying-fish,
With glassy wing-like fins, rise from the sea
And wing a gleaming scintillating flight
In the bright sunshine for a moment, then
Sink in the all-concealing ocean, like
A fact that rises from the salt, salt sea
Of common place and flits a fancy in
The sunshine of my musing for a time,
The length of the first kiss of lovelings, then
Sinks in the ocean of oblivion.?
Until, oho! the ship is anchored in
The bay of Hilo, and behold! the isle
Ha-wai-i: a long-buried age and clime,
In miniature, of the revolving earth;
When the first cooling crags of its great mass
Of molten matter, whirling from the sun,
Appeared above the cinders of the sea
Within the fire-freed gases of the air,
And the first forms of vegetable life,
O 7
The lichen, moss, and fern, began to weave
A cincture for the new-horn planet Eve.
Ha-wai-i?Aye, a mimic infant Earth,
? Mewling and puking in the nurse?s arms.?
Well mounted on a sinewy, fresh shod horse,
As sure of foot as a cliff-climbing goat,
I jog along a narrow, rugged path,
Worn in the lava by my predecessors,
And bringing back to mind the wheel-worn rut
Within the lava pavement of Pompeii;
Now, turning to the right to note the flood
That came from mighty Mau-na Lo-a?s* mouth


Four years ago ?a flood of molten lava.
In self-encasing arteries of slag,
Descending slope, ravine, and precipice?
A deluge of destruction pouring down
Resistless, a Niagara of fire!
And staying not, until, approaching Hilo,
Full forty miles from its volcanic source,
The Princess Ruth, of ancient faith, appeared,
And sacrificing raiment, meat and drink
Unto the goddess of her heathen sires,
The dreaded Fe-le?fire personified?
The flood of fire was turned to solid stone!
And so remains, in attestation of
The pow'r of Pe-le and the faith of Ruth,
To all the world unto the end of time,
In black, appalling, overwhelming waves,
Upon the edge of the uninjured town!
But out upon this shaping of the world
To fit our fancies, whims, conceits, and dreams
Till self-deluded, we believe in them
As entities outside our simple selves
And worship them as gods of good and evil;
Instead of shaping our ideas, thoughts,
And fantasies to fit the world of fact?
The entities of our environment
Within the reach and rapture of our senses!
Now, turning to the left to note a fernf
Among the leafy wonders of the isle:
A circle of unbroken, arching fronds,
Full thirty feet from tip to tip* above
A drapery of drooping lifeless leaves
Around the trunk of their supporting tree:
A crown unto the forest chieftain?s head,


And to his face a mummer?s mask as well.
Now, holding a straight course amid a copse
Of such resplendent and luxuriant growth,
1 seem to sit again in a canoe
And drift adown the mighty Amazon,
A speechless wonderer among its palms
Transformed into as vast and varied ferns?
A marvel here, full forty feet in height,
And two in width across its tree-like trunk;!
Another there, the feathers of the Roc
Of Sindbad metamorphosed into fronds !
Anon, within a scrubby wilderness,
in which the horse, the ass, the ox, the sheep,
Ihe goat, the hog, the dog, the cat, and chicken
Have wandered back into their primal state
Of savag?ry before the wit of man
Subordinated them unto his will.
Until, at length, borne over thirty miles
Of lava in unnumbered curious forms?
Swirled, hummocked, pitted, caverned, creased,
dragged, fretted, bulged, rent, fluted, rolled, and
And lifted up some forty hundred feet
o?erlapped
crushed
Above the level of the circling sea,
O 7
I check rny jaded horse upon the brink
Of an abyss a hundred fathoms deep.
And, in circumference, three leagues or more,
The compound calderon of Ki-lan-e-a:
The counterfeit presentment, at my feet,
In planetary objectivity,
Of the volcanic moon, above my head,
In interstellar sheen and mysticism!
Was ever revelation unto man
More wonderful! As if I had, in fact,
The moon beneath a microscopic lens?


Its orb expanded twenty thousand times,
And every pockmark in its seeming face
Enlarged into an isle-engulfing pit;
The silver in the heavens dross on earth,
Black, broken, ragged, jagged furnace-slag!
Aye, looking into Ki-lau-e-a, I
Behold the moon, as Gulliver, among
The Brobdingnags, the charms of Glumdalclitch!
Descensus facilis Averni; so
The way into the depths of Ki-lau-e-a.
From crag to crag, with alpine-stock in hand,
(And Virgil, as he traversed hell with Dante,
Beside me, in the guise of a Kanaka,||)
I pass into the fire-formed, slag-walled chasm.
Now, noting on the brink of the abyss
A fringe of interwoven ferns and roses,
Recalling to my mind the floral wreaths
Around the bald skulls of Palermo?s dead,
And the allurements of the limner?s art
Upon the house-walls of Pompeii?s vice.
Now, coming to the great crescentic plane
That forms the northern portion of the pit,?
What bushes� hang their berries in my sight,
As if, with Atdanta?s art, to tempt
Me from my course?pink berries, tartly sweet,
Like pouting lips that cry and kiss at once;
But all in vain; I stoop and eat, but stay not.
NTow, coming to a second level plane
That forms the floor of Ki-lau-e-a proper,
1 leave the line of life and all is death?
I walk upon the surface of a sea,
As black and still, though broken into waves,
And swirling eddies, curling crests and surf,


As if it were the floods of Acheron
Tossed by a tempest to the highest notch,
And in that instant frozen into ice!
A Mer-de-Glace of glassy, glossy lava,
Bespangled with a dust of olivine
In golden points and iridescent hues,
As I have seen the sea at midnight starred
And streaming with prismatic living light?
That of the phosphorescent ac.dephs.
Anon, amid the fumes and gases from
A score of vents, and in the scorching heat
Emitted from two glowing, flaming chimneys
Yclept the Little Beggars ?in their throats
Great diphtheritic clots depending, like
Stalactites in a limestone cave, ?I pause,
Uncertain, hesitating, fearful, lest
The crust of lava break beneath my feet,
As haply it has done a thousand times,
And in the liquid fire, I perish, like
Empedocles within the flood of Etna!
I pause, but for a moment, then proceed?
My fears henceforth dispelled in the delight
Of apprehended imminent destruction.
Until, at length, a league of lava traversed,
And a great ragged, rock-like, reeking rim,
(In the similitude of an immense
Cathedral pile in smoking, toppling ruin,)
Ascended and descended, I recoil
A step, and stand transfixed in awe and wonder
I am within the trembling, steaming walls
Of Ki-lau-e-a?s centre, and behold
The lake of liquid lava,
In shape elliptic, and in circuit half
A mile, in ragged lines obscured by steam;


The surface of the molten mass, a scum,
Like sable satin, ever setting from
The centre, and, in crinkling laps and folds
And crunching volutes, breaking on the shores;
Here, parting and revealing through a rent
The liquid fire beneath, in bands and seams
Of interblending pink and cherry-red;
There, heaving in elastic billows, and,
In vast concentric circles eddying,
Till parting in a swaying arc, an ooze
Of glowing lava, pink and orange hued.
Appears, and like a worm of unctuous fire
Upon a (Jeep black velvet leaflet, writhes
Until, with fading colors, it expires;
Here, parting on the shore-surf's crinkling crest,
A myriad of jets of bluish flame
Leap from the sharp uplifted fracture, like
A fringe of blue upon a fun?ral pall;
There, cracking suddenly from shore to shore,
The liquid fire appears along the line
Like lurid lightning in a midnight sky?
And see! that jet of water-gas escape
And carry with it in the air a spurt
Of lava in the form of glassy floss
As fine as ever spun by China?s worm?
A lock belike from Pe-le?s frizzled pow;
And here, the surface rocking, swirling, till
Dissolving, lo! within the circle formed,
A fount of fire! the solid central cones
Uprising twenty feet, the spluttering spurts
As many more, and falling with the sound
Of roof-snow passing into pavement-slush?
A fount of fire assuming various forms,
A trident now, and now a spreading tree,


A head-d&ss now and now a devil-fish,
But ever of one hue, the rare compound
Of pink and orange found within the folds
Of the pomegranate?s dainty, filmy bloom,
Or in the rounded lips of one among
Ten thousand fair-haired, blue-eyed girls?
A solid color without tint or shade,
And though composed of seeming lambent fire.
Emitting strangely no more light than sounl?
A daub and splotch of a pomegranate-red
Upon a sable ground, and nothing more;
And there, against a vertically cut
Half-cone, upon the margin of the lake,
The surface setting in pulsating throbs,
Until behold! a miniature volcano
Combining the phenomena of both
Vesuvius and Ha-le-mau-mau: an
Eruptive show?r of lava falling on
The half-cone on the shore, and a cascade
Returning to the source from which it came
And so the scene is ever varied and
Disjoined, until behold! the lava lake
Is all aglow and twenty fountains play
Within the wondrous circle of its shores!
Oh, for the word to compass in its sound
This seething, surging, spouting sea of fire!
It is a mighty maelstrom ladle-dipped
From out the ocean caldron of the Sun!
Aye, Ha-le-mau mau is the orb of day
Within the circuit of a half a mile;
And in my journey hither?to this lake
Within the walls of Ki-lau-e-a and
The foam-fringed confines of Ha-wai-i, I,
In philosophic fact, have visited


The Earth, emerging from its primal floods,
The Moon, a-cold beyond Poor Tom?s degree,
And the ensphered volcanic fire, the Sun!
O glorious age of glass?of lens and prism,**
That purblind man, with comprehensive gaze,
May see the far anear, the near afar,
And poets and philosophers compound
Their facts and fancies in resultant truth!
Anon, the rubber of a cloudy night
Erases all the world save that within
The walls of Ha-le-mau-mau, in my sight
And hearing: lava-lighted crater-crags
In-arching like the petals of a great
Corolla, tinted yellow, pink, and blue;
Thin clouds of water-gas,obscurely white,
And fumes of sulphur, as obscurely blue,
Ascending from the circle of the lake,
An incense from a thousand unseen censers;
And, in the surface of the lava lake,
The satin sable turned to velvet black,
And the pomegranate red transmuted to
The glowing yellow hue of molten gold;
A fitful light diffusing from the founts
Illuming weirdly the volcanic void
Without or shade or sheen; the only gleam
Upon the velvet scum a shimmering
Reflection from the vapor-clouds above;
Until, the periodic break-up come,
The surface for a moment is a glare?
A sunburst through a dark?ning tempest?s rack,
And then a sunset in a golden glamour.
I sit upon a lava rock and watch
The varying phases of the wondrous lake,


Until the res�l passes from my sight
And the ideal enters in its stead:
The thing a thought within my musing mind;
The fact a fancy in my reverie;
The world of wonders of the fire-abyss
A filmy breath-blown bubble of the brain.
I pass into the being of Macbeth,
And lo! in looking into Ha-le-mau-mau,
I look into the witches? caldron?see
The eye of newt and toe of frog descend
Into the seething hell-broth to compound
The diabolic charm; the while I hear,
In the cascading of the fiery founts,
The ? bubble, bubble, toil and trouble ? of
The mystic mumbling of the midnight hags.
Anon, I creep up to a pitfall?s brink,
Within the jungle of a Bengal vale,
And through the broken reeds across the chasm
Behold the livid black and yellow bands
And glaring eyes of an emprisoned tiger?
A beast that, startled at my coming, leaps
From wall to wall so swift and fiercely that
It seems, in my bewildered sight, to be
Expanded to the compass of the pit;
The while I hear a low deep growl that shakes
The mountain walls around me to their base.
Anon, I enter Rome?lmperial Home?
And one among a hundred thousand press
Into the Coliseum, and conduct
Ale to a seat, whence looking down I see,
In the arena eighty feet below,
A thousand Goth and Gallic warriors


With sword and shield engage in battle strife;
To know no pause nor end, until 1 see
The flashing blades of steel ope founts of blood,
And then the battle-field a sea of gore;
And hear a dying moan hushed in the cheer
Of the encircling, surging, blood-crazed throng!
Anon, I listen to a murderer,
Repentant, in the throes and dread of death,
Recount the story of his awful deeds
At midnight done with an unfeeling blade;
Until I seem to see, betwixt his ribs,
The helj of Ha-le-mau-mau in his heart?
Its fires eternal to his sinful soul,
Consuming yet consuming not for aye.
Anon, I see the goddess Pe-le rise
Amid the fountains of the fiery lake,
A black-skinned, bloated, blood-shot, breastless
Around her neck a leift of leprous sores;
And in her hands a fire-charred newborn babe
Torn from a fruitful mother's dripping dug
And strangled in the hate of barrenness
Unto all things that mate and multiply;
A hag so horrible in form and feature.
hag!
A hag so terrible in aim and action,
A hag so hellish in her head and heart,.
ISTo eye can see nor fantasy conceive
Save in the walls and fires of Ila-le-mau-mau!


USTOTIES.
*Mauna Loa (pronounced as if spelled Mow-na Lo-a,
accented on the first syllable of each word, and signifying the
Long Mountain) is the largest in bulk of the volcanic cones of
Hawaii, its height being 13,650 feet above the level of the
sea, or 155 less than that of Mauna Kea (Kay-ah, signifying
the White Mountain,) and its base being eo-extensive with a
ffreat part of the island. Its crater-pit or calderon, called
Mokuaweoweo, (Mo-koo-ah-way-o-way-o, accented on the
first, fourth, and sixth syllables, and signifying the lied
Island,) is elliptic in shape, its long diameter 13,000 feet and
its short 8000, and its depth about 800 feet. Its eruptions,
which occur at irregular intervals of three, four, seven, eight,
and eleven years or so, are of the grandest proportions
known, the volume of lava ejected, as estimated, ranging
from seventeen to fifty billions of cubic feet. The Just
outburst occurred in 1880-1.
fThe bird?s-nest fern, Asplenium nidus. For the size of
the specimen referred to, attest Mr. Charles N. Arnold, of
Hilo, who cut it up into four sections and sent it to His
Majesty, King Kalakaua.
|The tree-ferns of Hawaii exceed in girth of trunk any I
have ever seen in India and Brazil. 1 have seen higher,
however, among the foothills of the Himalayas. Scrubby,
though they be in comparison with their ancestors of the
fern-age of the earth?s history, they are none the less
magnificent trees, and truly may be classed among the leafy
wonders of the world.
IjKanaka, used as a noun, a Hawaiian man, and, used as an
adjective, Hawaiian in general.
�A kind of cranberry, Vaccimum reticulaturn. The fruit of
this plant was considered sacred to Pele; and it was custom-
ary for the Hawaiian, before eating the same in the crater, to
cast some of the berries into the molten lava as an offering;
to her.


IThe description of the crater of Halemaumau is given as
I beheld it during the afternoon and night of Saturday, the
28th of February, 1885. Every phenomenon is given as it
appeared to me, not, however, in the sequence as reported in
the poem, hut as isolated from the world of wonders before
me at the time and carefully considered with a view to its
accurate reproduction in speech. I observed with especial
care, (seeking confirmation from a number of ladies and
gentlemen at my side, before recording a conclusion,) the
various colors presented in the ever-varying picture, since, it
seemed to me, I had never seen exactly the same hues in any
painting of the volcano I had inspected. While, accordingly,
the usual allowance might be made for lack of accuracy in a
poetic description, 1 should prefer that the metrical lines be
considered prose and accepted as prosaic truth or subjected
to the ordeal of the same. The steam or water-gas noted as
rising from the rim and fractured scum of the crater and
forming the cloud above, which, like a frosted lamp-shade,
served to reflect the light from the molten lava and diffuse
it throughout the volcanic void, is believed to have come
wholly from the atmosphere, either in the form of rain falling
directly into and about the crater or that of moisture involved
in the convection currents of the crater in the air and liquid
lava, and not from the lava as a volcanic product. As it was
raining at the time, and had been for several days previously,
the amount of steam in the crater at the time I beheld it was
doubtless in excess of that which usually is seen.
**lf the spectroscope ? the glorious invention of my coun-
tryman, Dr. David Alter, of Freeport, Pennsylvania?has
made one thing a positive fact in the realm of science that
before was questionable, it is that the sun and other stars are
revolving spheres of molten matter, as like the liquid lake of
Kilauea as a whole of infinite size may be to a finite part.

or garland, one of the most common and characteristic
ornaments of a Hawaiian woman.
