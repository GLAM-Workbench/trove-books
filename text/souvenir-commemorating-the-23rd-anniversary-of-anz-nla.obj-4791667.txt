THE GREAT WAR—I9I4-1918
AUSTRALIA'S PART.
f~~HE outbreak of the Great War created in Australia an intense Imperial
patriotism. The Australian Labour Government lost no time in declaring,
through the voice of Andrew Fisher the Prime Minister, that the Com-
monwealth was behind the Mother Country "to the last man and the last shilling."
The first act in the redemption of that pledge was the placing of the Australian
Fleet under the orders of the British Admiralty. The next offer was a contingent
of 20,000 soldiers. This support was gratefully accepted by the Imperial Authorities.
The world now knows how that first contingent was continually reinforced
until the total number of Australian soldiers enlisted for active service reached the
colossal figures of 416,809. Of that number the various states contributed the
following:—New South Wales, 164,030; Victoria, 112,399; Queensland, 57,705;
South Australia, 34,959; Western Australia, 32,231; Tasmania, 15,485. The
casualities during the war numbered 59,231 killed and missing, and 166,807
wounded. The Australian Imperial Force provided five complete infantry divisions,
two cavalry divisions, a flying corps of four fighting squadrons, army medical
service, heavy artillery, engineers and a wireless detachment. They fought on all
the important fields of operation with a distinguishing valour which won the
admiration of the world.
The first act of hostility in which Australian troops were engaged was the
seizing of German naval stations in the Pacific. On August 1 9th, General Holmes
sailed from Sydney in the troopship "Berrima" with 1,500 men. The expedition
was successful in capturing and occupying all the German possessions in the Pacific
south of the equator. On November Ist, 1914, a transport fleet of 38 ships sailed
under convoy from Albany with 22,000 Australian and 8,000 N.Z. troops.
An incident of the voyage of this Great Armada was the engagement
between the "Sydney" and the "Emden" in which the latter after a short, yet fierce
engagement, was completely put out of action and destroyed. It was the original
intention that the Australian and New Zealand troops should proceed to England,
for training; but, through the advent of Turkey into the war it was deemed advis-
able to land the troops in Egypt. Here they were formed into the Australian and
New Zealand Army Corps. For brevity the long title was cut down to its initial
letters and became known as the "Anzac Corps"—the word Anzac to-day has a
glory all its own. The corps was placed under the command of General Birdwood
and under his direction it was trained on the desert sands until it became the
finest fighting organisation the world has ever seen.
ON GALLIPOLI.
The Anzacs received their real baptism of fire at the landing on Gallipoli on
April 25th, 1915. They were part of the Allied forces consisting of 70,000 men
under the command of Sir lan Hamilton.
The landing on Gallipoli was a brilliant military achievement, comparable
to Wolfe's scaling the Heights of Abraham, at Quebec; also their tenacity in
hanging on to what proved an untenable position, and the untimate successful
evacuation proved the troops to be of the highest quality. Had they been of an
inferior mould they would have been swept off the peninsula and destroyed. After
the evacuation they were embarked for France and there they covered them-
selves with glory. On the continent with the reinforcements continually received
from Australia they quickly became an important part of the British Army. The
mounted troops remained in Egypt and ultimately became part of General Allenby's
forces which swept the Turks out of Palestine.
To recount the activities of Australian military forces in the Great War, even
in the briefest detail, is beyond the scope of this article; suffice to say that Aus-
tralia's efforts, while being of great material benefit to the Allied cause, had also
demonstrated the unshakable solidarity of the British Empire.

Anzac Commemoration, 1938
THE DAWN SERVICE.
Of all Anzac Services held in Parramatta, none is more impressive than the one held
at dawn on each Anzac Day.
In the dim morning light, the men march in silence to the Memorial. Apart from the
tramp of marching feet, the only sound to break the stillness of the morning, is the sweet
chiming of bells from the historic old churches of "St. John's" and "All Saints."
On the stroke of 4.30 a.m., the bells cease to chime, and the service commences.
At the conclusion of the service, the men proceed to "McKay's" in George Street, where
a special "Anzac" breakfast is held, and later, leave for Sydney to take part in thd Annual
Anzac March and Service.
ORDER OF SERVICE.
Held at the Soldiers Memorial, Parramatta, at Dawn on the Morning of the 25th
April, 1938, to Commemorate the 23rd Anniversary of the Landing at Anzac.
Opening remarks by the President,
Mr. G. H. T. MOREHOUSE.
Hymn: Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me. Amen.
Prayer: Rev. W. MILLS ROBSON (Chaplain, Ex-A.1.F.)
Placing of Wreaths.
Roll of Drums.
Last Post.

Hymn: O God, our Help in ages past,
Our Llope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal Home.
Under the shadow of Thy Throne,
Still may we dwell secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
O God our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal Home.
Benediction.
GOD SAVE THE KING.

We are pleased to welcome as a mem-
ber, Capt. James Macarthur-Onslow, a
great-great-grandson of the pioneer John
Macarthur.
During the Great War, Capt. Mac-
arthur-Onslow served with the 16th
(Queen's) Lancers. He is the son of
General Macarthur-Onslow of Camden
Park, and is the President of the British
Ex-Cavalry Men's Sub-Branch.
Since the end of 1 934, nearly
£4OO has been distributed in relief,
and to various Charitable organisa-
tions, by "Macarthur'' Sub-Branch.
The members of "Macarthur" Sub-
Branch tender their sincere thanks to
Messrs. Richards Bros, and Payne, who
have again, placed at their disposal, "The
Astra Theatre, for the Anzac Commem-
oration Concert.
Messrs. Richards Bros, and Payne have
at all times taken a very keen interest in
the ex-service men of the district, their
assistance, and ready co-operation being
much appreciated by all returned men.
On Monday, 11 th April, members
were entertained by Mr. Frank Perkins
(better known to most diggers as
"Perko"), and Mr. Will Ward.
Perko, who is without doubt, the
most popular Digger entertainer in
N.S.W., gives the greater part of his time,
entertaining returned soldiers in hospital.
His breezy personality and ready wit,
together with the excellent company of
assisting artists he usually has with him,
has done much to cheer up some of our
less fortunate cobbers.
| We h ope to have "Perko" with us
j again on the occasion of our Annual
"Back to Macarthur" Night.


THE CHURCH OF ST. JOHN'S, PARRAMATTA.
The famous twin spires of the fine old structure stand out as final to-day, amid the bustle of
the surrounding town as they did in the far off days when the artist made this sketch. The
picture also shows very well the difference in the appearance of the town between those old
times and the present. It was drawn, as will be seen by the stage coach in the foreground,
before the era of that means of transit to the town had completely given place to that
of the steamboat.

A unique ceremony took place on the beach at Anzac on the morning
of 25th April, 1935, the 20th Anniversary of the landing, when the ashes of
the ribbons taken from wreaths placed on the Cenotaph in Martin Place,
Sydney, were scattered on the beach by Mr. Tasman Millington, of the

AN EASY MARK.
Constable (to motorist) : "Excuse me,
sir, but your lights are out."
Motorist: "Oh, thanks; but it doesn't
really matter."
Constable: "Yes, it does. By the way,
have you got your driving licence?"
Motorist: "Driving licence? Never had
one."
Constable: "Is that so? All right. The
charges are mounting."
At this point, the motorist's wife leaned
across and said, sweetly: "Don't pay too
much attention to what he says, Con-
stable; he's always like that when he's
drunk."
A GOOD DESCRIPTION.
An excited man dashed into a police
station at midnight, explaining that his
wife had been missing since eight o'clock
that morning, and asking that a search be
made for her.
"Her description," said the sergeant.
"Height? "
"I—l don't know."
"Weight? "
The husband shook his head vaguely.
Color of eyes?
"Er—average, I expect."
"Do you know how she was dressed?"
'I expect she wore her hat and coat.
She took the dog with her."
"What kind of a dog?"
"Brindle bull terrier, weight 1 5-J lbs.,
four dark blotches on his body, shading
from grey to white; round blackish spot
over left eye, white stub tail, a small nick
in left ear, a silver link collar with "
That will do," said the sergeant.
"We'll find the dog."

NO HALF-MEASURES.
The young man seated himself at a
table, picked up the menu and gave his
order.
"I'd like a nice steak and a glass of
ale," he said.
"Fillet, sir?" inquired the waiter, re-
ferring to the steak.
"Why, of course," said the young man,
"right up to the top."
IMAGINITIS.
Jones was one of those nervous beings
who suffered in imagination with every
complaint under the sun. One day, long
before his usual hour for returning from
the office, he came staggering home bent
almost double. He sank moaning into a
chair, curled in a half-moon shape.
"Mary," he gasped, "I'm afraid I'm
done for this time. It came on me so
suddenly, without any warning, and I
found myself all doubled up, can't even
raise my head. Fetch the doctor quick."
When the doctor arrived and glanced
over him, Jones gasped:
"Is-is there an-any hope, doctor?"
"Well, Mr. Jones," said the doctor,
"there is plenty of hope if you will just
unhitch the third button of your vest from
the top button of your trousers."
NASTY ACCIDENT.
The dear old lady approached the bed
where a soldier lay almost hidden in a
mass of bandages.
Oh, poor man, she said, have you
been wounded?"
"Oh, no, mum, I ve been kicked by a
canary."
